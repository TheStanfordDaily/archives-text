# Oregon State steals second place, 63-61
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
It was the stuff of which
legends are made.
Almost.
Stanford junior guard
Todd Lichti was gazing at
a 47-38 Oregon State lead
and an utterly selfless Bea-

ver team effort on Saturday afternoon
when he decided to take matters into his
own hands.
And for the next six minutes, from the
12:58 mark to the 6:27 mark of the second
half, Lichti scored 14 consecutive Cardinal
points and 17 out of 19 during the 19-4
blitzkrieg which put Stanford ahead 57-51.
Lichti fired two 18-foot jumpers, buried
three gut-wrenching 3-pointers and bolted
inside twice, once flushing the ball around
the rim and in, and once sinking two free
throws after being hacked.
The 6-foot-4 Cardinal gunslinger had the
Beavers reeling and Maples Pavilion rock
ing in disbelief as much as in ecstasy.
"When Todd's back is against the wall
like that, that's when he shows his stuff
the best," Cardinal redshirt Eric Reveno
said after the gartie. "He was pretty unbe
lievable out there."
But he wasn't enough.
For with five minutes left in the game
and Stanford leading 59-57, the Cardinal
turned the ball over on four consecutive
possessions, and Oregon State recovered
from the onslaught.
Beaver guard Gary Payton scored two
layups and sank a free throw in the waning
minutes to put OSU ahead 63-61, and Car
dinal freshman Andrew Vlahov's last
second driving shot fell short. Final score,
Oregon State 63, Stanford 61, Todd Lichti
27 points.
Thus the legendary Beaver Coach Ralph
Miller won his 649 th career game and
postponed the Lichti legend in the process.
The crucial victory moved Oregon State
into sole posession of second place in the
Pacific 10 Conference'with an 11-5 record,
17-8 overall. Stanford (18-9, 10-6) dropped
into a third place tie with UCLA in the
Pac-10.
In the final seconds of the game, the
Beavers had the luxury of being able to
give away two fouls before putting Stanford
on the free throw line. Vlahov's final shot
may have looked forced, but the Aussie
freshman was following Cardinal Coach
Mike Montgomery's instructions to go
strong to the hoop, so that when Oregon
State fouled, it would be a shooting foul.
But no whistle blew and on the rebound
Vlahov and Beaver Bill Sherwood were tied

up for a jump ball. The possession arrow
pointed OSU's way and the Beavers had
a win.
"We were just trying to take the ball
aggressively to the hoop as fast as we
could," Montgomery said.
Miller pulled off the victory by using five
players for the entire 40 minutes. And that
quintet of ironmen used a quick and tena
cious 2-3 zone defense to deny Stanford
the inside game which had skinned the
Beavers last month in Corvallis.
"I don't believe in resting people just for
the fun of it," Miller said. "We practice
two hours every day — why should we
have a problem playing for 40 minutes,
especially with all the TV timeouts."
The Beaver five, led by sophomore slash
and-burn guard Payton, held Stanford big
men Greg Butler and Howard Wright to
13 shots with the sagging and slapping
zone. And on offense, the small Beavers
used their quickness to the utmost.
"We could not get them square, we could
not stop their penetration and they hit the
shots," Montgomery said. "You've got to
give Oregon State credit. They played great
basketball."
Payton led the Beavers with 17 points,
and backcourt mate Eric Knox followed
with 15. All five OSU players finished in
double figures.
The loss was even more excruciating for
the Cardinal because the mistakes in the
critical four-turnover stretch were more
like misfortunes.
With Stanford ahead 59-58 at the 4:15
mark, Cardinal reserve Derek Bruton had
the ball and inside position but dribbled
the sphere off his foot and out of bounds.
After an airball by Payton, Stanford guard
Scott Meinert had Lichti open on the
baseline for a layup, but Butler thought
the bounce pass was for him and tipped
it away.
Finally, after another Payton miss and
a long scramble for the loose ball, Cardinal
guard Oliver Cunningham got the ball to
Lichti at half court. But as Lichti turned
upcourt, he unbelievably bounced the ball
off his foot and the ever-present Payton
snatched the rolling ball and laid it in to
put Oregon State ahead 60-59 with 2:44
remaining in the contest.
"They were not poor plays. How many
times do you see someone dribble it off
their foot and then Bruton does it and
Todd does it," Montgomery said. "It was
unbelievable."
Unbelievability seemed to be the theme
of the game. The Beavers started the con
test on fire, sinking 11 of their first 13
shots, one of which was blocked. Despite

the sharpshooting, Stanford only trailed
22-14.
As the game progressed, it became alarm
ingly apparent that Miller wasn't even con
sidering a substitution. Afterwards, Miller
simply said, "I've been known to do that
before," and starter Sherwood shrugged-off
his lack of vacation time by saying, "No
problem." Indeed, in the waning moments
the Beaver players did not seem to lose a
step.
Of course all talk of unbelievable play
must return to Todd Lichti. With the Car

dinal trudging along, down by nine points
and visions of second place and an NCAA
tournament bid fading away, Lichti seized
the stage.
"He was unbelievable," Sherwood said.
"7 knew his shots were going in, but I
don't know if he knew they were going in.
I don't know if he was awake."
"Obviously Todd was very motivated out
there," Montgomery said. "He started at
tacking and focused more. Todd took over
and got us back in the ballgame."

Todd Lichti was gazing at
a 47-38 Oregon State lead
and an utterly selfless Bea-

ver team effort on Saturday afternoon
when he decided to take matters into his
own hands.
And for the next six minutes, from the
12:58 mark to the 6:27 mark of the second
half, Lichti scored 14 consecutive Cardinal
points and 17 out of 19 during the 19-4
blitzkrieg which put Stanford ahead 57-51.
Lichti fired two 18-foot jumpers, buried
three gut-wrenching 3-pointers and bolted
inside twice, once flushing the ball around
the rim and in, and once sinking two free
throws after being hacked.
The 6-foot-4 Cardinal gunslinger had the
Beavers reeling and Maples Pavilion rock
ing in disbelief as much as in ecstasy.
"When Todd's back is against the wall
like that, that's when he shows his stuff
the best," Cardinal redshirt Eric Reveno
said after the gartie. "He was pretty unbe
lievable out there."
But he wasn't enough.
For with five minutes left in the game
and Stanford leading 59-57, the Cardinal
turned the ball over on four consecutive
possessions, and Oregon State recovered
from the onslaught.
Beaver guard Gary Payton scored two
layups and sank a free throw in the waning
minutes to put OSU ahead 63-61, and Car
dinal freshman Andrew Vlahov's last
second driving shot fell short. Final score,
Oregon State 63, Stanford 61, Todd Lichti
27 points.
Thus the legendary Beaver Coach Ralph
Miller won his 649 th career game and
postponed the Lichti legend in the process.
The crucial victory moved Oregon State
into sole posession of second place in the
Pacific 10 Conference'with an 11-5 record,
17-8 overall. Stanford (18-9, 10-6) dropped
into a third place tie with UCLA in the
Pac-10.
In the final seconds of the game, the
Beavers had the luxury of being able to
give away two fouls before putting Stanford
on the free throw line. Vlahov's final shot
may have looked forced, but the Aussie
freshman was following Cardinal Coach
Mike Montgomery's instructions to go
strong to the hoop, so that when Oregon
State fouled, it would be a shooting foul.
But no whistle blew and on the rebound
Vlahov and Beaver Bill Sherwood were tied

up for a jump ball. The possession arrow
pointed OSU's way and the Beavers had
a win.
"We were just trying to take the ball
aggressively to the hoop as fast as we
could," Montgomery said.
Miller pulled off the victory by using five
players for the entire 40 minutes. And that
quintet of ironmen used a quick and tena
cious 2-3 zone defense to deny Stanford
the inside game which had skinned the
Beavers last month in Corvallis.
"I don't believe in resting people just for
the fun of it," Miller said. "We practice
two hours every day — why should we
have a problem playing for 40 minutes,
especially with all the TV timeouts."
The Beaver five, led by sophomore slash
and-burn guard Payton, held Stanford big
men Greg Butler and Howard Wright to
13 shots with the sagging and slapping
zone. And on offense, the small Beavers
used their quickness to the utmost.
"We could not get them square, we could
not stop their penetration and they hit the
shots," Montgomery said. "You've got to
give Oregon State credit. They played great
basketball."
Payton led the Beavers with 17 points,
and backcourt mate Eric Knox followed
with 15. All five OSU players finished in
double figures.
The loss was even more excruciating for
the Cardinal because the mistakes in the
critical four-turnover stretch were more
like misfortunes.
With Stanford ahead 59-58 at the 4:15
mark, Cardinal reserve Derek Bruton had
the ball and inside position but dribbled
the sphere off his foot and out of bounds.
After an airball by Payton, Stanford guard
Scott Meinert had Lichti open on the
baseline for a layup, but Butler thought
the bounce pass was for him and tipped
it away.
Finally, after another Payton miss and
a long scramble for the loose ball, Cardinal
guard Oliver Cunningham got the ball to
Lichti at half court. But as Lichti turned
upcourt, he unbelievably bounced the ball
off his foot and the ever-present Payton
snatched the rolling ball and laid it in to
put Oregon State ahead 60-59 with 2:44
remaining in the contest.
"They were not poor plays. How many
times do you see someone dribble it off
their foot and then Bruton does it and
Todd does it," Montgomery said. "It was
unbelievable."
Unbelievability seemed to be the theme
of the game. The Beavers started the con
test on fire, sinking 11 of their first 13
shots, one of which was blocked. Despite

the sharpshooting, Stanford only trailed
22-14.
As the game progressed, it became alarm
ingly apparent that Miller wasn't even con
sidering a substitution. Afterwards, Miller
simply said, "I've been known to do that
before," and starter Sherwood shrugged-off
his lack of vacation time by saying, "No
problem." Indeed, in the waning moments
the Beaver players did not seem to lose a
step.
Of course all talk of unbelievable play
must return to Todd Lichti. With the Car

dinal trudging along, down by nine points
and visions of second place and an NCAA
tournament bid fading away, Lichti seized
the stage.
"He was unbelievable," Sherwood said.
"7 knew his shots were going in, but I
don't know if he knew they were going in.
I don't know if he was awake."
"Obviously Todd was very motivated out
there," Montgomery said. "He started at
tacking and focused more. Todd took over
and got us back in the ballgame."
