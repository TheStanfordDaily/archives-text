# Beaver zone stumps Card
## 
### Erik Sten Senior staff writer 
Oregon State Coach Ralph Mil
ler is the NCAA's winningest ac
tive coach. Now in his 37th and
final year on the bench, the vet
eran Miller has a cumulative
record of 648-359. Saturday af
ternoon in his last Maples Pavil
ion appearance, he showed why.
Earlier this season in Corvallis,
Ore., the Cardinal, spearheaded
by the inside play of Greg Butler
and Howard Wright, handed the
Beavers a 78-65 defeat.
Miller had to do something. His
starting center Bill Sherwood is
only 6-foot-6; his big forward,
Earl Martin, just 6-5. Against the
6-8 Wright and 6-11 Butler they
didn't stand much of a chance.
Miller's answer was a 2-3 zone,
a great coaching move which the
five Beavers played to perfection.
"They knew they couldn't han
dle us inside so they played soft
on the perimeter and packed it
in," Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
an unusually poor shooting night
from the outside made it impos
sible to spread out the Beaver
zone and open up the inside.
On the other end of the court,
Miller showed just what a coach
can do with a small quick team.
Working the ball around the
perimeter, the Beavers controlled
the game's tempo, patiently
waiting until they could isolate
one of their speedsters who then
burned the Cardinal guarding
him.
After the game, Montgomery
said that maybe he should have
tried the zone, which was reason
ably effective near the end of the
game, sooner. "They were spread
out across the court, so I thought
about going to the zone. In
retrospect, we probably should
have given it a three- or four
minute look in the first half, just
to see how it would do," he said.
