# Netters drop Arizona
## Arizona St. takes a rain check for today 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
The past few seasons for the Stanford
women's tennis team can be summed
up in two words: injuries and vic
tories.
This weekend top-ranked Stanford
added to both ledgers. The Cardinal
beat No. 15 Arizona 7-1 Friday to

up its record to 9-0, but freshman Sandra Birch
aggravated an injury to her right leg during the
match.
Saturday, Stanford's match against No. 16
Arizona State was halted by rain in the middle of
the singles matches. The match will be resumed
today at 1:30 p.m. at the Stanford Tennis Stadium
with the Cardinal leading in three singles contests,
trailing in two and even in the other.
Birch, who injured her leg last Wednesday in the
weight room, rallied in the No. 3 singles match
Friday to post a 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 win over Harriet
Knols and clinch the team victory for the Cardinal.
"I was really kind of hurting toward the end," Birch
said. "I shouldn't have played Friday. It was kind
of stupid."
After her singles victory, Birch teamed with senior
Cari Hagey in the No. 1 doubles. "In retrospect, I
probably shouldn't have played her in doubles,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said.

Birch will not play today against ASU, and she
said she is not sure if she will be ready to travel
with the team to Madison, Wis., for next weekend's
Women's National Collegiate Indoor Team Tennis
Championship.
"It's still really tight," Birch said of her right
leg. "I've been stretching it and icing it, but it's
just so darn tight."
Birch joins junior Eleni Rossides on the injured
list. Rossides, the Cardinal's No. 1 singles player,
continues to be hampered by a groin ailment. "She
seems to have plateaued a bit," Brennan said of
Rossides' recovery. "The trainer's concerned that
it's more than a muscle pull (the original diagnosis).
It might be a ligament."
Rossides has not played in three weeks, and like
Birch, she is questionable for the national indoors.
"I'm more concerned about Eleni than Sandra for
nationals," Brennan said.
Despite Rossides' absence, the Cardinal continues
to roll this season. Friday, senior Kay Tittle and
freshman Teri Whitlinger remained undefeated in
dual-match play with convincing victories over their
Wildcat foes. Tittle blanked Jackie Ranger 6-0, 6-0
in the No. 5 contest, and Whitlinger whipped
Danielle Klurman 6-0, 6-1 in the No. 4 singles.
Teri's sister Tami was equally efficient. She pum
meled Arizona's Susan Russo 6-0, 6-1 in the No. 1

match. One court over, sophomore Lisa Green came
on strong in the second set to record a 6-3, 6-0
win over Betsy Somerville.
The Wildcats got their lone victory in the No. 6
singles, where Nancy Breen upended Stanford's
Valerie Wilson 7-6, 7-5.

The Cardinal won the second and third doubles
in straight sets to bring the final score to 7-1. The
No. 1 doubles, which pitted two of the top teams
in the nation against each other, was stopped be
cause of darkness after Stanford's Birch and Hagey
and Arizona's Russo and Somerville split sets.



Michael Topolovac â€” Dally
Freshman Sandra Birch, braving pain from a leg injury, pulled out a three-set win on Friday over
Arizona's Harriet Knols at No. 3 singles, giving the Cardinal its ninth win of the season against no losses.
