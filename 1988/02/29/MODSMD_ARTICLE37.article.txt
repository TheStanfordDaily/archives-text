the Farm Saturday
and the men's
swim team was un
able to shake free

of all of the surrounding gloom.
Although the Cardinal battled
until the final race, it was unable
to overcome tiredness and a
strong California squad and
dropped its final dual meet of the
season to the Golden Bears, 80-62.
The loss, which brought the
defending NCAA champion's
record to 5-5, was not as disap
pointing to the Cardinal as its
times were. Although Stanford
definitely desired to beat the now
7-1 Bears, its primary goals were
having all of its swimmers clock
seasonal bests and gaining mo
mentum for the upcoming Pacific
10 Conference Championships.
The squad failed to accomplish
either. Nor did the squad qualify
any more swimmers to the NCAA
Championships. As of yet, only
backstrokers Sean Murphy and
Jay Mortenson, and butterflier

Anthony Mosse have made the
cut.
While two-thirds of the Cardi
nal team swam their fastest races
of the year, a number of swim
mers did not have stellar perform
ances, which worried Asst. Coach
Ted Knapp.
"It was one of the most bizarre
end-of-the-season meets in that
we're still only having fifty per
cent of the guys swim faster times
than they have done in less con
ducive conditions," he said. "The
fact that we lost the meet because
two or three people did not swim
seasonal bests was disappoint

According to tri-captain
Murphy, the Cardinal was hurt
not only by some surprisingly
quick swims from the strong Cal
squad, but also by its own fatigue.
"Our team needs a lot more rest.
I thought we were going to swim
faster today," he said.
"We did not swim the second
half of races like we normally do
this time of the year. We really
need rest," Knapp added.
The Cardinal's performance
was far from entirely negative,
however. Murphy was victorious
in the 100- and 200-yard back

indication — we
are getting faster.
In two week's time
we will be hot.'

stroke events, while Mosse was a
also a double victor, in the 100
and 200 butterfly races. John
Witchel won the 200 free event
(and was only two-hundredths of
a second off the NCAA qualifying
standard) and took second in the
500 free, while sprinter Doug Lil
lydahl was victorious in the 100
free and placed second in the 50,
posting personal records in both
swims. In finishing third in both
butterfly races, Dave Schraven
also recorded personal bests.
Freshman Matt Rodgers took
three thirds — in the 100 and
200 breaststroke and the 200 in
dividual medley.
Although Stanford fell behind
in the second event — the 100

breast — and never caught the
Bears, it had a chance to win the
meet as late as the second-to-last
race. "We scored enough points
to stay in the meet, and we swam
competitively, which was a goal,"
Knapp said. "The spirit the squad
maintained was a big plus."
Cardinal divers placed first and
second on the three-meter board,
and first in the cne-meter event.
However, Matt Frawley and Mike
Burton competed against Cal ear
lier in the week, as they were in
Arizona at the Pac-10 Diving
Championships on Saturday. In
the sunny southwest they were
much more successful than the
remainder of their team. Frawley
was victorious on both the one
and three-meter boards, and Bur
ton took third in the three-meter
event. Both will compete in the
national championships in April.
Although it lost its first confer
ence meets in four years, the Car
dinal is still confident it can win
the Pac-10 Championships March
10-12. "The score was no indica
tion — we are getting faster,"
Mosse said. "In two week's time
we will be hot."
"We're not out of it yet by any
means," Knapp said.

According to tri-captain
Murphy, the Cardinal was hurt
not only by some surprisingly
quick swims from the strong Cal
squad, but also by its own fatigue.
"Our team needs a lot more rest.
I thought we were going to swim
faster today," he said.
"We did not swim the second
half of races like we normally do
this time of the year. We really
need rest," Knapp added.
The Cardinal's performance
was far from entirely negative,
however. Murphy was victorious
in the 100- and 200-yard back

indication — we
are getting faster.
In two week's time
we will be hot.'

stroke events, while Mosse was a
also a double victor, in the 100
and 200 butterfly races. John
Witchel won the 200 free event
(and was only two-hundredths of
a second off the NCAA qualifying
standard) and took second in the
500 free, while sprinter Doug Lil
lydahl was victorious in the 100
free and placed second in the 50,
posting personal records in both
swims. In finishing third in both
butterfly races, Dave Schraven
also recorded personal bests.
Freshman Matt Rodgers took
three thirds — in the 100 and
200 breaststroke and the 200 in
dividual medley.
Although Stanford fell behind
in the second event — the 100

breast — and never caught the
Bears, it had a chance to win the
meet as late as the second-to-last
race. "We scored enough points
to stay in the meet, and we swam
competitively, which was a goal,"
Knapp said. "The spirit the squad
maintained was a big plus."
Cardinal divers placed first and
second on the three-meter board,
and first in the cne-meter event.
However, Matt Frawley and Mike
Burton competed against Cal ear
lier in the week, as they were in
Arizona at the Pac-10 Diving
Championships on Saturday. In
the sunny southwest they were
much more successful than the
remainder of their team. Frawley
was victorious on both the one
and three-meter boards, and Bur
ton took third in the three-meter
event. Both will compete in the
national championships in April.
Although it lost its first confer
ence meets in four years, the Car
dinal is still confident it can win
the Pac-10 Championships March
10-12. "The score was no indica
tion — we are getting faster,"
Mosse said. "In two week's time
we will be hot."
"We're not out of it yet by any
means," Knapp said.
