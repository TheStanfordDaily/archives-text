knows what it's
like to have
your worst
enemy be your
self. The Stan
ford women's

gymnastics team has found
out, too. In Maples Pavilion
Friday night in a meet against
No. 1 UCLA, the Cardinal
seemed on a path to self
destruction.
"We're not confident in our
selves, yet," junior Cheryl Doo
explained. "UCLA's reputation
precedes them and it can be
very intimidating."
This nagging doubt affected
most of the Cardinal's perform
ances, causing a 186.35-183.50
loss to UCLA. Sophomore Dina
Amoroso's consistent top
notch performances were the
exception, earning her the all
around title for the evening
with a very strong 38.10 total.
The Cardinal also competed
Saturday night in Seattle, fall
ing to Washington by a 186.35-
184.65 margin.
The initial event for the Car
dinal on Friday, vault, was as
impressive as ever, with
Amoroso's 9.50 and Jinny
Rhee's 9.55 scores giving the
Cardinal an early 46.75-46.25
lead.
But the advantage was only
fleeting as falls on bars devas
tated the women. By the time

the team moved onto beam, the
Cardinal appeared visibly
shaken and had fallen behind
the Bruins by a full two points.
Balance beam is the event
where high confidence levels
are the most important in or
der to produce aggressive
routines. Only the veteran
Cindy Boyd, with a clean 9.15
routine, and Amoroso, with an
almost flawless, fluid 9.60 set
to win the event, could muster
up what was needed.
A strong floor showing
proved to be too little too late.
Doo performed a nice double
full twist to earn a 9.40 and
Amoroso won the event with
her high-powered 9.50. Un
fortunately, at that point there
was no stopping the extremely
talented UCLA squad from
winning the competition hand
ily.
The loss did not come as a
complete surprise to the Car
dinal because of the Bruins'
top ranking, which reflects
their impressive line-up of
world class stars. This makes
Amoroso's achievement all the
more noteworthy.
In the second meet of this
weekend's double-header, the
Cardinal came up just short
again. The scores, which
favored the hometown Huskies
according to Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina, were not in
dicative of the gymnasts'
performances nor of the ultim
ate impact that this meet will
have on Stanford's future.
