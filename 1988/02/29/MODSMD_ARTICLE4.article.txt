# University moves ahead on electronic ID plan

### Eric Rosenfeld Staff writer 
The concept of a multipurpose,
university-wide identification card for use
by faculty, regular staff and students was
resurrected last week after a two-year
hiatus at the request of Registrar Sally
Mahoney.
Formed in 1985 under the guidance of
Mahoney, the University Machine
readable Identification Project recon
vened last Monday to re-evaluate an April
1986 report that discussed the merits
and feasibility of a university-wide ID
card.

"The meeting was held to determine
if there was any reason to issue machine
readable cards in the next few months,"
said Brenda Bangert, assistant director
for Student Systems in the Registrar's
Office.
"We feel that even though the libraries
would benefit most from such a card, as
of now there still does not exist a suffi
cient need," Bangert said. "It may well
be a couple of years."
The 1986 report recommended a vinyl
credit card with a magnetic stripe capable
of being used by the libraries for access
and circulation control. The group is now
considering a more encompassing card

which could be accepted by Food Service,
Tresidder Memorial Student Union and
the Bursar's Office.
The ID project's governing and
working groups are composed of repre
sentatives from the Registrar's Office,
Personnel, University Libraries, SLAC,
Food Service, Tresidder and other organ
izations that would benefit from a
machine-readable card.
No one from the ASSU was present at
last week's meeting, although an invita
tion had been extended to the Council
of Presidents.
"Being our first meeting as a group,
it was a reconnoitering session," said

Marick Payton, data administrator for
the Network for Student Information in
the Registrar's Office. "There is no need
to rush, but we should be getting
prepared for implementation by 1990 or
1991," said Payton, a member of the ID
project.
"No one is opposed to the idea," Payton
said. "Right now the issue is one of cost.
We must be able to convince the provost
that a university-wide ID card is neces
sary," he said.
The proposed card would speed up
check-out services at the libraries by elim
inating the need to fill out paper slips.
In addition, money could be saved by

using the card to control entrance to the
libraries.
"We believe that a card with a bar
code would definitely speed up our cir
culation services," said Joan Krasner,
chief of access services for the University
Libraries. University Libraries plans to
implement a fully automated circulation
system as soon as the necessary funding
is available, probably by 1991, she said.
Food Service is also in favor of a
university-wide ID card. "As long as the
card works, we have no objections," said
Kay Kiskan, Food Service's administra-
tive assistant for the residences.
Some problems exist with Food
Service's Vali-Dine meal cards,
which have a magnetic stripe on
the back. "They aren't meant to
go through the washing machine
or to be sat on," observed Kiskan.
"We've also had a little trouble
with demagnetization at the be
ginning of each quarter from the
magnets at the Bookstore," Kis
kan added. "But these problems
will happen nevertheless."

According to the 1986 ID proj
ect report, the proposed card must
meet certain requirements, the
most important of which is that
the card must be readable by an
automated teller machine. In ad
dition, for use in the University
Libraries, the card would need a
bar code label for automated cir
culation control.
Independent efforts are also
currently under way at Tresidder
to allow students to purchase
meals and items from the Store
with Food Service meal cards this
summer.
Students may have the option
of paying above and beyond what

they owe Food Service to obtain
a Tresidder crcdit line, according
to Bradford Chick, a student
member of the Tresidder Union
Board and chair of its Food Com
mittee. That credit, in turn, could
be used for purchases at a dis
counted rate, Chick said.
The Tresidder Board has tenta
tively endorsed the idea of
cooperating with Food Service,
but is awaiting the results of a
second cost-benefit analysis
before making a final decision, ac
cording to Chick, a junior.
"We're hoping for implementa
tion by summer quarter," Chick
said.
