# Gymnastics bests No. 1 UCLA
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
There can no
longer be any
doubt that the
1988 Stanford
men's gymnastics
team is a prime
contender for the

NCAA championship.
Friday night at Maples Pavilion,
in front of an awed crowd of 3,000,
the Cardinal set this year's na
tional standard and a school
record with a team score of
285.95. Seniors Chuck Gerardo,
Randy Besosa, and Mike Matzek
each proved themselves con
tenders for individual NCAA titles
in leading Stanford to a perform
ance the gymnasts expect will give
them the utmost respect of every
gymnastics aficionado in the
country. Gerardo's individual all
around total of 57.5 is also a
school record.
"We finally came together
tonight; this meet puts us on the
board," Besosa understated about
a team effort which cancelled out
hyperbole. "Everybody's going to
know about this."
In a dynamic presentation of
what it means for a team to meet
its potential, the Cardinal (12-4)
surpassed its own expectations for
this point in the season and sur
prised the injury-riddled No. 3
UCLA Bruins, handing the
defending national champions
their first defeat in 19 dual-meet
competitions. The Bruins, who
boast the talents of four U.S. Na
tional Team members, scored
232.50 points, but entered only
three competitors on some events
due to a rash of injuries experi
enced in the last two weeks.

"We put the really solid per
formance together.... We basi
cally hit everything and the guys
really looked sharp," Cardinal
Coach Sadao Hamada said, but
then cautioned that there is
"definitely" room for improve
ment.
Stanford's performance was
overstuffed with heroics — so
much so that Gerardo's all
around performance, the school
record 57.5, was par for the
course. Perhaps most remarkable
of all Gerardo's routines was his
pommel horse work. That event,
traditionally Gerardo's finest, in
cluded his only serious error of
the meet, as he fell off the horse
for the first time in his collegiate
career.
Gerardo's pommel horse miss
and Matzek's missed release on
the high bar combined to cost the
team an entire point, making its
285.95 total that much more out
standing. These two and their
teammates more than made up
for those two uncharacteristic
mistakes.
If a single highlight had to be
chosen, it would be Matzek's floor
routine. With four gymnasts com
peting at once throughout the
meet, it was often difficult to con
centrate on one event, but when
Matzek completed his first run
with an ethereal double layout he
took center stage. Only 5-foot-2,
Matzek is one of the nation's
quickest and strongest gymnasts
— a deadly combination best ev
idenced on the floor exercise. Mo
ments after a final acrobatic tum
bling run the scores went up: 9.9,
just a body tremor or two from
a perfect 10.

Friday against UCLA but boasted a 9.8 average, helping Stanford
garner the top team score this year, 285.95.
