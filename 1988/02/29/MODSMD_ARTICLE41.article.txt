# Men's tennis triumphs over Toreros, Anteaters
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
Sparked by a near-flawless
singles performance
against top-flight compe
tition over the weekend at
Stanford Tennis Stadium,
the Stanford men's tennis
team showed the distance

between the nation's top four teams and
the rest of the pack.
The No. 10 UC-Irvine Anteaters, with
convincing wins over No. 6 UCLA and
eighth-rated Michigan to its credit,
figured to be a stern test for the top-rated
Cardinal. Mike Cadigan, the Anteaters'
No. 6 player, hadn't lost a match all

season, and Irvine's No. 1 player, Mark
Kaplan, was an NCAA singles semi
finalist last year.
But yesterday, on the strength of its
singles play, Stanford wallopped the
potent UC-Irvine team 6-3, fueling
speculation that the hunt for the NCAA
title in May will remain a four-team bat
tle between the Cardinal, USC, Louisiana
State, and Georgia. In the National In
door Team Championships in Louisville
last weekend, USC defeated Stanford 5-1,
while LSU upset Georgia.
Saturday, Stanford's match against
Michigan was postponed, then cancelled
because of rain. Friday, the Cardinal
whitewashed the University of San Diego,
ranked 22nd, 9-0. San Diego fell to 6-4.

Yesterday's match marked the first
time this season that the Anteaters had
lost a dual match after singles competi
tion. Stanford improved to 9-1, while Ir
vine dropped to 7-3.
"That team feeling they have is
remarkable," UC-Irvine Coach Greg Pat
ton said. "They don't lose emotionally.
We kept standing up, and they kept on
knocking us to the ground. Stanford
deserves to be ranked No. 1; Stanford
and USC are going to be the top teams
for the NCAAs."
Sophomore Jeff Cathrall led the singles
brigade, easily disposing of Mike Briggs
6-3, 6-3. Freshman Glenn Solomon also
won in two sets, besting Shige Kanroji
6-3. 7-5. The Cardinal's Curtis Dunn,

breaking into starting lineup for the first
time this season, outlasted Cadigan 4-6,
6-4, 6-0.
"That's just a credit to them," Patton
said. "They kicked us where we thought
our tushes were pretty tough (fourth
through sixth singles). When the chips
were on the table, they were pulling up
aces. In many ways, they are the best
team we've faced all year."
At No. 1 singles, Jeff Tarango
rebounded from a shaky first set to pound
Kaplan 4-6, 6-1, 6-1. Tarango's
groundstrokes and return of serve were
just too much for the Anteater sopho
more.
The Cardinal's Patrick McEnroe was
equally impressive, fending off the pow

erful serves of Trevor Kronemann to pick
up a 7-5, 7-5 victory.
The lone Stanford singles setback was
at the No. 3 position, where freshman
Martin Blackman suffered his first dual
match loss of the season. Blackman
bowed 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 to UC-Irvine's Rich
ard Lubner.
After the 5-1 deficit following the
singles draw, the Anteaters bounced back
to win two of three doubles matches.
Kroneman and Briggs edged McEnroe
and Blackman 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, while Kaplan
and Lubner upended Tarango and fresh
man Wheaton 5-7, 7-5, 6-1.
At No. 3 doubles, Cathrall and soph
omore Eric Peus cruised past Cadigan
and Kanroji 6-3, 6-2.
