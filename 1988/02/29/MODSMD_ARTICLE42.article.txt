# Cornelius shines amid struggling Cardinal golfers
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
MONTEREY,
Calif. — Despite a
superb perform
ance by senior Kay
Cornelius, the
Stanford women's
golf team finished

a disappointing 11th at this past

weekend's Jostens/Patty Sheehan
Invitational at the Fort Ord Golf
Course's "Bayonet" Course.
Cornelius' final-round 73 was
the second-lowest individual
round on Sunday and moved her
from 13th into ninth place among
a field of more than 15 preseason
All-Americans.
"We had a very strong perform
ance from Kay (Cornelius)," said

Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin.
"Finishing ninth in that strong a
field was terrific."
Cornelius's three-day total of
229 pleased her. "I chipped and
drove the ball so much better this
weekend."
She had indicated prior to the
tournament that driving and put
ting would be the keys for her.
She did not miss a fairway the
entire weekend, and would have
scored even lower had her putts
Friday fallen instead of skating
off the edges of the cup.
Individually, someone finally
beat Texas' Michiko Hattori.
Dana Lofland of host and defend
ing NCAA Champion San Jose
State went 71-76-74 to beat the
world's top amateur. Hattori and
Duke's Sarah Leßrun were two
strokes behind Lofland at 223.
Caryn Louw of team champion
Tulsa and USC's Tracy
Nakamura tied for fourth at 226.
For the first time in her col
legiate career, freshman Jodi
Figley did not finish in the top
10. "I felt she put a lot of pressure

on herself to play really well, and
I don't think she'll be doing that
again," Baldwin said. "She just
tried too hard."
Figley struggled with her put
ting on Friday and Saturday. She
hit 14 and 15 greens in regulation,
respectively, yet shot 81 and 78.
"I just putted really bad," she
said.
Her 79 yesterday was unchar
acteristic. She played well from
tee to green, again hitting 14
greens in regulation. But the par
4's where she did not hit the green
in two were disastrous. She came
away on those four holes with one
par, one bogey, and two triple
bogeys.
I struggled the whole way
(Sunday)," she said. "My swing
just didn't feel very good the
whole day."
The other three Cardinal gol
fers did not fare well, either.
Freshman Kristin Ryan (82-86-
82) and sophomore Stephanie
Parel (80-81-83) both struggled
with their putting. According to

Baldwin, both play well enough
from tee to green "to play in this
league, but need to develop a reli
able tournament putting stroke."
"(Freshman) Michele Lyford, I
feel, is going to break out of her
slump in the next couple of tour
naments," Baldwin added. Lyford
finished well (79-82), but was hurt
by an opening-day 91.
This tournament unquestiona
bly had the toughest field the Car
dinal will face all year, according
to Baldwin. Eight of the nation's
top 10 teams competed, and none
of the teams was out of the top 20.
Tulsa, which fired a blazing
final-round 296, stole the tourna
ment championship from second
round leader Arizona State. The
Golden Hurricane finished with a
three-day total of 913. This was
their third victory this year, in
cluding last fall's Stanford Inter
collegiate.
Duke, which started the day
two strokes out of first, beat ASU
by seven strokes to finish five
back of Tulsa and five ahead of

the Sun Devils.
The next three teams — Texas,
San Jose State and USC — all
finished within three strokes of
each other.
Oklahoma State and UCLA tied
for seventh at 942, but UCLA's
team score is being disputed be
cause one of their players broke
her driver in frustration and then
had it illegally replaced. U.S. In
ternational (946) and San Diego
State (950) rounded out the top
10.
Not being ranked in the top 10
might help to lessen the disap
pointment of not beating the top
10 teams, but according to Cor
nelius the Cardinal used to play
these teams even and now is
finishing up to 40 strokes behind
them.
With the season past the
halfway mark, Baldwin said he
believes that if Stanford is to
qualify for one of the 14 NCAA
championship bids, the team is
"going to have to play as good as
[it] can possibly play the rest of
the year."

said.
Her 79 yesterday was unchar
acteristic. She played well from
tee to green, again hitting 14
greens in regulation. But the par
4's where she did not hit the green
in two were disastrous. She came
away on those four holes with one
par, one bogey, and two triple
bogeys.
I struggled the whole way
(Sunday)," she said. "My swing
just didn't feel very good the
whole day."
The other three Cardinal gol
fers did not fare well, either.
Freshman Kristin Ryan (82-86-
82) and sophomore Stephanie
Parel (80-81-83) both struggled
with their putting. According to

Baldwin, both play well enough
from tee to green "to play in this
league, but need to develop a reli
able tournament putting stroke."
"(Freshman) Michele Lyford, I
feel, is going to break out of her
slump in the next couple of tour
naments," Baldwin added. Lyford
finished well (79-82), but was hurt
by an opening-day 91.
This tournament unquestiona
bly had the toughest field the Car
dinal will face all year, according
to Baldwin. Eight of the nation's
top 10 teams competed, and none
of the teams was out of the top 20.
Tulsa, which fired a blazing
final-round 296, stole the tourna
ment championship from second
round leader Arizona State. The
Golden Hurricane finished with a
three-day total of 913. This was
their third victory this year, in
cluding last fall's Stanford Inter
collegiate.
Duke, which started the day
two strokes out of first, beat ASU
by seven strokes to finish five
back of Tulsa and five ahead of

the Sun Devils.
The next three teams — Texas,
San Jose State and USC — all
finished within three strokes of
each other.
Oklahoma State and UCLA tied
for seventh at 942, but UCLA's
team score is being disputed be
cause one of their players broke
her driver in frustration and then
had it illegally replaced. U.S. In
ternational (946) and San Diego
State (950) rounded out the top
10.
Not being ranked in the top 10
might help to lessen the disap
pointment of not beating the top
10 teams, but according to Cor
nelius the Cardinal used to play
these teams even and now is
finishing up to 40 strokes behind
them.
With the season past the
halfway mark, Baldwin said he
believes that if Stanford is to
qualify for one of the 14 NCAA
championship bids, the team is
"going to have to play as good as
[it] can possibly play the rest of
the year."

Senior Kay Cornelius finished ninth this weekend in Monterey.
MONTEREY,
Calif. — Despite a
superb perform
ance by senior Kay
Cornelius, the
Stanford women's
golf team finished

a disappointing 11th at this past

weekend's Jostens/Patty Sheehan
Invitational at the Fort Ord Golf
Course's "Bayonet" Course.
Cornelius' final-round 73 was
the second-lowest individual
round on Sunday and moved her
from 13th into ninth place among
a field of more than 15 preseason
All-Americans.
"We had a very strong perform
ance from Kay (Cornelius)," said

Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin.
"Finishing ninth in that strong a
field was terrific."
Cornelius's three-day total of
229 pleased her. "I chipped and
drove the ball so much better this
weekend."
She had indicated prior to the
tournament that driving and put
ting would be the keys for her.
She did not miss a fairway the
entire weekend, and would have
scored even lower had her putts
Friday fallen instead of skating
off the edges of the cup.
Individually, someone finally
beat Texas' Michiko Hattori.
Dana Lofland of host and defend
ing NCAA Champion San Jose
State went 71-76-74 to beat the
world's top amateur. Hattori and
Duke's Sarah Leßrun were two
strokes behind Lofland at 223.
Caryn Louw of team champion
Tulsa and USC's Tracy
Nakamura tied for fourth at 226.
For the first time in her col
legiate career, freshman Jodi
Figley did not finish in the top
10. "I felt she put a lot of pressure

on herself to play really well, and
I don't think she'll be doing that
again," Baldwin said. "She just
tried too hard."
Figley struggled with her put
ting on Friday and Saturday. She
hit 14 and 15 greens in regulation,
respectively, yet shot 81 and 78.
"I just putted really bad," she
said.
