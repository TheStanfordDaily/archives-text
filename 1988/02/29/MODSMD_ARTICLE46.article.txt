A headline in Friday's Daily in
correctly characterized the con
tent of an Academic Information
Resources staff meeting. The in
spection of student computer ac
counts will decrease as a result
of stricter guidelines, not in
crease, as the headline stated. Ad
ditionally, junior Perry Friedman
is an employee of IRIS, not LOTS,
as reported in the story. The Daily
regrets the errors.
