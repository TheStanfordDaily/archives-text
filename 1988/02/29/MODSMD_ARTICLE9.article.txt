# City may woo Giants
## E. Palo Alto to consider stadium proposal 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
The East Palo Alto City Council will vote
next week on whether to bid for construc
tion of a new stadium for the San Francisco
Giants.
Following the Giants' decision last fall
to leave San Francisco, owner Bob Lurie
has been looking for another home for the
team. The Giants are expected to move
out of San Francisco's Candlestick Park
when their lease expires in 1994.
East Palo Alto City Manager Stan Hall

said a stadium in the Ravenswood Indus
trial Park on Bay Road — a few miles east
of the Stanford campus — would be an
attractive location for Lurie.
Hall said advantages of an East Palo
Alto site would be its adequate traffic con
trol, its good weather and its close prox
imity to the Dumbarton Bridge and the
East Bay. He also pointed out that East
Palo Alto is closer to the homes of most
Giants season ticket holders, 40 percent of
whom live in Santa Clara and San Mateo
counties. He added that a stadium
in East Palo Alto would greatly
benefit the economies of Penin
sula communities.
Hall declined to predict whether
the city council will approve the
bid when it votes March 7.
Corey Busch, executive vice
president of the Giants, said he
had no comment on the likelihood

of a move to East Palo Alto. He
added, however, that the Giants
"are willing to listen to any and
all ideas."
Other sites currently being con
sidered by the Giants include San
Jose, Sacramento, Redwood City,
Miami and Vancouver, British Co
lumbia.
Although effects of an East Palo
Alto stadium on Stanford would
be "minimal," Hall said, such a
facility would "allow students to
be closer to recreational activity."
