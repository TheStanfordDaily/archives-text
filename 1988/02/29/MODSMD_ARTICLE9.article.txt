# City may woo Giants
## E. Palo Alto to consider stadium proposal 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
The East Palo Alto City Council will vote
next week on whether to bid for construc
tion of a new stadium for the San Francisco
Giants.
Following the Giants' decision last fall
to leave San Francisco, owner Bob Lurie
has been looking for another home for the
team. The Giants are expected to move
out of San Francisco's Candlestick Park
when their lease expires in 1994.
East Palo Alto City Manager Stan Hall

said a stadium in the Ravenswood Indus
trial Park on Bay Road — a few miles east
of the Stanford campus — would be an
attractive location for Lurie.
Hall said advantages of an East Palo
Alto site would be its adequate traffic con
trol, its good weather and its close prox
imity to the Dumbarton Bridge and the
East Bay. He also pointed out that East
Palo Alto is closer to the homes of most
Giants season ticket holders, 40 percent of
whom live in Santa Clara and San Mateo
