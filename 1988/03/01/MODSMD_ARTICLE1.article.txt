# Hospital nurses set 10-day strike deadline
## 
### Brooke Harrington 
The independent nurse's union
at Stanford Hospital announced
yesterday that they will call a
strike unless negotiations with
the hospital yield a new contract
within 10 days. Priscilla Wheeler,
the hospital's legal counsel, said
"no new meetings are scheduled"
to resolve the dispute.
Myra Lang, president and press
representative for the Committee
for Recognition of Nursing
Achievement, said the committee
represents 1,300 nurses at the

hospital, a division of the Stanford
Medical Center. The nurses' latest
two-year contract expired at 12:01
yesterday morning.
Lang declined to comment fur
ther, deferring questions to Pris
cilla Wheeler, the press represen
tative for both negotiating parties.
Wheeler said the two-year con
tracts proposed by each party
have been under scrutiny since
early December. The negotiating
teams worked through last week
end — until 3 a.m. Monday —
without reaching an agreement.
"We were definitely making

progress this weekend, so I was
surprised and disappointed that
we didn't push 0n.... Unfortu
nately, the committee felt differ
ently and chose to walk out,"
Wheeler said.
Wheeler characterized the dis
pute as "purely economics." The
union, she said, has proposed a
six percent general salary increase
in each of the next two years,
while the hospital is offering only
four percent.
The union also asked for an
additional 4.5 percent pay in
crease to be awarded to the hospi

tal's most senior nurses. There
are already six such pay increases,
or "steps," awarded to nurses on
the basis of seniority and certain
other "professional criteria."
Wheeler declined to specify
what these criteria were.
Registered Nurse Miriam
Sylvia-Torres — who works at the
hospital — said she was not fully
accquainted with the terms of the
contract being negotiated but was
concerned with the two percent
disjunction between the two
proposals.
"On the news tonight, they said

that inflation so far this year is
running at 4.4 percent. The Uni
versity pay raise won't even cover
that, let alone whatever inflation
there may be later," Sylvia-Torres
said.
In spite of her concerns, Sylvia-
Torres said she would be reluctant
to go on strike because this might
affect the quality of care offered
to patients.
"No one wants to hurt the
patients," Sylvia-Torres said.
Sylvia-Torres said she also
worried that the new contract
might cut benefits for part-time

nurses and tuition reimburse
ments for those nurses that need
to do additional coursework to
renew their licenses.
Director of Personnel Dan Rob
inson was on the negotiating team
for the nurses during contract dis
cussions two years ago. Though
he is not participating directly in
the current dispute, he said he is
optimistic about the parties reach
ing a compromise.
"I don't perceive it as a major
conflict. I have no reason to be
lieve that things won't be resolved
satisfactorily," Robinson said.
