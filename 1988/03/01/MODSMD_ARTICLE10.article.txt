# First lesbian sorority forms at UCLA
## Student leaders said a similiar institution at Stanford is unlikely 
### Bruce LeDesma Staff writer 
A sorority founded by lesbians at UCLA
earlier this month is the first of its kind in
the nation, but student leaders here
downplayed the possibility of such an or
ganization forming at Stanford in the near
future.
UCLA has officially recognized Lambda
Delta Lambda, enabling the nine-member
sorority to meet on campus, use the Uni
versity's name and apply for funding from
student activity funds.
The sorority may not exclude heterosexual
women from membership.
Students from Stanford's gay and lesbian
community, as well as campus sorority
leaders, were skeptical when asked whether
a similar organization might develop at
Stanford.
"I don't think it is something that's likely
to happen here," said a member of the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, who asked
not to be identified.
She noted that a lesbian sorority is not
as necessary here as it may be at UCLA,
where many students' social lives are con
nected to the sorority and fraternity system.
"I think it's a very good thing for UCLA
because the social life there revolves around
the Greek system," she said.

GLAS president Steve Sassaman ex
pressed pessimism about the idea. "I don't
see the need for GLAS to integrate itself
into a system which I consider sort of sexist
in the male sense," he said.
Inter-Sorority Council president Carol
DeMattei said it would be difficult for such
a sorority to form here. "I would see it
being tough at this school or at any school,"
she said. DeMattei, a senior, said most
sorority members would feel "a little
awkward at first" if such a sorority did form.
But she added that "if a [lesbian] group
wanted to [get a sorority started] we're will
ing to pursue it."
Although existing tension between the
Stanford Greek system and the gay and
lesbian community may preclude something
similar from happening here, there is a con
sensus among the Stanford students that
the relationship between the two groups is
improving.
"I am optimistic about openly gay men
rushing housed fraternities this year," said
the GLAS member who asked to remain
anonymous. Neither she or DeMattei knew
of any openly lesbian sorority members.
Delta Delta Delta sorority President Beth
Kruger, a senior, said she could see a lesbian
becoming a part of the sorority system. But
she said it is "not something that comes up
during Rush. It's a personal thing."

'I think it's a very good
thing for UCLA because
the social life there
revolves around the
Greek system.'

Sigma Chi fraternity, in a move widely
regarded as a praiseworthy precedent, re
cently held a program with the GLAS
Speaker's Bureau.
Lambda Delta Lambda members have met
with mixed reactions from the UCLA com
munity. Laura the UCLA sorority
advisor, was quoted in the Los Angeles
Times last Wednesday as saying she admires
their "courage" in publicly revealing their
sexual orientation.
"Most sororities were formed in a need
to support each other in their goals and
aspirations and this is no different,"
said.
However, a few sororities voiced opposi
tion to the idea. "They are trying to make
spectacles of themselves. It's obnoxious,"
the rush chair Of one UCLA sorority told
the Times.
