Panamanian strike begins
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Stores, banks
and businesses closed progressively through
out the day yesterday as a general strike called
by opponents of military strongman Manuel
Noriega proved partially effective in shutting
down commerce in the capital city.
The military-backed administration of new
civilian President Manuel Soiis Palma recog
nized that the strike was having some impact.
In a brief interview, Solis estimated that "60
percent of businesses are functioning and all
transportation."
Some Western diplomats put the effective
ness of the strike as high as 75 percent, al
though to reporters circulating through the
city, that figure seemed high.
Organizers of the one-day strike appeared
pleased. "It started out slowly, but we're very
encouraged. Considering that today is payday
it was much better than expected," said strike
organizer Roberto Brenes.
Mecham boycotts trial opening
PHOENIX, Ariz. — A defiant Gov. Evan
Mecham boycotted his own impeachment trial
yesterday as the country's first such proceed
ing in 56 years opened without fanfare.
The 63-year-old conservative Republican ap
peared calm and in good humor at a press
conference he called while the Arizona Senate
was spending the day slogging through various

defense motions.
"If I receive a fair trial, the
truth will prevail and I will be
acquitted of all charges," Mec
ham declared from the offices
he calls his "government in
exile," 40 minutes from the
Capitol.
Mecham is accused of "high
crimes, misdemeanors or mal
feasance in office" in the 23

articles of impeachment the Arizona House of
Representatives approved three weeks ago.
Specifically, the first-term governor is ac
cused of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan,
misusing $80,000 from the state protocol fund
by lending it to his auto dealership, and
obstructing justice by trying to thwart an in
vestigation of an alleged death threat by a
state official against a grand jury witness.
Aquino gov't contacts Marcos
MANILA, Philippines — Philippine Presi
dent Coraeon Aquino confirmed yesterday that
she sent two official emissaries to visit Fer
dinand Marcos at his home-in-exile in Hawaii
recently in what appears to be the first warm
ing of relations between Aquino and the au
thoritarian ruler whom she helped overthrow
two years ago.
However, Aquino has maintained that
Marcos cannot come home until her country
stabilizes and he repays the billions of dollars
that her government claims he stole from the
country while president. She made it clear
that the time is still not right for her govern
ment to grant Marcos' standing request to
return to the Philippines.
