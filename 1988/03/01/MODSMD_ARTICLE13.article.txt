# Tutu arrested during protest march

### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
dozens of other South African religious
leaders were arrested in Cape Town yes
terday as they attempted to march to Par
liament to protest the government's latest
ban on anti-apartheid activities.
The church leaders, with gold crosses
around their necks and Bibles in their
hands, were taken away by security police
as they left St. George's Anglican Cathedral
on a 150-yard procession toward Parlia
ment, where they had planned to present
a petition against the government action
and to pray for peace.
Altogether, about 150 people, mostly
priests and nuns, were arrested and taken
to police headquarters, where they were
released on their own recognizance pending
"investigation" of formal charges. Those
could include participation in an illegal
demonstration and various other violations
of the country's security laws and emer
gency regulations.
"We have been merely obeying God by
marching to Parliament," Tutu said later.
"What we did was not a negative action.

It was a positive way of obeying God. We
have committed ourselves. We are going
to be with our people where it hurts. .. .
If in our witness to Jesus Christ, we are
arrested, well, that's hard luck. But we
must obey God rather than man."
The incident stemmed from government
action last week effectively outlawing the
political activities of 18 groups, including
the United Democratic Front, a coalition
of 750 anti-apartheid groups with 3 million
members, and the 1 million-member
Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the nation's largest labor federation.
Also taken into custody were several
reporters, news photographers and televi
sion crews. They were questioned and
released pending criminal charges under
emergency regulations that prohibit first
hand coverage of political disturbances. The
wife of the Canadian ambassador was
detained briefly, and several European
diplomats present as observers complained
that they were manhandled and bruised
by riot police, who apparently mistook
them for journalists.
