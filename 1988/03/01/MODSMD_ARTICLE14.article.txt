# Jordan shifts PLO policy
## 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan — Jordan will no
longer press for a joint Jordanian-
Palestinian delegation for any new Middle
East peace talky and will support a separate
Palestine Liberation Organization seat at
the table, sources familiar with King Hus
sein's thinking said here yesterday.
The Jordanian position, conveyed to
reporters accompanying Secretary of State
George Shultz, seems certain to complicate
Shultz's task of finding a basis for peace
talks mutually acceptable to Israel and the
Arabs.
The PLO has already told Jordan that
it no longer has any interest in a joint
delegation in the wake of three months of
violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
Israel has refused to negotiate with the
PLO. The U.S. government is forbidden

by law to have contacts with PLO repre
sentatives until the organization renounces
terrorism and recognizes Israel.
U.S. officials have been assuming that
any Palestinians participating in new ne
gotiations would be part of a joint delega
tion with Jordan and would include indi
viduals approved by the PLO.
An aide to Shultz said such a delegation
had "always been part of the concept" of
a new peace conference and said "it's not
an issue." But he would not say whether
he thought Jordan would be willing to
press the PLO to join a joint delegation.
The Jordanian sources made clear yes
terday that the Arab position generally has
hardened in the wake of the uprising in
the occupied territories.
