# Supreme Court to rule on federal drug tests
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Agreeing to
hear a key challenge to the
Reagan administration's anti
drug plans, the Supreme Court
said yesterday that it would decide
whether federal officials may re
quire employees to be tested for
drugs.
A ruling in the case will deter
mine whether government offi
cials, policeofTicers, air traffic con
trollers, railroad engineers, school
teachers and other employees of
government agencies or govern
ment-regulated industries may be
forced to undergo drug testing.
However, the outcome will have
no direct bearing on employees in
private companies, many of which
also require their employees to be
tested for drugs.

The Fourth Amendment bans
"unreasonable searches and
seizures" by the government, and
the National Treasury Employees
Union contends that the required
urine testing of Customs Service
workers is unreasonable as well
as "demeaning, humiliating and
offensive." Attorneys for the un
ion argue that the government
can test an employee only when
it has evidence that an individual
uses drugs.
But a federal appeals court in
New Orleans disagreed last year,
ruling that it is reasonable for
the government to set especially
strict standards for employees
charged with stopping the flow of
drugs into the United States.
