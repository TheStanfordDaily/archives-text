Panama, even though he has denounced
the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega for
deposing Panama's civilian president

Officials said that Reagan has decided
to declare that Panama is not cooperat
ing with U.S. efforts to fight the drug
trade, in view of Noriega's indictment

last month for allegedly turning his
country into a financial base of conven
ience for cocaine barons of neighboring
Colombia.
But after a day of meetings at the
White House and the State Department,
Reagan decided only to reaffirm those
sanctions against Panama that are al
ready in place, not to impose any new
measures.
"We couldn't get our heads together
on anything new," said a senior official
who participated in the discussions. "We
may come to it later, but there wasn't
any general agreement on what will help
solve Panama's problems."
