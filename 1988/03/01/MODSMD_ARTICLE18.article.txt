## Integrity missing 
### 
THE PARTY'S OVER for
Senior Hoover Fellow Ed
ward Teller.
The results of a three-month
long investigation show gross ir
responsibility on the part of Teller
and others involved in the devel
opment of the Strategic Defense
Initiative's X-ray laser system.
The investigation, done by the
General Accounting Office, has
found that Teller embellished
reports on the system's feasibility.
And despite the fact that he had
little to no contact with actual re
search for the X-ray laser, Teller
argues he wasn't bound to talk to
scientists familiar with the re
search before pushing the program
to government officials.
Also alarming is Teller's flagrant
abuse of his accountability to the
public and to the Reagan admin
istration. And President Reagan
must explain why he was satisfied
to maintain contact with only one
personal friend about the laser re
search.
But the burden of responsibility
does not rest solely on the
shoulders' of these two men. Along
the way it has become obvious that
key individuals with the opportu
nity — or rather responsibility —
to correct Teller's error declined
to do so.
Although Teller alone supplied
Reagan false information, which
was used at Reykjavik last year to
push the SDI program, a support
ing cast at Lawrence Livermore
Laboratories and UC-Berkeley
helped Teller undermine the
country's national security.

Livermore Director Roger Batzel
initially stifled former Head of Nu
clear Programs Roy Woodruffs
complaints that Teller overes
timated the applicability of the
laser system. However, today Bat
zel argues that the legitimacy of
Woodruff's complaints did not rest
on laboratory support.
Although Berkeley is responsible
for overseeing the laboratories,
William Frazer, Berkeley's vice
president for academic affairs, was
not concerned about Woodruff's
complaint. Instead, Frazer said he
wanted to protect the freedom of
speech of laboratoiy scientists.
The fact that no one took action
to report on the actual status of
the laser system should enrage
every taxpayer whose millions fund
research for the iaser and SDI in
general.
It should also enrage every cit
izen who expects accountability
from those people who affect the
country's national security.
It further calls into question the
future of the SDI program, which
apparently depends on lies and
coercion to maintain the support
of the government.
For Batzel, Wood, Teller and of
ficials from Berkeley, it would have
been easier to listen to Woodruff
earlier when he tried to tactfully
resolve the problem without the
public disgrace they are now
facing.
Instead, this one leak creates
suspicion about all SDI research
and the pictures painted by scien
tists for an unsuspecting public
and president.
