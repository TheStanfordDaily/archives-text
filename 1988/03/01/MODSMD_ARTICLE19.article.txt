## Intellectual perspective needed in culture debate 
### 
THE FACULTY SENATE debate
over Western Culture reveals
considerable confusion about the
nature of culture itself.
In organic growth there is always a
vital balance between the fixed and the
variable. This is clearly the case with
genes; to an enormous extent they are
"canonic," given, passed on. Heredity is
"half the battle" of life. In plants,
there is (at a higher level of analogy) a
trunk, along with a freer play of
branches. This is repeated in the
spinal development of animals. Human
evolution is likewise stubbornly cen
tered on given forms. When you open
a person up, regardless of race, he or
she looks almost the same inside.

So it is with culture. Language, as
Saussure observes and Chomsky alter
him, is based on persistent givens
"underneath." Literature, until quite
recent times, as Zumthor notes, was
almost entirely conventional, imitative.
And so were the other arts; music kept
its octave structure, its tonality,
throughout, even into the exquisite
subtleties of Debussy or Ravel.
In all the arts, the most wonderful,
original, fresh creations — Brahms,
Proust, Mallarm6, Rimbaud,
Stravinsky, Rilke — maintain a bal
ance between the ongoing architecture
within and the new changes run on it
without. Violate that balance and you
get the one-sided rut, the predictabil-

ity, cacophony and boredom of atonal
music, the emptiness of "free form"
generally, the debacle of modern Amer
ican education, which the President of
IBM recently called "our disgrace."
It is precisely because French culture
was so classic that it became, as
Churchill gallantly admitted, the "semi
nal culture of the West." Cezanne
copied Rubens for endless hours in the
Louvre. Debussy went through the
paces of a staid Conservatory. French
education was disciplined, traditionalist
— until recent generations, when the
headlines of the magazines lament the
passing of the great, unreplaced.
Whatever changes in the Western
"canon" Asians, blacks, etc. will bring

about will occur over considerable
reaches of time, organically. The stand
ards for admission are rigorous, time
tested in a tough open market of ideas.
What an institution can do about it
under political pressure will constitute
a kind of tinkering at best.
The most promising way to go is to
remain with the proven excellence and
invite the talented members of all
races to join in the process of renew
ing it if you can. Meanwhile, the jock
eying for position in the shorter-range
culture can go on zestfully. And a
modern university ought to teach that
as well, on top of the great tradition.
