# Development isn't needed in Foothills
## 
### 
After last year's fiasco concerning
the proposal to locate the Reagan Li
brary in the Foothills behind Stanford,
the Stanford Planning Office decided to
develop a comprehensive plan for this
area.
A working group was formed to
decide the future of the Foothills. Its
goals were to keep the land available
for academic use while at the same
time preserving environmental quality.
The group fulfilled its first objective
vepr well, but its plan leaves some
thing to be desired concerning the
second.
The resulting Foothills region plan is
praiseworthy to a limited degree. It
pinpoints certain academic uses for
which the working group found the
Foothills area to be well-suited and
outlines ways in which any future
development should be regulated and
controlled.

It designates certain areas as more
sensitive than others, due either to
their ecological sensitivity or their vis
ual sensitivity. And the plan recom
mends that the rest of the region be
developed before any development is
considered in these areas.
In addition, the writers of the Foot
hills region plan stress the desirability
of blending any new development with
the existing environment by keeping
the buildings low and unobtrusive and
replanting around them to match the
original vegetation.
However, the basic problem with the
plan is its underlying assumption that
Stanford needs to develop its Foothills.
Actually, there really are no compelling
reasons for most of the proposed aca
demic facilities to be located in the
Foothills.
The most reasonable proposal is that
an additional astronomy observatory, if
it should be needed, also be located in
the Foothills. Since an observatory
needs to be as far as possible from
artificial lights, placing another one in
the Foothills — instead of in the main
part of campus — makes sense.

Another idea, to allow the golf
course to expand, also is appropriate
for this area. A third possible type of
development is the construction of
"think tanks" whether privately
operated or run by Stanford. There are
already two such privately operated
facilities near the golf course club
house.
The rationale for placing these re
search facilities in the Foothills is that
they require the "quiet" atmosphere
there. Quiet compared to what? The
noisy hustle and bustle of the main
campus?
Anyone can go inside any office on
our peaceful campus, shut the door,
unplug the phone and have all the
quiet they need. In a similar vein, the
plan to locate art studios near the
observatory is also unnecessary. They
can just as easily remain in the West
Campus.
The most disturbing component of
the Foothills region plan is that, while
it recognizes the desirability of protec
ting the most enviromentally sensitive
areas of the Foothills, it does not
prevent development from occurring

anywhere in the entire region.
The plan acknowledges that the
Bowl is one of the most important and
most fragile areas in the Foothills
region. However, as it makes clear, the
University reserves the right to locate
academic programs within the Bowl.
The Foothills region is a valuable
resource just as it is. Tight in the
middle of Silicon Valley, surrounded by
extensive development, it is the one
place to get away from civilization for
a little while. On any given day, hun
dreds of people go to the Foothills to
run, bike, walk or simply sit and ad
mire the view.
Any new development, no matter
how carefully it is done, will have a
detrimental effect on the ei\joyment
that so many people derive from this
unique area.
Until someone can give me some
better reasons for developing this
region, I suggest that a Ini-go part, if
not all, of the Foothills be left as they
fire
