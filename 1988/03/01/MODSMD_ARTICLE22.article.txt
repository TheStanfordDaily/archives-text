## Shorten the core list 
### 
FINALLY, THIS WEEK the Faculty
Senate is likely to vote on whether
or not to adopt changes in the West
ern Culture requirement and rumor has
it that the new Cultures, Ideas and
Values track will be approved.
Whatever decision is made, it will not
bring more than a temporary respite to
the debate. Neither of the proposals now
being considered by the senate — English
Prof. William Chace's modified core list
or CIV — will adequately satisfy the goals
of faculty and student groups on the
different sides of the issue. And worse,
both are compromises that will result in
creating an unacceptably broad and
mediocre course.
At the heart of the Western Culture
debate has been a fundamental difference
in opinion about the purpose of having
such a course. One noted professor who
has supported CIV believes the reasons
for having the Area One requirement are
to give freshman a common learning ex
perience and to teach them to read, think
about and write on esteemed books in a
critical manner.
Therefore, he argues, what books are
read in this course are not as important
as how they are taught.
From this vantage point then it
naturally makes more sense to read more
works by women and peoples of color. It
would make the classroom a more com
fortable place for many freshman, as well
as entice young bright faculty members
with Third World and feminist specializa
tions to teach.
By contrast, the critics of CIV have a
more substantive and inflexible interpre
tation of the goals behind the require

ment. They see the books themselves as
part of the educational purpose of the
course.
Most CIV opponents believe it is crucial
for students to have read the works
termed "classic" by our society if they
are to carry on a dialogue (negative or
positive) with the rest of educated
America (not to mention if we are to
understand all the clues to The New York
Times crossword puzzle).
For example, how can you understand
or refute Allan Bloom if you haven't read
Hegel? How can you know that 64 Down,
"Jason's ship," is the Argo if you haven't
read Greek mythology?
A further goal of the requirement
would be to push students to come to
terms with the mayor political and ideo
logical forces that have affected their
lives. Only armed with this knowledge
will students be able to choose to glorify
or reject and effectively use what is their
history.
The value of such knowledge has been
illustrated time and again by, ironically,
the students protesting against the core
list — the dialectics of Locke and Marx
reverberate through most of their
speeches.
Now, it is possible to fullfill the de
mands of persons on both sides of the
debate, but it will not happen with such
a facile compromise as the CIV track, or
by simply adding more books to the cur
rent core list as Chace suggests. What is
necessary is revisions in both the Western
Culture and Non-Western Culture tracks.
The core list should be cut instead of
increased. Currently too many books are
packed into too short a space, and stu

dents are unable to give any author a
just period of contemplation. If the the
Chace proposal is adopted, time pressure
could only increase. Area One would be
come known as the McDonald's of ideas:
high speed, low quality.
Since the paring down of the core list
could result in an even higher percentage
of writings by white male authors then
there are now, the Univesity should in
stitute a mandatory one quarter course
on ideas and trends from Africa, Asia or
Latin America to balance this Eurocen
tric focus.
This would allow students to have a
better perspective on the strengths and
flaws of their own civilization. An added
advantage of this sort of structure is that
other cultures need not be judged in our
own chauvinistic terms (i.e. how well they
write novels, an essentially Western form
until modernity). More time could be
spent learning about their highest artistic
methods of expression — poetry, dance,
storytelling, music, etc.
Squashing too much into one year
won't do anyone any good. On the other
hand, with a little creativity and com
mitment to undergraduate education on
the part of the administration, this
debate could be resolved for good.
