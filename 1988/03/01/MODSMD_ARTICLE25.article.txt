# Much Ado About Western View
## 
### WOODY WEST 
It would require a wicked satirist, one imagines, to
concoct such a scene: 500 students at a distin
guished college, joined by a candidate for the
presidency of the United States, protest against a
required freshman course, chanting, "Hey hey. ho
ho. Western culture's got to go."
Well, these days satire has got to stretch to
exceed reality, and a year ago a demonstration took place at
Stanford University, the Rev. Jesse Jackson participating, to
get a required course on Western literature and philosophy
replaced by one that, instead, emphasized non-European
cultures and "works by women, minonties and persons of
color." And, yes. they chanted, "Hey hey, ho ho. Western
culture's got to go."
In assailing the entirety of Western culture, the 1980s
model protesters arc more exuberantly presumptuous than
their ideological prototypes of the 19605. A good many of
those predecessors, of course, arc now among the faculty on
campuses across the country. At Stanford they arc cheering
the continued protest against the required freshman course
that was reinstituted in 1980 and built around the books that
articulate the central ideas of Western civilization: personal
liberty, human dignity, civic virtue The reading list was to
redress an astonishing ignorance about the genesis and genius
of Western culture. But the countervailing argument, that
Western culture is a pallid lens to interpret a diverse world,
has passionate advocates.

Faculty there who fidgeted under the presumed constraints
of the Western tradition found allies among younger academi
cians and. certainly, among the sons and daughters of the
middle class, frantic to demonstrate their socioeconomic
sensitivity by a repudiation of their parents and their tradition;
this grouping is reinforced by the fact of a minority enrollment
at Stanford that is about one-third of the student population
Why is a Western cultural orientation, one that defines
this society, so repellent to them'.' Paul Seaver, a Stanford
history professor and head of the special group that recom
mended the course change, piously says, "We cannot keep
a core list (of required books) as central to our enterprise
when it has become symbolic not of shared culture but of
cultural exclusiveness." Some of the campus "activists" ex
press their repugnance more bluntly, contending that the
Western culture requirement is a "yearlong course in racism."
Racism? Obviously — Plato, Shakespeare, Dante. John
Stuart Mill, those guys arc white males, as arc most of the
names on the required list Racist by definition, right? —
and probably sexist and ethnocentric as well. Pass the aspirin.
How depressing that such nonsense is evidently being
taken seriously again on campus. And. once again, too many
faculty arc endorsing fatuous opinions so as not to provoke
their wise fools. The faculty senate at Stanford has two
meetings scheduled this month and may vote on the recom
mended course change Feb 18. There is opposition, but the
vote looks like a done deal.
Only an aardvark would deny the value, the necessity, of
studying other cultures. But the resources for the study of
other cultures arc profusely available at Stanford, as well as
"works by women, minorities and persons of color." And to
diminish one's own civilization, which uniquely in recorded
history has postulated respect for individual dignity and ave
nue for opportunity, amounts to a kind of intellectual treason
To understand the particular, resonant grace of Western
culture, its rigorous commitment to a rational social order,
is one of the few antidotes against the coarseness, the casual
nihilism and the rootlessness that afflict so marjy of the
young, the chaotic indiscipline that poisons an open society.
The main thing to realize about the Stanford fuss is that
it is essentially a political controversy. In the same fashion
that those on the left labor to sell the notion of moral equiv
alence between the United States and the Soviet Union, so
there is an analogous effort to denigrate Western tradition by
portraying it merely as one of the globe's diverse cultures,
any one of which is as meritorious as any other This is
relativism carried to unholy conclusion.

Mind" anatomizes our estrangement from the

reflection \*ith forceful eloquence — "America

Well, these days satire has got to stretch to
exceed reality, and a year ago a demonstration took place at
Stanford University, the Rev. Jesse Jackson participating, to
get a required course on Western literature and philosophy
replaced by one that, instead, emphasized non-European
cultures and "works by women, minonties and persons of
color." And, yes. they chanted, "Hey hey, ho ho. Western
culture's got to go."
In assailing the entirety of Western culture, the 1980s
model protesters arc more exuberantly presumptuous than
their ideological prototypes of the 19605. A good many of
those predecessors, of course, arc now among the faculty on
campuses across the country. At Stanford they arc cheering
the continued protest against the required freshman course
that was reinstituted in 1980 and built around the books that
articulate the central ideas of Western civilization: personal
liberty, human dignity, civic virtue The reading list was to
redress an astonishing ignorance about the genesis and genius
of Western culture. But the countervailing argument, that
Western culture is a pallid lens to interpret a diverse world,
has passionate advocates.

Faculty there who fidgeted under the presumed constraints
of the Western tradition found allies among younger academi
cians and. certainly, among the sons and daughters of the
middle class, frantic to demonstrate their socioeconomic
sensitivity by a repudiation of their parents and their tradition;
this grouping is reinforced by the fact of a minority enrollment
at Stanford that is about one-third of the student population
Why is a Western cultural orientation, one that defines
this society, so repellent to them'.' Paul Seaver, a Stanford
history professor and head of the special group that recom
mended the course change, piously says, "We cannot keep
a core list (of required books) as central to our enterprise
when it has become symbolic not of shared culture but of
cultural exclusiveness." Some of the campus "activists" ex
press their repugnance more bluntly, contending that the
Western culture requirement is a "yearlong course in racism."
Racism? Obviously — Plato, Shakespeare, Dante. John
Stuart Mill, those guys arc white males, as arc most of the
names on the required list Racist by definition, right? —
and probably sexist and ethnocentric as well. Pass the aspirin.
How depressing that such nonsense is evidently being
taken seriously again on campus. And. once again, too many
faculty arc endorsing fatuous opinions so as not to provoke
their wise fools. The faculty senate at Stanford has two
meetings scheduled this month and may vote on the recom
mended course change Feb 18. There is opposition, but the
vote looks like a done deal.
Only an aardvark would deny the value, the necessity, of
studying other cultures. But the resources for the study of
other cultures arc profusely available at Stanford, as well as
"works by women, minorities and persons of color." And to
diminish one's own civilization, which uniquely in recorded
history has postulated respect for individual dignity and ave
nue for opportunity, amounts to a kind of intellectual treason
To understand the particular, resonant grace of Western
culture, its rigorous commitment to a rational social order,
is one of the few antidotes against the coarseness, the casual
nihilism and the rootlessness that afflict so marjy of the
young, the chaotic indiscipline that poisons an open society.
The main thing to realize about the Stanford fuss is that
it is essentially a political controversy. In the same fashion
that those on the left labor to sell the notion of moral equiv
alence between the United States and the Soviet Union, so
there is an analogous effort to denigrate Western tradition by
portraying it merely as one of the globe's diverse cultures,
any one of which is as meritorious as any other This is
relativism carried to unholy conclusion.
Allan Bk*»m. the University of Chicago philosopher

whose book "The Closing of the American
Mind" anatomizes our estrangement from the
West's glorious intellectual heritage, puts the case
lor Western culture and its American political
reflection \*ith forceful eloquence — "America
tells one story the unbroken, ineluctable progress
ot freedom and equality" You'd hope a majority
of the Stanford fatuity senate might grasp that,
wouldn't you?
