## SJSU gives Card a Six-Pac break 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
After a spar
kling Pacific 10
Southern Divi
sion opening,
the No. 3 Stan
ford Cardinal
returns to non-

conference play today as it
tunes up for this weekend's se
ries with UCLA. The Cardinal,
13-5 on the year and 2-0 in
the Six-Pac after beating USC
twice last weekend, hosts San
Jose State (10-9) at 2 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinal, ranked third
nationally in the Baseball
America poll • and fourth by
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, will
send freshman Stan Spencer to
the mound as it seeks to extend
its winning streak to nine
games.
Spencer, 3-1 with a 2.33
ERA, was scheduled to start
the third game of the series at
USC Sunday, but the game was
postponed because of rain.
Weather permitting, the Van
couver, Wash., native will make
his Six-Pac debut Sunday
against UCLA.
"We'll put a limit on his
pitches (today)," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "It
will be a workout for him."
Marquess said Spencer will
probably go five or six innings,
with junior Brian Keyser likely

to see action in relief.
The third game of the USC
series will be made up at USC
on April 18, the day after Stan
ford's three-game series at
UCLA.
The rescheduling, which will
force both teams to play four
games in four days, probably
favors the Cardinal because of
its pitching depth. The Trojans
are still looking for a depend
able third starter, while Stan
ford already has three strong
starters — senior Lee Plemel
and freshmen Mike Mussina
and Spencer — and will have
a fourth when Keyser has fully
recovered from the elbow in
jury he suffered just before the
beginning of the season.
In other Six-Pac action last
weekend, California pulled off
a surprising three-game sweep
of then-second-ranked Arizona
State at Tempe, Ariz. The
Golden Bears beat the Sun
Devils 10-3 Friday, 4-3 Satur
day, and 2-1 Sunday. In the
other series, at UCLA, Arizona
and the Bruins split two and
had their third game rained
out. That leaves California in
first place in the Six-Pac, with
the Cardinal a half-game back.
The Cardinal will host the
Bruins, 12-6 overall and 2-3 in
the Six-Pac, this weekend at
Sunken Diamond, with games
at 2 p.m. Friday, 11 a.m. Sat
urday and 1 p.m. Sunday. The
Saturday game will be broad
cast live by ESPN.
