# Former RA fights to save Roble
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
A 1987 Stanford graduate and former
Roble Hall resident assistant has started
a fund-raising drive to convince the Uni
versity's trustees to renovate the
campus landmark rather than tear it
down.
Jack Alden, an RAin Roble from
1985 through 1987, said the University
does not realize the great enthusiasm
that former Roble residents and other
alumni have for renovating the second
oldest dormitory on campus.
Roble was one of the most popular
dorms on campus until it was shut down
in December after being judged seismi
cally unsafe. The University is currently
evaluating the cost of either restoring
Roble or building a new dorm. A deci
sion is expected sometime this spring.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Nor
man Robinson said the fund drive "is
a nice idea," but that it probably won't
have much effect on the trustees' deci
sion.
Robinson added that he "knows from
experience how difficult it is to raise
funds to build new buildings, much less
to restore old ones."
Like Alden, Robinson agreed that

many alumni would like to see Roble
saved. But he stressed that any decision
on the matter will depend on the final
cost analysis.
According to Alden, the University is
planning to make a decision about
Roble's future before deciding how to
pay for the costs of restoration or for
new housing.
Speculating that the University may
build new dorms modeled after Gover
nor's Corner, Alden said "I don't think
they'll be able to duplicate Roble."
He said that if students and alumni
are able to communicate their support
for Roble through a pledge drive, the
University will be more likely to decide
in favor of restoring the dorm.
In addition, Alden said that if the
cost of improving Roble is more expen
sive than totally rebuilding it, a fund
drive which promises to cover the ad
ditional expense of restoration may per
suade the University not to tear it down.
Alden said he has sent out informa
tion about the fund drive to about 80
Stanford Alumni Association Clubs in
the United States.
He said that since he just mailed the
information recently, he is "not really
sure" what the response will be.
Alden, currently in graduate school
at Duke University, said he was at Stan

ford when Roble was closed. "I got a
lot of favorable feedback that people
would like to restore Roble, and that
they would like to help out," he said.
Alden said he estimates there are
about 18,000 former Roble residents
who might contribute, as well as many
more non-Roble alumni who might also
be interested.
"There really isn't another dorm like
Roble," according to Alden. "There was
an amazing sense of community that
people would like to continue."
Roble was built in 1918. The outer
walls of the building contain hollow clay
tiles, which will not support it in the
event of a major earthquake.
After conducting a seismic survey of
campus buildings during fall quarter,
the University decided to evacuate
Roble's 294 residents and close the
dorm for an indefinite period of time.
