# Hagey calm after the storm
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Welcome to the
Waiting Game,
brought to you by
Stanford, Arizona
State and some
rather untimely
rain.

In a match that seemingly was
never going to end, the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team
finished off No. 16 ASU 5-1 yes
terday at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium to raise its record to 10-
0.

Yesterday's action was the con
tinuation of a match that was in
terrupted by rain Saturday. The
Cardinal was on the verge of send
ing ASU back to Tempe on the
early flight yesterday, when out
of the blue the gray storm clouds
opened up just in time to tempo
rarily rescue the Sun Devils.
With Stanford ahead 4-1 and
senior Cari Hagey leading ASU's
Lisa Haldas 5-3 in the third set
of the No. 6 singles, a steady rain
began to fall onto the courts.
Hagey was leading Haldas 3-0
in the ninth game and had four
match points to work with. But

she played cautiously in the rain
trying to protect her left knee and
squandered each of the match
points. With the score 5-4, the
match was immediately stopped
and the waiting game began.
The rain ceased shortly there
after, but it took a whole slew of
players, coaches and coaches'
wives over a half-hour to dry the
courts with squeegees, and the
whole time Hagey could only
reflect on how she had been un
able to put Haldas away. "It was
pretty much a nightmare at first,
but I had to laugh," she said.
Hagey ended the nightmare
quickly when the match started
up again. It took her just two
minutes to win the next game and
post a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory that
clinched the team win at last. The
doubles were not played.
Hagey said she remained posi
tive despite having let Haldas
back into the match. "I really
hadn't thought about losing," she
said. "I was just mad I hadn't
won yet."
"That could have gone down as
folklore," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said, referring to the
possibility that Haldas might have
recovered miraculously to win the
No. 6 singles, and then the Sun
Devils might have swept the
doubles.
"This was a big win for Cari,"
Brennan added. "She hasn't had
very many opportunities in
singles."
While Hagey's two-minute ap
pearance ended the day for the
Cardinal, freshman Tami Whit
linger began the afternoon with
a six-minute stint on court one.
Whitlinger led ASU's Laura Glitz

6-2, 4-0 when their match was
resumed yesterday, and her day's
work consisted of two quick
games.
Whitlinger's 6-2, 6-0 score was
similar to the marks posted by
Stanford's last No. 1 singles
player, two-time NCAA singles
champion Patty Fendick. But
Whitlinger is downplaying any
comparisons to Fendick, despite
the fact that she is 7-1 in dual
matches this season and has won
in straight sets in each of her
seven victories.
"I try not to think about it,"
Whitlinger said. "It wouldn't be
fair to start comparing myself to
her, me being a freshman. We're
totally different players."
Whitlinger's twin sister, Teri,
and sophomore Lisa Green also
posted straight-set victories yes
terday. Teri remains undefeated
in dual-match play with a 6-3, 6-1
win over ASU's Kristi Jonkosky
in the No. 3 singles, and Green
bested Jennifer Rojohn 7-5, 6-3
in the No. 2 contest.
The Sun Devils got on the board
when Karen Bergan swept soph
omore Valerie Wilson 6-2, 6-1 in
the No. 5 singles.
With the team score 3-1 and
Hagey in the middle of a very
close contest on court six, senior
Kay Tittle needed to win the third
set of the No. 4 singles to give
the Cardinal some breathing
room. Tittle responded with a
sparkling third set against Paula
Conte to record a 6-1, 2-6, 6-0
victory.
The Cardinal next takes its per
fect record and No. 1 ranking to
Madison, Wis., for the national
indoors Thursday through Sun
day.

Patiently braving the Intermittent rainfall yesterday, senior Carl
Hagey wrapped up the 5-1 win for the top-ranked Stanford women's
tennis team over Arizona State.
Welcome to the
Waiting Game,
brought to you by
Stanford, Arizona
State and some
rather untimely
rain.

In a match that seemingly was
never going to end, the top-ranked
Stanford women's tennis team
finished off No. 16 ASU 5-1 yes
terday at the Stanford Tennis
Stadium to raise its record to 10-
0.

Yesterday's action was the con
tinuation of a match that was in
terrupted by rain Saturday. The
Cardinal was on the verge of send
ing ASU back to Tempe on the
early flight yesterday, when out
of the blue the gray storm clouds
opened up just in time to tempo
rarily rescue the Sun Devils.
With Stanford ahead 4-1 and
senior Cari Hagey leading ASU's
Lisa Haldas 5-3 in the third set
of the No. 6 singles, a steady rain
began to fall onto the courts.
Hagey was leading Haldas 3-0
in the ninth game and had four
match points to work with. But

she played cautiously in the rain
trying to protect her left knee and
squandered each of the match
points. With the score 5-4, the
match was immediately stopped
and the waiting game began.
The rain ceased shortly there
after, but it took a whole slew of
players, coaches and coaches'
wives over a half-hour to dry the
courts with squeegees, and the
whole time Hagey could only
reflect on how she had been un
able to put Haldas away. "It was
pretty much a nightmare at first,
but I had to laugh," she said.
Hagey ended the nightmare
quickly when the match started
up again. It took her just two
minutes to win the next game and
post a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory that
clinched the team win at last. The
doubles were not played.
Hagey said she remained posi
tive despite having let Haldas
back into the match. "I really
hadn't thought about losing," she
said. "I was just mad I hadn't
won yet."
"That could have gone down as
folklore," Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said, referring to the
possibility that Haldas might have
recovered miraculously to win the
No. 6 singles, and then the Sun
Devils might have swept the
doubles.
"This was a big win for Cari,"
Brennan added. "She hasn't had
very many opportunities in
singles."
While Hagey's two-minute ap
pearance ended the day for the
Cardinal, freshman Tami Whit
linger began the afternoon with
a six-minute stint on court one.
Whitlinger led ASU's Laura Glitz

6-2, 4-0 when their match was
resumed yesterday, and her day's
work consisted of two quick
games.
Whitlinger's 6-2, 6-0 score was
similar to the marks posted by
Stanford's last No. 1 singles
player, two-time NCAA singles
champion Patty Fendick. But
Whitlinger is downplaying any
comparisons to Fendick, despite
the fact that she is 7-1 in dual
matches this season and has won
in straight sets in each of her
seven victories.
"I try not to think about it,"
Whitlinger said. "It wouldn't be
fair to start comparing myself to
her, me being a freshman. We're
totally different players."
Whitlinger's twin sister, Teri,
and sophomore Lisa Green also
posted straight-set victories yes
terday. Teri remains undefeated
in dual-match play with a 6-3, 6-1
win over ASU's Kristi Jonkosky
in the No. 3 singles, and Green
bested Jennifer Rojohn 7-5, 6-3
in the No. 2 contest.
The Sun Devils got on the board
when Karen Bergan swept soph
omore Valerie Wilson 6-2, 6-1 in
the No. 5 singles.
With the team score 3-1 and
Hagey in the middle of a very
close contest on court six, senior
Kay Tittle needed to win the third
set of the No. 4 singles to give
the Cardinal some breathing
room. Tittle responded with a
sparkling third set against Paula
Conte to record a 6-1, 2-6, 6-0
victory.

fect record and No. 1 ranking to
Madison, Wis., for the national
