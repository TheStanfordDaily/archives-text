# An insider's insights on Stanford basketball
## 
### 
It's the biggest game in a season of
"Big" games, but the Stanford basketball
players are relaxed as they eat their pre
game breakfast at Mac Arthur Park.
Oregon State is in town for a critical
Pacific 10 Conference matchup, but jokes
about senior center Greg Butler's last
home game dominate the conversation.
There is speculation that Butler will
never eat at Mac Arthur Park again once
he has to pay for his food.

The team always eats at Mac Arthur
Park five hours before home games. Par
ticularly on weekends when games are
in the early afternoon, the coaches like

to get the players up and moving and in
a basketball frame of mind.
There isn't much talk about basketball,
but the breakfast brings the team to
gether for the first time on a game day
that will not end until nearly eight hours
later.
When the players arrive for their 11
a.m. shoot-around, the members of the
Raycom TV crew are shooting baskets in
an empty Maples Pavilion. It's still four
hours until game time, but the Stanford
players change into practice garb for 40
minutes of free shooting, spot shooting
and walking through plays.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery puts
the starters on defense and runs the
scout team through Oregon State's of
fensive patterns, but only so much prep
aration can be done. Oregon State Coach
Ralph Miller, who has won more games
than any other active college coach, gives
his teams a lot of freedom on the floor,
which makes the Beavers very unpredict
able.
After the light workout, junior Todd
Lichti and freshman Andrew Vlahov stay

for some extra shooting, and several
players who are unlikely to see action
stay to help the coaches with an hour
long youth basketball clinic. Montgomery
tells the rest to be dressed and ready to
go in the locker room at 1:50 p.m., an
hour and a quarter before tip-off.
The players fUter back into Maples
around 1:30, and Oregon State arrives
at 1:40. Music blares in the Stanford
locker room, and DePaul is blowing out
Miami (Fla.) on the players' lounge tele
vision as they get dressed and have their
ankles taped.
At 1:50 the locker room gets quiet, and
word is given that Montgomery will begin
his pre-game talk at 2:23. Junior Howard
Wright dons headphones, Lichti goes over
OSU's Pac-10 stats, junior Terry Taylor
applies heat pads to his thighs and Vlahov
reads. Everyone stretches and several
players dribble basketballs on the carpet.
Montgomery enters the locker room at
2:26, and the players gather around him.
He talks about offensive and defensive
keys and about giving the home fans a
good show.

"Let's just wear them down in the
color," Montgomery says of the smaller
Beavers. "Let's just own the boards. Let's
play our game at our place."
Noise is building outside on the court,
and when the players take the floor half
an hour before game time the Stanford
Band is rocking and the crowd is excited.
Stanford returns to the locker room
10 minutes before the tip-off for some %
last words from Montgomery. He goes
over the matchups and then talks about
stopping the Beavers' electrifying point
guard, Gary Payton, a key to the game.
The players then kneel in a circle on
the floor for a moment of silence before
heading back into the cacophony of
Maples. As they file out of the locker
room, they high-five junior Bryan
McSweeney's little brother and receive
pats on the back from University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, who is standing
in the tunnel.
Oregon State wins the tip and jumps
out to a seven-point halftime lead. The
Beavers are shooting a phenomenal 60
percent from the field, and Payton has

nine points and six assists at the break.
There are no Bobby Knight-style
tirades from Montgomery at the half,
though. After huddling with his assis
tants outside the locker room, he calmly
talks about playing better defense and
stopping Oregon State at the point of
attack.
The Beavers are frustrating Stanford's
big men with a soft 2-3 zone, and Mont
gomery tells his players to be patient
when attacking the zone.
There's no panic. Everyone knows
Oregon State has played a nearly perfect
first half, and that the Cardinal has 20
minutes to cut into the margin.
Stanford does fight back quickly and
rides the shooting of Lichti to the lead.
OSU refuses to quit, though, and capi
talizes on several late Stanford turnovers
to eke out a 63-61 win.
Inside the locker room after the game
the mood is funereal. The Cardinal has
just let a critical conference game slip
through its fingers at home. Montgomery
again talks with his assistants before ad
dressing his crestfallen team.
