# Success can't spoil eager captains
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Times have certainly changed
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team, and no two people know
this more than co-captains Kami
Anderson and Charli Turner.
Four years ago, Anderson and
Turner arrived on the Farm to

join a perennially unnoticed bas
ketball program that went 5-23
in their senior year of high school.
Dotty McCrea was the team's
coach, and the NCAA Tourna
ment was just a distant hope for
the two freshmen starters.
Now, in 1988, Stanford has be
come one of the premier women's
basketball programs on the west

coast, boasting a 25-1 record,
leading the Pacific 10 Conference
and enjoying an unprecedented
No. 9 ranking on the Associated
Press poll. With Coach Tara Van-
Derveer's tutelege, NCAAs are
now a reality for the Cardinal,
not a fantasy.
Once again, the freshman class
has burst onto the scene, but now
it is Anderson and Turner on the
sidelines, relegated to behind-the
scenes support rather than the
starring role.
Yet the seniors are surprisingly
happy.
"Well, we're winning more now,
so I have to look at that as a
more positive thing," Anderson
said. "I suppose when you get to
be older, you look at it from a
perspective that basketball is not
everything.
"It's something I do for four
years, ery'oy it while I do it but
it's not what makes me me. If I
don't play, I'm no less of a person
than if I play 40 minutes, and I
think that's the transition that
both Charli and I made."
It is this attitude that makes
Turner and Anderson the
respected leaders of the Cardinal.
"It's hard to do a captain's job
when you're not playing that
much, but I think they both do
a great job," sophomore guard
Jennifer Azzi said.
" I think that part of the reason
they get so much respect is their
attitudes. Charli is a worker, and
Kami is the same way on the court
and gives it everything."
The pair also has the wisdom
that experience has brought. An
derson was a highly sought-after
prep from Valley City, North
Dakota, before becoming a three
year starter for Stanford. In that
time she accumulated an impres
sive 1,013 points, the sixth high
est total in school history, as well

as all-conference honors in her
freshman and junior seasons.
Out of the competitive arena,
the senior is completing a rigorous
pre-medical program in order to
become an orthopedic surgeon.
Balancing the load of athletics and
academics is difficult for any per
son, yet somehow she seems to
excel at both.
"She's great," Turner said.
"She's an extremely competitive
person, she has a great sense of
humor and she keeps things in
perspective.
"I see her as a great friend, a
life-long friend beyond our bas
ketball years. I see her separate
from basketball — I mean, I love
playing with her every day and
running the floor with her, but
it goes much deeper than that.
She has always been supportive
of me. In the most troubling
times, she'd always be there with
a word to put things into perspec
tive."
Turner, a psychology mcgor
aiming towards a Ph.D. in coach
ing behavior, has had an equally
pervasive effect on the team.
"Charii is really good at keying
in on the way people on the team
feel," Azzi said. "She calls team
meetings if she thinks people
aren't working together as well
as they should. In different kinds
of problems that a team faces,
she's the first to notice and bring
the team together."
"She's a very hard worker, very
determined and dedicated to
whatever she wants to be," An
derson added. "She'll go far based
on her determination, motivation
and dedication. I think Charli's
great, and I'm going to miss
playing with her.
Despite the different interests,
the two act as one for the Cardi
nal, working as a unit to give
guidance to the young team. With

senior Leslie Crandeli, sidelined
due to injury, and juniors Emily
Wagner and Jill Yanke, the only
other upperclassmen, a lot falls
on the seniors' shoulders.
"We have a lot of young players
who aren't used to this long of a
season and things in general, like
traveling and practice," Turner
reflected. "I think I offer a lot of
support and leadership in that
sense.

"Picking people up and getting
people going in practice is a real
big job for me and Kami, because
some of the younger players can
barely cheer on themselves, let
alone other players. So that's a
job for the older players, to help
keep things going in practice.
"Still, the team is made up of
nice and special people. People can
just run faster and jump higher
now, that's all," Anderson added.

nal, working as a unit to give
guidance to the young team. With

senior Leslie Crandeli, sidelined
due to injury, and juniors Emily
Wagner and Jill Yanke, the only
other upperclassmen, a lot falls
on the seniors' shoulders.
"We have a lot of young players
who aren't used to this long of a
season and things in general, like
traveling and practice," Turner
reflected. "I think I offer a lot of
support and leadership in that
sense.

"Picking people up and getting
people going in practice is a real
big job for me and Kami, because
some of the younger players can
barely cheer on themselves, let
alone other players. So that's a
job for the older players, to help
keep things going in practice.
"Still, the team is made up of
nice and special people. People can
just run faster and jump higher
now, that's all," Anderson added.

Senior forward Kami Anderson, a preseason honorable mention
Ail-America selection, has brought deft ball-handling and a potent
Jump shot to the Cardinal.

Though senior guard Charll Turner's action has been limited this
season, she has been one of the guiding forces of the No. 9
Stanford women's basketball team.
Times have certainly changed
for the Stanford women's basket
ball team, and no two people know
this more than co-captains Kami
Anderson and Charli Turner.
Four years ago, Anderson and
Turner arrived on the Farm to

join a perennially unnoticed bas
ketball program that went 5-23
in their senior year of high school.
Dotty McCrea was the team's
coach, and the NCAA Tourna
ment was just a distant hope for
the two freshmen starters.
Now, in 1988, Stanford has be
come one of the premier women's
basketball programs on the west

coast, boasting a 25-1 record,
leading the Pacific 10 Conference
and enjoying an unprecedented
No. 9 ranking on the Associated
Press poll. With Coach Tara Van-
Derveer's tutelege, NCAAs are
now a reality for the Cardinal,
not a fantasy.
Once again, the freshman class
has burst onto the scene, but now
it is Anderson and Turner on the
sidelines, relegated to behind-the
scenes support rather than the
starring role.
Yet the seniors are surprisingly
happy.
"Well, we're winning more now,
so I have to look at that as a
more positive thing," Anderson
said. "I suppose when you get to
be older, you look at it from a
perspective that basketball is not
everything.
"It's something I do for four
years, ery'oy it while I do it but
it's not what makes me me. If I
don't play, I'm no less of a person
than if I play 40 minutes, and I
think that's the transition that
both Charli and I made."
It is this attitude that makes
Turner and Anderson the
respected leaders of the Cardinal.
"It's hard to do a captain's job
when you're not playing that
much, but I think they both do
a great job," sophomore guard
Jennifer Azzi said.
" I think that part of the reason
they get so much respect is their
attitudes. Charli is a worker, and
Kami is the same way on the court
and gives it everything."
The pair also has the wisdom
that experience has brought. An
derson was a highly sought-after
prep from Valley City, North
Dakota, before becoming a three
year starter for Stanford. In that
time she accumulated an impres
sive 1,013 points, the sixth high
est total in school history, as well

as all-conference honors in her
freshman and junior seasons.
Out of the competitive arena,
the senior is completing a rigorous
pre-medical program in order to
become an orthopedic surgeon.
Balancing the load of athletics and
academics is difficult for any per
son, yet somehow she seems to
excel at both.
"She's great," Turner said.
"She's an extremely competitive
person, she has a great sense of
humor and she keeps things in
perspective.
"I see her as a great friend, a
life-long friend beyond our bas
ketball years. I see her separate
from basketball — I mean, I love
playing with her every day and
running the floor with her, but
it goes much deeper than that.
She has always been supportive
of me. In the most troubling
times, she'd always be there with
a word to put things into perspec
tive."
Turner, a psychology mcgor
aiming towards a Ph.D. in coach
ing behavior, has had an equally
pervasive effect on the team.
"Charii is really good at keying
in on the way people on the team
feel," Azzi said. "She calls team
meetings if she thinks people
aren't working together as well
as they should. In different kinds
of problems that a team faces,
she's the first to notice and bring
the team together."
"She's a very hard worker, very
determined and dedicated to
whatever she wants to be," An
derson added. "She'll go far based
on her determination, motivation
and dedication. I think Charli's
great, and I'm going to miss
playing with her.
