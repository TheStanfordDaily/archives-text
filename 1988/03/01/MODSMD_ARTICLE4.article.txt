# Police panel seeks to heal wounds
## Committee's legitimacy rests on handling allegations of racism 
### Joe Metcalfe Staff writer 
The long-delayed formation of the Panel
on Student and Police Relations, which
met last week for the first time, reflects
lingering concerns that continue to sour
relations between minority students and
the Stanford Police Department.

News analysis

Assoc. Dean of Campus Affairs Michael
Jackson, who chairs the panel, stresses
that the committee's bimonthly meetings
will not dwell on the negative. Instead, it
will represent a broader "open dialogue"
that extends beyond minority students and
deals with the entire Stanford community.
But while it is not solely intended to
address minority-police issues, the commit
tee's legitimacy in the eyes of students

appears to depend on its handling of alle
gations that the police department
routinely treats minority students differ
ently than non-minority students.
Charges of minority mistreatment and
harassment continue to surface two years
after a black student alleged he was beaten
by police after being arrested for protesting
the University's investments in South
Africa.
Today most students and administrators
agree that while it is difficult to accurately
gauge the frequency of blatant racist acts
by the police, the number is probably quite
small.
Black Student Union member Darrell
Daniels, a junior, claims that while the
number of "overtly racist acts is not alarm
ingly high, it occurs enough for the Uni
versity to take notice."
Senior Lucky Gutierrez, an ASSU


Marvin Herrington
senator and co-coordinator of
MEChA, a Chicano-Latino stu
dent organization, agrees that be
cause such situations occur infre
quently, in general, blatant racial
harassment is "not a big prob
lem."
What does appear to be a prob
lem is the belief, widely shared
in the minority community, that
the police often harass minority
students in subtle but disturbing
ways.
Although some qualify their
criticism of police actions by
recognizing that law enforcement

officers are on campus to protect
those in the Stanford community,
students are also troubled by the
trequent allegations of blacks and
Latinos being accosted by police
and asked to show Stanford iden
tification for no apparent reason.
"Since Stanford is a very non
minority, white, mainstream
place, [minorities] tend to look out
of place more than anyone else
(and) the police are apt to go after
them more," says junior Joey
Thomas, a member of the Uni
versity Committee on Minority Is
sues.
The police vehemently deny
such charges. Captain Marvin
Moore, who is also a member of
the police relations panel, says
that any student — minority or

non-minority — is equally likely
to be stopped if there is probable
cause for suspicion.
Moore, himself black, admits
that minority distrust of police is
historically well-founded and that
racism flourishes in police depart
ments across the country. But,
Moore says, systematic racism
doesn't exist in the Stanford
Police Department.
"I can't say that there aren't
cases, but without a doubt 99.9
percent of the time [charges of
racism] are unfounded," Moore
says.
Jackson attributes much of the
tension to a lack of understanding
about the guidelines and stand
ards of behavior under which the
police operate.
But whether such accusations
are true, "there is widespread dis
content among the black student
body," according to junior Jona
than Holloway, a student member
of the panel.
BSU Chair Bill King contends
that the harassment of blacks
causes some to feel that they "are
foreign, something not normal
and something that the police
need to be made aware of."

Gutierrez, who says he has been
stopped several times during the
past several years for no apparent
reason, echoes King's concern
that the present situation "sends
a subtle message that [minorities]
don't belong here, that [they]
don't deserve to be here."
Others, like BSU member Da
vid Porter, a first-year graduate
student in industrial engineering,
claim that the police also tend to
judge people by the clothes they
are wearing or the car they are
driving.
"They make assumptions about
[who is and who is] not a part of
the 'Stanford family,' " Porter
says.
Captain Moore, however, ar
gues that students oflen fail to
understand standard police pro
cedures, which leads to misun
derstandings and allegations of
racial harassment. Such charges,
Moore adds, have in the past been
leveled at black officers.
Although "sometimes it's really
convenient to ... charge racism,"
Moore cautions that unjustifiably
doing so sends up a "smoke
screen" that makes rooting out
legitimately racist incidents more

difficult.
Senior Alex Niles disagrees.
"Students aren't dumb and are
not going to cry racism" when it
is not warranted, he says.
Such widespread disagreement
between the police department
and the minority community
point to the need for better com
munication, something that both
sides agree can only improve the
situation.
But doubts have been raised as
to the other steps the committee
can take to address minority con
cerns, especially since the panel's
charge restricts discussion of in
dividual complaints to clarifying
how and to whom such complaints
are best made. The panel.itself
will not receive and investigate
individual complaints.
Jackson, however, stresses that
any member of the Stanford com
munity who has a complaint
about improper police behavior
has a variety of options, including
discussing the matter with Cap
tain Moore or Police Chief Marvin
Herrington, or bringing concerns
to the attention of the Office of
Student Affairs.
To complement these channels,

Jackson says the committee is
"really the beginning of a long
term educational process so that
members of the Stanford commu
nity can have a better working
relationship with the Stanford
Police Department to prevent
misunderstandings in the future."
And regardless of the limita
tions contained in the panel's
charge, says Ron Hudson, assis
tant dean of student affairs, the
group's formation is a positive
step forward.
Hollo way agrees that the com
mittee, after a period of apparent
neglect in addressing the issues,
is a definite step in the right di
rection.
Others, such as law student
Charic Daniels, former co-chair of
the Black Law Students Associa
tion, were more skeptical about
the success of the panel, claiming
that the committee needs to ex
amine the problems underlying
the issues.
If nothing else, the panel is a
further reminder that, according
to King, "Stanford has room for
improvement in terms of making
the atmosphere (on campus) in
clusive of minorities."
