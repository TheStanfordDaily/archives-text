# Police panel seeks to heal wounds
## Committee's legitimacy rests on handling allegations of racism 
### Joe Metcalfe Staff writer 
The long-delayed formation of the Panel
on Student and Police Relations, which
met last week for the first time, reflects
lingering concerns that continue to sour
relations between minority students and
the Stanford Police Department.

Assoc. Dean of Campus Affairs Michael
Jackson, who chairs the panel, stresses
that the committee's bimonthly meetings
will not dwell on the negative. Instead, it
will represent a broader "open dialogue"
that extends beyond minority students and
deals with the entire Stanford community.
But while it is not solely intended to
address minority-police issues, the commit
tee's legitimacy in the eyes of students

appears to depend on its handling of alle
gations that the police department
routinely treats minority students differ
ently than non-minority students.
Charges of minority mistreatment and
harassment continue to surface two years
after a black student alleged he was beaten
by police after being arrested for protesting
the University's investments in South
Africa.
Today most students and administrators
agree that while it is difficult to accurately
gauge the frequency of blatant racist acts
by the police, the number is probably quite
small.
Black Student Union member Darrell
Daniels, a junior, claims that while the
number of "overtly racist acts is not alarm
ingly high, it occurs enough for the Uni
versity to take notice."
