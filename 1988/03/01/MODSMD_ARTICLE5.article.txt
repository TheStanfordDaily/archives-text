# IFC stubborn on dry rush issue
## Despite nationwide trend, fraternities here still serve alcohol 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
Despite a nationwide trend
toward dry rush and pressure
from national fraternal organiza
tions not to serve any alcohol
during annual recruitment par
ties, the Interfraternity Council
here so far has remained stubborn
in its preservation of a wet rush.

News analysis

But because of concern ex
pressed last week by Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons, the IFC
will reconsider its Jan. 27 decision
not to ban alcohol during this
spring's fraternity Rush.
The council is confident of its
decision. IFC President Vinny
Frost said the IFC will discuss
several compromise plans at its
meeting tomorrow, but other fra
ternity members said it was un
likely that the original 15-4 deci
sion will be changed.
Most national fraternal organ
izations — including Sigma Chi,
Kappa Alpha and Kappa Sigma
— urge their individual chapters
to opt for a dry rush.
"We certainly recommend and
strongly advise dry rush," said
W.E. Forester, executive vice
president of the national KA fra
ternity. "We feel that rush is very
important and it is best not to
dilute it with alcoholic bever

ages," he said.
But in many cases these rec
ommendations have not had an
impact on Stanford fraternities.
Former Stanford KA President
Charles Moody, a senior, said his
fraternity has not felt much pres
sure from KA headquarters to
have a dry rush. "We've never
gotten any instruction from the
national organization concerning
wet or dry rush," Moody said.
Some Stanford fraternities have
already implemented a dry rush.
Both Sigma Phi Epsilon and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon will hold dry
rushes this year because of their
national organizations' policies.
Reception to these dry rushes
points to the fact that the process
has not suffered. Past Sig Ep
President Mike Fosnaugh, whose
fraternity has held dry rushes for
the past two years, said not
having alcohol present has not
presented a problem. "Rush is
definitely not a partying time. It's
a decision-making time," said
Fosnaugh, a fifth-year senior.
IFC Vice President Stuart Levy,
a senior and a member of SAE,
said his fraternity's first dry rush
last year was "very successful. It
made it a little hard, but it worked
out better in the long run."
Sigma Alpha Mu has decided to
go dry on its own this year. "We
didn't feel that alcohol helped at
all," said SAM President Rene
Lacerte. "We talked to our mem
bers and found that none of them

had pledged because of alcohol at
parties." Lacerte also cited
liability and the high cost of al
cohol as reasons for going dry.
Last spring, junior David Dun
shee drowned in Lake Lagunita
after becoming intoxicated at a
Rush party. Frost said that al
though Dunshee's death was
"very unfortunate," the incident
was "not a result of the wet rush
system."
Across the nation, many frater
nities are making the switch from
wet to dry rush, and for a variety
of reasons.
At Rutgers University, for in
stance, officials are questioning
drinking policies after the death
of a student who drank too much
at a rush party last year.
All fraternities at the Univer
sity of Southern California, Pep
perdine University, UC-Berkeley
and UCLA have stopped serving
alcohol during rush because of
possible fraternity liability in case
an alcohol-related accident occurs
after a rush party.
Even San Diego State Univer
sity, last year named Playboy
Magazine's "number one party
school," has a partially dry rush
and is currently considering a
completely dry rush, according to
the university's Fraternal Affairs
adviser.
The 43 fraternities at Berkeley
have held dry rush for five years.
Berkeley IFC President Andrew
Levey said the switch was made
"to create a better atmosphere
for making decisions." Levey said
that at the time the change was
made, there was significant dis
sent. However, he said the frater
nal system has thrived since dry
rush was instituted.
"It seems like a big step, [but]
our fraternal system has gotten

bigger since we've gone dry,"
Levey said.
Despite outright opposition to
wet rush from Lyons, Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano and
national fraternal organizations,
the IFC has maintained that a
partially wet rush should continue
at Stanford and that wet rush has
had no adverse affect on the se
lection process.
Alpha Delta Phi President Greg
Smith voted for a wet rush and
said alcohol is important to his
fraternity's rush process.

News analysis

But because of concern ex
pressed last week by Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons, the IFC
will reconsider its Jan. 27 decision
not to ban alcohol during this
spring's fraternity Rush.
The council is confident of its
decision. IFC President Vinny
Frost said the IFC will discuss
several compromise plans at its
meeting tomorrow, but other fra
ternity members said it was un
likely that the original 15-4 deci
sion will be changed.
Most national fraternal organ
izations — including Sigma Chi,
Kappa Alpha and Kappa Sigma
— urge their individual chapters
to opt for a dry rush.
"We certainly recommend and
strongly advise dry rush," said
W.E. Forester, executive vice
president of the national KA fra
ternity. "We feel that rush is very
important and it is best not to
dilute it with alcoholic bever

ages," he said.
But in many cases these rec
ommendations have not had an
impact on Stanford fraternities.
Former Stanford KA President
Charles Moody, a senior, said his
fraternity has not felt much pres
sure from KA headquarters to
have a dry rush. "We've never
gotten any instruction from the
national organization concerning
wet or dry rush," Moody said.
Some Stanford fraternities have
already implemented a dry rush.
Both Sigma Phi Epsilon and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon will hold dry
rushes this year because of their
national organizations' policies.
Reception to these dry rushes
points to the fact that the process
has not suffered. Past Sig Ep
President Mike Fosnaugh, whose
fraternity has held dry rushes for
the past two years, said not
having alcohol present has not
presented a problem. "Rush is
definitely not a partying time. It's
a decision-making time," said
Fosnaugh, a fifth-year senior.
IFC Vice President Stuart Levy,
a senior and a member of SAE,
said his fraternity's first dry rush
last year was "very successful. It
made it a little hard, but it worked
out better in the long run."
Sigma Alpha Mu has decided to
go dry on its own this year. "We
didn't feel that alcohol helped at
all," said SAM President Rene
Lacerte. "We talked to our mem
bers and found that none of them

had pledged because of alcohol at
parties." Lacerte also cited
liability and the high cost of al
cohol as reasons for going dry.
Last spring, junior David Dun
shee drowned in Lake Lagunita
after becoming intoxicated at a
Rush party. Frost said that al
though Dunshee's death was
"very unfortunate," the incident
was "not a result of the wet rush
system."
Across the nation, many frater
nities are making the switch from
wet to dry rush, and for a variety
of reasons.
At Rutgers University, for in
stance, officials are questioning
drinking policies after the death
of a student who drank too much
at a rush party last year.
All fraternities at the Univer
sity of Southern California, Pep
perdine University, UC-Berkeley
and UCLA have stopped serving
alcohol during rush because of
possible fraternity liability in case
an alcohol-related accident occurs
after a rush party.
Even San Diego State Univer
sity, last year named Playboy
Magazine's "number one party
school," has a partially dry rush
and is currently considering a
completely dry rush, according to
the university's Fraternal Affairs
adviser.
The 43 fraternities at Berkeley
have held dry rush for five years.
Berkeley IFC President Andrew
Levey said the switch was made
"to create a better atmosphere
for making decisions." Levey said
that at the time the change was
made, there was significant dis
sent. However, he said the frater
nal system has thrived since dry
rush was instituted.
"It seems like a big step, [but]
our fraternal system has gotten

bigger since we've gone dry,"
Levey said.
Despite outright opposition to
wet rush from Lyons, Fraternal
Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano and
national fraternal organizations,
the IFC has maintained that a
partially wet rush should continue
at Stanford and that wet rush has
had no adverse affect on the se
lection process.
Alpha Delta Phi President Greg
Smith voted for a wet rush and
said alcohol is important to his
fraternity's rush process.
