# Alums offer to match donations by seniors

With the support of two alumni
offering Centennial contributions
to match donations from mem
bers of the senior class, the Senior
Pledge Committee is strongly
seeking contributions from grad
uating seniors.
Roy and Betty Anderson have
pledged to match senior donations
dollar for dollar. Seniors were sent
a donation request on Feb. 8 from
the Senior Pledge Committee ask
ing for an $88 pledge, payable
over the next four years.
Roy earned a master's degree
in business administration here
in 1949 and Betty, a bachelor's
degree in biological sciences in
1948.
In addition, the committee has
added a new twist in the current
pitch for donations by allowing
seniors to earmark their gifts for
specific organizations or groups
within the University.
Senior Monica Van Campen,
chair of the Senior Pledge Com
mittee, said, "This year we're em
phasizing designated gifts."
The emphasis was added to give
seniors greater incentive to
donate to the University by con
tributing to a program that par
ticularly interests them.
Roy Anderson said the match
ing grant is intended to "assist
students in their undergraduate
years" and "that we would like

to see graduates of Stanford begin
the habit of giving immediately
after graduation."
However, the solicitation dis
mays some seniors. Council of
Presidents member Maria Can as
said, "I'm not sure how much the
Stanford education is worth, so
as of now I'm a little reluctant
to give even more money (beyond
tuition) to Stanford."
Suzanne Meier, a member of
the Senior Pledge Committee, was
non-committal, saying, "people
either agree or disagree" with the
idea of soliciting donations from
seniors.
However, Van Campen said the
purpose of the mailings — the
first of three — was not just to
get seniors to donate to Stanford
but "to educate seniors about the
importance of investing in Stan
ford."
She noted that only one-half of
the cost of a Stanford education
is covered by tuition, and the
other half comes from contribu
tions and endowment.
In recent years, the task of
educating soon-to-be alumni on
the importance of donating to the
University has become a high
priority for the Office of Develop
ment, the f\ind-raising branch of
the University.
The office initiated the Senior
Pledge Committee in 1978.
