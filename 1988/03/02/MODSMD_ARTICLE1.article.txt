## ASSU to air senate meeting 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will hit prime time this spring.
The senate last night allocated $700 to televise one
of its spring quarter meetings on the SUNet cable
system.
Plans call for SUNet to broadcast the final senate
meeting before the spring elections. The April
telecast, which has been planned for nine months
but didn't receive funding until last night, is only
a one-time experiment, but several senators said
they hoped more senate meetings could be televised
in the future.
As part of the deal, SUNet agreed to connect
permanent cables to two rooms in the Law School
where the senate meets, according to telecast
producer Alex Danel, who said the cables can be
used to broadcast forums held in the same Law
School rooms.
"Televised senate meetings will make for better
student government in the long run," said Danel,
a senior.
A program called "Meet the Candidates," which
will give candidates five minutes of airtime, will be
broadcast in the time slot before the televised senate
meeting.
In other business, the senate voted to approve
allocations from the Program Board's discretionary
fund and from the Publication Board's annual fund.
The Program Board provides funds for student
organizations that have small budgets, such as the
Stanford Soviet Exchange Project and Friends of
Free South Africa.
Last night, more than $4,800 of discretionary
funding was allocated to 17 different organizations,
based upon recommendations by the Program Board
and the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Since the Program Board fund has not increased
in the past three years, the senate voted to place
a proposed 20 percent increment in Program Board
funds on the spring ballot. If passed, this increase
in base funds will replace the system of annual
percentage rate increases, an item also on the ballot.
The senate also voted to provide $18,860 to 10
different student publications from the Publication
Board's annual fund.
Appropriations Committee Chair Jon Inda said
it was difficult to trim the various publications'
budgets. Inda, a junior, admitted that the overex
tended allocation of funds will leave little money
for next year's discretionary fund, but he added
that about $7,000 will be saved if the Chaparral
and Stanford Latino Student Alliance get special
fee requests. If that is the case, the Chaparral and
SaLSA's publication, Estos Tiempos, will not need
the funds.
Since the Publication Board has been besieged
by fee requests, board director Keith Seinfeld said
the board will campaign vigorously to gain student
support for an annual percentage fee increase in
the spring elections.
Also last night, the senate voted down a bill from
Council of Presidents member Leonard Adler.
The senate voted 10-8-2 against a preferential
voting system bill intended to eliminate run-off
elections between COP slates during the spring
election.
A preferential voting system would save time and
money, Adler argued, by ensuring that a COP slate
will be found victorious after the first election.
Undergraduate senator Stacey Leyton, a senior,
opposed the bill, saying that students know a lot
about their favorite slate, but that other rankings
would be random.
