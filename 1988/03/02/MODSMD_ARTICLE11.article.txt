# Heart device raises ethical questions

### Jeff Album 
Although excitement is growing
within the medical community
over a new artificial heart being
used at Stanford, the new device
— a 1.5-pound pump that is surgi
cally implanted in the abdomen
— is raising ethical questions in
the minds of some heart special
ists.
Since September 1984, seven
patients with degenerative heart
diseases have been implanted with
the Novacor Left Ventrical Assist
Device at Stanford Hospital. Un
like the first artificial heart, de
signed by Dr. Robert Jarvik, the
Novacor device does not com
pletely replace the heart.

Rather, it is a pump placed in
the abdominal wall that assists
the left side of the damaged organ.
Currently, the device is used to
keep patients alive until a perma
nent donor heart can be found
for transplant. Under current
Federal Drug Administration reg
ulations, the only licensed use for
the device is for patients who need
to survive long enough to receive
a heart transplant.
Although many researchers at
Stanford are enthusiastic about
what the device can contribute to
critically ill heart patients, some
heart surgeons fear the broader
implications of its use.
Dr. J. Donald Hill, chairman of
the Department of Cardiovascular

Surgery at Pacific Presbyterian
Medical Center, said he ap
preciates the potential value of
the Novacor device but warned
that the improved technology
raises ethical questions about the
treatment of heart disease.
By using such devices as "a
bridge to transplant," Hill said,
"you are increasing the number
of recipients waiting for only
1,500 available hearts." According
to Hill, only 4 to 5 percent of the
30,000 patients in the United
States waiting for hearts will be
able to recieve them. He added
that it is likely the Novacor device
will make that line even longer.
Even the device's inventor
agreed that his brainchild may

pose serious problems for the
treatment of heart disease. Peer
Portner is a consulting professor
of Cardiovascular Surgery at
Stanford and president of the
Oakland-based Novacor Medical
Corp. that developed the device.
Portner conceded that there is
a potential for abuse under a sys
tem where patients diagnosed as
being at the greatest risk have
priority for available hearts. Ac
cording to Portner, doctors may
be tempted to recommend the
Novacar device to patients in or
der to give them priority on the
waiting list for heart transplants.
