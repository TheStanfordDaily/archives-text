Violence mars Panama strike
PANAMA CITY, Panama — For the first
time during Panama's general commercial
strike, significant violence broke out yesterday
as police clashed with bystanders during the
forced closing of a radio station and the arrest
of opponents of the government.
The strike intensified slightly as it entered
its second day. It was called by the self-styled
Civic Crusade, a grouping of business and
trade organizations opposed to the de facto
rule of Panama's military strongman, Gen.
Manuel Noriega.
The strike has paralyzed most industries in
Panama City as well as stores in middle- and
upper-class neighborhoods. Businesses in
poorer sections of town remained open, re
flecting the inability of strike organizers to
widen direct anti-government action into
working-class districts of Panama.
An air of uncertainty resulting from the
country's political crisis deepened with word
that locally owned banks had closed because,
according to bankers and diplomats, they were
running out of money.
Reagan 'Decertifies' Panama
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
advised Congress yesterday that Panama,
whose military strongman has been indicted
on narcotics charges, and three other countries
— Afghanistan, Iran and Syria — have not
cooperated with the United States to halt drug
trafficking and are liable to an aid cutoff and
other sanctions.
Ann Wrobelski, assistant secretary of state
for international narcotics matters, acknowl
edged that the long-expected action against
Panama has no immediate practical effect be
cause all U.S. aid to Panama has been
suspended. She also said Reagan plans to take
a "wait-and-see" approach before deciding on
possible further steps against the government
controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
The administration continues to recognize
Eric Delvalle, Panama's ousted civilian leader
who went into hiding, as president. Delvalle's
ambassador here, Juan Sosa, who refused to
relinquish the embassy to a Noriega-named
successor and who still has U.S. recognition,
announced yesterday a plan to increase the
financial burdens on the struggling Panama
nian economy by encouraging withholding of
debts, taxes and other payments until consti
tutional government is restored.
Meese stock deals questioned
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin
Meese Ill's former financial adviser turned a
nearly 80 percent profit in 18 months for
Meese through extraordinary financial prac
tices in which he assigned stock purchases to
the attorney general's account after learning
how the transactions had fared, Senate inves
tigators said yesterday.
The assignments, made after the stock
transactions were completed, came from a pool
of purchases made by W. Franklyn Chinn,
who was handling four other accounts at the
time, according to a report by the Democratic
staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs Sub
committee on Oversight of Government Man
agement.
The practice raised questions about whether
Chinn assigned particularly profitable stock
purchases to Meese's account while short
changing others. "It strongly appears" that
the Meese account "performed much better
than the other accounts," one subcommittee
staff member said.
