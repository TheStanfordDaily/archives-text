# McCloskey refuses to recant allegations
## Robertson seeks to drop libel suit 
### 
WASHINGTON — Republican pres
idential candidate Pat Robertson said
yesterday he will seek to drop his libel
suit against former Rep. Paul "Pete"
McCloskey, R-Calif., even though Mc-
Closkey has refused to recant his charge
that Robertson used political clout to
avoid combat duty in the Korean War.
Caught in a political bind as he faced
the prospect of a long trial that is sched
uled to begin March 8 — Super Tuesday
— Robertson indicated that he will ask
U.S. District Court Judge Joyce Hens
Green to dismiss the suit he brought
against McCloskey more than a year
ago here.
When he filed the libel suit, Robertson
declared that it was essential that he
clear up the charges about his military
service if he were to become president.
"No man can serve in that capacity
with an unresolved cloud over his own
personal integrity regarding military
service," he said.
But in a Florida news conference,
Robertson said the political calendar
forced him to leave the questions un

resolved. Otherwise, he would have
found himself stuck in a courtroom
hearing witnesses challenge his patrio
tism and integrity at the height of the
primary season. The emergence last
week of two llth-hour witnesses who
strongly support the charge that
Robertson skipped out of combat may
have been another factor influencing
his decision.
While battling McCloskey's challenge
to his integrity, Robertson has also
found himself criticized for a series of
charges on the campaign trail that he
has been unable to substantiate. In the
past two weeks, for example, he has
said he knows there are Soviet nuclear
missiles in Cuba, a charge he revived
yesterday. He also said Vice President
George Bush's campaign may have
leaked for political reasons the infor
mation about sexual misconduct that
forced evangelist Jimmy Swaggart to
give up his ministry and that
Robertson's television network told
President Reagan the location of U.S.
hostages hidden in Lebanon.

McCloskey's lawyer, George Lehner,
said McCloskey is "eager to go to trial"
to prove that his charge against
Robertson is true. He said McCloskey
would likely oppose dismissal of the suit
unless Robertson agrees to pay all the
legal fees McCloskey ran up in the suit.
Robertson said last week he would not
pay "one nickel" of McCloskey's fees.
Robertson has called the judge
"patently unfair" for setting a trial date
in the middle of his campaign.
As Marine lieutenants, Robertson and
McCloskey were on a troop ship to
gether en route to Korea when
Robertson was removed from the ship
in Japan. Robertson later served in
Korea as a headquarters clerk. Although
he has described himself as a "combat
officer," Robertson said in depositions
in the lawsuit that he did not serve on
the front lines.
McCloskey made the charge that
spawned the libel suit in 1981 and again
in 1986.
