# Soviets impose curfew

MOSCOW â€” In a rare admis
sion that Soviet troops have been
deployed to maintain internal or
der, the Soviet government an
nounced yesterday that infantry
units in armored personnel carri
ers were enforcing a curfew in
the riot-torn city of Sumgait in
the Moslem republic of Azer
baijan.
The night curfew was imposed
following a violent rampage Sun
day, Foreign Ministry press
spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov
said yesterday. He said he believed
troops were still deployed in the
streets and described the atmos
phere as "calm but tense."
The curfew was in effect for
the last two days from 7 p.m. to
8 a.m., according to a Communist
Party official in Sumgait reached
by telephone.
In addition to troops and per
sonnel carriers, Soviet authorities
are using the state-controlled
media in efforts to restore order
in Sumgait. An appeal by leader
Mikhail Gorbachev for reason and
calm, first broadcast throughout
the republics of Azerbaijan and
Armenia Friday, is now being
beamed into Sumgait by radio and
television, said a journalist there
reached by telephone.
The tough response to the eth
nic outbreaks appeared to reflect
a strong resolve in the Kremlin
to stamp out nationalist-inspired
protests. Clashes are unusual in
Soviet cities, whose streets are
policed heavily.
The decision to send in troops
to restore order seemed to indi
cate that the disturbances in
Sumgait, a city of 223,000 in an
oil-producing region 22 miles
from Baku, the Azerbaijani capi
tal, were quite violent. A Soviet
journalist reached by reporters
said several people were injured
Sunday.
"If there are acts of violence,"
Gerasimov said, "then there are
certain to be injuries." The Baku

based journalist attributed the
clash to a group of teen-agers,
"juvenile delinquents."
The rioting, reported here Mon
day by Tass, broke out the same
day that news of killings in an
earlier clash in another part of
Azerbaijan was broadcast, raising
the possibility that the protesters
sought to avenge those deaths.
The rioting in Sumgait occurred
one day after two weeks of mass
protests by Armenians were
halted in their republic's capital,
Yerevan. The timing has sugges
ted that the Azeris in Sumgait
rioted in response to a triumphant
mood among Armenians during
their protests.
Demonstrators in Yerevan were
demanding the unification of an
ethnic Armenian enclave, Na
gorno-Karabakh, which is part of
Azerbaijan, with Armenia. They
agreed to disperse on Saturday
after Gorbachev reportedly agreed
to consider their appeal.
The Yerevan demonstrations
drew crowds of 100,000 or more,
according to sources there. The
deaths took place in a clash be
tween Azerbaijanis and Ar
menians in Nagorno-Karabakh,
according to an official account.
The wave of unrest in Nagorno-
Karabakh underscored a long his
tory of religious and ethnic
squabbles in the area between
Christian Armenians, who com
prise at least 75 percent of the
enclave's population, and the pre
dominantly Shiite Moslem Azer
baijanis.
Although the information
released officially in Moscow
about the riots was terse, the very
existence of the reporting by the
official news agency Tass and the
follow-up statements by
Gerasimov were indications that
the new policy of glasnost, or
openness, is being applied in
nationality conflicts.
