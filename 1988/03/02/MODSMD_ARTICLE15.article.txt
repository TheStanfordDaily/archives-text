# Bush and Dukakis lead Vermont, Southern states
## 
### 
MONTPELIER, Vt. - Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts opened a huge
lead in Vermont's non-binding presiden
tial primary yesterday, a contest with
more psychological than electoral signif
icance on the pathway to Super Tuesday,
March 8.
Among the Republicans, Vice Presi
dent George Bush led Sen. Robert Dole
of Kansas. NBC News last night
projected that Bush would be the even
tual winner.
Among the Democrats, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson ran a surprisingly strong
second, taking more than a quarter of
the Democratic vote in a state with a
minuscule number of black residents.
With 58 percent of the precincts
reporting, Bush had 9,838 votes in the
Republican primary, or 49 percent of
the total cast, to Dole's 8,168, or 40
percent. Trailing far behind were Pat
Robertson with 5 percent and Rep. Jack
Kemp with 4 percent. Former Delaware
Gov. Pierre "Pete" du Pont IV and
former Secretary of State Alexander
Haig Jr., who have withdrawn from the
race, had 2 percent and 1 percent,
respectively.
Among the Democrats, Dukakis had
12,383 for 55 percent and Jackson had
6,333 votes for 28 percent. Rep. Richard
Gephardt, who visited the state several
times, had 8 percent, and Sen. Paul
Simon, who made no real effort here,
had 5 percent. Former Sen. Gaiy Hart
had 4 percent and Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
was not on the ballot.
The results of the Vermont primary
notwithstanding, Bush holds a com
manding lead in virtually all the 16
states holding Republican primaries on
March 8, Super Tuesday, while Dukakis
and Jackson remain neck and neck for
the lead on the Democratic side.
An Washington Post-ABC News Poll
found that Bush holds nearly | 3-to-l
lead over Dole among likely voters in

Republican primaries in the region. In
the Democratic contest, half the likely
electorate is split evenly between
Dukakis and Jackson, while Gore follows
with just under 20 percent and Gephardt
trails the front-runners with just under
15 percent.
In addition gauging to the head-to
head competition, the poll offered in
sights into the Democratic and Repub
lican electorates before the largest col
lective primary to be held in the nation's
history. Among the findings:
• Pat Robertson's Christian insurgency
has failed to materialize so far as a
serious challenge to Bush in any state
— unless Robertson's supporters have
been underestimated, as they have in
other surveys. While running third over
all, far behind Bush and well behind
Dole, the former television evangelist is
in a position to take second place away
from Dole in Oklahoma and Alabama.
• Dukakis, who has been identified with
the reform-liberal wing of the Demo
cratic Party, is fully competitive among
Democrats who identify themselves as
conservative. With those Democrats who
place themselves on the right of the
ideological spectrum, Dukakis and Gore
are both leading, each getting about one
quarter of this wing. Dukakis holds a
modest advantage over Jackson among
Democrats who say they are liberal, and
he leads among moderates.
• When Bush ran for the presidency in
1980 he was generally viewed as the
moderate in the GOP race, challenging
the more conservative Ronald Reagan.
This year, Bush is stronger among con
servatives, who back him over Dole by
almost a 3-to-l ratio, than among
moderates, who support Bush over Dole
by considerably less than a 2-to-l mar
gin.
