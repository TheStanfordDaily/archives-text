## March for safety 
### 
IT'S TIME FOR WOMEN to
"take back the night." And
tonight's march protesting
women's fears of walking alone
outside deserves everyone's active
support.
The Take Back the Night march
is gaining strength on campus due
to increased awareness of date rape
and last years' attacks on women
at night by the Physics Tank and
during broad daylight at the Dish.
The march was started on the
East coast in the mid-70's and has
been conducted here for many
years. Although the marches have
had a relatively long history, they
are still met with widespread resis
tance.
The October 1987 San Francisco
march was met with considerable
derision and jeering despite the
participation of over 2,000 men
and women and the support of over
20 organizations.
Even the Stanford marches have
met some opposition. Last year,
over 60 marchers encountered
some catcalling and jeering along
Mayfield Ave. Ignorance — of the
dangers women face and the mo
tives for the march — is the pri
mary source of any opposition.
It is the prevalent opinion that
women should not or cannot walk
alone. The incidence and likelihood
of attack are well known by both
men and women. But it is the
women who are caught between
the rock and hard place.
Women are discouraged from
walking home alone. Some feel
that asking a male friend to walk
them home is imposing, an incon
venience and sometimes demean
ing.
Also, the recent awareness of
aquaintance rape raises suspicions
in the woman's mind of asking a
male friend to accompany her
home. The woman and the woman
alone must deal with the conse

quences of exercising her freedom
of movement. The easy solution to
this predicament is the answer
women always hear: Stay at home.
The "solution" of staying at
home helps perpetuate the prob
lem of sexual assault by refusing
to address the real issue behind
the march: Women still lack any
significant measure of self
empowerment.
Tonight's march makes many
points. University awareness of
rape and sexual assault must con
tinue to increase. The University
can take concrete actions to dis
courage sexual assaults by install
ing better lighting and emergency
phones around campus and by
giving greater support to SURE.
Most importantly, the march
wants all women someday to be
able to walk home from the library
or a party or wherever, unafraid.
The entire Stanford community
should participate in and support
the march. Sexual assault is not
only a woman's problem. One out
of every three women and one out
of every seven men will be or have
been sexually assaulted by the age
of 18. The unfortunate victim is
always someone's sister or brother,
wife or husband — or friend.
Sexual assault, without a doubt,
affects everyone.
Individually, all Stanford stu
dents can help to solve this prob
lem. Men can support the march
by taking a truthful look at their
own attitudes and sexisms. Also,
there are various means of self
education available, ranging from
classes taught from the female per
spective to groups such as Men
Overcoming Violence.
Finally, the best and most effec
tive way to lend support for the
march, for both men and women,
is to go. Go march and take back
the night for everyone.
