## A 						sorrowful Tuesday 
### 
GET OUT your scissors, friends,
because you'll want to clip and
save this handy Super Tuesday
guide I've prepared just for you. Refer
back to it often.
Six days from now, on March 8, the
Democrats will hold a whopping 20 state
primaries, mostly in the South. On that
one day alone, over 30 percent of the
party's total delegates will be selected.
Almost anything can happen, but here's
what will:
Bedlam. Absolute and utter chaos.
These are the impending words that
Democrats fear most (right behind "tax
cut" and "Robert Bork"). You see, when
the Democrats planned Super Tuesday,
their goal was the fast annointing of one
candidate who could virtually wrap up
the nomination in one crucial day. They
envisioned a bandwagon effect after
Super Tuesday, with all disparate wings
of the party joining the steamrolling can
didate.
Guess again. It was an Edsel of an
idea from day one, and it shows you what
tinkering Democrats will do when left to
their own devices.
Now, dumbfounded Democratic leaders
are getting out their Hewlett-Packard sci
entific calculators and quickly concluding
that no candidate is going to have a
majority of delegates come convention
time. That means deadlock, bickering,
infighting and, finally, a consensus choice
brokered in a back room: Not exactly a
prescription for victory in the general
election.
Here's why that scenario is more

probable by the day. You see, liberal Mike
Dukakis has shown real strength. In fact,
he will be the eventual nominee, a Dem
ocratic "shot in the foot" that would
make even Dean Lyons wince.
Dukakis will win the white liberal vote
in the South, and he will certainly win
some primaries on Super Tuesday. How
ever, he faces challenges in every state
but Massachusetts from no less than
three candidates.
Albert Gore has bet the house (and
the Senate) on the South. He has en
dorsements, money and an accent that
gets even more Southern when he's cam
paigning there. He will do well on Super
Tuesday, almost as well as Dukakis. This
is his back yard though, and at the end
of the day, A 1 Gore will be disappointed
that he didn't fare better.
Jesse Jackson, simply put, will win al
most all of the black vote on Super Tues
day, no small percentage. He will also
win a sizable portion of white votes,
ample proof that his message has been
broadened since '84.
Unfortunately for him, it hasn't been
broadened enough, and Jackson will
remain the wild-card in the entire selec
tion process. His delegates will be tremen
dously important at a brokered conven
tion, and placating promises of great mag
nitude are coming to Jesse Jackson. He
is a big player.
Finally, there's Dick Gephardt, the
man who'll say anything to be president.
If "presidential points" were given for
dressing like garden vegetables, Gephardt
would come as a Bermuda onion. He

wants it that badly.
Gore must hate Gephardt, because the
congressman has stolen Gore's monopoly
on populism. They're both moderate, and
Gephardt will definitely siphon off many
potential Gore votes. Sorry, Al, your
"Southern strategy" that once looked so
brilliant is really a flop. (Did someone
say flip-flop? Where's Gephardt?)
Dour Democrats, resplendent Republi
cans, get set for a long but wild summer.
No Democrat will be "the winner" on
Super Tuesday. Dukakis will win 30 per
cent of the delegates, Gore will win 26
percent, Jackson will win 24 percent, and
Gephardt/Gatsby will win 16 percent. The
rest will be scattered, and your mileage
may vary.
Life can be funny. You see you have
a problem, and you take steps to fix it,
only to find that you made things worse.
Super Tuesday, once the Democratic
panacea, now seems like a bitter pill to
the frustrated party leadership. Super
Tuesday hasn't helped the Democrats at
all, it's just made a bad situation even
worse.
