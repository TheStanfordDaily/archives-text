## Theme houses allocate priorities subjectively 
### 
IN A FEB. 23 LETTER to the
editor, I made claims regarding
housing and draw priorities which
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of
student affairs and director of the
student housing center, has called
inaccurate.
I stated that in the Draw, students
are given a priority based on subjective
judgments of other students. Despite
Whitney's rebuttal, I still believe this
to be the case, regardless of the "ideal
situation" and the guidelines presented
to students in the Draw Book, from
which I believe Whitney quoted.
Here I am speaking of a specific
priority for theme houses, the only one
I have a serious problem understand
ing. It would be a wonderful thing if

what the Draw Book and Whitney said
were true, that a student will receive a
priority simply by "submitting a one
paragraph proposal for a house pro
gram activity and signing a house
agreement." Unfortunately, and this is
where the confusion stems, this is
simply not the case.
It has been my experience that one
does not obtain a priority simply by
submitting a one-paragraph proposal
and getting your draw card stamped. I
am truly sorry Whitney, but you are
just not aware of the realities.
My five drawmates and I spent
nearly a half hour in the American
Studies house our freshman year
trying to get the resident assistant or
house manager to approve our

proposals. Maybe I'm really stupid (I
doubt it), but this sure felt like subjec
tive judgment to me.
It may very well be the case that
policy dictates access to special
priorities is supposed to be dependent
upon objective criteria, but this is
simply not the case.
This may be a problem due to the
housing center policy or it may be due
to lack of communication between the
center and residence staff. Whichever
is the case, the problem exists and I
steadfastly hold to my claims.
As for the fact that no one ever
complains, let's get real. First of all,
we were clueless freshmen going
through a confusing and very sparsely
explained process. We simply didn't
know we were being treated unfairly.

All we knew was that it was happen
ing to everyone else in the room at the
time, and we trusted the residence
staff to know what they were doing.
Second, with the amount of red tape
on this campus, it is hardly worth the
effort. We obtained our priority on the
last night before the Draw. By the
time the problem would have been
addressed, the Draw would have been
over.
It is a sad state that the University
cannot allocate its housing in a man
ner that is consistent with its policy.
Housing is allocated subjectively, and
yes, by the University. Burn me at the
stake if you must, but I cannot be
convinced otherwise. I lived it.
