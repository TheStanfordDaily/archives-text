# Police were helpful at weekend party
## 
### 
We wish to commend the Stanford
police for their responsiveness and
diplomacy in their dealings with the
party at 553 Mayfield house on Satur
day night, Feb. 20.
Two officers approached the house
during the party and waited patiently
outside to speak with the resident as
sistant and party monitors. They were
forthright in telling us that no com
plaints had been received, and cour
teously offered us their services, stress
ing that they were available to help
should we need any assistance.
They emphasized that, should there
be any problems with the party, they
would like to help house residents
handle it internally rather than enter
ing the party themselves. Fortunately,
the party continued without incident
and police assistance was unnecessary.

These actions are in sharp contrast
with the occurances at the ATO party
on Jan. 23.
While both parties were very similar
in theme and size, checking ID's at the
553 party and having two gentlemanly
officers casually approach the front
door was by no means the fiasco that
took place at the ATO party, where
five police officers were less than con
genial in escalating the matter of a
"noise complaint" at 12:15 a.m. into
threats of arresting the house manage
ment for procedures in serving alcohol.
The police presented themselves in a
calm, helpful manner at 553 and pro
vided reassurance to party monitors,
for which we are most appreciative.
Wouldn't it be ideal if the police's
actions at 553 Mayfield could be a
model for their dealing with all stu
dent parties?
