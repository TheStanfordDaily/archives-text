# Prize immaterial to Arias peace plan
## 
### 
In a Feb. 25 article, I was quoted
regarding the Arias Peace Plan. I feel
that what was printed misrepresents
what I said.
I was asked what I thought were the
repercussions to the Ralston Prize
awarded by the Stanford Law School
to Arias, given the fact that the nego
tiations between the Sandinistas and
the contras had broken down.
My answer was that I feel the Arias
Peace Plan stands on its own merits,
and therefore it is immaterial whether
the Ralston Prize has been awarded to
Arias or when that prize will be pre
sented.
I also stated that I feel the Arias
Peace Plan has little chance of success
as long as the Reagan Administration

is committed to supporting the Con
tras.
