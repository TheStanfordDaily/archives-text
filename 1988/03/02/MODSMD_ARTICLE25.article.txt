## Help foreign students 
### 
IS IT POSSIBLE for a Stanford
student to take Calculus 41 with
out ever have taken algebra?
I think not.
However, in a Feb. 10 cover story
concerning English for foreign stu
dents, it was shown that the English
department today permits a much
similar error to occur.
Students who write in English as a
foreign language are presently forced
into the regular freshman English
classes without any special form of
assistance. In response to this problem,
the University will hire minority tutors
to educate present instructors and an
optional linguistics class will be set up
in the spring to supplement freshman
English.
Despite these changes, foreign stu
dents will continue to struggle through
grammar and syntax while falling
behind in the classes. They will feel
comfortable with what they know of
the language and will not be pushed to
master it.
It is true that a foreigner can get
through a freshman English class
without knowing the language perfect
ly, unlike a calculus student who has
never taken algebra.
However, we must see the similar
struggles each student would have.
Foreign students who do not have a
firm grasp of the language are
frustrated because of their inability to
express themselves and in turn are
embarrassed by fellow students and
instructors.

A special class should be taught
autumn quarter as a prerequisite for
freshman English for foreign students
so that they can have a head start
when they are thrust into the regular
English class.
Freshman English instructor, Greg
Sarris, claims that the existence of the
class "assumes that the student is the
problem."
Well, the student is in fact the
problem. It is the student who cannot
relate himself well in English. He has
the obligation to learn English while
attending an American university.
We cannot ignore the fact that many
students here at Stanford have very
weak writing skills and that they are
in need of help. The University is
aware of the existing dilemma and is
will now "actively recruit minority
tutors" to train the freshman English
instructors.
I agree that the "enlightened" in
structors will pacify most pains foreign
students encounter in an English class,
but the students will now feel more
comfortable in the class while still
lacking the knowledge of numerous
grammar rules.
Where will they be pushed to learn
the essential skills of writing?
The creation of the new optional
linguistics class in the spring will help
the foreign students by concentrating
on grammar; however, it should be
taught autumn quarter as a prere
quisite for regular freshman English.
Also, an essay type test should be

developed here to test a foreigner's
ability to write. All students who score
low on this test or on the Test of
English as a Foreign Language should
be required to take the linguistics
class.
A thorough knowledge of the English
language is important to every student
here at Stanford. Many foreign stu
dents are math and science oriented
and are able to succeed without a firm
grasp of the language. To fully receive
what Stanford has to offer, the English
language must be mastered.
"Englightened" instructors alone will
not help foreigners learn the language.
We need to teach those who have
missed out on a solid English educa
tion as soon as they enroll here.
If a better understanding of the
language is needed, then it should be
learned first before prodding ahead
into freshman English.
After all, we have to learn to crawl
before we can walk.
