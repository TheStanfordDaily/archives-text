## Lyons' stance on frats hard to take seriously 
### 
DO YOU HAVE a hard time
taking seriously Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons' proselytiz
ing on the evils of a "wet" fraternity
Rush? Don't worry — you're not
supposed to take it seriously.
Lyons claims that fraternities are
"hell bent on shooting themselves in
the foot" because they host parties at
which minors can easily obtain alcohol.
The obvious solution to this problem is
a dry Rush.
But what of the plethora of non
fraternity parties at which alcohol is
served? How often do they check your
California Driver's License at The
Suites or in Flo Mo? How often, in
fact, do they even bother to check your
Stanford I.D. or room key? Much more
infrequently than the fraternities, I
would argue. So are these campus
housing groups also "hell-bent on
shooting themselves in the foot?" What
would Lyons suggest to remedy this
problem?
Lyons also claims that a wet frater
nity Rush is "the height of stupidity"
because fraternities that insist on
hosting wet rush parties will soon find
that, because of the emphasis on alco
hol, "no one will show up."
Quite to the contrary. It was
precisely the presence of alcohol that
pulled many of my friends and myself

out of our freshman dorms and up to
the fraternities where we have spent
the past two and a half years.
Most fraternities find that a majority
of their members came to Rush parties
simply to "explore," and found that
they liked what they saw. Alcohol is a
valuable tool in encouraging this explo
ration.
To this argument Lyons might
counter: "What about the fraternities
which currently have dry Rush and
still attract large numbers of new
members?"
If you stop by in the waning hours
of many of their rush parties, you'll
find no one home. Why? Because
members and rushees alike have all
run off to a local bar for a few beers.
If these arguments seem obvious,
they are. Lyons knows they are. The
fact of the matter is, three weeks of
dry rush would result in fewer rus
hees, fewer pledges and, in the long
run, fewer housed fraternities.
All that would be just fine with the
University. Dean Lyons can't realisti
cally present this argument, however.
He wouldn't want to shoot himself in
the foot.
