## Bug muses on lugers and flying camels 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
With finals week approaching
quickly, it seema appropriate to
offer a little quiz about honor code
violations. Simply read the ques
tion below and guess what puni
tive action University President
Donald Kennedy decided to take:
Situation: A student submits a
plagiarized term paper in a class.
Upon closer examination it is dis
covered that he has copied the
paper from a book written by the
professor of the class. In fact, he
hasn't even copied it into his own
handwriting but simply photo
copied it straight from a book.
What do you think Don Ken
nedy did in this situation?
Answer: Don fired the professor
and gave the student tenure at a
far lower salary. "We can keep
University costs down this way,"
said Kennedy at a news confer
ence to introduce the new profes
sor.

Please remember to send you
questions to Bug Me, Stanford
Daily, Storke Bldg, Stanford, CA,
94305, or via LOTS to Bug-Me
(not B.Bug-Me) at the Tragedies,
unless of course you are one of
the new Dollies, in which case
you can simply bring them by my
room any ol' time you like.
Dear Bug,
Now then, does Debi Thomas
really go to this school? Someone
said she has been taking incom

pletes in every class for two years.
And what exactly is a "pre-med"
major? Do we also have a pre-law
major?
Let's hear it — up close and
personal.
— A no knee moose.
No, Debi Thomas doesn't really
go to this school; it's just a das
tardly plot by the Admissions of
fice to trick lots of figure skaters
into applying.
But seriously, flakes, of course
Debi Thomas goes to this school.
She has been stopped-out this
year to train for the Olympics.
What may have you confused is
the fact that she has been training
at Colorado, and has been taking
some college classes there just to
keep her hand in it. However,
these classes haven't been of the
pre-med type, but mostly in sports
medicine and (so she can tell
Katarina where to stick her flying
camel) German.
As for whether she has been
taking incompletes in every class
for two years, all I can say is that
I had a class with her last year
and she most certainly did not
get an incomplete. If you're lis
tening, Debi, I've penciled you in
to see "Action Jackson" with me
a week from Friday.
Last time I checked Deb was
mgyoring in Medical Microbiology,
so you Hum Bio folks can breathe
easier now that you know she
isn't going to come back from the
Olympics and take out her
frustrations on y'all by throwing
off the curve.
Finally, Stanford does not have
a pre-law mtyor, so I would rec
ommend that all you prospective
lawyers mqjor in Drama. After all,
what more does a laywer do than
get up in front of an audience
(the jury) and perform great
soliloquies such as "Where for art
thou Romeo?" or "How can you
in good faith send my client to
the electric chair when clearly he
deserves to face a firing squad
instead?"
Dear Bug,
Maybe it's just because I'm not

from a cold climate, but I just
find the winter Olympics really
boring and stupid. Maybe it's be
cause 1 don't understand half of
what'B going on except for hockey.
Can you explain what all the ex
citement is about?
— Jim McKay
Well, Jim, the winter Olympics
have ended for this year, but it's
never too late to learn all about
those exciting nordic, alpine and
ice-bound sports which you'll be
seeing every four years on ABC.
This year's Olympics were held
in Calgary, Alberta, a quaint town
in western Canada where every
one walks around wearing cowboy
hats and says stuff like "Parlez
vous francais y'all, eh?"
Californians' Guide to the
Olympics:
Luge (from the French word
meaning "This contraption has no
steering wheel") is a sport where
one or two men or women lie on
a small sled and carren down a
mountain at close to the speed of
light.
This is similar to a sport which
we used to play when I was a
child known as "sledding," in
which we would careen down a
mountain on a small piece of plas
tic and steer by running into
trees.
However the word "sled" can
not be used for the luge, because
"sledding" is a term used only for
the bobsled. The bobsled (literally,
"Bob's sled," named for the in
ventor of the sport, Bob) is a go
cart on skates that hurls down
the same mountain path as the
luge. The bobsled has two or four
passengers. The one in front, the
"driver," is responsible for seeing
that the bobsled stays in Calgary.
The other passengers, the "pas
sengers," are responsible for
remaining alive.
The biathlon is a sport in which
an athlete skis cross-country for
a great distance and then takes
a gun off of his back and shoots
at little targets. The history of

this sport goes back to old Scan
dinavia where it was necessary
for primitive people to ski great
distances and then shoot at little
targets. The biathlon is not to be
confused with that summer sport,
the triathlon, which is a contest
in which athletes swim two miles,
run ten miles and shoot at little
targets.
Figure skating is one of the
most beautiful events of the win -
ter Olympics. The competition is
composed of three parts.
The first part is the compulsive
figures. Skaters are required to
trace figure-eights into the ice
while binging on Oreos and saying
"Oh look what this is doing to
my thighs."
Next comes the short program,

where skaters are required to per
form seven different moves in
cluding the axel, the cam shaft,
the flying camel, the landing
rhino, the triple toe-loop, the
three-toed tree sloth and the Sit
'n Spin.
Finally, the competition cli
maxes with the freestyle program,
in which skaters perform to a
piece of music such as Bizet's
"Carmen" or Carmen's "I Wanna
Hear It From Your Lips." In this
competition the skaters are given
two sets of scores, one for tech
nical merit and one for how
fabulous the costume looks.
Ski jumping is a sport which
requires the precision of a brain
surgeon and the strength of a
brain surgeon. There are two va

rieties of ski jumping, the 70 me
ter and the 90 meter. These
heights are given in meters be
cause if they were to call it the
"296 foot ski jump" nobody in
their right mind would do it.
In ski jumping the athlete races
down a ramp on a pair of wide
skis and then flies into the air off
the end of the ramp. While in the
air the jumper is affected by such
factors as wind, barometric pres
sure and stray bullets from
nearby moose hunters. The
preferred landing is with the legs
split, one in front and one behind.
This landing is known as
or "Phone solic
itation."

Bug Me will appear next Wednes
day in the Dead Week issue.
