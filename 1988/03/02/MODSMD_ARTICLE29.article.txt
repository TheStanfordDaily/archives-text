Mia's dining tip for the week:
My choice for the coziest eatery in town is
definitely Hobee's (67 Town and Country Vil
lage or 4224 El Camino Real). My advice is
forget about breakfast — you can't beat
Hobee's for dinner. A soothing cup of
cinnamon-orange tea, a veggie omelet, and
some amazing blueberry coffee cake for dessert
makes a very satisfying Dead Week meal. And
on that note...
"Put on your red shoes and dance:"
Thursday is "Album Giveaway Night" at
the Vortex (260 California Av) — the first 25
patrons will receive a recent free album or
12-inch. On Friday and Saturday you can
dance 'til 4 a.m. and beat the studying blues.
Eat, drink and be merry:
Tonight is "All You Can Eat Pizza Night"
at the Stanford Pub and Grill. For just $3
between 5 and 9 p.m., you can truly indulge.
Stick around for awhile and enjoy "$1 Corona
Nite" beginning at 9 p.m.
A Different Kind of Dance:
Pilobolus, the innovative dance company,
returns to Stanford courtesy of the Lively
Arts. This unique form of acrobatic, structural
and fantasy dance is being performed in
Memorial Auditorium tonight through March
5, at 8 p.m. Tickets are available at the Tres
idder Ticket Office.
A Capella a la Dead Week:
My very favorite male singing group, the
Mendicants, will be performing their tradi
tional Meyer Library concert, Monday at 10
pm in the lobby.
Last Call for Espresso:
Don't miss your last chance this quarter for
great coffee, pastries and live music at the
Espresso Bar in the I-Center. It's open Friday
night from 9 until midnight.
For Seniors Only:
Don't miss Senior Pub Night, this Thursday
at the Oasis.
