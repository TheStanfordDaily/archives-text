### Bruce LcDesma Staff writer 
Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Norman Wessells an
nounced yesterday he will leave
his post August 1 to become
provost and vice president for ac
ademic affairs at the University
of Oregon.
"I've been here since 1962, and
I've enjoyed the place immense
ly," Wessells said yesterday. "But
after a while its good for people
and institutions to move around
a bit."
University Provost James
Rosse said he will move quickly
to appoint a search committee to
find a successor to Wessells. Ac
cording to University President
Donald Kennedy, one of Wessells'
current associate deans may be
considered for the position. How
ever, Kennedy declined to specify
which associate dean was under
consideration. "I think there are
some good internal candidates,"
he said.
Wessells said he looks forward
to his new job at Oregon. "I find
the idea of going into public ed
ucation challenging," he said.
"And the University of Oregon
has the right combination of
things: excellent faculty and
facilities and a strong undergrad
uate program and professional
schools."
Kennedy called Wessells "a
really close personal friend for 27
years," adding that his departure
"is sad for me and our colleagues."
"He is really all the things a
faculty person here should be,"
Kennedy said. "He's been willing
to take on jobs no one else has.

He's been a terrific dean."
Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich said
Oregon was "lucky to snare such
a prize. Norm has always been
very sensitive to big issues in
academia — it's too bad that we're
losing someone with his vision."
The 55-year-old Wessells, who
is also a professor of biology, be
came a full professor in 1971, as
sociate dean of Humanities and
Sciences in 1977 and dean in
1981.
He was one of three top candi
dates selected in a year-long na
tional search by the University of
Oregon to fill its provost position.
In 1973, Wessells, who taught
a popular vertebrate biology
course here, received the Walter
J. Gores award for excellence in
teaching. "More than anything
else, I'll miss teaching that


Norman Wessells
course," he said.
Widely recognized for his im
portant research on how the
shape of cells changes during de
velopment, Wessells is the author
of numerous articles and books.

According to Wessells, Oregon
offers "excellent facilities for
developmental biology and
neurobiology."
"I didn't leave because I was
unhappy at all," he said. "I will
miss this place and my friends
immensely."
The dean of Humanities and
Sciences oversees 28 departments,
12 interdepartmental programs,
and about 460 faculty.
