# Fiscal Fidelity
## Buying the best records to fit a limited budget 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Welcome to The Daily's latest en
tertainment feature. We will recom
mend the best new releases and record
buys so that you will not have to risk
acquiring a real clunker in this era of
lackluster recordings dressed up with
a slick production that masquerade as
masterpieces.
To make life easier, Tower Records
in Mountain View will be our refer
ence, as it consistently markets the
widest variety of music at the most
reasonable prices and the employees
usually seem to know what's going on
in the music world.
Though some recordings will be sug
gested in the compact disc format, this
is not a ploy to alienate audiophiles
who have yet to get a CD player or
rue the whole concept of digital sound.
Rather, CDs are recommended for re
leases that benifit the extra fidelity
that digital sound affords; however,
the LP or cassette would suffice as
well.
Without further delay, the recom
mendations: The Dream Academy's

"Remembrance Days" (LP/Cassette,
8.44) — Reviewed previously in The
Daily, this is one of the most pleasant
albums released in months. From the
first note through the last, the follow
up to the band's self-titled debut al
bum will not disappoint die-hard fans
or anyone who eryoyed the top-10 hit
"Life in a Northern Town." Quite sim
ply, a gem.
Steve Winwood's "Chronicles" (Com
pact Disc, 12.99) — Riding on the suc
cess of last year's critically-acclaimed
mega-hit album "Back in the High
Life," Win wood gives his new-found
fans a chance to sample his earlier
work in revitalized renditions. The
result is a thoroughly enjoyable col
lection that puts the artist's career in
better perspective.
Icehouse's "Crazy" (7" Single, 1.66)
— Though Iva Davies and the boys
haven't exactly put Icehouse on the
tip of America's tongues in the past
few years, the Australian band might
just do that with this song. A zesty
tune seemingly written with Woody
Allen in mind, "Crazy" provides a
great showcase for Davies' smooth vo

cal style. "You've got to be crazy,
baby...."
Depeche Mode's "Behind the Wheel"
(7" Single, 1.66) — The latest release
from the premier synth-rock band,
played to death in January on Live
105 but nonetheless worth having.
Depeche Mode takes a departure form
its regularly-structured format on its

latest album "Music for the Masses,"
and though most of the album belongs
in a trash compactor, "Wheel" is an
enjoyable piece of work.
Elton John's "Candle in the Wind"
(7" Single, 1.66) — Alright, I know
Elton represents commercialism to the
max, but this little ditty is most pleas
ant. Trust me!
