## Mary's serves up burgers, veggies

Hamburger Mary's Organic Grill
1582 Folsom
San Francisco
626-5767

Mary's, at first, appears rather
gloomy and imposing, an impres
sion accentuated by the odd col
lection of foliage on the front side
walk. But the interior is dark and
casual, almost pub-like.
We had a surprisingly long wait
— 15 to 20 minutes — for a late
Sunday evening, although per
haps not an unreasonable one for
a party of five. There was plenty
of comfortable space at the bar,
however, and the service was
pleasantly attentive.
The menu, of course, stars a

plethora of tempting hamburger
options, ranging from the basic
Hamburger Mary to the Ham
burger Mary with bacon or the
Meaty Mushroom with cheese.
Prices are all very reasonable:
$3.95 for the basic burger and
$5.25 for the specialty burgers.
The kitchen also serves a mean
chili as well as excellent home
fries made with onions and black
pepper.
Admittedly, occasions for my in
dulgence in hamburgers are few
and far between. And after an
afternoon of all-you-can-eat ribs
at the Boathouse on Lake Merced,
I figured I'd had enough choles
terol for one day.
So, I exerted my will on the
surprisingly substantive vegetar
ian portion of the menu, and

opted for the mushroom and
cheese sandwich. Needless to say,
my selection drew jeers from my
more carniverous dining com
panions.
But I was not disappointed
when my dinner (quickly) arrived.
Served on whole wheat bread (as
were all the entrees) and sporting
pickles and fresh tomatoes on the
side, my sandwich of plump, quar
tered mushrooms and melted
cheddar hit the spot.
Since I was in a hamburger
joint, I took the liberty of sam
pling my companions' dishes —
the Hamburger Mary and the
Mary with cheese — which were
all equally excellent. The end bill,
Anchor Steam included,
amounted to a very moderate $7
per person.
