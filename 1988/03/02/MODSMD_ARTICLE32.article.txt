# 177-pounder Perry makes NCAA meet
## 
### Gordon Stephenson Staff writer 
Nine Stanford varsity wrestlers
entered the Pacific 10 Confer
ence meet at Fullerton State
last weekend.
However, when the dust
cleared, only one Cardinal grap
pler had endured the competi-

tion and qualified for the NCAA tournament.
Sophomore Ron Perry, who had compiled a
19-9-0 record going into the tournament,
finished third in the 177-pound weight bracket
to secure his spot in the national meet which
will be held in two weeks.
After winning in the first round of the tour
nament, Perry lost to Paul Reutzel of Fullerton
State 4-2 to drop into the consolation bracket.
After sitting out a round with a "bye," Perry
scored 5-2 and 8-6 wins before entering the
consolation finals.

Mclntyre still retains a chance
at making the NCAAs as the
first alternate in the Pac-10.

To qualify for the NCAAs, a wrestler must
place in the top three at the Pac-10's, or be
voted to receive one of four wildcard bids.
Perry won his final match against Boise State's
grappler to finish third and guarantee his
ticket to the lowa tournament.
Senior 190-pound captain Terry Mclntyre
finished fourth and did not receive a wildcard
spot. However, Mclntyre still retains a chance
at making NCAAs as the first alternate in the
Pac-10. If any one of the top three finishers
in any weight bracket or one of the wildcards
becomes injured the next two weeks, Mclntyre
will be able to make the trip.
Mclntyre is the only member of this season's
starting squad who is graduating in June. All
of the other wrestlers are freshmen and soph
omores who still have years of eligibility left.
