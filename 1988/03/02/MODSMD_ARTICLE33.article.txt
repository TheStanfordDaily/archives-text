## Card scores less-than-perfect 10 Baseball up 8-1 before holding on for 10-9 win 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Welcome to the wonderful and wacky
world of non-conference baseball,
chock full o' hits, runs and errors.
Like pro wrestling and demolition
derbies, it ain't pretty, but it's fun.
Stanford and San Jose State en
gaged in a little non-conference

hijinks yesterday at Sunken Diamond, and this one
was a real roller coaster.
The Spartans spotted Stanford an 8-1 lead, came
roaring back to tie the game 8-8, then traded runs
with the No. 3 Cardinal until Stanford emerged
with a 10-9 victory to extend its winning streak to
nine games.
Stanford, now 14-5 overall and 2-0 in Pacific 10
Southern Division play, next plays at 2 p.m. Friday
at Sunken Diamond in the first game of a three
game Six-Pac series with UCLA. Saturday's game,
which will be televised live by ESPN, is at 11 a.m.,
with the third game of the series scheduled for 1
p.m. Sunday.
The Cardinal scored early and often yesterday
against Spartan starter Robert Sapp, tallying four
runs in the first and another four in the third to
go up 8-1.
Sophomore designated hitter Tim Griffin, making
only his second start of the season, delivered key
hits in both innings, singling sharply to left in the
first to score Doug Robbins and Ron Witmeyer,
then singling in the third to bring in Witmeyer
again.
Meanwhile, Stanford starter Stan Spencer, a
freshman from Vancouver, Wash., was shutting
down the Spartans, giving up only one run through
four innings.
In the fifth, Brian Keyser replaced Spencer, who
missed a start when Sunday's game at USC was
rained out and was using this game as a workout.
Keyser had trouble, though, giving up a base on
balls, two singles, a sacrifice fly, another single and
a three-run home run by John Bracken (the Spar
tans' first home run of the year). Suddenly the
score was 8-6. An inning later, with two men on,
Andy Coan tripled into the right-field corner to
knot the score at 8-8.
The tie didn't last long. In the Cardinal half of
the sixth, Paul Carey singled up the middle, and

Steve Chitren struck out four en route to his first win of the season in Stanford's 10-9 victory over
San Jose State yesterday. Chitren, who pitched 3 1/3 innings, already has five saves on the year.
