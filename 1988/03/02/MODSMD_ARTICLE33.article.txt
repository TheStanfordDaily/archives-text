## Card scores less-than-perfect 10 Baseball up 8-1 before holding on for 10-9 win 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Welcome to the wonderful and wacky
world of non-conference baseball,
chock full o' hits, runs and errors.
Like pro wrestling and demolition
derbies, it ain't pretty, but it's fun.
Stanford and San Jose State en
gaged in a little non-conference

hijinks yesterday at Sunken Diamond, and this one
was a real roller coaster.
The Spartans spotted Stanford an 8-1 lead, came
roaring back to tie the game 8-8, then traded runs
with the No. 3 Cardinal until Stanford emerged
with a 10-9 victory to extend its winning streak to
nine games.
Stanford, now 14-5 overall and 2-0 in Pacific 10
Southern Division play, next plays at 2 p.m. Friday
at Sunken Diamond in the first game of a three
game Six-Pac series with UCLA. Saturday's game,
which will be televised live by ESPN, is at 11 a.m.,
with the third game of the series scheduled for 1
p.m. Sunday.
The Cardinal scored early and often yesterday
against Spartan starter Robert Sapp, tallying four
runs in the first and another four in the third to
go up 8-1.
Sophomore designated hitter Tim Griffin, making
only his second start of the season, delivered key
hits in both innings, singling sharply to left in the
first to score Doug Robbins and Ron Witmeyer,
then singling in the third to bring in Witmeyer
again.
Meanwhile, Stanford starter Stan Spencer, a
freshman from Vancouver, Wash., was shutting
down the Spartans, giving up only one run through
four innings.
In the fifth, Brian Keyser replaced Spencer, who
missed a start when Sunday's game at USC was
rained out and was using this game as a workout.
Keyser had trouble, though, giving up a base on
balls, two singles, a sacrifice fly, another single and
a three-run home run by John Bracken (the Spar
tans' first home run of the year). Suddenly the
score was 8-6. An inning later, with two men on,
Andy Coan tripled into the right-field corner to
knot the score at 8-8.
The tie didn't last long. In the Cardinal half of
the sixth, Paul Carey singled up the middle, and

Steve Chitren struck out four en route to his first win of the season in Stanford's 10-9 victory over
San Jose State yesterday. Chitren, who pitched 3 1/3 innings, already has five saves on the year.

Ed Sprague homered to left to
put Stanford back on top, 10-8.
It was Sprague's fifth homer of
the season.
The Spartans' Bracken an
swered in the seventh with his
second home run of the game,
this one off Steve Chitren, to
make the score 10-9.
The game wouldn't have been
complete without some more ex
citement. Fernando Viera led off
the Spartan ninth with a high
chopper behind the mound. Car
dinal shortstop Troy Paulsen
gloved the ball but threw it past
first baseman Witmeyer and Viera
ended up at second.
After Chitren walked Bracken,
it was first and second with no
outs. The next batter, Damon
Castillo, tried to lay down a
sacrifice bunt, but Chitren fielded
the ball well and cut down the
runner going to third. Greg
Mitchell grounded back to Chitren
before Chitren caught Kelly Coan
(Andy's twin brother) looking at
a third strike to close the game.
Chitren recorded the victory to
go 1-1 on the year with five saves.

He went 3 V3 innings, his second
longest outing of the season,
walked one, struck out four and
gave up four hits, three of which
were infield singles.
Chitren said the length of his
outing wasn't a problem. "I was
a little surprised when they had
me up throwing in the sixth (in
ning), but that's nothing I feel I
can't handle."
"I didn't have real good stuff,"
he said, "But I was able to throw
the big strike. . . .They're not a
real good hitting team, but our
pitchers struggled. We couldn't
throw our breakers (breaking
pitches) for strikes, and walked a
few more guys than we would
have liked to."
Card notes
Witmeyer continued his resurgent
hitting, going two-for-three with a
triple (his first of the season to go
with five doubles and two home runs),
two RBI and two runs scored.
The Cardinal finished with 12 hits.
In its last seven games, the team is
averaging over 12 hits a game.
The nine-game winning streak is
three short of the school record. The
1980 Cardinal opened the season with
12 straight wins, then went on to
finish 29-24, the worst record in
Coach Mark Marquess's 11-year
career at Stanford. Last year's na
tional championship team had win
streaks of 10 and 11 games.

Meanwhile, Stanford starter Stan Spencer, a
freshman from Vancouver, Wash., was shutting
down the Spartans, giving up only one run through
four innings.
In the fifth, Brian Keyser replaced Spencer, who
missed a start when Sunday's game at USC was
rained out and was using this game as a workout.
Keyser had trouble, though, giving up a base on
balls, two singles, a sacrifice fly, another single and
a three-run home run by John Bracken (the Spar
tans' first home run of the year). Suddenly the
score was 8-6. An inning later, with two men on,
Andy Coan tripled into the right-field corner to
knot the score at 8-8.
The tie didn't last long. In the Cardinal half of
the sixth, Paul Carey singled up the middle, and

Steve Chitren struck out four en route to his first win of the season in Stanford's 10-9 victory over
San Jose State yesterday. Chitren, who pitched 3 1/3 innings, already has five saves on the year.

Ed Sprague homered to left to
put Stanford back on top, 10-8.
It was Sprague's fifth homer of
the season.
The Spartans' Bracken an
swered in the seventh with his
second home run of the game,
this one off Steve Chitren, to
make the score 10-9.
The game wouldn't have been
complete without some more ex
citement. Fernando Viera led off
the Spartan ninth with a high
chopper behind the mound. Car
dinal shortstop Troy Paulsen
gloved the ball but threw it past
first baseman Witmeyer and Viera
ended up at second.
After Chitren walked Bracken,
it was first and second with no
outs. The next batter, Damon
Castillo, tried to lay down a
sacrifice bunt, but Chitren fielded
the ball well and cut down the
runner going to third. Greg
Mitchell grounded back to Chitren
before Chitren caught Kelly Coan
(Andy's twin brother) looking at
a third strike to close the game.
Chitren recorded the victory to
go 1-1 on the year with five saves.

He went 3 V3 innings, his second
longest outing of the season,
walked one, struck out four and
gave up four hits, three of which
were infield singles.
Chitren said the length of his
outing wasn't a problem. "I was
a little surprised when they had
me up throwing in the sixth (in
ning), but that's nothing I feel I
can't handle."
"I didn't have real good stuff,"
he said, "But I was able to throw
the big strike. . . .They're not a
real good hitting team, but our
pitchers struggled. We couldn't
throw our breakers (breaking
pitches) for strikes, and walked a
few more guys than we would
have liked to."
Card notes
Witmeyer continued his resurgent
hitting, going two-for-three with a
triple (his first of the season to go
with five doubles and two home runs),
two RBI and two runs scored.
The Cardinal finished with 12 hits.
In its last seven games, the team is
averaging over 12 hits a game.
The nine-game winning streak is
three short of the school record. The
1980 Cardinal opened the season with
12 straight wins, then went on to
finish 29-24, the worst record in
Coach Mark Marquess's 11-year
career at Stanford. Last year's na
tional championship team had win
streaks of 10 and 11 games.
Welcome to the wonderful and wacky
world of non-conference baseball,
chock full o' hits, runs and errors.
Like pro wrestling and demolition
derbies, it ain't pretty, but it's fun.
Stanford and San Jose State en
gaged in a little non-conference

hijinks yesterday at Sunken Diamond, and this one
was a real roller coaster.
The Spartans spotted Stanford an 8-1 lead, came
roaring back to tie the game 8-8, then traded runs
with the No. 3 Cardinal until Stanford emerged
with a 10-9 victory to extend its winning streak to
nine games.
Stanford, now 14-5 overall and 2-0 in Pacific 10
Southern Division play, next plays at 2 p.m. Friday
at Sunken Diamond in the first game of a three
game Six-Pac series with UCLA. Saturday's game,
which will be televised live by ESPN, is at 11 a.m.,
with the third game of the series scheduled for 1
p.m. Sunday.
The Cardinal scored early and often yesterday
against Spartan starter Robert Sapp, tallying four
runs in the first and another four in the third to
go up 8-1.
Sophomore designated hitter Tim Griffin, making
only his second start of the season, delivered key
hits in both innings, singling sharply to left in the
first to score Doug Robbins and Ron Witmeyer,
then singling in the third to bring in Witmeyer
again.
