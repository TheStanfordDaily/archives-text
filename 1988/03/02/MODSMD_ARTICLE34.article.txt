# Golfers fall in paradise
## Men host Minnesota today after slipping to 18th 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The sunny island
of Oahu is a
paradise for most,
but the Stanford
men's golf team
found out Friday
that even in a land

of vast natural beauty, human
beings are still flawed. After start
ing out well in the first two days
of the John Burns Invitational,
the team faltered the last day,
Finishing 18th out of 26 teams.
The Cardinal gets right back in
action today with a rare home
match against Minnesota at the
Stanford Golf Course.
Given the quality of the field
in Hawaii, with seven nationally
ranked teams including defending
national champion Oklahoma
State, the Cardinal did not expect
to finish in the top echelon. In
the final tally, the Cowboys won
the tournament with 853 total
strokes, with Arkansas and USC
following at 861 and 862 strokes
respectively.
Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin
set a goal of 12th to 15th place
for his team, a mark that the
golfers were able to attain during
the first two rounds of the tour
nament. But in the end, they
could not hold their standing.
Goodwin, though disappointed,
did not lay the blame completely
on his players. According to him,
UC-Santa Barbara, Washington
and New Mexico played great golf
in the final round, while the Car
dinal carded merely average
scores.
With their surge in the final
round, Washington and New
Mexico finished the tournament
tied for 15th at 900 strokes. UCSB
took 17th with 904 strokes, just
ahead of Stanford, which recorded
907 shots for the 54-hole tourna
ment.
Mike Hubly and Chris Weyand
were Stanford's low individual
scorers. After a difficult first
round, Hubly came back with
scores of 73 and 74 in the last
two rounds to shoot 227, while
Weyand played a solid tourna
ment all around, shooting 75 the
last day for a three-round total
of 227.
Mark Funseth struggled a bit
in the final 18 holes and shot 79,
good enough for third among
Stanford golfers and a tourna
ment score of 228.
If there was one hole at the
Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course that
spelled disaster for the golfers, it
was the 13th. The long par-4
played downwind in the last day

Overall, the team
simply did not
score well.

of the tournament, but the five
Stanford golfers scored one bogey,
two double bogeys and two triple
bogeys.
Overall, the team simply did not
score well. Goodwin said that
having to count scores of 78 and
79 in the second round "kills you.
It's not even Division I golf."
But Goodwin did not fault the
team's work ethic, pointing out
that most of his players practiced
even after their tournament
rounds.
There were a few bright spots
for the team last week. Since the
top 18 teams from the year before
automatically qualify to go back
to Hawaii next year, the Cardi

nal's eighteenth place finish as
sures the golf team of a spot in
next year's tournament.
Also, that the team was paired
with UCLA on the last day by
virtue of its scoring the first two
rounds shows that the team "has
made a lot of improvement from
last year," according to sopho
more Brad Joondeph.
But the most encouraging news
from Hawaii has to be the emer
gence of Chris Weyand as a solid
scorer for the team. A sophomore
walk-on, "nobody knew of
(Weyand) until November. He's a
real shot in the arm for us," Joon
deph said.
Goodwin added his praise for
Weyand to that for Mike Hubly,
who has been a key player for the
team in his last three starts,
finishing second in the UC-Davis
Invitational and tying for first in
Hawaii. "I'm especially glad for
(Weyand and Hubly) because they
usually don't get much limelight."
