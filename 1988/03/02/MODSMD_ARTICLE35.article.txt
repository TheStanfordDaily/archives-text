If only our arch-rivals always fell
over so easily. . .
Stanford's men's volleyball
squad had little trouble disposing
of California's young club team
Sunday, winning at Harmon Gym
in three straight games, 15-10, 15-

12, 15-6.
"We had a good trip," Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. "I was pleased with our play."
And indeed he should be. In a match the Car
dinal could easily have let down in, it did not.
Stanford (now 9-10 overall) really had no trouble
except in the second game, where the team
jumped out to an early lead, but then let the
Golden Bears crawl back to a mere two-point
deficit at 13-11. The decline was certainly due
in part to the presence (not to be confused with
the play) of senior Darryl Rouse.
Rouse, who has just recently become the Car

dinal's second setter, came in after Stanford had
built a commanding lead in the second game,
but the combination of a new lineup and Cal's
improved play brought the Bears back.
"[Rouse] did a real solid job," freshman Mike
Lowe said. "Cal just came on."
Stanford, however, was able to recover in time
to win that game and follow it up with an easy
victory in what turned out to be the deciding
third game.
Lowe, who had only good things to say about
his teammates, certainly deserves some accolades
himself. The freshman, who was given the op
portunity to play in the starting lineup two weeks
ago when Jay Ogas hurt his ankle, has responded
with some outstanding efforts. Not the least of
those was his performance in the Cal match, in
which Sturm said Lowe "played very well."
"We played a solid match," Lowe said, "but it
certainly wasn't our best. They're not a real
powerful team, yet we were unable to pick up
some of their hits in our backcourt."
