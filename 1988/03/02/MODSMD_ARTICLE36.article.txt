# Thomas classy, but ABC...

Final thoughts on the Winter
Olympics:
• Debi Thomas may not have
won the gold medal in figure
skating, but she proved herself a
true champion in the way she
handled defeat.

Thomas spent years and years
training intensely for the Olym
pics, making countless personal
sacrifices in pursuit of the gold
medal, yet she had one of the
worst performances of her career
the final night of competition.
Despite entering the long program
in first place, Thomas had to set
tle for the bronze medal after a
few costly slips in her routine.
Most people wouldn't be too
happy with this turn of events,
and it would have been under
standable had Thomas been upset
with the results. But the Stanford
junior took the disappointment in
stride. "I'm still alive," she said.
"Now I can get on with my life."
The San Jose native didn't shy
away from the press and contin
ued to speak her mind just as
openly as she had before the com
petition. "I don't have any ex
cuses," she said of her perform
ance.

They say that true character is
displayed during times of adver
sity, and Debi Thomas demonstra
ted that she is one strong, classy
woman.
• ABC update: Sunday night,
the network missed Katarina
Witt's final routine in the exhibi
tion skating because they cut —
surprise — to a commercial. Not
that they even bothered to tell us
we'd missed it, of course. They
might get some more criticism,
and we wouldn't want that.
• It's a good thing Peter Jen
nings is a network news anchor
man, because he has no future in
sportscasting. He and Jim McKay
were so syrupy at Sunday's
closing ceremonies it was sicken
ing, and Jennings seemed to have
little idea who was who and what
was going on.
But then again, if ABC will put
McKay and Kathi Lee Gifford
(Frank's wife) on the air, they'll
put on anyone. The Gif Fords' late
night "highlight" show ranks
right up there among the biggest
travesties in sports broadcasting.
First of all, there were rarely
any highlights — kind of a prob
lem for a highlight show. The bulk
of the show was those inane fea
tures ABC kept bombarding us
with.
Then there was Kathi, who
mispronounced names, muddled
events, and seemed to prefer
looking at her husband to looking
at the camera. Nice fireplace,
though.
• Sunday's exhibition skating
was a pleasure to watch, even if
no medals were at stake. With

the pressure off, the athletes gen
erally skated better than they did
in competition. The routines were
also less conservative and more
entertaining — witness Brian Or
ser's soaring backflip, the Soviet
ice dancers' sizzling, sensuous
performance, and the leather-clad
Witt's daring rendition of Michael
Jackson's "Bad."
• Whose idea was it to put
Yankees' owner George Stein
brenner in charge of a committee
to look into the state of the Olym
pics in America? Just the guy for
the job — a man whose name is
synonymous with money, greed,
irrationality, instability and
boorishness.
The entire concept of a com
mittee to look into the "poor" U.S.
showing (six medals) in the Win
ter Olympics is ludicrous. Winter
sports just aren't as popular in
the U.S. as they are in European
countries, and the best athletes
in the U.S. tend to gravitiate
toward the three high-paying pro
fessional sports.
This is the same tired issue that
came up over the state of Amer
ican tennis a few years ago when
John McEnroe's long reign at the
top of the sport came to an end.
Suddenly there was patriotic
panic. Ack! The Germans and the
Czechs are beating us! Help! And
no one even noticed the America'!
Cup races until the U.S. loet to
Australia.
But hey, the Summer Games
in Seoul are coming up, and we
should do better there! And,
mercifully, NBC ia doing the
broadcasts.

put on anyone. The Gif Fords' late
night "highlight" show ranks
right up there among the biggest
travesties in sports broadcasting.
First of all, there were rarely
any highlights — kind of a prob
lem for a highlight show. The bulk
of the show was those inane fea
tures ABC kept bombarding us
with.
Then there was Kathi, who
mispronounced names, muddled
events, and seemed to prefer
looking at her husband to looking
at the camera. Nice fireplace,
though.
• Sunday's exhibition skating
was a pleasure to watch, even if
no medals were at stake. With

the pressure off, the athletes gen
erally skated better than they did
in competition. The routines were
also less conservative and more
entertaining — witness Brian Or
ser's soaring backflip, the Soviet
ice dancers' sizzling, sensuous
performance, and the leather-clad
Witt's daring rendition of Michael
Jackson's "Bad."
• Whose idea was it to put
Yankees' owner George Stein
brenner in charge of a committee
to look into the state of the Olym
pics in America? Just the guy for
the job — a man whose name is
synonymous with money, greed,
irrationality, instability and
boorishness.
The entire concept of a com
mittee to look into the "poor" U.S.
showing (six medals) in the Win
ter Olympics is ludicrous. Winter
sports just aren't as popular in
the U.S. as they are in European
countries, and the best athletes
in the U.S. tend to gravitiate
toward the three high-paying pro
fessional sports.
This is the same tired issue that
came up over the state of Amer
ican tennis a few years ago when
John McEnroe's long reign at the
top of the sport came to an end.
Suddenly there was patriotic
panic. Ack! The Germans and the
Czechs are beating us! Help! And
no one even noticed the America'!
Cup races until the U.S. loet to
Australia.
But hey, the Summer Games
in Seoul are coming up, and we
should do better there! And,
mercifully, NBC ia doing the
broadcasts.
