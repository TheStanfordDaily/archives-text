# Fencers can't avoid whipping Cal
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
In spite of all their
efforts, the Stan
ford men's and
women's fencing
teams just couldn't
keep Saturday's
meet against Cali-

fornia close. In fact, the meet was
hardly respectable.
But not to worry. The Cardinal
fencers had no trouble winning,
but they were challenged trying
to avoid humiliating the troubled
Golden Bear program. With artful
coaching, the men's team man
aged to hold the score down to
18-9, while the women romped to
a 13-3 thrashing of the Golden
Bears.
The meet at Berkeley was the
final regular-season meet for both
the men and women this year,
and the finale meet for four
seniors. Foil fencers Craig Ring
and Chris Gillen, who lead a
strong foil team into next week's
Western Regionals, each won all
their bouts, combining for six of
the foil team's nine wins.
Women's team captain Alex
andra Rankin and Laurel Mend
also ended their Stanford careers
with strong performances, losing
only a single bout between them.
Men's Coach Zoran Tulum was
concerned about the outcome of
Saturday's meet, but not because
he feared losing. Rather, Tulum
hoped for a close meet so that
Cal's club program would show
well against a strong varsity pro
gram, thus aiding their efforts to
gain varsity status and funds.
But Tulum found that the
Bears "were just not as good as
I had expected." The result was
a unique strategy for the Cardi
nal. Tulum not only rotated in
inexperienced fencers, but
shuffled fencers between events
as well.
"I didn't want to win 27-0, so
I moved my guys around to give
their fencers a better chance,"

Tulum said. "As it turned out,
the meet wasn't as close as I had
hoped."
Tulum moved foil fencer Stan
Brobston, a freshman, and team
captain sabre fencer Dave Russ
to the epee event. Epee fencer
Stephen Schmidt ended up fenc
ing in the sabre event. While all
three were unfamiliar with their
"new" weapons, each "kept their
bouts close and challenged their
counterparts," said Tulum.

The women followed a more
conventional strategy towards
their portion of Saturday's com
petition. All four of the team's
regular starters saw action. Alex
andra Rankin won all four of her
bouts, while sophomore Elisabeth
Spilman, slowed by an injured
wrist, went 3-1. Freshman Olivia
Judson also won three of her four
bouts. Tracy Schmidt was 2-0, and
Laurel Mend was 1-1.
Women's coach Sherry Pos

thumus enjoyed this weekend's
meet, saying that the team was
"very relaxed and there was very
little tension." The women spend
the next two weeks preparing for
the Western Regionals on March
12th and 13th.
Tulum added, "We have very
good relations with Berkeley.
They are good hosts and the at
mosphere for the meet was very
enjoyable."
No wonder.
