# Computer science may add ethics classes
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld 
Considerable debate is brewing on
both the national and local level about
whether computer science majors
should be required to study ethics and
how ethics relate to their chosen field.
Professors and students agree that
computer science students should be
taught ethics, but disagree about
whether to require specific classes or
simply include the topic in existing
courses.
Currently, computer science is the
only major in the School of Engineer
ing which does not require students
to take at least one course in Values,
Technology, Science and Society, an
interdisciplinary program which has
courses on ethical issues.
An ethics requirement would add
even more units to a major that, with

94 units of required coursework in
addition to extra prerequisites, is al
ready approaching the University max
imum of 107 units.
Computer science is a relatively new
mÂ£\jor, first instituted 17 months ago,
and the department is "still ex
perimenting about what to require,"
said Prof. Nils Nilson, department
chair.
According to Prof. Stuart Reges,
who was involved in the creation of
the department, because there were
so few choices within the m*\jor, the
creators decided to "give those extra
units to the students," and advise, but
not force, them to take an ethics
course.
There are "more important things
in the curriculum for us to deal with
right now," Reges said, such as the
need to perfect core and introductory

courses.
Both Reges and Nilson agree that
ethics should be taught to computer
science students, but are unsure how
to accomplish this goal. "The impor
tant thing is to instill a sense of ethics
in people," Reges said.
But Reges is "skeptical" that this
goal could be accomplished in one
course. "Requiring a VTSS course
would be a quick fix," he said.
A single, standard lecture course
may not be the best way to teach
ethics, said Terry Winograd, a com
puter science professor now on sab
batical.
Winograd, who is president of Com
puter Professionals for Social Respon
sibility, feels that regardless of how it
may be taught, learning about ethics
should be a required part of the com
puter science Winograd's group

is now working on gathering informa
tion about ethics to assist universities
in developing ethics courses.
Winograd disagreed that there is not
enough room in the to add ethics
classes. Departments need to "make
priorites, learn a little less of one thing.
[Computer science] is not just master
ing a techinique."
Prof. Robert McGinn, associate
chair of VTSS, said ethics should be
a required part of the coursework. "A
course which makes students aware
that they may well confront . . . ques
tions that have an ethical component
to them," would be very useful, he
said.
McGinn pointed to the "phenome
non of whistle blowing [which is] hap
pening with increasing frequency," as
