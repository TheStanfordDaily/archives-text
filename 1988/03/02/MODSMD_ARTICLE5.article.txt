# Panelists question disinvestment policy
## 
### Dave Kunstle 
The University's current
policy of selective disinvest
ment from firms that do busi
ness in South Africa came un
der fire last night from an
ASSU-sponsored panel of stu
dents and faculty members
who agreed that total divest
ment must be introduced to
spark meaningful change in
that country.
The panel also addressed the
University's responsibility to
bring more black South African
students to Stanford and to ed
ucate students about problems
in that country.
Speaking at Kresge
Auditorium, Political Science
Prof. Richard Brodie called the
University's investment
policies "ineffective" because
divestment may only be con
sidered when "a company's ac
tivities are found to cause sub
stantial social injury." Brodie
argued that anything short of
total divestment will have little
effect on South African society.
Responding to Brodie's plea,
Fred Hillier, co-chair of the
Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility, said the CIR is ur
ging the Board of Trustees to
adopt a policy of "total divest
ment."
Although the ClR's long and
bitter battle for such a policy
has met with little success, Hil
lier said he hoped that one day
total divestment could lead to
the eventual withdrawal of
companies from South Africa.

Unless this happens, the
white South African ruling
class has no reason to change
from a system "under which
they benefit tremendously," he
said.
If allowed to continue in its
present form, apartheid will
remain a "self-perpetrating
system" requiring the "power
ful symbolic impact" of a total
withdrawal of foreign invest
ments to bring any immediate
change.
But several panel members
said the University's new
South Africa Education Pro
gram might indirectly improve
the situation in South Africa.
