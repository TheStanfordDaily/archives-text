# Students plan E. Palo Alto voter drive

### Amy Rosenfeld 
Hoping to help secure passage
of a tenants' rights measure in
next month's East Palo Alto city
election, a group of Stanford law
students will conduct a voter reg
istration there beginning next
week.
On March 5 and again on March
12, law students Charic Daniels,
Julie Gutman, Larry Ottinger and
Gary Peck — along with East Palo
Alto Councilman Ruben Abrica,
the East Palo Alto Council of
Tenants and hundreds of volun
teers — will be going door-to-door
in East Palo Alto in an effort to
register voters before the April 14
election.

If passed, the measure —
known as Measure C — could in
crease tenant rights by restricting
the right of landlords to raise
rents.
Abrica, a 1978 Stanford gradu
ate, proposed Measure C, which
states that "any law adopted by
the voters can only be amended
or repealed by the voters." Ac
cording to Gutman, passage of
Measure C would help tenants in
their fight to retain the city's 1986
Rent Control Ordinance.
The Rent Control Ordinance
prevents landlords from increas
ing rents beyond the level of the
Consumer Price Index inflation
rate, allows the continuation of
low income housing, includes

standards for upkeep of housing
and demands good cause for evic
tion.
Over the past year, however,
many landlords have pressured
the city council to repeal the or
dinance. The council is currently
split 3-2 in favor of keeping it. If
elected next month, "new mem
bers could overturn that deci
sion," Gutman warned.
In addition to seeking passage
of Measure C, the group of law
students has set goals of increas
ing "community empowerment,
educating people in East Palo Alto
and encouraging people to be
more active," Gutman said.
A secondary goal of the law stu
dents is to establish stronger links

between Stanford and the East
Palo Alto community. If "students
and residents go into apartment
buildings and see what life is like,
[they willl get a better feel for
the whole situation," Gutman
said.
The group will focus on regis
tering tenants and "low income
people [who] tend to be less rep
resented," Gutman said.
In the past, "tenants have been
very important to elections (in
East Palo)," Daniels said. Al
though the city used to have one
of the highest voter registration
rates in the Bay Area, in recent
years over 4000 names have
