Local or national, it is prime
candidate shopping time, accord
ing to the Stanford Democrats,
who began their big push last
night to muster student involve
ment in 1988 Democratic cam
paigns.
At the "campaign organiza
tional and unity meeting," held
in Tressider, the campus political
group sought to finalize plans for
the upcoming elections.
Junior Subodh Chandra, chair
of the Stanford Democrats, said
the organization's goal is to pro
vide an "umbrella organization"
for local, state, and national elec
tions.
Chandra said the group has set
up a general organizational struc
ture for the spring and is now
looking for individual students to
get involved in the campaigns.

From April 1 to May 9, cam
paign volunteers will work on
voter registration, Chandra said.
From then on, until the June 7
primary election, volunteers will
work to ensure that as many reg
istered Democrats as possible ac
tually come out to the polls.
In order to effectively cover the
12th Congressional District,
which includes Stanford, the
group plans to divide organiza
tional work among vice-city
chairs, precinct captains, and
"units," consisting of five to 10
students who already live close
together. These units will concen
trate on precinct-walking and
phone-banking.
Attorney Sylvia Simmons, who
is currently seeking the Demo
cratic nomination for the 12th
District, was on hand at the
meeting to introduce herself and
to encourage students to get in

volved in a local campaign.
"I've done a lot of precinct
walking this is going to be a
grass roots campaign," Simmons
said.
She said that because the 12th
District is so heavily gerryman
dered in favor of the Republicans
that the Democrats will need a
candidate who appeals to all types
of voters.
"I am the most electable can
didate," she said. "I am a
moderate centrist who can appeal
to Republicans as well as Demo
crats," she added.
Also speaking at the meeting
was Stanford Education Prof.
Martin Carnoy, who ran unsuc
cessfully for the 12th District seat
in 1984. He said he has recently
written a book titled "Schooling
and Work in a Democratic State"
