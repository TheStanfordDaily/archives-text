# Students 'take back the night'
## 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
In a symbolic protest of vio
lence against women, more than
100 men and women partici
pated last night in a "Take Back
the Night March" from the Oval
to White Plaza.
The hour-long march was or
ganized by the 12 women en
rolled in SWOPSI 174, "Issues
in Self-Defense for Women," as
a way to "extend the class's new
found knowledge into the com

munity," according to senior
Debbie Marvil, a student in the
class.
"We are symbolically gather
ing to reclaim the night as a
safe and secure place," said Mar
vil, a psychology iruvjor. "Tradi
tionally the night has been a
time of fear for women. We want
to display our moral outrage that
we cannot walk alone at night."
The group of students, faculty
and staff — some with their
families — traced a path that
passed three sites where women

have been raped or attacked in
past years. The demonstration
ended with a rally in White
Plaza.
In addition to the members of
the two SWOPSI 174 classes,
representatives from the Stan
ford Rape Education Project, the
Stanford Women's Center and
various dormitories gathered in
a show of unity against rape on
campus.
After leaving the Oval, the
candle-bearing group shouted
cheers of unity and protest, and

sang as they passed Herrin Hall
and the Old Chemistry Building
and moved on to the Physics
Tank, where two attempted
rapes occurred last spring during
sorority Rush.
The group then walked into
the Quad and stopped by
Memorial Church, pausing for a
moment of silence in remem
brance of a violent rape that hap
pened there in 1980. After
walking through an unlighted al-

ley behind the Old Firehouse, the marchers
stopped in front of Terman Engineering
Center and the Mitchell Building, where
several attempted rapes have occurred.
At Roble Field, one woman stopped the
group to vent her outrage at not being
able to walk alone at night. "This is a
beautiful night. I shouldn't have to be
afraid to sit out here and enjoy the night,"
said sophomore Jerilyn Lopez-Mendoza, an
organizer of the march and member of the
class. "It pisses me off!"
After walking past Lagunita Court, be
hind Roble Hall and along Lake Lagunita,
the marchers walked past Florence Moore
Hall, where some residents shouted jokes
at the group and others cheered their sup
port.
The rally in White Plaza began with a
poem titled "Privilege," read by senior
Stephanie Teal. "Privilege is simple....
Privilege is sleeping soundly. Privilege is
not remembering dreams of rape following
you all day and waking you up at night."
Senior Laurie Wedemeyer, a community
education coordinator at the Mid-Peninsula

Rape Crisis Center, urged the crowd to
fight violence toward women.
"We sometimes feel that there is nothing
we can do," Wedemeyer said. "We are here
to say it is OK that we fight back. It is
important to know that no one can get to
the inner core of our being and take that
away from us."
According to Wedemeyer, a quarter of
children under the age of 18 are sexually
assaulted and one of three women will be
sexually harassed or assaulted during her
lifetime.
"(This march) is one really positive thing
we can do together," Wedemeyer said.
The "Take Back the Night March" is a
nationwide movement that has gained both
positive and negative reaction over the past
10 years. Last year, a similar march was
held on campus and drew approximately
60 people.
Traditionally, the march has been a con
gregation of women together to show that
women can march at night without the
aid of men.
Ted DesMaisons, the press representa
tive for the Stanford Education Proj
ect, said he at first felt uncomfortable about
participating in and "intruding upon" a
march for women, but said he now feels
it is important for men to take action.

the marchers walked past Florence Moore
Hall, where some residents shouted jokes
at the group and others cheered their sup
port.
The rally in White Plaza began with a
poem titled "Privilege," read by senior
Stephanie Teal. "Privilege is simple....
Privilege is sleeping soundly. Privilege is
not remembering dreams of rape following
you all day and waking you up at night."
Senior Laurie Wedemeyer, a community
education coordinator at the Mid-Peninsula

Rape Crisis Center, urged the crowd to
fight violence toward women.
"We sometimes feel that there is nothing
we can do," Wedemeyer said. "We are here
to say it is OK that we fight back. It is
important to know that no one can get to
the inner core of our being and take that
away from us."
According to Wedemeyer, a quarter of
children under the age of 18 are sexually
assaulted and one of three women will be
sexually harassed or assaulted during her
lifetime.
"(This march) is one really positive thing
we can do together," Wedemeyer said.
The "Take Back the Night March" is a
nationwide movement that has gained both
positive and negative reaction over the past
10 years. Last year, a similar march was
held on campus and drew approximately
60 people.
Traditionally, the march has been a con
gregation of women together to show that
women can march at night without the
aid of men.
Ted DesMaisons, the press representa
tive for the Stanford Education Proj
ect, said he at first felt uncomfortable about
participating in and "intruding upon" a
march for women, but said he now feels
it is important for men to take action.
