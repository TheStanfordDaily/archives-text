## 
### Michael Lenz 
More than one-third of Stan
ford undergraduates and one-half
of graduate students favor adopt
ing a dry rush policy, according
to the latest ASSU straw poll.
The poll also showed that 23.4
percent of students favor the
"Culture, Ideas, and Values" pro
posal to replace Western Culture,
while 31.2 percent favor the
Chace proposal and 40.3 percent
favor neither. More than half of
the student body, however, sup
ports the current Western Cul
ture program.
The poll showed that of under
graduates, 45.2 percent oppose a
dry Rush, while 21.3 percent of
graduate students oppose it.
Senior Vinnie Frost, president
of the Interfraternity Council, at
tributed the support of dry rush
to the "younger classes at Stan
ford." He said that, because of
the poll's results, the IFC is
"definitely going to reconsider"
the possibility of instituting a dry
rush.
"It really isn't a political issue,"
Frost added. "We're concerned
with real issues . . . and the
dangers" of alcohol in the Hush
process, he said.
The poll also showed that 23.5
pcrcent of male undergraduates

and 5.3 percent of male graduate
students currently belong to a fra
ternity or are thinking about
joining one.
The majority of students polled
also said they think the Honor
Code is effective. Of the 23 per
cent who have witnessed a viola
tion, however, 77 percent said
they did not report it.
The ASSU's requirement of
students to vote in the spring elec
tion to qualify for fee refunds was
supported by 57.4 percent of stu
dents polled.
The poll was conducted by a
phone survey of 115 undergrad
uates and 94 graduate students
chosen at random by computer.
The survey questions, submitted
by student senators and members
of other campus organizations,
are worded so as to avoid am
biguity by the ASSU with the help
of a consulting firm.
Council of Presidents member
Jim Durkin said he was not sur
prised by the poll's results. He
said that "certain factions who
speak the loudest" often dominate
subjective surveys. "A poll is help
ful to see how all the students
think," he said.
Ideally, according to Durkin,
the poll will be administered every
two weeks. This poll is the fourth
taken this year.
