An article in yesterday's
Daily inaccurately portrayed
the substance of a forum on
the University's investment
policies in South Africa. The
article stated that the Com
mission on Investment Re
sponsibility is urging the
Board of Trustees to adopt
a policy of "total divest
ment" — or selling all stock
in companies doing business
in South Africa — when in
fact the CIR is recommend
ing that the University
adopt a policy of total dis
investment — or encourag
ing companies to move out
of South Africa — without
selling stock. Also, all of the
panel members did not
agree, as the article said,
that total divestment is the
only way to bring about
meaningful change in South
Africa. One panel member
did not agree with this as
sessment and one did not
address it. In addition, every
quote in the article attrib
uted to Political Science
Prof. Richard Brodv was in
fact said by Political Science
Prof. Joel Samoff. Finally,
Brody's name was mis
spelled throughout the arti
cle. The Daily regrets the
errors.
