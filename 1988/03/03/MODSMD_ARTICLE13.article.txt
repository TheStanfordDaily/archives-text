Iran, Iraq cscalate missile war
BAGDHAD, Iraq — Iran yesterday after
noon fired another missile on the Iraqi capital
of Baghdad and Iraq retaliated minutes later
by launching a missile on Tehran, its 21st
such attack in less than 48 hours.
Iraq also fired two missiles on the Iranian
holy city of Qom, about 75 miles southwest
of Tehran, and bombed the towns of Dezful
and Kaij. Iraq said Iran had bombarded Iraqi
towns all along the 720-mile border with ar
tillery and rockets.
As Iraq's missiles continued falling on Teh
ran, spiritual leader the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini boasted that his people "who are
in love with martyrdom do not care whether
they get the honor by missiles, tanks or can
nons."
Iraq reiterated its vow to demolish the
Iranian capital unless Khomeini accepted peace
and showed "some concern for the suffering
inflicted on his people as a result of his in
sistence on pursuing the war."
The new missile attacks against civilians
went into full-swing Monday after Iran fired
three missiles on Baghdad in retaliation for
an Iraqi air raid on a refinery near Tehran.
Five more missiles were launched on Bagh
dad starting Tuesday night but Iraq refused
to give casualty figures. Figures officially
floated in Tehran on Iranian casualties — 15
injuries Tuesday as a result of four Iraqi mis
siles — appeared aimed at controlling panic
in the capital of 7 million inhabitants.
Botha party loses two seats
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Presi
dent Pieter Botha's ruling National Party suf
fered a serious political setback yesterday when
the far-right Conservative Party won two par
liamentary by-elections despite a massive gov
ernment effort to regain the seats.
The Conservatives not only held both seats,
first won a year ago, but they also significantly
increased their pluralities after a hard-hitting
campaign that attacked the Nationalists' step
by-step reforms as a sellout of white interests.
The severe election defeat, as a result, could
bring a further retreat by Botha from an al
ready modest program of political reforms,
lest he anger the white electorate even more.
The Conservative candidate in Standerton,
a farming community 65 miles southeast of
Johannesburg, tripled his plurality over his
Nationalist rival, for whom Botha had person
ally campaigned.
In Schweizer-Reneke, a rural constituency
180 miles southwest of Johannesburg, the
Conservative candidate increased the party's
plurality fourfold, although senior Cabinet
members had campaigned hard against him
throughout the past two weeks.
The Nationalists' control of the country's
white-led minority government was not at risk;
they have been in power for 40 years.
