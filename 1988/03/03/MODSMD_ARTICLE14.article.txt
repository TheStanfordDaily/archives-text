# Congress approves new civil rights bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The House, set
ting up a mqjor confrontation with
the Reagan administration, voted over
whelmingly yesterday to restore broad
civil rights protections that were
greatly narrowed by a 1984 U.S. Su
preme Court ruling.
Under the sweeping legislation, the
government must withhold all federal
funds from a private or public insti
tution if any of its agencies are found
guilty of discrimination on the grounds
of race, age, sex or disability. The vote
was 315-98.
But, in a controversial amendment
designed to win conservative support,
sponsors also agreed to exempt hospi
tals or schools that receive federal aid
from any requirement to perform
abortions or provide abortion-related
services. As a result, such refusal
would thereby not be considered a
violation of women's rights.
The Senate approved identical leg
islation on a 75-14 vote last month,
but President Reagan informed
Congress late last night that he will
veto the bill. In a letter from Brussels,
the president said the measure un
fairly expands the sweep of federal

civil rights laws.
However, the margin of passage in
both houses — exceeding two-thirds
of the members — would be enough
to override any veto.
During an often heated debate,
Democrats and Republicans alike said
the so-called "Grove City" bill, named
after the 1984 court case, was the
most significant civil rights legislation
to come before Congress in many
years.
Those institutions "who dip their
hands in the public till shouldn't object
if a little democracy sticks to their
fingers," said Rep. Gus Hawkins, D-
Calif.
However, opponents charged that
the measure would threaten the reli
gious freedom of some church schools
that receive federal aid and said that
it should have been analyzed more
carefully by several House committees
before coming up for a vote.
"I think this legislation deceives the
American people into thinking that it
will restore civil rights, when in fact
it jeopardizes them," said Rep. Barbara
Vucanovich, R-Nev., "Imagine if a
church which accepts federally sub

sidized cheese is subject to a federal
investigation. Imagine them bothering
with this when they should be feeding
people."
In a letter sent to members of
Congress from Brussels, Reagan
charged that the bill "diminishes the
freedom of the private citizen to order
his or her life and unnecessarily im
poses the heavy burden of compliance
with extensive federal regulations and
paperwork on many elements of Amer
ican society."
Sponsors responded that existing
federal law allows religious institu
tions to apply for exemptions from
such regulations if they believe that
compliance would violate their beliefs.
They added that no such applications
have ever been denied by the U.S.
Office of Civil Rights.
The abortion exemption was
strongly criticized by some House
members and a coalition of feminist
groups, who feared that it could lead
to an erosion of abortion rights that
have already been guaranteed by the
Supreme Court.
"I am troubled by this bill," said
Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo. "It takes

young women at their most vulnerable
age, the child-bearing years, and they
don't come out of this with the same
rights they had before. We are backing
off on a commitment that was made
before to abortion rights in this
country."
The legislation, which technically
provides amendments to four separate
civil rights laws, seeks to overturn the
Supreme Court's ruling four years ago
in "Grove City College vs. Bell."
In that case, which grew out of a
Pennsylvania private school's refusal
to certify that it would not discrimi
nate, the court held that federal aid
could only be withheld from a specific
school department found guilty of dis
crimination, not the entire institution.
Before that ruling, lower courts had
found that an entire institution was
ineligible for federal funds if one or
several of its departments were guilty
of discrimination. That interpretation
was widely used to enforce civil rights
laws affecting education and racial dis
crimination, plus bias against the dis
abled and the elderly.

in "Grove City College vs. Bell."
In that case, which grew out of a
Pennsylvania private school's refusal
to certify that it would not discrimi
nate, the court held that federal aid
could only be withheld from a specific
school department found guilty of dis
crimination, not the entire institution.
Before that ruling, lower courts had
found that an entire institution was
ineligible for federal funds if one or
several of its departments were guilty
of discrimination. That interpretation
was widely used to enforce civil rights
laws affecting education and racial dis
crimination, plus bias against the dis
abled and the elderly.
