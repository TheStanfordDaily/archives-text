# NATO to demand deep Soviet troop cuts
## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium â€” The
leaders of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization agreed yes
terday to demand, in new East-
West negotiations, sharp reduc
tions in Soviet tanks and artillery,
which according to President
Reagan "pose the greatest threat
to peace."
At the same time, the 16
leaders, at their first summit
meeting since 1982, agreed that
despite Reagan's oft-stated goal
of eventually eliminating the su
perpowers' nuclear arsenals, Eu
ropean defense efforts "for the
foreseeable future" will require
nuclear as well as conventional
weapons.
Reagan, declaring that he had
"never seen such harmony and
togetherness" in the alliance, said
after the first of two days of
meetings here that the agreement
on the negotiating posture
represents "a step forward
for the alliance."
"The most direct threat to our
security and to stability in Europe
lies in the Soviet Union's massive
military presence at a level far
exceeding its defense needs,"
Reagan said in a statement he
read to reporters at the Chateau
Stuyvenberg, a former royal

residence turned over to the pres
ident for his visit.
But despite the show of unity,
a tough and determined speech
by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher made it clear that there
are deep divisions within the al
liance's leadership.
While many of the 16 leaders
were congratulating themselves
for agreeing on policy for conven
tional arms control, Thatcher
made a forceful but probably
futile plea that the alliance also
issue a ringing affirmation of
plans to modernize its short-range
nuclear forces.
Thatcher spoke out after West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
according to German sources, told
the group that "no individual de
cisions about modernizing indi
vidual weapons systems should be
made at this conference."
Kohl, worried about German
public opinion that seems to find
attractive a proposal by Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to elim
inate all short-range missiles, is
expected to prevail at the meeting
here and to persuade most of the
leaders to include no mention of
modernizing weapons in their
final declaration.
