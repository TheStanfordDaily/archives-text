# Panama strike worsens
## 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Scattered
street protests and a series of bomb
threats at the Panama Canal yesterday
raised the intensity of a confrontation
between Panama's military-backed gov
ernment and opposition groups as a gen
eral strike spread in its third day.
The actions came as the U.S. moves
in Washington intensified economic
pressure on the regime of military
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega aimed at limiting Panamanian
access to funds.
In another development, government
officials and military officers denied an
opposition legislator's statement that a
purge was under way in the top ranks
of the Panama Defense Forces to remove
officers suspected of insufficient loyalty
to Gen. Noriega.
Diplomatic and independent Panama
nian sources also said there was no
evidence of a purge. But they confirmed
that at least one major, who is related
to a retired general opposing Noriega,
was forced to resign within the last
several days.
The strike, called by the opposition
National Civic Crusade to protest
Noriega's rule, appeared to solidify as
most shops, businesses and financial in
stitutions in the capital remained shut
for a third day. Doctors also were re
ported to have joined the strike, accept

ing only emergency patients.
In a downtown neighborhood — where
residents Tuesday protested a raid by
government agents on an opposition
radio station — Noriega's opponents
burned a government truck and set up
street barricades of burning trash. In
other areas, protesters set fire to tires
in the streets, and riot police known as
"the Dobermans" were called out.
About 50 Civic Crusade members
marched through city streets chanting
anti-Noriega slogans in an effort to gal
vanize the largely passive resistance to
what the opposition calls the "narco
military dictatorship." Marchers said
they hoped to encourage the Civic
Crusade, which has been reluctant to
confront the security forces, to take their
protests to the streets.
"We have to demonstrate to show the
world we are against Noriega," said Dora
Aleman, 35. "We cannot just sit in our
homes."
At the Panama Canal, anonymous cal
lers phoned in at least three bomb
threats during the day, forcing the
evacuation of the administration build
ing, the Miraflores Lock visitors' center
and the personnel office, officials at the
canal said. Nevertheless, they said, the
canal operated normally again, without
unusual absenteeism.
