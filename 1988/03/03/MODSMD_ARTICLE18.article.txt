## Reform recruiting 
### 
THE DEAN of student affairs
and the director of the
Career Planning and Place
ment Center should heed a recent
ASSIJ Senate bill recommending
that the CPPC bring its non
discrimination policy into line with
the policy of the University as a
whole.
At issue is a difference between
the University's general policy,
which governs "all the rights,
privileges, programs and activities
generally made available to stu
dents at the University" and the
CPPC's policy, which governs the
use of "interviewing facilities and
job-listing services" by employers
seeking to recruit Stanford stu
dents.
Both policies prohibit discrimi
nation on the basis of sex, race,
religion, national origin, handicap
or sexual orientation, but the
CPPC allows "lawful" discrimina
tion.
This distinction allows recruiters
like the U.S. armed forces and
other government agencies that
will not hire gay and lesbian people
to use the CPPC's facilities.
The legality of this form of dis
crimination is currently being chal
lenged in the courts, and a recent
California Supreme Court decision
ruled against the Army's policy.
Stanford has declared that in all
areas of the University, discrimi
nation on the basis of sexual ori
entation is not permissible. Surely
this includes the CPPC. So why
are there two separate policies?
Most major employers that
would like to have access to Stan
ford students; only those who offer
equal opportunity to all students
should be given that privilege.
Those who support the current
policy argue that not allowing the
organizations in question to recruit
on campus will deny students
access to them.

However, many companies
bypass the CPPC facilities and
recruit a few blocks off-campus in
nearby hotels, and it would not
present a significant hardship for
students or recruiters if the mili
tary took that option.
In addition, some fear that if
the University does not allow the
military to recruit through the
CPPC, Stanford could lose federal
funding. However, the military and
similar employers are already
banned from recruiting at the Law
School and the Graduate School of
Business, which have policies
prohibiting all discrimination.
Even if the University were
likely to lose funding, this should
not be a consideration. Would the
University extend privileges con
trary to its policy to a private com
pany in exchange for funding from
that company?
Stanford is home to some of the
great minds and facilities of our
country; the government needs
Stanford more than Stanford
needs the government.
If companies were legally al
lowed to discriminate on any of
the other grounds specified in the
policy, such as race or religion, the
University would hopefully move
to dissociate itself from those or
ganizations. Sexual orientation is
no different.
Stanford occupies a position of
leadership among the universities
of this country in many respects.
One of the obligations of this
position is to maintain a consistent
stance of moral leadership with
regard to controversial issues that
confront the university communi
ty.
Stanford should set an example
against bias and institutionalized
heterosexism by eliminating the
CPPC's distinction between "law
ful" and "unlawful" discrimina
tion.
