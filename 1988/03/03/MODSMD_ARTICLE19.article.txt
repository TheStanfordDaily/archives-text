# Point/Counterpoint
## Western Culture Should Area One requirement include a core list? 
### 
Pi

A question has been posed
to me: "Why is your posi
tion about the Western
Culture course so recently
aired? After all, the Task
Force and Committee on
Undergraduate Studies

have been working for a long time." Many
of us were present as long ago as 1976
and 1980 when the original enabling leg
islation for the Area One Requirement
was passed by the Faculty Senate.
More recently, as I think of the hours
spent by History Prof. Paul Seaver and
his colleagues on this issue, it's fair to
say that as tirelessly as they have been
working, so we of the loyal opposition
have also been working.
In so doing, we have examined the
celebrated core list, for it is at the heart
of the discussion. That little list
represents this University's statement to
its students and to anyone else that there
are certain things worth knowing on the
part of any educated person in this
country.
It is a minimalist position. It does not
exalt these works as right or denigrate
them as wrong; it says simply that they
have provided some of the deep language,
the cultural sub-strata on which we, like
it or not, move and on which generations
before us have moved.
We really can't pretend that this lan
guage hasn't existed. As fine an institu
tion as Stanford is, its power doesn't
reach that far. Stanford will perish before
Shakespeare. Whoever we are, women or
men, black or white, Hispanic, Native
American or Asian, if we live in this time
and in this place, we are the inescapable
legatees of that fundamental past.
That is the core list. And what, ac
cording to the legislation proposed by the
Task Force and C-US would supplant it
were we to adopt the course called "Cul
ture. Ideas and Values?" Well, that's not

answers.
From some individuals you have heard
that if the Faculty Senate passes the
C-US legislation, the core list will disap
pear forever, from others that it will stick
around in pretty much its present form,
and from others that it might be allowed
to come back after an appropriately long
period of cold storage.
The logical response to all -these dif
fering predictions is that they can't all
be right. But what is right? Can C-US
say? I think not.
In sum, the C-US legislation would
subtract from our students and from the
faculty a substantial education success.
In closing, I ask you to remember that
the present Western Culture course is
already a classic instance of compromise.
It mandates the teaching of some 15
consequential works, and thus gives to
the course its spine, its root and stability,
but it also clears a large space wherein
a rich variety of other works, many of
them just as consequential, are read.
Thus it offers a welcome and attractive
flexibility. Yes, Virginia Woolf is taught
in some tracks, as are Richard Wright,
Simone de Beauvoir, Tony Morrison and
Ralph Ellison.
Indeed, the works of women and of
ethnic minorities are taught in every
track. They are not grafted on; they are
there, organically part of the syllabi. This
combination of spinal stability and
flexibility represents the best kind of cur
ricular planning.
But what would be unwise would be
for the Faculty Senate to jettison the
course or the instrumental value of the
core list. I say that on behalf of the
thousands of students who have taken
Western Culture and profited from it, on
behalf of the many thousands who could
profit from it in the future, and on behalf
of colleagues who have taught it with
passion and conviction.

The proposed CIV pro
gram departs from the
existing Western Culture
program in only two sig
nificant respects, but each
of these has been subject
to severe misunderstand

ing and misrepresentation.
First, the theme of "cultural diversity"
is included among the educational objec
tives of the Area One requirement. It is
not, whatever may be said to the con
trary, the only objective. Along with the
tools of critical analysis, the appreciation
of literary expression and a sense of the
sweep of history, the proposal identifies
a sensitivity to cultural diversity as one
of the indispensble conditions of ad
vanced study.
The other point of departure is that
the CIV proposal, striving for a more
cogent means of securing a "common
intellectual experience" for first year un
dergraduates, proposes that the core list
be relaxed.
The false assumption that less-than
great works could somehow be sub
stituted for"The Republic" or "The
Prince" is just that: a false assumption.
The CIV proposal merely recoginizes that
many more classic works, not all of them
European, have contributed to the
shaping of the modern world than the
15 selected for the core list.
Despite many wild allegations, there
are really only two objections to the idea
of a core list. First, it answers
peremptorily a question that was never
properly formulated, namely, "What is
the nature of the common cultural in
heritance that we as Americans share at
the end of the 20th century?"
The answer implicit in the core list is
that by "the West" we mean the litera
ture of four or five countries in Europe,
a proposition that does violence to his
t/wVil tmfVi fV'it fftQrofrnrH"? important

and that has been offensive to many stu
dents and faculty.
The second objection to the core list
is "academic" in the best sense of that
word. CIV proposes that faculty who wish
to do so be accorded greater freedom in
selecting from the world's inheritance of
ideas those primary sources that will
enable them to design intellectually
coherent courses.
It reflects in no way upon the intrinsic
value of the titles on the core list to
suggest that they may not in every case
be the most appropriate ones for pursuing
the guiding themes that mark Stanford's
Area One program as a distinctive aca
demic innovation.
Most students report a positive intel
lectual experience in their various West
ern Culture courses, a response that some
have interpreted as a vote for the existing
core list. The logic of this inference es
capes me. It is more realistic to see this
as evidence that students like courses
that are taught by professors who know
and care about their material and their
students, and that expose them to im
portant and challenging ideas.
At the very least, the "the common
intellectual experience" we provide
should arise out of a common experience
of academic excellence.
Stanford took a pioneering step when
it created the decentralized Western Cul
ture program, whose essence was to rec
ognize our faculty, like our culture, is
richly diverse in its ideas and accomplish
ments.
We are poised now for the second stage
in the natural evolution of this concept.
Fresh ideas, freedom for disciplined ex
perimentation and scholarship these
do not signal the demise of an academic
program: they are the condition of it.
