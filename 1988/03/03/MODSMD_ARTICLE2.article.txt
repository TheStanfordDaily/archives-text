# Nurses' walkout appears unlikely
## Hospital, union reach agreement 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
Eight days before its strike
deadline, the nurses' union at
Stanford Hospital yesterday
reached an agreement with the
hospital administration.
The union's 1,200 members —
practically all the nursing staff at
the hospital — will be informed
of the agreement at a meeting
today and will vote on the issue
Friday. The strike deadline is still
March 11, although this agree
ment makes a strike unlikely.
Union representatives and
hospital officials arrived at the
agreement in the early morning
hours yesterday after a long night
of negotiations.
The union's membership will
probably ratify the tentative plan,
according to Ron Goben, associate
director of the Medical Center's
news bureau.
"In most cases, if the leadership
agrees, then the membership
usually follows," he said. "Histor
ically, tentative agreements are
approved."
Union President Myra Lang
said organization leaders will not
comment on the plan until after
they meet with their members
today.
The nurses union, the Commit
tee for Recognition of Nursing
Achievement, demanded a 6 per
cent wage increase for one year
and an additional 4.5 percent in
crease for the hospital's most
senior nurses.
The hospital's proposal was a
4 percent increase for all nurses.
Details of the agreement will
not be released to the public until
after nurses have been informed.
Jeremy Jones, a laboratory as
sistant at the hospital, told The
Daily last night the hospital had
stopped admitting long-term
patients Monday, when the strike

notice was issued.
Jean Kennedy, director of com
munity relations for the hospital,
said such a reduction in patients
is normal procedure. "Generally,
what happens with something like
this is that you gear down the
number of patients you have at
the hospital."
Jones also said he believed the
nurses had enough support to call
a strike. "If the nurses go on
strike, the hospital won't be able
to take in any patients," he said.
Kennedy downplayed the
seriousness of the strike notice,
however, saying that she believed
an agreement would be reached
before the deadline.
Priscilla Wheeler, University
staff counsel and chief negotiator
for the hospital, was also unavail
able for comment yesterday.
Previously, however, Wheeler
said the hospital administration
was "disappointed at the issuance
of the strike notice."
"We felt that we had made good
progress over the last week
toward achieving a new agree
ment that would be fair to both
the hospital and CRONA nurses.
In our view a stike notice is an
unnecessary disruption to the bar
gaining process," she said.
"Stanford Hospital has long
been recognized as a leader in
salaries for registered nurses,"
Wheeler added.
CRONA last called a strike in
1974. The strike continued for 11
days before an agreement was
reached. The union has repre
sented the nurses since 1966.
