## Stressful days ahead 
### 
IT IS EASY TO FORGET what we
expect to get from our Stanford ex
perience or what we expect from
school in general. But it seems that the
end of every quarter brings these issues
back to mind. The overwhelming
amounts of work, the worry of being
behind, the fatigue of all-nighters — all
of these raise questions of self-doubt and
lack of fulfillment. They make us ask:
"Is school rewarding enough?" And dis
appointingly, more often than not, the
answer is "no."
The whole college experience seems
more of a paradox than anything else.
We enter as eager freshmen, ready to
take on the problems of the world and
exit callous to ideals, as cynical, tired
upperclassmen. Disenchantment is espe
cially heartfelt at this point in the quar
ter, when the enthusiasm we started with
has dwindled under our constant pres
sure to perform.
It seems that education's emphasis on
grades and goals, rather than steady
progress and development, leaves much
to be desired. Rather than teaching us
ways to deal with the world, it prepares
us for unhappiness by building a future
oriented mentality into us.
Stanford students are constantly think
ing of days to come, goals to be achieved,
applications to be sent. Perhaps this is
the reason why school feels so unreward
ing. Rewards are postponed so far into
the future that the journey toward them
becomes a task and not a worthwhile
experience.

This, along with the end of the quarter
grind that leaves us helplessly drowning
in a sea of papers, exams and readings,
is enough to take the enjoyment out of
everything. No matter how carefully we
try to stay on top of things, we end up
dreading Dead Week, dying for the quar
ter to be over.
It frustrates me to feel this way. Why
are we paying $18,000 a year to feel
unhappy and pressured? At this point
even interesting and inspiring subjects
have become a burden.
Why does every teacher feel his or her
class is so important that they have the
right to assign 5,000 pages of reading in
the last two days of classes? Why is there
no reasonable limit to the amount of
work expected from a Stanford under
graduate? When there is this much work,
regardless of the interest we have in our
classes, we feel too overwhelmed to do it.
It's unfair that we suffer instant aca
demic jeopardy by taking off a few
weekends to enjoy the nice weather.
Where is the realization that we need
some rewards to make it all worthwhile?
It's sad that so many of our classes
reflect a lack of understanding for our
well-being. Only one class next quarter,
Optimal Health and Fitness, caters to
the well-being of students. It is ironic
that this class advertises itself as an es
cape from the routine of all-nighters and
stress.
Why is it OK for every other class to
practically require all-nighters, regard
less of our health? Is this academically

productive and fulfilling?
For those of us who feel compelled to
struggle through the quarter, to get the
most from our classes by trying to do
everything that every teacher demands,
perhaps we'll learn something from the
experience. Perhaps we'll learn that
grades mean nothing.
Grades are unrewarding. Not only do
they make the college experience more
tense, they are a small payoff for a large
investment. They are a painfully insuf
ficient means to evaluate oneself. To
place all your happiness on the future
outcome of a report card makes very
little sense.
After all, what if you died tomorrow?
What if you missed your first triple jump
on the ice and just "didn't want to do it
anymore?" Would the world end? Change
your attitude, men and women of Stan
ford.
In a system that puts so much empha
sis on empty evaluations, that makes us
lose confidence in our own self-worth,
the only possible solution is to live for
the moment, to live wisely.
