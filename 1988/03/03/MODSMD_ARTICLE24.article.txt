## STD course will investigate sexual hazards 
### Eric Ly Staff writer 
The three most prevalent dis
eases on college campuses are
chlamydia, herpes and genital
warts, and statistics show that
one in 10 college students carry
a sexually transmitted disease at
one time or another, according to
junior Lauren Friedly, a teaching
assistant for an innovative course
on sexually transmitted diseases.

To provide a basic understand
ing of STDs and their social im
plications, the Human Biology
and Feminist Studies Depart
ments will offer an undergraduate
course spring quarter to give stu
dents a chance to hear from
leaders in the fields of STD policy
and research.
Gonorrhea and syphilis were
the only two known venereal dis
eases several decades ago. In
recent years, however, the list has
grown to include more than 20
different diseases, including Ac
quired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome, each of which is more
common than chicken pox and
measles.

Approximately 13 million
people in the United States will
contract one of these diseases
each year, costing billions of dol
lars in health care.
The interdisciplinary course,
"Biosocial Aspects of Sexually
Transmitted Diseases," will be
taught mostly by guest lecturers,
according to Sylvia Bowen, a
fourth-year medical student who
conceived the idea for the course.
The class, the first of its kind in
the nation, will cover topics such
as syphilis, genital warts, pelvic
inflammatory disease, hepatitis
and herpes, Bowen said.
Bowen believes that discussion
of such diseases is important. "In
order to prevent AIDS or any type
of sexual disease you have to talk
about it .. . teach people about it
so much that they don't feel panic.
You can't preach abstinence," she
said.
She has invited experts from
the fields of biology, law, anthro
pology, public policy, history and
sociology to discuss their work
and opinions on the current state
of research and policy. Bowen,
who is a teaching fellow in Human
Biology, will teach the first part
of the course herself.
While the course does not aim
to give practical advice on safer
sex, it will be an underlying theme
of the class, said Friedly, who took
the course when it was first of
fered last winter. "Concern for
safe sex is something that
everybody will come away with,"
she said.
"Stanford students tend to
think that they are immune to
these diseases because they are
well-educated, come from a good
background and are generally
healthy. There is also a miscon

ception that ethnic minorities are
the only people who get STDs,"
Friedly said.
"There is a reasonable number
of cases of almost every sexually
transmitted disease here on
campus. Stanford has as many
STD cases per year as the national
average for colleges," said Friedly,
who researched the problem of
STDs on campus as a project for
the class.
While these diseases can be
treated if they are caught early,
they often go unnoticed, she said.
Friedly explained that the rate
of affliction at Stanford may ac
tually be higher than her figures
indicate, which were computed
from data collected at Cowell
Health Center. "STDs are not
something people go to Cowell for.
If they suspect that they have a
sexually transmitted disease, they
would go to a private or county
clinic for sake of anonymity,"
Friedly said.
Bowen said she hopes that the
class will make students aware of
the growing problem. She also
hopes that they "will see how the
issue of cost affects STD policy
making and how it is attacked by
governmental agencies at various
levels. It's not just a problem of
finding a technological fix (to
these diseases); there are political,
sociological and political factors
which must be considered."
The fact that the lectures and
discussions will be conducted by
nationally recognized figures will
enhance the learning process, ac
cording to Bowen. "If you hear a
national figure (talk about STDs),
you'll write it down and remem
ber it easily," she said.
Guest speakers include Priscilla
Alexander, co-director of

COYOTE, a prostitutes' rights or
ganization based in San Fran
cisco, and Dr. Howard Torrman,
medical advisor for KRON televi
sion station in San Francisco.
Other lecturers include Sevgi
Aral, a sociologist affiliated with
the Centers for Disease Control,
and Ben Schatz, a San Francisco
attorney known for his litigation
cases concerning gay rights.
Bowen was awarded a $3,300
grant from the Smith Kline Beck
man Foundation two years ago to
develop the new Stanford course.
The course was first offered last
winter quarter and attracted
much media attention because of
its unique curriculum. Course en
rollment filled quickly, and a
waiting list was established for
those who failed to reserve one
of 125 places in the course.
According to Bowen, the course
is unique because it offers a gen
eral discussion of STDs to under
graduates, and avoids much of the
scientific discussion of the dis
eases and concentrates on their
social and behavioral aspects.
The course will focus on "prob
lems of STDs as they relate to
adolescence, prostitution and gay
and lesbian lifestyles," Bowen
said.
Bowen said that many colleges

have wanted to start a course of
their own, and he has received
inquiries requesting information.
Last year's class was "very en
thusiastic" about the material,
Bowen said. Three hundred
people attended the first lecture
last year.
The speakers were "all very in
teresting. It was the best class
I've taken at Stanford," Friedly
said.
Bowen has expanded next quar
ter's course to allow for 150 stu
dents. Students can enroll in the
course for either three units or
five units. Those who enroll for
five units are required to write a
research paper and present it to
their discussion sections.
Discussion sections immedi
ately follow the lectures, giving
the audience a chance to speak
directly with the experts. "It was
definitely the one-to-one interac
tion between students and
speakers that made the class in
teresting. They (the speakers)
were willing to talk a lot about
their work," said Karen Hauer, a
senior in Human Biology. Hauer
took the course last year and will
be one of five TAs for next quar
ter's class.
Last year's students were able
to learn about STD research and

policy-making first hand, Bowen
recalled. "They heard an AIDS
lecturer present his findings, and
later they would see the same
findings reported in the news."
The students "got a big kick from
that," she said.
The lectures and discussions
will be open to the public and
several panel discussions will take
place in the evening at Toyon Hall
and Sterling Quad.
Bowen said she got interested
in reproductive health while
studying at Emory University in
Atlanta.
After arriving as a first-year
medical student in 1984, she
worked as a TA for Chemistry
Prof. Carl Djerassi's course,
"Biosocial Aspects of Birth Con
trol." Djerassi helped develop the
birth control pill. Bowen remem
bers how discussions in the class
kept returning to the role that
sexual diseases play in decisions
about birth control.
Bowen has also worked in fam
ily planning clinics and has coun
seled teenagers on safe sex prac
tices.

of the class, said Friedly, who took
the course when it was first of
fered last winter. "Concern for
safe sex is something that
everybody will come away with,"
she said.
"Stanford students tend to
think that they are immune to
these diseases because they are
well-educated, come from a good
background and are generally
healthy. There is also a miscon

ception that ethnic minorities are
the only people who get STDs,"
Friedly said.
"There is a reasonable number
of cases of almost every sexually
transmitted disease here on
campus. Stanford has as many
STD cases per year as the national
average for colleges," said Friedly,
who researched the problem of
STDs on campus as a project for
the class.
While these diseases can be
treated if they are caught early,
they often go unnoticed, she said.
Friedly explained that the rate
of affliction at Stanford may ac
tually be higher than her figures
indicate, which were computed
from data collected at Cowell
Health Center. "STDs are not
something people go to Cowell for.
If they suspect that they have a
sexually transmitted disease, they
would go to a private or county
clinic for sake of anonymity,"
Friedly said.
Bowen said she hopes that the
class will make students aware of
the growing problem. She also
hopes that they "will see how the
issue of cost affects STD policy
making and how it is attacked by
governmental agencies at various
levels. It's not just a problem of
finding a technological fix (to
these diseases); there are political,
sociological and political factors
which must be considered."
The fact that the lectures and
discussions will be conducted by
nationally recognized figures will
enhance the learning process, ac
cording to Bowen. "If you hear a
national figure (talk about STDs),
you'll write it down and remem
ber it easily," she said.
Guest speakers include Priscilla
Alexander, co-director of

COYOTE, a prostitutes' rights or
ganization based in San Fran
cisco, and Dr. Howard Torrman,
medical advisor for KRON televi
sion station in San Francisco.
Other lecturers include Sevgi
Aral, a sociologist affiliated with
the Centers for Disease Control,
and Ben Schatz, a San Francisco
attorney known for his litigation
cases concerning gay rights.
Bowen was awarded a $3,300
grant from the Smith Kline Beck
man Foundation two years ago to
develop the new Stanford course.
The course was first offered last
winter quarter and attracted
much media attention because of
its unique curriculum. Course en
rollment filled quickly, and a
waiting list was established for
those who failed to reserve one
of 125 places in the course.
According to Bowen, the course
is unique because it offers a gen
eral discussion of STDs to under
graduates, and avoids much of the
scientific discussion of the dis
eases and concentrates on their
social and behavioral aspects.
The course will focus on "prob
lems of STDs as they relate to
adolescence, prostitution and gay
and lesbian lifestyles," Bowen
said.
Bowen said that many colleges

have wanted to start a course of
their own, and he has received
inquiries requesting information.
Last year's class was "very en
thusiastic" about the material,
Bowen said. Three hundred
people attended the first lecture
last year.
The speakers were "all very in
teresting. It was the best class
I've taken at Stanford," Friedly
said.
Bowen has expanded next quar
ter's course to allow for 150 stu
dents. Students can enroll in the
course for either three units or
five units. Those who enroll for
five units are required to write a
research paper and present it to
their discussion sections.
Discussion sections immedi
ately follow the lectures, giving
the audience a chance to speak
directly with the experts. "It was
definitely the one-to-one interac
tion between students and
speakers that made the class in
teresting. They (the speakers)
were willing to talk a lot about
their work," said Karen Hauer, a
senior in Human Biology. Hauer
took the course last year and will
be one of five TAs for next quar
ter's class.
Last year's students were able
to learn about STD research and

policy-making first hand, Bowen
recalled. "They heard an AIDS
lecturer present his findings, and
later they would see the same
findings reported in the news."
The students "got a big kick from
that," she said.
The lectures and discussions
will be open to the public and
several panel discussions will take
place in the evening at Toyon Hall
and Sterling Quad.
Bowen said she got interested
in reproductive health while
studying at Emory University in
Atlanta.
After arriving as a first-year
medical student in 1984, she
worked as a TA for Chemistry
Prof. Carl Djerassi's course,
"Biosocial Aspects of Birth Con
trol." Djerassi helped develop the
birth control pill. Bowen remem
bers how discussions in the class
kept returning to the role that
sexual diseases play in decisions
about birth control.
Bowen has also worked in fam
ily planning clinics and has coun
seled teenagers on safe sex prac
tices.

The three most prevalent dis
eases on college campuses are
chlamydia, herpes and genital
warts, and statistics show that
one in 10 college students carry
a sexually transmitted disease at
one time or another, according to
junior Lauren Friedly, a teaching
assistant for an innovative course
on sexually transmitted diseases.

To provide a basic understand
ing of STDs and their social im
plications, the Human Biology
and Feminist Studies Depart
ments will offer an undergraduate
course spring quarter to give stu
dents a chance to hear from
leaders in the fields of STD policy
and research.
Gonorrhea and syphilis were
the only two known venereal dis
eases several decades ago. In
recent years, however, the list has
grown to include more than 20
different diseases, including Ac
quired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome, each of which is more
common than chicken pox and
measles.

Approximately 13 million
people in the United States will
contract one of these diseases
each year, costing billions of dol
lars in health care.
The interdisciplinary course,
"Biosocial Aspects of Sexually
Transmitted Diseases," will be
taught mostly by guest lecturers,
according to Sylvia Bowen, a
fourth-year medical student who
conceived the idea for the course.
The class, the first of its kind in
the nation, will cover topics such
as syphilis, genital warts, pelvic
inflammatory disease, hepatitis
and herpes, Bowen said.
Bowen believes that discussion
of such diseases is important. "In
order to prevent AIDS or any type
of sexual disease you have to talk
about it .. . teach people about it
so much that they don't feel panic.
You can't preach abstinence," she
said.
She has invited experts from
the fields of biology, law, anthro
pology, public policy, history and
sociology to discuss their work
and opinions on the current state
of research and policy. Bowen,
who is a teaching fellow in Human
Biology, will teach the first part
of the course herself.
While the course does not aim
to give practical advice on safer
sex, it will be an underlying theme
of the class, said Friedly, who took
