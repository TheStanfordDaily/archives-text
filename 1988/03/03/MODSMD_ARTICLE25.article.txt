# Interns share culture with developing countries

"Everywhere I go it's inspiring ... to
see people helping themselves. The intern
is there to catalyze that. It's always in
spiring to see people want to improve
their situation," said Nga Dang, program
coordinator for the Latin American In
ternship (LAI) program.
The program has just completed its
first year, and the organizers feel it has
been quite successful. LAI is run by the
Overseas Development Network, an or
ganization whose West coast headquar
ters are here at Stanford.
The LAI program was instituted to
provide a learning experience for inter
ested students, Dang said. The interns,
all college students or recent graduates,
are sent into a country to learn another
way of life and to assist the community
with projects such as nutritional educa
tion and establishing cooperatives.
Elizabeth Comfort, who moored in In
ternational Relations with an emphasis
on Thirld World development, was the
only Stanford intern in the first year of
the lAI Program. Stye began her intern
ship immediately following graduation in
June.
Comfort traveled to Bolivia to work on
a number of projects. She sought to
develop educational materials for
Bolivian rural village health workers and
to give basic health classes to the remote

mountain villagers.
LAI volunteers work in Southern Chile,
Bolivia, Belize, Guatemala and Mexico.
The ODN chose to send interns to these
countries because other small non-profit
organizations were already there manag
ing development projects. The ODN coor
dinates the internships with five other
organizations, including Los Ninos and
Project Concern International.
"I am very impressed with the courage,
stamina and commitment on the part of
the students who went," said Tim Stan
ton, assistant director of the Public Serv
ice Center and a member of ODN's board
of advisors.
Dang recently completed a tour of the
development projects to evaluate the
progress of the interns at each project
site. One of her primary concerns on the
trip was to maintain an understanding
relationship with the people the program
is trying to help.
"We try to focus on students being
very humble to the culture they're going
in — not (to have the attitude) 'I'm an
American and I know it all.' That's one
of the most important things — to try
to learn from the people there," Dang
said.
Many students have already requested
information about participating in the
1988 LAI program, which begins in June.
Although the ODN expects many com
pleted applications by the March 15 dead

line, they plan to limit the number of
interns to 12 due to financial constraints.
Funds to run LAl's projects come from
the students' own finances and various
fund-raising events.
The interns must be "very, very
flexible, sensitive to other people, other
cultures, people's feeelings, self-initiated,
and not afraid to do new things," includ
ing living in villages without electricity
or running water, Dang said.
The interns find themselves suddenly
transplanted to another cultural world
and often have to survive a period of
adjustment before they can begin work
on their assigned tasks.
It is very difficult for a foreigner or
outsider to come into another culture
and start making changes, Dang said. "It
takes time to get people's trust;" it must
be earned over a period of time, she said.
In a letter written to ODN during her
internship, Comfort said, "I am definitely
learning about a different culture, about
development, (and) to speak Spanish bet
ter — as I had hoped I would. I feel that
I have become a part of the community
here ... I feel that I have formed rela
tionships with people very different from
myself — their way of life, customs, hopes
and dreams are very distinct."
Comfort also said she learned that
"results do not come easily or quickly;
much patience and repetition are neces
sary to achieve goals."

The interns are not expected to produce
results that are immediately obvious. The
goal of the internships is simply to find
"ways to get people to make their own
decisions" and to become self reliant,
Dang said.
"I think I made a substantial impact
that may actually be more long-term than
the time I was actually there," Comfort
said. She is now searching for employ
ment with a non-profit development
agency in Washington, D.C.
"It's definitely worth it. At times you
won't think it is — but the hard times
and lonely times are definitely worth it.
It was the most incredible experience of
my life. I would encourage anyone to
go," Comfort said. She said, however,
prospective interns "should be realisitic
about what they're going into in terms

of the living conditions."
"I prepared myself for the loneliness
by knowing that it would happen. I had
traveled in Third World countries and I
had lived in one, so I kind of knew what
to expect," Comfort said. She lived in
Chile one summer during high school.
The interns hope that their profes
sional careers will be enhanced by the
knowledge they gained in the program.
The experiences give the interns a mental
image of where they are going to apply
their interests in development, Dang said.
"Development to me has become a
mobilization by the people for themselves
in many different aspects of life — a
realization by them that they have con
trol of their lives and can change situa
tions for the better. An outside organi
zation's role is tricky, but I think the
techincal and financial help can be very
beneficial, but only if that is what the
people want," Comfort said.
The ODN, a national consortium of
college groups organized to aid Third
World development, has chapters at UC-
Berkeley, UC-Davis and the University
of Santa Clara. ODN's East coast head
quarters are at Harvard University.
The West coast headquarters was cho
sen instead of Harvard to head the LAI
program because there is more interest
and awareness of Latin American culture
in California, according to Dang, a biology
m^jor.

of the most important things — to try
to learn from the people there," Dang
said.
Many students have already requested
information about participating in the
1988 LAI program, which begins in June.
Although the ODN expects many com
pleted applications by the March 15 dead

line, they plan to limit the number of
interns to 12 due to financial constraints.
Funds to run LAl's projects come from
the students' own finances and various
fund-raising events.
The interns must be "very, very
flexible, sensitive to other people, other
cultures, people's feeelings, self-initiated,
and not afraid to do new things," includ
ing living in villages without electricity
or running water, Dang said.
The interns find themselves suddenly
transplanted to another cultural world
and often have to survive a period of
adjustment before they can begin work
on their assigned tasks.
It is very difficult for a foreigner or
outsider to come into another culture
and start making changes, Dang said. "It
takes time to get people's trust;" it must
be earned over a period of time, she said.
In a letter written to ODN during her
internship, Comfort said, "I am definitely
learning about a different culture, about
development, (and) to speak Spanish bet
ter — as I had hoped I would. I feel that
I have become a part of the community
here ... I feel that I have formed rela
tionships with people very different from
myself — their way of life, customs, hopes
and dreams are very distinct."
Comfort also said she learned that
"results do not come easily or quickly;
much patience and repetition are neces
sary to achieve goals."

The interns are not expected to produce
results that are immediately obvious. The
goal of the internships is simply to find
"ways to get people to make their own
decisions" and to become self reliant,
Dang said.
"I think I made a substantial impact
that may actually be more long-term than
the time I was actually there," Comfort
said. She is now searching for employ
ment with a non-profit development
agency in Washington, D.C.
"It's definitely worth it. At times you
won't think it is — but the hard times
and lonely times are definitely worth it.
It was the most incredible experience of
my life. I would encourage anyone to
go," Comfort said. She said, however,
prospective interns "should be realisitic
about what they're going into in terms

of the living conditions."
"I prepared myself for the loneliness
by knowing that it would happen. I had
traveled in Third World countries and I
had lived in one, so I kind of knew what
to expect," Comfort said. She lived in
Chile one summer during high school.
The interns hope that their profes
sional careers will be enhanced by the
knowledge they gained in the program.
The experiences give the interns a mental
image of where they are going to apply
their interests in development, Dang said.
"Development to me has become a
mobilization by the people for themselves
in many different aspects of life — a
realization by them that they have con
trol of their lives and can change situa
tions for the better. An outside organi
zation's role is tricky, but I think the
techincal and financial help can be very
beneficial, but only if that is what the
people want," Comfort said.
The ODN, a national consortium of
college groups organized to aid Third
World development, has chapters at UC-
Berkeley, UC-Davis and the University
of Santa Clara. ODN's East coast head
quarters are at Harvard University.
The West coast headquarters was cho
sen instead of Harvard to head the LAI
program because there is more interest
and awareness of Latin American culture
in California, according to Dang, a biology
m^jor.

"Everywhere I go it's inspiring ... to
see people helping themselves. The intern
is there to catalyze that. It's always in
spiring to see people want to improve
their situation," said Nga Dang, program
coordinator for the Latin American In
ternship (LAI) program.
The program has just completed its
first year, and the organizers feel it has
been quite successful. LAI is run by the
Overseas Development Network, an or
ganization whose West coast headquar
ters are here at Stanford.
The LAI program was instituted to
provide a learning experience for inter
ested students, Dang said. The interns,
all college students or recent graduates,
are sent into a country to learn another
way of life and to assist the community
with projects such as nutritional educa
tion and establishing cooperatives.
Elizabeth Comfort, who moored in In
ternational Relations with an emphasis
on Thirld World development, was the
only Stanford intern in the first year of
the lAI Program. Stye began her intern
ship immediately following graduation in
June.
Comfort traveled to Bolivia to work on
a number of projects. She sought to
develop educational materials for
Bolivian rural village health workers and
to give basic health classes to the remote

mountain villagers.
LAI volunteers work in Southern Chile,
Bolivia, Belize, Guatemala and Mexico.
The ODN chose to send interns to these
countries because other small non-profit
organizations were already there manag
ing development projects. The ODN coor
dinates the internships with five other
organizations, including Los Ninos and
Project Concern International.
"I am very impressed with the courage,
stamina and commitment on the part of
the students who went," said Tim Stan
ton, assistant director of the Public Serv
ice Center and a member of ODN's board
of advisors.
Dang recently completed a tour of the
development projects to evaluate the
progress of the interns at each project
site. One of her primary concerns on the
trip was to maintain an understanding
relationship with the people the program
is trying to help.
"We try to focus on students being
very humble to the culture they're going
in — not (to have the attitude) 'I'm an
American and I know it all.' That's one
of the most important things — to try
to learn from the people there," Dang
said.
