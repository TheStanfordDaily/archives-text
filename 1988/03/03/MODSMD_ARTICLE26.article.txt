Rape is a crime that can be
defined in a very straightforward,
even mathematical, fashion.
Despite minor variations among
the states and despite recent
reform enactments, essentially
rape equals sexual intercourse (by
a man with a woman other than
his wife), plus force or the threat
of force by the man, minus the
woman's consent.
Nonetheless rape is a highly
charged emotional issue, reflect
ing society's notions about gender
roles and the victim's personal
sense of intimate violation. The
social and legal issues surround
ing rape are thus intricate and
complex. What complicates the
law of rape in the view of Harvard
law professor Susan Estrich in
"Real Rape" is the fact that
"many cases that (fit) the defini
tion of 'rape' are not treated as
criminal by the criminal justice
system, or even considered rape
by their women victims."

Excerpt

"What the law owes
women is a celebration of
our autonomy, and an
end ... to the distrust
and suspicion of women
victims of rape that has
been the most dominant
and continuing theme in
the cases and commen
tary."

The thesis of Estrich's book is
that the law implicitely but quite
perceptibly draws an improper
distinction between "real rape,"
for which there is a strong
likelihood of prosecution and con
viction, and technical or "simple
rape," for which the perpetrator
usually enjoys legal impunity.
A "real rape" involves the sort
of paradigmatic circumstances
normally conjured up by the term
rape. The assailant is a stranger
who ambushes his victim at night
in a secluded area and uses or
threatens violence to obtain sex.
By contrast, a "simple rape" ex
hibits none of these aggravating
circumstances, yet falls within the
legal definition. The aggressor in
a simple rape case, says Estrich,
"knew his victim and neither beat
nor threatened her with a
weapon." These are rapes com
mitted by friends, acquaintances
and neighbors.
"Date rape" at Stanford, for ex
ample, can take the form of simple
rape. Although the law formally
recognizes the existence of rape
in these contexts (except marital
rape), in application the law im
properly operates to punish the
victim of a simple rape and to
protect her male aggressor.
In cases of real rape, a woman's
non-consent, if not readily appar
ent, is frequently presumed. With
out this tacit presumption, how
ever, Estrich claims the law is
constructed so as to make it ex
tremely difficult for non-consent
to be established. For practical
purposes, then, a simple rape is
not really a rape in the eyes of
the law.
Turn-of-the-century courts
demanded that a woman assert
her non-consent by exercising "ut
most resistance" to a man's sexual
advances before the man could be
convicted of rape. This requisite
of struggle in the face of danger
was based on an expectation that
a woman should value her chas

tity more than her life, Estrich
points out.
Legal doctrine was later
liberalized somewhat to require
merely "reasonable" resistance by
the woman. Yet she was still ex
pected to do more than simply
verbalize her disinterest. Modern
courts stress the presence of a
threat of force as necessarily ten
ding to establish non-consent. But
at the same time the concept of
force has often been construed
with mind-numbing narrowness,
so that in many cases in which a
woman has been terrorized into
having sex, the result is still an
acquittal for rape.
Resistance was traditionally re
quired because women's words
were mistrusted by the law.
Estrich cites an appalling passage
from a scholarly article in the
Stanford Law Review as typical
of the male legal mindset. The
article, which appeared in 1966,
states: "Although a woman may
desire sexual intercourse, it is cus
tomary for her to say, 'No, no,
no' — although meaning 'Yes, yes.
yes' — and to expect the male to
be the aggressor." Therefore, ver
balized non-consent has generally
not been considered credible.
Distrust of women has also
been apparent in the traditional
rules governing how a rape may
be proved. Many states once spe
cifically provided that a woman's
testimony had to be corroborated
by additional evidence because of
a baseless notion that "stories of
rape are frequently lies or fanta
sies."
Although the corroboration rule
has been eliminated, Estrich says
that as a practical matter inde
pendent corroboration of a vic
tim's testimony "continues to be
a critical factor in determining the
disposition of rape charges even
today."
Another abhorrent rule of
evidence based on the mistrust of
rape victims is the legal relevance

attached to a victim's sexual past
with respect to proving non
consent. Estrich notes that the
rule "reflects ... the law's puni
tive celebration of female chastity
and its unwillingness to protect
women who lack its version of
virtue." The enactment of "rape
shield laws" in many states, in
cluding California, have limited
the admissibility of this form of
evidence. But says Estrich, the
modern "force" doctrine is so ef
ficient for screening out the
simple rape and imposing blame
on the woman victim that eviden
tiary reform has been rendered
largely inconsequential.
According to Estrich, all the
traditional rules were applied
with greater consistency to
frustrate claims of simple rape
perpetrated by a neighbor, ex
boyfriend, or other acquaintance.
The further removed a woman's
allegations were from the
paradigm "real rape" case, the less
likely the woman would be
believed and the more likely that
evidentiary obstacles would be
employed to prevent a conviction.
In this way, the law of rape im
plicitely distinguished between in

stances of real rape by "strangers
coming out of ambush" and in
stances where a woman's ac
quaintance unilaterally afforded
himself sexual access to her.
Reform legislation over the last
two decades has regrettably
"proven far less successful" in ex
panding the definition of rape and
increasing convictions than had
been intended, Estrich concludes
from examining a series of
studies. "The reformers, in their
determination to move away from
the troublesome consent standard
and their confidence in a 'force'
test, grant(ed) appellate judges
new license to continue their dis
trust of women." This, she sug
gests, indicates that "changing
the words of statutes is not nearly
so important as changing the way
we understand them."
Estrich, who was herself a rape
victim, has written an important
book. Rape is a topic that has not
been significantly addressed in
the legal literature, although it is
now receiving increased attention.
Estrich's contribution is thus
likely to have a great impact, both
in the legal community and
beyond.

Her writing style is forthright,
dispassionate, and relatively in
formal. She is careful to be
precise, yet is able to convey an
easy, conversational familiarity
with her topic which overcomes
the barriers that legal terminol
ogy might ordinarily present to
the average reader.
Estrich is helped in this regard
by the simplicity and compelling
force of her argument. Her thesis
is profound but hardly radical.
Certainly it is not as extreme as
the position taken (persuasively)
by Catherine MacKinnon, a visit
ing scholar at the Institute for
Research on Women and Gender
at Stanford, that all heterosexual
intercourse is inherently coercive
and non-consensual and thus
carries the gloss of rape. Estrich
simply contends that there are a
great variety of sexual encounters
that fit the legal definition of, but
are not often considered to be,
rape. A woman's 'no' means 'no'
in any context, she argues; and
date rape, like all rape, should be
considered real rape.
