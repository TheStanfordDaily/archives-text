# Rape: What the Courts Have Said
## 
### 
Hart v. Commonwealth
Virginia, 1921
"The evidence indicates
that he had wooed her
pretty roughly in a way that
would have been horrible
and a shocking outrage
toward a woman of virtuous
sensibilities ... But how far
it affected the sensiblities of
[this woman] does not ap
pear."

People v. Harris
California, 1951
"It is contended that ...
(the woman) acquiesced in
the assault upon her. Noth
ing could be further from the
truth. When a young, white
woman returning home from
her work meets a strange,
male person of the Negro
race in the dead of night
... it would border upon the
stupid to find that she freely
acquiesced in his acts."

State v. Rusk
Maryland, 1981
â™¦
"[The rape victim] roust
follow the natural instinct of
every proud female to resist,
by more than mere words,
the violation of her person
by a stranger or an unwel
comed friend."
