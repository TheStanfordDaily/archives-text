## Cardinal cagers seek a sweep of UCLA 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
In a sense there
are four ways to
look at tonight's
game between
Stanford and
UCLA in Pauley
Pavilion.

First, Stanford is 0-22 in
Pauley. Second, the Cardinal
hasn't defeated the Bruins in Los
Angeles since the 1951-1952
season. Third, Stanford has not
swept UCLA since 1942, when
Coach Everett Dean and his squad
brought the NCAA title back to
the Farm.
The fourth view, the one
adopted by the Cardinal players,
says to hell with all of the above.
If Stanford doesn't win today
(7:35 p.m. tipofT on KTVU-TV,
channel 2, KZSU-FM 90.1 and
KCBS-AM 740), hopes for the
first Cardinal NCAA berth since
1942 will be reduced to hopes for
a miracle.
Stanford (18-9 overall, 10-6 in
the Pacific 10 Conference) cur
rently sits in a third place tie with
UCLA, one game behind Oregon
State. In order to be in serious
contention for an NCAA bid, the
Cardinal needs to finish in second
place, and for that to happen,
Stanford needs to beat both
UCLA and USC this weekend and
Oregon State must lose one of its
two games against Oregon.
While that is a lot to think
about, the Stanford players are
thinking about one single game.
"We know the next two games
are must wins, but we're taking
them one game at a time," Stan
ford junior Todd Lichti said.
"We're going to have to play hard
but also play smart against
UCLA. We have to control our
aggressiveness."
What Lichti fears is that UCLA
might get into a running game if
Stanford is too aggressive. And
with the fleet point guard Pooh
Richardson leading the break, the
Bruins can fill up the hole.
Richardson is second in the con
ference in both assists and steals,
averaging 6.3 and 2.1 per game
respectively. The Philadelphia na
tive can penetrate and make
things happen.
"They've got a pretty good tran
sition game because of Pooh, and
they've got some guys who want
to fill the lanes for him," Lichti
said.
One of those guys is sophomore
forward Trevor Wilson, who leads
the team with 15.1 points per
game and 9.6 rebounds. Back in

December, Wilson had 22 points
and Richardson had 25 in a losing
effort as Stanford squeaked out
a 116-110 double-overtime vic
tory.
Late-blooming Bruin center
Kelvin Butler has been on a tear
recently. In his last four confer
ence games, Butler has scored 22,
21, 19 and 15 points, but his
season average stands at only 7.9
per game.
Cardinal forward Howard
Wright scored a career-high 30
points in the double OT victory,
while teammate Terry Taylor
chipped in 20 points.
On Saturday, Stanford will visit
USC at the Los Angeles Sports
Arena at 3:00. The game will be
televised on KPIX-TV, channel 5.
