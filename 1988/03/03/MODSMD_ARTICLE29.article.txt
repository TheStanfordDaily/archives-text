# Aussie Mosse finds U.S. success
## 
### Scott Roth Staff writer 
It is no secret that recruiting
athletes for college sports is a
serious competitive business, but
for senior swimmer Anthony
Mosse, the process took on an
exciting twist. He started early
and went international.
Mosse, who hails from Aukiand,
New Zealand, began to participate
in the recruiting derby half-way
around the world while he was
still a sophomore in high school,
and had it not been for a little
patience, Mosse might have ended
up swimming his laps in the Mid
west.
"In 1982, I was swimming in
the British Commonwealth
Games and a number of American
coaches were down there watch

ing the meets," Mosse said. "I
almost decided to go to lowa right
then, but luckily I waited.
"The following year in 1983, I
started getting more stuff and
then figured the U.S. was the
place to go. I really felt that I
would only consider Stanford,
UCLA, UC-Berkeley and Har
vard."
After making a long swing
across the Pacific, Mosse visited
the schools on the West coast and
knew immediately that Harvard
was out of the running. Mosse
cut his trip short, and like so
many other athletes, one look at
the Farm was all it took to con
vince him to make deGuerre Pool
his home.
"I really feel that the quality
of the people and the beauty of
the campus sold me at first,"

Mosse said in an accent that is a
combination of Paul Hogan and
a British diplomat. "But the more
I thought, I realized that Stan
ford's superior academics were
just as important to me as any
thing else. Looking back, I could
not have made a better choice."
Stanford Coach Skip Kenney
probably was more excited about
Mosse's decision than he was. The
butterfly specialist brought the
experience of a sth-place finish in
the 1984 Olympic 200-meter fly
to a team that was busily estab
lishing itself as the most domi
nant force in collegiate swimm
ming.
After living in the long shadow
of Pablo Morales, Mosse has es
tablished himself as the premier
collgiate swimmers in the
America, and is considered to be
a top contender for an Olympic
medal this Summer in Seoul. Yet
the hype and pressure of Olympic
competition do not seem to phase
him.
"The Olympics are just one of
three things I use to motivate
myself," Mosse, a economics and
political science mtyor said. "I've
been getting stronger each year
as I compete in international
meets. The University Games last
year and the '86 Commonwealth
Games were really encouraging,
(he won events in both meets),
so I really am looking forward to
this summer."
When Mosse lines up in Soeul,
he most likely will be racing
against former teammate and
friend Pablo Morales. Morales
who won gold in 1984 has been
one of the world's top swimmers,
but the prospect of competing
against someone who used to be
on your team does not vex Mosse.
In fact, it's not altogether differ
ent than any old dual meet in
college.
"Even though we were on the
same team and scoring points for
Stanford, we were still competing
against each other," Mosse said.
"I was always trying to beat him

and he me. That's why we have
been so successful. We help and
encourage each other."
Mosse obviously learned what
it takes to push others and be a
leader. Along with senior Matt
Nance and senior roommate Sean
Murphy, Mosse was elected team
captain of this year's squad. And
in his unassuming way, Mosse at
tributes the honor mostly to his
wealth of international experi
ence.
"Sean (Murphy) and I have
competed a lot at the interna
tional level and we bring that
aspect to the younger swimmers.
I really er\joy being able to offer
advice to the younger guys on how
to take a turn or work with them
on a start," Mosse said. "Occa
sionally, we'll sit around and talk
about the mental aspects of the
sport, too. It's just my way of
giving back to the team."
Olympics aside, Mosse says that
his focus now remains fixed on
the up-coming Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships. Mosse ex
pects his teammates will rise to
the occasion.
"It's a bit disconcerting to lose
more meets in your senior year
than all of the others combined,
but I feel that we will do well in
the Pac-10's. I think that our
problem this year has been that
we don't have quite the depth
that we have had in the past, but
I feel we'll qualify just as many
guys as we have before," Mosse
said.
With his Stanford career com
ing to a close and the 1992 Olym
pics far off in the future, Mosse
says he has looked past Soeul but
he knows his future in the pool
is limited. He plans to put his
degrees to work for him once he
stops swimming. After a year or
two in business, he expects to en
ter law or business school. Mosse
says he has not made up his mind,
but he knows that he will remain
in the U.S.
