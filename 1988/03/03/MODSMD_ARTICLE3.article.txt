# Early endorsements for spring election questioned
## 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
Although the announcement deadline
for ASSU election candidates is tomor
row, the People's Platform has already
made "unofficial endorsements," accord
ing to senior Stacey Leyton, deputy chair
of the ASSU Senate and a member of
Students United for a Democratic Edu
cation.
The People's Platform is a coalition of
campus ethnic minority and progressive
groups that has endorsed candidates in
the ASSU elections the last two years.
It includes members of the Asian-
American Student Association, the Black
Student Union, Hillel (a Jewish student
organization), MEChA (a Chicano-Latino
student organization), Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization, Stanford Or
ganization for Lesbian and Gay Equality
and SUDE.
The formal announcement of endorse
ments cannot be made until one week
before the elections (scheduled for April

13 and 14), but Leyton said the platform
has nominated and endorsed a slate of
10 candidates for ASSU Senate and
formed a four-person slate for Council
of Presidents.
Election Commissioner Steve Baer said
the early endorsements were puzzling but
not illegal. "I don't know how they can
choose since nobody is on the ballot yet,"
he said. "If they make an endorsement
before they're already on the ballot, I
don't know what I can do about that."
But COP member Maria Canas ex
pressed concern about the fairness of the
process. "I would say it would be more
fair to advertise for candidates before
endorsements are made," she said.
In addition to informing students about
the platform, Canas said that advertising
"would be more fair to those who might
have wanted the endorsement, but now
can't get it."
COP member Leonard Adler, who at
tended the platform meeting, echoed
Canas' concern. Since the endorsements
were made at "a closed sort of meeting,"

Adler said it was "fairly obvious who was
going to be chosen."
Adler added that most of the candidates
were "pre-selected" before the meeting
began. "Anybody else could walk in but
couldn't get the endorsement."
Of the 10 Senate candidates endorsed,
Adler said four were from the BSU, two
each from MEChA and SUDE, one from
AASA and one at-large candidate. The
COP slate chosen includes one at-large
member and one member each from the
BSU, MEChA and SUDE.
"It would be nice, if they purport to
be the People's Platform, [if] they gave
all the people a chance," Adler said. He
said that such a "secretive" process made
the endorsements "definitely unfair" to
other candidates.
In the past, the platform has publicized
its endorsement process through fliers
and advertisements. Through such an
nouncements, Adler said other candidates
"would at least have the opportunity" to
receive endorsements.
COP member Jim Durkin said he

wishes the platform had advertised also,
but finds "nothing wrong" with the early
selection of candidates. "If they think
those people will best serve their agenda,
then it's OK to endorse already," he said.
Leyton said announcement of the se
lection process was "targeted" at
meetings of the involved organizations,
as well as the ethnic theme houses. "Bas
ically, it was a meeting of the Third-
World community to decide who we
wanted to run," Leyton said.
Leyton said the unofficial endorse
ments were made early because "a lot of
people won't run unless they get the
platform endorsement." Each candidate
must submit a declaration of candidacy
along with a minimum number of signa
tures. One hundred signatures are re
quired for the Senate, 250 for COP.
Baer noted that candidates cannot
begin to campaign until Campaign Week,
which begins April 6. "If I catch People's
Platform or anybody campaigning early,
their candidates will be disqualified," he
said.

Candidates must also adhere to a limit
on campaign expenditures, Baer said.
Last year's limit for COP candidates was
$250, while Senate candidates were lim
ited to spending $75. Baer said he as
sumes this year's limits will be approx
imately the same.
"I don't really care who endorses
anybody, as long as campaign money is
recorded," he said.
If the platform spends money to sup
port a candidate — through fliers or ad
vertisements in the Daily — Baer said
"their money will count toward (the cam
paign expenditure limit)."
Leyton explained that candidates with
platform endorsements have been very
successful in the past. "Last year nine
of 10 candidates we endorsed made it
into the senate," she said, adding that
the highest vote-getters in the past two
years have been platform-endorsed can
didates.
"I think (the platform) articulates is
sues that represent a lot of people,"
Leyton said.

then it's OK to endorse already," he said.
Leyton said announcement of the se
lection process was "targeted" at
meetings of the involved organizations,
as well as the ethnic theme houses. "Bas
ically, it was a meeting of the Third-
World community to decide who we
wanted to run," Leyton said.
Leyton said the unofficial endorse
ments were made early because "a lot of
people won't run unless they get the
platform endorsement." Each candidate
must submit a declaration of candidacy
along with a minimum number of signa
tures. One hundred signatures are re
quired for the Senate, 250 for COP.
Baer noted that candidates cannot
begin to campaign until Campaign Week,
which begins April 6. "If I catch People's
Platform or anybody campaigning early,
their candidates will be disqualified," he
said.

Candidates must also adhere to a limit
on campaign expenditures, Baer said.
Last year's limit for COP candidates was
$250, while Senate candidates were lim
ited to spending $75. Baer said he as
sumes this year's limits will be approx
imately the same.
"I don't really care who endorses
anybody, as long as campaign money is
recorded," he said.
If the platform spends money to sup
port a candidate — through fliers or ad
vertisements in the Daily — Baer said
"their money will count toward (the cam
paign expenditure limit)."
Leyton explained that candidates with
platform endorsements have been very
successful in the past. "Last year nine
of 10 candidates we endorsed made it
into the senate," she said, adding that
the highest vote-getters in the past two
years have been platform-endorsed can
didates.
"I think (the platform) articulates is
sues that represent a lot of people,"
Leyton said.
Although the announcement deadline
for ASSU election candidates is tomor
row, the People's Platform has already
made "unofficial endorsements," accord
ing to senior Stacey Leyton, deputy chair
of the ASSU Senate and a member of
Students United for a Democratic Edu
cation.
The People's Platform is a coalition of
campus ethnic minority and progressive
groups that has endorsed candidates in
the ASSU elections the last two years.
It includes members of the Asian-
American Student Association, the Black
Student Union, Hillel (a Jewish student
organization), MEChA (a Chicano-Latino
student organization), Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization, Stanford Or
ganization for Lesbian and Gay Equality
and SUDE.
The formal announcement of endorse
ments cannot be made until one week
before the elections (scheduled for April

13 and 14), but Leyton said the platform
has nominated and endorsed a slate of
10 candidates for ASSU Senate and
formed a four-person slate for Council
of Presidents.
Election Commissioner Steve Baer said
the early endorsements were puzzling but
not illegal. "I don't know how they can
choose since nobody is on the ballot yet,"
he said. "If they make an endorsement
before they're already on the ballot, I
don't know what I can do about that."
But COP member Maria Canas ex
pressed concern about the fairness of the
process. "I would say it would be more
fair to advertise for candidates before
endorsements are made," she said.
In addition to informing students about
the platform, Canas said that advertising
"would be more fair to those who might
have wanted the endorsement, but now
can't get it."
COP member Leonard Adler, who at
tended the platform meeting, echoed
Canas' concern. Since the endorsements
were made at "a closed sort of meeting,"

Adler said it was "fairly obvious who was
going to be chosen."
Adler added that most of the candidates
were "pre-selected" before the meeting
began. "Anybody else could walk in but
couldn't get the endorsement."
Of the 10 Senate candidates endorsed,
Adler said four were from the BSU, two
each from MEChA and SUDE, one from
AASA and one at-large candidate. The
COP slate chosen includes one at-large
member and one member each from the
BSU, MEChA and SUDE.
"It would be nice, if they purport to
be the People's Platform, [if] they gave
all the people a chance," Adler said. He
said that such a "secretive" process made
the endorsements "definitely unfair" to
other candidates.
In the past, the platform has publicized
its endorsement process through fliers
and advertisements. Through such an
nouncements, Adler said other candidates
"would at least have the opportunity" to
receive endorsements.
COP member Jim Durkin said he

wishes the platform had advertised also,
but finds "nothing wrong" with the early
selection of candidates. "If they think
those people will best serve their agenda,
then it's OK to endorse already," he said.
