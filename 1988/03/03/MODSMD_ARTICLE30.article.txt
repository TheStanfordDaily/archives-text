# Card NCAA hopes alive â€” but barely
## 
### 
The odds are against Stan
ford tonight at Pauley Pavilion,
but if the Cardinal defeats the
Bruins and then mops up the
Trojans on Saturday, talk of
an NCAA berth will recom
mence.
Below are some factors that
are obvious, and some that are
not so obvious. Some of them
are pulled out of thin air.

If the NCAA is going to take
only two Pac-10 schools, as
conventional wisdom
proclaims, then it will be be
tween Stanford and Oregon
State. This could be bad news
for the Farm.
Beaver Head Coach Ralph
Miller, who proves the theory
that if you are old enough, you
can wear any color suit you
want, is stepping down after
this season. Miller is the win
ningest active Division I coach
with 649 victories and the
laurels are falling his way
(1988 Kodak-NIT Man of the
Year, inductee into the Nais
mith Memorial Basketball Hall
of Fame).
No matter how scientific the
NCAA selection process claims
to be, you have to figure that
if Oregon State is at all close
to the top 64, the committee
will give Old Ralph the benefit
of the doubt. You can't deny
he has earned it.

A couple of those scientific
methods are comparative
strength of schedules and
records against common oppo
nents. Oregon State garnered
one big bonus by not only
beating Loyola Marymount
early in the season but by hold
ing the high-scoring Lions to
69 points.
Stanford, however, played
two tough non-conference op
ponents, Indiana and lowa
(both losses), and defeated UC-
Santa Barbara 75-65 while
Oregon State lost to UCSB 71-
70.
Now let's forget the mun
dane and head for some far out
ideas. Do you suppose the be
leaguered NCAA might give
Stanford a break because of the
Farm's national reputation?
With all the Proposition 48
business and various recruiting
violations, the NCAA might
drool at a first round Stanford
versus Duke matchup.
"Coming up next," the blurb
might say, "Brains versus
brains, as the Duke Blue Devils
try to outwit the Stanford Car
dinal." Yuck.
On the other hand, the
NCAA might be peeved at
Stanford because of the drug
testing case.
So, the NCAA could avoid
the controversy and rebuff the
trouble-making Cardinal athle
tic department at the same
time. Nobody will notice.
Another situation could have
Stanford vying locally with
Santa Clara for a tournament
spot. Again, this is bad news
for the Cardinal. Santa Clara
defeated Stanford back in De
cember, and the Broncos are
hosting the WCAC tournament
this weekend.
