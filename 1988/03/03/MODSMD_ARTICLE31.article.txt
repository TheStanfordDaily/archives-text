The top teams from across the nation
will be gunning at Stanford and its
No. 1 ranking beginning today at the
USTA/ITCA Women's National Col
legiate Indoor Team Tennis Cham
pionship in Madison, Wis.
Unranked Northwestern will get

the first shot at the top-seeded Cardinal in a first
round match this afternoon. Stanford will be com
peting without junior Eleni Rossides, who is ranked
third in the nation in singles in the most recent
ITCA poll. Rossides has not played in four weeks
because of an injury to her left groin, and she did
not travel with the team to Wisconsin.
Freshman Sandra Birch, whose status for this
weekend had been questionable after she suffered
a muscle spasm injury in her right leg a week ago,
made the trip and should be ready to play today.
Northwestern has fielded strong teams in the
past few years, but after being ranked No. 14 in
the preseason poll, the Wildcats have dropped out
of the rankings this season.
North western's decline can be attributed largely
to the absence of last year's top two players, Katrina
Adams and Diane Donnelly. Adams took a year off
to compete as an amateur on the professional tour
and Donnelly, the No. 5 seed in last season's NCAA
singles tournament, graduated.
"I like our draw," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said. "We have a nice first round and potentially a
nice second round (No. 7 SMU or No. 10 Georgia)."
If the Cardinal can get by the first two rounds,
it will probably meet fourth-seeded California or
fifth-seeded UCLA in Saturday's semifinals. Florida
and USC are the top seeds in the other half of the
draw. The 8-0 Trojans beat the Gators earlier in
the season.
Stanford Asst. Coach Caryn Copeland said the
Cardinal will not have trouble adjusting to the
indoor courts. "A lot of the girls play indoors," she
said. "The Whitlingers play indoors, Sandra plays
indoors. Most of the girls grew up playing indoors."
Copeland said Stanford will also be aided by the
support of some local fans. "We'll have a bit of an
advantage in that the Whitlingers will have an
entourage," Copeland said, referring to freshmen
Tami and Teri Whitlinger, who hail from Neenah,
Wis.
Both players and coaches downplayed the impor
tance of the indoor tournament. "I think it's really
no big deal," senior Cari Hagey said. "When it
comes down to it, what really counts is the NCAAs."
However, Hagey and her coaches agreed that the
Cardinal should benefit from seeing the other top
teams in action. "We kind of have a feeling for
who's good, but it will be interesting to see," Hagey
said.
Even without Rossides, the Cardinal will send
four of the nation's top 25 singles players onto the
courts this weekend. Tami Whitlinger is ranked
fifth, and junior Lisa Green, Teri Whitlinger and
Birch are Nos. 22, 23 and 25, respectively.
