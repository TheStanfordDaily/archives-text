# Cardinal to fence at West Regional
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
With the for
malities of the
regular season
concluded, the
Stanford men's
fencing team
travels to Cal

State-Long Beach this weekend
to compete in the Western
Regional Fencing Champion
ships. The meet, to be held Fri
day through Sunday, will fea
ture six varsity teams from Cal
ifornia and other western
states.
Leading the squad into the
regionals is the foil team, which
has not lost its event in any
meet this year. Seniors Craig
Ring and Chris Gillen and
sophomore Duncan Bell have
been the starters, combining
for over 60 victories in 18 bouts
this season.
The sabre and epee teams
will be the decisive weapons
for the Cardinal this weekend.
While the foil team is expected
to win, the other two weapons
must keep their events close if
the team is to advance to the
NCAA tournament.
"If the foil team is in top
form, both physically and men
tally, then they should win
their event," Stanford Coach
Zoran Tulum said. "The sabre
and epee team must show well.
If they get blown out, we won't
win the fourteen bouts needed
to win a meet. The foil team
can't do it alone."
Most of the Cardinal's com
petition should come from UC-
Santa Cruz and Air Force. The
Falcons traditionally have a
strong program due to the fact
that numerous cadets try out
for the team to satisfy the
Academy's four-year physical
education requirement. The
sheer number of fencers allows
Air Force to cultivate experi
enced and talented fencers.
Santa Cruz enters the
regionals after challenging the
Cardinal fencers three weeks

ago. The Banana Slugs came
within one bout of beating
Stanford, eventually losing 14-
13. Santa Cruz also features
one of the West's most talented
fencers, Ted Lao.
Tulum expects Stanford to
do well, but is cautious in of
fering a prediction. "Many of
my fencers come from the
classes offered through the uni
versity," he said. "It's difficult
to win when we have so little
experience on the team. I will
be satisfied if we take second
place."
A round-robin format is fea
tured at the regionals. Each
team fences the other five in
a full 27-bout meet. The team
with the most victories will win
the regionals and advance to
the NCAA Tournament, to be
held in Princeton, NJ, during
the final week of March.
Individual fencers can also
qualify for the NCAAs through
the Western Regionals. The
best fencers from each region
qualify on the basis of their
regular season record against
varsity fencers, combined with
their record in the regionals.
The individual regional cham
pions in each weapon will also
qualify for the NCAAs.
Four Stanford fencers have
a chance at individually quali
fying for berths in the national
tournament. Foil fencer Chris
Gillen, 30-6 on the year, has
perhaps the best chance. Team
captain Dave Russ, fencing in
the sabre event, is 20-13 on
the season and has two years
of experience going into the
regionals.
Sophomore Duncan Bell has
compiled a record of 21-14
through the season and also
has a good shot at a berth,
while freshman Stan Brobston,
whom Tulum feels "has been
getting better and better every
day," is sure to be one of the
tournament's surprises.
Tulum views the importance
of this meet in terms much
more significant than winning
the western championship.
