# Volleyball hosts fierce Matadors
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
The story of
Stanford men's
volleyball
throughout
the 1988 season
is that the team
has consistently

handled inferior foes, but has
been unable to beat the higher
ranked opponents. In other
words, the young spikers are
beating the teams they should,
but are not having much suc
cess beyond that.
Let's hope that trend contin
ues through tonight, and then
ends. This evening at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford takes on Cal State-
Northridge in a game the Car
dinal should win, but the team
has to go at it again less than
24 hours later when the squad
plays the highly touted UCLA
Bruins Saturday â€” same place,
different time (7 p.m.).
"They (Northridge) will cer
tainly not be a pushover,"
Stanford Assistant Coach
Ruben Nieves said, "but that
is a match we would expect to
win." But these comments
from the Stanford assistant
came before the Matadors'
stunning victory over Pepper
dine two nights ago.
Northridge's big win Tues
day puts tonight's match in a
completely different light. The
victory, coupled with Stan
ford's loss to UC Santa Barbara
12 days ago, puts the Matadors

in a sixth-place tie with the
Cardinal in the Western Inter
collegiate Volleyball Associa
tion standings. Both teams
stand at 3-4 in league play.
Sixth place is certainly very re
spectable in the best conference
in the country, but it isn't high
enough to qualify for Western
Regionals come the end of
April.
"If only we had beaten Santa
Barbara," Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said, "we could be in a
tie for third place in the league
right now." But the Cardinal
loss to the Gauchos is now in
the past, and Cal State-
Northridge is presently at
hand. And after tonight's
match only one of the two
teams will be able to claim a
.500 record and sole possession
of sixth place in the conference.
Northridge will pressure
Stanford at the net, challeng
ing the Cardinal in an area
where the team has had a great
deal of success in the past three
weeks. Senior Jeff McClean (6-
foot-5), junior Ron Graening
(6-6), and junior Jeff Campbell
(6-7) will provide a formidable
middle blocking threat. Al
though the Cardinal has yet to
play the Matadors this season,
even the Stanford freshmen
know what they will be facing.
"I understand Northridge is
real big," freshman middle
blocker Mike Lowe said. "I
know that all of us will have
to play real tough to beat
them."
