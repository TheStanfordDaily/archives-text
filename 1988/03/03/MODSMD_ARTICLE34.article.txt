# Three seniors make Maples curtain call
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Tomorrow night is
probably the last
chance you'll ever
get to see them in
person, but don't
despair — they'll
probably make a

couple of television appearances.
No, we're not talking about a
rock band on its farewell tour,
we're talking about the senior
contingent of this year's Stanford
men's gymnastics team. And this
isn't just any senior contingent,
it's the best trio of gymnasts the
school has ever had, and they're
each threats to win NCAA titles
this spring.
When the national champion
ships end, so will their college
careers, but their careers on the
international level will just be be
ginning, and if any one of them

Sometimes you have
to be the hard-ass.'
— Chuck Gerardo

is hot on the right day, he will
be trading the red and white of
the Cardinal for the red, white,
and blue of the USA.
Last Friday night in Maples Pa
vilion, Randy Besosa, Chuck
Gerardo, and Mike Matzek led
Stanford to a score of 285.95, the
highest score in the nation so far
this season by over a point, and
a school record by over two. In
so doing, the three proved to all
skeptics that they not only have
talent, but the mental strength
to lead the Cardinal to an NCAA
title.

Though senior Chuck Gerardo's forte is pommel horse, his dynamic
moves on floor exercise keep him among the elite collegiate all
arounders.

Averaging 9.66 an event despite
two falls which led to the
loss of an entire point in their
scoring, the three provided a basis
for the confidence and the subse
quent solid performance of the
entire squad.
"Last year, not having any
seniors, we didn't really have that
leadership," sophomore Charles

Loop said, "and this year when
all three guys hit every single one
of their routines, it makes the
other guys feel so much better
that there is not as much pressure
for them to hit; it helps them to
do their best gymnastics and have
a lot more fun, too."
What are Besosa, Matzek and
Gerardo really like? This proved
a dangerous question which was
answered with raised eyebrows
and knowing smirks, so the
curious fan must be content with
the gymnastics side of things.

"Mike and Chuck and Randy
are totally different people," Loop
said. "Randy was the gymnast
coming out of high school.
Everybody knew who Randy Be
sosa was. Chuck was always top
-10, always Junior National Team,
. . . everybody looked up to his
technique and stuff, but not that
many people knew he was a super
gymnast."
"Mike was the total opposite.
He had made the junior team
maybe once and came in here not
even on scholarship, he walked
on. Now, each one has developed
into his own gymnast," Loop said.
Indeed. Besosa, from Mission
Viejo, is a two-time U.S. National
Team member and Stanford's
record holder for all-around
scoring. During a redshirt season
last year, Besosa increased his
strength dramatically and com
bines this power with the dynamic
flair and body control that fre
quently ranked him as the na
tion's top collegian two years ago.
Besosa's trademark ring and high
bar routines can be depended on
as crowd thrillers.
Gerardo is best known for his
almost frightening intensity dur
ing competition, which often has
his face in a scowl of concentra
tion. While Gerardo doesn't al
ways project the most stable men
tal state, Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada said he has taken well
to his leadership role, one which

Gerardo himself finds difficult but
rewarding.
"The seniors keep on pushing
and try to get everyone psyched
up as best we can," Gerardo said.
"Sometimes you have to be the
hard-ass, the tough guy, and
nobody likes that, but in the end,
when the results are out, I think
everyone is happy with you."
Matzek is currently ranked No.
12 in the United States. With a
build which would look impressive
on somebody twice his size and
one of the brighter smiles on
Earth, Matzek is a real crowd
pleaser who has a large and gig

gling following of pre-teen girls.
A phenomenal series of strength
moves on the rings and an espe
cially acrobatic floor routine high
light his superior talents.
Besosa said that the three un
derstand their importance to each
other, the team and the outcome
of this season. "We build off each
other's strengths and try to pick
up for each other's weaknesses."
Besosa said. "The team is going
to depend on us to set the pace
and the attitude at NCAAs. . . .
This year is it for us. There won't
be a second chance, there's no
looking back."

to depend on us to set the pace
and the attitude at NCAAs. . . .
This year is it for us. There won't
be a second chance, there's no
looking back."

Rounding out the trio of senior gymnasts is Randy Besosa, co
captain with Matzek. Besosa holds the school record in the all
around, thanks in part to his dazzling dismounts off high bar.
Tomorrow night is
probably the last
chance you'll ever
get to see them in
person, but don't
despair — they'll
probably make a

couple of television appearances.
No, we're not talking about a
rock band on its farewell tour,
we're talking about the senior
contingent of this year's Stanford
men's gymnastics team. And this
isn't just any senior contingent,
it's the best trio of gymnasts the
school has ever had, and they're
each threats to win NCAA titles
this spring.
When the national champion
ships end, so will their college
careers, but their careers on the
international level will just be be
ginning, and if any one of them

Sometimes you have
to be the hard-ass.'
— Chuck Gerardo

is hot on the right day, he will
be trading the red and white of
the Cardinal for the red, white,
and blue of the USA.
Last Friday night in Maples Pa
vilion, Randy Besosa, Chuck
Gerardo, and Mike Matzek led
Stanford to a score of 285.95, the
highest score in the nation so far
this season by over a point, and
a school record by over two. In
so doing, the three proved to all
skeptics that they not only have
talent, but the mental strength
to lead the Cardinal to an NCAA
title.

Though senior Chuck Gerardo's forte is pommel horse, his dynamic
moves on floor exercise keep him among the elite collegiate all
arounders.

Averaging 9.66 an event despite
two falls which led to the
loss of an entire point in their
scoring, the three provided a basis
for the confidence and the subse
quent solid performance of the
entire squad.
"Last year, not having any
seniors, we didn't really have that
leadership," sophomore Charles

Loop said, "and this year when
all three guys hit every single one
of their routines, it makes the
other guys feel so much better
that there is not as much pressure
for them to hit; it helps them to
do their best gymnastics and have
a lot more fun, too."
What are Besosa, Matzek and
Gerardo really like? This proved
a dangerous question which was
answered with raised eyebrows
and knowing smirks, so the
curious fan must be content with
the gymnastics side of things.

"Mike and Chuck and Randy
are totally different people," Loop
said. "Randy was the gymnast
coming out of high school.
Everybody knew who Randy Be
sosa was. Chuck was always top
-10, always Junior National Team,
. . . everybody looked up to his
technique and stuff, but not that
many people knew he was a super
gymnast."
"Mike was the total opposite.
He had made the junior team
maybe once and came in here not
even on scholarship, he walked
on. Now, each one has developed
into his own gymnast," Loop said.
Indeed. Besosa, from Mission
Viejo, is a two-time U.S. National
Team member and Stanford's
record holder for all-around
scoring. During a redshirt season
last year, Besosa increased his
strength dramatically and com
bines this power with the dynamic
flair and body control that fre
quently ranked him as the na
tion's top collegian two years ago.
Besosa's trademark ring and high
bar routines can be depended on
as crowd thrillers.
Gerardo is best known for his
almost frightening intensity dur
ing competition, which often has
his face in a scowl of concentra
tion. While Gerardo doesn't al
ways project the most stable men
tal state, Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada said he has taken well
to his leadership role, one which

Gerardo himself finds difficult but
rewarding.
"The seniors keep on pushing
and try to get everyone psyched
up as best we can," Gerardo said.
"Sometimes you have to be the
hard-ass, the tough guy, and
nobody likes that, but in the end,
when the results are out, I think
everyone is happy with you."
Matzek is currently ranked No.
12 in the United States. With a
build which would look impressive
on somebody twice his size and
one of the brighter smiles on
Earth, Matzek is a real crowd
pleaser who has a large and gig

gling following of pre-teen girls.
A phenomenal series of strength
moves on the rings and an espe
cially acrobatic floor routine high
light his superior talents.
Besosa said that the three un
derstand their importance to each
other, the team and the outcome
of this season. "We build off each
other's strengths and try to pick
up for each other's weaknesses."
Besosa said. "The team is going
to depend on us to set the pace
and the attitude at NCAAs. . . .
This year is it for us. There won't
be a second chance, there's no
looking back."
