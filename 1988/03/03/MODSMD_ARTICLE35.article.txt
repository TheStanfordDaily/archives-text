The Stanford Ultimate Frisbee
team hosted the Stanford Ultim
ate Invitational on the IM fields
this past weekend. In a rain-filled
two days of play, Stanford ex
tended its current winning streak
to 22 games and captured the
tournament title, its third tour
nament victory on the year.
The top 12 collegiate ultimate
teams in the West were on hand
Saturday to battle for the title.
In its first game, top-seeded Stan
ford was matched against the

seventh seed, defending national
champion Chabot College. The
Cardinal had no trouble with
Chabot, cruising to an impressive
15-3 victory. Stanford then came
out flat and overconfident against
Ohlone College, the tournament's
last seed, but managed to pull its
act together to record a 15-6 win.
Stanford took on a surprising Cal
State-Humboldt team in the day's
final game. After falling behind
5-2, Stanford switched from man
to-man into the team's formidable
zone defense and pulled out a 15-9
victory.

The team started out sluggishly
in the quarterfinals against UC-
Davis on Sunday. In a shortened
game played to 13, Stanford was
down a game point 12-11 when
some inspired defensive play al
lowed the Cardinal to escape with
a 14-12 overtime victory.
Stanford rode the momentum
of its come-from-behind win into
the semis and jumped all over Cal
State-San Luis Obispo, cruising
to a 15-9 victory. The win set up
a showdown with UC-Santa Bar
bara in the finals.
In the final game, played to 18,

Stanford was able to forge a slim
17-15 lead but nearly gave the
game away with some untimely
turnovers. UCSB managed to
deadlock the score at 17 to send
the game into overtime. Stanford
crawled back to a 20-19 lead and
finally, after a bitterly contested
last point, pulled out the game
with a 21-19 victory.
