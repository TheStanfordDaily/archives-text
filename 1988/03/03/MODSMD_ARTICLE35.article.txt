Ultimate Frisbee
The Stanford Ultimate Frisbee
team hosted the Stanford Ultim
ate Invitational on the IM fields
this past weekend. In a rain-filled
two days of play, Stanford ex
tended its current winning streak
to 22 games and captured the
tournament title, its third tour
nament victory on the year.
The top 12 collegiate ultimate
teams in the West were on hand
Saturday to battle for the title.
In its first game, top-seeded Stan
ford was matched against the

seventh seed, defending national
champion Chabot College. The
Cardinal had no trouble with
Chabot, cruising to an impressive
15-3 victory. Stanford then came
out flat and overconfident against
Ohlone College, the tournament's
last seed, but managed to pull its
act together to record a 15-6 win.
Stanford took on a surprising Cal
State-Humboldt team in the day's
final game. After falling behind
5-2, Stanford switched from man
to-man into the team's formidable
zone defense and pulled out a 15-9
victory.

The team started out sluggishly
in the quarterfinals against UC-
Davis on Sunday. In a shortened
game played to 13, Stanford was
down a game point 12-11 when
some inspired defensive play al
lowed the Cardinal to escape with
a 14-12 overtime victory.
Stanford rode the momentum
of its come-from-behind win into
the semis and jumped all over Cal
State-San Luis Obispo, cruising
to a 15-9 victory. The win set up
a showdown with UC-Santa Bar
bara in the finals.
In the final game, played to 18,

Stanford was able to forge a slim
17-15 lead but nearly gave the
game away with some untimely
turnovers. UCSB managed to
deadlock the score at 17 to send
the game into overtime. Stanford
crawled back to a 20-19 lead and
finally, after a bitterly contested
last point, pulled out the game
with a 21-19 victory.
Cycling
In its second weekend of col-
legiate racing this season, the
Stanford cycling team pulled off
some spectacular individual wins
at Cal Poly-Pomona, but was un
able to score well as a team.
Saturday's A criterium race was
started in a downpour that left
the course dangerously slippery.
Stanford freshman Coulter Rich
ardson outsprinted the entire field
to win the A race, while Hank
Dart, another Cardinal rider,
grabbed a fourth-place finish in
one of the primes.
Two Stanford riders did well in
the B category on Saturday. Dave
Louden won the field sprint to
take first in the race, and John
Shinn snatched a second-place
finish in a prime. Brian Bray
placed second in a prime to give
Stanford its only points in the C
race.
Stanford's Pam Stevenson
charged to a strong third-place
showing in the women's criteri
um. Another Cardinal rider, Libby
Feil. nlaced 12th.
Disaster struck the team in the
B race Sunday when two Stanford
racers were caught in a crash near
the finish. Lou O'Neill was the
Cardinal's highest finisher,
placing seventh.
