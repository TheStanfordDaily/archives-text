# The
						Stanford Reading List Debate
##

Lintitc V. Cheney

"One can go far with
intellectuals," scholar and
novelist Carolyn Heilbrun
once wrote, "if one keeps
a firm grip on the obvious
and announces it from
time to time." A debate
going on at Stanford Uni
versity could belie
Hielbrun's observation,
however. The course of
action most obviously
correct is being presented
there—and it may not go
far at all.
The matter is complex,
but ultimately comes
down to a simple ques
tion: Shall there be a list
of great books of Western
culture that all students at
Stanford read? Reports
from the university indi
cate there is no chance
that the current list of
some 30 required and rec
ommended works will be
kept as is, partly because
there are no writings by
women and ethnic
minorities on it. The cur
rent list is composed of
texts of inestimable value
—works by Homer, Ver
gil, Dante and Locke, to
name a few—but it does
need additions, lane Aus
ten's novels, Emily Dick
inson's poetry and
writing ought to be on it
—not because of the
gender or race of the au
thors, but because of the
value of what they
created.
And that is exactly the
position being advocated
by about two dozen

humanities faculty mem
bers at Stanford. Led by
Prof. William Chace, this
group wants to revise and
keep the list of Western
readings, a course that
seems so obvious, so
sensible —particularly
since Stanford students
are also required to take a
course in non-Western
culture. But when the fac
ulty senate votes, per
haps as early as Feb. IH,
Stanford may well vote to
have no Western reading
list at all.
One ot the most out
spoken members of the
no-list faction is William
King, a senior biology
major and head of the
Black Student Union.
King has declared that
adding women and
minorities to the current
list of Western readings is
"tokenism," a charge that
betrays insensitivity to
language, to say the least.
Emily Dickinson and
Martin Luther King Jr.
tokens? Hardly.
An even more intellec
tually confused attack is
that the list misrepresents
the basis of our culture by
being drawn overwhelm
ingly from Europe. This
attack neglects the fact
that the first entry on the
current reading list is the
Hebrew Bible, not exactly
a European product.
Even if the current list
were to be revised,
however, it would still
likely be mostly

European. And it should
be. While there are
manifold ways in which
non-Europeans have en
riched the life of this na
tion, they have done so
within a cultural
framework largely in
debted to Europe. "We
are a part of the West,"
Pulitzer Prize-winning
historian Carl Degler told
the faculty senate, "not
because this country
received Italians, Scots,
Germans, Greeks, Irish,
Poles and Scandinavians
within its borders, but be
cause the language,
religions, institutions,
laws, customs, literature
and—yes—the prejudices
of this country were
drawn overwhelmingly
from Europe."
Other attacks have
focused on the nature of
Western civilization,
denounced by one
placard being displayed
outside the faculty senate
as "rotten to the core."
Were the sentiment less
disturbing, one would
have to smile at the irony
of a demonstrating stu
dent unaware that among
Western civilization's
flowerings is the
democracy that makes
demonstrations possible.
Inside faculty senate,
Western civilization has
been declared outdated
by "political exigencies,"
"social realities" and
"scholarly understand
ings" of the last 20 years

—a rather hasty dismissal
of a concept that genera
tions have found of sus
taining value.
Given this furor, one
can see why a university
might not want to have a
list. As soon as you com
mit to paper what is most
worthy of attention,
people will disagree,
sometimes in unpleasant
ways. Nevertheless, com
ing to agreement on a
core of knowledge is one
of the most important
things a faculty can do.
First of all, it
demonstrates that some
things are more impor
tant than others. The
world is not a relativistic
stew where everything is
of equal importance.
Learning to sort out the
more valuable from the
less, the significant from
the trivial, the enduring
from the ephemeral is
difficult—but it is also
one the highest purposes
of education. When such
choices are not made, col
leges and university
—and the schools that
look to them for
leadership—fall all too
easily into the notion that
their purpose is simply to
teach students how to
think, a crucial skill, but
one unlikely to be
developed when there is
no decision as to what
students should think
about. A Gresham's law
takes over, with the easy
and entertaining driving

out the hard and chal
lenging. Teachers teach
popular novels and slas
her films instead of C har
lotte Bronte and
Shakespeare.
Even more important
are the social conse
quences of universities'
failing to come to grips
with the matter of what
students should know.
Our society, like all
societies, depends for its
cohesivesness on com
mon knowledge a
"symbolic code," Alfred
North Whitehead called
it. While that knowledge
must reflect the experi
ence of each new genera
tion, it must also be
linked to the tradition
that has formed the soci
ety, a tradition that in the
case of the United States
is decidedly Western.
Without this link to the
past, we are unmoored,
lacking the awareness of
where we are and who
we are, which is essential
to determining intel
ligently what we, as an
American community,
shall be. As Whitehead
put it, "Those societies
which cannot combine
reverence to their sym
bols with freedom of revi
sion must ultimately
decay."
With luck, someone
will put that on a placard
outside the next Stanford
faculty senate meeting.
