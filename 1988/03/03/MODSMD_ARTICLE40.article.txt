# Rally participants vent anger
## 
### James Mokhiber Staff writer 
Alternating between defiance,
jubilance and solemnity, marchers in
last night's "Take Back the Night"
march reflected a diversity of both
motivation and experience.
Many of the march participants
were members of groups such as the
Stanford Rape Education Project and
the Stanford Women's Center. Also
among the 100 marchers were several
families, couples and men.
Junior Eric McCabe said that he
and his girlfriend Daphne Edmundson
were marching because they often dis
cussed together the problems women
encounter on campus.
Citing an incident in which she was
followed home one night, Edmundson,*
a sophomore, said she no longer felt
"fearless." The march helped "take
away the vulnerability" women often
feel alone at night, she said.

Among the families in the march
were the Salsburgs. Ben Salsburg is
an employee of SLAC, and his
daughter is a feminist studies
meyor. »
"The reason I'm here is to turn my
anger into action," she said.
Senior Maria Botte voiced similar
sentiments. "This march is action, it
is saying that we're strong and not
scared," she said. "I think the night
is a magic place for women. It's more
than just being safe; it's being com
fortable in the unknown."
Others stressed the effects of this
fear. "It really cuts into the quality
of education a woman gets here," said
Merielle Flood, a graduate student in
anthropology who is also active in the
Women's Center. "It's not just
paranoia; it's something real we have
to deal with on a daily basis."
Anthropology Prof. Carol Delaney
said she was participating because she
was affected by a women's curfew

while still a student. "At that time I
protested and said that there should
be a curfew for men, and women
should have the freedom on the
streets," she said.
Several dozen men also took part
in the march. According to senior
Debbie Marvil, one of the march or
ganizers, such a turnout of men was
a welcome development.
Robert Burlinson, an undeclared
sophomore and a member of the
Sigma Chi fraternity, said he stopped
to listen to the White Plaza rally after
the march because discrimination
against women is also a problem with
which men should be concerned.
"Sexism is like smog, and as men
we all just breathe it in and don't
realize how it affects women," he said.
Burlinson added that a visit of the
Rape Education Project to Sigma Chi
has also made him more aware of
problems women encounter at Stan
ford.
