# In this issue:
## An AIDS update 
### 
AIDS is a health problem with powerful
social, cultural, economic and political dimen
sions. A minute yet devastating virus is chal
lenging our most private assumptions of our
selves and of others.
Will this challenge move us toward reaction
or proaction? Is AIDS about "them" and not
about "us"? Is AIDS about people who are
sexually active and not about those who are
not? Is AIDS just about white gay men? Do
you really have to be concerned about AIDS
at Stanford?
We encourage you to read this issue of The
Student Body with these questions in mind.
Some of the language in the issue is neces
sarily explicit. If we are going to confront the
impact of AIDS and empower ourselves to
deal with it, then we have to be explicit.
We have to distinguish knowing from doing.
We have to be willing to do both. Yet knowing
"safer sex" practices, distinguishing safe be
haviors from risky ones is not an invitation
to break personal values or spiritual
paradigms. It is an invitation to be part of
the solution and not part of the problem.
