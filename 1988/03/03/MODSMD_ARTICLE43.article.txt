# Taking Care of Ralph
## 
### John Dorman, M.D. Director of Medicine at Cowell 
I had seen only one previous patient with AIDS. Generally I
considered it a disease that was up in San Francisco, not here
at Stanford. Ralph — not his real name — was an older graduate
student, and he was homosexual. He was not particularly promis
cuous. He had a job in a field in which I had some interest,
and he became my friend as well as my patient.
Although Ralph came to Cowell several times for sexually
related complaints over his graduate-school career, I had not seen
him for these. I had seen him twice for minor problems before
he came to my office early in fall quarter several years ago, with

a one-week history of
abdominal pain. I
wasn't sure what was
wrong with him that
day. I didn't think he
had appendicitis, but I
did think that a parasite
was a possibility, as
sometimes happens
with gay men. Lab tests
were suggestive but not
especially helpful.
Over the next couple
of days, he was getting
worse, but the test
results didn't hang to
gether at all. It's hard
to remember how I felt

then — doctors write information on charts about patients, not
how they themselves are reacting to the situation.
There are, however, words like "uncertain," "possible consid
erations," and "will try.. .." It's clear from Ralph's chart that I
did not really know what was going on. Often, confusing com
binations of symptoms and lab results will be found in
rheumatologic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.
Consequently, I referred him to a rheumatologist.
The rheumatologist felt an abdominal mass, to my surprise.
An X-ray of the large intestine was highly suggestive of cancer,
and Ralph was referred to a surgeon for removal of the mass.
It was not cancer. Ralph had a rare fungal infection that most
victims get only mildly in their lungs. Ralph's infection was in

his large intestine, and it was not mild.
Knowing that he was gay and now
had a very unusual infection, the med
ical staff at the hospital made a
presumptive diagnosis of AIDS.
The testing that we have now is not
perfect, but it is quite definitive. How
ever, it was not available at that time.
Since not much was known about
casual contagion, Ralph was immedi
ately put in isolation, and everyone
going in to see him had to put on
gown, mask and gloves. I recall think
ing that of all times, this was not the
time that he needed to be isolated —
he needed to have people around him.
I tried to visit him every day.
Surprisingly, Ralph got better from
his fungal infection. He had in
travenous treatment three times a
week for about four months. Over the
seven or eight months following the
IV therapy he came back to see me
about once a month, usually with a
minor complaint that he wanted
checked out. He would apologize for
being a hypochondriac, but we both
felt that everything needed to be
checked out, however small.

Nothing serious ever showed up. I
think both of us felt like the mythical
sword of Damocles was hanging by a
thread over his head. I searched the
medical literature for evidence that
maybe he didn't really have AIDS
after all. One report even indicated
that the fungal infection from which
he had recovered could mimic AIDS.
Ralph graduated from Stanford, but
we had gone through so much together
that I agreed to keep him on as a
private patient. As news of his diag
nosis leaked out, he lost his job. He
eventually requested that I refer him
up to a physician in San Francisco
who specialized in AIDS.
Using the newly available ELISA
diagnostic test, he confirmed the diag
nosis, to our sorrow but not to our
surprise. However, he also said that
he had several patients like Ralph —
although they definitely had the dis
ease, they were doing quite well
months or years after diagnosis.
Eventually Ralph decided to move
back home. It was with a mixture of
relief and sadness that I sent him off,
in apparent good health, with a letter
of referral to physicians there. Last
fall, I learned that he had died at
home the previous spring. He had ap
parently gotten worse almost immedi

ately on his arrival there.
Doctors are supposed to be used to
death — we ultimately fail with all of
our patients. I had had many patients
die when I was in training, and more
recently, on sabbatical in Africa. But
one of the characteristics of student
health is that patients hardly ever die
— even if they are seriously ill. Usually
they drop out of school first. Maybe
I had gotten out of the habit of ac
cepting death when it came.
I'm not sure what I learned from
Ralph. Since he looked so well when
I last saw him, I'm not sure that I
ever really believed, on an emotional
level, that he had AIDS until I learned
that he was dead. That disbelief is
perhaps the scariest part — that some
one so young and apparently healthy
can have a fatal disease that kills so
fast.
Ralph at least knew that he had
AIDS. How many other infected —
but apparently healthy — people are
out there? The inevitability of Ralph's
death certainly underscores the need
for the kind of educational effort that
we have made at Stanford.
Like me, many physicians will lose
patients they care about who have
AIDS. The statistics and predictions
make it almost certain.
All of you — be careful out there.
