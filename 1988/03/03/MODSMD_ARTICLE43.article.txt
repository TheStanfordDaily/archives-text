# Taking Care of Ralph
## 
### John Dorman, M.D. Director of Medicine at Cowell 
I had seen only one previous patient with AIDS. Generally I
considered it a disease that was up in San Francisco, not here
at Stanford. Ralph — not his real name — was an older graduate
student, and he was homosexual. He was not particularly promis
cuous. He had a job in a field in which I had some interest,
and he became my friend as well as my patient.
Although Ralph came to Cowell several times for sexually
related complaints over his graduate-school career, I had not seen
him for these. I had seen him twice for minor problems before
he came to my office early in fall quarter several years ago, with

a one-week history of
abdominal pain. I

wrong with him that

were suggestive but not

Over the next couple

then — doctors write information on charts about patients, not
how they themselves are reacting to the situation.
There are, however, words like "uncertain," "possible consid

did not really know what was going on. Often, confusing com

rheumatologic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.
Consequently, I referred him to a rheumatologist.
The rheumatologist felt an abdominal mass, to my surprise.
An X-ray of the large intestine was highly suggestive of cancer,
and Ralph was referred to a surgeon for removal of the mass.
It was not cancer. Ralph had a rare fungal infection that most
victims get only mildly in their lungs. Ralph's infection was in
