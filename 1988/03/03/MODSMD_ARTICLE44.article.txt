AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome): A serious condition char
acterized by a defect in natural im
munity against disease. With this loss
of immune response, the individual
falls prey to a host of what are called
"opportunistic infections." AIDS is not
highly contagious. AIDS is specifically
transmitted through sexual contact or
by direct infusion of infected blood or
blood products.
ARC (AIDS-Related Complex): Char
acterized by fever, wasting and/or
fungus infection of mouth and throat.
It is not known what percentage of
people with ARC will go on to develop
full-blown AIDS.
Carrier: Virus-infected individuals
with no symptoms. Most of these
people are unaware that they are in
fected. These individuals represent a
major potential source of new infection
since they are fully capable of trans
mitting the virus to others.
Cofactors: Other characteristics of the
individual that may make them more
susceptible to the AIDS virus.
ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosor
bent Assay): A test measuring an
tibodies in the blood to the HIV virus.
This test tells only that the individual
has been exposed to the virus. It does
not predict that that individual will
develop AIDS.
False Negative: A negative test on
someone who has been infected by
the virus but for some reason has not
developed the antibody.
False Positive: A positive test for HIV
antibody, usually a result of an artifact
of the laboratory test, in someone who
has not been exposed to the virus. All
persons with positive results should
have the test repeated at least once.
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency
Virus); The virus that causes AIDS.
Also called HTLV-111/LAV.
HTLV-111 (Human T-Lymphotrophic
Virus Type III); The virus that causes
AIDS. Also called HIV and LAV.
Incubation Period: The time between
infection with the AIDS virus and the
onset of symptoms. Seems to range
from six months to eight years or more.
Opportunistic Infections: Illnesses
that would not be a threat to anyone
whose immune svstem was functioning
normally.
Pneumocystic Carinii (PCP): A
parasitic infect >t of the lungs. One
of the two rare ii c. that affect 85

percent of AIDS patients. PCP has
symptoms similar to any other form
of severe pneumonia, cough, fever and
difficulty breathing. This infection
rarely if ever affects individuals with
normal immunity.
Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS): A type of can
cer usually occurring on the surface
of the skin or in the mouth. KS may
also spread to other organs of the body.
Normally found as a slowly progressing
cancer in elderly men.
"Safer Sex": Relatively "safer sex" is
condom-protected sex with the use of
spermicidal foam and lubricants.
Sexual practices involving tissue injury
(e.g., anal sex) are extremely dangerous
and should be avoided. Unprotected
oral sex carries the potential of viral
transmission.

Less risky
