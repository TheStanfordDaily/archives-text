						letter on AIDS at Stanford
## 
### 
There is no substantial evidence that casual contact
or sharing living or learning facilities with a person
infected with the AIDS virus constitutes an unac
ceptable risk. We see no reason to deny an infected
student access to Stanford courses, programs or
facilities.
We also also want to help those with the virus
or who fear possible infection. Assurance that basic
status as a student is in no way affected is important,
but not enough. Friends, intimate and casual, and
family will need compassion, support and advice
concerning decisions about how life is to be lived
under this shadow. Confidential counseling and med
ical treatment is avaliable here to help with these
matters.
AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease. It is
preventable through modification of sexual behavior.
Efforts, for now, are aimed tirelessly at educating
people to accept "safer sex" methods without ex
ception, unless they have established permanently
monogamous relationships. "Safer sex" is not only
using condoms, barriers or spermicides; it can also
be abstinence until a relationship is established, and
talking openly about past sexual history with pro
spective partners. It is avoiding risk, and getting
tested when risk was unavoidable. In summary,
counseling, education and testing are services that
your health services offer you. As is always the case
at Cowell, visits are confidential.
