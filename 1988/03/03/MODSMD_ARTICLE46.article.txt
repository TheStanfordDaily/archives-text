Casual contact
There is no evidence at this time
that the AIDS virus (known as Human
Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV) can
be transmitted through the use of
public swimming pools, spas, hot tubs,
showers or toilets used previously by
an infected individual, or by "rubbing
shoulders" with an AIDS patient or
carrier in a theater, store or work place.
The virus does not survive in water,
and no cases have been reported in
volving documented transmission
through the air. Similarly, there is no
evidence that AIDS can be contracted
from dishes, food or personal objects
touched by a patient or carrier.
Available evidence indicates that the
AIDS virus can be transmitted almost
exclusively through transfer of body
fluids, either through intimate contact
(e.g., through vaginal or anal inter
course) or intravenous injection.
Infectivity
Although the virus that causes AIDS
can be passed from individual to in
dividual and is, by definition, infec
tious, body fluids of infected
individuals are not highly contagious.
This contention is supported by the
fact that there have been fewer than
a dozen reported instances of infection
with the AIDS virus among health
care workers in the United States spe
cifically linked to occupational expo
sure.
Exposure refers not only to the
direct care of these patients or the
handling of food, blood, bedpans, etc.,
but also to numerous incidents of ex
posure to potentially infected body
fluids.
In the United States, there have
now been more than 1000 "AIDS
needlestick injuries," many followed
for more than three years. As of
February 1988, fewer than 20 of the
victims have even developed an
tibodies to the AIDS virus.
These data, while not definitive,
suggest that not only is exposure to
blood or intimate sexual contact re
quired for infection but also that the
amount of the virus to which the in
dividual is exposed is critical. This
observation probably explains why the
AIDS virus infection has never been
shown to be transmitted by a mosquito
bite.
AIDS, ARC and the Carrier State
As of February 1988 there were ap
proximately 28,500 reported cases of
the full-blown AIDS syndrome in this
country. There are at least three to
five times as many patients with
symptomatic AIDS-related conditions.
Beyond these individuals, however,
there are perhaps one to two million
individuals without symptoms but in
fected with the virus — the vast

majority of whom are unaware that
they are infected. These individuals
represent a major potential source of
new infections since, as far as we know,
they are fully capable of transmitting
the virus to others.
Current information suggests that
most persons infected with the AIDS
virus will eventually develop AIDS.
However, of those individuals who are
infected with the virus, only 20 to 30
percent are expected to contract the
full-blown AIDS syndrome over a five
year period. Perhaps an additional 30
percent will contract one of the lesser
AIDS-related conditions, and up to
perhaps 50 percent will remain as
asymptomatic "carriers" during the
five-year post-exposure period.
As far as we know, infected indi
viduals remain infected, and poten
tially infectious, for their lifetimes.
Even among those who show
symptoms, the time from initial expo-

sure to the onset of symptoms is on
average close to five years and ranges
from six months to 10 years or more.
Of great importance at present, most
individuals carrying the virus and ca
pable of transmitting it to others are
unaware of their status and do not
feel ill. It seems likely that a number
of such individuals are working or
going to school at Stanford. It is also
probable that those individuals who
are known to have a symptomatic
AIDS-related condition represent a
minority of the group infected with
the AIDS virus.
At-Risk Populations
Current information indicates that
approximately 70 percent of AIDS
patients in this country are homosexual
or bisexual men. This figure has
remained relatively constant since the
outbreak was first noted, in Ap
proximately 20 percent of cases have

involved illicit drug-users who inject
drugs into their blood. Presumably
these people have been exposed to
the virus by use of virus-contaminated
needles.
Approximately 2 percent of individ
uals with AIDS have contracted the
disease through transfusion of blood
or blood products contaminated with
the AIDS virus.
To date, 1 percent of AIDS patients
appear to have acquired the virus
during intimate heterosexual contact.
Despite this low figure, there is no
question that the AIDS virus can be
transmitted from male to female and
from female to male during vaginal or
anal intercourse. In central Africa, for
example, where in some cities more
than 20 percent of adults are infected
with the AIDS virus, heterosexual sex
is the major mode of virus transmis
sion, and fully half of AIDS patients
are women.

Although there are a number of fac
tors that have contributed to the rapid
heterosexual spread of AIDS in central
Africa, the number of U.S. AIDS cases
resulting from heterosexual transmis
sion is expected to increase signifi
cantly over the next five years.
Potential major sources of such trans
mission are infected bisexual men and
illicit drug-users of either sex.
Testing
What is the status of our current
ability to test individuals for the pres
ence of the AIDS virus? At present,
the only routine testing is designed to
detect the antibody to the AIDS virus,
not the virus itself. The presence of
the antibody documents prior exposure
to the virus and indicates that the
individual is probably capable of in
fecting others.
Presence of the antibody further in
dicates that liarruiK a major medical
breakthrough — the individual is likely

to develop AIDS at some point over
the next decade. A positive antibody
test does not, however, indicate when
the individual is likely to become ill.
Furthermore, the current test is fre
quently associated with false positive
results and, rarely, false negative
results. Fortunately, more sophisti
cated "confirmatory" tests are now
available that can distinguish true
positive from false positive antibody
results.
Treatment and Prevention
At present, there is no cure for HIV
infection, and nearly all patients with
full-blown AIDS syndrome die within
two years of diagnosis. Only one drug
(AZT) has been shown to prolong life,
but this drug is highly toxic. Most
patients experience relatively short
term benefits from it.
A number of new and promising
drugs are in various stages of testing,
and it seems likely that therapy for
AIDS patients will improve substan
tially over the next few years. None
theless, there is little or no chance
that a definitive cure will be developed
in the foreseeable future.
As far as prevention is concerned,
a great many resources are currently
being directed to the development of
an AIDS vaccine that would, if com
pletely successful, prevent infection in
vaccinated individuals who are not yet
infected.
Unfortunately, the likelihood is low
that a fully effective and safe vaccine
will be developed any time within the
next decade. Therefore, for the
foreseeable future, individuals can
reduce their potential exposure only
by avoiding risk behavior. Adherence
to the following guidelines should
greatly reduce the risk of exposure to
the AIDS virus. To reduce your risk
of contracting AIDS:
• Unless you know that a sex partner
is not infected: Don't allow his/her
blood (including menstrual blood),
semen, vaginal secretions or urine to
enter your vagina, anus or mouth. Do
not engage in sex when you or your
partner have any lesions, open broken
skin or sores in the genital area. Use
condoms for vaginal, oral and anal sex
during every sexual encounter. The
AIDS virus cannot get through a con
dom if it is properly used and does
not break. The spermicide Nonoxynol
-9 kills the virus on contact. Use prod
ucts containing Nonoxynol-9 in
addition to a condom.
• If you think you might be infected:
Never allow your blood, urine, or
vaginal secretions to enter another per
son's body. Always use a condom for
sex.
Women
The Public Health Service has rec
ommended that women with evidence
(clinical, epidemiologic or serologic) of
infection with HIV should postpone
or avoid pregnancy to prevent trans
mission to the fetus or newborn.
