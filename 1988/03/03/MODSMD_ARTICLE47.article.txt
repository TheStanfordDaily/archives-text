# RISKS
## Risks to homosexuals 
### Carlos Greaves, M.D. Psychiatrist, Psychological Services 
Recendy in London, U.S. Surgeon
General Everett Koop expressed the
view that the AIDS pandemic has be
come the most serious health challenge
of the 20th century, and that the world
will have to carry its efforts to combat
this disease well into the next century.
This authoritative opinion surely
concerns all humans, yet in this writing
I will address issues specific to gay
students. Gays carry a greater burden
of concern given the unfortunate
epidemiology of this illness.
As of today, gay men remain the
group at greatest risk for exposure to
HIV, given the high prevalence of in
fection, particularly among urban gay
communities. The following statistics
provide a sense of the seriousness of
the situation.
During the first two weeks of this
year, more than 1000 new cases of
AIDS in the United States were re
ported to the Centers for Disease Con
trol in Atlanta. Of these, 93 percent
were males, and of these, 66 percent
were gay men with no other risk factors
(such as the shared use of needles for
drug abuse or blood transfusion
related transmissions).
This percentage remains the same
when taking into account the cumula
tive number of cases since the outbreak
of the epidemic in this country. As of
January 18, 1988, the total number of
cases diagnosed was 51,361. During
1987, in California, the number of diag
noses almost doubled over the number
in 1986.
Since the beginning of the epidemic,
63.6 percent of gay men with AIDS
have died, yet of those diagnosed in
1981, 92 percent are now dead. When
considering all cases diagnosed, 67
percent fall between the ages of 20
and 40.
A well-documented study shows that
roughly one out of every two gay men
in San Francisco is HIV-positive and
capable of transmitting the AIDS virus.
These numbers speak clearly: bad
news! The AIDS epidemic is strong

and seemingly getting stronger. A
piece of good news is that the rate of
seroconversion in the gay community
in San Francisco, from HIV-negative
to HIV-positive, is getting close to
zero. This is obviously the result of a
major change in sexual practices within
the community, both an effect of ex
plicit educational efforts as well as
confrontation with the frightful reality

AIDS is striking minorities, too.
On January 25, 1988, the Centers
for Disease Control reported that
there were 51,916 Americans with
AIDS. Of these, 31,282 were
white, 13,286 were black, 7,777
were Latino, and 448 were from
other ethnic groups.

of friends and lovers succumbing to
the illness.
Unfortunately, a preventive vaccine
is not in sight, so it looks as if the
only way for a gay man to survive this
catastrophe is through a persistent,
rigorous and disciplined adherence to
the "safer sex" guidelines, coupled
with a significant reduction in number
of sexual partners. The less, the better.
Surely, sexual abstinence ensures
safety, yet for the great majority, this
is felt as an unrealistic or unnecessary
choice. Nonetheless, until a very spe
cial person is encountered, sexual
gratification through a rich variety of
masturbatory techniques, is absolutely
safe.
Another important factor relates to
the use of alcohol and/or drugs in
association with sex. They constitute
the single most important behavior
that affects an individual or the
couple's judgment as to what behavior
is or is not safe. In other words, sur
vival from this epidemic means direct

ing oneself towards safe, monogamous,
drug-free sex.
For most gay men, it is quite clear
what "safer sex" means, yet it is not
redundant to outline the basics:
• Cover your penis with a latex con
dom everytime you have any sort of
sexual activity with another person.
• Use a lubricant containing
Nonoxinol-9 inside and outside the
condom whenever engaging in anal
intercourse, avoid douching and con
sider disengagement at the moment
of orgasm.
• Do not use oil-based lubricants; they
affect the structure of the latex, making
the condom prone to breakage.
• Avoid deep kissing only if you and
your partner both have bleeding

wounds in the oral cavity; otherwise
experts reassure us that kissing is and
that saliva does not transmit the virus.
• Although there have not been any
reported cases of oral-genital transmis
sion to date, given the slight possibility
(such as semen in contact with a bleed
ing gum), this behavior remains in the
category of "possibly safe." Use your
judgement.
Implementing the above guidelines
without the feeling that sex has be
come overly clinical to the detriment
of erotic/romantic feelings, requires a
thorough familiarization with condoms.
The best way to achieve this is by
"solo" practice. Eroticize their use so
that they become an integral part of
your repertoire of foreplay and coital
techniques and behaviors.
For many to whom anal stimulation
during sex is an important ingredient
for the achievement of an erotic
response, the use of so-called "sexual
toys" offers an entirely safe alternative

behavior to penile penetration, pro
vided they are not mutually shared.
If you are a gay student with a
positive HIV test, the situation has
improved during the past two years.
The wider use of AZr seems to prove
beneficial in maintaining or increasing
the number of T-cells, those immune
masterminds invaded by the virus,
which are directly related to the body's
response to infection.
Many other drugs, in the process
of being developed and tested, may
slow down or even prevent the replica
tion and spread of the virus. Recent
advances in psychoneuroinmunology
confirm the standing belief that a
healthy and relaxed organism, well
balanced in terms of body, mind and
spirit, makes a difference as to the
progression or relative quiescence of
the infection.
A balanced diet, adequate sleep, reg
ular exercise, avoidance of drugs, and
alcohol, prevention of other STDs,
avoiding physical exhaustion and/or ex
cessive tension, will all tend to improve
your natural immunity. A positive at
titude of acceptance, leading to crea
tive ways of maximizing your life's
potential, will make a difference, as
opposed to defeatist resignation, guilt
and despair, which most likely will
depress your immune response, thus
fostering viral replication and invasion
of new T-cells.
It is of paramount importance to
seek out and nurture supportive net
works, not only with friends and fam
ily, but through established groups
where the issues involved are dis
cussed openly. The tendency toward
isolation and secrecy or the indulgence
in feelings of shame and guilt must
be resisted with great courage, for
these are as detrimental as the virus
itself.
It behooves you to sharpen and ac
tualize your coping mechanisms so that
you remain "on top" of your life sit
uation. In this context, participation
in group and/or individual counseling
can be most beneficial.
Of course, an ongoing relationship
with an understanding, knowledgeable
and compassionate physician, who
hopefully is not homophobic, is a ne
cessity. For those gay students in the
process of "coming out," AIDS poses
a serious dilemma. The reaffirmation
and integration of a gay identity is not
only based on the individual's percep
tion of his or her capacity to love
members of the same sex, but also, in
the actual experiences of satisfying
sexual acts.
Hopefully, the eagerness to go
through such experiences will be
matched by a high degree of caution
and good judgment. In other words,
strict observance of "safer sex" prac
tices is of great importance. AIDS has
nothing to do with the homosexual
lifestyle being equal to the heterosex
ual one, as valid ways of being in the
world. It is very important for Gay
men as well as for all in society to
maintain a healthy distinction between
what is an infectious agent leading to
a lethal illness in any person and the
homosexual or bisexual lifestyle. The
blurring of this distinction leads to
unnecessary fallout from a disease that
has enough tragedy associated with it
already.

the actual experiences of satisfying
sexual acts.
Hopefully, the eagerness to go

and good judgment. In other words,
strict observance of "safer sex" prac
tices is of great importance. AIDS has
nothing to do with the homosexual
lifestyle being equal to the heterosex
ual one, as valid ways of being in the
world. It is very important for Gay
men as well as for all in society to
maintain a healthy distinction between
what is an infectious agent leading to
a lethal illness in any person and the
homosexual or bisexual lifestyle. The
blurring of this distinction leads to
unnecessary fallout from a disease that
has enough tragedy associated with it
already.
Recendy in London, U.S. Surgeon
General Everett Koop expressed the
view that the AIDS pandemic has be
come the most serious health challenge
of the 20th century, and that the world
will have to carry its efforts to combat
this disease well into the next century.
This authoritative opinion surely
concerns all humans, yet in this writing
I will address issues specific to gay
students. Gays carry a greater burden
of concern given the unfortunate
epidemiology of this illness.
As of today, gay men remain the
group at greatest risk for exposure to
HIV, given the high prevalence of in
fection, particularly among urban gay
communities. The following statistics
provide a sense of the seriousness of
the situation.
During the first two weeks of this
year, more than 1000 new cases of
AIDS in the United States were re
ported to the Centers for Disease Con
trol in Atlanta. Of these, 93 percent
were males, and of these, 66 percent
were gay men with no other risk factors
(such as the shared use of needles for
drug abuse or blood transfusion
related transmissions).
This percentage remains the same
when taking into account the cumula
tive number of cases since the outbreak
of the epidemic in this country. As of
January 18, 1988, the total number of
cases diagnosed was 51,361. During
1987, in California, the number of diag
noses almost doubled over the number
in 1986.
Since the beginning of the epidemic,
63.6 percent of gay men with AIDS
have died, yet of those diagnosed in
1981, 92 percent are now dead. When
considering all cases diagnosed, 67
percent fall between the ages of 20
and 40.
A well-documented study shows that
roughly one out of every two gay men
in San Francisco is HIV-positive and
capable of transmitting the AIDS virus.
These numbers speak clearly: bad
news! The AIDS epidemic is strong

and seemingly getting stronger. A
piece of good news is that the rate of
seroconversion in the gay community
in San Francisco, from HIV-negative
to HIV-positive, is getting close to
zero. This is obviously the result of a
major change in sexual practices within
the community, both an effect of ex
plicit educational efforts as well as
confrontation with the frightful reality

AIDS is striking minorities, too.
On January 25, 1988, the Centers
for Disease Control reported that
there were 51,916 Americans with
AIDS. Of these, 31,282 were
white, 13,286 were black, 7,777
were Latino, and 448 were from
other ethnic groups.

of friends and lovers succumbing to
the illness.
Unfortunately, a preventive vaccine
is not in sight, so it looks as if the
only way for a gay man to survive this
catastrophe is through a persistent,
rigorous and disciplined adherence to
the "safer sex" guidelines, coupled
with a significant reduction in number
of sexual partners. The less, the better.
Surely, sexual abstinence ensures
safety, yet for the great majority, this
is felt as an unrealistic or unnecessary
choice. Nonetheless, until a very spe
cial person is encountered, sexual
gratification through a rich variety of
masturbatory techniques, is absolutely
safe.
Another important factor relates to
the use of alcohol and/or drugs in
association with sex. They constitute
the single most important behavior
that affects an individual or the
couple's judgment as to what behavior
is or is not safe. In other words, sur
vival from this epidemic means direct

ing oneself towards safe, monogamous,
drug-free sex.
For most gay men, it is quite clear
what "safer sex" means, yet it is not
redundant to outline the basics:
• Cover your penis with a latex con
dom everytime you have any sort of
sexual activity with another person.
• Use a lubricant containing
Nonoxinol-9 inside and outside the
condom whenever engaging in anal
intercourse, avoid douching and con
sider disengagement at the moment
of orgasm.
• Do not use oil-based lubricants; they
affect the structure of the latex, making
the condom prone to breakage.
• Avoid deep kissing only if you and
your partner both have bleeding

wounds in the oral cavity; otherwise
experts reassure us that kissing is and
that saliva does not transmit the virus.
• Although there have not been any
reported cases of oral-genital transmis
sion to date, given the slight possibility
(such as semen in contact with a bleed
ing gum), this behavior remains in the
category of "possibly safe." Use your
judgement.
Implementing the above guidelines
without the feeling that sex has be
come overly clinical to the detriment
of erotic/romantic feelings, requires a
thorough familiarization with condoms.
The best way to achieve this is by
"solo" practice. Eroticize their use so
that they become an integral part of
your repertoire of foreplay and coital
techniques and behaviors.
For many to whom anal stimulation
during sex is an important ingredient
for the achievement of an erotic
response, the use of so-called "sexual
toys" offers an entirely safe alternative

behavior to penile penetration, pro
vided they are not mutually shared.
If you are a gay student with a
positive HIV test, the situation has
improved during the past two years.
The wider use of AZr seems to prove
beneficial in maintaining or increasing
the number of T-cells, those immune
masterminds invaded by the virus,
which are directly related to the body's
response to infection.
Many other drugs, in the process
of being developed and tested, may
slow down or even prevent the replica
tion and spread of the virus. Recent
advances in psychoneuroinmunology
confirm the standing belief that a
healthy and relaxed organism, well
balanced in terms of body, mind and
spirit, makes a difference as to the
progression or relative quiescence of
the infection.
A balanced diet, adequate sleep, reg
ular exercise, avoidance of drugs, and
alcohol, prevention of other STDs,
avoiding physical exhaustion and/or ex
cessive tension, will all tend to improve
your natural immunity. A positive at
titude of acceptance, leading to crea
tive ways of maximizing your life's
potential, will make a difference, as
opposed to defeatist resignation, guilt
and despair, which most likely will
depress your immune response, thus
fostering viral replication and invasion
of new T-cells.
It is of paramount importance to
seek out and nurture supportive net
works, not only with friends and fam
ily, but through established groups
where the issues involved are dis
cussed openly. The tendency toward
isolation and secrecy or the indulgence
in feelings of shame and guilt must
be resisted with great courage, for
these are as detrimental as the virus
itself.
It behooves you to sharpen and ac
tualize your coping mechanisms so that
you remain "on top" of your life sit
uation. In this context, participation
in group and/or individual counseling
can be most beneficial.
Of course, an ongoing relationship
with an understanding, knowledgeable
and compassionate physician, who
hopefully is not homophobic, is a ne
cessity. For those gay students in the
process of "coming out," AIDS poses
a serious dilemma. The reaffirmation
and integration of a gay identity is not
only based on the individual's percep
tion of his or her capacity to love
members of the same sex, but also, in
the actual experiences of satisfying
sexual acts.
Hopefully, the eagerness to go
through such experiences will be
matched by a high degree of caution

in feelings of shame and guilt must
be resisted with great courage, for
these are as detrimental as the virus
itself.
It behooves you to sharpen and ac
tualize your coping mechanisms so that
you remain "on top" of your life sit
uation. In this context, participation
in group and/or individual counseling
can be most beneficial.
Of course, an ongoing relationship
with an understanding, knowledgeable
and compassionate physician, who
hopefully is not homophobic, is a ne
cessity. For those gay students in the
process of "coming out," AIDS poses
a serious dilemma. The reaffirmation
and integration of a gay identity is not
only based on the individual's percep
tion of his or her capacity to love
members of the same sex, but also, in
the actual experiences of satisfying
sexual acts.
Hopefully, the eagerness to go
through such experiences will be
matched by a high degree of caution
and good judgment. In other words,
strict observance of "safer sex" prac
tices is of great importance. AIDS has
nothing to do with the homosexual
lifestyle being equal to the heterosex
ual one, as valid ways of being in the
world. It is very important for Gay
men as well as for all in society to
maintain a healthy distinction between
what is an infectious agent leading to
a lethal illness in any person and the
homosexual or bisexual lifestyle. The
blurring of this distinction leads to
unnecessary fallout from a disease that
has enough tragedy associated with it
already.
