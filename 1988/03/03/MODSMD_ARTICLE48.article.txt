# Risks to women
## 
### Sylvia C. Bowen Instructor, Human Biology Department 
Most Americans have difficulty
changing behaviors simply on the basis
of a rational analysis of risk. Many
college-educated people still don't
make decisions based upon statistical
understanding of risks and benefits.
In the area of sexuality and sexual
decision-making, "romantic attitudes"
or feelings of ambivalence or doubt
make most of us even worse at educat
ing and protecting ourselves against
possible negative outcomes. This dis
cussion seeks to put into context the
relative risk of AIDS and other HIV
infections for college women.
The two major routes of transmission
of the Human Immunedeficiency Virus
(HIV) relevant to college women are,

of course, sexual activity and IV drug
abuse.
After stating that IV drug-use with
unsterile needles is an incredibly ef
fective way to transmit many danger
ous infections, including HIV, we can
leave risks associated with IV-use to
other articles.
Sexual activities are the behavior
in which college women participate
that could transmit HIV. The types of
sexual activities have been categorized
by doctors and scientists into
categories of relative risk such as
"safe," "possibly safe" and "unsafe."
These categories are based upon the
level of scientific understanding about
the way the virus is able to infect
people. Transmission requires that a
virus shed from an infected person
remain warm and moist until reaching
the susceptible cells of the recipient.

Risks associated with "possibly safe"
and "unsafe" activities are only present
if one partner is infected.
Thus understanding your relative
risk of acquiring HIV from sex with
your old or new partner is based upon
two factors: one, the chance that your
partner is infected, and two, the ac
tivities you engage in with your
partner.
Estimating the chance that your
partner is infected is the more difficult
part of assessing your risk of acquiring
HIV, unless, of course, your partner
has recently tested negative for an
tibody to the virus and has been in a
monogamous relationship with you for
at least six months prior to the test.
Scientists and doctors like to discuss
this chance with statistics, but they
may not help you to feel that your
sexual partner may put you at risk.
Most of the statistics are estimates
based on who has AIDS, the long-term
consequence of HIV infection, and
smaller studies in various areas iden
tifying rates of infections. It may not
mean much to you that there are per
haps one to two million individuals
without symptoms, but who are infec
ted with the virus.
We don't yet have any good es
timates of the number of infected col
lege students, or infected Stanford
students, but we do have some other
statistics that may help quantify the
risks. A recent estimate by the Centers
for Disease Control states that approx
imately 30,000 Americans who are nei
ther members of high-risk groups nor

sexual partners of high-risk individuals
are infected with the virus. Thus even
"knowing your partner" does not guar
antee that your partner is uninfected.
This article will leave discussion of
the ways of avoiding infection —
abstinence and "safer sex" — to other
articles in this paper.
The bottom line, of course, is that
there is a small, but real, chance that
a college woman could catch HIV
through sex with someone she meets
on a college campus.
One additional factor to consider is
that the means of protecting yourself
against HIV can also help decrease
your chances of becoming infected
with many much more common, un
pleasant sexually transmitted diseases.
Diseases such as chlamydia, which can
cause infertility, are rampant on col
lege campus, infecting as many as one
in five sexually active college women.
Unlike AIDS, chlamydia infections
can be cured if they are detected, but
damage to the reproductive system
may occur in asymptomatic women.
The "safer sex" methods to prevent
transmission of HIV are very good at
preventing transmission of chlamydia,
and better than nothing at preventing
transmission of herpes and genital wart
viruses.
Unfortunately, in 1988, sex can have
serious health consequences. AIDS is
only the most frightening of them. It
is up to you, with the possible help
of peers, Cowell, brochures and family,
to develop a lifestyle with the level
of risk with which you are comfortable.

We don't yet have any good es
timates of the number of infected col
lege students, or infected Stanford
students, but we do have some other
statistics that may help quantify the
risks. A recent estimate by the Centers
for Disease Control states that approx
imately 30,000 Americans who are nei
ther members of high-risk groups nor

sexual partners of high-risk individuals
are infected with the virus. Thus even
"knowing your partner" does not guar
antee that your partner is uninfected.
This article will leave discussion of
the ways of avoiding infection —
abstinence and "safer sex" — to other
articles in this paper.
The bottom line, of course, is that
there is a small, but real, chance that
a college woman could catch HIV
through sex with someone she meets
on a college campus.
One additional factor to consider is
that the means of protecting yourself
against HIV can also help decrease
your chances of becoming infected
with many much more common, un
pleasant sexually transmitted diseases.
Diseases such as chlamydia, which can
cause infertility, are rampant on col
lege campus, infecting as many as one
in five sexually active college women.
Unlike AIDS, chlamydia infections
can be cured if they are detected, but
damage to the reproductive system
may occur in asymptomatic women.
The "safer sex" methods to prevent
transmission of HIV are very good at
preventing transmission of chlamydia,
and better than nothing at preventing
transmission of herpes and genital wart
viruses.
Unfortunately, in 1988, sex can have
serious health consequences. AIDS is
only the most frightening of them. It
is up to you, with the possible help
of peers, Cowell, brochures and family,
to develop a lifestyle with the level
of risk with which you are comfortable.
