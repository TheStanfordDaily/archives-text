# 10 tips for safer sex

1. Unlike men, all condoms are not created equal. Some are thicker, some
thinner, some stretchier, some more colorful, some tastier. Mosl condoms don't
deserve the "rubber raincoat" stereotype (though some definitely do).
2. Practice using condoms. If you're male, use them when you masturbate. Try
to break a condom, see what it takes to break one. if you're female, feel them,
fill them up with water or air, or practice putting them on assorted fruits and
vegetables like bananas and cucumbers.
3. Japanese condoms are great. As a whole, they tend to be thinner, more
colorful, better tasting, and better smelling than American brands. For those
worried about strength, remember that thickness is not directly proportional to
strength and that often what's more important than sheer strength is stretchiness.
4. Condoms come in two kinds, latex and "lambskin." Because lambskin condoms
(made from sheep intestines) have uneven surfaces, they are not recommended.
However, for those who like the slick feel of the lambskins, just double up.
Put on a latex condom and then a lambskin one over it.
5. Beginnings and endings are important. When you open a condom up, be
careful not to rip it. Push it to the side of the package first. Bemember to put
it on after the penis is hard. As you put it on, squeeze the air out of the tip
so semen has a place to go. After you've come, carefully remove the condom,
unroll it the rest of the way, and tie it up like a balloon.
6. Do not use oil-based lubricants like vaseline or oils on latex condoms. They'll
deteriorate. (Check it out for yourself, it's pretty gross.) Use water-based lubricants
instead. Some contain spermicides like Nonoxynol-9, which kills the HIV virus
on contact.
7. Bemember that not all lubricants are created equal, either. They also come
in a variety of tastes and textures. And, if you don't like the flavors currently
available, make some of your own. Try jam or jelly on condoms or anything
else that tastes good (as long as it isn't really oily, see #6 above).
8. The disadvantage of water-based lubricants is that they dry out faster than
oil-based ones. If you keep a plant mister handy (filled with lukewarm water,
not too hot or cold) or even a water gun, you can spritz the dried out water-based
lubricant and it will come right back to life.
9. For those with hangnail problems or cuts on fingers who don't like the idea
of full latex gloves, there are finger cots available that just cover an individual
finger.
10. A thin piece of latex as a barrier for rimming and cunninlingus is a great
idea. Unfortunately, "dental dams" are too thick for the job and quickly lead
to tongue fatigue. We recommend that getting a condom, cutting off the tip,
and slitting it up the side will result in a rectangular piece of latex that is
much thinner, much stretchier, and has much better feel than a dam, with no
tongue fatigue.
