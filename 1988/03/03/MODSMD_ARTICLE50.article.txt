# Risks to heterosexuals

### John Dorman, M.D. Director of Medicine at Cowell 
Given the current level of knowl
edge about AIDS, what are the risks
to the heterosexual population? The
following is a summary of important
points for the consideration of the het
erosexual population at Stanford.
• Those who are not sexually active
and do not use IV drugs do not seem
to be at any risk at present, since the
disease is not transmitted by casual
contact, and blood transfusions are no
longer a risk.
• There is no question that AIDS can
be transmitted by heterosexual inter
course. In Africa, there are as many
infected women as men. Many author
ities believe that, as with most sexually
transmitted diseases, transmission oc
curs less easily from women to men
than from men to women.
• Sexually active women may be more
likely to be infected than heterosexual
men, since the women may be infected
by bisexual men. Heterosexual men
would only be infected by
asymptomatic women who are either
IV drug abusers or have had contact

with IV drug abusers or bisexual men.
(Prostitutes are more likely to be in
this category.)
• Women who have a positive antibody
test for the virus should defer having
children until the significance of a
positive test is better understood. The
AIDS virus can be transmitted to a
fetus or a newborn from the mother.
• Quite obviously, the more partners
you have the more you place yourself
at risk. Also, having multiple partners
increases the risk of other infections
that can suppress the immune system.
Keep in mind that there is a long (six
months to eight years or more) incuba
tion period, so you really need to know
your potential partners sexual prac
tices over the past eight years.
• Truly "safe sex" can only be defined
as a mutually monogamous sexual re
lationship with someone you've known
for over eight years. Condoms and
spermicidal foams and jellies seem to
provide some protection, but it is not
100 percent certain.
• Anal intercourse seems to be the
highest risk practice, perhaps because
of tissue injury. Tissue injury allows
the virus to enter the blood stream
through tears in the rectal mucosa.
