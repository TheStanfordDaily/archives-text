# AIDS and a new sexual etiquette
## 
### Lou Shaw, R. N 
"Pick me up at 8 o'clock, and, oh,
by the way, bring a copy of your com
plete sexual history with you."
Let's face it, it's a little awkward to
ask your date for a complete resume
of his or her sexual history. Yet, in
this day and age, the consequences of
not using "safer sex" practices go
beyond the possibility of becoming
pregnant.
In the past, there were no rules to
the game; now there have to be. If
you have chosen to abstain from sex
and are not an IV drug user you need
have no fear — you are as safe as you
can be! If you choose to engage in
sex or are sexually active, the risks
are higher. What's called for today is
a little common sense and honesty
with your partner.
Before you engage in sexual activity,
you need to find out something about
your partner's history and current
knowledge of safer sex practices. In
theory, we imagine a traditional rela
tionship in which you know a person
for a long period of time — well
enough to have an open, honest dis
cussion about safer sex and sexual his
tory.
You're able to discuss this without
feeling awkward or worrying about the
consequences of the discussion upon
your relationship. In reality, however,
this is often not the case. You may
not have known the person long, or
even if you have, what do you say?

Perhaps, instead of "Excuse me dar
ling, your slip is showing," it's "Excuse
me darling, who have you been
showing your slip to?"
It's hard to break the ice, even with
someone with whom you're close.
You're afraid you'll offend your partner,
put him or her on the defensive and
totally ruin the moment. You need to
be aggressive in your exchange of in
formation about one another on an
intimate basis, yet you want to ease
the tension without losing the passion.
You want to try not to destroy the
intimacy of the moment, but you also
need to put your mind at ease so you
can enjoy sexual activity without wor
rying if the other person is giving you
a disease.
What can you do? Remember, you
can start the conversation. Be totally
honest with the person. Although, at
the moment, it may cool your jets, in
the long-run it will help you to relax
into a physical moment without sub
conscious worries about your partner's
past. If you're in a relationship, the
other person should respect your
honesty.
An example might be:
He: "Hey, maybe I should tell you
a few things about myself before we
go any further ... just to ease your
mind. I believe in birth control, I use
condoms when I have sexual relations
and I don't believe in sleeping
around."
Or she might say:
"I find you really attractive and I

want to be with you. I don't want to
get turned off, and I don't want to
turn you off. But would you mind if
I just asked you a few questions?"
Or, you might try using humor.
Making the other person laugh can
ease the tension of the discussion with
out ruining the moment.
She: "I'm a major stockholder in a
condom company. Are you using our
products?"
Or he:"I haven't had any diseases
lately, have you?"

Communicate! If you're honest and
you feel your partner is being evasive
you need to re-evaluate the situation.
Stop what you are doing. Re-examine.
Don't let the other person pressure
you into a situation in which you are
uncomfortable. Or be prepared to ac
cept the consequences.
The reality is that the threat of AIDS
is growing. A lot of people still are
not educated about AIDS. You're 50
percent of the relationship. You're 50
percent of the prevention, too.
