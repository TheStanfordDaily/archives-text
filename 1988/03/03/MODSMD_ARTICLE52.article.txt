# Student views conflict on AIDS
## 
### Louise Miller, M.P.H. Alcohol Drug Prevention Specialist 
Everyone is pretty scared, basically,
and people think about it in sort of a
detached way. They think of it on an
intellectual level. AIDS is important,
I rut it's not now. At Stanford, we're in
a sort of protective womb, and we don't
really need to worry about it, although
everyone has really strong feelings
about it People should use con
doms, but when it comes right down
to a personal level, it becomes a lot
less clear.

On Monday, February 8 two groups,
7 women and 6 men, met at Cowell
to discuss their feelings and percep
tions about AIDS. Most of the students
were freshmen; one was a graduate
student, and two of the men were
openly gay. Both groups were asked
the same four questions. A summary
of the discussions follows.
What do you think AIDS is and what
does it mean to Stanford students?
The men's group revealed a similar
sentiment to the one above expressed
by one of the members of the women's
group. One member stated: "As a
freshman, you don't really think about
it; you think it's something off, like in
San Francisco. It's not around here."
Another quipped, "You have to get a
date first before you can worry about
it!"
How personally susceptible do Stanford
students feel about becoming infected
with AIDS? Has sexual behavior
changed as a result?
The men's group discussed suscep
tibility in terms of sexual preference
and promiscuity. One member stated,
"If they're promiscuous, they're sus
ceptible; if they're not, they're not."
Another member countered, "I think
it's a matter of education.... Even
people who are promiscuous, but who
are educated about how to protect
themselves, are at much lower risk
than somebody who is not necessarily
promiscuous but who has one sexual
encounter but who doesn't know any

thing about how to be protected
against the virus."
One man said that he felt more
people use birth control out of fear of
pregnancy rather than fear of AIDS.
The women's group's discussion cen
tered on the feeling that people at
Stanford did not feel personally threat
ened by the disease. One student com
mented, "It will be something to worry
about in four years, when we're out
of school."
Another freshman agreed: "It sounds
cliched, but Stanford students lead too
sheltered lives, are too intelligent, too
responsible to get AIDS." One student
mentioned, however, that she had
never been in a sexual relationship
and that she had abstained longer than
she might have because of her fear of
AIDS.
Do you think Stanford students engage
in behaviors that put them at risk of
infection?
The women's group spoke only
about sexual intercourse and whether
or not people abstained or used protec
tion.
The men's conversation revealed the
opinion that the lack of information
on the definition of risky behaviors
could be attributed to a fear of talking
about the issue, that "society stig
matizes (discussion about risk be
haviors) to the point that we don't
have any information."
One student commented, "You hear
over and over that you should engage
in safer sex, but when you come right
down to it, what do they mean by
safer sex? What acts are safe? What
acts are unsafe? If they're going to
tell us to have safe sex, they should
tell us what safe sex is. Just leaving
it as 'safe sex' is like 'just say no.'
Have Stanford students' romantic re
lationships changed as a result of
AIDS?
The freshmen women said that more
people are using condoms, abstaining
from sex longer, having fewer one
night flings and are being
monogamous. One stated, "If I were
to have a fling, I wouldn't say I was
on the pill so he would have to use

a condom."
When asked about communicating
with a partner about AIDS, the group
agreed that the indirect approach was
most common: "You both know what
you're talking about when you use
condoms, although AIDS is not stated."
The men differed in their responses
to this question. A few said that rela
tionships had not changed since they
came to Stanford. One said, "When I
think about who I would sleep with
in the dorm, I don't consider AIDS.
The thought doesn't cross my mind.
I know it should, but it doesn't. If I
see some one I'm interested in
nowhere in the first 20 thoughts that

cross my mind is 'could this person
have AIDS?*"
Some of the men said that if they
heard rumors that a person were
bisexual or had had gay relationships,
it would change things. "Being ignor
ant of the situation of a homosexual
woman, I don't know how it is trans
mitted I could see that that would
be the first time I would ever think
seriously about it." (Reports of trans
mission between homosexual women
have been rare.)
Another man said that he would be
less likely to sleep with a woman who
had slept with several other men.

and people think about it in sort of a
detached way. They think of it on an
intellectual level. AIDS is important,
I rut it's not now. At Stanford, we're in

by one of the members of the women's
group. One member stated: "As a
freshman, you don't really think about
it; you think it's something off, like in
San Francisco. It's not around here."
Another quipped, "You have to get a
date first before you can worry about
it!"
How personally susceptible do Stanford
students feel about becoming infected
with AIDS? Has sexual behavior
changed as a result?
The men's group discussed suscep
tibility in terms of sexual preference
and promiscuity. One member stated,
"If they're promiscuous, they're sus
ceptible; if they're not, they're not."
Another member countered, "I think
it's a matter of education.... Even
people who are promiscuous, but who
are educated about how to protect
themselves, are at much lower risk
than somebody who is not necessarily
promiscuous but who has one sexual
encounter but who doesn't know any

thing about how to be protected
against the virus."
One man said that he felt more
people use birth control out of fear of
pregnancy rather than fear of AIDS.
The women's group's discussion cen
tered on the feeling that people at
Stanford did not feel personally threat
ened by the disease. One student com
mented, "It will be something to worry
about in four years, when we're out
of school."
Another freshman agreed: "It sounds
cliched, but Stanford students lead too
sheltered lives, are too intelligent, too
responsible to get AIDS." One student
mentioned, however, that she had
never been in a sexual relationship
and that she had abstained longer than
she might have because of her fear of
AIDS.
Do you think Stanford students engage
in behaviors that put them at risk of
infection?
The women's group spoke only
about sexual intercourse and whether
or not people abstained or used protec
tion.
The men's conversation revealed the
opinion that the lack of information
on the definition of risky behaviors
could be attributed to a fear of talking
about the issue, that "society stig
matizes (discussion about risk be
haviors) to the point that we don't
have any information."
One student commented, "You hear
over and over that you should engage
in safer sex, but when you come right
down to it, what do they mean by
safer sex? What acts are safe? What
acts are unsafe? If they're going to
tell us to have safe sex, they should
tell us what safe sex is. Just leaving
it as 'safe sex' is like 'just say no.'
Have Stanford students' romantic re
lationships changed as a result of
AIDS?
The freshmen women said that more
people are using condoms, abstaining
from sex longer, having fewer one
night flings and are being
monogamous. One stated, "If I were
to have a fling, I wouldn't say I was
on the pill so he would have to use

a condom."
When asked about communicating
with a partner about AIDS, the group
agreed that the indirect approach was
most common: "You both know what
you're talking about when you use
condoms, although AIDS is not stated."
The men differed in their responses
to this question. A few said that rela
tionships had not changed since they
came to Stanford. One said, "When I
think about who I would sleep with
in the dorm, I don't consider AIDS.
The thought doesn't cross my mind.
I know it should, but it doesn't. If I
see some one I'm interested in
nowhere in the first 20 thoughts that

cross my mind is 'could this person
have AIDS?*"
Some of the men said that if they
heard rumors that a person were
bisexual or had had gay relationships,
it would change things. "Being ignor
ant of the situation of a homosexual
woman, I don't know how it is trans
mitted I could see that that would
be the first time I would ever think
seriously about it." (Reports of trans
mission between homosexual women
have been rare.)
Another man said that he would be
less likely to sleep with a woman who
had slept with several other men.
Everyone is pretty scared, basically,
and people think about it in sort of a
detached way. They think of it on an
intellectual level. AIDS is important,
I rut it's not now. At Stanford, we're in
a sort of protective womb, and we don't
really need to worry about it, although
everyone has really strong feelings
about it People should use con
doms, but when it comes right down
to a personal level, it becomes a lot
less clear.
— Stanford woman
On Monday, February 8 two groups,
7 women and 6 men, met at Cowell
to discuss their feelings and percep
tions about AIDS. Most of the students
were freshmen; one was a graduate
student, and two of the men were
openly gay. Both groups were asked
the same four questions. A summary
of the discussions follows.
What do you think AIDS is and what
does it mean to Stanford students?
