# To test or not to test
## 
### John Dorman, M.D. Director of Medicine at Cowell 
The decision to be tested for the
AIDS antibody is not a simple one.
One can argue that students should
simply use "safer sex" practices if they
are sexually active, whether or not
their tests are positive. And since there
is no treatment, would you really want
to know if your test were positive?
How would it change your life? What
does a positive test really mean? You
are contagious, but will you get AIDS?
It is possible to obtain the test free
and anonymously at various clinics in
the area. The test at Cowell is free
and confidential, but not anonymous.
The doctor will write discreet infor
mation in your chart; you will sign a
permission form and receive a code
name. This code name is the only
identification that goes on the lab slip.
The report comes back to the doctor
directly, not to the lab, and it is stored
in a separate file, not in the medical
chart. If the test is positive, whether
performed here or elsewhere, it is im
portant for the student to inform all
medical caretakers in order to continue
to obtain good medical care.
In considering whether to be tested
for AIDS, students should consider
the following information:
• If testing is recommended for you
(see below: category I, and many in
category II), but you fear that you
would not be able to deal with a pos
itive test result, you have an obligation
either to abstain or to use safer sex
practices every time you have sex for
the indefinite future.
• There is a six- to 12-week lag period
between the time of exposure to the
virus and the development of a positive
test. A six-month wait is recommended
after a possible exposure before taking
the test, in order to assure a reliable
result. Of course, you should not risk

additional exposure during those six
months, nor should you expose others.
• The false positive (test is positive,
but you are not really infected) rate,
while very low, is not zero. And as
with all screening tests, the less likely
you are to have the condition for which
you are screening, the more likely it
is that any positive test that shows up
will be a false positive.
• If you have given blood recently,
your blood has already been tested for
the AIDS antibody. However, the
blood bank by law cannot tell you of
the test results for two months; the
blood bank does not wish to attract
at-risk blood donors who are coming
in to give blood merely to find out
whether they have a positive test.
Risk Catagories
Catagory I: Testing Recommended:
• Received blood transfusions between
1978 and 1985.
• Past or present history of intravenous
drug use.
• Males with a history of anal inter
course with more than one male
partner since 1977.
• History of vaginal or anal intercourse
since 1977 with individuals from any
of the above groups, or with those
from other high-risk groups such as
hemophiliacs or prostitutes.
Catagory II: Testing to be Consid
ered:
• Anyone with a sexual partner (vaginal
or anal intercourse) since 1977 who is
not in category 111.
Some considerations are:
Number of Partners: The more partners
you've had, the more likely you are
to be at risk, and the less likely you
are to know the past sexual history of
each partner.
Type of Protection: Those who use con-
