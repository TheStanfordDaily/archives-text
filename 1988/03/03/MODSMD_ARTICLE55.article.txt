# Getting involved: a student's story
## 
### Elizabeth Howton Director, Stanford AIDS Involvement Network 
When I used to think about the
question "How has AIDS affected my
life?" the answer seemed simple. I
was one of the lucky people who did
not have AIDS, had tested negative
for antibodies to the virus, and did
not know anyone who had been di
recdy affected. I was aware that I,
like every sexually active person these
days, needed to practice safer sex, but
the impact on my life seemed to end
there.
Over the past year, I have changed
my attitude toward AIDS. As the dire
projections for the spread of the dis
ease mount, it becomes increasingly
clear that AIDS is a problem that
society as a whole must confront —
not simply the medical profession, or
the gay community, or the govern
ment. AIDS is a problem that will
affect all of us sooner or later.
Last spring, I started thinking about
AIDS more seriously, partly because
of a biology class I took that explained
the facts of the disease and its social

context. I was particularly afraid that
some of my close friends might
develop AIDS, since many of them
are gay men who were sexually active
before the era of safer sex.
Beyond this fear, I felt that there
was not enough outreach from Stanford
students to people with AIDS, so at
the beginning of this school year, two
friends and I founded Stanford AIDS
Involvement Network, or SAIN, an
organization dedicated to trying to
match Stanford students with AIDS
volunteer opportunities.
The real turning point for me, how
ever, came when I saw the play "The
Normal Heart." I had been focusing
on the impact of AIDS on my life and
on what I could do on a day-to-day
basis to help, but the play made me
realize the enormity of the epidemic.
I was discouraged; I thought, "What
good is my little drop in the bucket
going to do?"
The play also demonstrated the huge
amount of fear we have about AIDS.
For many of my friends, the play
reminded them of the ongoing dilem
mas — should they be tested? Were
they at risk? When one of them came

to cry on my shoulder, I didn't know
what to say, and I tried to imagine
what I would say or do if someone I
knew tested positive or was diagnosed
with AIDS. I felt utterly overwhelmed
and helpless.
This experience made me even more
determined to be involved and to try
to help others. I simply could not sit
paralyzed with fear, worrying and
waiting for bad news to come. Last
month, I took an intensive seminar to
learn how to provide emotional sup
port for people with AIDS. The train
ing was offered by Aris, an AIDS
service center in San Jose, and took
over 45 hours — two entire weekends
during the height of midterms. But it
was well worth the time.
I made numerous new friends, some
of whom happen to have AIDS, among
the 50 or so people who went through
the training, but more importantly, I
developed some of the skills needed
to help people with AIDS and their
loved ones on a personal level.
I feel much more confident about
my ability to cope with AIDS, although
one of the most difficult lessons I
learned was that there are no easy

answers to the questions AIDS raises
— that I can't miraculously "make it
better," no matter how hard I try.
I was also amazed by the positive
attitudes of the people I have met
who have AIDS. They truly are people
who are living with AIDS, not dying
of it — they are not victims, but sur
vivors.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend
that everyone at Stanford take an in
tensive training, but I think the slogan
"AIDS: Fight the Fear with the Facts"
has a lot to say to people here. Too
often, people cling to blaming the vic
tims, an approach that can only be
counterproductive. I hope that more
Stanford students will get involved in
AIDS volunteer work, either through
projects like SAIN or the AIDS Ed
ucation Project, or through fund
raising events like those many groups
hold for many other worthy medical
causes.
If each person gives a little love
toward those who suffer from this dis
ease, it will help ease the crisis. AIDS
is a health problem, with powerful
social, cultural, economic and political
dimensions.

and helpless.
This experience made me even more
determined to be involved and to try
to help others. I simply could not sit
paralyzed with fear, worrying and
waiting for bad news to come. Last
month, I took an intensive seminar to
learn how to provide emotional sup
port for people with AIDS. The train
ing was offered by Aris, an AIDS
service center in San Jose, and took
over 45 hours — two entire weekends
during the height of midterms. But it
was well worth the time.
I made numerous new friends, some
of whom happen to have AIDS, among
the 50 or so people who went through
the training, but more importantly, I
developed some of the skills needed
to help people with AIDS and their
loved ones on a personal level.
I feel much more confident about
my ability to cope with AIDS, although
one of the most difficult lessons I
learned was that there are no easy

answers to the questions AIDS raises
— that I can't miraculously "make it
better," no matter how hard I try.
I was also amazed by the positive
attitudes of the people I have met
who have AIDS. They truly are people
who are living with AIDS, not dying
of it — they are not victims, but sur
vivors.
I wouldn't necessarily recommend
that everyone at Stanford take an in
tensive training, but I think the slogan
"AIDS: Fight the Fear with the Facts"
has a lot to say to people here. Too
often, people cling to blaming the vic
tims, an approach that can only be
counterproductive. I hope that more
Stanford students will get involved in
AIDS volunteer work, either through
projects like SAIN or the AIDS Ed
ucation Project, or through fund
raising events like those many groups
hold for many other worthy medical
causes.
If each person gives a little love
toward those who suffer from this dis
ease, it will help ease the crisis. AIDS
is a health problem, with powerful
social, cultural, economic and political
dimensions.
