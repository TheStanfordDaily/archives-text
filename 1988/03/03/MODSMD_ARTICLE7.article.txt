## Livermore lab head challenges GAO findings 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
A high-level SDI researcher who claimed
he was prevented from warning Reagan
administration officials about misinforma
tion they had received was "not muzzled,"
the director of Lawrence Livermore Na
tional Labratories said last weekend.
Director Roger Batzel refuted last week's
preliminary findings of an investigation of
charges made by Roy Woodruff, former
head of nuclear weapons research at Liver
more. Woodruff has said that he resigned
his post after Batzel prevented him from
setting straight the overly optimistic claims
made by Senior Hoover Fellow Edward
Teller. Teller is a consultant at Livermore
about X-ray laser research, a key compo
nent of SDI.
Batzel strongly defended his position,
saying Woodruff was not prevented from
"expressing his technical views about the
X-ray laser to senior people in govern
ment."
The investigation's findings were sum
marized Friday by Rep. George Brown, D-
Riverside, who in December asked the Gen
eral Accounting Office to scrutinize
Woodruffs charges. The GAO briefed
Brown the previous day on its confidential
findings.
Brown stated that the investigation es
tablished that Teller had misled high-level
government officials concerning nuclear
pumped X-ray laser research, and that Bat

zel had kept Woodruff from sending "cor
recting letters" to the officials.
According to Brown, this correspondence
"would have provided a more balanced and
realistic view of the X-ray laser research
program," which has been a focus of debate
among scientists and politicians for several
years. Research on the laser began years
before Reagan called for SDI.
Physicists at Livermore have accused
Teller, and fellow Livermore scientist
Lowell Wood, of over-selling the X-ray laser
to important members of the administra
tion — including Reagan himself — in
order to extract huge amounts of funding
for the program.
Batzel argued that "Woodruff was able
to inform each person whom Teller wrote"
about his concerns, saying that lab records
used in the GAO investigation document
"hundreds of separate interactions between
Woodruff and senior people in government
between 1981 and 1985," although not all
of the discussion concerned X-ray laser re
search.
Woodruff, however, contested Batzel's
definition of senior officials in Wednesday's
San Jose Mercury News: "Of course I saw
those people (lower-level officials) ... But
there were three people I didn't see: Ronald
Reagan, (former national security adviser)
Robert McFarlane and (former CIA Direc
tor) William Casey. To have them be the
people that were getting only one part of
the story ... struck me as not OK."
