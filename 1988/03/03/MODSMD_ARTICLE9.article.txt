# Dry Rush rejected — again
## 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council last night resisted
a final attempt to institute a dry Rush, voting
down a proposal to extend the dry period of Rush.
The IFC's 17-7 vote against the proposal —
which would have prohibited the serving of al
cohol Monday through Thursday during the first
and third weeks of Rush — is probably the final
action it will take on Rush policy this year. Rush
begins April 4.
The IFC also addressed existing Rush
guidelines and interaction with ethnic minority
and gay and lesbian groups on campus.
Forty fraternity members debated the issue of
wet Rush for more than 20 minutes before the
proposal, written by the IFC Rush Committee,
was defeated.
IFC President Vinny Frost opened discussion
by saying, "We have previously decided that al
cohol does not affect the decision-making process.
I still strongly agree with that."
But IFC Vice President and Rush Committee
Chair Stuart Levy disagreed. "I'm not sure how
much a dry Rush will hurt us, but it will definitely
help us a great deal," he said.
Other representatives argued about liability
issues, the popular attraction of alcohol, and the
need for sober decision-making.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano closed
debate by saying he believed the proposal for a
dry Rush "is in the best interest of the fraternal
system as a whole. . . . The arguments for a wet
Rush do not measure up to those for a dry one."

The proposal's contentions for a partially dry
Rush included the cost of alcohol, legal liability
and the fact that less effort would be needed to
regulate alcohol policies. The Rush committee
also noted the Alumni Interfraternity Council's
recommendation for a dry Rush.
"I can't say I'm surprised," Pisano said, in
reference to the outcome. Levy agreed, saying
the vote "is not surprising, although I wish it
would've passed."
Frost refuted claims that the IFC has been
stubborn regarding the issue. "It's unfortunate
that our decision will perpetuate some
stereotypes, but collectively we feel very strongly
that the overall environment has fostered good
decisions," Frost said. "The fraternities are con
fident they can manage the risks well."
Rush policy states that fraternities may serve
only beer and wine during the first week of Rush,
no alcohol the second week, and any alcoholic
beverage the third.
Frost made it clear that all Rush policies will
be strictly enforced. "We're going to hit you hard
if you screw up," he told IFC representatives.
Frost said he was especially concerned with
the traditional problem of students returning to
their dorms and causing disruptions during Rush.
He suggested the IFC consider closing all parties
at 11 p.m., but the motion did not carry.
Also discussed last night were fraternities' con
tinuing efforts to interact with campus ethnic
minority and gay and lesbian groups. Two fra
ternities have been visited by the Gay and Lesbian
Speakers Bureau and three more have scheduled
similar presentations.
