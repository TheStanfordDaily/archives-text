[~ "PROVE IT!" 1
That was always the response to grade school friends who said or
claimed unbelievable things. Rememoer? You might still be asking for
| proof on bigger topics — like how to deal with grief over a friend's death, or
where to find a more permanent source of happiness and fulfillment. Even
how to be healed of a sickness. And asking for proof—for a solution —is a
reasonable request.
A magazine called the Christian Science Sentinel has articles and testi
monies of healing that explain how an intelligent understanding of God
solves problems and permanently heals sickness. "Prove it," you say? The
proof is there, page after page.
