# Navy commander wants battleship in S.F. Bay
## 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
Rear Admiral Robert Toney, commander
of the Naval Base in San Francisco, told
students in Branner Hall last night that
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos is wrong
to refuse the Navy permission to station
the UJ3.S. Missouri battleship in San Fran
ciso.
Although former San Francisco Mayor
Diane Feinstein offered the Navy the op
portunity to use the Hunter's Point port,
her term ran out before she concluded a
final deal. The proposal still has the sup
port of many Bay Area congressmen.
Agnos, on the other hand, made his op
position of the battleship a major issue in
his run for mayor last fall.
By doing so, Agnos effectively tied his
hands politically and would find it difficult
to change his mind even if support grew
for the battleship, according to Toney.
"He's dug a big hole for himself. He
doesn't want to appear inconsistent by
reversing his stand on such an important
issue," he said.
However, Toney said he believes Agnos
might reconsider if the Navy met certain
conditions. According to Toney, Agnos is
concerned about the Navy's employment
practices toward gays and lesbians, as well
as the possible environmental hazards of

a stationed ship, such as sandblasting.
Yet, Toney argued that "the Navy's
policies are actually quite liberal. I'll stack
them up against anybody." The Navy just
wants the "opportunity" to use the port,
and will take responsibility for "cleaning
up messes."
Top Navy leadership in Washington is
currently negotiating with the mayor and
city officials to make an arrangement, he
said, adding that he is "hopeful" something
can be worked out.
Toney argued that the U.S.S. Missouri
would be a great boost to the Bay Area's
economy, especially to the Hunter's Point
district, which currently has a 21 percent
unemployment rate.
"This deal would bring in 55 ships, 1,100
men and $110 million in additional salaries.
When you figure in about $90 million for
repairs, you're talking about a lot of jobs
— blue collar jobs," he said.
Toney said he feels that San Francisco's
refusal to bring in the battleship sends a
"bad signal" to other countries, particularly
those of the Pacific Rim.
"The Navy has one purpose: to support
the foreign policy of the president. Our job
is to guarantee the freedom of the seas.
San Francisco is sending the signal to the
rest of the world that we are losing the
will to defend ourselves."
