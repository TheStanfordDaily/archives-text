# Reforesting the Foothills
## Volunteers to plant 200 oaks Saturday 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
In an effort to stabilize the live oak
population in the Stanford Foothills, a
group of volunteers will plant about 200
trees on Saturday, California Arbor Day.
Magic, Inc., an environmental firm
contracted by the University, is organ
izing the one-day planting in the Stan
ford Academic Reserve, a 1,000-acre plot
of land between Junipero Serra
Boulevard and Interstate 280.
In addition to the planting, David
Schlom, a founder of Magic, will start
work on an irrigation system for the
oaks. The water system, drawing water
from Lake Felt and Lake Searsville —
two lakes on Stanford property — will
run to each tree.
He added that the irrigation system,
funded by the Stanford Planning Office,
needs to be completed within two weeks
or the newly planted trees may die.
Schlom said there is no single problem
in the Foothills that warrants the
replanting. "Like any question of cause
raised in an ecological context, there is
no easy answer," he said.
Some of the problems Schlom cited
were cattle grazing, changes in the air

quality, pumping groundwater from the
area, and movement of mammalian
predators like fox and coyote to more
wooded areas.
He went on to say the rural land is
a unique resource and "pressure on it
is heavy" due to development of lands
bordering the Foothills, such as the site
of SLAC.
The need to stabilize oak tree growth
in the Academic Reserve was addressed
formally in 1983 with the Vegetation
Management Plan. Drafted by the Uni
versity Planning Office, the plan calls
for such actions as planting acorn and
oak seeds and lessening the number of
cattle from the Foothill area.
Schlom said Magic, which is under
contract with the Planning Office, works
to implement the recommendations of
the plan.
Magic's involvement with the Foot
hills includes monitoring the growth
rate of trees and developing an appro
priate period of time for cattle to graze
without harming vegetation.
Schlom said it is important to preserve
oaks because of their benefit to humans.
While the trees' most practical use is
for firewood, Schlom said he thought
the leaves may some day be used for
medical advancement.
