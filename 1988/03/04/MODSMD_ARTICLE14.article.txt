NATO agrees to upgrade nukes
BRUSSELS, Belgium — The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization yesterday submerged a
simmering controversy over modernizing its
nuclear weapons and concluded a summit con
ference that President Reagan said demon
strated the alliance's commitment "to move
forward to meet our defense requirements"
even as it sought to improve relations with
the Soviet Union.
The 16 leaders of the NATO nations agreed
that the Western arsenal must include a mix
of "effective nuclear and conventional forces
which will continue to be kept up to date
where necessary."
But their statement set no date for the
modernization, which is intended to improve
the range and accuracy of the alliance's aging
short-range nuclear weapons.
Reagan, in a statement he read to reporters
at NATO headquarters before heading home
to Washington, said that he promised the allies
that the United States would not trade away
"the credibility of our deterrent ... at the
negotiating table, and we won't give it away
through neglect."
"The most direct threat to our security and
to stability in Europe lies in the Soviet Union's
massive military presence," Reagan said. "The
alliance has given its needs a lot of thought,
knows what it wants to do and has programs
that it has committed to carry out."
U.S. move hurts Panama banks
PANAMA CITY — U.S. moves to increase
financial pressure on the regime of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega contributed to a run
on banks here yesterday and prompted
Panama's central bank to stop delivering cash
to private banks.
Private Panamanian banks decided not to
open today because they lacked the cash to
handle an expected surge of withdrawals,
banking sources said. The few banks that
opened yesterday — the fourth day of a general
strike called by Noriega opponents — had to
limit withdrawals per customer as Panamani
ans formed long lines in front of the few tellers
who showed up for work.
The strike appeared to ease somewhat by
afternoon, with some shops re-opening. Riot
troops known as "Dobermans" guarded against
new attempts by youths to set up burning
street barricades.
The Panama Canal operated normally yes
terday, despite opposition efforts to drum up
some strike activity, Panama Canal Commis
sion Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said. He
said there were no new bomb threats yester
day, after five that were called in anonymously
on Wednesday. No bombs were found.
Bankers attributed the run in part to the
uncertainty caused by the announcement in
the United States on Wednesday of moves to
block the Noriega government's access to
about $50 million held in U.S. banks and to
place revenue from the Panama Canal in
escrow.
Kabul agrees on Soviet pullout
GENEVA — Afghan negotiators announced
yesterday a plan for accelerated withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan, a development
that removes one of the last obstacles to agree
ment on restoring peace in the war-torn
country.
Abdul Wakil, the foreign minister of Mos
cow's client regime in Kabul, the Afghan cap
ital, disclosed that the proposed timetable for
the Soviet pullout had been shortened from
10 months to nine and that half of the esti
mated 115,000 troops would leave in the first
three months.
The United States and Pakistan, where the
mtyor Afghan resistance groups are based, had
pressed for a "front-loaded" pullout, with most
of the troops leaving early in the withdrawal
period.
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in a state
ment issued last month, had accepted the prin
ciple of a front-loaded pullout, but formal
proposals had not been submitted in the
Geneva talks until yesterday.
Announcement of the new timetable
heightens the prospects for agreement on a
settlement that would commit Moscow for the
first time to withdrawing military support
from a Marxist government.
