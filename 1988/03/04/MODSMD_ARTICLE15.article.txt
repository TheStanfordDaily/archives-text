# House defeats non-military Contra aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — In a stunning
turnaround, the House defeated a $30
million non-military aid package for
Nicaragua's rebels yesterday, dealing
a major setback to the House Demo
cratic leadership and leaving Congress
in disarray on the volatile issue.
On a 216-208 vote, House members
from both parties rejected a
Democratic-sponsored plan that would
have provided food, medicine and
clothing to the rebels, known as Con
tras, as well as medical aid to children
who have been injured in the
Nicaraguan civil war.
The vote was a surprise because the
House, on a procedural ballot only
minutes before, had endorsed the
Democratic plan. When the final de
cision was made, however, several
liberals and conservatives switched
their original votes, guaranteeing
defeat of the aid proposal.
As a result, the Contra aid issue is
momentarily dead in Congress, while
both sides regroup. A Republican al
ternative that would have provided
some military aid for the rebels was
killed on the procedural vote. In the
aftermath, Democrats and Republi
cans blamed each other for the rejec
tion of the plan and tried to make the

most of a confusing political situation.
"This vote leaves the Contras ...
without any meaningful help," said
Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who
led the fight against the Democratic
plan. "Right now, I'd say the pressure
is on the Speaker of the House to
come up with a new plan that will
actually be acceptable to most of the
members. The ball is in their court."
Democrats strongly disagreed,
saying that they had honored a com
mitment to bring a non-military aid
package to the House for a vote and
that future initiatives to help the Con
tras would have to come from the
Senate or the White House.
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-
Texas, said that decision was a
"Pyrrhic victory" for Republicans be
cause now there is no legislation pend
ing in Congress to aid the rebels.
"Maybe they (Republicans) are only
interested in a military solution," he
said.
President Reagan reacted with dis
may to the setback for Contra aid and
called on Congress to develop an as
sistance package "of sufficient quan
tity to sustain the Nicaraguan freedom
fighters. If not, the prospects for peace
and democracy inside Nicaragua will

diminish quickly," he said in a state
ment released by the White House.
Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the
House majority whip, added that Dem
ocrats had "made it clear to the Re
publicans that we would need their
support to help pass this package.
"We knew that, on the final vote,
we would lose some Democrats and
that the Republicans would have to
provide some support to us to make
up the difference. For whatever
reasons, they chose not to. So now
there is nothing pending. There is
nothing on the table."
Earlier in the day, House Demo
cratic leaders were confident that their
plan would be approved, predicting a
victory margin of at least 10 votes.
They also said that the House would
reject a rival Republican package call
ing for $36 million in non-lethal aid
to the rebels.
Privately, however, Coelho and
other strategists knew that they could
not count on the support of several
liberals who oppose Contra aid and
were nervous about endorsing this pro
posal.
The problem surfaced last month,
when the House narrowly defeated a
Reagan administration request for

Contra aid that included $3.6 million
in military assistance. House Speaker
Wright won the support of about 40
wavering moderates when he promised
that they would be able to vote on a
humanitarian aid package offering no
weapons within several weeks.
But liberals were never comfortable
with the idea, and party leaders spent
much of the last week trying to win
their votes. Although they helped ap
prove the Democratic plan on a
procedural ballot — which effectively
killed the rival, Republican proposal
— they switched their votes minutes
later. A.
"This was a very tough vote for a%
lot of Democratic liberals," said Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., a Contra aid
opponent who reluctantly voted for the
aid package both times. "They were
under a great deal of pressure this
week."
If the vote was a setback for Dem
ocrats, it may have been a Pyrrhic
victory for Republicans. All U.S. aid
to the Contras expired Feb. 29, and
Edwards conceded that it may be a
while before the rebels receive any
more assistance in their battle against
Nicaragua's Sandinista rulers.
