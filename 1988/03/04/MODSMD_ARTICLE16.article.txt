# New protest reported in Soviet Azerbaijan
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Ethnic upheaval
spread from riot-torn Sumgait to
another city in the Soviet
Republic of Azerbaijan, a Soviet
official said here yesterday. For
the fourth time in less than two
weeks special militia were called
in to quell the disturbances.
Residents demonstrated in
Kirovabad — Azerbaijan's second
largest city — amid rumors about
ethnic protests in a disputed area
30 miles away, the official said.
The demonstrations, now re
portedly under control, mark the
fourth outbreak in the Caucausus
region in the past two weeks. In
addition to Sumgait, a port on
the Caspian Sea, protests have
disturbed Yerevan, the capital of
the neighboring Soviet Armenian
Republic, and the district of
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Ar
menian enclave within Azer
baijan.
The situation in each of those
areas is now under control,
Foreign Ministry press represen
tative Gennady Gerasimov told
reporters yesterday. He said a
candidate member of the ruling
Politburo has been sent to the
scene of bloody riots on Sunday
and a commission has been set
up to investigate the violence.
Last Friday, Kremlin leader
Mikhail Gorbachev told two Ar
menian writers that he was
reviewing the causes of the dis
putes. Armenian nationalists who
started the protests are waiting

for his response.
In Sumgait, located near the
Azerbaijani capital, Baku, a cur
few policed by Soviet troops and
Army personnel carriers was ex
pected to be raised yesterday, a
local official told reporters.
In Nagorno-Karabakh, an offi
cial ultimatum to suspend three
weeks of street protests has been
heeded, dissident sources in
Yerevan said. Ethnic Armenians
there have demanded that
Nagorno-Karabakh be joined to
Armenia.
In Yerevan, where hundreds of
thousands demonstrated in sup
port of Armenians in Nagorno-
Karabakh, Armenian sources
reached by telephone said work
has returned to a normal pace.
At a news briefing yesterday,
Gerasimov gave some details
about the disturbances, in which
up to 17 reportedly were killed.
The riots and deaths make it the
biggest ethnic clash in decades in
the Soviet Union.
Gerasimov said that Pyotr
Demichev, a candidate member of
the ruling Politburo, and Azer
baijan Communist Party boss
Kyamran Bagirov had met with
residents in Sumgait. Demichev,
a Kremlin trouble-shooter on eth
nic issues, mediated with Crimean
Tatars who demonstrated for the
return of their homeland on the
Black Sea last summer.
