# Rebels reject Ortega plans

### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua â€” Nicaraguan
rebel leaders yesterday rejected Presi
dent Daniel Ortega's dismissal of Car
dinal Miguel Obando y Bravo as
mediator in a cease-fire negotiation, con
senting to a top-level meeting with San
dinista officials only if Obando par
ticipates as "moderator and observer."
The five directors of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the alliance of the rebels
known as contras, announced in Miami
that Adolfo Calero, one of their mem
bers, would represent them at the talks,
which Ortega proposed for March 9-11
in the southern Nicaraguan border town
of Sapoa.
The Contras also insisted that the
discussions should be based on a pro
posal that Obando presented during the
last round of cease-fire talks, held in
mid-February in Guatemala City. The
cardinal's proposal was accepted "in
principle" by both sides, but since then
the Sandinista governmLiit has backed
away from it. ! ;
Contra leader Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro said that in three telephone
conversations starting Wednesday night
with Nicaraguan Resistance directors,
the cardinal said he could continue in
the discussions only if both sides agreed.
"The exclusion of the cardinal at this
stage is completely unacceptable to us,"
Chamorro said. "He is the only witness
who is trusted by all the Nicaraguan
people."
"If the talks were stalled with the
cardinal present, in his absence they're
headed for certain failure," said
Mauricio Diaz, head of the left-of-center
Popular Social Christian Party and
member with Obando of the four
member National Reconcilation Com

mission named by Ortega to monitor
the progress of the peace accords.
"Firing the cardinal is a sign that the
Sandinista Front is going to make things
very hard inside Nicaragua," said Carlos
Salgado, general secretary of a left-wing
trade union confederation.
A meeting of leftist and moderate op
position unions, including Salgado's, was
disrupted yesterday morning by about
150 Sandinistas carrying pistols and
metal bars. Shouting and shoving, they
stormed into a union headquarters,
slashed posters and stole two megap
hones as Sandinista police looked on.
Ortega, with his unexpected proposal,
named his defense minister and brother,
Gen. Humberto Ortega, to head a del
egation that also includes the Army's
second highest officer, Chief of Staff
Gen. Joaquin Cuadra.
The government announced yesterday
that Lenin Cerna, the much-feared head
of the' State Security police, also will
participate.
By putting the talks in the hands of
the military, Ortega was giving clear
notice that the Sandinistas' agenda will
be limited to technical aspects of a cease
fire-such as choosing of zones and ob
servers and deciding how the contras
would be supplied with food and
medicines during the truce.
In a letter that Ortega hand-delivered
to Obando Wednesday night, the presi
dent recalled that the five Central Amer
ican presidents, in their January summit
in Costa Rica, affirmed that any cease
fire talks under their regional peace plan
should be "separate from a political
dialogue to be conducted with the un
armed political opposition parties."
