# Shultz plan hangs on Jordan representing Arabs
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State
George Shultz, reaffirming U.S. deter
mination to avoid all contact with the
Palestine Liberation Organization,
said yesterday that it was vital to his
Middle East peace initiative to per
suade West Bank and Gaza Strip Arabs
to accept Jordan as their negotiator.
Following a 90-minute meeting in
London with Jordan's King Hussein,
Shultz said the only workable way of
bringing Palestinians into peace talks
was to include them in a Jordanian
delegation.
"Jordan with Palestinians is a good
concept because, after all, Jordan has
a border with Israel and there are
Palestinians in Jordan — East Bank
ers, West Bankers, same families, lots
of ties," he said.
"There is a lot to be said for this
approach," Shultz added. "I think it
is a good one."

However, Jordan and all other Arab
states officially recognize the PLO as
the only legitimate representative of
the Palestinians. The PLO has said
that it wants to have a separate del
egation at any future peace conference,
and a source familiar with the thinking
at the highest levels of the Jordanian
government said this week that if the
PLO can obtain its own place at the
table, Hussein would not stand in its
way.
Hussein and PLO leader Yasser
Arafat agreed on a joint peace strategy
three years ago, but the plan broke
down about a year later.
Reminded that most Palestinian res
idents of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip say they recog
nize the PLO and not Jordan as their
representative, Shultz said: "The Pal
estinian people can express themselves
(in a Jordanian delegation). I think

we have to convince them that that
is the case."
Although Shultz has said repeatedly
that he is seeking a "comprehensive"
peace settlement between Israel and
all of its Arab adversaries, the primary
focus of his effort is on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip territories, which have
been occupied by Israel since the 1967
Arab-Israeli War.
"Everybody believes and recognizes
and advocates that the Palestinians
. . . have to have a say because, to a
very considerable degree, it is their
rights and their human condition that
is involved," Shultz said.
"We have to construct something
that people see is workable and
legitimate," he said. "Having a gov
ernment involved is important."
Shultz reiterated U.S. policy against
any sort of relationship with the PLO
unless that organization accepts U.N.

Security Council Resolutions 242 and
338, recognizes Israel's right to exist
and renounces terrorism. He said it
should be "simple enough" for the
PLO to meet those conditions.
Israel, for its part, refuses to recog
nize the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization.
Palestinian representation probably
is the most sensitive issue Shultz will
have to face in his current effort to
revitalize the dormant Middle East
peace process. It goes to the heart of
the competing aspirations of Israelis
and Palestinians, both of which want
the same narrow strip of land.
"There are aspirations that people
have that are not compatible with each
other and are not realistic," Shultz
said. "What you try to do is get people
to focus on dreams that have a foun
dation in reality."
