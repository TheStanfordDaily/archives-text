# Stanford wins Davies suit
## Ex-visiting prof.'s discrimination charges fall short 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
The University prevailed Wednesday
in a $9 million lawsuit filed against it
by former Visiting Prof. Norman
Davies, who alleged that his controver
sial views of the Jewish people caused
the History Department to deny him a
tenured professorship in 1986.
Davies, a British historian of Poland,
charged that the University discrimi
nated against him because of his polit
ical views — instead of making a "fair
and impartial" evaluation of his schol
arship — when it denied him an en
dowed chair in Eastern European his
tory.
In particular, Davies argued that his
tory faculty members felt he was "in
sensitive to people of the Jewish faith"
and "unacceptably defensive" of the Po
lish people during the German occupa
tion of Poland during World War 11.
But Santa Clara County Superior
Court Judge James Stewart ruled that
it was "abundantly clear" that Davies
"was judged on his scholarship."

Moreover, the court affirmed Stan
ford's right to evaluate Davies' opinions
before hiring him, stating that "when
the opinions expressed are part of a
history professor's view of historical
events, surely he can be fairly judged
on the merits of his views."
University President Donald Kennedy
said he is "extremely pleased at this
strong vindication of the University's
appointment process."
Davies, a full professor at the Uni
versity of London, accepted a 1985-86
visiting professorship at Stanford and
applied for tenure here but was denied
by a 12-11 vote of the History Depart
ment faculty in January, 1986.
In a letter defending the history fac
ulty's denial of tenure to Davies, Uni
versity Provost James Rosse wrote: "A
number of the faculty believe that
'God's Playground' (a book by Davies
on Polish history) is insufficiently ana
lytical and tends to substitute rhetoric
and irony for clear historical analysis
and explanation."
In May 1986 Davies filed suit against
not only Stanford but also individual

historians who, he argued, had defamed
him — including Stanford Profs. Harold
Kahn, Paul Robinson and Alexander
Dallin.
The court dismissed Davies' original
suit, but he twice amended his claims
so that the discrimination charges were
made only against the University.
Davies' complained that throughout
the fall quarter of 1985 no member of
the History Department attended his
lectures or "made any other effort" to
seriously evaluate his scholarship.
But the court said Stanford made
"substantial efforts" to evaluate his
works and review other scholars'
opinions of Davies.
In addition, the court ruled that the
University did not deny Davies' "aca
demic freedom" to express opinions un
der the Statement on Academic Free
dom in the Faculty Handbook, although
the court found it "curious that Stan
ford feels that these very basic protec
tions against arbitrary and capricious
treatment are not and should not be
extended to visiting professors."
However, University Staff
Counsel Iris Brest said Stanford
does extend protections to visiting
professors.
What does not apply to visiting
professors, she said, are the pro
cedures for grieving complaints
about academic freedom. The pro
cedures only apply to tenured and
non-tenured faculty.
"Internal procedures cannot ap

ply to those who are not internal
people," Brest said.
"I haven't heard of any other
schools ... that afford these for
mal procedures (beyond) faculty,"
she added.
Calling the court's feelings
about Stanford's academic free
dom policy "a significant misun
derstanding," Rosse told The
Daily yesterday that "no condi
tions of [Davies'] being a visiting
professor were violated."
Rosse added that it is not
Davies' "status as a visitor that
is at issue, but his status as a job
applicant."

In addition to political discrim
ination, Davies claimed "negligent
misrepresentation" in the Univer
sity's visiting professorship offer
two years ago.
He said three letters written by
History Prof. James Sheehan in
1984 and 1985 misled him to be
lieve that his appointment was
imminent.
But Judge Stewart noted that
Sheehan had said no commitment
could be made to hire Davies until
"we had all had the opportunity
to get to know each other better,"
and the court stated that Stanford
made "substantial efforts" to do

so.
Calling the Superior Court de
cision "scholarly" and "closely
reasoned," Brest said the Davies
case is "curious" because "nobody
ever thought differently" about
such situations.
"If you consider yourself a (his
torian), your views are up for con
sideration," she said.
Brest said Davies would have a
legitimate discrimination claim if
he had been denied professorship
on the basis of his political views
in a department that does not
deal principally with history or
politics.
