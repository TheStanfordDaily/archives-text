## Create a hangout 
### 
A GAPING HOLE currently
exists in social life on
campus: There is no place
for Stanford students to eat or so
cialize late at night.
When midnight rolls around,
The Store closes its doors. At the
Corner Pocket, the pizza is long
gone, and the Coffee House is hur
rying the last holdouts through the
door. What is needed is an exten
sion and expansion of on-campus
eateries to make up for the lack
of a college town in Palo Alto.
Although there are places off
campus to hang out, most present
one problem or another. To get to
Denny's or Lyon's, a car is neces
• sary. And although the University
Creamery is relatively close in com
parison, who wants to bike 15-
minutes round trip to relax and
unwind?
As a result, students are left no
other choice but to go back to the
dorms. Typically, this means other
students will be roused from bed
or distracted from studies.
In years past, any late-night
break could take place in the dorm
library or lounge. But this year,
Roble refugees are housed in many
of these areas. This new residence
situation rules out any pizza, ping
pong, piano or Letterman.
Students searching high and low
for a late-night social spot is inex
cusable at Stanford. Tresidder Un
ion is granted a monopoly on
campus, and, as a result, it pro
vides only adequate services. It
should expand its services to live
up to its role as a complete student
union.
During Dead Week and Finals
Week Tresidder traditionally offers
* late-night study lounges. But these
services are necessary during the
rest of each quarter as well.
There are several services Tres
idder should consider offering: a
short order grill, a pizza parlor,
TV rooms, lounges, and a health

food snack shop.
It should be obvious to Tresidder
management and the University
administration that Stanford is in
Palo Alto, and that Palo Alto is
hardly New Haven, Cambridge or
Berkeley when it comes to night
life.
This absence of a "college town,"
when added to the transportation
problems arising out of the size of
the Stanford campus, makes a full
service, late-night student union
imperative.
Tresidder management has con
sidered these suggestions before
and is looking for ways to increase
its services now. But after several
years of seeking to improve its
image as a student union, little
has been accomplished.
When The Store experimented
with extending hours to 1 a.m.,
there was very little demand
shown. Also, management fre
quently cites the lack of student
employees as the reason for not
extending hours.
The Store experiment shows
that Tresidder is slowly catching
on, but has not done enough. Quite
obviously, a student with the late
night munchies will not travel to
The Store and then back home to
snack.
Marriott-Saga Corp., which sup
plies food services at Tresidder,
should make more of an effort to
staff the Corner Pocket and all
other Tresidder food facilities with
the students' needs as its primary
consideration.
Tresidder services are important
factors in the quality of student
life at Stanford. Both the Univer
sity and Tresidder must recognize
the roles they should play to com
pensate for Stanford's lack of on
campus night life. The student
demand is there. What is needed
now is proof of University and
Tresidder commitment in meeting
the demand.
