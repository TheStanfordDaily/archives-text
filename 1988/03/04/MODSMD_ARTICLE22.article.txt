## Robertson wimped out 
### 
WITH THE EXCEPTION of his
second-place finish in lowa,
events of late have not been kind
to the former Rev. Marion G. "Pat" Rob
ertson.
First he got caught fudging his mar
riage date. Then he had a vision — a
blurred one, at best — of nuclear missiles
in Cuba (or was it Aruba?). Next, he
accused George Bush of bringing down
televangelist Jimmy "Sticky Fingers"
Swaggart just to hurt him (Pat, that is)
politically. And now this.
Three days ago Robertson announced
he'd be dropping his $35 million libel
suit against local attorney and former
congressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
citing the inconvenience of the trial date:
March 8, Super Tuesday.
Pat threw in the towel. Avoided com
bat. Wimped out. And not for the first
time, either.
Why the libel suit? McCloskey claimed
in an Aug. 4, 1986 letter widely distrib
uted in political circles that, when both
he and Pat were aboard the USS Breck
inridge bound for the Korean front lines
in February 1951, Lt. Robertson, then
20, used the clout of his father, a U.S.
senator, to escape combat.
While en route, their ship docked
briefly at the port of Kobe, Japan. Mc-
Closkey recalled that, during the
stopover, Robertson made two anxious
phone calls. And when the ship again set
off for Korea, Pat was allowed to stay
behind.
Why? "My single distinct memory,"
stated McCloskey, "is of Pat with a big
grin on his face, standing on the dock
at Kobe after his second phone call,
saying something like, 'So long you guys
— good luck,' and telling us that his

father had gotten him out of combat
duty." Robertson labeled the letter "lies"
and promptly sued.
Pete McCloskey went on to lead a rifle
platoon and earn the Navy Cross, the
Silver Star and a Purple Heart. Robert
son reportedly stayed behind in Japan
for four months, and when he was finally
ordered to Korea, he landed a cushy desk
job as the Division HQ "liquor officer."
"Robertson's major duty was appar
ently to fly to Japan once a week and
bring back booze for the officers' mess,"
asserted McCloskey. But did Pat ever
serve as a "combat officer," as his political
pamphlets boast?
McCloskey answered that Division HQ
was barely even within earshot of friendly
artillery. Hmph — some combat. The
Bush-Rather spat last month was more
warlike than that.
Now, in 1988, Robertson insists he's
only dropping the suit because of its "un
fair" trial date. Translation: Federal
Judge Joyce Green refused to give Rob
ertson special handling by bumping the
trial back to late March. I call that
scrupulous fairness, not unfairness.
Pat and his army of lawyers knew all
along that the trial stage of the libel suit
might well interfere with his presidential
campaign. And since they've known for
weeks that March 8 was the trial date,
it seems wholly implausible that the de
cision to drop the suit was due only to
that date.
Sure, Pat would rather be campaigning
than testifying. But I'll let you in on a
little secret: Robertson probably hoped
never to reach trial stage; he'd bet that
McCloskey would fold under pressure.
But because McCloskey stood firm,
Robertson was licked. Evidence?

McCloskey dug up dozens of letters
and telegrams sent by Papa Robertson
in 1950-51 to Pat's commanders which
politely stress the senator's "concern" for
Pat's safety, and, in February 1951, his
veiled request that Pat stay in Japan to
receive "more training" before setting off
for Korea.
McCloskey also produced several USS
Breckinridge comrades (and letters from
others) as witnesses to corroborate the
tale of Pat's bailout. Robertson coughed
up mostly character, not material, wit
nesses.
In the end, Robertson quit to avoid
even closer media scrutiny of his padded
resume, and not so much because of the
court date. It's worth noting that Mc-
Closkey has refused all along to recant
or compromise his statements, demand
ing even now that Robertson pay his
$400,000 legal bill.
In 1972, a Vietnam-weary Rep. Pete
McCloskey took on President Richard
Nixon for the GOP presidential nomina
tion. He was right — but before his time.
In 1986, a hypocrisy-weary McCloskey
aimed to set the record straight on Pat
Robertson's record in Korea.
He was right — and right on time.
Semper Fi, Pete.

warlike than that.
Now, in 1988, Robertson insists he's
only dropping the suit because of its "un
fair" trial date. Translation: Federal
Judge Joyce Green refused to give Rob
ertson special handling by bumping the
trial back to late March. I call that
scrupulous fairness, not unfairness.
Pat and his army of lawyers knew all
along that the trial stage of the libel suit
might well interfere with his presidential
campaign. And since they've known for
weeks that March 8 was the trial date,
it seems wholly implausible that the de
cision to drop the suit was due only to
that date.
Sure, Pat would rather be campaigning
than testifying. But I'll let you in on a
little secret: Robertson probably hoped
never to reach trial stage; he'd bet that
McCloskey would fold under pressure.
But because McCloskey stood firm,
Robertson was licked. Evidence?

McCloskey dug up dozens of letters
and telegrams sent by Papa Robertson
in 1950-51 to Pat's commanders which
politely stress the senator's "concern" for
Pat's safety, and, in February 1951, his
veiled request that Pat stay in Japan to
receive "more training" before setting off
for Korea.
McCloskey also produced several USS
Breckinridge comrades (and letters from
others) as witnesses to corroborate the
tale of Pat's bailout. Robertson coughed
up mostly character, not material, wit
nesses.
In the end, Robertson quit to avoid
even closer media scrutiny of his padded
resume, and not so much because of the
court date. It's worth noting that Mc-
Closkey has refused all along to recant
or compromise his statements, demand
ing even now that Robertson pay his
$400,000 legal bill.
In 1972, a Vietnam-weary Rep. Pete
McCloskey took on President Richard
Nixon for the GOP presidential nomina
tion. He was right — but before his time.
In 1986, a hypocrisy-weary McCloskey
aimed to set the record straight on Pat
Robertson's record in Korea.
He was right — and right on time.
Semper Fi, Pete.

WITH THE EXCEPTION of his
second-place finish in lowa,
events of late have not been kind
to the former Rev. Marion G. "Pat" Rob
ertson.
First he got caught fudging his mar
riage date. Then he had a vision — a
blurred one, at best — of nuclear missiles
in Cuba (or was it Aruba?). Next, he
accused George Bush of bringing down
televangelist Jimmy "Sticky Fingers"
Swaggart just to hurt him (Pat, that is)
politically. And now this.
Three days ago Robertson announced
he'd be dropping his $35 million libel
suit against local attorney and former
congressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
citing the inconvenience of the trial date:
March 8, Super Tuesday.
Pat threw in the towel. Avoided com
bat. Wimped out. And not for the first
time, either.
Why the libel suit? McCloskey claimed
in an Aug. 4, 1986 letter widely distrib
uted in political circles that, when both
he and Pat were aboard the USS Breck
inridge bound for the Korean front lines
in February 1951, Lt. Robertson, then
20, used the clout of his father, a U.S.
senator, to escape combat.
While en route, their ship docked
briefly at the port of Kobe, Japan. Mc-
Closkey recalled that, during the
stopover, Robertson made two anxious
phone calls. And when the ship again set
off for Korea, Pat was allowed to stay
behind.
Why? "My single distinct memory,"
stated McCloskey, "is of Pat with a big
grin on his face, standing on the dock
at Kobe after his second phone call,
saying something like, 'So long you guys
— good luck,' and telling us that his

father had gotten him out of combat
duty." Robertson labeled the letter "lies"
and promptly sued.
Pete McCloskey went on to lead a rifle
platoon and earn the Navy Cross, the
Silver Star and a Purple Heart. Robert
son reportedly stayed behind in Japan
for four months, and when he was finally
ordered to Korea, he landed a cushy desk
job as the Division HQ "liquor officer."
"Robertson's major duty was appar
ently to fly to Japan once a week and
bring back booze for the officers' mess,"
asserted McCloskey. But did Pat ever
serve as a "combat officer," as his political
pamphlets boast?
McCloskey answered that Division HQ
was barely even within earshot of friendly
artillery. Hmph — some combat. The
Bush-Rather spat last month was more
warlike than that.
