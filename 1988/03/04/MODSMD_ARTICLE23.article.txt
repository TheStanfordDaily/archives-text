## Greater awareness is needed to overcome apathy 
### 
IF YOU ARE like me, when you
hear the word "activist" you auto
matically cringe. The word conjures
up visions of flower children in bell
bottoms driving multi-colored vans to
sit-ins where they chant and do LSD.
Most students at Stanford today
despise the mythology of '60s activism
— it is pass 6 and decidedly un-cool.
Unfortunately, in rejecting the '60s
version of activism, today's Stanford
students have also discarded the idea
altogether. The power to affect the
course of history that our predecessors
utilized so well 20 years ago is wasted
now; we have traded an outdated form
of activism for inactivism.
The danger inherent in this new
inactivism is quite great. Stanford

students today, due to this inactivism,
are gaining a reputation for both
apathy and stupidity.
A case in point was the March 1
open forum on Stanford's relationship
with South Africa, which I was respon
sible for organizing.
First of all, less than 40 Stanford
students attended this unique opportu
nity for education on Stanford and
South Africa by a highly informed
panel of faculty, students and a trus
tee.
The appallingly small number speaks
for itself.
Second, The Daily's execrable report
ing on the topic of South Africa has
become a given to those of us on the

Commission for Investment Responsi
bility.
Reporting has been consistently
inaccurate, reflecting ignorance of the
basic concepts surrounding the issue of
South Africa, and misuse of the topic's
most elementary vocabulary.
If student publications fail to edu
cate themselves on the global issues
that Stanford students have the ability
to influence, how can we as a student
body call ourselves educated?
Without knowledge of the issues,
how can we claim involvement in the
ethical administration of our own
tuition money? And most importantly,
without our very presence, how can we
make ourselves heard?

The problem of inactivism is not a
national nor a global one, but rather a
flaw within the individual Stanford
student. Our problem is that we are
too busy being trendy to see what is
truly important.
The only way to solve this problem
is through our own involvement. We
should be embarrassed to let reporting
such as that in the March 2 Daily
represent us to the rest of the world.
Moreover, we should be ashamed to
remain uninvolved in global issues in
an age when people around the world
die for the very rights we are too lazy
to exercise.
