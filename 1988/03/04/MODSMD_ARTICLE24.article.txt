# Social problems are linked to new ideas

### 
I was disturbed to read former Fac
ulty Senate Chair Prof. Kenneth Ar
row's criticism of the proposed changes
to'the Western Culture requirement.
IHis statements in a Feb. 24 Campus
Report front page article included the
following remark: "People (those per
sons who want to change the require
ment) are confusing real and vital so
cial problems with the evolution of
ideas."
Interestingly enough, one of the
things I thought I had learned in some
of my classes at Stanford was that
ideas and their evolution are the result
aod/or the cause of real and vital so
cial problems:
• Ideas: democracy, monarchy, Chris
tianity, Judaism, Islam, capitalism,
socialism, feminism, misogyny, racism,
nationalism, pacifism, activism, and
• Real and Vital Social Problems:

war, slavery, poverty, hunger, discrimi
nation, rape, ignorance, pollution.
Surely, to a Nobel laureate in eco
nomics, the connection between the
evolution of ideas and real and vital
social problems should not be confus
ing.
If the purpose of Western Culture is
to study ideas which can not be incor
porated into our dealings with real and
vital social problems, if the purpose of
the program is not to give students a
historical framework of the evolution
of ideas in order to better understand
the world of today with all of its ideas,
problems, and virtues, then what is
the purpose of Western Culture?
Are freshmen being required to buy
all of those books so later they can
look at them admiringly on their
shelves and "think" about how ed
ucated they are because they have
studied the evolution of ideas?
Has the core list just become a sym
bol of this "elite" manner of "think
ing"?
