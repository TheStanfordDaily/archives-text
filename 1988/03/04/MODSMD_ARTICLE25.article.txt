# 'Divestment' isn't University's policy
## 
### 
As a student member of the Com
mission on Investment Responsibility, I
wanted to write to try and clarify the
definition of the terms "divestment"
and "disinvestment," which often arise
within the context of the ClR's and
other groups' activities relating to
South Africa.
Divestment refers to the act of sel
ling stocks from one's portfolio.
In relation to South Africa for in
stance, a person or institution would
sell or divest its portfolio of any stocks
held in companies doing business with
South Africa, selling goods to South
-Africa, majority owned by South
African companies, etc.
Disinvesment calls for the actual
withdrawal from South Africa of com
panies physically located in and doing
business with South Africa (it can

obviously be used within other contexts
as well).
Divestment is something an investor
does while disinvestment is an action
the companies themselves take.
If you have confused the terms in
the past, do not feel alone, because
they are often mixed up and misused
not only around Stanford but around
the nation.
The problems in South Africa are
serious and the issues involved are
confusing enough without the terms
we use being confused as well.
I hope this letter clears up some of
that confusion so that in the future
when we discuss South Africa in terms
of divestment and disinvestment, we
can at least operate from a common
and clear understanding of the vocabu
lary involved.
