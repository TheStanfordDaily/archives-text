## Museum assures rock 'n' roll is here to stay 
### Michelle Finkel Staff writer 
Ed Earl and Norton Rappaport seem
to have the forces of fate working in
their favor. The two Stanford Graduate
School of Business students, who had
not met until a year and a half ago, are
now best friends directing the develop
ment of a hot project that is receiving
national attention: The San Francisco
Rock and Roll Museum.
The non-profit museum is "not an or
dinary museum," based on artifacts and
memorabilia, but an "expression of rock
and roll as current as going to a concert,"
according to Rappaport.
Spanning the history of rock music,
the museum will contain exhibits ranging
from psychedelic rock music of the Viet
nam era, to an "Audio Tunnel," a moving
walkway that plays rock and roll from
every era.
The museum will also include a per
formance stage where visitors can live

out their fantasies of performing on stage
and hearing the screams of ecstatic fans.
The museum will have "archival lis
tening posts" in certain exhibits, allowing
visitors to plug into the archives and
hear music related to the specific display.
Part of the museum, open only to re
searchers, will include famous rock
promoter Bill Graham's personal rock
memorabilia and archival collection. The
research section of the museum will also
contain the Bay Area Music Archives,
which includes musical memorabilia and
18,000 record albums.
According to Rappaport, their museum
will make a cultural statement that is
as important as an art museum's. The
museum will serve an educational pur
pose, emphasizing that rock and roll is
innately a part of our social fabric.
"Rock and roll is totally inescapable.
It is more than a movement. It affects
what we wear, how we cut our hair ...
and what movies we watch," Earl ex
plained.
When the younger generation sees the

displays from the older rock era and hears
the music, they will "understand what
their parents were thinking," Rappaport
added.
One substantial source of museum
funding is the Bay Area Music Awards
to be held on March 12. With musical
stars ranging from Huey Lewis to the
Grateful Dead, the museum is sure to
benefit greatly from the concert. Despite
this financial boost, Earl and Rappaport
are still working on raising $20 million
to fund the museum, which should open
in three to five years.
Earl met Rappaport only last year dur
ing their first term at the Business
School.
Fate placed the pair in all five of the
same classes fall quarter, and the two
quickly became friends. During the win
ter and spring quarters all of their classes
were the same again.
One of these classes, called "Business
and the Arts," provided them with the
opportunity to become involved with the
non-profit sector of business as well as
with a non-profit arts organization.
For the class, the students were re
quired to work on a real-life, non-profit
project. Earl and Rappaport, along with
two other Business School students,
began working with Frank Caufield, chair
of the board of directors for the museum.
A successful venture capitalist in the
Silicon valley, Cau filed is also a serious
rock and roll fan.
Both students had previous experience
in music and were excited about the idea
of starting a rock and roll museum. Earl
plays guitar and sings for the Business
School's band, the Start Ups, and Rap
paport used to book large music concerts
for the University of Illinois, where he
attended undergraduate school.
Despite their excitement over the proj
ect, they feared that the museum's board
of directors had unreasonably high ex
pectations for the project.
The Board of Directors "wanted a busi
ness plan, a timeline of how to go from
the current (situation) to the opening of
the doors," explained Earl. Before going
public with the idea, Earl said he thought
that the board "needed to step back and
answer fundamental questions" about
their plan.
When the project first got under way,
the Stanford students said that one of
their primary concerns was how to ex
press something as vibrant as music in

a context as static as a museum. They
also faced the practical problems of fund
raising and finding a site for the building.
Determined to discover if the project
was indeed feasible, Earl and Rappaport
oversaw a study done by a professional
consulting company. In its findings, the
firm anticipated the museum drawing
300,000 to 500,000 people annually.
Caufleld was so impressed with the
work they had done for the museum, he
suggested that Earl and Rappaport apply
to become the executive directors of the
project.
Earl said that at first he thought it
would be unwise to stop out of business
school for such a risky venture. He soon
overcame his apprehensions, however,
and over the summer he and Rappaport
worked hard to sell themselves to the
board of directors.
"I stayed in California last summer
because I wanted to experience Califor
nia. I wanted to play tennis and barbe
cue," Rappaport said. Instead I spent my
summer "hunched over the computer,
working late."

But their summer sacrifices payed off.
The museum's board of directors hired
them in August. Earl and Rappaport peti
tioned the Business School for a one-year
leave of absence and are now busy making
rock and roll history.
The duo explained that friends initially
thought they were "nuts" for leaving the
Business School for a year. But now
friends consider the undertaking "a great
experience."
The two students are becoming famous
fast. Rolling Stone magazine, several
large daily newspapers, Bay Area televi
sion stations and a Japanese radio station
have all interviewed Rappaport and Earl.
Both said that they still feel like
second-year business students and that
their fame has not changed them.
Now that the museum is well under
way, Earl said he is relieved that rock
and roll is not being "exploited and com
mercialized" by such a large project.
"Rock and roll is a passion of my life,
and I can't see killing the art form. I
think of this museum as a way to hang
art in people's ears," Earl said.
