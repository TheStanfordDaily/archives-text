## Movie Review 'Corners': an offbeat, bizarre treasure 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
"Five Corners" is a dark gem of a
movie. Directed by Tony Bill, it's a
crafted, bizarre tale of life in the Bronx
in 1964. The whole package may lack
something in the way of uplift and vi
sion, but the weird mix of black humor
and violence makes this film distinctive
among the batches of bland films
released every month.
There are several stories going on
here, and they intertwine, but only ran
domly. The central plot involves a young
couple, James (Todd Graff) and Linda
(Jodie Foster), and a demented killer,
Heinz (John Turturro), who is obsessed
with Linda.
Scenes from this story are inter
spersed with comical scenes of two
bimbos out with some peculiar high
school students. The juxtaposition of
violent drama with absurd humor is
jarring, but in this movie it often ac
tually works, creating a fantastically
weird atmosphere.
The bimbos ride up and down on top
of elevators with the high school boys,
chewing gum and kissing: It's funny.

Heinz clubs to death a penguin in front
of Linda: It's unwatchably horrible.
The tone constantly shifts with no
smooth transitions. It's part of the
movie's macabre charm; it's also what
makes the movie hard to swallow, a
little bit heartless.
The film, taken as a whole, is far less
interesting than some of its details,
which tend to be brilliant. Heinz's moth
er, played by the stage actress Rose
Gregorio, is unforgettably creepy: She's
a spacey, doll-like woman, one of the
scariest creations on screen.
Heinz carries Linda into his mother's
apartment — he's beaten Linda uncon
scious — and his mother says, "Oh,
you brought home a friend." It's a chill
ing scene with a shocking, brutal climax.
In another scene, a despised algebra
teacher is shot in the back with a pink
plastic arrow: He falls dead on the side
walk and we're given no explanation as
to who did this, or why. This is warped
humor at its very best.
The film is loaded with terrific details.
They wake you up; you realize this is
a ride you've never been on before. The
writer, John Patrick Shanley, has great
imagination, even if he fails to draw it

In its quirky details
"Five Corners" has
moments of brilliance.

all together into a truly powerful story.
The actors are, without exception, ex
cellent. Each character is distinctive,
motivated by a different passion. This
is a movie with no star, but requiring
strong performances from everyone,
and the actors indeed deliver. The only
big name in the film is Jodie Foster,
and she's good, though no better than
any of the other performers.
This is not a film that will hit you
in the gut with its breadth of vision,
its beauty or the power of its story.
You won't leave thinking, "That was a
great movie," but in its quirky details,
"Five Corners" has moments of bril
liance.
There are scenes here you will never
see the likes of again. It's a weird, dis
turbing show, put together with tre
mendous imagination.
