# Kennedy withdraws subsidies connected to Bohemian Club
## 
### Nick Anderson Editorial staff 
Bowing to months of pressure from
outraged faculty and students, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy agreed
yesterday to rescind Stanford's policy
of subsidizing memberships for some
faculty and staff in social clubs, includ
ing the exclusive, all-male Bohemian
Club.
In a statement released yesterday,
Kennedy said the University will "dis
continue all [social club] subsidies after
the current membership year."
Although Kennedy did not mention
the controversial San Francisco-based
club in his statement, he acknowledged
that the University's practice of provid

ing subsidies to individual memberships
in social clubs had "prompted questions
and concerns" in the Stanford commu
nity.
After allegations surfaced last fall
that the club had discriminated against
members of its restaurant union and
that the University might have com
promised itself by subsidizing dues to
the club for six members of faculty and
staff, Kennedy asked his Administrative
Council to review the subsidy policy.
In the fall, Kennedy repeatedly denied
that the University had any formal ties
to the club, citing individual choice as
the main criterion for continuing to al
low faculty and staff to join whatever
clubs they choose. â€”
But ironically, Kennedy used the

same reasoning yesterday to defend his
decision to accept the Administrative
Council's recommendation to drop the
subsidies. "Faculty and staff ought to
be free to make their own decisions,
based upon their own ethical standards
and preferences," the statement reads.
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Freelen, a member of the coun
cil, denied that the council had consid
ered the Bohemian Club when conduct
ing its review.
"This decision revolves around a
generic issue, not a specific club," said
Freelen, himself a member of the
Bohemian Club. "There are a variety
of clubs affected, and we decided we
ought to get out of the business
of subsidizing and let people make
their own decisions."
Freelen said the Bohemian Club
had not been consulted at any
time during the review.
In fact, Stanford contributes to
"about 30 memberships" in 13

clubs for "20 faculty and staff,"
Kennedy said in January. Freelen
would not speculate whether any
of these clubs had influenced the
decision.
But despite Freelen's and Ken
nedy's reluctance to name the
Bohemians directly, campus op
ponents of the club recognized vic
tory. English Prof. Diane Mid
dlebrook, who along with 63 other
women faculty signed a statement
of protest in December against

the policy of subsidizing dues for
the all-male club, cheered the de
cision.
"I think it's very good news,"
Middlebrook said. "IThe link to
the Bohemian Club] was an em
barrassment to the University."
In a bill last fall authored by
senior Stacey Leyton, the ASSU
Senate also pressured the Univer
sity to investigate its relationship
to the Bohemian Club.
