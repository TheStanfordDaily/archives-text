# Kennedy withdraws subsidies connected to Bohemian Club

Bowing to months of pressure from
outraged faculty and students, Univer

yesterday to rescind Stanford's policy

the club for six members of faculty and
staff, Kennedy asked his Administrative
Council to review the subsidy policy.
In the fall, Kennedy repeatedly denied
that the University had any formal ties
to the club, citing individual choice as
the main criterion for continuing to al

clubs they choose. â€”
But ironically, Kennedy used the

same reasoning yesterday to defend his
decision to accept the Administrative
Council's recommendation to drop the
subsidies. "Faculty and staff ought to

based upon their own ethical standards
and preferences," the statement reads.
Vice President for Public Affairs

ing its review.
"This decision revolves around a
generic issue, not a specific club," said
Freelen, himself a member of the
Bohemian Club. "There are a variety
of clubs affected, and we decided we
