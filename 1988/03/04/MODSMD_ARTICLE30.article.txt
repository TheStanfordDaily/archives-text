## Director Bill 'Corners' market on good films 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Tony Bill is a very versatile tal
ent in the film industry, who has
credits as a producer, director and
actor. His latest film, "Five Cor
ners," which he produced and di
rected, has been receiving a lot of
critical acclaim.
Bill is no stranger to such ac
colades. He won an Academy
Award for best picture in 1973
for producing the megahit, "The
Sting." Despite the box-office suc
cess of that film, Bill is primarily
known as an independent pro
ducer with a reputation for dis
covering new talent.
Throughout his career, Bill has
had a hand in producing such
films as "Steelyard Blues," "Taxi

Driver," "Boulevard Nights," and
"Going In Style." He made his
directorial debut in 1980 with
"My Bodyguard," and followed it
up with "Six Weeks" in 1982.
"Five Corners" is Bill's first fea
ture film as a director since then,
and he recently talked to The
Daily about this film and his
career:
Daily: Throughout your career,
you've usually been involved with
working on "small" films. What
attracts you to these kinds of
films?
Bill: I'm not personally inter
ested in making big, slick movies.
Almost every project starts out as
a small script, then it gradually
builds as more and more people
get interested, and that's when
you start getting your big name

stars. "The Sting" started out as
a small project and got bigger as
more people got interested in it.
But I'm not just interested in
making movies with big stars.
Daily: But if someone gave you
$30 million to make a movie,
wouldn't you like to take it and
just go crazy?
Bill: I don't know. I don't know
what I'd do with all that money.
Making movies is like playing
poker where you're betting mil
lions of dollars on the hand, or
the script, your dealt.
Daily: What exactly attracted
you to the script of "Five Cor
ners?"
Bill: Mainly that it was original
and surprising.
Daily: Have you always been
interested in filmmaking?

Bill: No, I wasn't. When I was
at Norte Dame, I had no thoughts
about going into film.
Daily: When was it that you
first became interested in film?
Bill: After college, I moved out
to LA. and got a job starring in
a film with Frank Sinatra-
Daily: You're first acting job
was a starring role? That's pretty
impressive. Why didn't you con
centrate on an acting career?
Bill: I decided that I didn't want
to become a movie star, I wanted
to make movies.
Daily: Is there any difference
between the movies you like and
the movies you would like to
produce?
Bill: No, I like the films I
produce, and those are the ones
like to see.
