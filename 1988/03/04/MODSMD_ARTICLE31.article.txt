## Hilarious 'Midsummer' brightens up the Nitery 
### Debbie Frockt Staff writer 
Three guesses. What do you think Athens, Vic
torian England, the Roaring '20s and a bunch of
oddball proletariats have in common? The answer
is Shakespeare.
Or at least that's the case according to Humphrey
Gyde's Drama Department production of "A Mid
summer Night's Dream," now playing in the Nitery.
It is a hilariously funny and fun-filled interpretation
that must certainly be as entertaining for an actor
to perform as it is for an audience to watch.
Imagine if you will a lovers' dilemma presumably
set in Victorian England. This is apparent only
from the costumes. However, the dialogue tells us
that this play is really set in Athens, but even if
you only have a passing knowledge of the theater,
you probably know that Shakespeare wrote during
the Renaissance.
You might look to the set design for some clues,
but you'll find little more than a glorified rehearsal
space to help you out And forget program notes,
too. Gyde puts his actors out there entirely on their
own with only some very funny writing to help
them, and it works.
The situation goes something like this. Theseus
(Drew Barr) is planning his betrothal to the lovely
Hippolyta (Kate Gallun). Although Theseus is a
duke, he does not have a monopoly on the lovely
ladies of his duchy.
Enter the lovely Hermia (Heather McClure) with
her tyrannical father Egeus (John Bartunek). Egeus
insists that Hermia must wed the lover of his choice,
who, in this case, is Demetrius (Matt Botvinick).
But, of course, there's a small complication. Her
mia would rather die than be without her true love
Lysander (Tom Clyde), and she says that she will
die, threatening to kill herself if she is forced into
any union with Demetrius.
All of this is extremely difficult for the only fairly
fair Helena (Jennifer Arnold) to understand. She
has an uncontrollable passion for Demetrius, and
despite cruel and constant rebuffs, chases wildly
after him.
Thanks, Bill, for the good set-up. Now imagine,
if you will, the lovers Hermia and Lysander running
off into the woods en route to Lysander's homeland,
where they can happily wed. Of course, these are

no ordinary woods.
The fun is only just beginning when we meet
some enchanting if idiosyncratic fairies who wreak
havoc on the mortals who happen to stumble into
their lair. Oh, by the way, these fairies Sound more
like A 1 Caporie and his mob than a group of extra
terrestial waifs.
Gyde has taken the comedy one step beyond with
this melange of genres, but avoids frivilous
ridiculousness. This is high comedy.
It celebrates the genius of the story with an
innovative twist, and it never relinqueshes its con
trol, thus avoiding the banal. And it's just plain
funny to hear Shakespearian English recited in a
tough-guy New York accent.
Gyde had a difficult task on his hands in casting
this piece. Not only did he have to find a group of
actors skilled enough to handle Shakespearian
writing, he also needed a cast who could believably
incorporate the various time frames into some kind
of cohesive whole, all while doubling up on roles.
He does an excellent job across the board. Drama
Department veterans Barr and Gallun are solid and
enjoyable, especially in their intimate moments.
They have a wonderful chemistry between them
which manages a seething yet infantile attraction
in the fairy scenes and an aloof, refined relationship
in the Victorian roles.
McClure, Botvinick, Clyde, and Arnold are at
their best in a four-way lovers' quarrel which almost
brings the women to blows. The timing is right on,
and the women do an excellent job when they reveal
their cat-claws.
Bartunek, as the workman/director of the enter
tainment for the duke, is sufficiently earnest
throughout and shines in his luny performance as
the man in the moon. His ritualistic idiocy is one
of the comic pinnacles of the entire show. Jeff
Soesbe as Flute, an actor in Bartunek's troupe,
hams it up as both bad actor and tragic princess.
The real accolades, however, must go to John
Shaw as Puck and Christopher Hart as Bottom.
Shaw takes what is little more than a messenger's
role and becomes the fairy henchman who steals
the show. His tough-guy accent is impeccable, but
he doesn't rely on his voice alone.
Shaw employs his whole body, completely in
tegrating the well-known caricature's movements
into everything he does. He also exhibits a sense

of comic timing which addresses the audience at
precisely the right moments.
Hart takes the goofy role of a frustrated actor
and runs with it. Where there is the possiblity for
lines to become cursory, Hart sees opportunity and
thus turns the lines into moments.
He has a subtle sense of how long and far to
carry things, maximizing the potential in each of
his ridiculous lines. He also shows a nice contrast
between the overly enthusiastic actor and the over
come recipient of the fairy queen's affections.
While there are some problems with the split
audience theater in the almost round staging that
Gyde chooses, it is generally effective. The problems
come in the fact that a great deal of the time the
actors have their backs to at least half the audience.
At the other times, we receive only a profile view,
which takes some getting used to. Gyde's choice
does, however, facilitate a rapid and flowing sense
of movement which is essential for the comic timing

of the show.
The obvious lack of any real set or props is also
a nice choice which allows the actors time to con
centrate on timing without any physical obstruc
tions. A more traditional staging with the uncon
ventional acting and costuming styles might have
been too much for an audience to absorb, detracting
from the effect Gyde is trying to create with his
choices in style.
For those who complain that the graduate direc
tors in Drama choose only the most esoteric of
pieces to perform in the most intellectual way,
"Dream" is the play to see if you just want to have
a good time. It is extremely well-done and very
funny. Gyde proves that you don't have to sacrifice
style, class, or creativity in order to be entertaining.
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" performs at the
Nitery tonight through Saturday at 8 p.m. and
Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets are available at the Tres
idder Ticket Office.
