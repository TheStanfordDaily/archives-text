## Cardinal can't break Bruin mystique Stanford's NCAA hopes crushed by UCLA, 91-69 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - The night
mare that began last Saturday
and lingered all week recurred
last night.
And in the haunting confines
of Pauley Pavilion, where Stan
ford had not beaten UCLA in

22 tries, the Cardinal had no chance of waking
up. The Bruins pounced on the sleepwalking
Stanford squad by hustling to a 91-69 victory
in front of 7,453 fans.
UCLA guard Pooh Richardson and friends
did their best to stir the slumbering Cardinal
by bolting on the fast break early and often,
and by crashing the offensive boards. But even
the sound of Bruins whizzing by couldn't wake
Stanford.
"We took a kick in the teeth on Saturday
(Stanford's 63-61 loss to Oregon State in a
battle for second place), and we've had a little
trouble regrouping," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said after the game. "We seemed
to lose our heart out there. We didn't get back
on defense or hit the boards."
The loss dropped Stanford (18-10 overall,
10-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference) down to
fourth place in the Pacific 10 Conference. Stan
ford plays at USC tomorrow at 3 p.m.
UCLA improved to 15-13 overall, 11-6 in the
conference, and moved into third place behind
Arizona and Oregon State, which beat Oregon
last night 59-47.
All five UCLA starters scored in double fig
ures as the Bruins came out succeeding at
everything Stanford needed to stop. Richardson
ran the fast break effortlessly, dishing out seven
assists on the night, and sophomore forward
Trevor Wilson led the Bruins with 19 points.
"This might have been our best all-around
performance of the year," UCLA Coach Walt
Hazzard said. "We had great balance and played
unselfishly."
Stanford might have been able to withstand
the fast-break onslaught if the Cardinal could
have limited UCLA to one shot per charge

down the court. The Bruins, however, snared
offensive rebound after offensive rebound and
Stanford just watched as various UCLA players
laid the ball back in the hoop. The Bruins had
18 offensive rebounds on the night.
"They were just so much more aggressive
than we were," Stanford's Terry Taylor said
afterward. "We were flat-footed out there,
watching them go to the ball."
Bruin senior Craig Jackson came out of a
deep sleep of his own. Jackson scored 15 points,
thanks largely to his nine rebounds. If the
6-foot-8 forward could have made his free
throws (7-for-16), he might have had a career
high game.
In addition to all the Bruin sprinting and
jamming, UCLA frustrated the Cardinal half
court offense with aggressive man-to-man
defense. Todd Lichti was the only productive
Cardinal with the ball, scoring 18 points.
Stanford big men Greg Butler and Howard
Wright were held to a combined nine-for-24
shooting performance, and neither got to the
free-throw line.
The two teams started out even until the
14-minute mark of the first half. UCLA went
to a full-court press and the Pooh show began.
On UCLA's next four possessions, Richard
son dished twice to Kelvin Bryant for layups,
once to Wilson for a leaning 10-foot jumper,
and Pooh finished the act with a coast-to-coast
reverse dipsy-doodle. After the 90-second con
trolled scramble, the Bruins led 18-11, and
Stanford was on the ropes.
"In practice, we concentrated on trying to
keep UCLA from the transition game, and
that's what we did worst today," Montgomery
said.
So Stanford falls to fourth place in the Pac
-10. The Cardinal could still finish in third if
it beats USC tomorrow and California defeats
UCLA Sunday. A fourth-place finish would put
Stanford in Arizona's bracket at the conference
tournament next weekend on the Wildcats'
home court.
Tomorrow's game against the Trojans will
be telecast on KPIX-TV, channel 5.

three-pointer, and was perfect from the charity stripe.

Stanford.
"We took a kick in the teeth on Saturday
(Stanford's 63-61 loss to Oregon State in a
battle for second place), and we've had a little
trouble regrouping," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said after the game. "We seemed
to lose our heart out there. We didn't get back
on defense or hit the boards."
The loss dropped Stanford (18-10 overall,
10-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference) down to
fourth place in the Pacific 10 Conference. Stan
ford plays at USC tomorrow at 3 p.m.
UCLA improved to 15-13 overall, 11-6 in the
conference, and moved into third place behind
Arizona and Oregon State, which beat Oregon
last night 59-47.
All five UCLA starters scored in double fig
ures as the Bruins came out succeeding at
everything Stanford needed to stop. Richardson
ran the fast break effortlessly, dishing out seven
assists on the night, and sophomore forward
Trevor Wilson led the Bruins with 19 points.
"This might have been our best all-around
performance of the year," UCLA Coach Walt
Hazzard said. "We had great balance and played
unselfishly."
Stanford might have been able to withstand
the fast-break onslaught if the Cardinal could
have limited UCLA to one shot per charge

down the court. The Bruins, however, snared
offensive rebound after offensive rebound and
Stanford just watched as various UCLA players
laid the ball back in the hoop. The Bruins had
18 offensive rebounds on the night.
"They were just so much more aggressive
than we were," Stanford's Terry Taylor said
afterward. "We were flat-footed out there,
watching them go to the ball."
Bruin senior Craig Jackson came out of a
deep sleep of his own. Jackson scored 15 points,
thanks largely to his nine rebounds. If the
6-foot-8 forward could have made his free
throws (7-for-16), he might have had a career
high game.
In addition to all the Bruin sprinting and
jamming, UCLA frustrated the Cardinal half
court offense with aggressive man-to-man
defense. Todd Lichti was the only productive
Cardinal with the ball, scoring 18 points.
Stanford big men Greg Butler and Howard
Wright were held to a combined nine-for-24
shooting performance, and neither got to the
free-throw line.
The two teams started out even until the
14-minute mark of the first half. UCLA went
to a full-court press and the Pooh show began.
On UCLA's next four possessions, Richard
son dished twice to Kelvin Bryant for layups,
once to Wilson for a leaning 10-foot jumper,
and Pooh finished the act with a coast-to-coast
reverse dipsy-doodle. After the 90-second con
trolled scramble, the Bruins led 18-11, and
Stanford was on the ropes.
"In practice, we concentrated on trying to
keep UCLA from the transition game, and
that's what we did worst today," Montgomery
said.
So Stanford falls to fourth place in the Pac
-10. The Cardinal could still finish in third if
it beats USC tomorrow and California defeats
UCLA Sunday. A fourth-place finish would put
Stanford in Arizona's bracket at the conference
tournament next weekend on the Wildcats'
home court.
Tomorrow's game against the Trojans will
be telecast on KPIX-TV, channel 5.

Johnson In last week's win over the Ducks, led the Cardinal with 18 points as Stanford fell into fourth place
in the Pacific 10 Conference by losing to UCLA. Lichti hit seven of 12 shots from the field, including a
three-pointer, and was perfect from the charity stripe.
