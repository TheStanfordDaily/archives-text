# UCLA, ESPN visit Card
## First-ever televised game from Sunken Diamond 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
ESPN's coverage
of college baseball
has fallen victim to
its own success.
The all-sports
cable television
network, which

will make the first live broadcast
from Sunken Diamond ever to
morrow at 11 a.m. as Stanford
hosts UCLA, has spent the last
seven years bringing the NCAA
College World Series (and regular
season games for the last five
years) to the nation.
ESPN will again cover the CWS
in June, but this year CBS has
taken the championship game.
"Obviously we're disappointed
that we lost [the championship
game]," ESPN staff publicist
Craig Muckle said in a phone in
terview Wednesday from ESPN
headquarters in Bristol, Conn.
"But the fact that CBS saw
enough interest shows that the
popularity of college baseball has
grown."
And most observers give ESPN
credit for that growth. "There's
no question about it — the in
creased popularity of college base
ball goes hand in hand with
ESPN's coverage," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "Most
of the people you talk to who have
come into contact with college
baseball came into contact with
it through ESPN."

"I think before we did it, no
one really followed college base
ball that much except for the
people in the teams' areas,"
Muckle said. ?"[The cable
coverage] has really brought col
lege baseball to the forefront."
ESPN was organized in 1979
and began broadcasting the Col
lege World Series the next year.
The channel had signed an agree
ment with the NCAA to cover
several collegiate championships,
and the CWS fell under the agree
ment. "We were really just looking
for anything then — looking for
a foothold to get started," Muckle
said.
The collegiate baseball cover
age, Muckle said, "really took off."
By 1982 ESPN was also broad
casting 10-15 regular-season col
lege baseball games a year. This
year the channel is beaming 13
regular-season games, including
tomorrow's from Sunken Dia
mond, into the roughly 46 million
homes that subscribe to ESPN.
The first broadcast this year —
a game between Louisiana State
and Florida State on Feb. 21 —
garnered a 1.1 Nielsen rating in
competition against the Winter
Olympics. A 1.1 rating figures out
to about 500,000 homes, Muckle
said, explaining that ESPN shoots
for a 2 rating for most of its pro
grams. Last year's CWS champi
onship game between Stanford
and Oklahoma State netted a 2.5
rating.
College baseball "has been good

to us," Muckle said.
And ESPN has been good to
college baseball. The television
coverage helps attendance and
helps recruiting: as college base
ball becomes more popular and
gets more exposure, high school
stars are more likely to consider
playing college ball instead of
going straight into the minors.
"Being on TV, showing nice
facilities and showing a high level
of play — it definitely helps,"
Marquess said. "It gives you that
exposure and makes people
familiar with the program."
Card notes
The UCLA series opens at 2 p.m.
at Sunken Diamond, with subsequent
games at 11 a.m. tomorrow and 1
p.m. Sunday. In addition to tomor
row's live ESPN broadcast, all three
games will be broadcast live on KZSU
radio, 90.1 FM, with the eloquent
John Platz and the immensely in
formative Randy Chappel handling
the play-by-play.
The defending national champion
Cardinal comes into the weekend's
Pacific 10 Southern Division series
with a 14-5 record overall and a 2-0
record in the Six-Pac. Stanford,
ranked third nationally in the Base
ball America poll and fourth in the
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball poll, is on
a nine-game winnning streak.
The Bruins, 12-7 on the year and
2-3 in conference, are ranked 18th by
Baseball America and 20th by ESPN
Collegiate Baseball. UCLA dropped
two of three to Arizona State two
weeks ago and split with Arizona last
weekend.
Senior righthander Lee Plemel (3-1
this year with a 4.10 ERA) will start
for the Cardinal today, with freshman
Mike Mussina (3-1, 2.72) going to
morrow and freshman Stan Spencer
(3-1, 2.32) taking the mound Sunday.
The Bruins will counter with senior
lefthander Mike Magnate (3-1, 6.25)
today, freshman righty Scott Schanz
(2-1, 5.06) tomorrow and sophomore
southpaw Dave Zancanero (1-1, 3.83)
Sunday.
Against the left-handed starters,
Marquess probably will start right
handed hitting Bophomore Brian
Johnson in left field. Johnson has
been splitting time there with JC
transfer Jack Hollis, who bats left
handed.
Former Stanford star Jack
McDowell, who got the victory for
the Cardinal in the College World Se
ries championship game last June,
continues to attract preseason
publicity as he trains with the Chicago
White Sox. In its mfyor league preview
issue, Sport magazine named
McDowell as the favorite to win Amer
ican League Rookie of the Year
honors. Baseball America features
McDowell, under the headline "White
Sox Savior" on the cover of its current
issue, and also picks him to be Amer
ican League Rookie of the Year. The
feature article in Baseball America
refers to him as the "Great White
Sox Hope." McDowell was 3-0 in four
starts for the White Sox after a late
season call-up last year.
In other Six-Pac action this week
end, league-leading California travels
to Arizona and ASU plays at USC.

year the channel is beaming 13
regular-season games, including
tomorrow's from Sunken Dia
mond, into the roughly 46 million
homes that subscribe to ESPN.
The first broadcast this year —
a game between Louisiana State
and Florida State on Feb. 21 —
garnered a 1.1 Nielsen rating in
competition against the Winter
Olympics. A 1.1 rating figures out
to about 500,000 homes, Muckle
said, explaining that ESPN shoots
for a 2 rating for most of its pro
grams. Last year's CWS champi
onship game between Stanford
and Oklahoma State netted a 2.5
rating.
College baseball "has been good

to us," Muckle said.
And ESPN has been good to
college baseball. The television
coverage helps attendance and
helps recruiting: as college base
ball becomes more popular and
gets more exposure, high school
stars are more likely to consider
playing college ball instead of
going straight into the minors.
"Being on TV, showing nice
facilities and showing a high level
of play — it definitely helps,"
Marquess said. "It gives you that
exposure and makes people
familiar with the program."
Card notes
The UCLA series opens at 2 p.m.
at Sunken Diamond, with subsequent
games at 11 a.m. tomorrow and 1
p.m. Sunday. In addition to tomor
row's live ESPN broadcast, all three
games will be broadcast live on KZSU
radio, 90.1 FM, with the eloquent
John Platz and the immensely in
formative Randy Chappel handling
the play-by-play.
The defending national champion
Cardinal comes into the weekend's
Pacific 10 Southern Division series
with a 14-5 record overall and a 2-0
record in the Six-Pac. Stanford,
ranked third nationally in the Base
ball America poll and fourth in the
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball poll, is on
a nine-game winnning streak.
The Bruins, 12-7 on the year and
2-3 in conference, are ranked 18th by
Baseball America and 20th by ESPN
Collegiate Baseball. UCLA dropped
two of three to Arizona State two
weeks ago and split with Arizona last
weekend.
Senior righthander Lee Plemel (3-1
this year with a 4.10 ERA) will start
for the Cardinal today, with freshman
Mike Mussina (3-1, 2.72) going to
morrow and freshman Stan Spencer
(3-1, 2.32) taking the mound Sunday.
The Bruins will counter with senior
lefthander Mike Magnate (3-1, 6.25)
today, freshman righty Scott Schanz
(2-1, 5.06) tomorrow and sophomore
southpaw Dave Zancanero (1-1, 3.83)
Sunday.
Against the left-handed starters,
Marquess probably will start right
handed hitting Bophomore Brian
Johnson in left field. Johnson has
been splitting time there with JC
transfer Jack Hollis, who bats left
handed.
Former Stanford star Jack
McDowell, who got the victory for
the Cardinal in the College World Se
ries championship game last June,
continues to attract preseason
publicity as he trains with the Chicago
White Sox. In its mfyor league preview
issue, Sport magazine named
McDowell as the favorite to win Amer
ican League Rookie of the Year
honors. Baseball America features
McDowell, under the headline "White
Sox Savior" on the cover of its current
issue, and also picks him to be Amer
ican League Rookie of the Year. The
feature article in Baseball America
refers to him as the "Great White
Sox Hope." McDowell was 3-0 in four
starts for the White Sox after a late
season call-up last year.
In other Six-Pac action this week
end, league-leading California travels
to Arizona and ASU plays at USC.



Junior center fielder Eric DeGraw has responded well to the first
significant playing time of his career.
ESPN's coverage
of college baseball
has fallen victim to
its own success.
The all-sports
cable television
network, which

will make the first live broadcast
from Sunken Diamond ever to
morrow at 11 a.m. as Stanford
hosts UCLA, has spent the last
seven years bringing the NCAA
College World Series (and regular
season games for the last five
years) to the nation.
ESPN will again cover the CWS
in June, but this year CBS has
taken the championship game.
"Obviously we're disappointed
that we lost [the championship
game]," ESPN staff publicist
Craig Muckle said in a phone in
terview Wednesday from ESPN
headquarters in Bristol, Conn.
"But the fact that CBS saw
enough interest shows that the
popularity of college baseball has
grown."
And most observers give ESPN
credit for that growth. "There's
no question about it — the in
creased popularity of college base
ball goes hand in hand with
ESPN's coverage," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "Most
of the people you talk to who have
come into contact with college
baseball came into contact with
it through ESPN."

"I think before we did it, no
one really followed college base
ball that much except for the
people in the teams' areas,"
Muckle said. ?"[The cable
coverage] has really brought col
lege baseball to the forefront."
ESPN was organized in 1979
and began broadcasting the Col
lege World Series the next year.
The channel had signed an agree
ment with the NCAA to cover
several collegiate championships,
and the CWS fell under the agree
ment. "We were really just looking
for anything then — looking for
a foothold to get started," Muckle
said.
The collegiate baseball cover
age, Muckle said, "really took off."
By 1982 ESPN was also broad
casting 10-15 regular-season col
lege baseball games a year. This
year the channel is beaming 13
regular-season games, including
tomorrow's from Sunken Dia
mond, into the roughly 46 million
homes that subscribe to ESPN.
