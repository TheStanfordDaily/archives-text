# Hoops heats up in L.A.
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Step aside, Los Angeles Lakers —
a really hot team is coming to
town. Hoping to run away with
the Pacific 10 Conference crown,
the Stanford women's basketball
team heads south to face perennial
powers UCLA and USC on their

home courts.
The Bruins, Stanford's host tonight at 7 p.m.,
currently have a firm lock on fourth place in the
league with a 9-5 conference record, 16-10 overall.
The Trojans, Saturday's 5:45 p.m. opponent, are
tied with Washington for second place in the
Pac-10 at 12-2 (only a game behind Stanford),
are 18-6 on the season and hold the No. 16 spot
on the Associated Press poll. Both games will be
broadcast on KZSU 90.1 FM.
This weekend, it is the home teams that are
the underdogs. The Cardinal enters the series
enjoying sole possession of first place in the con
ference with a 13-1 mark, a formidable 25-1
overall record and the No. 8 AP ranking, the
highest in the program's history.
The first team to put these accolades to the
test is UCLA, a large team enhanced by the
abilities of 5-foot-10 senior forward Dora Dome.
The Bruins' leading scorer at 19.6 points per
game and top rebounder at 8.4 per game, Dome
rates second in Pac-10 scoring and third in
caroms.
"She's a really a nice shooter, a nice player,"
Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They have a very strong front line. They're
athletic; they're quick; they're really a strong
team. Our work will be cut out for us on the

boards, we're going to have to play good defense
and we want to be in our transition game — we
don't want to be standing around trying to defend
them."
The going only gets rougher Saturday. The
Trojans are currently riding on a four-game win
streak and, since they play California on Thurs
day night, will have an extra day of rest before
facing the Cardinal.
USC's biggest asset is four-time Pac-10 Player
of the Week Cherie Nelson. The 6-3 junior center
leads the conference in scoring and rebounding
with a whopping 24.2 ppg and an equally im
pressive 11.4 rpg.
"They have one exceptional, exceptional player
in Cherie Nelson," VanDerveer said. "She can
take over a game, really take charge of a game,
and we're going to have to not let that happen.
Their other players are very good, but Cherie's
exceptional."
No need to pity the Cardinal, however. Stanford
eryoys a lineup that is extraordinarily deep,
shown by the fact that six different players have
topped the team's scoring effort in the 26 games
played, and eight have led the Cardinal in
rebounding.
"The individual players on our team I think
will match up quite well," junior guard Emily
Wagner said. "We have a better all-around inside
game, we can throw more people at them than
any other team, I think our guards (freshman)
Soi\ja (Henning) and (sophomore) Jennifer (Azzi)
are bar-none the best duo in the league, and our
three-spot people are tough as well.
"We're a tough all-around team, especially
leading down the stretch. We're doing well," she
added.
