# Card volleyball nips Northridge

### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
As expected, it was
extremely close.
But the good guys
won â€” and that,
unfortunately,
can't always be ex
pected.

Stanford's improving volleyball
team squeezed out a 15-2, 10-15,
15-13, 1-15, 15-4 victory over Cal
State-Northridge last night at
Maples Pavillion, and, yes, it was
as close as the the number of
games indicates. With the victory,
the No. 13 Cardinal (10-10 over
all, 4-4 in league play) took over
sole possession of sixth place in
the Western Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association. Stanford next
faces UCLA at 7 p.m. today at
Maples.
The Matadors record fell to 3-5,
dropping them to seventh place
in the league.
"We didn't play as well as we
have been playing," Northridge
Coach John Price said, "but Stan
ford had a lot to do with that."
Price's assessment seems cor
rect on both counts, as the Car
dinal victory reflected periods of
excellent play by the home team,
as well as numerous critical mis
takes by the Matadors.
Stanford got out to a quick start
in the match, recording 20 kills
in the first game, with only one
hitting error. That translates into
an insurmountable .613 hitting
percentage.
"We came out real strong in
the first game," senior Brad Nel

son said. "A lot of times we start
slowly, so we really wanted to
come out firing tonight."
But it wasn't to be a cakewalk.
After playing well throughout the
second game, Northridge saw the
chance to take control in the pivo
tal third game. Junior hitter
Robert Samuelson, who won
match honors with 23 kills, led
the Matadors to a 12-10 lead in
that game. But Stanford, owing
to three crucial Northridge
miscues, came back to win the
game, 15-13.
The fourth game went nowhere
for the Cardinal, as the Matadors
showed that they weren't going
to roll over and give the match
away. "They knew their backs
were against the wall," Nelson
said. "They came out in the fourth
game and proved what a good
team they are."
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm had
a more technical explanation. "We
have a tendency to go through
spells where we don't block well,"
he said. "The fourth game was
clearly one of those spells."
Stanford, however, had more
than enough of that undefinable
savvy left to win the fifth and
deciding game going away. The
Cardinal won eight of the game's
last nine points to secure a victory
it desparately needed.
"We take our matches one at a
time, so I really haven't thought
much about UCLA," Sturm said.
"I know that we'll have to serve
tough and block smart, however,
if we are to win."
"They are certainly beatable,"
Nelson said.
