# Women's tennis wins first round
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
The fat was
trimmed from the
field yesterday in
the first round of
the USTA/ITCA
Women's National
Collegiate Indoor

Team Tennis Championship, and
the eight remaining teams will
get down to serious business in
today's quarterfinal matches.
Each of the nation's top eight
teams won its first-round match
yesterday at Nielsen Stadium in
Madison, Wis., with top-ranked
Stanford posting the most con
vincing victory of the day, a 6-0
triumph over unranked North
western.
The Cardinal, 11-0, will meet
No. 7 SMU in a quarterfinal
match this afternoon. The Mus
tangs defeated defending NCAA
runner-up Georgia 6-3 yesterday.
Stanford may be playing half
way across the country, but at
least two of the Cardinal players
are right at home in Wisconsin.
Freshmen Tami and Teri Whit
linger, who hail from Neenah,
Wis., had a successful homecom
ing yesterday.
"Both the Whitlingers played
very well," Stanford Asst. Coach
Caryn Copeland said.
Tami Whitlinger, playing in the
No. 1 position, routed Northwest
ern's Julie Staples 6-1, 6-1. Teri
Whitlinger, in the No. 3 spot,
bested the Wildcats' Soyoung Lee
6-2, 6-2.

Freshman Sandra Birch, who
had not practiced for four days
leading up to the tournament be
cause of a muscle spasm in her
right leg, responded well yester
day with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over
Wendy Nelson in the No. 4
singles.
Birch normally plays No. 3
singles, but Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan decided to switch her
and Teri Whitlinger in the lineup
because of the injury.
Other straight-set winners for
the Cardinal yesterday were
seniors Kay Tittle and Cari
Hagey. Tittle beat Northwestern's
Cindy Galloway 6-2, 6-2 in the
No. 5 singles, and Hagey defeated
Tonya Evans 7-5, 6-2 in the No.
6 match.
Northwestern's Kristin Willey
extended Stanford sophomore
Lisa Green to three sets in the
No. 2 contest. "Lisa was strug
gling, (and) the girl she was
playing was having the day of her
life," Copeland said.
Nevertheless, Green prevailed
4-6, 6-2, 6-2.
SMU should provide a more
substantial challenge for the Car
dinal today. The Mustangs return
almost everyone from last year's
team, which made it to the NCAA
semifinals and upset third-seeded
California along the way.
The other quarterfinal matches
today will pit second-seeded
Florida against Kentucky, third
seeded USC against Miami (Fla.),
and fourth-seeded Cal against
UCLA.
