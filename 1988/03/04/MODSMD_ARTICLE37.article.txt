# Men's gymnastics hopes to make a strong encore

"Never trust a ranking."
While this is not an especially
popular or necessarily applicable
aphorism, it is helpful to anybody
following the world of collegiate
men's gymnastics.
Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., in its

final home meet of the season, No. 9 Stanford
will host No. 10 Fullerton State and unranked
California in a meet that should be less compet
itive than the rankings of the first two teams
might indicate. The Cardinal's ranking does not
include its most recent competition when the
squad recorded the highest team score in the
nation thus far this season.
Stanford's 285.95 explosion set a school record
and a score within five points of it Saturday
would probably mean another victory for the
12-4 Cardinal. Maples Pavilion was packed with
a dual meet record 3,000 fans last Friday, and
the Cardinal hopes for similar support for its
season finale tomorrow.
Fullerton boasts the talents of excellent indi
vidual performers, such as Bill Barham, but lacks
the depth to compcte with a Cardinal team that
goes 10 men deep in a sport which allows a
maximum of six competitors in any one event.
Although it has been a week since its history
making performance which included the breaking
or tying of four team and three individual records,
the Cardinal gymnasts are still feeling the positive
effects of such a satisfying team synthesis.
The confidence of the squad, however, is tem
pered by the knowledge that the season's vital

meets, the Pacific 10 Championships and the
NCAAs, are still to come. As well, Stanford Coach
Sadao Hamada said after the meet that there
was no doubt his gymnasts still had room for
improvement.
Some of that room will be filled if a couple
key gymnasts can recover from injuries which
have been restricting their performances for the
past month. Senior Randy Besosa set a school
record for the all-around two years ago with a
57.65; however, tomorrow night will be his first
opportunity this season to compete on all six
events. Besosa's knee problem is not yet com
pletely diagnosed and midseason surgery may be
necessary.
While the Cardinal's three seniors — Besosa,
Mike Matzek and Chuck Gerardo — have been
turning in the big scores this year, a strong
supporting cast has been performing at a level
that deserves more complimentary superlatives
than "supporting."
Junior Scott Schaffer qualified for the NCAAs
on the vault last year and has continued to excel
in his specialty this season. Also, Stanford's
season-best list shows sophomores Charles Loop
and Conrad Voorsanger cracking the top three
on three events between them.
Card Notes
Last weekend, Voorsanger unveiled a high bar move
for the Maples crowd which was so unexpected that
many fans may well have missed it, closing their eyes
to avoid viewing what they thought would be a dis
astrous accident. Voorsanger released from the bar
into a maneuver that appeared to be a serious error,
but the gasps of fright turned to cheers of wonder
when Voorsanger caught the bar facing away from it.
