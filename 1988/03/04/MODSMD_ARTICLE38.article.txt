# Farewells for gymnasts
## Three say goodbye in season's final dual meet 
### Karen Gryler Staff writer 
"Parting is such
sweet sorrow,"
echo three Cardi
nal gymnasts —
Cindy Boyd, Alison
McGann and Jinny
Rhee — as they

prepare for their final competition
in Maples Pavilion Saturday at
7:30 p.m. against UC-Santa Bar
bara.
Each gymnast has received high
praise for her years of competition
as a Cardinal. But they have also
had to pay a price: hard work in
the gym three and a half hours
a day, five days a week.
Boyd readily admits that she
has had her ups and downs, but
emphasizes the ups. "I have really
enjoyed being-part of a very spe
cial team," she said.
A former elite gymnast from a
prestigious private club, Boyd has
put in solid first-class perform
ances for the Stanford team in
her four years. Boyd will be
remembered most of all for her
sensational beam routine where
her incredible flexibility, clean
tricks and graceful dance show
off her talent to the fullest.
If a few words could describe
McGann's performances over the
years, they would have to be "a
consistent team player." McGann
continually leads the team during
a competition, not only in scoring

but by maintaining focus and di
rection from beginning to end.
Though she has been competing
for many years, McGann is still
improving. Last weekend she
earned the highest all-around
score, 37.40, of her entire gym
nastics career.

Rhee, a junior, has decided to
move on and pursue other inter
ests.
"Competing four years takes a
lot of dedication and commit
ment," she explained, "and there

are some other things I want to
do right now."
Rhee feels very satisfied with
her years of competition at Stan
ford. One of the most talented
gymnasts Stanford has seen, Rhee
competed in the University World
Games and was the only American
to reach the finals.
Additionally, she currently
holds the Stanford record for the
highest uneven bars score — a
9.70. Her crowd pleasing double
pike back flip on floor and shy
smile will be sorely missed next
year.
These three will give their
farewell address to the Stanford
fans this weekend against an out
gunned UCSB team. Though the
Gauchos are not a serious threat
to win the meet, Stanford Coach

Homer Sardina has very specific
goals in mind.
"Our motivating factor is to get
a high score to raise us in the
rankings going into regionals,"
Sardina explained.
Currently ranked fifth in a very
competitive region that includes
top-ranked UCLA, Sardina wants
his team to move into the fourth
place position by the regional com
petition in April.
Because the men's team will be
competing simultaneously, the
primary challenge facing the
women will be to maintain their
focus. Last weekend, the team fell
prey to distraction in a coed meet
against UCIJV.
Sardina has confidence that his
team will overcome this problem.
"I'm looking for a record breaking
meet," he stated. What a nice way
that would be for Cindy Boyd,
Alison McGann, and Jinny Rhee
to say goodbye to competition at
Stanford.
