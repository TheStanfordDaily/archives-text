# Men's netters singly play doubles
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
In each of the 10
dual matches the
Stanford men's
tennis team has
played this year,
singles matches
have decided the

outcome. The Cardinal, now at
9-1 at the season's midpoint, suf
fered its only loss after the singles
draw to USC and has been forced
to pull out nary a win during
doubles competition.
But in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence matches this spring and the
NCAAs in May, the outcome of
the three doubles matches will
more than likely mean victory or
defeat for Stanford. Come crunch
time in a tight match, strong
doubles tandems can tip the bal
ance.
"We haven't played a lot of
doubles," Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "In the long
run, winning and losing will come
down to doubles. It's a major part
of collegiate tennis."
Indeed, the Cardinal, noted for
its team championships and
singles champions such as John
McEnroe (1978), Tim Mayotte
(1981) and Dan Goldie (1986), is
not usually thought of for its
doubles teams. Whitlinger, in
1974 with Jim Delaney, was part
of the last Stanford doubles tan
dem to capture the NCAA crown.
In an effort to stabilize this
year's untested Cardinal doubles
corps — and build a foundation
for a potential NCAA winner —
Stanford enters three doubles
teams in the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships today
through Sunday in La Jolla.
The field is made up of several
top-notch college pairs, as well as
some professional players.
While the regular combinations
have been shuffled, the tourna
ment gives each player a chance
to concentrate solely on his
doubles play for a weekend. Be

cause of a consolation bracket,
each contestant is guaranteed two
matches.
"We do need (doubles) work,"
Whitlinger said. "I know our
doubles teams will get better.
There have been flashes of bril
liance, but the teams haven't
shown consistency yet."
"I believe we have a very good
doubles situation here. I'd love to
see my reign as the last Stanford
NCAA doubles champion ended."
Sophomores Jeff Cathrall and
Eric Peus are the only regular
Stanford starting doubles team
entering the tournament.
Cathrall and Peus normally play
No. 3 doubles.

'In the long run,
winning and losing
will come down to
doubles.'

Freshman David Wheaton,
usually combined with Jeff
Tarango at No. 2 doubles, will
play with freshman Dan Turbow.
Wheaton and Turbow competed
together once before in the 9-0
sweep over the University of San
Diego last Friday.
Tarango, who is having some
problems with his feet, is taking
the weekend off. Wheaton and
Tarango, who played together ex
tensively as high school juniors,
were rated second nationally in
the preseason rankings.
Freshmen Martin Blackman
and Glenn Solomon are the other
Cardinal entry. Blackman's regu
lar partner is senior Patrick
McEnroe, who is playing in a pro
fessional tournament with 1986
Stanford grad Jim Grabb in Palm
Springs this weekend.
McEnroe, who is ranked in the
top 50 in the world professional
rankings, won the TransAmerica
Open in San Francisco with
Grabb this fall.
