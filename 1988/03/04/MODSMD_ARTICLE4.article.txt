# Faculty Senate straw vote narrowly favors core list
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
In a non-binding straw vote, the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday narrowly favored
retaining a broad core list of texts in the
Western Culture program.
Important figures in the debate, in
cluding Senate Chair Gerald Lieberman
and Committee on Undergraduate
Studies Chair Craig Heller, said they
hope the senate will reach a final vote
on the proposed changes at its next
meeting March 31.
The proposal before the senate, known
as "Culture, Ideas and Values," would
abolish the core list; it also calls for the
expansion of study of non-Western works
and the inclusion of more works by
women and minorities.
Although the closeness of yesterday's
vote indicates that the senate is still split
over the core list issue, Heller said the
senate is in the process of moving toward
a consensus on the matter. "The vote
signifies that we are very divided and we
have to work on compromise," Heller
said.
English Prof. William Chace, who leads
a group of faculty members favoring
retention of a core list, said after the

meeting that the senate "is wisely moving
toward the best kind of compromise,
which I thought was possible at the out
set a month ago."
"We need to retain some kind of struc
ture, some kind of stability," Chace said
of the Western Culture program. "The
only way I think you can get that is
through a list of books, a list of themes,
a list of ideas."
Black Student Union President Bill
King disagreed, saying the core list
"hamstrings and handcuffs the faculty
who want to innovate."
King said that "there was more
balanced discussion" at yesterday's
meeting, and that both proponents and
opponents of the CIV proposal were
moving toward compromise.
VTSS Lecturer Barry Katz, an out
spoken proponent of the CIV proposal,
said the senate's poll yesterday "seems
to be a vote to hold the line on the status
quo, which to my mind is extremely
depressing."
Calling the senate's vote on the core
list "an explicit repudiation of the CIV
proposal," Katz said the CIV proposal's
chances of passage in the full senate are
now "very slender."
Since the senate's last meeting, mem

bers have been debating seven questions
concerning the Area One requirement in
a "quasi committee of the whole" â€” in
which senators informally discuss their
views.
Though legislation is not passed in this
kind of forum, University Provost James
Rosse said debate and straw polls of sen
ate members allow new ideas to come
out and help the body decide which issues
should be seriously considered.
Although debate continues to be
heated, Heller said he is still confident
a new core list can be developed without
the problems of the current one. The
current list inhibits innovation, has a
record of being inflexible, does not reflect
the intentions of the original Western
Culture proposal and has a low rate of
compliance, he said.
A new core list, according to Heller,
"should be constructed and agreed upon
by the people teaching."
The senate unanimously agreed there
should be components of shared intellec
tual content in all Western Culture
tracks. Classics Prof. Marsh McCall said
this uniformity meant establishing an
other core list, which could cause the
same problems as the existing core list.
However, University President Donald

Kennedy argued that "there are kinds of
lists that could deliver a common intel
lectual experience while still being
flexible."
The third question the senate wrestled
with was whether non-Western cultures
should be studied in the Area One tracks

and voted that each track should study
at least one non-Western culture that
has influenced American society.
Heller maintained his position that
other cultures should be studied within
the context of their impact on American
culture.
Though many have argued that Area
One should include the study of many
non-European cultures, Heller said "it is
not intended that Area One become a
world culture course. One of the things
that should be appreciated is cultural
blending and interaction."
Students already study other cultures
through the non-Western Culture re
quirement, Heller said, adding that a sub
committee of the CUS is studying possi
ble improvements for this requirement.
Heller's statements prompted a series
of questions as to whether the CUS pro
posal limits the study of non-Western
societies to those that have had interac
tion with the United States and not with
other Western countries.
While admitting that the proposal
would indeed create such limitations,
Kennedy said the debate shouldn't focus
on particular countries.

Western Culture "is really
about a set of backgrounds that
contribute to the understanding
of the institutions, and traditions
of the culture in which the stu
dents will move," Kennedy said.
At the next meeting, the quasi
committee must still discuss two
questions before the senate votes
on the CUS proposal. The ques
tions include: whether the num
ber of tracks should be increased
from eight to 10 and whether a
proposed body should be intro
duced to govern the tracks.
In other developments at the
meeting, Kennedy previewed a
University health and safety
report that will be released today.
According to Kennedy, "the
report does not contain sugges
tions of clear and present dangers
in Stanford workplaces."
Updating the status of the Uni
versity Centennial campaign,
Campaign Director Bruce
Hinchliffe said the campaign is
experiencing "excellent progress"
in obtaining $1.1 billion in con
tributions by 1991. However, he
said "there is some difficulty be
hind the scenes" in obtaining
large donations to help finance
the Near West project, a proposed
development of engineering and
science buildings.
