# Swimmers shoot for NCAAs
## Three women battle to fill the final spot 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
So much for rivalries.
Although the wom
en's swimming teams
from both Stanford
and California will be
swimming in the same
pools this weekend,

their only opponent will be the clock.
The California Invitational, today at
Spieker Pool in Berkeley at 2 p.m.,
and the Stanford Invitational, tomor
row at deGuerre Pool at 10:30 a.m.,
are the last two chances for Stanford
swimmers to qualify for the NCAA
Championships. The NCAA meet will
be March 17-19 at Texas.
Stanford has already qualified 16
swimmers for NCAAs, one fewer than
the allowable limit, and three swim
mers will be trying for that spot this
weekend. Sophomore Lisa Gillespie
and juniors Dana Anderson and Carrie
will all seek qualifying times
at deGuerre Saturday, and both An

derson and Gillespie will travel to
Spieker today.
Anderson and Gillespie, qualifiers
and point-scorers at NCAAs last
season, both have hnd injuries this
year. Anderson, who took ninth in

I don't go (to NCAAs)

the 500-yard freestyle and 10th in the
200 free at NCAAs last year, broke
her left wrist in mid-January and
missed four weeks, coming back for
the Cal dual meet Feb. 13th. She is
only 2.26 seconds off the qualifying
time in the 500 and 1.8 seconds off

in the 200, but said "the 500 is my
best chance."
Gillespie, who has spent the whole
season with sore shoulders, missed
qualifying in the 200 free by a scant
.16 seconds at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships last weekend. She
swims that event today. She placed
10th in the 200 and 11th in the 1650
free at NCAAs last year.
"It was discouraging at first (being
so close at Pac-10s)," Gillespie said.
"I wouldn't say I was ready to quit,
though. I was looking forward to this
weekend."
Larson, who just missed qualifying
last year, will try to take five seconds
off her time in the 200 butterfly, a
vepr difficult, but possible task. All
this could present quite a problem for
Stanford Coach George Haines, who
may be forced to chose between two
or three people for the last spot on
the traveling squad.
"We're both pretty nervous," An-

derson said, speaking about her
self and Gillespie. "We both know
there's only one spot. I'm just
going to worry about qualifying
myself; that's all I can do."
Gillespie agreed. "I'm just going
to swim to make the cut," she
said. "Whatever happens, hap
pens."
As Anderson has qualified both
of her previous years here, and
Gillespie qualified as a freshman
last year, something, somewhere
is going to have to give. The ad

vantages for Stanford, however,
are that this competition will
serve to strengthen the team sent
to NCAAs and that both swim
mers are at almost full strength.
"[My shoulders] are a lot better
than they were before," Gillespie
said. "I think I can go two more
weeks on them. ... I just need to
get myself to NCAAs; I'll be all
right after that."
Anderson summed up both
swimmers' views. "I still can't see
myself not going (to NCAAs)," she
said. "I'm starting to realize it's
not going to be the end of the
world if I don't go — I just can't
fathom the possibility."
