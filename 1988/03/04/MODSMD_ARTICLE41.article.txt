# Cardinal rowers wake up for '88
## 
### Don Hogue 
Early tomorrow
morning, the
men's and wom
en's crew teams
will battle UC-
Davis and UC-
Santa Barbara

in the 1988 crew season opener
at the Stanford Boathouse in
Redwood City.
The race, to commence at 8
a.m., covers 2.5 miles of open
water in San Francisco Bay,
twice the distance of the 2,000-
meter regular-season regattas,
which Stanford usually hosts
at Redwood Shores.
"We've been practicing since
October 1, and we're ready to
race," Stanford Men's Coach
Ken Dreyfuss said, reflecting
the eagerness of his crew to
face the upcoming season. How
ever, Women's Coach John
Davis was cautiously optimistic
about the women's perform
ance this season.
"It's too early to tell," Davis
said. "After tomorrow, we've
got four weeks until our next
race at the San Diego Crew
Classic on April 2."
Davis plans to rest his crew
early this season, noting that
last year's team began to
fatigue by the end of the season.
Both the men's and women's
crew teams, however, have en
dured over five months of prac
tice, including many 6 a.m.
workouts on San Francisco Bay
and countless strokes on unfor
giving ergometers. Many of the
varsity oarsmen are looking for
ward to another season of com
petition while the frosh-novice
crews are excited for a chance
to compete against other crews.

"I think everyone's really
psyched to get into the racing
season," novice sophomore
Sonia Nagy said. "It's time to
show what we've been working
for."
Stanford will face an ex
tremely tough schedule this
year, pitting the women against
defending national champion
Washington, 1986 national
champion Wisconsin, cross-Bay
rival California and several
tough crews from the East.
The men will compete against
an equally strong field, includ
ing defending Pacific 10 Con
ference champion UCLA,
Washington, Penn, Harvard
and Brown.
The men's varsity returns
1987 All Pac-10 coxswain Doug
Wilner, as well as Craig Bouck
(captain), Jim Fox, Bart Nic
hols, Bob Creasy, Scott South
wick, Tyler Simonton, Leo
Ramos and Jason Stinson. Plus,
several members of last year's
Pac-10 champion frosh boat are
poised to assume a position in
the first varsity boat.
The women will field a young,
but talented first varsity boat
with Quentin Story at
coxswain, Diana Olson at stroke
and Eli Holmes at bow. Also
rowing will be Kristin Dahl,
Christie May, Tina Simpson,
Laura Stearns, Amy Berner and
Becky Schroeder.
Stanford will continue to
train through spring break, re
turning to competition April 2
at the San Diego Crew Classic
at Mission Bay. Stanford will
host the Redwood Shores-
Stanford Rowing Classic April
16-17, featuring 14 of the na
tion's top crews in a Henley
style regatta.
