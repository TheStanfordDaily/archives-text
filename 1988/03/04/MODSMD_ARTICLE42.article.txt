# Dukes is putting her shot toward Olympics
## 
### Andrea Kohn 
Placing her thumb and first finger a
quarter of an inch apart, Olympic con
tender Pam Dukes said, "I felt about that
small when I got here."
It is hard to imagine a woman who stands
6 feet and weighs 190 pounds feeling no
bigger than a mouse. Dukes, ranked third
nationally in the shot-put for the 1987 and
1988 seasons by Track and Field News, is
an incredibly powerful woman.
However, she was plagued by self-doubt
upon her arrival here at Stanford. That
attitude was the norm during the first two
of her five years here.
Laughing, Dukes said she first attempted
the shot-put to appease her high school
track coach. A softball standout at the
time, she said, "He just kept bugging me
until finally I just picked it (the shot-put)
up and threw it."
Even after Stanford track coach Brooks
Johnson recruited her, she did not take
track seriously and was notoriously lazy.
"It was a social gathering," said throwing
Coach Dave Wollman. "At practice, the
first thing she would ask was how many
throws do I have to do today. If I said

more than 20, it was like the end of the
world. It was frustrating because she did
have all that talent."
During those first two years, Dukes set
a freshman record in the shot-put and put
at least 10 pounds on an already large
frame. She weighed 215 pounds prior to
her freshman year. The weight she gained
had little to do with muscle.
Dukes ate "a lot of chocolate" in order
to cope with her anxieties. She admits to
several times devouring a whole cake in
one sitting, and virtually living on Snickers
bars and Pepsi.
Between her sophomore and junior years,
something clicked. Dukes lost 30 pounds
and returned to Stanford ready to compete
seriously. Even Dukes could not explain
the change.
"Somewhere in there the lazy Pam was
replaced by a more proud-of-herself Pam,"
said Wollman.
Dukes became an Ail-American each of
the next three years and won the NCAA
indoor title in the shot-put in 1987. She
also garnered All-American honors in the
discus in 1986.
What is Dukes doing in 1988?
No longer a student, she is a grad
uate assistant in the Varsity
weight room. Her job is tailored
to meet her training needs. She
works with athletes for four to
five hours in the morning and
practices with the track team in
Stanford Stadium in the after
noon.
She is training here to qualify
for the U. S. Olympic Team,
having already qualified for the
competition in July that deter
mines who will represent the
United States in Seoul, South
Korea.
"Success is written all over
her," Wollman asserted. "Her
chances (of making the Olympics)
are outstanding. That means in
the 90-percent bracket."
The only thing between Dukes
and the Olympics is her self
confidence. That is her biggest
weakness, Wollman stressed.
It is not so much her physical
abilities that concern her, but her
social life. "As her social life goes,
so goes Pain," said weight trainer
and close friend Kermit Washing
ton.
Teammate Erica Wheeler said
that Dukes does well when she is
emotionally happy, but when her
social life goes awry she tends to
get depressed and distracted.
Dukes' problems stem from
men and dating. One of her mis
takes, Washington said, is that
she tends to go after the same
type of man that hurt her before.

Her personality and strength
put her in a position to meet
people, but according to Washing
ton, they become intimidated.
"Men don't like powerful women
because men like control," he said.
No petite model, Dukes is an
intimidating figure. She often
jokes about her size. Said Woll
man, "I think she is conscious of
the social stigma around big
people. Pam jokes about it, but
in her own mind, she knows she
is attractive."
"I want to try not to get in
volved with anyone until after the
Olympics because it takes a lot
out of me," Dukes said. "But if
Michael Jordan does call me, I'll
make an exception."
Dukes' friendly, outgoing man
ner, belying whatever inner
doubts she might have, usually
puts people at ease.
"She is the most social and well
liked of my throwers," Wollman
claimed. "She has everybody
wrapped around her finger."
In high school she was voted
class clown. "That was very im
portant to me. I was so excited.
I like to make people laugh."
Dukes' enthusiasm is infec
tious. As Wheeler aptly stated,
"When Pam gets excited,
everybody does."
Despite her problems, Dukes
seems to have largely put behind
her the self-doubt that haunted
her early years here. She has come
a long way.
"Last year at the U.S. cham
pionships Pam made the biggest
step in the five years I've been
working with her," Wollman said.

Laughing, Dukes said she first attempted
the shot-put to appease her high school
track coach. A softball standout at the
time, she said, "He just kept bugging me
until finally I just picked it (the shot-put)
up and threw it."
Even after Stanford track coach Brooks
Johnson recruited her, she did not take
track seriously and was notoriously lazy.
"It was a social gathering," said throwing
Coach Dave Wollman. "At practice, the
first thing she would ask was how many
throws do I have to do today. If I said

more than 20, it was like the end of the
world. It was frustrating because she did
have all that talent."
During those first two years, Dukes set
a freshman record in the shot-put and put
at least 10 pounds on an already large
frame. She weighed 215 pounds prior to
her freshman year. The weight she gained
had little to do with muscle.
Dukes ate "a lot of chocolate" in order
to cope with her anxieties. She admits to
several times devouring a whole cake in
one sitting, and virtually living on Snickers
bars and Pepsi.
Between her sophomore and junior years,
something clicked. Dukes lost 30 pounds
and returned to Stanford ready to compete
seriously. Even Dukes could not explain
the change.
"Somewhere in there the lazy Pam was
replaced by a more proud-of-herself Pam,"
said Wollman.
Dukes became an Ail-American each of
the next three years and won the NCAA
indoor title in the shot-put in 1987. She
also garnered All-American honors in the
discus in 1986.
What is Dukes doing in 1988?
No longer a student, she is a grad
uate assistant in the Varsity
weight room. Her job is tailored
to meet her training needs. She
works with athletes for four to
five hours in the morning and
practices with the track team in
Stanford Stadium in the after
noon.
She is training here to qualify
for the U. S. Olympic Team,
having already qualified for the
competition in July that deter
mines who will represent the
United States in Seoul, South
Korea.
"Success is written all over
her," Wollman asserted. "Her
chances (of making the Olympics)
are outstanding. That means in
the 90-percent bracket."
The only thing between Dukes
and the Olympics is her self
confidence. That is her biggest
weakness, Wollman stressed.
It is not so much her physical
abilities that concern her, but her
social life. "As her social life goes,
so goes Pain," said weight trainer
and close friend Kermit Washing
ton.
Teammate Erica Wheeler said
that Dukes does well when she is
emotionally happy, but when her
social life goes awry she tends to
get depressed and distracted.
Dukes' problems stem from
men and dating. One of her mis
takes, Washington said, is that
she tends to go after the same
type of man that hurt her before.

Her personality and strength
put her in a position to meet
people, but according to Washing
ton, they become intimidated.
"Men don't like powerful women
because men like control," he said.
No petite model, Dukes is an
intimidating figure. She often
jokes about her size. Said Woll
man, "I think she is conscious of
the social stigma around big
people. Pam jokes about it, but
in her own mind, she knows she
is attractive."
"I want to try not to get in
volved with anyone until after the
Olympics because it takes a lot
out of me," Dukes said. "But if
Michael Jordan does call me, I'll
make an exception."
Dukes' friendly, outgoing man
ner, belying whatever inner
doubts she might have, usually
puts people at ease.
"She is the most social and well
liked of my throwers," Wollman
claimed. "She has everybody
wrapped around her finger."
In high school she was voted
class clown. "That was very im
portant to me. I was so excited.
I like to make people laugh."
Dukes' enthusiasm is infec
tious. As Wheeler aptly stated,
"When Pam gets excited,
everybody does."
Despite her problems, Dukes
seems to have largely put behind
her the self-doubt that haunted
her early years here. She has come
a long way.
"Last year at the U.S. cham
pionships Pam made the biggest
step in the five years I've been
working with her," Wollman said.

Pam Dukes was a three-time All-American at Stanford.
Placing her thumb and first finger a
quarter of an inch apart, Olympic con
tender Pam Dukes said, "I felt about that
small when I got here."
It is hard to imagine a woman who stands
6 feet and weighs 190 pounds feeling no
bigger than a mouse. Dukes, ranked third
nationally in the shot-put for the 1987 and
1988 seasons by Track and Field News, is
an incredibly powerful woman.
However, she was plagued by self-doubt
upon her arrival here at Stanford. That
attitude was the norm during the first two
of her five years here.
