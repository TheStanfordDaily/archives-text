# Dukes is putting her shot toward Olympics

Placing her thumb and first finger a
quarter of an inch apart, Olympic con
tender Pam Dukes said, "I felt about that
small when I got here."
It is hard to imagine a woman who stands
6 feet and weighs 190 pounds feeling no
bigger than a mouse. Dukes, ranked third
nationally in the shot-put for the 1987 and
1988 seasons by Track and Field News, is
an incredibly powerful woman.
However, she was plagued by self-doubt
upon her arrival here at Stanford. That
attitude was the norm during the first two
of her five years here.
Laughing, Dukes said she first attempted
the shot-put to appease her high school
track coach. A softball standout at the
time, she said, "He just kept bugging me
until finally I just picked it (the shot-put)
up and threw it."
Even after Stanford track coach Brooks
Johnson recruited her, she did not take
track seriously and was notoriously lazy.
"It was a social gathering," said throwing
Coach Dave Wollman. "At practice, the
first thing she would ask was how many
throws do I have to do today. If I said

more than 20, it was like the end of the
world. It was frustrating because she did
have all that talent."
During those first two years, Dukes set
a freshman record in the shot-put and put
at least 10 pounds on an already large
frame. She weighed 215 pounds prior to
her freshman year. The weight she gained
had little to do with muscle.
Dukes ate "a lot of chocolate" in order
to cope with her anxieties. She admits to
several times devouring a whole cake in
one sitting, and virtually living on Snickers
bars and Pepsi.
Between her sophomore and junior years,
something clicked. Dukes lost 30 pounds
and returned to Stanford ready to compete
seriously. Even Dukes could not explain
the change.
"Somewhere in there the lazy Pam was
replaced by a more proud-of-herself Pam,"
said Wollman.
Dukes became an Ail-American each of
the next three years and won the NCAA
indoor title in the shot-put in 1987. She
also garnered All-American honors in the
discus in 1986.
