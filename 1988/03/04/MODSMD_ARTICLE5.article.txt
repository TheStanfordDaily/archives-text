About a third of the Law
School's students have endorsed
a letter urging President Reagan
to sign into law a hill offering an
official apology and monetary
compensation to Japanese
Americans held in internment
camps during World War 11.
The letter, drafted by first-year
law student Ed Sasaki, states that
the bill — which is awaiting Sen
ate approval — "is a matter of
long-overdue justice for the
120,000 Japanese Americans im
prisoned for three years during
World War II."
"By acknowledging the injustice
that Japanese Americans were
made to suffer, we can strengthen
those constitutional principles
which our people have long
cherished but which our nation
has often forgotten," the letter
states.
The bill, the Civil Liberties Act

of 1987, proposes an official gov
ernment apology for the intern
ment, a payment of $20,000 to
all surviving former internees and
the establishment of a $50 million
educational fund aimed at pre
venting any similar internments
in the future.
Sasaki said he decided to draft
the letter two weeks ago, after
seeing a similar letter being cir
culated by the Nihonmachi Out
reach Committee, a San Jose
based group pushing for passage
of the bill.
After receiving enthusiastic
support for the letter from his
dormmates, he brought his idea
to the Asian Students Asso
ciation and other Law School
groups, which were also support
ive.
The letter's circulation
widened, and soon 147 of 508 law
students had signed and returned
