# Law students' letter urges U.S. apology
## Amends to Japanese-Americans 
### Dusan Djordjevich 
About a third of the Law
School's students have endorsed
a letter urging President Reagan
to sign into law a hill offering an
official apology and monetary
compensation to Japanese
Americans held in internment
camps during World War 11.
The letter, drafted by first-year
law student Ed Sasaki, states that
the bill — which is awaiting Sen
ate approval — "is a matter of
long-overdue justice for the
120,000 Japanese Americans im
prisoned for three years during
World War II."
"By acknowledging the injustice
that Japanese Americans were
made to suffer, we can strengthen
those constitutional principles
which our people have long
cherished but which our nation
has often forgotten," the letter
states.
The bill, the Civil Liberties Act

of 1987, proposes an official gov
ernment apology for the intern
ment, a payment of $20,000 to
all surviving former internees and
the establishment of a $50 million
educational fund aimed at pre
venting any similar internments
in the future.
Sasaki said he decided to draft
the letter two weeks ago, after
seeing a similar letter being cir
culated by the Nihonmachi Out
reach Committee, a San Jose
based group pushing for passage
of the bill.
After receiving enthusiastic
support for the letter from his
dormmates, he brought his idea
to the Asian Students Asso
ciation and other Law School
groups, which were also support
ive.
The letter's circulation
widened, and soon 147 of 508 law
students had signed and returned
the letter to Sasaki. In addition,
according to Sasaki, others have
forwarded the letter to the White
House on their own.
"So far the support has been
really overwhelming," Sasaki
said. "I'm hoping to become more
systematic in circulating the letter
and to do more on the faculty and
undergraduate levels."
He said he has received support
from both the Asian-American
Student Association and from
MEChA, a Chicano student group,
both of whose memberships are
largely undergraduate.
Sasaki said he encountered op
position to the letter from only
four or five students. Objections,
he said, usually focus on the pro
posed compensation of $20,000.
But, according to Sasaki, govern
ment studies show that this
amount is actually "vastly under
compensatory."
"The primary part of the bill
is not that money anyway, but

the public recognition and the ed
ucation program," he said.
The House passed the bill on
September 17, 1987 by a vote of
243-141, and it appears to have
enough support to win approval
in the Senate. However, Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has threat
ened a filibuster to prevent the
bill's passage.
Even if the measure gains Sen
ate approval, supporters fear that
Reagan — who has expressed
reservations about the need for
an "official" apology as well as
the $20,000 figure — will veto it.
A representative from the
White House media relations of
fice declined to comment on the
administration's position until
the Senate vote takes place.
Although Sasaki is unsure of
what effect the % letter will have
on the president's decision, he
said he feels the increase in com
munity awareness it prompts is
as important as the letter's po
tential to influence legislation.
He and other association mem
bers have organized events to pro
vide additional information about
the forced relocation.
