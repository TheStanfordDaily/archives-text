## Washington lobbyist attacks selective disinvestment 
### Leslie Saul Staff writer 
A leading representative for the
U.S. anti-apartheid movement
last night criticized the Universi
ty's selective disinvestment policy
and urged students to organize to
change the policy.
There is "no moral justification
for investment in any company
doing business with a racist
regime," said Damu Smith, exec
utive director of the Washington
Office on Africa, a church and
trade union-sponsored research
and lobbying organization that
focuses on southern African is
sues.
Smith told a History Corner au
dience of over 100 that "doing
business in South Africa helps to
buttress the economy which rein
forces the system of apartheid."
According to Smith, companies
that say they remain in South
Africa in order to maintain
leverage and to persuade the gov
ernment to change its apartheid
policies have done nothing to stop

the "lynching" or
the poverty of
blacks.
"We must fight
for divestment on
every college in
this country. ... I
beg you, I appeal
to you to organize,
get involved, to not
allow the trustees

to go by without your voices being
heard on this issue," he said. "We
are dealing with the genocide of
an entire people."
Smith said he favors compre
hensive economic sanctions
against South Africa because they
"will apply extreme economic
pressure on those reaping the
most benefit from the economy
— white South Africans."
He said the United States
should also assist countries bor
dering South Africa that are suf
fering from economic, political
and military domination by South
Africa's apartheid government.
In addition, Smith said he
wants to stop the United States

from sending funds to a guerilla
group he called UNITA.
According to Smith, UNITA is
funded by both the South African
and U.S. governments in order to
overthrow the socialist govern
ment of Angola. He claimed that
Senators Robert Dole, R-Kan.,
and Jesse Helms, R-N.C., among
others, are pushing for more
covert aid to the UNITA rebels,
who have engaged in terrorist ac
tivities resulting in the maiming
and deaths of scores of Angolan
children.
Smith also urged that the
liberation of the people of South
Africa should be "a key issue in
the upcoming presidential cam
paign."
According to graduate student
Mia Lewis, one of the organizers
of last night's program, student
activity in opposition to apartheid
has decreased this year because
the press ban in South Africa has
kept students from learning about
the situation. Lewis said the sit
uation there is "getting worse and
worse."
