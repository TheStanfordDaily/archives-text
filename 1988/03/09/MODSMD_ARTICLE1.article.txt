# Nurses' union issues strike ultimatum
## 
### John Pollack Senior staff writer 
The nurses' union at Stanford
Hospital voted overwhelmingly last
night to go on strike if negotiators
cannot reach a contract settlement by
March 18.
The vote was 1,074 in favor of a
strike and 51 against, according to
Donalda Dunnet, a press representa
tive for the Committee for Recognition
of Nursing Achievement.
The nurses' contract expired Feb.
29, and last Friday members of the
1,300-member union rejected a tenta
tive two-year contract agreement
worked out by hospital and CRONA
negotiators.
CRONA issued a 10-day strike warn
ing Monday notifying the hospital that
it might call a strike. A 10-day strike
notice is required by federal law if the
nurses' strike is to be considered legal.
Paul Supton, CRONA's attorney,
said the nurses had no alternative.
"They have no choice but to strike,"
Supton said, adding that the nurses
are "angry [and] overworked."
No meetings are currently scheduled
between CRONA and hospital negoti

ators.
Anticipating a possible strike, the
hospital last week stopped admitting
long-term patients and is preparing to
relocate remaining patients at other
local hospitals if necessary, according
to chief hospital negotiator Priscilla
Wheeler.

Wheeler said that in the event of a
prolonged strike, the hospital might
be forced to hire new nurses to staff
the 663-bed facility.
"The hospital will stay open,"
Wheeler said.
It is unclear at this point whether
or not a settlement will be reached
before March 18, and various hospital
officials not involved in negotiations
were unwilling to speculate on the
matter.
Dunnet said CRONA hopes a strike
will not be necessary.
Recently, critics of CRONA have
charged that the nurses, in threaten
ing to strike, are holding patients
hostage to their demands and putting

the hospital in a bad bargaining posi
tion.
But CRONA President Myra Lang
said the nurses do want to give
patients the best care possible. She
said, however, that this is difficult un
der current working conditions, adding
that gains made through negotiations
will ultimately help patients. "We're
not holding patients hostage," Lang
said.
The tentative agreement rejected
Friday featured a 5-percent annual pay
increase for all nurses in 1988 and
1989, as well as an additional 4.5-
percent pay increase for the hospital's
most senior nurses.
Dunnet said this contract proposal
was unacceptable to CRONA members
because the general pay increase was
not large enough to compensate for
other issues not addressed in the
settlement.
These issues include:
• pay rates for nurses who are "on
call;"
• Hospital subsidies of nurses' con
tinuing education;
• required overtime; and
• additional pay for experienced nurses

who give new nurses on-the-job train
ing.
Dunnet said CRONA originally put
these issues on the bargaining table
but that the hospital "refused to ad
dress them."
According to Wheeler, however, all
of these issues were either resolved or
dropped from consideration early in
the negotiating process.
In 1986, when the hospital suffered
a $25-million budget cut, CRONA
members accepted a pay cut for "on
call" nurses. Nurses who are on call
are paid to remain available while off
duty to come in to work on short
notice. Now, CRONA is demanding
that compensation for nurseg on call
be restored to pre-1986 levels.
In addition, Dunnet said hospital
subsidies for mandatory continuing ed
ucation classes for nurses have been
reduced to an unacceptable level.
Federal law requires that nurses take
30 hours of such coursework every
two years to keep their nursing
licenses.
But Wheeler cited a recent hospital
study that claims most nurses do not
use all of the $500 made available to
them for such courses.

but that the hospital "refused to ad
dress them."
According to Wheeler, however, all
of these issues were either resolved or
dropped from consideration early in
the negotiating process.
In 1986, when the hospital suffered
a $25-million budget cut, CRONA
members accepted a pay cut for "on
call" nurses. Nurses who are on call
are paid to remain available while off
duty to come in to work on short
notice. Now, CRONA is demanding
that compensation for nurseg on call
be restored to pre-1986 levels.
In addition, Dunnet said hospital
subsidies for mandatory continuing ed
ucation classes for nurses have been
reduced to an unacceptable level.
Federal law requires that nurses take
30 hours of such coursework every
two years to keep their nursing
licenses.
But Wheeler cited a recent hospital
study that claims most nurses do not
use all of the $500 made available to
them for such courses.
