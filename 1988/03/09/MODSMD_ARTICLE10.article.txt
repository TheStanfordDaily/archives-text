# New election guide draws flak
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
A plan by three students to
publish what they call an objective
informational guide to the ASSU
spring elections has drawn fire
from progressive student groups
who claim the guide will represent
a biased student opinion under
the guise of objectivity.
The three students, Council of
Presidents member Jim Durkin,
ASSU senator Chris Adamson and
COP intern Cindy Wurtenberg,
last week formed the Student
Election Review for Voter Educa
tion to keep the election from
being a war of advertising fliers
by offering election information

without recommending how stu
dents should vote.
SERVE will seek to question
each person running for office and
representatives of those groups
with student funding requests on
the ballot, and will then print cap
sulized versions of their answers
to preselected questions in the
SERVE guide.
In addition to printing the in
terview responses, the guide will
list the results of a "mini-election"
in which SERVE members will
vote yes or no on each fee request,
select 10 senate candidates and
choose one slate each for the COP,
the senior class presidents and
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council.

"We want to seek out [can
didates] who will work for the
benefit of the students, not for
the benefit of themselves," Adam
son, a junior, said.
In order to help ensure that
the guide is as non-partisan as
possible, SERVE is looking for
seven additional board members
with limited ties to campus
groups, Durkin said. According to
a flier accompanying the applica
tion form for new board members,
applicants "must not be a member
of any group seeking a special fee,
endorsing candidates, slates or
special fees, or a candidate for an
elected office."
Student progressive groups
have criticized SERVE's criteria
for selecting board members.
"They have effectively locked
out all members of ethnic minor
ity groups," said senior Stacey
Leyton, who is an ASSU senator
and a member of Students United
for a Democratic Education.
"A 'mini-election' and the
criteria for selecting board mem
bers bothers me," Leyton said.
Senior Lucky Gutierrez, an
ASSU senator and a member of
MEChA, a Chicano-Latino stu
dent organization, expressed
similar feelings, calling the selec
tion criteria "not acceptable."
"It removes all affiliated people,
eliminating a significant portion
of the campus," he said. "My hope
is that people don't get fooled by
their screen of objectivity."
Both SUDE and MEChA are
part of the People's Platform, a
political coalition of ethnic minor
ity and progressive groups that
has nominated a set of ASSU can

didates.
Adamson and Durkin said they
formed SERVE because they were
dissatisfied with past elections.
"Last year's election turned
into a war of fliers, and the can
didate who had his name in the
biggest print tended to win,"
Adamson said.
Durkin, a senior, admitted that
his COP slate "won because of
advertising."
"We want to take away from
(the influence of) name recogni
tion and get people to focus on
issues," he said.

'They have effectively
locked out all mem
bers of ethnic minor
ity groups.'

Gutierrez said he questions
SERVE's motives. He speculated
the project might be a hostile re
action to the People's Platform
nominations, which were an
nounced last week.
