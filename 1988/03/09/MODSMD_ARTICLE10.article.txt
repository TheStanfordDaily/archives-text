# New election guide draws flak
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
A plan by three students to
publish what they call an objective
informational guide to the ASSU
spring elections has drawn fire
from progressive student groups
who claim the guide will represent
a biased student opinion under
the guise of objectivity.
The three students, Council of
Presidents member Jim Durkin,
ASSU senator Chris Adamson and
COP intern Cindy Wurtenberg,
last week formed the Student
Election Review for Voter Educa
tion to keep the election from
being a war of advertising fliers
by offering election information

without recommending how stu
dents should vote.
SERVE will seek to question
each person running for office and
representatives of those groups
with student funding requests on
the ballot, and will then print cap
sulized versions of their answers
to preselected questions in the
SERVE guide.
In addition to printing the in
terview responses, the guide will
list the results of a "mini-election"
in which SERVE members will
vote yes or no on each fee request,
select 10 senate candidates and
choose one slate each for the COP,
the senior class presidents and
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council.

"We want to seek out [can
didates] who will work for the
benefit of the students, not for
the benefit of themselves," Adam
son, a junior, said.
In order to help ensure that
the guide is as non-partisan as
possible, SERVE is looking for
seven additional board members
with limited ties to campus
groups, Durkin said. According to
a flier accompanying the applica
tion form for new board members,
applicants "must not be a member
of any group seeking a special fee,
endorsing candidates, slates or
special fees, or a candidate for an
elected office."
