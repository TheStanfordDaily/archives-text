# Former Stanford mascot dies
## 'Prince Lightfoot' hoped to return as school symbol 
### Leslie Saul Staff writer 
Former Stanford Indian mas
cot Harry Delmar Williams, who
hoped one day to return and
dance at a football halftime
show, died in a car accident Sun
day at the age of 64.
Williams, who was known as
"Prince Lightfoot" to genera
tions of Stanford fans, was
driving through an uncontrolled
intersection in Cresent City
when his car was struck on the
right side by a sedan, according
to California Highway Patrol
Officer Johnny Jones. The exact
cause of the accident is still un
der investigation.
Williams died before he ar
rived at Sutter Coast Hospital,
according to Nadine Johns, a
nursing supervisor, who cited
the cause of death as "blunt
trauma."
A Yurok Indian, Williams
served as Stanford's unofficial
mascot for 21 years until then
University President Richard
Lyman and the Stanford Stu
dent Senate decided to drop the
Indian symbol in 1972 because
of protests by Native American
students, who called the nick
name "demeaning."
But Williams always main
tained that his portrayal of the
Stanford Indian was not
derogatory. Williams, who was
outspoken on Native American
issues, saw his position as a
"great boost to the Indian
people," according to Jack Lin
dow, a Stanford alumnus and
close friend of Williams.
Lindow said Williams used his
prominence as the Stanford
mascot to bring recognition to
Native Americans. He added
that Williams inspired Stanford
football teams to do their best.
By invoking Native Americans'
struggle to survive in America,
Lindow said Williams hoped to
encourage players to "reach in
side ... to overcome obstacles."
Some time after the Univer
sity decided to change the school
nickname, Williams was quoted
as saying, "I thought it was
wrong for them to make a de
cision about my position as an
Indian or a person without even

asking me."
Outside of the stadium, Wil
liams served as chair of the Cal
ifornia Rural Indian Health
Board, consultant to the U.S.
Department of Interior-Indian
Affairs and vice chair of the Na
tional Indian Health Board. He
was also appointed director of
the California Indian Assistance
Project by then California Gov.
Ronald Reagan.
In addition, Williams ap
peared several times before
Congress to represent Native
American concerns.
The decision to drop the In
dian as the Stanford mascot an
gered many students, who tried

to recall the decision with two
unsuccessful referendum votes
in that year.
The University has firmly
retained its decision to remain
the Cardinal.
Having no formal affiliation
with the University, Williams
first agreed to perform at the
Big Game rally in 1951 in ex
change for two Big Game tick
ets.
Williams made his last official
appearance as the Indian at the
1972 Rose Bowl, where he was
carried off the field after quar
terback Jim Plunkett and the
Stanford Indians defeated the
Michigan Wolverines.
