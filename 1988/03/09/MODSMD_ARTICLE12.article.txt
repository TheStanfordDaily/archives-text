# Pub Board may shuffle Storke
## 
### Eric Rosenfeld Staff writer 
In an attempt to satisfy the space needs of a
growing number of student publications, ASSU Pub
lications Board officials are adding new computer
equipment and reorganizing office space in the
Storke Student Publications Building, touching off
a minor fracas within the Stanford student pub
lishing community in the process.
The Pub Board plans to renovate the Publications
Work Room, which is used by members of several
different student publications. The work room
would be equipped with a new computer terminal,
a laser printer, an expanded working area, filing
cabinets, lockers and a dark room. Workers have
already begun to remove five years of garbage from
the area.
The renovation is being spearheaded by Director
of the ASSU Publishing Board Keith Seinfeld, a
senior, and his brother Jeff, a sophomore, who
serves as his assistant.
Though still in its nascent stage, the plan has
already provoked anxiety from students affiliated
with existing publications housed in Storke. The
students feel pressed for space and fear changes
would cut into their office space.
The Daily, The Stanford Chaparral, the Quad
and Sequoia have the longest traditions of main
taining offices in Storke.
The Seinfelds have been working with Student
Organizations Services Director Michael Ramsey-
Perez to re-evaluate the use of the limited space
in Storke to best accommodate the record number
of student organizations who currently need access
to publishing facilities.
"The technical equipment, if we can find a way
to keep it secure, would be available for use by any
student organization," Ramsey-Perez said. He added
that he hopes to implement the project sometime
during spring quarter.
At a meeting last Friday, the Seinfelds broached
the idea of moving Sequoia, a semi-annual literary
magazine, downstairs into a new area to make way
for the expanded work room.
"I think upgrading the work room is a great
idea," said Sequoia Editor Marianne Burke, a first
year graduate student in English. "However, a lot
of these other publications may be around for a
year or two and then go under. We've always been
here and would like to stay where we are," Burke
said.
If Sequoia's offices are moved, the staff would
have to share facilities with at least two other
undergraduate magazines, according to the proposal.
"After meeting with us, I felt [the Seinfelds]
better understood our position and what kind of
publication we are," said first-year English graduate
student Annie Finch, next year's Sequoia editor. "I
think they realized that we really need to keep our
current space," she said.
Senior Jim Suhre, editor of The Chaparral, said
there is a lack of communication between the Uni
versity, the Publications Board and various student
publications.
"There's been no dialogue," he said. "The ASSU
should have informed all affected parties.
"The Publications Work Room is under the juris

diction of the Pub Board, but the SOS decides who
gets the keys," he added. "I think that's kind of
strange. I think it's time everyone got more respon
sible and acted correctly."
Composed of representatives from each student
periodical, a member of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents and an ASSU senator, the Pub Board has
ultimate authority over how space in Storke is
utilized.
Because of the resurgence of student publications
this year, the SOS has offered its services to help
the Pub Board ameliorate the space problem.
Ramsey-Perez pointed out that Stanford's student
publications have proliferated in numerous direc
tions, though some are on unstable ground. "The
SOS is in a position where it can share its expertise
and financial resources to help out," he added.
"I think it's very exciting that so many students
are becoming interested in writing again. This kind
of opportunity gives them a taste of what life is
like in the literary-oriented disciplines," Ramsey-
Perez said.
"Release," an arts and entertainment monthly,
is one of many new publications that would benefit
from an improved Publications Work Room. Editor
Susan Chung, a senior, said that currently "there
is only one desk and one phone in the room for us
to use; we are definitely short on space."
"Considering that there are over 60 people
working for Release, we have a difficult time keeping
in touch with everyone because we have no central
area," said senior Wendy Dick, publisher of Release.
Other publications seem to agree that changes
are in order. "It's an embarrassment to Stanford
that they don't have a computerized page-lay out
system on campus available to students," said Hugh
Bethell, editor of Reasonable Doubt, a new quarterly
political digest.
Bethell, a junior, said his publication has had to
rely on the use of private Macintoshes around
campus for editing purposes.
But for the more immediate problem of space,
Jeff Seinfeld said he is currently devising a system
to better allocate student publication office space.
"I'm looking at who needs office space, how much
and what kind. Then I'll be taking that information
and looking at the building (Storke) to try to see
how we can accommodate these groups," Jeff Sein
feld said.
However, "Some groups don't need office space,
while all groups need a work room," Keith Seinfeld
added.
Because the Pub Board is a self-governing group,
all relocation decisions will be made democratically,
he said.
"The Pub Board wants to encourage an increase
in the number of student publications, and we want
to help these groups be stable," Keith Seinfeld said.
"At our April meeting we hope we can reach an
agreement on better space utilization and sharing."
