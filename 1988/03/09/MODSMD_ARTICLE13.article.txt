# Davies case exposes tenure process to public scrutiny
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Although Stanford recently
won the legal battle waged by
former Visiting Prof. Norman
Davies against the University,
many leading historians agree
that the History Department mis
takenly denied tenure to a scholar
considered the world's leading
historian on Poland.

News analysis

The tortuous chronology of the
Davies case — open in court for
all to see — has afforded the Stan
ford community a unique oppor
tunity to examine the secretive,
often controversial nature of the
appointment process.
The history faculty's 12-11 vote
in 1986 denying Davies tenure,
and the events that followed, in
spired heated debate on campus
and ultimately led to Davies' filing
a $9 million lawsuit against Stan
ford.
Davies, in a telephone interview
from London, said his "initial pur
pose (for filing the lawsuit) was
to persuade Stanford to hold an
internal inquiry" into the con
fidential vote that rejected him.
Though Davies never received
the review hearing he sought from
Stanford, several University offi
cials and history professors have
been forced to re-examine in ex
traordinary detail the content of

the series of meetings leading to
the tenure vote.
Defenders of the closed tenure
process are deeply concerned with
the ramifications of the Davies
suit.
History Prof. Harold Kahn, a
Davies critic, has said he will not
comment on Davies' scholarship
for fear of reprisal in further
litigation. In a statement released
when the lawsuit was initially
filed, Kahn said, "It is profoundly
disturbing to see the legal process
used in a way that could tend to
intimidate scholars and prevent
them from exercising their pro
fessional judgement."
Davies charged that the History
Department decided not to ap
point him to the prestigious
Robert McDonnell Chair of East
ern European History because of
his political views, instead of "fair
and impartial" grounds. Accord
ing to Davies, the political con
troversy stemmed from claims by
Jewish members of the depart
ment that his work was insensi
tive to the plight of the Polish
Jewry during World War 11.
But Santa Clara County Supe
rior Court Judge James Stewart
dismissed the case last week,
ruling that the University did not
illegally discriminate against
Davies.
The McDonnell chair is still
open, and has been since History
Prof. Wayne Vucinich retired in
1978. History Chair James Shee
han said Monday the department

is currently reviewing other can
didates.
Davies, who has returned to his
position as a professor of Slavonic
Studies at the University of Lon
don, is considered by many
prominent colleagues to be the
pre-eminent Polish historian writ
ing in the English language.
According to Zbigniew Brzezin
ski, a naturalized Polish im
migrant and a policy expert on
Eastern Europe, Davies' two
works on Polish history are "prob
ably the most outstanding works
in English on Polish history in
terms of scope and content."
Brzezinski, who was President
Jimmy Carter's national security
adviser, referred to the books
"God's Playground: A History of
Poland" and "Heart of Europe: A
Short History of Poland."
Critics of "God's Playground,"
however, call it "uncritical," "ad
vocatory" or "non-explanatory" —
all terms which imply that the
work is unscholarly.
Other Davies supporters in
clude noted MIT political scientist
and linguist Noam Chomsky;
Aloysius Mazewski, president of
the Polish National Alliance of
the United States; Antony
Polonsky, prominent Jewish his
torian of Poland; and Israel
Shahak, chair of the Israeli
League for Human and Civil
Rights.
Although Davies' reputation ap
pears to contradict the History
Department's decision, it is diffi

cult to uncover reasons for his
rejection. Because of the veil of
secrecy obscuring faculty appoint
ments, the only way to recontruct
the events surrounding Davies'
rejection is to follow the trail of
paper left by players in the drama.
Davies first came to Stanford
in 1984 to interview for the
McDonnell chair. The McDonnell
Search Committee unanimously
recommended him for the position
upon reviewing his work and con
sulting 25 specialists in the field.
Sheehan then offered Davies a
position as visiting professor for
the 1985-86 academic year, which
he accepted. The visit was in
tended to be "a trial period . ..
for you to get to know Stanford
and for us to get to know you
better," Sheehan wrote.
Until January 1986, everything
seemed to indicate that Davies
would be chosen for the position.
But on Jan. 15, in a final vote,
the history faculty rejected
Davies. Explanations for the vote
vary, but observers agree it was
the closest, most acrimonious ten
ure decision of recent years.
Sheehan characterizes the de
cision as an honest appraisal of
Davies' total scholarship, but
Davies' court complaint quotes
History Prof. Lewis Spitz as call
ing the "Jewish issue" the reason
for the decision.
Shocked at the rejection, Davies
complained to the department
that he was notified of the unex
pected result in a "one minute

announcement" from History
Prof. Paul Robinson, then acting
chair of the department.
Davies initially sought to have
his case reconsidered internally by
the department — or failing that
— by the University. However,
he met with silence or rejection
from all purties, who cited the
importance of preserving the con
fidentiality and finality of tenure
votes.
Robinson wrote Davies that the
members of history faculty "all
share the conviction that we fol
lowed our normal procedures. ...
Hence I am forced to conclude
that you must abandon any ex

pectation that the department will
pursue your candidacy further."
Not to be shrugged off, Davies
tried all possible methods to
reverse the decision, focusing on
the substance of the confidential
meeting. By consulting with sym
pathetic faculty, Davies deter
mined that the department only
dealt with one controversial chap
ter on Polish Jews in "God's Play
ground."
Davies said he was outraged be
cause he "had never been inter
viewed ... had never been given
the chance to discuss his work as
a whole, to answer criticism, or
to address the department on con
troversial issues."
Though University Provost
James Rosse claimed that the fac
ulty did not focus solely on the
controversial chapter, Slavic
Studies Prof. Richard Schupbach
confirmed in a memo that all
criticisms at the meeting were in
fact "directed specifically at
[Davies' treatment of Polish-
Jewish relations]."
In a last desperate move, Davies
filed a lawsuit against History
Prof. Harold Kahn — a Davies
opponent — and 29 other Stan
ford professors.
This first case was dismissed
by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals on the grounds that
Davies' attorney, local former
Congressman Paul "Pete" Mc-
Closkey, could not obtain a deposi
tion from Kahn necessary to build
Davies' case.

torian of Poland; and Israel
Shahak, chair of the Israeli
League for Human and Civil
Rights.
Although Davies' reputation ap
pears to contradict the History
Department's decision, it is diffi

cult to uncover reasons for his
rejection. Because of the veil of
secrecy obscuring faculty appoint
ments, the only way to recontruct
the events surrounding Davies'
rejection is to follow the trail of
paper left by players in the drama.
Davies first came to Stanford
in 1984 to interview for the
McDonnell chair. The McDonnell
Search Committee unanimously
recommended him for the position
upon reviewing his work and con
sulting 25 specialists in the field.
Sheehan then offered Davies a
position as visiting professor for
the 1985-86 academic year, which
he accepted. The visit was in
tended to be "a trial period . ..
for you to get to know Stanford
and for us to get to know you
better," Sheehan wrote.
Until January 1986, everything
seemed to indicate that Davies
would be chosen for the position.
But on Jan. 15, in a final vote,
the history faculty rejected
Davies. Explanations for the vote
vary, but observers agree it was
the closest, most acrimonious ten
ure decision of recent years.
Sheehan characterizes the de
cision as an honest appraisal of
Davies' total scholarship, but
Davies' court complaint quotes
History Prof. Lewis Spitz as call
ing the "Jewish issue" the reason
for the decision.
Shocked at the rejection, Davies
complained to the department
that he was notified of the unex
pected result in a "one minute

announcement" from History
Prof. Paul Robinson, then acting
chair of the department.
Davies initially sought to have
his case reconsidered internally by
the department — or failing that
— by the University. However,
he met with silence or rejection
from all purties, who cited the
importance of preserving the con
fidentiality and finality of tenure
votes.
Robinson wrote Davies that the
members of history faculty "all
share the conviction that we fol
lowed our normal procedures. ...
Hence I am forced to conclude
that you must abandon any ex

pectation that the department will
pursue your candidacy further."
Not to be shrugged off, Davies
tried all possible methods to
reverse the decision, focusing on
the substance of the confidential
meeting. By consulting with sym
pathetic faculty, Davies deter
mined that the department only
dealt with one controversial chap
ter on Polish Jews in "God's Play
ground."
Davies said he was outraged be
cause he "had never been inter
viewed ... had never been given
the chance to discuss his work as
a whole, to answer criticism, or
to address the department on con
troversial issues."
Though University Provost
James Rosse claimed that the fac
ulty did not focus solely on the
controversial chapter, Slavic
Studies Prof. Richard Schupbach
confirmed in a memo that all
criticisms at the meeting were in
fact "directed specifically at
[Davies' treatment of Polish-
Jewish relations]."
In a last desperate move, Davies
filed a lawsuit against History
Prof. Harold Kahn — a Davies
opponent — and 29 other Stan
ford professors.
This first case was dismissed
by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals on the grounds that
Davies' attorney, local former
Congressman Paul "Pete" Mc-
Closkey, could not obtain a deposi
tion from Kahn necessary to build
Davies' case.


Norman Davies
Although Stanford recently
won the legal battle waged by
former Visiting Prof. Norman
Davies against the University,
many leading historians agree
that the History Department mis
takenly denied tenure to a scholar
considered the world's leading
historian on Poland.

News analysis

The tortuous chronology of the
Davies case — open in court for
all to see — has afforded the Stan
ford community a unique oppor
tunity to examine the secretive,
often controversial nature of the
appointment process.
The history faculty's 12-11 vote
in 1986 denying Davies tenure,
and the events that followed, in
spired heated debate on campus
and ultimately led to Davies' filing
a $9 million lawsuit against Stan
ford.
Davies, in a telephone interview
from London, said his "initial pur
pose (for filing the lawsuit) was
to persuade Stanford to hold an
internal inquiry" into the con
fidential vote that rejected him.
Though Davies never received
the review hearing he sought from
Stanford, several University offi
cials and history professors have
been forced to re-examine in ex
traordinary detail the content of

the series of meetings leading to
the tenure vote.
Defenders of the closed tenure
process are deeply concerned with
the ramifications of the Davies
suit.
History Prof. Harold Kahn, a
Davies critic, has said he will not
comment on Davies' scholarship
for fear of reprisal in further
litigation. In a statement released
when the lawsuit was initially
filed, Kahn said, "It is profoundly
disturbing to see the legal process
used in a way that could tend to
intimidate scholars and prevent
them from exercising their pro
fessional judgement."
Davies charged that the History
Department decided not to ap
point him to the prestigious
Robert McDonnell Chair of East
ern European History because of
his political views, instead of "fair
and impartial" grounds. Accord
ing to Davies, the political con
troversy stemmed from claims by
Jewish members of the depart
ment that his work was insensi
tive to the plight of the Polish
Jewry during World War 11.
But Santa Clara County Supe
rior Court Judge James Stewart
dismissed the case last week,
ruling that the University did not
illegally discriminate against
Davies.
The McDonnell chair is still
open, and has been since History
Prof. Wayne Vucinich retired in
1978. History Chair James Shee
han said Monday the department

is currently reviewing other can
didates.
Davies, who has returned to his
position as a professor of Slavonic
Studies at the University of Lon
don, is considered by many
prominent colleagues to be the
pre-eminent Polish historian writ
ing in the English language.
According to Zbigniew Brzezin
ski, a naturalized Polish im
migrant and a policy expert on
Eastern Europe, Davies' two
works on Polish history are "prob
ably the most outstanding works
in English on Polish history in
terms of scope and content."
Brzezinski, who was President
Jimmy Carter's national security
adviser, referred to the books
"God's Playground: A History of
Poland" and "Heart of Europe: A
Short History of Poland."
Critics of "God's Playground,"
however, call it "uncritical," "ad
vocatory" or "non-explanatory" —
all terms which imply that the
work is unscholarly.
Other Davies supporters in
clude noted MIT political scientist
and linguist Noam Chomsky;
Aloysius Mazewski, president of
the Polish National Alliance of
the United States; Antony
Polonsky, prominent Jewish his
