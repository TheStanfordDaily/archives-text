China OKs Iran arms embargo

WASHINGTON — China, which by official
U.S. estimates has sold more than $1 billion
worth of arms to Iran, yesterday gave Presi
dent Reagan a carefully qualified commitment
to the idea of an arms embargo against the
Tehran regime as a means of ending the Iran-
Iraq war, the White House announced.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater re
ported that Chinese Foreign Minister Wu
Xueqian (pronounced woo shway-chien) said
China would support a U.N. resolution calling
for a halt in arms sales to Iran "if the over
whelming majority of the Security Council
believes it should be adopted."
The White House spokesman termed Wu's
statement "a very positive sign, a very strong
expression of support." However, a Chinese
account of the White House meeting between
Reagan and Wu omitted any mention of an
arms embargo or the Persian Gulf, thus cas
ting some doubt on the significance and impact
of the White House announcement.
China, itself a permanent member of the
Security Council, had previously said it would
not veto a U.N. resolution calling for an arms
embargo against Iran. At the same time, how
ever, China has continued to serve as one of
Iran's principal sources of weapons.
U.S. intelligence officials have said that in
1987, China was Iran's leading arms supplier,
shipping approximately $600 million worth of
artillery, ammunition and Silkworm anti-ship
missies to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. The U.S. officials said China sent
Iran another $200 million in weapons in Jan
utu-y and had agreed to supply at least $400
million more later this year.
Rebels capture relief centers
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Rebels in
drought-stricken Tigray Province have cap
tured two government feeding centers and
made an unsuccessful assault on a third in
recent fighting that relief officials predict will
have a ruinous effect on the increasingly des
perate famine-relief effort here.
The rebels captured Wukro, a major feeding
center, on Friday, halting emergency food dis
tribution to more than 250,000 Tigrayans. In
Abiy Adi, an isolated mountain hamlet approx
imately 45 miles west of Mekele, the principal
landing and disbursal site for the United
Nations-coordinated food airlift in Tigray,
about 5,000 people lost access to emergency
food.
In Khartoum, Sudan, a Western diplomat
who is based in Addis Ababa said, "Essentially
what this means is that there is going be
catastrophic mass starvation starting almost
immediately," Washington Post correspondent
Blaine Harden reported.
The diplomat, who was in Wukro three
weeks ago, said that the Ethiopian government
had kept only five or six days worth of food
in the Wukro food distribution center, fearing
that the Tigrayan rebels would attack and
take the food.

Two hostages freed in Lebanon

BEIRUT,
Lebanon — A
British relief
worker and his
Lebanese assis
tant were freed
yesterday five
days after being
seized at a Pal
estinian refu
gee camp near

the southern Lebanese port of Sidon.
Peter Coleridge, a British national and the
Middle East co-ordinator of the Oxfam Charity
organization, and his Lebanese co-worker,
Omar Trabulsi, 31, were released unharmed
into the custody of a local Sunni Moslem leader,
Mustapha Maarouf Saad.
Coleridge and Trabulsi were abducted Thurs
day by Guerrillas of the A 1 Fatah Revolutionary
Council after the Briton was taking photo
graphs of the Ain El Helweh refugee camp, east
of Sidon.
Police sources said the spokesman of the radi
cal Palestinian group, Walid Khalid, handed
over Coleridge and Trabulsi to the Sunni leader
at his home in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
Iraqis attack Iranian vessel
BAGHDAD, Iraq — The war against ship
ping in the Persian Gulf flared again yesterday
after a monthlong lull that had given rise to
hope for a more lasting truce.
Iraq announced that its aircraft flying near
the Iranian coast scored a direct hit on a
"large naval target," the customary Iraqi term
for a tanker shuttling oil south from Iran's
Kharg Island terminal.
Iraq's last confirmed attack on an Iranian
ship in the gulf was Feb. 9, and the ensuing
lull led many observers to believe that Iraq
may have abandoned its effort to hinder Iran's
oil exports.
A Syrian official was quoted recently as
saying that Syria had persuaded Iran to halt
its attacks on Arab shipping in the Persian
Gulf. But at that time Iraqi aircraft were not
flying missions against Iranian ships.
Iraq has reported 23 attacks this year on
Iranian shipping, nine of which have been
confirmed by salvage companies in the gulf
region. The figure represents a decline in the
level of hostilities from the end of 1987.
Since last summer, the United States has
maintained a substantial naval force in the
gulf, in part to protect 11 Kuwaiti tankers
re-registered in the United States.

artillery, ammunition and Silkworm anti-ship
missies to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. The U.S. officials said China sent
Iran another $200 million in weapons in Jan
utu-y and had agreed to supply at least $400
million more later this year.
Rebels capture relief centers
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Rebels in
drought-stricken Tigray Province have cap
tured two government feeding centers and
made an unsuccessful assault on a third in
recent fighting that relief officials predict will
have a ruinous effect on the increasingly des
perate famine-relief effort here.
The rebels captured Wukro, a major feeding
center, on Friday, halting emergency food dis
tribution to more than 250,000 Tigrayans. In
Abiy Adi, an isolated mountain hamlet approx
imately 45 miles west of Mekele, the principal
landing and disbursal site for the United
Nations-coordinated food airlift in Tigray,
about 5,000 people lost access to emergency
food.
In Khartoum, Sudan, a Western diplomat
who is based in Addis Ababa said, "Essentially
what this means is that there is going be
catastrophic mass starvation starting almost
immediately," Washington Post correspondent
Blaine Harden reported.
The diplomat, who was in Wukro three
weeks ago, said that the Ethiopian government
had kept only five or six days worth of food
in the Wukro food distribution center, fearing
that the Tigrayan rebels would attack and
take the food.

Two hostages freed in Lebanon

BEIRUT,
Lebanon — A
British relief
worker and his
Lebanese assis
tant were freed
yesterday five
days after being
seized at a Pal
estinian refu
gee camp near

the southern Lebanese port of Sidon.
Peter Coleridge, a British national and the
Middle East co-ordinator of the Oxfam Charity
organization, and his Lebanese co-worker,
Omar Trabulsi, 31, were released unharmed
into the custody of a local Sunni Moslem leader,
Mustapha Maarouf Saad.
Coleridge and Trabulsi were abducted Thurs
day by Guerrillas of the A 1 Fatah Revolutionary
Council after the Briton was taking photo
graphs of the Ain El Helweh refugee camp, east
of Sidon.
Police sources said the spokesman of the radi
cal Palestinian group, Walid Khalid, handed
over Coleridge and Trabulsi to the Sunni leader
at his home in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
Iraqis attack Iranian vessel
BAGHDAD, Iraq — The war against ship
ping in the Persian Gulf flared again yesterday
after a monthlong lull that had given rise to
hope for a more lasting truce.
Iraq announced that its aircraft flying near
the Iranian coast scored a direct hit on a
"large naval target," the customary Iraqi term
for a tanker shuttling oil south from Iran's
Kharg Island terminal.
Iraq's last confirmed attack on an Iranian
ship in the gulf was Feb. 9, and the ensuing
lull led many observers to believe that Iraq
may have abandoned its effort to hinder Iran's
oil exports.
A Syrian official was quoted recently as
saying that Syria had persuaded Iran to halt
its attacks on Arab shipping in the Persian
Gulf. But at that time Iraqi aircraft were not
flying missions against Iranian ships.
Iraq has reported 23 attacks this year on
Iranian shipping, nine of which have been
confirmed by salvage companies in the gulf
region. The figure represents a decline in the
level of hostilities from the end of 1987.
Since last summer, the United States has
maintained a substantial naval force in the
gulf, in part to protect 11 Kuwaiti tankers
re-registered in the United States.

China OKs Iran arms embargo

WASHINGTON — China, which by official
U.S. estimates has sold more than $1 billion
worth of arms to Iran, yesterday gave Presi
dent Reagan a carefully qualified commitment
to the idea of an arms embargo against the
Tehran regime as a means of ending the Iran-
Iraq war, the White House announced.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater re
ported that Chinese Foreign Minister Wu
Xueqian (pronounced woo shway-chien) said
China would support a U.N. resolution calling
for a halt in arms sales to Iran "if the over
whelming majority of the Security Council
believes it should be adopted."
The White House spokesman termed Wu's
statement "a very positive sign, a very strong
expression of support." However, a Chinese
account of the White House meeting between
Reagan and Wu omitted any mention of an
arms embargo or the Persian Gulf, thus cas
ting some doubt on the significance and impact
of the White House announcement.
China, itself a permanent member of the
Security Council, had previously said it would
not veto a U.N. resolution calling for an arms
embargo against Iran. At the same time, how
ever, China has continued to serve as one of
Iran's principal sources of weapons.
U.S. intelligence officials have said that in
1987, China was Iran's leading arms supplier,
shipping approximately $600 million worth of
artillery, ammunition and Silkworm anti-ship
missies to the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. The U.S. officials said China sent
