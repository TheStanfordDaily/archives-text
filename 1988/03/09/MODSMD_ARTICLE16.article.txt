# Dukakis wins big, bolsters lead in race
## 
### 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Duka
kis won Florida, was running first in
Texas and piled up enough delegates
in other states in "Super Tuesday"
primaries to bolster his lead in the
contest for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, boosted by
black support, was contending with
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore in several
Deep South states, including Alabama
and North Carolina. Jackson won Vir
ginia, and Gore, the only white
Southerner in the race, captured his
home state and neighboring Kentucky.
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt,
the victor in last month's lowa
caucuses and generally considered to
be Dukakis' principal adversary,
turned in a dismal performance, win
ning only his own state and trailing
far behind in Texas and other states
he had once hoped to win.
Here are partial returns from five
of the 20 states in which Democratic
voters registered their choice for pres
ident in primaries and caucuses.
In delegate-rich Florida, with 28 per
cent of the precincts reporting, Duka
kis had 95,884, or 32 percent. Jackson
had 63,093, or 21 percent. Gore had
54,902, or 18 percent. Gephardt had
46,848, or 16 percent. Former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 9,808,
or 3 percent, and Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon had 6,126, or 2 percent.
In Kentucky, with 98 percent of the
precincts reporting, Gore had 142,173,
or 46 percent of the vote. Dukakis had
56,809, or 18 percent. Jackson had 47,
729, or 16 percent. Gephardt had
28,088, or 9 percent. Hart had 11,658,
or 4 percent, and Simon had 9,685,
or 3 percent.
In Virginia, with 68 percent of the
precincts reporting, Jackson had
114,579, or 47 percent. Gore had
54,922, or 22 percent. Dukakis had
47,749, or 20 percent. Gephardt had
9,528, or 4 percent. Hart had 4,356,
or 2 percent, and Simon had 4,247, 2
percent.
In North Carolina, with 64 percent
of the vote in, Gore had 147,676, or

35 percent. Jackson had 133,481, or
32 percent. Dukakis had 82,926, or 20
percent. Gephardt had 24,317, or 6
percent. Hart had 10,447, or 3 percent,
and Simon had 5,411, or 1 percent.
In Texas, the largest of the Super
Tuesday states, Dukakis had 47,789,
or 32 percent with 11 percent of the
precincts reporting. Gore had 31,938,
or 21 percent. Jackson had 30,086, or
20 percent. Gephardt had 24,666, or
16 percent. Hart had 8,476, or 6 per
cent, and Simon had 2,950, or 2 per
cent.
Dukakis' campaign supporters were
characteristically cautious about their
candidate's success, which had been
widely expected. In Illinois, where next
Tuesday's primary will mark the first
contest in a big Midwestern industrial
state, Charlie Baker, Dukakis' cam
paign manager in the state, declared:
"We don't expect to win here."
Dukakis will make a significant in
vestment of time and money in Illinois
— about $500,000 — said Baker, who
managed Dukakis' campaign victory
in the New Hampshire presidential
primary. But Baker contended that in
Illinois, Dukakis would be at a severe
disadvantage running against two
hometown favorites, Simon and Jack
son. Jackson, a North Carolina native,
has long made his home in Chicago.
Meanwhile, Gore, who had concen
trated much of his Super Tuesday ef
forts on damaging Gephardt's can
didacy, moved to claim the role of chief
adversary of front-runner Dukakis.
"This will be a two-man race be
tween me and Michael Dukakis," the
senator said from his election night
headquarters in the Opryland Hotel
in Nashville, Tenn. He prepared to
move on to Illinois today for a lunch
time factory visit.
Gore acknowledged that Jackson
would also be a candidate but
said, "In the voters' minds I think
they see it as between me and Duka
kis."
The Jackson camp had another view.
His campaign manager, Gerald Austin,

argued that the key to Super Tuesday
and to the future course of the race
was delegate strength, a category in
which his advisers hoped to come in
second only to Dukakis.
Jackson himself was elated.
"Something phenomenal is happen
ing in our nation," he said as the
returns were still coming in last night.
"Just this week, 23 years ago, we were
in the trauma of having to march from

Selma to Montgomery. The marchers
were beaten back with horses and state
troopers and cattle prods. That was a
very bloody Sunday.
"Now, 23 years later, we are not
marching from Selma to Montgomery.
We're marching to local precinct polls,
and there's a new politics in the South,
and I have won Southern states
today," he said.

35 percent. Jackson had 133,481, or
32 percent. Dukakis had 82,926, or 20
percent. Gephardt had 24,317, or 6
percent. Hart had 10,447, or 3 percent,
and Simon had 5,411, or 1 percent.
In Texas, the largest of the Super
Tuesday states, Dukakis had 47,789,
or 32 percent with 11 percent of the
precincts reporting. Gore had 31,938,
or 21 percent. Jackson had 30,086, or
20 percent. Gephardt had 24,666, or
16 percent. Hart had 8,476, or 6 per
cent, and Simon had 2,950, or 2 per
cent.
Dukakis' campaign supporters were
characteristically cautious about their
candidate's success, which had been
widely expected. In Illinois, where next
Tuesday's primary will mark the first
contest in a big Midwestern industrial
state, Charlie Baker, Dukakis' cam
paign manager in the state, declared:
"We don't expect to win here."
Dukakis will make a significant in
vestment of time and money in Illinois
— about $500,000 — said Baker, who
managed Dukakis' campaign victory
in the New Hampshire presidential
primary. But Baker contended that in
Illinois, Dukakis would be at a severe
disadvantage running against two
hometown favorites, Simon and Jack
son. Jackson, a North Carolina native,
has long made his home in Chicago.
Meanwhile, Gore, who had concen
trated much of his Super Tuesday ef
forts on damaging Gephardt's can
didacy, moved to claim the role of chief
adversary of front-runner Dukakis.
"This will be a two-man race be
tween me and Michael Dukakis," the
senator said from his election night
headquarters in the Opryland Hotel
in Nashville, Tenn. He prepared to
move on to Illinois today for a lunch
time factory visit.
Gore acknowledged that Jackson
would also be a candidate but
said, "In the voters' minds I think
they see it as between me and Duka
kis."
The Jackson camp had another view.
His campaign manager, Gerald Austin,

argued that the key to Super Tuesday
and to the future course of the race
was delegate strength, a category in
which his advisers hoped to come in
second only to Dukakis.
Jackson himself was elated.
"Something phenomenal is happen
ing in our nation," he said as the
returns were still coming in last night.
"Just this week, 23 years ago, we were
in the trauma of having to march from

Selma to Montgomery. The marchers
were beaten back with horses and state
troopers and cattle prods. That was a
very bloody Sunday.
"Now, 23 years later, we are not
marching from Selma to Montgomery.
We're marching to local precinct polls,
and there's a new politics in the South,
and I have won Southern states
today," he said.

Michael Dukakis yesterday holds David Koff, 3, after the Massachusetts
governor cast his vote at a polling station in Brookline, Mass.
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Duka
kis won Florida, was running first in
Texas and piled up enough delegates
in other states in "Super Tuesday"
primaries to bolster his lead in the
contest for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, boosted by
black support, was contending with
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore in several
Deep South states, including Alabama
and North Carolina. Jackson won Vir
ginia, and Gore, the only white
Southerner in the race, captured his
home state and neighboring Kentucky.
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt,
the victor in last month's lowa
caucuses and generally considered to
be Dukakis' principal adversary,
turned in a dismal performance, win
ning only his own state and trailing
far behind in Texas and other states
he had once hoped to win.
Here are partial returns from five
of the 20 states in which Democratic
voters registered their choice for pres
ident in primaries and caucuses.
In delegate-rich Florida, with 28 per
cent of the precincts reporting, Duka
kis had 95,884, or 32 percent. Jackson
had 63,093, or 21 percent. Gore had
54,902, or 18 percent. Gephardt had
46,848, or 16 percent. Former
Colorado Sen. Gary Hart had 9,808,
or 3 percent, and Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon had 6,126, or 2 percent.
In Kentucky, with 98 percent of the
precincts reporting, Gore had 142,173,
or 46 percent of the vote. Dukakis had
56,809, or 18 percent. Jackson had 47,
729, or 16 percent. Gephardt had
28,088, or 9 percent. Hart had 11,658,
or 4 percent, and Simon had 9,685,
or 3 percent.
In Virginia, with 68 percent of the
precincts reporting, Jackson had
114,579, or 47 percent. Gore had
54,922, or 22 percent. Dukakis had
47,749, or 20 percent. Gephardt had
9,528, or 4 percent. Hart had 4,356,
or 2 percent, and Simon had 4,247, 2
percent.
In North Carolina, with 64 percent
of the vote in, Gore had 147,676, or

35 percent. Jackson had 133,481, or
32 percent. Dukakis had 82,926, or 20
