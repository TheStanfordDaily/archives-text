# Bush sweeps 'Super Tuesday' contests

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Vice President
Bush swamped Sen. Robert Dole of
Kansas in at least 14 of 17 states in
yesterday's "Super Tuesday" voting,
pulling in a treasure-trove of more
than 500 convention delegates and
making himself the odds-on favorite
for the 1988 Republican presidential
nomination.
Bush garnered in one day about half
the 1,139 delegates needed for nomi
nation, as he rode to victory from the
Rio Grande Valley to the Atlantic
shores.
Bush told supporters in Houston,
"This exceeds my fondest expectations.
I'm going to be the next president of
the United States."
Vote counts and network polls gave
Bush victories in Florida and Texas,
the two largest "Super Tuesday"
states, and in Alabama, Arkansas,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mary
land, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Rhode Island and
Tennessee. He also led the non-binding
Virginia preference poll. Except in
North Carolina, his margins were so
big his rivals won few if any delegates.

Only in Missouri, Oklahoma and
Washington was Dole making it a close
fight.
Dole aides had conceded a week ago
that if Bush pulled in more than 500
delegates yesterday he would be almost
impossible to catch. Yesterday, with
the Associated Press preliminary tally
showing Bush with 563 delegates from
the day, Thomas Rath, one of those
strategists, said the Illinois primary
next Tuesday offered Dole a last
chance to reverse Bush's rush to the
nomination. "Dole will have to put all
his chips on the table in Illinois," said
Republican National Committee Chair
Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. "There's no
point in his holding back."
"Illinois is going to be very impor
tant," Dole said in Oak Brook, 111.
"This is going to be Bob Dole's
recovery state."
Bush was careful not to formally
say the nomination had been cinched,
but Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan,
the chair of the Republican Congres
sional Campaign Committee, said
Bush "looks poised to wrap it up a

week from tonight in Illinois."
Bush's sweep was not a surprise,
but the scale and uniformity of his
support was awesome. Network exit
polls showed him leading in all political
and demographic groups, including the
born-again religious adherents who
were the main hope of former televi

sion evangelist Pat Robertson.
Bush rolled up such large percent
ages that he seemed likely to get all,
or almost all, the convention delegates
in Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi and
Texas.
