# Panama police stop rally

PANAMA CITY, Panama - Riot
police used tear gas, water cannons and
shotguns yesterday to break up an op
position rally at a church in the city's
financial district, then fought running
street skirmishes with rock-throwing
youths.
Small groups of young Panamanians
set up street barricades of rocks, trash
and burning tires, detouring traffic and
chanting slogans against Panamanian
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Nori
ega. Black smoke and tear gas wafted
over a section of the city, and tree
shaded side streets in adjacent residen
tial neighborhoods took on the look of
a battle zone.
The violence erupted when a few hun
dred Noriega opponents began arriving
at the Gothic-style Iglesia del Carmen
Roman Catholic church for a mass and
rally called by the opposition National
Civic Crusade, an organization of about
200 business and professional groups.
The rally was to have been the first
organized demonstration by the
opposition since Noriega deposed Pres
ident Eric Arturo Delvalle Feb. 26 and
replaced him with a close ally.
Riot police known as "the Dober
manB," apparently under orders to
prevent the demonstration from taking
place, were at the scene early and for
cibly dispersed the protesters before they
could assemble. The riot police, some
wearing black berets and shoulder
patches with their emblem of a snarling
Doberman, drove the protesters off with
blasts of birdshot and tear gas.
Water cannons were fired from turrets
atop black trucks that had pictures of
the Smurf cartoon character painted on
the side.
Before fleeing from approaching
Dobermans, youths chanted slogans

such as "Down with the pineapple," a
nickname for Noriega.
Several opposition activists were re
ported beaten by police and detained,
including Civic Crusade official Warland
de Janon.
However, a police officer conducting
operations near the church, Mt\j. Carlos
Aijona, said that some persons merely
had been taken "out of the area" and
were not formally arrested. He said the
operation was directed only against
protesters' efforts to barricade streets.
Delvalle's ouster triggered a four-day
general strike last week, which combined
with U.S. punitive moves and a bur
geoning financial crisis here to bring the
country's vitai banking system to a
grinding halt.
Banks remained closed yesterday,
with no indication when they might
reopen.
"A panic has hit the banking system,"
said a diplomat who monitors the finan
cial sector. He said billions of dollars
have been transferred out of Panama's
large offshore banking system since the
ouster of Delvalle, drawing offshore as
sets down from about $25 billion at the
beginning of the year to perhaps half
that much now.
The supply of cash in the National
Bank of Panama, the country's equiva
lent of a central bank, has dwindled to
between $5 million and $17 million, dip
lomatic and Panamanian sources said.
It is unclear how the government will
pay its civilian employees and members
of the Defense Forces in the next several
days.
Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia Arias
yesterday accused the United States of
preparing a military invasion to oust
Noriega.
