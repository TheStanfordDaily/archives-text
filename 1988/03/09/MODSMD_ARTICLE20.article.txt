# East Palo Alto Giants?
## Possible franchise move sparks city controversy 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
The East Palo Alto City Council Mon
day moved a step closer to endorsing a
bid to bring the San Francisco Giants
to this economically depressed commu
nity.
The council voted 4-1 to support a
resolution to study the feasibility of sub
mitting a proposal to make East Palo
Alto the new home of the San Francisco
Giants, who plan to leave Candlestick
Park in 1994.
Passage of the resolution means the
city council and the San Mateo County
Task Force will now draft a master plan
for redevelopment of the Ravenswood
Industrial Site, a 156-acre bayside plot
at the end of Bay Road. This plan could
include construction of both a baseball
stadium and a meyor industrial or com
mercial park.
The Task Force reviewed possible San
Mateo County sites for a Giants stadium
and chose East Palo Alto as the most
favorable site.
Mayor James Blakey predicted at the
meeting that the stadium could "raise
the standard of living" in East Palo Alto.
City manager Stanley Hall added that
the stadium would create employment
opportunities and serve as an image
builder for the city.
Several citizens attending the meeting
criticized the resolution, saying the pres
ence of the Giants in East Palo Alto
would create local traffic problems and
would divert city attention from more
pressing issues, such as the area's

chronic poverty and drug problems.
One resident said it was senseless to
"talk about a ballpark when we are al
ready choking in traffic." Saying the
council should confront the "real prob
lem facing the city," he said "we do not
need the Giants if drugs are going to
kill us off."
Citing San Francisco's impoverished
Hunter's Point neighborhood as an ex
ample, another resident said he was not
convinced the stadium would generate
jobs.
Council member Barbara Mouton,
who voted against the resolution, said
she was concerned that "Blakey and
staff have blinders on," in that they
have not considered possible negative
effects a stadium might have on East
Palo Alto.
Some residents said they suspected
Task Force members only wanted the
East Palo Alto site because they as
sumed the city's people were "dumb
enough" to accept the Giants plan with
out understanding its disadvantages.
East Palo Alto resident Dennis Scher
zer accused council member Warnell
Coats, Vice Mayor Ruben Abrica and
Blakey of supporting a Giants bid in
order to gain popularity for the upcom
ing April 12 city election.
Although he voted in favor of the
resolution, Coats said he is not yet will
ing to commit himself wholeheartedly
for or against the idea of a stadium in
East Palo Alto. "There may not be a
stadium (at the Ravenswood site), but
we need to study the possibility.... The
land is under-utilized."
