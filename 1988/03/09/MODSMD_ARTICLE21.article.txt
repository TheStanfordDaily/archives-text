# Strike vote reflects national problem
## Nurses' complaints not isolated 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
A nursing shortage at Stanford Hospi
tal reflects a national trend of staffing
problems in hospitals across the coun
try.
"This is a nursing problem, not a
Stanford problem," said Donalda Dun
net, a press representative for the Com
mittee for Recognition of Nursing
Achievement, the independent nurses'
union. "Other hospitals are experienc
ing comparable problems."

Maureen Anderson, speaking for the
California Nurses Association, an or
ganization not related to CRONA, said
the problem stems from the fact that
nursing is becoming a "less and less
attractive career choice for women" in
the United States.
Whereas the nursing profession used
to attract the "cream of the crop," be
cause women did not have many other
alternatives, "now it is just one of many
possible choices for women," Anderson
said. "There are so many other options.
"Staffing shortages are the number
one problem," she said. "As the frus
tration level (due to overwork) grows,
more nurses are willing to strike."
According to CRONA President Myra
Lang, staffing shortages at Stanford are
acute, forcing nurses to perform periph
eral duties that greatly increase their
workload: "Nurses are now having to
answer phones; they have to run to the

pharmacies; they are having to trans
port patients; they have to move the
beds from floor to floor. The nurses are
at the point of exhaustion."
Anderson said nurses across the coun
try are also frustrated by salary prob
lems. At Stanford, salaries for nurses
reach their highest levels after just five
years, discouraging people from enter
ing the profession.
According to Anderson, nurses' un
ions in the Bay Area have demanded
an additional pay increase for senior
nurses. "Every contract in the last six
months has included a last 10-year
[salary increase based on seniority],"
she said.
In fact, the tentative agreement
reached by the nurses union and Stan
ford Hospital negotiators last week —
which was rejected by CRONA's mem
bership — included a last 4.5 percent
salary hike for nurses with over 7.5
years of service.
Although CRONA also seeks across
the-board salary increases, Dunnet said
a Stanford nurse's average salary is
$37,000, which compares favorably to
the $36,000 salary paid to nurses at
Kaiser Permanente. Kaiser represents
14 hospitals in Northern California, in
cluding San Francisco.
However, Lang said working condi
tions, not salaries, are CRONA's
concern. "Wages are merely a band-aid,"
Lang said at a press conference Sunday.
"It gets people into the field and it
draws them in. However, the major
thing with nursing is the working con
ditions."
Stanford nurses have also asked that

the hospital reinstate a stipend senior
nurses once received for training junior
nurses. The stipend was eliminated in
1986, and another system was intro
duced whereby nurses simply obtain
credit towards moving up the payscale
through service and performance
evaluations.

'less and less attractive
career choice for women.'

However, nurses at Kaiser do not
receive any compensation for training
new nurses, according to Daniel Danzig,
press representative for Kaiser.
CRONA has also argued that Stan
ford nurses should be compensated by
half their normal hourly wage for spend
ing time on-call. Currently, nurses at
Stanford receive a quarter of their
standard wage for on-call work.
According to Lang, the standard on
call pay for most nurses in the Bay
Area is half their regular salary. Danzig
concurred, saying that Kaizer offers its
nurses half-time pay for being on-call.
At Stanford, Lang said, the number
of personnel required to be on-call has
increased because of the general nursing
shortage, and those volunteering to do
so at the lower rate of one-quarter time
have become "almost non-existent."
As a result, on-call shifts are practi
cally mandatory rather than volunteer,
she said.
