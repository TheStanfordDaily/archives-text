# Soviet urges economic understanding

Urging the West to develop a more
comprehensive and accurate under
standing of recent Soviet domestic re
forms, a visiting high-level Soviet
economist visiting Stanford Monday
called for increased international eco
nomic exchange with the Soviet Union.
Timur Timofeev, director of the In
stitute for International Labor Studies
at the USSR Academy of Sciences, spoke
here to fill in for Abel Aganbegyan,
General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's
chief economic adviser and one of the
main architects of recent Soviet re
forms. Aganbegyan, whose Stanford ap
pearance was intended to cap a
three-week U.S. tour, flew home early
because of a death in his family.
The program, held in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, began with a short video
tape made by Aganbegyan just before
his return home. In the tape, Agan
begyan called "high technology [a]
catalyst of high productivity in the fu
ture."
In the Film, Agnbegyan focused on
the technical improvements that have
resulted from "perestroika," the Rus
sian term for Gorbachev's economic re
forms. He said Gorbachev is seeking to
overcome "the incorrect policy of in
vestment and technology" the Soviet
Union has used for the past 15 years.

Aganbegyan said "the main problem
(facing the Soviet economy) is not the
need to develop scientific discovery it
self," but rather the "development of
technological and engineering proc
esses."
Aganbegyan said in the tape that the
mqjor obstacle facing the current reform
effort is a lack of initiative among Soviet
workers. Solving this problem will re
quire change in the country's economic
administration from the "command
type" to a more stable structure "based
on general economic incentives."
This would include "more reliance on
market forces, improved finance and
reinvestment policies," Aganbegyan
said. He added that "increased auton
omy of enterprises and business, more
responsibility of individuals in the
budgetary process" will also be neces
sary.
Timofeev expanded on Aganbegyan's
brief address, saying that "in the spirit
of 'glasnost (openess)," and self
criticism, "I will admit there are some
real difficulties." He noted that Gorba
chev has said, " 'One of the greatest
mistakes we could make is to be afraid
to make mistakes.' "
According to Timofeev, perestroika is
"a new model of socialism that is more
active, more creative ... with more in
dependence, integrity and discussion."
Emphasizing the "very important and
difficult balance" between social justice

and economic efficiency, he urged the
West not to disregard Soviet social re
forms.
Timofeev noted that criticism of
perestroika in the West tends to arise
from a common misperception that the
policy is an exclusively "technocratic
process."
The West, he said, should not base
its judgement of Soviet reforms "solely
on [perestroika's] economic achiev
ments."
