# Women's conference:
## More progress needed 
### Jennifer Matsumura 
Although women have made some
progress in education and child care leg
islation, they still need to fight for
reform in welfare, occupational segrega
tion and divorce legislation, a Stanford
education professor told a gathering of
professional women at Kresge
Auditorium Saturday.
Addressing over 200 women at an
Alumni Association conference titled
"Choices and Changes," Education Prof.
Myra Strober outlined several problems
confronting women in the workplace.
In her lecture on "The Current Out
look for Women in the Economy," Stro
ber said that although women have
definitely improved their educational
status, occupational segregation and the
wage gap are proof that discrimination
is alive and well in the professional
world. According to Strober, many
women are still confined to relatively
low-paying occupations, such as teach
ing, nursing and librarianship.
However, Strober praised recent ef
forts on behalf of professional women
in the area of child care, noting that
there are currently seven child-care bills
in Congress. An increasing number of

women are remaining in the workforce,
she said, making affordable, quality child
care a high priority.
Strober also said she saw a need for
improved divorce and child support leg
islation, explaining that courts underes
timate the difficulties women face in
becoming self-sufficient.
The problems are often aggravated by
fathers who do not pay the required
child support, Strober said, noting that
legislation that would automatically
deduct child support money from the
negligent spouse's paycheck is currently
being considered.
Law Prof. Barbara Babcock, delivering
the conference's keynote speech, said
although the women's movement has
come a long way, "far too many suc
cessful women feel that since they made
it, others can too." However, just be
cause these women have succeeded, they
should not feel that the path has been
paved for others, she said.
"Concern for other women is the ap
propriate attitude for women in posi
tions of power," Babcock said, because
influential professional women can help
those women who currently have no
chance for self-expression or advance
ment.
