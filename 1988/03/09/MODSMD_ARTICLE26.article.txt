## Don't ignore risks 
### 
STANFORD HAS serious
problems managing health
and safety.
A report released last Friday by
the risk management consulting
firm SRI International has con
firmed charges that the University
is negligent in its conduct of health
and safety policy.
University President Donald
Kennedy claims the administration
is "reassured" by the report be
cause it identifies no "clear and
present danger" requiring campus
community evacuation.
But the report is not reassuring;
it is unsettling. The handling and
storage of toxic materials in a re
search environment is not a matter
to be taken lightly.
In fact, two years ago the Uni
versity conducted a confidential in
ternal audit that reportedly cov
ered much of the same ground as
the one just completed by SRI. The
administration is still trying to find
out why that report was ignored.
SRI has found a conflict of in
terest at Stanford between re
search and safety, and the Univer
sity administration is largely at
fault for the dilemma.
Last December, a health and
safety official sent Kennedy a res
ignation letter, charging that the
Department of Health and Safety
and other supporting departments
are riddled with waste, misman
agement, cover-up and employee
intimidation.
The University is still looking
into those sobering allegations. But
SRl's report — the first of many
forthcoming — has certainly not
exonerated anyone.
Far from exoneration, the report
in fact exposes the University's
health and safety enforcement
mechanisms for what they are:
muddled, ineffectual and un
responsive to employee concerns.
When employees at the Environ
mental Safety Facility complained

a year ago of noxious fumes in
their work area, no one investigat
ed.
When $50,000 was budgeted two
years ago to correct a dangerously
outdated chlorine gas containment
system at deGuerre Pool, no one
carried out the project.
Other employees have stepped
forward to tell their stories either
to the administration or — even
more disturbing — to the media.
One was quoted recently as saying
he resigned last year because he
"didn't want to be responsible for
others' deaths."
In this atmosphere of distrust
and animosity, public disclosure of
one report at a press conference
is only a small first step.
And it is a giant step backwards
to call the problems University
facilities faces "potential risks," as
Kennedy did in his statement res
ponding to the revelations.
Risk, as such, is inherently rel
ative. There is no such thing as a
potential risk. To call risk "poten
tial" is to euphemize the issue.
The rhetoric needs to cease so
the administration can get down
to business. Kennedy said Friday
he has ordered engineers to "ex
pedite" work on several buildings
SRI identified as risks.
More than "expedite," the ad
ministration needs to set a
timetable for the engineers and in
form the public of the results of
all relevant tests and studies, no
matter how unimportant they may
seem.
For the long term, the bureau
cracy of the University, though
well-meaning, must become more
responsive to health and safety
concerns. If any officials are hin
dering risk management, they
must be fired immediately.
The University is not through
answering questions.
