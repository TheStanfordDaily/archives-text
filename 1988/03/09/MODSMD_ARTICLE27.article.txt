## English difficulties not limited to foreigners 
### 
IT IS VERY EASY to take the
stereotypical viewpoint that all
foreign students flounder in Eng
lish classes. That is certainly not the
case. I hope the writer was speaking
for himself in the March 2 letter,
"Help Foreign Students."
I don't think "struggling in classes"
is an experience restricted to foreign
students. Foreign students generally do
well in all classes, including English. It
may take them some time to get used
to writing analytical papers because of
the approach required, but not because
of their writing ability.
I know many American students who
have gotten C's on their English
papers despite the fact that they have
been writing in English all through

their schooling.
Why should an "essay type test"
that tests writing ability be given only
to foreign students? Do all Americans
have the same writing ability? Why
single out foreigners when so many
Americans have a rough time writing
good papers?
I am a foreign student but I have
not faced any problems that are sup
posed to be common experience for
undergraduates from other countries. I
think I got higher scores on the Eng
lish sections of both the SAT and the
Achievement Tests than a lot of
Americans.
A large number of foreign under
graduates (of the small number at
Stanford) have had English for several
years in school, so they do have a good

grasp of the language. They would not
be at Stanford if they had not ex
pressed themselves well in English on
their application.
It is extremely difficult for foreigners
to get into top U.S. universities and
the ones that get in do make the most
of the opportunity.
Variations in ability can and do exist
among foreign students as they do
among the rest of the Stanford stu
dents. It is therefore unfair and incor
rect to suggest that all foreign stu
dents struggle in English classes and
cannot express themselves well.
The University can develop a place
ment test for writing like the math
placement test. That test gives the
freshmen some indication about their
pre-calculus background and helps

them decide which calculus course to
start with.
The English test could help fresh
men determine their level of under
standing and decide on a suitable
writing class. It should be given to all
freshmen and not be restricted to
foreign students because not all foreign
students are poor in English, and not
all Americans are super writers.
It is true that "we have to learn to
crawl before we can walk," but should
we ask people who can run well to
show us if they can crawl?
It is a noble idea to help students
improve their writing skills but let us
refrain from putting labels on any
community at Stanford.
