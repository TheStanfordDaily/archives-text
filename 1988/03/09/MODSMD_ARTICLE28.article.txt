# Theme house uses objective criteria
## 
### 
In Sylvia Castro's Feb. 23 and
March 2 letters, she contends granting
special priorities for theme houses is a
subjective process, claiming "students
must prove themselves worthy of that
house prior to the Draw."
Housing Center Director Rodger
Whitney in a Feb. 29 letter outlined
why the system for allocating priorities
is not a subjective process. Obtaining a
priority is open to any student willing
to meet specific criteria.
Castro claims that the American
Studies House does not abide by Uni
versity standards in giving out special
priorities. In reality, we do abide by
these standards.
Special priorities at American Studies
are granted to students who sign the
housing agreement and submit a pro
posal for a house program activity.

These proposals allow students to
think about what ideas, interests and
programs they can bring to the house.
The criteria are not used to exclude
people from the house. To our knowl
edge, no one has ever been denied a
special priority at American Studies.
The theme associates, who grant
priorities, assist students in drafting
their proposals. A student may be
asked by a theme associate to resubmit
his or her proposal. These requests
typically involve narrowing the focus of
the proposal to ensure the activity is
viable while keeping with the theme.
We grant special priorities to anyone
who presents us with a workable
theme-related project. The Draw deter
mines who lives in the house. Nowhere
in the process do students "prove
themselves worthy" to live in American
Studies.
