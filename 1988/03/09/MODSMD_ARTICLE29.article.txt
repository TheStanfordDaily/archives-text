# Ruling on Davies rejects U.S. values
## 
### 
The March 4 Daily reported Santa
Clara Superior Court Judge James
Steward ruled that Stanford professors
can be judged on the merits of their
views.
"Incorrect" views cost Prof. Norman
Davies a job at Stanford: He could not
find it justifiable to condemn the Poles
for their alleged insensitivity to people
of the Jewish faith.
Is there any other nation in Europe
that lost some 50,000 of its people,
shot by the Germans for assisting the
Jews?
Poles are one of few European na
tions enthusiastically friendly toward
the Americans. They both believe in

the same values. One of these values is
the freedom of expressing one's views
without jeopardizing one's career.
For the sake of this freedom, I have
left Communist-dominated Poland, my
culture and my family to join the main
bastion of this freedom.
The ruling of Judge Stewart has
dramatically shaken the belief in the
American values that I and my friends
hold. There are even some Polish-
Americans who are now contemplating
renunciation of their American citizen
ship.
