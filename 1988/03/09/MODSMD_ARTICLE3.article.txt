# Report faults safety policies
## SRI alleges University health and safety mismanagement 
### Nick Anderson Editorial Staff 
In a broad indictment of Stanford's health and
safety policies, an independent risk management
firm has determined that the University bears re
sponsibility for exposing the campus community to
"unnecessary risks" and must immediately redress
identified safety problems in some buildings.
SRI International, the Menlo Park research and
consulting group, released a 59-page report of its
month-long safety investigation at a press confer
ence here Friday, concluding that Stanford faces
no "clear and present danger" requiring shutdown
or evacuation of facilities.
But SRI found nevertheless that "insufficient
leadership" in the University administration has
obstructed progress in implementing health and
safety reforms and obscured the proper role and
authority of the Health and Safety Department in
relation to faculty and researchers, Facilities Project
Management and Operations and Maintenance.
SRI also determined that deGuerre Pool and the
Environmental Safety Facility both require imme
diate structural attention to prevent potentially life
threatening accidents. Additionally, the McCul
lough, Keck and Mitchell Earth Sciences buildings
require further examination by safety experts, SRI
said.
Stanford "has yet to formulate a coherent policy
that the administration supports, that makes lines
of authority dear, and tlml ensures compliance with
health and safety procedures by all the University's
community," the report states.
Although SRI found that Stanford "has made
important contributions" to campus safety efforts
in recent years, SRI said the University's program
is "inadequate" for meeting present and future
safety needs.
Delays to be further investigated
At the press conference, Robert Shelton, who
directed SRl's team on campus, also faulted the
University for failing to implement reforms pro
posed two years ago in a confidential internal audit
that is apparently similar to the one being conducted
now.
Asked about recommendations
"from the University's earlier
probe, Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Freelen said, "I
think it's fair to say they haven't
been achieved."
Ralph Buchanan, an acting dep
uty associate vice president for
services and facilities, added that
the delay "is part of the issue
that's being reviewed internally."
According to Freelen, several
follow-up reports from Director
of Internal Audit Peter Mil
lington, supplementing the cur
rent one, will seek to identify
those individuals responsible for
the administration's laxity.
Freelen would not say whether
any names will be released.
'Working is hazardous to your
health*
* t
Buchanan, who is often respon
sible for directing employees who
work in the trouble-plagued build
ings, was asked at the press con
ference whether he was confident
that he was not sending his people
into potentially contaminated
areas.
"No, I'm not confident," he
said.
He quickly added that his de
partment has "a lot" of safety
precautions developed in conjunc
tion with Health and Safety.
When pressed on the issue, Bu
chanan was forced to admit with
a smile, "Working is hazardous
to your health."

But Kennedy is 'reassured'
In a prepared statement re
leased at the press conference,
University President Donald Ken
nedy said the members of a special
safety panel he chairs were "reas
sured" by the report because of
the lack of any immediate danger
to the public.
However, Kennedy acknowl
edged that several "potential
risks" needed to be addressed.
Kennedy's advisory panel in
cludes Economics Prof. Kenneth
Arrow, Physics Prof. Wolfgang
Panofsky and three outside ad
visers: Judge Victor Calvo, Dr.
Jere Goyan and Judge Shirley
Hufstedler. Kennedy appointed
the panel in January to help him
grapple with the long- and short
term implications of the ongoing
health and safety scandals.
In December, Kennedy in
structed Millington to commission
an SRI investigation in response
to former Health and Safety offi
cial Jon Moldestad's allegations
of safety mismanagement and
cover-up.
SRI investigated health and
safety complaints through:
• On-site inspections of individ
ual buildings;
• Over 60 confidential inter
views with personnel; and
• An overall evaluation of Stan
ford's risk management.
Management problems
The two buildings requiring im
mediate structural attention, ac
cording to SRI, are deGuerre and
the Environmental Safety Facili
ty. However, the firm added that

several other buildings need fur
ther investigation due to the lack
of time it had to follow up on
complaints aired during its inter
views with employees last month.
In an observation illustrating
the broad type of facilities and
management difficulties the ad
ministration faces, SRI noted that
deGuerre's chlorine gas contain
ment system badly needs replace
ment. A natural or operational
accident could imperil the lives of
the pool's users if gas cylinders
remain in their present condition,
SRI said.
In fact, the Department of
Health and Safety had recom
mended such a move two years
ago, and $50,000 was allocated
for the project. However, the de
partment's request went un
heeded and the money remained
unspent. Millington is currently
investigating the matter.
Similarly, employee reports in
1987 that noxious fumes from
chemical storage cells and the in
cinerator at the safety facility
were circulating back into its of
fices received little attention.
"No [air samples] were taken
to determine if the concentrations
posed a significant toxicological
hazard, and no calculations were
performed to estimate concentra
tions and determine the level of
risk," SRI said.
SRI recommended, and Ken
nedy agreed, that the facility —
which among other things, dis
poses of toxic wastes and lab
animals — requires closer scruti
ny. Kennedy has appointed an en
gineer to examine the facility's
troublesome scrubber, which is
designed to reduce the toxicity of

the incinerator's emissions.
Over the past year, the scrubber
has repeatedly malfunctioned, re
quiring the University to apply to
the Bay Area Air Quality Man
agement District for permission
to operate the incinerator without
the scrubber.
Conflict of interest
The report further questioned
the commitment of faculty and
staff to health and safety in a
research-driven environment,
saying that "disregard for the

University's health and safety ob
jectives ... exists in some areas
and undermines efforts to provide
... an effective program."
Although the report found that
some laboratories have started
their own safety programs, others
"have a cavalier attitude" about
the issues.
And Shelton confirmed at the
press conference that it is "clearly
true" that some departments
have resisted efforts from Health
and Safety, considering the de
partment an obstruction to re
search.

In order to avoid the conflict
of interest, SRI said, the Univer
sity should resurrect the Presi
dent's Committee on Health and
Safety. The committee would
formulate policy and oversee both
the regulatory department and
the laboratories to make sure that
risk management efforts are coor
dinated.
Two years ago, the committee
voted to dissolve itself. Kennedy
has since acknowledged that the
action was a mistake and that
SRl's recommendation merits a
positive response.
