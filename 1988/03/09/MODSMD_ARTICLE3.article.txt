# Report faults safety policies
## SRI alleges University health and safety mismanagement 
### Nick Anderson Editorial Staff 
In a broad indictment of Stanford's health and
safety policies, an independent risk management
firm has determined that the University bears re
sponsibility for exposing the campus community to
"unnecessary risks" and must immediately redress
identified safety problems in some buildings.
SRI International, the Menlo Park research and
consulting group, released a 59-page report of its
month-long safety investigation at a press confer
ence here Friday, concluding that Stanford faces
no "clear and present danger" requiring shutdown
or evacuation of facilities.
But SRI found nevertheless that "insufficient
leadership" in the University administration has
obstructed progress in implementing health and
safety reforms and obscured the proper role and
authority of the Health and Safety Department in
relation to faculty and researchers, Facilities Project
Management and Operations and Maintenance.
SRI also determined that deGuerre Pool and the
Environmental Safety Facility both require imme
diate structural attention to prevent potentially life
threatening accidents. Additionally, the McCul
lough, Keck and Mitchell Earth Sciences buildings
require further examination by safety experts, SRI
said.
Stanford "has yet to formulate a coherent policy
that the administration supports, that makes lines
of authority dear, and tlml ensures compliance with
health and safety procedures by all the University's
community," the report states.
Although SRI found that Stanford "has made
important contributions" to campus safety efforts
in recent years, SRI said the University's program
is "inadequate" for meeting present and future
safety needs.
Delays to be further investigated
At the press conference, Robert Shelton, who
directed SRl's team on campus, also faulted the
University for failing to implement reforms pro
posed two years ago in a confidential internal audit
that is apparently similar to the one being conducted
now.
