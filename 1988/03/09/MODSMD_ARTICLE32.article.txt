## Public service a duty 
### 
JANUARY 20, 1989. The 41st Pres
ident of the United States concludes
his Inaugural Address: "Ask not
what you can do for your country. Ask
what your country can do for you."
When the applause subsides, a stark
conclusion remains: Citizenship in
America has become a one-way relation
ship. No longer do people feel they owe
a duty to serve their country. No longer
does citizenship entail responsibilities to
other citizens.
Farmers, students, the poor, the elder
ly, etc., demand their entitlements, yet
fewer feel obligated to put in what they
take out.
Unlike other countries with a common
ethnicity and history (e.g. France or
Japan), America must define itself by a
set of common values. We share a belief
in democracy and equality rather than
similar skin color, ethnic tradition or re
ligious doctrine.
But since democracy and equality are
abstract concepts, we tend to take them
for granted and forget that these concepts
did not come easily, but required revo
lutions and wars to become implanted
into our nation's soil.
Rather than working to nurture the
growth of democracy and equality
throughout our country, we ask the
modern question: "What have you done
for us lately?"
At this time of heightened self
absorption, the student population
should lift its eyes from its textbooks to
consider Isaiah's words, "If I am only
for myself, then who am I?"

As a response, I propose the following
solution to help reunite the country: One
year requirement of Universal National
Service (U.N.S.) for all Americans be
tween the ages of 18 and 22.
U.N.S. would allow each person to
choose whether to serve the country in
a military or nonmilitary capacity. It
would not discriminate on the basis of
sex, race, ethnicity, religion or physical
handicap.
Those who pursue the nonmilitary op
tion would work in areas ranging from
national parks, hospitals and health
clinics to schools, public works and
housing projects. Participants would be
assigned to geographic areas randomly,
and food, shelter, clothing and a stipend
would be provided.
Traditional barriers of class, race,
region and culture in American society
would recede as college-age Americans
live and work together for a year, sharing
their different perspectives and strug
gling to understand one another.
Stanford students, for example, would
receive their most practical American
studies/ political science/ anthropology
experience in dealing directly with dif
ferent elements of American society and
arrive at their own ad hoc solutions to
the problems they would face.
Whether providing day care for the
poor, companionship to the elderly, tu
toring or staffing health clinics, young
Americans would supply a much
demanded national service and develop
a sense of dedication to their country.
Skeptics will argue that it would re

quire massive funding at time of budget
tightening. My answer is that building a
more unified and dedicated citizenry in
addition to meeting pressing national
needs is well worth the cost.
Isn't it better to invest in America's
future leaders as a defense to foreign
political, military and economic incur
sions than to add yet another weapon to
our already bulging arsenal?
Stanford can recognize the importance
of a citizen's duty by instituting a com
munity service requirement for gradua
tion. While the U.N.S. program attacks
national issues, a Stanford community
service requirement would give academic
credit for integrating Stanford students
with local communities.
As recipients of so much of society's
bounty, Stanford students have a sub
stantial obligation to repay society's kind
ness not with words but with action.

will light our country, and the glow from
that fire can truly light the world."
