## Article misrepresented Platform 
### 
THE MARCH 3 ARTICLE, "Early
endorsement for spring election
questioned," misrepresented the
nature, purpose and processes of the
People's Platform and requires a
response.
The People's Platform is a coalition
of members of MEChA (a Chicano
student organization), the Black Stu
dent Union, Asian American Students
Association, Stanford American Indian
Organization, Stanford Organization
for Lesbian and Gay Equality, Hillel (a
Jewish student organization), the
Women's Center and Students United
for a Democrative Education.
It was originally formed in an effort
to transform the ASSU from an in
sensitive and irrelevant institution to
one that was sensitive and responsive
to student needs and active on student
issues.
For three years we have nominated
candidates to run for the ASSU Senate
and have found that students will vote
for candidates who speak to issues and
Student Services.
This coalition includes students who
have actively sought out change in the
University and ASSU policies through
student organizations, and we feel that
a group with this kind of experience,
commitment and drive can best artic
ulate and strive to meet the desires
and needs of a mcyority of students.
The driving force for change on this
campus on issues such as curriculum,
social responsibility and services to
students have been the Third World

student organizations, and the makeup
of our coalition and our slate reflects
this high level of activism. It also
reflects that Third World students
sought out other students from the
progressive community who have
proven commitment to fighting for
issues to join their coalition effort.
We also believe that people should
decide to run for office not only be
cause they individually want to be in
the ASSU (because they think it would
be fun or good for their resume or
whatever), but because they represent
a community and a constituency.
Therefore we primarily look within the
membership of the groups — those
who have been among the most active
students at Stanford — that make up
the coalition to find candidates for the
senate.
Rather than an endorsement process,
we would term Monday's meeting a
nominating meeting: We nominated
members of the groups making up the
People's Platform Coalition to run for
the senate. We needed to do this
before the petition deadline because
many of these people would not run
for the senate if they were not
nominated by the People's Platform.
However, we also understand that
there are candidates who are not
involved in the coalition's member
groups who may be able to represent
the issues. In order to seek out such
individuals, we made an announcement
at the candidate's information meeting
held earlier this quarter.

We were able to identify a few such
candidates (who had worked on proj
ects like the You Can Make a Differ
ence Conference or educational activi
ties in their dorms) and therefore
created one "at large" position to be
filled by an individual who would
uphold the ideals of the People's Plat
form.
The meeting was not "closed" or
"secretive" as is claimed in the article.
We made as many candidates as we
could aware of the opportunity to run
with the People's Platform; to those
who missed our announcements and
flyers, we can only apologize and
promise to prioritize publicity more in
the future.
The level of publicity for the nomi
nation meeting and the fact that we
made our nominations prior to the
petition deadline differ in no signifi
cant way from last year's processes.
The process seems to be questioned
now because people are worried about
the People's Platform becoming "too
powerful" due to its success in recent
elections.
When Third World students organize
for political empowerment, people get
upset. At campuses around the
country, similar slates and parties have
formed using similar nominating proce
dures. Almost inevitably the slates are
accused of "a closed process" or being
"special interest" or "secretive."
This is not because Third World
students are inherently secretive in
their processes, but because people see

the power of parties like the People's
Platform and decide to find whatever
means they can to attack it.
Along these lines, one must question
The Daily':! source of "objective" com
mentators on the fairness of the proc
ess. Both people who claimed the
process was secretive and unfair had
last year been denied the People's
Platform endorsement for Council of
Presidents and had been involved in a
bitter campaign against the People's
Platform slate. One of these commen
tators is currently running for COP
against the People's Platform slate.
We hope that people understand the
nature of the People's Platform as
explained in this letter. We are a
coalition that primarily seeks candi-

dates who are active on issues through
the organizations that make up our
coalition, trying to balance this with
openness to outside candidates as best
we can.
We will soon be developing more
permanent bylaws, so any interested or
upset individuals are invited to contact
us for input to the future endorsement
process. Through this we can hope to
avoid unnecessary confusion and dis
satisfaction.

students have been the Third World

student organizations, and the makeup
of our coalition and our slate reflects
this high level of activism. It also
reflects that Third World students
sought out other students from the
progressive community who have
proven commitment to fighting for
issues to join their coalition effort.
We also believe that people should
decide to run for office not only be
cause they individually want to be in
the ASSU (because they think it would
be fun or good for their resume or
whatever), but because they represent
a community and a constituency.
Therefore we primarily look within the
membership of the groups — those
who have been among the most active
students at Stanford — that make up
the coalition to find candidates for the
senate.
Rather than an endorsement process,
we would term Monday's meeting a
nominating meeting: We nominated
members of the groups making up the
People's Platform Coalition to run for
the senate. We needed to do this
before the petition deadline because
many of these people would not run
for the senate if they were not
nominated by the People's Platform.
However, we also understand that
there are candidates who are not
involved in the coalition's member
groups who may be able to represent
the issues. In order to seek out such
individuals, we made an announcement
at the candidate's information meeting
held earlier this quarter.

We were able to identify a few such
candidates (who had worked on proj
ects like the You Can Make a Differ
ence Conference or educational activi
ties in their dorms) and therefore
created one "at large" position to be
filled by an individual who would
uphold the ideals of the People's Plat
form.
The meeting was not "closed" or
"secretive" as is claimed in the article.
We made as many candidates as we
could aware of the opportunity to run
with the People's Platform; to those
who missed our announcements and
flyers, we can only apologize and
promise to prioritize publicity more in
the future.
The level of publicity for the nomi
nation meeting and the fact that we
made our nominations prior to the
petition deadline differ in no signifi
cant way from last year's processes.
The process seems to be questioned
now because people are worried about
the People's Platform becoming "too
powerful" due to its success in recent
elections.
When Third World students organize
for political empowerment, people get
upset. At campuses around the
country, similar slates and parties have
formed using similar nominating proce
dures. Almost inevitably the slates are
accused of "a closed process" or being
"special interest" or "secretive."
This is not because Third World
students are inherently secretive in
their processes, but because people see

the power of parties like the People's
Platform and decide to find whatever
means they can to attack it.
Along these lines, one must question
The Daily':! source of "objective" com
mentators on the fairness of the proc
ess. Both people who claimed the
process was secretive and unfair had
last year been denied the People's
Platform endorsement for Council of
Presidents and had been involved in a
bitter campaign against the People's
Platform slate. One of these commen
tators is currently running for COP
against the People's Platform slate.
We hope that people understand the
nature of the People's Platform as
explained in this letter. We are a
coalition that primarily seeks candi-

dates who are active on issues through
the organizations that make up our
coalition, trying to balance this with
openness to outside candidates as best
we can.
We will soon be developing more
permanent bylaws, so any interested or
upset individuals are invited to contact
us for input to the future endorsement
process. Through this we can hope to
avoid unnecessary confusion and dis
satisfaction.

THE MARCH 3 ARTICLE, "Early
endorsement for spring election
questioned," misrepresented the
nature, purpose and processes of the
People's Platform and requires a
response.
The People's Platform is a coalition
of members of MEChA (a Chicano
student organization), the Black Stu
dent Union, Asian American Students
Association, Stanford American Indian
Organization, Stanford Organization
for Lesbian and Gay Equality, Hillel (a
Jewish student organization), the
Women's Center and Students United
for a Democrative Education.
It was originally formed in an effort
to transform the ASSU from an in
sensitive and irrelevant institution to
one that was sensitive and responsive
to student needs and active on student
issues.
For three years we have nominated
candidates to run for the ASSU Senate
and have found that students will vote
for candidates who speak to issues and
Student Services.
This coalition includes students who
have actively sought out change in the
University and ASSU policies through
student organizations, and we feel that
a group with this kind of experience,
commitment and drive can best artic
ulate and strive to meet the desires
and needs of a mcyority of students.
The driving force for change on this
campus on issues such as curriculum,
social responsibility and services to
students have been the Third World

student organizations, and the makeup
of our coalition and our slate reflects
this high level of activism. It also
reflects that Third World students
sought out other students from the
progressive community who have
proven commitment to fighting for
issues to join their coalition effort.
