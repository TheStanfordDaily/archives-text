## Bug looks into patent for glowing condoms 
### Andrew Berkowitz Senior staff writer 
Dear Bug,
Well, The Daily's losing the bat
tle. It used to be the No. 1 humour
publication on campus, but after
last week's Bug-Me, it has slipped
behind the Chaparral.
Better luck next time.
— Charles A. Parral
Gee, chap, I'm sorry to hear
the Chaparral is your favorite
publication. Unfortunately, due to
demands on office space, the
Chaparral is being evicted from
the publications building under
the auspices of the Federal Wit
less Relocation Program.

Dear Bug,
I was having a conversation
with some of the guys in my office,
and one of them mentioned that
students have "rather limited"
patent rights. Can you tell me
what "rather limited" means? I
mean, if tomorrow I invent glow
in-the-dark condoms and it's the
new nighttime rage in San Fran
cisco and I would normally make
enough money to pay off the na
tional debt and take all of the Bay
Area skiing, is Stanford going to
take it all and thank me for my
donation to the Centennial
fund??? I don't remember signing
anything, but the guys in the office
said that I didn't have to ... that
there was some fine print in the
registration agreement or some
implicit "student slave law" or

some such thing.
Anxious to begin production.
— The Rubber Band
Well, pal, I've got some good news
and some bad news. The good
news is that you probably still
retain all rights to the glow-in
the-dark condoms (Glo-jans). The
bad news is that in this age of
incurable sexually transmitted
diseases, the last thing I'd want
to do during sex would be to look
down and see something glowing.
I'd be the first guy in history to
go to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for a check-up.
But as for the matter at hand,
according to the nice folks at the
Stanford Office of Technology
Licensing ("Do you have a license
for that there stereo, sonny?"), if
you ain't signed anything saying
you give away your rights then
they still belong to you. The only
way you might not have the rights
to an invention would be if you
were working on a government
or private-sector funded project
and had signed an agreement
specifying which rights did or did
not belong to you.
So carrying your example to
nutzoid proportions, let's suppose
that while conducting a perfectly
harmless lab in Physics 59
("Physics of Phallically Cylindri
cal Objects"), you are bitten by a
radioactive TA and drop a condom
into a vat of Something Green
and Glowing. Moments later you
fish the condom out of the vat
and to your surprise discover that
it glows in the dark.
Despite some set-backs during
your field-testing of the product
— like your girlfriend remarking
that she's "been more turned on
looking at the photos of Enrico
Fermi in her physics book"— you
patent the new condoms, sell the
patent to the Goodyear Rubber
Company (also the manufacturers
of a fine line of glow-in-the-dark
snow tires), and take the Bay Area
skiing.
However, being a National Re
search University where Cool
Thingß are invented, the Univer
sity also has a bunch of research

projects being sponsored by dif
ferent businesses and agencies.
The students working on those
projects (usually upper-level grad
students or guys named "Herky")
often sign contracts with phrases
like, "In agreeing to work on this
project, the student surrenders all
their basic constitutional rights
including the right to life, liberty
and the pursuit of hipness." Sign
ing a contract like this could mean
that you have surrendered the
rights to anything you invent.
It's kind of like how Sam
Butera wrote "Just a Gigolo" 30
years ago but didn't bother to
copyright the song. Then David
Lee Roth came along, recorded
the number, copyrighted the ar
rangement and made a zillion dol
lars. Now if Sam Butera wants
to record his own song he has to
pay royalties to David Lee Roth.
It all reminds me of that ancient
Chinese proverb which goes, "Life
is sometimes unfair, but David
Lee Roth is always ugly."
Since obtaining a patent is a
pain in the butt (tail bone), the
Technology Licensing office has a
service where they take your cool
invention and get the patent for
you. The catch is that the
royalties on the sale of the inven
tion are split between you, the
department in which you invented
the stuff and the school.
Presumably, under this option
the Bay Area doesn't get to go
skiing.
Dear Bug,
Please excuse our naivete, but
something was fishy in Thurs
day's "Student Body * Mention
was made of external and internal
water sports in relation to sexually
transmitted diseases. Maybe we're
all wet and hang around comput
ers too much, but we have no idea
what these "sports" could be. Is
deGuerre safe? Please help.
— Aquarius
Yes, deGuerre is safe. Thanks
for asking.
Massive Unit-Packed Schedules
Update:

A few weeks back we printed a
question asking what were the
most number of units anyone had
ever taken at Stanford. Not
satisfied with the answers
emanating from Old Union, we
ran a contest to find out if people
had taken huge schedules exceed
ing the 24 or 25 units that the
Registrar's Office claimed were
the upper limits.
You should understand that
these unit limits only apply to
undergrads. Grads don't seem to
have strict limitations, and, in
fact, I received one transcript
from a med student who passed
28 units one quarter; others
claimed to have passed 35 or
more.
Many undergrads wrote in ;
saying that they got around the
unit limit by taking classes for
reduced numbers of units. By list
ing three, four or five unit classes
for one or two units each, you
can cram a whole bunch of classes
into your schedule. Strangely,
nobody was willing to provide doc
umented proof; one student
claimed giving out this informa
tion would be "too incriminating."
Armed with this information, I
met with University Registrar
Sally Mahoney. In the following
paragraphs I will endeavor to
quote her correctly, or else it is
highly possible that I could wake

up one morning and find that I
had been transferred to Herkimer
County Community College in
upstate New York.
Mahoney said she doubts very
seriously that even if students
were to take classes for one or
two units, they could take no
more than 10 classes because
"they couldn't put them all on
one study list and it would cause
notice."
Ail study lists are audited by
the Registrar's Office to assure
that the classes listed are in range
with the course offerings. Alleged
ly, if a student tries to take a
five-unit course for one unit, the
Registrar will contact the profes
sor and the student in order to
assure that the student will only
be doing an amount of work
equivalent to one unit.
Students not agreeing to reduce
the amount of work will be shot.
Prior to the early 70's, students
with outstanding grade averages
could take excess loads. But in
the early 70's the Faculty Senate
set the normal schedule as 15
units, with students being allowed
to take as many as 20 or as few
as 12. This was done on the theory
that there is more to a Stanford
education than just taking lots of
classes — students need to select
courses which they would study
in depth.

These days, student petitions
to take overload schedules are ac
cepted only for students who need
those few extra units to graduate
or who, because of scheduling con
flicts within a department, have
to take classes which will only be
offered once during the student's
course of study.
Mahoney wants it to be clear,
however, that the Registrar's Of
fice is not in the business of put
ting in procedures which assume
that 100 percent of Stanford stu
dents are trying to take advantage
of the system. Her assumption is
that the Fundamental Standard
applies to creating one's study list
and that students should not be
trying to sneak around the
guidelines which exist "for sub
stantive academic reasons."
Her office is in the business of
"facilitating student accesss to
courses" and not policing incom
ing study lists.
Since no undergrads were will
ing to provide documented proof
of having taken excess schedules,
I guess I'll have to declare myself
the winner of the massive-units
contest with the massive 17 units
I took last quarter. I thus award
myself first prize: A baby oil back
rub from the new Dollies.
Academia is beautiful. Have a
groovy Spring Break!

Massive Unit-Packed Schedules
Update:

A few weeks back we printed a
question asking what were the
most number of units anyone had
ever taken at Stanford. Not
satisfied with the answers
emanating from Old Union, we
ran a contest to find out if people
had taken huge schedules exceed
ing the 24 or 25 units that the
Registrar's Office claimed were
the upper limits.
You should understand that
these unit limits only apply to
undergrads. Grads don't seem to
have strict limitations, and, in
fact, I received one transcript
from a med student who passed
28 units one quarter; others
claimed to have passed 35 or
more.
Many undergrads wrote in ;
saying that they got around the
unit limit by taking classes for
reduced numbers of units. By list
ing three, four or five unit classes
for one or two units each, you
can cram a whole bunch of classes
into your schedule. Strangely,
nobody was willing to provide doc
umented proof; one student
claimed giving out this informa
tion would be "too incriminating."
Armed with this information, I
met with University Registrar
Sally Mahoney. In the following
paragraphs I will endeavor to
quote her correctly, or else it is
highly possible that I could wake

up one morning and find that I
had been transferred to Herkimer
County Community College in
upstate New York.
Mahoney said she doubts very
seriously that even if students
were to take classes for one or
two units, they could take no
more than 10 classes because
"they couldn't put them all on
one study list and it would cause
notice."
Ail study lists are audited by
the Registrar's Office to assure
that the classes listed are in range
with the course offerings. Alleged
ly, if a student tries to take a
five-unit course for one unit, the
Registrar will contact the profes
sor and the student in order to
assure that the student will only
be doing an amount of work
equivalent to one unit.
Students not agreeing to reduce
the amount of work will be shot.
Prior to the early 70's, students
with outstanding grade averages
could take excess loads. But in
the early 70's the Faculty Senate
set the normal schedule as 15
units, with students being allowed
to take as many as 20 or as few
as 12. This was done on the theory
that there is more to a Stanford
education than just taking lots of
classes — students need to select
courses which they would study
in depth.

These days, student petitions
to take overload schedules are ac
cepted only for students who need
those few extra units to graduate
or who, because of scheduling con
flicts within a department, have
to take classes which will only be
offered once during the student's
course of study.
Mahoney wants it to be clear,
however, that the Registrar's Of
fice is not in the business of put
ting in procedures which assume
that 100 percent of Stanford stu
dents are trying to take advantage
of the system. Her assumption is
that the Fundamental Standard
applies to creating one's study list
and that students should not be
trying to sneak around the
guidelines which exist "for sub
stantive academic reasons."
Her office is in the business of
"facilitating student accesss to
courses" and not policing incom
ing study lists.
Since no undergrads were will
ing to provide documented proof
of having taken excess schedules,
I guess I'll have to declare myself
the winner of the massive-units
contest with the massive 17 units
I took last quarter. I thus award
myself first prize: A baby oil back
rub from the new Dollies.
Academia is beautiful. Have a
groovy Spring Break!


BUG
ME ,

Dear Bug,
Well, The Daily's losing the bat
tle. It used to be the No. 1 humour
publication on campus, but after
last week's Bug-Me, it has slipped
behind the Chaparral.
Better luck next time.
— Charles A. Parral
Gee, chap, I'm sorry to hear
the Chaparral is your favorite
publication. Unfortunately, due to
demands on office space, the
Chaparral is being evicted from
the publications building under
the auspices of the Federal Wit
less Relocation Program.

Dear Bug,
I was having a conversation
with some of the guys in my office,
and one of them mentioned that
students have "rather limited"
patent rights. Can you tell me
what "rather limited" means? I
mean, if tomorrow I invent glow
in-the-dark condoms and it's the
new nighttime rage in San Fran
cisco and I would normally make
enough money to pay off the na
tional debt and take all of the Bay
Area skiing, is Stanford going to
take it all and thank me for my
donation to the Centennial
fund??? I don't remember signing
anything, but the guys in the office
said that I didn't have to ... that
there was some fine print in the
registration agreement or some
implicit "student slave law" or

some such thing.
Anxious to begin production.
— The Rubber Band
Well, pal, I've got some good news
and some bad news. The good
news is that you probably still
retain all rights to the glow-in
the-dark condoms (Glo-jans). The
bad news is that in this age of
incurable sexually transmitted
diseases, the last thing I'd want
to do during sex would be to look
down and see something glowing.
I'd be the first guy in history to
go to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for a check-up.
But as for the matter at hand,
according to the nice folks at the
Stanford Office of Technology
Licensing ("Do you have a license
for that there stereo, sonny?"), if
you ain't signed anything saying
you give away your rights then
they still belong to you. The only
way you might not have the rights
to an invention would be if you
were working on a government
or private-sector funded project
and had signed an agreement
specifying which rights did or did
not belong to you.
So carrying your example to
nutzoid proportions, let's suppose
that while conducting a perfectly
harmless lab in Physics 59
("Physics of Phallically Cylindri
cal Objects"), you are bitten by a
radioactive TA and drop a condom
into a vat of Something Green
and Glowing. Moments later you
fish the condom out of the vat
and to your surprise discover that
it glows in the dark.
Despite some set-backs during
your field-testing of the product
— like your girlfriend remarking
that she's "been more turned on
looking at the photos of Enrico
Fermi in her physics book"— you
patent the new condoms, sell the
patent to the Goodyear Rubber
Company (also the manufacturers
of a fine line of glow-in-the-dark
snow tires), and take the Bay Area
skiing.
However, being a National Re
search University where Cool
Thingß are invented, the Univer
sity also has a bunch of research

projects being sponsored by dif
ferent businesses and agencies.
The students working on those
projects (usually upper-level grad
students or guys named "Herky")
often sign contracts with phrases
like, "In agreeing to work on this
project, the student surrenders all
their basic constitutional rights
including the right to life, liberty
and the pursuit of hipness." Sign
ing a contract like this could mean
that you have surrendered the
rights to anything you invent.
It's kind of like how Sam
Butera wrote "Just a Gigolo" 30
years ago but didn't bother to
copyright the song. Then David
Lee Roth came along, recorded
the number, copyrighted the ar
rangement and made a zillion dol
lars. Now if Sam Butera wants
to record his own song he has to
pay royalties to David Lee Roth.
It all reminds me of that ancient
Chinese proverb which goes, "Life
is sometimes unfair, but David
Lee Roth is always ugly."
Since obtaining a patent is a
pain in the butt (tail bone), the
Technology Licensing office has a
service where they take your cool
invention and get the patent for
you. The catch is that the
royalties on the sale of the inven
tion are split between you, the
department in which you invented
the stuff and the school.
Presumably, under this option
the Bay Area doesn't get to go
skiing.
Dear Bug,

something was fishy in Thurs

tional debt and take all of the Bay
Area skiing, is Stanford going to
take it all and thank me for my
donation to the Centennial
fund??? I don't remember signing
anything, but the guys in the office
said that I didn't have to ... that
there was some fine print in the
registration agreement or some
implicit "student slave law" or

some such thing.
Anxious to begin production.

Well, pal, I've got some good news
and some bad news. The good
news is that you probably still
retain all rights to the glow-in
the-dark condoms (Glo-jans). The
bad news is that in this age of
incurable sexually transmitted
diseases, the last thing I'd want
to do during sex would be to look
down and see something glowing.
I'd be the first guy in history to
go to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission for a check-up.
But as for the matter at hand,
according to the nice folks at the
Stanford Office of Technology
Licensing ("Do you have a license
for that there stereo, sonny?"), if
you ain't signed anything saying
you give away your rights then
they still belong to you. The only
way you might not have the rights
to an invention would be if you
were working on a government
or private-sector funded project
and had signed an agreement
specifying which rights did or did
not belong to you.
So carrying your example to
nutzoid proportions, let's suppose
that while conducting a perfectly
harmless lab in Physics 59
("Physics of Phallically Cylindri
cal Objects"), you are bitten by a
radioactive TA and drop a condom
into a vat of Something Green
and Glowing. Moments later you
fish the condom out of the vat
and to your surprise discover that
it glows in the dark.
Despite some set-backs during
your field-testing of the product
— like your girlfriend remarking
that she's "been more turned on
looking at the photos of Enrico
Fermi in her physics book"— you
patent the new condoms, sell the
patent to the Goodyear Rubber
Company (also the manufacturers
of a fine line of glow-in-the-dark
snow tires), and take the Bay Area
skiing.
However, being a National Re
search University where Cool
Thingß are invented, the Univer
sity also has a bunch of research

projects being sponsored by dif
ferent businesses and agencies.
The students working on those
projects (usually upper-level grad
students or guys named "Herky")
often sign contracts with phrases
like, "In agreeing to work on this
project, the student surrenders all
their basic constitutional rights
including the right to life, liberty
and the pursuit of hipness." Sign
ing a contract like this could mean
that you have surrendered the
rights to anything you invent.
It's kind of like how Sam
Butera wrote "Just a Gigolo" 30
years ago but didn't bother to
copyright the song. Then David
Lee Roth came along, recorded
the number, copyrighted the ar
rangement and made a zillion dol
lars. Now if Sam Butera wants
to record his own song he has to
pay royalties to David Lee Roth.
It all reminds me of that ancient
Chinese proverb which goes, "Life
is sometimes unfair, but David
Lee Roth is always ugly."
Since obtaining a patent is a
pain in the butt (tail bone), the
Technology Licensing office has a
service where they take your cool
invention and get the patent for
you. The catch is that the
royalties on the sale of the inven
tion are split between you, the
department in which you invented
the stuff and the school.
Presumably, under this option
the Bay Area doesn't get to go
skiing.
Dear Bug,
Please excuse our naivete, but
something was fishy in Thurs
day's "Student Body * Mention
was made of external and internal
water sports in relation to sexually
transmitted diseases. Maybe we're
all wet and hang around comput
ers too much, but we have no idea
what these "sports" could be. Is
deGuerre safe? Please help.

Yes, deGuerre is safe. Thanks
for asking.
Massive Unit-Packed Schedules
Update:

A few weeks back we printed a
question asking what were the
most number of units anyone had
ever taken at Stanford. Not
satisfied with the answers
emanating from Old Union, we
ran a contest to find out if people
had taken huge schedules exceed
ing the 24 or 25 units that the
Registrar's Office claimed were
the upper limits.
You should understand that
these unit limits only apply to
undergrads. Grads don't seem to
have strict limitations, and, in
fact, I received one transcript
from a med student who passed
28 units one quarter; others
claimed to have passed 35 or
more.
Many undergrads wrote in ;
saying that they got around the
unit limit by taking classes for
reduced numbers of units. By list
ing three, four or five unit classes
for one or two units each, you
can cram a whole bunch of classes
into your schedule. Strangely,
nobody was willing to provide doc
umented proof; one student
claimed giving out this informa
tion would be "too incriminating."
Armed with this information, I
met with University Registrar
Sally Mahoney. In the following
paragraphs I will endeavor to
quote her correctly, or else it is
highly possible that I could wake

up one morning and find that I
had been transferred to Herkimer
County Community College in
upstate New York.
Mahoney said she doubts very
seriously that even if students
were to take classes for one or
two units, they could take no
more than 10 classes because
"they couldn't put them all on
one study list and it would cause
notice."
Ail study lists are audited by
the Registrar's Office to assure
that the classes listed are in range
with the course offerings. Alleged
ly, if a student tries to take a
five-unit course for one unit, the
Registrar will contact the profes
sor and the student in order to
assure that the student will only
be doing an amount of work
equivalent to one unit.
Students not agreeing to reduce
the amount of work will be shot.
Prior to the early 70's, students
with outstanding grade averages
could take excess loads. But in
the early 70's the Faculty Senate
set the normal schedule as 15
units, with students being allowed
to take as many as 20 or as few
as 12. This was done on the theory
that there is more to a Stanford
education than just taking lots of
classes — students need to select
courses which they would study
in depth.

These days, student petitions
to take overload schedules are ac
cepted only for students who need
those few extra units to graduate
or who, because of scheduling con
flicts within a department, have
to take classes which will only be
offered once during the student's
course of study.
Mahoney wants it to be clear,
however, that the Registrar's Of
fice is not in the business of put
ting in procedures which assume
that 100 percent of Stanford stu
dents are trying to take advantage
of the system. Her assumption is
that the Fundamental Standard
applies to creating one's study list
and that students should not be
trying to sneak around the
guidelines which exist "for sub
stantive academic reasons."
Her office is in the business of
"facilitating student accesss to
courses" and not policing incom
ing study lists.
Since no undergrads were will
ing to provide documented proof
of having taken excess schedules,
I guess I'll have to declare myself
the winner of the massive-units
contest with the massive 17 units
I took last quarter. I thus award
myself first prize: A baby oil back
rub from the new Dollies.
Academia is beautiful. Have a
groovy Spring Break!
