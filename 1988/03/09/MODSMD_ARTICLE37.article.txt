# Sax player jazzes up interest in activism and art
## 
### Debby Rovine 
Jazz musician Fred Houn is in
tune with the issues facing Stan
ford students — from cultural
biases to parental pressure.
Living in Wilbur Hall this quar
ter as Okada's "artist-in
residence," Houn, a renowned
jazz musician, is generating
greater social awareness and re
sponsibility among Asian-
American students, while teach
ing an Asian-American literature
class here that encourages stu
dents to pursue careers in the
arts.
"We Refuse to be Used and
Abused" is not only the title of
his upcoming album, but also his
philosophy for life. The purpose
of this album is similar to his
goal while at Stanford.
The album, featuring Afro-
Asian music, will hopefully "en
courage people to take control of
their lives, to assert their pride,
their dignity and self-respect ...
to unite with people of all nation
alities," he said. Houn added that
his own jazz group, the Afro-Asian
Music Ensemble, is an integration
of Afro-American jazz and his own

Chinese roots.
As an Asian-American growing
up in the United States, Houn
said he felt that his identity as a
Chinese was threatened. After one
year in the American public school
system, Houn forgot how to speak
Chinese.
"I came to feel ashamed of my
Chinese identity," he said. "I grew
up trying to be accepted in white
society."
But Malcolm X and the black
movement changed Houn's atti
tude. "They made me realize I
was a victim of oppression, and
instead of blaming myself, I came
to see society as a source of my
condition," Houn explained.
When Houn decided to pursue
a professinal career in music, his
identity was again threatened —
his musical identity. According to
Houn, his parents did not con
sider his career choice realistic.
But now, after recording three al
bums, playing for film, theatre
and opera and serving as a
panelist to the New York State
Council on the Arts, Houn has
indeed succeeded.
Having proven that achieve
ment is possible without parental
approval, he urges students at

Stanford to pursue careers that
are meaningful to them — not
their parents.
In high school, Houn was al
ready playing with a professional
jazz band and Archie Shepp, a
"radical sax player." But when he
was an undergraduate studying
sociology at Harvard, Houn still
had no idea that he would become
a professional musician.
While at Harvard, Houn said
he felt discouraged playing music
because it was "so European
oriented."
Although most people consider
European music as "classical,"
Houn said that jazz is America's
classical music. With African
roots, jazz is an American art
form that has "impacted the
world," according to Houn.
Two years after leaving Har
vard, Houn went into construc
tion work because he wanted to
earn fast money and have a "non
academic" experience.
According to Houn, it is impor
tant for all college students to
experience life outside of
academia. Students need to "get
another perspective, a sense of
humility," he said.
During his time as a construc
tion worker, Houn's interest in
music was rejuvinated. Between
construction jobs, he practiced
four to eight hours a day. He even
tually decided to move to New
York City and try for a "break
into the music world."
While earning a living as a
freelance typist, he got his first
break with a local New York band
that played in a small jazz club.
The clubs are "one of the insults
that music is forced to bear,"
Houn said.
"Jazz music has never been
given the concert hall it deserves,"

he said, explaining that in clubs
musicians are often "surrounded
by smoking, drinking and even
some drug dealing."
Prefering concerts and music
festivals to these clubs, Houn said
he eryoys playing where people's
primary interest is music.
While at Stanford, Houn, a sax
player, has performed for stu
dents as well as in San Francisco.

Houn said he sees himself as
both an artist and activist and
that neither are mutually exclu
sive. Because music is not only a
form of entertainment but also
an inspiration for people to work
towards freedom and liberation,
artists have the responsiblity to
be socially active, he said.
Houn has lived up to his role
as a social leader, according to

senior Vivian Wu, one of Houn's
students this quarter. His class
enabled students to meet Asian-
Americans involved in the arts
and the Asian community, she ex
plained.
"Students like Fred because
he's so involved in the communi
ty. He is doing stuff we can see.
His class is not just reading
books," Wu said.

When Houn decided to pursue
a professinal career in music, his
identity was again threatened —
his musical identity. According to
Houn, his parents did not con
sider his career choice realistic.
But now, after recording three al
bums, playing for film, theatre
and opera and serving as a
panelist to the New York State
Council on the Arts, Houn has
indeed succeeded.
Having proven that achieve
ment is possible without parental
approval, he urges students at

Stanford to pursue careers that
are meaningful to them — not
their parents.
In high school, Houn was al
ready playing with a professional
jazz band and Archie Shepp, a
"radical sax player." But when he
was an undergraduate studying
sociology at Harvard, Houn still
had no idea that he would become
a professional musician.
While at Harvard, Houn said
he felt discouraged playing music
because it was "so European
oriented."
Although most people consider
European music as "classical,"
Houn said that jazz is America's
classical music. With African
roots, jazz is an American art
form that has "impacted the
world," according to Houn.
Two years after leaving Har
vard, Houn went into construc
tion work because he wanted to
earn fast money and have a "non
academic" experience.
According to Houn, it is impor
tant for all college students to
experience life outside of
academia. Students need to "get
another perspective, a sense of
humility," he said.
During his time as a construc
tion worker, Houn's interest in
music was rejuvinated. Between
construction jobs, he practiced
four to eight hours a day. He even
tually decided to move to New
York City and try for a "break
into the music world."
While earning a living as a
freelance typist, he got his first
break with a local New York band
that played in a small jazz club.
The clubs are "one of the insults
that music is forced to bear,"
Houn said.
"Jazz music has never been
given the concert hall it deserves,"

he said, explaining that in clubs
musicians are often "surrounded
by smoking, drinking and even
some drug dealing."
Prefering concerts and music
festivals to these clubs, Houn said
he eryoys playing where people's
primary interest is music.
While at Stanford, Houn, a sax
player, has performed for stu
dents as well as in San Francisco.

Houn said he sees himself as
both an artist and activist and
that neither are mutually exclu
sive. Because music is not only a
form of entertainment but also
an inspiration for people to work
towards freedom and liberation,
artists have the responsiblity to
be socially active, he said.
Houn has lived up to his role
as a social leader, according to

senior Vivian Wu, one of Houn's
students this quarter. His class
enabled students to meet Asian-
Americans involved in the arts
and the Asian community, she ex
plained.
"Students like Fred because
he's so involved in the communi
ty. He is doing stuff we can see.
His class is not just reading
books," Wu said.

As the "artist in residence" in Okada this quarter, activist and musician Fred Houn has generated
greater social awareness in the dormitory's students.
Jazz musician Fred Houn is in
tune with the issues facing Stan
ford students — from cultural
biases to parental pressure.
Living in Wilbur Hall this quar
ter as Okada's "artist-in
residence," Houn, a renowned
jazz musician, is generating
greater social awareness and re
sponsibility among Asian-
American students, while teach
ing an Asian-American literature
class here that encourages stu
dents to pursue careers in the
arts.
"We Refuse to be Used and
Abused" is not only the title of
his upcoming album, but also his
philosophy for life. The purpose
of this album is similar to his
goal while at Stanford.
The album, featuring Afro-
Asian music, will hopefully "en
courage people to take control of
their lives, to assert their pride,
their dignity and self-respect ...
to unite with people of all nation
alities," he said. Houn added that
his own jazz group, the Afro-Asian
Music Ensemble, is an integration
of Afro-American jazz and his own

Chinese roots.
As an Asian-American growing
up in the United States, Houn
said he felt that his identity as a
Chinese was threatened. After one
year in the American public school
system, Houn forgot how to speak
Chinese.
"I came to feel ashamed of my
Chinese identity," he said. "I grew
up trying to be accepted in white
society."
But Malcolm X and the black
movement changed Houn's atti
tude. "They made me realize I
was a victim of oppression, and
instead of blaming myself, I came
to see society as a source of my
condition," Houn explained.
