# Ohio governor: Get involved
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld 
"I think the Democrats will
nominate and elect the next
president of the United States,"
the governor of Ohio predicted
Monday night, adding that he
had "no regrets" about his de
cision not to join the presiden
tial race.
In a discussion with about 60
students at Rranner Hall on the
eve of Super Tuesday, Gov.
Richard Celeste and his wife
Dagmar spoke about this year's
presidential campaign, and the
importance of student activism.
Celeste predicted that after
Super Tuesday, Dukakis, Gep
hardt and Jackson would
emerge as viable candidates in
the democratic race. In the Re
publican race, Celeste said that
George Bush is "the only person
who can succeed Ronald Reagan
... and hold all of the party
together."
Celeste himself initially
thought about pursuing the
Democratic nomination, but
decided in the middle of last
year not to run. Celeste said he
was deterred by studies, con
ducted by his staff in July and
August of 1987, which con

eluded that his run for the dem
ocratic nomination would cost
more than $6 million and re
quire him to establish strong
support in at least 25 states in
the following three months.
In what was "not an easy de
cision," Celeste said he decided
he could not devote enough time
and effort to a "long shot" and
still be a responsible governor.
However, many believe
Celeste dropped his presidential
bid because of a Gary Hart-like
scandal in which he was accused
of having at least three affairs
during his tenure as lieutenant
governor in Ohio. In April 1987,
the accusations became public
when the Cleveland Plain
Dealer published a series of
three articles on the scandals,
in the midst of Hart's own
troubles.
Celeste defended himself by
arguing that a candidate's per
sonal life is "none of the media's
business," unless they can dem
onstrate it "directly affects his
ability to do a job." The country
has "no uniform standard" by
which to judge an official's per
formance based on his personal
life, and it would be "impossible

to apply [one]" because of
peoples' different moral stand
ards, he said.
Dagmar Celeste defended her
husband by asking whether it
was "better or worse, morally
speaking, to betray your wife
and stay with her or to betray
your wife and divorce her."
"No one asked Ronald Reagan
or Bob Dole" if infidelity was
involved in their divorces, she
said.
It takes time, persistence and
perserverance to hold a relation
ship together — the very
qualities needed to achieve
peace, she said. "These charac
teristics are not valued yet" by
society, she said, adding that
they should be.
Both the governor and his
wife argued that by adopting
these characteristics, today's
college students can, and will,
make a difference in the world.
The Celestes, who met while
protesting nuclear weapons at
Oxford University in England,
dismissed allegations that
today's college students are
more apathetic and self
centered than their counter
parts from the 19605.
