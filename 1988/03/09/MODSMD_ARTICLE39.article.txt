# For some, suntans are second to service

Rather than spending Spring break with a
bottle of Savage Tan, many Stanford students
have opted for service and educational proj
ects, which will take them from San Fran
cisco s Tenderloin district to Managua,
Nicaragua. *
While some students go abroad to promote
international understanding, others plan to
stay in the area to work with the homeless
and on local environmental issues.
The 12 students in the Stanford Soviet Ex
change Project will spend two weeks in the
Soviet Union, dividing their time between
tours of Moscow and Leningrad and a week
long stay with students at the University of
Novosibirsk in Siberia.
Sophomore Liz Perez, who is planning an
evening of American culture for the Soviet
hosts, likened the project to citizen diplomacy.
"We hope to break down the stereotypes
that stand between the United States and the
Soviet Union. It's especially exciting because
the students we'll be meeting will someday
be Soviet leaders, at least in scientific areas,"
Perez said.
Another group — 15 Stanford students
sponsored by a Palo Alto-based educational

foundation — will go to Nicaragua to gain a
better understanding of its political situation
and donate three days of service to community
projects, according to Steve Babb, a local vol
unteer.
Students will spend most of their time in
the capital, Managua, meeting with key
players from a wide variety of political fronts,
Babb added. In addition to meeting represen
tatives from religious groups and journalists
from La Prensa, the country's volatile oppo
sition newspaper, the group will also hear
presentations from members of the San
danista government.
Babb, who is also regional coordinator for
the Stanford Overseas Development Network,
said he hopes the group's stay with families
in Managua would balance the official per
spective from the government.
"I think we'll get beyond the rhetoric to
get a sense of what average Nicaraguans are
facing in their daily lives," Babb said.
Junior Melissa Pashigian, coordinator of the
Public Service Center's two Spring break proj
ects, also stressed how important it is that
students gain practical experience whenever
they can.
In one of these projects, 15 students will
work with the U.S. Forest Service to plant
trees in the Stanislaus National Forest in

Northern California, where 154,000 acres
were destroyed by fires last summer. In ad
dition, students will learn about ethical issues
ranging over a broad spectrum of environ
mental topics, Pashigian said.
Pashigian will also work with another group
of 15 students volunteering their services to
Bay Area agencies that aid the homeless. Their
experience will include a day with Palo Alto's
Urban Ministry and two days and nights in
a Tenderloin district shelter for homeless
families.
"There's only so much you can learn in the
classroom.... Our service won't make a huge
impact in four or five days, but we'll have
made huge steps in learning about the realities
of the environment and the homeless," Pas
higian said.
Dave Sutton, director of internships for the
Human Biology Department, said he will take
a group of students to the San Mateo County
Environmental School. As part of Stanford's
adopt-a-school program, Sutton and 10 Stan
ford undergraduates will help the school's 15
resident naturalists teach sth and 6th graders
about the environment.
Sutton said he hoped the project will help
environmental issues find a place in the main
stream curriculum at San Mateo schools as
well as at Stanford.
