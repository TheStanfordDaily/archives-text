# Stanford workers attack 'negligence'
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
The head of the United Stan
ford Workers yesterday
charged that the University
has jeopardized the safety of
Stanford employees by subor
dinating health and safety pro
grams to University interests.
Linda Crouse, chief steward
of the union, criticized a report
on University health and safety
conditions released Friday be
cause it includes no proposal
"for any involvement of union
workers" in future health and
safety programs.
"Workers who have most
direct contact with the chemi
cals — practical knowledge of
them — and are most directly
affected" by health and safety
policies should have some say
in the implementation and en
forcement of the policies, she
said.
The commissioner of the in
dependent investigation is
suing the report, University Di
rector of Internal Audit Peter
Millington, declined to com
ment yesterday, saying he was
"unaware" of the union's
response to the study.
According to Crouse, the un
ion has had little say in health
and safety issues since 1982,
when the University adminis

tration weakened the powers
of a joint union/University
committee on health and
safety, making it "virtually in
operative." She explained that
the administration was able to
get language revisions in the
1982 USW contract that "left
the joint committee ineffective
and the workers unprotected."
Crouse said the University
sought to undermine the com
mittee because it regularly un
covered University health and
safety violations and corrected
them in the interest of the
workers, which sometimes con
flicted with University inter
ests.
The University's chief labor
negotiator, Pricilla Wheeler,
was unavailable for comment
yesterday.
Crouse argued that "the
hard-line bargaining done by
Wheeler at the negotiating
table" has had negative effects
on the health and safety of the
workers."
Crouse said many managers
in the University are often "so
unconcerned about health and
safety that they will go to the
extent of docking the pay of a
worker willing to take the in
itiative" to make working con
ditions safer, when "it should
have been the manager's re
sponsibility in the first place."
