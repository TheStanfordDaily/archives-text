## Do the Wildcats hold the trump Card? Men's hoops outlasts Trojans 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES -
In order to save
time on Saturday,
the Los Angeles
Sports Arena an
nouncer could
have announced

the names of the fans rather than
go through all those players.
But that wouldn't have done
justice to either the USC Trojans,
who played their hearts out
despite their dismal record, or the
Stanford Cardinal players, who
fought off a second half Trojan
comeback and held on for a 73-65
victory.
A sparse crowd of 2,025 showed
up for the USC-Stanford game,
sandwiched between four high
school championship games that
drew between 7,000 and 10,000
fans.
Those who did stay around for
the "other" game witnessed a
strong Stanford inside game and
a resilient USC squad, which
never let the Cardinal make the
game a blow-out and made things
interesting at the end.
Cardinal 6-foot-11 center Greg
Butler poured in 25 points and
6-foot-8 Howard Wright tallied 18
over the shorter Trojan front line,
and teammates Terry Taylor and
Bryan McSweeney sank four free
throws in the final seconds to seal
the win.
The victory closed Stanford's
regular season record at 19-10
overall, 11-7 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. The Cardinal's confer
ence record was its best ever since
the Pac-8 became the Pac-10, but
was only good enough for fourth

place. USC dropped to 7-20, 5-13.
Stanford rebounded from the
missed opportunity last Thursday
at UCLA, where a win would have
added to the historical signifi
cance of this Cardinal season.
"We were better prepared men
tally today and did a better job
than the other night against
UCLA," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We had some
thing to play for all year and then
Oregon State took it away (OSU
defeated Stanford last week in a
battle for second place), but now
it's tournament time and we're
getting it back."
Stanford will play the Oregon
Ducks in the opening round of
the Pac-10 tournament on Friday
in Tucson.
The Cardinal seemed to have
things well in hand in the second
half, leading USC 60-45 with 7:28
left in the game. But at that point,
Montgomery took guard Todd
Lichti out of the game for a rest.
Lichti had been shutting down
the Trojan shooting guards, but
when he took a seat on the pine,
Trojan Andy Olivarez started
lighting up the scoreboard.
Olivarez came off picks to hit
two straight three-point shots
from exactly the same spot, just
to the right of the top of the key.
"I wanted to give Todd some
rest, and his sub wasn't as used
to running through the screen
and boom — [Olivarezl hits two
in a row," Montgomery said.
"That put some fire in them."
Butler had a chance to put the
fire out, but twice missed the
front ends of one-and-ones. Two
Trojans named Chris, Moore and

Senior center Greg Butler finished his final regular season game
In style by scoring a game-high 25 points in Stanford's win at USC.
The Cardinal will face Oregon Friday at the Pacific 10 Conference
Tournament.
Munk, responded with two free
throws and an odd-looking hook
shot to narrow the lead to 60-55
with 5:30 remaining.
The two teams traded tense
baskets until Butler missed a
jump shot and Ronnie Coleman
responded with a turnaround
jump shot from the baseline to
cut the score to 66-63 with 2:29
on the clock.
Stanford needed a hoop badly
and went back inside to Butler,
who took a nifty pass from
McSweeney and laid it off the

glass to put the Stanford lead back
to five points.
"We allowed Stanford to stay
too low in there (on offense),"
USC Coach George Raveling said.
"We tried to adjust, but Butler
and Wright hurt us down low."
Coleman came back with a
clutch hook shot at the:47 mark,
but then the Trojans had a mental
lapse. USC let Stanford play keep
away until Rich Grande finally
fouled Taylor with 18 seconds left.
Taylor sank two free throws and
Stanford led 72-65.
The Trojans tried to get the
ball to Olivarez for a three-point
attempt, but when Grande
dribbled in the wrong direction

and then had to shout at Olivarez
to make his cut, the Men of Troy
were doomed.
"All those Stanford guys got
1400 on their SATs and they un
derstand English," Raveling said.
"If we'd played another team,
maybe it would have worked, but
Stanford picked it right up."
Indeed, instead of joining the
Trojans in their Keystone Kops
routine, Stanford stayed tight on
defense and McSweeney drew a
charge from Olivarez, who was
trying to get to the left corner.
McSweeney sank two free throws
and Taylor added two more to
end the contest.

sandwiched between four high
school championship games that
drew between 7,000 and 10,000
fans.
Those who did stay around for
the "other" game witnessed a
strong Stanford inside game and
a resilient USC squad, which
never let the Cardinal make the
game a blow-out and made things
interesting at the end.
Cardinal 6-foot-11 center Greg
Butler poured in 25 points and
6-foot-8 Howard Wright tallied 18
over the shorter Trojan front line,
and teammates Terry Taylor and
Bryan McSweeney sank four free
throws in the final seconds to seal
the win.
The victory closed Stanford's
regular season record at 19-10
overall, 11-7 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. The Cardinal's confer
ence record was its best ever since
the Pac-8 became the Pac-10, but
was only good enough for fourth

place. USC dropped to 7-20, 5-13.
Stanford rebounded from the
missed opportunity last Thursday
at UCLA, where a win would have
added to the historical signifi
cance of this Cardinal season.
"We were better prepared men
tally today and did a better job
than the other night against
UCLA," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We had some
thing to play for all year and then
Oregon State took it away (OSU
defeated Stanford last week in a
battle for second place), but now
it's tournament time and we're
getting it back."
Stanford will play the Oregon
Ducks in the opening round of
the Pac-10 tournament on Friday
in Tucson.
The Cardinal seemed to have
things well in hand in the second
half, leading USC 60-45 with 7:28
left in the game. But at that point,
Montgomery took guard Todd
Lichti out of the game for a rest.
Lichti had been shutting down
the Trojan shooting guards, but
when he took a seat on the pine,
Trojan Andy Olivarez started
lighting up the scoreboard.
Olivarez came off picks to hit
two straight three-point shots
from exactly the same spot, just
to the right of the top of the key.
"I wanted to give Todd some
rest, and his sub wasn't as used
to running through the screen
and boom — [Olivarezl hits two
in a row," Montgomery said.
"That put some fire in them."
Butler had a chance to put the
fire out, but twice missed the
front ends of one-and-ones. Two
Trojans named Chris, Moore and

Senior center Greg Butler finished his final regular season game
In style by scoring a game-high 25 points in Stanford's win at USC.
The Cardinal will face Oregon Friday at the Pacific 10 Conference
Tournament.
Munk, responded with two free
throws and an odd-looking hook
shot to narrow the lead to 60-55
with 5:30 remaining.
The two teams traded tense
baskets until Butler missed a
jump shot and Ronnie Coleman
responded with a turnaround
jump shot from the baseline to
cut the score to 66-63 with 2:29
on the clock.
Stanford needed a hoop badly
and went back inside to Butler,
who took a nifty pass from
McSweeney and laid it off the

glass to put the Stanford lead back
to five points.
"We allowed Stanford to stay
too low in there (on offense),"
USC Coach George Raveling said.
"We tried to adjust, but Butler
and Wright hurt us down low."
Coleman came back with a
clutch hook shot at the:47 mark,
but then the Trojans had a mental
lapse. USC let Stanford play keep
away until Rich Grande finally
fouled Taylor with 18 seconds left.
Taylor sank two free throws and
Stanford led 72-65.
The Trojans tried to get the
ball to Olivarez for a three-point
attempt, but when Grande
dribbled in the wrong direction

and then had to shout at Olivarez
to make his cut, the Men of Troy
were doomed.
"All those Stanford guys got
1400 on their SATs and they un
derstand English," Raveling said.
"If we'd played another team,
maybe it would have worked, but
Stanford picked it right up."
Indeed, instead of joining the
Trojans in their Keystone Kops
routine, Stanford stayed tight on
defense and McSweeney drew a
charge from Olivarez, who was
trying to get to the left corner.
McSweeney sank two free throws
and Taylor added two more to
end the contest.
LOS ANGELES -
In order to save
time on Saturday,
the Los Angeles
Sports Arena an
nouncer could
have announced

the names of the fans rather than
go through all those players.
But that wouldn't have done
justice to either the USC Trojans,
who played their hearts out
despite their dismal record, or the
Stanford Cardinal players, who
fought off a second half Trojan
comeback and held on for a 73-65
victory.
A sparse crowd of 2,025 showed
up for the USC-Stanford game,
sandwiched between four high
school championship games that
drew between 7,000 and 10,000
fans.
