## Do the Wildcats hold the trump Card? Men's hoops outlasts Trojans 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES -
In order to save
time on Saturday,
the Los Angeles
Sports Arena an
nouncer could
have announced

the names of the fans rather than
go through all those players.
But that wouldn't have done
justice to either the USC Trojans,
who played their hearts out
despite their dismal record, or the
Stanford Cardinal players, who
fought off a second half Trojan
comeback and held on for a 73-65
victory.
A sparse crowd of 2,025 showed
up for the USC-Stanford game,
sandwiched between four high
school championship games that
drew between 7,000 and 10,000
fans.
Those who did stay around for
the "other" game witnessed a
strong Stanford inside game and
a resilient USC squad, which
never let the Cardinal make the
game a blow-out and made things
interesting at the end.
Cardinal 6-foot-11 center Greg
Butler poured in 25 points and
6-foot-8 Howard Wright tallied 18
over the shorter Trojan front line,
and teammates Terry Taylor and
Bryan McSweeney sank four free
throws in the final seconds to seal
the win.
The victory closed Stanford's
regular season record at 19-10
overall, 11-7 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. The Cardinal's confer
ence record was its best ever since
the Pac-8 became the Pac-10, but
was only good enough for fourth

place. USC dropped to 7-20, 5-13.
Stanford rebounded from the
missed opportunity last Thursday
at UCLA, where a win would have
added to the historical signifi
cance of this Cardinal season.
"We were better prepared men
tally today and did a better job
than the other night against
UCLA," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We had some
thing to play for all year and then
Oregon State took it away (OSU
defeated Stanford last week in a
battle for second place), but now
it's tournament time and we're
getting it back."
Stanford will play the Oregon
Ducks in the opening round of
the Pac-10 tournament on Friday
in Tucson.
The Cardinal seemed to have
things well in hand in the second
half, leading USC 60-45 with 7:28
left in the game. But at that point,
Montgomery took guard Todd
Lichti out of the game for a rest.
Lichti had been shutting down
the Trojan shooting guards, but
when he took a seat on the pine,
Trojan Andy Olivarez started
lighting up the scoreboard.
Olivarez came off picks to hit
two straight three-point shots
from exactly the same spot, just
to the right of the top of the key.
"I wanted to give Todd some
rest, and his sub wasn't as used
to running through the screen
and boom — [Olivarezl hits two
in a row," Montgomery said.
"That put some fire in them."
Butler had a chance to put the
fire out, but twice missed the
front ends of one-and-ones. Two
Trojans named Chris, Moore and



Richard Murphy — Daily
Senior center Greg Butler finished his final regular season game
In style by scoring a game-high 25 points in Stanford's win at USC.
The Cardinal will face Oregon Friday at the Pacific 10 Conference
Tournament.
