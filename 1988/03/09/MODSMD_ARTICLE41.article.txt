# Arizona hosts Pac-10 tourney
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Take the best team by far in
the Pacific 10 Conference and
plop them down in their own den
for four days, and what have you
got? The Pac-10 Tournament, an
Arizona romp, or both.
Stanford, the only conference
team to have beaten the third
ranked Wildcats this season, will
meet the Oregon Ducks in the
first round of the tournament Fri
day at Arizona's McKale Center
in Tucson.
The 1 p.m. contest between the
fourth-seeded Cardinal (19-10
overall, 11-7 in the Pac-10) and
the fifth-seeded Ducks (15-12, 10-
8) will be broadcast live on ESPN.
The tournament begins tomor
row at 7 p.m. with seed No. 8
USC (7-20, 5-13) facing No. 9 Cal
ifornia (8-18, 5-13), followed by
No. 7 Arizona State (13-14, 6-12)
against No. 10 Washington (9-18,
5-13), which will be broadcast on
ESPN.
After the Stanford game Friday,
Arizona (28-2, 17-1) will play the
California-USC winner at 4 p.m.,
and Oregon State (18-9,12-6) will
meet the ASU-Washington victor.
At 9 p.m. on ESPN, UCLA (15-13,
12-6) will face the Washington
State Cougars (11-15, 7-11).
The championship game will be
broadcast on ABC Sunday at 1
p.m.
In a telephone conference Mon
day, most of the Pac-10 coaches
said that although having the
tournament at Arizona this year
will give the conference more ex
posure, the tourney should be
held at a neutral site in the future.
USC Coach George Raveling,

whose team will face California
tomorrow for the right to play
Arizona, joked, "With Lou (Cam
panelli, California's coach) and I
being Catholic, I think we ought
to rent a priest to lead us out
onto the floor."
Stanford and Oregon split their
regular season contests, with
Oregon winning in Eugene 80-66,
and Stanford returning the favor
at home, 84-61. According to the
coaches, the 30-point swing be
tween the outcomes resulted
largely from the home court sit
uation, but Friday they will be
playing on a neutral site.
"(Guards Todd) Lichti and
(Terry) Taylor hurt me real bad
at Stanford, but their strength is
really (Greg) Butler and (Howard)
Wright inside," Oregon Coach
Don Munson said Monday. Mun
son also said that because of Stan
ford's size, he will not start with
the three-guard lineup that he has
used recently.
Stanford Head Coach Mike
Montgomery will be looking for
the Cardinal's first 20-win season
in many a moon when he faces
the rubber Duck game.
"Oregon was hungrier up there,
and it was the opposite down
here," Montgomery said. "The 20-
game plateau would be a nice
thing to achieve at Stanford now.
We would like to have a chance
to play Arizona again, but I think
that one thing is obvious — nei
ther Monson nor I will prepare
for Arizona — you'll see two
teams ready to play one another
on Friday."
The winner of the Stanford-
Oregon game plays the winner of
the Arizona contest at 1 p.m. Sat
urday.
Card and Pac-10 notes
Arizona Head Coach Lute Olson
gave Stanford a vote of confidence
Monday by naming the Cardinal as
his favorite for a chance to be the
second Pac-10 bid into the NCAA
tournament. "I like Stanford and I
think they could compete with
anybody we've seen this year," Ol
son said. "I felt (after Stanford
defeated Arizona last month) at that

point that Stanford played better
than anybody we've played all year
— better than Syracuse, Duke, etc."
Lichti needs 47 points to become
Stanford's all-time leading scorer
this weekend. The junior guard has
scored 1,569 points in 87 games,
which places him third, behind John
Revelli (1,592 in 100 games) and
Kimberly Belton (1,615 in 107
games).
The rumor mill in Los Angeles
has two dandies. UCLA sophomore
forward Trevor Wilson may be
transferring (possibly to North
Carolina State) if Walt Hazzard is
still the Bruin coach next year. In

addition, super-recruit Don
Maclean will go to UCLA only if
Hazzard departs.
Across town at USC, nobody
seems to care about the Trojans.
After 2,025 fans showed up (offi
cially, that is — 1,200 might be a
better estimate). Coach Raveling
had this to say: "There's nobody
left but the coaches and players.
Everyone else has abandoned us.
But as long as we don't give up on
each other, we'll be OK."
The All-Pac-10 Team, Player and
Coach of the Year Awards will be
announced tomorrow at the tour
nament tip-off luncheon.
