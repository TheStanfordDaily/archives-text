# UCLA bows down to Stanford freshman phenoms
## 
### Robert Portnoy Editorial staff 
For the next two
weeks, the Stan
ford baseball
coaching staff will
be paying homage
to the recruiting
gods. While the

Cardinal players are concentrat
ing on their final exams, Coach
Mark Marquess and his cohorts
can ponder how fortunate they
were to land freshmen hurlers
Mike Mussina and Stan Spencer.
At Sunken Diamond Friday, the
Cardinal dropped a 6-3, 10-inning
heartbreaker in the series-opener
against Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division rival UCLA.
Stanford ace Lee Plemel struck
out a career-high 15 batters only
to lose a 3-0 lead in the ninth.
That left the task of salvaging the
three-game set in the waiting
right hands of Stanford's two
first-year phenoms.
Mussina (4-1) responded by
going the distance Saturday,
giving up four runs on eight hits,
three of which were solo homers.
He fanned six, walked just two
and worked out of jams in both
the eighth and ninth to polish off
the potent Bruin bats. The Car
dinal's 11-4 shellacking of UCLA
set up Sunday's rubber game.
Given what Marquess called the
"toughest assignment" of the se
ries, Spencer (4-1) mastered the
frustrated Bruins through nine
innings Sunday, scattering eight
hits and allowing just one run.
Spencer did not issue a single
walk and struck out seven. Stan
ford tallied three in the first and
two in the eighth to give Spencer
all the cushion he needed.

The 5-1 victory left Stanford at
16-6 and 4-1 in the Six-Pac, just
one-half game behind first-place
California (17-6, 5-1), which last
weekend took two of three from
Arizona in Tucson. The Cardinal
will resume Six-Pac play March
19-21 at Sunken Diamond against
the Wildcats.
"To lose a game like that first
one and then be able come back
with two freshmen is just great,"
Marquess said.
If not for a bit of bad luck in
the ninth inning Friday, Plemel's
gem would also have been without
defect. Plemel opened the inning
with a strikeout, then watched
Bruin designated hitter Joe James
— who was 8-for-13 with 4
homers in the series — loft what
appeared to be a lazy fly ball to
right. Stanford right fielder Paul
Carey continued to move slowly
back on the ball until he ran out
of room. The wind-aided four
bagger gave the Bruins life, and
the next batter, right fielder Jeff
Osborn, kept things going with a
bloop-single to right. Plemel then
worked UCLA second baseman
Bobby Holley to a 3-2 count.
"On the first homerun, if the
wind wasn't blowing the way it
was, it wouldn't have gone out.
The second one was a bad slider.
It wasn't the same slider I'd been
throwing all game," Plemel said.
Holley's two-run blast carried
over the pine trees beyond the
left-field fence and brought the
Bruins even at 3-3. The Cardinal
failed to score in the bottom of
the inning, and the Bruins were
faced with Stanford's top reliever,
Steve Chitren, in the top of the
10th.
Left fielder Robbie KatzarofT
led off with a single and was

bunted to second. Despite being
berated mercilessly by the Stan
ford faithful sitting above the
Bruin dugout, third baseman
Scott Cline — spelled with a cap
ital after fanning four
straight times against Plemel —
promptly singled in the go-ahead
run. Then first baseman Eric Kar
ros — hitless with three strike
outs in his first four at-bats —
took a 1-2 offering from Chitren
deep over the left-field wall to seal
the 6-3 win.
"[Chitren] hasn't been consis
tent. Some days he doesn't have
the same kind of life on the
fastball, but he'll be all right.
That's the nature of being a
reliever. It's feast or famine," said
Tom Dunton, the Cardinal pitch
ing coach.
Indeed. Cardinal batters feasted
on everything the UCLA pitchers
— starter and relievers alike —
threw at them in Saturday's rout.
First baseman Ron Witmeyer was
3-for-4 with two singles, a double
and four RBI. Third baseman Ed
Sprague went 2-for-3 on a double
and a two-run homer. Freshman
Mike Eicher, platooning in center
with junior Eric DeGraw, had
three singles in four trips and
scored a run. Second baseman
Frank Carey had two hits of his
own, knocking in one run and
scoring another. Shortstop Troy
Paulsen, who continued his hot
hitting with a torrid 5-for-12 se
ries, added an RBI.
The Cardinal hit parade cooled
down in Sunday's game, but
stayed hot just long enough to
push three runs across in the bot
tom of the first. Designated hitter
Jeff Saenger's two-run double
highlighted the rally.

Sophomore Paul Carey and his teammates on the defending NCAA champion Stanford baseball team

Tom Dunton, the Cardinal pitch
ing coach.
Indeed. Cardinal batters feasted
on everything the UCLA pitchers
— starter and relievers alike —
threw at them in Saturday's rout.
First baseman Ron Witmeyer was
3-for-4 with two singles, a double
and four RBI. Third baseman Ed
Sprague went 2-for-3 on a double
and a two-run homer. Freshman
Mike Eicher, platooning in center
with junior Eric DeGraw, had
three singles in four trips and
scored a run. Second baseman
Frank Carey had two hits of his
own, knocking in one run and
scoring another. Shortstop Troy
Paulsen, who continued his hot
hitting with a torrid 5-for-12 se
ries, added an RBI.
The Cardinal hit parade cooled
down in Sunday's game, but
stayed hot just long enough to
push three runs across in the bot
tom of the first. Designated hitter
Jeff Saenger's two-run double
highlighted the rally.

Sophomore Paul Carey and his teammates on the defending NCAA champion Stanford baseball team
ended the weekend stronger than they began it, rebounding from a 10th-inning 6-3 loss on Friday
to post an 11-4 win Saturday and a 5-1 victory Sunday against UCLA.
For the next two
weeks, the Stan
ford baseball
coaching staff will
be paying homage
to the recruiting
gods. While the

Cardinal players are concentrat
ing on their final exams, Coach
Mark Marquess and his cohorts
can ponder how fortunate they
were to land freshmen hurlers
Mike Mussina and Stan Spencer.
At Sunken Diamond Friday, the
Cardinal dropped a 6-3, 10-inning
heartbreaker in the series-opener
against Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division rival UCLA.
Stanford ace Lee Plemel struck
out a career-high 15 batters only
to lose a 3-0 lead in the ninth.
That left the task of salvaging the
three-game set in the waiting
right hands of Stanford's two
first-year phenoms.
Mussina (4-1) responded by
going the distance Saturday,
giving up four runs on eight hits,
three of which were solo homers.
He fanned six, walked just two
and worked out of jams in both
the eighth and ninth to polish off
the potent Bruin bats. The Car
dinal's 11-4 shellacking of UCLA
set up Sunday's rubber game.
Given what Marquess called the
"toughest assignment" of the se
ries, Spencer (4-1) mastered the
frustrated Bruins through nine
innings Sunday, scattering eight
hits and allowing just one run.
Spencer did not issue a single
walk and struck out seven. Stan
ford tallied three in the first and
two in the eighth to give Spencer
all the cushion he needed.

The 5-1 victory left Stanford at
16-6 and 4-1 in the Six-Pac, just
one-half game behind first-place
California (17-6, 5-1), which last
weekend took two of three from
Arizona in Tucson. The Cardinal
will resume Six-Pac play March
19-21 at Sunken Diamond against
the Wildcats.
"To lose a game like that first
one and then be able come back
with two freshmen is just great,"
Marquess said.
If not for a bit of bad luck in
the ninth inning Friday, Plemel's
gem would also have been without
defect. Plemel opened the inning
with a strikeout, then watched
Bruin designated hitter Joe James
— who was 8-for-13 with 4
homers in the series — loft what
appeared to be a lazy fly ball to
right. Stanford right fielder Paul
Carey continued to move slowly
back on the ball until he ran out
of room. The wind-aided four
bagger gave the Bruins life, and
the next batter, right fielder Jeff
Osborn, kept things going with a
bloop-single to right. Plemel then
worked UCLA second baseman
Bobby Holley to a 3-2 count.
"On the first homerun, if the
wind wasn't blowing the way it
was, it wouldn't have gone out.
The second one was a bad slider.
It wasn't the same slider I'd been
throwing all game," Plemel said.
Holley's two-run blast carried
over the pine trees beyond the
left-field fence and brought the
Bruins even at 3-3. The Cardinal
failed to score in the bottom of
the inning, and the Bruins were
faced with Stanford's top reliever,
Steve Chitren, in the top of the
10th.
Left fielder Robbie KatzarofT
led off with a single and was

bunted to second. Despite being
berated mercilessly by the Stan
ford faithful sitting above the
Bruin dugout, third baseman
Scott Cline — spelled with a cap
ital after fanning four
straight times against Plemel —
promptly singled in the go-ahead
run. Then first baseman Eric Kar
ros — hitless with three strike
outs in his first four at-bats —
took a 1-2 offering from Chitren
deep over the left-field wall to seal
the 6-3 win.
"[Chitren] hasn't been consis
tent. Some days he doesn't have
the same kind of life on the
fastball, but he'll be all right.
That's the nature of being a
reliever. It's feast or famine," said
Tom Dunton, the Cardinal pitch
ing coach.
