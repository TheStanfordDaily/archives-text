# Women's swimmers place NCAA bets
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
While it is now put-up
or-shut-up time in col
legiate women's swim
ming, it looks like only
two schools are
prepared to ante up for
the biggest hand of the

year. The NCAA championships begin
a week from tomorrow in Austin,
Texas, and although the field is full
of strong teams, the meet appears to
be reduced to a duel between Stanford
and host Texas.
The Cardinal and the Longhorns
have spent this season knocking off
all challengers with ease (both top
teams buried third-ranked California
last month and Texas defeated No. 4
Florida 75-29 in January) and observ
ers wouldn't miss much if they spent
next weekend following only those
wearing burnt orange or cardinal.
Texas, the nation's top-ranked
squad, comes in as the favorite by
virtue of a 90-50 dual meet win over

Stanford on Feb. 6, and also has the
home-pool advantage. But the Stan
ford swimmers are prepared to provide
a roadblock for the Longhorns' drive
for a fifth consecutive national title.
Stanford, like Texas, brings in 17
swimmers, the maximum allowed, and
all have the potential to score points
at the meet.
Sophomore Lisa Gillespie, the 17th
member of the Cardinal squad, just
qualified Saturday at the Stanford In
vitational, swimming the 200-yard
freestyle in 1:49.34, a mere .05 seconds
under the standard.
"I think we have a great chance of
winning," junior Susan Lenth said.
"Every single person has a chance to
score really well."
Stanford also has a strong diving
squad led by sophomore Katie Con
nors, the one-meter, three-meter and
platform champion at the Pacific 10
Conference championships. Senior
Kleinheksel will be diving at a
zone meet at Brigham Young this
weekend and has a strong chance to
qualify for NCAAs at that meet.

The Longhorns have not lost a dual
meet in over two years and this year's
squad is definitely capable of winning
national title No. 5, but the Cardinal
swimmers are conceding nothing.
After losing by a miniscule 17-point
margin last season, Stanford feels it
has the edge this time around.
"I think we won mentally last year,"
Lenth said. "They came out of the
meet down and we came out up. .. .
I think they know (Stanford is right
there) now."
Junior Michelle Donahue explained
that a lack of confidence at the start
of last year's meet may have caused
the team to fall behind 17 points too
many. "If we just get our momentum
early (this year).... We didn't last
year. We outswam them last year. ...
(But winning) wasn't as realistic until
the second or third day."
"You get kind of sick of it (Texas'
winning national titles)," she added.
"It would be nice to dethrone them,
especially in Austin, and I think it can
be done."
The challengers will be led by double

defending champion Jenna Johnson.
The junior has won both the 50 and
100 free each of the past two years
and was runner-up in the 100 butterfly
last season after winning that event
as a freshman.
Senior tri-captain Susan Rapp is the
defending titlist in the 200 breast
stroke and is also a force in the 100
breast and the 200 individual medley,
events in which she was the runner-up
last season. Additionally, Lenth and
sophomores Bethanne Lambert and
Jill Johnson are all likely candidates
to reach the final in either or both
breaststroke events.
They will have a lot of competition
there, however, as they will face
defending 100 breast champion Tracey
McFarlane of Texas; her freshman
teammate, Susan Johnson, who has
defeated McFarlane many times this
year; and California freshman Hiroko
Nagasaki, who has the nation's best
times this season in both events.
Donahue will lead a very strong
Stanford backstroke contingent.

meet in over two years and this year's
squad is definitely capable of winning
national title No. 5, but the Cardinal
swimmers are conceding nothing.
After losing by a miniscule 17-point
margin last season, Stanford feels it
has the edge this time around.
"I think we won mentally last year,"
Lenth said. "They came out of the
meet down and we came out up. .. .
I think they know (Stanford is right
there) now."
Junior Michelle Donahue explained
that a lack of confidence at the start
of last year's meet may have caused
the team to fall behind 17 points too
many. "If we just get our momentum
early (this year).... We didn't last
year. We outswam them last year. ...
(But winning) wasn't as realistic until
the second or third day."
"You get kind of sick of it (Texas'
winning national titles)," she added.
"It would be nice to dethrone them,
especially in Austin, and I think it can
be done."
The challengers will be led by double

defending champion Jenna Johnson.
The junior has won both the 50 and
100 free each of the past two years
and was runner-up in the 100 butterfly
last season after winning that event
as a freshman.
Senior tri-captain Susan Rapp is the
defending titlist in the 200 breast
stroke and is also a force in the 100
breast and the 200 individual medley,
events in which she was the runner-up
last season. Additionally, Lenth and
sophomores Bethanne Lambert and
Jill Johnson are all likely candidates
to reach the final in either or both
breaststroke events.
They will have a lot of competition
there, however, as they will face
defending 100 breast champion Tracey
McFarlane of Texas; her freshman
teammate, Susan Johnson, who has
defeated McFarlane many times this
year; and California freshman Hiroko
Nagasaki, who has the nation's best
times this season in both events.
Donahue will lead a very strong
Stanford backstroke contingent.
