# Crew splashes Davis, UCSB

### Don Hogue 
They only began
rowing in their
new squads Thurs
day, but both the
Stanford men's
and women's crew
teams proved Sat-

urday that lack of practice can
sometimes make perfect.
Stanford had nearly a complete
sweep of the UC-Davis and UC-
Santa Barbara crews en route to
victories in the men's and wom
en's varsity eights as well as both
junior varsity races. The men's
freshman eight were surprised by

UCSB, as the Gauchos out
stroked Stanford by 12 seconds
over the 2.5-mile course in San
Francisco Bay.
"I think every one of the five
Stanford eights all stuck with the
race plan they set out to row no
matter where they stood in the
race," Stanford Men's Coach Ken
Dreyfuss said.
Saturday's regatta against
Davis and UCSB was billed pri
marily as a tune-up for the season,
as each of the remaining regattas
pits Stanford against a na
tional rowing power. "We'll have
to have total focus, a good plan
and a lot of heart to do well this

season," Dreyfuss added.
"We've got quite a bit of talent
on the varsity this year," Stanford
Women's Coach John Davis
noted. "They're rowing well al
though they're just starting to
row together. I was pleased with
the performance of the junior var
sity as well. Our goal this year is
not to go too fast too soon." Davis'
goal has been to seat a varsity
eight to compete with the tough
crews from Washington and Wis
consin as well as top teams from
the East.
Following spring break, Stan
ford will travel to the San Diego
Crew Classic.

The Stanford crew teams successfully opened their season Saturday by posting wins against UC-Davis
and UC-Santa Barbara in every race but the frosh eight-man, where UCSB beat the Cardinal by a
mere 12 seconds.
