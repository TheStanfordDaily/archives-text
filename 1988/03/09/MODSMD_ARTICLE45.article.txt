While most students
head south to get a head
start on a summer tan,
the Stanford track and
field team will kick into
high gear. The Cardinal
will host two track meets

and send four entrants to Oklahoma
City for the NCAA Indoor Champion
ships during spring break.
Brian Marshall and Patty Purpur
went to Colorado last weekend to make
the qualifying marks for the indoor
championships. Marshall broke his own

school record with an indoor high jump
of 7 feet, 3V2 inches, following a trend
he has established during his four years
here. Purpur, a junior, threw the shot
put 50-6, following a double win in the
shotput and the discus at the San Jose
Relays.
Stanford will be hosting the Stanford
Holiday Inn Track and Field Festival
March 25 and 26, featuring 3,000 col
legiate and high school competitors. The
meet is the second largest on the West
Coast and will feature a strong field.
The Cardinal will also be hosting
Northwestern, the College of Notre
Dame and the University of San Fran
sisco March 20.
