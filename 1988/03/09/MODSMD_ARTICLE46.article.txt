# Gentleman fencers 3rd at regional

1 he sport ot fencing has
not lost the gentlemanly
honor and admiration
depicted in the swash
buckling movies of the
past. But that doesn't
mean that all fencers are

gentlemanly or honorable.
Last weekend's Western Regional
Fencing Championships at Long Beach
State had both the honorable gentlemen
and the dishonorable fencers. The result
was a disappointing third-place finish
for the Stanford men's fencing team, a
result of some questionable practices by
the tournament's host team.
Although the Air Force Academy won

the tournament, a surprise to none of
the fencers or coaches there, Long
Beach finished second — and that was
a surprise.
As hosts for the tournament, Long
Beach selected alumni fencers to serve
as the tournament's directors, a practice
criticized by Stanford Coach Zoran
Tulum.
"Their alumni directors did every
thing possible to stop Stanford fencers,"
Tulum said. "We not only had to defeat
our opponents but we had to overcome
biased officials as well."
Tulum said that the tournament
directors unfairly judged several of the
saber matches, frequently favoring the
Long Beach fencers with the privilege
of "right of way."
In addition, Tulum felt the tourna

ment's officials were unjust in how they
awarded individual berths to the NCAA
tournament.
Stanford sophomore Duncan Bell, al
though finishing second individually in
the foil event, was not selected for a
national berth. His 14-3 record in the
tournament was only good enough for
an alternate position.
Stanford's third-place finish was not
entirely fruitless, however. Senior foil
man Chris Gillen, whose 30-6 regular
season record led the west coast foilmen,
qualified for the NCAA playoffs, as did
team captain Dave Russ, who placed
fourth in the tournament's saber event.
This weekend, the women's fencing
team travels to their West Regional
Tournament. UC-San Diego hosts this
year's tournament.
