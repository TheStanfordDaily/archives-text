# Spikers succumb to Bruins in four

Une can only
wonder what
might have
been.
Stanford's
scrappy men's
volleyball

squad, following a six-point
run, trailed the mighty UCLA
Bruins 11-8 in the pivotal third
game Friday at Maples Pavil
ion. The Cardinal then had its
proverbial bubble burst. Hopes
of an upset were shattered
when two consecutive Stanford
kills sailed out by the smallest
of margins. UCLA rolled from
then on out to complete an 11-
15, 15-12, 15-10, 15-9 victory.
"They (UCLA) got out to big
leads in every game they won,
and that is when they play
their best," Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves said. "I
wish we could have stayed with
them early on."
But it wasn't to be. The No.
4 Bruins showed why they are
the defending NCAA cham
pions by bouncing back quickly
after the opening-game setback
at the hands of the Cardinal.
Stanford cruised to victory
in the first game of the match
behind the big hitting of soph
omores Dan Hanan and Craig
Forsyth. "We hit very well
early on," Nieves said.
UCLA Coach A 1 Scates had
an alternative explanation.
"My two freshmen (Carl
Henkel and Mike Whitcomb)
just stood around the first
game," he said. "They didn't
block."
Henkel and Whitcomb did
not take the floor to start the
second game of the match. The
two freshmen were replaced by

sophomores Mike Stafford and
J.B. Saunders. The substitutes,
especially Saunders, really
helped out as the Bruins
jumped out to an early lead
and hung on to knot the match
at one game apiece. "Saunders
played extremely well," Scates
said. "As a result, Whitcomb
never got another chance to
play."
Senior Don Dendinger
proved why he is a strong All-
America candidate in the third
and fourth games as he finally
played up to his potential,
finishing the match as the
leading Bruin hitter. Sopho
more hitter Trevor Schirman,
last year's Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association
freshmen of the year, also had
a big match for UCLA. But in
the final analysis, Scates
pointed to junior setter Matt
Sonnichsen as the key to the
Bruins' success.
"Sonnichsen had a great
match setting and utilizing the
quick attack," Scates said. "He
showed really good judgment
out there tonight, but we've
come to expect that from him."
The loss to UCLA left the
Cardinal (10-10 overall, 4-5 in
conference) alone in sixth place
in the WTVA. The Bruins (19-4,
5-3) secured their hold on
fourth place in the league.
Stanford now has two weeks
off before resuming play over
spring break. While the rest of
us are relaxing in Mexico or
partying with old friends, the
Cardinal volleyball players will
be facing a tough road swing
that includes three games in
four nights. Between March 22
and March 25, Stanford faces
league foes Long Beach State,
Cal State-Northridge and Pep
perdine.
