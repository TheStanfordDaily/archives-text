# Women hoopsters fall from first

### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
LOS ANGELES-
This weekend, the
Pacific 10 Confer
ence women's bas
ketball race turned
into a replay of the
women's figure

skating finals at the Winter Olym
pics. Stanford, who held the
league's top spot going into Friday
and Saturday's games as well as
the No. 8 spot in the Associated
Press poll, suffered two unex
pected falls in the form of a 74-64
loss to unranked UCLA and an
87-69 defeat at the hands of No.
16 USC.
The Cardinal, 25-3 overall and
13-3 in the Pac-10, has been
relegated to third place in the con
ference, while USC moves into a
first-place tie with No. 11 Wash
ington at 14-2. The Huskies have
an apparent lock on at least part
of the Pac-10 crown, but should
Stanford beat the Trojans Friday
night and the Bruins on Saturday
— two 7:30 games at Maples Pa
vilion — the Cardinal would finish
the season as runner-up.
Stanford's trouble began Friday
night at Pauley Pavilion almost
immediately after tip-off. UCLA
got the first points on the board
with a jumper from the corner of
the key, establishing a Bruin lead
that surprisingly-sluggish Stan
ford never overcame.
"I just don't think people came
out to play with the intensity we
needed," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "I think we
played well for probably seven
minutes, and that was it. If we
would have played that hard for
the rest of the game, we wouldn't
have to come from behind that
much."
Nowhere was this more appar
ent than inside the paint. The
fired-up Bruins covered the Car
dinal's post players tightly,
seriously stalling Stanford's of
fense, while UCLA forward Dora

Dome fired away to garner a
game-high 24 points.
More importantly, UCLA won
the battle of the boards, out
rebounding the Cardinal 54-38.
"We just didn't rebound at all,"
VanDerveer said. "We didn't box
out, we didn't get second shots,
and we let them totally dominate
us inside, either scoring or
rebounding."
Unfortunately, Stanford was
struck with this affliction again
Saturday night, but this time the
troubles were compounded by
Cherie Nelson. The Pac-10 Player
of the Week for two weeks run
ning assured herself another
seven days of honor with a career
high 41 points (on impressive 15-
for-23 shooting) as well as 13
rebounds; in fact, Nelson had al
ready earned a double-double at
the halftime buzzer with 20 points
and 10 boards.
"Cherie Nelson was really
tough inside, and we weren't able
to score inside like they were,"
VanDerveer said. "They came
down, got the ball inside and she
scored. We just have to do a better
job inside on her."
Nelson was aided by senior
teammate Holly Ford, who played
some of the best basketball of her
college career in her final home
game, adding 17 points to the
Trojan total.
Although the Cardinal's post
players suffered during the trip,
two of the guards put in outstand
ing performances. Freshman
Sonja Henning kept Stanford
alive on Friday, scoring a team
high 17 points while recording six
assists and six steals, while soph
omore Stacy Parson, making only
her second start Saturday night,
netted a career-high 16 points to
lead the Cardinal.
"I just went out there and tried
my best," Parson said. "It just
happened to all come together
tonight a little better than usual.
The L.A. schools are always a big
game, so you always get up for
that."

Although the Cardinal's post
players suffered during the trip,
two of the guards put in outstand
ing performances. Freshman
Sonja Henning kept Stanford

omore Stacy Parson, making only
her second start Saturday night,
netted a career-high 16 points to
lead the Cardinal.
