### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
The heavyweights of col
legiate women's tennis
sparred Sunday, and the
defending champion suf
fered a late-round knock
out.
Florida, the second-

ranked team in the nation and the
school with the best shot at dethroning
two-time defending NCAA champion
Stanford, edged the top-ranked and pre
viously undefeated Cardinal 5-4 Sunday
in the final of the USTA/ITCA Women's
National Collegiate Indoor Tennis
Championship.
Florida is now 16-1, while the Car
dinal — playing without top singles
player Eleni Rossides — dropped to 13-
1.
The victory not only assured the
Gators of the No. 1 ranking when the
next poll is released, but it also avenged
a crushing loss in the semifinals of last

year's NCAA championships. The
Gators were 29-0 and the No. 1 seed
last May when the Cardinal rudely
knocked them out of the tournament
with a surprisingly easy 5-1 semifinal
win.
This time around it was Stanford that
was the No. 1 seed and entered the
match with a lot of momentum. In the
three matches leading up to Sunday's
final, the Cardinal won all 18 of its
singles contests. After shutting out
Northwestern and SMU by identical 6-0
scores in the first two rounds, Stanford
blasted UCLA 6-2 in Saturday's semi
final.
The Cardinal got off to a quick start
Sunday by taking two of the top three
singles contests. Freshman Tami Whit
linger, ranked fifth nationally, edged
Florida's Halle Cioffi, the nation's No.
2-ranked singles player, by a 7-5, 7-6
(8-6) score in the No. 1 match.
The Gators' Shaun Stafford, who lost
to Stanford's Patty Fendick in last
year's NCAA singles final, routed soph

omore Lisa Green 6-2, 6-0 in the No.
2 contest, but Cardinal freshman Teri
Whitlinger had an equally convincing
6-0, 6-0 whitewash of Denise Dayan at
third singles.
Florida evened the score by winning
two of the three singles matches at the
bottom of the lineup. Stanford freshman
Sandra Birch bested Holly Danforth 6-3,
6-3 in the No. 4 match, but her senior
teammates Kay Tittle and Cari Hagey
lost in straight sets at fifth and sixth
singles.
The teams split the second and third
doubles matches, while Stanford's
Hagey and Birch split the first two sets
of their No. 1 matchup against Florida's
Cioffi and Cathy Goodrich. Cioffi and
Goodrich pulled out the final set to
record a 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 victory and give
the Gators the win.
Stanford now has two weeks off
before it travels to Los Angeles to plav
No. 3 USC March 24 and No. 5 UCLA
March 25.
