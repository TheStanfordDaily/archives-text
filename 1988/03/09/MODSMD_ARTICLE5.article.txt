# New disinvestment policy is approved
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
The University Board of Trus
tees yesterday approved a new dis
investment policy toward corpo
rations conducting business in
South Africa, significantly modi
fying Stanford's long-standing
policy of selective disinvestment.

While the University will con
tinue to consider individual share
holder resolutions that recom
mend withdrawal from South
Africa on a case-by-case basis
(selective disinvestment), the
trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility decided
that Stanford should either vote
"yes" on such resolutions or not
vote at all.
Although under the new policy
the University may remain
neutral, it cannot vote against
withdrawal resolutions.
In establishing the new policy,
the SCIR partially rejected a Com
mission on Investment Responsi
bility recommendation that the
University adopt a blanket disin
vestment policy requiring Stan
ford automatically to vote "yes"
on all shareholder withdrawal
proposals.
The SCIR is composed of six
voting trustees and several ex
oflficio members, while the CIR

consists of 12 faculty, alumni and
student members.
With agreement from CIH co
chairs Kirk Hanson and Frederick
Hillier at a Monday morning
meeting, the SCIR determined
that blanket disinvestment should
not be adopted because the Uni
versity "needs to allow companies
to make their case" when consid
ering shareholder resolutions to
withdraw from South Africa, said
SCIR chair Ted Mitchell.
If it never rejected a withdrawal
resolution, however, the Univer
sity would send the message, "We
think it's time for all companies
to rethink their position on South
Africa," said Mitchell, a professor
of education and public policy at
Dartmouth College.
"The SCIR went a considerable
distance toward the CIR recom
mendation, but not all the way,"
said Hanson, a lecturer in the
Graduate School of Business.
Hanson said he is hopeful that
the SCIR might someday support
total disinvestment. "This isn't
the end of the issue by any
means," he said, explaining that
he is encouraged by the SCIR's
willingness to change previous
policy.
The University holds stock
valued at $142 million in 42 U.S.
firms and $29 million in 39 in
ternational companies that con
duct business in South Africa.
The University has for many
years encouraged companies to as
sist blacks in South Africa by pro
viding jobs and by funding social
programs. The previous disinvest
ment policy recommended that
only "those companies not taking
social responsibility seriously"
pull out of their investments, said
Hillier, professor of operations re
search.
However, Mitchell said, "We're
not sure if doing as much [social
good] as can be expected is
enough" to hasten the end of
apartheid.
Mitchell added that the CIR
report changed Stanford's policy
"in a fundamental way." Deci
sions on disinvestment resolu
tions, he said, no longer center
around whether companies exer
cise social responsibility. Instead,
the mere presence of foreign in
vestment will be considered
"problematic."
"The case made (by the CIR)
was strong enough to warrant the
conclusion that no company can
have a net positive effect in South
Africa," Hanson said.

The SCIR also decided that the
University will send a revised ver
sion of the CIR report to all U.S.
and international companies in
Stanford's stock portfolio that
have investments in South Africa,
encouraging them to reconsider
"if the individual good they do is
enough to outweigh" the "collec
tively" negative consequences of
their presences, Mitchell said.
In addition to paying taxes to
the South African government,
foreign investors give legitimacy
to the racist regime by their pres
ence, according to the CIR report.
The CIR urged total disinvest
ment because such action would
help encourage the view of South
Africa as a "pariah" nation. The
report that the SCIR will draft
and send to corporations will em
phasize "collective" action to force
pariah status onto South Africa.
"The (SCIR members) were im
pressed with the potential impact
of many companies acting in con
cert with a common statement
against apartheid ... as opposed
to dribbling out one-by-one," Hil
lier said.
Mitchell said that pressuring in
ternational, as well as U.S., cor
porations to disinvest is an im
portant change from the previous
policy.
"On the national scale, collec
tive action can have only symbolic
significance," SCIR member Her
bert Dwight said.

tive action can have only symbolic
significance," SCIR member Her
bert Dwight said.
The University Board of Trus
tees yesterday approved a new dis
investment policy toward corpo
rations conducting business in
South Africa, significantly modi
fying Stanford's long-standing
policy of selective disinvestment.

While the University will con
tinue to consider individual share
holder resolutions that recom
mend withdrawal from South
Africa on a case-by-case basis
(selective disinvestment), the
trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility decided
that Stanford should either vote
"yes" on such resolutions or not
vote at all.
Although under the new policy
the University may remain
neutral, it cannot vote against
withdrawal resolutions.
In establishing the new policy,
the SCIR partially rejected a Com
mission on Investment Responsi
bility recommendation that the
University adopt a blanket disin
vestment policy requiring Stan
ford automatically to vote "yes"
on all shareholder withdrawal
proposals.
The SCIR is composed of six
voting trustees and several ex
oflficio members, while the CIR

consists of 12 faculty, alumni and
student members.
With agreement from CIH co
chairs Kirk Hanson and Frederick
Hillier at a Monday morning
meeting, the SCIR determined
that blanket disinvestment should
not be adopted because the Uni
versity "needs to allow companies
to make their case" when consid
ering shareholder resolutions to
withdraw from South Africa, said
SCIR chair Ted Mitchell.
If it never rejected a withdrawal
resolution, however, the Univer
sity would send the message, "We
think it's time for all companies
to rethink their position on South
Africa," said Mitchell, a professor
of education and public policy at
Dartmouth College.
"The SCIR went a considerable
distance toward the CIR recom
mendation, but not all the way,"
said Hanson, a lecturer in the
Graduate School of Business.
Hanson said he is hopeful that
the SCIR might someday support
total disinvestment. "This isn't
the end of the issue by any
means," he said, explaining that
he is encouraged by the SCIR's
willingness to change previous
policy.
The University holds stock
valued at $142 million in 42 U.S.
firms and $29 million in 39 in
ternational companies that con
duct business in South Africa.
The University has for many
years encouraged companies to as
sist blacks in South Africa by pro
viding jobs and by funding social
programs. The previous disinvest
ment policy recommended that
only "those companies not taking
social responsibility seriously"
pull out of their investments, said
Hillier, professor of operations re
search.
However, Mitchell said, "We're
not sure if doing as much [social
good] as can be expected is
enough" to hasten the end of
apartheid.
Mitchell added that the CIR
report changed Stanford's policy
"in a fundamental way." Deci
sions on disinvestment resolu
tions, he said, no longer center
around whether companies exer
cise social responsibility. Instead,
the mere presence of foreign in
vestment will be considered
"problematic."
"The case made (by the CIR)
was strong enough to warrant the
conclusion that no company can
have a net positive effect in South
Africa," Hanson said.

The SCIR also decided that the
University will send a revised ver
sion of the CIR report to all U.S.
and international companies in
Stanford's stock portfolio that
have investments in South Africa,
encouraging them to reconsider
"if the individual good they do is
enough to outweigh" the "collec
tively" negative consequences of
their presences, Mitchell said.
In addition to paying taxes to
the South African government,
foreign investors give legitimacy
to the racist regime by their pres
ence, according to the CIR report.
The CIR urged total disinvest
ment because such action would
help encourage the view of South
Africa as a "pariah" nation. The
report that the SCIR will draft
and send to corporations will em
phasize "collective" action to force
pariah status onto South Africa.
"The (SCIR members) were im
pressed with the potential impact
of many companies acting in con
cert with a common statement
against apartheid ... as opposed
to dribbling out one-by-one," Hil
lier said.
Mitchell said that pressuring in
ternational, as well as U.S., cor
porations to disinvest is an im
portant change from the previous
policy.
"On the national scale, collec
tive action can have only symbolic
significance," SCIR member Her
bert Dwight said.
