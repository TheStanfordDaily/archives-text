# New disinvestment policy is approved

The University Board of Trus
tees yesterday approved a new dis
investment policy toward corpo
rations conducting business in
South Africa, significantly modi
fying Stanford's long-standing
policy of selective disinvestment.

While the University will con
tinue to consider individual share
holder resolutions that recom
mend withdrawal from South
Africa on a case-by-case basis
(selective disinvestment), the
trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility decided
that Stanford should either vote
"yes" on such resolutions or not
vote at all.
Although under the new policy
the University may remain
neutral, it cannot vote against
withdrawal resolutions.
In establishing the new policy,
the SCIR partially rejected a Com
mission on Investment Responsi
bility recommendation that the
University adopt a blanket disin
vestment policy requiring Stan
ford automatically to vote "yes"
on all shareholder withdrawal
proposals.
The SCIR is composed of six
voting trustees and several ex
oflficio members, while the CIR

consists of 12 faculty, alumni and
student members.
With agreement from CIH co
chairs Kirk Hanson and Frederick
Hillier at a Monday morning
meeting, the SCIR determined
that blanket disinvestment should
not be adopted because the Uni
versity "needs to allow companies
to make their case" when consid
ering shareholder resolutions to
withdraw from South Africa, said
SCIR chair Ted Mitchell.
If it never rejected a withdrawal
resolution, however, the Univer
sity would send the message, "We
think it's time for all companies
to rethink their position on South
Africa," said Mitchell, a professor
of education and public policy at
Dartmouth College.
"The SCIR went a considerable
distance toward the CIR recom
mendation, but not all the way,"
said Hanson, a lecturer in the
Graduate School of Business.
Hanson said he is hopeful that
the SCIR might someday support
total disinvestment. "This isn't
the end of the issue by any
means," he said, explaining that
he is encouraged by the SCIR's
willingness to change previous
policy.
The University holds stock
