Alter a strong perform
ance at the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championships
in La Jolla over the
weekend, the Stanford
men's tennis team —
with the return of fresh-

man David Wheaton in singles play —
tunes up for its battle royale against
USC April 2 with dual matches against
Ohio State, Arizona, and Arizona State
during spring break.
The third-ranked Cardinal, which
relinquished the top national ranking
to Pacific 10 Conference rival USC, en
tered three teams in the top-notch dou
bles tournament Friday through Sun
day, with one tandem reaching the semi

finals and another falling in the quar
terfinals.
Wheaton and Dan Turbow upended
a fine Pepperdine duo of Andrew Sznaj
der and Robby Weiss 7-5, 6-4 in the
third round before bowing to UCLA's
Patrick Galbreath and Brain Garrow in
the semifinals 7-6, 6-4.
Wheaton, who should resume singles
duty against Ohio State, is almost com
pletely recovered from the wrist injury
that has limited his singles play since
December. He regularly plays doubles
with Jeff Tarango.
"David is gaining more confidence all
the time," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said, "and Dan Turbow did an outstand
ing job. They were close to being the
best team in the tournament."
Sophomores Jeff Cathrall and Eric
Peus also registered an impressive win,

besting USC's Byron Black and John
Carras 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 in the third round.
Galbreath and Garrow defeated
Cathrall and Peus 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 in the
quarterfinal round.
"The tournament was good for us,"
Peus said. "Playing No. 3 (on the Stan
ford team), we don't get a lot of oppor
tunities to play a lot of high caliber
teams, so it was nice to come through
against the USC team."
Freshmen Martin Blackman and
Glenn Solomon, the Cardinal's third
pair in the tournament, lost in the
second round.
Stanford, 9-1, hosts Ohio State at
Stanford Tennis Stadium March 23,
then heads south to face ASU March
25 in Tempe and Arizona March 26 in
Tuscon. Arizona State is 9-3 on the
season, and Arizona is 5-5.
