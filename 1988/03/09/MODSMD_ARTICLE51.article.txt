# Men's gymnastics takes Invitational
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
The Stanford men's gym
nastics team scored
284.05 points Saturday
night to win the Hobee's
Invitational and left
Maples Pavilion happy
knowing that even when

the Cardinal has a slightly bad meet, it
can record a score among the highest
in the nation.
However, Stanford also knows that
such a performance would never win
the NCAAs (April 15-17 in Lincoln,
Neb.) and that anything less than a peak
performance there will mean a disap
pointing season.
In defeating Fullerton State (276.05)
and California (273), the Cardinal im
proved its record to 14-4 and gave a
large and supportive Maples Pavilion
crowd a spectacular show in its final
home competition of the season.
Senior co-captain Randy Besosa bade
an especially fond farewell after four
years of sterling gymnastics on the
Farm. Besosa broke his own school
record for the all-around competition
with a score of 58.05. Averaging almost
9.7 on the six events, Besosa added an
other feather to his cap and confirmed
himself as the one of the three best
individual gymnasts in Stanford history.
Besosa joins the ranks of Steve Hug,
who won three straight NCAA titles in
the early 19705, and Jon Louis, who
won the collegiate crown in 1986.
Curiously, there were so many excel
lent individual performances Saturday
that Besosa did not win any one event,
despite his all-around total and two 9.8s
(parallel bars and high bar). Cal's Bob
Sundstrom, an Olympic contender but

the only Bear of any note, tied or won
three events on his way to a 57.5 all
around total.
Sophomore Conrad Voorsanger's
high-bar routine typified the best facets
of Stanford's performance. Voorsanger
gave further evidence that he has the
right to patent his routine when he ex
ecuted his blind-catch release move, the
"Voorhanger," perfectly on his way to
a 9.85 on the event.
On the down side (relatively), the Car
dinal managed to total only 46.65 on
the vault and 46.7 on the pommel horse.
Last week, the team scored 47.6 on each
of these events. Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada said while the meet showed
exactly where his team is in ability, this
kind of lapse cannot be tolerated.
"There's no way we can win the
NCAAs like this; we have got to be
hitting all our routines," Hamada said.
"We're just a little bit off-balance or
off-timing, whatever; we're still missing,
so we have to have a real fine tune-up
before the NCAA championships. I
would say (if) this is where we are, no
miracle is going to happen."
As an affirmation of the team's con
fidence and resilience, Stanford finished
strong with a 47.8 on the parallel bars,
led by Besosa's 9.8 and co-captain Mike
Matzek's 9.75. Besides these two, it was
also the last home meet for Chuck
Gerardo, who won the pommel horse,
finished second on the vault and third
on the rings. The strong finish and the
finale of the seniors made going out in
style the theme of the meet, reversing
an early season trend.
"That shows a change over the course
of the season that we could go from
always letting down near the end to
picking up when we need to," redshirt
sophomore Adam Forman said.
