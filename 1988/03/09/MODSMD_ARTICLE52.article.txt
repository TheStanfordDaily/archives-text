# Card women unhappy in win
##

And so it ended, not with
a bang, but with a sigh
from Stanford Asst.
Coach Sam Shaw: "We
beat ourselves again."
In its last home meet
of the year, the Stanford

women's gymnastics team did improve
its record to 8-5, dominating UC-Santa
Barbara 184.40 to 180.45. However,
they failed to achieve Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina's goal of posting a
record-breaking score to improve the
team's ranking at the regional level.
The Cardinal started off in top form
on vault, breaking all previous records
for the highest team score on that ap
paratus. Senior Alison McGann said
goodbye to Maples Pavilion with a 9.40

performance, and junior Jinny Rhee
made her farewell with a second-place
9.55.

Amidst the high scores, sophomore
Dina Amoroso's achievement shone
brightest. Amoroso unveiled a new vault
for the eager Maples Pavilion crowd —
a full twisting tsukahara, the most dif
ficult vault in women's collegiate com
petition today. Her first-place 9.60 score
quickly brought the crowd alive with
excitement.
Momentarily, it seemed that the Car
dinal gymnasts on bars and beam would
follow suit. The first competitors on
each event, freshman Julie Dunhill on
bars and sophomore Becky Ashton on
beam, hit the best routines of their
collegiate careers to score 9.15 and 9.50
respectively. The latter score was good
for first place.
However, the Cardinal couldn't capi

talize. One after another, the following
gymnasts missed their routines.
The Cardinal did manage to do a com
plete turnaround and post a team
record floor score of 47.25. Junior Sheri
Evenson seemed to be back on track
after returning from an injury, earning
a 9.40 to tie with Rhee for third-place
honors. Second place went to junior
Cheryl Doo with a 9.45, and Amoroso
won the event once again, tumbling to
a 9.65 score.
But as far as Sardina's goal was con
cerned, all these efforts were for naught.
"It's all here," senior Cindy Boyd said,
tapping her head. "It's all just mental."
Sardina appeared visibly frustrated
with the meet's outcome. Unfortunate
ly, the result of this competition has
long-term ramifications, for it does not
raise the team's average score as they
move into the regional competition.
