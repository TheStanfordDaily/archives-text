# No spring break for men's golf...

### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
As the men's golf season
moves toward spring quarter,
Stanford Coach Wally Good
win is looking to position his
squad in the middle of the
Pacific 10 Conference. Over
spring break, the team will

have two opportunities to compete against
some of the country's best teams: at the
Pepsi/Fresno State Classic (March 24-26)
and the Western Intercollegiate (March 28-
30).

The squad that travels to the next two
tournaments has been almost completely
set, with all the players from last week's

John Burns Invitational in Oahu automat
ically qualifying again. The only question
mark is junior John Mahon, who injured
his back in Hawaii and may not be healthy
enough to compete.
Sophomore Chris Weyand will be looking
to continue his improvement after compet
ing in the first tournament of his collegiate
career. Other players definitely qualifying
for the next two matches are sophomores
Mike Hubly, Brad Joondeph and Mark Fun
seth. This leaves one or two spots open for
the rest of the players, depending on
Mahon's status at tournament time.
Goodwin is looking forward to the Fresno
State Classic because it boasts a field of 28
top teams, much like the one the golfers
encountered at their last tournament in

Hawaii. Two Pac-10 powers, Arizona and
Arizona State, will be among the teams com
peting, along with nationally-ranked Brig
ham Young University, which the Cardinal
will see for the first time this year.
The tournament will be held at the Bel
mont Country Club in Fresno, which Good
win called "6,300 yards of devilishness." The
format of the tournament calls for all 28
teams to compete in the first two rounds
of the 54-hole event, with the low-18 eligible
to compete in the final round on Sunday.
If everything goes according to Goodwin's
plans, the team will play all 54 holes.
Immediately following the Fresno State
Classic, the team will head to Monterey to
play in the Western Intercollegiate hosted
by San Jose State.
