# ... But the women are off to Hawaii

Where do most students
want to go for spring break?
That's right. Hawaii. And
the Stanford women's golf
team is getting that wish.
The team will compete in the
Rainbow Intercolleeiate

March 23-25 at the Kaneohe Klipper Golf
Course on the Kaneohe Air Base in Oahu.
"It's going to be a good field," Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin said, though he added
that the tournament won't be quite as tough
as the Cardinal's last two.
Of the 15 teams that will play, Stanford
figures to challenge UCLA, San Diego State

and top-10 teams Arizona and New Mexico.
The lack of top teams should enable Stan
ford to finish higher than it has in the past,
but as senior Kay Cornelius pointed out,
"Anyone is beatable for us although we
haven't shown what we can do."
"I just hope our team plays well," she
added.
"I'll just go out there and play my hard
est," said freshman Jodi Figley. "I don't
care who else is out there."
Playing over vacation has both advantages
and disadvantages. According to Baldwin,
two advantages of this tournament will be
that there will be no pressure of schoolwork
and that the players will not miss class.
Figley agreed. "There won't be any pres
sure because finals will be over and I can

just think about my game," she said.
For the time being, however, final exams
will be on team members' minds. According
to Cornelius, "The next couple of weeks'
practices will be really important. It's going
to be hard for everyone to get out consis
tently and have their mind focused on golf
during tough academic times."
Baldwin will be counting on Figley and
Cornelius to be at their usual best, and said
he is hoping that freshmen Kristin Ryan
and Michele Lyford, along with sophomore
Stephanie Parel, "can make a turnaround."
During upcoming practices, the players
are hoping for the weather to be a little
windier than usual here. The course is lo
cated on the windward side of Oahu,
Baldwin said.
