the United States,
will play host to
the 1988 NCAA
wrestling champi
onships in two

weeks.
Stanford University, which is
about as far away from the mid
west's wrestling hotbeds as a
grappler can travel without get
ting his feet wet, will be repre
sented at the year's final col
legiate competition by 177-pound
sophomore Ron Perry. 190-pound

make the trip as the Pac-10's first

Perry qualified for the NCAAs

Fullerton State. The top three
placers in each bracket at the Pac

Perry, out of Areata, California,
recorded an 18-13-1 record during
his first year at Stanford. He is

for the NCAAs.
"I'd like to place in the top
eight," said Perry. "I think I can
definitely win a few matches, and
maybe even surprise some people
there."
This will be Mclntyre's second
trip to the NCAAs. He went to
the national tournament last year
as one of four Pac-10 "wildcards."
Perry will be making his first jour
