Mia's Dead Week Getaway:
If Green Library depresses you, and you
can't find a seat in the Coffee House, I have
the perfect place for studying, cappuccino
drinking and eating — The Prolific Oven (550
Waverly Place, Palo Alto). Delicious cakes and
pastries accompany a variety of fine coffees
in a low-key cafe atmosphere where big wooden
tables and plenty of chairs provide room to
spread out and start working.
Songbirds Unite:
Join the Fleet Street Singers to welcome
Berkeley's Golden Overtones and the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania's Chord-on-Blues for "an
a capella evening" at the first Annual Dead
Week Jamboree that organizers plan to make
an annual event. The three groups will be
singing tonight in Dinkelspiel at 8 p.m. Take
a break from paper writing and problem sets
and come listen. Tickets are $2.50 and can be
purchased from any Fleet Street member or
at the door.
All That Jazz:
Saturday night, the Lively Arts brings jazz
greats Joe Williams and Dianne Reeves to the
Stanford stage. Music lovers will delight in
the sounds of these two musicians in Memorial
Auditorium at 8 p.m. Tickets available at the
Tresidder Ticket Office.
Vacation "Rand R":
A quick poll of my friends revealed that a
lot of us are heading to exotic spring break
locales: Hawaii, Mexico, London, New
York. ... OK, so New York's not that exotic,
but I'm going there so humor me. For those
of you staying around, however, don't despair!
Why not rent a car (if you're 21 and over)
and take a day trip to the beaches of Santa
Cruz, the Monterey Aquarium or San Fran
cisco? Or try a long weekend in Yosemite or
Napa to put your life in perspective.
