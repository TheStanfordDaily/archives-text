## Fiscal Fidelity 'Hard Cell' tops best album buys 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Welcome to another edition of
Fiscal Fidelity, in which we rec
ommend the best new releases
and record buys. The following
are the recommendations for
March:
"Hard Cell" compilation (cas
sette, $1.99) — The bargain of the
month. Though Tower Records
only had this on cassette tape, an
LP probably exists somewhere. If
for nothing else, the great mix of
Time Zone's rhythmical, artic
ulate and frighteningly-valid an
them "World Destruction" makes
this a great find, but the other
seven songs (including three from
the Golden Paliminos, obviously
musical slaves to Celluloid
Records) are worth listening to as

well.
Sinead O'Connor's "The Lion
and the Cobra" (compact disc,
$12.99) — Sinead (pronounced
shin-AID, for those not fluent in
Gaelic) may very well be the first
bald woman to receive a Grammy.
Though the album, which
O'Connor wrote and produced, is
not always pleasant, it is con
stantly brimming with sensitivity
and raw emotion.
The ebullience of the song
"Mandinka" (which you have
probably heard but will have no
idea where) and the obvious bril
liance of the artist make "The
Lion and the Cobra" a very
worthwhile puzzle to explore.
Sisters of Mercy's "Flood
lands" (LP/cassette, $6.99) —
Previously reviewed in The Daily,
this is the follow-up to the excel

lent but unrecognized "First and
Last and Always." If you detest
the bass clef ignore this record,
as Andrew Eldritch's vocals never
pass middle C, but otherwise
check it out.
Rick Astley's "Never Gonna
Give You Up" (7" single, $1.66)
— If you have an extra two bucks,
pick up one for your significant
other as a belated Valentine's Day
present, because few pop songs
today (let alone dance mixes)
exude the power and poignancy
of this tune.
Though not the next minstrel
of our times, Astley possesses an
amazingly rich voice that most
recording artists can only envy,
bringing an added dimension to
this instantly infectious song. It
almost restores my faith in pop
music. . ..
