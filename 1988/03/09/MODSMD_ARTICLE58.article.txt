## Miniskirts dominate spring party wear 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Spring is finally almost here. Ah, that
unmistakable season: Spring is the time
of year that everyone takes nine units
of windsurfing, lays out on Wilbur Field
to catch the rays, and Stanford begins
to loosen up and party.
If you're a night person and you like
to go out dancing or partying, you know
that there's a huge difference between
what you wear during the day and how
you present yourself at night.
Of course, you can't really make this
fashion distinction at Stanford parties,
since Stanford students will usually
wear jeans and a sweatshirt to anything.
But if you're going out nightclubbing
in the City, or if there's a hot party off
campus, or if you just want to check
out guys or go cruising for gals, it's
important to know what the hottest
fashion items are.
This weekend, I took the liberty of
hitting one of the south of Market
nightclubs in San Francisco to get an
indication of what kind of clothes people

will be wearing in the next few months.
For men, it seems that unconstructed
jackets — the ones by Cotler, Touch
and Transposition — are still pretty
popular. I also noticed an abundance of
leather jackets with all sorts of buckles,
flaps and zippers.
If you've been to any nightclub,
you've noticed that there always seem
to be a lot of muscular guys with huge
arms and chests bigger than most of
the women. These types of guys usually
wear the Shah Safari/Tomato type of
camp shirts with the collars pulled up
and the already short sleeves rolled up
even more.
Other than that, men, for the most
part, really don't care what they wear.
There were a lot of guys wearing jeans,
torn T-shirts and dirty tennis shoes.
Women, on the other hand, always
seem to take the time out to make
themselves look attractive. The big fash
ion trend for women nowadays appears
to be miniskirts and we're talking mini,
mini, mini and tight, tight, tight skirts.
According to observers in the fashion
industry, the trend is not yet ready to

wear itself out, and this was obvious
at the club I visited. I'd say that over
50 percent of the women who were there
were wearing skirts that came above
the knee.
The miniskirts came in all sorts of
styles — denim, leather, linen — you
name it. Whatever the material, there
was a woman wearing it as a miniskirt.
I'm not quite sure what the sociologi
cal implications are of this proliferation
of miniskirts.
According to some women with whom
I've discussed the subject, a woman who
wears a miniskirt is telling society that
she's independent, confident and self
sufficient. Contraiy to what some may
hope, it's not a sexual message; it's an
implicitly feminist way of saying you
feel good about yourself.
However, there seems to be very little
debate as to what the intentions are of
a woman who wears a high-cut leather
miniskirt.
So there you have it: The fashion
forecast for spring looks partly uncon
structed with a good chance of wide
spread miniskirts.
