# Movie Review
## 'Frantic' an entertaining job of forging Hitchcock 
### Erik Hagestad Staff writer 
I'm not sure if Roman Polanski's
new film "Frantic" is an homage to
or a rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock's films,
but it definitely manages to re-create
the mood and visual style of the great
director. Sadly, however, Polanski
leaves out the interesting sub-themes
of morality that made Hitchcock's
films so intriguing, and what's left is
a vapid but exciting and visually
stimulating film.
The story of "Frantic" is a variation
on the Hitchcock theme of mistaken
identity, with the result that an Amer
ican doctor's wife is kidnapped in Paris
by a group of international terrorists
(stereotypically generalized as
"Arabs.") The rest of the film follows
the doctor as he searches for his wife
with the aid of a young, beautiful drug
smuggler.
Harrison Ford does surprisingly well
as the naive Dr. Walker, trapped in a
hostile, foreign environment. He actu
ally shows some subtleties of emotion

as his character is pushed further and
further into the lurid world of the
Paris underground in a deperate at
tempt to find his wife.
Newcomer Emmanuelle Seigner
gives new meaning to the term
"French beauty" while providing a
childlike innocence to her role as Mi
chelle, an amoral and egocentric small
time drug smuggler. Her coquettish
charm and stunning looks provide
what would seem to be an irresistable
temptation to Walker as his lonely
search becomes all the more futile.
The interplay between Walker and
Michelle adds a taste of the sexual
intrigue that gave most of Hitchcock's
stories their lurid charm. However,
Polanski, for unknown reasons,
chooses to avoid any climactic con
frontation between the characters.
The film's virtue lies in its amazing
visual style, stolen directly from
Hitchcock. From the opening two-shot
of Walker and his wife in a Parisian
cab, the imitation is evident, and to a
great, extent highly successful.

tor's films scrupulously, for nearly
every aspect of "Frantic" is reminis
cent of Hitchcock.
The story itself embodies many of
the elements typically found in
Hitchcock's films. The situation of the
everyday man pulled unwillingly into
incredible circumstances can be seen
in many of the director's films, as is
the final circumstance in which the

doctor must eventually take matters
into his own hands.
Besides forging such a wonderful
replica of the late director's films,
Polanski adds his own sense of beauty
and charm, which is not at all ham
pered by his setting the film in Paris.
"Frantic" manages to capture many
of the eccentricities of the city that
make it such a cultural experience
without having to rely upon stock
images (though he does throw in the
Eiffel Tower several times). Instead,
"Frantic" dwells in the more vibrant
undercurrent of the city such as its
night clubs, dingy alleys and diverse
cultural communities.
Despite all its superficial appeal,
however, "Frantic" is disappointing as
a film. The story is exciting, though
perhaps a bit predictable, and the vis
ual style is impeccable. But there is
really no bite to the film, no themes
or statements worth pondering after
the lights come up.
The result is a film that is all image
and no substance, what one might call
a Hitchcock film for the 1980s.
