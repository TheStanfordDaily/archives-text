# Movie Review
## Bearable 'Being' light on story, heavy on sex 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
The film "The Unbearable
Lightness of Being" clearly suffers
in any comparison with the book.
How can you capture on screen
the philosophical meanderings
that lent Milan Kundera's novel
its distinctive flavor?
You can't. Take away the phi
losophy and you have a rather
flimsy piece of material, which is
what the movie is.
It's unfair, though, to judge the
film too harshly because it isn't
just like the book. The movie of
fers us a different sort of meal
altogether, and it should be
judged on its own terms. It is
important to keep this in mind
while watching the film because
in its own way, it sparkles.
The movie sits in an odd cate
gory. It's fascinating, almost mes
merizing, without being truly
great. The cinematography is lush
and beautiful, the women gor
geous, the sex scenes frequent and
erotic. Parts of the story are really
touching.
The film explores the nature of
the attraction a Czechoslovakian
doctor, Tomas, has for two very
different women. One, Sabina, is

an independent, strong artist who
evades commitments. The other,
Tereza, is dependent and needy.
The two women represent the
different pulls in Tomas's life: one
to be light and free, the other to
be heavy, committed and
earthbound. This is the intriguing
central theme of the movie, ad
mittedly more easily identified if
you have read the novel.
The three characters all even
tually flee Czechoslovakia for
Switzerland, where life is easier
and better. Sabina ultimately
moves to even greater freedom in
California.
Tereza, uncomfortable with
freedom and "lightness," goes
back to Czechoslovakia. Tomas
eventually follows her, thereby
choosing to put stones in his pock
ets, choosing heaviness, commit
ment and love over lightness.
The film doesn't move in a
straight line toward these conclu
sions; it wanders a lot on the way,
sometimes rather aimlessly.
There is a long sequence in the
film of Soviet tanks rolling into
Prague while Tereza takes photos
of them. The sequence is
stretched out too long, but it
serves no real purpose in the film.

Another scene of Tereza and
Sabina photographing each other
in the nude is longer than it needs
to be and never really goes
anywhere. It's there, presumably,
to build up the earthy, sensual
atmosphere that characterizes
this film.
Indeed, there is sex here â€” lots
of sex. The sex scenes are lavishly
filmed in an atmosphere heavy
with sensuality. These people, you
begin to believe, really know how
to enjoy themselves.
The assurance and gusto with
which Sabina eats fondue at a
Swiss restaurant makes you crave
fondue; if your sex life is less than
fantastic the sex scenes will prob
ably have the same effect.
The whole movie rides on the
actors in the three principal roles.
We have to watch them for several
hours, so they really need to per
form. Daniel Day Lewis as Tomas
is the big disappointment here.
He was terrific as a punk in
"My Beautiful Laundrette" and
as an affected prig in "A Room
with a View." He's obviously a
versatile actor, but he fails to
bring any depth or magnetism to
his portrayal of Tomas.

The actresses, Lena Olin as
Sabina, and Juliette Binoche as
Tereza, are, in contrast, perfect.
Olin is commanding and powerful
as Sabina. She brings to life this
gutsy, uncompromising woman.
Binoche is as impossibly beau
tiful and delicate as Tereza,
believing that love and sex are
inextricably bound. She is incan
descent.
The appeal of these two women
dwarfs Lewis; they make him ap
pear almost irrelevant. He doesn't
hold up his corner of the triangle.
A stronger actor in the role could
have made the dynamics of the
triangle very lively.
Nonetheless, this movie glows
in its own peculiar way. It is un
deniably too long and it doesn't
have the kick of a great film.
Trying to film Kundera's novel,
omitting the philosophical digres
sions, was like trying to bake
bread with no yeast.
But here, miraculously, it al
most rises nonetheless. This is a
movie worth seeing for its sen
suality, for its beauty, for the few
of Kundera's ideas that do come
across intact. See it, but see it for
what it is.
