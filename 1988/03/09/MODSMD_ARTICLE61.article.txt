# Readings by authors
## Bookstores brighten break 
### Isaac Barchas Editorial staff 
Stuck in the dorm over spring
break? No idea what to do? Con
sider checking out Bay Area
bookstores.
This part of California is sup
posed to be a literary Mecca,
and indeed it contains more
than its share of privately
owned bookshops that have not
yet been bought out or pushed
out of business by con
glomerates such as Walden
books or B. Dalton Bookseller.
Such chain stores have their
advantages (low price, infinite
availability of bestsellers). But,
with their supermarket charac
teristics, they are hardly places
to relax and browse. The adven
turer who views a trip to the
bookstore less as a mission to
purchase than as an invitation
to explore, would do well to
spend some time this break
looking through the area's
smaller, dustier stores.
Fortunately, many such book
stores host readings, signings
and lectures by well-known and
not-so-well-known authors.
Such appearances provide an
ideal excuse to visit these stores,
take part in the scene, and
browse the shelves. They can
be as much political or cultural
happenings as literary events.

Stuck in the dorm over spring
break? No idea what to do? Con
sider checking out Bay Area
bookstores.
This part of California is sup
posed to be a literary Mecca,
and indeed it contains more
than its share of privately
owned bookshops that have not
yet been bought out or pushed
out of business by con
glomerates such as Walden
books or B. Dalton Bookseller.
Such chain stores have their
advantages (low price, infinite
availability of bestsellers). But,
with their supermarket charac
teristics, they are hardly places
to relax and browse. The adven
turer who views a trip to the
bookstore less as a mission to
purchase than as an invitation
to explore, would do well to
spend some time this break
looking through the area's
smaller, dustier stores.
Fortunately, many such book
stores host readings, signings
and lectures by well-known and
not-so-well-known authors.
Such appearances provide an
ideal excuse to visit these stores,
take part in the scene, and
browse the shelves. They can
be as much political or cultural
happenings as literary events.
The following are the appear
ances schedueled at a few of the
area's bookstores:
