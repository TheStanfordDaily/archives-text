There are few subjects more
susceptible to the effects of misin
terpretation, stereotyping and ig
norance than the Holocaust.
"What can be said," the reader
asks, "that has not been said al
ready?"
The point of Primo Levi's last
book, published posthumously
(the Italian physicist — also a
Jewish survivor of Auschwitz —
committed suicide last April), con
fronts that question head on.
Levi does goes over some terri
tory that has been gone over
before and realizes the reader
probably will have heard parts of
the story. His retelling is pred
icated on the notion that the
reader has transformed, by that
very repetition, the actual events
in the concentration camps into
an ossified stereotype.
The underlying aim of Levi's
book is to ask (not answer)
whether Auschwitz and its fellow
camps were isolated terrors, the
products of a few stunted minds
drunk with power, or repeatable
experiments.
Could the camps resurface?
Obviously, Levi does not think
this question is moot. Memory,
in his words, is a "marvelous but
fallacious instrument," prey to all
shades of denial, invention and
caprice; today the Holocaust is not
the profound reminder of human
folly that it was during the first
months and years after the libera
tion of the camps. What Levi calls
"raw memory" can be replaced by
a wishful paradigm of what the
rawness actually was — a cops
and-robbers bas relief. This re
placement is, perversely enough,
even more likely to occur if the
memory is called on repeatedly —
if it is rehashed rather than un

acknowledged.
"Never," writes Levi of the
Holocaust, "have so many human
lives been extinguished in so short
a time, and with so lucid a com
bination of technological ingenu
ity, fanaticism and cruelty."
People with lists of relatively ig
nored atrocities — Armenians
slaughtered by Turks, Cam
bodians by fellow Cambodians,
Haitians by Tontons Macoutes,
Argentinians by their generalis
simos — can strip Levi's sentence
of its qualifiers and say that, per
haps, the Holocaust is not so
unique after all.
Why, then, pay attention to the
Holocaust when this century —
more cynically, all of history —
is bloated with such episodes?
Levi's blunt answer: because
the Nazis wanted the world to
forget.
Levi quotes Simon Wiesenthal,
who recalls that SS guards used

to line up prisoners and tell them,
"People will say that the events
you describe are too monstrous
to be believed. We will be the ones
to dictate the history of the
camps."
In this light, then, Levi wants
an accounting — not roman
ticism. Indeed, he spends a good
deal of time putting to rest the
notion that the Jews were some
how one mass of heroism united
against the Nazi tide.
Most were forced, for the mere
purpose of getting enough bread
to last through to the next day,
to enter into humiliating arrange
ments of employment against
their fellows. The newcomer had
to figure out the maze of acqui
escence and compromise from his
first minute in the camp, even if
deciphering it meant turning like
a cur against future newcomers.
