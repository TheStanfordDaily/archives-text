## Drowning in memories Levi's last book is an enduring testimonial 
### The Drowned the Saved" By Primo Levi

There are few subjects more
susceptible to the effects of misin
terpretation, stereotyping and ig
norance than the Holocaust.
"What can be said," the reader
asks, "that has not been said al
ready?"
The point of Primo Levi's last
book, published posthumously
(the Italian physicist — also a
Jewish survivor of Auschwitz —
committed suicide last April), con
fronts that question head on.
Levi does goes over some terri
tory that has been gone over
before and realizes the reader
probably will have heard parts of
the story. His retelling is pred
icated on the notion that the
reader has transformed, by that
very repetition, the actual events
in the concentration camps into
an ossified stereotype.
The underlying aim of Levi's
book is to ask (not answer)
whether Auschwitz and its fellow
camps were isolated terrors, the
products of a few stunted minds
drunk with power, or repeatable
experiments.
Could the camps resurface?
Obviously, Levi does not think
this question is moot. Memory,
in his words, is a "marvelous but
fallacious instrument," prey to all
shades of denial, invention and
caprice; today the Holocaust is not
the profound reminder of human
folly that it was during the first
months and years after the libera
tion of the camps. What Levi calls
"raw memory" can be replaced by
a wishful paradigm of what the
rawness actually was — a cops
and-robbers bas relief. This re
placement is, perversely enough,
even more likely to occur if the
memory is called on repeatedly —
if it is rehashed rather than un

acknowledged.
"Never," writes Levi of the
Holocaust, "have so many human
lives been extinguished in so short
a time, and with so lucid a com
bination of technological ingenu
ity, fanaticism and cruelty."
People with lists of relatively ig
nored atrocities — Armenians
slaughtered by Turks, Cam
bodians by fellow Cambodians,
Haitians by Tontons Macoutes,
Argentinians by their generalis
simos — can strip Levi's sentence
of its qualifiers and say that, per
haps, the Holocaust is not so
unique after all.
Why, then, pay attention to the
Holocaust when this century —
more cynically, all of history —
is bloated with such episodes?
Levi's blunt answer: because
the Nazis wanted the world to
forget.
Levi quotes Simon Wiesenthal,
who recalls that SS guards used

to line up prisoners and tell them,
"People will say that the events
you describe are too monstrous
to be believed. We will be the ones
to dictate the history of the
camps."
In this light, then, Levi wants
an accounting — not roman
ticism. Indeed, he spends a good
deal of time putting to rest the
notion that the Jews were some
how one mass of heroism united
against the Nazi tide.
Most were forced, for the mere
purpose of getting enough bread
to last through to the next day,
to enter into humiliating arrange
ments of employment against
their fellows. The newcomer had
to figure out the maze of acqui
escence and compromise from his
first minute in the camp, even if
deciphering it meant turning like
a cur against future newcomers.
Gradually, as in any social
hierarchy, the law of privilege
asserted itself, and Jew used fist
against Jew if it meant defending
a position which would keep him
out of death's way. This law held
true even if the position being
defended was one in which the
Jew picked gold fillings out of
corpses' teeth before shoveling
them into crematoria.
Those who resisted such collu
sion — who failed to crack the
code — are all now dead. Levi
explores the guilt of the survivor.
By all accounts, the survivors
should be greatful that they came
out of Auschwitz, Dachau,
Sobibor alive. But Levi's suicide
forces us to question this accepted
wisdom.
Does such accounting square
with the outraged questions
people put to them with growing
intensity as the time of the camps
grows foggier? Does that account
ing jibe with the pain the sur
vivors themselves feel over having
been forced to smear themselves
with the Nazi's own filth in order
to stay alive? Is such a life worth
it?
A place where prisoners had to
use a porcelain pot, found through
sheer luck, as a soup decanter,
washbasin and toilet in the same
day is a place which resists the
conventional black-and-white dis
sections of the moralistic outsider
— and, Levi asserts, of the shame
ridden survivor.
The urge to sift order from
rubble causes us to shackle truth
in unwieldy categories (such as
the impotent Jew, who "could"
have escaped if he had really
wanted to, versus the animalistic
German, who, brutal as he was,
"must" have been equally stupid

and therefore surmountable).
When we are confronted with am
biguous truth, we react violently.
That reaction, Levi feels, is in
keeping with the chaos of the
camp itself.
It could be said that we have
seen enough Holocaust books. It
could be countered that the best
way to ignore history is to say
that we have seen enough of it.
"Few countries," writes Levi, "can
be considered immune to a future
tide of violence generated by in
tolerance, lust for power, eco
nomic difficulties, religious or po
litical fanaticism and racialist at
tritions."
Levi, therefore, is hardly san
guine about the prospects of
avoiding another Holocaust. He
does not know when, but he says

it certainly could happen.
Many may find little in this
review they have not heard before.
If true, it is because it is hard in
a review to do justice to "The
Drowned and the Saved," no mat
ter how lucid the arguments or
how lyrical the prose, because
Levi's experiences were so
removed from the present day.
This is not a dismissal of the
book's power, nor of its univer
sality. "The Drowned and the
Saved" is a stunning essay.
The admission here is that the
reviewer's limitations are insu
perable. The reader must read the
book himself to receive the full
impact of its message.

There are few subjects more
susceptible to the effects of misin
terpretation, stereotyping and ig
norance than the Holocaust.
"What can be said," the reader
asks, "that has not been said al
ready?"
The point of Primo Levi's last
book, published posthumously
(the Italian physicist — also a
Jewish survivor of Auschwitz —
committed suicide last April), con
fronts that question head on.
Levi does goes over some terri
tory that has been gone over
before and realizes the reader
probably will have heard parts of
the story. His retelling is pred
icated on the notion that the
reader has transformed, by that
very repetition, the actual events
in the concentration camps into
an ossified stereotype.
The underlying aim of Levi's
book is to ask (not answer)
whether Auschwitz and its fellow
camps were isolated terrors, the
products of a few stunted minds
drunk with power, or repeatable
experiments.
Could the camps resurface?
Obviously, Levi does not think
this question is moot. Memory,
in his words, is a "marvelous but
fallacious instrument," prey to all
shades of denial, invention and
caprice; today the Holocaust is not
the profound reminder of human
folly that it was during the first
months and years after the libera
tion of the camps. What Levi calls
"raw memory" can be replaced by
a wishful paradigm of what the
rawness actually was — a cops
and-robbers bas relief. This re
placement is, perversely enough,
even more likely to occur if the
memory is called on repeatedly —
if it is rehashed rather than un

acknowledged.
"Never," writes Levi of the
Holocaust, "have so many human
lives been extinguished in so short
a time, and with so lucid a com
bination of technological ingenu
ity, fanaticism and cruelty."
People with lists of relatively ig
nored atrocities — Armenians
slaughtered by Turks, Cam
bodians by fellow Cambodians,
Haitians by Tontons Macoutes,
Argentinians by their generalis
simos — can strip Levi's sentence
of its qualifiers and say that, per
haps, the Holocaust is not so
unique after all.
Why, then, pay attention to the
Holocaust when this century —
more cynically, all of history —
is bloated with such episodes?
Levi's blunt answer: because
the Nazis wanted the world to
forget.
Levi quotes Simon Wiesenthal,
who recalls that SS guards used

to line up prisoners and tell them,
"People will say that the events
you describe are too monstrous
to be believed. We will be the ones
to dictate the history of the
camps."
In this light, then, Levi wants
an accounting — not roman
ticism. Indeed, he spends a good
deal of time putting to rest the
notion that the Jews were some
how one mass of heroism united
against the Nazi tide.
Most were forced, for the mere
purpose of getting enough bread
to last through to the next day,
to enter into humiliating arrange
ments of employment against
their fellows. The newcomer had
to figure out the maze of acqui
escence and compromise from his
first minute in the camp, even if
deciphering it meant turning like
a cur against future newcomers.
Gradually, as in any social
hierarchy, the law of privilege
asserted itself, and Jew used fist
against Jew if it meant defending
a position which would keep him
out of death's way. This law held
true even if the position being
defended was one in which the
Jew picked gold fillings out of
corpses' teeth before shoveling
them into crematoria.
Those who resisted such collu
sion — who failed to crack the
code — are all now dead. Levi
explores the guilt of the survivor.
By all accounts, the survivors
should be greatful that they came
out of Auschwitz, Dachau,
Sobibor alive. But Levi's suicide
forces us to question this accepted
wisdom.
Does such accounting square
with the outraged questions
people put to them with growing
intensity as the time of the camps
grows foggier? Does that account
ing jibe with the pain the sur
vivors themselves feel over having
been forced to smear themselves
with the Nazi's own filth in order
to stay alive? Is such a life worth
it?
A place where prisoners had to
use a porcelain pot, found through
sheer luck, as a soup decanter,
washbasin and toilet in the same
day is a place which resists the
conventional black-and-white dis
sections of the moralistic outsider
— and, Levi asserts, of the shame
ridden survivor.
The urge to sift order from
rubble causes us to shackle truth
in unwieldy categories (such as
the impotent Jew, who "could"
have escaped if he had really
wanted to, versus the animalistic
German, who, brutal as he was,
"must" have been equally stupid

and therefore surmountable).
When we are confronted with am
biguous truth, we react violently.
That reaction, Levi feels, is in
keeping with the chaos of the
camp itself.
It could be said that we have
seen enough Holocaust books. It
could be countered that the best
way to ignore history is to say
that we have seen enough of it.
"Few countries," writes Levi, "can
be considered immune to a future
tide of violence generated by in
tolerance, lust for power, eco
nomic difficulties, religious or po
litical fanaticism and racialist at
tritions."
Levi, therefore, is hardly san
guine about the prospects of
avoiding another Holocaust. He
does not know when, but he says

it certainly could happen.
Many may find little in this
review they have not heard before.
If true, it is because it is hard in
a review to do justice to "The
Drowned and the Saved," no mat
ter how lucid the arguments or
how lyrical the prose, because
Levi's experiences were so
removed from the present day.
This is not a dismissal of the
book's power, nor of its univer
sality. "The Drowned and the
Saved" is a stunning essay.
