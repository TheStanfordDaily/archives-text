# The 						roots of conflict
## Myths Collide in Gaza 
### Bruce Brown 
Those who attended Columbia Prof. Edward
Said's lecture on international terrorism early last
month were told, in Prof. Lan Watt's introductory
remarks, of Said's important scholarship on an ob
vious but neglected area of literary studies: the
ideology of beginnings.
Said did not talk specifically about beginnings in
his speech, but his subject — Middle East politics
— had everything to do with them. For essentially
what he delivered to his listeners were thoughts on
origins — of both political terrorism and the present
Palestinian issue — as a means to challenge the
historical claims of Israel in the region.
When does the history of modern Palestine begin,
then? With Israel's founding? With its occupation
of Gaza and the West Bank? With the awful drift
of the first column of smoke from a Nazi death
camp? The Balfour Declaration? Ottoman rule? With
the visions of Mohammed? The invading Roman
legions? The teachings of Jesus? The fall of the
second Temple? The deeds of Abraham?
The problem is that neighborhood feuding will
forever resist a singular interpretation; the chronicle
of any nation or people is one among a multiplicity.
And so to cite tradition, to place one origin or
beginning above another in the search for moral
or political authority, is most often to do nothing
but incite further hostility.
That Primo Levi, in the conclusion to "The
Drowned and the Saved," writes: "Desperate, the
Jewish survivors in flight from Europe after the
great shipwreck have created in the bosom of the
Arab world an island of Western civilization, a por
tentous palingenesis of Judaism, and the pretext
for renewed hatred," reveals his peculiar dilemma
as a survivor of the Holocaust and a writer charged
with the duty of rememberance: How do you break
the chain of violence? How do you draw the prop
of identity from the reserves of cultural memory
without calling forth competing myths of origin,
and more ugly intolerance?
For Levi to speak of deliberate beginnings, of
nation-making, and to realize that the terms of
Israel's appeal are, at least in part, historical, is
for him to recognize the "portentous" possibility,

'When does the history of modern
Palestine begin, then? With Isra
el's founding? With its occupation
of Gaza and the West Bank? With
the awful drift of the first column
of smoke from a Nazi death
camp?'

in the dual connotations of the word — both the
marvelous cultural potential and the ominous po
litical repercussions. "The Drowned and the Saved"
looks back at the brutal circus of the Nazi Reich,
at the lingering hostility in the world and finds its
irony in the perception that the post-war passage
to regeneration has but led to more violence.
An observer of the all too casual tragedy of the
Middle East finds himself seized by the way in
which the beneficent power of cutural tradition,
when translated into the political arena, has helped
propel historical hatred in the area. David Gros
sman's recent New Yorker magazine pieces on the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict echo this dirge of local
bloodshed at times called Punjab or Ulster, and
today called Gaza and the West Bank.
Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of Gros
sman's narrative is his description of a recent study
by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem charted the
dreams of Jewish and Arab children in Israel and
the occupied areas and discovered them filled with
a harrowing fear of the "other" — the "other"
among whom each is destined to live. These children
are already fighting the battle over origin, caught
within the treacherous currents of contending titles
to historical legitimacy.
No mistake that in "Ulysses" Leopold Bloom
brings history into his eloquent barroom diatribe
against nationalist violence: "Force, hatred, history,
all that. That's not life for men and women, insult
and hatred."
