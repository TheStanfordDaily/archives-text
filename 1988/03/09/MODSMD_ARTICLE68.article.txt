# 'Underdog' men at Pac-10s
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Although it is the defending na
tional champion, the Stanford
men's swimming team is entering
the Pacific 10 Championships as
an underdog.
Facing its toughest conference
competition in four years, the Car-

dinal, ranked sixth nationally, takes on top
ranked Southern California, third-ranked Cali
fornia, fourth-ranked UCLA and three other
league competitors today, Thursday and Friday
in Long Beach for the Pac-10 crown.
Even though it has been defeated by USC,
UCLA and Cal earlier this season, the Cardinal
is confident it can flatten the competition. Sport
ing matching flat-tops and freshly shaven bodies,
Stanford is optimistic about taking its seventh
consecutive conference title.
"It was hard to lose meets, but I don't think
they are going to have a negative effect on our
performance in the meet," junior butterflier Rich
Roll said. "If anything, they have psyched us up
more because we're the underdog and have some
thing to prove. And everybody getting haircuts
has really brought us together."
Stanford is bringing a full squad — 19 swim
mers — to the competition, as well as four ad
ditional swimmers who will only be allowed to
swim trials. The teams' two divers competed in
the Pac-10 Diving Championships two weeks ago

at Arizona and won both the one- and three-meter
competitions.
Although competition in the Pac-10 is much
tougher (with six top-20 squads), and teams are
closer in ability than in previous seasons, the
shaved and rested Cardinal squad is counting on
its former success in championship meets to carry
it to victory.
"The experience of the guys who have competed
before is going to be really helpful," tri-captain
Sean Murphy said. "Although the younger guys
are unaware of what the meet is like, the fact
that they are new will hopefully create the ex
citement necessary for heightened perform
ances."
"We're a real veteran team, and the guys un
derstand what they have to do," Stanford Coach
Skip Kenney said. "The guys are really fired up
and their approach to the meet is great."
One advantage the Cardinal has is that the
Trojans, Bruins and Bears tapered and shaved
in December, while almost the entire Stanford
squad is rested. Traditionally, the team with the
most swimmers shaved has been victorious.
According to freestyle sprinter Doug Lillydahl,
the team needs to get momentum going at the
beginning of the meet and do well in the first
events, especially the 500 free and 400 medley
relay. "We definitely need to get off on the right
foot. The longer it takes to get rolling the harder
it will be for us, and we've waited a long time
to win this season," he said.
