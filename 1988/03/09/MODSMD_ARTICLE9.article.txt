# Trustees set tuition increase
## 
### Matt Poppe Staff writer 
The University Board of Trustees approved a 5.9
percent overall increase in tuition and room and
board rates yesterday. The increases are expected
to maintain Stanford's room and board rates as the
highest in the country, while tuition should rank
just below the 10 most expensive institutions in
the nation.
Tuition for next year will be $12,564, up 5.75
percent from this year's fee $11,880. This is the
University's lowest rate of increase in the past
decade. Stanford currently ranks 11th in tuition
costs among comparable institutions.

Tuition covers roughly half of Stanford's annual
$320-million operating budget, which is projected
to increase about 1.5 percent above inflation.
According to a report issued by the board, "budget
increases above inflation (are needed) in order to
retain and attract a faculty and staff of Stanford's
caliber." The paper explained that the University's
budget is predominantly salary-driven and called
competition for the best new faculty "stiffer than
at any time in the past."
"Raiding" of the University's faculty by other
schools is a particular worry, the report said.
Room and board costs will rise 6.1 percent, from
$4,955 to $5,257 per year.
The current high cost of room
and board is largely the result of
operating costs for new graduate
student apartments and the con
tinuing development of the Uni
versity's Residential Education
program, according to the report.
Next year's 6.1-percent hike,
much higher than that of most
other schools, is primarily due to
the fall quarter closing of Roble
Hall, the report said.
$5.6 million in savings from the
refinancing of the University's
tax-exempt bonds will also be
diverted to to help meet the costs
of replacing or restoring the 296
units in Roble, according to the
report.
In other business, the trustees
approved a program of seismic
bracing for the Hoover House, the
traditional residence of the Uni
versity president. The bracing is
scheduled to begin in April and
finish about a year later. Prelim
inary cost estimates range from
$1.5 to $5 million.
According to the report, the fu
ture of Roble is also a top priority
of the trustees. Because of the
dorm's large size, engineering
design and cost studies have not
yet been completed.
