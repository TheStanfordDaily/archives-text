# Federal grant helps center combat digestive diseases

Stanford Medical Center scientists hope to com
bat two dangerous digestive diseases in research
projects that are being funded by a a $2.5 million
federal grant.
Rotavirus — a form of diarrhea responsible
for 40 percent of world infant deaths — and
hepatitis will be examined at Stanford's new
Digestive Diseases Center. The center will utilize
the latest techniques of molecular biology, in
cluding gene cloning.
Opened last September, the center is based at
the Medical Center and the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Medical Center. The research fa
cility's grant from the National Institutes of
Health will last until September 1993.
The center does not have a clinical component,
but instead focuses on research. Gary Gray, di
rector of the center and professor of medicine
in the Division of Gastroenterology, said, "The
main purpose (of the center) is to get people who
do first class research to work together and share
techniques."

However, Gray said that NIH is hoping to
make more money available in the future to Rind
clinical developments.
Small pilot studies spinning off of the m*yor
experiments, each costing about $20,000, will
give Stanford students a chance to get involved
with the research.
Gray explained that the center will consist of
three different scientific support laboratories,
each with a cluster of high technology equipment
and researchers.
The idea for a digestive disease research center
is not new. Twelve similar NIH-funded centers
exist nationwide. To win the funding, Gray said,
the Stanford contigency "put together a strong
proposal."
Gray said having the center here will be "a
real kudo for the University and the Medical
School." He said the project is "potentially very
appealing to (monetary) donors and we hope to
take advantage of that."
Gray's own research focuses on the functioning
of hormonal receptors found in the liver and
intestine, and their effect on the normal absorp
tion and metabolism of nutrients.
