A story in the March 9 issue
of The Daily took statements
made by Ohio Gov. Richard
Celeste and his wife, Dagmar, out
of context. The story presented
the quotes as responding to alle
gations about their private lives
printed last year by the Cleveland
Plain Dealer. In fact, The Daily
asked the Celestes broader ques
tions about the role of the media
in investigating the private lives
of public officials, without giving
them a chance to refute the alle
gations directly.
