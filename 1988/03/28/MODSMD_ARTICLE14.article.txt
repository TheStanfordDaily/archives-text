MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The left
ist Sandinista government, in its first
important step to comply with Wed
nesday's cease-fire accord with the
Contra rebels, freed 100 political
prisoners yesterday.
At the midday release ceremony at
Managua's Zona Franca prison, Inte
rior Minister Tomas Borge warmly
supported the cease-fire agreement,
calling it"the only way to achieve a
permanent, dignified peace." Borge's
speech dispelled concerns that there
might be differences over the pact
among the nine top comandantes who
head the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front.
The release came amid signs of con
tinuing dissension among the Contras
and their supporters over the accord,
signed in the southern border town of
Sapoa. The directors of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the Contra alliance, said
at Sapoa they would present the gov
ernment with a list of prisoners they
wanted liberated yesterday.
But their roster, prepared Saturday
in occasionally stormy meetings in
Miami, was finished too late for the
required approval by the Sandinista

dominated National Assembly. Contra
negotiators have been preoccupied
since Wednesday answering criticism
from their partisans that they settled
for too little at Sapoa and exposed
Contra fighters to danger.
The list of those freed yesterday was
drawn up by the government and ap
proved by the National Assembly Sat
urday. It nevertheless included
prisoners whose cases were widely
publicized by human rights groups and
dozens of members of opposition
groups.
One was Roberto Narvaez, a Contra
pilot shot down by Sandinista gunners
Oct. 3, 1983, while flying supplies to
rebel fighters. Amador, who was
robust and dark-haired when im
prisoned, emerged yesterday with grey
hair and with his back in a brace to
ease the pain of a spinal fracture he
suffered when his plane crashed.
As he was smothered by the
embraces of relatives sobbing for joy,
Amador said he never renounced his
affiliation with the Contras while in
Sandinista hands. But yesterday, he
said, he is "apolitical," and he plans
to live in Miami. Amador said his treat

ment in jail was "sometimes average
and sometimes bad, but never good."
Also freed was 28-year-old Manuel
Rugama, a physician whose mother,
Violeta, is a founding member of the
January 22 Movement, the committee
of relatives of political prisoners that
has been repeatedly harassed by San
dinista authorities.
About 1,400 Nicaraguans accused of
collaborating with the Contras remain
in Sandinista jails, according to gov
ernment and International Red Cross
figures, as well as about 1,850 former
soldiers of the National Guard of the
late dictator Anastasio Somoza.
Several hundred more who have not
been tried are believed to be in other
jails.
Under the Sapoa agreement, half of
those accused of helping the Contras
will be released April 15, when Contra
fighters are to have finished moving
into cease-fire zones. The other half
will be freed when a final cease-fire
pact is reached through negotiations
to begin April 6.
The National Guardsmen are to be
freed only after the war is ended. Their
cases will be reviewed by the human

rights commission of the Organization
of American States to avoid freeing
those guilty of war atrocities. The Na
tional Assembly approved the amnesty
law Saturday.
Sandinista leaders said over the
weekend that the amnesty, particu
larly for the National Guardsmen, has
consistently met more opposition from
followers of the Sandinista party than
any other concession proposed under
a regional peace plan reached last Au
gust by the five Central American
countries.
Ortega told reporters Saturday night
it had been harder for him to persuade
his party to accept the amnesty than
to accept the political negotiations
with the Contras that culminated at
Sapoa.
"It's a terribly sensitive point," Or
tega said. "Every time we free
prisoners, when I travel out to the
rural towns, I hear protests from the
people, and I have to make a tremen
dous effort to explain it to them." The
government pardoned 985 prisoners
in November.

from their partisans that they settled
for too little at Sapoa and exposed
Contra fighters to danger.
The list of those freed yesterday was
drawn up by the government and ap
proved by the National Assembly Sat
urday. It nevertheless included
prisoners whose cases were widely
publicized by human rights groups and
dozens of members of opposition
groups.
One was Roberto Narvaez, a Contra
pilot shot down by Sandinista gunners
Oct. 3, 1983, while flying supplies to
rebel fighters. Amador, who was
robust and dark-haired when im
prisoned, emerged yesterday with grey
hair and with his back in a brace to
ease the pain of a spinal fracture he
suffered when his plane crashed.
As he was smothered by the
embraces of relatives sobbing for joy,
Amador said he never renounced his
affiliation with the Contras while in
Sandinista hands. But yesterday, he
said, he is "apolitical," and he plans
to live in Miami. Amador said his treat

ment in jail was "sometimes average
and sometimes bad, but never good."
Also freed was 28-year-old Manuel
Rugama, a physician whose mother,
Violeta, is a founding member of the
January 22 Movement, the committee
of relatives of political prisoners that
has been repeatedly harassed by San
dinista authorities.
About 1,400 Nicaraguans accused of
collaborating with the Contras remain
in Sandinista jails, according to gov
ernment and International Red Cross
figures, as well as about 1,850 former
soldiers of the National Guard of the
late dictator Anastasio Somoza.
Several hundred more who have not
been tried are believed to be in other
jails.
Under the Sapoa agreement, half of
those accused of helping the Contras
will be released April 15, when Contra
fighters are to have finished moving
into cease-fire zones. The other half
will be freed when a final cease-fire
pact is reached through negotiations
to begin April 6.
The National Guardsmen are to be
freed only after the war is ended. Their
cases will be reviewed by the human

rights commission of the Organization
of American States to avoid freeing
those guilty of war atrocities. The Na
tional Assembly approved the amnesty
law Saturday.
Sandinista leaders said over the
weekend that the amnesty, particu
larly for the National Guardsmen, has
consistently met more opposition from
followers of the Sandinista party than
any other concession proposed under
a regional peace plan reached last Au
gust by the five Central American
countries.
Ortega told reporters Saturday night
it had been harder for him to persuade
his party to accept the amnesty than
to accept the political negotiations
with the Contras that culminated at
Sapoa.
"It's a terribly sensitive point," Or
tega said. "Every time we free
prisoners, when I travel out to the
rural towns, I hear protests from the
people, and I have to make a tremen
dous effort to explain it to them." The
government pardoned 985 prisoners
in November.
