# Israel may seal off troubled territories
## 
### 
JERUSALEM - Top Israeli
officials are weighing a pro
posal to seal off the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip this
week as part of security precau
tions against major demonstra
tions planned for Wednesday
by both Israeli Arabs and Pal
estinians from the territories,
a senior security source said
yesterday.
The source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said
that the proposed ban would
prevent residents on both sides
of the so-called Green Line
from crossing it.
The invisible boundary
divides pre-1967 Israel from
the West Bank and Gaza Strip
areas that it occupied after the
1967 Arab-Israeli War. About
700,000 Palestinian Arabs live
as Israeli citizens inside Israel
proper and 1.4 million are

either stateless or hold Jor
danian citizenship in the ter
ritories.
Israeli Arabs have declared
a general strike for Wednesday
as an expression of solidarity
with the Palestinian uprising
that has rocked the West Bank
and Gaza Strip for nearly 16
weeks.
The self-styled Unified Na
tional Leadership for the
Uprising in the Occupied Ter
ritories has also called for a
general strike that day and for
"huge demonstrations against
the army and (Jewish) set
tlers."
Fearing that the so-called
"Land Day" protests may lead
to widespread violence, the au
thorities are reportedly plan
ning a long list of counter
measures.
