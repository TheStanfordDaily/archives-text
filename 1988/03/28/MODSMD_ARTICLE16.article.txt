# Democratic race wide open
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Jesse Jackson's
breakthrough victory in Michigan Saturday
has transformed him into a formidable con
tender for the Democratic presidential
nomination and prompted shellshocked
party leaders to question Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis' ability to compete
with him.
Several sources close to New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, said yesterday
that he has "postponed indefinitely" any
decision to throw his considerable support
behind Dukakis. "He was this close," said
one longtime associate, holding his fingers
a quarter-inch apart, "but he's backed off."
The Michigan contest, which Jackson
won by a massive 55 to 28 percent over
Dukakis, effectively ended the candidacy
of the third-place finisher, Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt, who has scheduled a
news conference for 3 p.m. today in the
Capitol at which he is expected to drop
out and announce that he will seek re
election to the House.
Jackson, in winning for the first time in
a northern industrial state, has been pro
pelled to the center stage of the nomination
fight.
In continuing to perform far beyond ex
pectations, Jackson has not only rear
ranged almost all the basic assumptions

about the 1988 race but has also begun to
force party leaders to face up to a potential
dilemma: the prospect that their nominee
will be a black, left-wing preacher, still
considered by almost all of them to be
unelectable in the fall.
"This is a killer," said one party leader,
who asked not to be identified. "This hurts.
Either way it hurts. Down one path we
have to turn our backs on everything this
party has purported to stand for — and
on our most loyal voting bloc. Down the
other, we face certain disaster in the fall."
The easiest way for Democrats to steer
clear of this double-bind would be for a
mainstream, white candidate to take com
mand of the nomination contest in the 10
weeks of primaries and caucuses ahead.
But with 32 state contests now history,
that hasn't happened yet. And while Du
kakis is by far the best-funded and best
positioned white candidate heading into the
final stretch, his 28 percent showing in
Michigan Saturday, coming on the heels
of his third-place, 17 percent showing in
the Illinois primary two weeks ago, raises
some emperor-with-no-clothes doubts
about his $20 million campaign of implied
inevitability.
