Israeli jailed for cowardice
TEL AVIV, Israel — A 19-year-old Israeli
soldier was sentenced here yesterday to three
years in jail for cowardice during a suicide
attack by a Palestinian guerrilla flying a
motorized hang-glider.
The Tel Aviv court martial found that the
"shameful behaviour" of Roni Almog led to
the deaths of six Israeli soldiers.
Almog was on sentry duty in the early hours
of Nov. 5, 1987, at the gate of an army base
in northern Israel when the guerrilla attacked.
Almog admitted that he slipped away from
his post when he saw the guerrilla coming.
The court said, "Instead of stopping the ter
rorist, he abandoned his duty and his post."
The court-martial called his behaviour
"shameful and cowardly."
Almog said after he was sentenced: "I wish
I was dead. I am no coward but I'm not a
hero either." He said he had been made a
scapegoat.
Two other Israeli soldiers, one the officer
in charge on the night of the attack, were
convicted and sentenced several weeks ago.
Prosecutors said they ignored warnings
relayed via their regional headquarters from
border surveillance forces.
The officer was demoted to enlisted man
and a non-commissioned officer was given a
suspended jail sentence.
Bangladesh government named
DHAKA, Bangladesh — President Hussain
Ershad named a 32-member Bangladeshi gov
ernment yesterday, appointing a new prime
minister and reshuffling his Cabinet just three
weeks after a controversial parliamentary elec
tion gave his ruling Jatiyo Party a landslide
victory.
Ershad appointed Deputy Prime Minister
Moudud Ahmed the new premier, dropping
incumbent Mizanur Chowdhury. Vice Presi
dent Justice Nurul Islam remains unaffected
by the changes.
The new government, which was sworn into
office yesterday evening, came amid threats
by mainstream opposition parties to mount a
fresh campaign in April to push for the res
ignation of the 58-year-old former army chief
who came to power six years ago in a military
coup.
Ershad restored civilian rule in November
1986, but the country's two largest opposition
parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, claim that he is over
shadowed by the army.
