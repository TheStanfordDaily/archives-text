## Make reparations 
### 
112 STANFORD community
has an obligation to support
JL the letter-writing campaign
underway here backing the bill
now before Congress that offers
an official apology and reparations
to Japanese-Americans imprisoned
during World War 11.
An enterprising Stanford law
student drafted a letter to Presi
dent Reagan in support of the Civil
Liberties Bill of 1987, which pro
vides for a payment of $20,000 to
each surviving former internee and
the establishment of an educa
tional fund to increase awareness
of the internments in an effort to
prevent similar actions in the fu
ture.
The letter correctly points out
that "by acknowledging the injus
tice that Japanese-Americans were
made to suffer, we can strengthen
those constitutional principles
which our people have long
cherished but which our nation has
often forgotten."
Too many people do not know
that the United States imprisoned
120,000 Japanese-Americans in
California during World War II —
despite FBI and Justice Depart
ment assurances that the great
majority of the internees posed no
security threat. Around 60,000 of
those interned are still alive.
Of course, no sum of money
could adequately compensate these
Japanese-Americans who were im
prisoned without trial, who were
evacuated from their homes and
who lost their property and
livelihoods. But those opposing the

bill's section concerning financial
compensation, such as Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., must understand
that the $20,000 is necessary to
show that the United States is fi
nally recognizing and apologizing
for this grave mistake.
While the internees in the
United States were not treated as
horribly as those imprisoned by
Germany in concentration camps,
the breach of basic civil rights is
similar. In the years since the war,
we have been too willing to con
demn the Germans' actions with
out fully examining those of our
own country and state.
In times of great fear and crisis,
the Constitution should be adhered
to as diligently as ever. If those
who enforce it buckle at the first
sign of trouble, it is a meaningless
document.
In 1988 we are by no means free
from the kind of irrational hysteria
that produced the imprisonment
of the Japanese-Americans. In Cal
ifornia, Lyndon Laßouche's
Proposition 64, which was defeated
in 1986, and its twin, Proposition
69, which is on the ballot this year,
call for the imprisonment of mem
bers of so-called high-risk groups
for AIDS under the pseudoscien
tific guise of a quarantine.
This would include gay men, he
mophiliacs, prostitutes and in
travenous drug users.
If we think that something like
the Japanese-American intern
ments couldn't happen again —
not here, not now — we are in
dulging in wishful thinking.
