# Hospital, nurses' union settle
## Agreement averts strike, but many nurses are 'not satisfied' 
### Erin Martin Editorial staff 
Just two days before a second
scheduled strike deadline, a Stan
ford nurses' union and the Stan
ford Hospital — with the assis
tance of a federal mediator — last
week averted a strike that would
have moved almost all of the
hospital's nursing staff from their
posts to picket lines.
Members of the nurses' union,
the Committee for the Recogni
tion of Nursing Achievement,
voted 788 to 281 March 16 in
favor of the new contract, but
CRONA press representative
Donalda Dunnett said many
nurses were still "not satisfied"
with the hospital's offer.
Priscilla Wheeler, chief negoti
ator for the hospital and labor
attorney for the University, said
she sensed "some disenchant
ment" among the nurses because
problems with working conditions

such as overtime, understaffing
and on-call arrangements were
not addressed in the pact. But
she added that the contract is one
of the best available to nurses in
the Bay Area.
In fact, the average salary of
Stanford nurses will be about
$39,000 per year after the con
tract, in contrast to the current
$36,000 average salary of nurses
at the Bay Area hospital network
Kaiser Permanente.
Wheeler cited what she called
a "decisive" vote as evidence of
the nurses' support of the new
plan.
The federal mediator — who
was called in March 7 by both
negotiating parties — informed
nurses that "the package was the
best Stanford had to offer," ac
cording to Dunnett.
The new two-year contract al
lows for 5 percent annual raises
and an additional 4.5 percent in
crease for nurses employed at

Stanford for more than seven and
a half years. Originally, CRONA
asked for 6 percent annual raises
and a 4.5 percent increase for its
senior nurses.
Dunnet said the nurses reluc
tantly resigned themselves to ac
cepting the offer. "The feeling was
that we were going to have to
work within the system," she said.
CRONA's contract expired Feb.
28. The union issued a 10-day
strike threat on March 1 and re
issued the threat on March 8 after
a tentative agreement reached
March 3 was overwhelmingly
rejected by the union.
Though many of the union's
1,300 members are still upset
about working conditions, Dun
nett and Wheeler are hopeful that
further problems can be elimi
nated by interaction of joint com
mittees of nurses and administra
tors.
"Given commitment from the
hospital, we may resolve these is

sues in the future," Dunnett said.
Historically, the hospital nur
sing administration has been very
responsive to working out nursing
issues, according to Wheeler.
Wheeler also said the union's
original proposal to the hospital
in late February was "solely eco
nomic," and other problems were
discussed later in the negotia
tions.
"The relationship of union
leaders and the hospital now is
such that these problems can be
worked out without drastic
means," Wheeler said.
Both Wheeler and Dunnett said
the federal mediator, Maggie
Jacobs, acted as a helpful and im
partial voice in the proceedings.
The patient census, reduced
when the strike appeared im
minent, is now at approximately
two-thirds of its normal capacity
of 663, and a few units of the
hospital are still closed, but hospi
tal operations are "slowly getting
back to normal," Wheeler said.
