## Health and safety has been neglected since 1982 
### 
WE APPRECIATE the March 9
coverage of University safety
policies but we would like to
clarify a few points.
The administration and its hard-line
labor negotiator Priscilla Wheeler have
played a major role in weakening
health and safety protections on
campus.
Prior to 1982, the United Stanford
Workers and the University had a
successful joint health and safety
committee under the USW contract.
This committee included workers and
University health and safety profes
sional staff.
This committee responded to em
ployee complaints, had the power to
investigate the cause of accidents and

was able to correct unsafe conditions.
This benefited not only the union
workers, but all employees at Stanford.
Like all committees, though, it had
room for improvement.
If Wheeler had been concerned about
the welfare of Stanford employees, she
would have helped strengthen and
expand this promising joint health and
safety committee during contract nego
tiations in 1982.
Instead, Wheeler gutted it. She
narrowed the committee's scope,
removed its broad investigatory powers
and restructured it to make it ineffec
tive. •'
Professional health and safety staff
were replaced by administrators who
were more concerned with protecting

the University's legal position than
with protecting workers. The result: no
effective University health and safety
protection for many Stanford employ
ees since 1982.
USW workers, however, have not
been defeatist about this situation.
With the union's help, workers have
called in state and federal agencies
such as Cal-OSHA and the Department
of Energy for the protection of all
employees.
Other union workers have stood
together as a group and have refused
to use unsafe chemicals or equipment.
USW workers also intend to get back
stronger contract language on health
and safety. We hope the Stanford

community understands that when we
negotiate this summer (our contract
expires Aug. 31), we are negotiating
for all Stanford employees.
We need the community's active
support in these negotiations on health
and safety and other community is
sues.
We'd also like to credit certain parts
of the University — such as Opera
tions and Maintenance and some pro
fessional health and safety staff who
have often been far more responsive
and responsible than the administra
tion as a whole when it comes to
health and safety.
