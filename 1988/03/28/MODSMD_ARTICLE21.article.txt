# Rent control isn't the biggest problem
## 
### 
Several Stanford law students have
recently rallied around East Palo Alto
council member Ruben Abrica and the
ballot item he initiated, Measure C, in
an effort to register East Palo Alto
renters for the coming April 12 elec
tion in which Abrica is a candidate.
I have no qualms with the demo
cratic intentions of Measure C nor
with the students' efforts to register
voters. What concerns me is that
Ruben Abirca has cleverly mobilized
these students in effect to campaign
for his re-election. God help us.
Ruben Abrica may be the champion
of rent control beneficiaries, but his
performance in dealing with the many
other far more critical issues the city
faces, such as rampant crime, inept
city management, abysmal public serv
ices and a pitiful tax base, has been a
disaster.
During his five-year tenure as a

council member, the quality of life in
this community has plummeted and
one only had to attend a city council
meeting to understand why.
We heed far-sighted, effective leader
ship from competent, committed
ejected officials. Ruben Abrica doesn't
cut it.
