# Is infectious waste incinerator unsafe?
## 
### 
The California Health and Safety
Code, Section 41700 reads: "No person
shall discharge from any source what
soever such quantities of air contami
nants or other materials which cause
injury, detriment, nuisance or annoy
ance to any considerable number of
persons or to the public, or which
endanger the comfort, repose, health or
safety of any such persons or the
public, or which cause, or have a natu
ral tendency to cause, ir\jury or

damage to business or property."
The scrubber for Stanford's infec
tious waste incinerator has clogged up
and exploded since its installation less
than a year ago. The University has
been granted permission four times to
use the incinerator while it fixed mal
functions.
These variances have been granted
by the Bay Area Air Quality Manage
ment District Hearing Board, the latest
being granted Feb. 18. The incinerator
is used to burn dead laboratory
animals and infectious hospital waste.
Stanford is unable to say if toxic
chemicals or radioactive items will be
destroyed in the incinerator in the
future. The Barron Park Association is
unable to get an answer to a very
simple question: "What is spewing out
of facilities incinerator?"
How can Stanford be allowed to
operate this incinerator if it is unable
to answer to the community the levels
and types of air pollution released to
our air? And how can the air quality
management board issue variances
when it doesn't know either, and

worse yet, doesn't ask for the data? Is
the California Health and Safety Code
being violated? No one knows!
