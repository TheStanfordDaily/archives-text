## Lessons are timeless 
### 
THE BELL SOUNDED, ringing in
the first day of school. I had waited
all my life for this moment when
the doors of wisdom and knowledge
would open for me. Sitting upright in
my chair, I eagerly awaited the answers
to life's mysteries. Kindergarten had
begun.
Only in my third year of law school
have I realized that kindergarten taught
me some of my most important lessons.
While most people probably remember
kindergarten for the flowering of their
fingerpainting talent or their athletic
prowess at recess, the powerful messages
that kindergarten transmitted are often
overlooked. Ironically, these messages
may have more meaning for the adult
world than for the toddler world.
In his article "All I Ever Really Needed
to Know I Learned in Kindergarten,"
Robert Fulghum contends that we would
all prosper much by remembering the
prophetic words of our kindergarten
teachers. Carrying this argument one
step further, I believe that we could solve
domestic and international problems if
we would only heed the following kin
dergarten advice:
• Listen to others before you speak. On
March 6, the board of trustees of Gal
laudet University, a college for the deaf,
continued a 124-year tradition by ap
pointing a non-hearing-impaired presi
dent, Elizabeth Ann Zinser, to administer
the university. It did not listen to student
demands for a hearing-impaired presi
dent.
It gave a deaf ear to faculty criticism
of its actions. A deafening storm of
protest ensued. To paraphrase Jesse
Jackson, the problem was not that the
students did not hear, but that the

hearing world did not listen. For five
days President Zinser listened, and on
the fifth day, when she spoke, she
resigned. Long reign Gallaudet's new,
deaf president, I. King Jordan!
• Be nice to others and they will be nice
to you. In Belfast, Northern Ireland in
mid-March, this Golden Rule was per
verted into "Kill others and they will kill
you." At a Catholic nationalist funeral
for three slain patriots Wednesday, a
grenade-throwing Protestant loyalist
killed three people.
There was another nationalist funeral
on Thursday and two on Friday. At the
Saturday funeral for a victim of Wednes
day's funeral murders, two British sol
diers who confronted a crowd of mourn
ers were dragged from their car, beaten
and shot to death.
The "battle of the funerals" was over
for the week. Score: Catholics: 2; Protes
tants/British: 12; Humanity: -14. A Cath
olic woman, echoing simple kindergarten,
wisdom, said of the killings: "Why would
anyone want to do that?"
• Clean up your mess. Ohio's smelter
emissions rain down on Canadian
countryside, destroying lakes and
wildlife. Russia's Chernobyl nuclear ac
cident radiates Polish children's milk
supply. European chemical companies
treat the Rhine River as their sewer. U.S.
industry's chlorofluorocarbon gases
punch holes in the ozone layer, substan
tially increasing the number of skin can
cer victims.
At some point, the captains of indus
trial progress, like kindergarteners, must
dedicate time, energy and resources to
cleaning up their messes. Unlike spilled
fingerpaint, worldwide environmental
damage cannot be wiped away with a

paper towel. It will require lowering prof
its, reducing standards of living and con
tributing more brainpower to protect the
environment from technology's
onslaught.
• Share your toys. Since 1776, two
philosophies have competed in American
thought: "Share Your Toys" and "Go
Find Your Own Toys (Like I Did)." The
tension between these two views reflects
the struggle between Rousseau and
Locke, de facto and de jure discrimina
tion, equal results and equal opportunity.
The time has come, however, to discard
the myth that equal opportunity will
create equal results, for the reality is
that only sortie 'people, some groups and
some nations will ever have equal oppop
tunity.
"Interdependence" is today's buzz
word. We must share our "toys" — ed
ucation (affirmative action), economic
power (Third World trade) and culture
(Stanford-Russia student exchange) —
before we have them rudely taken away
from us.
Following our kindergarten example,
we would all be better off if we took a
nap every afternoon, held hands and
stuck together. And don't forget: Always
flush.
