## Cardinal falls in second round of NIT Loss to Wildcats stops Pac-10 run 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz., March 13 — Several
times during the frenzied second-half
war on the floor of McKale Center,
the Stanford Cardinal found itself
trailing Arizona at the Wildcats'
home court by only 10 points. The
Cardinal needed a break, maybe even

a lucky break, to make this game a game.
Somebody somewhere, however, once said that
luck is when opportunity meets preparation. And
in the first half, it was Arizona that had done all
the preparing.
The Wildcats had blitzkrieged Stanford 55-33 in
the first 20 minutes.
That 22-point foundation was more than enough
to hold off several gutty Cardinal comeback runs,
and Arizona won 97-83 in the semifinals of the
Pacific 10 Conference Tournament. Thus, one of
the most entertaining and grueling halves of bas
ketball of the Stanford season was obscured by the
smoke of Arizona's blazing start.
"The one thing we couldn't allow to happen was
to get off to a bad start, and it happened," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "We wanted to take
the crowd out of the game. That didn't happen."
The Wildcats, who had spoken all week about
avenging their Feb. 4 loss to Stanford, came out
in a fury. Stanford, meanwhile, came out shooting
bricks. In the opening minute, Cardinal guard Terry
Taylor missed a wide-open three-pointer from the
corner, and 50 seconds later Wildcat Anthony Cook
rejected a patented Todd Lichti driving shot.
And Arizona was off to the races. By the time
Montgomery called a timeout, the Wildcats were
ahead 16-2.
"They had put a blemish on our Pac-10 record
and we were ready to prove we're a better team,"
said Arizona forward Sean Elliott, who scored 32
points.
The Wildcats solidified their season-long claim as
the best team in the Pac-10 by routing Oregon
State in the championship game. Arizona, which
reached the NCAA Final Four Sunday by defeating
North Carolina, finished 19-1 against conference
foes and is 35-2 overall.
Stanford, the No. 4 seed in the tourney, defeated
No. 5 Oregon 88-67 in the first round, behind junior
Lichti's 25 points and forward junior Bryan
McSweeney's 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Car
dinal then moved on to the National Invitational
Tournament.
Against Arizona, Stanford did not surrender after
the Wildcats' first half attack. Stanford came out
of the intermission working the ball inside to junior
Howard Wright and senior Greg Butler. Arizona
big men Tom Tolbert and Cook were astoundingly
in foul trouble on their own home floor, and Wright
and Butler took advantage.
The Cardinal went on an 11-4 run before Olson

Todd Lichti scored a career-high 34 points to lead the Cardinal to a win over Long
Beach State in the NIT Tournament.
called a timeout with the score
59-44. And his Wildcats
responded by scoring six straight
points.
The Cardinal began its second
surge trailing 78-63 when Lichti
launched a nylon-seeking missile
from overseas for three points,
and then after a rare Kerr rock,
Lichti fed Taylor for a fast break
layup. Arizona led by only 10, 78-
68.
Elliott stemmed the Cardinal
tide with two free throws (he was
10-for-10 from the line in the
second half), and Wildcat Craig
McMillan came up with a steal
that led to an Elliott jumper that

missed.
Here's where Stanford could
have used a break, but the ball
bounced into Cook's hands six feet
from the hoop, and he laid it back
in for an 82-68 lead. Just 14
seconds later, Stanford sopho
more reserve forward Deshon
Wingate, of all people, nervously
sank two free throws.
After a McMillan miss,
McSweeney sank two more
freebies and Stanford was within
10 again. Finally, with 4:17
remaining in the game, the Car
dinal got the break. The normally
unflappable Kerr missed the front
end of a one-and-one situation
and Lichti took the rebound coast
to-coast.
But Lichti's flying left-handed
flip from the right side jammed
in between the side of the rim
and the backboard and Arizona

came back quickly with Kerr hit
ting a pull-up jumper.
The Cardinal had one last gasp
after Wright matched Kerr's hoop
and the cold McMillan missed an
other jumper. Taylor drove the
length of the court but his flailing
scoop shot never came close to
the rim.
"If Todd or Terry's layups had
fallen we would have had an eight
point game and who knows what
would have happened," Mont
gomery said afterwards. "In the
second half we obviously played
much better basketball, but the
opportunity for us to win was
somewhat diminished (by the first
half margin)."
Against the Oregon Ducks in
the first round, the Stanford bal
lclub overcame a lackluster first
half performance and outscored
the Ducks 52-31 in the second

half to record the 88-67 victory.
The win was the Cardinal's 20th,
the first time Stanford has had a
20-win season since the NCAA
championship 1942 season.
"I felt we were the non
aggressor in the first half and yet
we were tied, so we couldn't feel
too bad," Montgomery said. "The
second half was a pretty good ex
hibition of basketball on our
part."
"I just stunk up the place in
the first half," Wright, who had
12 points in the second half said.
"At halftime I remembered what
my dad had told me — when it's
going bad don't let it get worse."
Lichti's 48 points in the two
games made him Stanford's all
time leading scorer with 1,616
points, edging Kimberly Belton
who had 1,615.
