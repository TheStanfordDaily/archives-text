## Cardinal falls in second round of NIT Loss to Wildcats stops Pac-10 run 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
TUCSON, Ariz., March 13 — Several
times during the frenzied second-half
war on the floor of McKale Center,
the Stanford Cardinal found itself
trailing Arizona at the Wildcats'
home court by only 10 points. The
Cardinal needed a break, maybe even

a lucky break, to make this game a game.
Somebody somewhere, however, once said that
luck is when opportunity meets preparation. And
in the first half, it was Arizona that had done all
the preparing.
The Wildcats had blitzkrieged Stanford 55-33 in
the first 20 minutes.
That 22-point foundation was more than enough
to hold off several gutty Cardinal comeback runs,
and Arizona won 97-83 in the semifinals of the
Pacific 10 Conference Tournament. Thus, one of
the most entertaining and grueling halves of bas
ketball of the Stanford season was obscured by the
smoke of Arizona's blazing start.
"The one thing we couldn't allow to happen was
to get off to a bad start, and it happened," Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery said. "We wanted to take
the crowd out of the game. That didn't happen."
The Wildcats, who had spoken all week about
avenging their Feb. 4 loss to Stanford, came out
in a fury. Stanford, meanwhile, came out shooting
bricks. In the opening minute, Cardinal guard Terry
Taylor missed a wide-open three-pointer from the
corner, and 50 seconds later Wildcat Anthony Cook
rejected a patented Todd Lichti driving shot.
And Arizona was off to the races. By the time
Montgomery called a timeout, the Wildcats were
ahead 16-2.
"They had put a blemish on our Pac-10 record
and we were ready to prove we're a better team,"
said Arizona forward Sean Elliott, who scored 32
points.
The Wildcats solidified their season-long claim as
the best team in the Pac-10 by routing Oregon
State in the championship game. Arizona, which
reached the NCAA Final Four Sunday by defeating
North Carolina, finished 19-1 against conference
foes and is 35-2 overall.
Stanford, the No. 4 seed in the tourney, defeated
No. 5 Oregon 88-67 in the first round, behind junior
Lichti's 25 points and forward junior Bryan
McSweeney's 12 points and 10 rebounds. The Car
dinal then moved on to the National Invitational
Tournament.
Against Arizona, Stanford did not surrender after
the Wildcats' first half attack. Stanford came out
of the intermission working the ball inside to junior
Howard Wright and senior Greg Butler. Arizona
big men Tom Tolbert and Cook were astoundingly
in foul trouble on their own home floor, and Wright
and Butler took advantage.
The Cardinal went on an 11-4 run before Olson
