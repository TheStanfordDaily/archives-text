# Indians end Card hopes
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
An historic season for Stanford
basketball ended Tuesday night
in suspended animation.
With :00 left on the clock, the
scoreboard read Stanford 59,
Arkansas State 59.
But the game was not over.
The Indians' guard Rhon
Johnson stepped up to the foul
line to shoot two free throws.
With the Stanford crowd scream
ing in desperate hope, Johnson
sank the first and suddenly
Maples Pavilion was a bizarre
silent movie.
After Johnson missed the
meaningless second shot, the In
dians celebrated wildly but quiet
ly, and the beaten Cardinal team
walked off the court in slow mo
tion as 6,419 fans stood stunned.
And so a season that saw Stan
ford win 20 games for the first
time since 1942, a season that
propelled the Cardinal to its first
postseason appearance since
1942, a season that saw Stanford
upset an Arizona team which may
well win the national champion
ship, and a season in which the
name Todd Lichti was etched
upon the Cardinal record books
and the fans' memories â€” this
season ended quietly and agoniz
ingly, as Stanford fans and players
left Maples as if they were walking
under water.
After defeating the Long Beach
State 49ers in a thriller in the
first round of the National Invi
tational Tournament, Stanford
ran into the type of team that
had given it trouble all year long.
The Arkansas State Indians, a
team whose coach had said that
the NIT had sent out to Stanford
to lose, refused to do so. The In
dians played a scrappy offense and
an extended aggressive defense
throughout the night, and then
took advantage of a Cardinal free
throw disaster to pull off the vic
tory.
"Well, Arkansas State was
pretty much what I expected,"
Stanford Coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "They were a tough,
hard-nosed team with not a lot
of quit in them. Unfortunately we
didn't perform as well as we could
have."
Indeed, the Cardinal had the
game firmly within its grasp with
4:09 remaining and senior center

Greg Butler on the free throw
line shooting two. The only grad
uating senior on the team was a
75 percent free throw shooter up
to that point in the season, but
he missed both shots, and the
game began slipping away.
In the final minutes, Cardinal
junior forward Bryan McSweeney
missed the front end of a one
and-one, and Butler missed two
front ends. So Stanford missed
their final five free throws of the
season and ended up losing by
one point after Johnson drove
baseline and was fouled by
Howard Wright with the score
tied and double zeros on the clock.
"We'd take those same free
throws if we had to do it over
again," Lichti said. "After all they
are free throws. Unfortunately we
hit a bad string at a bad time."
In fact it was a game of streaks
in the second half, with Stanford
pulling out to four- or five-point
leads and then Arkansas State
charging back to tie repeatedly.
The Cardinal finally pulled out to
an eight-point lead, 53-46 with
7:40 left and had posession of the
ball, but two consecutive junior
Scott Meinert turnovers led to five
Indian points and it was a ball
game again.
Lichti scored the last of his 23
points on a turnaround jumper
from the top of the key with 5:33
remaining, and from there on out
the Indians kept him quiet.
"We tried a triangle-and-two, a
box-and-one on Lichti and maybe
a few defenses you didn't even
recognize," Arkansas State Coach
Nelson Catalina said. "In the end
our defensive pressure created a
couple of turnovers and they
missed some instrumental free
throws."
Against Long Beach State,
there was no stopping Mister
Lichti. The junior guard juked
and darted his way to a career
high 34 points, and then capped
the performance with a defensive
gem in the waning moments.
Stanford led 78-77 after Lichti
crossed the key and hit a pull-up
jumper with 33 seconds left in
the contest. The 49ers worked the
ball around for the last shot, but
when forward Jeff Eastin tried to
throw an overhand pass to team
mate John Hatten in the post,
Lichti anticipated the move. He
jumped up and tipped the ball
and then came down with it in
the corner.
"They were looking inside all
night, and when he had the ball
over his head with two hands I
knew he wasn't going to shoot
it," Lichti said. "So I jumped up
and went after it."
Lichti passed to Meinert, who
was fouled with nine seconds left.
Meinert sank both free throws to
seal the victory.
Meinert's performance was
somewhat overshadowed by
Lichti's 34 points. Stanford's reg
ular starting point guard Terry
Taylor was sick and spent the en
tire game lying down in the locker
room.
Meinert, however, was not
shaken by the sudden start. In
fact he was eager to go.
"Everyone had to tell me to
calm down," he said. "I was told
eight minutes before the game
that Terry couldn't play. You hate
to lose your starting point guard,
but I'm always happy to start."
Meinert responded with nine
points and six assists, as he
thrived on the unusually up
tempo Cardinal offense.
