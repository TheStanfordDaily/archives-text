# USW protests fiberglass hazard

A dispute over the risk of fi
berglass exposure to workers in
the mailroom of the University's
Press Building led the United
Stanford Workers to demonstrate
Friday before nonplussed facilities
managers at their Old Pavilion
offices.
Holding placards decrying the
"runaround" they claimed to have
received from the University's
Project Management, a dozen
USW members clustered before
managers and reporters in an at
tempt to spotlight the possible
hazard of unsealed fiberglass in
sulation filtering into their
workplace atmosphere.
"We will take whatever actions
necessary to focus attention on
unsafe conditions," said USW

Chief Steward Linda Crouse. One
sign at the protest accused Project
Management of "Putting costs
before health and safety."
Crouse and other union officials
said they were upset about recent
atmospheric testing of the
delivery and mail services area
done by the Fireman's Fund in
surance company, which reported
a fiberglass level of .03 milligrams
per cubic meter in the area. The
union contends that the level
should be as close to zero as pos
sible.
That level is far below the 10
milligram standard per eight-hour
exposure set by the American
Conference of Government Indus
trial Hygienists. Federal stand
ards are even higher, allowing 15
milligrams of exposure. Univer
sity officials point to these stand
ards as evidence that the fiber

glass is not endangering the
health of employees.
Conducted March 17, the test
ing became necessary after fiber
glass insulation was installed in
February by an outside contractor
obtained by Project Management.
The fiberglass was left partially
exposed.
According to a USW flier, the
ceiling insulation "was so poorly
installed that pink fiberglass has
been floating down on employees
in that building for weeks."
Manuel Quesada, the first mail
room employee to complain about
the new installation, said: "One
day a big chunk of fiberglass fell
from the ceiling. Two weeks later,
I found a one inch strand of fi
berglass in my coffee."
Echoing Quesada, Crouse said,
