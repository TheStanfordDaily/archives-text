# USW protests fiberglass hazard
## 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
A dispute over the risk of fi
berglass exposure to workers in
the mailroom of the University's
Press Building led the United
Stanford Workers to demonstrate
Friday before nonplussed facilities
managers at their Old Pavilion
offices.
Holding placards decrying the
"runaround" they claimed to have
received from the University's
Project Management, a dozen
USW members clustered before
managers and reporters in an at
tempt to spotlight the possible
hazard of unsealed fiberglass in
sulation filtering into their
workplace atmosphere.
"We will take whatever actions
necessary to focus attention on
unsafe conditions," said USW

Chief Steward Linda Crouse. One
sign at the protest accused Project
Management of "Putting costs
before health and safety."
Crouse and other union officials
said they were upset about recent
atmospheric testing of the
delivery and mail services area
done by the Fireman's Fund in
surance company, which reported
a fiberglass level of .03 milligrams
per cubic meter in the area. The
union contends that the level
should be as close to zero as pos
sible.
That level is far below the 10
milligram standard per eight-hour
exposure set by the American
Conference of Government Indus
trial Hygienists. Federal stand
ards are even higher, allowing 15
milligrams of exposure. Univer
sity officials point to these stand
ards as evidence that the fiber

glass is not endangering the
health of employees.
Conducted March 17, the test
ing became necessary after fiber
glass insulation was installed in
February by an outside contractor
obtained by Project Management.
The fiberglass was left partially
exposed.
According to a USW flier, the
ceiling insulation "was so poorly
installed that pink fiberglass has
been floating down on employees
in that building for weeks."
Manuel Quesada, the first mail
room employee to complain about
the new installation, said: "One
day a big chunk of fiberglass fell
from the ceiling. Two weeks later,
I found a one inch strand of fi
berglass in my coffee."
Echoing Quesada, Crouse said,

"We do not believe that manage
ment would risk leaving exposed
fiberglass ... in Bill Massy's of
fice, for example. However, it is
clear that they are willing to take
that risk with mail workers."
Massy, vice president of busi
ness and finance, is the adminis
trator ultimately responsible for
facilities and health and safety.
The dangers of fiberglass are
not firmly established. According
to a June 1987 report by the Cal
ifornia Department of Health
Services, atmospheric fiberglass is
a known carcinogen, especially
when present in very fine fibers.
But the risk of fiberglass is rela
tively small when compared to the
risk posed by the controversial
material asbestos.
"When breathed into the respi
ratory tract, [fine strands of
fiberglass] have the potential to
cause cancer, although not on
anything like the scale of as
bestos," the report states. The
report recommends that fiber
levels in the air be kept "close to
zero."
USW Field Representative Nick
Jones concurred with the report,
saying, "We're concerned about
the possibility of lung cancer."
Jones said six union members
have also complained about skin,
nose and throat problems.
In fact, five employees, with
management approval, have cho
sen not to work in the office build
ing because of the fiberglass risks.
As of last week, they have been

working in the loading dock of
the press building, waiting for the
mail to be sorted and then
brought out to them.
Three weeks after the installa
tion, the USW filed formal acci
dent reports and brought the mat
ter to the attention of the be
leaguered Health and Safety De
partment, which has recently
been plagued by criticism about
health and safety abuses campus
wide.
David Chavez, a Health and
Safety specialist, agreed with the
union and recommended that the
insulation be sealed with tape and
that a drop ceiling be put in to
cut down the fiberglass in the air.
But the recommendations were
not carried out, and Jones cried
foul, claiming, "Project Manage
ment told [Chavez] to expunge
the recommendations." Chavez
would not say whether he was
strong-armed into withdrawing
his opinions.
However, Ralph Buchanan, act
ing deputy associate vice presi
dent of Administrative Services
and Facilities, disputed the USW's
claim that Chavez was pressured
into dropping his recommenda
tion. Buchanan said Chavez sim
ply agreed to hold off on spending
the estimated $40,000 for the
drop ceiling until more tests could
be done.
In addition, union officials say
the findings of the test were
skewed because of faulty sampling
procedures. According to Jones,
office airblowers were not on dur
ing the test, which would distort
the readings and possibly under
state the fiberglass level. He also
said that some fibers may remain

in the lungs, and there is no way
to measure the extent of this dan
ger.
Gene Kershner, social director
of Project Management, argued
though that the original test was
valid. "The airblowers were on,"
he said. "This type of insulation
is not perceived as a problem."
Chris Lundin, the manager of
Mail and Delivery Services, was
bewildered by the union's com
plaints. He said management put
in the new installation in
February "to make the employee's
work conditions safer."
But after the workers began to
file accident reports, Lundin said
management was responsive to
their concerns, allowing employ
ees to go to the doctor of their
choice. All went to the same doc
tor, who found "no present
symptoms related to fiberglass
(exposure)," according to Lundin.
But after hearing of the
symptoms, the doctor diagnosed
"possible fiberglass exposure."

a known carcinogen, especially
when present in very fine fibers.
But the risk of fiberglass is rela
tively small when compared to the
risk posed by the controversial
material asbestos.
"When breathed into the respi
ratory tract, [fine strands of
fiberglass] have the potential to
cause cancer, although not on
anything like the scale of as
bestos," the report states. The
report recommends that fiber
levels in the air be kept "close to
zero."
USW Field Representative Nick
Jones concurred with the report,
saying, "We're concerned about
the possibility of lung cancer."
Jones said six union members
have also complained about skin,
nose and throat problems.
In fact, five employees, with
management approval, have cho
sen not to work in the office build
ing because of the fiberglass risks.
As of last week, they have been

working in the loading dock of
the press building, waiting for the
mail to be sorted and then
brought out to them.
Three weeks after the installa
tion, the USW filed formal acci
dent reports and brought the mat
ter to the attention of the be
leaguered Health and Safety De
partment, which has recently
been plagued by criticism about
health and safety abuses campus
wide.
David Chavez, a Health and
Safety specialist, agreed with the
union and recommended that the
insulation be sealed with tape and
that a drop ceiling be put in to
cut down the fiberglass in the air.
But the recommendations were
not carried out, and Jones cried
foul, claiming, "Project Manage
ment told [Chavez] to expunge
the recommendations." Chavez
would not say whether he was
strong-armed into withdrawing
his opinions.
However, Ralph Buchanan, act
ing deputy associate vice presi
dent of Administrative Services
and Facilities, disputed the USW's
claim that Chavez was pressured
into dropping his recommenda
tion. Buchanan said Chavez sim
ply agreed to hold off on spending
the estimated $40,000 for the
drop ceiling until more tests could
be done.
In addition, union officials say
the findings of the test were
skewed because of faulty sampling
procedures. According to Jones,
office airblowers were not on dur
ing the test, which would distort
the readings and possibly under
state the fiberglass level. He also
said that some fibers may remain

in the lungs, and there is no way
to measure the extent of this dan
ger.
Gene Kershner, social director
of Project Management, argued
though that the original test was
valid. "The airblowers were on,"
he said. "This type of insulation
is not perceived as a problem."
Chris Lundin, the manager of
Mail and Delivery Services, was
bewildered by the union's com
plaints. He said management put
in the new installation in
February "to make the employee's
work conditions safer."
But after the workers began to
file accident reports, Lundin said
management was responsive to
their concerns, allowing employ
ees to go to the doctor of their
choice. All went to the same doc
tor, who found "no present
symptoms related to fiberglass
(exposure)," according to Lundin.
But after hearing of the
symptoms, the doctor diagnosed
"possible fiberglass exposure."
A dispute over the risk of fi
berglass exposure to workers in
the mailroom of the University's
Press Building led the United
Stanford Workers to demonstrate
Friday before nonplussed facilities
managers at their Old Pavilion
offices.
Holding placards decrying the
"runaround" they claimed to have
received from the University's
Project Management, a dozen
USW members clustered before
managers and reporters in an at
tempt to spotlight the possible
hazard of unsealed fiberglass in
sulation filtering into their
workplace atmosphere.
"We will take whatever actions
necessary to focus attention on
unsafe conditions," said USW

Chief Steward Linda Crouse. One
sign at the protest accused Project
Management of "Putting costs
before health and safety."
Crouse and other union officials
said they were upset about recent
atmospheric testing of the
delivery and mail services area
done by the Fireman's Fund in
surance company, which reported
a fiberglass level of .03 milligrams
per cubic meter in the area. The
union contends that the level
should be as close to zero as pos
sible.
That level is far below the 10
milligram standard per eight-hour
exposure set by the American
Conference of Government Indus
trial Hygienists. Federal stand
ards are even higher, allowing 15
milligrams of exposure. Univer
sity officials point to these stand
ards as evidence that the fiber

glass is not endangering the
health of employees.
Conducted March 17, the test
ing became necessary after fiber
glass insulation was installed in
February by an outside contractor
obtained by Project Management.
The fiberglass was left partially
exposed.
According to a USW flier, the
ceiling insulation "was so poorly
installed that pink fiberglass has
been floating down on employees
in that building for weeks."
Manuel Quesada, the first mail
room employee to complain about
the new installation, said: "One
day a big chunk of fiberglass fell
from the ceiling. Two weeks later,
I found a one inch strand of fi
berglass in my coffee."
Echoing Quesada, Crouse said,

"We do not believe that manage
ment would risk leaving exposed
fiberglass ... in Bill Massy's of
fice, for example. However, it is
clear that they are willing to take
that risk with mail workers."
Massy, vice president of busi
ness and finance, is the adminis
trator ultimately responsible for
facilities and health and safety.
The dangers of fiberglass are
not firmly established. According

Services, atmospheric fiberglass is
