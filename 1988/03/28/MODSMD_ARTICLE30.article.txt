# Women bow to Texas in Midwest Regional
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
AUSTIN, Tex. -
As the Stanford
women's basket
ball team repeat
edly discovered
over the past three
weeks, she who

controls the boards controls the
game.
In each of the Cardinal's last
four games — a 77-67 win over
USC March 11, a 75-74 heart
breaker loss to UCLA the next
night, a 74-72 overtime victory at
Montana in the second round of
the NCAA Tournament and a 79-
58 defeat at the hands of Texas
in the semifinal round of the Mid
west Regional — the team that
grabbed the most rebounds also
netted itself the victory.
Stanford finishes the season
with a 27-5 record and the 13th
place ranking on the final Asso
ciated Press poll. The Cardinal
has also earned third place in the
extremely competitive Pacific 10
Conference with a 14-4 league
mark, behind No. 11 Washington
and No. 16 USC.
The Cardinal's road to the
Regional began March 11 in a suc
cessful rematch with *he Trojans.
In the previous week, Stanford
dropped a twin bill in Los Angeles
to UCLA and USC — the latter
highlighted by Pac-10 Player of
the Year Cherie Nelson's career
high 41 points — to drop out of
the top spot of the Pac-10, making
the home games against the
Bruins and Trojans classic grudge
matches.
The Stanford squad seemed
back on track when it handily
defeated the Trojans. More spe
cifically, the Cardinal simply shut
down and wore out Nelson, who
could only muster four points in
her 30 minutes of play, thanks to
the efforts of Stanford freshman
forward Trisha Stevens.
"Cherie Nelson forgot the '1*
on the 41," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Our goal was
not to let her get 10. I thought
Trisha did an excellent job, I
thought Jennifer (Azzi) and Katy
(Steding) helped really well, and

I felt we stayed with things."
"Well, I didn't do it by myself,"
Stevens said. "I think we really
concentrated on everybody help
ing. We had a lot of help-side, and
that's the only way we really could
have done it."
Especially helpful was sopho
more guard Azzi. The Cardinal's
leading scorer boosted her total
with a career-high 21 point per
formance, shooting .571 from the
field, .500 from three-point range
and 100 percent at the line.
"I think it really helps playing
at home," Azzi said. "I don't want
to say it's the biggest thing, but
I think we were much more
motivated and ready to play this
time.
"A lot of times when I go into
a game, my mind is completely
blank and I just worry about
playing the game. That's when I
play my best, and that's what I
did tonight."
Junior center Jill Yanke also
had an excellent night, finishing
with an 18-point and 13-rebound
double-double.
Stevens and Azzi played an
other outstanding game the next
night, but unfortunately it was
not quite enough to stem the tide
of Dora Dome and the UCLA
Bruins. Dome amassed an impres
sive 28 points en route to the
last-second win over the Cardinal.
Stanford and UCLA engaged in
a dogfight from the tip-off, ex
changing buckets in an almost
regular fashion. The Cardinal
finished the first half with a slim
37-36 advantage.
The Bruins pulled out to a 50-
44 lead by 14:10 in the second
half, but buckets by Stevens and
Azzi brought the Cardinal back
out on top with 9:39 left. By the
55-second mark, Stanford enjoyed
a 74-70 lead.
From there, the win slipped out
of the hands of the Cardinal
cagers. At :25, Dome fouled
Yanke, but after a Stanford
timeout the junior missed the
front end of the one-and-one.
Dome pulled down the rebound
and at : 17 launched a three
pointer that brought the Bruins
within one.
After a UCLA timeout, Bruin

Rachelle Roulier promptly fouled
freshman Sonja Henning, bring
ing the Cardinal guard to the line
for a one-and-one.
Unfortunately, the ball bounced
off the rim and ended up in the
hands of Dome. As she raced down
the court with the final seconds
of the game winding down, every
one in Maples Pavilion expected
Dome, the Bruins most consistent
shooter, to try the winning shot
herself.
Dome had another plan on her
mind. Evading Stanford's double
coverage, the forward passed the
ball off to Jaime Brown, previ
ously 0-for-5 on the evening.
Brown made it when it counted,
however, and her 18-foot baseline
jumper at the buzzer gave the
Bruins a Stanford sweep.
"I thought people played hard,
but we needed a couple of
freethrows at the end to seal it
and we didn't get them," VanDer
veer said. "They made a lucky
shot and it went in.
"We didn't shoot a whole lot of
free throws the whole night, and
we're usually a good free throw
shooting team. It was also critical
that Katy and Jennifer fouled out
(both were disqualified in the last
four minutes). I'm rather disap
pointed, but I think that people
played hard."
The loss placed Stanford third
in the final Pac-10 standings and
eliminated the Cardinal's chances
for a home game in the NCAA
Tournament. The No. 13 ranking,
however, was high enough to earn
the cagers the No. 5 seed in the
Midwest Region, the toughest in
the NCAA, pitting the Cardinal
against fourth seed Montana in
Missoula.
The March 20 game proved to
be the only upset of the tourna
ment going into the regional
round, as Stanford held on to
defeat the Lady Griz 74-72 in an
overtime game as suspenseful as
the UCLA contest the week
before.
"I was really pleased with
people's effort, the way they stuck
with things and didn't get shook
up," the Cardinal coach com
mented. "I think Montana is a
very well-coached team, they ex

ecuted off their offense extremely
well. It's a situation that I hope
their team looks positively at the
game."
Once again, Stevens made the
difference. The freshman forward
proved to be a force inside by
scoring 20 points and grabbing 9
rebounds, complemented by the
guard duo of Azzi and Henning
who scored 17 and 16 points,
respectively.
This scoring kept Stanford even
with the offensive powerhouse of
the Lady Griz, led by forward
Marti Leibenguth's inspired 27
point showing. However, in direct
contrast to the loss to the Bruins,
freethrows gave Stanford the
edge, as the Cardinal shot 24-for
-29 from the line while Montana
connected on a meager 13 out of
25 attempts including a 0-for-4
stint in the overtime period.
Free throws and rebounds were
just not enough in Austin. The
semifinal round pitted Stanford
against the top seed in the Mid
west Regional, the fourth-ranked
host team Texas, a team noted
for its extremely tough full-court
press.
The Lady Longhorns didn't dis
appoint, but the Cardinal cagers
made them earn the win. Stanford
held tight in the first half and
stayed within 10 points of the
Texas, giving the Longhorns one
of their toughest first halves of
the season. At halftime, the home
team led 39-29.
But in the end, forward
Doreatha Conwell proved too
tough for Stanford inside. The
senior transfer, making her first
postseason apperance at Texas,
ammassed a game-high 26 points
along with an incredible 16
rebounds.
"I thought she was really the
key to how they did inside," Van-
Derveer said. "We just had a real
tough time putting pressure on
her out there."
The only Cardinal player to
come close was Henning, who
took control and drove inside to
garner most of her team-high 15
points and seven caroms. Stevens
finished the game with 12 points,
as did freshman center Tammy
Svoboda.

"I thought the two young ladies
next to me (Henning and
Svoboda) had an excellent effort,"
VanDerveer said. "I thought
Tammy did a good job scoring
inside for us, and Sor\ja did a good
job of running our offense with
a lot of pressure on her.
"The pressure defense was very
effective for them, and hurt ob
viously our offensive execution.
We just turned the ball over too

much."
Nonetheless, the Regional ap
pearance was a milestone in the
developing Stanford women's bas
ketball program. The victory at
Montana was the team's first
postseason win ever, while the
matchup with Texas showed that
the Stanford players could play
with any team in the country and
got their feet wet for a tourna
ment bid next year.

time.
"A lot of times when I go into
a game, my mind is completely
blank and I just worry about
playing the game. That's when I
play my best, and that's what I
did tonight."
Junior center Jill Yanke also
had an excellent night, finishing
with an 18-point and 13-rebound
double-double.
Stevens and Azzi played an
other outstanding game the next
night, but unfortunately it was
not quite enough to stem the tide
of Dora Dome and the UCLA
Bruins. Dome amassed an impres
sive 28 points en route to the
last-second win over the Cardinal.
Stanford and UCLA engaged in
a dogfight from the tip-off, ex
changing buckets in an almost
regular fashion. The Cardinal
finished the first half with a slim
37-36 advantage.
The Bruins pulled out to a 50-
44 lead by 14:10 in the second
half, but buckets by Stevens and
Azzi brought the Cardinal back
out on top with 9:39 left. By the
55-second mark, Stanford enjoyed
a 74-70 lead.
From there, the win slipped out
of the hands of the Cardinal
cagers. At :25, Dome fouled
Yanke, but after a Stanford
timeout the junior missed the
front end of the one-and-one.
Dome pulled down the rebound
and at : 17 launched a three
pointer that brought the Bruins
within one.
After a UCLA timeout, Bruin

Rachelle Roulier promptly fouled
freshman Sonja Henning, bring
ing the Cardinal guard to the line
for a one-and-one.
Unfortunately, the ball bounced
off the rim and ended up in the
hands of Dome. As she raced down
the court with the final seconds
of the game winding down, every
one in Maples Pavilion expected
Dome, the Bruins most consistent
shooter, to try the winning shot
herself.
Dome had another plan on her
mind. Evading Stanford's double
coverage, the forward passed the
ball off to Jaime Brown, previ
ously 0-for-5 on the evening.
Brown made it when it counted,
however, and her 18-foot baseline
jumper at the buzzer gave the
Bruins a Stanford sweep.
"I thought people played hard,
but we needed a couple of
freethrows at the end to seal it
and we didn't get them," VanDer
veer said. "They made a lucky
shot and it went in.
"We didn't shoot a whole lot of
free throws the whole night, and
we're usually a good free throw
shooting team. It was also critical
that Katy and Jennifer fouled out
(both were disqualified in the last
four minutes). I'm rather disap
pointed, but I think that people
played hard."
The loss placed Stanford third
in the final Pac-10 standings and
eliminated the Cardinal's chances
for a home game in the NCAA
Tournament. The No. 13 ranking,
however, was high enough to earn
the cagers the No. 5 seed in the
Midwest Region, the toughest in
the NCAA, pitting the Cardinal
against fourth seed Montana in
Missoula.
The March 20 game proved to
be the only upset of the tourna
ment going into the regional
round, as Stanford held on to
defeat the Lady Griz 74-72 in an
overtime game as suspenseful as
the UCLA contest the week
before.
"I was really pleased with
people's effort, the way they stuck
with things and didn't get shook
up," the Cardinal coach com
mented. "I think Montana is a
very well-coached team, they ex

ecuted off their offense extremely
well. It's a situation that I hope
their team looks positively at the
game."
Once again, Stevens made the
difference. The freshman forward
proved to be a force inside by
scoring 20 points and grabbing 9
rebounds, complemented by the
guard duo of Azzi and Henning
who scored 17 and 16 points,
respectively.
This scoring kept Stanford even
with the offensive powerhouse of
the Lady Griz, led by forward
Marti Leibenguth's inspired 27
point showing. However, in direct
contrast to the loss to the Bruins,
freethrows gave Stanford the
edge, as the Cardinal shot 24-for
-29 from the line while Montana
connected on a meager 13 out of
25 attempts including a 0-for-4
stint in the overtime period.
Free throws and rebounds were
just not enough in Austin. The
semifinal round pitted Stanford
against the top seed in the Mid
west Regional, the fourth-ranked
host team Texas, a team noted
for its extremely tough full-court
press.
The Lady Longhorns didn't dis
appoint, but the Cardinal cagers
made them earn the win. Stanford
held tight in the first half and
stayed within 10 points of the
Texas, giving the Longhorns one
of their toughest first halves of
the season. At halftime, the home
team led 39-29.
But in the end, forward
Doreatha Conwell proved too
tough for Stanford inside. The
senior transfer, making her first
postseason apperance at Texas,
ammassed a game-high 26 points
along with an incredible 16
rebounds.
"I thought she was really the
key to how they did inside," Van-
Derveer said. "We just had a real
tough time putting pressure on
her out there."
The only Cardinal player to
come close was Henning, who
took control and drove inside to
garner most of her team-high 15
points and seven caroms. Stevens
finished the game with 12 points,
as did freshman center Tammy
Svoboda.

"I thought the two young ladies
next to me (Henning and
Svoboda) had an excellent effort,"
VanDerveer said. "I thought
Tammy did a good job scoring
inside for us, and Sor\ja did a good
job of running our offense with
a lot of pressure on her.
"The pressure defense was very
effective for them, and hurt ob
viously our offensive execution.
We just turned the ball over too

much."
Nonetheless, the Regional ap
pearance was a milestone in the
developing Stanford women's bas
ketball program. The victory at
Montana was the team's first
postseason win ever, while the
matchup with Texas showed that
the Stanford players could play
with any team in the country and
got their feet wet for a tourna
ment bid next year.

AUSTIN, Tex. -
As the Stanford
women's basket
ball team repeat
edly discovered
over the past three
weeks, she who

controls the boards controls the
game.
In each of the Cardinal's last
four games — a 77-67 win over
USC March 11, a 75-74 heart
breaker loss to UCLA the next
night, a 74-72 overtime victory at
Montana in the second round of
the NCAA Tournament and a 79-
58 defeat at the hands of Texas
in the semifinal round of the Mid
west Regional — the team that
grabbed the most rebounds also
netted itself the victory.
Stanford finishes the season
with a 27-5 record and the 13th
place ranking on the final Asso
ciated Press poll. The Cardinal
has also earned third place in the
extremely competitive Pacific 10
Conference with a 14-4 league
mark, behind No. 11 Washington
and No. 16 USC.
The Cardinal's road to the
Regional began March 11 in a suc
cessful rematch with *he Trojans.
In the previous week, Stanford
dropped a twin bill in Los Angeles
to UCLA and USC — the latter
highlighted by Pac-10 Player of
the Year Cherie Nelson's career
high 41 points — to drop out of
the top spot of the Pac-10, making
the home games against the
Bruins and Trojans classic grudge
matches.
The Stanford squad seemed
back on track when it handily
defeated the Trojans. More spe
cifically, the Cardinal simply shut
down and wore out Nelson, who
could only muster four points in
her 30 minutes of play, thanks to
the efforts of Stanford freshman
forward Trisha Stevens.
"Cherie Nelson forgot the '1*
on the 41," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Our goal was
not to let her get 10. I thought
Trisha did an excellent job, I
thought Jennifer (Azzi) and Katy
(Steding) helped really well, and

I felt we stayed with things."
"Well, I didn't do it by myself,"
Stevens said. "I think we really
concentrated on everybody help
ing. We had a lot of help-side, and
that's the only way we really could
have done it."
Especially helpful was sopho
more guard Azzi. The Cardinal's
leading scorer boosted her total
with a career-high 21 point per
formance, shooting .571 from the
field, .500 from three-point range
and 100 percent at the line.
"I think it really helps playing
at home," Azzi said. "I don't want
to say it's the biggest thing, but
I think we were much more
motivated and ready to play this
time.
"A lot of times when I go into
a game, my mind is completely
blank and I just worry about
playing the game. That's when I

in the final Pac-10 standings and
eliminated the Cardinal's chances
for a home game in the NCAA
Tournament. The No. 13 ranking,
however, was high enough to earn
the cagers the No. 5 seed in the
Midwest Region, the toughest in
the NCAA, pitting the Cardinal
against fourth seed Montana in
Missoula.
The March 20 game proved to
be the only upset of the tourna
ment going into the regional
round, as Stanford held on to
defeat the Lady Griz 74-72 in an
overtime game as suspenseful as
the UCLA contest the week
before.
"I was really pleased with
people's effort, the way they stuck
with things and didn't get shook
up," the Cardinal coach com
mented. "I think Montana is a
very well-coached team, they ex

ecuted off their offense extremely
well. It's a situation that I hope
their team looks positively at the
game."
Once again, Stevens made the
difference. The freshman forward
proved to be a force inside by
scoring 20 points and grabbing 9
rebounds, complemented by the
guard duo of Azzi and Henning
who scored 17 and 16 points,
respectively.
This scoring kept Stanford even
with the offensive powerhouse of
the Lady Griz, led by forward
Marti Leibenguth's inspired 27
point showing. However, in direct
contrast to the loss to the Bruins,
freethrows gave Stanford the
edge, as the Cardinal shot 24-for
-29 from the line while Montana
connected on a meager 13 out of
25 attempts including a 0-for-4
stint in the overtime period.
Free throws and rebounds were
just not enough in Austin. The
semifinal round pitted Stanford
against the top seed in the Mid
west Regional, the fourth-ranked
host team Texas, a team noted
for its extremely tough full-court
press.
The Lady Longhorns didn't dis
appoint, but the Cardinal cagers
made them earn the win. Stanford
held tight in the first half and
stayed within 10 points of the
Texas, giving the Longhorns one
of their toughest first halves of
the season. At halftime, the home
team led 39-29.
But in the end, forward
Doreatha Conwell proved too
tough for Stanford inside. The
senior transfer, making her first
postseason apperance at Texas,
ammassed a game-high 26 points
along with an incredible 16
rebounds.
"I thought she was really the
key to how they did inside," Van-
Derveer said. "We just had a real
tough time putting pressure on
her out there."
The only Cardinal player to
come close was Henning, who
took control and drove inside to
garner most of her team-high 15
points and seven caroms. Stevens
finished the game with 12 points,
as did freshman center Tammy
Svoboda.

"I thought the two young ladies
next to me (Henning and
Svoboda) had an excellent effort,"
VanDerveer said. "I thought
Tammy did a good job scoring
inside for us, and Sor\ja did a good
job of running our offense with
a lot of pressure on her.
"The pressure defense was very
effective for them, and hurt ob
viously our offensive execution.
We just turned the ball over too

much."
Nonetheless, the Regional ap
pearance was a milestone in the
developing Stanford women's bas
ketball program. The victory at
Montana was the team's first
postseason win ever, while the
matchup with Texas showed that
the Stanford players could play
with any team in the country and
got their feet wet for a tourna
ment bid next year.

AUSTIN, Tex. -
As the Stanford
women's basket
ball team repeat
edly discovered
over the past three
weeks, she who

controls the boards controls the
game.
In each of the Cardinal's last
four games — a 77-67 win over
USC March 11, a 75-74 heart
breaker loss to UCLA the next
night, a 74-72 overtime victory at
Montana in the second round of
the NCAA Tournament and a 79-
58 defeat at the hands of Texas
in the semifinal round of the Mid
west Regional — the team that
grabbed the most rebounds also
netted itself the victory.
Stanford finishes the season
with a 27-5 record and the 13th
place ranking on the final Asso
ciated Press poll. The Cardinal
has also earned third place in the
extremely competitive Pacific 10
Conference with a 14-4 league
mark, behind No. 11 Washington
and No. 16 USC.
The Cardinal's road to the
Regional began March 11 in a suc
cessful rematch with *he Trojans.
In the previous week, Stanford
dropped a twin bill in Los Angeles
to UCLA and USC — the latter
highlighted by Pac-10 Player of
the Year Cherie Nelson's career
high 41 points — to drop out of
the top spot of the Pac-10, making
the home games against the
Bruins and Trojans classic grudge
matches.
The Stanford squad seemed
back on track when it handily
defeated the Trojans. More spe
cifically, the Cardinal simply shut
down and wore out Nelson, who
could only muster four points in
her 30 minutes of play, thanks to
the efforts of Stanford freshman
forward Trisha Stevens.
"Cherie Nelson forgot the '1*
on the 41," Stanford Coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "Our goal was
not to let her get 10. I thought
Trisha did an excellent job, I
thought Jennifer (Azzi) and Katy
(Steding) helped really well, and

I felt we stayed with things."
"Well, I didn't do it by myself,"
Stevens said. "I think we really
concentrated on everybody help
ing. We had a lot of help-side, and
that's the only way we really could
have done it."
Especially helpful was sopho
more guard Azzi. The Cardinal's
leading scorer boosted her total
with a career-high 21 point per
formance, shooting .571 from the
field, .500 from three-point range
and 100 percent at the line.
"I think it really helps playing
at home," Azzi said. "I don't want
to say it's the biggest thing, but
I think we were much more
motivated and ready to play this
time.
"A lot of times when I go into
a game, my mind is completely
blank and I just worry about
playing the game. That's when I
play my best, and that's what I
did tonight."
Junior center Jill Yanke also
had an excellent night, finishing
with an 18-point and 13-rebound
double-double.
Stevens and Azzi played an
other outstanding game the next
night, but unfortunately it was
not quite enough to stem the tide
of Dora Dome and the UCLA
Bruins. Dome amassed an impres
sive 28 points en route to the
last-second win over the Cardinal.
Stanford and UCLA engaged in
a dogfight from the tip-off, ex
changing buckets in an almost
regular fashion. The Cardinal
finished the first half with a slim
37-36 advantage.
The Bruins pulled out to a 50-
44 lead by 14:10 in the second
half, but buckets by Stevens and
Azzi brought the Cardinal back
out on top with 9:39 left. By the
55-second mark, Stanford enjoyed
a 74-70 lead.
From there, the win slipped out
of the hands of the Cardinal
cagers. At :25, Dome fouled
Yanke, but after a Stanford
timeout the junior missed the
front end of the one-and-one.
Dome pulled down the rebound
and at : 17 launched a three
pointer that brought the Bruins
within one.
After a UCLA timeout, Bruin

Rachelle Roulier promptly fouled
freshman Sonja Henning, bring
ing the Cardinal guard to the line
for a one-and-one.
Unfortunately, the ball bounced
off the rim and ended up in the
hands of Dome. As she raced down
the court with the final seconds
of the game winding down, every
one in Maples Pavilion expected
Dome, the Bruins most consistent
shooter, to try the winning shot
herself.
Dome had another plan on her
mind. Evading Stanford's double
coverage, the forward passed the
ball off to Jaime Brown, previ
ously 0-for-5 on the evening.
Brown made it when it counted,
however, and her 18-foot baseline
jumper at the buzzer gave the
Bruins a Stanford sweep.
"I thought people played hard,
but we needed a couple of
freethrows at the end to seal it
and we didn't get them," VanDer
veer said. "They made a lucky
shot and it went in.
"We didn't shoot a whole lot of
free throws the whole night, and
we're usually a good free throw
shooting team. It was also critical
that Katy and Jennifer fouled out
(both were disqualified in the last
four minutes). I'm rather disap
pointed, but I think that people
played hard."
The loss placed Stanford third
in the final Pac-10 standings and
eliminated the Cardinal's chances
for a home game in the NCAA
Tournament. The No. 13 ranking,
however, was high enough to earn
the cagers the No. 5 seed in the
Midwest Region, the toughest in
the NCAA, pitting the Cardinal
against fourth seed Montana in
Missoula.
