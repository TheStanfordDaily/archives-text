# Women capture third
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
AUSTIN, Tex. -
So much for
Southern hospital
ity.
The Stanford
women's swim
ming team came

into the NCAA Championships at
the Texas Swimming Center ex
pecting to duel with Texas for the
title, but an outstanding Florida
performance relegated the Cardi
nal to third. The Longhorns won
their fifth consecutive national
title with 661 points, the upstart
Gators took second with 542.5
and the Cardinal posted 419
points for third.
California edged Clemson and
Arizona State to finish a distant
fourth — the Bears' fourth con
secutive fourth-place finish — and
Virginia, Michigan, UCLA and
South Carolina rounded out the
top ten.
"We didn't swim very well —
what else can I say," Stanford
Coach George Haines said. "I
thought we'd be a lot better. We
had a bad three days, except for
Susan Rapp and a few others."
"It's disappointing," junior
Monica Nielebeck said. "It wasn't
there. That little extra spark
wasn't there. Florida and Texas
were hungry; they had that
spark."
Perhaps the biggest story of the
meet was that the Cardinal did
not win a single individual event
or relay. After winning three in
dividual events and two relays last
year, the closest the Cardinal was
able to come was second.
Rapp, a fifth-year senior,
finished her outstanding career
on the Farm by posting seconds
in the 200-yard breaststroke and
the 200 individual medley and a
third in the 100 breast, while
junior teammate Jenna Johnson

finished as runner-up in both the
100 freestyle and the 100 butter
fly. Johnson was also fifth in the
50 free.
Florida was led by juniors Dara
Torres, Julia Gorman and Tami
Bruce, all triple winners. The
Gators also won four of five
relays, but Texas' overall depth
clinched the win.
"I think overall we were disap
pointed," senior Jen Pokluda said.
"We had good races here and
there but not everyone swam well
all the time. We were also sur
prised with how well (Texas and
Florida) swam."
"It seemed we didn't really have
it together in the morning when
it really counted (in the qualifying
heats)," Pokluda added. "Because
we didn't swim well in the morn
ing we weren't able to score well
(in the evening finals)." Only the
top 16 swimmers in the morning
heats qualify to swim for points
in the finals.
Stanford scored well in the
backstroke events as junior Mi
chelle Donahue placed fourth in
the 200 and 10th in the 100. Pok
luda took ninth in the 100 and
10th in the 200, and sophomore
Susannah Miller and junior Jenny
Shannon scored in the 200.
Sophomore Jill Johnson took
sixth in the 200 breaststroke and
11th in the 100 while junior
Susan Lenth took 10th in the 100
and sophomore Bethanne Lam
bert placed 11th in the 200.
Other Stanford finalists in
cluded freshman Barb Metz, who
finished sixth in the 500 free, and
Nielebeck, who placed sixth in the
200 IM. In the diving competition
sophomore Katie Connors came
home eighth in both the three
meter and platform competitions,
while senior Leslie Kleinheksel
made good in her first NCAA ap
perance, finishing 12th on the
one-meter board.
Haines couldn't put his finger

on the problem after the second
day. "We're not swimming very
well," he said last Friday. "I think
we're strong but we don't have
enough speed.... Something's
wrong if you don't have speed."
The Cardinal'B lack of speed
was most evident in the relays,
where Stanford often gained leads
early only to see them disappear
when Torres entered the water
for Florida's final legs. Torres,
who was named the NCAA Swim
mer of the Year, and Texas' Carrie
Steinseifer always seemed to be
able to make up almost any deficit
with dreadfully fast anchor legs.
While Stanford, Florida and Texas
filled the top three spots in all
five relays, the Cardinal came
away with only one second and
four thirds.
"Texas and Florida both swam
really well and deserved to be
where they were," Nielebeck said.
Florida Coach Randy Reese was
mostly pleased with his team's
performance, especially Torres'
leg of the 400 free relay. "You
gotta like it,"he said. "It was a
great job. I think she's gotten
stronger and become a great com
petitor all the way through....
It was probably the best meet for
losing I've ever had."
Reese also gave the Texas swim
mers a lot of credit. "When they
jumped out so much the first day
.. . you can't be overly concerned
with the score because you can't
do much about it."
Texas Coach Richard Quick also
felt his team put out a great effort
to win national title number five.
"I really think it was a real team
effort all the way through our
lineup," he said. "I'm real pround
of them and happy for them."
Texas senior Betsy Mitchell, the
winner in both the 100 and 200
back, had her own impressions on
the meet's second day. "It's been
kind of an interesting develop

ment — Stanford has not been
the force we reckoned on. Florida
is having an absolutely fantastic
meet," she said. "(Also) we came
out this morning just incredible.
We're really excited —
everybody's swimmeing well."
Other winners included Texas
senior Tracey McFarlane in the
100 breast, California freshman
Hiroko Nagasaki in the 200 breast
and Michigan's Mary Fischbach,
who swept the one- and three
meter diving titles. Ohio State's
Debbie Fuller won the platform

diving competition, which was
only an exhibition event this year
but will be a regular event begin
ning next year.
McFarlane showed she will be
a force in the Olympic Games this
summer by easily winning the 100
breast, breaking her U.S. Open
record in the process. The only
questions left about her are how
soon she'll recover from the
muscle pull that caused her to
miss the 200 breast, and who she
will be swimming for in Seoul.
She has lived and trained in Palm

Springs for nine years but the
Canadian citizen did not apply for
American citizenship until 1984.
The process, which normally
takes five years, may be sped up,
depending on a bill before the U.S.
Congress.
The meet did not dampen the
Olympic aspirations of anyone on
the Stanford team either, accord
ing to Nielebeck. "The results of
last weekend weren't indicative of
our being an inferior team coming
into Olympic Trials," she said.
"We're still confident."
