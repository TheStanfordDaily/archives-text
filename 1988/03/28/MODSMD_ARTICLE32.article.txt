# Baseball sweeps 'Cats, is swept by Sun Devils
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
TEMPE, Ariz. â€” It was
an all-too-familiar
scenario. For the third
straight game, the Stan
ford baseball team jumped
out to an early lead yes
terday against Arizona

State, only to have the lead melt away
under a blistering offensive onslaught by
the Sun Devils.
Arizona State came back from a four
run deficit to win 10-7 and wrap up a
three-game sweep of the Cardinal.
The Sun Devils also beat Stanford 9-1
Friday and 11-10 Saturday.
Stanford, which opened spring vacation
in promising fashion with a sweep of
Arizona at Sunken Diamond, watched its
Pacific 10 Southern Division lead whither
and die in the Arizona sun. Now 7-4 in
league play and 19-10 overall, the Car
dinal trails California in practicing (9-3

in league) by a game and a half going
into a series with the Golden Bears that
opens Thursday.
Yesterday's loss was the fourth in a
row for Stanford, which also suffered a
13-3 defeat at Fresno State Tuesday. It
is the first time the Cardinal has lost
four straight since April 1982, when the
team lost three straight at Arizona State
and won at Arizona.
In the last four games, the usually
stingy Cardinal pitching staff has sur
rendered 43 runs. The Arizona State of
fense exploded for 30 runs on 39 hits
over the weekend.
"They played extremely well," Stanford
junior third baseman Ed Sprague said.
"They hit the ball all qver the yard. . . .
They must have had six or seven
multiple-run innings."
Indeed, every time Stanford forged a
lead in the three games, the Sun Devils
came roaring back. On Friday, the Car
dinal lead 1-0 in the top of the first
before Arizona State scored five runs in

tha bottom of the inning off Stanford
senior starter Lee Plemel, and won going
away.
Saturday's game, a three-and-one-half
hour marathon played in 100-degree
heat, had more twists and turns than a
soap opera plot. Stanford jumped out to
a 2-0 lead, then trailed 6-2, came back
to tie at 6-6, fell behind again 9-6, and
went ahead 10-9, only to watch the Sun
Devils score twice in the bottom of the
eighth off junior reliever Steve Chitren
to prevail 11-10.
Yesterday's game was also a roller
coaster affair. Stanford scored three in
the first and went up 4-0 in the third
when Sprague lashed one of his
trademark line-drive homers into the
street behind the left field fence. It was
his eighth homer of the year.
Not surprisingly, Arizona State came
*back, scoring once in the third off Stan
ford freshman starter Stan Spencer and
then three times in the fourth, timed
game 4-4 on a two-run home run to left

by Pat Listach.
The Cardinal took the lead back in the
fifth when Arizona State reliever Linty
Ingram walked three men to load the
bases. Junior Eric DeGraw then stroked
a two-out single into left to score two
and put Stanford up 6-4.
The lead didn't last long. Plemel, who
had pitched four innings on Friday, came
on in relief of Spencer and was in im
mediate trouble. He hit two batters with
pitches, then surrendered a run-scoring
single to Ricky Candelari and a two-run
double to Kim Spehr that put the Sun
Devils up 7-6.
Stanford struck back in the sixth.
Sophomore Troy Paulen led off with a
liner down the right-field line that was
ruled an error on Arizona State
rightfielder Dan Rumsey. Junior Ron
Witmeyer ripped a line shot right at Sun
Devil second baseman Kevin Higgins, and
in an attempt to double Paulsen off first,
Higgins threw the ball into the Stanford
dugout, allowing Paulsen to advance to

third. He came home on Sprague's single
into left to tie the game 7-7, but the air
was taken out of the Cardinal's rally
when Sprague was nailed trying to
stretch the hit into a double.
The score stayed at 7-7 until the bot
tom of the eighth. With two outs, Listach
singled to right off Plemel, then went to
third on John Finn's single. That brought
up Higgins, hitless in 10 at-bats in the
series. He turned on Plemel's and lofted
a long fly to right. All caught in the stiff
wind blowing out to right and carried
out of the stadium for a three-run home
run that gave the Sun Devils a 10-7 lead.
"I don't think that ball goes out nor
mally," Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "He got it up in the air, and it went
out."
"I happened to get a pitch I could
handle," Higgins said.
The Cardinal will look to bounce back
when it warms up for the California se
ries with a non-league game at 2:30 p.m.
at Santa Clara.
