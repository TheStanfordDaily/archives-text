# Gymnasts take 2nd at Pac-10s

### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
The Stanford
men's gymnastics
team got off to a
slow start at this
weekend's Pacific
10 Conference
Championships,

but recovered to finish strong, set
tling for second place behind a
revamped UCLA squad.
The host Bruins, who earlier in
the season were so hampered with
injuries that they could not field
a full team, won the meet with
286.65 points. The Cardinal's
283.55 came despite an uncharac
teristically high number of missed
routines on the part of the Stan
ford gymnasts. Next for the Car
dinal are the NCAA Champion
ships in Lincoln, Neb., April 15-
17. Stanford, UCLA, Illinois and
Nebraska are considered the
prime contenders for the national
title.
"It's a good kick in the ass for
the NCAAs," co-captain Randy
Besosa said. "Everyone's pretty
disappointed and hopefully that
will drive us to the champion
ships."
According to Stanford Coach
Sadao Hamada, the Cardinal fell
prey to unfortunate scheduling,
which led to the mental lapses
blamed for 12 missed routines.
UCLA, with the help of a sparse
home crowd and Mexican Olym
pian Tony Pineda who just re
cently returned to the team,
missed only three routines during
Friday night's team competition
for what Hamada said is probably
the nation's top score so far this
year.
"We learned a valuable lesson,
but it was disappointing because
we knew we could beat them,"
Hamada said. "UCLA was really
tough, they really deserved to win.

They're a big threat now that all
their guys are healthy."
Hamada said that the Stanford
was placed on the vault in the
first round Friday night and then
had a bye for the second round.
The vault was judged very tightly,
and although the scoring was not
biased against the Cardinal, the
team finished the event with a
low score.
Meanwhile, UCLA started off
at full steam hitting the high bar
and then, while Stanford watched
from the sidelines, the floor ex
ercise. It was not until the last
couple events that Stanford really
put solid event scores together.
Stanford gymnasts brought
home a number of medals from
Saturday night's individual event
championships. Senior Chuck
Gerardo took first on the rings,
and third on the pommel horse
and high bar. Second-place honors
were achieved by senior Mike
Matzek, junior Scott SchafTer and
sophomore Conrad Voorsangr, on
the rings, vault, and parallel bars,
respectively.
In the all-around individual
race, consisting of both the op
tional and compulsory competi
tions, Gerardo finished fifth and
Matzek finished eighth. Califor
nia's Bob Sundstrom dominated
this part of the meet, winning by
over a point at 113.85 for the two
days.
Going into the compulsory
events, Besosa was fourth after a
57.10 optionals total, but dropped
out of the competition rather than
sacrifice a sore knee better saved
for the NCAAs. Besosa also did
not compete in the individual
event finals. Hamada predicted
that neither Besosa nor any other
Cardinal gymnast will be seriously
hampered by injuries at the
NCAAs.
