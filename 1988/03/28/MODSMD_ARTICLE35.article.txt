# Men swim away from Pac-10 competition
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
While fellow students prepared for
final exams, the Stanford men's swim
team was far from comatose during
Dead Week. Coming off a 5-5 dual
meet season, the underdog squad
completely outdistanced all competi
tors in cruising to its seventh con-

secutive Pacific 10 Conference Championship March
9-11 in Long Beach.
The defending national champion Cardinal
crushed nationally first-ranked USC by 149 points,
tallying 753 points to the second place Trojans' 604.
Nationally fourth-ranked UCLA placed third, fol
lowed by California, Arizona State, Arizona and
Washington.
"It was the best team effort that Stanford has
ever had at Pac-10's," Coach Skip Kenney said.
"We had more lifetime best swims and bigger drops
in times than we have ever had before."
By virtue of its margin of victory and qualification
of 16 swimmers and one diver to the NCAA Cham
pionships, the previously struggling Stanford squad
has once again established itself as a legitimate
contender for the NCAA crown.

The Cardinal's perseverance throughout its up
and-down dual meet season and belief in its training
regimen paid off as almost every single swimmer
clocked personal bests and the team took first place
in eight events.
"It was like the beginning of the season had never
happened," sophomore freestyler Lunn Lestina said.
"It was a pure team effort."
Stanford's domination began during the first
event of the first day of competition. In the 500-yard
free trials, Lestina sliced 10 seconds off his best
time while winning his heat and qualifying for
NCAA's with a 4:20.18.
"Lunn's great swim was like a green light which
gave us permission to go crazy," sophomore freestyle
sprinter Doug Lillydahl said. "The first event was
awesome. It really got momentum going."
In the next trial, the 200 individual medly, four
swimmers answered Lestina's performance by
making cuts. Senior Matt Nance, sophomore Byron
Burson, junior Dave Schraven, and freshman Matt
Rogers all swam times which qualified for the na
tional championships, with Nance, Burson and
Schraven (swimming his best time ever by a second
and a half) making it to the finals of their event.
"It was really just keeping the momentum going
after the first event and getting stronger," Schraven

said. "From the 500 free on we knew the meet was
going to go well."
Lestina placed second in the 500, and with his
fifth-place finish John Witchel also qualified for
nationals. In the 200 1M Nance also took second
and was followed in the finals by Burson in third
and Schraven in sixth place.
Jeff Garr qualified and took sixth in the 50 free,
and the first day of competition was completed by
a resounding 3:16.85 victory in the medley relay
(junior Jay Mortenson, Rogers, senior Anthony
Mosse and junior John Hodge). Only one-third of
the way through the championships, the Cardinal
led by 53 points and never looked back.
"After the first two or three events we could tell
we were going to do well. The other squads looked
pretty stunned after the first day," Rogers said.
Highlighting the second day of the meet was
Mortenson's double victory: the 100 butterfly and
the 100 backstroke. Lillydahl took fourth, Burson
fifth, and Mosse eighth in the fly, while junior Kurt
Krosche placed third and sophomore Rick Gould
fourth in the back event.
Senior backstroker Sean Murphy was disqualified
for not touching the wall. All-American Witchel won
the 200 free in 1:36.57, and Hodge finished sixth
and Lestina eighth. The 800 free relay team

(Witchel, Hodge, Burson and Lestina) placed second
in 6:30.82 while making the cut by over eight
seconds. USC trailed the Cardinal by 115 points.
"By the second day we knew we were going to
have good swims when we got up on the blocks,"
Lillydahl said.
Stanford completed its romp by winning three
individual events on the final day of the competition.
Two-time national champion Murphy led a Cardinal
sweep of the 200 back. Nance took second and
Gould third. Mosse won the 200 fly and was followed
by Schraven in fourth, while Rodgers was victorious
in the 200 breast.
The Cardinal's 753 points was more than that
totaled by last year's squad led by All American
Pablo Morales and JefT Kostoff. "This meet really
showed how important momentum is," Kenney said.
"Based on our dual meet times we should have
been third in the meet. There was a real snowball
effect from Lestina's swim."
The 16 swimmers the Cardinal qualified to the
national championships April 7-9 make up the larg
est Stanford NCAA contingent since 1983. With its
extra depth and championship experience added to
its new found momentum, the Cardinal is hoping
to begin a post-Morales/Kostoff swimming dynasty
by securing its fourth consecutive national crown.

event of the first day of competition. In the 500-yard
free trials, Lestina sliced 10 seconds off his best
time while winning his heat and qualifying for
NCAA's with a 4:20.18.
"Lunn's great swim was like a green light which
gave us permission to go crazy," sophomore freestyle
sprinter Doug Lillydahl said. "The first event was
awesome. It really got momentum going."
In the next trial, the 200 individual medly, four
swimmers answered Lestina's performance by
making cuts. Senior Matt Nance, sophomore Byron
Burson, junior Dave Schraven, and freshman Matt
Rogers all swam times which qualified for the na
tional championships, with Nance, Burson and
Schraven (swimming his best time ever by a second
and a half) making it to the finals of their event.
"It was really just keeping the momentum going
after the first event and getting stronger," Schraven

said. "From the 500 free on we knew the meet was
going to go well."
Lestina placed second in the 500, and with his
fifth-place finish John Witchel also qualified for
nationals. In the 200 1M Nance also took second
and was followed in the finals by Burson in third
and Schraven in sixth place.
Jeff Garr qualified and took sixth in the 50 free,
and the first day of competition was completed by
a resounding 3:16.85 victory in the medley relay
(junior Jay Mortenson, Rogers, senior Anthony
Mosse and junior John Hodge). Only one-third of
the way through the championships, the Cardinal
led by 53 points and never looked back.
"After the first two or three events we could tell
we were going to do well. The other squads looked
pretty stunned after the first day," Rogers said.
Highlighting the second day of the meet was
Mortenson's double victory: the 100 butterfly and
the 100 backstroke. Lillydahl took fourth, Burson
fifth, and Mosse eighth in the fly, while junior Kurt
Krosche placed third and sophomore Rick Gould
fourth in the back event.
Senior backstroker Sean Murphy was disqualified
for not touching the wall. All-American Witchel won
the 200 free in 1:36.57, and Hodge finished sixth
and Lestina eighth. The 800 free relay team

(Witchel, Hodge, Burson and Lestina) placed second
in 6:30.82 while making the cut by over eight
seconds. USC trailed the Cardinal by 115 points.
"By the second day we knew we were going to
have good swims when we got up on the blocks,"
Lillydahl said.
Stanford completed its romp by winning three
individual events on the final day of the competition.
Two-time national champion Murphy led a Cardinal
sweep of the 200 back. Nance took second and
Gould third. Mosse won the 200 fly and was followed
by Schraven in fourth, while Rodgers was victorious
in the 200 breast.
The Cardinal's 753 points was more than that
totaled by last year's squad led by All American
Pablo Morales and JefT Kostoff. "This meet really
showed how important momentum is," Kenney said.
"Based on our dual meet times we should have
been third in the meet. There was a real snowball
effect from Lestina's swim."
The 16 swimmers the Cardinal qualified to the
national championships April 7-9 make up the larg
est Stanford NCAA contingent since 1983. With its
extra depth and championship experience added to
its new found momentum, the Cardinal is hoping
to begin a post-Morales/Kostoff swimming dynasty
by securing its fourth consecutive national crown.

While fellow students prepared for
final exams, the Stanford men's swim
team was far from comatose during
Dead Week. Coming off a 5-5 dual
meet season, the underdog squad
completely outdistanced all competi
tors in cruising to its seventh con-

secutive Pacific 10 Conference Championship March
9-11 in Long Beach.
The defending national champion Cardinal
crushed nationally first-ranked USC by 149 points,
tallying 753 points to the second place Trojans' 604.
Nationally fourth-ranked UCLA placed third, fol
lowed by California, Arizona State, Arizona and
Washington.
"It was the best team effort that Stanford has
ever had at Pac-10's," Coach Skip Kenney said.
"We had more lifetime best swims and bigger drops
in times than we have ever had before."
By virtue of its margin of victory and qualification
of 16 swimmers and one diver to the NCAA Cham
pionships, the previously struggling Stanford squad
has once again established itself as a legitimate
contender for the NCAA crown.

The Cardinal's perseverance throughout its up
and-down dual meet season and belief in its training
regimen paid off as almost every single swimmer
clocked personal bests and the team took first place
in eight events.
"It was like the beginning of the season had never
happened," sophomore freestyler Lunn Lestina said.
"It was a pure team effort."
