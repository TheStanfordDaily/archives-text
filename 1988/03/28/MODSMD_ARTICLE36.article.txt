### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The Stanford
women's golf
team finally
came into its
own last week,
and it could not
have picked a

more idyllic setting. Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin's linksters
picked up their first victory in
two years at the Kaneohe Klip
per Golf Course in Hawaii. The
team's three-round score of
926 was good for a decisive vic
tory over second-place Wash
ington, which finished far be
hind at 946.
Senior Kay Cornelius and
freshman Jodi Figley starred
for Stanford, tying for the tour
nament's low medal score at
the ( end of the 54-hole tourna
ment. The two golfers finished
regulation play with identical
scores of 226 (77-73-76, and
76-73-77, respectively) to force
a playoff.
Cornelius took the title after
the first hole of sudden death,
carding a par to Figley's bogey.
Cornelius commented that it
was "difficult to be in a playoff
with a teammate," but that she

was happy for the win, which
was her first individual title in
a college tournament.
"I can't describe how good
it felt (to win)," Cornelius said.
"It was good to break out of
such a long dry spell."
Freshman Kristin Ryan also
had a solid tournament, firing
a total of 231 (79-74-78), which
was good enough for sixth place
overall in the tourney.
Stanford's senior golf star at
tributed her fine play to con
sistent putting and few mental
errors. She added that both she
and Figley had great concen
tration in Hawaii, which en
abled them to focus on their
games more than they had in
previous outings.
Cornelius said that the eight
team field in Hawaii was not
the most challenging for the
Cardinal, as shown by their 20-
point victory margin and one
two individual medalist finish.
But the tournament gave the
team a much needed boost
going into the final part of the
season. The women golfers will
be trying to qualify for the
NCAA championship, and ac
cording to Cornelius, they will
"need good scores" in their
next outings.
