Freshman David
Wheaton, recov
ered from a De
cember injury to
his left wrist,
bolstered an al
ready potent Stan-

ford singles lineup during spring
break to spark the Cardinal to
convincing wins over Ohio State
at Stanford Tennis Stadium, and
Arizona State and Arizona on the
road.
Wheaton, the nation's sixth
rated player, won his three singles
and doubles matches, helping No.
3 Stanford raise its season record
to 12-1. No. 1 USC is the only
team to beat the Cardinal this
year.
Playing at the No. 3 position
in singles, Wheaton defeated Ohio
State's Kevin Debelius 6-0, 6-3,
ASU's Mike Holten 6-7, 6-3, 6-1,
and Arizona's John Schmitt 2-6,
6-4, 7-6. The singles matches were
Wheaton's first in a dual-match
this season.
"It's real nice to have David in
the lineup," Stanford Asst. Coach
John Whitlinger said. "He's very
close to being 100 percent. He
played some great doubles. In the
clutch, David came through;
that's what winners do."
Wednesday, the Cardinal
steamrolled over the out-manned
Ohio State Buckeyes 9-0. At No.
1 doubles, Wheaton teamed with
sophomore Jeff Tarango to out
last the Buckeye tandem of Scott
Weisman and Steve Miguel 1-6,
6-2, 6-3. Weisman and Miguel are
the nation's 12th-rated duo. With
the loss, Ohio State dropped to
14-1.
"We just haven't had to play at
this level for a while," Ohio State
Coach John Daly said. "It makes
it difficult. This is a great team
— no doubt about it — I think
this is the greatest program you
could ever want."

beat a tough Arizona State team

beating the Arizona Wildcats 8-0
in a match closer than the score
indicates. Five of the six singles
matches went to three sets, and
sophomore Eric Peus was pressed
into singles duty because of an
injury to starter Curtis Dunn.
"Almost any team this year has
the potential to beat anyone on
a given day," Cathrall said. "You
have to play the best you can in
every match. And if we do that,
I think we should win."
McEnroe polished off Paul
Landry 6-1, 6-1, but the rest of
the Cardinal starters had a more

ran its Pac-10 record to 2-0 by
beating the Arizona Wildcats 8-0
in a match closer than the score
indicates. Five of the six singles
matches went to three sets, and
sophomore Eric Peus was pressed
into singles duty because of an
injury to starter Curtis Dunn.
"Almost any team this year has
the potential to beat anyone on
a given day," Cathrall said. "You
have to play the best you can in
every match. And if we do that,
I think we should win."
McEnroe polished off Paul
Landry 6-1, 6-1, but the rest of
the Cardinal starters had a more
difficult road to victory. Tarango
defeated lan Aler 6-4, 4-6, 7-5,
and freshman Martin Blackman
beat Doug Livingston 6-7, 6-4, 6-
4.
Cathrall conquered Scott Siger
seth 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, while Peus out
lasted Jeff Speir 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. The
Wildcats are now 8-10 on the
season, 0-7 in Pac-10 play.
