# Track opens outdoor season
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Athletics fused with in
tellectualism March 20,
when the Stanford track
team hosted the annual
Meeting of the Minds to
open its home meet
schedule.

More significantly, however, the Car
dinal hosted the Holiday Inn Track Fes
tival, also known as the Stanford
Invitational, Friday and Saturday, along
with sending several representatives to
the NCAA indoor championships and
returned with two Ail-Americans,
seniors Lisa Bernhagen and Patty Pur
pur.
The men's distance runners and the
the throwers distinguished themselves
at the Stanford Invitational, where over
3,000 high school and college athletes
competed. Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson called the teams' efforts over
spring break "two of the best back-to
back performances since I've been
here."
The men's distance medley team beat
rival and Pacific 10 Conference cross
country champ Arizona in the distance
medley Friday. David Strang led off with
a three-lap leg in 2 minutes, 54 seconds,
and passed to another freshman, James
Crampton, who went 400 meters with
Stanford in the lead. Sophomore Bill

Crowley went against tough competition
in the 800-meter leg.
Marc Olesen ran with the competition
for two laps before leaving the pack in
the dust with a mile just under four
minutes. His final time of 9:32.85 broke
a 1960 school record. Venessa Henlon
also set a school record in a newer col
lege event, the women's triple jump.
Henlon was second with 40 feet, 10 and
one-quarter inches but still added three
feet to the old mark.
Earlier, Stanford had sent a contin
gent of four athletes to the NCAA In
door Nationals. Bernhagen, the 1987
high jump champion, fell short in her
quest to repeat but still took home All-
American honors in fifth place. Purpur
also finished fifth in the shot put to
take honors.
Senior Brian Marshall finished out of
the running in the men's high jump,
knocked from the top six based on
misses.
Purpur also won the shot put finals
Saturday with a throw of 49-3. Glen
Schneider, a junior, won the discus Sat
urday with a toss of 181-2 after throw
ing over 186 feet in qualifying.
Saturday featured yet another Stan
ford victory, with the 4-by-l mile relay
winning in 17:01.75. Freshmen Chris
Rae and Jason Martin teamed with
sophomore Eric Mastalir and senior
Steve Schadler. On Friday, Rae,
Crowley, Schadler and Strang took

second in the two-mile relay in 7:25.99.
Katty McCandless, a Stanford hope
ful, won both the mile and the 3,000
meters, taking the mile in 5:03.3.
McCandless will be joining the Cardinal
next year if she is admitted to the Uni
versity.
The Stanford Invitational, spectacu
lar as it was, was not the Stanford
home opener. The Meeting of the Minds,
scheduled for March 20, was almost
canceled when Harvard and Rice
dropped out. Northwestern held its
commitment and was joined by San
Fransisco University and the College of
Notre Dame-Belmont.
The meet worked out well for'the
Cardinal, however, as the squad
dominated the meet and won 29 events,
including the 100 meters to the 1,500
meter run.
There were two double winners, and
it came as no surprise that sophomore
Carol Gray was one of them. What was
unusual, however, was that she was
running the two longest distances, the
3,000- and 5,000-meter events. Gray did
not finish her race at the Invitational,
but had no such problems last Sunday.
The other was sophomore Peter
Kolotouros in the 110-meter hurdles
and the 200 meters. He qualified for
the Pac-10 Championships by running
the hurdles in 14.4 seconds, and took
the 200 in 22.06.

Henlon was second with 40 feet, 10 and
one-quarter inches but still added three
feet to the old mark.
Earlier, Stanford had sent a contin
gent of four athletes to the NCAA In
door Nationals. Bernhagen, the 1987
high jump champion, fell short in her
quest to repeat but still took home All-
American honors in fifth place. Purpur
also finished fifth in the shot put to
take honors.
Senior Brian Marshall finished out of
the running in the men's high jump,
knocked from the top six based on
misses.
Purpur also won the shot put finals
Saturday with a throw of 49-3. Glen
Schneider, a junior, won the discus Sat
urday with a toss of 181-2 after throw
ing over 186 feet in qualifying.
Saturday featured yet another Stan
ford victory, with the 4-by-l mile relay
winning in 17:01.75. Freshmen Chris
Rae and Jason Martin teamed with
sophomore Eric Mastalir and senior
Steve Schadler. On Friday, Rae,
Crowley, Schadler and Strang took

second in the two-mile relay in 7:25.99.
Katty McCandless, a Stanford hope
ful, won both the mile and the 3,000
meters, taking the mile in 5:03.3.
McCandless will be joining the Cardinal
next year if she is admitted to the Uni
versity.
The Stanford Invitational, spectacu
lar as it was, was not the Stanford
home opener. The Meeting of the Minds,
scheduled for March 20, was almost
canceled when Harvard and Rice
dropped out. Northwestern held its
commitment and was joined by San
Fransisco University and the College of
Notre Dame-Belmont.
The meet worked out well for'the
Cardinal, however, as the squad
dominated the meet and won 29 events,
including the 100 meters to the 1,500
meter run.
There were two double winners, and
it came as no surprise that sophomore
Carol Gray was one of them. What was
unusual, however, was that she was
running the two longest distances, the
3,000- and 5,000-meter events. Gray did
not finish her race at the Invitational,
but had no such problems last Sunday.
The other was sophomore Peter
Kolotouros in the 110-meter hurdles
and the 200 meters. He qualified for
the Pac-10 Championships by running
the hurdles in 14.4 seconds, and took
the 200 in 22.06.
