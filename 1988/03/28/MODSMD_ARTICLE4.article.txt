# Reed College interviews Chace for presidential post
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Western Culture may lose its
staunchest supporter. Vice Provost and
English Prof. William Chace, who has
strongly argued for the retention of the
core list in the Western Culture debate
here, is being considered for the
presidency of Reed College in Portland,
Ore., a Reed official confirmed yesterday.
Reed interviewed 12 people for the
presidency and has narrowed the selec
tion to four candidates, including Chace,
according to Reed Prof. Ray Kierstead,
a member of the selection committee.

The college is expected
to announce a decision
on the appointment this
morning.
Describing Chace as
"somewhat of a reluctant
candidate," Kierstead
said that because Chace
"likes Stanford so much"
his candidacy for the job
was "never quite offi-

cial." Although Chace was unavailable
for comment last night, Kierstead said
Chace two weeks ago visited the small
liberal arts school and met with Reed's
selection committee.

All Reed freshmen take a required hu
manities program that is very similar to
the type of Western Culture program
Chace has fervently fought for through
out the ongoing Area One debate. Reed's
program has a required syllabus of great
works ranging from Ancient Greece
through the European Middle Ages and
"is definitely a Western culture course,"
Kierstead said.
Although in the past Chace has argued
that changes in Stanford's Western Cul
ture program might alienate some pro
fessors, English Chair Albert Gelpi said
he did not believe that Chace would leave
Stanford because of the Western Culture

issue.
Gelpi said he did not realize that Reed
was considering Chace for president but
said he "was not surprised," considering
Chace's "wonderful administrative tal
ent." Since 1985 Chace has been the vice

provost for Academic Planning and De
velopment and has been an English pro
fessor here for the past 20 years.
According to Gelpi, Chace has "the kind
of quality" that would make him a good
president for Reed — or for Stanford.
Gelpi speculated that Chace might be
particularly attracted to Reed because he
had a positive undergraduate experience
at Haverford College — a small liberal
arts school in Pennsylvania similar to
Reed.
"Chace is deeply committed to Haver
ford and like it," Gelpi said. "He
has always been deeply committed to un
dergraduate education."
