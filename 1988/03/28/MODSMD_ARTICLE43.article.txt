# Faculty Senate study targets grade inflation
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Responding to faculty charges
that grading at Stanford is not
"sufficiently challenging," a Fac
ulty Senate committee will
release a study re-evaluating the
University's grading policies
next month.
David Wellbery, a professor of
German and comparative litera
ture and chair of the Faculty
Senate Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, said
the committee has received fac
ulty complaints about excessive
grade inflation, overuse of the
"incomplete" grade and abuse of
the Pass/No Credit option in
courses that fulfill distribution
requirements.
Although the committee does
not yet have sufficient data to
prove the existence of significant
grade inflation at Stanford, Well
bery noted that "there was some
grade inflation years ago. ... It
was quite a trend, and it's clear
it wasn't just a Stanford trend"
because many other universities
were experiencing similar infla
tion.
Wellbery said the committee
report, which was initated last

fall, will be completed by mid-
April and then submitted to the
senate for review.
According to committee mem
ber Charles Junkerman, the
committee is surveying faculty,
professors and graduate school
committees to gather data about
grades. Junkerman, an assistant
to the dean for special programs
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences, explained that the com
mittee is especially interested in
finding the patterns of grading
that cause inflation.
For example, Junkerman said
he suspects that grades are
higher in the humanities than
in the natural sciences. He at
tributed this to the fact that
many science courses are larger
and more impersonal. He
stressed, however, that the com
mittee has not yet gathered
"hard evidence" on the subject.
According to Junkerman, the
committee routinely reassesses
the grading system at Stanford
every five years, but it is difficult
to persuade the senate to adopt
grading policy changes.
Both hardliners and easier
graders appear to be represented
among the current faculty at
Stanford. Most professors, how

ever, do not want the "F" grade
— abandoned in 1968 — brought
back, and some have attempted
to remove student emphasis on
grades altogether.
For example, in the Structured
Liberal Education Western Cul
ture track, students do not
receive grades on any work until
the end of the quarter. They only
receive extensive comments on
their papers and exams.
However, other professors em
phasize the need, expressed in a
landmark Faculty Senate report
on grading in 1968, for an "ab
solute definition" of grades or a
straight grading scale. This
would replace the practice of
grading students along a distri
bution curve.
Currently, professors have the
choice of grading by either meth
od.
Biology Prof. Ward Watt, who
grades on a straight scale, said
he sees no sign of grade inflation
at Stanford. He said he "encour
ages people to pay as little at
tention as possible" to grades.
"A 'C' grade is satisfactory, a 'B'
is above average, an 'A' is supe
rior ... and we should leave it
at that," he said.
Watt characterized his own

grading system as a "judgment
call" that does not conform to
"a non-existen* distribution
somewhere in the sky."
"I consider a 'C' a solid, decent
respectable sort of grade," said
English Prof. Simone Di Piero,
another proponent of "absolute"
grading. "Students are some
times shocked to receive a 'C'
grade" because it goes "against
their expectations."
However, Di Piero said he
found that his "tough grading"
frequently leads to improvement
in student performance.
The grading debate has a long
history at Stanford.
In 1981, the senate narrowly
rejected a recommendation by
the committee to reinstate the
"F" grade and to introduce a
new transcript mark to indicate
the late dropping of a course. At
that time, the committee ex
pressed concerns that the lack
of lower grades encouraged stu
dents to drop courses in which
they were not doing well.
This trend was seen as unfair
to students who persevere with
their courses and receive "C" and
"D" grades. According to the
committee's report, the installa
tion of a "late withdrawal" grade

also would have required
reinstating the "F" grade to
avoid unfairness to students who
withdraw late, because otherwise
failing students would not be
penalized.
Although hesitant to link the
lack of "F" grades to grade in
flation, Registrar Sally Mahoney,
a member of the 1981 commit
tee, said that as a result, the
committee found a "plateau of
relatively high grade distribu
tions."
But the committee's recom
mendations were rejected be
cause of a long-held faculty aver
sion to "precision grading"
dating back to 1968, when
grading reforms were first in
stituted.
At that time, Stanford elimi
nated both the "D" and the "F"
grade. The main reason given
was that such grades imply a
precision in grading that is mis
leading. According to the 1968
study, grades are "an important
but variable factor" in determin
ing academic achievement.
The philosophy expressed in
the report emphasized the use
of grades as a record of achieve
ment rather than a simple ac
count of coursework.
