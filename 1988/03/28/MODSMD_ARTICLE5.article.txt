# Lagunita suffers in dry spell
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
While Stanford students bask
in California's characteristically
warm spring weather, this year's
dry season will once again leave
Lake Lagunita three feet shal
lower than it should be and dry
out many other areas of the state.
According to Cheryl Jensen,
manager of mechanical utilities in
University Operations and Main
tenance, for the second year in a
row the lake will only be filled to
a level of nine feet, rather than
its normal 12-foot level. The proc
ess of filling the lake began earlier
this month when workers started
pumping water from San Fran
cisquito Creek into the lake.
"If the creek is low, we don't
fill the lake all the way," Jensen

said. The Athletic Department
"would like 12 feet, but they'll
accept it at nine," she said.
After a Menlo Park resident
pointed out that the creek was
suffering from the drainage, the
University switched to alternate
sources on Stanford property in
the foothills, Felt Lake and
Searsville Lake.
Jensen said the Athletic Depart
ment needs a minimum of nine
feet of water to conduct sailing
and windsurfing classes in the
spring.
Carl Landers, the ASSU Boat
house facilities manager, said the
lowered level should not affect
recreational activities and athle
tics classes on the lake.
"There's not as much usable
lake, but it's definitely not going
to be a problem," he said. "The

facility is great even at nine feet."
According to Landers, the lake
should be filled by early next
week.
The decision to partially fill the
lake reflects the growing water
shortage problem statewide. Cal
ifornia is experiencing what the
state Water Department calls a
"critically dry year." State rainfall
totals to date are only 66 percent
of normal levels, and river runoffs
from melting snowpack stand at
less than 50 percent of the
average.
But water officials are hesitant
to declare a drought until after
next year's rain season. Cur
rently, water storage in reservoirs
stands at 90 percent of normal
levels statewide, which should last
