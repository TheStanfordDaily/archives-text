# Geiger bans drug tests at track meet
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
The Athletics Congress simply
pulled the wrong name out of the
hat.
Early last week, TAC, the na
tional governing body of amateur
track and field, randomly chose
the Stanford/Holiday Inn Invita
tional as the Western region site
for drug testing, but Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger refused to al
low testing at the meet, which
was held on Friday and Saturday.
As a result, TAC officials in
formed Geiger that the meet
would not be sanctioned by TAC,
and thus any open competitors —

non-college or non-high school
athletes — could jeopardize their
status by participating in the
meet.
"They claim our meet came up
on their computer as a meet to
be drug tested," Geiger said yes
terday. "It's not a situation where
we were necessarily applying for
TAC sanction. It is not their de
cision whether we drug test; I
think it's our decision, so they
witheld the sanction."
TAC official Pete Cava said that
originally the invitational was "an
open event, where anyone could
compete, so it required TAC sanc
tion.
"We divide the country up into

quarters, and meets in each
region are selected at random for
drug testing," Cava said. "By
refusing to drug test Stanford has
decided to do without TAC sanc
tion."
Two Stanford athletes, wom
en's soccer player Jennifer Hill,
a sehior, and junior football line
backer Barry McKeever, have a
suit pending in court challenging
the legality of NCAA drug testing.
Geiger said it would therefore be
"inconsistent" to allow drug test
ing on campus.
"Until we resolve whether or
not the testing is legal in Califor-
nia, we are not going to drug test
at any of our events," Geiger said.
All evidence and testimony have
been heard in the case, and the
closing arguments in the final
trial are scheduled for today.
Stanford attorney Debra Zumwalt

expects a decision soon and
predicts that the final ruling will
not alter Stanford's preliminary
victory in the case last December.
On Dec. 4, Santa Clara Superior
Court Judge Conrad Rushing
issued a preliminary injunction
that allowed Stanford athletes, ex
cept for men's basketball and foot
bail players, to compete without
being drug tested by the NCAA.

The injunction, however, does
not apply to TAC, which is sepa
rate from the NCAA.
Zumwalt said the Stanford-
NCAA case and the canceled TAC
testing are not directly connected,
but "they are related in the sense
that students' right to privacy un
der the California constitution are
violated by the drug testing
through the same principles."
