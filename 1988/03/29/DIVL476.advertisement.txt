Ip CS4OB. Expert System Applications ,
(New Course)
Anions the applications of Artificial Intelligence research, expert
systems are the most visible and important today. This course
will present case studies of many expert systems that achieved
commerical use and success. Some of the presentations will be
made by distinguished visitors — the champions that goaded and
guided their respective companies toward expert system
applications. ()f course, the basic concepts used inbuilding expert
systems will be presented. The course is intended for a broad
interdisciplinary university audience, including engineering,
information processing, business, economics, EES and VTS.
