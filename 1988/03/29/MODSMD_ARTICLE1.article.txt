# Chace will stay
## Prof. not offered Reed presidency 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Vice Provost and English Prof.
William Chace is here to stay —
at least for now.
Chace was one of four candi
dates Reed College interviewed for
its new president. But yesterday
morning the college announced
that James Powell, president of
Franklin and Marshall College in
Pennsylvania, was unanimously
selected for the position.
Although a Reed official said
Chace was a candidate who
seemed "reluctant" to leave Stan
ford, Chace said yesterday he
"was very interested" in the small
liberal arts school and went for
an interview "seriously" consider
ing the possibility of becoming the
college's president.
Chace said he was impressed
by Reed's curriculum and intel
lectual commitment, calling them
"very, very strong." He noted that
Reed is one of the top three
schools in the country for gradu
ating students who go on to earn
doctorates, while Stanford is
ranked about 43rd.
In addition, Reed has a required
freshman humanities program
that strongly resembles the pres
ent Western Culture program
here. Chace has fought for retain
ing the core list throughout the
ongoing Area One debate.
Chace, however, said that West
ern Culture was not an issue in
considering the job, especially be
cause Reed also plans on modify
ing their freshman requirement.
"(Reed's) composition is too Eu
rocentric and they mean to change
it,"he said.
Chace said his interest in Reed
did not stem from any dissatis
faction with Stanford. "If I were
ever to leave Stanford it would
not be out of resentment," he said.
"Stanford has treated me with
great respect."
Chace admitted that "some
times" he considers striving for
more influential administrative
roles at Stanford or other schools,
but said that he is also concerned
about his undergraduate teaching
and "preparing for (his) Human
ities 90 class" offered this quarter.
