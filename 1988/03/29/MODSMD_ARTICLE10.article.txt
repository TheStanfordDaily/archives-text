# Athletic Dept. to charge for stadium lot parking
## 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
A Cardinal football tradition
will end next fall. In an effort to
offset costs created by events at
Stanford Stadium, the Athletic
Department will charge motorists
$3 to park in general parking lots
around the stadium.
Director of Athletic Promotions
Gary Bruner said the money col
lected will go into the depart
ment's general operating budget,
and is necessary as an "ongoing
source of revenue."
Money from this budget will be
"earmarked to places where it is
needed the most" such as devel
opment or maintenance projects
under the control of the Athletic
Department.
Bruner said the money is ne
cessary to pay for upkeep of the
stadium itself and for the services
of the Stanford Police during
events. He added that a parking
fee would provide a steady source
of money for those expenditures.
He also said that in the depart

merit's current campaign to build
new facilities, "a buck is a buck"
â€” meaning that the department
will raise money from any avail
able source.
The University Centennial
Campaign, intended to raise over
$1 billion for the University, has
alloted $20 million for the Athletic
Department. A progress report re
leased in the March 2 Campus
Report showed that $8.9 million
had been raised for the Athletic
department at that time.
However, Bruner stressed that
in distributing Centennial funds,
academic interests would take
precedence over the needs of the
Athletic Department, and that as
a result, the department must
coordinate its own fund-raising
projects.
General parking areas, which
are currently covered with grass
or gravel, will not undergo any
special renovation in preparation
for the estimated 8,000 to 10,000
autos that will park there. Nor
will there be parking stalls, be
cause parking lot attendants will
direct automobiles into parallel
rows.
Bruner said he estimated only
a "small percentage" of football
fans would be affected by the cost
because season ticket holders will
receive free parking passes. Mean
while, other fans are more than
welcome to park anywhere else,"
such as on El Camino Real or in
free lots on campus.
Bruner said he did not think
such age-old traditions as tailgat

ing would be effected, and
predicted the cost would have a
"minimal" affect on game atten
dance.
He admitted that many Cardi
nal supporters probably would not
be "excited about it (the parking
fee) at first," but they would still
come out to support the team.
The $3 charge at Stanford
Stadium is comparable to other
Bay Area stadiums, such as San
Francisco's Candlestick Park and
San Jose's Spartan Stadium.
Bruner said he could not esti
mate how much revenue would
be generated by the fee because
of the variable number of fans at
each game. He said, however, he
did not foresee the cost increasing
in the future.


rhe Athletic Department has decided to charge $3 next fall to
ootball spectators who park in the general lots around the stadium.
