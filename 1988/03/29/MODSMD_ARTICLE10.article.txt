# Athletic Dept. to charge for stadium lot parking

A Cardinal football tradition
will end next fall. In an effort to
offset costs created by events at
Stanford Stadium, the Athletic
Department will charge motorists
$3 to park in general parking lots
around the stadium.
Director of Athletic Promotions
Gary Bruner said the money col
lected will go into the depart
ment's general operating budget,
and is necessary as an "ongoing
source of revenue."
Money from this budget will be
"earmarked to places where it is
needed the most" such as devel
opment or maintenance projects
under the control of the Athletic
Department.
Bruner said the money is ne
cessary to pay for upkeep of the
stadium itself and for the services
of the Stanford Police during
events. He added that a parking
fee would provide a steady source
of money for those expenditures.
He also said that in the depart

merit's current campaign to build
new facilities, "a buck is a buck"
â€” meaning that the department
will raise money from any avail
able source.
The University Centennial
Campaign, intended to raise over
$1 billion for the University, has
alloted $20 million for the Athletic
Department. A progress report re
leased in the March 2 Campus
Report showed that $8.9 million
had been raised for the Athletic
department at that time.
However, Bruner stressed that
in distributing Centennial funds,
academic interests would take
precedence over the needs of the
Athletic Department, and that as
a result, the department must
coordinate its own fund-raising
projects.
General parking areas, which
are currently covered with grass
or gravel, will not undergo any
special renovation in preparation
for the estimated 8,000 to 10,000
autos that will park there. Nor
