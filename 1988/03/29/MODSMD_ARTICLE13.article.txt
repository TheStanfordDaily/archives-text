S. Africans raid Botswana
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — South
African commandos crossed into neighboring
Botswana early yesterday, raiding a home in
a suburb of Gaborone, the capital, and killing
four people whom Pretoria described as
African National Congress guerrillas.
The South African Defense Force, acknowl
edging the strike, said in a statement that its
troops acted on information acquired in a bor
der patrol attack Friday in which three
suspected terrorists were killed and a small
cache of weapons was seized, including auto
matic rifles, pistols and hand grenades.
The cross-border raid was the latest indica
tion of Pretoria's displeasure with its neigh
bors, which South Africa says have allowed
themselves to be used as staging areas for
ANC military activities.
After a guerrilla rocket attack on a farm in
northern South Africa several weeks ago, gov
ernment officials repeated a vow to pursue
guerrillas into neighboring countries if such
action was needed to stop acts of sabotage.
The Botswana raid, and the killing of three
alleged terrorists on South African territory
near the border a few days earlier, was "further
evidence that ANC terrorists, originating from
Zambia and Zimbabwe, use Botswana as a
transit route to infiltrate into South Africa,"
the military command said.
Germany arrests Soviet spies
BONN, West Germany — In a move hailed
as "the biggest blow to the Soviet secret serv
ice" since 1949, West German officials an
nounced yesterday that they are holding six
suspected Soviet spies after a massive search
and arrest operation.
Federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann, speaking
at a news conference in Karlsruhe, said that
the roundup had made a "vast breach" in the
Soviet spy network in West Germany. Some
of the agents, he said, had been operating in
West Germany for years, providing military
and technical secrets to the Soviets.
In a related development, Swiss authorities
announced in Bern that they had apprehended
on espionage charges a 40-year-old engineer
living in Zurich. They said that the man, whose
name and nationality were not released, was
taken into custody on the basis of information
provided by West German authorities.
One of those in custody in Germany, Vienna
born businessman Helmut Kolasch, 44, was
said to have passed documents to Moscow
since 1971, including material on the Tornado,
the NATO jet fighter and the new Jaeger 90,
the Eurofighter being designed by technicians
from four nations.
Also in custody were three engineers and
two teachers, all of whom Rebmann said had
been operating independently and were not
part of a spy ring.
Nicaraguan truce talks begin
SAPOA, Nicaragua — Contra leaders began
talks with the Sandinista government yester
day on a separation of military forces, but
they said that the April 1 start of a formal
two-month truce is likely to be delayed.
Aristidcs Sanchez, head of the rebel delega
tion, announced after three hours of talks that
negotiators will meet again today and then
adjourn "until a later date" if their work
remains unfinished.
Under the preliminary peace agreement
signed here Wednesday, all armed rebels in
Nicaragua must gather in truce zones starting
Friday. By then, the negotiators are supposed
to map the zones, decide how the rebels are
to be resupplied and agree on how to resolve
truce violations.
A separate round of negotiations is to start
in Managua on April 6 to set the political
terms for disarming the estimated 10,000 anti-
Sandinista guerrillas and thus achieve a defini
tive cease-fire.
As yesterday's talks opened at this southern
border post, the rebels handed the government
a map of proposed truce zones. But they said
that they had not had time to prepare other
technical aspects of their proposal.
A rebel press representative, Bosco
Matamoros, said that the issues under discus
sion "are very complex and do not have magic
formulas."
Armenian protests continue
MOSCOW — Work stoppages throughout
the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region of So
viet Azerbaijan had halted rail traffic and in
dustry over the weekend, the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda said Monday.
Freight yard workers in Stepanakert left 93
railway cars unloaded Sunday, Pravda said.
Stepanakert is the capital of the autonomous
region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where ethnic Ar
menians have been demanding Kremlin action
to link the region with the neighboring Soviet
republic of Armenia.
The newspaper stopped short of describing
the idle freight yard as the scene of a strike,
however.
"The difficult state of affairs which
developed at the Stepanakert station and at
many enterprises of the region in February
and March due to people's absenteeism from
work has aggravated the economic situation
not only in Nagorno-Karabakh but also, partly,
in the entire republic," Pravda said.
Soviet authorities ruled last week that there
would be no change in the boundaries of the
disputed region and directed local party leaders
and law enforcement agencies to put an end
to "nationalistic" demonstrations in both Ar
menia and Azerbaijan.
