# Israel closes off West Bank, Gaza
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — The Israeli army yes
terday declared the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip to be closed military areas,
imposing unprecedented restrictions for
the next three days on the 1.4 million
Palestinian Arabs who live in the ter
ritories.
More than 600,000 Arab residents of the
Gaza Strip were confined to their homes
under an area-wide curfew that went into
effect at 10 p.m. yesterday. About 800,000
Arabs in the West Bank were restricted to
their towns or villages.
The order effectively seals the so-called
Green Line that divides Israel proper from
the territories it occupied in the 1967 Arab-
Israeli War. The only people allowed to
travel back and forth freely, besides mili
tary personnel, are the approximately
70,000 Jewish settlers who live in 118
towns and outposts in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
The media also is banned from the ter
ritories, except for persons with special
authorization from the army spokesman's
office and who are accompanied by an army
representative.
The Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson,
Brig. Gen. Efraim Lapid, announced that
the extraordinary measures had been taken
in order "to maintain law, order and se

curity" in the face of demonstrations
planned for tomorrow. The date, March
30, is commemorated here as "Land Day"
in memory of six demonstrators who were
killed in 1976 protesting the confiscation
of Arab lands in northern Israel.
Land Day is customarily observed mainly
by the 700,000 Arabs who live as Israeli
citizens within Israel's pre-1967 borders,
but this year it has been declared a day
of solidarity with the Palestinian uprising
that has rocked the West Bank and Gaza
Strip for nearly 16 weeks.
The Unified National Leadership for the
Uprising in the Occupied Territories has
called for "huge demonstrations against
the army and settlers" to coincide with
protests and a general strike planned by
Israeli Arabs.
"Since the intifada (uprising) is taking
place both in the West Bank and in Israel,"
a senior military source said, "we decided
to separate the two and to prevent the
kind of disturbances that could create
large-scale public disorder."
Israel Radio quoted a security source as
saying, "We're taking the possibility of vi
olence and demonstrations very seriously,
and we intend to ensure that the game
will not be one-sided, or dictated by rioters
and troublemakers."
