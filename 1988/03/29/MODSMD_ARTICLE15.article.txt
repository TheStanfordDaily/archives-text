### 
PANAMA CITY — Troops and
plainclothes agents under the com
mand of Gen. Manuel Noriega, staging
a surprise raid yesterday on a major
hotel, arrested about a dozen leaders
and members of the anti-Noriega Civic
Crusade and detained several jour
nalists working for U.S. news organ
izations.
After blocking the entrance to the
Marriott Cesar Park Hotel, troops in
white police vans escorted at least four
crusade members to the vehicles and
beat them with rubber truncheons,
witnesses said.
Later, they cut telephone communi
cations from the luxury hotel on the
city's waterfront, where the crusade
maintains an information office and
where dozens of foreign journalists
have stayed during the recent political
crisis.
Only hours before the raid, riot
police broke up a crusade demonstra

tion in downtown Panama City by
throwing tear gas at the protesters
and firing birdshot into the air.
Among those seized at the hotel
were Roberto Aleman, Alberto Aleman
and Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, all
prominent leaders of the Crusade, a
coalition of some 200 business and
trade organizations that has spear
headed opposition to Noriega during
the past nine months. Crusade mem
bers have led an eight-day strike that
has shut most industry and commerce
in Panama City.
As the soldiers and agents stormed
the hotel lobby at sundown, panicked
guests were ordered upstairs to their
rooms.
Several Crusade members were re
ported to be in hiding on various floors
of the 15-story Marriott. Meanwhile,
according to hotel personnel,
plainclothes agents requested the
master key to search through rooms

of reporters.
The raid marked the first apparent
roundup of crusade members this year.
Police occasionally arrest and some
times exile members, although many
of them had returned to Panama in
recent months.
In the government-owned newspa
per yesterday, an anonymous editorial
warned that under the law, anyone
who took the part of a foreign state
in trying to threaten the independence
of Panama "will be punished with 15
to 20 years in prison."
The earlier demonstration began
peacefully in front of Don Bosco
Church, near the center of Panama
City's main shopping neighborhood.
As three truckloads of troops watched
passively, about 2,500 demonstrators
marched towards Central Avenue, a
major commercial area, waving white
handkerchiefs and shouting "Down
with Pineapple Face" — a derogatory

nickname given Noriega, who suffers
from acne-scarred skin, by his foes.
As the march began to wind along
Central Avenue, riot troops, usually
called "dobermans," tossed tear gas
canisters and dispersed the marchers.
They regrouped a few blocks away but
were routed again as the police charged
them behind hand-held shields and
threw more tear gas.
For a while, it appeared that the
march might go without incident, and
at the beginning an officer in charge
of the troops assured the demonstra
tors, "We're all Panamanians. I want
to tell you in the name of the Panama
Defense Forces (which Noriega heads)
that we do not want to fight Panama
nians. These weapons are to defend
the country against our own people."
Twenty minutes later, the tear gassing
began.
