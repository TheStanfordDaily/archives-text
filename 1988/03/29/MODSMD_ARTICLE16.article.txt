# Jackson plays down front-runner status
## 
### 
HARTFORD, Conn. - The
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who yes
terday narrowly passed Massa
chusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
in the delegate tally maintained
by the Associated Press, tried
to minimize his front-runner
status and his chances for vic
tory in today's Connecticut pri
mary.
After a day and a half of
campaigning in Connecticut,
Jackson called Dukakis, whom
he beat by 2-1 in Michigan,
"the front-runner" for the
nomination. "He's got the most
money, the most technology.
I'm just plugging along."
And Connecticut, next door
to Massachusetts, is "a
favorite-son state" for Dukakis,
he noted.
But despite his efforts to
downplay his success, Jackson
in recent days has begun to
talk more in his speeches about
what he will do when he gets
to the White House, rather
than what direction the coun
try ought to go.
To his standard stump
speech last night in Hartford,
Jackson added a new line: "I
cannot wait to beat George
Bush in November."
As Jackson campaigned here,
reporters repeatedly asked
whether, if he were to have the
most delegates and votes after
the primary season, the party
might still try to block his nom
ination, fearing that Jackson's
race and lack of government

experience made him unelec
table.
"If by the end of California
we have the most popular
votes, the most delegate votes,
becoming the nominee is logical
and proper. If I win the nom
ination from the people, I ex
pect the party to embrace me,
and to embrace those prin
ciples," Jackson said in an ap
pearance on ABC's "Good
Morning America."
"I'm using old math," Jack
son said. "The most votes, the
most delegates equals the nom
ination. I'm not familiar with
any other way of counting."
fie seemed a bit tired yes
terday, and the response to his
speeches was less electrifying
than in Michigan. But his
crowds are still larger than
other candidates.
