# Gephardt drops out of race

### 
WASHINGTON - Richard Gephardt,
the candidate who found a resonant mes
sage but never enough money, officially
withdrew from the Democratic presidential
race yesterday, after a string of devastating
losses in both the North and the South all
but bankrupted his campaign just seven
weeks after his victory in lowa had thrust
him into front-runner status.
The 47-year-old Missouri congressman,
currently the fourth-highest ranking Dem
ocrat in the House of Representatives, said
that he now plans to seek re-election to
his House seat from St. Louis. His with
drawal, coming just one day before the
filing deadline for congressional races in
Missouri, means that both House members
who ran for the presidency this year —
Gephardt and Republican Jack Kemp of
New York — have now been forced out.
At an emotional press conference here
attended by more than 100 supporters and
campaign aides, Gephardt, who began his
marathon campaign in lowa in 1985, bowed
out gracefully and with a touch of humor.
He said he had "no alibis," explaining that
he lost because "I didn't get enough votes.
"It's been said that the opera isn't over
until the fat lady sings," Gephardt said.
"Last Saturday in Michigan, 1 think I heard
her walking to the microphone."
Gephardt's decision followed by two days
his relatively weak third-place showing in
the Michigan caucuses last Saturday, where
he had hoped to revive his lagging campaign
with a tough trade message that seemed
tailor made for the depressed auto state.
But his campaign — already badly battered
by his massive losses on "Super Tuesday"
— was overwhelmed by the Jesse Jackson
landslide in Michigan. That forced Gep
hardt to make a difficult decision —
whether to continue a long-shot presiden
tial bid or make a safe run for the con
gressional seat he has held for more than
a decade.
Gephardt's pull-out, the first by a major
Democratic contender since the primary

season began, narrows the still crowded
Democratic field, but may do little to clarify
the party's confused nomination process.
Gephardt said that he would not attempt
to hold together a block of delegates to the
party's convention in Atlanta, and stressed
that the delegates currently committed to
him — 154 by the campaign's count —
are now free to switch to other candidates
if they like. While he said he "reserves the
right" to endorse another candidate later,
he said he has no current plans to throw
his support behind anyone else. He added
that he doesn't expect to be offered the
vice presidential slot on the Democratic
ticket.
Some observers had expected Gephardt
to suspend his campaign rather than offi
cially end it — in order to hold onto his
delegates and remain a factor at the con
vention. But he made a clean break instead.
"I'm ending my candidacy today," Gep
hardt said. "Under the rules, they (his
delegates) all can do what they want when
they get to the convention."
