# Chinese national congress sees glimmer of debate
## 
### 
BEIJING - The 2,970 delegates to
the National People's Congress had
just endorsed a list of names for a
legislative committee Monday when a
stir swept through the Great Hall of
the People.
The list had been approved with a
sea of raised hands, and no one had
voted against it. Hut now, a lone del
egate had raised her hand to register
an abstention. Heads turned, and tele
vision crews raced through the aisles
to record the incident.
A few minutes later, before a vote
on the membership of another com
mittee, a second delegate stepped to a
microphone and took China's vaunted
new openness and "socialist democra
cy" a step further.
For the next half hour, a glimmer
of something resembling parliamen

tary democracy illuminated China's
largely rubber-stamp legislature. And
for the first time in the body's history,
dissenting views were argued in the
direct glare of international media cov
erage.
Addressing the assembled delegates,
Huang Shunxing, a former legislator
in Taiwan who defected to Beijing
three years ago, sharply criticized the
nomination of 89-year-old Zhou Gu«
cheng as head of the Committee on
Education, Science, Culture and
Public Health.
"In order to further carry out the
policy of cadre rejuvenation, to let
younger cadres replace the aged and
to let 89-year-olds like Mr. Zhou in
the older generation have more oppor
tunities to rest," Huang said, provok

ing a ripple of laughter. "I propose we
select someone else."
Huang won considerable applause.
Hut the vote to approve the list headed
by Zhou was overwhelming — nearly
2,900 to 8, with 69 abstentions.
Three other delegates, two from
Zhejiang province and one from
Heilongjiang province, also expressed
criticism of the membership of various
committees. Nonetheless, all the lists
were approved by overwhelming mar
gins.
Liu Yiu-chu of the Guangdong prov
ince delegation, whose First abstention
had created such a stir, continued to
abstain on all seven committee lists
presented in the course of the day.
The Hong Kong lawyer told reporters
afterward that she took her stand be

cause delegates were not told how the
names were chosen.
The official New China News
Agency, with what appeared to be a
touch of pride, reported that "for the
first time in the history of the National
People's Congress, not a single one of
the NPC's seven committees was
elected unanimously."
Dissenting views expressed by Na
tional People's Congress delegates, es
pecially at small group discussion ses
sions, have been reported in previous
years in the state-controlled Chinese
press. But according to veteran cor
respondents here, yesterday marked
the first time that microphones were
set up for delegates to air their views
at sessions attended by foreign jour
nalists.
