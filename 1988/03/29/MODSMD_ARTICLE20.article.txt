## Farm politicking 
### 
IN scrutinizing this spring's
ASSU elections, many students
are not sure who to trust for
candidate recommendations be
cause emerging parties, under a
blanket of political rhetoric, are
inaccurately defining their roles in
the endorsement process.
The People's Platform, a coali
tion of students from ethnic mi
nority and progressive student
communities, drew fire recently for
what was misperceived as an illegal
endorsement process. Its opposi
tion, which claims it will "objec
tively" review all candidates in an
election guide, is the new Student
Election Review for Voter Educa
tion.
In its three-year lifetime, the
Platform has advocated the inter
ests of minority students by en
dorsing ASSU candidates who sup
ported the Platform agenda. The
criticism of this year's "endorse
ment" process was unwarranted
because the group — as it actively
admits — was actually nominating
candidates and not endorsing
them.
However, if students had
realized that the Platform is a self
sufficient party, charges of surrep
titious politicking would never
have surfaced. Those challenges
forced the Platform to its present
public definition as a political
party.
The gap between student aware
ness and ASSU politics is a grave
problem, and the Platform has a
responsibility to students to be
clear in its intentions.
The same duty is required of
SERVE, formed by Council of
Presidents member Jim Durkin,
senator Chris Adamson and junior
Cindy Wurtenberg to supposedly
"further educate students about
election issues." While the Plat
form was misunderstood partially
as a result of growing pains, this
group has usurped political bunk

to hide its own ambitions.
SERVE considers itself "politi
cally non-partisan." However,
Durkin and Adamson represent a
very pronounced conservative wing
of the ASSU Senate. The group
plans to temper its individual
biases by involving seven other
board members, who cannot be
part "of any group seeking a special
fee, endorsing candidates, slates,
or special fees; or a candidate for
an elected office."
If SERVE creators follow this
plan, the requirement systemati
cally excludes the large percentage
of students active in minority, gay
and lesbian organizations and the
other 25 diverse groups that are
seeking fee assessments.
The students in those groups are
the ones actively tied to current
issues and would be likely to pro
vide a perspective contrasting to
Durkin, Adamson and Wurten
berg. Without them, the SERVE
board members will be proponents
of a homogeneous political view.
Objectivity is not the product of
weeding out politically opinionated
people, but of balancing a collection
of perspectives.
In addition, one of Durkin's COP
colleagues is running again for the
office, yet Durkin seems to feel
that connection will not interfere
with "objective" assesssment of
candidates.
Durkin, Adamson and Wurten
berg have assumed that they are
able to control their biases while
others cannot.
The ability of SERVE to retain
an objective view in examining
ASSU candidates is dubious.
The questioning of Platform pol
icies showed the party the impor
tance of a clearly defined public
role. If SERVE hopes to share in
any of the success the Platform
has had in placing its members in
office, it better own up to an honest
image.
