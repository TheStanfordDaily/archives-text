## Nurses' contract doesn't alter working conditions 
### 
STANFORD HOSPITAL, which
prides itself on leading the nation
in health care practices, recently
lost a tremendous opportunity to
resolve some of the critical problems
facing the nursing profession today.
The administration took a very
adversarial role in their dealing with
the nurses union over contract issues.
The hospital was unwilling to explore
the conflicts that are causing nurses to
leave their profession in unprecedented
numbers.
Nationwide there is a growing criti
cal shortage of nurses, and Stanford
has not been able to fill its available
positions. R.N. Magazine revealed in a
survey that over 70 percent of nurses
would not recommend nursing as a
career. The question is why not?
At the hospital, with the new con-

tract, a beginning staff nurse's salary
is $14.57 per hour.
Most nurses hired are required to
work alternative night shifts, with
some units demanding a rotation every
two weeks. The hospital refused to
consider raising the night pay differen
tial, even though by doing so many
nurses might be attracted to work
nights. Weekend work offers no in
crease in hourly wage.
In addition, many nurses are ex
pected to be "on call," which means
they are tied to a telephone for hours.
For this, they receive one quarter of
their hourly wage.
Mandatory overtime, often a double
shift, is expected of nurses on critical
care units. How can acutely ill patients
receive optimal care from nurses ex
hausted by repeated overtime de
mands?

In addition, the hospital attemped to
restrict and deny benefits to the very
effective relief-nurse program, which is
composed of over 300 qualified nurses.
This program supports the regular
staff and alleviates the need to seek
the inconsistent "come and go" registry
nurses (who are temporarily employed
registered nurses).
The hospital prides itself on its
highly skilled and educated nurses but
refused to increase the annual educa
tional allotment. All nurses are re
quired by state law to take continuing
education courses. Stanford demands
degrees for supervisory advancement
but rejects economic support of that
requirement.
Incredibly, the administration de
mands a demotion in salary and pro
fessional status when a nurse decides

to transfer to another speciality within
the hospital.
Overall, nurses are caring, support
ive, hard-working members of the
health team. Stanford continues to say
they value their staff but betrays them
at the bargaining table. The hospital
fiercely resists any attempts to accept
nurses' realistic solutions for improve
ment in their negative working condi
tions.
Sometime in the near future, the
hospital will no longer be able to say
"we have no more money," as they
continue to build and expand. Stanford
Hospital will eventually pay the price
for their failure to here and now come
to grasp with the nursing crisis. The
problem will not just go away.
