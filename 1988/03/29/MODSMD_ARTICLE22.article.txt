# Kennedy decision not due to pressure
## 
### 
The following sentence appeared as
the lead of a March 4 front-page story:
"Bowing to months of pressure from
outraged faculty and students, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy agreed
yesterday to rescind Stanford's policy
of subsidizing memberships for some
faculty and staff in social clubs, includ
ing the exclusive all-male Bohemian
Club."
Now, that sounds like a mighty ex
citing episode in my life. Since no
Daily reporter ever asked me what
kind of "pressures" I experienced, and
since the story specified none, your
readers might be enlightened by the
following list:
• One thoughtful letter signed by 63
women on the Stanford faculty;

• Another, from a group in Santa
Clara County;
• Two questions at a meeting of the
ASSU Senate and one at a meeting of
the Senate of the Academic Council;
• One or two questions on a KZSU
news conference, in which I explained
the rationale underlying the then
existing policy.
That's about it; no spontaneous mail
from individual students or faculty
members, no raising of the subject in a
number of meetings with students in
dormitories, no referenda, protest
meetings, petitions, forums or even
angry denunciations at dinner tables.
Pressure-wise, I would have to call it
fairly relaxed as these things go.
Why bring this up? Surely not to try
to quench The Daily's thirst for hyper
bole, which is probably unquenchable.
There is a different reason: Just this
one time, I'd like to get credit for
doing something because it was the
right thing to do and not because

some form of coercion made me do it.
I promise I won't ask again for a
whole year.
