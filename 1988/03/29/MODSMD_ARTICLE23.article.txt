# Ban on smoking reveals hypocrisy
## 
### 
I have been an ardent rooter for the
Red and White of Stanford during the
baseball, football and basketball
seasons for many a year, but whether
I remain a loyal fan depends on the
various rules and regulations instituted
by a hypocritical, so-called intellectual
group.
There are now "No Smoking" signs
throughout the stands of Sunken Dia
mond, but "No Alcoholic Beverage"
signs are nowhere to be seen. Unknow
ingly, before noticing the "No
Smoking" signs, I lit up a cigarette.

A security officer came down and
advised me of the new rules, and I
abided by his request.
I'm certain, that my smoking in the
outdoors doesn't contribute to condi
tions in our air, that carbons emitted
from automobiles do, yet some "intel
lectuals" (who usually have two and
three cars in their garages) feel they
have the right to dictate their concerns
with snide remarks and hypocritical
actions.
Smoking is permitted at tailgate
parties on campus, but why? It's still
the same old air. Liquor and carbon
monoxides are just as deadly, if not
more, than cigarettes.
It won't be the cigarette air that
kills me, it'll be the carbon monoxide
that comes out of two-car garages or
the liquor the drivers have absorbed
while driving the streets and highways
in a (socially accepted) condition.
