## Reagan's new scheme 
### 
RECENT EVENTS in Nicaragua
have been nothing short of
miraculous. The Nicaraguan gov
ernment and the Contra rebel forces have
negotiated an agreement on their own,
and finally, that tortured region can ex
pect a period of peace.
In fact, so spectacular is the advent of
peace in that region that it has all but
eclipsed the recent goings-on next door.
The short-lived incident in which Presi
dent Reagan dispatched over 3,000 U.S.
troops to Honduras is already fading from
memory.
Since our troops should already be on
their way home today, speculation on
Reagan's purpose in sending them to
Honduras in the first place may seem a
bit obsolete (i.e. What does it matter why
they were there as long as they are back
without starting trouble?).
But before we rest our national con
science with the thought that our troops
did no damage, consider this possibility:
The Contra position could have been
materially and illegally strengthened by
the Reagan administration during the
last two weeks. That is why Reagan's
reasons for deploying troops in Honduras
should be carefully scrutinized.
Ostensibly, Reagan sent U.S. troops
into Honduras to demonstrate our po
tential strength in that region to the
world. More specifically, it was a thinly
veiled threat to the Sandinistas who were
then conducting an offensive seige
against the Contras within the Honduran
border.
In the immediate aftermath of the
President's announcent of his decision

to deploy addition militaiy forces, reac
tions were sharp. Congressmen accused
the administration of attempting to
provoke a Sandinista attack on U.S.
troops so America would have an excuse
to join the fighting, hinting at an analogy
to the Gulf of Tonkin incident that al
lowed increased U.S. involvement in Viet
nam.
It soon became apparent that this bel
licose evaluation of the President's in
tentions was a bit unrealistic. Our troops
remained miles from hostilities and were
unequipped (they carried "light arma
ments" only) to tangle with enemy forces.
Besides what ever political opinion one
has of Daniel Ortega, even his opponents
would not believe him stupid enough to
attack the U.S. military directly, espe
cially now when his country is at a critical
juncture in its history.
However, due to this administration's
past deceitful dealings in Nicaragua, as
epitomized by the Iran-Contra scandal,
congressional suspicions remained
aroused.
Some legislators argued that deploying
additional troops was a public relations
maneuver by the White House to pres
sure Congress to reconsider its position
on aiding the Contras; the implied threat
was that if the United States didn't help
the Contras stop the Sandinistas, even
tually American boys would have to take
up the fight against communism.
Though this is a viable explanation,
it's not sufficent. Administration officials
may have hoped to score a public rela
tions coup that would sway lawmakers,
but it probably wasn't the White House's

main goal.
Congressmen who had voted against
aid to the rebel forces were well aware
that the consequence of their decision
probably would be the demise of the Con
tras. Its actuality wasn't likely to scare
them into switching positions.
The admistration's intention for "Op
eration Golden Pheasant" was much
more subtle and illegal. The main goal
in sending our troops to Honduras was
probably to surrepitiously replenish Con
tra military supplies.
As the Los Angeles Times reported last
Saturday, allegations have been made
that materials sent down with U.S. troops
were targeted to be diverted to the des
perate rebels. Though investigators have
no direct evidence to prove this theory,
congressional suspicions are serious
enough that they sent auditors to mon
itor the troop withdrawal process and to
keep track of inventory.
Unfortunately, the auditors arrived
much later then the supplies did, and
while they may be able to count what
comes back to the United States, they
will have to take the Pentagon's word
for what supplies went to Honduras.
In other words, Reagan's done it again.
