## Bug holds beauty pageant for major with manliest men 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
I am often asked why, as a guy,
I find it so difficult to ask women
out on dates. Well here's one good
reason: In the March 2 Bug Me
column I asked Debi Thomas out
on a date, saying "Debi, I've pen
ciled you in to see 'Action Jack
son' with me a week from Friday."
Last week, in a clear rejection of
my advances, Debi married some
body else. This is why I do not
ask women out on dates.

Dear Bug Me,
Since I am paying to send you
through college, may 1 take ad
vantage of your expertise to resolve
a debate with a friend ? She claims
truffles (the chocolate kind) con
tain real truffles (the kind pigs
dig up). I am skeptical. Please
reply. I'll do anything to get a
letter from you.
— Love, Mom
Thanks, Mom. If you'll really
do anything to get a letter from
me, I'd appreciate it if you'd send
a 1988 Porsche or the equivalent
to Bug Me, The Stanford Daily,
Storke Bldg., Stanford, CA 94305.
Or to Bug Me (not B.Bug-Me) at
the tragedies on LOTS. (You can

send your Bug Me questions
there, too.)
Now I know I promised not to
say anything mean about your
friend who thinks chocolate
truffles contain wild truffles, so
instead of saying that your friend
is pretty stupid, I will say that
he/she is "mistaken."
The plant truffle is an edible
subterranean fungus (genus
Tuber, order Tuberales, class As
comycetes, division Mycota, flavor
Grody) that ranges in size from
that of a pea to that of an orange.
They are found in temperate
regions, as are my grandparents.
Instead of growing on bathroom
walls or feet like normal fungi,
truffles occur in the ground at
depths up to 12 inches. This
makes them difficult to detect
without the use of specially
developed high-tech devices
known as "pigs." Pigs, because of
their innate nasal ability and
hankering for truffles, are able to
detect the famous fungus when
trained by a professional truf
fologist.
The most valued truffle in
French cooking is the Perigord
(T. Melanosporum). The Perigord
is brown or black, rounded and
covered with polygonal warts.
By contrast, the chocolate
truffle is brown or black, rounded
and covered with polygonal
sprinkles.
Chocolate truffles are usually
made of a foundant to which choc
olate liquor or cocoa is added.
Foundant is a substance made by
mechanically beating a solution
supersaturated with sugar. An
opaque, white, smooth paste
results, which can be melted,
flavored, colored or eaten straight
off the beaters.
The important thing to note
here is that chocolate truffles con
tain absolutely no fungus truffles.
If they did, every See's Candy

Store in the country would be
overrun by fungus-hungiy pigs,
and the world would be thrown
into chaos. A sobering thought, I
know.
Dear Bug Me,
Which major has the cutest
guys?
— Wanda
Do I look like an expert on cute
guys?
According to my special corre
spondent on cute guys, the most
important aspect is the Geek-To-
Hunk ratio, which mathemati
cally can be written as Geek
/Hunk. So, for instance, Econom
ics has the most guys; perhaps,
looking at raw numbers, the most
cute guys. But taking into account
the fact that Econ also has a lot
of geeks, we see that the
Geek/Hunk ratio is probably
about even.
Got it? Let's try a practical ap
plication of the Geek/Hunk ratio
to see if you understand.
Problem #1: Andrew and Joe
are Linguistics msuors. If we know
that the Geek/Hunk ratio of Lin
guistics is 1.00, what would be
the distribution of geeks and
hunks among these two guys?
Solution: Since the Geek/Hunk
ratio is 1.00, and we know as a
given fact that Andrew is a hunk,
then by simple division we know
that Joe must be a geek.
There, I told you it was simple.
There are some majors that
have only one guy. Depending on
that guy's hunkiness or geekiness
the Geek/Hunk ratio is either zero
or infinity. Another variable is
guys with Individually Designed
Majors, although one girl I know
claims that she "would never date
somebody who is individually de
signed!"
A scientific sampling of Stan
ford women (I asked three women

standing near me) elicited the fol
lowing responses:
"I don't know any cute guys."
"Cute guys don't have majors—
they're all athletes."
"Electrical Engineering. . . .
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)."
Since I have no actual answer,
send your nominations for The
Major With The Cutest Guys to
me at The Daily or over LOTS.
I'll tally 'em up and give a com
plete report in a few weeks.
Dear Bug Me,
Is pop singer Debbie Gibson a
virgin ?
— Brain Withheld
To fill you all in on the details
here, Debbie Gibson is the 17-

year-old blond pop singer who
netted two top-five singles this
year off of her debut gold album
"Out of the Blue."
Debbie should not be confused
with Tiffany, the 16-year-old pop
singer who, overcoming the severe
handicap of being born without a
last name, reached the top of the
pop charts with a series of annoy
ing remakes of old songs.
Actually, Tiffany does have a
last name: Darwisch. Tiffany Dar
wisch. I would recommend that
she marry somebody who has a
more pleasant sounding last
name, such as Sting.
But as you can see I am avoid
ing the question, because if you
retdly wanted to know about Tif
fany you would have asked a ques

tion such as "Is Tiffany a ver
min?"
According to this month's Spin
magazine Debbie Gibson "does
not believe in premarital sex."
This presumably means that
when she is done having sex she
turns to her partner and says"I
don't believe it."
This same article goes on to say
that she wrote "Shake Your Love"
and "Only In My Dreams" before
she ever went out with a boy.
It's pretty clear that I have ab
solutely no idea whether Debbie
Gibson is a virgin or not. All we
have to go on is that stupid article
in Spin magazine.

Bug Me appears every Tuesday
with answers to readers' pressing
questions.
