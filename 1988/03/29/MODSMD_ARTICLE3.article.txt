# Drell, Gorbachev meet in Moscow

In a meeting he said was filled with
"optimism but not illusion," Prof. Sid
ney Drell and several U.S. senators and
scholars discussed U.S.-Soviet relations
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
earlier this month in Moscow.
Drell called the March 11 meeting
"strictly educational." Its purpose was
to help both countries "better under
stand and gauge (their) thinking" on
"significant issues that are coming up,"
he said.
The U.S. group was not there to
negotiate, Drell said, but rather to dis
cuss and explore pertinent topics and
sensitive areas of the superpower rela
tionship.
The senators who participated were
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo.; Sam Nunn, I)-Ga.; William

Cohen, R-Me.; and Carl Levin, D-Mich.
Drell, who is co-director of the Center
for International Security and Arms
Control, said he was not aware of any
such previous meeting. Its occurence
indicates a "mutual appreciation of the
fact that it is to everyone's benefit to
have a normalized relationship."
The meeting came just after Secretary
of State George Shultz's visit to Moscow
to set a date for a summit there between
President Reagan and Gorbachev in
May.
That summit will be held regardless
of progress in current negotiations
toward a strategic arms reduction treaty
(START). Drell said there will be "many
things to talk about" at the summit.
But he noted that the Soviets are
"applying new thinking" in the field of
arms control. In variance from their
previous strategy of massive stockpiling
of both conventional and nuclear arms,

they have shifted to a posture they call
"defensive sufficiency."
This indicates progress, Drell said,
but also raises questions of "how one
translates this into operational ways of
reducing each side's concern of a
surprise attack."
Soviet leadership, in his estimation,
is seriously pursuing arms control in
order to concentrate on "a serious effort
of economic restructuring . .. and to
reduce the risk of conflict."
He said he is pleased with the recent
treaty on intermediate-range nuclear
forces (INF), increased U.S.-Soviet
dialogue and the prospects for the May
summit and a START agreement. "If
we are beginning n process, that's good
news."
A START agreement, which would
halve present stockpiles of offensive nu-
