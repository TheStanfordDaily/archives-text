# Drell, Gorbachev meet in Moscow
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
In a meeting he said was filled with
"optimism but not illusion," Prof. Sid
ney Drell and several U.S. senators and
scholars discussed U.S.-Soviet relations
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
earlier this month in Moscow.
Drell called the March 11 meeting
"strictly educational." Its purpose was
to help both countries "better under
stand and gauge (their) thinking" on
"significant issues that are coming up,"
he said.
The U.S. group was not there to
negotiate, Drell said, but rather to dis
cuss and explore pertinent topics and
sensitive areas of the superpower rela
tionship.
The senators who participated were
Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo.; Sam Nunn, I)-Ga.; William

Cohen, R-Me.; and Carl Levin, D-Mich.
Drell, who is co-director of the Center
for International Security and Arms
Control, said he was not aware of any
such previous meeting. Its occurence
indicates a "mutual appreciation of the
fact that it is to everyone's benefit to
have a normalized relationship."
The meeting came just after Secretary
of State George Shultz's visit to Moscow
to set a date for a summit there between
President Reagan and Gorbachev in
May.
That summit will be held regardless
of progress in current negotiations
toward a strategic arms reduction treaty
(START). Drell said there will be "many
things to talk about" at the summit.
But he noted that the Soviets are
"applying new thinking" in the field of
arms control. In variance from their
previous strategy of massive stockpiling
of both conventional and nuclear arms,

they have shifted to a posture they call
"defensive sufficiency."
This indicates progress, Drell said,
but also raises questions of "how one
translates this into operational ways of
reducing each side's concern of a
surprise attack."
Soviet leadership, in his estimation,
is seriously pursuing arms control in
order to concentrate on "a serious effort
of economic restructuring . .. and to
reduce the risk of conflict."
He said he is pleased with the recent
treaty on intermediate-range nuclear
forces (INF), increased U.S.-Soviet
dialogue and the prospects for the May
summit and a START agreement. "If
we are beginning n process, that's good
news."
A START agreement, which would
halve present stockpiles of offensive nu-
clear missiles, would be a "msyor,
msgor achievement," Drell said.
But he said he "will not bet more
than a nickel" that a treaty will
be ready by the summit.
Part of Drell's reluctance is due
to the ambiguity of the com
munique — the document outlin
ing topics to be discussed at the
summit and signed by Shultz and
Soviet Foreign Minister Edouard
Shevardnadze.
According to Drell, interpreta
tion of the communique is crucial
because it is ambiguous about
what countries are allowed to do
in research and testing for defen
sive systems while still honoring
the 1972 anti-ballistic missile
(ABM) treaty.
Drell suggested that a "suitably

ambiguous" agreement between
Reagan and Gorbachev could be
reached by the end of the year.
This might allow the United
States to maintain the Strategic
Defense Initiative as well as
satisfy the Soviets with the pre
servation of the ABM treaty.
A "tremendously important
first step" toward the treaty, he
noted, would be implementing
confidence-building measures
such as force repositioning and
exchanging observers at each
others' mobilization areas.
But in Drell's opinion, the
Reagan administration is not
rushing into signing a START
treaty. "Any treaty must stand
up to tough criticism," he said,
noting that any treaty signed by
President Reagan still needs Sen
ate approval.
"I would like to think in 1988
that one is seeing the re
emergence of a bipartisan foreign

According to Drell,

facts.'

policy" in the area of arms con
trol, Drell said. The issues are "so
crucial they must be developed
with bipartisan support, which
has been lost for the past decade."
There has been a "major
change" in the Soviet attitude
since Gorbachev's rise to power,
Drell noted. In talking with his
Soviet colleagues — including dis
sident physicist Andrei Sakharov
— Drell said he detected a new
element of hope in the Soviet Un

ion.
Difficult questions of verifica
tion (confirmation of each coun
try's actions) are also impeding
an agreement on deep cuts in stra
tegic arms, according to Drell.
Verification is particularly
troublesome with cruise missiles
and mobile intercontinental bal
listic missiles. Compliance with
numerical limits on these weap
ons will be hard to confirm.
Drell said improving super
power relations is "a question of
progress in reducing the sources
of insecurity." It is not a matter
of directly linking progress in
arms control negotiation with ad
vances in other areas of tension,
such as Afghanistan, human
rights and religious freedom. In
stead, he said the atmosphere of
negotiations improves when the
general atmosphere of other ele
ments of the relationship im
prove.
