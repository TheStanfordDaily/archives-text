# Students stay with homeless, face poverty's reality
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Although there is not enough
shelter for all the nation's home
less, most Stanford students are
too sheltered, according to 15 un
dergraduates who participated in
a six-day homeless outreach proj
ect over spring break.
Through a student leadership
project sponsored by the Public
Service Center, students visited
six different centers for the home
less in the Bay Area, offering to
scrub walls, dig irrigation ditches,
distribute food and lend a hand
wherever one was needed.
But the students did more than
just manual labor; they also lived
in a Santa Clara homeless center
for two nights, getting a frighten
ing glimpse of poverty.

"There is no way for students
to know the problem until they
are actually there. We typically
view homeless people as bums.
But the percentage (of the people
we met) aren't like that," said
freshman James Rucker, a par
ticipant in the project.
Participants discovered that
several of the homeless people
once had six-figure jobs, doc
torates or even Stanford degrees.
They were "thrust into the situ
ation" after just one hard break,
according to freshman Leila Wice.
Besides learning that many of
the homeless had once been sur
prisingly well-established, stu
dents said they also saw that the
only way for some people to sur
vive is by cheating the govern
ment.
"With the standing system, the

only way they (some of the poor)
can make it is to cheat," said
Rucker, who heard this philoso
phy again and again from public
service workers.
For two nights students slept
at the Family Living Center in
Santa Clara, a center that pro
vides 30-day housing for families.
Supporting up to 35 families at
a time, the center aims to help
families find jobs and "real"
homes during their month-long
stay.
A father and his three children
lived in a room no larger than a
Lagunita dorm room, hoping to
re-establish themselves before
they left the center.
According to Wice, "Eighty per
cent (of the families) end up
having jobs and houses when they
leave."

Junior Melissa Pashigian de
scribed student efforts to help the
families: "We scrubbed up ... the
outside of the place and washed
all of the walls. We cleaned up
their living room.
"Keep in mind that 35 families
were living there so it was really
dirty," added Pashigian, the proj
ect's organizer.
Although the clean-up project
itself was worthwhile, Wice said
students learned the most by ac
tually living at the center and
presenting themselves "one on
one as people."
Shelter Coordinator Barbara
Whatley praised the students be
cause they were the first volun
teers to spend the night at the
center.
The families "were very excited
that someone actually came and
spent the night and put in so
much love," she said.
In the morning, families would
wake up stunned to find the stu
dents still there.
We were more than just "the
girl scouts," coming for an after
noon of cheer and then leaving,
freshman Robert Jamieson said.
He said the Stanford students, by
contrast, want to make a perma
nent commitment by trying to "go
back."
Whatley would surely welcome
the students back with open arms.
"We heard nothing but rave
reviews for the students," she
said.
Despite the positive feedback,
Pashigian said the project would
be "a selfish waste" if the partic
ipants return to Stanford and "do
nothing." According to Pashigian,
it is now the group's responsibility
to make students here realize how
dire the country's homeless prob
lem is.
"We are the connection" be
tween Stanford and the realities
beyond campus life, she said.
It seems that the group has
already made an impact. Accord
ing to Catherine Milton, director
of the Public Service Center, a
local foundation plans to establish

a $1 million fund for the homeless
and wants to meet with students
for insights on where the money
should go.
Within the next few weeks the
students will also organize slide
shows and dorm talks in hopes
of educating their peers.
In addition, the Stanford Vol
unteer Network is sponsoring a
homeless awareness project begin
ning April 5. The week-long proj

ect will include the construction
of a shack in White Plaza to sym
bolize the plight of the poor and
workshops on the homeless youth
and the mentally ill.
Looking back on the spring
break project, Wice said, "washing
a couple walls does not compare
to the experiences we gained. We
were educating ourselves. . . .
Now we have got to talk to other
people."

view homeless people as bums.
But the percentage (of the people
we met) aren't like that," said
freshman James Rucker, a par
ticipant in the project.
Participants discovered that
several of the homeless people
once had six-figure jobs, doc
torates or even Stanford degrees.
They were "thrust into the situ
ation" after just one hard break,
according to freshman Leila Wice.
Besides learning that many of
the homeless had once been sur
prisingly well-established, stu
dents said they also saw that the
only way for some people to sur
vive is by cheating the govern
ment.
"With the standing system, the

only way they (some of the poor)
can make it is to cheat," said
Rucker, who heard this philoso
phy again and again from public
service workers.
For two nights students slept
at the Family Living Center in
Santa Clara, a center that pro
vides 30-day housing for families.
Supporting up to 35 families at
a time, the center aims to help
families find jobs and "real"
homes during their month-long
stay.
A father and his three children
lived in a room no larger than a
Lagunita dorm room, hoping to
re-establish themselves before
they left the center.
According to Wice, "Eighty per
cent (of the families) end up
having jobs and houses when they
leave."

Junior Melissa Pashigian de
scribed student efforts to help the
families: "We scrubbed up ... the
outside of the place and washed
all of the walls. We cleaned up
their living room.
"Keep in mind that 35 families
were living there so it was really
dirty," added Pashigian, the proj
ect's organizer.
Although the clean-up project
itself was worthwhile, Wice said
students learned the most by ac
tually living at the center and
presenting themselves "one on
one as people."

Whatley praised the students be
cause they were the first volun
teers to spend the night at the
center.
The families "were very excited
that someone actually came and
spent the night and put in so
much love," she said.
In the morning, families would
wake up stunned to find the stu
dents still there.
We were more than just "the
girl scouts," coming for an after
noon of cheer and then leaving,
freshman Robert Jamieson said.
He said the Stanford students, by
contrast, want to make a perma
nent commitment by trying to "go
back."
Whatley would surely welcome
the students back with open arms.
"We heard nothing but rave
reviews for the students," she
said.
Despite the positive feedback,
Pashigian said the project would
be "a selfish waste" if the partic
ipants return to Stanford and "do
nothing." According to Pashigian,
it is now the group's responsibility
to make students here realize how
dire the country's homeless prob
lem is.
"We are the connection" be
tween Stanford and the realities
beyond campus life, she said.
It seems that the group has
already made an impact. Accord
ing to Catherine Milton, director
of the Public Service Center, a
local foundation plans to establish

a $1 million fund for the homeless
and wants to meet with students
for insights on where the money
should go.
Within the next few weeks the
students will also organize slide
shows and dorm talks in hopes
of educating their peers.
In addition, the Stanford Vol
unteer Network is sponsoring a
homeless awareness project begin
ning April 5. The week-long proj

ect will include the construction
of a shack in White Plaza to sym
bolize the plight of the poor and
workshops on the homeless youth
and the mentally ill.
Looking back on the spring
break project, Wice said, "washing
a couple walls does not compare
to the experiences we gained. We
were educating ourselves. . . .
Now we have got to talk to other
people."

Although there is not enough
shelter for all the nation's home
less, most Stanford students are
too sheltered, according to 15 un
dergraduates who participated in
a six-day homeless outreach proj
ect over spring break.
Through a student leadership
project sponsored by the Public
Service Center, students visited
six different centers for the home
less in the Bay Area, offering to
scrub walls, dig irrigation ditches,
distribute food and lend a hand
wherever one was needed.
But the students did more than
just manual labor; they also lived
in a Santa Clara homeless center
for two nights, getting a frighten
ing glimpse of poverty.

"There is no way for students
to know the problem until they
are actually there. We typically
view homeless people as bums.
