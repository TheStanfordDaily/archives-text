## Card rolls 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Last year after his injury-plagued
team was annihilated by Stanford 9-0
in the first round of the NCAA team
tournament, USC women's tennis
Coach Dave Borelli reassured his
players that they would return to
challenge the Cardinal in 1988.

Well, it's 1988, and the Trojans are healthy and
loaded with talented freshmen. But last Thursday
at the USC Tennis Center, in the first meeting of
the season between the national powers, the Trojans
improved little on last May's shutout defeat.
No. 2 Stanford, without junior Eleni Rossides,
the nation's top-ranked singles player, routed No.
3 USC 7-1. The victory was the Cardinal's sixth
straight against the Trojans in the past two years.
Friday, Stanford improved its dual-match record to
15-1 with a 6-3 victory over No. 4 UCLA at the
Los Angeles Tennis Center.
For a team with revenge on its mind, the Trojans
played with a lack of emotion, according to Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan. "They were flat as a pan
cake," he said. "They were just awful."
The Cardinal, on the other hand, responded well
to a three-week layoff. "When you come off Dead
Week and Finals Week, you don't know what to
expect," Brennan said. "We were really good."
Stanford freshman Tami Whitlinger capped off a
stellar month with an impressive three-set victory
under adverse conditions against USC's Trisha
Laux. Whitlinger was not feeling well and had to
endure the 90-degree temperature in Los Angeles
to defeat the Trojan freshman 7-6, 3-6, 6-4 in the
No. 1 singles contest. Laux beat Whitlinger in a
tournament earlier in the season.
"I was wondering if she (Whitlinger) was going
to be able to play at all," Brennan said. "She's just
a real gutsy competitor."
With her 6-2, 6-2 victory over UCLA's Allyson
Cooper the following day, Whitlinger concluded an
undefeated month of March and upped her overall
record to 31-4. She was named the ITCA-Volvo
Tennis/Collegiate Series Player of the Month for
March.
Stanford's Lisa Green, Teri Whitlinger, Sandra
Birch and Kay Tittle were all straight-set winners
against USC as the Cardinal clinched the match
before the doubles were played.
The Cardinal also clinched in singles Friday at
UCLA. However, the Bruins had to default the No.
6 singles contest because they only had five healthy
players available for the match. Stanford won four
of the five matches played, all in straight sets.
Green lost in three sets.
UCLA was forced to default the No. 3 doubles,
but the Bruins won the two doubles matches that
were played. "We were very fiat (in doubles)," Bren
nan said. "We had clinched the match already,
number one. And number two, the kids were ready
to go on (spring) break."
Rossides, who has risen in the national singles
rankings to the No. 1 spot despite the fact that she
hasn't played in almost two months, practiced for
45 minutes Friday and "felt good," according to
Brennan. Rossides has been plagued by a groin
injury that she suffered in early February, and she
is questionable for next weekend's matches.



Freshman sensation Tami Whitlinger has won her last 10 matches at No. 1 singles
and was named the college player of the month for March.
