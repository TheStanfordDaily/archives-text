# Spikers swept on L.A. swing

Senior Darryl
Rouse showed
enthusiasm dur- •
ing practice last
night that one
would be hard
pressed to find

from most players in a game
situation. But it is just that
type of enthusiasm that Car
dinal volleyball needs to show
if it is to bounce back from a
very disappointing spring
break.
Having to play three matches
in four nights while all of your
classmates are relaxing on
various beaches around the
globe seems bad enough, but
Stanford saw things go from
bad to worse in losing to Long
Beach State, Cal State-
Northridge and Pepperdine.
Stanford began its trek south
with a 4-5 conference mark, a
share of fifth place in the West
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association and a lot of high
hopes. The Cardinal returned
home with a 4-8 league record,
an eighth-place league standing
and only a very slim chance of
reaching post-season play.
The trouble began exactly
one week ago, when Stanford
took on the 49ers in Long
Beach's University Gym. The
result was a tough 13-15, 15-
12, 15-12, 15-13 loss for the
Cardinal. Although the 49ers
came into the match with a
3-7 conference record, their 16-
11 overall mark turned out to
be a better indication of how
Long Beach would play.
"We knew we'd have our
hands full going down there,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Ruben
Nieves said. "Every team in
this conference is capable of
playing very well, especially at
nome."
Stanford was paced by soph
omore Craig Forsyth. The Car

dinal outside hitter recorded 18
kills and 10 digs on the match.
"We played pretty decently,"
Forsyth said. "We just didn't
execute when we had to."
It was an entirely different
story against Northridge. Al
though both matches will sim
ply be remembered as losses
when the season comes to a
close, Stanford played one of
its worst matches of the season
against the Matadors. "We
were very poor," Forsyth said
"succinctly.
Northridge was able to
avenge an earlier defeat at
Maples Pavilion behind the
powerful hitting of Kien Do,
Robert Samuelson and Jeff
Campbell. The Matadors hit
.453 for the match and never
let the Cardinal into the con
test as they cruised to a 15-9,
15-6, 15-11 victory.
After two losses in two
nights, the Cardinal got a day
off before travelling to Pepper
dine to take on the Waves. Al
though Stanford lost the match
in three straight games (15-10,
15-7, 15-13), the mat h was
relatively close. But in the end
it was Stanford's 17 serving
errors and seven passing
miscues that decided the
match.
"We played hard and showed
a lot of character after losing
two in a row," Nieves said, "but
Pepperdine is very tough to
play on their home floor."
Stanford certainly isn't
pleased with the week's results.
But the team seems more dis
appointed than frustrated and
is now fervently preparing for
mighty USC. Tho Trojans will
visit Maples Wednesday night.
"Yeah, it was a tough road
trip," Stanford Coach Fred
Sturm said. Then he hurriedly
shuffled off, emphasizing his,
and his team's, commitment to
the future — not the past.
