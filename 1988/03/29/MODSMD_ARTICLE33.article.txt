Stanford guard Todd Lichti is
653 points away from sacrilege.
The legendary Lew Aicindor has
loomed head and shoulders above
everyone on the Pacific 10 Con
ference all-time scoring list for
nearly 20 years.
Yet if Lichti averages 19.8
points per game for 33 games next
season, the immortal Kareem will
be surpassed by a young man who
looks like a regular guy off the
court.

But wait, there's more. If a
baby-faced kid from Arizona
decides he can do without a few
million dollars for another year,
Alcindor will probably fall to third
on the list.
Wildcat forward Sean Elliott
needs only 536 points to vault
past Alcindor, and with Arizona
still alive in the NCAA tourna
ment, that total will certainly be
lower by the end of the season.
Think of it: The Pac-10 all-time
scoring list featuring a puckish
6-foot-8 beanpole in first, a hard
hat 6-foot-4 blue collar dude in
second, followed by the greatest
basketball scorer of all time. So
much for tradition.
Of course, Alcindor's mark of
2,325 points was accomplished in
88 games over three seasons. In
1965, Alcindor's first year in col
lege, freshmen were ineligible to
play varsity ball.
Elliott and Lichti both have al
ready played in more games than
the Bruin giant, and both are still
more than half-a-thousand points
behind.
Nevertheless, there's no deny
ing that two of the best scorers
in Pac-10 history are playing right
now. So when you read one more
article about the weakness of
West Coast basketball, or hear
one more eastern-bred commen
tator bemoan the lack of compe
tition west of the Rockies, remem
ber that these are the times when
you can see Elliott and Lichti fill
up the hole on impossible
jumpers, rip the 'bound off the
glass and park the alley-oop with

authority.

Arizona Coach Lute Olson has
been saying all year that the chic
degradation of Western basketball
is hogwash.
At the Pac-10 tournament he
blamed the "East Coast cable es
tablishment" for the negative at
titude. "Everything still seems to
be based on UCLA. Why should
Stanford be judged on how UCLA
plays. It's ridiculous," Olson said.
"It's typical of too many people
not seeing games and then giving
their opinions on them."
At an NCAA press conference
last week, Olson said that he
would rather play North Carolina
than a team like Stanford, which
knows how to prepare for the
Wildcats.
But although Olson is using his
status as a Final Four coach to
tout the West, and sometimes
Stanford in particular, there is no
love lost between the Wildcats and
the Cardinal.
After Stanford upset Arizona in
early February, Ellott's ribcage
reportedly looked like a battered,
xylophone. Elliott refrained from
complaining about the rough
treatment, but Olson put in his
two cents.
• • •
The usually articulate but polite
Elliott had probably the best
zinger quote of the Pac-10 tour
nament. After UCLA lost in the
first round to Washington State,
someone asked Elliott if he was
disappointed that Arizona would
not play the Bruins.
"As far as I'm concerned, they
can enjoy their plane ride home,"
he said.
Olson buried his head in his
hands and said, "What Sean
meant to say..."
The all-conference team was as
follows: Wright and Lichti from
Stanford, Elliott, Steve Kerr and
Anthony Cook from Arizona,
Pooh Richardson and Trevor Wil
son from UCLA, Oregon's An
thony Taylor, Oregon State's
Gary Payton and Washington's
Eldridge Recasner. Elliott was
Player of the Year, and Olson was
Coach of the Year.
The all-freshman team included
Will Brantley of Oregon State,
Ronnie Coleman of USC, Califor
nia's Ryan Drew, UCLA's Gerald
Madkins and Freshman of the
Year Mike Hayward from Wash
ington.

Arizona Coach Lute Olson has
been saying all year that the chic
degradation of Western basketball
is hogwash.
At the Pac-10 tournament he
blamed the "East Coast cable es
tablishment" for the negative at
titude. "Everything still seems to
be based on UCLA. Why should
Stanford be judged on how UCLA
plays. It's ridiculous," Olson said.
"It's typical of too many people
not seeing games and then giving
their opinions on them."
At an NCAA press conference
last week, Olson said that he
would rather play North Carolina
than a team like Stanford, which
knows how to prepare for the
Wildcats.
But although Olson is using his
status as a Final Four coach to
tout the West, and sometimes
Stanford in particular, there is no
love lost between the Wildcats and
the Cardinal.
After Stanford upset Arizona in
early February, Ellott's ribcage
reportedly looked like a battered,
xylophone. Elliott refrained from
complaining about the rough
treatment, but Olson put in his
two cents.

The usually articulate but polite
Elliott had probably the best
zinger quote of the Pac-10 tour
nament. After UCLA lost in the
first round to Washington State,
someone asked Elliott if he was
disappointed that Arizona would
not play the Bruins.
"As far as I'm concerned, they
can enjoy their plane ride home,"
he said.
Olson buried his head in his
hands and said, "What Sean
meant to say..."
The all-conference team was as
follows: Wright and Lichti from
Stanford, Elliott, Steve Kerr and
Anthony Cook from Arizona,
Pooh Richardson and Trevor Wil
son from UCLA, Oregon's An
thony Taylor, Oregon State's
Gary Payton and Washington's
Eldridge Recasner. Elliott was
Player of the Year, and Olson was
Coach of the Year.
The all-freshman team included
Will Brantley of Oregon State,
Ronnie Coleman of USC, Califor
nia's Ryan Drew, UCLA's Gerald
Madkins and Freshman of the
Year Mike Hayward from Wash
ington.
