# Women's hoops collects honors

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Even though the
curtain has long
since fallen, the
crowd is still on its
feet.
Complementing
the finest season

in school history, Stanford wom
en's basketball Coach Tara Van-
Derveer and seven of her present
and prospective players are enjoy
ing a veritable wealth of honors
heaped on them this past week.
Topping the list are accolades
from the Women's Basketball
News Service, which gave Stan
ford a grand slam: VanDerveer
was named national Coach of the
Year, guard Sonja Henning was
named national Freshman of the
Year and incoming freshman
guard Martha Richards was
named national high school
Player of tho Year.
VanDerveer was also named
District Eight Coach of the Year
in her third season on the West
Coast.
"I think it's great, because she
brought a team that finished 14-
14 last year up to a team that
finished 27-5," freshman center
Tammy Svoboda said. "That in
itself is a great accomplishment."
Along with national acclaim,
Henning joined classmate Trisha
Stevens on the Pacific 10 Confer
ence All-Freshman team. Moreo
ver, Henning earned herself a spot
on the NCAA Midwest Regional
All-Tournament team for her in
spired play against Texas in the
Cardinal's semifinal matchup last
Thursday.
"Sonja would get my vote be
cause of her poise, competitive
ness and basic ability," VanDer
veer said of the freshman's
honors. "She carried a lot of re
sponsibility for a freshman in
terms of what she had to do. She's
extremely confident and the ul
timate team player."
Henning also was half of ar
guably the best backcourt on the
West Coast, combining with soph
omore sensation Jennifer Azzi to
lead the Pac-10 in team assists.
A local favorite, Azzi placed
among the region's elite players
on the All-District-Eight team.

'We're looking for
an NCAA champi
onship one of
these years.'
— Jennifer Azzi

But her accomplishments don't
Btop there. The Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
native topped the Pac-10 in three
categories — assists, three-point
field goals made and three-point
percentage — as well as tying for
second in steals.
More importantly, Azzi received
the third most votes for the Pac
-10 All-Conference team. Team
mate Katy Steding, who was
named with Azzi last season to
the Pac-10 All-Freshman team,
joined her on the all-conference
team this year.
"It feels good getting recogni
tion for hard work," Azzi said,
"but a lot of people get honors
but only a few win national cham
pionships. That's the kind of
honor I'd like to have.
"Looking back on the season,
we were 27-5, and we did a lot
of things that Stanford women's
basketball has never done before.
I feel pretty good, but I want
more, I think Tara wants more
and I think our team wants more.
We want to go to the Final Four,
and we're looking for an NCAA
championship one of these years."
If this season and Stanford's
recruiting class are any indica
tion, Azzi and company have set
an attainable goal. Apart from
qualifying for the NCAA Tourna
ment for the first time in six
years, the 74-72 overtime win
over Montana represented the
Cardinal's first postseason win in
the history of the program, whet
ting the Stanford players' ap
petites for future appearances as
well as introducing the squad to
the demands of big-time basket
ball in front of large, noisy crowds.
"Playing up in Montana in front
of 10,000 people and playing at
Texas was a great experience not
only for the freshmen but for the

sophomores, too," Svoboda said.
"Now that we've seen a top team,
it showed us what we need to
work on."
The incoming players should
make team improvement a little
easier. Heralded as the best
recruiting class in the nation, the
trio of Richards, Julie Zeilstra and
Chris MacMurdo — three of the
top 10 high school players nation
ally — have amassed honors as
extensive as the current Cardinal
cagers.
The Women's Basketball News
Service showed a definite pro-
Stanford bent for preps as well,
naming each of the three First

Team All-America. In addition,
the service honored Richards fur
ther by naming her national high
school Player of the Year.
USA Today and Parade maga
zine share this high esteem for
the trio, placing each player on
their All-America teams.
"Martha is a three-point
shooter, an excellent passer,
handles the ball well and has some
good moves," VanDerveer said.
Julie is a good passer, good
shooter and an excellent rebound
er, and Chris is an all-around good
athlete who runs really well.
They're just going to make our
team stronger."
