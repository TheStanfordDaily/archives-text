# Mortenson backs into limelight

### Karen Chun 
When swimmer Jay Mortenson
came to Stanford on a recruiting
trip in the spring of 1985, he was
in awe of his recruiters, including
1984 Olympic team members
Pablo Morales, Jeff Kostoff and
John Moffet. Now new recruits
have reason to idolize Mortenson.
Mortenson burst onto the na
tional scene in 1987 with his per
formance at the NCAA Champi
onships. He set the American
record in the 100-yard backstroke
while swimming the leadoff leg of
Stanford's NCAA-winning 400
medley relay team. He became one
of the top point-scorers in the
1987 competition and a substan
tial contributer to Stanford's
third consecutive NCAA victory
by finishing second in the 100
butterfly and the 100 back.
"I started swimming when I
was seven years old with kids in
the neighborhood," Mortenson
said. "When I turned 12, I was
at the state level and by the time
I was 14, I was nationally
ranked."
He went on to become No. 1
among high school swimmers in
1985 in the 100 fly, and fourth
in the nation in the 100 back. He
set national high school records

in the 100-meter short-coursc fly
and the 100-meter short-course
back, and was the 1983 and 1985
Wisconsin Swimmer of the Year.
With such a prominent high
school record, Mortenson sparked
the interest of the Stanford swim
ming program, which was No. 1
in the nation. In the spring of
1985 the blond-haired swimmer
with ail-American looks from
Madison, Wis., visited the Farm.
Reflecting on his recruiting trip,
Mortenson smiled and said,
"Stanford was my last trip and I
loved it and the team. I had a
blast. Stanford was head and
houlders above anywhere else I
went."
Mortenson was especially im
pressed by Morales, Moffet and
Kostoff, world-renowned swim
mers who all became "great
friends as well as great competi
tors."
Mortenson's main concern
about coming to Stanford was
how to balance his schoolwork
and social life with swimming. He
said that his choice was the right
one, and is pleased with the
results — both academically and
socially.
The key to balancing everything
is "being able to sacrifice one
thing for another," he said.

Stanford's swimming program,
under the guidance of Coach Skip
Kenney, the NCAA Coach of the
Year each of the past three
seasons, has worked well for Mor
tenson and he feels he has im
proved immensely. "Skip is a very
intense, good leader and I swim
well for him," Mortenson com
mented.
Mortenson has started his 1988
season with flying colors. He qual
ified in mid-season for the NCAA
Championships and is very
pleased with his training this
year. He is swimming faster than
he was last year at this time.
Mortenson's best times rank
him No. 1 in the 100 fly and 100
back in NCAA competition, and
he plans to score big points for
Stanford, hoping the Cardinal will
win the national championship for
the fourth year in a row.
"It's a different team this year
than in the past, now that we've
lost Jeff Kostoff and Pablo
Morales. The NCAAs will be close,
but I'm confident that we'll win,"
Mortenson said.
Besides his confidence, Morten
son's desire also helps him excel.
"I swim as fast as I can whether
I'm alone or in a race — I give
my best anytime," he said.
Mortenson will need his best to

achieve his goal of earning a spot
on the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team.
If he makes it to Seoul, Korea,
Mortenson said he will not settle
for second best.
"I not only want to go, I want
to win. And I won't be satisfied
with anything less than at least
one gold," Mortenson said.
With his 6-foot-5 lanky frame,
it is clear that Mortenson's des
tiny was to become an athlete,
but training and experience is
what actually made him a great
swimmer.
Training includes workouts
twice a day Monday through Fri
day and another workout Satur
day morning. He spends three
hours in the water and the rest
of the time doing sit-ups, surgical
tubing exercises and running and
weight training. Mortenson ad
mitted that it is difficult getting
up at 6:05 a.m. every day and
that there are "a lot of afternoons
that I'd rather study or sleep."
But on those afternoons he
realizes the workouts aren't really
that bad and he wants to be with
the guys. "My closest friends are
on the team; I miss them when
I'm not with them," he said.
After the NCAA Champion
ships in April, Mortenson will set
his sights on the Olympic Games.
During the rest of spring quarter
and through most of the summer,
Mortenson will train in Concord,
where he spent last summer.
There, he will train with the very
best, including Morales and Mof
fet, under the guidance of Mitch
Ivey, a backstroke medalist in the
1968 and 1972 Olympics. He will
be swimming with "no distrac
tions. When we're there, all we
do is eat, sleep and swim," Mor
tenson said.
Between swimming, school and
sleeping, Mortenson does not have
much free time, but he does find
the time to pursue other interests.
He enjoys photography, waterski
ing, studying, driving cars and
gambling as well as following and
playing the stock market. When

asked about future goals, Morten
son said with a chuckle, "I want
to be very rich. I can do it through
financial markets."
Another of Mortenson's activi
ties which is very important to
him is the process of recruiting.
"We recruit the very best in the
country, but we recruit whom we
like because we're going to have
to swim with them for the next
few years," said Mortenson.
Once the recruits are at Stan
ford, the team goes all out to show
them a good time. They party with
them, take them to classes and
expose them to the team and stu
dent body.
"It's not terribly hard to sell
Stanford, which just happens to
both be the best university and
have the best swim team in the
nation," Mortenson said.
"When you're No. 1 in the na
tion, you swim on pride. I'm just
getting to the point right now
where I want to be —No. 1— and
I don't want to leave it. I'd like
to stay and enjoy it."

Besides his confidence, Morten
son's desire also helps him excel.
"I swim as fast as I can whether
I'm alone or in a race — I give
my best anytime," he said.
Mortenson will need his best to

achieve his goal of earning a spot
on the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team.
If he makes it to Seoul, Korea,
Mortenson said he will not settle
for second best.
"I not only want to go, I want
to win. And I won't be satisfied
with anything less than at least
one gold," Mortenson said.
With his 6-foot-5 lanky frame,
it is clear that Mortenson's des
tiny was to become an athlete,
but training and experience is
what actually made him a great
swimmer.
Training includes workouts
twice a day Monday through Fri
day and another workout Satur
day morning. He spends three
hours in the water and the rest
of the time doing sit-ups, surgical
tubing exercises and running and
weight training. Mortenson ad
mitted that it is difficult getting
up at 6:05 a.m. every day and
that there are "a lot of afternoons
that I'd rather study or sleep."
But on those afternoons he
realizes the workouts aren't really
that bad and he wants to be with
the guys. "My closest friends are
on the team; I miss them when
I'm not with them," he said.
After the NCAA Champion
ships in April, Mortenson will set
his sights on the Olympic Games.
During the rest of spring quarter
and through most of the summer,
Mortenson will train in Concord,
where he spent last summer.
There, he will train with the very
best, including Morales and Mof
fet, under the guidance of Mitch
Ivey, a backstroke medalist in the
1968 and 1972 Olympics. He will
be swimming with "no distrac
tions. When we're there, all we
do is eat, sleep and swim," Mor
tenson said.
Between swimming, school and
sleeping, Mortenson does not have
much free time, but he does find
the time to pursue other interests.
He enjoys photography, waterski
ing, studying, driving cars and
gambling as well as following and
playing the stock market. When

asked about future goals, Morten
son said with a chuckle, "I want
to be very rich. I can do it through
financial markets."
Another of Mortenson's activi
ties which is very important to
him is the process of recruiting.
"We recruit the very best in the
country, but we recruit whom we
like because we're going to have
to swim with them for the next
few years," said Mortenson.
Once the recruits are at Stan
ford, the team goes all out to show
them a good time. They party with
them, take them to classes and
expose them to the team and stu
dent body.
"It's not terribly hard to sell
Stanford, which just happens to
both be the best university and
have the best swim team in the
nation," Mortenson said.
"When you're No. 1 in the na
tion, you swim on pride. I'm just
getting to the point right now
where I want to be —No. 1— and
I don't want to leave it. I'd like
to stay and enjoy it."
When swimmer Jay Mortenson
came to Stanford on a recruiting
trip in the spring of 1985, he was
in awe of his recruiters, including
1984 Olympic team members
Pablo Morales, Jeff Kostoff and
John Moffet. Now new recruits
have reason to idolize Mortenson.
Mortenson burst onto the na
tional scene in 1987 with his per
formance at the NCAA Champi
onships. He set the American
record in the 100-yard backstroke
while swimming the leadoff leg of
Stanford's NCAA-winning 400
medley relay team. He became one
of the top point-scorers in the
1987 competition and a substan
tial contributer to Stanford's
third consecutive NCAA victory
by finishing second in the 100
butterfly and the 100 back.
"I started swimming when I
was seven years old with kids in
the neighborhood," Mortenson
said. "When I turned 12, I was
at the state level and by the time
I was 14, I was nationally
ranked."
He went on to become No. 1
among high school swimmers in
1985 in the 100 fly, and fourth
in the nation in the 100 back. He
set national high school records

in the 100-meter short-coursc fly
and the 100-meter short-course
back, and was the 1983 and 1985
Wisconsin Swimmer of the Year.
With such a prominent high
school record, Mortenson sparked
the interest of the Stanford swim
ming program, which was No. 1
in the nation. In the spring of
1985 the blond-haired swimmer
with ail-American looks from
Madison, Wis., visited the Farm.
Reflecting on his recruiting trip,
Mortenson smiled and said,
"Stanford was my last trip and I
loved it and the team. I had a
blast. Stanford was head and
houlders above anywhere else I
went."
Mortenson was especially im
pressed by Morales, Moffet and
Kostoff, world-renowned swim
mers who all became "great
friends as well as great competi
tors."
Mortenson's main concern
about coming to Stanford was
how to balance his schoolwork
and social life with swimming. He
said that his choice was the right
one, and is pleased with the
results — both academically and
socially.
The key to balancing everything
is "being able to sacrifice one
thing for another," he said.

Stanford's swimming program,
under the guidance of Coach Skip
Kenney, the NCAA Coach of the
Year each of the past three
seasons, has worked well for Mor
tenson and he feels he has im
proved immensely. "Skip is a very
intense, good leader and I swim
well for him," Mortenson com
mented.
Mortenson has started his 1988
season with flying colors. He qual
ified in mid-season for the NCAA
Championships and is very
pleased with his training this
year. He is swimming faster than
he was last year at this time.
Mortenson's best times rank
him No. 1 in the 100 fly and 100
back in NCAA competition, and
he plans to score big points for
Stanford, hoping the Cardinal will
win the national championship for
the fourth year in a row.
"It's a different team this year
than in the past, now that we've
lost Jeff Kostoff and Pablo
Morales. The NCAAs will be close,
but I'm confident that we'll win,"
Mortenson said.
Besides his confidence, Morten
son's desire also helps him excel.
"I swim as fast as I can whether
I'm alone or in a race — I give
my best anytime," he said.
