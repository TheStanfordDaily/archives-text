While most stu
dents relaxed
over spring
break, the Stan
ford men's golf
team was busy
playing in the

Pepsi/Fresno State Classic in
Fresno and the Western Inter
collegiate hosted by UC-Santa
Cruz.
The Cardinal turned in a dis
mal performance at Fresno,
due mostly to the tournament's
coming right after exams and
dead week, when the golfers
did not practice at all. Stanford
finished 27th of 28 teams on
what coach Wally Goodwin
called "a very easy golf course."
The team failed to qualify for
the third round, missing the
cut by 14 strokes. Texas-El
Paso took the tournament with
a three-round total of 1064,
squeezing out top-ranked
Arizona State by three shots.
Individually for Stanford,
sophomore Mark Funseth was
the only standout. He was the
lone Cardinal golfer to qualify

for the third round of play.
Funseth shot 233 (75-73-75) to
finish 50th overall in the tour
ney. Arizona State's Mike
Springer took the low medalist
title with a three round total
of 203.
Although the team's per
formance left much to be
desired, Goodwin was not too
disappointed. "We were not up
to [the tournament]. Since it
came right after exams and
dead week, we did not have
much of a chance to practice."
He added that there was very
stiff competition at Fresno
State, especially from within
Stanford's own league. In the
last national rankings, the
Pacific 10 Conference had four
of the top 12 teams.
On a brighter note, the Car
dinal began competition in the
Western Intercollegiate tour
nament at Pasatiempo in Santa
Cruz yesterday. The team cur
rently is in 14th place out of
25 teams after one round of
the 54-hole event. Stanford's
team total of 398 is 24 shots
behind the leading squad, Cal
