# Swimmers happy with Haines

Through the rain
and the thick
steam rising from
deGuerre Pool, an
observer might
glimpse a man tap
dancing while

singing "Oh Jenna, oh Jenna. If
I had you in my arms, over these
prison walls I would fiy!" Who is
this handsome, blue-eyed, gray
haired goofball? Ever heard of
George Haines?
While few students recognize
the name of Stanford's head wom
en's swimming coach, Haines, 64,
is well-known in the world of
swimming.
Regarded by one swimmer as
"the man of cliches," Haines is
constantly singing to his swim
mers — whatever the hour or
place. He has a song or wisecrack
for every occasion.
Junior backstroker Michelle
Donahue recalled a hallmark
Haines incident. "I remember one
day coming into his office really
upset about a class. I was crying,
and before I even said anything,
George asked, 'Are you pregnant?
Did you get married? Nothing can
be as bad as that. What's wrong,
Doggadoo?' Somehow, George
tends to comically put things into
perspective," said Donahue.
His swimmers say that Haines
knows exactly how to train each
individual according to her athle
tic ability. As freestyler Aimee
Berzins put it, "George has the
ability to recognize what each
swimmer needs, and his past ex
periences show his success."
And it isn't surprising that he
should be able to recognize their
needs. Considered by many as the
finest swimming coach in the
world, Haines has coached more
than 50 Olympic swimmers, win
ning 35 gold, 11 silver and seven
bronze medals.
Haines' interest in coaching
started at 14 when he decided he
wanted to be like his own coach.
"I tried to emulate him — every
thing he did," said Haines.
Haines swam competitively in
college so he would have a better
chance to coach later on. He grad
uated in 1950 at the top of his
physical education class at San
Jose State.
Later that year, Haines took a
coaching job at Santa Clara High
School, where he founded the
swimming program. Six years lat
er, his women's team won their
first national title. And after 24
years of serving as a swimming

coach, Haines had built a swim
ming powerhouse. He said that
there was one point in his Santa
Clara coaching career in which
his team held every possible
record in the book.
In the fall of 1981, Haines
started coaching at Stanford.
Since then, his team has boasted
an impressive 56-5 dual-meet
record and has never finished
lower than third at the NCAAs.
Haines has also served the
United States Olympic Committee
in the last seven Olympiads, as
either head or assistant swim
ming coach.
Haines coached stand-out
swimmer Mark Spitz, who holds
the all-time record for the most
gold medals (seven) won by an
individual in a single Olympiad.
"[Spitz] was great — he probably
had the best feel for the water of
any kid I've ever coached. But he
had serious 'I' problems, and I
don't mean this type of 'eye',"
Haines said, pointing to his baby
blues.
One of Haines' proudest mo
ments ever was at the 1960 Olym
pic Games in Rome, in which he
coached former Stanford Ail-
American Chris Von Saltza to
three gold medals. He considers
this time in his life as particularly
special because, "seeing a swim
mer you have developed since age
10 win a gold medal — that has
to be the biggest thing."
In addition, Haines coached
sports commentator and Stanford
graduate Donna De Varona, as
well as Olympic medalist Karen
Moe Thornton, California's cur
rent head women's swimming
coach. Although they have now
been rivals for years, Haines had
plenty of positive things to say of
Thornton: "She knew what she
was doing as much as anybody
I've ever coached. She was aware
of her times and the pace she had
to go to improve."
While Haines has coached both
men and women, he seems to have
a special understanding of female
athletes. Because of his experi
ence, and possibly because he has
three daughters, he has seen and
heard every problem or excuse
imaginable.
As any Stanford swimmer can
tell you, this father-figure's com
mon cure to any problem is,
"You'll be all right by the time
you're married twice," and if that
isn't enough, he is quick to make
the analogy that "boys are like
street cars. There will be another
one by in a few minutes."
While this solution doesn't al

ways solve problems, it may crack
a smile. Sometimes he introduces
swimmers as his second wife, get
ting more grins. Haines is still
married to his first and only wife,
however, whom he often respect
fully and affectionately refers to
as "Sweetie-face" or "Big Red."
Haines allows time for fun, but
he also knows when to be intense.
In fact, his mood at the pool, es
pecially before a big competition,
is not always carefree; sometimes
he makes a few waves, too. Haines
isn't all sugar — he can be a
grouch or at least put on a good
act, say his swimmers, who some
times call him "Boss Hog."
One swimmer remarked,
"When he gets mad, it is frustrat
ing. One minute he'll be all smiles,
and the next minute he is throw
ing a chair over your head into
the pool!"
Often, just when he appears to
have reached the height of his
anger, he smiles or chuckles to
the relief of all.
In her two-year experience of
working closely with Haines as a
team captain, senior Jen Pokluda

feels she knows him pretty well.
"He can make you madder than
anyone else, and he does it pur
posely — trying to get you roused
up to swim faster."
Pokluda said that although it
is not what she always wants, it
does work to make her swim
faster. She attributes her con
stant improvement throughout
college to Haines' coaching and
friendship.
Under Haines' guidance the
Cardinal placed third at the
NCAAs a week ago, Stanford's
12th consecutive top-three finish.
Everything indicates that these
swimmers will bring only more
credit to Haines in this summer's
Olympic Games.
When asked about his future
in coaching, Haines did not make
any predictions, but he did say
he would end his career at Stan
ford. Haines hails Stanford as
"the greatest campus in the coun
try."
That says a lot coming from
the coach generally regarded as
the greatest in the world.
