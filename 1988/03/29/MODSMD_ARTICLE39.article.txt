# Crew teams strain for gains

### Don Hogue Staff writer 
Ah, spring break.
Visions of Mazat
lan, Palm Springs
and Hawaii
abound, but none
such exist for the
men's and wom-

en's crews. Spring break — or
hell week — for crew entailed
two-a-day workouts, wake-up at
5:30 a.m., sanding and painting
equipment and adding another
layer of callouses to already well
worn hands.
In short, it was anything but a
"break" in the literal sense.
However, Cardinal oarsmen
welcomed the chance to concen

trate on rowing without typical
school distractions.
"It was nice to just row without
messing around with classes. We
had time to rest after workouts,"
junior varsity coxswain Scott
Evans said. "We knew we were
here to row and get faster."
The crews had ample opportu
nity to row, having 10 practices
in six days at Redwood Shores.
In addition, the men's crew had
the fortune to train and scrim
mage against the visiting Penn
Athletic Club, the top rowing or
ganization in the United States.
Guests of Stanford Crew for the
week, the defending world cham
pion Penn AC four-without-cox is
rowing in preparation for the
summer Olympic games.

"Rowing against world champs
at every seat as well as being un
der the helpful eye of Coach Ted
Nash has added as much as two
lengths to our boat speed and even
more to our level of knowledge,
teamwork and confidence," Stan
ford Men's Coach Ken Dreyfuss
said. "We are ready to claim our
first-ever medal in San Diego next
weekend — hopefully the gold."
In addition to the presence of
the Penn AC crews, Stanford's
spring break regimen included
morning seat racing, which
solidified boating assignments.
Oarsmen on each of the crews
were given a chance to "race" for
the opportunity to row in a par
ticular seat.
"Seat racing enabled us to find

that extra effort to go faster,"
senior Kristin Dahl noted. "It's
amazing how much reserve you'll
find when you're racing for a spot
in the boat."
Women's Coach John Davis'
workouts utilized morning seat
races to build raw speed and af
ternoon distance rows to increase
endurance. In addition, gusty
winds on San Francisco Bay pre
sented the women's crew with
conditions similar to those at San
Diego's Mission Bay, preparing
the crew for the upcoming week
end.
In spite of the tough workout
conditions during the week, the
crews found time to make im
provements, get to know each
other and have a little fun.
