# Students reach out to East L.A.
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
A group of Stanford students
visited high schools in East Los
Angeles during spring break in
an attempt to "encourage minor
ity students to consider plans for
higher education," according to
one of the trip's organizers.
The 14 volunteers "drew on
their Stanford experiences" in
outreach presentations aimed
mainly at the Chicano-Latino
community, according to Minority
Outreach co-coordinator Ix>rraine
Atilano, a sophomore.
"We tried to reach schools with
large minority populations," said
Atilano. She described the out
reach participants as an "aware
ness group, not a recruiting
group."
With brochures and slides, the
students spoke at a total of 30
high schools in their home com
munities as far away as Ontario,
Canada, and as nearby as San
Jose.
Atilano said the volunteers
found the students "responsive
and receptive."
"Given the opportunity, they

enjoy talking with college stu
dents," she added.
Atilano noted that the program
operated without funding from
the Admissions Office. Instead,
the group received $560 from the
ASSU's discretionary fund to re
imburse costs of transportation
and phone calls to the |j>igh
schools.
Atilano estimated that the
group would have needed $700 to
$800 for full reimbursements.
Atilano said she approached
Chris Ponce, an associate director
of Admissions, with the Minority
Outreach program last quarter.
But the students did not receive
formal backing from the Univer
sity because Ponce feared there
was "not enough time" for the
project to work, according to
Atilano.
"Chris (Ponce) didn't realize
how hard we would work I last
quarter]," she said, "but in the
end he understood how students
can make a difference."
Atilano added that she thought
that it would be appropriate for
the outreach to be funded by Ad
missions.
Ponce was unavailable for com

ment yesterday.
"We're in pretty good standing
with Admissions now," Atilano
said. The students and the Ad
missions Office are planning to
work together in the future, she
said.
Modesta Garcia, a counselor at
the College of San Mateo who
helped train the volunteers, said
minority outreaches "enhance the
work professional admissions of
ficers are doing."
Garcia provided two training
workshops for the outreach par
ticipants in March at the recom
mendation of a Casa Zapata
residence assistant.
Garcia cited two advantages to
minority student outreaches.
First, "students can reach more
schools in a region than a single
admissions officer can," said Gar
cia, who has had seven years of
experience in admissions at Santa
Clara University and Princeton.
In addition, she said that be
cause "minority students are
doing the outreach in their own
communities, peer communica
tion is more effective."
Atilano agreed, saying that "ad
missions officers can be too in
timidating" and that students can
more easily talk to people their
own age about student experi
ences.
Atilano said Minority Outreach
hopes to replace the Ambassador
Program, which is coordinated by
the Admissions Office and aims
at goals similar to those of Mi
nority Outreach.

Although most of last week's
outreach participants did not
train through the Ambassador
Program, Atilano said she felt the
students "were not under
prepared."
Emphasizing the "validity" that
comes from a student as opposed
to an admissions officer, Atilano,
along with co-coordinator Rose
Flores, said they want "not an
Admissions-run but a student
coordinated program" operating
within the Admissions Office.
Atilano said she hopes the next
outreach in the summer will in
clude Asian and black communi
ties.
