### Angie Kim Staff writer 
The University recently recog
nized eight students with dean's
awards for their outstanding ser
vice to the Stanford community.
As a group, the recipients were
awarded for a diverse number
of activities, including the
relocation of students who lived
in Roble Hall, improvements in
student health and the organi
zation of a community wide con
ference.
The dean's awards are pre
sented three times a yeai at the
end of each quarter. James
Lyons, dean of student affairs,
selects the winners from stu
dents nominated throughout the
year by Stanford faculty and
staff members.
Winter quarter's winners are
Charic Daniels, Alicia Dorosin,
D.J. Dull, Vinton Frost, Matt
Gallagher, Stacey Leyton, Mary
Thurber and Anna Waring.
According to Leyton, all eight
students "felt very honored to
receive the awards because we
were singled out." But she added
that there are lots of students
on campus who deserve the
award for their attempts "to
make a difference as far as Stan
ford's policies and relationships
with the outside world are con

cerned."
Leyton, a senior in history,
was described by Jim Bouquin,
director of the Disability
Resource Center, as a "student
activist with a flair for politics
and affinity for concerns of social
justice." Bouquin, who
nominated Leyton for the award,
also commended her "success as
an educator in areas such as di
vestment, Sanctuary (a student
effort to offer asylum to Central
American political refugees in
1986), Western Culture, the
Rainbow Agenda and the grape
boycott."
Recognized for their combined
effort in organizing the 1988
You Can Make a Difference con
ference on institutional racism
were Daniels, a third-year law
student; Waring, a fifth-year
graduate student in education;
and Dorosin, who graduated in
Values, Technology, Science and
Society last year.
According to Public Service
Center Director Catherine Mil
ton, who nominated the trio,
they "glued many disparate
parts together and translated
the problems and experiences of
racism in a non-threatening,
positive manner."

"lucky in being the chosen ones"
among the many others that
