# Hoover alleges bias; Profs. counterattack
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Another battle in the ongoing war be
tween the University and the Hoover In
stitution became public yesterday as
Hoover and some of its opponents ex
changed heated missives.
Scholars at the Hoover Institution
"declared war" on the University Political
Science Prof. John Manley claimed yester
day, when they alleged that the University
has discriminated against Hoover Director
W. Glenn Campbell because it has not given
him the salary increases he deserves. Man
ley and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
responded to the salvo with fireworks of
their own, reiterating their familiar call
for a divorce of Hoover from Stanford.
The struggle began when a letter —
signed by 63 Hoover scholars — was re
leased early in March to the press, express
ing concern that Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell has been persecuted by a Uni
versity administration "less than enthusi
astic" in its support.
Manley and Rebholz, consistent critics
of Hoover, responded with a letter to the
Board of Trustees and the Faculty Senate
calling for the long-sought separation of
the two institutions.
The Hoover letter, signed by a large
majority of Hoover scholars, "including the
top library and archival staff" according to
Senior Research Fellow George Marotta,
summarizes the achievements of Hoover
and its scholars.
As evidence of the Institution's success,
the letter cites the "50-fold increase" of
Hoover's endowment and the quality of
the staff, "which includes a heavy concen
tration of Nobel laureates and others who
are among the current research leaders in
their respective areas."
According to Marotta, the motivation for
the letter included frustration among

Hoover fellows with continual attacks —
such as Manley and Rebholz' letter — of
what he called a small "intolerant" minor
ity on campus.
Senior Research Fellow Dennis Bark con
curred. "We consider these attacks on the
Institution and its director to be not only
without merit, but also a complete waste
of time," he said.
In addition, Bark said, responding to
criticism wastes valuable time that could
be spent researching.
Attributing the expansion of Hoover to
Campbell's direction, the letter calls on
trustees to "do everything necessary, fi
nancial or otherwise, to ensure that Dr.
Campbell remain director of the Hoover
Institution."
The letter was formulated amid rumors
that efforts were under way to attempt to
force Campbell out of his tenured position,
Bark said.
Campbell has expressed his intention to
remain director until 1994, when he turns
70. According to Campbell, the University
would have to show just cause to remove
him from his post.
The Hoover fellows also contend that
the 1 or 2 percent yearly raise given to
Campbell amounts to salary discrimina
tion, Marotta said.
On this point Manley agreed. If Camp
bell's annual salary increases are on the
order of 1 percent, he said, "The University
has essentially frozen his salary at or under
the rate of inflation."
Manley said the University should not
try to influence Hoover with financial
maneuvers, and characterized the type of
treatment allegedly given Campbell as un
fair.
Manley and Rebholz' letter is partially
a response to the Hoover letter, Manley
said. He indicated that the letter
also addressed the Hoover
scholars' fight to keep Hoover au
tonomous.
The professors' letter reviews
the 1985 report by the Dornbusch
Committee, a faculty committee
set up to review the relationship
between Hoover and Stanford.
The committee concluded, "If
events in the next several years
do not bring about greater amity,
divorce should be reconsidered."

By listing some of the Hoover
scholars' recent efforts to respond
to criticisms, primarily including
Marotta's research regarding the
political affiliations of the Stan
ford faculty, the letter attempts
to show that the relationship be
tween Stanford and Hoover has
worsened since the Dornbusch
report.
The two professors conclude by
encouraging the senate and trus
tees to discuss immediate plans
for separating Stanford and
Hoover. According to Manley, the
senate might consider the sugges
tion sometime in the near future.
