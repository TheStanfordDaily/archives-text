# Eshoo leads Democrats
## San Mateo supervisor favored in 12th District 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
Anna Eshoo is knowledgeable, aggressive
and proud. The San Mateo County super
visor is also the acknowledged Democratic
front-runner in the 12th Congressional
District, which suits her just fine.
"It feels good to be appreciated," says
Eschoo, a San Mateo County supervisor.
The Democrats appreciate her because
she possesses all the qualities that previous
Democratic candidates in the 12th District
have lacked: a long record of public service,
a reputation for getting things done and
reliable party contacts.
Saratoga Democrat Lance Weil, who lost
by a wide margin to first-term Republican
incumbent Ernie Konnyu in 1986, says of
the 45-year-old Eshoo: "This is the first
time the Democratic party has managed
to field such a candidate. None of the pre
vious candidates in this district had a po
litical history. It should be a very inter
esting race."
The 12th District, which includes Stan
ford, has not elected a Democrat since B.F.
Sisk won a seat in 1960.
However, Weil and other Democratic
strategists see an opportunity to wrest con
trol of the district from the Republicans
this year because Konnyu faces a tough
fight in the primary from Law Prof. Tom
Campbell.
The Democratic party has historically
refused to support "outsiders" for the nom
ination, giving Eshoo a big advantage over
the other less-established candidates. On
Saturday, March 20, the state party offi
cially endorsed Eshoo, a resident of Ather
ton.

Others in the field are Mountain View
businessman Gary Bond, Menlo Park in
ternational business consultant Jim Gar
rison and Hillsborough attorney Sylvia
Simmons. Bond and Garrison are relatively
new to the district, and none of the can
didates have Eshoo's name recognition.
But Eshoo refuses to be complacent. She
plans to make sure the voters know that
she has been "getting things done for a
long time." In Eshoo's mind, experience
counts more than "just stands on issues."
Eshoo supports the recently signed treaty
banning ground-launched intermediate nu
clear weapons and opposes Contra aid. She
speaks proudly of her public service and
hopes that her message of "experience"
