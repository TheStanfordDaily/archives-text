# Eshoo leads Democrats
## San Mateo supervisor favored in 12th District 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
Anna Eshoo is knowledgeable, aggressive
and proud. The San Mateo County super
visor is also the acknowledged Democratic
front-runner in the 12th Congressional
District, which suits her just fine.
"It feels good to be appreciated," says
Eschoo, a San Mateo County supervisor.
The Democrats appreciate her because
she possesses all the qualities that previous
Democratic candidates in the 12th District
have lacked: a long record of public service,
a reputation for getting things done and
reliable party contacts.
Saratoga Democrat Lance Weil, who lost
by a wide margin to first-term Republican
incumbent Ernie Konnyu in 1986, says of
the 45-year-old Eshoo: "This is the first
time the Democratic party has managed
to field such a candidate. None of the pre
vious candidates in this district had a po
litical history. It should be a very inter
esting race."
The 12th District, which includes Stan
ford, has not elected a Democrat since B.F.
Sisk won a seat in 1960.
However, Weil and other Democratic
strategists see an opportunity to wrest con
trol of the district from the Republicans
this year because Konnyu faces a tough
fight in the primary from Law Prof. Tom
Campbell.
The Democratic party has historically
refused to support "outsiders" for the nom
ination, giving Eshoo a big advantage over
the other less-established candidates. On
Saturday, March 20, the state party offi
cially endorsed Eshoo, a resident of Ather
ton.

Others in the field are Mountain View
businessman Gary Bond, Menlo Park in
ternational business consultant Jim Gar
rison and Hillsborough attorney Sylvia
Simmons. Bond and Garrison are relatively
new to the district, and none of the can
didates have Eshoo's name recognition.
But Eshoo refuses to be complacent. She
plans to make sure the voters know that
she has been "getting things done for a
long time." In Eshoo's mind, experience
counts more than "just stands on issues."
Eshoo supports the recently signed treaty
banning ground-launched intermediate nu
clear weapons and opposes Contra aid. She
speaks proudly of her public service and
hopes that her message of "experience"


Anna Eshoo
and "action" will distinguish her
from the rest of the field.
At the moment, Eshoo chairs
the Regional Task force on the
San Francisco Giants and is ac
tively seeking to bring the Giants
to a site in East Palo Alto.
Eshoo is also looking forward
to serving as a delegate in this
year's Democratic National Con
vention in Atlanta, Ga.
Eshoo has enjoyed her service
with the Democratic National
Committee over the past eight
years. She worked on the steering
committee of the 1980 presiden
tial campaign of Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and served on
the National Commission on Pres
idential Nominations from 1981-
82.

Through her work on the local
and national level, she has
developed party contacts that
should pay off at slection time.
According to Weil, the party has
"attached itself to Anna Eshoo."
Critics, though, have charged
that Eshoo's background may
produce a good resume, but not
necessarily a good candidate.
Rival candidate Garrison, for ex
ample, calls her "a good local
politician with a traditional Dem
ocratic background."
Garrison's campaign has been
trying to portray Eshoo as the
"establishment candidate," in
contrast to the former executive
director of the Esalen Institute,
who styles himself a "new gener
ation Democrat."
Unlike Eshoo, Garrison points
to his experience outside the dis
trict in the field of international
economics, claiming that Silicon
Valley needs a representative who

is better equipped to deal with
the region's many international
trade concerns.
Eshoo says that these charges
would be "understandable" if
people thought that everyone
"had just given things" to her.
But that's not the case, according
to Eshoo. "I've worked very, very
hard to get where I am," Eshoo
says."I haven't just filled the time
in the offices that I've held; I've
made things happen."
She refuses to single out her
"best" vote or program. But as
evidence of her action in office,
Eshoo cites the five years she
spent pushing through the
"Health Plan of San Mateo,"
which instituted local government
control over Medicaid and other
state medical benefits.
Eshoo calls the 12th district a
"model for the rest of the nation."
"This district is not afraid to
enact creative, innovative policies.

That's what it's all about... com
ing up with new ideas to combat
our problems," she says.
Eshoo disagrees with the notion
that you "give the people good
government." In her view, good
government is an "achievement."
She has discussed with University
President Donald Kennedy the
need for more graduate programs
in Public Policy because policy
making has become "so complex
and demanding."
Eshoo says she is running for
Congress because she is the "only
candidate with the experience and
ability to enact consistently good
policies.
"I may agree with a particular
candidate's stand on an issue. But
as I look around the field, I see
people who talk about getting
things done but don't take any
action. I'm a proven problem
solver and this is what people are
looking for."

Eshoo calls the 12th district a
"model for the rest of the nation."
"This district is not afraid to
enact creative, innovative policies.

That's what it's all about... com
ing up with new ideas to combat
our problems," she says.
Eshoo disagrees with the notion
that you "give the people good
government." In her view, good
government is an "achievement."
She has discussed with University
President Donald Kennedy the
need for more graduate programs
in Public Policy because policy
making has become "so complex
and demanding."
Eshoo says she is running for
Congress because she is the "only
candidate with the experience and
ability to enact consistently good
policies.
"I may agree with a particular
candidate's stand on an issue. But
as I look around the field, I see
people who talk about getting
things done but don't take any
action. I'm a proven problem
solver and this is what people are
looking for."
Anna Eshoo is knowledgeable, aggressive
and proud. The San Mateo County super
visor is also the acknowledged Democratic
front-runner in the 12th Congressional
District, which suits her just fine.
"It feels good to be appreciated," says
Eschoo, a San Mateo County supervisor.
The Democrats appreciate her because
she possesses all the qualities that previous
Democratic candidates in the 12th District
have lacked: a long record of public service,
a reputation for getting things done and
reliable party contacts.
Saratoga Democrat Lance Weil, who lost
by a wide margin to first-term Republican
incumbent Ernie Konnyu in 1986, says of
the 45-year-old Eshoo: "This is the first
time the Democratic party has managed
to field such a candidate. None of the pre
vious candidates in this district had a po
litical history. It should be a very inter
esting race."
The 12th District, which includes Stan
ford, has not elected a Democrat since B.F.
Sisk won a seat in 1960.
However, Weil and other Democratic
strategists see an opportunity to wrest con
trol of the district from the Republicans
this year because Konnyu faces a tough
fight in the primary from Law Prof. Tom
Campbell.
The Democratic party has historically
refused to support "outsiders" for the nom
ination, giving Eshoo a big advantage over
the other less-established candidates. On
Saturday, March 20, the state party offi
cially endorsed Eshoo, a resident of Ather
ton.

Others in the field are Mountain View
businessman Gary Bond, Menlo Park in
ternational business consultant Jim Gar
rison and Hillsborough attorney Sylvia
Simmons. Bond and Garrison are relatively
new to the district, and none of the can
didates have Eshoo's name recognition.
But Eshoo refuses to be complacent. She
plans to make sure the voters know that
she has been "getting things done for a
long time." In Eshoo's mind, experience
counts more than "just stands on issues."
Eshoo supports the recently signed treaty
banning ground-launched intermediate nu
clear weapons and opposes Contra aid. She
speaks proudly of her public service and
hopes that her message of "experience"


Anna Eshoo
and "action" will distinguish her
from the rest of the field.
At the moment, Eshoo chairs
the Regional Task force on the
San Francisco Giants and is ac
tively seeking to bring the Giants
to a site in East Palo Alto.
Eshoo is also looking forward
to serving as a delegate in this
year's Democratic National Con
vention in Atlanta, Ga.
Eshoo has enjoyed her service
with the Democratic National
Committee over the past eight
years. She worked on the steering
committee of the 1980 presiden
tial campaign of Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and served on
the National Commission on Pres
idential Nominations from 1981-
82.

Through her work on the local
and national level, she has
developed party contacts that
should pay off at slection time.
According to Weil, the party has
"attached itself to Anna Eshoo."
Critics, though, have charged
that Eshoo's background may
produce a good resume, but not
necessarily a good candidate.
Rival candidate Garrison, for ex
ample, calls her "a good local
politician with a traditional Dem
ocratic background."
Garrison's campaign has been
trying to portray Eshoo as the
"establishment candidate," in
contrast to the former executive
director of the Esalen Institute,
who styles himself a "new gener
ation Democrat."
Unlike Eshoo, Garrison points
to his experience outside the dis
trict in the field of international
economics, claiming that Silicon
Valley needs a representative who

is better equipped to deal with
the region's many international
trade concerns.
Eshoo says that these charges
would be "understandable" if
people thought that everyone
"had just given things" to her.
But that's not the case, according
to Eshoo. "I've worked very, very
hard to get where I am," Eshoo
says."I haven't just filled the time
in the offices that I've held; I've
made things happen."
She refuses to single out her
"best" vote or program. But as
evidence of her action in office,
Eshoo cites the five years she
spent pushing through the
"Health Plan of San Mateo,"
which instituted local government
control over Medicaid and other
state medical benefits.
Eshoo calls the 12th district a
