Dear Admissions Staff,
I am but another applicant
trying to get In
I Know my chancea are slim

And Stanford la the best school In the lot
Occidental Is challenging and fun
Yet for me Stanford la the one.

(TO THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES theme):
Come on listen to my story of a rabbit named
Bink, Star of Ufa In Hell, a strip that makes you
think. Well one day Blnk was feelin' kinda low,
So he came up wth the plan to make some
dough. Merchandising that is. Fun garb. Comfy
T's. Well the (Irst thinf you know the shirts
began to sell. Sink's klnfolk said: "This alnt so
bad tor Helll" They said: "Hooray tor Callforny
and all Its glam and glossl" So Blnky paid his
rent and he stayed right there In Los. Angeles,
that is. Swimming pools. Obscure cartoonists.
