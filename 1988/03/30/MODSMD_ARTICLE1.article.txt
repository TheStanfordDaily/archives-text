# Core list compromise may end impasse
## Western Culture debate crosses a hurdle 
### Alicia Kent Editorial staff 
Faculty members now teaching West
ern Culture have ironed out a compro
mise proposal that could end the two
year-long Area One debate when it is
presented to the Faculty Senate tomor
row.
However, other senate members
warned that the compromise proposal is
extremely fragile and speculated that it
will not be able to stand further modifi
cations.
Unveiled yesterday, the compromise
would replace the core list in all tracks
with common "elements" of texts, au
thors, themes or issues. The selection of
these common elements would be made
on a yearly basis by tenured professors
teaching Western Culture and track co
ordinators — the program's "regular fac
ulty."
The compromises worked out last week
are an attempt to bridge the central dif
ferences of opinion in the senate over
the issue of Western Culture.
The senate has for several months been
debating a proposal called Cultures, Ideas
and Values, that would abolish the core
list of readings and require greater rep
resentation of works by women and
minorities. Recently, the central obstacle
to approval of the CIV proposal has been
the abolition of the core list.
The compromise, a product of the cur
rent regular faculty and Assoc. History
Prof. Clayborne Carson, recommends
that "two friendly amendments be
adopted into the Culture, Ideas and
Values legislation."
The first amendment would "give sub

stantial attention to the issues of race,
gender and class during each academic
quarter, with at least one of these issues
addressed explicitly in at least one mtyor
reading in each quarter."
Carson wrote the amendment with
English Prof. William Chace, who has
been the center stage proponant of mod
ifying — but not abandoning — the core
list and whose January Chace proposal
has been the primary alternative to CIV.
The Carson-Chace amendment, accord
ing to Carson and Director of the Western
Culture Program Paul Robinson, would
be an important step in providing a com
mon intellectual experience in all tracks
because the tracks would at least share
three common themes.
The second amendment, drafted by
Carson and History Prof. Paul Seaver,
calls for a yearly discussion by the regular
faculty to agree on common elements to
be addressed in all tracks. This "common
intellectual experience" would not neces
sarily be a core list of books, but could
be an agreement on "common elements
— texts, authors, themes, or issues," ac
cording to the proposal.
The two amendments were received
with "virtual unanimity" by the current
regular faculty in a meeting on March
15, according to a letter written by Rob
inson, who chaired a preliminary meeting
on March 10.
In addition to the two amendments,
Robinson, a history professor, insisted
"in the exigencies of time" that the group
agree on six authors for the 1988-89 com
mon elements. This list of authors —
Plato, the Hebrew and Christian Bibles,
Augustine, Machiavelli, Rousseau and
Marx — was chosen because they are

"already widely used in the tracks, and
they offer a fairly even spread across the
chronological span of most tracks," Rob
inson wrote in his letter to Lieberman.
The ammended proposal would still in
clude the original CIV title and proposal
to include "works from the European
cultural-tradition and from at least one
of the non-European cultures that have
become components of our diverse Amer
ican society."
In writing the amendments, Carson
said the compromise attempts to address
concerns about a shared intellectual ex
perience, as well as concerns that the
Area One requirement include more
women and minority writers and themes
of cultural diversity.
"This is a unifying reform because it
was the one that was acceptable to the
people who teach the course," Carson
said. Among the current regular faculty,
the emergence of factions led to an emo
tionally charged Area One debate that
has prompted national interest.
But the compromise may be endan
gered by senate members such as Eco
nomics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, who feels
the compromise is "quite unstructured."
"The synthesis that has been arrived
upon is cheering, but I would have
preferred a more structured proposal,"
he said. Arrow said the idea of having a
common element in all Western Culture
tracks is impractical and could create
more disagreements than it solves.
Other possible dissenters share a view
more similar to Carson's, who said he
would prefer a common element of
themes or issues to tie the tracks to
gether, instead of a core list. "I'm dis
appointed that they chose the idea of a

core list as a basis for common intellec
tual experience," he said.
"There are changes (in the compro
mise) that I've heard about that may go
through the Faculty Senate," Carson
said. If such changes are made, "we would
start at square one. Two years would go
down the drain."
Carson said it would be a "disaster" if
part of the "package" of reforms were to
be modified because one side of the on
going Western Culture debate could feel
slighted because both sides have given

up much to reach the compromise."
"It is very difficult to come up with a
proposal to satisfy everyone's wishes,"
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones said. All of
the important components of the original
Cultures, Ideas and Values proposal are
contained in the compromise and that
"too much has gone into it (the compro
mise) to give it up," she said.
Jones questioned Carson's fears that
minor changes would doom the compro-

mise. She said there are not any
significant changes that need to
be made. "I hope people aren't so
rigid as to throw the whole thing
out" if changes are made, she said.
However, students including
Black Student Union President
Bill King and some faculty said
they feel the proposal is lacking
because the same people will
decide which common elements
to include from year to year.
King explained that women and
minority faculty will not be in
cluded in the decision-making
process because few women or
minorities teach in the Western
Culture track. Students will also
be excluded from the final
decision-making processes, he
added.
"There is nothing that allows
for serious input from other re
sources," King said. Western Cul
ture could stagnate without input

from people such as minority
leaders, feminist studies and Afro-
American studies professors, ac
cording to King. King said the
proposed list of six, white male
authors is a good example of how
the new requirement has already
escaped change.
But Robinson and Senate Chair
Gerald Lieberman called the
amendments "friendly" because
they attempt to bring together all
sides of the debate and to appease
the polarized factions. "It is an
attempt to come up with some
thing palatable to both sides,"
Lieberman said.
Robinson said he thinks the
amendments will be accepted by
both sides because the amended
CIV proposal is "very definitely a
compromise" — no side has won
and no side has lost.
According to Robinson, both
sides gave up substantial portions
of their demands. "Nobody on
either end was fully satisfied, but
I do not believe they are unhappy
with the two amendments," he
said.

"already widely used in the tracks, and

chronological span of most tracks," Rob
inson wrote in his letter to Lieberman.
The ammended proposal would still in
clude the original CIV title and proposal
to include "works from the European
cultural-tradition and from at least one
of the non-European cultures that have
become components of our diverse Amer
ican society."
In writing the amendments, Carson
said the compromise attempts to address
concerns about a shared intellectual ex
perience, as well as concerns that the
Area One requirement include more
women and minority writers and themes
of cultural diversity.
"This is a unifying reform because it
was the one that was acceptable to the
people who teach the course," Carson
said. Among the current regular faculty,
the emergence of factions led to an emo
tionally charged Area One debate that
has prompted national interest.
But the compromise may be endan
gered by senate members such as Eco
nomics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, who feels
the compromise is "quite unstructured."
"The synthesis that has been arrived
upon is cheering, but I would have
preferred a more structured proposal,"
he said. Arrow said the idea of having a
common element in all Western Culture
tracks is impractical and could create
more disagreements than it solves.
Other possible dissenters share a view
more similar to Carson's, who said he
would prefer a common element of
themes or issues to tie the tracks to
gether, instead of a core list. "I'm dis
appointed that they chose the idea of a

core list as a basis for common intellec
tual experience," he said.
"There are changes (in the compro
mise) that I've heard about that may go
through the Faculty Senate," Carson
said. If such changes are made, "we would
start at square one. Two years would go
down the drain."
Carson said it would be a "disaster" if
part of the "package" of reforms were to
be modified because one side of the on
going Western Culture debate could feel
slighted because both sides have given

up much to reach the compromise."
"It is very difficult to come up with a
proposal to satisfy everyone's wishes,"
Biology Prof. Patricia Jones said. All of
the important components of the original

contained in the compromise and that

mise. She said there are not any
significant changes that need to
be made. "I hope people aren't so
rigid as to throw the whole thing
out" if changes are made, she said.
However, students including
Black Student Union President
Bill King and some faculty said
they feel the proposal is lacking
because the same people will
decide which common elements
to include from year to year.
King explained that women and
minority faculty will not be in
cluded in the decision-making
process because few women or
minorities teach in the Western
Culture track. Students will also
be excluded from the final
decision-making processes, he
added.
"There is nothing that allows
for serious input from other re
sources," King said. Western Cul
ture could stagnate without input

from people such as minority
leaders, feminist studies and Afro-
American studies professors, ac
cording to King. King said the
proposed list of six, white male
authors is a good example of how
the new requirement has already
escaped change.
But Robinson and Senate Chair
Gerald Lieberman called the
amendments "friendly" because
they attempt to bring together all
sides of the debate and to appease
the polarized factions. "It is an
attempt to come up with some
thing palatable to both sides,"
Lieberman said.
Robinson said he thinks the
amendments will be accepted by
both sides because the amended
CIV proposal is "very definitely a
compromise" — no side has won
and no side has lost.
According to Robinson, both
sides gave up substantial portions
of their demands. "Nobody on
either end was fully satisfied, but
I do not believe they are unhappy
with the two amendments," he
said.
Faculty members now teaching West
ern Culture have ironed out a compro
mise proposal that could end the two
year-long Area One debate when it is
presented to the Faculty Senate tomor
row.
However, other senate members
warned that the compromise proposal is
extremely fragile and speculated that it
will not be able to stand further modifi
cations.
Unveiled yesterday, the compromise
would replace the core list in all tracks
with common "elements" of texts, au
thors, themes or issues. The selection of
these common elements would be made
on a yearly basis by tenured professors
teaching Western Culture and track co
ordinators — the program's "regular fac
ulty."
The compromises worked out last week
are an attempt to bridge the central dif
ferences of opinion in the senate over
the issue of Western Culture.
The senate has for several months been
debating a proposal called Cultures, Ideas
and Values, that would abolish the core
list of readings and require greater rep
resentation of works by women and
minorities. Recently, the central obstacle
to approval of the CIV proposal has been
the abolition of the core list.
The compromise, a product of the cur
rent regular faculty and Assoc. History
Prof. Clayborne Carson, recommends
that "two friendly amendments be
adopted into the Culture, Ideas and
Values legislation."
The first amendment would "give sub

stantial attention to the issues of race,
gender and class during each academic
quarter, with at least one of these issues
addressed explicitly in at least one mtyor
reading in each quarter."
Carson wrote the amendment with
English Prof. William Chace, who has
been the center stage proponant of mod
ifying — but not abandoning — the core
list and whose January Chace proposal
has been the primary alternative to CIV.
The Carson-Chace amendment, accord
ing to Carson and Director of the Western
Culture Program Paul Robinson, would
be an important step in providing a com
mon intellectual experience in all tracks
because the tracks would at least share
three common themes.
The second amendment, drafted by
Carson and History Prof. Paul Seaver,
calls for a yearly discussion by the regular
faculty to agree on common elements to
be addressed in all tracks. This "common
intellectual experience" would not neces
sarily be a core list of books, but could
be an agreement on "common elements
— texts, authors, themes, or issues," ac
cording to the proposal.
The two amendments were received
with "virtual unanimity" by the current
regular faculty in a meeting on March
15, according to a letter written by Rob
inson, who chaired a preliminary meeting
on March 10.
In addition to the two amendments,
Robinson, a history professor, insisted
"in the exigencies of time" that the group
agree on six authors for the 1988-89 com
mon elements. This list of authors —
Plato, the Hebrew and Christian Bibles,
Augustine, Machiavelli, Rousseau and
Marx — was chosen because they are

"already widely used in the tracks, and
they offer a fairly even spread across the
chronological span of most tracks," Rob
inson wrote in his letter to Lieberman.
