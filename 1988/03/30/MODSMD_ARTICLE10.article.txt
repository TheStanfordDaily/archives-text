# Apology

### 
Due to a technical error,
three lines of a sentence
were placed out of order in
an article in yesterday's Dai
ly. The sentence, in an ar
ticle on the dean's service
awards, should have read:
"(Vinton) Frost, president of
the Interfraternity Council
and and Phi Delta Theta fra
ternity and a senior in eco
nomics, was praised for his
initiation of discussions on
such delecate topics as ho
mophobia, racism and date
rape."
Unfortunately, the mis
placed text changed the
meaning of the sentence to
reflect poorly on Frost.
The Daily sincerely
apologizes to Frost.
