Swaggart banned from pulpit
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. — Television preacher
Jimmy Swaggart, who tearfully confessed last
month to unspecified sins involving a pros
titute, was ordered yesterday by his church
elders to stay out of the pulpit and off the
air for a minimum of one year.
In a recognition of the modern age of evan
gelism, terms of the suspension announced
here at headquarters of the Assemblies of God
denomination forbade the broadcast anywhere
in the world of Swaggart reruns or already
taped sermons awaiting distribution.
The action ended a chaotic month of indeci
sion and intramural bickering within the 1.2
million-member church over what to do with
the wayward Swaggart, easily its most pow
erful, popular — and profitable — minister.
Swaggart's suspension followed an unprece
dented two-day convocation of the church's
240-member General Presbytery, a private
meeting that participants said focused as much
on procedural matters as on Swaggart's alleged
dalliance with a prostitute outside New Or
leans.
The drama now returns to Swaggart's
domain. The one-time king ascendant of Amer
ican religious television must decide whether
his $150 million-a-year ministry can survive
without him while he submits to a two-year
program of "rehabilitation." The church has
requested that he agree to the terms "in writ
ing" within 30 days.
Key leaders to meet Jackson
WASHINGTON — A group of key Demo
cratic loyalists, jittery over the Rev. Jesse Jack
son's successes and the potential problems the
black civil rights leader poses for the party,
will meet with him here today to urge party
unity in the 1988 general election.
Jackson, now dueling with Gov. Michael Du
kakis of Massachusetts for the lead in the
Democratic presidential race, requested the
meeting and the Democrats quickly agreed in
order to deal early with problems they feel
could weaken their nominee in the fall election.
Many Democrats worry that if Jackson
winds up on the party's ticket, either as the
nominee or the running mate, it will not only
doom the party's chances in the presidential
election, but could cause a significant number
of whites to abandon the Democrats and join
the Republican party.
On the other hand, any concerted effort to
deny Jackson a place on the ticket could also
be costly to the party.
Former Democratic Chairman John White,
stressing that party unity will be the
subject of today's session with Jackson, said,
"If there's a stop-Jackson movement in this
party, I think we'll be taking a poison pill."
House panel slashes MX funds
WASHINGTON — The House Armed Serv
ices Committee, in the first test of con
gressional support for President Reagan's
revised strategic weapons program, yesterday
slashed funds for a rail version of the MX
missile, raised the amount requested for the
small Midgetman missile from $200 million
to $500 million and voted to keep funds for
his Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) missile
defense research program at the current level.
While the panel marked up the fiscal 1989
defense bill authorizing $299.5 billion for the
military, Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala.,
ranking committee Republican, said he "re
luctantly supported" keeping SDI funding the
same rather than increasing it as Reagan re
quested. Reagan sought $4.4 billion; the com
mittee authorized $3.7 billion, not counting
money for military construction and nuclear
devices. "We won't do serious damage to the
program," Dickinson said of the cut.
