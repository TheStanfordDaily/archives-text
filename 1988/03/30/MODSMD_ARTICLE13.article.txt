# Dole calls it quits, endorses Bush
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Surrounded by
colleagues and supporters, Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole formally bowed out of
the Republican presidential race yes
terday after a week of uncertainty, his
public pride undiminished as he sur
rendered to George Bush's inevitable
nomination.
"I don't like to lose. I make no apol
ogy for that," declared the normally
combative Dole, his voice firm and ab
sent of bitterness. "I have been beaten
before and no doubt will again, but I
have never been defeated — and never
will be.
"But," he added, "one thing you
learn to do pretty well in our business
is to count. You come to trust your
instincts to tell you when it's over. In
my heart, I know that that time is
now."
As Dole closed his five-month cam
paign in the ornate Senate Caucus
Room, he urged Republicans to unite
behind Bush, with whom Dole has
scrapped repeatedly.
"I congratulate George Bush and
wish him well in November," Dole
said. "The bottom line is keeping the
White House Republican — that's the
bottom line."

The senator, whose campaign
peaked a mere seven weeks ago with
a victory in the lowa caucuses before
disintegrating in the snows of New
Hampshire, said that he was "ready
to do all I can to elect Republicans in
November, and doing all I can for our
nominee, George Bush."
Dole's withdrawal virtually ensures
the nomination for Bush, who within
several weeks is expected to capture
the delegates necessary to earn a first
ballot nomination at the Republican
national convention this summer.
Only former religious broadcaster Pat
Robertson remains in the Republican
race, and he has acknowledged Bush's
victory while continuing to campaign.
Bush was on the road in central
Wisconsin when word arrived that his
long fight with Dole was over.
His first act was to call Dole and
thank him "for the very gracious state
ment he made."
Both Dole's remarks and his sur
roundings yesterday underscored his
attachment to the Senate.
Senators, Republican and Democrat,
surrounded Dole and applauded
mightily as he ended his candidacy.

Ten minutes before he announced his
retirement from the field, Dole strolled
through the Senate chamber, slapping
backs and joking with the half dozen
or so Republicans on the floor.
As he entered the room to offer his
farewell, Dole raised his left arm in
triumph and came to the podium,
where he cracked, "We're not gonna
say anything mean about anybody. It'll
be a non-partisan event. Not going to
attack any Republicans."

The senator's family — his wife
Elizabeth Dole and his daughter Robin
Dole — flanked him as he spoke.
Nearby stood campaign manager Bill
Brock, weeping.
The withdrawal ended a rambling
and disorganized campaign that
trundled across the nation with little
strategy other than what Dole could
come up with in the privacy of his
traveling car or charter airplane.
The campaign ended with the prob
lems that had dogged it from the start
still obvious. Running against the in
cumbent vice president to a still
popular chief executive, Dole was un
able to hone a message significantly
different from that of Bush. The two
men, despite their vast personal dif
ferences, were still two pragmatic con
servatives with similar views courting
essentially the same Republican audi
ence.
Dole's campaign press secretary,
Mari Maseng, said the senator decided
Monday night to formally withdraw.
"He's been talking about the possibil
ity for several days," she said. "As he
has done everything, he did this on
his own timetable."
