# Dukakis wins Connecticut
## 
### 
WASHINGTON -
Massachusetts Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis, whose
campaign for the Dem
ocratic presidential
nomination was blunted
by losses in Illinois and
Michigan, easily won
the Connecticut pri
mary yesterday to boost
his embattled candidacy

before crucial contests in Wisconsin and
New York.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose
landslide victory in Michigan on Satur
day transformed the Democratic race,
ran a distant second. Jackson swept the
black vote, as he has all year, and carried
almost a quarter of the white vote, one
of the highest percentages he has
received from whites to date. According
to network exit polls, he ran best among
college-educated white voters. Tennes
see Sen. Albert Gore, Jr., who invested
time and money in Connecticut, ran far
behind Dukakis and Jackson.
With 79 percent of the precincts re
ported, Dukakis had 58 percent of the
vote, Jackson 28 percent, Gore 8 percent
and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who ig

nored the state, 1 percent.
On the Republican side, Vice Presi
dent Bush crushed all opposition. As
Connecticut voters were going to the
polls, Bush's last major competitor, Sen.
Robert Dole, R-Kan., withdrew from the
GOP contest. With 71 percent of the
precincts reported, Bush had 71 percent,
Dole 20 percent and former television
evangelist Pat Robertson, the lone active
candidate opposing Bush and Rep. Jack
Kemp, R-N.Y., who quit the campaign
earlier and endorsed Bush this week,
each had 3 percent.
Dukakis' victory gave him a clean
sweep in the six New England states
this year. "We're very pleased," said
Susan Estrich, the Dukakis campaign
manager. "The voters of Connecticut
have expressed confidence that Mike Du
kakis is the candidate with the values
and experience to beat George Bush and
take charge of our economic future."
Exit polls showed Dukakis winning in
every demographic group except blacks.
In a significant finding, ABC News exit
polls showed that a substantial propor
tion of Connecticut Democratic primary
voters would defect to Bush if Jackson
wins the Democratic nomination.
