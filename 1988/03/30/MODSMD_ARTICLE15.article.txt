# Top Meese aides quit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Depart
ment of Justice's No. 2 official
and the head of its criminal divi
sion resigned in unison yesterday
in what associates said was an
effort to distance themselves from
allegations of impropriety and
wrongdoing involving Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111.
Deputy Attorney General Ar
nold Burns and Assistant Attor
ney General William Weld were
said to be frustrated over "harm
to the department" resulting from
nine months of criminal investi
gations of Meese's conduct in of
fice with no sign that he would
resign or any other quick resolu
tion to the problem.
Burns and Weld went to the
White House directly with their
resignations before informing
Meese, a marked departure from
standard government practice.
The two officials met with White
House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker at his home around 7 a.m.
yesterday and gave him their
resignations "in escrow."
They then took their decision
to the usually unflappable Meese,
who sources said was shocked.

Burns, who built a thriving
New York law practice and joined
the department only 18 months
ago, first began discussing the
possibility of resigning this spring
in January, according to depart
ment officials. He was said to have
become increasingly fearful that
he would be tarnished by criticism
of Meese's conduct.
"He came here with a reputa
tion, and he wants to leave with
it intact," one official said of
Burns, who has no immediate job
plans.
As for Weld, he was convinced
that "the top guy had to go, and
when the top guy didn't, he did,"
one source said.
The departure of Burns and
Weld, which marks the biggest
department shakeup since the
resignations 15 years ago of At
torney General Elliot Richardson
and Deputy Attorney General
William Rucklelshaus in what
later became known as the "Sat
urday Night Massacre," is certain
to intensify pressure on Meese to
step aside.
