# House leaders agree on Contra aid package
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — House Demo
cratic and Republican leaders, after
months of intense bickering over U.S.
policy in Central America, agreed yes
terday on a package of about $50 mil
lion in non-military assistance that
would sustain the Nicaraguan resis
tance during the current peace talks
with the Sandinista government.
The legislation, which is scheduled
for a vote in the House today and in
the Senate tomorrow, was drafted in
response to President Reagan's argu
ment that the Nicaraguan government
cannot be forced to make concessions
in the peace talks if the United States
unilaterally halts funding for the anti-
Sandinista rebels.
Although some details are not yet
resolved, negotiators said that the
measure would provide almost $20
million for food, clothing and other
nonmilitary assistance to the Contras
over the next six months; about $1.5

million to provide the Contras with
new communications equipment; al
most $20 million for Nicaraguan
children who were wounded or left
homeless by the seven-year civil war
and about $10 million for a commis
sion that is overseeing the current 60-
day truce in Nicaragua.
The package was the result of two
days of negotiations between top Dem
ocratic and Republican leaders in the
House. The two parties had been hope
lessly divided over the issue of Contra
aid until last week, when the Sandi
nista government and the Contras
signed a 60-day truce agreement. The
truce agreement specifically allows for
continued U.S. non-military aid to the
Contras.
Over the last two months, the House
has rejected two other aid packages
— one authored by the White House
that would have revived direct military
assistance to the Contras and the other

a package of strictly non-military aid
put forth by the Democrats. The Con
tras have received no U.S. assistance
since Feb. 29.
Although Republicans did not insist
that this package include military aid,
as they have in the past, the GOP
leadership demanded assurances from
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, that the
Democratic-controlled House will
promptly consider sending more weap
ons if the current peace talks break
down. In response, Wright wrote a
letter to Reagan pledging to give timely
consideration to a military aid request
under those circumstances.
The proposed legislation specifies
that the new Contra aid will be fun
neled through the Agency for Inter
national Development — not the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency, which previ
ously has been entrusted with dis
tributing military aid to the Contras.
Liberal Democrats have staunchly op

posed any CIA role in the process since
it was learned last year that agency
personnel had secretly helped supply
the Contras with military equipment
during 1985 and 1986, when such as
sistance was banned by Congress.
Despite the apparent bipartisanship
in the negotiations, the agreement by
no means settles the underlying quar
rel between Republicans and Demo
crats on the issue of Contra aid. Dem
ocrats have long argued that U.S. aid
was prolonging the war in Nicaragua.
Under terms of the current truce,
the assistance will be delivered by a
"neutral party" to be selected by the
Contras and approved by a special
commission headed by Joao Baena
Soares, secretary-general of the Or
ganization of American States, and
Miguel Obando y Bravo, mediator in
talks between the Contras and the
Sandinistas.
