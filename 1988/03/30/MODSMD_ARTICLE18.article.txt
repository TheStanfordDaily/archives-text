## Shortage felt here 
### 
THE NURSING STRIKE that
almost happened at Stanford
Hospital has brought home
a critical national problem.
America's antiquated view of the
nursing profession is creating a
dangerous shortage of nurses in
the nation's hospitals.
When the Stanford Medical Cen
ter had to cut its budget, the nurs
ing staff took a wage cut. No mat
ter what the circumstances, man
agement should not have allowed
the understaffed, overworked
nurses to become underpaid.
Stanford Medical Center's new
nursing contract grudgingly rec
tified the situation. Overtime and
on-call pay was increased, and
seniority pay was instituted.
However, the new contract does
not reward nurses for the skill dif
ferentials within the various med
ical areas. The rewarding of in
creased specialization is another
way to increase the profession's
attractiveness.
It is time that the view of nurs
ing be brought into the 21st cen
tury. For too long, nursing has
been seen as a job for women and
women only. The medical industry
has yet to realize that nursing has
had to change rapidly in order to
keep with the equally rapid
changes in medical technology.
First, nurses are no longer only
women. Although women still com
prise the majority of nurses, men
are begining to be drawn to nurs
ing.
Nursing is also no longer a wom
an's best choice for a career.
Today's woman may likely be

found in an investment bank, a
major corporation or her own busi
ness.
Further, nursing today requires
highly trained specialists. Nurses
are required to focus in very tech
nical medical fields which require
continual education and training
to keep pace.
All this means that the medical
industry no longer has a captive,
minimally trained labor pool of
women from which to draw its
nurses. The nurses of today are
professionals who deserve compen
sation commensurate with their
necessary skills and training.
Although it does not completely
rectify the crisis, Stanford Medical
Center's new contract has at
tempted to correct this inadequate
compensation of nurses. An overall
wage and benefit increase in the
nursing profession is the first step
in ending the nursing shortage.
But more needs to be done.
In order to draw talented indi
viduals into the profession, hospi
tals and other health care institu
tions must offer competitive com
pensation for their nurses.
Health care management must
realize that nursing staffs are the
real determinants of quality health
care. Management must treat
nursing professionals as profes
sionals â€” not as wage laborers.
This nation cannot allow the
quality of its health to collapse be
cause our outmoded thinking
denies nurses the compensation
and conditions befitting their socie
tal role. A great awakening is ne
cessary in this country to halt this
current march toward disaster.
