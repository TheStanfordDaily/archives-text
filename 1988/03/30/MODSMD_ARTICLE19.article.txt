## Eliminate poverty to eradicate the drug problem 
### 
Anyone who has thumbed
through the most recent issue of
Newsweek magazine is likely to
be left with an uneasy feeling in his or
her stomach. The cover story detailed
the current drug problem in this coun
try and painted a bleak picture of the
violence in our cities, most of it gang
related.
Gangs are becoming more aggressive.
Armed with Uzis and AK-47 automatic
rifles, individuals have committed
homicide in broad daylight and in
crowded public places.
The drug gangs of today rival the
mafia and are similar to it in many
ways, with one exception: Today's
gangs are far more violent. The
ferocity of their crimes is without

precedent in this country.
Yet, the White House has failed to
address the problem at its source, the
plight of our inner-city poor. The
Reagan administration has stated, on a
number of occasions, that poverty is
being effectively dealt with. Yet it has
canceled or undercut virtually every
domestic welfare program.
Unemployment among teenage
minorities has risen substantially since
the beginning of this decade. Not
surprisingly, many of these youths
have turned to a life of drug
trafficking and crime.
The correlation between economic
deprivation and crime is well substan
tiated. During the oil-glut of the early
1980s, for example, much hardship was

brought to states like Texas and
Louisiana, where oil production was a
primary source of income. During this
same time, crimes of all types in
creased dramatically in these areas.
In order to appreciate the situation,
one could observe firsthand the prob
lems which the poor must confront.
The summer before I came to Stan
ford, I had a volunteer job in a subur
ban area of Chicago known as North
Chicago. There I saw the terrible
conditions which some of our poorest
families lived in.
Later that same summer, my two
brothers were viciously attacked by a
gang of black youths near that same
area. It was then that I fully realized
what desperate and bitter people are

capable of doing.
Supposedly, this is a land of equal
opportunity. Yet in reality, this is a
myth. A white male raised in an af
fluent family will have more opportu
nity available to him than a black
male raised in an inner-city ghetto.
Our poor have special needs that go
beyond what most of us are willing to
recognize. It may not seem totally fair,
but if we are willing to meet some of
these special needs we may very well
see a decline in the number of drug
gangs and drug-related crimes. Then
we may be able to reverse a trend
which is taking a heavy toll on this
nation's spirit and vitality.
