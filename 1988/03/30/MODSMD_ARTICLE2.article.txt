# University curbs smokers
## Outdoor smoking restricted 
### John Griffin 
Smoking is now banned at all outdoor campus
events with arranged seating, as a result of broad
restrictions adopted by University officials this
month.
At a joint meeting on March 2, the Adminis
trative Council and the Dean's Council banned
smoking in all arranged seating areas at outdoor
programs and events. A smoking area, away from
normal seating, may be designated at Commence
ment, conferences, sports events, lectures and
other programs.
At other events without arranged seating,
deans and vice presidents may permit smoking
in up to one third of the area. These events
include Frost Ampitheater concerts and political
rallies.
Outdoor eating areas such as the Tresidder
patio are also affected. In no more than one third
of these areas will smoking be allowed.
Some students questioned the fairness of the
smoking ban in arranged seating. "Why not have
smoking and non-smoking sections?" asked grad
uate student Harry Papasotiriou.
Jackie Miller, administrative assistant in the
Provost's Office and member of the Ad Hoc Com
mittee on Smoking Guidelines, said, "Our main
concern is health." She cited medical research
about the dangers of cigarette smoke to non
smokers and community complaints as causes of
Stanford's regulations.
Miller said the recent restrictions make Stan
ford the leader among universities in restricting
smoking. Although UCLA Hospital and the Uni
versity of Maryland have extensive indoor bans
on smoking, Miller said she knew of no other

university with comparable outdoor smoking re
strictions.
The two University councils prohibited
smoking in many indoor areas in 1985, at the
recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee on
Smoking Regulations. At that time the University
decided that the goal of its smoking policy would
be to acheive "an environment as close to smoke
free as practically possible."

patio yesterday, expostulates on the plight of
his comrades who are slowly being snuffed
out at Stanford.
The Ad Hoc Committee is com
posed of seven staff and faculty
members. The president and vice
presidents make up the Adminis
trative Council; the Dean's Coun
cil is composed of all the deans.
No student sat on either council.
Enforcement of the smoking re
strictions is the task of both the
community at large and super
visors of events and facilities, ac
cording to an official draft
memorandum discussing the
smoking policy and guidelines.
Alejandro Martinez, acting di
rector of Health Promotion at
Cowell Student Health Center,

said a 1986 Cowell survey found
that six percent of Stanford stu
dents smoke.
Smokers on campus had mixed
reactions to the new guidelines.
"It's fine if they limit smoking
areas as long as they don't make
smokers outcasts," said Jarl
Hegge, a student who visited
Tresidder yesterday. "We're prob
ably a diminishing interest group,
because now people know the
health risks. Smoking can be quite
annoying if you don't smoke."
Art Jenkins, another Tresidder
visitor, disagreed. "Anti-smoking
feelings are just a fad. In 20 years
everyone will be smoking again,"
Jenkins predicted, saying he ap
proves of non-smoking sections
but dislikes the outdoor ban.
