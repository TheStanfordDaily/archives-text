# University curbs smokers
## Outdoor smoking restricted 
### John Griffin 
Smoking is now banned at all outdoor campus
events with arranged seating, as a result of broad
restrictions adopted by University officials this
month.
At a joint meeting on March 2, the Adminis
trative Council and the Dean's Council banned
smoking in all arranged seating areas at outdoor
programs and events. A smoking area, away from
normal seating, may be designated at Commence
ment, conferences, sports events, lectures and
other programs.
At other events without arranged seating,
deans and vice presidents may permit smoking
in up to one third of the area. These events
include Frost Ampitheater concerts and political
rallies.
Outdoor eating areas such as the Tresidder
patio are also affected. In no more than one third
of these areas will smoking be allowed.
Some students questioned the fairness of the
smoking ban in arranged seating. "Why not have
smoking and non-smoking sections?" asked grad
uate student Harry Papasotiriou.
Jackie Miller, administrative assistant in the
Provost's Office and member of the Ad Hoc Com
mittee on Smoking Guidelines, said, "Our main
concern is health." She cited medical research
about the dangers of cigarette smoke to non
smokers and community complaints as causes of
Stanford's regulations.
Miller said the recent restrictions make Stan
ford the leader among universities in restricting
smoking. Although UCLA Hospital and the Uni
versity of Maryland have extensive indoor bans
on smoking, Miller said she knew of no other

university with comparable outdoor smoking re
strictions.
The two University councils prohibited
smoking in many indoor areas in 1985, at the
recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee on
Smoking Regulations. At that time the University
decided that the goal of its smoking policy would
be to acheive "an environment as close to smoke
free as practically possible."
