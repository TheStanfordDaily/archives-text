# Public schools fail to encourage voting
## 
### 
We in Palo Alto are often reminded,
especially by members of the school
board and other officials, of the supe
rior quality of the public school educa
tion provided to Palo Alto's children.
On March 15, I had an interesting
experience. As a peace activist, I sup
port the presidential candidacy of Jesse
Jackson.
I took some leaflets advertising a
rally at Pittsburgh on March 19, at
which Jackson spoke, to hand out to
students at Palo Alto High School in
their lunch hour.
I was careful to stand opposite the
school in the Town & Country parking
lot. My 50 leaflets were quickly distrib
uted to crowds of young people, who
seemed friendly and, in some cases,
enthusiastically supportive of Jesse
Jackson.
I then ventured across into the

campus, daring to bring such evil and
subversive items as voter registration
cards to give to seniors who would be
turning 18 by June 7.
I quickly attracted the hostile notice
of two faculty members and a student
body representative. I was bidden to
move off the campus as I did not have
permission to distribute anything.
I happen to own a little of that
school. I graduated from Paly High in
1950. Both my children are graduates.
I am a taxpayer. As far as I under
stand the matter, the public schools
are public property, and they belong to
the citizens of the school districts. Paly
High is not a private school.
I tried in vain to explain that some
of the children might appreciate receiv
ing voter registration cards in a
neutral and non-partisan manner. As
18-year-old citizens in our society, they
should be encouraged to vote.
If I had been assured that the high
school had vigorously taken up the
burden of distributing voter registra
tion cards to those students of voting
age, I would have then and there

thanked the two faculty members and
the student government representative
and begged their pardon for my intru
sion where my services were not
needed.
But it seemed clear to me that,
among our highly sophisticated and
educated students, voting should never
be mentioned, presidential campaigns
should never be discussed and the
study of American democracy — irra
tional and capricious as it is, on which
the fate of our planet precariously
depends — must never be a part of
our children's education.
