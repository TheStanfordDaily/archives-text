# 'Watersports' term may be misleading
## 
### 
The glossary section in the March 3
issue of The Student Body, published
by Cowell Student Health Center as an
advertising insert to The Daily, con
tained an item on the relative risk of

certain sexual behaviors.
This item was not entirely under
stood by all readers of The Daily. It
involved the use of the term
watersports in relation to sexual be
haviors.
This is a euphemism for the use of
urine in sexual play. No other refer
ence was intended.
