## Candidacy wide open 
### 
AS I AND MANY others basked in
the Hawaiian sun this past week,
Jesse Jackson was basking in an
other type of glow after his stunning win
in the Michigan caucuses. It's tough to
say who enjoyed their week more.
By crushing Mike Dukakis in both Il
linois and Michigan, Jesse Jackson took
the air of inevitability out of the Massa
chusetts governor's presidential cam
paign.
For the past two weeks, Dukakis has
been trying desperately to winnow the
Democratic field by knocking off A 1 Gore,
Paul Simon and Richard Gephardt. Now,
Dukakis himself looks like he's on the
ropes, unable to appeal to working-class
people and unable to develop a cohesive
message.
Jackson's win in Michigan was nothing
short of incredible. No one could lay claim
to "favorite son" status there, and with
the gloves off, Jackson whipped Dukakis
soundly, winning a commanding 55 per
cent of the Michigan vote to Dukakis' 28
percent.
While winning over 95 percent of the
vote in some predominantly black Mich
igan neighorhoods, Jackson also won big
in several predominantly white cities like
Grand Rapids, Lansing, Kalamazoo and
Ann Arbor.
In short, Jackson won nearly one-third
of Michigan's white vote. Call Mike Du
kakis "Spaulding." He got nothing, and
you know the rest.
Jesse Jackson has nearly as many
delegates right now as Mike Dukakis. As

Dukakis himself has said, "Now there
are two front-runners." Thanks, Mike.
You're pleased. No, you are.
Think about this potentially explosive
situation: What if Jackson has more
delegates than Dukakis after June 7, the
last primary day, which includes such
big states as California and New Jersey
(by no means Dukakis stronghold^)?
While neither man would have a
majority of delegates, how could the Dem
ocrats simply deny Jackson a spot on the
ticket? Would they give him a spot,
thereby certainly spelling defeat for the
party against the Republicans (let's be
blunt!), or would they deny the man with
the most votes a spot? Please pass the
Excedrin!
Democrats deserve this crap. Ever since
1984's calamitous collapse, the party has
been talking about "moving to the right,"
toward the mainstream. Now look. The
candidates sans Jackson are dwarfs today
just like they were a year ago, each one
with his own liberal amalgam of defects.
It's not surprising Mike Dukakis hasn't
caught fire, because he is absolutely the
most boring man alive.
There's no message out there, except
for Jackson's, replete with opportunity,
an end to drugs and economic empower
ment for the presently disadvantaged.
While he sounds like a European Social
Democrat when you get right down to
it, Jackson's message is poetry and prose,
While Dukakis' reads like a Chemistry
31 text — all facts and a big snooze.
You'll be hearing lots about Mario

Cuomo this week, and here's why: With
Dukakis such a boring technocrat, Dem
ocrats are longing for a thoughtful, pas
sionate messenger who is still electable
with policies more moderate than Jack
son's. That leaves Cuomo.
With the New York primary coming
up on April 19, everyone expected a
Cuomo endorsement of neighbor Dukakis
this week. Then came Michigan.
Cuomo is laying low right now, pon
dering his next move. What will he do?
Will he endorse Dukakis, alienating Jack
son? If Jackson should win New York,
Cuomo will be politically and personally
embarrassed.
Will he endorse Jackson? If he does
and Dukakis wins, goodbye Secretary of
State Cuomo. Or will he enter the race
himself, only to discover that once you
join the fray, you suddenly don't stand
so tall and you yourself become a dwarf?
In any case, being a political observer
couldn't be any more fun than it is right
now. Unless, of course, I could keep ob
serving politics (among other things!) on
the sands of Waikiki. Aloha, Aku!

Democrats deserve this crap. Ever since
1984's calamitous collapse, the party has
been talking about "moving to the right,"
toward the mainstream. Now look. The
candidates sans Jackson are dwarfs today
just like they were a year ago, each one
with his own liberal amalgam of defects.
It's not surprising Mike Dukakis hasn't
caught fire, because he is absolutely the
most boring man alive.
There's no message out there, except
for Jackson's, replete with opportunity,
an end to drugs and economic empower
ment for the presently disadvantaged.
While he sounds like a European Social
Democrat when you get right down to
it, Jackson's message is poetry and prose,
While Dukakis' reads like a Chemistry
31 text — all facts and a big snooze.
You'll be hearing lots about Mario

Cuomo this week, and here's why: With
Dukakis such a boring technocrat, Dem
ocrats are longing for a thoughtful, pas
sionate messenger who is still electable
with policies more moderate than Jack
son's. That leaves Cuomo.
With the New York primary coming
up on April 19, everyone expected a
Cuomo endorsement of neighbor Dukakis
this week. Then came Michigan.
Cuomo is laying low right now, pon
dering his next move. What will he do?
Will he endorse Dukakis, alienating Jack
son? If Jackson should win New York,
Cuomo will be politically and personally
embarrassed.
Will he endorse Jackson? If he does
and Dukakis wins, goodbye Secretary of
State Cuomo. Or will he enter the race
himself, only to discover that once you
join the fray, you suddenly don't stand
so tall and you yourself become a dwarf?
In any case, being a political observer
couldn't be any more fun than it is right
now. Unless, of course, I could keep ob
serving politics (among other things!) on
the sands of Waikiki. Aloha, Aku!
