## Stanford grad battles AIDS with positive mind

sarcoma lesions.
After watching the lesions on
his body disappear over a period
of six months, Nungesser credits
his phenomenal health to the fact
that he rejected all the fatalistic
advice the medical community
gave him at the time of his diag
nosis.
Many people with AIDS or
other terminal diseases "just lay
down and die after diagnosis. I
don't think that's necessary all
the time," he says.
Most of the doctors who Nun
gesser saw after that diagnosis
said they could do nothing else
but try to make him comfortable.
One doctor, also a Stanford
graduate, advised Nungesser to

In 1983, Lon Nungesser, then
a recent Stanford graduate, was
given a death sentence to which
he refused to acquiesce.
A doctor at Cowell Student
Health Center diagnosed him
with Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome, a disease that had only
been discovered two years earlier,
and gave him three to six months
to live.
Today, Nungesser believes he
may be the longest survivor with
out treatments of a plague that
has claimed the lives of so many
of his friends and once covered
his own body with 14 Karposi's

take part in an experimental
treatment program that would re
quire him to stay in bed and un
dergo extensive testing for up to
three months. When he refused,
the doctor asked, "Well, what
have you got to lose?" and Nun
gesser replied, "My life!"
After another doctor could only
suggest that he undergo different
types of chemotherapy treatment,
Nungesser said he "began to see
that maybe no treatment was the
best idea." Five years later, he
has never been treated for the
disease.
Nungesser's response is unique
because he is fighting AIDS on
his own terms and inventing his
own treatments — unlike most
patients who faithfully follow
their doctors' advice.
According to Nungesser, his
motivation came from anger. "I
was angry that at 30 years old I
was facing death and no one could
do a damn thing about it. I held
on to that anger and used it to
mobilize myself to gather infor
mation.
"I grabbed everything I could
to read about [the treatments pro
posed to him] and realized that
these doctors were experimenting.
I said to the doctors, 'You're ex
perimenting. I know everything
about experimenting.' "
"I've offended a lot of doctors
by being alive," Nungesser says
laughing. "Now they're starting
to call me and ask for advice."
Indeed, Nungesser's own inves
tigations led him to reject treat
ments such as the AZT drug,
without which few, if any, people
with AIDS would feel comfortable
facing the disease.
Nungesser's approach has been
to strengthen his immune system
which is threatened by the dis
ease. Because he believes AZT,
chemotherapy, radiation therapy
or recent anti-viral drugs "irritate
the underlying system and are
toxic to the entire body," he
decided not to take any treatment.
AZT causes "severe anemia and
other blood problems," according
to an article in the September
1987 issue of the Journal of the

American Medical Association.
"I have not taken any suppres
sive treatments, nothing anti
viral which would cause damage
to internal organs," he says.
Instead, Nungesser works to
cultivate what he describes as his
"most intense will to live" by
fighting depression and creating
a positive environment to live in.
Aerobics, vitamin treatments
and daily time spent in "serene
contemplation" are all part of
Nungesser's plan.
In addition, Nungesser has "a
lot of social support and a lover
I've been with for seven years.
I'm with people who are positive
and eliminate people who are
negative."
Nungesser has approached his
treatment "from every angle,"
and is "really cautious about pin
ning [his good health] on any one
thing."
When he advises other people
with AIDS or terminal diseases,
he tells them to change their
larger approach, rather than
focusing on specifics. "My philos
ophy is to do what's best for you
and hope for the best," he says.
This "empowers people to look
back to the toughest times in their
lives and find out what it took to
get through them."
In fact, reaching the largest
group of people possible with this
message has been one of Nunges
ser's driving forces.
He has already written one
book about AIDS, "Epidemic of
Courage: Facing AIDS," and his
second book, "Notes On Living
Until We Say Goodbye" will be
released on April 18. Nungesser,
who has also written a book on
human sexuality which focuses on
the development of gay identity,
is currently working on a third
book dealing with AIDS, "The
Times of My Life," a fictional ac
count of teenagers facing terminal
illnesses.
While "Epidemic of Courage" is
a compilation of interviews with
AIDS patients and their families,
" 'Notes On Living' draws very
much on my own experience and

helps people to deal with their
experiences," he says.
Since he started work on "Notes
On Living," Nungesser said he
has received many awards for fi
nancial support, including gifts
from several New York-based
writers associations such as the
Carnegie Fund, the Authors
League, the American Academy
of Arts and Letters and PEN
American Center. Nungesser has
received most of these awards be
cause he is a "writer who has a
disability."
With "Notes On Living," Nun
gesser said he is not trying to
"scare people into health, but to
give them the tools they need."
Nungesser says that while he

Nungesser for over 12 years on
different projects, describes
"Notes On Living" as a "powerful
drama."
"Nungesser shares his personal
wisdom and the psychological
strategies developed to cope with
the imminent reality of death,
whatever its cause, and whenever
its due date," Zimbardo wrote.
According to Zimbardo, Nun
gesser's personal maintenance
plan is particularly effective be
cause he combines practical
health practices with helping
others. "Counseling helps you get
out of your 'Why me, dear
Lord?' " state of mind, "and my
sense is that is a health-giving
thing," he said.

knows the dangers of false hope,
he tries to teach people to test
the outer limits of possibility and
not give in to a terminal diagnosis.
In a quote from "Notes On
Living," Nungesser writes, "I do
desire survival, but I don't have
to have absolute control in order
to have authentic hope. ... A
diagnosis is an event to be adapted
to, not a death sentence to be
compliant with."
According to Nungesser, the
book appeals to a "much broader
audience" than just people with
AIDS, but applies to all people
who face serious or terminal ill
nesses. "I know women with
breast cancer who find it very
helpful," he says.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo, who has collaborated with

"I've accomplished more of my
goals in terms of reaching as
many people as possible in a help
ful and intimate way — more so
than I ever imagined," Nungesser
says.
In a passage of "Notes on
Living," Nungesser describes the
time after he was diagnosed when
he "planted vegetables that would
take longer to harvest than I was
supposed to live."
Putting stock in those plants
was like "challenging Mother Na
ture to a duel — that preserving
life was a mutual goal," he writes.
So far, with a successful writing
career and his health intact, Nun
gesser's harvest has been bounti
ful. "I weighed 195 pounds when
I was diagnosed. I weigh 205 now.
I'm so embarrassed."
