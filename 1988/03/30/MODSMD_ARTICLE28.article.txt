Spring has sprung:
Ah... Spring quarter. Sun filled days, outdoor
parties, picnics in the Oval — "these are a
few of my favorite things." And before all that
reading hits, why not seize the moment and
have some fun?
Let the parties begin:
Spring quarter started off with a bang Mon
day night at Sterling Quad with Quadrophenia,
which turned out to be one of the most crowded
Stanford parties which ever carded for beer.
Even LSJUMB and the Dollies were in at
tendance. But the fun doesn't stop there.
Friday night is the Kappa Sig Spring
Blowout, which I was assured will be a grand
event. Saturday is Apo"KA"lypse at the KA
house (where else with a name like that?).
Get your tickets now:
It's not too early to buy tickets for the
Ram's Head spring production of "Jesus Christ
Superstar." Ticket are available in White Plaza
until April 23 for $6.
This is IT, seniors:
Don't let your last spring quarter slip by
without saying farewell to your favorite
nightspots. Senior Pub Night is at the Vortex
this Thursday night.
Some spectacular dance:
The U-Zulu South African Dance Theater
will be performing "their simple yet elegant
presentation of songs and dances" as part of
the Lively Arts calendar for the spring. Catch
the show Friday, April 1, at Memorial
Auditorium, 8 p.m. Tickets are available
through the Tressider Ticket Office.
"Unsung Classics":
Ingmar Bergman's last film, "Fanny and
Alexander," will be shown as part of the Sun
day Film Series at the Bechtel International
Center. Focusing on the interactions in the
life of a large Swedish family at the turn of
the century, this is a must-see. Catch it Sunday
at the I-Center, 8 p.m.
The tradition continues ...
Just when you thought it was safe to come
back to Stanford, Sunday Flicks is back with
the classic, "The Running Man," starring Ar
nold Schwarzeneggar in his critically acclaimed
role.
