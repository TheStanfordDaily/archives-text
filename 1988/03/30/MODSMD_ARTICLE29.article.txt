# Top 20
## '80s albums likely to become classics 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
At long last, following in the tradi
tion of Casey Kasem, David Letter
man, MTV and radio stations every
where, list fever has finally reached
the pages of The Daily.
With the 1980s waning rapidly, it
seems an appropriate time to take a
look back on the music this turbulent
decade's artists have produced and the
new genre of Progressive Rock/New
Wave/New Music that their works en
compass.
Picking as small a number as 20 is
an excruciatingly frustrating endeav
or, considering the mass of albums
produced and the number of really
good releases. However, by restricting
the category to works that should be
considered classics in future years, the
task becomes a makeable do.
So, without further delay, one bud
ding critic's selections for the Top 20
Progressive Rock records (in reverse
order, to heighten the suspense of an
otherwise anticlimactic exercise):
20. Aztec Camera's "High Land, Hard
Rain." One of the mellowest and most
aesthetically pleasing albums, Aztec
Camera's first domestic release is con
sistently enjoyable. Highlighted by the
songs "Oblivious" and "Pillar To
Post," which have received a fare share
of airplay, this record is a hidden gem.
19. Sinead O'Connor's "The Lion and
the Cobra." I may be sticking my neck
out on this one, but O'Connor's debut
may well be the masterpiece of the
year. Blending Irish folk melodies into
hauntingly powerful songs like
"Jackie" and "Drink Before the War,"
while also creating the jubilant "Man
dinka," she has proven herself as an
up-and-coming star.
18. Bob Geldofs "Deep in the Heart
of Nowhere." No album in recent
memory has been criminally over
looked to a greater degree than this
one. Besides being one of the world's
foremost humanitarians, Geldof is a
talented songwriter and musician who
has created an energetic album that
is simply excellent from start to finish.
Check it out, you'll like it.
17, Ministry's "With Sympathy." Alain
Jorgenson's best project, this release
pushes synth music to the limits of
creativity and runs a wide range of
styles. You probably won't recognize

any of the songs, but after a listen
you'll be converted to the Ministry.
16. Roxy Music's "Avalon." Another
one-man-band, Bryan Ferry/Roxy
Music was at his best in this album.
The title track and "More Than This"
are two of the nicest mellow songs,
and the remaining tracks are equally
enjoyable.
15. Simple Minds' "New Gold Dream."
A greatest hits album from early in
the band's existence, this collection
presents some of Simple Minds' best
material. "Someone, Somewhere, in
Summertime," "Promised You a
Miracle" and the title track highlight
the production.
14. Siouxsie and the Banshees' "Noc
turne." The queen of post-punk and
her band rank among the elite of the
'80s artists, and on this live double
album Siouxsie really struts her stuff.
The opening of Stravinsky's "Rite of
Spring" leading into "Israel" is one of
modern music's most magnificent mo
ments.
13. Soft Cell's "The Singles." Almost
everyone has heard the song "Tainted
Love" on the radio, but few connect
it to the import sensation and New
Music pioneer Soft Cell. Marc Al
mond's clear voice and fantastic lyrics
blend well with the synthesizer riffs
the band essentially originated. The
frigid and direct "Say Hello, Wave
Goodbye" is the high point here, and
only the addition of the funny and
sarcastic "A Mug's Life" could make
the album any better.
12. INXS' "The Swing." The most
popular band out of Australia, this is
the album that brought the band its
fame. It also is INXS'last quality work
before the lures of commercialism
despoiled their artistry. "I Send a Mes
sage" is the highlight here, but
"Original Sin" and "Burn For You"
are great as well.
11. New Order's "low Itfe." Whether
e.e. cummings is the band's muse or
not remains uncertain. What is defi
nite is that this is New Order's tour
de force, as well as their stepping stone
to success. "Perfect Kiss" has become
one of the premier dance songs, but
"Love Vigilantes," "Subculture" and
the instrumental "Elegia" are the
quartet's real masterpieces.

10. Ultravox's "The Collection." Midge
Ure and the boys may not have made
Ultravox a household name, but they
have remained one of Great Britain's
top groups. Selecting the best songs
off this near-double-album would be
a tough task, but the popular "Dancing
With Tears in My Eyes," the awesome
(as in striking, not totally) "Hymn"
and the dynamic "The Voice" are spe
cial favorites.
9. Yaz's "Upstairs at Eric's." Alison
Moyet and Vince Clark have gone on
to separate projects, but their brief
union at the start of the '80s produced

two great albums. This one, the better
of the two, combines the soulful voice
of Moyet and the synthesizer sound
that made Clark's initial musical ven
ture, Depeche Mode, the premier synth
band. The result, highlighted by the
ever-popular "Don't Go" and "Only
You," is quite simply classic.
8. Cocteau Twins' "Treasure."
Esoteric is the best way to describe
this band, a collection of French
musicians who coalesce around two
talented female vocalists. The words
