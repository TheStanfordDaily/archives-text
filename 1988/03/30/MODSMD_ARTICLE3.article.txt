# Decision expected by mid-May
## NCAA drug testing trial closes 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
The end may finally be in sight
in the ongoing drug-testing trial
involving two Stanford athletes
and the NCAA.
After 14 months of legal
maneuvering, attorneys for each
of the three parties presented
their closing arguments Monday
in San Jose before Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Conrad Rushing, who is expected
to hand down a final decision in
30-45 days.
A preliminary injunction,
handed down by Rushing Dec. 9,
will remain in effect until a final
ruling is announced. The injunc
tion allows the NCAA to test only
football and men's basketball
players for amphetamines,
cocaine and anabolic steroids,
while exempting other athletes
from the test.
In their closing statements,
both Susan Harriman, the attor
ney representing senior soccer
player Jennifer Hill and junior

linebacker Barry McKeever, and
University attorney Debra Zum
walt asked Rushing to find the
entire NCAA drug testing pro
gram illegal under California law.
Both attorneys said they feel
they have a good chance of win
ning the case. "I don't think the
NCAA has proven anything more
than they did" before the prelim
inary injunction was released,
Zumwalt said.
"In terms of recent California
law, our position is quite favor
able," Harriman said.
But NCAA General Counsel
George Gangwere said he thinks
"the law should be on [the
NCAA'sI side." Gangwere said
even if the Stanford athletes win
their suit, he is not afraid of the
case setting any important prece
dents since it will be decided un
der California law and will apply
to only that particular state.
NCAA attorney Christina Han
son, who argued for the organi
zation in Monday's closing tes
timony, was unavailable for com
ment.

According to Harriman, the
testing program violates the Cal
ifornia Constitution's guarantee
to privacy. Although the NCAA
has argued that drug testing is
important in ensuring both the
health and safety of the athletes
and fair competition, Harriman
said there is no "compelling rea
son" to retain the program.
"You can't invade someone's
privacy for their own good," Har
riman argued, saying that testing
is only valid for people whose drug
use can affect others. So far there
has been no evidence that athletes
have injured themselves or others
through drugs, she said.
To uphold the fair competition
argument, the NCAA must show
that drugs are being used and
that they do enhance competition,
Harriman said.
However, Harriman said
studies done by the NCAA itself
show that only about 1 percent
of athletes use drugs. She also
said studies show that none of
Stanford's female athletes and
only 1 percent of its male athletes
use drugs. In addition, there is
convincing evidence that drugs
will not enhance performance, she
said.
According to Zumwalt, the
NCAA said it is unnecessary to
show actual drug use since the
program is justified by the poten
tial for usage rather than docu
mented usage. Yet, under the law
"just concern is not a sufficient
reason to conduct invasive test
ing," Zumwalt said.
Zumwalt said the NCAA argued
that athletes give up their right
to privacy by signing a consent

to drug testing at the beginning
of the season. If students don't
sign the waiver, they can't com
pete.
Zumwalt disagreed with this
reasoning, saying, "If a program
is unconstitutional, you can't
make it constitutional simply by
requiring people to [sign a] con
sent."
However, Gangwere said he
doesn't see drug testing or the
consent form as an invasion of
privacy or an infringement on ath
letes' constitutional rights. If ath
letes don't want to follow the
rules and sign a consent, they
don't have to compete, he said.
Athletes "don't have a consti
tutional right to participate in a
sport, so what have they given
up? All they've done is protect
their so-called right to privacy,"
he said.
