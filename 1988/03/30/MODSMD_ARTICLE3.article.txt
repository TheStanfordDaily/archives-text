# Decision expected by mid-May
## NCAA drug testing trial closes 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
The end may finally be in sight
in the ongoing drug-testing trial
involving two Stanford athletes
and the NCAA.
After 14 months of legal
maneuvering, attorneys for each
of the three parties presented
their closing arguments Monday
in San Jose before Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Conrad Rushing, who is expected
to hand down a final decision in
30-45 days.
A preliminary injunction,
handed down by Rushing Dec. 9,
will remain in effect until a final
ruling is announced. The injunc
tion allows the NCAA to test only
football and men's basketball
players for amphetamines,
cocaine and anabolic steroids,
while exempting other athletes
from the test.
In their closing statements,
both Susan Harriman, the attor
ney representing senior soccer
player Jennifer Hill and junior

linebacker Barry McKeever, and
University attorney Debra Zum
walt asked Rushing to find the
entire NCAA drug testing pro
gram illegal under California law.
Both attorneys said they feel
they have a good chance of win
ning the case. "I don't think the
NCAA has proven anything more
than they did" before the prelim
inary injunction was released,
Zumwalt said.
"In terms of recent California
law, our position is quite favor
able," Harriman said.
But NCAA General Counsel
George Gangwere said he thinks
"the law should be on [the
NCAA'sI side." Gangwere said
even if the Stanford athletes win
their suit, he is not afraid of the
case setting any important prece
dents since it will be decided un
der California law and will apply
to only that particular state.
NCAA attorney Christina Han
son, who argued for the organi
zation in Monday's closing tes
timony, was unavailable for com
ment.

According to Harriman, the
testing program violates the Cal
ifornia Constitution's guarantee
to privacy. Although the NCAA
has argued that drug testing is
important in ensuring both the
health and safety of the athletes
and fair competition, Harriman
said there is no "compelling rea
son" to retain the program.
"You can't invade someone's
privacy for their own good," Har
riman argued, saying that testing
is only valid for people whose drug
use can affect others. So far there
has been no evidence that athletes
have injured themselves or others
through drugs, she said.
To uphold the fair competition
argument, the NCAA must show
that drugs are being used and
that they do enhance competition,
Harriman said.
However, Harriman said
studies done by the NCAA itself
show that only about 1 percent
of athletes use drugs. She also
said studies show that none of
