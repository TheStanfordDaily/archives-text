## Card ends losing streak Baseball notches 20th win against Santa Clara, 4-2 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
SANTA CLARA — The Stanford
baseball team, mired in a four-game
losing streak, needed a strong pitch
ing performance yesterday and got it.
Sophomore Robbie Kamerschen
and juniors Brian Keyser and Steve
Chitren combined to five-hit Santa

Clara as the Cardinal rolled to a deceptively close
4-2 win over the Broncos at Buck Shaw Stadium.
The win improves Stanford's overall record to
20-10. The Cardinal, ranked 10th in the nation by
Baseball America and 13th by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball, is 7-4 in Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division action going into a series this weekend
with league-leading California.
After being pounded by Fresno State 13-3 and
dropping three straight to Arizona State last week,
Stanford needed a win of any kind yesterday. But
this one was particularly encouraging because of
the strong pitching.
The Cardinal pitchers had been abused for 50
hits and 43 runs during the four-game losing sreak.
"The pitchers weren't ready to push the panic
button yet," Kamerschen said, "but we needed to
have a strong pitching performance."
Kamerschen, making his first collegiate start,
delivered just that, allowing only one run on two
hits in four innings.
"That's the best I've ever seen Robbie pitch,"

Stanford catcher Doug Robbins said. "He was really
on."
Kamerschen was hit hard only once, surrendering
a solo home run to Mike Medeiros in the third.
The ball was aided by a strong wind blowing out
to left field and cleared the fence by just a foot.
Kamerschen gave way after four to Keyser, who
threw three scoreless innings, allowing only two hits.
Stanford's hitters, meanwhile, kicked around
Bronco ace Wes Bliven for 10 hits in six innings.
The Cardinal scored once in the third, twice in the
fifth and once more in the sixth to chase Bliven.
Stanford's 12-hit attack was led by Robbins, who
was four-for-four with two doubles (including a
ground-rule one-hopper over the centerfield fence
in the eighth inning).
"I was having a tough time with the bat (in the
Fresno State and Arizona State games)," Robbins
said, "so I tried out a couple new things."
Leftfielder Brian Johnson extended his hitting
streak to 10 games with an RBI single to right in
the sixth inning. Johnson is 16-for-39 (.411) during
his hitting streak.
Chitren finished up the game for the Cardinal,
allowing one hit (another wind-aided homer to left,
this one by Matt Toole) in two innings to record
his sixth save of the season.
Stanford opens the series with California at 2:30
p.m. tomorrow at Sunken Diamond. The series con
tinues at 2:30 p.m. Friday at Evans Diamond in
Berkeley, then returns to Sunken Diamond for a 1
p.m. start on Saturday.

Stanford catcher Doug Robbins well deserved congratulations yesterday. Robblns slammed two
doubles to highlight a four-for-four day at the plate and caught the combined five-hitter by three
Stanford pitchers.
