Charting its
course toward the
national champi
onships to be
hosted here at the
end of spring, the
Stanford sailing

team traveled near and far these
past few weeks to score impressive
finishes against some of the top
teams in collegiate sailing.
During this past month, the
Cardinal showed its prowess with
a third-place finish at the Old
Dominion Team Racing Invita
tional, a seventh-place perform
ance at the Boston Dinghy Cup,

and four top finishes at local
Northern Series regattas in the
Bay Area.
With these accomplishments
behind them, Stanford now heads
into the final leg of its year-round
season, looking toward the Pacific
Coast and National Champion
ships as the ultimate tests of the
effort it began in September.
"The best thing about these
regattas is that we've learned
from them," Stanford Coach
Blake Middlaton said. "The
seniors got a chance to polish
their team racing skills against
the best team racers in the coun
try, and our younger teams
developed their talents against the
teams we'll be seeing at nationals.

It should be great preparation for
the championships yet to come."
In the past, the Cardinal has
prepared for the spring season by
heading east during spring break
to compete with the best teams
from other districts. This year,
Stanford sent two squads down
that path. The first, a group of
veteran seniors, went to Old
Dominion to compete in team
racing, while another group of
younger sailors traveled to Har
vard to develop its dinghy racing
skills.
At Old Dominion, the team's
elders competed as a squad of
three boats, matched one-on-one
against five of the nation's top
schools. The regatta, held during

the first weekend of break, fea
tured near gale-force winds that
tested everyone's endurance and
survival ability.
In Boston, another Cardinal
squad helped boost Stanford's
image while it fought against 15
other schools for the Boston
Dinghy Cup, held on the Charles
River near Harvard.
After practicing in the cold for
three days during spring break,
the younger Cardinal sailors
turned in an impressive perform
ance against teams regularly
ranked in the top 20. In the end,
Stanford finished seventh, ahead
of Old Dominion, Kings Point and
local rival California.
