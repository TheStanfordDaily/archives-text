# Farm fans spring laid-back attack
## 
### 
Spring quarter at a California university
conjures up images of the stereotypical stu
dent who lives by the motto: "Fun, sun and
relaxation." An extended break from anything
serious.

For many "laid-back" Stanford students,
attendance at classes is replaced by regular
visits to Sunken Diamond and the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, where sun-tanning and
rooting on the home team can co-exist. This
may not bode well for the transcripts of several
hundred Stanford undergrads, but it has done
wonders for the Cardinal baseball and tennis
teams.
Apathy has been the word most often used
to describe Stanford sports fans in the past
few years. But those who level this charge
against Stanford students have not taken in
many baseball games or tennis matches re
cently.
In the past few years, the crowds at these
venues have been anything but apathetic.
Situated only a hop, skip and a jump away
from the players, the crowds are almost always
a part of the action, yelling on behalf of the
Cardinal teams, rattling the opposition and

acting with a spontaneity that is for the most
part unique to these events.
Chip Hale, for one, wouldn't say that the
Sunken Diamond crowds are apathetic. Hale,
an All-Pacific 10 Conference Southern Divi
sion third baseman for Arizona, was the victim
last season of a relentless verbal assault cour
tesy of several Cardinal fans who ridiculed
him from inning one. The Wildcat star pro
ceeded to crumble in the field, and his team
mates followed close behind.
In fact, far from being apathetic, students
at the spring sporting events have bordered
on the over-zealous, obnoxious and out-of
control at times.
At last year's Stanford-UCLA women's ten
nis match, with the score tied 3-3 after the
singles, a group of Cardinal fans hovered over
the No. 1 doubles match like vultures.
Jane Thomas, who at that particular stage
in the season was sporting a mohawk haircut,
was reminded of that fact throughout the
match. "What is that on top of your head? A
sail?" one fan yelled down at her.
Jennifer Fuchs, Thomas' doubles partner
and not exactly a featherweight, was asked
by a person in the crowd if she wanted a
beer. "Yeah, I could really use one," Fuchs
joked. "Yeah, I bet," the guy responded. "You
look like you've had a few too many in your
time."
Thomas and Fuchs became so preoccupied
with the crowd that they all but forgot about
the match on the court and lost in straight
sets.
A couple of weeks later at the Stanford-USC
men's tennis match, the Trojans led 3-2 with
only one singles match remaining to be played.

All eyes focused on the No. 6 singles match
between USC's Eric Amend and Stanford's
Barry Richards. Amend's concentration was
never intact, as he was noticeably disturbed
by a group of raging students screaming
through the fence like a pack of hungry lions.
The crowd got the best of Amend, as did
Richards, who won the match to even the
team score.
This weekend, Stanford sports fans (a.k.a.
sun-bathers) will get their first chance this
spring quarter to invade Sunken Diamond
and the Stanford Tennis Stadium. California,
which tops the Six-Pac baseball standings,
visits the second-place Cardinal Thursday and
Saturday. In men's tennis, UCLA comes to
the stadium Friday and top-ranked USC will
be here Saturday for the annual outdoor
indoor match.
The tennis matches this weekend mark one
of the top athletic events at Stanford all year.
When the Cardinal walks onto the same courts
as the Trojans and Bruins, there is an electric
atmosphere. "It usually goes down to the final
match," Stanford Asst. Coach John Whitlinger
said.
Whitlinger hopes the Stanford students will
refrain from being obnoxious this weekend.
"I hope the fans are fair," he said.
However, Whitlinger acknowledged that the
structure of the stadium allows the spectators
to harass the opposition from all angles. "The
way our stands are situated, you can be very
personal," he said.
Just ask Jane Thomas and Jennifer Fuchs,
who are probably glad that they won't be
returning this year to play in front of Stan
ford's "laid-back" fans.
