# Gymnastics sixth at Pac-10s
## Women shaky on beam as top-ranked UCLA dominates 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
When the dust settled
at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships, the
Stanford women's gym
nastics team had
finished sixth out of a
field of seven teams with

a team score of 182.5 while top-ranked
UCLA ran away with the title with a
score of 189.45.
Stanford's finish reflected lapses in
the Cardinal's beam routines but was
not indicative of the gymnasts' strong
performances in the other three events.
The team started the meet on a shaky
foot, competing in the first rotation on
its weakest event, the balance beam.
The Cardinal hit only three of the six
routines, and the three falls accounted
for deductions of 1.5 points.
"The beam is a tough event to start
with, especially in a big meet," Stanford
Coach Homer Sardina said. "You don't
have room to have the shakes — the
beam is only four inches wide. The event
kept us from finishing where we could

have and that was fourth."
Junior Laurence George, who was not
told until the day of the meet that she
was competing on the beam, responded
with what Sardina classified as a "su
perb job". She received a 9.25 for her
performance, hitting a double turn re
cently added to the routine.
"I was just a little bit nervous,"
George said. "It came as a bit of a
surprise. I wasn't really mentally
prepared, but I just put that aside and
did my best."
The Cardinal was able to recover from
its slow start to hit 16 of the next 18
routines throughout the remainder of
the competition. Senior Alison McGann
scored a team-high 9.35 and freshman
Jennifer Bloom scored an impressive
9.15 in only her third competition of
the year as the gymnasts went six-for
six on their bar routines.
The team's floor score was strength*
ened by Dina Amoroso's 9.4 routine,
which was solid enough for fifth place
on that exercise.
The vault was Stanford's strongest
event of the meet — a team total of
46.05. Amoroso, who was named an

'You don't have room to
have the shakes.'
— Homer Sardina

all-conference vaulter, tied for third on
the vault, scoring a 9.65 on her Tsuk
Full. McGann and Junior Jinny Rhee
executed outstanding vaults to earn
scores of 9.4 and 9.3 respectively.
Stanford is currently ranked 18th in
the country with one meet remaining
before the regionals. The team is the
fifth seed entering the regionals, but
Sardina believes that the Cardinal is
capable of improving.
"We need to peak for regionals," Sar
dina said. "We are going to be in a
bubble with about 11 teams for seven
spots (to qualify for nationals)."
In the remaining two weeks before
the regionals, the gymnasts are fine
tuning their routines to gain more con
sistency on every event.
"We need to get rid of the wobbles
and the extra steps," George said. "We
need to hit clean routines."
