# Streaky fencers fall at nationals
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
After defeating
five successive op
ponents to gain a
berth to the Na
tional Collegiate
Fencing Champi
onships at Prince-

ton, N.J., the Stanford women's
fencing team suffered four hard
fought losses at the national tour
nament and finished 12th.
The women, who were joined
at Princeton by two men's indi
vidual qualifiers, earned the right
to compete by winning the West
ern Regional Fencing Champion
ships March 12-13.
Although UC-Santa Cruz was
the pre-tournament favorite at
the regional, Stanford defeated all
five opponents to win the Western
title. The decisive meet against
the Banana Slugs was tied at eight
bouts apiece after the round-robin
competition, but the meet was
won by the women "on in
dicators," or on the basis of more
total touches than Santa Cruz.
In the first round of the 12-
team tournament, the women's
team drew into a pool with
Temple and perennial fencing
power Columbia. The team lost
to both schools and was dropped
to the pool for the ninth through
12th positions, where it lost to
Ohio State and Yale.
"Overall, we fenced as well as
could be expected," said Women's
Coach Sherry Posthumus. "We
finished where I thought we
would, but the women fenced well
and fought hard. I'm very pleased
with their effort."
Individually, women's team
captain Alexandra Rankin placed
18th in the 24-person competi

tion, which was won by Molly Sul
livan of Notre Dame.
Though the men's team only
finished third at its regional tour
ney, two Stanford fencers did
qualify for the national individual
competition: junior sabreman
Dave Russ and senior foilman
Chris Gillen. In addition, sopho
more Duncan Bell was named as
an alternate for the epee, but did
not travel to Princeton.
Russ, the Cardinal team cap
tain, and Gillen faced experienced
competitors from the East and
Midwest. Russ finished 29th in
the sabre event, while Gillen
finished 23rd. Robert Cottingham
and Marc Kent, both of Columbia,

won the foil and sabre, respec
tively.
"I'm very pleased with my
results," said Russ, who started
fencing just two years ago. "When
I started taking fencing classes, I
never expected to compete in the
NCAAs. It was a good experience,
and I've learned a lot I can apply
to next season."
With the conclusion of this
season, the Stanford men's and
women's teams can look optimis
tically toward next season. While
Rankin graduates this year, the
four other top women's fencers
return for next season. Similarly,
the men's team loses just two
fencers to graduation while

several experienced fencers
return.
In addition to next year's depth
of talent, both Posthumus and
Men's Coach Zoran Tulum hope
to add experienced fencers to their
starting rotations. Tulum is
spending this week at the World
Fencing Championships at Notre
Dame, trying to recruit younger
fencers for Stanford's program.
Posthumus said that experi
enced fencers are essential to the
future success of the fencing pro
gram. "It's important for us to
have fencers with years of exper
ience if we hope to truly compete
at the NCAAs."
