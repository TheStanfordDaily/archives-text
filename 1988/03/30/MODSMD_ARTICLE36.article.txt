# Golfers improve but fall to 16th
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
Although
they played bet
ter as a team
Tuesday, the
Cardinal men's
golfers lost
ground to the

rest of the field at the Western
Intercollegiate Tournament in
Santa Cruz. Playing at the
nationally-renowned Pas
satiempo Golf Course, Stanford
fired a second-round 385, a full
13 shots better than its
opening round.
Unfortunately for the Cardi
nal, its fine score was only good
enough for 16th place, two po
sitions down from its first
round standing. San Jose
State, which is hosting the
tourney, came roaring into first
place with a scorching 359
Tuesday. California, the first
round leader, stands one shot
behind the leaders.
Pasatiempo lost some of its
bite on Tuesday due to
diminishing winds and
markedly slower greens. Stan
ford Coach Wally Goodwin said
that most teams improved
markedly in the second round
because the course was playing
much easier.
"Today was the type of day
where you see the really capa
ble teams streaking ahead,"
Goodwin said. He was very
pleased that the squad quali
fied to play in the final round

Wednesday, noting that there
was very stiff competition for
the last few spots in the cut.
Illinois' Steve Strieker
moved ahead of Arizona State's
Mike Springer for the individ
ual lead, firing a 69 in the
second round. Sophomore Don
Christensen continues to lead
Stanford golfers with a two
round total of 153 (77-76).
The rest of the Cardinal also
showed improvement and are
right behind Christensen.
Sophomore Brad Joondeph
added a fine 74 to his first
round total of 81 to stand
second for the Cardinal at 155.
Fellow sophomore Mark Fun
seth, in third at 156 (80-76),
was followed by junior John
Mahon at 158 (79-79) and
sophomore Mike Hubly at 161
(81-80).
Christensen said his round
was "kind of sloppy. I missed
a lot of greens and had to
scramble just like yesterday.
My chipping helped me a lot."
He added that his game,
much like his teammates, is on
the brink of a marked improve
ment. "I feel like I can play
pretty well but I'm just not
there," he said. "I think I'll get
over a wall and improve soon."
As for the team, Christensen
said that the second-round
scores were "still not what we
want but we're headed in the
right direction."
"If we could move up two or
three spots, that will be great,"
Goodwin said.
