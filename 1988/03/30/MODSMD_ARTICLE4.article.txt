## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Secretary of Education William
Bennett, an outspoken proponent
of retaining a conservative core
list of classic Western culture
texts in universities, will come to
Stanford later this month to com
ment on the Area One debate
here, a Department of Education
official confirmed yesterday.
According to Mahlon Anderson,
deputy director of public affairs
for the department, Bennett's
visit is scheduled for April 18.
However, Bennett's press secre
tary, Loye Miller, said that date
may be changed.
In his speech here, Bennett will
discuss the Western Culture com
promise worked out this week by
a coalition of Stanford faculty
members, Miller said. The Faculty
Senate is expected to approve the
compromise at its meeting Thurs
day. Bennett's speech will also ad
dress the state of higher education
in general, Miller added.
On several occasions since the
Western Culture debate here
heated up in January, Bennett

has made slashing remarks to the
national press about the Stanford
faculty. The secretary decried the
faculty's consideration of propos
als to abandon the Area One core
reading list, charging that such
action would "trash" Western
Culture.
The Stanford Review, a conser
vative student quarterly, has of
fered to sponsor the Bennett visit.
Review Editor in Chief Peter
Thiel said the visit will allow "the
other side of the Western Culture
debate to get a full hearing. . . .
The visit will add to the debate."
Junior Terri James, director of
the ASSU Speakers Bureau, said
that Bennett initiated the idea of
a Stanford visit.
According to James, Bennett
approached Branner Resident Fel
low Kennell Jackson in January,
suggesting an appearance there.
Jackson then proposed a debate
between himself and Bennett on
the Western Culture issue, which
Bennett declined, James said. A
final proposal to hold a panel dis
cussion at Branner featuring Ben
nett fell through when Jackson
and Bennett could not agree on

a date for the event, James added.
Bennett's office has subse
quently been working with The
Review to arrange for Bennett to
speak here alone on the Western
Culture issue. According to An
derson, Bennett has delayed his
Stanford visit until after a final
senate vote on Western Culture
in order to avoid disrupting
campus discussion of the issue.
