University President Donald
Kennedy will receive an award ac
knowledging his commitment to
public service from the Coro
Foundation in San Francisco on
April 12.
Suzanne Gendey, director of de
velopment at the Coro Founda
tion, said Kennedy received the
award for his stewardship of the
University and for his "incorpo
ration of public affairs into the
undergraduate curriculum."
Former San Francisco mayor
Dianne Feinstein, who is a Stan
ford graduate, and Robert
Maynard, the editor and publisher
of the Oakland Tribune who will
speak at Commencement on June
12, also recieved Coro awards this
year.
Coro Executive Director
Martha Bredon said she believes
it was Kennedy's work in provid
ing public service opportunities at
Stanford that impressed the foun
dation. However, his work in the
field of biology and in national
educational policy were also fac
tors in the decision to honor Ken
nedy with the award.
Kennedy has consistently en
couraged public service at Stan
ford through projects such as the
annual Reach Out Today volun
teer effort, as well as serving on
local, state and national commis
sions on education.
According to Bredon, the main
purpose of the Coro Foundation
is "to prepare individuals for ef
fective leadership in public af
fairs." It was founded in 1942 in
the Bay Area, but now has grown
to accommodate offices in Los An
geles, New York and St. Louis.
Coro was founded by Van Duyn

Dodge and W. Donald Fletcher,
who was a Stanford Law School
graduate. Since 1945, Coro and
Stanford have "shared richly in
their resources," said Bredon.
Coro recruits heavily for Stanford
graduates to become involved in
their programs, and History Prof.
David Kennedy served on the
board of directors at Coro.
Each year, Coro offers 12 nine
month fellowships in public af
fairs. Two 1987 Stanford
graduates, Judith David and Or
lando Elizondo, are currently
working through these fellow
ships. David said it is appropriate
for Kennedy to receive the award.
"He was very encouraging of stu
dents getting involved in public
service."
David added that there needs
to be more of "a follow-up (in the
area of public service) after grad
uation," and Coro is one option.
