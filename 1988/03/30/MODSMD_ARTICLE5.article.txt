# Students help police nab computer thief
## 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Two Stanford students helped
police identify the prime suspect
in a rash of computer thefls that
have plagued the University for
more than one year, according to
a police report released yesterday.
Stanford Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer reported that the two
students, whose names are not
being released in accordance with
police policy, spotted Sacramento
resident Kenneth Hennigan as he
attempted to remove an Apple
LaserWriter printer in plastic gar
bage bags from the Tresidder
Memorial Union copy center.
"If it weren't for the alertness
of the two students," said
Niemeyer, "we'd still be in the
dark."
Following their encounter with
Hennigan, who claimed he was a
computer repair man, the stu
dents called Stanford police and
gave "very good, detailed descrip
tions" to the police, Niemeyer
said. Later the two went to the
San Jose Police Department to
give their description to a police
artist.
The students' description led
Palo Alto police officer Doug Kuf
fel to apprehend Hennigan on
March 27. Kuffel arrested the
suspect during a stakeout at the
Southern Pacific Depot in Palo
Alto.
Hennigan, 58, is a five-time

prisoner from the Sacramento
area where he was wanted for
parole violation and auto theft.
He has been incarcerated in San
Jose since his apprehension.
Niemeyer investigated most of
the more than 70 computer thefts
that were reported in five Uni
versity departments, as well as
the Ginzton Laboratory and
Varian Physics Laboratory. The
total of this year's computer
thefts, most of which were IBM
Personal Computers and Apple
Macintoshes, is valued at $51,175.
Niemeyer described Hennigan's
operation as "hand to mouth. As
soon as the computers were
stolen, he got rid of them."
Despite the recent arrest,
Niemeyer warned the community
not to be complacent about
campus security. While calling
Hennigan a "main player,"
Niemeyer said he is not yet cer
tain he worked alone.
Hennigan may have also stolen
computers from Phoenix, Ariz.,
according to Niemeyer. Two com
puters, the only ones recovered
so far, were traced to an education
official who reported them miss
ing from that city on March 3.
Jose Arcenas of Daly City, 43,
received the two computers as col
lateral for a loan to Hennigan.
Cooperating with Daily City
police, Stanford officers executed
a search warrant of Arcenas'
home where the computers were
found.
