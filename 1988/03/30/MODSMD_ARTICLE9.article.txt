## Ceremony honors terminally ill administrator 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
In a massive show of appre
ciation, several hundred people
gathered together yesterday to
dedicate the new Amy J. Blue
Garden, in honor of Stanford's
associate vice president for Ad
ministrative Services and
Facilities.
The ceremony also celebrated
the groundbreaking of the new
two-building Serra Complex,
which will be constructed on the
parking lot east of the Old Pa
vilion and tennis courts on
Serra Street.
Blue, the University's most
senior woman in non-academic
administration, was diagnosed
last spring with an inoperable
brain tumor and given only a
two months to live as of Janu
ary.
Curt Williams, director of
facilities project management,
said the purpose of the cere
mony was "to share with Amy
our feelings about her."
Members of seven depart
ments of the administrative
services and facilities, which

report to Blue, gave short
speeches "reinforcing what a
special person she is."
Blue, 44, said she was "so sur
prised" and the ceremony was
"just wonderful. It reflected all
the things I've worked so hard
for ... (such as) getting people
to communicate," she said.
A special garden to be planted
between the new buildings will
be named for Blue. The Serra
Complex will be composed of
two 42,000-square-foot build
ings that will house some ad
ministrative units now located
in Encina Hall and the Old Pa
vilion.
Blue, who is notable within
the Stanford administration for
emphasizing proper training for
employees in various jobs, has
pioneered ways to help employ
ees operate at top efficiency.
William Massy, vice president
for business and finance, said
that Blue's name is "closely as
sociated with training in busi
ness and finance. She was the
first senior officer to realize that
training is the key to improved
service and to make it happen
on a large scale."

Blue is responsible for seven
units that make up administra
tive services and facilities.
About 800 regular staff mem
bers, 300 to 400 student em
ployees and numerous contract
workers are under Blue's com
mand. Her job puts her in
charge of operations and main
tenance workers, such as steam
fitters, plumbers, electricians
and other technical personnel.
Design for the garden to be
named for Blue was inspired by
one of her favorite artists,
French impressionist Claude
Monet. The anonymous donor
who gave money for the two
new buildings has also worked
with Blue to decide how the gar
den should be laid out. Blue is
the only person to know the
identity of the donor.
"I hope the garden will be a
gathering place for people, but
also a place for people to
reflect," she said.
University President Donald
Kennedy surprised Blue with
the announcement of the garden
during a dinner party honoring
her in January.
