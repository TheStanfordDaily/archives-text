Dear Admissions Staff,
I am but another applicant
trying to get In
I know my chances are slim
For me this Is no whim
My education means a lot
And Stanford is the best school in the lot
Occidental Is challenging and fun
Yet tor me Stanford Is the one.

Hopeful Transfer Applicant
(TO THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES theme):
Come on listen to my story of a rabbit named
Bink, Star of Life In Hell, a strip that makes you
think. Well one day Blnk waa feelln' kinda low,
So he came up wth the plan to make some
dough. Merchandising that is. Fun garb. Comfy
T's. Well the first thinf you know the shirts
began to sell. Bink's klnfolk said: "This alnt so
bad tor Helll" They said: "Hooray for CaJifomy
and all Its glam and glossl" So Blnky paid his
rent and he stayed right there In Los. Angeles,
that Is. Swimming pools. Obscure cartoonists.
