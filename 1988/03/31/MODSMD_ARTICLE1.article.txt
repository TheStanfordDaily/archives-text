## Western Culture politicking heavy yesterday

In a special meeting yesterday, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies upheld
the faculty compromise on Western Culture
announced Tuesday, rejecting last-minute
efforts by the Faculty Senate steering com
mittee to alter the language of the agree
ment.
"The committee declined to consider (the
changes)," said CUS Chair Craig Heller.
"Clearly, some of the (proposed) changes
were objectionable. .. . The most important
thing is that the [original compromise
agreement] represents the consensus, I
think, of all the parties involved."
The CUS decision to reject the changes
followed a student sit-in at University
Provost James Rosse's office. More than
25 students representing the Asian Amer
ican Student Association, the Black Stu
dent Union, MEChA (a Chicano-Latino stu
dent group) and Students United for a
Democratic Education voiced their concern
that the Faculty Senate steering committee
had made changes in the language of the
compromise proposal without consulting its
original authors.
The original compromise, which would
replace the core list in all Western Culture
tracks with common "elements" of texts,
authors, themes or issues and would man

date an annual review procedure to select
these common "elements," will be voted
on by the full Faculty Senate today.
The proposed changes, consisting of the
re-wording of selected provisions of the
compromise, were made by the steering
committee in an attempt to ensure that a
majority of senators would vote for the
compromise.
The students said they were angry be
cause the committee failed to announce its
changes before releasing a revised version
of the compromise proposal to Campus
Report. The changes included decreasing
the number of future Area One tracks from
10 to eight and stressing the "common
experience" of students rather than their
"cultural diveisity."
In addition, the steering committee
added a clause that stated that an objective
of the Area One requirement would be "to
deepen understanding of the ideas and his
torical forces that contributed to the de
velopment of Western civilization, Ameri
can democracy and scientific inquiry."
The students chose to stage their protest
at Rosse's office because he is an ex-officio
member of the senate's steering committee,
which authored the proposed changes.
Rosse spoke with the students for about
45 minutes and agreed to convey their
disappointment to the senate. The senate
