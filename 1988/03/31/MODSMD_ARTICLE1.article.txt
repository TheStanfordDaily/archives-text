# Compromise survives attempted revision
## Western Culture politicking heavy yesterday 
### Alicia Kent Jennifer Schmid Staff writers 
In a special meeting yesterday, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies upheld
the faculty compromise on Western Culture
announced Tuesday, rejecting last-minute
efforts by the Faculty Senate steering com
mittee to alter the language of the agree
ment.
"The committee declined to consider (the
changes)," said CUS Chair Craig Heller.
"Clearly, some of the (proposed) changes
were objectionable. .. . The most important
thing is that the [original compromise
agreement] represents the consensus, I
think, of all the parties involved."
The CUS decision to reject the changes
followed a student sit-in at University
Provost James Rosse's office. More than
25 students representing the Asian Amer
ican Student Association, the Black Stu
dent Union, MEChA (a Chicano-Latino stu
dent group) and Students United for a
Democratic Education voiced their concern
that the Faculty Senate steering committee
had made changes in the language of the
compromise proposal without consulting its
original authors.
The original compromise, which would
replace the core list in all Western Culture
tracks with common "elements" of texts,
authors, themes or issues and would man

date an annual review procedure to select
these common "elements," will be voted
on by the full Faculty Senate today.
The proposed changes, consisting of the
re-wording of selected provisions of the
compromise, were made by the steering
committee in an attempt to ensure that a
majority of senators would vote for the
compromise.
The students said they were angry be
cause the committee failed to announce its
changes before releasing a revised version
of the compromise proposal to Campus
Report. The changes included decreasing
the number of future Area One tracks from
10 to eight and stressing the "common
experience" of students rather than their
"cultural diveisity."
In addition, the steering committee
added a clause that stated that an objective
of the Area One requirement would be "to
deepen understanding of the ideas and his
torical forces that contributed to the de
velopment of Western civilization, Ameri
can democracy and scientific inquiry."
The students chose to stage their protest
at Rosse's office because he is an ex-officio
member of the senate's steering committee,
which authored the proposed changes.
Rosse spoke with the students for about
45 minutes and agreed to convey their
disappointment to the senate. The senate

will vote at its meeting today on
whether to allow the students to
present their grievances.
The students' charged that the
steering committee passed off the
revised draft as the original pro
posal when it was released to the
press yesterday.
Claiming that the steering com
mittee engaged in "backroom
dealing and public misinforma
tion," students said the commit
tee had substantially altered the
meaning of the original compro
mise agreement by making
changes in wording.
Steering committee member
Victor Fuchs denied that the pro
posed changes to the compromise
would negate the original aim of
the Culture, Ideas and Values
plan. The CIV is a plan to reform
of the University's Western Cul
ture program that has been
debated in the senate for several
months.
"My interpretation was that

basically the spirit and intent of
the CIV came through very
strongly," Fuchs said.
Fourteen faculty members, in
cluding History Profs. A 1 Camaril
lo, Kennell Jackson and Judith
Brown, released a statement to
The Daily yesterday stating that
"we share the community's out
rage at the shortsighted attempt
to modify the compromise which
has nearly brought the painful
debate over Area One to a suc
cessful resolution."
"Substantive changes intro
duced at the last minute such as
a limit to eight tracks undermine
the process of consensus and the
good faith of those who partici
pated in it,"the statement reads.
The protesting students ob
jected to the proposed limitation
of eight Western Culture tracks
rather than 10 because such a
move would impede the progress
of reform in the Western Culture
program. MEChA co-chair Lucky
Gutierrez said that any new ex
perimental tracks would have to
displace already existing tracks in
order to last for more than one
year.

"This leaves little chance for
change," Gutierrez said, because
professors will not be willing to
give up their own tracks in order
to establish new ones. He noted
that if the maximum were to be
10 tracks, there would be room
for the current eight tracks plus
two additional experimental ones.
History Prof. Paul Robinson,
who chaired the faculty meeting
at which the original compromise
agreement was drafted two weeks
ago, said he prefers the 10-track
proposal, but added that it would
be harmful to argue over small
changes.
The students protesting at
Rosse's office were supported by
several faculty members, who felt
the revisions constituted a
"procedural wrongdoing," accord
ing to English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, who is also a mem
ber of the steering committee.
Lindenberger said he was
"really disappointed" that some
members of the steering commit
tee had tampered with a compro
mise that "emerged through a
legitimate process and through
debate by a very diverse faculty."

In a special meeting yesterday, the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies upheld
the faculty compromise on Western Culture
announced Tuesday, rejecting last-minute
efforts by the Faculty Senate steering com
mittee to alter the language of the agree
ment.
"The committee declined to consider (the
changes)," said CUS Chair Craig Heller.
"Clearly, some of the (proposed) changes
were objectionable. .. . The most important
thing is that the [original compromise
agreement] represents the consensus, I
think, of all the parties involved."
The CUS decision to reject the changes
followed a student sit-in at University
Provost James Rosse's office. More than
25 students representing the Asian Amer
ican Student Association, the Black Stu
dent Union, MEChA (a Chicano-Latino stu
dent group) and Students United for a
Democratic Education voiced their concern
that the Faculty Senate steering committee
had made changes in the language of the
compromise proposal without consulting its
original authors.
The original compromise, which would
replace the core list in all Western Culture
tracks with common "elements" of texts,
authors, themes or issues and would man

date an annual review procedure to select
these common "elements," will be voted
on by the full Faculty Senate today.
The proposed changes, consisting of the
re-wording of selected provisions of the
compromise, were made by the steering
committee in an attempt to ensure that a
majority of senators would vote for the
compromise.
The students said they were angry be
cause the committee failed to announce its
changes before releasing a revised version
of the compromise proposal to Campus
Report. The changes included decreasing
the number of future Area One tracks from
10 to eight and stressing the "common
experience" of students rather than their
"cultural diveisity."
In addition, the steering committee
added a clause that stated that an objective
of the Area One requirement would be "to
deepen understanding of the ideas and his
torical forces that contributed to the de
velopment of Western civilization, Ameri
can democracy and scientific inquiry."
The students chose to stage their protest
at Rosse's office because he is an ex-officio
member of the senate's steering committee,
which authored the proposed changes.
Rosse spoke with the students for about
45 minutes and agreed to convey their
disappointment to the senate. The senate

will vote at its meeting today on
whether to allow the students to
present their grievances.
The students' charged that the
steering committee passed off the
revised draft as the original pro
posal when it was released to the
press yesterday.
Claiming that the steering com
mittee engaged in "backroom
dealing and public misinforma
tion," students said the commit
tee had substantially altered the
meaning of the original compro
mise agreement by making
changes in wording.
Steering committee member
Victor Fuchs denied that the pro
posed changes to the compromise
would negate the original aim of
the Culture, Ideas and Values
plan. The CIV is a plan to reform
of the University's Western Cul
ture program that has been
debated in the senate for several
months.
"My interpretation was that

basically the spirit and intent of
the CIV came through very
strongly," Fuchs said.
Fourteen faculty members, in
cluding History Profs. A 1 Camaril
lo, Kennell Jackson and Judith
Brown, released a statement to
The Daily yesterday stating that
"we share the community's out
rage at the shortsighted attempt
to modify the compromise which
has nearly brought the painful
debate over Area One to a suc
cessful resolution."
"Substantive changes intro
duced at the last minute such as
a limit to eight tracks undermine
the process of consensus and the
good faith of those who partici
pated in it,"the statement reads.
The protesting students ob
jected to the proposed limitation
of eight Western Culture tracks
rather than 10 because such a
move would impede the progress
of reform in the Western Culture
program. MEChA co-chair Lucky
Gutierrez said that any new ex
perimental tracks would have to
displace already existing tracks in
order to last for more than one
year.

"This leaves little chance for
change," Gutierrez said, because
professors will not be willing to
give up their own tracks in order
to establish new ones. He noted
that if the maximum were to be
10 tracks, there would be room
for the current eight tracks plus
two additional experimental ones.
History Prof. Paul Robinson,
who chaired the faculty meeting
at which the original compromise
agreement was drafted two weeks
ago, said he prefers the 10-track
proposal, but added that it would
be harmful to argue over small
changes.
The students protesting at
Rosse's office were supported by
several faculty members, who felt
the revisions constituted a
"procedural wrongdoing," accord
ing to English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, who is also a mem
ber of the steering committee.
Lindenberger said he was
"really disappointed" that some
members of the steering commit
tee had tampered with a compro
mise that "emerged through a
legitimate process and through
debate by a very diverse faculty."
