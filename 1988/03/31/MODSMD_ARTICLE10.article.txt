### Kevin Wacknov 
A free year of graduate study,
plus money for expenses, awaits
three seniors who have won Mel
lon Fellowships in the Humani
ties.
Daralyn Durie, Matthew Roller
and Sylvia Tandeciarz (who all
lived in Paloma freshman year)
last week were awarded the pres
tigious fellowships by the Mellon
Foundation. These fellowships en
courage the ablest college
graduates in the United States
and Canada to pursue careers in
higher education.
This year's 127 Mellon fellows
were selected from 1,346 candi
dates nominated by faculty mem
bers in the United States and
Canada.
Durie hails from Victoria, 8.C.,
and has a double major in human
biology and humanities, with a
concentration in comparative
literature. Next year she plans to
study comparative literature,
probably at Harvard or Berkeley.

Durie is interested in Feminist
Studies and Canadian literature.
English Prof. Barbara Gelpi said,
"[Durie's] range of capability and
competence in science, math, lan
guage and literature is extraordi
nary. She is torn between her in
terests because she has so many
gifts."
Roller, a classics mtgor, comes
from Boulder, Colo. He wants to
study classics next year at
Berkeley or Princeton.
Roller said he became inter
ested in classics while fulfilling a
distribution requirement. How
ever, he waited until the spring
quarter of his junior year to
change his major from physics to
classics, completing the classics
major in four quarters.
Tandeciarz is an English major
from Potomac, Md. She also plans
to study comparative literature at
Columbia, Cornell or Duke. She
plans to focus on Latin American
literature from a feminist perspec
tive.
