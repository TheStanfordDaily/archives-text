Meese faces pressure to quit

WASHINGTON — Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111,
denounced by Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd as "the
crown jewel of the sleaze fac
tor in Reagan administration
history," faced increasing
pressure from Congress yes
terday to step down, a day
after two top-level officials and
four of their aides resigned
from his Department of Justice

Byrd, leading a growing list of senators and
congressmen who have called for Meese's res
ignation, said: "The president ought to ask
somebody — if he doesn't want to ask him
himself — to ask Mr. Meese to step aside,
step down."
Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, the first GOP
senator to call for Meese's resignation, said
the administration "would be better off with
his leaving."

House wants controllers rehired
WASHINGTON — In a strong challenge to
President Reagan, the House approved legis
lation yesterday requiring the federal govern
ment to rehire at least 1,000 of the 11,400
air traffic controllers who were fired by Pres
ident Reagan after their 1981 strike.
Democrats and Republican supporters, con
tending that the additional controllers would
help improve air safety, endorsed the bill on
a 234-180 vote and sent it on to the Senate,
where its prospects are uncertain.
Reagan has said he will veto the bill if it
reaches his desk.
Sponsors noted that the number of control
lers is still lower than it was at the time of
the strike.
The Reagan administration has agreed to
seek funds over the next few years to hire an
additional 955 controllers and bring their num
bers closer to pre-strike levels. But it is vehe
mently opposed to rehiring any of the con
trollers who participated in the illegal strike.
Swaggart to continue to preach

BATON ROUGE, La. -
Citing "the will of God" and
speaking through lawyers,
scandal-torn preacher Jimmy
Swaggart said yesterday that
he would defy an order from
church elders to step away
from his lucrative television
ministry for a year.
Attorney William Treeby,
reading from a prepared state-

ment, said that Swaggart "is looking forward
with great anticipation" to resuming his role
in May as mainstay of the world's most widely
watched religious broadcast.
The statement was issued one day after the
national elders of the Assemblies of God
suspended the preacher for "moral failures."
The failures reportedly involve him paying a
prostitute to pose naked.
