# Noriega breaks Panamanian strike
## 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama — A wave
of strikes thai had brought Panama's
economy to a virtual standstill in
recent weeks broke down yesterday as
Gen. Manuel Noriega showed contin
ued determination to stay in power.
Five supermarket chains reopened
for the first time in nine days, dock
workers went back to their jobs after
a two-week walkout, and banks made
preparations to conduct limited busi
ness after a three-week shutdown.
At the same time, the government
scraped up money to pay some of what
it owes public employees for this week
as well as salaries left unpaid two
weeks ago. The search for money coin
cided with partially successful efforts
to end a wave of public worker
walkouts.
Tax collections from U.S. companies

that operate in Panama had helped
Noriega stay afloat. But the Reagan
administration, which is trying to force
the military strongman from power,
said yesterday that it would act to
block such payments.
In all, Noriega appeared to be sur
viving the latest round of pressures
to force him out of office and out of
Panama. The impasse between Nori
ega on one side and domestic foes and
the U.S. government on the other evi
dently will continue for the foreseeable
future.
Some Panamanians have begun to
express impatience with U.S. policy
that has choked their livelihoods but
has yet to squeeze Noriega out of
power. The Reagan administration has
cooperated with efforts by Noriega's
rivals to shut off the flow of dollars

to Panama.
"The United States has taken half
steps that hurt us but have not gotten
to Noriega," said Martin Porro, a taxi
driver at the port of Balboa near
Panama City. "This threat to Noriega
is not enough, except to drive us to
desperation." Sometimes intimidation,
sometimes steady negotiation and
sometimes both have helped crack the
paralyzing strikes here.
Nine days of a solid commercial
strike called by the Civic Crusade, an
anti-Noriega coalition, was broken by
retail grocery store chains. Crusade
leaders said that retail store owners
decided to reopen because they were
afraid of having their businesses con
fiscated.
The government's seizure of flour
from two private mills last week made

the grocers doubly nervous, crusade
leaders said.
"Some people take pressure better
than others," Pierre Leignadier, a
crusade official, said.
Although not all retail chains opened
yesterday, crusade leaders admitted
there was nothing they could do to
stop the breach in the strike from
spreading. Crusade leaders originally
had said they would maintain the
strike until Noriega fell.
"As far as we are concerned, the
strike goes on," Leignadier said. "We
will see wha£ happens."
Dockworkers at Balboa and Colon
agreed to reopen the country's two
main ports after negotiators worked
out a complex wage agreement.
