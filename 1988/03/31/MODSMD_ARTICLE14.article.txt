# Palestinians riot; defy Israeli order
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — In one of the
most violent days since the Pal
estinian uprising began,
protesters throughout the occu
pied West Bank and Gaza Strip
yesterday defied an unprece
dented closure order and clashed
with Israeli troops, resulting in
the deaths of four Palestinians
and the wounding of 50 others.
Army troops and protesters
fought at more than 20 locations,
a military spokesman said. Hospi
tal sources said that five of the
wounded were in critical condi
tion.
The West Bank military com
mander, Maj. Gen. Amram
Mitzna, said that the unusually
high number of casualties oc
curred because "we were
prepared." He said the soldiers
"reacted quickly and firmly" to
the demonstrations.
In a related action, Mitzna or
dered the pro-nationalist Pales
tine Press Service closed for six

months, cutting off a key source
of non-official information about
the territories used by about 50
news organizations.
In Israel proper, meanwhile,
tens of thousands of Arabs living
as citizens within the country's
pre-1967 borders expressed
solidarity with Palestinians in the
territories at unusually large but
peaceful "Land Day" rallies.
Land Day commemorates the
slaying of six Arabs by Israeli
troops in 1976 during protests
against government confiscation
of Arab lands in northern Israel.
But this year, organizers ex
pressed support as well for the
national aspirations of their fel
low Palestinians living in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
The army reacted with a wide
spread campaign of arrests and
an unprecedented order designat
ing the occupied territories as a
closed military zone for a 72-hour
period that began Monday night.

The closure order effectively
restricts more than 1.4 million
Palestinians to their homes in the
Gaza Strip or to their towns and
villages in the West Bank.
Israeli authorities said they
were concerned that violence in
the territories might spill over the
so-called Green Line defining Is
rael's pre-1967 borders and ex
acerbate tension in the 700,000-
member Israeli Arab community.
A key goal of the closure order
was to prevent contacts among
Palestinians in the territories, as
well as between them and the Is
raeli Arabs.
Because of the closure order in
the territories, it was impossible
to check independently the army's
report on the day's disturbances.
Journalists are banned from the
territories without permission
from the array and without a mil
itary escort.
