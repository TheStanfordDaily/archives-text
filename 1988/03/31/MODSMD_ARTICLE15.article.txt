# INF treaty goes to Senate for debate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
resoundingly endorsed the
landmark U.S.-Soviet treaty out
lawing medium-range nuclear
weapons yesterday, sending it to
the Senate floor where supporters
expect to see it approved before
the upcoming Reagan-Gorbachev
summit in Moscow.
The 17-2 vote followed 21 days
of hearings and debate and set
the stage for ratification of the
first formal nuclear arms accord
between Washington and Moscow
since 1972. Signed by President
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in December, the pact

bans an entire class of weapons
and mandates on-site inspections
by both sides to verify compliance.
In spite of the euphoria at
seeing the treaty over its first
hurdle, though, senators took
note of clouds still on the horizon.
Republicans were furious over
language written into the agree
ment by Democrats demanding an
air-tight assurance that its inter
pretation cannot be changed in
the future. And left unresolved in
the minds of some was whether
the agreement bans futuristic
weapons still undeveloped.
