# Memo contradicts Bush
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — New documents
released yesterday by the congressional
Iran-Contra committees appear to con
tradict Vice President Bush's assertion
that he had not heard about the early
opposition of Secretary of State George
Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger to the secret arms sales to
Iran.
The 26-word handwritten agenda
prepared by then-national security ad
viser John Poindexter for his Jan. 17,
1986, Oval Office national security brief
ing for President Reagan and Bush sum
marized the main points for a "new
plan" and the intelligence order, or
"finding," for the covert Iranian arms
sales. The final agenda point is: "Shultz
and Weinberger still recommend

against."
Bush has repeatedly denied that he
was aware of the opposition of the senior
Cabinet members at this early stage.
At the top of Poindexter's Jan. 17
agenda notes, he wrote "Done." And in
a deposition released yesterday, his per
sonsd secretary, Florence Gantt, testified
that this meant he had covered the items
on the agenda.
Poindexter's agenda for his oral pre
sentation also notes: "Meese & Casey
approve."
Bush has said in the past that he
cannot recall much about the Jan. 17
meeting — the day Reagan signed the
key intelligence finding for the secret
arms sales.
