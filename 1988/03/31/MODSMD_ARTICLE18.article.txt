## A
						smokers' refuge 
### 
THE Coffee House has re
cently joined the many
groups on campus and across
the country that are reconsidering
their smoking policies. While
prohibiting smoking in public
places is not only desirable, but
also highly appropriate, the Coffee
House should be an exception.
The management has circulated
survey forms so that customers can
express their preference on
whether to allow smoking in the
Coffee House. Instead of taking
any drastic measures, the manage
ment should investigate ways to
improve ventilation and the divi
sion between the smoking and non
smoking sections, so that the Cof
fee House will be available and
enjoyable for both smokers and
non-smokers.
The detrimental health effects
of second-hand smoke have been
widely documented. Stanford has
banned smoking in almost all Uni
versity buildings and recently an
nounced that smoking will also be
prohibited in many outdoor
facilities, including Stanford
Stadium.
These actions are part of a
nationwide trend that includes at
tempts to ban smoking from*
workplaces, airplane flights, res
taurants and even the entire
Southern California town of Del
Mar.
However, there are few places
left on campus where people can
smoke. While the rights and health
of non-smokers should be
protected, it is unfair to leave
smokers with no place to go. This
is especially pertinent at Stanford,

which attracts a diverse and cos
mopolitan group of people to
campus each day, including many
international students and visitors
for whom smoking is more cul
turally acceptable.
The Coffee House occupies a
unique position at Stanford. As an
alternative to what some would call
the sterile atmosphere at Tresid
der, the Coffee House has the am
bience of a European cafe where
patrons go to debate issues, read
alone â€” and smoke.
In fact, many of the Coffee
House's regular customers are
foreign students who smoke in
greater numbers than the 6 per
cent of Stanford students overall
who do. Prohibiting smoking will
drive away the very people who
provide the Coffee House with its
unique atmosphere.
The main problem with the Cof
fee House is that the smoking sec
tion is inadequately divided from
the non-smoking section and
poorly ventilated.
In the short term, there are so
lutions to this problem that are
less drastic than a ban on smoking.
It would be easy to open more
windows in the smoking section
and to install more fans to keep
smoke from drifting.
Hopefully, when the Coffee
House moves into its new location
when the projected renovation of
Tresidder occurs, a greater separa
tion between smokers and non
smokers and a better ventilation
system can be designed.
The Coffee House management
should do its best to accommodate
all of its customers.
