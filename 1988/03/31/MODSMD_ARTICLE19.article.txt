## SERVE organization misrepresented in editorial 
### 
THE IDIOCY and ignorance of
The Daily edit board never
ceases to amaze me! Specifically,
I have problems with the Tuesday,
March 29 editorial titled "Farm
Politicking". This piece of uninformed
dirvel purported to make a statement
about Student Election Review for
Voter Education, an organization that
Cindy Wurtenberg, Chris Adamson and
I formed late last quarter. Here are a
few of my complaints:
• The edit board did zip in the way of
research. If they had even bothered to
call one of the founders of SERVE
they would have found that we decided
last quarter not to go through with
the project. We felt there were too
many logistical problems and concerns
to be addressed in too short of time to
make it a viable organization for this
election.

• Where did they get their informa
tion? Beats the heck out of me. If they
had bothered to do ANY recent re
search on the organization, they would
have found that we did not intend it
to recommend how students vote in
the upcoming elections. Rather, the
SERVE board would formulate ques
tions to ask of all candidates and
publish the responses of all candidates.
Students would then be able to see
where all candidates stand and conse
quently decide for themselves what
candidates best represent their views.
What could be more objective?
• The editorial alludes to SERVE
attempting to place its members in
office. Nonsense. That's exactly why
we included the provision in the
SERVE selection process that members
could not be candidates, members of
groups endorsing or members of

groups endorsing or members of
groups seeking special fees. We did not
want anyone who had a vested interest
in the outcome of the election formu
lating the questions.
Maybe the message The Daily edit
board is trying to get across is that
it's OK to endorse and lobby for one's
own candidates but that it's not cool
to inform the students about all of the
candidates, special fees and slates. I
personally think that's a stupid view.
I think elections should be more
than just a name-recognition contest,
more than just people pushing buttons
because the People's Platform or The
Daily tells them to. I think there
should be mechanisms of making it
clear to students just where everyone
stands. THAT was the pupose I had in
mind when creating SERVE.

SERVE was and is a potentially good
organization. Its purpose is not to
endorse candidates, as The Daily seems
to believe, nor is it to get certain
people into office. Instead, its purpose
is to thoughtfully ask questions of all
candidates and special fee groups and
publish their responses. While it will
not accomplish that purpose this year,
I have hopes that it will be up and
running in time for next year's elec
tions.
SERVE does not deserve to be ig
norantly and blindly attacked just
because the edit board is too lazy to
do even a little bit of research. Per
haps the problem is that well
intentioned groups performing an
important service don't make good
reading.
