# Kennedy broadens safety officials' regulatory powers
## 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy,
responding to a consultant's report that
has pointed to a conflict of interest be
tween researchers and safety officials, has
reaffirmed the authority of safety officials
to suspend operations at any Stanford
facility or department which they believe
pose a threat to public health.
The new policy was outlined in a state
ment released Tuesday by Kennedy.
Bolstering the administration's commit
ment further, he simultaneously ap
proved the re-establishment of a Univer
sity Committee on Health and Safety that
was disbanded in 1986.
Kennedy said top safety officials —
including the directors of Health and
Safety and Health Physics — are em
powered to "require immediate corrective
action upon reaching a determination

that an imminent threat to health and
safety exists."
Dr. Alain Decleve, director of Health
and Safety, said yesterday that the new
policy was necessary because researchers
had "continually" argued with his office.
In a situation where safety is at stake,
"there is no room for argumentation,"
he said.
Safety issues have been under close
scrutiny here since last December. At
that time, Kennedy told internal auditors
to investigate charges by a former em
ployee that Health and Safety was riddled
with "mismanagement, waste and cover
up."
The internal auditors then commis
sioned SRI International, a Menlo Park
risk management consulting firm, to
review overall safety conditions at Stan
ford and assess the University's priorities
and methods of administering Health and
Safety.

SRl's report, publicly released March
4, blasted the University for exposing the
campus community to "unnecessary
risks." The report suggested the es
tablishment of a Health and Safety Com
mittee responsible for "policy develop
ment, implementation, oversight and
periodic review of the health and safety
program."
The report also criticized researchers
for not being responsive to safety con
cerns, saying that "faculty and staff at
titudes toward and expertise in health
and safety issues need to be improved."
Kennedy downplayed the significance
of his reinforcement of Decleve's position,
saying "the Department of Health and
Safety has always had the capacity (to
stop dangerous research)." Kennedy said
he simply wanted to be "more explicit"
about the department's role in the ad
ministration chain of command.

Kennedy described the proposed
Health and Safety Committee as a policy
committee, explaining that it will "pri
marily be one that guides our policy, not
one which will rule on particular situa
tions." Kennedy said it was not yet es
tablished whether the Department of
Health and Safety would report to the
committee, although SRI recommended
such a step in its report.
Linda Crouse, chief steward of the
United Stanford Workers, said that she
hoped employees would be represented
on the new committee. "Workers who
are affected by it should have an effective
role."
University Director of Operations and
Maintenance Ralph Buchanan supported
the suggestion that workers be included
in the committee. He said that he felt it
was "appropriate that all aspects are rep
resented."
