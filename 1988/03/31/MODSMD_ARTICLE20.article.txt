# Divestment follows Stanford ideals
## 
### 
I have long refrained from submit
ting any commentary to your periodical
concerning divestiture from South
African corporations, as it seemed to
me that the meyor moral and economic
issues involved were very accessible,
obvious and long-standing.
I was much disappointed last Wed
nesday, however, to find that just as
full enlightenment seemed to be reach
ing their eyes, the of Trustees chose to
once again don their narrow aperture,
naively polarized spectacles, and from
that point of view aid the powers that
be in their reluctant process of educa
tion.
Simply and briefly put, it is undenia
ble that financial support of the South
African regime runs in contradiction to

espoused and enacted "Stanford philos
ophy."
The hesitancy on the part of the
Board of Turstees to cease this en
dorsement of apartheid is in direct
conflict with policies of affirmative
action and serves as a tacit standing
insult to all Stanford faculty and stu
dents who are considered to be black.
The recent increase in governmental
suppression of the free speech of anti
apartheid groups and Nobel Laureates
has again demonstrated that the South
African system of national manage
ment is one of unequivocal fascism.
Although you may be at first skepti
cal of the gravity implied by the com
parison, investment in South Africa is
an evolving analogy to a provision of
funding to the industries of Nazi Ger
many via free market avenues.
I daresay that the presence of corpo
rations supporting the agenda of the
Nazi regime within the capital
generating portfolio of Stanford Uni-

versity would be viewed as something
less than supportive or respectful by
those faculty members and students of
Jewish faith.
It would almost certainly be seen as
an endorsement of the worst possible
form of anti-semitic policy and
thought: Thus it is that Stanford in
vestment in South Africa is a $170
million advertisement stating clearly
that, at its administrative roots, Stan
ford stands allied with racist policy
and thought at its most severe.
It is as well clear that the method of
government utilized by South Africa is
antithetical to the agenda put forth in
the foreign policy position of the
United States throughout the rest of
the African continent.
South Africa is not a true demo
cratic state, and the history of the
United States' highest court provides
for us decisive precedent as to the
unacceptable, unethical nature of

segregation ism.
As a Stanford student, and an
auditor of "the American way," it is
intuitively and intellectually obvious
that our present investment policy
continues to provide direct support to
the South African government and its
system of increasingly malevolent
apartheid. This is without question a
policy replete and self-damaging in its
hypocrisy, and is of growing embar
rassment to the entire Stanford com
munity.
Have we in just 43 years forgotten
the world shame and devastation of
allowing a fascist holocaust to rage
unchecked â€” or is it that the black
countenance of these latter day victims
serves to mask to insignificance their
ongoing mutilation?
