## Airlines up in smoke 
### 
IN THE YEARS since the deregulation
of the airline industry, there have
been very few positive things to say
about commercial airlines. All the talk
about fare wars, lost baggage, frightening
accidents, disgruntled employees, air traf
fic problems and poor service makes it
seem that the airline industry's deregu
lation simply untied the strings on the
Pandora's box of travelers' woes.
But in the wake of all the complaints,
we should give notice to one of the
brighter aspects of free competition: the
emergence of innovative policies by en
terprising airlines.
Less than a week ago, Northwest Air
lines, the nation's fifth largest commer
cial air carrier declared its new policy of
prohibiting smoking on all of its domestic
flights. Northwest's new policy will go
into effect on April 23, the same day that
a new federal law banning smoking on
all flights in the United States under two
hours in length will take effect.
Northwest has taken a significant busi
ness risk in creating such a controversial
policy. Their decision should be recog
nized as both intelligent and enterprising.
Smoking during air travel is dangerous
not only to passenger safety, but also to
the health and welfare of fellow non
smoking passengers and airline person
nel. According to the Los Angeles Times,
"the 1986 study of the National Academy
of Sciences provided clear evidence that
segregating smoking passengers from
non-smoking passengers aboard an air
liner is not an effective method of pro

tecting nonsmokers from the hazardous
pollutants in cigarette smoke."
In terms of passenger safety, smoking
is a significant cause of airline accidents,
casualties and conflicts. Allowing
smokers the privelege of smoking during
a flight poses unnecessary risks to all
people involved.
Fires caused by cigarettes smoked in
restrooms and held by sleeping pas
sengers have been responsible for many
fatalities. Just last year, arguments be
tween smokers and airline personnel on
one of the nation's largest carriers got
so out of hand that the belligerent
smoking passengers were arrested after
their flight landed.
Additionally, the risks posed by
smokers add to the phenomenally high
insurance rates of airlines, a cost that is
paid for by consumers in higher fares.
The cost of smoking also includes the
medical insurance and health care costs
incurred by airline employees suffering
from the constant exposure to a smoke
filled, poorly ventilated area.
While smokers have undeniable rights
to their enjoyment of cigarettes, the ques
tion of rights versus safety must be care
fully examined by other major air carri
ers. Smokers' rights end where they
jeopardize the safety of individuals or
interfere with nonsmokers' rights to a
clean, smoke-free and odor-free environ
ment.
The U.S. Surgeon General, C. Everett
Koop, has already announced his warning
that while there is no conclusive evidence,
it is extremely likely that second-hand

smoke in any environment can be just
as dangerous as directly inhaled tobacco
smoke.
Today, with the advent of nonsmoking
restaurant districts in Beverly Hills, non
smoking hospitals, nonsmoking business
places and even restricted outdoor
smoking policies at Stanford, it seems
logical that the skies are the next in line
for a permanent no-smoking policy.
Airline personnel and flight attendants
would clearly benefit from such a policy
â€” their unions have already been asking
air carriers to be more considerate of
their health.
It seems evident that passengers flying
Northwest will have much to gain from
the new policy. No one can be sure as
yet how the new policy will affect North
west's business, but it's likely that it will
increase business from nonsmokers.
Hopefully, this will spur the way for
change among other carriers.
While deregulation has created some
monsterous problems in the airline in
dustry, it's good to see that it has also
opened the way for innovative companies
to prosper based on their self-initiated
policies.
