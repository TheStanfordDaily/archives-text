## The
						agony of ecstasy: exploring a dangerous drug 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Editorial staff 
Ecstasy may be the"in" drug
on campus, but people with brains
might be better off protecting
their gray matter by just saying
no.

Recent medical research has
demonstrated that ecstasy dam
ages a certain type of brain cells
in rodents and monkeys, strongly
suggesting that the drug may be
damaging the brains of its human
users.
Ecstasy's toxicity to the human
brain, however, is still an open
question. No one has tested the
drug in clinical trials and results
from the first medical study of
human users are not yet public.
It is also not known whether
the ecstasy-induced damage is

permanent, what the functional
consequences of that damage are
or what doses of ecstasy will
damage the human brain.
Ecstasy seems to be increas
ingly popular among the nation's
college students. A significant
number of Stanford undergradu
ates have used ecstasy at least
once, according to a recent infor
mal survey done by Stephen
Peroutka, assistant professor of
neurology at the Medical School.
No one has done a large-scale
study of the drug's use, but
reports from a number of colleges
indicate that students throughout
the country are using ecstasy,
Peroutka said.
Classified as an amphetamine
derivative, ecstasy (also called
XTC, Adam, MDMA or MDM)
shares chemical similarities to
both mescaline and the amphet
amines, but seems to have addi
tional properties of its own.
Ecstasy users, who usually take
the drug as a pill or powder, claim
it makes them warm and intro
spective. The drug is neither ad
dicting nor hallucinogenic when
taken in normal doses, Peroutka
said.
"Ninety percent of the students
(in the Stanford survey) who tried
the drug said they felt euphoric,
more verbal and had a sense of
closeness with other individuals,"
Peroutka reported at a January

meeting.
During this same period of eu
phoria, however, students also
report jaw clenching, teeth grind
ing and an increased alertness
that is not conducive to studying,
according to a Feb. 19 article in
Science magazine.
In addition, the drug seems to
produce negative side effects the
day after its use. A significant
number of the students surveyed
reported drowsiness, muscle
aches (including sore jaw
muscles), depression and diffi
culty concentrating.
In mice, rats, guinea pigs and
monkeys, ecstasy damages a spe
cific group of neurons that release
the chemical serotonin as a
neurotransmitter.
As scientists test ecstasy's ef
fects on species that evolved more
and more recently in evolution,
they are finding them increasingly
sensitive to the drug, suggesting
that humans may be among the
most sensitive of all.
The mouse is relatively insensi
tive to the toxic effects of MDMA.
In the rat, a dose that is given
every eight hours in an amount
"10 times stronger than a human
might take destroys up to 80 per
cent of the tips of one class of
nerve cells," Peroutka said.
Ecstasy is five times more toxic
in monkeys than in rats. To cause
the same 80 to 90 percent damage

in the monkey as in the rat, an
oral dose given repeatedly that is
only two to three times the nor
mal human dose is needed, ac
cording to George Ricaurte, assis
tant prof, of neurology at Johns
Hopkins University School of
Medicine.
Ricarde's studies, done in col
laboration with Lisa Forno, a Palo
Alto neuropathologist, are the
most concrete and compelling
evidence of ectacy's effects on the
brain. These studies also demon
strate that MDMA produces ab
normal effects on the main cell
body of certain neurons or brain
cells as well as on the tips.
Although there is still no avail
able evidence that human users
of ecstasy have had symptoms of

brain damage, the results of
Ricaurte's most recent study of
human users are still out. For
now, it seems that human users
might not have damaged enough
of their brain cells so that
symptoms are clinically detec
table, Peroutka said.
Verbal reports of 50 to 100 dif
ferent MDMA users indicate that
the mtyority find the ecstasy ex
perience increasingly negative
with repeated use. In general,
people wait two to three weeks
between doses, Peroutka said.
There is no precedent for a drug
that will show this "tolerance"
effect with such infrequent use.
Users of alcohol and heroin can
become tolerant or less sensitive
to the effects of these drugs but

only after continual or very fre
quent use, Peroutka said.
If it is true that users develop
a tolerance to ecstasy, a possible
explanation might be that ecstasy
is causing permanent changes in
the human brain, according to
Peroutka.
Based on his recent study of
human ecstasy users, Ricaurte
said he did not believe that the
ecstasy experience could become
increasingly negative. "If that
were true, I would not have had
subjects who have used it over
200 times," he said, adding that
he has encountered many individ
uals who have used ecstasy more
than 50 times.
