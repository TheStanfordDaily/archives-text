# Dancing to a different beat

Joe Goode has a history of
challenging convention. Re
garded by many dance critics as
one of the few really serious
dance artists working in the
West, Goode will take time off
from choreographing and per
forming works with his own San
Francisco-based company to
teach Movement For Actors at
Stanford this quarter.
Goode's class is a joint offer
ing of the Dance Division and
Drama department and will
showcase techniques of his con
troversial style of personal
theater. Students need no move
ment background for this class,
which is listed as Drama 27A.
Disarmingly, and sometimes
brutally, frank about issues of
sexuality and power in society,
Goode creates dances that are
on the border between what we
consider movement and what
we regard as theater.
"I think of myself as a fairly
angry person," Goode said in
an interview from his San Fran
cisco apartment last week. "A
lot of my work is generated from
having that anger and having
to process it."
One of three children in a
family headed by two diletante
artists, Goode says his parents'
lack of encouragement actually
helped fuel his desire to make
it as ar> artist.
"If I'd come from an environ
ment that was more supportive
(than my family) ... I don't
think I would have needed to
stand up and make dances," he
said.
Goode is a native of Maine
and later trained as an actor in
New York, performing in odd
off-Broadway shows, Yiddish
Theater musicals and avant
garde theater works before
heading west for San Francisco

in 1979. By the time Goode ar
rived in San Francisco, he was
increasingly discouraged about
the likelihood of succeeding.
"Basically, I was looking for
a pretty place like San Francisco
to inspire me if I couldn't find
any work to inspire me," Goode
said.
Goode's electric dance style is
based on the movement tech
nique formulated by Merce Cun
ningham with the addition of
vocal grunts, dramatic gestures
and complex stage sets. His
performances spin intriguing
tales of private lives in a public
forum.
"Part of the whole post
modern movement to which I
belong has to do with giving
ourselves permission to do and
include things in performance
that were not permitted
before," Goode said.

His signature work, "Twenty
nine Effeminite Gestures," is a
catalogue of limp-wristed sighs,
swooning spins and coy glances
performed by a redneck charac
ter who hauls a chainsaw
around the stage. The dance
bluntly asks if it is the move
ment or the setting that makes
people perceive some gestures
as effeminite and others as
primitive.
"I'm interested in many
things as a dancer: my relation
ship to the world, how I see the
future, how I process the feeling
of nuclear doom that hangs over
us all â€” these things are enor
mously interesting to me,"
Goode said.

Janice Ross, who received an
MA. in dance from Stanford in
1974, is dance critic for The
Tribune of Oakland.
