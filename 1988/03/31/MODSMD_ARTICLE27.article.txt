This is an amateur's book, in
more than one sense of the word.
It is the product of the author's
love of his subject; and when Clas
sical studies are a precarious mi
nority interest, it would be chur
lish on my part to carp at a splen
did journalist and commentator
who has devoted time and trouble
to a problem in Greek history. At
the same time, the book contains
exaggerations, oversimplifica
tions, questionable inferences,
some surprising gaps, and a few
plain mistakes. Secondary litera
ture is often cited as though it
were primary evidence. As a con
tributor to the "Oxford Classical
Dictionary," I know too well that
it is not Holy Writ; and it is alarm
ing to be told that our one-and
only but lamentably inadequate

Greek lexicon, Liddell-Scott-
Jones, is "the court of final judge
ment," when it usually offers us
only a prima facie case negligently
put together.
Maybe you should read the book
as you would read a book I might
write in retirement on some sub
ject I have always loved — chim
panzees, for example, or Domen
ico Scarlatti. It is conceivable that
by good fortune I might say some
thing both original and probable
(about chimps, anyway), but I
think my enthusiasm would need
that prop of fortune.
The problem Stone tackles is
this: Socrates was convicted and
executed by the Athenians in 399
BC because he "did wrong" (i.e.
to the Athenian people) "by not
accepting the same gods as his
fellow-citizens, but introducing
novel supernatural beings; and by
corrupting the young men." As
Hypereides put it (complacently,
not apologetically) two genera
tions later, "he was punished for

what he said." Yet Athens was a
democracy which attached the
highest importance to uncon
strained freedom of speech and
easily tolerated relaxed and scepti
cal attitudes to religion. So, how
did Socrates provoke the At
henians into betraying a funda
mental principle of their own de
mocracy?
One contemporary, Polykrates,
strongly hostile to Socrates,
stressed Socrates' long association
with Alcibiades, whose self
serving exploitation of the democ
racy and intermittent spells of
treason were not remembered af
fectionately, and with Kritias, the
monstrous leader of the Thirty
Tyrants in 404-3 BC. Stone
stresses this too, and I think he
is right. Making such accusations
at the trial itself would have
created some ill-feeling against
the accusers for openly flouting
the oath of amnesty sworn (under
the stern eye of an army of oc
cupation) in 403; but there were
men in the jury who had lost
friends and relations under the
Thirty Tyrants. Stone emphasises
the fact that Plato and Xenophon
consistently represent Socrates as
arrogantly contemtuous of democ
racy, devoted to the ideal of rule
by the one strong and wise ruler
who "knows best," and strikingly
deficient in compassion for the
poor and the weak. They portray,
moreover, a Socrates who was de
termined on martyrdom in 399.
This is refreshing stuff, not ab
solutely new (it was a line fol
lowed by some 18th-century writ

ere whose essays were collected
and edited by Mario Montuori in
1981 under the title "De Socrate
Juste Damnato") but long sub
merged; and Stone is not just re
inventing for the nth time what
Plato and Xenophon say, but
turning an enviably sharp eye on
to what they do not say.
Since Socrates left nothing in
writing, we have to get through
to him, if we can, by interpreta
tion of the several "Socrates" of
Plato, Xenophon and Aristop
hanes. I would add fragmentary
glimpses of Lysias' "Socrates," a
teacher whose pupils, accustomed
to "serious discussions of justice
and virtue," could be expected to
maintain high standards of
probity, and Aristoxenos* "Soc
rates," capable of terrifying anger
and indefatigable in the pursuit
of women. Well, plenty of people
left no written works — Perildes
and Alexander, for instance —
and we can get through to them
only via what others wrote. But
we have very strong reasons for
thinking that Plato progressively
put into his "Socrates"
philosophical theories which were
entirely his own and unknown to
Socrates. If theories, then why
not values and attidudes also?
Stone is aware of that problem,
but does not always keep it in
mind. Anyone who tries to explain
the condemnation of Socrates by
reference to the political attitudes
of "Socrates" has adopted,
whether he knows it or not, a
very definite answer to a desper

ately intractable question.
One element in the situation in
399 B.C. is greatly underrated by
Stone. Through most of the fifth
century 8.C., the Athenian de
mocracy, by combining aggressive
imperialism with a passion for the
arts and a steady welcome for res
ident aliens, had made Athens
uniquely wealthy and powerful.
Success generated extraordinary
self-confidence and with it a
feeling that Athenian temples and
festivals had secured the special
favor of the gods. Then came the
Peloponnesian War, and, at the
end of it, total defeat, siege,
starvation, and the threat of ex
termination. Just as "there are
no atheists in foxholes" (a saying
which tells us nothing about gods
but much about humans), so
those who question conventional
religion have their backs to the
wall when all around them are
asking, in anger and fear and
despair, "What went wrong?"
Divine favor had patently been
withdrawn from Athens. Could it

'No other trial, ex
cept that of Jesus,
has left so vivid an
impression on the
imagination of
Western man as
that of Socrates.'
— I.F. Stone

be that the gods had after all been
alienated by the unconventional
philosophical and theological
probings which the Athenian up
per class had enjoyed? Might it
not be prudent to repudiate these
subversive tendencies by spectac
ular revenge on the only well
known philosopher available? By
395 B.C. circumstances had
changed, and the mood had
passed; but while it lasted, Ath
ens' proud role as "educator of
the Greek world" was in suspense.
