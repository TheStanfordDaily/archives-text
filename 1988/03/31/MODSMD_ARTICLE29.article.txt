## If it's Stanford vs. California, it must be big 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The football Big Game be
t tween Stanford and Califor
nia rarely lives up to its
name: it's hardly ever big,
and as in the case of the
routs of the last two years,
it's often not much of a

game.
This weekend's series between the Cal
ifornia and Stanford baseball teams prom
ises to be much more than that. In fact,
it will be three big games in as many days,
as the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division-leading Golden Bears and second
place Cardinal fight for first place in the
league.
The three-game series opens at 2:30 p.m.
today at Sunken Diamond, hops the Bay
for a 2:30 p.m. start at Evans Diamond in
Berkeley tomorrow, then closes at 1 p.m.
Saturday back at Sunken Diamond.
The Bears (9-3 in league and 24-11 over
all after being swept last weekend by Loyola
Marymount in a non-league series) will be
trying to cement their hold on the league
lead, while the Cardinal (7-4 and 20-10
and tied for second in the league with
USC) is looking to reverse its direction
after being swept by Arizona State in
Tempe, Ariz., last weekend.
"Up to this point, this is the biggest
series in our lives," Cardinal catcher Doug
Robbins said. "We need to win two out of
three — a sweep would be nice, but we
need two out of three. If we get swept or
lose two out of three, we'll really have our
backs against the wall."
Trailing the Golden Bears by 1-1/2 games
going into the weekend, the Cardinal will
put freshman Mike Mussina (4-1 with a
3.71 ERA) on the mound today. Senior Lee
Plemel (4-3, 4.81) started the first game
of Stanford's first four Six-Pac series, in

eluding the opener in Tempe last Friday,
but also threw in relief on Sunday against
Arizona State. He'll rest today and will
start either tomorrow or Saturday, with
freshman Stan Spencer (4-1, 3.04) starting
the other game for the Cardinal, Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said.

'Up to this point, this
is the biggest series in
our lives If we get
swept or lose two out
of three, we'll really
have our backs against
the wall.'

The Bears probably will counter with
Mark Juhas (5-0, 2.95) today and Travis
Willis (6-4, 4.25) tomorrow. Cal's starter
for Saturday has not been named.
Cal has surprised many observers with
its hot start in the Six-Pac. The Bears
were 12-18 in the conference last year, but
opened the league season this year by
beating Arizona twice in Tucson and sweep
ing Arizona State in Tempe. Having already
won five out of six in the two toughest
places to play in the conference, the Bears
must be considered a serious title contender
in the powerhouse Six-Pac.
"They're definitely for real," Robbins
said. "They've been doing it all year —
we're not going to overlook them."



Stanford freshman pitcher Mike Mussina gets the starting call in today's opener of the series against California.
Mussina (4-1, 3.71 ERA), will try to help the Cardinal close ground with the first-place Golden Bears.
