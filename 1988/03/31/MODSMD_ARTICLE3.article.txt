# Green Library extends late-night hours
## 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
The nerd march is no more.
In response to a recommendation by the
Academic Council Committee on Libraries,
Green Library has extended its hours until
midnight Monday through Thursday and Sun
day.
The move brings to an end a long-time
Stanford tradition known as the "nerd
march," which was the nightly walk by stu
dents leaving Green at its 11 p.m. closing for
Meyer Library next door in order to gain one
more hour of studying before Meyer's mid
night closing.
The circulation desk and East Stacks will
remain open an additional eight hours per
week until June 8. However, hours for the
reference desk, current periodicals and the
government documents library will remain un
changed.
In addition to extended weekday hours, the

'This experiment doesn't rep
resent a commitment on our
part to extend the hours per
manently.'
— David Weber

library will remain open Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m.
The extended hours were approved by li
brary officials because the cost for spring is
reasonable, according to University Libraries
Director David Weber. Those administrators
will decide this summer whether to perma
nently adopt the extended hours, Weber said.
"This experiment doesn't represent a com
mitment on our part to extend the hours
permanently," Weber added. "Once the data
from the spring is in hand, we will make our

evaluation."
Junior Mitch Steinberger, a student mem
ber of the library committee, said that al
though students and faculty have grumbled
for years about Green's "notoriously" short
hours, complaints were not articulated
through University channels previous to the
library committee's recommendation to Weber
last December.
"As students, we just assumed that the
University would take care of the problem,"
Steinberger said. "I mean, the situation with
Green annoyed me, but I never openly com
plained about it."
Joan Krasner, head of Access Services at
Green, pointed out that the library's current
hours are roughly comparable, if not longer,
than hours kept by the undergraduate libra
ries at Columbia, Princeton, UC-Berkeley,
Harvard, Michigan and UCLA.
"People would like to have infinitely long
hours," Weber said, but "one simply has to
realize that we have a limited budget."
