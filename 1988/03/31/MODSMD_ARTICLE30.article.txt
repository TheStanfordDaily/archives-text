Apparently tne
pollsters know
what they are
talking about.
The top-ranked
USC men's volley
ball team came to

Maples Pavilion last night and
showed Stanford that, yes, they
are that good. The 15-9, 15-0, 15-6
victory brought the Trojans'
record to 23-2, 13-0 in the West
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation while Stanford fell to
10-15. The 12th-ranked Cardinal
is currently in eighth place in
WTVA with a 4-9 mark.
The Cardinal came out tough
in the first game, but USC was
just too strong at the net. Two
time All-America Tom Duke
tallied 10 kills in the first game
alone and the Trojans recorded
six stuff blocks to take the game.
"We started off OK. Like we
always do, we came out pretty
decently," Stanford sophomore
Dan Hanan said. "Realizing USC
is a more than decent team, we
folded when they made a bunch
of great plays. . . . We talked about
it before the match and we knew
they would do some great things.
We were just going to have to
blow that off — but we didn't."
Game two was a nightmare for
the Cardinal. The Trojans served
first and the score was 5-0 before
the Cardinal even sided-out.
Things did not get much better
for Stanford as the visitors
cruised through the game.
