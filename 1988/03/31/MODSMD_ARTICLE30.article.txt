Apparently tne
pollsters know
what they are
talking about.
The top-ranked
USC men's volley
ball team came to

Maples Pavilion last night and
showed Stanford that, yes, they
are that good. The 15-9, 15-0, 15-6
victory brought the Trojans'
record to 23-2, 13-0 in the West
ern Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation while Stanford fell to
10-15. The 12th-ranked Cardinal
is currently in eighth place in
WTVA with a 4-9 mark.
The Cardinal came out tough
in the first game, but USC was
just too strong at the net. Two
time All-America Tom Duke
tallied 10 kills in the first game
alone and the Trojans recorded
six stuff blocks to take the game.
"We started off OK. Like we
always do, we came out pretty
decently," Stanford sophomore
Dan Hanan said. "Realizing USC
is a more than decent team, we
folded when they made a bunch
of great plays. . . . We talked about
it before the match and we knew
they would do some great things.
We were just going to have to
blow that off — but we didn't."
Game two was a nightmare for
the Cardinal. The Trojans served
first and the score was 5-0 before
the Cardinal even sided-out.
Things did not get much better
for Stanford as the visitors
cruised through the game.

Sophomore Dan Hanan soared to record 15 kills last night.

swing hitter Dave Johnson said,
"(but) we should have passed a
lot better. We were too tentative
passing."
Hanan, a 6-foot-5 middle block
er, agreed. "[Stanford's passing]
was bad enough that we couldn't
run the middle (attack)," he said.
"It took us out of our offense. We
had to set outside a lot; a lot of
fours (a high set to the left-side
outside hitter). They knew what
we were doing."
The third game was closer, but
USC had little problem after they
took the lead for good at 5-4.
Duke, a 6-6 junior, continued to
excel, producing kills from both
the back and front rows. He
finished with a match-high 20
kills and a .594 hitting percent
age.
"We were going to send one

commit guy (a blocker keying
solely on Duke) on him in every
rotation, sometimes disregarding
one hitter," Han an commented,
"(but) he's a good hitter. Overall,
I think our blocking was unor
ganized."
The blocking problems only ex
acerbated the situation on a night
when Stanford's digging was
somewhat off. "I was surprised
we didn't [dig better]," Johnson
said. "When you're playing the
No. 1 team in the country you
should be psyched to come out
and lip them off the court."
The fact of the matter, though,
was that the Trojans played the
better defense. "You have to give
them credit; USC came to play,"
Johnson added.
"I thought we served one of our
best matches," he said. "They
passed really well. They're just a
side-out machine."
Hanan led the Cardinal with 15
kills and a .345 hitting percent
age, and Johnson provided a spark
off the bench with six quick digs.
