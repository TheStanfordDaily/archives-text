Cycling
After hammering its way close to an
all-time collegiate record at a March 6 race
at Sonoma State, the Stanford cycling team
fielded smaller squads with correspond
ingly less spectacular results at four sub
sequent races held over spring break.
The Cardinal dominated the competition
at the criterium races hosted by Sonoma
St. before vacation and came within 11
points of breaking the collegiate record for
point-scoring. The men's A team captured
seven of the top 10 spots in its race, with
Stanford's Mike Fadich and Eugene Sar
gent tying for first. Coulter Richardson,
John Coyle, Steve Miller, Brock LaPorte
and Hank Dart rounded out the Card's
sweep of the results.
The women's team also did well, with
Pam Stevenson and Kaye Wagner of Stan
ford riding away with first and fourth
places in the women's field. The next
weekend's racing took place in Fresno
March 20-21 and was hosted by Fresno
State. Decimated by the loss of many
cyclists to illness, injuries and vacation,
Stanford had a much poorer showing. In
the hillclimb, Miller's first place in the A
race was the high point of the day.
The results of Sunday's road race, again
in Fresno, reflected the team's diminished
size. Only one Stanford A rider, LaPorte,
placed in the top 12. The women's race
was more encouraging for the Card, with
Wagner and Weiher finishing fourth and
sixth.
Last weekend's racing in Berkeley fea
tured yet more grueling conditions. The
Cardinal's racers did not fare well in Sat
urday's hot and hilly road race. Though
Fadich captured second in the A race, only
Card cyclists Miller and LaPorte were able
to score additional points in this field. Wag
ner again took fourth in the women's race,
with Ami Laws gutting it out for 15th.
The net result for the Stanford team of
the past month's worth of racing has been
to place it in sixth place in the Western
Collegiate Conference behind powerhouse
teams UC-San Diego, San Diego State, UC-

Santa Barbara, Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
and California.
Ultimate Frisbee
Though its 24-game winning streak was
broken, Stanford's ultimate frisbee team
won both of the tournaments it entered
to bring its current status to six tourna
ment victories this year.
At the annual Miami (Fla.) Springbreak
Tournament, held at Dade College, Stan
ford scored two crushing wins but lost in
the last game of the day to the tourna
ment's No. 3 seed, the Miami Refugees,
15-13 in a foul-plagued match.
Despite this defeat, the Cardinal quali
fied for the quarterfinals, where it was
matched against No. 1 seed Gainesville.
After trailing 8-5 at halftime, Stanford re
covered its composure and won the game
by a 15-13 count.
After a convincing 15-11 win against a
combination Atlanta/Dallas team, Stanford
moved on to the finals against the upstart
Central Florida team. The Cardinal played
a flawless second half and raced to a 15-8
victory. It was the first time that a Stanford
team had won an "open" tournament since
Stanford's college national team did so in
1984.
The team then traveled to Daytona Beach
to compete in the National Collegiate
Sports Festival. The Cardinal swept
through a disappointingly weak field to
take the crown and earn a return trip to
Daytona in September for the finals.
Judo
On March 26, six Stanford judo team mem
bers participated in the annual National
Collegiate Judo Tournament, held this year
at San Jose State.
Freshman Mike Takata, a second-degree
black belt with international experience,
led the team with a second-place win in
the men's heavyweight division.
