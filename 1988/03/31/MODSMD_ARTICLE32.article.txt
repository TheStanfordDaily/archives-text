# Men's hoops earns standing ovation

A funny thing happened to the
Stanford men's basketball team
on the way to the NIT. Slowly
but surely, game night at Maples
Pavilion moved away from the sit
down-and-be-entertained
syndrome.

The games became events, and
this is a good thing.
Beginning with the season
opening humdinger against Santa
Clara, through the sellout rout of
Harvard and the amazing double
overtime victory over UCLA, the
Cardinal crowd actually got into
the games.
After Christmas break, the stu
dents began to arrive early to get
good seats. Way early. Then they
began to stand up throughout the

entire ball game. The clincher
came when the Stanford students
waved to the old fogies and locals
in the stands across the court,
urging them to get on their feet.
And by god they did. Cardinal
guard Scott Meinert remarked
that it wasn't like goin£ to the
opera anymore. "The people sit
ting behind the bench don't yell
at us to sit down like they used
to," he said.
A couple of Stanford assistant
coaches talked about creating an
atmosphere where the games be
come a participatory sport for the
fans, rather than a spectator
sport.
It all came to fruition at the
Arizona game. The Wildcats'
postseason guide describes the
event like this: "Stanford am
bushed Arizona before a rocking
crowd in the Cardinal's Maples
Pavilion, 82-74. Arizona shot rea
sonably well (.627), but was out
shot, out-rebounded, out
turnovered and out-blocked by the
fired-up Cardinal."
And everyone got their wish
when the fans participated in a
wild celebratory romp on the

The people sitting
behind the bench
don't yell at us to sit
down.'
— Scott Meinert

court after the game — with the
implied message, "We're never
going to lose at home again."
Well, the Cardinal did lose two
heartbreakers at home, to Oregon
State and then to Arkansas State
in the NIT. After Arkansas State
guard Rhon Johnson sank the
winning free throw with no time
left on the clock, the fans really
didn't want to leave. Maples had
become a fun place to be.
The fans saw a Cardinal team
which will only lose center Greg
Butler to graduation, and will wel
come back center Eric Reveno
from the redshirt list. The fans
saw a Cardinal team which was
up and down all year, but almost
always in the thick of any game.
When Bryan McSweeney added

some scoring and rebounding
punch at the small forward posi
tion, the fans saw a frighteningly
balanced team. Next year that
team will have another year of
strength and experience under its
belt.
In the postgame gloom of the
Arkansas State defeat, Stanford
Coach Mike Montgomery assessed
Stanford's banner season with an
eye on the future.
"Our goal is to play our best
every game, and we didn't feel
like we've done that consistently
this year. That's something we've
got to work on," Montgomery
said. "We're not mentally tough
enough. We don't approach every
game the same like we should.
"We don't respect every oppon
ent the same like we should.
Hopefully we can learn from the
things we're not doing right now."
All those things Montgomery
mentioned are things that the
players can control. They can't
always control their shooting, or
the playing conditions. But if they
can come out like gangbusters for
every game, next year could be
an even better year for the fans.
