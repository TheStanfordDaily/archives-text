# Cheryl Doo-good

"Apathetic" is one word that
cannot be used to describe
Cheryl Doo.
Anyone who has been to a
Cardinal women's gymnastics
meet this season has certainly
heard Doo's powerful voice of
fering encouragement to her
teammates.
Freshman teammate Julie
Dunhill summed it up best:
"She's our loudest supporter.
Whenever we go to a meet and
she's not there, you can tell
the difference — it's really

quiet. She really gets you
motivated."
Others were quick to step in
to support Dunhill's assertions.
"[Doo] is a real cheerleader,
and in terms of getting
everybody psyched up, it's im
portant," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina said.
Teammate Shari Evenson, a
junior, said, "Her voice, not
just in what she says, but in
the constant effort that she
makes in continuing to say
things, really helps."

Junior Cheryl Doo is as vocal as she is talented.
"Even in practice," added Dun
hill, "she's always yelling for you
— it doesn't matter if she's on
the same event. You can hear her
across the gym."
This may make it sound as if
Doo does not even have to suit
up to help the team, but Doo's
contributions extend far beyond
offering moral support — she con
sistently earns excellent marks to
add to the team score.
Her best event is the floor ex
ercise, where her energetic dance
steps impress the judges and
dazzle the crowd. "She really
knows how to get the crowd into
it," said Sardina.
Doo's high-energy program set
to Billy Ocean's "Caribbean
Queen" has earned a 9.45 this
season, the third-highest score on
the squad. But possibly a more
important contribution than her

floor performance is her cus
tomary leadoff position on balance
beam, where her consistently
strong routines give confidence to
the rest of the team.
"[A leadoff gymnast] can set up
a tempo or take away tempo,"
Sardina said. "Cheryl can focus
on getting through routines."
This focus has earned her the
second-highest beam score on the
team this season, a 9.35.
Her value to the team is not
new to this season, however; she
has been a contributing force ever
since she first entered Stanford
as a walk-on athlete at the begin
ning of the 1986 season.
Heavily desired by Stanford as
a walk-on candidate during a very
successful senior year at Punahou
High School in Honolulu, Hawaii,
Doo said, "I didn't know what to
expect from collegiate gymnastics,
but I was willing to try it."
She tried, and she succeeded in
a big way. She led the team on
floor her first year and was among
the top performers in every other

event. These accomplishments
earned her the titles of Most Con
sistent Gymnast and Most Valu
able Athlete. "That is impressive
for anyone, scholarshipped or
not," commented Sardina.
High expectations from her
rookie success, in addition to the
responsibility of being team co
captain the next year, led to what
she termed a "sophomore slump".
In all, the year was "a nightmare."
"She would get more frustrated
because she felt she was letting
the team down more," observed
Sardina. "But you can't help
anyone if you can't help yourself.
Captains tend to lose that focus."
"Even though she was having
a bad year, she was not trying to
bring that upon others and bring
everyone else down," added Even
son. "She was still trying to keep
everyone else up."
Two things contributed to
Doo's turnaround this season.
One was an increased amount of
training in the off-season to
develop her cardiovascular fit

ness. The rmgor factor, though,
was a change in mental attitude.
"She came in with the same
expectaions (as she had sopho
more year), but the difference is,
she let herself stay more focused,"
said Sardina.
While maintaining this focus,
Doo still sees aspects of her per
formance which can be improved.
In particular, she admits that she
has a lot of work to do on uneven
parallel bars and has room for
more difficulty in her floor exer
cise, including a double-back
which she has yet to use in com
petition.
These improvements, along
with maintaining consistency on
beam and perfecting her new
vault, a front double-somersault,
are her goals for the remainder
of this season and next season.
"Cheryl has a pretty incredible
motivational drive," Evenson
said. "When she puts her mind
to do something, she wants to do
it, and she'll push herself to do it."
