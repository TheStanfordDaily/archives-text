They saved the
best for last.
The Stanford
men's golf team
came sizzling back
to a 12th-place tie
Wednesday in the

final round of the Western Inter
collegiate at Pasatiempo due
largely to the efforts of its last
qualifier, playing his last shot on
the last hole of the tournament.
The Cardinal was led by Don
Christensen, who fired one of the
day's best rounds, a one-over-par
72. The sophomore had an up
and-down round Wednesday, es
pecially on the final nine holes.
He had two birdies and two eagles
in that span, including an eagle
on the par-five 18th hole. On that
hole, he put his final shot, a one
iron, into the cup from 190 yards
out.
According to Christensen, he
was only trying to lay up short
of the green, but he missed the
shot and ended up with an eagle
three. "I hit the shot in the gen
eral direction I wanted to, but I
pulled it about yards off line
and it rolled into the hole."
Christensen led Stanford wire
to-wire at Pasatiempo, with the
low medal score in all three
rounds. His three round total of
225 (76-77-72) was good enough
to tie him for eighth overall in
the contest. Bruce Bockbank of
Brigham Young took the low
medalist title with a 71 in the
last round and a total of 215.
Second-round leader Steve
Strieker finished second with a
total of 218.
The host team of the tourna
ment, San Jose State, took the
team title with 1,136 strokes, fol
lowed by New Mexico at 1,142.
Stanford's three-round total of
1,173 enabled the Cardinal to im
prove four spots from Tuesday.
"It was not a gorgeous round,
but it worked," Christensen said
of the team's performance.
The conditions at Pasatiempo
were very windy and similar to
the first round of the tournament
when the scores were high. Soph
omore Mark Funseth was Stan
ford's second-best scorer with a
76 in the final round and a total
of 235.

Other than the top two, Stan
ford's scores were less than stellar
in the final 18. Sophomore Josh
Zander and junior John Mahon
finished up with identical 79s
while sophomore Mike Hubly
carded an 84.
Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin
was pleased with the team's over
all performance. "They really
came on today," he said. "The pin

placements were impossible. Mark
(Funseth) had to fight the whole
way to get a 76.
"This tournament was much
more indicative of the team we
are," Goodwin continued. "After
being paired with (top-ranked)
Arizona and Arizona State at
Fresno and doing so poorly, the
guys really came back well."
Both Goodwin and his latest

star player are looking forward to
good times ahead. "I feel like
we're not firing on all cylinders
yet," Goodwin said, "but we're
getting real close. It will come,
but it will take time."
The golf team will play its next
competitive match April 8-9 at the
Stanford Golf Course when it
hosts the Stanford/U.S. Intercol
legiate.
