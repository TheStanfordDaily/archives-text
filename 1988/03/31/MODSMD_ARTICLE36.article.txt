# Synchro: the ups and drowns
## 
### Julie Yamato 
When you think about synchronized swimming,
you may think of Esther Williams and her 1940
"water ballet" movie musicals.
But if you watch a synchro meet, you will not
see Hollywood floating formations, but athletes com
bining gymnastics, dance and figure skating in and
under the water. And almost no synchronized swim
ming team is better to watch than Stanford's, which
took second at last weekend's NCAA Championships
in Richmond, Va.
That's not to say there isn't a bit of Hollywood
in the sport. Many preparations are made for a
meet. About an hour before competition, to look as
uniform as possible, each swimmer puts her hair
in a bun, attaching a fake bun if necessary. The
swimmers use gelatin to harden and secure the hair
so that not one strand falls out of place.
Each team has matching suits — usually studded
with rhinestones — that are similar to skating
costumes. The swimmers put on noseclips and carry
extras on their suits.
Then, serious competition begins. The first part
is figures, which count for about half the total
score. Figures are comparable to the school figures
in ice skating.
The routines are next. They begin with "deck
work," which is a short dance on land done before
jumping in the water. This is not judged itself, but
it is important for presentation and first impres
sions.
When the swimmers jump in the water, they
must move immediately because they can't hear
the music amid all the bubbles. The music is
projected through an underwater speaker that is
connected to a stereo system.
The swimmers spend the next three or four
minutes alternatively "eggbeatering" (treading
water) vigorously or performing underwater
maneuvers. The underwater portions can last up

to 45 seconds, doing upside-down verticles, spins,
twists and other "hybrids."
"Routines are the hardest because you have to
combine figures with strokes and you have to fit
it to music," said freshman Amy Brown, a veteran
synchro swimmer.
From a spectator's point of view, it's supposed
to look easy, as if Esther Williams were doing it.
"You have to entertain the audience," said senior
Rochelle Guiterrez, "smiling even though it's hard
with a noseclip on, pretending you're not tired,
faking the fact that you have absolutely no air in
your lungs and you're about to pass out."
"I wonder how many brain cells you lose holding
you breath," Brown wondered facetiously.
Stanford Co-Coach Andy Maisel joked, "You don't
have to worry — if you pass out in the water, we
have four minutes to pull you out before you're
brain dead."
Despite their levity, fainting occurs in the figures
more oflen than one might think. Last year an
experienced Stanford swimmer passed out during
a figures competition.
"It's not just holding your breath," said the swim
mer, "it's overexertion."
"It's not uncommon on a sub-crane (a type of
figure) to pass out. In that figure the position of
the head can block blood vessels that carry oxygen
to the brain," commented Co-Coach Vicky Weir.
She also said that in a national competition, it is
common for two or three people to pass out in
figures.
Looking beyond the vain glamour, synchro is
really a very athletic sport. "People don't realize
that synchro is more than just floating around,"
said sophomore Lisa Hellman. Practices consist of
weight training, underwater drills, land drills,
sprints, hypoxic sets, eggbeater and routines. The
team works out four times a week, including two
6 a.m. practices and a three-and-a-half hour Sunday

practice.
The hours of practice paid off last weekend at
Richmond, as the team placed second at NCAAs.
Sophomore Ginny Cohn took first in the solo com
petition, and teammate Debbie Brear took fourth.
Together they placed third in duet, and, teamed
with senior Ruth Weinberg, they took second in trio.

And, for the second year in a row, Weinberg
grabbed national champoinship honors in senior
figures. Cohn, Brear and Weinberg were named
All-American synchro swimmers.
Stanford's novice team finished ninth at Rich
mond, despite the fact it was competing against
varsity-level swimmers.

"Routines are the hardest because you have to
combine figures with strokes and you have to fit
it to music," said freshman Amy Brown, a veteran
synchro swimmer.
From a spectator's point of view, it's supposed
to look easy, as if Esther Williams were doing it.
"You have to entertain the audience," said senior
Rochelle Guiterrez, "smiling even though it's hard
with a noseclip on, pretending you're not tired,
faking the fact that you have absolutely no air in
your lungs and you're about to pass out."
"I wonder how many brain cells you lose holding
you breath," Brown wondered facetiously.
Stanford Co-Coach Andy Maisel joked, "You don't
have to worry — if you pass out in the water, we
have four minutes to pull you out before you're
brain dead."
Despite their levity, fainting occurs in the figures
more oflen than one might think. Last year an
experienced Stanford swimmer passed out during
a figures competition.
"It's not just holding your breath," said the swim
mer, "it's overexertion."
"It's not uncommon on a sub-crane (a type of
figure) to pass out. In that figure the position of
the head can block blood vessels that carry oxygen
to the brain," commented Co-Coach Vicky Weir.
She also said that in a national competition, it is
common for two or three people to pass out in
figures.
Looking beyond the vain glamour, synchro is
really a very athletic sport. "People don't realize
that synchro is more than just floating around,"
said sophomore Lisa Hellman. Practices consist of
weight training, underwater drills, land drills,
sprints, hypoxic sets, eggbeater and routines. The
team works out four times a week, including two
6 a.m. practices and a three-and-a-half hour Sunday

practice.
The hours of practice paid off last weekend at
Richmond, as the team placed second at NCAAs.
Sophomore Ginny Cohn took first in the solo com
petition, and teammate Debbie Brear took fourth.
Together they placed third in duet, and, teamed
with senior Ruth Weinberg, they took second in trio.

And, for the second year in a row, Weinberg
grabbed national champoinship honors in senior
figures. Cohn, Brear and Weinberg were named
All-American synchro swimmers.
Stanford's novice team finished ninth at Rich
mond, despite the fact it was competing against
varsity-level swimmers.

no casualties.
