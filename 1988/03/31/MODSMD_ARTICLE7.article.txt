# And the survey says...
## Seniors give Stanford mixed reviews 
### Matt Poppe Staff writer 
A majority of this year's grad
uating seniors are critical of the
University's academic advising
programs and the lack of faculty
accessibility, according to a survey
released Tuesday.
The University survey, con
ducted annually, asks seniors to
evaluate many aspects of Stanford
life, including the quality of
courses and faculty, < distribution
requirements, financial aid and
student services such as libraries
and Cowell Health Center.
Although seniors rated the Uni
versity favorably in most
categories — 82 percent of those
who responded rated the general
quality of education as "very
good" or "excellent" — the overall
education quality rating was down
6 percent from last year.
General academic advising suf
fered the most, with 43 percent
of the seniors calling it "poor"
and another 25 percent calling it
"fair."

Freshman Advising Coordina
tor Andree Sursock attributed
this poor response to the fact that
the survey only questioned
seniors. She said that "advisers
are trained more thoroughly" now
than they were two years ago and
that they are generally more
"committed."
Only 45 percent of the respond
ing seniors rated faculty acces
sibility "very good" or "excellent."
Conceding that these results may
be a "cause for concern," Univer
sity Provost James Rosse ex
plained that Stanford's role as a
research institution "means fac
ulty members won't always be
available" to students because
they are involved in research.
A majority of the seniors said
the University nurtured intellec
tual achievement and free and
open discussion to a "great ex
tent." Thirty-eight percent, how
ever, said Stanford fostered intel
lectual achievement only to "some
extent" or "no extent."
Financial problems constrained
one-in-10 students in the areas of

research, honors work, volunteer
service and participation in
campus cultural events, according
to the seniors who responded to
the survey.
The survey was developed by
the Educational Research Group,
an informal committee consisting
of staff members from several
University departments. Accord
ing to Ann Porteus, director of
the group, the survey is a way
for the University to "learn about
itself and for seniors to "do a
little reflecting on their experi
ence at Stanford."
Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion Thomas Wasow said that "a
number of pieces of (the survey's)
data are worth taking note of,"
but he criticized the survey's poor
response rate. Only 31 percent of
the 1,540 seniors who were sent
surveys returned them. Citing the
very low return rates for Latinos
(25 percent) and blacks (14 per
cent), Wasow added that the
seniors who responded to the sur
vey were "not a random sam
pling."
