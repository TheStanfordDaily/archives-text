# Reagan proposes upping student aid
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Big increases for student aid
and university research and de
velopment topped President
Reagan's domestic priorities in
his federal budget proposal for
fiscal 1989, which he submitted
to Congress in February.
If approved by Congress, the
increases in education
spending would increase
federal support for student aid
by nine percent to $8.8 billion
and support for basic research
by six percent to $10.3 billion.
After consistently cutting ed
ucation spending during his
two terms as president, Reagan
is recommending record levels
of federal spending on educa
tion in a significant policy shift.
Nevertheless, University of
ficials expressed caution about
the budget's effect on Stanford
finances. University President
Donald Kennedy said, "I am
wary of commenting on admin
istration budgets because they
don't contain any ultimate ob
ligation for expenditures."
Director of Financial Aids
Robert Huff also responded
cautiously. "I'm very enthusi
astic," Huff said, "but I'm not
holding my breath until we see
[Reagan's proposal! translate
into actual dollars for stu
dents."
Huff expressed concern
about budget constraints
passed last fall by Congress to
reduce the federal deficit.
However, according to Mike
Becker, a spokesman for the
Department of Education,
House committees have al
ready approved Reagan's pro
posal for increased education
spending, and Senate commit
tees are now considering the
budget.
"We expect [Reagan's

budget] to be on the floor of
both houses this week," Becker
said Tuesday.
As far as education spending
is concerned, Becker said he
"has no fear" the administra
tion's proposal will be approved
despite budget constraints.
Spending for the Departments
of Defense and Commerce will
be cut to compensate for in
creased education spending, he
said.
Budget allocations for stu
dent aid are "forward-funded,"
so the proposed student aid in
creases would affect the 1989-
90 academic year.
Stanford participates in five
federal student aid programs.
According to Huff, students
receive the largest amount of
money — $10 million per year
— through the Guaranteed
Student Loan program, and an
other $4 million through Na
tional Direct Student Loans,
recently renamed the Perkins
Plan. Reagan's proposal does
not seek major changes in
either programs.
The University also receives
$900,000 through the College
Work-Study program and
$800,000 through Supplemen
tal Educational Opportunity
Grants.
To receive these funds, in
stitutions would be required by
the Reagan administration pro
posal to establish "student
outcome objectives" to measure
how much students had
learned, how many students
had graduated and how many
had obtained jobs with student
aid. Institutions that meet
their "objectives" would receive
more money.
It remains unclear though
how institutions are supposed
to calculate such "objectives."
Huff said, "Stanford wouldn't be at all
disadvantaged by [Reagan's work-study]
plan."
Finally, students receive $900,000 in Pell
Grants, which presently give needy stu
dents a maximum of $2,200 per year. The
Reagan proposal would increase the max
imum to $2,300.
Huff said the University is not in "dire
straits" in providing student aid, but he
added that "the more federal aid available"
gives the University "more flexibility . . .
to use other resources for other purposes."
Congressional approval of Reagan's
budget proposal would increase not only
financial aid but also funding for basic
research. Half of the $10.3 billion allocated
for basic research — a six percent increase
from last year — would go to researchers
at colleges and universities in fiscal year
1989, which begins Oct. 1, 1988.
Basic research, generally conducted at
universities, is aimed strictly at increasing
knowledge about the natural world, as op
posed to industrial research, which involves
a profit motive, according to Robert Byer,
vice provost and dean of research. However,
he added that often the distinction is not
clear cut.
Byer said, "Federal funds are always the

bulk and will remain the bulk" of research
monies for faculty and graduate students.
Stanford has received around 2.3 percent
of all federal basic research funds for the
past decade and has long remained one of
the top five research universities in the
nation in terms of federal funds received,
Byer said.
He added that Stanford's overall research
activities increase proportionally as federal
support for basic research increases.
To gain federal support for research proj
ects, faculty members submit proposals to
various funding agencies, such as the Na
tional Science Foundation and the National
Institutes of Health, which evaluate pro
posals and distribute money.
The Reagan budget seeks to increase
NSF funds 19 percent in hopes of doubling
the foundation's budget by 1992. The pres
ident's proposal would also award the NIH
a 5.4 percent increase, excluding money
for AIDS research.
Reagan aims to increase spending on
AIDS research alone by 35 percent, to over
$860 million. The greater portion of NIH
and NSF funds are presently spent on AIDS
research.
Byer said the School of Medicine, which
conducts AIDS, biotechnology and bioen
gineering research, is a "big component"
of University research. Medical School re
search funds would increase propor
tionately to the final federal increase of
NSF and NIH funds.

he added that often the distinction is not
clear cut.
Byer said, "Federal funds are always the

bulk and will remain the bulk" of research
monies for faculty and graduate students.
Stanford has received around 2.3 percent
of all federal basic research funds for the
past decade and has long remained one of
the top five research universities in the
nation in terms of federal funds received,
Byer said.
He added that Stanford's overall research
activities increase proportionally as federal
support for basic research increases.
To gain federal support for research proj
ects, faculty members submit proposals to
various funding agencies, such as the Na
tional Science Foundation and the National
Institutes of Health, which evaluate pro
posals and distribute money.
The Reagan budget seeks to increase
NSF funds 19 percent in hopes of doubling
the foundation's budget by 1992. The pres
ident's proposal would also award the NIH
a 5.4 percent increase, excluding money
for AIDS research.
Reagan aims to increase spending on
AIDS research alone by 35 percent, to over
$860 million. The greater portion of NIH
and NSF funds are presently spent on AIDS
research.
Byer said the School of Medicine, which
conducts AIDS, biotechnology and bioen
gineering research, is a "big component"
of University research. Medical School re
search funds would increase propor
tionately to the final federal increase of
NSF and NIH funds.
Big increases for student aid
and university research and de
velopment topped President
Reagan's domestic priorities in
his federal budget proposal for
fiscal 1989, which he submitted
to Congress in February.
If approved by Congress, the
increases in education
spending would increase
federal support for student aid
by nine percent to $8.8 billion
and support for basic research
by six percent to $10.3 billion.
After consistently cutting ed
ucation spending during his
two terms as president, Reagan
is recommending record levels
of federal spending on educa
tion in a significant policy shift.
Nevertheless, University of
ficials expressed caution about
the budget's effect on Stanford
finances. University President
Donald Kennedy said, "I am
wary of commenting on admin
istration budgets because they
don't contain any ultimate ob
ligation for expenditures."
Director of Financial Aids
Robert Huff also responded
cautiously. "I'm very enthusi
astic," Huff said, "but I'm not
holding my breath until we see
[Reagan's proposal! translate
into actual dollars for stu
dents."
Huff expressed concern
about budget constraints
passed last fall by Congress to
reduce the federal deficit.
However, according to Mike
Becker, a spokesman for the
Department of Education,
House committees have al
ready approved Reagan's pro
posal for increased education
spending, and Senate commit
tees are now considering the
budget.
"We expect [Reagan's

budget] to be on the floor of
both houses this week," Becker
said Tuesday.
As far as education spending
is concerned, Becker said he
"has no fear" the administra
tion's proposal will be approved
despite budget constraints.
Spending for the Departments
of Defense and Commerce will
be cut to compensate for in
creased education spending, he
said.
Budget allocations for stu
dent aid are "forward-funded,"
so the proposed student aid in
creases would affect the 1989-
90 academic year.
Stanford participates in five
federal student aid programs.
According to Huff, students
receive the largest amount of
money — $10 million per year
— through the Guaranteed
Student Loan program, and an
other $4 million through Na
tional Direct Student Loans,
recently renamed the Perkins
Plan. Reagan's proposal does
not seek major changes in
either programs.
The University also receives
$900,000 through the College
Work-Study program and
$800,000 through Supplemen
tal Educational Opportunity
Grants.
To receive these funds, in
stitutions would be required by
the Reagan administration pro
posal to establish "student
outcome objectives" to measure
how much students had
learned, how many students
had graduated and how many
had obtained jobs with student
aid. Institutions that meet
their "objectives" would receive
more money.
It remains unclear though
how institutions are supposed
to calculate such "objectives."
Huff said, "Stanford wouldn't be at all
disadvantaged by [Reagan's work-study]
plan."
Finally, students receive $900,000 in Pell
Grants, which presently give needy stu
dents a maximum of $2,200 per year. The
Reagan proposal would increase the max
imum to $2,300.
Huff said the University is not in "dire
straits" in providing student aid, but he
added that "the more federal aid available"
gives the University "more flexibility . . .
to use other resources for other purposes."
Congressional approval of Reagan's
budget proposal would increase not only
financial aid but also funding for basic
research. Half of the $10.3 billion allocated
for basic research — a six percent increase
from last year — would go to researchers
at colleges and universities in fiscal year
1989, which begins Oct. 1, 1988.
Basic research, generally conducted at
universities, is aimed strictly at increasing
knowledge about the natural world, as op
posed to industrial research, which involves
a profit motive, according to Robert Byer,
vice provost and dean of research. However,
he added that often the distinction is not
clear cut.
Byer said, "Federal funds are always the

bulk and will remain the bulk" of research
