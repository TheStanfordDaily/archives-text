Big increases for student aid
and university research and de
velopment topped President
Reagan's domestic priorities in
his federal budget proposal for
fiscal 1989, which he submitted
to Congress in February.
If approved by Congress, the
increases in education
spending would increase
federal support for student aid
by nine percent to $8.8 billion
and support for basic research
by six percent to $10.3 billion.
After consistently cutting ed
ucation spending during his
two terms as president, Reagan
is recommending record levels
of federal spending on educa
tion in a significant policy shift.
Nevertheless, University of
ficials expressed caution about
the budget's effect on Stanford
finances. University President
Donald Kennedy said, "I am
wary of commenting on admin
istration budgets because they
don't contain any ultimate ob
ligation for expenditures."
Director of Financial Aids
Robert Huff also responded
cautiously. "I'm very enthusi
astic," Huff said, "but I'm not
holding my breath until we see
[Reagan's proposal! translate
into actual dollars for stu
dents."
Huff expressed concern
about budget constraints
passed last fall by Congress to
reduce the federal deficit.
However, according to Mike
Becker, a spokesman for the
Department of Education,
House committees have al
ready approved Reagan's pro
posal for increased education
spending, and Senate commit
tees are now considering the
budget.
"We expect [Reagan's

budget] to be on the floor of
both houses this week," Becker
said Tuesday.
As far as education spending
is concerned, Becker said he
"has no fear" the administra
tion's proposal will be approved
despite budget constraints.
Spending for the Departments
of Defense and Commerce will
be cut to compensate for in
creased education spending, he
said.
Budget allocations for stu
dent aid are "forward-funded,"
so the proposed student aid in
creases would affect the 1989-
90 academic year.
Stanford participates in five
federal student aid programs.
According to Huff, students
receive the largest amount of
money — $10 million per year
— through the Guaranteed
Student Loan program, and an
other $4 million through Na
tional Direct Student Loans,
recently renamed the Perkins
Plan. Reagan's proposal does
not seek major changes in
either programs.
The University also receives
$900,000 through the College
Work-Study program and
$800,000 through Supplemen
tal Educational Opportunity
Grants.
To receive these funds, in
stitutions would be required by
the Reagan administration pro
posal to establish "student
outcome objectives" to measure
how much students had
learned, how many students
had graduated and how many
had obtained jobs with student
aid. Institutions that meet
their "objectives" would receive
more money.
It remains unclear though
how institutions are supposed
to calculate such "objectives."
