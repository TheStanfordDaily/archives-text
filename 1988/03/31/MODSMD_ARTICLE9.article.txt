An ongoing Coffee House
survey of customer opinion
about indoor smoking at the
campus hangout has yielded a
wide range of comments.
According to Coffee House
manager Jeff Lougee, the sur
vey has so far drawn more than
300 responses and will con
tinue through April.
Mimi Wong Shimuzu, a stu
dent member of the Coffee
House Board, emphasized that
the Coffee House is only
seeking information and is not
yet considering a smoking ban.
She said the survey's sole pur
pose is to gather as many
opinions as possible. "We ha
ven't talked about making a
decision yet," she said. The
Coffee House Board will dis
cuss the survey data at its next
monthly meeting, Lougee said.

Smoke, along with speed of
service and nacho quality, has
been a recurring cause of cus
tomer gripes about the Coffee
House, said Nanci Howe, assis
tant director of Tresidder Un
ion and a member of the board.
Howe said it seemed more
appropriate to address the
smoking issue this year be
cause "the campus as a whole
seems has been more con
cerned about smoking in the
past few years."
The University banned most
indoor smoking in 1985, and
earlier this month it restricted
smoking at outdoor programs
and events on campus.
Along with five questions
about smoking in the Coffee
House, the questionnaire asks
for the respondent's relation
ship to the University and how
often he or she vists the Coffee
House.
