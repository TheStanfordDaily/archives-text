When I picked up today's Daily, I:
□ Swallowed every word of it.
□ Believed the sexual activity story
and brought it up in casual conversation.
□ Was fooled — but only for a second.
□ Doubted that what I was reading was true,
but didn't say anything.
□ Knew it was April Fools' Day
and expected The Daily's fake front page.
If you checked the final box, you are clearly aware of the fact that on April 1 each year
The Daily's front page is fabricated, false, phoney, fudged and untrue.
Happy April Fools' Day.
