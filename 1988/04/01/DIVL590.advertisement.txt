Dear Admissions Staff,
I am but another applicant
trying to get In
I know my chances are slim
For me this Is no whim
My education means a lot
And Stanford Is the best school In the lot
Occidental Is challenging and fun
Yet for me Stanford Is the one.

Hopeful Transfer Applicant
(TO THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES theme):
Come on listen to my story of a rabbit named
Bink, Star of Life In Hell, a strip thst makes you
think. Well one day Bink was feelln' kinda low,
So he came up wth the plan to make some
dough. Merchandising that Is. Fun garb. Comfy
T's. Well the first thlnf you know the shirts
began to sell. Blnk's klnfolk said: "This alnt so
bad for Helll" They said: "Hooray for Callforny
and all its glam and glossl" So Blnky paid his
rent and he stayed right there in Los. Angeles,
thst is. Swimming pools. Obscure cartoonists.
