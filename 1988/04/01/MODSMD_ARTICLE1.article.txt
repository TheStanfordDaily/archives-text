# Hoover deemed unsafe, must be razed

Hoover Tower must be razed by the
end of spring quarter because of struc
tural deficiencies, University officials an
nounced yesterday.
In a rushed relocation, the Hoover In
stitution and its 147 employees will be
moved to the Foothills and housed in a
building constructed according to plans
drawn last year for the now-defunct
Reagan Library.
"Roble Hall, the Lou Henry Hoover
House and the Old Chem. Building have
all been determined this year to be seismi
cally unsound, and Hoover Tower suffers
from similar flaws," officials said.
John Hughes, associate provost for
facilities, said at an emotional press con
ference, "It's been one of those years."
Officials from Stanford's Blume Earth
quake Center initially believed Hoover
was above suspicion because its walls are
steel-reinforced. However, further exam
ination of the tower's as-built plans
revealed that the hollow terracotta tiles
at its base carry "a heavier load than we

ever expected," according to Assoc. Dean
of the School of Engineering James Gere.
"A earthquake would have the
same effect as if someone kicked and
shattered those tiles," which are the same
as those found in the walls of Roble Hall,
Gere said. In neither Roble nor Hoover
are the tiles connected to a supporting
wall, which would keep them from shift
ing, he added.
In fact, the tiles have already "shifted
to an alarming degree," Hughes said, add
ing that he could "not overemphasize the
gravity of this situation." In-depth inves
tigations show that the tower "is already
leaning far too far to the right, probably
as a result of past tremors," he said.
"Because of Hoover's considerable
height, we feel we have no choice but to
raze it before a tragedy occurs," said
Hughes. Calling the situation "urgent,"
Hughes added that all of Hoover's em
ployees would be permanently evacuated
by Monday.
Construction on Hoover Tower was
begun in the late 19305. The building
was completed and dedicated in 1941 and
since that time has housed the Hoover

Institution on War, Revolution and
Peace.
Stanford's Blume Earthquake Center
has been conducting a University-wide
seismic study since September 1986 in
coryunction with University Project Man
agement.
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell
said yesterday he "doubts the accuracy
of the study and the wisdom of making
any rush decisions. In fact, they'll do
this over my dead body!"
Because of the pressing nature of the
situation, Hughes said the University
plans to create a new Hoover Institution
in the Foothills, according to already
completed nlans for what was to be the

Reagan Library last year. "We hope to
retain the cupola and bells from the tower
in order to create a new roof on what
would have been the Reagan Library, but
other than that it should look just as
the library would have."
Last year, officials from the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation sought
to build a library housing his presidential
archives in the Foothills but the plans
were abandoned largely due to protest
from the community.
Hughes said he did not know where
the archives will be stored in the interim
before the new Hoover Institution is
built.

After the conference, Campbell told
reporters he suspected that Stanford
Profs. John Manley and Ronald Rebholtz,
long-time critics of Stanford's close ties
to Hoover, had pressed for investigations
into the tower's structual makeup and
"contributed to this hysteria to knock
(the tower) down before we can see how
to reinforce it."
Manley denied the accusations, saying,
"I might have taken that channel if I
thought it would have been effective, but
I'm as surprised and pleased as the next
person."
"We all know (the Institution's) politics
have been unsound for years. It's very
gratifying to finally have this tumor
removed from the face of the University,"
Rebholtz said.
However, numerous community mem
bers have already staged a protest today
at noon in front of the president's office,
in an effort to halt construction in the
Foothills. "We just got rid of the Reagan
Library and now we have this to contend
with," said Dan De Luce, one of the
protest's organizers.
