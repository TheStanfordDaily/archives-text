# A
						new era: CIV sweeps in Fac Sen
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
approved an amended form of the
Area One Task Force's Culture,
Ideas and Values proposal, ending
months of heated debate that
have drawn national attention.
The year-long Area One re
quirement will be officially titled
CIV, not Western Culture, radi
cally altering the nature of a
course that was first taught in
1980 and for eight years drama
tically affected undergraduate ed
ucation at Stanford.
CIV mandates that works by
"women, minorities and persons
of color" will have an established
niche in the Area One curriculum.
A course often criticized as out
dated and Eurocentric will now
allow for a diverse, multicultural
interpretation of what it means
to live in modern American soci
ety.
The adopted legislation, ap
proved by a vote of 39-4 with 5
abstentions, resolves the long
standing dispute over the Western
Culture core list of texts by re
quiring that Area One instructors
meet annually to establish ele
ments — texts, authors, themes
or issues — that will be common
to all tracks.
In effect, the senate dropped
the core reading list and replaced
it with a flexible system that will
provide a yearly core list of ideas
and themes.

The senate, which traditionally
adjourns at 5:30 p.m., voted to
pass the compromise only
minutes before the deadline.
Senators were greeted by cheers
and applause from students as
they left the senate meeting room
at the Law School. Student sup
porters of the change in the Area
One requirement held a rally
before the 3:15 p.m. senate
meeting and waited expectantly
for the meeting's outcome.
The adopted legislation was
built in stages. The Area One
Task Force initiated the bill last
October; adjustments were made
by the Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies from November
through this week; and recent
suggestions by faculty members,
especially those who teach Area
One classes, helped develop its ul
timate form.
The final plank was a last
minute amendment added yester
day by the senate that reiterated
the need for students' common
intellectual experience.
In fact, "common intellectual
experience" was a primary theme
underlying the entire bill.
One of the explicit objectives of
the final proposal is "to provide
students with the common intel
lectual experience of broadening
their understanding of ideas and
values drawn from different
strands of our own culture."
The legislation calls for six to
10 certified Area One tracks, but
it also leaves room for experimen

tal tracks. There are currently
seven established year-long tracks
and one experimental track, Con
flict and Change.
Two recent amendments,
drawn up at a meeting of Area
One faculty members earlier this
month, were also included in the
final legislation: one proposed by
Assoc. History Prof. Clayborne
Carson and English Prof. William
Chace; and another proposed by
Carson and History Prof. Paul
Seaver.
The Carson-Chace amendment
charges Area One tracks "to give
substantial attention to the issues
of race, gender and class during
each academic quarter, with at
least one of these issues to be
addressed explicitly in at least one
major reading in each quarter."
The Carson-Seaver amendment
calls for an "annual process by
which the regular faculty and
course coordinators who will be
teaching in the various tracks will
meet to discuss their syllabi for
the following year and to agree
on those common elements —
texts, authors, themes or issues
— that will be taught by all the
tracks."
The two amendments turned
out to be the key to the compro
mise that enabled the legislation,
stalled for months in the senate,
to pass the faculty without sig
nificant opposition.
The adopted legislation also
