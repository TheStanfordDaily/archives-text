# Bilingualism stressed in English-only debate
## 
### Suzanne Downing 
All immigrants should learn
English â€” that much two out
spoken Latino leaders agree on.
But the two disagree on whether
English should be the official lan
guage of the United States.
At issue is a proposed constitu
tional amendment that would
legislate English as the national
language, a topic debated last
night at Kresge Auditorium by
Linda Chavez, head of the non
profit organization U.S. English,
and Arnold Torres, former na
tional director of the League of
United Latin American Citizens,
a Latino civil rights and service
group.
The debate, sponsored by the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau, Innova
tive Academic Courses and the
Stanford Latino Student Alliance,
also focused on the roles and re
sponsibilities of minority leaders
in the United States.
Chavez, a former staff director
of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights under President Reagan,
argued that bilingual education in
America has been a failure, and
blamed the federal government
for that failure.
"What happened in the '80s was
a shift toward maintaining the
child's native language," Chavez
said. "I don't think it ought to
be the federal government's role
to help maintain native language

and culture."
Torres, however, claimed that
bilingual education has been un
derfunded, and said that the gov
ernment has yet to make a clear
commitment to helping Latinos
and other immigrant groups as
similate into society. Although he
agreed that the federal govern
ment was to blame for the failure
of bilingual education, Torres had
harsh words for Latino commu
nities.
"We need to be much more con
structive and educate people to
the realities of our people," Torres
said, charging that subordination
of those with a non-European her
itage was a hidden agenda of the
U.S. English-only movement.
"We all expect the new kid on
the block to pay his dues," he
said. "Language has become a po
litical, social and economic
weapon."
Instead of creating an official
language, Torres challenged
Chavez' group drop the official
English campaign and take up the
cause of bringing literacy to all
Americans, rather than sowing
seeds of divisiveness in the mi
nority communities.
Chavez, however, claimed that
one-fifth of her organization's
budget is directed toward literacy
projects, and denied that any
racist motives were behind the
group's efforts.
