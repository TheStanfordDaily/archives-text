# Area 1 ready for next step

### Erin Martin Editorial staff 
After two years of escalated
controversy, debate and protest,
the various factions of the Area
One debate have been united by
an equitable compromise that
has left them ready to tackle
the transition from legislation
to actual changes in the course
curriculum.

News analysis

The Faculty Senate's adop
tion of the Cultures, Ideas and
Values compromise accom
modates views that were
sharply polarized at early stages
of the debate. At different points
during the last two years it ap
peared a resolution would not
come without bitter trade-offs
and disillusionment for all par
ties.
However, though the contro
versy has been long and ex
hausting, its resolution has left
virtually all sides feeling that
the issue is at a point that will
permit fluid dialogue and sin
cere commitment to change.
Black Student Union Chair

Bill King called the compromise
a "good tool to move forward."
Both students and professors
made it clear that although the
legislation represents a major
change, the issue will not be not
closed until the year-long course
begins in 1989 under the guid
ance of the new compromise.
The ratification of the amend
ment puts the burden of enforc
ing the changes on the Area One
Committee, a faculty-student
board appointed to oversee the
program. Students are now call
ing for a very strong role in
ensuring that the compromise s
objective of shared diversity is
actually instituted in the course.
Senior Kathy Coll, a member
of Students United for a Dem
ocratic Education and supporter
of the CIV proposal, called for
students to play a strong role
in implementing the compro
mise. "Students should be
watchdogs of the faculty,"she
said.
Out of a maximum of 13 seats
on the committee, students will
occupy three posts, not enough
to wield authority, but enough
to influence the ongoing
dialogue.

King said after yesterday's 39-
4-5 vote that though he feared
"the program hasn't changed
one iota, the philosophical
change is complete and
profound."
This philosophical change,
which moves the course concen
tration away from European
culture to a reflection of Amer
ican culture in the light of the
influence of minorities and
women, is the landmark change
that has been awaited across the
country by such critics as Sec
retary of Education William
Bennett.
Senate member Beverly Allen,
associate professor of French
and Italian, said that "Stanford
is a vanguard" in the resolution
of the nationwide Western cul
ture debate.
Clapping and cheers from
both senate members and stu
dents yesterday after the vote
are proof of the confidence res
tored on both sides of the debate
by the compromise.
"If the meeting had fallen
apart, minorities, women and
people of color would have felt
the University is useless," King
said.
"What was at stake was the
conscience of the University."
English Prof. William Chace, in
his remarks to the senate, en
dorsed the CIV compromise
before the vote and joked that he
was certain it was sound because
all involved parties "left the bar
gaining table feeling equally bad."
Chace, who gave up his ad
vocacy of a core reading list for
the sake of reconciliation, ac
knowledged both the degree of
mutual sacrifice necessitated by
the compromise and the merits
of the adopted legislation.
The central impasse through
out the debate has been the reten
tion or abandonment of a core list.
The core list dilemma came to
the forefront of the debate when
the list was abandoned in the
original CIV proposal.

This primary source of tension
was alleviated by last week's crea
tion of an amendment calling for
core "elements" instead of a core
list of books. The idea, devised by
Chace and Assoc. History Prof.
Clayborne Carson, allows for a
variety of texts, authors, themes
or issues to provide for the com
mon intellectual experience in the
program.
Those core elements are to be
determined annually by the Area
One Committee. The "element"
stipulation affords room for a core
list within its boundaries, but it
also frees the program from the
requisite canon of literature that
many anti-core constituents per
ceived as limiting.
The compromise is based on
this type of duality. In addressing
the geographical content of the
course, the compromise mandates
studying works from "at least one
of the European clusters of cul
tures and from at least one of the
non-European cultures" that have
become components of American
culture.
