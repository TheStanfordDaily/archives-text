# Students rally for CIV passage
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Cheering "vote now, we want change," over 200
students rallied outside the law school before yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting and maintained an
attentive vigil throughout the proceedings, with
plans to disrupt the meeting in case the Area One
requirement vote was blocked or the proposal
changed.
Yet, immediately after the Faculty Senate ap
proved the amended Cultures, Ideas and Values
proposal, hundreds of cheering and applauding stu
dents swarmed the faculty as they left the meeting.
Many students heralded the vote as a landmark
change that validated the University's committment
to its minority groups. Others emphasized that the
true test of the decision would be in years to come
when individuals in the Area One faculty must
prove their committment to diversity.
Before the meeting convened however, the mood
was tense. Four speakers urgently called for con
tinued student activism and emphasized the impor
tance of the imminent decision concerning western
culture.
"We need to empower ourselves. This University
is too rigid and too set in its ways, and we students
need to change it," said Chair of the Black Student
Union Bill King.
In case the senate stalled or threatened not to
pass the proposal, King introduced a "contigency
plan" in which the few students inside the meeting
would alert students outside to the changes. At five
states that Area One instructors
will be recruited from current
Stanford faculty and that new in
structors will not be recruited ex
clusively to teach Area One
tracks.
Proposed revisions to the CIV
proposal that were made earlier
this month by Senate Chair
Gerald Lieberman, professor of
statistics and operations research,
and other members of the senate
Steering Committee were rejected
by the CUS, which was ultimately
responsible for determining the
form of the legislation that
reached the senate floor.
The Steering Committee had
sought to introduce language that
would make the proposal more
palatable to supporters of the
now-defunct Western Culture
program. The changes included
use of the word "Western," which
does not exist in the CIV compro
mise. However, Carson and other
architects of the final legislation
were violently opposed to the com
mittee's action and won a back
room struggle this week to defeat
the new language.
The meeting's drama began
with a statement from Lieber

man: "Well, here we are. This is
it: the Area One requirement."
After short speeches from Area
One Task Force Chair Seaver,
Black Student Union Chair Bill
King, CUS member Rudy
Fuentes, Chace and Heller — ac
tors who have been pitted against
one another at various times dur
ing the Area One debate — the
discussion continued. All five
speakers urged support of the
compromise.
In January, Chace and Heller
were the sponsors of legislation
that offered different alternative
solutions to the Area One dilem
ma. Their disagreement centered
on the question of the core list.
Chace supported it in modified
form; Heller opposed it altogether.
The two put aside their differ
ences yesterday to support the
compromise, giving the proposal
a momentum that enabled it to
steamroll through the senate.
But the momentum behind the
amended CIV proposal stalled
temporarily when Gary Feldman,
a professor at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, and Educa
tion Prof. Denis Phillips brought
to the senate's attention a version
of the proposal that included the
Steering Committee's revisions.
After some discussion, the sen
ate decided that it would be easier
to focus discussion on one piece

of legislation — the amended CIV
proposal — and abandon the
Steering Committee's recommen
dations.
Other tentative proposals to
focus Area One more on European
culture also failed.
History Prof. Carl Degler pro
posed an amendment to the leg
islation intended to ensure that
the tracks cover several European
cultural traditions instead of just
one. Degler's proposed amend
ment, which would have made
CIV slightly more Eurocentric,
was narrowly voted down by the
senate, 26-22.
At the beginning of the
meeting, when he introduced the
amended CIV proposal, Heller
said the proposal "represents a
delicate compromise."
"In the nature of compromise,
all parties have given up some
thing to achieve consensus," Hel
ler said. "To consider further uni
lateral requests after reaching
that implicit compromise would
greatly endanger it and result in
loss, not only of consensus, but
of good will as well."
In an interview after the
meeting, Heller called the individ
ual senators' last-minute at
tempts to change the bill
"cavalier." He said the CUS was
the body that should be making
those changes.

However, one amendment was
adopted by the senate at the last
minute.
English Prof. Robert Polhemus
proposed an amendment to stress
the "shared intellectual content"
of the Area One requirement.
The senate voted 27-16 to pass
the Polhemus amendment.
At this crucial stage of the
debate, University President
Donald Kennedy — a compromise
advocate throughout the Area
One dialogue — stepped in,
voicing his support for the pro
posal and stressing the impor
tance of making a decision soon.
Kennedy accused the senate of
letting the prospect of a "best"
proposal undermine its chances
of adopting a "very good" one.
In a final effort to modify the
proposal, Feldman asked the sen
ate to eliminate a clause requiring
that the Area One tracks "include
the study of works by women,
minorities and persons of color."
Feldman could not obtain a
second for his proposed deletion,
which shocked the rest of the sen
ate because the language Feldman
attacked represented the heart of
CIV.
Instead, the senate voted 33-10
to close discussion on the Area
One requirement and, soon after,
overwhelmingly ratified the
amended CIV proposal.

In January, Chace and Heller
were the sponsors of legislation
that offered different alternative
solutions to the Area One dilem
ma. Their disagreement centered
on the question of the core list.
Chace supported it in modified
form; Heller opposed it altogether.
The two put aside their differ
ences yesterday to support the
compromise, giving the proposal
a momentum that enabled it to
steamroll through the senate.
But the momentum behind the
amended CIV proposal stalled
temporarily when Gary Feldman,
a professor at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, and Educa
tion Prof. Denis Phillips brought
to the senate's attention a version
of the proposal that included the
Steering Committee's revisions.
After some discussion, the sen
ate decided that it would be easier
to focus discussion on one piece

of legislation — the amended CIV
proposal — and abandon the
Steering Committee's recommen
dations.
Other tentative proposals to
focus Area One more on European
culture also failed.
History Prof. Carl Degler pro
posed an amendment to the leg
islation intended to ensure that
the tracks cover several European
cultural traditions instead of just
one. Degler's proposed amend
ment, which would have made
CIV slightly more Eurocentric,
was narrowly voted down by the
senate, 26-22.
At the beginning of the
meeting, when he introduced the
amended CIV proposal, Heller
said the proposal "represents a
delicate compromise."
"In the nature of compromise,
all parties have given up some
thing to achieve consensus," Hel
ler said. "To consider further uni
lateral requests after reaching
that implicit compromise would
greatly endanger it and result in
loss, not only of consensus, but
of good will as well."
In an interview after the
meeting, Heller called the individ
ual senators' last-minute at
tempts to change the bill
"cavalier." He said the CUS was
the body that should be making
those changes.

However, one amendment was
adopted by the senate at the last
minute.
English Prof. Robert Polhemus
proposed an amendment to stress
the "shared intellectual content"
of the Area One requirement.
The senate voted 27-16 to pass
the Polhemus amendment.
At this crucial stage of the
debate, University President
Donald Kennedy — a compromise
advocate throughout the Area
One dialogue — stepped in,
voicing his support for the pro
posal and stressing the impor
tance of making a decision soon.
Kennedy accused the senate of
letting the prospect of a "best"
proposal undermine its chances
of adopting a "very good" one.
In a final effort to modify the
proposal, Feldman asked the sen
ate to eliminate a clause requiring
that the Area One tracks "include
the study of works by women,
minorities and persons of color."
Feldman could not obtain a
second for his proposed deletion,
which shocked the rest of the sen
ate because the language Feldman
attacked represented the heart of
CIV.
Instead, the senate voted 33-10
to close discussion on the Area
One requirement and, soon after,
overwhelmingly ratified the
amended CIV proposal.

Cheering "vote now, we want change," over 200
students rallied outside the law school before yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting and maintained an
attentive vigil throughout the proceedings, with
plans to disrupt the meeting in case the Area One
requirement vote was blocked or the proposal
changed.
Yet, immediately after the Faculty Senate ap
proved the amended Cultures, Ideas and Values
proposal, hundreds of cheering and applauding stu
dents swarmed the faculty as they left the meeting.
Many students heralded the vote as a landmark
change that validated the University's committment
to its minority groups. Others emphasized that the
true test of the decision would be in years to come
when individuals in the Area One faculty must
prove their committment to diversity.
Before the meeting convened however, the mood
was tense. Four speakers urgently called for con
tinued student activism and emphasized the impor
tance of the imminent decision concerning western
culture.
"We need to empower ourselves. This University
is too rigid and too set in its ways, and we students
need to change it," said Chair of the Black Student
Union Bill King.
In case the senate stalled or threatened not to
pass the proposal, King introduced a "contigency
plan" in which the few students inside the meeting
would alert students outside to the changes. At five
states that Area One instructors
will be recruited from current
Stanford faculty and that new in
structors will not be recruited ex
clusively to teach Area One
tracks.
Proposed revisions to the CIV
proposal that were made earlier
this month by Senate Chair
Gerald Lieberman, professor of
statistics and operations research,
and other members of the senate
Steering Committee were rejected
by the CUS, which was ultimately
responsible for determining the
form of the legislation that
reached the senate floor.
The Steering Committee had
sought to introduce language that
would make the proposal more
palatable to supporters of the
now-defunct Western Culture
program. The changes included
use of the word "Western," which
does not exist in the CIV compro
mise. However, Carson and other
architects of the final legislation
were violently opposed to the com
mittee's action and won a back
room struggle this week to defeat
the new language.
The meeting's drama began
with a statement from Lieber

man: "Well, here we are. This is
it: the Area One requirement."
After short speeches from Area
One Task Force Chair Seaver,
Black Student Union Chair Bill
King, CUS member Rudy
Fuentes, Chace and Heller — ac
tors who have been pitted against
one another at various times dur
ing the Area One debate — the
discussion continued. All five
speakers urged support of the
compromise.

solutions to the Area One dilem
ma. Their disagreement centered
