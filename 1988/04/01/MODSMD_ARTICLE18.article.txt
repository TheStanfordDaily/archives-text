# Stakes set for spring election
## Students to elect new officers; ASSU to study voting machine use 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
The upcoming ASSU Spring
Election will for the first time
test the mettle of voting machines
and Stanford's first political party
in recent years. Although neither
the machines nor the People's
Platform are new to the ASSU
election scene, both may drama
tically alter the nature of student
elections here.
In the past, the ASSU has tried
various processes to count votes
in elections, but they have often
led to controversy.

For example, last spring's elec
tions were marred by delays in
election results, by a recount of
original ballots and by procedural
changes in voting for the Council
of Presidents. The mishaps even
tually forced a second election and
delayed the final election results
by nearly three weeks.
In a minor election this fall,
the ASSU introduced voting mac
hines to try to to speed up the
tabulation process. However, the
innovation caused controversy be
cause it cost close to $5,300 in
rental fees.
For the April 13-14 spring elec

tion, however, the machines will
be instituted, according to Pol
lmaster Steve Krauss.
Krauss, a freshman, said he did
not expect any procedural prob
lems this spring because only two
COP slates will appear on the bal
lot, compared to four last year.
Any delays should be taken care
of by the voting machines' time
efficiency, he added.
Krauss projected that election
results will be available late Fri
day afternoon, only one day after
polls close.
