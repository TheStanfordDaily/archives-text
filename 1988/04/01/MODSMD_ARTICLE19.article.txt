Support for expanding student
office and activity space is mobiliz
ing.
Student group leaders met yes
terday at Tresidder to plan strat
egies to resolve the office space
crunch and to discuss solutions
proposed in a Committee on Stu
dent Organization Spaces prelim
inary draft report.
No consensus on the next action
was established at the meeting,
but student leaders said it was
positive because it gave them an
opportunity to vent their frustra
tions.

Junior Leonard Adler, a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents,
said in an open letter to 40 stu
dent leaders from various groups
at the meeting: "Enough. The of
fice and activity space situation
for student groups sucks."
Lack of office space has long
been a problem for student
groups. Of the over 300 student
organizations in existence now,
only 70 have space on campus,
and some of this space is shared.
Several groups with space com
plained of their cramped and
noisy environments. Many organ
izations residing in the Clubhouse
say they have to hold meetings
to loud backround music of Scot

tish dance and aerobics classes.
Meanwhile, the Stanford Macin
tosh User Group shares a 20-
person-capacity trailer with the
Debate Team, making meetings
virtually impossible, representa
tives said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons set up the committee last
spring, which included Adler
among its members, to tour exist
ing facilities over the summer and
submit a report.
On Dec. 1, Lyons received a
draft from Michael Ramsey-Perez,
coordinator of Student Organiza
tional Services and chair of the
committee, but sent it back be
cause he said it failed to deal with
long-term solutions.
Ramsey-Perez is currently
working on a new draft and held
the meeting in order to obtain
the input of student group leaders
who were not available over the
summer when the first report was
drafted. Those at the meeting dis
cussed possibilites for both short
term and long-term solutions.
Adler said he looks forward to
having some new student office
space in the near future. The
metal shop and heat ther
modynamics building are expected
to move to a new Near West
campus building development in
1991, freeing up space that could
possibily be utilized by student
groups.
Those at the meeting also dis
cussed the long-term possibility
that a building specifically for stu
dent organizations could be built
in Manzanita Park.
