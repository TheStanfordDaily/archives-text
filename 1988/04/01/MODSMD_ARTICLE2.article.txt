# Area One debate deadlocked
## Filibuster blocks final vote 
### Nick Anderson Editorial staff 
A shouting match erupted on
the floor of the normally sedate
Faculty Senate yesterday be
tween opponents and support
ers of this week's historic core
list compromise when an 11th
hour filibuster by English Prof.
William Chace thwarted the
long-awaited senate vote to
ratify the new Culture, Ideas
and Values course.
The parliamentary maneu
vering forced Senate Chair
Gerald Lieberman, professor of
statistics and operations re
search, to take the unprece
dented step of adjourning the
meeting after an unproductive
three hours.
The senate will reconvene in
a special meeting next week
and try once again to resolve
the ongoing Western Culture
debate.
Long an advocate of only
slightly modifying the tradi
tional view of Western Culture,
Chace invoked a rarely-used
passage of the senate bylaws
that allowed him to table the
CIV proposal indefinitely as he
read verbatim from several
classic texts, including the so
called "big six" of Plato, the
Hebrew and Christian Bibles,
St. Augustine, Machiavelli,
Rousseau and Marx.
The six authors are the foun
dation of a "revolving core list,"
as many have labeled it, that
was fashioned last week by His-

Tory Profs. Clayborne Carson,
Paul Seaver and Paul Robinson
in an attempt to design a pro
gram that would sail through
the senate this week without
rancor.
Later in the afternoon,
Chace tired of reading those
works and began reciting
names and numbers from tele
phone books.
The rule Chace cited, para
graph three of Section 21(c) of
the senate bylaws, is modeled
after debate procedures used
by the U.S. Senate.
"In order to ensure a plural
ity of opinions during debate,"
the section states, "no senator
shall be denied the opportunity
to present his or her argument,
in any time period necessitated
by the exigencies of the matter,
as the senator may deem fitting
and appropriate."
Biological Sciences Prof.
Craig Heller, chair of the Com
mittee on Undergraduate
Studies and carrier of the CIV
flag, exploded when he discov
ered Chace's ruse, which began
after the first 10 minutes of
the senate were occupied by
routine business.
"This is preposterous," Hel
ler shouted r.t Chace and
Lieberman. "After a year of
debate, I'm sick and tired of
seeing these people kill our in
itiative by talking it to death.
It's time to act."
