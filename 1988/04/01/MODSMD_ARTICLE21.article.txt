Iraq temporarily halts attacks
NICOSIA, Cyprus — Iraq fired three mis
siles into Iranian cities yesterday, then said
it would stop for three days. No further attacks
by either side were reported in the month-old
round of the "war of the cities."
Acording to the Iraqi News Agency, the
cease-fire began last night at midnight (7 p.m.
PST) and will last through the three days of
a visit to Baghdad by Turgut Ozal, prime
minister of Turkey.
As the announced time passed, neither side
had reported any attacks on each other's cities
for hours.
A Cypriot supertanker set afire by an Iranian
warship earlier yesterday meanwhile ran
aground in the Persian Gulf.
In Ankara, the Turkish capital, Iranian Em
bassy spokesman Riza Bagri said Iran's missile
launchings would "automatically come to an
end" if Iraq stopped attacking Iranian cities
with rockets and bombs.
Tehran radio did not confirm Bagri's state
ment, but said Iraq was the "instigator" of
attacks on cities and Iran took "retaliatory
measures."
An Iranian warship pounded the 232,164-
ton supertanker Haven, loaded with 1.5 million
barrels of Saudi Arabian crude, for 90 minutes
at dawn yesterday. The 45-member crew was
rescued from the burning ship, which ran
aground later off the United Arab Emirates.
Shipping executives believed the attack was
a response to several Iraqi attacks in recent
days on tankers owned or chartered by Iran.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolu
tionary patriarch, exhorted his people to new
effort in the long conflict, declaring: "Today
is the day of war. Today we must rush to the
war front in order to inflict punishing blows
on the enemy, and with the help of God we
will succeed."
"The enemy has proved his brutal actions
by firing chemical weapons on residential
areas," he said in remarks reported by Tehran
radio.
A dispatch from Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency said a team of Swiss
physicians arrived to visit victims of alleged
Iraqi chemical weapons attacks on border
towns.
U.S.-Italian drug ring busted
WASHINGTON - U.S. and Italian author
ities, breaking up a huge drug ring that
brought heroin into this country in exchange
for cocaine, have charged 233 suspects in the
United States and Sicily in what Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 described yesterday
as "the largest international drug case ever
developed by the federal government."
Meese, announcing the action at a press
conference punctuated by repeated questions
about his own legal troubles, said the U.S.-
Italian ring was importing heroin from Europe
and distributing it throughout the United
States. Agents were surprised to learn of the
unusual barter system in which the Italians
delivered heroin to America and got cocaine
in return.
"FBI agents were able to work their way
to the heart of the accused Sicilian Mafia
organization," Meese said. Federal agents were
able to break up the ring because of extraordi
nary cooperation between American and Ital
ian officials, he said.
The attorney general said 69 suspects
nationwide and 164 in Italy were charged with
drug trafficking and conspiracy in the opera
tion. More than 100 arrests have been made,
officials said, and more suspects are being
sought in New York, Washington, Boston,
Cleveland, Charlotte, N.C., and San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
Scandal challenges Korean pres.
SEOUL, South Korea — Following the ar
rest on corruption charges of former President
Chun Doo Hwan's younger brother, newly in
augurated President Roh Tae Woo now faces
the task of trying to contain a scandal that
he tacitly encouraged to develop, according to
Western diplomats and South Korean analysts.
Roh's handling of the corruption scandal
amounts to his first mjyor political test since
taking office more than a month ago.
Diplomats and analysts say the unfolding sit
uation presents both perils and benefits for
South Korea's new leader: it offers Roh a
quick chance to distance himself from the
unpopular Chun and turn away from aut
horitarianism, but it also threatens to engulf
his government in growing corruption charges.
"The prosecution authorities have done
some face-lifting in efforts to uphold social
justice," said The Korea Times in an editorial
on the arrest yesterday of Chun Kyung Hwan,
the former president's brother. "The question,
however, is the popular belief that the pros
ecution has unveiled nothing more than the
tip of an iceberg."
The scandal, in which Chun Kyung Hwan
and eight other top officials of a semi-official
rural-development agency have been arrested
on embezzlement and influence-peddling
charges, appears aimed at discrediting the
former president so that he cannot play a
behind-tne-scenes role in Roh's administra
tion, many experts say. Although it is not yet
certain that the press leaks fueling the scandal
came from the presidential palace, the experts
point out that no barriers were placed in the
way of the disclosures.
So far, a key political impact of the scandal
is that Roh will apparently have a freer hand
in running the government without inter
ference from his political mentor Chun. "This
has established Roh's position," said a West
European diplomat.
