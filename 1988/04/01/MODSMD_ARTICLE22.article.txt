# Dispute threatens Afghan peace plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The United
States and the Soviet Union have
reached tentative agreement on a plan
to remove all Soviet troops from Af
ghanistan by the end of the year, but
the accord already threatens to foun
der because of a dispute over arms
shipments to opposing sides in the
Afghan conflict, Reagan administra
tion officials said yesterday.
The agreement calls for the Soviets
to withdraw half their 115,000-man
army from Afghanistan by Aug. 15
and for the remaining troops to leave
by Dec. 31, said the officials, who asked
not to be identified. In return, U.S.-
backed resistance forces would agree
not to harass the retreating Soviet
army.
The pact also contains a controver
sial clause requiring the United States
to end weapons shipments to the guer
rillas once the Soviet troops begin to
depart, even though Moscow would be
under no similar obligation to stop
supplying weapons to the pro-Soviet
government in Afghanistan's capital,
Kabul.
Negotiations are complicated by the
fact that the peace accord is not for

mally a pact between the two super
powers but a treaty between Afghan
istan and Pakistan in which the U.S.
and the Soviets act as guarantors.
In deciding earlier this week to sup
port the tentative agreement, U.S. of
ficials served notice to the Soviets that
they intended to violate the prohibi
tion on weapons shipments to the
guerrillas until Moscow stops military
aid to the Kabul government.
In turn, the Soviets said that they
would criticize U.S. arms shipments
to the resistance after the agreement
is signed, but would not seek to stop
them.
However, even before the agreement
was completed, that promise appeared
to soften. Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze late yesterday
attacked the United States in a Mos
cow interview for planning to violate
the agreement on ending arms ship
ments.
"It was nailed down this morning,"
one U.S. official said of the agreement,
"and it came loose this afternoon."
Before yesterday's snags developed,
American and Soviet officials had
hoped to hold a formal signing cere

mony for the agreement as early as
today. A State Department spokesman
said yesterday afternoon that an actual
signing of an accord appeared "quite
a ways off."
It was not clear whether those snags
posed a serious hurdle to an agreement
but White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said yesterday that the Af
ghanistan talks were "in their final
stages." The Soviet Union also ap
peared to remain intent on achieving
a peace pact, U.S. officials said.
In statements yesterday, the White
House and the State Department said
that the United States was following
a policy of "symmetry and balance"
in the Afghan negotiations. The
Americans, they said, "will continue
our support as long as the Soviet Un
ion continues their support" for forces
in the civil war.
Fitzwater said that there had been
no formal agreement because the
Soviets "have not accepted that
proposition."
He did not address the earlier U.S.
promise to end aid to the rebels once
Soviet troops began their pullout.
Other U.S. sources said, however, that

the Soviets rejected U.S. attempts to
alter that provision or to reach a sep
arate agreement that would resolve
the dispute over military aid.
The current difficulties do not hinge
on the substance of an Afghan peace
treaty, but on the niceties of diplomacy
and international law. In essence, both
sides are angling for graceful ways to
back out of commitments â€” a Soviet
promise to prop up the Kabul regime,
and an American promise to end arms
shipments to the rebels.
Under the proposed agreement, once
Soviet troops begin leaving Afghani
stan, Pakistan must seal its border to
block future arms shipments to the
U.S.-backed resistance. Several dozen
international monitors would be sta
tioned on the Pakistan-Afghanistan
frontier to check compliance with the
provision.
Under the draft accord proposed this
week, both the United States and
Pakistan would be in technical viola
tion of that provision if they organized
further arms shipments to the resis
tance once Soviet troops begin their
withdrawal.
