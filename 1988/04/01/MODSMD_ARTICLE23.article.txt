# Israel rescinds closure
## 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” Israeli author
ities lifted an unprecedented
three-day closure order covering
the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip on schedule early today,
even as the appearance of a new
underground leaflet signaled that
the army's crackdown has not yet
silenced leaders of the continuing
Palestinian unrest.
The decision to end the ex
traordinary restrictions, imposed
to forestall violent demonstra
tions planned for last Wednesday,
was made at a meeting yesterday
of senior security officials, includ
ing Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and army and military in
telligence personnel.
It means that most of the 1.4
million Palestinian residents of
the occupied territories again will
be able to travel freely in the West
Bank and Gaza and into Israel
proper. Exceptions include resi
dents of several refugee camps
and villages still under curfew
related to recent disturbances.
In addition, the more than
600,000 residents of Gaza will
remain under a five-hour nightly
curfew similar to the one first
imposed in mid-March. The cur
few, which restricts inhabitants
to their homes, was extended
Monday to a full 24 hours daily
through 3 a.m. today.
After being barred since Mon
day night, travel also was restored
from the territories across the
bridges linking the West Bank to
Jordan. Restrictions barring the
media from the territories with
out special permission and a mil
itary escort were lifted, the army
said.
Despite the unprecedented

crackdown, four Palestinians
were killed by army gunfire Wed
nesday and more than 50 were
wounded in one of the most vio
lent days since the uprising began
Dec. 9. There were clashes in
more than 20 locations on the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, the
army said.
Still, a senior defense official
said the situation would have
been much worse had the army
not acted. "I think if we hadn't
taken all those precautions we
could have gone through almost
hell," he said in an interview
Thursday.
Underground Palestinian
leaders had called for "huge dem
onstrations" Wednesday to mark
Land Day, a commemoration for
six Arabs slain by Israeli troops
in 1976 during protests against
government confiscations of Arab
lands in northern Israel. The day
has in recent years become almost
a national Palestinian holiday,
marked both by those Arabs who
live as Israeli citizens inside the
"Green Line" defining the coun
try's pre-1967 borders and by Pal
estinians from the territories.
The latest underground bulle
tin, meanwhile, was the 12th in
a series dating back to early Jan
uary and signed by the self-styled
Unified National Leadership for
the Uprising in the Occupied Ter
ritories.
It praised the protesters "who
are writing in blood and fire the
history of the Arab nation" and
called for a series of new protests
during next week's scheduled
peace shuttle in the region by U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz.
