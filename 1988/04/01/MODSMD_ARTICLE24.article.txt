# Meese support in Congress waning, Thurmond warns
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Sen. Strom Thur
mond, R-S.C., the ranking Republican
on the Senate Judiciary Committee,
warned Attorney General Edwin Meese
111 yesterday that he faces a serious
political problem from Congress that will
not blow over, as Democrats sought to
call the two top Justice Department of
ficials who abruptly resigned this week
to testify before the committee.
A source who spoke with Thurmond
after the meeting said the senator did
not suggest that Meese step down but
"made it clear that he had huge prob
lems." Meese's response was that "he
intends to fight this to the end and has
no intention, none, of quitting," the
source said.
In a statement after the meeting,
which was notable for its absence of
encouragement to Meese to remain in
office, Thurmond said: "A number of
people on Capitol Hill have expressed
deep concerns about the problems at
the Justice Department. I went today
to talk to the attorney general to convey
these concerns to him.
Thurmond has been an ardent advo
cate of the administration within the
Judiciary Committee, but, according to
committee sources, privately he has been
furious with Meese since what the
senator views as the botched Supreme
Court nomination of Judge Douglas
Ginsburg. Ginsburg withdrew his name
from consideration after admitting that
he had smoked marijuana.
Meese, who because of the meeting
was late to a news conference about a
major drug bust, was asked if he planned
to meet with Thurmond. "I don't have

any meeting later today with Sen. Thur
mond," he replied. "I've talked with a
number of people today, some of them
about drug strategy and others about
other topics."
After Thurmond's office issued a
statement about the meeting and
reporters complained that Meese's an
swer was misleading, Justice Depart
ment spokesman Terry Eastland issued
a "clarification" explaining that Meese
"did meet with (Thurmond) prior to the
press conference about matters unre
lated to drug policy." Eastland said "the
attorney general has no further com
ment on the meeting."
