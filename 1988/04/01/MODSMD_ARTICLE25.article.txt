# Senate approves non-military Contra aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Senate over
whelmingly approved a $47.9 million
humanitarian aid package for the
Nicaraguan Contras yesterday, tempo
rarily ending the partisan wrangling
over an issue that has bitterly divided
the White House and Congress for the
last four years.
On an 87-7 vote, the Senate en
dorsed an aid package that was ap
proved the previous day by the House.
President Reagan was expected to sign
it into law today, guaranteeing that
the rebels would soon begin receiving
food, medicine, clothing and other sup
plies while they negotiated a perma
nent cease-fire with Nicaragua's San
dinista leaders.
"No one is an oracle here, no one
can predict what will happen," said
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
noting that the Central American ne
gotiations had entered a volatile stage.

"But you have to keep trying, to es
tablish peace. That's what this is all
this about, to give these negotiations
a chance."
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
said that the humanitarian aid pack
age would not disrupt the week-old
truce in his country's civil war, and
challenged the United States to be
come more involved in the peace proc
ess, calling for direct talks between
the two nations.
He also warned about the possibility
of new military aid to the Contras.
"Today, Reagan got the humanitarian
aid he wanted, but tomorrow another
package could be passed, one that in
cludes military aid. There are further
threats from the United States that
will continue, as will the pressure from
that country," he said.
Democratic and Republican leaders
hailed the Senate's vote, calling it a

rare display of unity over U.S. policy
toward Central America. But other
members said that they were support
ing the resolution reluctantly. Depend
ing on their point of view, critics said
the humanitarian aid was either too
little to sustain the rebels or a step
toward wider U.S. involvement in the
Nicaraguan war.
Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., charged,
for example, that the failure of
Congress to provide military aid to the
Contras would be remembered "as one
of the gravest mistakes in U.S. foreign
policy ever made. ... It's an error we
will regret for many years to come."
The House voted Feb. 3 against an
aid package containing military aid for
the rebels, effectively ending all U.S.
assistance as of Feb. 29. Boren, who
subsequently proposed a package of
Contra aid that included military as
sistance, said that hard-core Contra

supporters had no choice but to sup
port the humanitarian aid plan, be
cause without it they could not
negotiate successfully with the Sandi
nistas.
He also conceded that there were
not enough Congress now to
approve new military aid. Both sides
agreed that Congress had to comply
with the cease-fire agreement, which
specifically ruled out military aid by
the United States to the rebels while
peace talks continued.
Still, Contra supporters said that
the Sandinistas could not be trusted
to negotiate in good faith and sugges
ted that the current talks may be only
a temporary lull in the civil war.
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said: "We
are skeptical (that the peace talks will
succeed) but we are again giving ne
gotiations a chance,
