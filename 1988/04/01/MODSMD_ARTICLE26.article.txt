# Congress nears completion of landmark trade bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Congressional
conferees moved toward completion
last night of landmark trade legislation
that was seen as far less protectionist
than separate bills approved over
whelmingly last year by the Senate
and House of Representatives.
One of the 17 conference subcom
mittees working on the trade bill yes
terday approved stiff trade sanctions
against the Toshiba Corp., a subsidiary
of the Japanese electronics conglom
erate, and against a state-owned Nor
wegian arms firm for selling militarily
sensitive technology to the Soviet Un
ion. The congressional sanctions, al
though accompanied by waivers for
national security and other reasons,
were strongly opposed by the Reagan
administration, Japan and Toshiba.
Congress had already banned Tos
hiba Corp. sales to the Defense De
partment for one year. The measure
approved yesterday also would ban the
corporation, one of Japan's largest

electronics conglomerates, from
making sales to any U.S. government
agency for three years. However, ex
ceptions could be made in cases where
national security was affected, a con
tract was already in progress or spare
parts or special technology were
needed.
The original Senate measure had
provided for a ban on all Toshiba Corp.
sales in America, which the company
says have run about $2.5 billion a
year. However, critics pointed out that
a total ban might be too disruptive
because Toshiba is a player in
U.S. consumer and industrial markets
as well as some government opera
tions.
The conferees also agreed to ban for
three years all sales in the United
States by Toshiba Machine Co., the
Toshiba subsidiary that made the sale
to the Soviets. The subsidiary's sales
here totaled $105.5 million in the year
ending March 31, 1987, according to

Toshiba Corp.
The measures would also apply to
the state-owned Norwegian company
Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk, which par
ticipated in the sale with Toshiba Ma
chine.
Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, a sponsor
of the measure, said the amended ver
sion made the desired point. "I'm very
pleased," he told reporters. " ...
Frankly I have gotten tired of the
administration not doing anything
about this issue."
Toshiyuki Takano, a Japanese Em
bassy spokesman, said the congres
sional sanctions could undermine the
international agreement to police sales
of technology to communist countries.
Enforcement of the agreement is each
country's responsibility, he said.
"It is very regrettable that Congress,
in an unprecedented act of blind ven
geance, has reached out to punish the
innocent in Japan and the U.S. on a
vast scale. Nothing like it has ever

happened before in our two countries'
histories," said Nobuo Ishizaka, chair
man of Toshiba America Inc., the
firm's chief U.S. subsidiary.
It remained unclear last night
whether the waivers would be enough
to preclude a presidential veto.
A objective of congressional
leaders was to craft strong legislation
that would force White House action
in future cases of unfair trade practices
without drawing a veto from President
Reagan, who has vowed not to sign
protectionist legislation.
With the conferees making progress
on Capitol Hill, the White House yes
terday appeared to be backing away
from a veto threat. "We are not sig
naling a final veto," White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, add
ing that the administration remains
"hopeful we still can get a bill we
would sign."
