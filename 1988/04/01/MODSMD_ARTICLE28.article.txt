## Recruit for CIV 
### 
IT'S ONE THING to adopt a
policy. It's another to imple
ment it.
Yesterday, the term "Western
Culture" officially dropped out of
Stanford's vocabulary when the
Faculty Senate replaced the Area
One requirement with a program
called "Cultures, Ideas and
Values."
The change represents a major
philosophical shift in the require
ment. No longer is the Area One
requirement intended to help stu
dents understand American cul
ture merely through the historical
influences of Europe. Now, it will
take into account the effects of the
various other cultures that have
had an impact on the way we see
ourselves.
Instead of defining American
culture in terms of this country's
European heritage, the program
will address the influences that
non-"traditional" and minority
cultures have had. Third World
cultures, gay and lesbian cultures
and ethnic minority cultures have
all played roles in constructing the
United States. And for too long
these influences have been ignored.
While broadening the Area One
requirement, the senate retained
the Western Culture program's
most positive feature: that it pro
vided for a "common intellectual
experience" for undergraduates.
Although the required core
reading list — which was the
guarantor of Western Culture's
common intellectual experience —
has been dropped, CIV requires
that particular themes be ad
dressed in the different tracks and
that the program's instructors
decide what they will teach in com
mon each year.
The requirement ensures that
CIV will continue to give freshmen
the opportunity to discuss impor
tant intellectual issues with each
other, regardless of which Area

One track they are taking.
The annual redefinition of the
program's common elements will
institutionalize good, healthy
debate on the themes of the
program — another indication that
a philosophical shift has occurred.
It will be well worth the effort for
the program's instructors to spend
some time each year justifying to
each other why they teach what
they teach.
As part of the philosophical
switch from a Eurocentric outlook
to a more diverse outlook, the pro
gram now requires that the issues
of race, gender and class be ad
dressed in significant ways each
quarter.
Implementing all the changes
called for in this philosophical shift
is a tall order. The senate recog
nized that it has created a program
that seeks to present a great va
riety of perspectives, and yesterday
the senate called for active recruit
ing of present Stanford faculty
"with expertise in cultures outside
the European cluster" to provide
that perspective.
But there may not be enough
available professors here with this
expertise to guarantee ClV's suc
cess. The University should move
outside and recruit lecturers and
teaching assistants who have that
expertise and can eventually move
into tenured positions.
CIV will work if a professor who
feels incapable of teaching from a
feminist perspective, for example,
gets a lecturer or teaching assis
tant that can provide that perspec
tive.
Faculty members who recognize
their biases and hire people with
complementary biases will be fol
lowing the spirit of CIV.
The faculty was unified in the
belief that a new program was
needed. The faculty must now be
unified in their efforts to make it
really work.
