History faculty lacks knowledge of Polish history

IF THE HISTORY Department's
procedure in dismissing Norman
Davies has been upheld by the
court, we now may begin to question
the department's scholarly competence.
There is a prevalance of misinforma
tion in Polish/Jewish questions, and no
indication that the Stanford scholars
have taken this into account. Acknowl
edgement of this fact is one sign of
competent authority. Ability to distin
guish true from false is another.
American Jews and American Poles
have been working jointly under such
acknowledgment since 1979, trying to
overcome misunderstanding, and it
would be good to bring Stanford's
talent up to speed in these historic

questions.
First, several examples of such
misinformation. One was expressed in
The Daily May 21, 1986, when a
teaching assistant in the History De
partment wrote, "Hitler chose to place
Auschwitz and other major extermina
tion camps in Poland in part because
of the virulent anti-Sematism which
prevailed there."
The false notion that Hitler enter
tained any "choices" for locating his
genocidal operations against Jews —
and Poles — is a canard belied by
logistics.
The main body of target Jews, over
3 million, already lived in Poland, for
centuries the world homeland of the

Jewish people. Further, the first vic
tims of the gas at Auschwitz were 300
Poles and 700 Russian POWs; the
"final solution" for the Jews was not
decided until 1942.
Until then, Poles were the meyority .
of prisoners in Auschwitz, and it was
Poles who were the target of genocidal
actions under Nazi occupation in the
west and under the Soviet Communists
in the east.
The number of non-Jewish Poles
eventually killed in death camps is
1,377,000. The total number of Chris
tian Poles killed by the Nazis in non
combat extermination actions is about
3,000,000.
Have the T.A.'s mentors in the

History Department corrected him? Afe
they competent to do so?
Bringing these examples to bear on
the present issue, we may conclude
that such misinformation, so wide
spread and so important, should not be
outside the knowledge and beyond the
objections of the Stanford History
Department or any other history de
partment.
Yet we hear no corrections. So when
doubtful critics of Norman Davies
accuse him of defective scholarship, I
ask them: How would you know?
