# South Africa policy doesn't do enough

### 
The story of Stanford's South
African investment policy investments
policy would be funny — if it weren't
so sad.
Two months ago the Commission on
Investment Responsibility presented
the Trustee's Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility with a well
researched, carefully worded report
recommending that the University
abandon its 10-year-old policy of "selec
tive disinvestment."
ClR's report makes clear that, at
this stage, no foreign investment can
have a positive effect in South Africa.
The apartheid government's explicit
goal is to prevent foreign investors
from challenging their power and
privilege. Investors in South Africa
either tow the government's line on
apartheid or they leave.
ClR's proposal (published in Campus
Report on Feb. 3) was that Stanford

should vote in favor of withdrawal
from South Africa ("disinvestment") on
all resolutions put forward at the
shareholder meetings of companies
doing business in South Africa. (Stan
ford owns stock in 81 such companies,
for a total investment of about $170
million.)
This move would help bring Stan
ford's policy up to date, taking into
account the South African govern
ment's recent efforts to stop all anti
apartheid activity.
In response to the appalling situa
tion in South Africa, a vote for corpo
rate withdrawal is hardly a dramatic
action. It falls far short of total divest
ment (actually selling our shares), for
example, which is the longstanding
demand of the overwhelming majority
of black South African leaders.
But SCIR's response to ClR's pro
posal was astonishing: On March 7, as
students were heading into Dead Week,
the Trustees announced the Universi
ty's new policy:
• To vote for the withdrawal of a few
exceptionally bad companies (those

which have received Category 111 or
below ratings on the [Sullivan] State
ment of Principles), and
• To abstain in all other cases.
Such a weak and ill-conceived non
policy would be laughable if it weren't
about such a serious issue.
Why should Stanford deliberately
abstain on these shareholder resolu
tions? Are the Trustees so ill-informed
that they don't know which way to
vote? Or are they just afraid to sup
port withdrawal resolutions, which
would mean voting against the man
agement of donor companies (like
Hewlett Packard and Chevron) — but
equally afraid to vote for staying in
South Africa, which the Stanford com
munity clearly opposes?
Such dilemmas are the stuff of life.
They are what leadership is all about.
If the administration of this University
is unable or unwilling to provide that
leadership, then we all lose.
The Trustees' nonpolicy is making
me deeply cynical about the strength
of this institution. Worse yet, I'm
bored: If our Administration isn't

going to lead us, why should I pay
attention to it?
