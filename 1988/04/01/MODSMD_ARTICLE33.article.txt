## Jackson a possibility 
### 
15 M TIRED OF hearing people ask
what Jesse Jackson wants. So
here's the column which I've been
holding back: the one about Jackson. The
one which will shock my grandparents.
The one which will infuriate many good
friends.
Here goes.
What Jesse Jackson really wants, for
starters, is for the pundits to stop asking
what he wants. He also wants to be
elected President. He just might.
Jackson's presidential candidacy has
become impossible for even his bitterest
critics to ignore. Now that he has an
excellent shot at the Democratic nomi
nation, a large faction of the party has
begun to explore ways to deny him that
brass ring.
The Democratic good ol' boys (GOBs)
act like they were only letting Jackson
play because they assumed he wouldn't
win.
The GOBs first began to sweat when
Jackson won the most popular votes on
Super Tuesday. Don't worry, they ration
alized, it's just the black vote. Just?
Then came a strong second-place finish
in Illinois, and still more GOB perspira
tion. It's only the favorite-son vote, they
assured themselves.
But when the caucus results from
Michigan indicated a landslide for Jack
son, the GOBs had run out of rope. So
despite a tiny rebound for Mike Dukakis,
the GOBs chosen messiah, these fellows
began their "Stop Jackson" effort in ear
nest.
What hypocrites.
I'm no Jackson fan. But this "Stop
Jackson" crusade has to be the most
repulsively undemocratic and un-

Democratic idea I've seen in the race
since the Dukakis machine passed around
the Biden-Kinnock plagiarism tape.
I'm no Jackson fan. A 1 Gore and Du
kakis are more electable. But that doesn't
mean Jackson is not electable.
If you think what I've said so far
sounds like support for Jackson, you're
half right. I support his right to campaign
without condescension and intramural
backstabbing. In other words, let's take
this serious candidate seriously.
But part of taking a candidate seriously
is criticizing his shortcomings, and I have
plenty of criticism. Some voters are
prejudiced, to be sure, but my reserva
tions about Jesse Jackson have nothing
to do with race.
As The Mercury News put it, Jackson
"lacks political and business experience;
his positions are radical; and he deals in
'concerns' rather than 'issues.'"
Where he does discuss issues, he is not
only radical but also often gets the facts
wrong. In his basic stump speech, Jack
son blasts the Reaganites for letting a
number of social programs "crash."
"Scholarships for our youth crashed.
Day care, too, has crashed. Head Start
crashed." Fact is, U.S. Dept. of Education
grants have grown from $3.6 billion in
1980 to $5.7 billion in 1988, a 58 percent
jump.
Jackson's also wrong about day care
and Head Start. Day care, both private
and public, has grown every year since
1980. And Head Start funding and en
rollment growth has far outstripped in
flation during the Reagan years.
Another bogeyman for Jackson is the
dreaded "negative impression" statistic.
According to a February New York Times

poll, 43 percent of all whites dislike him.
Jackson's foreign policy views disturb
many, but what worries me is his lack
of experience. To be sure, he has great
expertise in many world "hot spots" like
South Africa, the Middle East and Cen
tral America â€” although some critics
find his stances in these arenas so dif
ferent from their own that they wrongly
call this very expertise into question.
His foreign policy weaknesses, rather,
lie in the areas of arms control and
dealing with "cool spots," such as Mexico,
Canada, Japan, Britain and West Ger
many.
Finally, Jackson has yet to publicly
distance himself from black racist Louis
Farrakhan. I can forgive, if not forget,
the "Hymietown" slip (for which Jackson
duly apologized), but I don't want a pres
ident who calls Farrakhan friend. Appar
ently Jackson feels that the support of
Black Muslims is more crucial than that
of Jews.
Like the rest of the candidates, then,
Jackson has his strengths and weak
nesses. But in their quest to Stop Bush,
many machine Democrats have somehow
decided it is necessary to Stop Jackson.
What better way to guarantee a Bush
win in November?
