## Treating the terror of fear 
### Theresa Klosterman 
Stanford students have nothing to
fear but fear itself, according to research
by Bruce Arnow, director of behavioral
medicine at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter.
With his present research on panic
attacks and agoraphobia — the fear of
panicing in public — Arnow is helping
people cope with fear that far exceeds
the typical pre-exam jitters.
"Panic is a qualitatively different ex
perience than the anxiety of a final ex
am," Arnow said. "Panic attacks are
very abrupt disturbances involving
physical symptoms [that] don't last very
long." Arnow has treated over 100
patients with panic disorders. *
He has treated Stanford students and
faculty of all ages as well as many in
dividuals in the surrounding community
and is presently directing programs to
help agoraphobics and others with less
severe panic disorders.
His 17-week treatment program for
agoraphobics will entail four weeks of
sessions where patients will be exposed
to panic-producing situations. Hopeful
ly, they will learn strategies from
therapists for coping with their anxiety.
Both panic attacks and the more
serious problem of agoraphobia are*
characterized by an increase in heart
rates, palpitations of the heart, sweaty
palms, lightheadedness, dizziness or
nausea. Agoraphobics not only experi
ence the attacks but also fear situations
that could lead to further panic situa
tions.
"In essence, it's the fear of fear,"
Arnow said.
Agrophobics greatest fear is when and
where panic attacks might strike. They
are afraid of losing control of their ac
tions, embarrassing themselves, suffer
ing a heart attack or dying. They espe
cially fear that if an attack strikes they
will not be able to escape from public
places, Arnow explained.
"[Agorophobics] may avoid public
transportation at all costs because they
fear they may have a panic attack while
riding a bus or subway," and in extreme
cases agoraphobics have difficulty
leaving their homes alone, according to
Arnow.
Agoraphobia affects three to six per
cent of the population. Arnow said the

disorder usually strikes people in their
early 20?? and affects two to four times
more women than men.
"It's unclear why there is such a high
percentage of female agoraphobics," he
said. Arnow speculated that men might
be afflicted bv agrophobia as often as
women "but find it less socially accept
able to seek treatment for their fears
because [men] are supposed to be able
to handle them."
Arnow said he will gradually expose
patients to classrooms, stores, shopping
centers, public transportation and other
situations people deal with on a daily
basis.
"In some cases that may require some
medication to facilitate their exposure
to the situation," Arnow said.
In each of the therapy sessions Arnow
plans for therapists to show patients

how to change their thinking patterns
in hopes of reducing the severity of
their panic attacks.
According to Arnow, agoraphobics
tend to "think in catastrophic ways"
about the physical symptons of their
panic and become even more panicked.
"If they interpret the panic symptoms
as the symptoms of a heart attack, then
they begin to fear [the next panic at
tack]," he explained.
Hoping that patients will be able to
overcome their panic, Arnow said he
will modify agoraphobics' thought pat
terns and teach them healthy diet and
exercise habits.
He stressed regular exercise and lim
ited amounts of caffeine and other
stimulants that "may be setting up vic
tims to have more panic attacks."
