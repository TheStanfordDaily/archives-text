# Identify corporate logos
## 
### Paul de Figueiredo Staff writer 
When I'm bolting down the highway
on a cross-country trip and notice off
in the distance a pair of golden arches,
I know there is a McDonald's, and that
Big Mac that I'm always craving, is not
far away.
McDonald's, like so many other cor
porations, has succeeded in emblazoning
upon my mind, as well as upon the
minds of millions of other Americans,
a symbol — the golden arches — which
has become synonymous with its name
and products.
Have other companies been as suc
cessful as McDonald's in creating well
known symbols? Drawn below are a se

ries of company logos. See if you can
match each one with the corporation it
represents.
The winner of last quarter's beer and
wine cooler slogan brain teaser was the
Privileges Division of Green Library,
whose members have obviously taken
privilege of Green's former 11 p.m.
closing.
Here are the answers the privileged
came up with: 1. Lowenbrau, 2. L.A.
Beer, 3. Miller Lite, 4. Seagram's Wine
Coolers, 5. Bartles and James Wine
Coolers, 6. Miller, 7. Hamms, 8. Coors,
9. Colt 45, 10. Busch, 11. Schlitz, 12.
Corona, 13. Lone Star.

Mind benders and puzzles appear in
Brain Teaser every Friday.
