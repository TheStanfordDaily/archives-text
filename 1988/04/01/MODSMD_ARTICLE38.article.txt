One of the good things about
turning 21 is that there are so
many more entertainment op
tions open to you (that is, if
you've never had a fake 1.D.).
In the first place, you can drink
alcohol legally and, secondly,
you can go to the good
nightclubs.
There are a few nightclubs
which cater to the under 21
crowd like the Vortex, but
chances are you'll be bumping
into Paly High kids all night.
Everyone knows that the best
clubs to go to are, the 21 and
over places.
If you've just become legal

and have never gone to a 21
and over nightclub, the best
way to start your nightlife ed
ucation is to go to the South
of Market area in San Fran
cisco. There are a lot of
nightclubs in that area and one
of the more obvious and
popular places to go to is The
Oasis.
The Oasis is one of those
converted warehouse-type of
places which doesn't look like
anything on the outside but
which houses a large and
rather Â»atmospheric place for
dancing, drinking and scam
ming to loud rock and dance
music.
There's a cover charge of
about $7 which is offset by the
relatively inexpensive prices for
drinks. As you walk in, you
have two possible paths to take.
If you choose to go to the right,

you'll see a relatively small bar
area with an elevated dance
floor which is populated by
guys showing off their Michael
Jackson moves.
If you turn to your left, you'll
walk into the main dance area
which kind of looks like a small
gymnasium. In fact, there's
even a pool under the dance
floor which is likely used most
during the club's private par
ties.
Before you get to the dance
floor, however, there's a large
milling area where people
presumably ask each other to
dance but it's mostly just guys
standing around. On this par
ticular evening, the male to
female ratio was about 2 to 1
and about half the people there
were with dates. But that
doesn't mean it's impossible to
meet anyone.
If you do happen to meet
someone with whom you want
to talk and you don't want your
tender words drowned out by
the sound of the loud music,
you can go upstairs to the
balcony-like outdoor area
where you can talk, cool off or
check out the people below who
are lined up to get in.
The Oasis gets pretty
crowded and if you get there
late there can be a 15 minute
to half an hour wait. If things
start getting too hot (atmos
pherically and otherwise) in the
dance area, they have a sky
roof which slides open to cool
things down.
All in all, the Oasis is a good
place to dance though it isn't
the easiest place to meet
people.
