# Movie Review
## Funny 'Biloxi' one of Simon's best 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
Die-hard Neil Simon fans will
rush to see "Biloxi Blues" and so
should everyone else, even those
a little weary of Simon's work,
because this is a funny, lively
movie that beats out most of the
current competition. "Biloxi
Blues" is clever and quick, and
makes you laugh for the right
reasons: The actors are terrific,
the story well-written, and the
jokes truly funny.
Matthew Broderick is Eugene
Jerome, the smart-ass New York
kid of "Brighton Beach Memoirs"
who is now fresh out of high
school, newly enlisted in the army
and stuck down in Biloxi, Miss.,
for training with a bunch of other
kids. The comedy is brewed from
the violent clash of the different
personalities and ethnicities
jumbled together in the platoon.
There are some really colorful
characters drawn here: all exag
gerated, but believable and like
able. These kids don't try to "get
along," they want to brag and
argue and prove themselves, and
their fights are constant, childish
and hilarious.
Their commanding officer,
Toomey, (brilliantly played by
Christopher Walken) is cold, un
balanced and one of the most fas
cinating commanding officers in
war movie history. He puts them
through the usual army antics in
the Mississippi swamps.
The film sparkles. It seems fres
her than a lot of Simon's other
work. This is a well-written play
made into a very deft movie: It
does what movies are supposed
to do. The situations all work well
and the laughs just keep coming.
There's a good scene when
Eugene visits a prostitute: This

is classic movie material, but it's
handled in a new way here. The
hooker is remarkably appealing
and fun, and the scene stays light.
The set-up has been used a hun
dred times before, but here it's
done with new flair.
When Eugene meets his first
love Daisy at a dance it is touching
and believable without being
nauseating: It has the mundane,
silly but magical feeling that
seems just right. The movie is full
of these moments â€” once in a
while it stumbles, but the film
manages to be occasionally quite
serious without losing its fun.
Broderick is, as usual, preco
cious and magnetic; he has a
spark that keeps you watching
and draws you in. His Eugene is
an amiable and impossible joker:
anv actor who could make Ferris

Bueller believable can do Eugene
Jerome without even trying, and
Broderick does it perfectly.
Set in contrast to Broderick is
Walken as Toomey, a creepy, won
derful man with heavy-lidded, all
seeing eyes. Walken gives a mas
terful performance: He's as enig
matic as Broderick is expressive.
Toomey dislikes Eugene, and
it's interesting to watch the an
tagonism played out by these two
great actors. All the supporting
actors are excellent as well; the
casting could not have been bet
ter.
Make no mistake, this is not a
shakingly original movie, nor is
it a particularly profound one, but
it's solidly built and extremely
funny. It's the kind of well-made
comedy that we should expect,
and certainly see.
