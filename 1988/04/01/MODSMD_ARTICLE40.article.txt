"Au Revoir Les Enfants"
Aquarius
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
To Julien Quentin, a pubescent
student at a French Catholic
boarding school, World War II and
the German occupation were
nothing more than a large game.
Smuggling rationed goods and
missing class because of air raids
added a new excitement to his
regimented life, and everything
seemed more fun until the arrival
of three new students at midterm.
"Au Revoir Les Enfants" fol
lows Julien's growing friendship
with one of the new boys, Jean,
as it becomes apparent that the
newcomer is a Jew being hidden
from the Nazis. Director/writer
Louis Malle utilizes a restrained
and straightforward cinematic
style, letting his powerful, semi
autobiographical story carry the
film.
Unfortunately, the plot itself is
a bit too sparse, with the charac
ters of Julien and Jean never be
coming fully dynamic, and result
ing in a tragic, but strangely un
emotive film.
The relationship between the
two boys begins on a competitive
basis. Julien is the popular head
of the class who must face up to
the intellectual challenge posed by
the more introverted and stoic
Jean.
Eventually, however, their bat
tling evolves into a bonding of
comradery, only to have the new
friendship attacked by the ever
present German threat. From the
beginning it is obvious that Jean's

hiding is hopeless, and that it is
only a matter of time before the
idealistic world of the school is
trampled by the all-too real war
outside.
The acting by Gaspard Manesse
and Raphael Fejto as Julien and
Jean respectiveley is remarkably
mature, but a bit too restrained,
with the result that the two never
develop as true individuals for the
viewer, remaining as strangers

who cannot be understood. The
sterile nature of the acting is not
at all aided by the film's simplistic
style, which is composed solely of
medium-close-up, eye-level shots.
This combination of reserved
acting and cinematic style creates
a film which, despite its powerful
theme, is sadly banal in nature.
One never is drawn into the
spoiled world of Julien, or the
tragedies of Jean.

Instead, the viewer is left with
a feeling of loss, not for the
children as the title states, but
for the film itself.

"D.0.A."
Century Cinema 10

In this remake of the 1949

movie of the same name,
screenwriter Charles Edward
Pogue ("The Fly") has created a
story so weak that even Holly
wood's current certified Hottest
Actor can't save it.
Dennis Quaid plays college pro
fessor Dexter Cornell who,
embroiled in professional and per
sonal turmoil, finds himself one
afternoon with only 24 hours to
live after having been poisoned
with a slow-acting toxin. In Cor
nell's final hours he rushes to
find out who murdered him and
why.
This would be a great premise
for a whodunit, except that as the
solution to the mystery unravels,
the explanations behind the char
acters' motives become increas
ingly improbable. Furthermore,
Pogue kills off the characters in
the film with such zeal that by
the end we know who the mur
derer is by a simple process of
elimination.
Quaid logs another fine per
formance as the dying professor
(although he spends a great deal
of the time looking deathly), and
is joined once again by "In
nerspace" co-star Meg Ryan as
naive student Sydney Fuller.
Regrettably, the relationship be
tween Quaid and Ryan is such
that he has to glue himself to her
(yes, you read correctly) in order
to keep her from leaving. The pas
sion between the two is limited
to one disappointing, less-than
torrid kiss.
At least the title is apt. This
movie was D.O.A. — "Dumb On
Arrival."

"Masquerade"
Century Cinema 10

"Masquerade" is the latest
thriller of the "Body Heat" genre,
and it's a perfectly acceptable
movie without being at all special.
Not enough sex, not enough
suspense, not enough surprises;
it doesn't have any sparkle, but
it's mildly interesting nonethe
less.
Rob Lowe — well cast for the
first time in his career — plays
a pretty boy who plans to seduce,
marry, then kill a shy young
heiress (Meg Tilly). It's fun and
eerie to watch as Meg Tilly blos
soms under the manipulations of
this evil flatterer. The two actors
are good in their roles.
The set-up is fine, the acting
good and there are definitely some
bizarre twists, but the suprises
come to early in the movie and
they just aren't jolting or creepy
enough.
The one terrific and odious
character — Tilly's corrupt step
father — bows out too early on.
He has wild eyes, stained crooked
teeth, and a despicable, oily man
ner. You can sit back and really
relish hating him, but then he's
suddenly gone and so is a lot of
the movie's energy.
Psychological thrillers should
suck you in, involve you, and
"Masquerade" just doesn't do
this. It all seems removed,
studied; there are some clever
touches, but it isn't enough.
