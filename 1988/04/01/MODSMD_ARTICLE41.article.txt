## Stanford, Mussina squeeze Cal, 3-2 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
It's difficult to
imagine Mike
Mussina throwing
much better than
he did yesterday,
but Stanford
Coach Mark

Marquess said his freshman
righthander didn't have his best
stuff.
"He's better than that,"
Marquess said. "He can juice it
up better than that."
Still, Mussina juiced it up pretty
well yesterday, throwing a
complete-game six-hitter as the
Cardinal squeeked past league
leading California 3-2 at Sunken
Diamond.
Mussina struck out six and
walked only two to move his
record to 5-1 on the year. Stan
ford's record improves to 21-10
overall and 8-4 in league.
Going into the second game of
the series at 2:30 p.m. today at

Evans Diamond in Berkeley, the
Cardinal trails the first-place
Bears (24-12, 9-4) by a half game
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division standings. The
series concludes with a game at
1 p.m. tomorrow at Sunken Dia
mond.
Mussina's impressive outing
was a welcome change for him
and for the team. Stanford's
pitchers had given up 30 runs on
39 hits in the Cardinal's three
losses at Arizona State last week
end, and Mussina hadn't made it
past the fourth inning in either
of his last two starts.
Yesterday was different.
"1 had the good stuff for the
whole game," he said. "I think I
threw 90 percent fastballs today
... it must have had good move
ment because they were popping
up and hitting a lot of weak
groundballs ... they didn't get
good wood on it most of the
game."
Indeed, the Bears threatened
seriously only once after the third

inning. In the fifth, with the game
tied 1-1, Cal's Todd Mayo singled.
Darryl Vice then lofted a fly to
deep left-center. Stanford sopho
more leftfielder Brian Johnson
and freshman centerfielder Mike
Eicher crossed signals and
Johnson dropped the ball. Vice
ended up on second and Mayo
moved to third.
Bart Frets brought Mayo in
with a sacrifice fly to give the
Bears a 2-1 lead, but Mussina
retired 12 of the next 14 Cal bat
ters the rest of the way.
Mussina's six strikeouts in
cluded three whiffs of Bear
cleanup hitter John Kuehl, all
three coming with men in scoring
position. (Kuehl hit into a double
play his fourth time up, with no
outs and the tying run on first
in the eighth inning; all things
considered, the Bears might have
preferred that he strike out
again.)
"For a freshman, he (Mussina)
has really good poise," Frets said.
"He can locate the fastball wher

ever he wants ... he moved it
around and came in on our
hands."
Stanford, meanwhile, didn't
score off Bear starter Fred Corral
until the fourth, when junior Ed
Sprague tied the game 1-1 with
his ninth home run of the season.
The homer looked remarkably like
Sprague's first eight of the
season: a low-flying cannon shot
over the left-field fence.
Trailing 2-1 in the bottom of
the fifth, the Cardinal knotted the
game again when junior Paul
Carey walked, went to second on
sophomore Troy Paulsen's single
and came home on junior Ron
Witmeyer's single.
An inning later, Stanford took
the lead for good. Senior Doug
Robbins led off the sixth with a
blooper into right. Johnson, up
next, ripped a shot through the
box. The ball caromed off Corral's
leg into right field. Robbins
motored to third, then scored on
sophomore Tim Griffin's sac
crifice fly to deep right-center to

put Stanford up 3-2.
Card notes
Johnson, who also was the starting
quarterback on the Stanford football
team, was three-for-four on the day
to extend his hitting streak to 11
games. He singled in the second, sixth
and eighth innings.
Freshman Stan Spencer (4-1 with
a 3.04 ERA) will get the start for the
Cardinal today, facing undefeated
Mark Juhas (5-0, 2.95). Juhas is 3-0
with a 1.38 ERA in four Six-Pac
starts. Spencer, like Mussina,
struggled in his last two Six-Pac out
ings. He lasted only 3V3 innings
against Arizona on March 25, and
exited after four against ASU last
Sunday.
Marquess said the poor outings by
his two freshman starters may be at
tributable to the long break from
games during Dead Week and Finals
Week last quarter. The team went 12
days (from March 6 to March 19)
without a game and Spencer and Mus
sina "weren't sharp" after the break,
Marquess said.
Senior Lee Plemel will start tomor
row's game for the Cardinal. The

Bears' starter has not been deter
mined yet. Cal is facing something of
a pitching crisis because of an injury
to ace Travis Willis. Willis has started
10 games for the Bears this season,
but will miss at least a week.

game again when junior Paul
Carey walked, went to second on
sophomore Troy Paulsen's single
and came home on junior Ron
Witmeyer's single.
An inning later, Stanford took
the lead for good. Senior Doug
Robbins led off the sixth with a
blooper into right. Johnson, up
next, ripped a shot through the
box. The ball caromed off Corral's
leg into right field. Robbins
motored to third, then scored on
sophomore Tim Griffin's sac
crifice fly to deep right-center to

put Stanford up 3-2.
Card notes
Johnson, who also was the starting
quarterback on the Stanford football
team, was three-for-four on the day
to extend his hitting streak to 11
games. He singled in the second, sixth
and eighth innings.
Freshman Stan Spencer (4-1 with
a 3.04 ERA) will get the start for the
Cardinal today, facing undefeated
Mark Juhas (5-0, 2.95). Juhas is 3-0
with a 1.38 ERA in four Six-Pac
starts. Spencer, like Mussina,
struggled in his last two Six-Pac out
ings. He lasted only 3V3 innings
against Arizona on March 25, and
exited after four against ASU last
Sunday.
Marquess said the poor outings by
his two freshman starters may be at
tributable to the long break from
games during Dead Week and Finals
Week last quarter. The team went 12
days (from March 6 to March 19)
without a game and Spencer and Mus
sina "weren't sharp" after the break,
Marquess said.
Senior Lee Plemel will start tomor
row's game for the Cardinal. The

Bears' starter has not been deter
mined yet. Cal is facing something of
a pitching crisis because of an injury
to ace Travis Willis. Willis has started
10 games for the Bears this season,
but will miss at least a week.

the line in the fourth inning of yesterday's game. Although Sprague was not able to nab Scott at

first, his ninth home run of the season in the bottom of the same inning put the Cardinal on the
scoreboard en route to a 3-2 win.

It's difficult to
imagine Mike
Mussina throwing
much better than
he did yesterday,
but Stanford
Coach Mark

Marquess said his freshman
righthander didn't have his best
stuff.
"He's better than that,"
Marquess said. "He can juice it
up better than that."
Still, Mussina juiced it up pretty
well yesterday, throwing a
complete-game six-hitter as the
Cardinal squeeked past league
leading California 3-2 at Sunken
Diamond.
Mussina struck out six and
walked only two to move his
record to 5-1 on the year. Stan
ford's record improves to 21-10
overall and 8-4 in league.
Going into the second game of
the series at 2:30 p.m. today at

Evans Diamond in Berkeley, the
Cardinal trails the first-place
Bears (24-12, 9-4) by a half game
in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division standings. The
series concludes with a game at
1 p.m. tomorrow at Sunken Dia
mond.
Mussina's impressive outing
was a welcome change for him
and for the team. Stanford's
pitchers had given up 30 runs on
39 hits in the Cardinal's three
losses at Arizona State last week
end, and Mussina hadn't made it
past the fourth inning in either
of his last two starts.
Yesterday was different.
"1 had the good stuff for the
whole game," he said. "I think I
threw 90 percent fastballs today
... it must have had good move
ment because they were popping
up and hitting a lot of weak
groundballs ... they didn't get
good wood on it most of the
game."
Indeed, the Bears threatened
seriously only once after the third

inning. In the fifth, with the game
tied 1-1, Cal's Todd Mayo singled.
Darryl Vice then lofted a fly to
deep left-center. Stanford sopho
more leftfielder Brian Johnson
and freshman centerfielder Mike
Eicher crossed signals and
Johnson dropped the ball. Vice
ended up on second and Mayo
moved to third.
Bart Frets brought Mayo in
with a sacrifice fly to give the
Bears a 2-1 lead, but Mussina
retired 12 of the next 14 Cal bat
ters the rest of the way.
Mussina's six strikeouts in
cluded three whiffs of Bear
cleanup hitter John Kuehl, all
three coming with men in scoring
position. (Kuehl hit into a double
play his fourth time up, with no
outs and the tying run on first
in the eighth inning; all things
considered, the Bears might have
preferred that he strike out
again.)
"For a freshman, he (Mussina)
has really good poise," Frets said.
"He can locate the fastball wher

ever he wants ... he moved it
around and came in on our
hands."
Stanford, meanwhile, didn't
score off Bear starter Fred Corral
until the fourth, when junior Ed
Sprague tied the game 1-1 with
his ninth home run of the season.
The homer looked remarkably like
Sprague's first eight of the
season: a low-flying cannon shot
over the left-field fence.
Trailing 2-1 in the bottom of
the fifth, the Cardinal knotted the
game again when junior Paul
Carey walked, went to second on
sophomore Troy Paulsen's single
and came home on junior Ron
Witmeyer's single.
An inning later, Stanford took
the lead for good. Senior Doug
Robbins led off the sixth with a
