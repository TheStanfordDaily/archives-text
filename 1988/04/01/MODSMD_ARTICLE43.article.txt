# Tennis ready for rumble with Bruins and Trojans
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
Running on all
cylinders for the
first time in a big
match this season,
the Stanford
men's tennis team
has eighth-rated

UCLA and No. 1 USC quaking in
their boots.
With the return to singles of
freshman David Wheaton, the No.
2 junior under 18 in the world,
the third-rated Cardinal is a dif
ferent team than the one which
bowed to the Trojans 5-1 Feb. 20
at the National Indoor Intercol
legiate Team Championship in
Louisville, Ky. The loss is the lone
blemish in Stanford's 12-1 record.
Wheaton, recovered from a
wrist injury, sophomore Jeff
Tarango, senior Patrick McEnroe

and freshman Martin Blackman,
all Junior Davis Cup members,
spearhead a team with as much
talent as any of the eight previous
Stanford NCAA champions.
"I don't see any weaknesses
that Stanford has," UCLA Coach
Glenn Bassett said. "We have to
play the best match of our year
against Stanford if we are going
to be in contention. Wheaton is
one of the top prospects in the
world. The future is unlimited for
him."
"With Wheaton playing, I think
Stanford talent-wise has the best
team in the country," USC Coach
Dick Leach said. "We'd be very
fortunate to get a split this week
end, beating Cal and losing to
Stanford."
In a showcase of some of the
top individual and team talent in
American tennis, Stanford hosts
No. 8 UCLA today at 1:30 p.m.

at Stanford Tennis Stadium, fol
lowed by USC in a showdown for
the top spot tomorrow at 1 p.m.
at Stanford Tennis Stadium and
6:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
Tomorrow, the No. 3, 4, 5 and
6 singles and No. 2 and 3 doubles
will be played outdoors. The No.
2 singles match starts off the in
door competition against the
Trojans, followed by the No. 1
singles contest and the No. 1 dou
bles match.
"We're very close to busting out
of the starting gate and just
going," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "We're at the emo
tional crossroads of the season.
This weekend is an opportunity
to take charge and make a state
ment.
"We have nice blend of youth
and experience," Gould added. "In
my 22 years here, we have as
much the making of a champion
ship team as we've ever had."
Today against UCLA (14-4), the
Cardinal takes on a team similar
to last year's Stanford squad.
Plagued by graduation losses and
a season-ending injury to No. 2
singles player Dan Nahirny, the
Bruins, like last season's Cardi
nal, are not as strong this season
as tradition dictates and are a
long shot for the NCAA title.
Stanford hasn't forgotten how
the Bruins dumped the Cardinal
8-1 twice last year. But with
Blackman and freshman Glenn
Solomon joining Wheaton and
holdovers Tarango, McEnroe and
sophomore Jeff Cathrall, payback
time should be in order today.
"We will definitely not overlook
UCLA," McEnroe said.
The outdoor/indoor contest
against USC figures to be a test
of how far Stanford has come
since its 5-1 loss against the
Trojans. It could also be a preview
of the NCAA semifinal or final
match.
Since the USC loss, Wheaton
has returned in singles, and the
doubles combinations of Tarango
and Wheaton, Blackman and
McEnroe, and Cathrall and soph
omore Eric Peus have gelled. The
Cardinal comes off two Pacific 10
Conference wins over Arizona
State and Arizona last weekend
and competed in its best pratice
sessions of the year this week.
"I see a big difference in the
team now than from Louisville,"
Wheaton said. "We all think we
can play a lot better. I'm getting
better every day; I just need a
little more confidence in my back
hand."
USC, which plays at California
today, boasts a 17-2 record. The

Trojans won the National Indoor
Intercollegiate Team Champion
ship and last weekend took the
Blue-Gray tournament. USC has
defeated Stanford, No. 2 Loui
siana State, Pepperdine, UC-
Irvine and Michigan this year.
The Trojans' losses came against
Pepperdine and Arizona State.
Though a deep team, like Stan
ford, from top to bottom, the
Trojans' rely on the top of their
singles lineup and their No. 1 dou
bles team. Senior starter Jonas

Wallgrad, a native Swede, is in
jured and will not play.
Senior Scott Melville has been
ranked in the top five in singles
all season long. In the first
meeting between these teams, he
bested Tarango 7-6 (7-5), 6-4. He
also owns a tournament win over
Wheaton.
Junior John Carras, Zimbabwe
native Byron Black, and junior
Eric Amend have all been ranked
in the nation's top 50 since the
season's start. In Stanford's loss

to USC, Carras defeated McEnroe
6-3, 7-6, Blackman upended Black
7-6 (8-6), 6-2, and Amend edged
Cathrall 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5).
"We haven't done as well aa we
have to at No. 5 and No. 6
singles," Leach said. "Those areas
will be difficult for us against
Stanford."
In doubles play, Melville and
Amend are the nation's top
ranked tandem. Their lone loss
came against Tarango and
Wheaton at the Volvo/All America

Stanford freshman Glenn Solomon is 9-1 In dual matches this
season, giving him the second-best winning percentage on the
Cardinal.

Stanford has had trouble beating USC and UCLA in doubles in the past, but Eric Peus (serving) and
Jeff Cathrall, who are undefeated in dual matches in 1988, have keyed the resurgent Cardinal doubles.
