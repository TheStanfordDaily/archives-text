# Spikers battle Rainbows
## 
### Jon Weisman Editorial staff 
Well, if one fails
to climb Mt.
Everest, there's
alNvays Kiliman
jaro.
That's how the
Stanford men's

volleyball team must feel as it
tries to scale third-ranked
Hawaii after having just
tumbled down against No. 1
USC Wednesday night.

The 12th-ranked Cardinal
(10-15, 4-9 in the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion) will play two matches in
our 50th state, Monday and
Wednesday. Stanford Coach
Fred Sturm indicated that al
though this mountain may mea
sure up to be slightly less chal
lenging, it could be just as dif
ficult to climb, if not more so.
"(Hawaii) might have the best
ballplayers in America," Sturm
said. "If a guy's having an off
night they just put another guy

in. Not too many teams have
that luxury."
The Rainbows' flexibility
comes from being a solid 10
players deep. However, one
player not likely to need replace
ment is Allen Allen, who Sturm
labeled their best player and
main hitter.
Another caution for the Car
dinal is being in Hawaii itself.
Like Odysseus trying to resist
temptation by Circe, the players
must avoid being distracted by
the enticing Aloha State and
concentrate on their mission.
"Everybody in the league
realizes it's the biggest home
court advantage in the league,"
said Stanford's Dan Hanan, who
listed some of the elements
Stanford must overcome: the
different weather, the time
change and the fervent pro-
Rainbows crowd.
Stanford defeated a very
young Hawaii squad twice early
last season — but at Maples.
But the Rainbows came on
strong later that reason and
have continued that path this
campaign.
Hawaii is undefeated at home
this season, having defeated
highly-ranked UCLA, Long
Beach State and Pepperdine
each twice at home.
"They play very, very well at
home," Sturm said, "so we've
got our hands full to say the
least. . . .The weather condi
tions are different (and) I think
Hawaii is probably more used
to that. I think the guys will be
ready, though."
One thing Stanford wasn't
ready for was the Trojan jug
gernaut that blasted through
Maples Wednesday. The Cardi
nal was left a 15-9, 15-0, 15-6
loser as well as just plain im
pressed.
"In the 10 years I've been at
Stanford I've never seen a com
plete performance like that,"
Sturm said. "So, I have a very
high opinion of them right now.
"We can't really dwell on [the
lossl too long. We just have to
move on and practice tough un
til we leave."
Hanan said that Stanford's
attitude toward the coming
matches will be similar to its
attitude toward the Trojans —
admit the fact that they will
make some great plays, but try
to put those aside and "go on
and play the rest of the game."
