# Netters travel to Arizona
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
One only needs to take a quick glance
at the Volvo/ITCA collegiate women's
singles rankings to get an idea of
who should come out on top this
weekend when Stanford visits
Arizona State and Arizona.
The Cardinal, 15-1 and ranked

second nationally as a team, boasts five of the top
30 individuals, according to the most recent
rankings. On the other hand, Arizona placed only
one player in the top 100, and there were no Sun
Devil entries.
The no-name ASU squad will have a devil of a
time making today's 1:30 p.m. match in Tempe
much closer than the first meeting between the
two schools. In that rain-delayed match which com
menced Feb. 27 and finished the following day,
Stanford bested ASU 5-1 despite playing without
junior Eleni Rossides and freshman Sandra Birch.
The Sun Devils will have to-contend with Birch
this afternoon, who came back from her only absence
of the season to win all six of her singles matches
in March. The Huntington Bay, N.Y., native is
ranked 29th in singles.
Rossides, however, has been out of action for
almost two months and once again did not travel
with the team this weekend. Despite the fact that
she has not played in a dual match this season,
she has steadily climbed the rankings since she
finished second at the Rolex National Indoor Inter
collegiate Championships Feb. 7 (her last competi
tion) and has in fact become the nation's top-ranked
singles player.
Even without Rossides, the Cardinal fields a
lineup that must look overwhelming in the eyes of
ASU and Arizona. Freshman Tami Whitlinger, the 1
player of the month for March, and sophomore Lisa
Green are ranked fifth and 15th, respectively. And
freshman Teri Whitlinger is ranked 24th and is
undefeated in dual-match competition.
Arizona, which hosts the Cardinal at noon to
morrow, traditionally is not intimidated by talented
Stanford teams, and the Wildcats have been espe

daily tough on the Cardinal in Tucson. Last season,
the 'Cats upset visiting Stanford 5-4, and two years
ago they narrowly lost by the same margin.
The No. 15 Wildcats are led by sophomore Betsy
Somerville and senior Susan Russo. Although Russo
usually plays ahead of her in the lineup, Somerville
is ranked 58th nationally, while Russo is unranked.
The two combine to form one of the most potent
doubles teams on the collegiate scene and are pres
ently ranked No. 2.
