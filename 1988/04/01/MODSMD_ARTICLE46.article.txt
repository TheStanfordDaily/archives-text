# Crew's first test a challenge

Stanford will get
an early season
test tomorrow as
the Cardinal Men's
and women's crew
teams travel to the
San Diego Crew

Classic on Mission Bay. The
regatta will not only be the first
heat regatta of the season but will
also pit Stanford against eight of
the nation's top crews.
The preseason goal of Stanford
Men's Coach Ken Dreyfuss was
to win a national-level regatta to
establish Stanford's collegiate
rowing program as significant.

Dreyfuss is optimistic about a
medal-winning performance this
weekend, noting the strength of
this year's winter conditioning
regimen.
The men will face a tough field,
led by Brown, the 1987 National
Championship runner-up, as well
as Washington. The Huskies con
tinue their domination of the
West Coast under new head coach
Bob Ernst, the 1988 Olympic
women's coach. California, Navy
and host San Diego will provide
competitive heats.
"We should be more prepared
for San Diego this year," Stanford
sophomore Scott Evans said. "We
did more training this spring than
we did last year."

Stanford's crews also broke
from tradition by not racing at
the end of spring, giving oarsmen
several extra days of practice
without tapering.
The women's heats will be es
pecially tight. Washington and
Wisconsin battled each other to a
one-two finish at last year's na
tionals. UCLA could sneak into
the fray this year.
"The crews we'll be racing at
the Crew Classic are extremely
tough," Women's Coach John
Davis said. "We don't expect to
be fast yet. If we plan to go fast
at the Crew Classic, we can't ex
pect to row fast at the end of the
season," he added.
