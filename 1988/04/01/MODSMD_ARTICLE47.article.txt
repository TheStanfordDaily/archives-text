# Gymnasts vault into final dual
## Women prepare for regionals 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
It's as easy as
one, two, three
for the Stanford
women's gym
nastics team in
their quest to

I I reach the NCAA
Nationals. Tonight, attempting
to hurdle step two, the Cardi
nal faces the 1 lth-ranked Utah
State Aggies in the last dual
meet of the season.
After enjoying a few days off
after final exams had con
cluded, the gymnasts need to
attain peak perfomances as the
NCAA Regionals approach next
week.
"We took a few days off to
get finals out of our system,"
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina
said. "The Pac-10's got us back
on our feet. This meet will
solidify our position in the
region and we can polish up
what we're doing and be ready
for peak performances at
regionals."
The Utah St. meet, squeezed
between the postseason Pacific
10 Conference Championships
and the NCAA Regionals, could
give the team added leverage
for the regional meet by pos
sibly boosting Stanford's
regional qualifying score
(RQS). The RQS is based upon

the team's two highest home
meet scores, the highest two
away-meet scores and one op
tional score from either a home
or an away meet.
The Cardinal is presently
seeded fifth in its region with
an RQS of 184 points, just one
point behind Washington.
"We could have a great meet,
and it could knock us up the
one notch that we need," Sar
dina said.
With the exception of Cindy
Boyd, whom Sardina has en
tered in the vault, Stanford's
lineup will be the same as at
Pac-lOs. Sophomore Dina
Amoroso, senior Alison
McGann and junior Jinny Rhee
are scheduled to compete in the
all-around.
Stanford will face a well
balanced Aggie team led by
Julie Ryan, who boasts an all
around average score of 37.6.
Amoroso, Stanford's leading
all-around gymnast is just a
fraction off that score with an
average of 37.55.
This last dual meet allows
the gymnasts to work through
their wobbles and regain their
meet confidence and consis
tency before they are truly
tested at the regionals.
"As a team aspiring to make
the NCAAs, you have to give
yourself every opportunity to
reach that pinnacle," Sardina
said.
