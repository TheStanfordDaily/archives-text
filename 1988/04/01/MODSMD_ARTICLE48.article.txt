# Card track hosts world-class meet
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Some of the na
tion's best athletes
— both in and out
of college — will
compete with
Stanford's track
and field team at

the Athletes Equity Challenge
Saturday at Stanford Stadium be
ginning at 11 a.m.
Several world-class athletes, in
cluding 1984 U.S. 1,500-meter
Olympian Ruth Wysocki and
Andre Phillips, one of the best
400-meter racers in the world, are
scheduled to compete Saturday.
In addition, former world record
holder Brian Oldfield will be
throwing the shot put and discus.
The Athletes Equity Challenge
will not suffer the same problem
with drug testing that kept open
athletes out of the Stanford
Holiday Inn Track and Field Fes
tival March 25-26. That meet was
one of 10 meets randomly selected
by The Athletic Congress, track
and field's governing body, to be
drug tested. When Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger decided to forgo
TAC sanction instead, open ath
letes were forced to drop out.
Because this Saturday's meet
was not one of those selected,
however, Stanford can host open
competitors with TAC sanction
without drug testing.
The main collegiate competition
will come from Yale, Long Beach
Community College and the men
of Washington State. Stanford
entries will focus on sprints, field
events and men's middle distance
races. As team scores will not be
kept, the competition will focus
on individuals. College athletes
will be seeking NCAA qualifying

performances.
The top race of the day will pit
Phillips against Washington's
Kris Durr and open competitor
Chris Whitlock in the 400 meters,
with Stanford represented by
freshman James Crampton. Phil
lips is registered with an amazing
seed time of 44.82, followed by
Durr at 45.84. The race is sched
uled to start at 2:30 p.m.
The men's 800 meters will have
half a dozen contenders led by
Stanford senior Christian Skoog
at the NCAA qualifying time of
1:47.6 and recent Stanford alumni
Brain Pettingill and Jeff Atkin
son. Yale freshman Bud Levko
should also contend, as should
Stanford's Bill Crowley, a sopho
more, and Steve Schadler, a
senior, and open competitor Steve
Gerhart.
The women's 3,000 meters will
also be a good race, with Stan
ford's Carol Gray, a sophomore,
taking on Yale's Sara Smith and
Suzanna Beck. All three will be
racing to break the NCAA quali
fying time of 9:22.24. The 3,000
will follow the opening track
event, the men's steeplechase,
which begins at 1:30 p.m.
The shot put and discus will be
another strong competition, with
Oldfield and Greg Tafralis com
peting in both. Sophomores Andy
Papathanassiou and Brian
Boggess will represent the Cardi
nal in the shot, with Boggess and
junior Glen Schneider throwing
the discus.
Stanford's Erica Wheeler, a
junior, will take on all comers in
the women's javelin, while seniors
Brian Marshall and John Gash
will be attempting to hit the
NCAA qualifying marks in the
high jump and pole vault, respec
tively.
