# Researchers isolate master DNA gene

A team of Stanford researchers has made his
tory by isolating and identifying the most im
portant gene involved in reproducing human
DNA.
The research team, headed by Pathology Assoc.
Prof. Teresa Wang, spent more than 15 years
doing background research and an additional two
years studying specifically DNA, or deoxyribo
nucleic acid, to identify the master gene. The
discovery, announced in scientific circles in Eu
rope earlier this year, made headlines in last
Sunday's New York Times.
The gene contains the blueprint for one of the
msyor enzymes responsible for reproduction of
the all human genes, or genome, a protein called
polymerase-alpha.
Human cells contain DNA in chromosomes.
Chromosomes are composed of genes, each of
which has a code for a protein that is responsible
for transmitting the hereditary pattern to cells.
Although the isolation of the master DNA gene
will not provide immediate practical applications
in medicine, the accomplishment enables the
Stanford team to look further into gene differ
entiation, cell transformation and cell growth.

Wang predicted that comparisons between
human and viral polymerases might lead to im
proved drugs capable of fighting serious viral
infections. Current drug treatments — such as
chemotherapy — are non-specific and kill both
healthy cells and those infected with the virus
Wang's discovery could enable researchers to bet
ter isolate and block viral polymerases but leave
healthy human enzymes alone.
Wang downplayed the breakthrough, saying,
"This is not a discovery. We just isolated the
enzyme." But her team's breakthrough
represents the first time a DNA reproduction
enzyme from human cells, or any other organism,
has been identified, she added.
DNA is the meyor hereditary molecule of every
living thing — from bacteria to humans — and
plays important roles in both protein synthesis
and the storage and replication of hereditary
information.
According to Wang, her research team has
already received nearly 100 inquiries about its
work from DNA researchers all over the world.
The isolation of the master gene will contribute
to further development of basic biological re
search, she said.
