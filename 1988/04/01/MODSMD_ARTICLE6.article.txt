Cracking down on alleged student abuse of the
Pass/No Credit option, last night the Faculty Senate
Committee on Academic Appraisal and Achievement
announced a ban on the Pass/No Credit option for
all undergraduate courses beginning this quarter.
In reaction to faculty charges that grading at
Stanford is not "sufficiently challenging," this week
the committee conducted a survey of registered
undergraduates and found that 87 percent were
opting to take at least one class Pass/No Credit.
Based on the survey's findings, Committee Chair
David Wellbery called student use of the Pass/No
Credit option "completely unacceptable" and an
nounced "a spring quarter ban" on the option at

a late night meeting held after the Faculty Senate
Western Culture meeting.
"Our decision (to ban the option) was abrupt but
necessary," Wellbery said. "Students are notoriously
lax spring quarter and we needed to nab this prob
lem before it gets even more out of control."
While Wellbery stressed that the ban will apply
to all undergraduate courses, he said the committee
would evaluate individual cases and allow students
"with exceptional circumstances" to petition for the
Pass/No Credit option.
Throughout today and Monday the committee
will evaluate individual cases. Students who wish
to petition the committee should contact the Aca
demic Standing Office in Old Union at 723-0374.
