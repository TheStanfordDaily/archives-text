# Stanford has higher sex rating
## Survey reveals students here are more sexually active 
### L. Atwood Mark Staff writer 
A comprehensive survey on the
sexual practices of Stanford stu
dents conducted by the Cowell
Student Health Center over the
course of the past year indicates
that undergraduates here er\joy a
greater frequency of sexual activ
ity than the national college
average.
Comparing Cowell's statistics
to those of the 1987 National In
stitutes of Health College Sexual
Attitudes Questionnaire, Cowell
Director Paul Walters said the
survey of 500 undergraduates
shows that the average Stanford
student engages in sexual inter

course almost 30 percent more
often than the average college stu
dent nationwide.
The Cowell survey, patterned
after the NIHCSAQ, was com
prised of a questionnaire asking
students for honest answers to a
wide range of sexual questions.
Respondents were selected at ran
dom, although participants were
asked to disqualify themselves
from answering if they felt they
would be unable to provide frank
responses.
The NIHCSAQ was adminis
tered in a similar manner to
10,000 college students nation
wide in 1987.
Forty-six percent of the respon
dents to the Cowell survey indi

cated that they had sexual inter
course at least once a month, com
pared to the national average of
21 percent. In addition, 60 percent
of the Stanford sample said they
have "sexual encounters without
intercourse" at least once a
month, compared to the national
average of 39 percent.
Twenty-six percent of Stanford
freshman men said they were vir
gins upon their arrival at the
Farm, although 80 percent of
those men lost their virginity
within their first year. "They're
probably just a little more anxious
to get it over with," said Cowell
