MOSCOW - Soviet KGB
agents yesterday arrested two
Stanford students traveling in the
Soviet Union as part of a two
week academic and cultural ex
change program, charging them
with "trafficking of illegal drugs,"
according to U.S. embassy offi
cials here.
The students were picked up
and taken away by an unmarked
KGB van as they left the apart
ment of Soviet dissident Nikolai
Gogol in Novosibirsk, Siberia.
Despite official complaints from
the State Department, Soviet of
ficials are refusing to release John
Pollack, 22, and Liz Perez, 21,
from Denisovich State Prison out
side of Novosibirsk.
Pollack, from Ann Arbor Mich.,
and Perez, from Fort Worth, Tex.,
were in Novosibirsk on a cultural
exchange program between Stan
ford and Novosibirsk State Uni
versity.
"We're doing all we can, but
the Soviets control the situation
right now," said U.S. Assistant
Vice Consul B.V. Hendricks, who
flew to Novosibirsk from Moscow
last night. Hendricks said she was
"not optimistic about a speedy
release" for the pair.
Soviet officials from the Mini
stry of Justice refused to elaborate
on the drug charges, saying only
that the students were carrying
a "large amount" of an un
specified illegal substance.
Surrounded by two 12-foot-high
electrified fences topped with
coiled razor wire, Denisovich
prison is considered the most se
cure penitentiary in the Soviet
Union. Customarily, only prison
ers of significant political impor
tance are detained there.
It is not known whether the

pair were actually carrying illegal
drugs at the time of their arrest,
but it is common practice for
Soviets to make such allegations
as a pretense for detention.
Another student traveling with
the Stanford group, Deborah Gil
man, denied that the two did any
thing illegal.
Group leader David Kang, also
a Stanford student, was less sure
of the pair's innocence. He said
the two had deviated from
planned activities more than once
during the trip, and that if they
were guilty of any wrong-doing,
they should be punished.
University President Donald
Kennedy flew to Washington last
night to be briefed by the State
Department on the matter. After
the briefing, he told reporters that
the students would probably be
released by the end of spring quar
ter.
"This [arrest] is a great oppor
tunity for Stanford students to
see what Soviet prison life is really
like. I really can't feel too sorry
for them," Kennedy said.
