STANFORD
Dean of Humanities & Sciences
The Search Committee for the position of Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences seeks nominations. Members of the Stanford
faculty, staff, and student body are invited to suggest candidates and/or
criteria for the Committee's consideration.
The School of Humanities and Sciences has 28 departments, more than
470 members of the professoriate, and over 4,069 graduate and
undergraduate students. As the chief academic officer of the School, the
Dean has a wide range of responsibilities relating to academic policies and
regulation, faculty appointments and promotions, budgets, and
administrative services.
Candidates must be either tenured faculty members at Stanford or
individuals whose record of achievement in research and teaching would
qualify them for a tenured appointment here. Experience as an academic
administrator is highly desirable. The Search Committee particularly
welcomes nominations/applications from women and members of ethnic
minority groups.
Suggestions should be sent before Friday, April 15, to the Search
Committee's staff, Jacyn Lewis, Bldg. 10.
