# University fights crawling caterpillars
## 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
As Stanford students move
outdoors, both to study and tan
during spring quarter, many
have found they must share the
outdoors with an increasing
number of moths and caterpil
lars.
In response to student com
plaints and out of concern for
some species of trees and bushes,
the University is waging war on
the pesky critters.
The Department of Opera
tions and Maintenance began
spraying at several sites around
campus last week, targeting tus
sock moths and oak moth cater
pillars.
Officials said the insects are
not only bothersome to people,
but also threaten several species
of plants on campus, including
coastal live oak trees and many
types of small trees and shrubs.

Spraying for these creatures
takes place once during the
spring and once during the sum
mer.
University Supervisor of
Grounds Herb Fong said timing
is critical in efforts to control
the moth and caterpillar popula
tions.
Fong said his department
monitors the populations of the
moths and caterpillars by
looking at branches periodically.
Some are also concerned about
the caterpillar and moth popu
lation encroaching upon outdoor
areas, such as Tresidder
Memorial Union, where food is
consumed.
Fong said when the insect
populations are too large, there
is a risk of the moths dropping
fecal matter on the diners below.
The same problem exists at
outdoor areas — like the Bow
man Alumni House — where
formal gatherings are held. Fong

said it was important to elimi
nate the moths and caterpillars
before they "decorated" alumni
and other people attending func
tions in those places.
Although some students ex
pressed worry about potential
harmful effects of the spray,
Fong said the spray being used
against the insects does not
harm humans or other animals.
The spray is a liquid combi
nation of water and bacillus
thuringiensis, a microorganism
that is ingested by the moth or
caterpillar and multiplies in its
stomach, eventually causing it
to starve.
Peter Kurtz of the California
State Department of Agriculture
confirmed Fong's statements
about the safety of the spray.
He said in his career as a
toxicologist he never saw "any
infections or bad effects" in
people who worked with or
around the liquid pest controller.

Some students voiced concern
about the spraying after their
residence officials informed
them they should close their
windows and bring in their bikes
during the early morning spray
ing.
Fong said his department in
formed student residences of the
spraying early and told students
to close their windows simply to
keep the spray out of their
rooms. He said the spray would
not hurt bicycles because the
bacteria has no effect on metals.
The spraying, which is done
between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m., began
last week on Athletic Depart
ment buildings. The following
areas are scheduled to be treated
this week and next week:
Florence Moore Hall, Stern Hall,
Wilbur Hall, Toyon Hall, Bran
ner Hall, Crothers Hall, Croth
ers Memorial Hall, the Row
houses and fraternity houses.
