Panama faces economic woes
PANAMA CITY, Panama — The military
dominated government of Panama opened
talks yesterday aimed at ending the country's
political stalemate, but only supporters of Gen.
Manuel Noriega showed up.
Called a "national dialogue" by Noriega's
government, the talks began as Panama limped
back to activity following a long Easter holiday
and a series of strikes that had shut down
most commerce for two weeks. Although many
stores and businesses in Panama City re
opened yesterday, it became clear that much
of Panama's trade and industry may not begin
operating soon for reasons that are as much
economic as political.
Diplomatic sources said that as many as
half of the foreign banks that operate in
Panama had shut down indefinitely, although
that could not be confirmed directly with bank
ers. Local Panamanian-owned banks remained
closed as bankers continued to resist govern
ment demands that they renew business on
a limited basis.
Shoppers stripped grocery store shelves of
basic items like soap, milk, flour and sugar.
The stores were not replacing the products
immediately, raising fears that a cash shortage
in Panama may soon turn into a shortage of
goods.
"The country is simply ceasing to function,"
said Ricardo Arias Calderon, head of the Chris
tian Democratic Party, a main opposition force.
Besides the paralysis of many factories and
businesses, schools are also closed.
Court upholds huge libel award
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yes
terday let stand the largest libel award in
American history, a $3 million judgment
against a Chicago television newsman who
falsely accused a tobacco company of employing
a secret strategy to lure young people into
smoking.
The verdict against CBS, Inc., and newsman
Walter Jacobson was four times larger than
any other libel award to win approval from
the federal appellate courts, according to the
Libel Defense Resource Center in New York.
The federal appeals courts repeatedly have
proven to be the last and best line of defense
for news organizations facing large libel ver
dicts. In 1964, the Supreme Court prohibited
libel awards except in instances where the
press demonstrated "actual malice" or a "reck
less disregard" for the truth in its reporting.
Since then, though juries have often voted
big judgments against the media, federal ap
peals courts have intervened to either throw
out the verdict or greatly reduce the damage
award.
"This is a record-setting award in all
respects, and we are depressed as hell," said
Henry Kaufman, general counsel for the Libel
Defense Resource Center in New York.
