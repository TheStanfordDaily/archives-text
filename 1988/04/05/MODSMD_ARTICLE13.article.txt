# Mecham guilty; stripped of office
## 
### 
PHOENIX, Ariz. — The Arizona Sen
ate convicted Gov. Evan Mecham of all
charges yesterday in the nation's first
such impeachment since 1929.
The feisty former Pontiac dealer lis
tened tight-lipped to the grim vote that
within 43 minutes stripped him of the
office he had pursued for 22 years.
"Well, they don't like my politics, so
we've finished a political trial," a
smiling Mecham told a crowd of sup
porters who cheered — some of them
with tears in their eyes — as he left
the Capitol.
The Senate voted 21-9 that the first
term Republican was guilty of obstruc
tion of justice and 26-4 that he had
misused public funds.
"Evan Mecham is convicted of high
crimes, misdemeanors or malfeasance
in office," State Supreme Court Justice

Frank Gordon Jr., the presiding officer,
said at the conclusion of the five-week
trial.
But the Senate voted 17-23 to leave
Mecham the option of seeking office
again.
Rose Mofford, the Democratic secre
tary of state, automatically became
governor pending next month's special
election.
"This is perhaps the most difficult
decision I have ever had to make in my
life," Sen. Lela Alston, a Phoenix Dem
ocrat, said in casting the first vote:
guilty.
Even some senators voting to acquit
the governor acknowledged that he
made serious mistakes during his
tumultuous year in office.
"I certainly would not want to hold
his administration up as a good model

for the future," said Sen. James Sos
saman, a Higley Republican who voted
in Mecham's favor.
But Sossaman argued that Mecham's
fate should be left to voters in the May
17 recall election.
Sen. Tony West, a Phoenix Republi
can, quoted extensively from a book
describing schizophrenic behavior as he
voted against Mecham.
"Your veracity and ethics particularly
in government are in a state of bank
ruptcy," West told Mecham, who looked
down at the table or straight ahead.
Not once did Mecham turn around
to face the senators, who needed a two
thirds majority on each count to convict.
All 11 Democrats delivered guilty ver
dicts on both charges, while the 19 Re
publicans split.
