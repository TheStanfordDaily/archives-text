# Shultz presses Mideast peace plan
## 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” Secretary of State
George Shultz, fighting for acceptance
of his Middle East peace plan, sought
yesterday to circumvent Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's hostility to
the plan's proposal for an interna
tional conference by focusing on sub
stance rather than procedures.
Shultz is here in an effort to revive
the Mideast peace process in the wake
of four months of violence by Pales
tinian inhabitants of Israeli-occupied
territories.
The secretary's talks yesterday took

place against a background of a general
strike and demonstrations in the ter
ritories protesting his presence. Israeli
troops in the West Bank shot and
killed an 18-year-old Palestinian, the
127 th Palestinian to die since the vi
olence began in December.
A senior U.S. official, who declined
to be identified, said that Shultz, in
his first full day of talks here, empha
sized "the overall package" and tried
to avoid past "excessive concentration
on the international conference."
Referring to the letter sent by Shultz

last month to Israeli and Arab leaders
with the outlines of the U.S. plan, the
official said Shultz reiterated yester
day that the United States will not
accept substantial changes in its
scheme for bringing about direct peace
talks between Israel and Jordan.
"But," the official added, "what he
did instead was say that the letter was
a skeleton. You can't dismember the
skeleton. But you've got to put the
flesh on the bones."
"There was movement on engage
ment with us on our overall proposi

tion," the official said. "It was not a
case of more arguing about the inter
national conference, which had popped
out like a jack in the box as a threat
to Israeli security."
That was a reference to the U.S.
plan's call for an international confer
ence including the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council
to serve as an umbrella for direct talks
between Israel and Jordan on the fu
ture status of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
