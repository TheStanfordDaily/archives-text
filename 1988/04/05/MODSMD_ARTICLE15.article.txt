# Dukakis takes early lead in Colorado

DENVER -
Massachusetts
Gov. Michael
Dukakis
jumped to an
early lead in
Colorado's Dem
ocratic presi
dential cau
cuses last
night, moving

ahead of the Rev. Jesse Jackson
in test precincts in almost
every region of the state.
Preliminary results released
by the state Democratic Party
showed Dukakis leading Jack
son solidly in county conven
tion delegates, but in a tight
race in the non-binding
"beauty contest" in about 70
pre-selected test precincts.
Despite a effort here,

a third Democratic candidate,
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr., barely registered support
in the preference poll or dele
gate selection.
On the Republican side, Vice
President George Bush contin
ued his steady march to the
nomination, easily swamping
rival Pat Robertson. With 83
precincts reporting, Bush had
more than 80 percent of the
vote, with less than 8 percent
for Robertson.
With more than 2,700 pre
cincts across the state, Demo
cratic Party officials chose 130
test precincts in the state's six
congressional districts for ini
tial reporting of results. Com
plete caucus results will take
two days, officials said.
