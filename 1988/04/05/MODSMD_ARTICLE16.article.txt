# Wisconsin too close to call

CUDAHY, Wise. — When Jesse Jackson
came to this blue-collar Milwaukee suburb
last week seeking support for his presiden
tial candidacy in today's Wisconsin pri
mary, about 700 townspeople came to hear
him. And when Jackson reminded them
that in their "hour of crisis" he had walked
the picket line at the strikebound Patrick
Cudahy meat packing plant, their cheers
seemed to rattle the rafters of St. Freder
ick's Catholic Church.
The ardor of the St. Frederick's audience
for Jackson underlines what Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis is up against as he
and Jackson struggle for the upper hand
in Wisconsin — a contest that is bound to
have profound impact on the rest of the
competition for the Democratic nomina
tion.
In a state where blacks account for only
about 3 percent of the voting-age popula
tion, it is commonly accepted that white
working-class and middle-class voters like
those who cheered at St. Frederick's hold
the balance of power. Jackson is bidding
for their support with soul-stirring rheto
ric. For hi 9 part, Dukakis' appeal is more
cerebral, depending mainly on the evidence
of his achievements in the Massachusetts

state house.
"I have no interest in being a great com
municator," Dukakis said in characteris
tically matter-of-fact fashion at a campaign
rally in Madison this week. "After seven
years of charisma, maybe a little com
petence in the White House would be a
good thing."
"We the people can make a difference,"
Jackson told the assemblage in St. Fred
erick's in typically portentous tones. "We
can. we will and we must."
The distinctions between these two con
tenders for the Democratic nomination are
more than stylistic. For Jackson's rumbling
rhetoric bears with it, however vaguely
implied, the promise of broad changes in
governmental policies at home and abroad.
Dukakis' approach to problem-solving —
while undeniably liberal in its acceptance
of the responsibilities of the federal gov
ernment — is, like his rhetoric, far milder
and moderate.
Thus the battle lines have been drawn
here between these two Democratic leaders.
And on the eve of the vote, polls and pun
dits agree, the outcome is too close to call.
