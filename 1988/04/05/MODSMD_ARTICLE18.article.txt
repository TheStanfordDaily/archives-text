## Upgrade facilities 
### 
Although some students
will never go to the Olympics
or even run a five minute
mile, all members of the Stanford
community who want to exercise
are entitled to suitable facilities
but have yet to receive them.
The University was slow in
recognizing the need for more ath
letic facilities for the general com
munity. Students will have to wait
at least three years before they
can enjoy the benefits of the Uni
versity's plans for East and West
Campus athletics recreational
facilities — after most of the cur
rent undergraduates will be gone.
Until then, students must contend
with the following problems:
• Not enough weights. Any stu
dent who does not participate in
an organized sport has to contend
with the horrors of Encina Gym
— a facility hardly suited for the
needs of all of the weightlifters on
campus. Roble Gym does not even
have free weights. Hopefully the
new West Campus facility, in
tended to replace much of the
Roble facilities, will remedy this
shortage, but in the interim it
would be fairly easy for the Uni
versity to at least purchase free
weights for Roble Gym.
• Inadequate pool facilities. Stan
ford's two student pools are
dominated by classes and varsity
athletic teams. Those wishing to
do some laps in de Guerre must
confront crowded swim lanes be
cause the pool is only open during
meal hours on weekdays and for
public swim on the weekends. Ob
viously Roble Pool is not big
enough to handle de Guerre's over
flow. The West Campus plan for
a 51-meter pool will help alleviate
the present need for more swim
time. But in the meantime, hours
should be extended if at all possi
ble.
• Poor basketball courts. Students
wishing to play hoops outside are

challenged by rough asphalt courts
whose rims lack nets and that des
perately need repaying. Maples Pa
vilion and Roble Gym do not ac
comodate the many groups of stu
dents wishing to shoot some bas
kets.
The East Campus project will
reconvert Old Pavillion into a gym,
adding three basketball courts for
intramural sports. It's too bad that
current students won't be able to
enjoy these facilities before they
graduate. For now, the University
should repave the outdoor basket
ball courts that are in disrepair
and put nets in where they are
missing.
• Tennis courts without lights.
The courts completed this October
as the initial phase of the the Near
West Quadrangle project are great
. . . except they don't have lights.
Currently, courts are difficult to
schedule, and added nighttime play
would make the game more acces
sible for students.
The University has failed stu
dents in this area: Tennis Coach
Dick Gould, relying on private
funds, was forced to initiate plans
on his own in order to renovate
the Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The University should take im
mediate steps to put lights up at
its tennis courts.
These recommendations are
short-term measures to help ad
dress the athletic facility shortage
here, but they should be taken
seriously. Current students need
better facilities now, not in the
next decade.
Until the Quadrangle is com
pleted, students attending one of
the country's largest campuses,
which has arguably more financial
resources than most other univer
sities, will have to be content with
inadequate athletic facilities. The
least the University should do is
make the existing facilities more
usable.
