# D.C. campus hits snag
## Students to live and learn in unfinished building 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
As cherry blossoms start to
bloom this spring in Washington,
D.C., Stanford students were sup
posed to be arriving at their new
campus there.
The blossoms bloomed on time.
The 12 Stanford students arrived
on schedule. The building isn't
quite flninshed.
Though some students were in
itially concerned at the amount
of work that remains to be done
on the building, most said they
felt excited about their unfinished
surroundings.
Yet, Political Science Prof. Da
vid Danelski, director of the pro
gram, said he "wish(es) things
were a little bit farther along."
The incomplete areas include the
building's lobby, main seminar
room and kitchen.
Danelski said many factors con
tributed to the remodeling delay,
including the complex permit
process required by local govern
ment and the time spent working
with the architect who planned
the remodeling.
According to sophomore Leslie
Saul, "despite the problems with
the building, everything is going
well."
Though some students, and

Danelski himself, are not living
in their permanent rooms, the
living conditions are more than
adequate, he said. "The areas
where we have the programs are
in great shape," he added.
The students did not arrive un
aware of the state of the Wash
ington facility. Danelski returned
to Stanford in February to explain
the situation to the students.
According to Public Service
Center Director Catherine Milton,
who coordinates the program, she
and Danelski "gave the students
options of delaying (their enroll
ment) if they wanted to." Stu
dents would have been assured a
spot in the fall program, but all
12 decided to attend in spring.
The unfinished building was "a
big deal the first day I got here,"
said student Catherine Zerboni,
who now says she is very happy
with her situation. Danelski again
gave students the option to return
home after they arrived, but all
of the students again decided to
remain.
The lack of a kitchen facility
has forced the University to con
tract with a nearby restaurant to
bring in food for the students and
staff. Far from causing problems,
the nightly meals cooked by a chef
inspired rave, reviews from Zer
boni.

In contrast to problems with
the facilities, Danelski said the
academic program "got off to a
very good start." The curriculum
includes group seminars, small
tutorials of two to three students
and internships in government of
fices.
Danelski said he is particularly
pleased with the quality of the
program's tutors, which includes
several former Rhodes scholars.
The student internships include
working in the office of Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., the Office of
Management and Budget, and the
office of the Securities Exchange
Commissioner. Aldi Lau, a stu
dent working for the U.S. trade
representative, praised Danelski
for "a really excellent job in find
ing us substantive internships."
Although he has been working
"24 hour days" since Nov. 1,
Danelski said he has made an ef
fort to tap resources of the 4,000
to 5,000 Stanford alumni in the
D.C. area.
Over the winter, Danelski wrote
a letter to all of the alumni notify
ing them of the new program and
inviting them to the May 16
opening ceremony. He and a team
of alumni are in the process of
setting up a "network of alumni
who will be support for recent
graduates."
