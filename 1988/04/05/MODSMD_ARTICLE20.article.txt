## A
						struggle for respect 
### 
WHEN I'M IN NEED of inspira
tion or encouragement, I often
listen to a favorite song of mine
by Aretha Franklin called, "Respect." The
lyrics by themselves are not particularly
profound, "R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what
it means to me, R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care
T-C-B," but when they are combined with
the beat of the music and the force of
Franklin's voice, the message and the
power of the song are compelling. When
Aretha tells you she's got to have it, you
believe.
Perhaps, though, the most significant
reason that I find this song so uplifting
is that, at the risk of sounding trite, I
identify Aretha's cries for respect with
the struggle for respect that all women
face.
Women's position in society may have
greatly improved in the last decades, but
thousands of years of male dominance
plus an inadequate number of female
role models aren't easy obstacles to over
come.
Moreover, advertising and television
plague women with images of themselves
as befuddled, empty-headed twits unable,
for example, to make even the most
elementary decisions about laundry
detergent.
This has only served to reinforce un
conscious societal views of women as silly,
whimsical creatures who haven't the logic
or tenacity to be trusted with important
tasks.
The continuous bombardment of nega
tive images without a sufficient counter

balance of positive images has created a
"psychology of doubt" among women.
Not only have we not been able to capture
the full confidence of the opposite sex,
but as a group we haven't learned to
respect ourselves.
Though many people won't find my
contention obvious at all, there are a
multitude of examples on both a large
societal scale and here at Stanford to
support such a hypothesis.
After the disastrous defeat of Mon
dale/Ferraro in 1984, Maureen Dowd, a
New York Times reporter, did an infor
mal survey asking women, who as a group
percentage-wise had not supported the
Democratic ticket, what caused them to
shift their votes to the Republicans.
A housewife from Bristol, Tenn.,
summed up the jist of the reporter's find
ings when she said, "I put myself in her
shoes. Could I sit down and logically
make decisions for everybody without
cracking up? I think women in general
are [tool weak [for that]."
A similar breakdown of public trust
can be witnessed on the national news
programs. The anchors for all three net
work nightly news programs are male,
as are a majority of any panel on the
serious Sunday morning talk shows.
Why is this? It is the same reason that
the "hard" news on the network morning
shows is invariably delegated to the men,
while the women handle the "soft" news:
Despite the contrariness of any statistical
evidence, T.V. audiences prefer male
anchors because they believe them to be

more trustworthy than their female
counterparts.
The "psychology of doubt" doesn't just
affect housewives in Tenn. or T.V.
audiences. In our own community I have
run across several instances where
women unsure of their own capabilities
have come to deny the respectability of
the whole female community.
Last year a friend of mine, a capable
hard-working woman with good grades
to show for her efforts, confided that
though she hated to admit it, "Men are
just smarter then we are."
Though this is the only close friend I
can recall having had such a conversation
with, comments made to me by other
women, even if only jokingly, have led
me to believe this is not an uncommon
sentiment at Stanford; though it is one,
I am absolutely sure, that is undeserved.
If women are to really succeed in the
business world or simply live happily with
ourselves, we've got to have it, and we
have got to believe that we deserve it.
"R-E-S-P-E-C-T, sock it to me, sock it
to me."
