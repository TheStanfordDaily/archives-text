## Dollies' sexist name degrading to campus women 
### 
IT WAS VERY interesting and
educational for me when I read
several times over the last aca
demic year of the change in Stanford's
team name from the Indians to the
Cardinal. Although I would not ini
tially have found the name Indians to
be offensive, on reflection I saw a
point.
Just think of some of the team
names in football and basketball. Who
wouldn't object to being associated
with foot coverings of various colors,
letters and numbers, animals of as
sorted species, large unspecified crea
tures and other such distinguished
mascots? This may not have been the
exact objection made at the time, but
it certainly captures the essence of the

problem.
Also enlightening to me has been the
recently concluded debate on the West
ern Culture curriculum. One of the
points made by proponents of change
was that women weren't well repre
sented on the reading list, thereby
ignoring the full contributions of
women to our culture. Being a member
of the ignored sex, I immediately
understood the dismissive nature of
the omission and its insulting tone.
In view of the above, I am at a
complete loss to comprehend why a
university and student body with such
concern for fair and equal treatment of
women and minorities would coun
tenance a "performing" group named
for childhood toys and sexist childhood

toys at that.
After all, the Dollies can't claim that
their name inspires anyone to respect
them or admire their maturity. A
reasonable conclusion given the nature
of the group is that they don't want to
inspire these reactions, which is fair
enough. Respect and maturity are not
exactly necessary components of sport
ing events.
But can anyone really mean to
associate themselves with the images
behind the name "Dollies?" There is,
for instance, the anatomically mutant,
double-projectile (a la Joe Bob Briggs)
version typified by Barbie and gang,
the soft and spineless version of the
rag doll and the cutie-pie kind that
wets on command and repeats

meaningless phrases when poked in
the right place.
Exactly which type are the Stanford
Dollies supposed to represent? Perhaps
a cross between the first and the last,
because of their short skirts and fixed
smiles, with a dash of the second,
because they allow themselves to be
labeled (publicly and in print), Dollies.
And the most stunning thing of all is
that this is done voluntarily.
If the student body here is really
concerned with equal and fair treat
ment of women, I suggest they take a
good, hard look in their own backyard.
There are plenty of opportunities for
improvement.
