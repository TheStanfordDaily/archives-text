# Rent control isn't solution for EPA
## 
### 
I was pleased to hear that Stanford
students are taking an interest in East
Palo Alto. It is commendable that stu
dents are giving their time to enlighten
the disenfranchised constituents of this
city.
However, I find it regrettable that
students have allowed a single candi
date and issue to be their sole motiva
tion for this newly realized political
conscioussness.
It was indeed shrewd politics for
Ruben Abrica, a member of the East
Palo Alto city council, to place a rent
control measure on the ballot when he
is due for re-election.
I agree that affordable housing is a
paramount concern for every Califor
nian. I do remember living on a
budget governed by the financial aid
department.
But students shouldn't let the false
hope of fixed rents, fixed property

values and no inflation obscure their
vision of the real problems facing this
community: drugs, unemployment,
inadequate education and inept fiscal
management.
Before the election, educate your
selves by attending a council meeting.
Examine the record of those in office
who allowed this city to slip into eco
nomic crisis without their notice.
Observe how the cuts in police have
affected the attitude of the drug users
until they feel this is their city.
When you vote on April 12, consider
all the issues â€” not just rent control.
