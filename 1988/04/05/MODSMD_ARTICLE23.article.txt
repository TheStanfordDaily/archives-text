# Better health is a campus concern
## 
### 
I am writing to express my apprecia
tion to all those students who attended
the introductory meeting of the "Opti
mal Health and Fitness" course and to
state my regret that I was unable to

admit all those students with a
genuine interest in improving their
health.
The fact that 650 Stanford students
attended this meeting is both a tribute
to them and a message to the Univer
sity that more opportunities for health
improvement should exist for students
within the academic structure.
