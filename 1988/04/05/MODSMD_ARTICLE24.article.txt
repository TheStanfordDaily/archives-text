# CIV requirement subordinates works
## 
### 
The Daily's April 1 account of the
CIV debate said that I shocked the
Faculty Senate by suggesting eliminat
ing the clause requiring the study of
works by women, minorities and per
sons of color, because, according to the
article, this was the heart of CIV.
I take exception to this characteriza
tion. The heart of CIV may be the
requirement that "substantial attention
be given to the issues of race, gender
and class each quarter." To this re-

quirement I have never objected.
This requirement, in itself, is suffi
cient to cause works by women, minor
ities and persons of color to be read
because they will, in most causes, be
the best authorities on the issue.
By explicitly requiring these read
ings, we make them suspect of being
inferior readings. Why else did we have
to require them?
I did not expect the senate to sup
port my view, but I raised the issue
because I thought it is an important
issue for Stanford students to ponder.
