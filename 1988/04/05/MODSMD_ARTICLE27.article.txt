## Israel and South Africa dissimilar 
### 
SO MANY PEOPLE incorrectly
equate Israel with South Africa,
and television news repeats it,
that 1 would like to make the following
observations.
Israel is a genuine democracy: one
person one vote; all citizens, regardless
of race, sex, color or creed, are equal
before the law as stated in Israel's
Declaration of Independence. Any
comparison with the apartheid regime
in South Africa is contrived and mis
leading.
These are typical statements one
hears from those making this illegiti
mate analogy:
Claim: "The Israeli and the South
African governments have one thing
undeniably in common: They both rule
over large populations which have
inferior status."
Answer: The South African govern
ment represents a small white minor
ity ruling over a large majority within
its own national borders.
The government of Israel, on the
other hand, within its own national
borders, rules over a population which
is 83 percent Jewish and 17 percent
Arab, all all of whom enjoy equal
rights.
The political disabilities of the Arabs
living in the Israel-administered ter
ritories derive from the fact that they
are not citizens of Israel, because
Israel, adhering to the Camp David
Accords and to international law, has
not made these territories part of

Israel.
Claim: "A majority in Gaza and the
West Bank live in refugee camps where
conditions are bad but where some
services have improved during the
Israeli occupation."
Answer: Most Gaza and West Bank
Palestinians live in towns and villages
where life has improved under the
Israelis.
But the refugees have been living in
camps ever since the Egyptian army
and four other Arab armies invaded
Israel in May 1948, and Egypt cap
tured the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians
and Jordanians kept the refugees in
the camps for nearly 20 years and did
nothing to ameliorate their plight.
After Israel repulsed the 1967 attack
of the Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian
armies, the settled population and
refugees of the West Bank and Gaza
came under Israeli control.
In 1971 Israel offered alternate and
greatly improved housing to the refu
gees. About 10,000 refugee families
(some 50,000 persons) responded and
left the camps, to be resettled in new
housing. But the PLO began to inter
vene and, in large measure, managed
to put a stop to this movement.
Together with the Arab states, it
also railroaded a resolution through
the UN General Assembly condemning
Israel for what it had done and calling
on Israel to send those people back
into the camps!
Claim: "Palestinians in the territories

must carry identity cards."
Answer: Every Israeli, Jew and Arab,
and everyone under Israeli jurisdiction,
must carry an ID card.
There is nothing unusual or discrim
inatory in Palestinian Arabs in the
territories having to carry ID cards.
The unstated but evident implication
that these ID cards are somehow
comparable to the special passbooks
that used to be required for South
African blacks is misleading.
Claim: "In general, Palestinians can be
detained for six months without trial.
They are subject to military not civil
ian courts and as such have no rights
to appeal convictions."
Answer: Nobody in the territories is
simply "detained without trial." Ad
ministrative detention is applied only
after a court hearing (within 96 hours
of the arrest) at which the judge may
confirm, cancel or shorten the deten
tion.
The judge must be satisfied that the
detention is only for the public securi
ty, and the matter is reviewed every
three months. All this is in accordance
with the prior Jordanian law, as stip
ulated in the Geneva Convention; and
so is the fact that those arrested "are
subject to military not civilian courts".
But all residents of the territories
have the right to petition Israel's
Supreme Court sitting as the High
Court of Justice. In fact, the courts
have in the past overturned govern
ment decisions and decisions of the

military government of the occupied
areas.
Claim: "The 1.4 million Palestinians in
the occupied territories have no vote,
no say in Israeli politics."
Answer: Of course the Palestinian
Arabs in the territories "have no vote,
no say in Israeli politics" â€” seeing
that they are not Israeli citizens, and
the territories are not part of Israel!
But the 750,000 Arabs living in
Israel itself are full citizens with
voting rights and elected representa
tives in the Knesset (Legislature).
Three non-Jews (two Druze and one
Arab) have served in Israel's diplo
matic corps; an Arab serves today as
Israel's Consul-General in Atlanta. And
there are six Druze brigade com
manders in the Israel Defense Forces.

In short, no democracy is without its
shortcomings. Racial and ethnic con
flicts are endemic to the world and can
even be found in democratic countries
like the United States.
It, therefore, serves no meaningful
political or educational purpose to draw
"similarities" between the ethnic ten
sion which can arise in any healthy
democratic system and the enthrone
ment of race as the basis of law and
social organization, as was done in
Nazi Germany or as is presently done
in South Africa.
We and the media should clarify
rather than cloud issues for the ad
vancement of a more constructive
understanding of world events.
