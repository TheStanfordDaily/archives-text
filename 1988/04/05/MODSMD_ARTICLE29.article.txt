## The 						bug bares truth of driving with naked feet 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
Sorority rush season has
returned once again with a ven
geance. This is the time of year
when mature women who scored
dual 800s on the SAT inexplicably
feel the need to congregate in
lounges and sing songs with lyrics
like:
"We are delta pi,"
"We are delta pi,"
"We love delta pi."
"We love delta pi."

These songs usually go hand in
hand with "sorority skits." Men,
under no condition should you al
low yourself to be coerced into
performing in one of these skits.
They have titles like "Why I Have
Fun In My Sorority" and are de
signed to discourage the sane
from joining.
But please don't get the idea
that I have anything against
sororities. In fact, I am very im
pressed by the way potential
pledges are handled during Rush.
One of the women in my dorm is
a "Rush counselor." Her job is to
answer potential rushees' ques
tions such as "What to wear" or
"Why are those girls over there
doing that stupid skit?"
Rush counselors are not al
lowed to reveal what sorority they
are actually in, and can only say
things such as "I can't tell you
what my sorority is, but let me
say that I love those stains on
your sweater that seem to form
three triangles in a row."

Most royal dung beetle,
I have a pressing question to
ask you. Last week, as I was
driving to San Jose I decided to
remove my shoes as I felt much
more comfortable without them.
However, the friend that I was
with told me that driving without
shoes was illegal. Please tell me,
am I disobeying all the great laws
of the state of California? What
if I drive to Las Vegas? Is it illegal
there? If so, what is really a shoe?
How will Mr. Policeman know?
What is the fine? I always thought
that I was a law-abiding citizen.
Help!!
— More comfy with sox
Give me a break! All the great
mysteries of the universe lie
temptingly out there just beyond
our reach, and you want to know
what is really a shoe? Wow, if
Tom Edison had been blessed
with your curiosity we'd ail live
in houses illuminated by burning
sandals.
In fact, this driving without
shoes nonsense is one of those
Great Myths Of The 20th Cen
tury, falling into the same cate
gory as "You get automatic
straight-A's if your roommate
dies" or "Top-40 music doesn't
cause brain damage."
"In order to field-test this ques
tion properly, I drove during
Spring break from California to
Oregon in my bare feet. Net result:
One ticket for "Failure to main
tain a single lane of traffic" —
perhaps the stupidest traffic in
fraction in the history of the world
— and no problems with driving
barefoot. Then again, it's not like
the highway patrol have a radar
gun which can tell:
Me: "Is there a problem offi
cer?"
Officer: "Yeah, son, this here
radar gun clocked you driving in

Turning to the authorities, the

I hope this changes a few lives.
The CHP officers say that they
remember being cited when they
were kids for driving barefoot, but
the law has since been repealed.
The original motive behind the
law was that it was more difficult
to brake suddenly in bare feet.
Presumably, as nutrition has im
proved in this country, our feet
have become better adapted to
driving. Perhaps Charles Darwin
was right when he said, "Don't
call me Chuck."

under the headline:
"Half Naked Florida Prosecuter
and her Co-Worker Resign."
The story, from Bradenton,
Fla., begins, "A female prosecuter
who was arrested while driving
naked below the waist has
resigned, as has the male
prosecuter who was riding with
her."
This, I realize, is pretty irrele

can't help but wonder whether
she would have been arrested had

she been wearing shoes?!?
Dear Bug Me,
During finals week last quarter
I spent many late hours at Green
Library. When exiting, my back
pack was always checked and I
was always counted with those
nifty clickers. But I already be
came a statistic on the way in.
Why does Green count everybody
who goes in and everybody who
goes out? If these numbers don't
match at the end of the day is
there a library-wide person hunt?
Is it easy to spend the night in
Green ? If I try, what will happen
to me? Have others so daring as
I already tried?
— Sleeping with Archimides
Let's take your questions in or
der, Sleepy. First of all, those
"nifty clickers" aren't supposed
to match at the end of the day
because not everybody in the li
brary has to enter and exit
through those gates. A library em
ployee can, for example, enter
through the little gates — click
— and exit through a side em
ployee door — no click. It is plain
to see that the numbers are not
going to match.

The clickers are, in fact, used
for statistical purposes. Each hour
the number of patrons — cool
library euphemism for "Idiots
who come in and move books
around to where they don't
belong" — entering and exiting
the library is recorded. This al
lows the library to know during
which hours they will need more
staff to handle the added flow of
people, and also when to change
the "Over 5,000,000 Served" sign.
As for part two of your ques
tion, go ahead, try to spend the
night in Green. What will happen,
as far as I am able to ascertain,
is that the police will come and
haul you off to jail.
In case you've never been in
Green around closing time, they
make a rather threatening an
nouncement to the effect that stu
dents should all get out or risk
prosecution for trespassing. Back
ing up this threat is a nifty, high
tech motion and sound detector
which, when tripped, sets off a
silent alarm. Soon after the alarm
is tripped the police will come,
arrest you for trespassing, and
take you to a holding tank where
you'll meet Icky Intoxicated
People.

According to library press rep
resentatives, several people have
tried to spend the night in Green.
They were caught and arrested.
But, you say, what happens if
I accidently fall asleep before
closing time and am not awakened
by the closing announcements
over the intercom? Fear not, be
cause every day at closing time
the library staff walk through the
entire stacks, turning off lights
and searching for sleeping and
hiding patrons.
If, for some reason, you find
yourself locked in Green after
everyone has left, Stack Supervi
sor Walt Baluta suggests you
proceed to the nearest phone —
there are some at the Loan Desk
— and call the police before they
come and find you.
Dear Bug Me,

stipated? This was a major debate

Yes, but you can combat this
by remembering to take the plas
tic wrapper off before you eat it.

Sorority rush season has
returned once again with a ven
geance. This is the time of year
when mature women who scored
dual 800s on the SAT inexplicably
feel the need to congregate in
lounges and sing songs with lyrics
like:
"We are delta pi,"
"We are delta pi,"
"We love delta pi."
"We love delta pi."

These songs usually go hand in
hand with "sorority skits." Men,
under no condition should you al
low yourself to be coerced into
performing in one of these skits.
They have titles like "Why I Have
Fun In My Sorority" and are de
signed to discourage the sane
from joining.
But please don't get the idea
that I have anything against
sororities. In fact, I am very im
pressed by the way potential
pledges are handled during Rush.
One of the women in my dorm is
a "Rush counselor." Her job is to
answer potential rushees' ques
tions such as "What to wear" or
"Why are those girls over there
doing that stupid skit?"
Rush counselors are not al
lowed to reveal what sorority they
are actually in, and can only say
things such as "I can't tell you
what my sorority is, but let me
say that I love those stains on
your sweater that seem to form
three triangles in a row."

Most royal dung beetle,
I have a pressing question to
ask you. Last week, as I was
driving to San Jose I decided to
remove my shoes as I felt much
more comfortable without them.
However, the friend that I was
with told me that driving without
shoes was illegal. Please tell me,
am I disobeying all the great laws
of the state of California? What
if I drive to Las Vegas? Is it illegal
there? If so, what is really a shoe?
How will Mr. Policeman know?
What is the fine? I always thought
that I was a law-abiding citizen.
Help!!
— More comfy with sox
Give me a break! All the great
mysteries of the universe lie
temptingly out there just beyond
our reach, and you want to know
what is really a shoe? Wow, if
Tom Edison had been blessed
with your curiosity we'd ail live
in houses illuminated by burning
sandals.
In fact, this driving without
shoes nonsense is one of those
Great Myths Of The 20th Cen
tury, falling into the same cate
gory as "You get automatic
straight-A's if your roommate
dies" or "Top-40 music doesn't

"In order to field-test this ques

Spring break from California to

law was that it was more difficult

Dear Bug Me,
During finals week last quarter
I spent many late hours at Green
Library. When exiting, my back
pack was always checked and I
was always counted with those
nifty clickers. But I already be
came a statistic on the way in.
Why does Green count everybody
who goes in and everybody who
goes out? If these numbers don't
match at the end of the day is
there a library-wide person hunt?
Is it easy to spend the night in
Green ? If I try, what will happen
to me? Have others so daring as
I already tried?
— Sleeping with Archimides
Let's take your questions in or
der, Sleepy. First of all, those
"nifty clickers" aren't supposed
to match at the end of the day
because not everybody in the li
brary has to enter and exit
through those gates. A library em
ployee can, for example, enter
through the little gates — click
— and exit through a side em
ployee door — no click. It is plain
to see that the numbers are not
going to match.

The clickers are, in fact, used
for statistical purposes. Each hour
the number of patrons — cool
library euphemism for "Idiots
who come in and move books
around to where they don't
belong" — entering and exiting
the library is recorded. This al
lows the library to know during
which hours they will need more
staff to handle the added flow of
