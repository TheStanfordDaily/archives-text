# Fraternities act to enforce Rush regulations
## 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
With Rush getting underway and the
Greek system at Stanford battling a
serious image problem, fraternity officials
are promising strict enforcement of Rush
regulations.
"We're going to hit you hard if you
don't abide," Interfraternity Council
President Vinny Frost warned fraternity
leaders at the last IFC meeting March 2.
Indeed, Frost knows as well as any
fraternity leader that the fraternal sys
tem he directs will be watched more
closely than ever during this year's Rush
activities, which started last night and
will continue for three weeks.
While the IFC has left the structure
of this year's activities unchanged, it has
taken steps to enforce Rush guidelines

in order to change the system's negative
image on campus.
Before 1980, there were few docu
mented behavioral problems involving
fraternities, according to a recently re
leased report on fraterities. But since
that time the number and seriousness of
problems have greatly increased and com
munity attention to abuses within the
fraternal system has intensified accord
ingly.
• 1980-1984: The University docu
ments 46 fraternal behavioral problems.
• 1985-1986: After a series of miscon
duct problems — including the throwing
of a burning couch out of a window —
the Delta Upsilon fraternity is banned
from campus.
• 1986-1987: Junior David Dunshee, a
Zeta Psi member, drowns in Lake
Lagunita after a Rush party at the Boat

house.
• 1987-1988: The Report of the Task
Force on Fraternities is released, recom
mending that fraternities using subjec
tive selection procedures be removed
from University housing. Also, after
much debate, the IFC votes to continue
to serve alcohol during Rush despite pres
sure from the University, although the
second of the three-week process will be
dry.
Although the Rush piocess has been
scrutinized since it began here in 1892,
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano said
he believes it will "get a little more at
tention this year." Pisano said the Uni
versity and students will "be looking to
see how well the IFC minimizes risks
and handles the problems normally as
sociated with Rush."
Most notably, this year the IFC has

decided to police the entire Rush system
to ensure that restrictions are enforced.
While members onlv spot-checked parties
on an irregular basis in past years, this
spring members of the IFC Executive
Committee will monitor all parties at all
times, Pisano said.
One of the committee members' main
goals will be to ensure that fraternities
close their open-house parties by 11:30
p.m. This rule was installed in past years
to prevent disturbances that have ocurred
after rushees returned to their residences
late at night.
The IFC decided to step up control of
these events because fraternities have not
fully adhered to the 11:30 p.m. closure
rule in the past.
The IFC will also try to monitor the
system's controversial alcohol policy,
which also remains unchanged from last

year. The policy dictates that only beer
and wine will be served at Rush parties
during the first week, no alcohol will be
served during the second week, and any
drink may be served during the third
week.
Aside from its increased role as an
enforcer, IFC has taken several steps to
help rushees decide which fraternities —
if any — are best for them.
After an absence of one year, the IFC
has brought back the Fraternity Rush
book. The 60-page book, which was not
published last year because IFC leaders
felt it had not adequately represented
fraternities, contains a statement from
each fraternity about its goals and char
acteristics.
The IFC has also distributed a short
"Rushee's Guide to Stanford
Fraternal Organizations" and
other handouts containing spe
cific details of each fraternity.
IFC Vice President Stuart Levy
said the IFC understands the im
portance of the pledge decision.
"We're just trying to give students
as much information as possible
so they can make an informed
decision," he said. "We decided to
spend the money on the Rushbook

for that reason."
The IFC also hosted an in
formational meeting for prospec
tive rushees Wednesday night.
Here, too, the meeting focused on
the decision-making process.
Frost told those attending that
although Rush "is kind of a big
party, it's also a big decision
making time."
Robert Hamrdla, president of
the Alumni Interfraternity Coun
cil, told students that they
shouldn't join fraternities because
they received poor Draw numbers
in their bid for University
housing.

each fraternity about its goals and char
acteristics.
The IFC has also distributed a short
"Rushee's Guide to Stanford
Fraternal Organizations" and
other handouts containing spe
cific details of each fraternity.
IFC Vice President Stuart Levy
said the IFC understands the im
portance of the pledge decision.
"We're just trying to give students
as much information as possible
so they can make an informed
decision," he said. "We decided to
spend the money on the Rushbook

for that reason."
The IFC also hosted an in
formational meeting for prospec
tive rushees Wednesday night.
Here, too, the meeting focused on
the decision-making process.
Frost told those attending that
although Rush "is kind of a big
party, it's also a big decision
making time."
Robert Hamrdla, president of
the Alumni Interfraternity Coun
cil, told students that they
shouldn't join fraternities because
they received poor Draw numbers
in their bid for University
housing.
