# Humanity scholars indulge in intellect at campus center
## 
### Todd Pierce Staff writer 
In Rogers and Mariposa Houses
near the center of campus, 30
committed humanist scholars are
quietly pioneering the post
modern intellectual frontier.
The Victorian houses, located
behind the Row, furnish research
ers at the Stanford Humanities
Center with a working environ
ment that is far more conducive
to intellectual contemplation than
Meyer Library.
Established in 1982, the Hu
manities Center is now a main
research center for 20 professors
and 10 graduate students study
ing English, History, French, Art,
religious studies and other disci
plines from the Humanities.
Each year approximately 14
professors are awarded one-year
fellowships. The Center usually
selects eight professors from other
universities and reserves six
places for Stanford professors
who desire a more secluded envi
ronment within the University to
pursue their research.
In addition, the Center also
awards eight paid graduate fel
lowships to Stanford students
doing advanced study in the hu
manities.
The fellowships are highly com
petitive, according to Morton
Sosna, associate director for the
Center. Last year 208 applicants
vied for one of the eight spots
awarded to faculty not affiliated
with Stanford.
The Center is not only a re
search facility but a place of in
tellectual discourse where fellows
often exchange ideas with
scholars in disciplines different
from their own.
"We wanted to encourage inter-

disciplinary studies within the hu
manities. ... There was a sense
that some of the boundaries be
tween the disciplines were becom
ing more blurred," Sosna said.
"The Humanities Center is often
a place where people from literary
fields look for context and people
from historical backgrounds look
for textuaiity."
Sosna went on to point out that
"it is not uncommon for a histo
rian interested in early modern
Europe to borrow an anthropo
logical approach like kinship the
ory and apply it to elite families
in Renaissance Italy."
Humanities Center fellows
"pick up a lot of things through
osmosis," according to Bliss Car
nochan, director of the Center.
English Prof. Mary Wack
praised how the Center gave her
the seclusion she needed for re
search while allowing her to main
tain contact with other academics.
"(The Center) freed me up from
teaching so I could spend a year
on writing. Meeting for lunch
every day (with other scholars)
and for talks every week made it
a most productive atmos
phere,"said Wack, a medieval spe
cialist.
Carnochan pointed out that al
though scientific centers in this

country have long approached re
search with a cooperative atti
tude, scholarship in the humani
ties was traditionally more
solitary. The first humanities
"lab," the National Humanities
Center, located at Research Tri
angle Park in North Carolina, was
not opened until 1978.
In the mid-70s "there was a
growing sense that scholars in dif
ferent fields needed to be in touch
with each other," and the North
Carolina Center became quite a
success, according to Sosna.
Consequently, humanities
centers were developed at UC-
Berkeley, UC-Santa Clara and
Oregon State. There are now
more than 40 humanities centers
in the country, Sosna estimated.
Although fellows spend the
majority of their time in research,
Sosna stressed that the Center is
"not an ivory tower. ... It re
moves people from defined duties
but it doesn't lock them away."
Scholars at the Center are re
quired to use one-sixth of their
time making an intellectual con
tribution to the University. Many
spend their time teaching classes
in their field of specialty. Stanford
students reap the benefits of their
teaching, taking classes with
scholars who are often world
renowned.
In the last 10 to 15 years, fac
ulty members in the humanities
"have been hired at a much lower
rate" Sosna said. The fellows from
the Humanites Center "would not
otherwise be here" and their pres
ence makes for a more diverse
curriculum, he said.
The Center's work is most
visible in the conferences held for
the public and University faculty.
Previous conferences included
"Humans, Animals, Machines:

Boundaries and Projections" and
"Talking Terrorism: Ideologies
and Paradigms in a Postmodern
World."
Experts from around the world
as well as Stanford students and
faculty attend these conferences
held once or twice a year. Aca
demic departments often work
with the Center on planning and
coordinating the conferences.
"Since 1984 we've done at least

one conference a year and
more with other departments. By
and large the subjects have been
broad themes that would to some
extent interest the non
specialist," Sosna said.
Italian Prof. Beverly Allen,
planned Ferbruary's Terorism
Conference that brought academ
ics, government officials and jour
nalists to a public forum discuss
ing the definition of terrorism.

While at the Center last year,
Allen researched representation
of terrorism in Italian literature.
She praised the "informal" yet
"very intellectual environment."
"I think one of the very best
things about (the Center) was the
chance to talk to people in a non
hierarchical way. It was wonder
ful to get to know graduate stu
dents and make friends with
senior faculty," Allen said.
