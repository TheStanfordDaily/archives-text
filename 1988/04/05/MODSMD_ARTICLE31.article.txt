## Netters serve up wins over UCLA, USC 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
Sparked by high-caliber dou
bles play, the Stanford tennis
team clawed past UCLA 5-3
Friday and No. 2 USC 6-3 Sat
urday before near-capacity
crowds at Stanford Tennis
Stadium. But the lineup that

looked so invincible with the return of fresh
man David Wheaton unexpectedly wasn't.
"USC showed me they really have the
makings of a championship team," Gould said.
"I was impressed with the way USC reacted
in front of our crowd; they are mentally so
much tougher than last year."
"I hope no one on our team is satisfied.
Until we develop that guttiness and character
out on the court, we can't be listed as con
tenders for the NCAA title."
In an effort to iron out the kinks, the No.
3 Cardinal, 14-1 on the season, faces No. 15
California today at 1:30 p.m. at Stanford Ten
nis Stadium.
Friday, the ninth-rated Bruins, without a
singles player ranked in the nation's top 50
and a doubles team rated in the top 40, broke
through against the Cardinal's highly touted
singles corps. Stanford's Wheaton, senior
Patrick McEnroe and sophomore Jeff
Tarango, by contrast, have been ranked in
the top 10 this season.
The Bruins' Jason Netter beat freshman
Martin Blackman 6-4, 7-6, Brian Garrow
upended Wheaton 6-4, 7-5, and Buff Farrow
outlasted McEnroe 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to stake sur
prising UCLA to a 3-3 deadlock after singles
play.
But Stanford's doubles tandems proved too
much for UCLA. Blackman, responding to the
call, combined with McEnroe to dispose of
Farrow and Robert Bierens 6-4, 6-2. Sopho
mores Jeff Cathrall and Eric Peus followed
with a 6-1, 7-6 over Netter and Giora Payes
to clinch the match. UCLA, which defeated
California Saturday 5-1, dropped to 15-5.
"UCLA is a tough, competitive team," Gould
said. "However, I felt we played tentative
against them. We didn't go after the match
as a championship team should."
A see-saw battle throughout the match
against USC, the quality of tennis increased
dramatically, but saw Stanford not play quite
up to par.
"We are still playing up and down and
inconsistent," Tarango said. "We are not quite
tip-top on our games."
In the outdoor matches, Cathrall trounced
Murphy Jensen 6-2, 6-1, but the Trojans Scott
Brownsberger disposed of Barry Richards 7-5,
6-3 to knot the match at 1-1.
Wheaton, getting stronger with each match,
followed with a come-from-behind win over
Byron Black 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Blackman scraped
back into his match after have a tough time
early on, besting Eric Amend, the nation's
17th-rated player, 0-6, 7-6, 7-5.
"Did Blackman have a ballsy match, or
what?," USC's John Can-as said. "After get
ting killed early, he just stuck with it; he
really showed some nuts out there."
Cathrall and Peus, down three match points
and 5-3 in the third-set tiebreaker, rebounded
to upend Carras and Black 6-2, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5).
But Jensen and Brownsberger broke
McEnroe's serve at 5-4 in the third set to
register a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory over McEnroe
and Blackman to keep USC in the match by
a 4-2 score. McEnroe and Blackman are the
nation's 14th-ranked doubles combination.
At Maples Pavilion, Tarango continued his
winning ways by edging Carras at No. 2 singles

7-6, 4-6, 6-2.
The best performance of the night came at
No. 1 singles. Melville, the fourth-rated col
legian, used his powerful serve to thump
McEnroe, the nation's sixth-ranked player,
6-3, 6-2.
In the third indoor match, which went until

after midnight, Tarango and Wheaton edged
Melville and Amend, the nation's No. 1 dou
bles team, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
"We want to win the whole thing in doubles
this year," Tarango said. "If Dave and I are
playing well, we can beat any college doubles
team in the nation."
