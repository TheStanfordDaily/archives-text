# Cathrall continues quiet winning ways

As a freshman last year, Stan
ford tennis player Jeff Cathrall
made headlines with a spectac
ular comeback from 5-2 down
in the third set against Long
Beach State's Kevin Gilette to
spur Stanford's upset of the
second-ranked 49ers.
Cathrall isn't making as many
headlines this year, but there's
an easy explanation why. He's
not making spectacular com
ebacks — he's just consistently
drilling every opponent he faces.
Saturday's win against USC's
Murphy Jensen was no excep
tion. Cathrall simply plowed
through the younger brother of
former USC All-America Luke
6-2, 6-1, to start Stanford off
on its defeat of the No. 1

Trojans. The win raised
Cathrall's overall mark to a
sterling 14-3 this season.
How did Cathrall explain the
win? Pretty simple really.
"I'm playing good tennis," the
Lakewood, Colo., resident said.
"I played well (today). I just
played my game and I beat him
easily."
On a team with All-Americans
like sophomore Jeff Tarango
and senior Patrick McEnroe as
well as highly touted freshmen
like David Wheaton and Martin
Blackman, it's easy for
Cathrall's accomplishments to
get downplayed. None of these
accomplishments have been lost
on the team, however.
"The kid has had just a tre
mendous year so far," Stanford


James Rucker — Daily
Jeff Cathrall has provided an almost sure win for the Cardinal
all year at N0.4 and 5 singles and the sophomore did it again
against UCLA and USC this weekend.
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger said.
"I think last year he struggled a
lot, had a little trouble adjust
ing. ... [This yearj he's been un
believable; he's done everything
we asked."
Said sophomore Fide Peus,
Cathrall's main doubles partner
for over a year: "I think he's ma
tured a lot psychologically. He can
deal with adversity a lot more."
For Cathrall, improvement
seems to be a matter of gaining
more confidence. Cathrall is very

comfortable banging away from
the baseline, but perhaps could
be an even more formidable player
if he serve-and-volleyed more.
"We still would like him to do
that a little more at times," Whit
linger said. "He still likes staying
back."
"I'm still working on my vol
leys," Cathrall said. "I work on
coming in from the baseline. It's
going pretty slow, though. I've got
to get more confidence in my vol
leys, and as I get more confidence,
I'll come in more."
"He's got a good serve-and
volley," Whitlinger said. "He
doesn't give himself enough cred
it. I don't think he's afraid to —

he doesn't enjoy it as much as
staying on the baseline."
The key to improving his game
may be doubles, where he and
Peus are 11-1 overall this year,
9-0 in dual matches.
"Catman's really improved his
doubles over the year," Peus said.
"He volleys a lot better. He
doesn't just hit his singles return
and stay back. .. . Even in singles
he comes in a lot more. I think
doubles has helped his singles
game."
With this continued improve
ment, don't be surprised to see
Cathrall grab some more head
lines before his Stanford career
is finished.
