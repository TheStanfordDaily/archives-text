# Cathrall continues quiet winning ways

As a freshman last year, Stan
ford tennis player Jeff Cathrall
made headlines with a spectac
ular comeback from 5-2 down
in the third set against Long
Beach State's Kevin Gilette to
spur Stanford's upset of the
second-ranked 49ers.
Cathrall isn't making as many
headlines this year, but there's
an easy explanation why. He's
not making spectacular com
ebacks — he's just consistently
drilling every opponent he faces.
Saturday's win against USC's
Murphy Jensen was no excep
tion. Cathrall simply plowed
through the younger brother of
former USC All-America Luke
6-2, 6-1, to start Stanford off
on its defeat of the No. 1

Trojans. The win raised
Cathrall's overall mark to a
sterling 14-3 this season.
How did Cathrall explain the
win? Pretty simple really.
"I'm playing good tennis," the
Lakewood, Colo., resident said.
"I played well (today). I just
played my game and I beat him
easily."
On a team with All-Americans
like sophomore Jeff Tarango
and senior Patrick McEnroe as
well as highly touted freshmen
like David Wheaton and Martin
Blackman, it's easy for
Cathrall's accomplishments to
get downplayed. None of these
accomplishments have been lost
on the team, however.
"The kid has had just a tre
mendous year so far," Stanford


James Rucker — Daily
Jeff Cathrall has provided an almost sure win for the Cardinal
all year at N0.4 and 5 singles and the sophomore did it again
against UCLA and USC this weekend.
