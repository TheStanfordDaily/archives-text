# Card nine closes on 1st-place Cal, pummels St. Mary's
## 
### Chris Myers Win Reis Staff writer 
Alter struggling
for runs all week
end, the Stanford
baseball team
stumbled into an
offensive land of
plenty yesterday,

whipping St. Mary's 13-2 at
Sunken Diamond.
The win, coupled with a split
with California over the weekend,
improves the Cardinal's season
record to 23-11. Stanford is 9-5
in Pac-10 Southern Division play,
tied for second with USC, a half
game behind the first-place Bears.
The Cardinal takes on Santa
Clara at 2:30 p.m. today at Buck
Shaw Stadium, then travels to
Tucson, Ariz., for a Six-Pac series
with Arizona this weekend.
Things started well for Stanford
yesterday. The Cardinal, which
had scored a total of nine runs
in the three games against Cal,
got five in the first inning against
the Gaels. Troy Paulsen extended
his hitting streak to 13 consecu
tive games with a lead-off homer.
St. Mary's starter Marc D'Andrea
tried to jam Paulsen with a 1-0
fastball, but Paulsen got around
and muscled it over the left field
fence.
Paulsen's homer was the only
hit of the inning, but Stanford
managed to put four other run
ners across the plate. Ron Wit
meyer walked, stole second and
third, and scored on a wild pitch.
Left-fielder Brian Johnson walked
and moved to third when Gaels'
shortstop Frank Welsh threw a
potential double-play ball into

right field.
A balk sent Johnson across the
plate with what turned out to be
the game-winning run. Another
walk and two wild pitches later,
the score was 6-0, and D'Andrea
was relieved by Chris Emerick,
who retired the side.
St. Mary's managed to get runs

in both the second and third, and
when Stanford starter Brian
Kamerschen gave up three con
secutive singles in the third,
Coach Mark Marquess brought in
reliever Brian Keyser. Keyser
threw five and two-thirds strong
innings, giving up no runs, five
hits and striking out three to get

the win.
"I didn't throw too well for the
first three innings, but then my
fastball got a little more juice,"
Keyser said of his performance.
M My elbow's not 100 percent, but
it's good to get out."
Freshman Scott Weiss came in
to finish off the Gaels in the

ninth.
The game also saw Ed Sprague
hit his 10th home run of the year
and Tim Griffin strengthen his
hold on the right-handed desig
nated hitter spot with three
singles in three at-bats, two RBI
and a run scored.
In addition, the game saw the
Cardinal take advantage of four
St. Mary's errors, four wild
pitches and a balk. "It was good
to see us put some pressure on
the opposition," Marquess said.
Despite the strong perform
ances, however, Marquess is both
ered by sophomore Paul Carey's
season-long hitting slump; so
bothered, in fact, that he started
freshman Ryan Turner in Carey's
stead. Carey had started 83
straight games for the Cardinal
dating to early last season. How
ever, he did come in for Turner
in the third, going hitless in two
at-bats with a sacrifice fly. "It's
just a mental thing for Paul
(Carey)," said Marquess. "We'll
give him some extra batting prac
tice Wednesday and Thursday."
Other Cardinal batters, mean
while, are riding hot streaks.
Senior catcher Doug Robbins, for
one, seemed determined to be a
hero last weekend.
On Friday, Robbins ripped a
dramatic two-run homer in the
top of the ninth to give Stanford
a 2-1 lead over California, only to
watch the Cardinal pitchers blow
the lead and the game.
In the bottom of the ninth, Car
dinal pitcher Steve Chitren
walked a man, gave up a game
tying single, and issued an inten
tional walk and an unintentional
walk to load the bases with two
out and the game tied 2-2. Robbie

Kamerschen came on for the Car
dinal, ran the count to 3-2 on
Bart Frets, then threw high and
inside to force in the winning run.
Seemingly unfazed, Robbins
came back Saturday at Sunken
Diamond and turned in possibly
his best game of the season. He
knocked in two runs (including
the game-winner on a sacrifice fly
in the eighth), threw out Cal's
speedy Darren Lewis at second in
the top of the eighth, coaxed Card
starter Lee Plemel through a
sometimes rocky complete game
and even stole a base, as the Car
dinal overcame several defensive
lapses and came from behind for
a crucial 5-4 win in a key Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
contest.
Robbins' performance against
the Bears earned him Six-Pac
Player of the Week honors, while
Cardinal freshman Mike Mussina
was named the league's Pitcher
of the Week after shutting the
Bears down on six hits in Stan
ford's 3-2 win on Thursday.
"Now we're even with them
(Cal) in the loss column, and
that's what's important," Stan
ford third baseman Ed Sprague
said.
The Cardinal kept itself in the
hunt for the Six-Pac title despite
some uncharacteristically shoddy
defense and spotty hitting against
the Bears.
"We didn't play well at all this
weekend, and we still took two
out of three," Sprague said.
"We really haven't put it all
together all year," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said Saturday.
"We haven't played very well and

yet we're doing all right in the
league.... Today we boot some
balls and come back and find a
way to win — I'm proud of that."
Indeed, the Cardinal put itself
in a hole early on Saturday, com
mitting three errors in the first
inning and two in the fourth to
fall behind 4-1. Plemel, mean
while, was struggling with his
control, hitting a batter and
throwing a wild pitch in the first
and hitting two batters in the
fourth.
In the bottom of the fourth,
however, it was Cal's turn to boot
the ball. After singles by Paulsen
and Witmeyer and two Cal
thowing errors, there were men
on second and third with no outs.
With Sprague up, Cal put on a
defensive shift that had Cal
second baseman Darryl Vice on
the shortstop side of second base
and centerflelder Lewis in the left
center alley.
Sprague, however, went the

other way, clouting a double to
the right-center fence to score
both runners and make the score
4-3. After Paul Carey walked,
Robbins lined a single into right
and Sprague came charging
around third to score the tying
run, apparently ignoring a hold
sign from third-base coach Dean
Stotz.
"I didn't see him [StotzCßO,
he was so far down the line,"
Sprague said. "Once I get a fourth
or a half of the way home, I'm
not going to stop ... I just put
my head down."
The tie didn't last long. In the
fifth, Cal used two walks and a
wild pitch to get men on first and
third with two outs. Jeff Kent
lofted a fly into shallow right that
dropped in between three fielders
for a single to put the Bears on
top 5-4.
In the bottom of the seventh,
Robbins drew a walk, stole second
and came home on Paulsen's third
single of the day to tie the game
again, 5-5.
Lewis led off the Cal eighth
with a single, but Robbins gunned
him down going to second, and

Plemel whiffed Kent and pinch
hitter John Kuehl to snuff the
rally.
In the bottom of the eighth,
Sprague led off with a single, went
to second on a sacrifice bunt by
Paul Carey, moved to third on
pinch-hitter Tim Griffin's single,
then scored the winning run on
Robbins' sacrifice fly to deep left.
"I hit it off the handle, and was
able to get it up in the air," Rob
bins said. "Luckily, that's all we
needed."
Plemel retired the side in the
ninth to complete an inelegant
five-hitter. "Lee threw a com
pletely different kind of game,"
Robbins said. "He didn't have his
curveball ... and he didn't have
his control. ... He threw his
slider a lot more today."
Card notes
Paulsen has hit safely in 21 of his
last 22 games and during those 22
games is batting .383 (38-99). He is
hitting .350 on the year.
Attendance at Saturday's game was
4,664, an all-time Sunken Diamond
record. Even the grassy slope along
the third-base line was cram-packed
with people.

Yesterday's 13-2 win equalled Stan
ford's most lopsided win of the year.
The Cardinal beat UC-Santa Barbara
15-4 and 13-2 earlier in the season.
The Cardinal is now 18-3 at home,
5-8 on the road.
Cal's Evans Diamond may be the
only collegiate ballpark in the country
where the National Anthem isn't
played before games. But after the
way the Stanford Band played the
anthem before Saturday's game, offi
cials at Sunken Diamond may con
sider following suit. Playing the Star-
Spangled Banner that poorly is down
right unpatriotic.
Brian Johnson's hitting streak
came to a halt at 12 games when he
went hitless in three at-bats with a
walk Saturday. Johnson had extended
the streak to 12 with three hits on
Friday.

Alter struggling
for runs all week
end, the Stanford
baseball team
stumbled into an
offensive land of
plenty yesterday,

whipping St. Mary's 13-2 at
Sunken Diamond.
The win, coupled with a split
with California over the weekend,
improves the Cardinal's season
record to 23-11. Stanford is 9-5
in Pac-10 Southern Division play,
tied for second with USC, a half
game behind the first-place Bears.
The Cardinal takes on Santa
Clara at 2:30 p.m. today at Buck
Shaw Stadium, then travels to
Tucson, Ariz., for a Six-Pac series
with Arizona this weekend.
Things started well for Stanford
yesterday. The Cardinal, which
had scored a total of nine runs
in the three games against Cal,
got five in the first inning against
the Gaels. Troy Paulsen extended
his hitting streak to 13 consecu
tive games with a lead-off homer.
St. Mary's starter Marc D'Andrea
tried to jam Paulsen with a 1-0
fastball, but Paulsen got around
and muscled it over the left field
fence.
Paulsen's homer was the only
hit of the inning, but Stanford
managed to put four other run
ners across the plate. Ron Wit
meyer walked, stole second and
third, and scored on a wild pitch.
Left-fielder Brian Johnson walked
and moved to third when Gaels'
shortstop Frank Welsh threw a
potential double-play ball into

right field.
A balk sent Johnson across the
plate with what turned out to be
the game-winning run. Another
walk and two wild pitches later,
the score was 6-0, and D'Andrea
was relieved by Chris Emerick,
who retired the side.
St. Mary's managed to get runs

in both the second and third, and
when Stanford starter Brian
Kamerschen gave up three con
secutive singles in the third,
Coach Mark Marquess brought in
reliever Brian Keyser. Keyser
threw five and two-thirds strong
innings, giving up no runs, five
hits and striking out three to get

the win.
"I didn't throw too well for the
first three innings, but then my
fastball got a little more juice,"
Keyser said of his performance.
M My elbow's not 100 percent, but
it's good to get out."
Freshman Scott Weiss came in
to finish off the Gaels in the

ninth.
The game also saw Ed Sprague
hit his 10th home run of the year
and Tim Griffin strengthen his
hold on the right-handed desig
nated hitter spot with three
singles in three at-bats, two RBI
and a run scored.
In addition, the game saw the
Cardinal take advantage of four
St. Mary's errors, four wild
pitches and a balk. "It was good
to see us put some pressure on
the opposition," Marquess said.
Despite the strong perform
ances, however, Marquess is both
ered by sophomore Paul Carey's
season-long hitting slump; so
bothered, in fact, that he started
freshman Ryan Turner in Carey's
stead. Carey had started 83
straight games for the Cardinal
dating to early last season. How
ever, he did come in for Turner
in the third, going hitless in two
at-bats with a sacrifice fly. "It's
just a mental thing for Paul
(Carey)," said Marquess. "We'll
give him some extra batting prac
tice Wednesday and Thursday."
Other Cardinal batters, mean
while, are riding hot streaks.
Senior catcher Doug Robbins, for
one, seemed determined to be a
hero last weekend.
On Friday, Robbins ripped a
dramatic two-run homer in the
top of the ninth to give Stanford
a 2-1 lead over California, only to
watch the Cardinal pitchers blow
the lead and the game.
In the bottom of the ninth, Car
dinal pitcher Steve Chitren
walked a man, gave up a game
tying single, and issued an inten
tional walk and an unintentional
walk to load the bases with two
out and the game tied 2-2. Robbie

Kamerschen came on for the Car
dinal, ran the count to 3-2 on
Bart Frets, then threw high and
inside to force in the winning run.
Seemingly unfazed, Robbins
came back Saturday at Sunken
Diamond and turned in possibly
his best game of the season. He
knocked in two runs (including
the game-winner on a sacrifice fly
in the eighth), threw out Cal's
speedy Darren Lewis at second in
the top of the eighth, coaxed Card
starter Lee Plemel through a
sometimes rocky complete game
and even stole a base, as the Car
dinal overcame several defensive
lapses and came from behind for
a crucial 5-4 win in a key Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
contest.
Robbins' performance against
the Bears earned him Six-Pac
Player of the Week honors, while
Cardinal freshman Mike Mussina
was named the league's Pitcher
of the Week after shutting the
Bears down on six hits in Stan
ford's 3-2 win on Thursday.
"Now we're even with them
(Cal) in the loss column, and
that's what's important," Stan
ford third baseman Ed Sprague
said.
The Cardinal kept itself in the
hunt for the Six-Pac title despite
some uncharacteristically shoddy
defense and spotty hitting against
the Bears.
"We didn't play well at all this
weekend, and we still took two
out of three," Sprague said.
"We really haven't put it all
together all year," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said Saturday.
"We haven't played very well and

yet we're doing all right in the
league.... Today we boot some
balls and come back and find a
way to win — I'm proud of that."
Indeed, the Cardinal put itself
in a hole early on Saturday, com
mitting three errors in the first
inning and two in the fourth to
fall behind 4-1. Plemel, mean
while, was struggling with his
control, hitting a batter and
throwing a wild pitch in the first
and hitting two batters in the
fourth.
In the bottom of the fourth,
however, it was Cal's turn to boot
the ball. After singles by Paulsen
and Witmeyer and two Cal
thowing errors, there were men
on second and third with no outs.
With Sprague up, Cal put on a
defensive shift that had Cal
second baseman Darryl Vice on
the shortstop side of second base
and centerflelder Lewis in the left
center alley.
Sprague, however, went the

other way, clouting a double to
the right-center fence to score
both runners and make the score
4-3. After Paul Carey walked,
Robbins lined a single into right
and Sprague came charging
around third to score the tying
run, apparently ignoring a hold
sign from third-base coach Dean
Stotz.
"I didn't see him [StotzCßO,
he was so far down the line,"
Sprague said. "Once I get a fourth
or a half of the way home, I'm
not going to stop ... I just put
my head down."
The tie didn't last long. In the
fifth, Cal used two walks and a
wild pitch to get men on first and
third with two outs. Jeff Kent
lofted a fly into shallow right that
dropped in between three fielders
for a single to put the Bears on
top 5-4.
In the bottom of the seventh,
Robbins drew a walk, stole second
and came home on Paulsen's third
single of the day to tie the game
again, 5-5.
Lewis led off the Cal eighth
with a single, but Robbins gunned
him down going to second, and

Plemel whiffed Kent and pinch
hitter John Kuehl to snuff the
rally.
In the bottom of the eighth,
Sprague led off with a single, went
to second on a sacrifice bunt by
Paul Carey, moved to third on
pinch-hitter Tim Griffin's single,
then scored the winning run on
Robbins' sacrifice fly to deep left.
"I hit it off the handle, and was
able to get it up in the air," Rob
bins said. "Luckily, that's all we
needed."
Plemel retired the side in the
ninth to complete an inelegant
five-hitter. "Lee threw a com
pletely different kind of game,"
Robbins said. "He didn't have his
curveball ... and he didn't have
his control. ... He threw his
slider a lot more today."
Card notes
Paulsen has hit safely in 21 of his
last 22 games and during those 22
games is batting .383 (38-99). He is
hitting .350 on the year.
Attendance at Saturday's game was
4,664, an all-time Sunken Diamond
record. Even the grassy slope along
the third-base line was cram-packed
with people.

Yesterday's 13-2 win equalled Stan
ford's most lopsided win of the year.
The Cardinal beat UC-Santa Barbara
15-4 and 13-2 earlier in the season.
The Cardinal is now 18-3 at home,
5-8 on the road.
Cal's Evans Diamond may be the
only collegiate ballpark in the country
where the National Anthem isn't
played before games. But after the
way the Stanford Band played the
anthem before Saturday's game, offi
cials at Sunken Diamond may con
sider following suit. Playing the Star-
Spangled Banner that poorly is down
right unpatriotic.
Brian Johnson's hitting streak
came to a halt at 12 games when he
went hitless in three at-bats with a
walk Saturday. Johnson had extended
the streak to 12 with three hits on
Friday.

Alter struggling
for runs all week
end, the Stanford
baseball team
stumbled into an
offensive land of
plenty yesterday,

whipping St. Mary's 13-2 at
Sunken Diamond.
The win, coupled with a split
with California over the weekend,
improves the Cardinal's season
record to 23-11. Stanford is 9-5
in Pac-10 Southern Division play,
tied for second with USC, a half
game behind the first-place Bears.
The Cardinal takes on Santa
Clara at 2:30 p.m. today at Buck
Shaw Stadium, then travels to
Tucson, Ariz., for a Six-Pac series
with Arizona this weekend.
Things started well for Stanford
yesterday. The Cardinal, which
had scored a total of nine runs
in the three games against Cal,
got five in the first inning against
the Gaels. Troy Paulsen extended
his hitting streak to 13 consecu
tive games with a lead-off homer.
St. Mary's starter Marc D'Andrea
tried to jam Paulsen with a 1-0
fastball, but Paulsen got around
and muscled it over the left field
fence.
Paulsen's homer was the only
hit of the inning, but Stanford
managed to put four other run
ners across the plate. Ron Wit
meyer walked, stole second and
third, and scored on a wild pitch.
Left-fielder Brian Johnson walked
and moved to third when Gaels'
shortstop Frank Welsh threw a
potential double-play ball into

right field.
A balk sent Johnson across the
plate with what turned out to be
the game-winning run. Another
walk and two wild pitches later,
the score was 6-0, and D'Andrea
was relieved by Chris Emerick,
who retired the side.
St. Mary's managed to get runs

in both the second and third, and
when Stanford starter Brian
Kamerschen gave up three con
secutive singles in the third,
Coach Mark Marquess brought in
reliever Brian Keyser. Keyser
threw five and two-thirds strong
innings, giving up no runs, five
hits and striking out three to get

the win.
"I didn't throw too well for the
first three innings, but then my
fastball got a little more juice,"
Keyser said of his performance.
M My elbow's not 100 percent, but
it's good to get out."
Freshman Scott Weiss came in
to finish off the Gaels in the

ninth.
The game also saw Ed Sprague
hit his 10th home run of the year
and Tim Griffin strengthen his
hold on the right-handed desig
nated hitter spot with three
singles in three at-bats, two RBI
and a run scored.
In addition, the game saw the
Cardinal take advantage of four
St. Mary's errors, four wild
pitches and a balk. "It was good
to see us put some pressure on
the opposition," Marquess said.
Despite the strong perform
ances, however, Marquess is both
ered by sophomore Paul Carey's
season-long hitting slump; so
bothered, in fact, that he started
freshman Ryan Turner in Carey's
stead. Carey had started 83
straight games for the Cardinal
dating to early last season. How
ever, he did come in for Turner
in the third, going hitless in two
at-bats with a sacrifice fly. "It's
just a mental thing for Paul
(Carey)," said Marquess. "We'll
give him some extra batting prac
tice Wednesday and Thursday."
Other Cardinal batters, mean
while, are riding hot streaks.
Senior catcher Doug Robbins, for
one, seemed determined to be a
hero last weekend.
On Friday, Robbins ripped a
dramatic two-run homer in the
top of the ninth to give Stanford
a 2-1 lead over California, only to
watch the Cardinal pitchers blow
the lead and the game.
In the bottom of the ninth, Car
dinal pitcher Steve Chitren
walked a man, gave up a game
tying single, and issued an inten
tional walk and an unintentional
walk to load the bases with two
out and the game tied 2-2. Robbie

Kamerschen came on for the Car
dinal, ran the count to 3-2 on
Bart Frets, then threw high and
inside to force in the winning run.
Seemingly unfazed, Robbins
came back Saturday at Sunken
Diamond and turned in possibly
his best game of the season. He
knocked in two runs (including
the game-winner on a sacrifice fly
in the eighth), threw out Cal's
speedy Darren Lewis at second in
the top of the eighth, coaxed Card
starter Lee Plemel through a
sometimes rocky complete game
and even stole a base, as the Car
dinal overcame several defensive
lapses and came from behind for
a crucial 5-4 win in a key Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
contest.
Robbins' performance against
the Bears earned him Six-Pac
Player of the Week honors, while
Cardinal freshman Mike Mussina
was named the league's Pitcher
of the Week after shutting the
Bears down on six hits in Stan
ford's 3-2 win on Thursday.
"Now we're even with them
(Cal) in the loss column, and
that's what's important," Stan
ford third baseman Ed Sprague
said.
The Cardinal kept itself in the
hunt for the Six-Pac title despite
some uncharacteristically shoddy
defense and spotty hitting against
the Bears.
"We didn't play well at all this
weekend, and we still took two
out of three," Sprague said.
"We really haven't put it all
together all year," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said Saturday.
"We haven't played very well and

A big reason for the Cardinal's success this weekend was the play of senior catcher Doug Robbins,
who went 8-for-14 at the plate and was named the Slx-Pac Player of the Week.
yet we're doing all right in the
league.... Today we boot some
balls and come back and find a
way to win — I'm proud of that."
Indeed, the Cardinal put itself
in a hole early on Saturday, com
mitting three errors in the first
inning and two in the fourth to
fall behind 4-1. Plemel, mean
while, was struggling with his
control, hitting a batter and
throwing a wild pitch in the first
and hitting two batters in the
fourth.
In the bottom of the fourth,
however, it was Cal's turn to boot
the ball. After singles by Paulsen
and Witmeyer and two Cal
thowing errors, there were men
on second and third with no outs.
With Sprague up, Cal put on a
defensive shift that had Cal
second baseman Darryl Vice on
the shortstop side of second base
and centerflelder Lewis in the left
center alley.
Sprague, however, went the

other way, clouting a double to
the right-center fence to score
both runners and make the score
4-3. After Paul Carey walked,
Robbins lined a single into right
and Sprague came charging
around third to score the tying
run, apparently ignoring a hold
sign from third-base coach Dean
Stotz.
"I didn't see him [StotzCßO,
he was so far down the line,"
Sprague said. "Once I get a fourth
or a half of the way home, I'm
not going to stop ... I just put
my head down."
The tie didn't last long. In the
fifth, Cal used two walks and a
wild pitch to get men on first and
third with two outs. Jeff Kent
lofted a fly into shallow right that
dropped in between three fielders
for a single to put the Bears on
top 5-4.
In the bottom of the seventh,
Robbins drew a walk, stole second
and came home on Paulsen's third
single of the day to tie the game
again, 5-5.
Lewis led off the Cal eighth
with a single, but Robbins gunned
him down going to second, and

Plemel whiffed Kent and pinch
hitter John Kuehl to snuff the
rally.
In the bottom of the eighth,
Sprague led off with a single, went
to second on a sacrifice bunt by
Paul Carey, moved to third on
pinch-hitter Tim Griffin's single,
then scored the winning run on
Robbins' sacrifice fly to deep left.
"I hit it off the handle, and was
able to get it up in the air," Rob
bins said. "Luckily, that's all we
needed."
Plemel retired the side in the
ninth to complete an inelegant
five-hitter. "Lee threw a com
pletely different kind of game,"
Robbins said. "He didn't have his
curveball ... and he didn't have
his control. ... He threw his
slider a lot more today."
Card notes
Paulsen has hit safely in 21 of his
last 22 games and during those 22
games is batting .383 (38-99). He is
hitting .350 on the year.
Attendance at Saturday's game was
4,664, an all-time Sunken Diamond
record. Even the grassy slope along
the third-base line was cram-packed
with people.

Yesterday's 13-2 win equalled Stan
ford's most lopsided win of the year.
The Cardinal beat UC-Santa Barbara
15-4 and 13-2 earlier in the season.
The Cardinal is now 18-3 at home,
5-8 on the road.
Cal's Evans Diamond may be the
only collegiate ballpark in the country
where the National Anthem isn't
played before games. But after the
way the Stanford Band played the
anthem before Saturday's game, offi
cials at Sunken Diamond may con
sider following suit. Playing the Star-
Spangled Banner that poorly is down
right unpatriotic.
Brian Johnson's hitting streak
came to a halt at 12 games when he
went hitless in three at-bats with a
walk Saturday. Johnson had extended
the streak to 12 with three hits on
Friday.
