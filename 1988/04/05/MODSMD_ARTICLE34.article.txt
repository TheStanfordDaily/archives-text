# Women win big
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
A blend of consis
tency and uncer
tainty has charac
terized the 1988
season for the
Stanford women's
tennis team, and

both were in evidence last week
end when the No. 2 Cardinal im
proved its record to 17-1 with a
pair of victories in Arizona.
Friday in Tempe, Stanford won
five of the six singles contests in
straight sets en route to recording
a routine 7-2 victory over Arizona
State. Saturday in Tucson,
against 15th-ranked Arizona, the
Cardinal, for one of the few times
this season, could not clinch the
match in singles. Nevertheless,
the team prevailed 6-3.
The wins were largely the result
of the continuing solid perform
ances of the Cardinal's freshmen:
Tami and Teri Whitlinger, and
Sandra Birch. The three won all
of their singles matches this week
end, and the Whitlingers contin
ued to be a force at the No. 2
doubles position.
With the team score 4-2 going
into the doubles Saturday, the
Whitlingers put a quick end to
Arizona's hopes of a victory by
pounding Nancy Breen and Har
riet Knols 6-2, 6-3.
Stanford Asst. Coach Caryn
Copeland said that the Whitlin
gers take pressure off their team
mates by getting off to quick
starts in their doubles matches.
"They start so fast, and that's
really good for the team when you
have to win doubles," Copeland
said.
The Whitlingers are 19-2 over
all this season and 11-0 in dual
matches. "They're a darn solid
No. 2," Copeland said. "We can't
be more confident with a team

like that."
While the three freshmen, in
addition to senior Kay Tittle (who
continued her winning ways with
a pair of straight-set singles vic
tories in Arizona), have been con
sistently good since the start of
the season, Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan and Copeland have some
work to do in other areas with
the national championships just
over a month away.
The No. 6 singles spot has been
a problem area for the Cardinal
in recent matches. Junior Cindy
Buchsbaum, the third player to
occupy the position this season,
dropped both of her matches last
weekend.
"She's from Arizona, so I'm
sure she felt a little pressure,"
Copeland said. "But in addition
to that, she just hasn't played
many matches."
Buchsbaum may not play many
matches in the final month of the
season. Brennan decided after the
trip to Arizona to put senior Cari
Hagey back in the singles lineup
in place of Buchsbaum.
The problem at No. 6 singles
would disappear if junior Eleni
Rossides, who has been injured
since the first week in February,
returned to action. However, the
nation's top-ranked singles player
is not expected to play Thursday
against California. "USC and
UCLA (April 15-16) I think would
be the first possibility for Ros
sides' 1988 dual-match debut,"
Copeland said.
Stanford has also been plagued
by an inconsistent No. 3 doubles
combination of Tittle and sopho
more Lisa Green. The pair split
two matches last weekend, losing
at Arizona State and pulling out
a third-set tiebreaker at Arizona.
"They've had some good
results, but they're very streaky,
hot and cold," Copeland said of
Tittle and Green.
