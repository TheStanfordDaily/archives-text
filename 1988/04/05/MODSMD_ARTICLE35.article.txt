# Crews cruise
## Rowers meet first test 
### Don Hogue Staff writer 
Stanford men's
crew Coach Ken
Dreyfuss has rea
son to be optimis
tic about the 1988
season. Judging
from the perform-

ance last weekend at the San
Diego Crew Classic at Mission
Bay, Stanford could be emerging
as one of the top crew programs
in the country.
In the men's varsity Grand
Final, Stanford had an impressive
third-place finish behind defend
ing Pacific 10 Conference cham
pion UCLA and Wisconsin, the
runner-up in last year's Intercol
legiate Rowing Association Cham
pionships. Impressive also is that
Stanford defeated both California
and Washington — two teams
that had once dominated West
Coast crew.
"The varsity boat proved that
they will definitely be a force this
season," sophomore Kevin
McPeek said. "Although the
younger (junior varsity and
novice) boats didn't do as well,
they did learn from the experience
and will definitely improve con
siderably this season."
However, Stanford's junior var
sity boat did beat California in
both the preliminary heat and
Grand Final, ending a 17-year
drought for the Cardinal over
cross-bay rival Cal.
"Basically, we couldn't be more
delighted with the showing of our
crews at the regatta," Dreyfuss
said. Stanford qualified all but one
of its boats for Saturday's Grand
Finals.
In the women's varsity Grand

Final, Stanford held on for a
fourth place finish in a tough
field. Defending national and Pac
-10 champion Washington claimed
the gold, followed by Wisconsin
and California. Stanford was a
medalist in the women's junior
varsity, taking second to the
Huskies.
Highlighting the regatta for
Stanford was the performance of
the women's novice boats. The
first novice won the Grand Final
of the women's collegiate novice,
capturing Stanford's sole gold
medal. The second novice followed
with a silver in the open novice
division, being edged by the Long
Beach Rowing Association's
squad.
After winning their preliminary
heat Friday, the men's frosh had
perhaps the toughest break of the
regatta. More than halfway into
the Grand Final, a Stanford
oarsman caught a wake, knocking
out two seats from the racing
shell. The boat limped to the
finish after any chance to defend
last year's gold in the event was
destroyed.
The regatta was the final race
for frosh/novice Coach Dan Lyons,
who will continue training with
the Penn Athletic Club in prepa
ration for the 1988 Olympics.
Lyons, who was assisted by Tim
Noakes during the fall and winter,
was the 1987 world champion in
the fours-without-coxswain.
Stanford will return to the
water to host the Redwood
Shores/Stanford Rowing Classic,
April 16-17. The regatta, billed as
one of the top Henley-style events
in the nation, will feature eight
of the country's best crews in
head-to-head competition.
