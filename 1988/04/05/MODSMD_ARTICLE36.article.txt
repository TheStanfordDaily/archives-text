Winning isn't everything,
as long as you accomplish
what you set out to do.
Even in defeat, the Stan
ford women's gymnastics
team chalked up several
team and individual ac-

complishments in their last dual meet of
the season against Utah State Friday

night. The final score was 187.45-184.90,
Utah St., but the Cardinal tallied its high
est away meet score of the season and
the team scored over 45 points on all
four events.
"It was a pretty good meet overall,"
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina said. "I'd
like to see more hit routines, but we'll
be ready next week."
The vault was the team's strongest
and most consistent event again in this
meet with a team score of 46.95. Both

senior Alison McGann, who performed
full-on-full-off, and sophomore Dina
Amoroso, who performed a full-twisting
Tsuk, received scores of 9.55, giving them
a joint share of first place. Junior Jinny
Rhee was close behind with a score of 9.5.
McGann finished third in the uneven
bars, earning a score of 9.35 and fresh
man Jennifer Bloom made an impact with
her solid 9.3 performance.
As the third event of the meet, the
beam proved to be more of a help than

the hindrance it has frequently been in
the past. The Cardinal captured the top
two places with outstanding perform
ances by Rhee, who hit all of the tricks
in her 9.65 routine, and Sheri Evenson,
who scored a 9.5.
"Her (Rhee's) routine was much more
solid," said Sardina. "She didn't have the
wobbles she's been plagued with all
season."
Stanford concluded with a strong team
performance on the floor exercise, scoring

a 46.35. Amoroso finished third with her
9.5 routine and junior Cheryl Doo was
close behind, earning a score of 9.45.
Rhee scored a 9.35 on her floor routine
after she received a one-tenth deduction
for stepping out of bounds.
Stanford's final team score was high
enough to raise the team's regional qual
ifying score; the Cardinal, seeded fifth in
its region, is just seven-tenths behind
fourth-seeded Washington and a point
behind Fullerton State.
