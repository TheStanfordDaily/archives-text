KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -
Even though the game was on
line, Danny Manning knew
it was over.
The score was 79-77 with 14
seconds left, an eternity for
Oklahoma's racehorse offense.
Manning had been l-for-3 at
the foul line until that point.
But he cooly dropped in two
free throws for a four-point
lead.
Oklahoma came right back
for a basket by Ricky Grace
and, with five seconds left, the
6-foot-10V2 Manning found
himself back at the foul line
again.
At that moment, with the
score 81-79, the game was still
in doubt. But not according to
Manning.
'I was thinking, 'it's over,' "
Manning said.
Was that before or after he
calmly dropped the two shots?
"Before."
Manning, selected the
game's Outstanding Player,
then completed a sensational
game by grabbing the final
rebound on a desperation
heave to punctuate Kansas' 83-

79 victory for the NCAA cham
pionship.
Manning finished the game
with 31 points, 18 rebounds,
five steals, two assists and two
blocked shots.
"I knew Danny wanted it
bad," Oklahoma's Stacey King
said. "He came out and proved
it."
Manning committed his
second personal foul just 11
minutes into the first half and
sat on the bench for the next
three minutes. But Kansas
stayed with Oklahoma during
that span and, by halftime,
with a stifling pace, the score
was 50-50.
In the second half, Kansas
had Manning doing everything,
even bringing the ball upcourt.
"We have the greatest player
in the game," Kansas Coach
Larry Brown said. "With a
great player like him, you've
always got a chance."
"This wasn't a gift," Man
ning said. "We weren't lucky.
We prepared for our opportu
nities and capitalized on all of
them to get this far."
