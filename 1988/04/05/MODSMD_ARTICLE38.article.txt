# Track runs over top competition

Although the Athletes Equity
Challenge track and field meet
featured several established
world-class athletes, most of
the excitement came from the
stars of the future. At Stanford
Stadium Saturday, many col-

legiate athletes showed they will soon join the
world's elite by posting fine performances,
including several Cardinal competitors.
Carol Gray and Dave Pickett led the way
for Stanford as they both qualified for the
NCAA Outdoor Championships while the
freshman men's mile relay team set a new
school record.
Gray's race in the 3,000 meters was almost
anti-climactic. The sophomore showed racing
savvy and confidence by running away from
Yale's Sara Smith and Suzanne Beck, who
were both seeded higher than Gray. Gray took
the pace out early, coming through the mile
mark at five minutes and never wavering. At
the tape she had built up a lead of a hundred
yards, kicking to the line one second under
the NCAA qualifying time with a time of 9
minutes, 20.9 seconds.
Pickett, a senior, combined with junior
teammate Erica Wheeler to dominate in the
javelin. Pickett set a new personal best of 229
feet, 5 inches to take the early lead and qualify
for NCAAs before being inched out by Chris

Athanasia of Yale. Wheeler, already an NCAA
qualifier, destroyed her competition, as usual,
throwing 167-9.
The shot put was one event where the old
outdid the new as Brian Oldfleld, holder of
the second best throw in the world, was able
to stave off sophomores Brian Boggess and
Andy Papathanassiou of Stanford. Oldfield
showed his 42 years, but was still able to
heave the shot nearly 60 feet, a toss neither
Boggess (57-9V5j) or Papathanassiou (55-9)
could match.
The freshman men's mile relay squad got
an unexpected boost in their race. Normally,
the team would have relied on 400-meter
freshman record holder James "Sting" Cram
ton, but he was tired from battling in an open
400 field headed by world-class runner Andre
Phillips. Anchor Marcus Hickerson took
charge, though, breaking the tape in 3:16 and
nailing down the record.
The women's shot put was another Stanford
tour de force as Patty Purpur lead a Stanford
sweep. The junior was named the Pacific 10
Conference's Female Field Athlete of the Week
for her performance at the Stanford Invita
tional last week. Junior Morgyn Warner and
freshman Debbie Malueg took second and
third to complete the sweep.
Another dramatic race was the men's 1,500
meters where Stanford's Bill Crowley and
Chris Rae led a break from the pack going
into the last lap with Crowley taking a narrow
lead. Crowley was outkicked by a tenth of a

second at the line, but came in with a time
of 3:47.13. Rae, a freshman, was fifth at
3:49.74.
Stanford Ail-American Lisa Bernhagen did
not enter the women's high jump, an event
that developed into a tight battle between
Stanford sophomore Peggy Odita and open
athlete Sharon Pfister. Both went out at 5-8 V<
but Odita won for the Cardinal by virtue of
her fewer misses.
The tables were turned for Stanford senior
pole vaulter John Gash. Gash, a junior, tied
the winning height of 17-% but came in second
on the basis of total misses.
Sophomore Venessa Henlon, Stanford's only
other athlete entered Saturday, won the wom
en's triple jump with a leap of 39-1%.
Several Stanford graduates also competed.
Jeff Atkinson took the 800 meters in 1:48.94,
followed by another alumnus, Brian Pettingill.
Pam Board, who graduated only last year,
rekindled old memories by winning the wom
en's 400-meter hurdles and taking second in
the 100-meter hurdles. Another 1987 gradu
ate, Charles Alexander, came back to win the
5,000 meters.
Stanford entered a fairly young group of
athletes as many competitors were given the
weekend off after participating in two meets
during spring break. The Cardinal's next chal
lenge will be this weekend where it will have
a chance to compete against top talent from
across the nation in the Texas Relays.
