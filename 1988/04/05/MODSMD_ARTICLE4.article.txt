# Jordan Scholar plan revised
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
After drawing criticism and
questions in its first year of ex
istence, the fledgling David Starr
Jordan Scholars program has
been retooled to serve only as a
recruitment device and not as a
means of honoring students after
they enter Stanford, according to
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow.
Wasow said in an interview yes
terday that 200 high school ap

plicants to Stanford who met the
"highest academic criteria of high
school achievement" have been
named Jordan scholars, and will
be notified of the honor in their
acceptance letters, which are to
be mailed out today.
However, in a change from the
program as it was organized last
year, the distinction will not ex
tend beyond the admissions proc
ess. Wasow said Jordan scholars
will not be offered "special
priviledges after matriculation."
After the Undergraduate Ad

missions Office announced the in
troduction of the program last
year, students here criticized the
University of fostering divisive
ness among its incoming students.
In explaining recent changes in
the program this year, Wasow
said: "Stanford is committed to
the principle that everyone starts
off on equal footing."
In essence, the program has
been modified with a more clearly
defined purpose of attracting "ac-
ademic superstars" to Stanford,
Wasow said.
The Jordan scholar distinction
will continue as a "label," accord
ing to Sociology Prof. John Meyer,
member of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Admissions and Fi
nancial Aid, which was responsi
ble for reworking the young pro
gram.
The letter informing each ap
plicants of his or her selection as
a Jordan scholar offers a special
invitation to attend Prospective
Freshmen Week (April 18-25) and
tells the student that Stanford
recognizes his or her academic
achievement among the highest
of all prospective freshmen.
An additional element of the
revised award is financial assis
tance for needy Jordan scholars
to travel here this spring.
Originally, University officials
said the program, which then in
cluded no financial compensation,
was being initiated largely to com
pete with schools who offer large

monetary awards to their most
talented applicants.
Wasow said the reformed Jor
dan scholar plan is an "experi
ment" and the funding to assist
with travel costs is contingent
upon an evaluation of the success
of what Meyer called the "sym
bolic distinction in the admissions
process" that the program pro
vides.
According to several members
of the committee, the revised Jor
dan scholar plan remedies the
controversial areas of last year's
program, striking a compromise
between faculty and student con
cerns.
"There was a strong feeling that
the Jordan scholarship should not
involve public recognition, cere
mony or special access to faculty
or academic resources," Wasow
said. The notification letter sent
to last year's Jordan scholars in
dicated that they would be part
of a program this year recognizing
their academic success, although
Wasow said "I frankly don't think
anybody had any idea what form
the recognition would take."
Wasow added that the only spe
cial treatment the Jordan scholars

have received was a free lunch
with him at the Faculty Club.
Wasow suggested that the
award probably had little influ
ence last year on students' deci
sions to come to Stanford, noting
that at most the distinction may
have given applicants "the confi
dence that they could live up to
Stanford's standards."
Some of this year's freshmen,
however, voiced different
opinions.
Freshman Sandy Aronson said
one of her friends turned Stanford
down largely becuse he was afraid
the Jordan scholar distinction
would "set him apart."
Jordan scholar Craig Grossman
said he did not see the program
as elitist at all, but that the honor
"definitely misled every Jordan
scholar that came here."
Some of the Jordan scholars
said they expected special pro
grams, lectures or preference in
enrollment for classes.
"I think this whole thing has
been a farce," Grossman said. "I
think they lied to everyone who
was a Jordan scholar, because
there is no program and it hasn't
meant anything this year."
