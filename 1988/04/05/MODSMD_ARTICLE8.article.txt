# Dean questions quality of law school education

In trying to address concerns
about the quality of legal educa
tion at Stanford, Law School Dean
Paul Brest said yesterday he is
finding he must question the
foundation of American legal ed
ucation and the traditional law
curriculum.
To grapple with this broad
question that affects every level
of teaching and student life at
Stanford's Law School, Brest in
itially formed the "Task Force on
the Quality of Intellectual Life at
Stanford Law School" last No
vember to identify areas that
must be improved and to make
policy and curriculum recommen
dations.
In mid-April the task force,
which is chaired by Brest, will
hold a public forum to let students
and faculty air their views on the
matter. Early in May the commit
tee hopes to issue a preliminary
report that will suggest "ap
proaches to solutions to these very
real problems," Brest said.
Concerns at the Law School in
clude frustrations about non
attendance at classes, class par
ticipation and grading policies.
Tensions in relations between fac
ulty and students are also being
examined along with fears that
the curriculum for second- and

third-year law students is not suf
ficiently challenging or in-depth.
At the root of these specific con
cerns, Brest is examining a more
far-reaching question: Is the fun
damental purpose of law school
to impart legal theory, or is law
school a technical training ground
to provide students with the skills
for practicing law?
Law schools throughout the na
tion are contending with this
question in various forms, accord
ing to Brest.
First-year law student Sharon
Buccino, who serves on the task
force along with four other law
students and four faculty mem
bers, said this question is one of
the themes underlying the
tensions at Stanford.
The task force has met ir
regularly since it was formed to
identify areas where teaching
methods can be improved and
ways in which students can be
come more engaged in academic
life.
To detect trends and reach a
consensus in students needs, ex
pectations and goals, the commit
tee asked students to fill out an
extensive 12-page survey, which
was due yesterday. M I have the
impression that quite a few stu
dents are spending a long time"
on the questionnaire, Brest said.
