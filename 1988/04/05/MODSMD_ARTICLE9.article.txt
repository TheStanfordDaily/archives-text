# USW protest spurs response
## University retests for possible fiberglass hazard 
### Scott Lyon Staff" writer 
In response to recent protests
by the United Stanford Workers
over exposed fiberglass insula
tion in the mailroom of the Uni
versity's Press Building, Uni
versity officials conducted a
second atmospheric test there
yesterday and expect results
early next week.
Ralph Buchanan, acting dep
uty associate vice president of
Administrative Services and
Facilities, said he hopes the new
test will resolve the controversy
over whether Stanford workers
are being exposed to dangerous
levels of fiberglass and quell un
ion demands. Buchanan said he
believes the first testing was
skewed by "nuisance dust," or
dust left over from the original
ceiling installation in February,
which led to a higher fiberglass
reading.
"If there had been a good
clean-up after the installation,
I'm reasonably confident there
would have been no com
plaints," he said in an interview
Thursday. "Once properly se
cured, fiberglass insulation is
not a problem."
Gene Kershner, associate di
rector of University Project
Management, echoed Buchan
an's statements. According to
Kershner, fiberglass insulation
is relatively common in newer
buildings because it is good
"from an energy-saving point of
view." State codes require that
buildings have insulation as an
energy-conservation measure
and fiberglass is frequently used
for that purpose, he said.
Aside from the USW's recent
complaints about fiberglass in
the Press Building, Kershner
said that to his knowledge no
other complaints have been filed
on campus about possible fiber
glass exposure.
Problems arose at the Press
Building when workers began
complaining about the "poor"

installation job done by an out
side contractor in February. Ac
cording to a union flier, pink
fiberglass had been "floating
down on employees for weeks."
USW representatives, frus
trated by what they called the
"bureaucratic runaround"
about the hazard, held a dem

onstration on March 25 to air
their grievances to University
Project Management officials.
They gathered outside the Old
Pavilion with placards that
charged officials with "putting
costs before health and safety."

Hoping to assuage USW con
cerns, the University's Project
Management Office agreed to the
second test after union officials
disputed the findings of a test
conducted on March 17 by the

Fireman's Fund Insurance Com
panies.
The original test reported a fi
berglass level of .03 milligrams
per cubic meter in the area â€” far
below federal minimum set at 15
milligrams, but not safe enough
for union representatives.
After consulting with the Oc
cupational Clinic of San Francisco
General Hospital and the Califor

nia State Occupational Health
and Safety Administration, Jones
argued the level should be as close
to zero as possible. "We're con
cerned about the possibility of
lung cancer," he said.
Since the original test, manage
ment has cleaned the office twice.
They have also had additional
contract work done as recently as
last Friday, to seal cracks in the
ceiling more tightly.
