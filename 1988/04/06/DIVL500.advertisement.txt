RESIDENTIAL EDUCATION SCREENING DATES OF
"STAR WARS RESEARCH: A UNIVERSITY PERSPECTIVE"
In order to examine the effects of Strategic Defense Initiative research at Stanford, a
non-partisan student group produced this balanced video-documentary which contains
interviews with Stanford faculty and graduate students including Sidney Drell, Terry
Winograd, Donald Kennedy, John Madey, Bernard Roth, and John McCarthy, some of
whom approve and some of whom disapprove of SDI funding for university research. A
well-informed moderator will present this even-handed 39-minute video and then lead a
20-minute discussion in Stanford residences throughout the campus. There is no doubt that
this video-documentary will both educate and intellectually stimulate.
