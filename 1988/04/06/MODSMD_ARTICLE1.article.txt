# Administration recommends Roble renovation
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Seventy-year-old Roble Hall,
which was evacuated last Decem
ber because of structural defects,
will be renovated to decrease its
chances of collapse during an
earthquake, according to John
Hughes, assistant provost in the
Office of Planning and Manage
ment.
For the last three months, the
University has been trying to
decide whether to raze or renovate
the dorm. The University Office
of Facilities Project Management
has recommended a plan to
renovate Roble.

The recom
mendation, the
first step in
gaining approval
of the project, will
be introduced to
the Administra
tive Council
today and, if
passed, will then
be presented to

the Board of Trustees for final
approval.
If approved, Hughes said con
struction should begin in May and
be complete by September 1989.
The project is expected to cost
between $6 million and $7 million.
Hughes said funding for the im

provements will come from the
Facilities Project Management Of
fice, which has surplus savings in
a reserve operating budget. Be
cause the University spent less
than anticipated from this budget,
the money will be used to finance
a loan to pay for a large part of
the restoration.
Former Roble resident assistant
Jack Alden called the decision to
renovate Roble "fantastic." Alden,
along with the assistance of some
other Roble RAs, last quarter es
tablished a fund to help finance
the reconstruction.
The purpose of the fund, said
Alden, was to show "trustees and
administrators that there is sup

port within the Stanford student
and alumni population to keep
Roble and restore it."
The group raised $1,600 for the
fund through a letter-writing
campaign.
Assoc. Director of Project Man
agement Earl Kershner said the
dormitory, which can accommo
date 296 students, will be
stabilized against earthquakes
through a "tower scheme."
In the current plan, two rooms
in each wing will be filled with
concrete from the basement to the
third floor to form an "elevator
shaft" structure.
This shaft will create a "tower"
that Kershner said will act as a

pected to cost be
tween $6 million and
$7 million.

stabilizing influence in the event
of an earthquake. In addition,
reinforced concrete columns will
be constructed to support the
central wing of Roble. The cost
of the tower scheme is expected
to run about $5.8 million.
Kershner said clay tiles on the
outside of the building will not

be anchored down, as previously
proposed. Although during an
earthquake tiles would fall to the
street below, the stucco wall on
Roble's exterior should prevent
them from falling inside the build
ing, Kershner said. Also, because
of Roble's increased stability, the
building should not rock as much
during an earthquake and thus
fewer tiles would fall off.
Kershner called the project a
"life-safety scheme."
Besides the construction of the
stabilizing towers, there will be
other general renovations, such
as improvements on the sewer
and water systems and in the
kitchen, Kershner said.
