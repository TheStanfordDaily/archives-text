# Decision on CIV impacts nation
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
The impact of Stanford's
debate over the Area One re
quirement — finally ended last
week when the Faculty Senate
decided to revise the program
— is beginning to be felt at
colleges and universities
around the nation.
The debate here continues to
spur discussion at several
schools. At UC-Berkeley, the
academic senate is now debat
ing a proposal to make the
breadth requirement — the
Berkeley equivalent of Area
One — more ethnically diverse.
Columbia University added a
non-Western culture require
ment to its core program last
month, and is currently evalu
ating the program as a whole.
And Brown University may
soon ask its students to con
sider a new "blueprint" for
study.
Some schools have already
taken steps to up their offer
ings of classes that study non-
Western cultures. UC-Santa
Cruz has had a Third World
requirement since 1986. Har
vard University requires the
study of a foreign culture as
part of its core, and most Har
vard students fulfill this re
quirement by taking a class
focusing on a non-Western cul
ture.
At some schools, Stanford's
debate seems to have had little
effect. The University of
Chicago, for example — the
home of Allan Bloom, author
of the academically-con
servative book "The Closing of
the American Mind" — has a

traditional Eurocentric pro
gram and no plans to change it.
Stanford's "great debate"
has been heard most clearly
across the Bay. For the past
three years, several student
groups at Berkeley have been
urging the faculty to offer eth
nic studies courses as alterna
tive means of fulfilling the
Berkeley requirement.
According to Michael Stoll,
chair of the Berkeley African
Student Association, the
Berkeley requirement "focuses
on the European cultural ex
perience from a Western point
of view."
The class is normally fulfilled
by history courses, and the
number of required courses
varies slightly from one disci
pline to another. The Berkeley
breadth requirement is usually
fulfilled by students during
their freshman year, as is the
Area One requirement.
The Berkeley debate over the
breadth requirement has been
brought to the academic senate
and a committee was formed
to draw up a proposal, accord
ing to Anthropology Prof. W.S.
Simmons, chair of the Berkeley
Academic Senate Special Com
mittee on Education and Eth
nicity.
"The California case is a
little bit different from the
Stanford case," Simmons said.
"We are not trying to restruc
ture an existing program. We
are starting off with something
new."
Stoll said Stanford's decision
will certainly have an effect on
the debate at Berkeley.
