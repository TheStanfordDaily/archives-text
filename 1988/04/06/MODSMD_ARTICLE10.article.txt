# Decision on CIV impacts nation
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
The impact of Stanford's
debate over the Area One re
quirement — finally ended last
week when the Faculty Senate
decided to revise the program
— is beginning to be felt at
colleges and universities
around the nation.
The debate here continues to
spur discussion at several
schools. At UC-Berkeley, the
academic senate is now debat
ing a proposal to make the
breadth requirement — the
Berkeley equivalent of Area
One — more ethnically diverse.
Columbia University added a
non-Western culture require
ment to its core program last
month, and is currently evalu
ating the program as a whole.
And Brown University may
soon ask its students to con
sider a new "blueprint" for
study.
Some schools have already
taken steps to up their offer
ings of classes that study non-
Western cultures. UC-Santa
Cruz has had a Third World
requirement since 1986. Har
vard University requires the
study of a foreign culture as
part of its core, and most Har
vard students fulfill this re
quirement by taking a class
focusing on a non-Western cul
ture.
At some schools, Stanford's
debate seems to have had little
effect. The University of
Chicago, for example — the
home of Allan Bloom, author
of the academically-con
servative book "The Closing of
the American Mind" — has a

traditional Eurocentric pro
gram and no plans to change it.
Stanford's "great debate"
has been heard most clearly
across the Bay. For the past
three years, several student
groups at Berkeley have been
urging the faculty to offer eth
nic studies courses as alterna
tive means of fulfilling the
Berkeley requirement.
According to Michael Stoll,
chair of the Berkeley African
Student Association, the
Berkeley requirement "focuses
on the European cultural ex
perience from a Western point
of view."
The class is normally fulfilled
by history courses, and the
number of required courses
varies slightly from one disci
pline to another. The Berkeley
breadth requirement is usually
fulfilled by students during
their freshman year, as is the
Area One requirement.
The Berkeley debate over the
breadth requirement has been
brought to the academic senate
and a committee was formed
to draw up a proposal, accord
ing to Anthropology Prof. W.S.
Simmons, chair of the Berkeley
Academic Senate Special Com
mittee on Education and Eth
nicity.
"The California case is a
little bit different from the
Stanford case," Simmons said.
"We are not trying to restruc
ture an existing program. We
are starting off with something
new."
Stoll said Stanford's decision
will certainly have an effect on
the debate at Berkeley.
"The Stanford decision gives
(Berkeley) students that are push
ing to get courses in ethnic studies
more legitimacy," Stoll said.
Stoll said the Berkeley associa
tion has followed the Stanford
debate closely in recent months
and called the Faculty Senate's
recent decision an "inspiration."
Simmons said the Berkeley
committee is also examining
similar curriculum debates or
changes at Brown University, the
University of Wisconsin, the Uni
versity of Minnesota and UC-
Santa Cruz. He predicted the
Berkeley debate will culminate at
the end of this year or early next
year.
At Brown, though there are no
general education or distribution
requirements as such, the faculty
is currently considering a proposal
that would provide a "blueprint
for ideal study," according to Rus
sell Goodnow, associate registrar
there.
Brown's blueprint, which will
be voted on later this month,
would be broadly based and pre
sented to students as a recom
mendation, not a requirement.
The proposed blueprint recom
mends the study of non-Western
cultures.

Other universities around the
country did not necessarily keep
the close watch on the Stanford
debate some schools did.
The University of Chicago is
one of the last mtyor academic
institutions in the country which
offers a traditional, Eurocentric
survey of modern cultural origins.
At Chicago, there are 21 general
education courses that all stu
dents are required to take. Under
the auspices of general education,
students must take a year-long
civilization track similar to the
Area One requirement.
Students can fulfill this require
ment by studying either Western
or non-Western cultures, but
about 50 percent of the students
fulfill the requirement by taking
a course called "Western Civiliza
tion," according to Louis Fortner,
director of Chicago's Foreign
Studies Programs.
"There is no non-male, non-
European culture requirement,
though we probably could use
one," Fortner said.
However, Fortner said a change
is unlikely for a variety of reasons.
Student outcry on the issue has
been nearly nonexistent. Area
studies programs at Chicago, con
centrating on such regions as
Latin America and East Asia, are
very strong and give students
ample opportunity to specialize in
non-Western cultures.
