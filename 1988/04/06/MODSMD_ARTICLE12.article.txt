Man wanted by DEA is arrested
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Honduran
Juan Ballesteros, wanted in the United States
for questioning in the 1985 torture and murder
of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent
in Mexico, was arrested yesterday by the Hon
duran military on drug trafficking charges.
NBC News reported that Matta was turned
over to U.S. marshals and was en route to
the United States despite a constitutional
prohibition against the extradition of Hon
duran citizens.
DEA officials have accused Matta of taking
part in the killing of agent Enrique Salazar
three years ago and also have sought to link
the Honduran to Panamanian strongman Gen.
Manuel Noriega, who was indicted by two U.S.
grand juries on drug charges.
The arrest was made as a Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee chaired by John Ker
ry, D-Mass., prepared to address charges of
Honduran involvement in drug trafficking.
Honduran military officers have come under
suspicion of complicity in drug smuggling op
erations between Colombia and the United
States. The arrest of Matta, who reportedly
maintained close ties with high-ranking mili
tary officers here, may have been an effort to
dispel growing concerns in Washington that
Honduran military officers had accepted bribes
from Matta and allowed their country to be
come a major conduit for cocaine.
A Honduran source familiar with drug in
vestigations said that some military officers
here are worried that Matta will not hesitate
to implicate several of them in massive drug
dealing once he is interrogated by U.S. officials.
Matta is accused of being one of the most
important connections between Colombia's
Medellin drug cartel and Mexican smugglers
who transport drugs into the United States.
Cruise missiles key to treaty
MOSCOW — Moscow's top nuclear arms
control official said here yesterday that no
strategic-arms treaty with the United States
is possible without agreement on limiting
thousands of U.S. nuclear and conventionally
armed cruise missiles aboard ships and sub
marines.
In an interview here, Viktor Karpov, chief
of the Disarmament Department of the Soviet
Foreign Ministry, claimed that verifiable re
strictions on these missiles must be an integral
part of a planned 50 percent reduction in the
long-range, land- and submarine-based missile
forces of both superpowers.
Karpov made clear that without such an
accord, no treaty limiting nuclear arms was
likely to be signed at the forthcoming summit
meeting here between President Reagan and
Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev
beginning May 29. Karpov gave no indication
of possible Soviet concessions in this area.
He said that while there were other un
resolved issues in the arms negotiations, es
pecially disagreement over the terms of con
tinuation of the 1972 U.S.-Soviet anti-ballistic
missile (ABM) treaty, the sea-launched cruise
missile issue is proving "to be the most difficult
up to now."
Karpov said it was made clear to him by a
top-level Reagan administration official that
the U.S. Navy would never allow Soviet in
spectors on its submarines to check on these
weapons.
The U.S. Navy is said to be building some
4,000 cruise missiles, some with conventional
explosive warheads and others armed with
atomic warheads, and plans to deploy them
on ships and submarines
Ever since these weapons were first
developed in the 19705, questions have been
raised about how they might eventually be
controlled in an arms agreement since it is
hard to keep track of them and distinguish
between conventional and nuclear versions.
Japanese police seize records
TOKYO — Japanese police yesterday raided
the offices of several companies suspected of
illegally shipping high-technology items of po
tential military usefulness to China.
The police seized documents from two small
trading companies and the Iwatsu Electric Co.,
a manufacturer of sophisticated measuring
devices. Officials said they believed the trading
firms illegally and knowingly sold a number
of devices that could be adapted to measure
the effects of nuclear weapons, capture and
analyze submarine sound waves, or improve
missile guidance systems.
All of the products were on a list of items
prohibited for sale by Western countries to
communist nations, according to officials and
press accounts here.
The disclosure of the case came about one
year after the first revelations that Toshiba
Machine Co. had illegally shipped technology
that could be of military use to the Soviet
Union. Like that case, the new investigation
was prompted by a tip from the U.S. govern
ment, according to Japanese officials.
The fallout from the Toshiba Machine case
continues to be a irritant in U.S.-
Japanese relations. Congress recently attached
an anti-Toshiba provision to its pending trade
bill, prompting angry protests from Tokyo.
The minister of trade and industry, Htyime
Tamura, told U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield
yesterday that the Japanese government
knows that revelations of a new scandal in
volving shipments to communist nations could
prejudice Japan's case in the Toshiba matter.
Tamura said that Japan's active investiga
tion, undertaken despite that risk, demon
strates its commitment to stem the illegal flow
of sensitive technology, according to an official
of Tamura's ministry.
