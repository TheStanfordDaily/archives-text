# Dukakis takes solid lead in Wisconsin

MILWAUKEE — Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, fighting to re
establish himself as the Democratic
front-runner, took a strong lead over
the Rev. Jesse Jackson in returns from
yesterday's Wisconsin primary.
A few minutes after the polls closed
at 8 p.m. EDT, ABC and CBS news
both projected Dukakis as the winner.
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was
in third place with Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon bringing up the rear.
With 25 perecent of the vote
counted, the results were Dukakis 47
percent, Jackson 31 percent, Gore 15
percent, and Simon 4 percent.
Vice President George Bush, whose
only opponent was former religious
broadcaster Pat Robertson, was ex
pected to win easily on the Republican
side.
NBC news polling of some 2,400
voters as they left the voting booths
indicated that most regarded Dukakis
as the leader of the pack despite the
strong performance in recent prima
ries by Jackson, who leads in the na
tional popular vote and is close behind
Dukakis in the count of national con
vention delegates.
About two-thirds of those inter

viewed, including about 40 percent of
Jackson's supporters, said they believe
Dukakis will be the ultimate Demo
cratic nominee and more than 6 in 10
think he would be the strongest Dem
ocrat to run against Bush in Novem
ber.
On the other hand, about 40 percent
of Dukakis' own supporters wish
someone else were running and only
half think he cares about people like
them.
Jackson appeared to be taking about
25 percent of the white vote, slightly
higher than the figure he took in the
Connecticut primary last week. But
fewer than half of Jackson's support
ers think he would be the strongest
Democratic standard bearer in Novem
ber.
About half of the Jackson supporters
think the country is ready to elect a
black president.
The Wisconsin primary took on
added importance because of the
March 26 caucuses in Michigan, in
which Jackson stunned the political
world by defeating Dukakis 2-1 in the
popular vote and won a majority of
the 138 delegates at stake.
The Michigan results, coming on the

heels of Dukakis* third-place finish in
the March 15 Illinois primary,
seriously undermined claims of his
supporters that his nomination was
inevitable and raised questions about
his ability to get support from blue
collar voters.
For Jackson, Michigan, of course,
had the opposite effect. It greatly en
hanced respect for the overall strength
of his campaign, specifically his ability
to attract white voters. Although there
were no exit polls, estimates based on
his showing in some white communi
ties ranged as high as 30 percent.
Just as Wisconsin turned into a test
ing ground for the strengths and weak
nesses of the candidates as revealed
by Michigan, it also served as a
curtain-raiser for the April 19 primary
in New York — the biggest state con
test so far — in which 255 delegates
will be at stake, better than 10 percent
of the 2,082 needed for a nominating
majority.
Dukakis helped his cause in Wiscon
sin by winning the Connecticut pri
mary March 29 with more than 58
percent of the vote. Even though his
first-place finish in the state bordering
on his own Massachusetts was ex

pected, the size of the victory margin
eased some of the sting of Michigan.
Immediately after Michigan, Duka
kis said he would not change his can
didacy because of his defeats there and
in Illinois. But if he did not make
substantive changes, he did alter his
tone, apparently responding to
criticism that his message lacked force
and vitality.
