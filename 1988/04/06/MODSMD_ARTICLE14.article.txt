### 
CAIRO, Egypt â€” Arab gun
men seeking the release of 17
convicted terrorists imprisoned
in Kuwait hijacked a Kuwait
Airways jumbo jet and forced
it to fly to Iran, where they
threatened to kill several mem
bers of the Kuwaiti royal family
who were among the 112
hostage passengers and crew
members.
Early today, following a
tense standoff between the
hijackers and security forces
blocking the runway, the offi
cial Iranian news agency IRNA
reported that the hijackers had
released 24 women passengers
after negotiations* with Deputy
Prime Minister Alireza
Moayeri.
Earlier, the hijackers re
leased a Jordanian business
man with a heart condition
who told authorities that there
were "five or six" gunmen
aboard the plane, all armed
with pistols and hand grenades.
In Kuwait, officials con
firmed that three members of
the royal family, all distant
relatives of Kuwaiti ruler Sheik
Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah,
were on board Flight KU 422.
The Boeing 747 was hijacked
several hours after taking off
from Bangkok, Thailand, for
Kuwait yesterday morning.
Airline officials said that
more than two-thirds of the

passengers were foreigners, in
cluding 20 Britons and an
American who was said to have
dual U.S.-Egyptian citizenship.
The hijackers forced the
plane to change course while
it was over the Gulf of Oman
and to fly to the northeastern
Iranian city of Mashhad near
the Soviet border.
More than 12 hours after
landing at Mashhad airport,
where Iranian security forces
sealed off the runway to
prevent the plane from depart
ing, the hijackers issued a
statement demanding the
release of 17 Shia Moslems
jailed in Kuwait for various ter
rorist offenses.
"They (the hijackers) an
nounced that a number of in
dividuals related to Kuwait's
al Sabah family are among the
passengers and would be in im
minent danger if the Kuwaiti
government does not reply to
their requests," Tehran Radio
reported.
The Iranian news agency
IRNA added that the hijackers,
who did not divulge their iden
tities or say what group they
belonged to, had asked Iran to
either mediate on their behalf
with Kuwait or to allow the
plane to refuel and take off for
another, as yet undisclosed,
destination.
