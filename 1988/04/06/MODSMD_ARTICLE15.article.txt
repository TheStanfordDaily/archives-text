# U.S. troops land in Panama

PANAMA CITY, Panama — A war of
nerves between the United States and
Panama's military strongman Gen. Manuel
Noriega took shape yesterday as newly dis
patched American troops landed in the
country and the Panamanian military
began training neighborhood militias to
defend the city.
The streets of Panama City grew tense
again as Noriega's soldiers moved to divert
protesters from holding anti-government
rallies. For the first time, a demonstration
against Noriega took place in what was
formerly the U.S. Canal Zone.
Noriega's police blocked roads leading to
the canal, disrupting traffic to the vital
waterway.
At the same time, the Roman Catholic
Church hinted at a breakthrough in its
efforts to mediate talks between Noriega
and his foes. The church announced that
the government had given its assurances
that the church could serve as mediator.
It was not clear, however, whether the
bishops had dropped their call that Noriega
step down.
The arrival of the U.S. began modestly.
The first 22 soldiers, from the 118 th mil
itary police company stationed at Fort
Bragg, N.C., landed at Howard Air Force
Base near the Pacific end of the Panama
Canal shortly before 5 p.m.
In all, a fresh contingent of 1,300 U.S.
soldiers, including 300 Marines, is sched
uled to arrive by Thursday. Seven heavily
armed Cobra helicopter gunships are also
said to be en route.
The U.S. troops were ordered to Panama
by the Pentagon to protect Americans who
live in the country as well as U.S. bases
that line the Panama Canal. The United
States already stations about 10,000 sol
diers here at bases under the control of
the Southern Command.
In response to the move, the Panamanian
government has begun to whip up a mea

sure of war hysteria.
Bold headlines in government newspa
pers predict imminent invasion. Govern
ment radio broadcasts incessant rounds of
martial and folk music.
The government Health Ministry issued
a warning that U.S. troops carried AIDS.
Referring to the newly arrived troops, the
communique requested that "our popula
tion abstain from any intimate contact with
these units."
Officers under Noriega's command or
ganized what they described as basic train
ing drills for civilians. About 160 potential
militiamen gathered for the training ses
sion yesterday at a dank army gymnasium
next to Noriega's headquarters and then
at a nearby baseball stadium.
Some of the civilians said they were
recruited by government-affiliated political
parties. Others said they had volunteered
spontaneously.
"Why doesn't (President) Reagan come
here and fight his own battles? Why make
the people of Panama suffer?" said Ruth
Lopez, one of 40 women who enlisted in
the militia.
The civilians shouted "Yankee animals,
get out of Panama" and other anti-
American slogans. A calisthenics leader
shouted", "The Americans may invade at
any minute!"
The group seemed ill-prepared for a
morning of jogging and marching. The men
wore their street shoes and work pants
and sweated heavily under the hot sun.
The platoon of women was equally
awkward. One brought her two small
children along, while another lost her cot
ton espadrilles as she jogged for the first
time, and a third shed her patent-leather
pumps in order not to scuff them.
"These citizens will defend their territory
to the death," said Maj. Cesar Dominguez,
who was in charge of the training.
