# Delvalle, may quit; disillusioned with U.S. efforts
## 
### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama - The
man the United States recognizes as
Panama's legal president has become
fed up with U.S. policy toward his
country and has threatened to resign
from his clandestine post if decisive
steps are not taken soon to oust
Panama's de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel
Noriega, informed sources here said
yesterday.
Eric Delvalle, who was deposed as
Panama's civilian president Feb. 26
and fled into hiding the next day, has
grown increasingly impatient with the
failure of U.S. economic sanctions to
bring down Noriega, according to op
position leaders, family members and
diplomats in contact with him.
The sanctions have severely
squeezed Panama's economy, bringing
on strikes by workers and creating
hunger among some of the country's
poorest citizens.

But the sanctions have yet to shake
Noriega, who has survived protests
and a barracks coup attempt in his
determination to cling to power.
Last week, Delvalle expressed in bit
ter terms his "disillusionment," said
a diplomat in touch with both Delvalle
and U.S. officials here. "He has told
the U.S. that if they do not immedi
ately act, he would go," the diplomat
said.
A top opposition leader said that
Delvalle has demanded that the United
States make efforts to oust Noriega
this week or he will come out of hiding
and give up his rump presidency.
In Washington, a senior State De
partment official acknowledged that
Delvalle was "disillusioned" but said,
"I really don't think he's going to
quit."
"We do know that he has been de
pressed and angry at times. So would

you or I be if we spent five weeks in
a cellar," he said. However, the official
added, "I don't think it's anything
more than a mood."
Diplomatic sources said that the
U.S. ambassador to Panama, Arthur
Davis, met with people in contact with
Delvalle on at least three occasions
last week.
An abdication by Delvalle would
complicate efforts by the Reagan ad
ministration to force Noriega out of
office and out of Panama. Courts in
the United States have frozen Pana
manian government bank accounts in
Delvalle's name. The court decisions
are based on the continued recognition
by the State Department of Delvalle's
claim to the presidency.
Delvalle lost his job after trying to
dismiss Noriega from the command of
the Panama Defense Forces, the coun
try's military establishment. He went

into hiding after his ouster, although
he has communicated publicly by cas
sette recordings, videotape and letters.
His wife, Mariela, took refuge in the
residence of the U.S. ambassador.
Some sources in touch with Delvalle
say they doubt he would step down.
"He will never quit," said one family
member.
However, the same sources noted
that his family is becoming increas
ingly uncomfortable with their own
internal exile.
Before becoming president, Delvalle
was a wealthy businessman and his
family owns one of Panama's largest
sugar mills. Family members say they
have received veiled threats that the
property might be confiscated.
Delvalle has also been charged with
sedition by Noriega's government.
