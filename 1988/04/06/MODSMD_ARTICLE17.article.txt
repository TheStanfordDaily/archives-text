# Restrictions blamed for delay in Nicaragua talks
## 
### 
MIAMI — Contra leaders yesterday
rejected restrictive conditions set by
the Sandinista government of Nicara
gua for the next round of peace talks
and said they would not go to Managua
at all for the talks unless they could
move about and speak freely.
One of the Contras' directors, Adolfo
Calero, who was named yesterday to
be the rebels' chief negotiator at the
talks, made public a letter from
Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco that spells out
government plans to isolate the Contra
delegation in a government-owned
hotel near the airport and to limit the
rebels' outside contacts to "personal
visits."
"We are to be allowed to receive
personal visits as if we are prisoners,"
said fellow rebel director Pedro Joa
quin Chamorro, who appeared with
Calero at a news conference at Contra
headquarters here.
Calero added: "We are demanding
that we be free while we are in Nic

aragua. Our visit was to be virtual
imprisonment at the hotel. That is not
in keeping with the idea of reconcili
ation, the idea of democratization."
Calero said the Contra leadership
has sent the Sandinistas a detailed
itinerary that his delegation of about
60, including all five of the rebel
group's directors, intends to follow
April 12-15 in Managua. The itinerary
includes meetings with Nicaraguan
church officials, opposition political
groups, the country's permanent com
mission on human rights and the be
leaguered opposition newspaper, La
Prensa.
The Contra proposal also rejects the
Las Mercedes Hotel near the airport
and suggests 50 double rooms at the
Intercontinental Hotel in downtown
Managua.
Calero said his group, known for
mally as the Nicaraguan Resistance,
has further demanded that it be al
lowed to publish its itinerary in paid
advertisements in government and op

position periodicals.
He said the agreement reached last
month in Sapoa, Nicaragua, between
the Sandinistas and Contras, which
set up a 60-day cease-fire, guaranteed
rebel negotiators the freedom to move
about and see whom they wish while
they are in the Nicaraguan capital.
In the letter, Tinoco had written:
"Any type of political activity, outside
of the framework and objectives of the
Managua meeting, we would consider
counterproductive."
In Sapoa, Sandinista and Contra of
ficials resumed talks yesterday to map
the last two of seven cease-fire zones
into rules on the separation of their
forces. The Contras broke off those
talks in Sapoa a week ago, saying they
needed more time to explain the peace
accord to their troops.
While acknowledging scattered vio
lations of the truce that began March
21, both sides had been playing them
down. Yesterday, however, the Con
tras accused the Sandinistas of staging

systematic attacks in four of the coun
try's 18 provinces.
Bosco Matamoros, a rebel spokes
man, said the Sandinista offenses in
cluded bombardments of civilian
settlements in Nueva Segovia, Cho
tales, Jinotega and Zelaya provinces.
President Daniel Ortega, speaking
Monday in Managua, accused the Con
tras of stalling in the follow-up nego
tiations. He said the rebel strategy
was influenced by a new U.S. commit
ment of non-lethal aid last week, which
will permit their army to survive in
the field during prolonged political ne
gotiations.
Meanwhile, the Contra agenda calls
for six meetings with the government
delegation during three days of polit
ical talks in Managua.
"It will be the Sandinistas' acid
test," Calero said. "It will be very dif
ficult for them to keep the agreement
and hold on to power."
