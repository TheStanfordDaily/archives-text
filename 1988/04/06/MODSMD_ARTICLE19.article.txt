WITH RUSH upon us, the
Interfraternity Council
and the Intersorority
Council seem to have forgotten
their well-publicized vows earlier
this year to combat racism and
homophobia in the University's
Greek system. Instead, their goal
seems to be improving their own
image.
In November, the IFC met with
representatives of the Stanford Or
ganization for Lesbian and Gay
Equality and agreed to publish the
University's official non-discrim
ination policy in all Rush materi
als. The Rushbook is out, but due
to an apparent oversight, the non
discrimination policy was omitted.
How serious can the IFC and ISC
be about making minorities com
fortable during Rush if they forget
to do something so simple?
Also in November, IFC president
Vinnie Frost began publicizing the
special ISC-IFC Committee on the
Promotion of Diversity; Frost said
at the time that this group would
"promote greater fraternal under
standing of participation in minor
ity issues — not only to enlighten
fraternal attitudes, but to interest
minorities in the system so we can
add to the diversity the system
already enjoys."
Three months later, in Febru
ary, the committee (which had by
then changed its name to the Com
mittee on Cultural Relations) cir
culated a letter urging fraternities
to plan events, parties and other
activities with campus minority
groups. It does not seem to have
done anything in the intervening
period.
At the meeting in November, the
IFC and ISC also agreed to en
courage fraternities and sororities
to invite the Lesbian, Gay and
Bisexual Speakers Bureau to ad

dress their members. In February,
the gay community, noting that no
fraternities or sororities had yet
requested a presentation by the
Speakers Bureau, sent a letter to
the IFC repeating its offer to send
speakers to the fraternities.
Finally, on Feb. 17, the Sigma
Chi fraternity hosted a Lesbian,
Gay and Bisexual Speakers Bureau
presentation. Since then, four
other fraternities have followed
suit, and one more presentation is
scheduled for this week. No
sororities have yet expressed inter
est in the program.
Although much delayed, this
positive response by some frater
nities is encouraging. However,
these few presentations represent
only token progress. Unfortunate
ly, the burden of breaking down
barriers of intolerance has rested
overwhelmingly on the gay com
munity.
In the area of improving rela
tions with the ethnic minority com
munity, the Greek system has ac
complished even less. Other than
promising to help out with the
Stanford Indian Pow-Wow later
this month, the ISC-IFC Commit
tee on Cultural Relations has so
far done little more than vaguely
endorse increased communication
between the Greek and minority
communities.
It is time the Greek community
recognized the need for change and
acted upon it. Only active commit
ment from both sides can succeed
in achieving lasting progress.
The Greek system needs to move
beyond tokenism and appease
ment. The stated goals of Greek
life — friendship, sisterhood and
brotherhood, fun and public serv
ice — should be available to all
students, regardless of race or
sexual orientation.
