## Noise level at Meyer Library makes study difficult 
### 
AS WE START yet another quar
ter, memories of last quarters'
finals haunt me, and the experi
ences I had trying to study at the
Meyer Library are still vivid in my
mind.
"Library: A place in which literary
and artistic materials such as books,
periodicals, newspapers, pamphlets and
prints are kept for reading or refer
ence."
At least that was what most of the
dictionaries in Meyer Library said
except that they were all erroneous
and misleading by deleting the phrase
"except Meyer, the so-called library."
I looked under "M" for a definition
of that particular institution but I
couldn't find one. So I thought, "Mr.
Webster, here is an enlightening defini
tion for the above mentioned site on

Stanford campus and readers, correct
me if I am wrong: 'Meyer Library: a
gathering place for a minority of
serious students along with herds of
rude, self-centered and uncourteous
students who come to discuss love
affairs, drinking parties, clothes and
enjoy giggling as an intermission be
tween 15-minute recitals of let-go
frustration laughter.' "
Did I make my point clear? Well,
here is more: "It could also be re
garded as a place were people throw
all sorts of things at each other —
papers, candy wrap and the like —
just to be cool (whatever that void
word is supposed to refer to or
mean)."
It has a complete collection of empty
soda cans left behind by the Stanford

Dudes who quite frequently remind me
of pigs for some esophagal sound they
so boastingly produce (barfing is what
they call it). It is a place where people
are kind enough to expose the sole of
their shoes (or feet as you can hardly
tell the difference most of the times)
on the table.
Of course, newcomers will have to
use the table that was kindly hugging
the lower extremities of those peoples'
bodies. Of course if you didn't get the
picture yet, then you might as well
give that "stable" a visit: The tour is
free.
Just flash your "cool" Stanford I.D.
at the door and you are in for some
thing wild. By the way, you can't be
let in unless you have some candy,
soda and potato chips on you. It is a
qualification you must meet.

Am I fed up? You bet. I am up to
my ears with smart fellows who go
there for anything that is otherwise
executed in the lounge of a dormitorv.
a cafeteria or a park. A library is what
Meyer is not.
I suggest that a course be offered to
those students teaching them appropri
ate behavior in public places: They
seem to take everyone around them for
granted. My advice to those students
is: Get educated on some of these
issues or else stay at home and mis
behave in the privacy of your own
room. Not everybody is obliged to put
up with your your egocentricity nor
are they willing to kindly ask you to
shut up.
