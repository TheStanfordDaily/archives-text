# Flicks film was racist
## 
### 
While I am generally hesitant to
decry every act of insensitivity as "rac
ism," the 1973 film shown at ASSU
Sunday Flicks March 6, "The Stoned
Ranger," contained an unbelievably
stereotypical image of a black man as
a domestic to be looked down upon,
and a similar image of a Native Ameri
can woman as a peripheral "Injun"
character to be abused.
While these two characters were
clearly mistreated by the antagonist in
the plot, the film did not resolve its
own fundamentally pejorative portrayal
of the characters.
As soon as a Native American friend
of mine two seats down saw the
stereotyped depiction of the Native
American character in the film, I
heard her quietly gasp in suppressed
pain.
The Flicks audience, for the most
part, also hissed and booed at these

unacceptably insulting portrayals of
minorities. But some people cheered.
Given the general sensitivity of
people on this campus to these types
of insults, only one question remains
for the Flicks managers who chose this
unamusing, insensitive film short:
Why?
