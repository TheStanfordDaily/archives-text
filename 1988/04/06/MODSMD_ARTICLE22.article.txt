# Tenure process needs to reflect population

I noted with interest the Faculty
Program Analysis that appeared in the
Jan. 20 Campus Report.
Statistics included in the faculty
profile indicate that, e.g., the increase
in tenure-line faculty for women has
been approximately 2.5 percent in the
last 10 years (10.6 percent, as com
pared to 8.02 percent in 1977).
Granting the reasonable assumption

that the desirable goal would be
around 50 percent women, at the rate
of 2.6 percent every 10 years, it would
take another 160 years for Stanford to
reach some sort of equality.
The rate of increase for minorities is
even worse at 1.2 percent per 10 years.
Stanford is presumably no slower than
other universities in this regard, but
perhaps it could be a little less self
satisfied.
