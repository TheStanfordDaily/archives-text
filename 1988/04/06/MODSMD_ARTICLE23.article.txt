# What exactly is the meaning of T-C-B'?
## 
### 
With RESPECT to Leslie Kaufman's
April 5 column, "A Struggle for
Respect," we are puzzled by a lyric she
attributes to Aretha Franklin. To wit:
"R-E-S-P-E-C-T, find out what it

means to me, R-E-S-P-E-C-T, take care
T-C-B."
What, pray tell, is the meaning of
"T-C-B"? Is it an acronym? A word?
Or some code to which Kaufman alone
is privy?
