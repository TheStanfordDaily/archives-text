## Leave Ed Meese alone 
### 
I J M A REPUBLICAN, yet I truly
dislike Ed Meese. However, what's
been going on in Washington, D.C.
over the past three weeks almost makes
me feel sympathetic toward him.
Yes, Ed Meese has been chosen as the
"Sleaze of the Month" by the super
liberal "Washington insiders," and their
character assassination of Meese has
been disgusting at best, downright un
democratic and unjust at worst.
If you're looking for a typical conser
vative apologist for Ed Meese, you'll have
to look elsewhere. I think he's got serious
problems. Most of those problems, how
ever, have been brought up, repeatedly
rehashed and endlessly investigated by,
among others, two special prosecutors
and the national wolfpack, er, press corps.
Now let's be clear about what a special
prosecutor does. His job is simple and
solitary: to gather poop on someone, then
bring indictments.
Ed Meese has been examined and both
prosecutors have found no basis for any
indictments. Yet, as the Federal Ethics
Office wrote of Ed Meese after the first
investigator came up with no dirt, "He
created the appearance of impropriety."
Just ask Ray Donovan about the "ap
pearance of impropriety." You remember
him. He was President Reagan's first
Secretary of Labor, who was literally
hounded out of office by the same Ed
Meese lynch mob of today.
Donovan was forced to quit his job

amidst a whole slew of accusatory stink
bombs and sleaze campaigns, only to be
acquitted of all charges in court three
harrowing (and expensive!) years later.
As Donovan himself asked sadly after
the three-year ordeal, "Where does one
go to get one's reputation back?" Well,
Ray, I'll tell you. You go home, because
you're not going to get it back.
Ed Meese should stay on as attorney
general. The attacks on Meese may
indeed have once been on the mark, but
the recurring "Get Meese out" tirade is
really about much more than Ed Meese.
It's about affirmative action, conserva
tive judicial nominees, mandatory AIDS
testing, the exclusionary rule and, of
course, Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
Liberal senators and the übiquitous
"Washington insiders" hate all of the
above and are attacking Meese to weaken
the Justice Department in its final
Reagan months. The attacks are trans
parent, the motives crystal clear.
To top it all off, the Überal media loves
the Meese brouhaha. They're running
out of juicy stories about the election. I
mean, how many ways can they say
"George Bush will win all 50 states?"
Ed Meese has had to battle groundless
charges for seven years now and each
time the cycle is the same: accusations,
then media stories, inquiries, investiga
tions, calls for resignation and finally no
basis for indictments is uncovered by the
special prosecutor.

Let's be clear. Ed Meese is not the
world's smartest man. In fact, one thing
the prosecutors have uncovered is that
Meese is repeatedly used and misused by
"friends" and "associates." Yet this is
not a foundation for the endless attacks
Meese has withstood over seven years.
It brings back sad memories of the
brilliant Judge Robert Bork, whose
record was smeared like finger paint to
overturn his Supreme Court confirma
tion in a liberal firestorm where the mo
tives were equally appalling and disin
genious.
Do yourself a favor and search every
paper you can find for the actual charges
against Meese. What is he really accused
of and where's the proof? You'll find
nothing specific and like it.
In a pitiful effort to blacken the Reagan
presidency, liberals have forgotten that
people (even Ed Meese) are innocent until
proven guilty. Just ask Ray Donovan.
