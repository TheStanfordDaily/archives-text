## Obsessive love: Experts study the seduction 
### Dee Dee Weale 
It is no accident that perfumes like
Obsession by Calvin Klein and Poison by
Christian Dior have the names they do.
Advertisers flood us with subliminal
seduction that plays on our inner desires
and obsessive tendencies. The media con
stantly bombards us with both fictional
and true stories of obsessed lovers.
Obsessive love is not even a new phe
nomenon here on the Farm. What is new,
though, is the prevalence and stylishness
of this trend.
Stanford, however, has its own special
ist on obsessive love, psychiatrist Donald
Lunde of the Stanford Medical Center.

According to Lunde, obsessions come
in different sizes and shapes. A mild in
fatuation with a movie star like Clark
Gable or Marilyn Monroe clearly differs
from the psychopathical hysteria
portrayed by Glen Close in last year's
blockbuster film "Fatal Attraction."
"There is a whole continuum of obses
sions that range from the very mild to
the most severe," Lunde said.
Obsessive love is not solely an Amer
ican tendency. In fact, statistics show
that it is actually more prevalent in Eu
rope — the English refer to obsessive
love as pathological jealously, according
to Lunde.
Although there is a lower murder rate
in England than in the United States,
25 percent of all murders related to pat
hological jealousy occur in England,
Lunde reported.
Actually, most love starts out with ob
sessive elements, Lunde said. "What
people mean when they say 'I've fallen
in love' is that they believe this person
has all the characteristics they want.
They both fit each other's fantasies and
grasp to the idealized person," he ex
plained.
Even when it becomes clear that the
love is ill-fated, people begin to roman

ticize their relationship and "overlook"
the weaknesses and "think the person
can change," Lunde explained.
Contrary to popular belief, obsessive
love is not purely sexual. Most pursuants
have not had sex with the person they
hope to obtain. Often these obsessive
lovers have never even had a relationship,
so they focus all their dreams on one
chosen person.
"These people are looking for an all
encompassing, fulfilling relationship
where that person is the perfect friend,
lover, wife, mother — the perfect every
thing," Lunde explained.
The obsessive lovers "come to believe
that when they get together with this
person, everything will be wonderful and
all their needs will be met."
According to Lunde, some people be
come "addicted" to this hopeful sensation
and go through life falling in love every
three to six months.
Six months is "about as long as this
euphoria or obsession of thinking about
the person lasts," Lunde said.
Love wavers on the psychotic when
obsessive lovers are no longer able to
distinguish between their fantasy and
reality. The fantasy actually becomes
alive for the lovers.
Obsessed people, however, are typicaly
sane in all other areas of their lives. "It's
like they have this one isolated part of
their life in which they are sort of crazy,"
Lunde said, adding that all other areas
of their life are perfectly normal.
Obsessive love is not just a modern-day
phenomena, however. English Prof. Mary
Wack has researched and written several
essays on medieval lovesickness and
lended insight on its historical relevance.
According to Wack, medieval academics
considered lovesickness "a male disease."
But by the Renaissance, male writers
began to see obsessive love as a female
disease, diagnosing it as hysteria,
chlorosis and white fever. "There was an
entire shift in medical writing from
(lovesickness) being a male to a female
disease," Wack explained.
"The causes of lovesickness were gen
erally thought to be the sight of an at
tractive person and the result of bodily
malfunctions," Wack said. People were
so overwhelmed by another's beauty that
they would lose all sense of judgment.
Wack went on to explain that in the
past lovesickness could be for an object
or animal as well as a person. There are
cases of people helplessly loving horses
or jewelry, for instance.
The primary cure for medieval lovesick
ness was for victims to sleep with their
obsessions. When this was not possible,
physicians recommended that the suffer
ing lovers sleep with prostitutes, drink

lots of wine, take relaxing baths, take
walks with friends in gardens, engage in
stimulating conversation and indulge in
lots of delicious food.
An ancient recipe also existed for help
ing suffering lovers cope. The recipe
called for wild endive, honeysuckle toot,
dandelion and basil. Ingredients should
be boiled and a touch of dodder should
be added.
Wack explained that lovesickness was
primarily a disease of the nobility.
"Noblemen probably had the money and
leisure to sit and think about love," Wack
said.
One story of a nobleman's love sickness
has become a classic — and has a happy
ending. Selecus, one of Alexander the
Great's generals, marries a woman
named Stratonice. Antiochus, his son,
also falls in love with her but decides to
suppress his love. Consequently, An
tiochus becomes lovesick. As he nears his
death, Selecus discovers his son's suffer
ing and decides to give up his new bride
to save Antiochus' life.
According to Wack, literature has a
"copycat effect." Love stories stir people's
emotions and they "play out their fan
tasies by means of literature," she said.
"Literature is in one way a symptom

of social problems but in another way
also effects social problems," she said.
But even today, stories of lovesickness
sometimes end happily. "The very fact
that someone will avidly pursue (another)
with the chance of being rebuffed may
make the woman or man feel sorry for
the person or be impressed," Lunde said.
"Sometimes (these couples) will end up
not just together but actually married."
But in extreme cases of lovesicknesses,
there is no chance for a fulfilling rela
tionship, Lunde warned. In these cases,
the obsessed do not even know the indi
vidual qualities of the persons they
pursue. The infatuated lovers, however,
commonly believe that their love will be
reciprocrated if given the chance.
"Generally, the obsessed person will
start out following the person or sending
flowers, gifts and so forth," Lunde said.
Rejection may make this harmless pur
suit dangerous and violent.
Obsessed lovers will lash out against
themselves or against the people they
desire. Suicide is the obsessed lover's
common reaction, but rape is not. In
extreme cases, obsessed lovers resort to
murder.
"Typically, these people have reached
the point where they feel if they can't

have the person, no one else can," Lunde
explained.
Lunde warned that victims of obsessed
lovers are often too "nice." Instead of
rebuking obsessed lovers, victims "will
try in a nice way to say 'I'm not inter
ested,' " Lunde explained.
"But any interest at all can be twisted
around as evidence that this person really
is in love with the obsessed person," he
said.
Obsessive love is a problem that occurs
in all places and affects all types of people.
Stanford addresses the problem by pro
viding confidential counseling agencies
for students.
The Bridge, located two buildings down
from the Campus Bike Shop, is a student
run, peer-counseling service that answers
phone calls 24 hours a day and offers
drop-in hours from 11 a.m. to midnight
on Mondays through Thursdays and 11
a.m. to 7 p.m. on Fridays.
Students may also contact profession
als at Counseling and Psychological Serv
ices, located at Cowell Student Health
Center.
There is also a Sex Love Addicts
Anonymous program in the Palo Alto
area that caters to all members of the
Stanford community.
