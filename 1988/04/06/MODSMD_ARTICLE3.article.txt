## Shepherd may become next deputy attorney general 
### Sean Kinch Editorial staff With wire reports 
Attorney General Edwin Meese an
nounced yesterday that John Shepherd,
chair of the board of overseers of Hoover
Institution, is his choice to replace Ar
nold Burns as deputy attorney general.
• Meese also named Asst. Treasury Sec
retary Francis Keating to take over as
assistant attorney general in place of
Stephen Trott, who is leaving to take
a seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals. Both Shepherd and Keating
will serve in an acting capacity until
they are nominated and confirmed by
the Senate.
These announcements were made
shortly after the resignations of Burns,
Assistant Attorney General William
Weld and four of their aides, all of whom
left the Justice Department in reaction
to Meese's alleged legal problems.

Shepherd was president of the Amer
ican Bar Association in 1984 and 1985
and chairman of that organization's
house of delegates from 1978 to 1980.
He is a principal partner in the law
firm of Shepherd, Sandberg and
Phoenix, and has developed a reputation
as a highly skilled litigator.
The announcements, made amid a
flurry of doubts expressed by congress
men about Meese's leadership ability,
are a part of the attorney general's ef
fort to convince Capitol Hill that he is
still firmly in charge of his department.
Meese's first choice to fill Burns' po
sition, former federal Judge Arlin
Adams, declined the appointment in fa
vor of pursuing private law practice.
At a press conference with Shepherd
and Keating, Meese said Shepherd "will
be a highly distinguished and most wel
come addition to the Justice Depart
ment family as my second in command."
"I'm especially pleased to become an

official member of this outstanding
group of lawyers," Shepherd said.
Although he is familiar with Meese's
lefeal troubles, Shepherd said he had no
qualms about accepting the position
after Burns' resignation.
Although there is concern among con
gressmen that Meese is trying to fill
the vacancies quickly simply to railroad
the confirmations and re-establish his
credibility as a leader, White House of
ficials plan to examine the appointments
carefully.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is
investigating Meese's possible illegal ac
tivities and will soon question Burns
and Weld. The Democrats on the com
mittee are planning to use that inquiry
to put pressure on Meese to resign.
But Shepherd seems to be above
reproach. Charles Palm, associate direc
tor at Hoover, said he has "great ad
miration for John Shepherd" and called
the appointment a "fine choice."
