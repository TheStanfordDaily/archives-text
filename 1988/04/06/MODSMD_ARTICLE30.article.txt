## Diversions 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
Business as usual:
Well, it's already the second week of spring
quarter and I still have no tan to speak of.
Maybe I should take some of my own advice
and head to the shores of the slow-to-fill Lake
Lag, watch the windsurfers, and catch some
rays....
A different party scene:
Before the fraternities host any more out
door extravaganzas (like last Saturday's all-day
Beta Nooner) one thing must happen — Rush.
This week marks the beginning of fraternity
and sorority Rush — the event that steers
many a frosh along the path to Greek life. To
all involved: Keep your eyes open, be objective
and most of all, have fun!
A little chamber music:
The Lively Arts brings the Muir String
Quartet to Stanford tonight. This ensemble
combines violin, viola and cello for a remark
able program featuring music of Haydn,
Prokofiev and Dvorak. The performance begins
at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel.
Those golden years:
Tomorrow night at the I-Center, the From
Ragtime to Prime Time Film Series brings
movie greats Katherine Hepburn and Henry
Fonda to the Stanford screen in the modern
classic "On Golden Pond." These two
humorous retirees struggle with growing old
gracefully in this much-loved film. The movie
begins at 7:30 p.m.
Laugh and the world laughs with you:
It's Comedy Night at the Coffee House April
12, with STARTS' "Comedy Sports." Begin
ning at 8 p.m., two comedy teams compete in
a series of improvisational games sure to bring
a laugh to the already relaxed spring quarter
crowd.
"Music from Marlboro":
A collection of artists from the Marlboro
Music Festival offer a rare opportunity for the
Stanford community to hear the music of
Mozart, Janacek, Ligiti and Beethoven per
formed on wind instruments. The program is
Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in Dinkelpiel.
Seniors, Take Note:
Senior class president Liz Marks let me
know that Pub Night is at 42nd Street this
week. Have a good one. .. .
