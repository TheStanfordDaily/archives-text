## Leather jackets never out of style 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
One of the classic old jokes is
about the animal rights activist,
wearing a leather jacket, who
protests the killing of minks.
But who could blame the
animal rights activist for the over
sight? Leather jackets are so
much a part of our culture that
it's hard to imagine a time with
out them.
Unfortunately, many of the
shopping malls and department
stores imagine a time without
them from March until October.
The time span may vary according
to the climactic conditions of your
place of residence.
"Warm" climates like the Bay
Area will carry leather on their
coat racks for a shorter length of
time while cooler places like, say,
Siberia, which will probably have
a larger stock.
This seasonal reasoning for the
length of time leather jackets are
kept on the coat racks really
doesn't make sense to me. Leat
her jackets are always in style
and can be worn year-round, es

pecially in places like San Fran
cisco where summers are colder
than the winters.
The main reason I'm miffed
about this prescribed time in
which leather jackets are allowed
to be sold is that I've been trying
to buy a leather jacket for the
past couple of months, but none
of the department stores or men's
clothing stores I go to usually
have them in stock.
I realize that I can get a jacket
at one of those leather specialty
stores, but I'll also have to shell
out about $400. You can get a
decent leather jacket for under
$300 when the department stores
sell them during the "leather
season" and that's all I'm willing
and able to pay.
The department stores that sell
leather jackets in moderate
climates need to understand that
leathpr jackets never go out of
season no matter what the
weather is.
Leather jackets do more than
just warm you up. Depending on
their color, cut, texture and ma
terial from which they are made,
they can also serve as an exten

sion of one's personaility.
Black leather jackets are the
epitome of coolness and rebel
liousness (a fashion statement
spawned by James Dean). There's
a certain sense of danger and
brash self-confidence that comes
from someone who wears a black
leather jacket.
A black leather jacket with a
lot of zips, flaps and buckles can
bring the Hell's Angels or Michael
Jackson to mind. A distressed,
brown, bomber-style leather
jacket brings with it an air of
adventure.
Leather jackets are also very
versatile. They go just as well with
jeans and a T-shirt as they do
with slacks and a tie. The depart
ment stores don't seem to realize
this, however.
I can understand why Bay Area
stores won't sell heavy, lined
leather jackets during the spring
and summer months, but the least
they could do is stock up on the
lighter and softer leathers like
calf-, doe- and lambskin.
Unless they do this soon, I'll
have to walk around looking un
cool until October.
