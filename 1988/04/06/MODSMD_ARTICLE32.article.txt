I think a good indicator of how good a Mexican
restaurant is can be based on the quality of its
f^jitas.
The fcyitas most Stanford students are exposed
to are the soupy concoctions prepared by University
Food Service that are composed of soggy onions
and green peppers combined with market steak and
served on what appears to be a flour tortilla. They
really aren't a fair representation of good fcyitas.
Ideal should be prepared with cut-against
the-grain flank steak that has been beaten into
submission until juicy and tender. They should be
served with hot flour tortillas, guacamole, sour
cream, beans, salsa and, if you like, crisp green
peppers and onions lightly sauteed in butter.
Fortunately, Don Ramon's Mexican restaurant
offers an above average — even if not ideal — feyita.
First of all, although they don't use flank steak,
Don Ramon's offers a generous serving of tender
strips of sirloin that are brought to you on sizzling

iron skillet.
They also give you your choice of flour or corn
tortillas. Although they don't serve green peppers
and onions, they do offer good portions of
guacamole, sour cream, beans and salsa.
My friends, meanwhile, indulged in some good
old-fashioned combination plates of tacos, enchiladas
and tamales. I didn't taste anything off their plates,
but my associates said that the Mexican food was
bueno.
Probably the best thing about Don Ramon's was
the service. My friends even felt compelled to leave
above a 15 percent tip.
Our waiter was a friendly Mexican guy who of
fered suggestions on the food, the beer and the best
clubs to visit in the South of Market area. Best of
all, he didn't try to shame or humiliate us when
we tried out our first-year Spanish when ordering.
Don Ramon's doesn't look like much from the
outside, but that comes with the territory because
everything on 11th looks like an abandoned ware
house. However, the interior has the nice, comfort
able atmosphere and decor of places like Acapulco
and El Torito.
Don Ramon's is a basically good, mellow place to
go before hitting the South of Market clubs that
offers, at an average price, above average food and
service.
