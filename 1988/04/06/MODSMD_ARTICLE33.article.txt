## Midnight Oil's 'Diesel and Dust': strong on lyrics, weak on music 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Midnight Oil — "Diesel and
Dust"
As the slick record company ex
ecutives know, there are many ad
vantages in starting an album
with the best track. A strong first
song can really get the listener
hooked on a release that might
be easily ignored, and can get the
album off on the right foot.
Unfortunately, as in the case
of Midnight Oil's latest (which is
hot off the record presses), it can
also misguide a foolhardy audio
phile or reviewer into thinking
the whole album bursts with the
creativity and vibrance of the in
itial hypnotic tune, only to be dis
appointed after the first five
minutes.
Now, this album isn't all that
bad. Peter Garrett has a distinc
tive and expressive voice (similar,
I have been told, to that of the
Rainmakers lead singer) that
ranks him second only to Sinead
O'Connor in the prospective
Grammy award category of Best

Bald Vocalist, and the lyrics he
spouts are succinct, intelligent
commentaries.
"Diesel and Dust" also gets
kudos for thematic unity. As a
brief perusal of the lyric sheet —
a record sleeve that appears to be
the work of a Jackson Pollack-like
abstract expressionist's painting
attacked by spastic graffiti artists
inspired by Pink Floyd's "The
Wall" — makes readilv apparent,
Midnight Oil is fighting mad
about the Australians' treatment
of the indigenous Aborigines,
whose plight is sadly similar to
the Native Americans' fate during
the westward expansion in the
United States.
All this lyrical passion makes
most of the music seem a pale
vehicle of the poignancy. "Beds
Are Burning," the opening track
and first single, brilliantly com
bines powerful words with
provocative, anthematic instru
mentation to produce one of the
best songs released in a long
while.
With the exception of "The
Dead Heart," which opens the
second side, however, tne music

It seems almost as if
the songwriter wrote
the lyrics and then
took a Quaalude
before jotting down
the melodies.

just doesn't fit the words. It seems
almost as if the songwriter wrote
the lyrics and then took a
Quaalude before jotting down the
melodies.
The result is a 30-minute
stretch where the listener just
knows it has to get better because
it ia Midnight Oil spewing out of
the stereo, but soon must resign
themselves to the increasing
tedium.
Now I know Rolling Stone gave
this album three-and-one-nalf
stars, but the most I feel I can
do is grant it a "B" for effort.
Oh, the cover looks really cool,
too, but style points only go so far.
Sony, guys. Better luck next
time, OK?
