# Album Review
## Astley's great voice can't salvage 'Somebody' 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Rick Astley â€” "Whenever You
Need Somebody"
Never has a true talent been
more pitifully wasted than on
Rick Astley's debut album.
Without a doubt, the man has
one of the richest voices ever re
corded, even without the double
track enhancement and other pro
duction tricks. Yet almost all of
the ditties that the vocals carry
on this release should have been
left on the cutting room floor or
on a Belinda Carlisle album.
"Whenever You Need Some
one" is to the music industry what
"Howard the Duck" was to the
motion picture industry: a glitzy

product made with the latest pro
duction gimmicks, slickly and in
novatively marketed, and a total
waste of good raw materials.
Astute readers of this section
may recall that I recommended
the first track of the album, the
monstrously successful "Never
Gonna Give You Up," in the most
recent Fiscal Fidelity column. "So
what's the scoop, Evan?" you ask.
"Are you just in a tune-bashing
mood, or are you the biggest hyp
ocrite to ever clutter The Daily's
pages?"
No, gentle reader, I do remem
ber my own opinions, thank you.
I still find the tune a most ebul
lient piece of work that roots itself
into your mind on the first listen
and immediately takes hold. As
much as it pains me to say it, it

is a snappy tune even if it is a
revival of the mercifully extinct
musical mutant breed called disco.
However, the album is a one
trick pony. Purely and simply, the
remaining songs are just absolute
rubbish. The second single, "To
gether Forever," a wanna-be
"Never Gonna Give You Up," is
as sing-songy as its title implies,
making it seem more like a kin
dergartener's playtime creation
rather than a meaningful love
song; a tune to skip to rather
than with which to renew your
vows.
And it only gets worse. When
I flipped the album over and saw
that Astley penned most of the
songs on Side Two, my hopes
raised for about a minute-and-a
half. Unfortunately, his own crea-

Astley's amazing
voice is utterly
wasted on insuf
ferably weak material.

tions are more trite (is that pos
sible?) than those of the produc
tion team that penned the first
side's gems.
With the sole exception of the
syrupy final cut, a remake of Nat
King Cole's "When I Fall in
Love," Astley's amazing voice is
utterly wasted on insufferably
weak material. Hopefully some
one will smack him and free him
from the bonds of this genre he
selected before he becomes the
next Barry White.
