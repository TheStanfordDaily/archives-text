Residential Education is proud to announce that the new RF in Burbank will be Arthur
Wolf, a professor in anthropology. Because this selection was made too late for his

HOUSE: Burbank
RESIDENT FELLOW: Arthur Wolf
Number of Female RA Positions: 2 (or 1) Male RA Positions: 1 (or 2)
First Round Interviews: I, 4/18 Second Round: I, 4/25
Some Background Information about the Resident Fellow
Arthur is a third generation Californian, from a ranching and logging background. The first member of his
family to graduate from high school, Arthur received a B.A. in English literature from Cornell University,
where he also did his Ph.D. work in anthropolology While at Cornell, Arthur lived in a residence which
fostered discussion with distinguished guests and encouraged intellectual as well as social interaction
among students. A sinologist, Arthur spent seven years in a Chinese community, which has prepared him
for the closeness and noise of dorm life. Arthur has taught at Cornell, the London School of Economics
and at Oxford. At Stanford Arthur has taught hundreds of students in Hum Bio and next year will co-teach
Hum Bio 01 with Toyon RF Bill Durham.
The Resident Fellow's Specific Goals and Educational Objectives for the House
I want Burbank to be a place where students know each other and feel at home. Ideally students will be
comfortable talking about their academic interests as well as casual topics and will want to invite faculty and
TAs to dinner. I'd like to work with the RAs to put together a good mix of activities including mini-courses
and trips. I would like to teach a class or organize some programs on my work on the origins of the human
incest taboo I would also be interested in planning discussions with experts on issues 1) surrounding
incestuous child abuse (which could include field trips to a San Jose center for abused children), 2) sexual
attraction and inhibition, and 3) inbreeding avoidance among primates (which could include observation
trips to the San Francisco and San Diego zoos). I have just been appointed a professor at a mainland
Chinese university, and I look forward to bringing visitors from Taiwan and the People's Republic of China
to speak about their life and work.
The Resident Fellow's Concept Qf the RA Role and the Specific Characteristics the Resident Fellow is
Seeking in Candidates
I have experience working with the Hum Bio TAs, and I am looking for RA candidates with similar qualities:
a strong academic record, reliability, willingness to take on responsibility and follow through on particular
projects, maturity, and, of course, the ability to relate comfortably and warmly to all the students in Burbank
As this will be my first year as an RF, I will be looking to my RA team to help find the best mix of oommunity
buiiding activities and educational and cultural programs
Specific Questions the Resident Fellow Plans to Pursue in Interviews
What makes a successful residence community?
What do you want to gain from being an RA?
What do you think are your strongest assets as an RA? What will be toughest for you?
What are examples of your organizational know-how? your leadership ability? your reliability?
What do you expect from your RF and other members of the staff team?
