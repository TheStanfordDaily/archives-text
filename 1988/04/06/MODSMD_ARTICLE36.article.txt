## Gould loves his Sox 
### 
During the first full week of Spring
Quarter, most professors are thinking
about lecture schedules and room
changes and are writing books or articles
for scholarly journals.
Law School Prof. William Gould, how
ever, is thinking — and writing — about
baseball. Specifically, the Boston Red
Sox.

In fact, Gould wrote Monday's edito
rial in the Oakland Tribune on the Red
Sox. The Oakland Tribune, of course,
serves an area which is presumably more
concerned with the Oakland A's, and
even the San Francisco Giants, than a
team based 3,000 miles away. Neverthe
less, Gould's piece was an fitting edito
rial for Opening Day regardless of club
allegiance, eloquently reminding readers
that while baseball can be the most
charming and enchanting of sports,
there is also a more painful side to the
game, for there are currently no black
managers in the leagues.
"A world championship alone will not
satisfy me in a world where most clubs
have never employed a black manager
— and none do so today," writes Gould,
who has taught labor law at Stanford
since 1972. "That will only be achieved
when ex-Bosoxers like Don Baylor or
Bob Watson are placed at the helm and
mount the top steps of the [Boston]
dugout."
Sportswriting is nothing new for
Gould, however. His work has appeared
in the New York Times, the Boston
Globe, the San Francisco Chronicle, the
San Francisco Examiner and the San
Jose Mercury News, among others.
It's kind of a hobby — like the way
Bo Jackson plays for the Raiders as a
hobby. And when he's not moonlighting
as a sportswriter for m£yor national pub
lications, Gould is also an internationally
known labor arbitrator and the author
of a book entitled "Labor Relations in
Professional Sports."
Strangely enough, Gould has never
been involved in baseball arbitration,
despite his expertise in both subjects,
but others have been known to call him
for advice.

"Percentages can be deceiving," says
Gould, who practiced law for seven years
after graduating from Cornell Law
School. "When I was a kid, I used to
get into arguments with Yankee fans,
saying that Vern Stephens was a better
shortstop than Phil Rizzuto because he
had a better fielding percentage.
"He had a better fielding percentage,
of course, because he wasn't a quick as
Rizzuto and didn't get to as many balls.
That illustrates the problems arbitrators
are confronted with."
Gould isn't hesitant about discussing
labor relations in the big leagues. "I
don't think players are overpaid," he
says."I think for a number of years
because of the reserve clause they were
underpaid, and now they've caught up.
What's happened now is that the owners
have been stampeded and scared by what
thay've seen the agents doing, so they're
dragging their heels and their major mo
tivation is to tell the players who's boss.
"Both sides have contributed to a very
unfortunate state of affairs," he contin
ues, "and unless there is some interven
tion or re-evaluation, it will clearly lead
to a strike or possible lockout in 1990,
which would be tragic."
Gould is much more optimistc when
talking about his favorite subject, the
Red Sox. "I think they'll be very good,"
says the professor who is often seen
sporting a Boston cap on campus. "I
don't think anyone possesses the
frontline pitchers we do. The Yankees
certainly don't."
Boston Globe sportswriter Larry
Whiteside, who is at Stanford as a
Knight Journalism Fellow, took a labor
law class from Gould last fall and calls
him "the most devoted fan I've ever
seen. He's a true blue Red Sox fan; he
just loves them."
Gould has, on occasion, been known
to sprinkle in references to the Bosox
during lectures, however, and has even
interrupted class proceedings to inform
his students about important off-season
developments. During Winter Quarter,
he learned that Boston had acquired
reliever Lee Smith from the Chicago
Cubs, called the Chronicle to confirm
the transaction, then rushed back,
stopped his class and reportedly an
nounced, "Our prayers have been an
swered!" Now this is my kind of pro
fessor.
Meanwhile, the law school professor
continues to dabble in a little sportswrit
ing on the side. "He's always talking
about trading places with me," says
Whiteside, who covers the Red Sox for
the Globe. "He thinks I have the perfect
job. I very politely told him no."
