# Card hammers Broncos
## SCU throttled 20-3 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
SANTA CLARA — It must have been
the haircut.
Stanford sophomore Paul Carey
came off the bench with a new hair
cut and an old power stroke yester
day, ripping his first home run of
the season to highlight a 20-hit, five-

homer Cardinal offensive barrage that buried Santa
Clara 20-3 at Buck Shaw Stadium.
Junior Ron Witmeyer and sophomore Troy Paul
sen also homered and junior Ed Sprague was 4-for-4
with two home runs (his 11th and 12th of the
season) and a double as the Cardinal assaulted
seven different Bronco pitchers.
Paulsen's three-run shot in the sixth was the big
blow in a nine-run inning for the Cardinal. The
home run extended Paulsen's hitting streak to a
team-high 14 games. That leaves the sophomore
shortstop only 44 games shy of the NCAA
consecutive-game hitting streak of 58 set by Okla
homa State's Robin Ventura last year.
The 20 runs (all earned) were the most Stanford
has scored in a game since last April 29, when the
team beat — surprise — Santa Clara, 21-7.
"It's nice to get a few hits for a change," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "It's nice to have a
laugher."
The Cardinal (now 24-11 on the year and 9-5 in
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division going
into a league series at Arizona this weekend) had
a total of only 16 hits and 11 runs in a three-game
series with California last weekend.
The team then exploded for 13 runs on 11 hits
Monday against St. Mary's and really went wild
yesterday against the Broncos.
"I can't figure it out," Marquess said. "But you
take 'em when you can get 'em. Hopefully, we can
carry this over to the weekend ... You just have
to hope it relaxes us and gets us swinging the bat
like we can."
The five home runs was the most the Cardinal
has hit in a game since it racked up a half-dozen
in an 18-6 whitewashing of USF last April 14.
But Carey's titanic two-run blast to deep center
field was particularly notable. It was Carey's first
homer since his dramatic game-winning grand slam
in the bottom of the 10th against LSU in the College
World Series last June 5.
Carey was named the Most Valuable Player of
the CWS, capping a remarkable freshman year dur
ing which he batted .353 and hit 12 home runs.
But he has struggled this year. That he had gone
34 games without a homer was symptomatic of the
problems he has been having at the plate.
Also symptomatic of those problems was the fact
that after starting 83 straight games for the Car
dinal dating to early last season, Carey was pulled
out of the starting lineup before Monday's game
against St. Mary's at Sunken Diamond.
In addition, 11 games ago, Carey made a bet with

sophomore pitcher Mark Carper:
If Carey didn't hit a home run in
the next 10 games, he would get
a buzz haircut similar to the one
Carper sports.
The 10th game was Monday
against St. Mary's, and Carey was
again homer-less. He got the hair
cut yesterday morning, then came
out in the afternoon and got the
home run he had been looking for.
His teammates greeted him at
the dugout by running their
hands appreciatively over his
bristly head.
The home run "felt good, but
it didn't really make a difference
in the game," Carey said. "It woke
me up. .. . It's good to get it off
my shoulders. ... It's always good
to get the first one — I just wish
it had been a few months earlier."
Carey said he had been fighting
mounting frustration as his bat
ting slump wore on this season.
"Up until five or six games ago,
I had high spirits," he said. "But
it's frustrating, hitting 12 home
runs last year, everybody having
high expectations, and me having
high expectations for myself, and
then struggling for half a season."
But with a new haircut and in
the new situation of coming off
the bench, Carey broke out of his

homer drought. Although he was
happy about the home run, Carey
said he still hasn't decided about
the haircut. "Actually, I haven't
really looked at it myself," he said,
grinning.

Carey wasn't the only player
with a haircut. Several others —
including Paulsen and junior
Frank Carey (no relation to Paul,
except that they both have short
hair now) also had their hair cut
before yesterday's game, though
not quite as short as Paul Carey's.
Marquess wasn't sure if the
haircuts had anything to do with
the huge offensive outburst yes
terday. "I'd hate to go to their
barber, that's all I can say," he
said, laughing.
The Cardinal scored four runs
in the second inning, two in the
third, four in the fifth, nine in
the sixth and one in the seventh.
Stanford had at least one hit in
all but three innings.
The Cardinal pitchers, mean
while, held the Broncos to three
runs on 10 hits. Freshmen starter
Mike Mussina and Stan Spencer
each went three, junior Steve
Chitren went two and Carper
finished up in the ninth.
Mussina got the win to improve
his season record to 6-1.
Every Stanford starter except
sophomore designated hit
ter/catcher Eric Cox had at least
one hit. Chitren even got in on
the act, batting for himself in the
eighth after Cox switched from
DH to catcher. Chitren lined a
single into right field for the first
hit of his collegiate career.

Stanford shortstop Troy Paulsen, a sophomore, had a three-run home run yesterday to extend his
14-game hitting streak.
