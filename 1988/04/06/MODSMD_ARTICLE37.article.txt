# Card hammers Broncos
## SCU throttled 20-3 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
SANTA CLARA — It must have been
the haircut.
Stanford sophomore Paul Carey
came off the bench with a new hair
cut and an old power stroke yester
day, ripping his first home run of
the season to highlight a 20-hit, five-

homer Cardinal offensive barrage that buried Santa
Clara 20-3 at Buck Shaw Stadium.
Junior Ron Witmeyer and sophomore Troy Paul
sen also homered and junior Ed Sprague was 4-for-4
with two home runs (his 11th and 12th of the
season) and a double as the Cardinal assaulted
seven different Bronco pitchers.
Paulsen's three-run shot in the sixth was the big
blow in a nine-run inning for the Cardinal. The
home run extended Paulsen's hitting streak to a
team-high 14 games. That leaves the sophomore
shortstop only 44 games shy of the NCAA
consecutive-game hitting streak of 58 set by Okla
homa State's Robin Ventura last year.
The 20 runs (all earned) were the most Stanford
has scored in a game since last April 29, when the
team beat — surprise — Santa Clara, 21-7.
"It's nice to get a few hits for a change," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "It's nice to have a
laugher."
The Cardinal (now 24-11 on the year and 9-5 in
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division going
into a league series at Arizona this weekend) had
a total of only 16 hits and 11 runs in a three-game
series with California last weekend.
The team then exploded for 13 runs on 11 hits
Monday against St. Mary's and really went wild
yesterday against the Broncos.
"I can't figure it out," Marquess said. "But you
take 'em when you can get 'em. Hopefully, we can
carry this over to the weekend ... You just have
to hope it relaxes us and gets us swinging the bat
like we can."
The five home runs was the most the Cardinal
has hit in a game since it racked up a half-dozen
in an 18-6 whitewashing of USF last April 14.
But Carey's titanic two-run blast to deep center
field was particularly notable. It was Carey's first
homer since his dramatic game-winning grand slam
in the bottom of the 10th against LSU in the College
World Series last June 5.
Carey was named the Most Valuable Player of
the CWS, capping a remarkable freshman year dur
ing which he batted .353 and hit 12 home runs.
But he has struggled this year. That he had gone
34 games without a homer was symptomatic of the
problems he has been having at the plate.
Also symptomatic of those problems was the fact
that after starting 83 straight games for the Car
dinal dating to early last season, Carey was pulled
out of the starting lineup before Monday's game
against St. Mary's at Sunken Diamond.
In addition, 11 games ago, Carey made a bet with

Junior Ron Witmeyer scored four runs and homered yesterday to
lead Stanford to a 20-3 whitewashing of Santa Clara.
