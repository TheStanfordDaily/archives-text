# Netters struggle past Cal
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
Sophomore JefT Tarango, down 5-2
in the third set, rebounded to defeat
Woody Hunt 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 to clinch
an uninspiring 8-1 win for the Stan
ford men's tennis team against Cal
ifornia yesterday at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.

Tarango, who hasn't lost a dual match in singles
since the USC contest Feb. 20 against Scott Melville,
also combined with freshman David Wheaton to
overcome two match points and outlast Doug Eisen
man and Carl Chang 6-7, 7-6 (12-10), 6-2. Tarango
has climbed to No. 5 in the recent national singles
rankings.
With the win, the third-rated Cardinal improved
to 15-1 (5-0 in the Pacific 10 Conference). The
Bears dropped to 8-9 (1-4).
Drained from last weekend's victories over UCLA
and USC, the Cardinal looked anything but razor
sharp in defeating No. 15 Cal.
"It wasn't real pretty," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said, "but we'll take the win. We showed the
effects of the weekend. It's natural for the guys to
have a little bit of a letdown. They had some trouble
concentrating out there."
Tarango and sophomore Jeff Cathrall won in
three sets in both their singles and doubles events.
Tarango, and his partner Wheaton, and Cathrall,
teamed with sophomore Eric Peus, found just
enough to stave off the pesty Bears.
Cal's Pete Fitzpatrick defeated sophomore Barry
Richards 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 at No. 6 singles.
Cathrall upended Chang 6-0, 3-6, 6-2, and teamed
with Peus to beat Fitzpatrick and Matt Stroyman
4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
"It's tough to get up for Cal after the weekend,"
senior Patrick McEnroe said. "Everyone is a little
low. But we did all right — it was a solid win."
At No. 1 singles, Cal's Ted Scherman, in front
of McEnroe 5-2 in the first set, turned his ankle
and was forced to forfeit the match. Scherman also
regularly plays No. 1 doubles.
"Our guys played good tennis," California Coach
Scott McCain said. "It's tough to lose your No. 1
guy in singles and doubles. But we were still com
petitive all the way down the lineup."
Wheaton, playing in his sixth singles match since
his return from injury, recorded a 6-2, 6-3 victory
against Cal's Kurt Streeter. Wheaton is 5-1 in dual
match singles play.
Freshman Martin Blackman also notched a singles
win, besting Eisenman 6*3, 7-5.
In doubles play, Blackman and McEnroe, the
nation's 14th-rated tandem, disposed of Hunt and
Ed Mar cum 6-1, 7-6.
Stanford next plays this weekend against Arizona
and Arizona State. The Wildcats come to the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium for a 1:30 p.m. match Friday
and Stanford hosts the Sun Devils Saturday at 1
p.m. The Cardinal beat Arizona State 5-2 in Tempe
March 25, then crushed Arizona 8-0 the following
day in Tucson.
