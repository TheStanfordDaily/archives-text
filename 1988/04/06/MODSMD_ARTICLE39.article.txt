Arguably the greatest annual spec
tacle in sport came to a close Monday
in Kansas City, Mo. Unranked Kansas
ended a remarkable fortnight by captur
ing the NCAA men's basketball title
with a stunning 83-79 upset of
seemingly invincible No. 4 Oklahoma.

Commentary

As one watched the first half, in which
Kansas did absolutely everything it was
said could not be done against the
Sooners, Danny Manning and his
Jayhawk teammates began to assume
an almost ethereal quality. They could
do little wrong in the opening stanza,
beating Oklahoma at its forte, the tran
sition game.
Kansas shot better than 70 percent
from the field through 20 minutes, but
still found itself tied with the Sooners,
50-50. A multitude of Sooner second
shots, principally from Harvey Grant
and Stacey King, kept Oklahoma close.
Logic said that there was no way
Kansas could shoot so well in the second
half. Logic said the same thing at the
intermission of Villanova's remarkable
80-percent shooting night in the
Wildcats' unthinkable 1985 upset of
Georgetown.
In fact, the Jayhawks did slip to
around 50 percent in the second half,
but the game had taken on a totally
different look.
The breathless pace at which the first
half was played could be sustained by
neither team. Oklahoma's relentless
full-court pressure was reduced to
harassing the man inbounding the ball
and occasionally contesting the second
pass made in backcourt.
Running the shot-clock down with
every possession, the Jayhawks agoniz
ingly built a six-point lead with two
minutes remaining. No one could doubt
destiny at this point. Fittingly, Manning
buried the final four crucial free throws
to seal the victory.
Manning would say after the game,
"To all people who said it couldn't be
done, we're national champions, No. 1.
How do you like us now?"
To what do the Jayhawks owe this
accomplishment? Brown, Manning and
a cast of role-players. Brown thought
his players could run with the Sooners.
He convinced them that they could,
and for a half they did. Kansas attacked
the vaunted Oklahoma press brilliantly,

throwing cross-court over the Sooner
whippets to create numerous two-on-one
and three-on-two opportunities.
Things slowed by themselves in the
second half, and when his team looked
spent, Brown put on the deep freeze: a
version of the four-corners offense made
famous by North Carolina's Dean Smith.
Further, he substituted freely through
out the game, utilizing 10 players and
making 42 substitutions.
Little can be said about Manning that
hasn't already been uttered. He showed
all the elements of an immediate, impact
NBA player. With Grant collapsing in
the lane to help King on the double
team, the Kansas star responded with
31 points, 18 rebounds and a tremen
dous 13-for-24 shooting night.
When his team needed him to, Man
ning brought the ball up the floor. He
was fouled while making the final, cri
tical rebound of teammate Scooter Bar
ry's missed free throw, and then sunk
the ensuing free throws.
He displayed a jump-hook that has
been perfected to an art form. When a
Sooner guard sagged to pester him, he
found the open Jayhawk making a cut
to the basket. He hit jumpers when King
backed off to prevent the drive. He may
not quite have the shooting range of
Larry Bird, but he's shown he can do
everything else.
And then there were the role players.
Forward Chris Piper buried jumpers
from the free-throw circle while Grant
was busy helping on Manning. Kevin
Pritchard spent the whole game drib
bling with Mookie Blaylock in his jersey,
and still found time to score 13 points
on 6-of-7 shooting. And Milt Newton,
who emerged as a vital backcourt scorer
over the course of the tournament, was
a perfect 6-of-6 from the field and tallied
15 points.
Let's not forget fate. Lady Luck took
care of some higher-ranked opponents
Kansas might have faced in their march
to the Final Four. Some claimed prior
to the championship game that the
Oklahoma-Arizona semifinal game had
been the real title match.
Until Monday night.
That's when the victory over Duke
ceased to be another in a series of fluke
wins and became the stepping stone to
an inevitable victory over a dominant
Oklahoma team.
When that final confrontation is
remembered five years from now, it will
be grouped with the victories of Vil
lanova in '85 and North Carolina State
in '83 as the material of which legends
are made.
