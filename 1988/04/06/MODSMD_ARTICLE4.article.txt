Charging the ASSU with racism in
selecting service project managers,
Black Student Union Chair Bill King
and 20 other BSU members protested
the ASSU appointment process at last
night's senate meeting.
In a raucous meeting that Senate
Chair Dave Smolen termed a "circus
maxim us," the senate also approved —
with much argument — a set of Pro
gram Board allocations that were not
submitted to the senate until after its
meeting began.

King said that "behind-the-scenes and
closed-door movements" had blocked
ethnic minorities from receiving more
ASSU appointments.
Because of the controversy over the
selection process, the senate voted to
hold a second round of interviews for
the director and assistant director of
the Speaker's Bureau, as well as the
director of Public Affairs and advertis
ing manager. Though the controversy
remained unresolved, Smolen suggested
that a task force look into the possibility
of discrimination in the selection proc
ess.
Although 22 out of 36 appointees to

ASSU positions were ethnic minority
students, and 20 of the 36 were women,
King said a "different set of criteria"
was used to judge black applicants.
Referring to the statistical majority
of minority appointments, COP member
Leonard Adler said the ASSU numbers
are "higher than any other group."
King responded by saying the num
bers do not prove that racism is not a
factor in the appointment process. "The
numbers are indicative of the involve
ment of our community," he said.
Senator Lucky Gutierrez dis
counted the statistics. He said
that "institutional racism" exists
in the ASSU, and the problem is
compounded in this case because
of a "messy and inefficient" se
lection process.
King cited three specific cases
in which he believes racism en
tered the appointment process.
The first charge concerned the
selection of sophomore Andrew
Berke as director of the Speaker's
Bureau. Junior Terri James, the
current director, was denied
reinstatement for a second term.
King claimed there was "spe
cific manipulation to take her off
the Speaker's Bureau."
The second charge that arose
in the meeting concerned the se
lection of sophomore Deanna Ter
zian as director of ASSU Public
Affairs.
Junior Rachel Wiesen applied
for the job, but "after waiting six
weeks" to learn the results of the
selection process, she was in
formed she had been "switched
to advertising manager." During
that time, Wiesen said she also
heard "lots of rumors of racism."
The third charge of racism cen
tered around the appointment of
sophomore Lloyd Metz as Chair

of the Nominations Commission.
Metz, who is also BSU treasurer,
claimed he was unfairly ques
tioned because of a Daily editorial
he wrote criticizing the ASSU
Senate and COP.
COP member Roechelle Smith
concurred. "In a sense, Lloyd was
asked a different set of ques
tions," she said. She added that
racial incidents occur "time and
time again" in the ASSU.
Adler denied the charges and
said that there were no moves to
block Metz's appointment and
"charges to that effect are just
slander."
Thirty-two other service project
managers were approved by the
senate, along with five business
project managers and six assis
tants to the financial manager.
Another controversy arose over
the senate's approval of the latest
Program Board allocations, which
are the source of funding for com
munity service projects and stu
dent programs.
The bill narrowly escaped two
attempts to return it to committee
and was eventually passed by a
14-2 vote. The bill allocated
$11,893 for program funds and
$20,012 for community service
projects. A friendly amendment
was made to increase Gay and
Lesbian Awareness Week funding
from $531 to $3,483.
