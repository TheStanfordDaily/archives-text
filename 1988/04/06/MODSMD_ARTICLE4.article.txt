Charging the ASSU with racism in
selecting service project managers,
Black Student Union Chair Bill King
and 20 other BSU members protested
the ASSU appointment process at last
night's senate meeting.
In a raucous meeting that Senate
Chair Dave Smolen termed a "circus
maxim us," the senate also approved —
with much argument — a set of Pro
gram Board allocations that were not
submitted to the senate until after its
meeting began.

King said that "behind-the-scenes and
closed-door movements" had blocked
ethnic minorities from receiving more
ASSU appointments.
Because of the controversy over the
selection process, the senate voted to
hold a second round of interviews for
the director and assistant director of
the Speaker's Bureau, as well as the
director of Public Affairs and advertis
ing manager. Though the controversy
remained unresolved, Smolen suggested
that a task force look into the possibility
of discrimination in the selection proc
ess.
Although 22 out of 36 appointees to

ASSU positions were ethnic minority
students, and 20 of the 36 were women,
King said a "different set of criteria"
was used to judge black applicants.
Referring to the statistical majority
of minority appointments, COP member
Leonard Adler said the ASSU numbers
are "higher than any other group."
King responded by saying the num
bers do not prove that racism is not a
factor in the appointment process. "The
numbers are indicative of the involve
ment of our community," he said.
