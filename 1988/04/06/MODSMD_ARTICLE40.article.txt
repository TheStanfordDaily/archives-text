# Reno, Rush lead Diggers

SAN JOSE — For the few Stan
ford faithful who trekked to the
San Jose Civic Auditorium last
Friday night, it seemed just like
old times: When the going got
rough, Wendi Rush set Nancy
Reno.
This time, however, it was not
the Cardinal but the Golddiggers,
San Jose's M«yor League Volley
ball franchise, that reaped the
Reno-Rush rewards. Thanks to
the inspired play of Stanford's
dynamic duo, the Golddiggers
handed the league-leading Los
Angeles Starlites just their second
loss of the season after an 8-15,
15-11, 11-15, 15-9, 11-7 win.
(Game five was scored on a point
per-play, win-at-11 basis.)
Although the Golddiggers are
in fourth place in a six-team
league, they have beaten L.A. two
of three times to give the Starlites
their only losses this year.
"The key to the match was
Wendi's setting," Golddigger Asst.
Coach Max Kernaghan said. "It's
getting better match by match
through the season. She's put to
gether what we needed whenever
we needed it."
And how. Though she faced
some of the best middle blockers
in the nation — players who can
anticipate moves well and quickly
ascertain where the ball will be
set — Rush repeatedly befuddled
the Starlites to the extent that
San Jose spikers often faced just
one or no blockers.
The Golddiggers, especially
Rush and Reno, fortunately didn't
have this blocking trouble. The
duo combined for three blocks,
while Reno added three assists
and two solos without her college
teammate.
More importantly, Reno showed
the pros that she is an offensive
force to be reckoned with. Her
trademark loop and drift plays
developed with Rush at Stanford
were as indefensible Friday night
as in her college days, accounting
for half of her 18 kills.
"It's that Stanford chemistry,"
Kernaghan, a frequent official at
Cardinal volleyball matches,
added with a smile.

The Stanford volleyball team came gp just short in Hawaii Monday night despite 18 kills by Mark
Amstutz. The senior southpaw and his deadly jump serve will take the floor tonight in a rematch
against the No. 3 Rainbows.
