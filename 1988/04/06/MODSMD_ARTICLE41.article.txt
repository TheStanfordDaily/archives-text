# Spikers just miss
## 
### Cameron Macky Staff writer 
The Stanford
men's volleyball
team swept into
Hawaii like a ty
phoon Monday
night, but could
only muster

enough energy to rain briefly on
the Rainbows' parade.
In front of a raucous capacity
crowd, the Cardinal spikers came
within two points of handing the
No. 3 Rainbows their first home
defeat of the season, but could
not put the match away, eventu
ally succumbing 15-8, 12-15, 13-
15, 17-15, 15-5 in a marathon
contest that lasted three hours
and 13 minutes.
"We played a real strong match,
and we're pleased," Stanford Asst.
Coach Ruben Nieves said. "We
didn't win, but we played well."
With the loss, Stanford drops
to 10-16 (4-10 in the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion) and has now equaled its
longest losing streak of the season
at six matches. The Cardinal will
take another shot at toppling the
Rainbows (18-3, 10-2) tonight in
a rematch at Klum Gym.
Hawaii, which has defeated
such highly-ranked teams as
UCLA, Long Beach State, and
Pepperdine twice apiece in amass
ing its perfect home slate, was far
from invincible on Monday. Al
though the Rainbows appeared to
be on their way to an easy victory
after their 15-8 win in the opening
game, Stanford came back to out
hit Hawaii .342 to .256 in the
second game (the only game in
which the Cardinal had an advan
tage in the hitting column) to eke
out a 15-12 victory.
"We were getting some good
sets and good hits and there was
nothing Hawaii could do to stop
them," Nieves said. "We also had
some great individual perform
ances. Dan Hanan (who would
end up with a match-high 32 digs
and .393 hitting percentage)
played a great match."
Hanan, who also added a
match-high 21 digs, got a lot of
support from sophomore Craig
Forsyth and senior Mark
Amstutz, who chipped in with 19
and 18 kills, respectively. Amstutz

also added to the attack with a
devastating jump serve.
Forsyth's contributions were
outstanding, considering he was
playing a new position. "We
moved Craig from outside hitter
to middle blocker so we could
bring Amstutz in to start, and
Craig responded with some real
good hitting," Nieves said. "For
someone who hasn't played the
position, that's just fantastic."
The game two win was not only
Stanford's first against Hawaii
this season (the Cardinal dropped
a 15-13, 15-8 decision to the Rain
bows Jan. 23 in the UCSB Col
legiate Classic) but also marked
the end of a two-week scoring
drought, in which the team had
lost 13 straight games over five
matches.
The suddenly resurgent Cardi
nal rode the momentum of its
new-found offense to take a 2-1
lead after game three and had a
chance to put the match away at
15-all in game four, but could not
come up with two more points.
Hawaii, urged on by the deafening
crowd, scored the last two points
of the game to send the match to
a deciding fifth game.
"(After the 17-15 loss) we knew
we'd let them off the hook, and
we were disappointed," Nieves
said. "We didn't blow it: Hawaii
came up with some great plays,
but we knew that we'd missed a
great chance, and they (Hawaii)
rode the momentum they got
from the win right into the fifth
game."
Ride it they did: The Rainbows
raced to a commanding 8-0 lead
in the final game before the Car
dinal knew what hit them. Hitting
at a blistering .553 clip in game
five, Hawaii put the match away
as Stanford made several early
errors and couldn't recover.
The Rainbows, who outhit the
Cardinal for the match .358 to
.259, were led by junior outside
hitter Allen Allen, who finished
with 21 kills.
Even with the loss, Nieves said
the team remains optimistic.
"This team has had tough chal
lenges all year," he said. "To come
play in the toughest place in the
league after losing big to USC last
week is no small task, and we
ended up playing what was close
to our best match of the year."
