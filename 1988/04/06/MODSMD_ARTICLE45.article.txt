# First gay fraternity officially recognized by UCLA
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Members of the nation's first
gay fraternity, officially recog
nized by UCLA last week, say
the new organization aims to of
fer an atmosphere of brother
hood, support and community
service, open to persons of any
sexual orientation.
Motivated in part by the es
tablishment of the nation's first
lesbian sorority at UCLA in
February, the 11 founding mem
bers of Delta Lambda Phi
succeeded last Thursday in
gaining University sanction for
their fraternity.
"We had toyed with the idea
of the fraternity earlier than last
September," said Robert Kilgore,
the fraternity's co-director of
publicity. "But we didn't have
the tenacity, staffing or enthu
siasm [to follow through]."
The formation of the sorority,
Delta Lambda Delta, "made us
realize that [a gay fraternity]
really could happen," Kilgore
said. "A lot of pride went into it."
Although the fraternity is not
housed yet, he predicted that

within a year Delta Lambda Phi
will have a house on UCLA's
fraternity row. Kilgore said he
anticipates "strong support from
the West Hollywood community
financially."
With "the sanction and respect
of the University," Delta
Lambda Phi may now apply for
student activities funds, use the
school's name and meet in the
university's buildings.
"Everything that's available to
the other fraternities is available
to us," Kilgore said.
The new fraternity cannot dis
criminate against heterosexuals,
but Adam Ross, treasurer of
Delta Lambda Phi, said the fra
ternity "will provide an alterna
tive to the atmosphere other fra
ternities provide. We don't want
[fraternities] to be meat-markets
to meet women and have sex.
"It's incredibly unacceptable
to be homosexual in fraterni
ties," he added.
The oldest of the fraternity's
11 members, senior Doug Wal
ters, estimated that gay men
comprise 15 to 20 percent of
most UCLA fraternities. When
a person has to hide his

homosexuality in a fraternity, "it
is very debilitating to his own
identity," Walters said.
"Some people feel very com
fortable leading a double life" by
acting straight on campus, in
classes and in public, and then
acting openly gay at off-campus
social events, Walters said.
"In some ways you can hide
your homosexuality," he added,
but by doing so, "you're basically
lying."
The new fraternity aims to
provide a setting where "you
don't have to lie about who you
are — which is important," Ross
said.
According to Walters, frater
nities at UCLA make no special
effort to declare a statement of
non-discrimination during Rush
or in their by-laws. In fact, the
fraternities' constitutions are
not open to public scrutiny.
Walters said that by admitting
persons of all sexual orienta
tions, Delta Lambda Phi is pro
gressive. But he added that the
main objective of establishing
the fraternity was not to "make
some kind of protest or get media
attention," although he said

'A lot of pride went
into it.'

publicity is necessary if other
chapters of Delta Lambda Phi
are to form.
"We're not [forming the
fraternity] to say, 'Gays are
great.' We're just trying to be a
part of society."
Walters also said Delta
Lambda Phi was not formed for
matchmaking or for gays to
"meet people."
Kilgore said the fraternity will
not engage in functions exclu
sively with Delta Lambda Delta,
the lesbian sorority, but rather
with all sororities and fraterni
ties.
So far, students have met the
establishment of Delta Lambda
Phi with "more positive than
negative comments," Ross said.
Nevertheless, Walters reported
that threats of violence at the

fraternity's upcoming Rush
events have been made.
Walters saw attitudes of
UCLA Interfraternity Council
president James Rice as another
stumbling block to merging
smoothly with the university fra
ternity system.
"A fraternity in my mind is
part of the traditional American
way, and homosexuality just
doesn't seem to fit into that
traditional view," said Rice last
Thursday, in response to
recognition of the fraternity.
But he also said that the free
dom for minorities to dissent is
"American too."
After Rush this month, the
fraternity expects to have 25
members. Walters said it is "con
ceivable" that all the members
will be gay, since "it is difficult
for a straight person to stick his
neck out" and join the new fra
ternity.
Walters predicted that non
gays will not join the fraternity
until next year.
"It's a matter of educating. We
want people to learn of us just
as human beings .. . not as
sexual animals," he said.

acting openly gay at off-campus
social events, Walters said.
"In some ways you can hide
your homosexuality," he added,
but by doing so, "you're basically
lying."
The new fraternity aims to
provide a setting where "you
don't have to lie about who you
are — which is important," Ross
said.
According to Walters, frater
nities at UCLA make no special
effort to declare a statement of
non-discrimination during Rush
or in their by-laws. In fact, the
fraternities' constitutions are
not open to public scrutiny.
Walters said that by admitting
persons of all sexual orienta
tions, Delta Lambda Phi is pro
gressive. But he added that the
main objective of establishing
the fraternity was not to "make
some kind of protest or get media
attention," although he said

'A lot of pride went
into it.'

publicity is necessary if other
chapters of Delta Lambda Phi
are to form.
"We're not [forming the
fraternity] to say, 'Gays are
great.' We're just trying to be a
part of society."
Walters also said Delta
Lambda Phi was not formed for
matchmaking or for gays to
"meet people."
Kilgore said the fraternity will
not engage in functions exclu
sively with Delta Lambda Delta,
the lesbian sorority, but rather
with all sororities and fraterni
ties.
So far, students have met the
establishment of Delta Lambda
Phi with "more positive than
negative comments," Ross said.
Nevertheless, Walters reported
that threats of violence at the

fraternity's upcoming Rush
events have been made.
Walters saw attitudes of
UCLA Interfraternity Council
president James Rice as another
stumbling block to merging
smoothly with the university fra
ternity system.
"A fraternity in my mind is
part of the traditional American
way, and homosexuality just
doesn't seem to fit into that
traditional view," said Rice last
Thursday, in response to
recognition of the fraternity.
But he also said that the free
dom for minorities to dissent is
"American too."
After Rush this month, the
fraternity expects to have 25
members. Walters said it is "con
ceivable" that all the members
will be gay, since "it is difficult
for a straight person to stick his
neck out" and join the new fra
ternity.
Walters predicted that non
gays will not join the fraternity
until next year.
"It's a matter of educating. We
want people to learn of us just
as human beings .. . not as
sexual animals," he said.
