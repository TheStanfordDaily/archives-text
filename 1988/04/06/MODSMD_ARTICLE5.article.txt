# Kosher kitchen opens in time for Passover

Stanford's new kosher kitchen
opened last week, just in time for
Passover, and Jewish students
said its benefits for the University
are immediate and extensive.
The new kitchen, located in El
liott Program Center, works on a
co-operative basis for dinner, with
an open kitchen for breakfast and
lunch. The cost — $700 per quar
ter — is less than most plans

offered by University Food Serv
ice,
In addition to providing current
students with kosher meals, the
kitchen is expected to help Stan
ford attract more Jewish appli
cants.
Sophomore Jessica Mahlab,
who helped organize the project,
said some Jewish students have
not even considered applying to
Stanford in the past because of
its lack of facilities for those who

wish to keep kosher rules. And
another student sent the Admis
sions Office a letter last quarter
which claimed that several pro
spective freshmen refused offers
from Stanford for this reason.
The University has moved
quickly in the interests of the Hil
lel Foundation, said Hillel repre
sentative Daniella Evans, a junior.
"They have been very reponsive
and helpful," she added.
Before the kitchen was estab

lished, strict Jewish students who
came to Stanford cooked in their
rooms, ate vegetarian meals or
lived off campus with other stu
dents who kept kosher.
Mahlab said one of her aims is
to expand the kitchen's member
ship. Already some Jewish stu
dents have been attracted back to
kosher food, she said. The kitchen
is catering to 30 students during
Passover week and she said its
stores are barely adequate.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson said the kitchen
may have to expand still further
in the fall with the arrival of a
new class. He cautioned, however,
that expansion must move "one
step at a time; we have limited
resources."
Mahlab's said her ultimate goal
is to establish a house with a reg
ular kosher service. Meanwhile,
she is planning dinner-time dis
cussions on a variety of issues.
University officials who helped
establish the kitchen are invited
to dinner there next week, she
said. "We're trying to make it as
homey as possible."
