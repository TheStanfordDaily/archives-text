# Condom contest in second year
## 
### Suzanne Downing 
The 1988 "Great Condom Rating Contest," spon
sored by the Stanford AIDS Education Project, will
give students and community members the oppor
tunity to exercise their voting rights — and more
— this week.
Members of the AEP will give away some 1,500
condom packets, each containing seven different
brands of condoms, in White Plaza between noon
and 1 p.m. today through Friday. Included in the
packets are voting ballots, contest instructions, and
a pseudo-suede condom holder.
This year's contest is being coordinated with
groups at UC-Santa Cruz and Foothill College,
where the contest packets will be distributed at the
same time. When the AEP sponsored its first contest
of this sort last year, the group distributed 500
packets within an hour.
Unlike last year, however, this year's condoms
were donated by manufacturers. Contest coordina
tor and senior Daniel Bao said the 17,500 condoms
that will be distributed in this year's event have
allowed the AEP to broaden the contest, holding it
at other schools.
Bao, who is also the director of AEP, urged stu
dents to pick up their packets early before they run
out. "But there's always more media on the first
day and people shy about cameras might want to
come on Thursday or Friday," he added.
Condoms will be rated for "smell, taste, sensual
ness, resiliency, sense of security and lubrication,"
according to the ballot. Bao stressed that anyone
— novice or expert — can take part in rating the
condoms.
"We're trying to shatter the 'rubber raincoat in
the shower' stereotype that condoms still carry,"
he said. "There are some bad condoms out there

that fit that stereotype, but we want to let people
know that all Condoms arfe not created equal"
Last year the U.S. manufacturer Gold Coin was
chosen as favorite over the Japanese-made
Yamabuki, Bao said. This year's contest will pit
Yamabuki No. 1 against six new competitors. Gold
Coin did not donate to this year's competition.
Some of the highest-rated brands are difficult to
find in stores and, when found, are expensive. More
accessible brands, such as Trojan and Prime, are
the biggest current sellers, Bao said.
"This year we'll see if the contest results show
that Ainerican manufacturers have learned from
the experiences of Detroit and can rise to last year's
Japanese challenge," Bao said.
