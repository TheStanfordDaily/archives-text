In the 1960's an actor/director went looking tor America—
and created a new kind of film The man was Dennis Hopper
Easy Rider was the film that defined an era
As an actor and director, he has always gone to
the edge, taking us places wed never seen before Easy Rider,
Blue Velvet, Rivers Edge
Now, in 1988, we find director Dennis Hopper in the streets of
Los Angeles. In a war zone where gang members and
innocent people alike are killed over territorial emblems of
red and blue Over COLORS And again, he takes us places
we've never seen before with the first realistic motion picture
about the war against street gangs
To do it he has brought together an extraordinary cast and
crew All of them sharing a fierce devotion to the director's
vision. And leading the cast, two motion picture actors of
unparalleled intensity
