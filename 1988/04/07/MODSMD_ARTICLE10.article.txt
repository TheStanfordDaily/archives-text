# Bush, Dukakis top state party picks
## 
### John Cuerva 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Vice President
George Bush will be the Demo
cratic and Republican presidential
candidates, leading California
party officials predicted last night.
Before a group of 35 people in
Branner Hall, Steve Westly, vice
chair of California's Democratic
Party, and Robert Nayior, chair
man of California's Republican
Party — both Stanford alumni —
offered insiders' perspectives on
the races for each party's nomi
nation in an animated debate
sponsored by Stanford in Govern
ment.
Westly emphasized that the Du
kakis nomination is not certain
and hinted that the field may be
open to the appearance of a last
minute candidate.
According to Westly, Dukakis
still faces strong competition from
the "exciting" Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Dukakis must do well in the New
York and Pennsylvania Demo
cratic primaries in order to take
California and New Jersey and
secure the nomination, Westly
said.
Westly stressed, however, that
Jackson could do well in Califor
nia because there is less of a

"racist quotient" here than in
other states.
Echoing the predictions of most
politicians and pundits, Nayior
predicted that Bush will be chosen
as the Republican nominee.
Nayior said Bush's decision on
a vice presidential running mate
may hinge on who the Democrats
choose as a vice presidential nom
inee. According to Nayior, if the

Democratic Party choses Tennes
see Sen. Albert Gore as Dukakis'
running mate, then the Republi
cans will probably nominate a
candidate from "a border state"
to capture Southern votes.
However, Nayior said Republi
can Party leaders are currently
considering California Gov.
George Deukmejian as a possible
vice presidential candidate. Ironi

cally, Nayior said California Re
publican leaders do not want
Deukmejian to accept the spot. If
Deukmejian were to become vice
president, Democratic Lieut. Gov.
Leo McCarthy would become
governor, which would hinder Re
publican efforts to redraw Cali
fornia's congressional districts in
the 1990 reapportionment proc
ess, Nayior said.
