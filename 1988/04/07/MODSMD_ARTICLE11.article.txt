Calling for greater attention
to the plight many Jews face
in foreign countries, Hillel
members staged a rally in
White Plaza yesterday to re

Janet Alder called on about 100

hundred thousand have re
quested the right to leave. We
speak on behalf of some 2.5

Milkes said the rally focused
on separated Jewish families
because this issue had "a more
emotional meaning" and would
draw more sympathy.
"It's not only a problem that
(Jewish) people can't get out
(of the Soviet Union and Ethi
opia); it's also an issue knowing
that families might be left be

In addition, Milkes said writ

"puts a lot of pressure on the
