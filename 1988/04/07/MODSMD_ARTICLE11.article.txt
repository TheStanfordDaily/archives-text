# Rally remembers Jewish refuseniks

### Brent Bigler 
Calling for greater attention
to the plight many Jews face
in foreign countries, Hillel
members staged a rally in
White Plaza yesterday to re
member the divided families of
persecuted Jews in the Soviet
Union and Ethiopia.
Rally organizers David
Milkes, a junior, and senior
Janet Alder called on about 100
onlookers to write letters to six
frustrated Jews who want to
leave the Soviet Union —
known as "refuseniks" — to
"show support for these
people."
Jewish people face many bar
riers to relocating in Israel.
Both the Soviet Union and
Ethiopia refuse to grant visas
to their Jewish citizens, and
Ethiopian Jews often cannot
afford to leave. In some cases,
individuals can leave, but
rarely is a whole family allowed
to emigrate.
In a short speech, John Roth
man, president of the Bay Area

Council of Soviet Jews, said he
hoped President Reagan would
discuss the issue of human
rights for Soviet Jewry in his
trip to Moscow at the end of
next month.
"Soviet Jewry attracts the
support of people across bor
ders," Rothman said. "Four
hundred thousand have re
quested the right to leave. We
speak on behalf of some 2.5
million to 3 million Jews. We
make the appeal for human
rights."
Milkes said the rally focused
on separated Jewish families
because this issue had "a more
emotional meaning" and would
draw more sympathy.
"It's not only a problem that
(Jewish) people can't get out
(of the Soviet Union and Ethi
opia); it's also an issue knowing
that families might be left be
hind," he said.
In addition, Milkes said writ
ing letters to the refuseniks
"puts a lot of pressure on the
government" in the Soviet Union.
He added that the "majority of
the letters don't get to the refuse
niks," but the Soviet government
feels pressured by the amount of
concern expressed by people out
side the country.
Unlike the situation in the So
viet Union, however, it is politi

cally dangerous for Jews in Ethi
opia to receive foreign correspond
ence.
Rothman said 14,000 Jews
remain in Ethiopia "who hope,
wish, believe" they will be able to
leave.
Senior Daniel Zucker read a
concurring anonymous letter
from an Ethiopian Jew who
wrote: "Please extend your help
on our behalf to save us, your
Jewish brothers, who are in dire
times and in great danger in Ethi

opia."
According to Milkes, approxi
mately 10,000 Ethiopian Jews
were taken to Israel through Op
eration Moses, a joint covert proj
ect conducted by the United
States and Israel. Jews were flown
to Israel from refugee camps lo
cated in Sudan, just across the
border from Ethiopia.
However, some people who
could not get to the refugee camps
are still in Ethiopia. These people
were targeted by the rally.
