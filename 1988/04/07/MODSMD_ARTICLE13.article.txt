U.S. to form anti-drug task force
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic —
The Reagan administration is seriously con
sidering the development of a multinational
police force to attack record-setting cocaine
production and to assist governments unable
to control the problem in Colombia and other
cocoa-growing countries in South America, a
senior government official said yesterday.
The unprecedented approach is being
studied by President Reagan's National Drug
Policy Board, which is expected to make an
"expedited" recommendation to Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese, who heads the interagency
panel, a board member said.
The senior official, who spoke on condition
that he not be identified by name, and others
traveling with Meese on a week-long presiden
tial mission to bolster anti-cocaine efforts in
the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru and Bolivia, said that the multinational
force was "very much in the germ-of-an-idea
stage."
Nevertheless, the proposal was a measure
of how seriously the administration, which
recently has been publicly emphasizing domes
tic efforts to reduce cocaine demand, viewed
the "bumper crop" of the narcotic now
flourishing in South American source
countries.
China defends its arms sales
BEIJING — Chinese Foreign Minister Wu
Xueqian yesterday vigorously defended his gov
ernment's increasing international weapons
sales, including the recent sale of intermediate
range ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia.
Wu, speaking at a news conference, con
firmed that China had sold "some non-nuclear,
conventional surface-to-surface missiles" to
Saudi Arabia, and added:
"The Saudi government made a commitment
to us of no transfer, no first use of these
missiles, and to use these missiles entirely for
defensive purposes. We believe that the Saudi
government will honor its commitment."
China's sale of missiles to Saudi Arabia has
caused concern in Israel, even though Saudi
Arabia is believed to want them as protection
against Iran. The missiles, which could be
equipped with nuclear warheads, are capable
of reaching any area in the Middle East. They
could be used with conventional warheads to
attack cities, but are not considered accurate
enough to be useful against military targets.
Iran, Iraq continue missile war
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq yesterday fired four
long-range missiles on Tehran and mounted
air raids on eight other Iranian towns, and
Iran retaliated with missile attacks on Bagh
dad and two other cities.
A Baghdad military spokesman said that
three schoolchildren were killed and 50
civilians were injured, including 41 children
and two teachers, when an Iranian missile
slammed into a school in the southern port
of Umm Qasr near the Kuwaiti border.
The spokesman said another missile landed
on Baghdad yesterday afternoon, killing and
wounding many civilians in a crowded resi
dential district.
Iran said that five children and a woman
were killed and 60 children and hospital
workers were injured by an Iraqi missile that
hit a hospital in Tehran.
Iraq reported air strikes on the towns of
Dezful, Shushtar, Masjid Soleiman, Ham,
Shahpur and Dira.
