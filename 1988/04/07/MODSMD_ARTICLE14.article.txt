# Shultz unveils his Mideast peace plan
## Proposal calls for federation linking Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
### 
AMMAN, Jordan — Secretary of
State George Shultz, in the first public
preview of his ideas for a final Middle
East peace agreement, suggested yes
terday a Jordan-Palestine federation
linking the Hashemite kingdom and the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
Shultz said the estimated 60,000
Jewish settlers now living in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip should be allowed
to stay in their homes if they wish,
provided they are willing to live under
the laws of the Arab-ruled entity.
Shultz made his comments in an in
terview broadcast on Israeli television
last night as he was winding up a hectic
day of meetings in Israel, Egypt and
Jordan. The interview was recorded ear
lier in the day, before he left Jerusalem.
In Amman, Shultz conferred over an

elaborate dinner with King Hussein
about details of the U.S. proposal for
negotiations between Israel and its Arab
neighbors. Although neither Israel nor
Jordan has accepted Shultz's initiative,
the secretary of state applauded Hus
sein for "the kind of approach required
for this process to move ahead."
In contrast, Shultz volunteered no
similar praise for Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir. Without specifically
placing blame on anyone, Shultz said,
"While we have made some progress,
differences have not been substantially
narrowed."
He continued, "We need the willing
ness to explore exhaustively every angle,
every aspect, every word and every im
plication of this initiative — not in a
skeptical search for what may be wrong,
but with a serious commitment to make

it work." He cited no names, but U.S.
officials have said that Shamir fre
quently focuses on what he considers
the deficiencies in the Shultz plan.
Shultz's half-hour interview was his
second long appearance on Israeli tele
vision since he resumed his Middle East
shuttle Sunday.
An interview that Shultz gave Tues
day to Jordanian television was never
broadcast, although Jordanian officials
had said at the time that it would be
shown.
Throughout the day, Shultz stressed
that any ultimate solution must be the
result of negotiations among the parties.
However, he has said that once the
talks begin, the United States will pres
ent its own detailed proposal for a settle
ment.
