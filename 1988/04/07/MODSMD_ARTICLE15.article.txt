# Democrats off to N.Y.

WASHINGTON - The three
active Democratic presidential
candidates headed yesterday for
New York and its rich prize of
255 delegates, with a fresh as
surance from Gov. Mario Cuomo
that he will endorse no one before
the April 19 voting and will do
everything in his power to end
talk that he could be drafted at
the national convention.
Cuomo, in a telephone inter
view, admonished Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee to stop crit
icizing the two leading con
tenders, Massachusetts Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson.
"It does not work, and it's terribly
dangerous," Cuomo said of nega
tive campaigning.
In Washington, party leaders
greeted Dukakis' 48 percent to 28
percent victory over Jackson in
Wisconsin Tuesday as a signal
that Jackson's dramatic success
in Michigan may be hard to du
plicate in the upcoming big turn
out states.
While all three prepared for in
tensive 12-day campaign in New
York, Sen. Paul Simon, D-111.,
scheduled a Capitol Hill news con
ference for today, at which he is
expected to suspend his presiden
tial candiacy.
Simon, who has won only the
primary in his home state, is not
expected to endorse anyone at this

time. By keeping his candidacy
alive at least on paper, he can
hang on to the 169.5 delegates he
has won or is in line to get —
perhaps to play a brokering or
coalescing role after the last pri
maries, which will be June 7.
Meanwhile, Jackson, who was
gracious in his congratulations to
Dukakis on his Wisconsin victory,
arrived in New York last night
promoting party unity and armed
with a new series of issue-oriented
speeches that he hopes will dem
onstrate that he is more than an
emotional orator.
"As we increase now the inten
sity of this campaign, we become
even more specific on how to end
the budget deficit, how to get a
trade balance, how to completely
stop the drug flow," Jackson said.
Dukakis, campaigning briefly in
Queens yesterday, kept to his pos
itive themes, but his state co
chairman, Rep. Gary Ackerman,
D-N.Y., ignored the Cuomo rule
and took a few pokes at Dukakis'
principal rival.
"We don't need a president who
rhymes as much as we need a
president who reasons," he said,
with Dukakis at his side. "People
here have street smarts. They
judge a man by his explanations,
not by his exhortations."
