# Gorbachev, Afghan leader meet over troop pullout
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev traveled to Soviet Central
Asia yesterday to meet Afghan President
apparently to clear away the
last hurdles blocking the start of a Soviet
troop pullout from Afghanistan.
Tass, the official Soviet news agency,
said that Gorbachev arrived in Tash
kent, the capital of Soviet Uzbekistan,
only 200 miles from the Afghan border,
where he was later joined by
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
The brief Tass dispatch gave no details
about the talks, speaking obliquely in
stead about the economic development
of Uzbekistan. But there was immediate
speculation that Gorbachev had traveled
there to take personal charge of the
deliberations surrounding the with
drawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet
troops in Afghanistan, where Moslem
guerrillas have been battling the Soviet
backed government for more than eight
years.
Shevardnadze had been in Kabul, the
Afghan capital, for the past three days
to discuss a proposed settlement with
Najibullah. Gorbachev apparently chose
to see Nsyibullah in Soviet territory as
a safety precaution, since Kabul is
sporadically shelled by guerrillas.

Radio Kabul said that Ncyibullah
would have a "short discussion" with
Gorbachev but gave no details.
In Geneva, the Soviet-backed Afghan
government and Pakistan are discussing
plans for a Soviet pullout under a guar
antee from the United Nations. The
Soviets invaded Afghanistan in Decem
ber 1979 to prop up the country's Marx
ist regime, but Gorbachev recently called
the Soviet presence there "a festering
sore."
Progress at the Geneva talks has been
stymied by Washington's insistence on
"symmetry" — that any cutoff in U.S.
aid to the country's Moslem guerrillas
be accompanied by a parallel suspension
of Soviet military assistance to the Kabul
government.
Shevardnadze, who discussed Afghan
istan with Reagan administration offi
cials during a visit to Washington last
month, rejected the American insistence
on symmetry and said the United States
had reneged on an earlier promise.
The Soviets have said that they would
proceed with the troop withdrawal uni
laterally, even without a Washington-
Moscow agreement that would formally
guarantee the end of hostilities as the
Soviets pulled out.
