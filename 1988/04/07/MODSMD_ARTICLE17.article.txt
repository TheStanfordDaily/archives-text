BEITA, Israeli-Occupied West Bank
— A 15-year-old Israeli girl was stoned
to death by enraged villagers and two
Palestinian youths were killed by gun
fire from settlers yesterday in one of
the most potentially inflammatory in
cidents in four months of violence in
the occupied territories.
At least two other Palestinians were
wounded and 14 Jews, most of them
teenagers, were injured in the clash,
which reportedly began with a tradi
tional Passover hike through nearby
hills and ended in death in this town
of 3,000 near Nablus.
The girl, identified as Tirza Porat
of the West Bank Jewish settlement
of Elon Moreh, was the first civilian
Israeli casualty directly related to the

Palestinian uprising, which began Dec.
9. One Israeli soldier has also been
killed, along with at least 134 Pales
tinians.
The Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Dan Shomron, said last night in an
interview on Israeli Television that the
incident was of "unequaled gravity."
He appealed to the 70,000 Jewish set
tlers in the occupied territories "to
avoid any independent action in
revenge," saying that "this is the job
of the [army]."
Hundreds of troops sealed off Beita
and rounded up all men in the village
for questioning. Journalists were
prevented from entering or interview
ing residents for an independent ac
count of the incident.

Journalists who arrived about dusk
found soldiers blocking the narrow
main road to Elon Moreh, about a
10-minute drive away, in order to
prevent armed and angry settlers from
descending on the Arab village.
Many details of the incident re
mained unclear yesterday. The army,
youths who survived the attack and
American television crews who were
on the scene well before the military,
gave this general account:
Sixteen Jewish youths, mostly from
Elon Moreh, accompanied by two
armed guards, set out yesterday morn
ing on the traditional Passover nature
walk through the lush, hilly country
side. They took vehicles to a point
near the village of Usarin, just south

of here, and planned to hike back to
the settlement.
In the hills just east of Beita they
were attacked by Arab youths who
showered them with stones, some from
slingshots. The two guards fired in
the air in an attempt to frighten the
attackers, but this had no effect and
the group was soon surrounded.
The accounts are not clear on what
happened next. One of the injured
youths, Shmuel Fuchs, 16, told Israel
Television in an interview from a bed
in Tel Hashomer Hospital in Tel Aviv
that one of the Arab youths tried to
snatch a weapon from one of the
guards and that the guard shot him.
