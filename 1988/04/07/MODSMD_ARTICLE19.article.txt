## Some good advice 
### 
DESPITE recent efforts to
improve the quality of its
advising program for un
declared students, Stanford's Un
dergraduate Advising Center has
yet to address some fundamental
problems that plague the program.
In a recent survey, 68 percent
of the graduating seniors labeled
Stanford's academic advising
"poor" or "fair."
Andree Sursock, assistant direc
tor of the UAC, discounts these
figures. Sursock says that the cen
ter has upgraded the program since
1984, when this year's graduating
class entered the system.
In fact, a survey of freshmen
taken by Residential Education in
January confirms the UAC's claim:
Fifty-five percent of the freshmen
said they had received good aca
demic advice.
But these figures are not an
overwhelming endorsement of the
program; the UAC should not stop
trying to improve the program just
because a simple majority of fresh
men says it is satisfied.
Three problems are at the core
of Stanford's mediocre academic
advising program: uncommitted
student Academic Advisers, poorly
trained faculty advisers and a lack
of attention paid to undeclared
sophomores and juniors.
The UAC should make a con
certed effort to strengthen the AA
program by attracting committed
students and keeping them com
mitted. Too many AAs drop out of
the program, and many AA appli

cants view the job as merely a
resume filler.
By initiating a mandatory train
ing course this quarter for next
year's AAs, the UAC has taken a
first step towards improving the
coordinating dorm programs.
Nor should faculty advisers be
exempt from the rigorous training
AAs presently receive. Currently,
all faculty advisers volunteer for
the position and participate in a
mere two-hour training session at
the beginning of the year.
That is hardly sufficient to
prepare advisers for all the com
plex problems they must face.
Although advisers cannot be ex
pected to have the answers to every
question, at the very least they
should be able to refer students to
people who do have answers.
Finally, sophomores — who
usually lose contact with their ad
viser and AA after freshman year
— are overlooked in the present
advising system.
In a crucial year for long-term
planning, sophomores find them
selves preparing for overseas study
or declaring a major with little or
no academic advice. The UAC
should create and publicize more
resources for sophomores.
Successful education depends on
student and faculty commitment
to undergraduate advising. Stan
ford's programs do not provide stu
dents with the best possible advice
and guidance, and that reflects
poorly on the University.
