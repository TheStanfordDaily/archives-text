# Tenure tribulations
## Fac Sen may prolong tenure trial period

Editor's note: This article is the first of
a two-part series examining Stanford's ten
ure system and its effects on the faculty.

Stanford's tenure appointment process,
already known for it stringency, may be
come even tougher.
This year, the Faculty Senate will con
sider a measure that would extend the
tenure track — a mandatory period for
tenure review — from seven to 10 years,
a University official confirmed yesterday.
Vice Provost Noel Kolak said that the
Second Senate Ad Hoc Committee on the
Professoriate, a committee charged by the
senate in March with reviewing the tenure
process, will "seriously consider" the ten
ure track extension.
The announcement comes even as many
"junior" faculty members say they live un
der a shadow of fear that drives them to
consider offers of tenured positions at other
schools.
Kolak, who will sit on the committee,
said although it is too early to know what
the committee's findings will be, "there is
certainly a possibility" it will suggest the
longer review period when making its first
report to the senate by winter quarter of
1988.
According to Communications Prof.
Henry Breitrose, president of the Stanford
chapter of the American Association of Uni
versity Professors, such a proposal would
be opposed by his group.
The Association "would not look kindly
on the University messing with the seven
year period," Breitrose said. "My own

feeling is that seven years is a useful com
promise."
The seven-year track is standard at other
top universities around the country and
was developed by the association.
The tenure period is only one of several
topics to be discussed by the committee,
which will also consider general procedures
and policies governing the tenure and reap
pointment process.
But addressing the question of whether
existing policies drive some faculty away
does not appear to be on the committee's
agenda.
"I haven't heard that as an issue," Kolak
said when asked if the tenure standards
at Stanford were causing professors to
leave for other schools.
However, in a series of interviews with
The Daily, several junior faculty members,
who have asked not to be named, said this
is an important concern.
The prospect of an already rigorous ten
ure process becoming even more stringent
increases the lure of other institutions of
fering larger salaries and automatic tenure,
they said.
Further, widely publicized disputes over
the University's refusal to grant tenure to
different members of the faculty loom in
the memories of many tenure candidates.
One assistant professor who had received
such an offer described his dilemma this
way: "Do you risk job security for the rest
of your life for a prestigious but uncertain
future at Stanford?" He accused the tenure
process at Stanford of being "cruel" and
"inhumane."
