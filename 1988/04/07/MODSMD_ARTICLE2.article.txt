# Tenure tribulations
## Fac Sen may prolong tenure trial period 
### Jeff Album 
Editor's note: This article is the first of
a two-part series examining Stanford's ten
ure system and its effects on the faculty.

Stanford's tenure appointment process,
already known for it stringency, may be
come even tougher.
This year, the Faculty Senate will con
sider a measure that would extend the
tenure track — a mandatory period for
tenure review — from seven to 10 years,
a University official confirmed yesterday.
Vice Provost Noel Kolak said that the
Second Senate Ad Hoc Committee on the
Professoriate, a committee charged by the
senate in March with reviewing the tenure
process, will "seriously consider" the ten
ure track extension.
The announcement comes even as many
"junior" faculty members say they live un
der a shadow of fear that drives them to
consider offers of tenured positions at other
schools.
Kolak, who will sit on the committee,
said although it is too early to know what
the committee's findings will be, "there is
certainly a possibility" it will suggest the
longer review period when making its first
report to the senate by winter quarter of
1988.
According to Communications Prof.
Henry Breitrose, president of the Stanford
chapter of the American Association of Uni
versity Professors, such a proposal would
be opposed by his group.
The Association "would not look kindly
on the University messing with the seven
year period," Breitrose said. "My own

feeling is that seven years is a useful com
promise."
The seven-year track is standard at other
top universities around the country and
was developed by the association.
The tenure period is only one of several
topics to be discussed by the committee,
which will also consider general procedures
and policies governing the tenure and reap
pointment process.
But addressing the question of whether
existing policies drive some faculty away
does not appear to be on the committee's
agenda.
"I haven't heard that as an issue," Kolak
said when asked if the tenure standards
at Stanford were causing professors to
leave for other schools.
However, in a series of interviews with
The Daily, several junior faculty members,
who have asked not to be named, said this
is an important concern.
The prospect of an already rigorous ten
ure process becoming even more stringent
increases the lure of other institutions of
fering larger salaries and automatic tenure,
they said.
Further, widely publicized disputes over
the University's refusal to grant tenure to
different members of the faculty loom in
the memories of many tenure candidates.
One assistant professor who had received
such an offer described his dilemma this
way: "Do you risk job security for the rest
of your life for a prestigious but uncertain
future at Stanford?" He accused the tenure
process at Stanford of being "cruel" and
"inhumane."
Breitrose, who will carefully
study the committee's findings for
the association, agreed with this
characterization. But as one who
has struggled for many years with
issues of Stanford tenure,
Breitrose said he sees no alterna
tive.
"Creating distinctions between
people who are good, very good,
and very, very good is inhumane,"
Breitrose said. But he called the
situation "inevitable."
Figures supplied by the
Provost's Office show that 35
members of the University's fac
ulty are eligible for tenure this
year, with 311 still waiting to be
reviewed. About 875 Stanford fac
ulty already have tenure, al
though many of them got it dur
ing the 1960s and '70s when the
standiirds were reportedly more
relaxed.
A study conducted by Commu
nications Prof. Cliff Nass of
tenures awarded over the last 20
years within the School of Hu
manities and Social Sciences in
dicated that 39.4 percent of junior
faculty win reappointment after
their first three-year term.
However, only 46.7 percent of
those reappointed win tenure
after their second term. Ultimate
ly, only 15.9 percent of those who
begin teaching at Stanford end up
receiving tenure in Humanities
and Social Sciences after complet
ing their seven-year track.
A University wide study of ten

ure figures that includes the
Schools of Engineering, Medicine,
Business and Law has not been
attempted, according to Kolak.
While most faculty and admin
istration members agree that ten
ure standards need to be high,
some professors undergoing ten
ure review question the methods
by which those standards are de
termined. These questions are not
specifically mentioned in the offi
cial charge to the committee on
the professoriate.
Instead, the committee's con
cerns include:
• The subjective nature of the re
quirement calling for letters from
top non-Stanford professionals to
attest that a candidate is one of
the top two or three scholars in
his or her field. One untenured
professor called this "inherently
ludicrous" and "unrealistic."
• The overburdening of junior fac
ulty with administrative chores
that prevent them from develop
ing their research to the satisfac
tion of tenure review committees.
Kolak said junior faculty have
recourse within their depart
ments to have their workloads
lightened, but junior faculty said
some department chairs can be
unsympathetic.
• A perception among junior fac
ulty that being known for concen
trating too hard on teaching often
leads tenure committees to ques
tion the scholarship of a candi
date. Some faculty members
jokingly refer to the annual
Dinkespiel Award recognizing
teaching excellence as the "kiss
of death" because many recipients
are later denied tenure.

• Whether secretive deliberations
by department tenure committees
and the Tenure and Promotions
Board produce political decisions
that infringe on academic freedom
and are not based solely on the
candidate's scholastic merit. The
recent tenure denials of Norm
Davies and Stephen Ferruolo at
the History Department raised
these issues in court, where ac
cusations of discrmination were
dismissed and the confidentiality
of tenure voting upheld.
Most of the faculty interviewed
in this investigation said they ap
preciate the need for confiden
tiality in tenure review but still
suspect that political considera
tions are often a candidate's un
doing.
The final decision on who will
sit on the senate committee is
still being debated and will un
doubtedly affect whether and how
these issues are addressed.
Appointments to the committee
should be completed by early next
week.
Biology Prof. Phillip Hanawalt,
chairs the committee, was un
available for comment. The un
determined senate members on
the committee will also be joined
by Kolak and Provost James
Rosse.
Kolak said in the administra
tion's view, there is no desire to
make the tenure process more dif
ficult, but she hadn't made up
her mind yet on the issue of ex
tending the seven-year tenure
track period.
The committee will also take a
look at faculty outside of the ten
ure track.

receiving tenure in Humanities
and Social Sciences after complet
ing their seven-year track.
A University wide study of ten

ure figures that includes the
Schools of Engineering, Medicine,
Business and Law has not been
attempted, according to Kolak.
While most faculty and admin
istration members agree that ten
ure standards need to be high,
some professors undergoing ten
ure review question the methods
by which those standards are de
termined. These questions are not
specifically mentioned in the offi
cial charge to the committee on
the professoriate.
Instead, the committee's con
cerns include:
• The subjective nature of the re
quirement calling for letters from
top non-Stanford professionals to
attest that a candidate is one of
the top two or three scholars in
his or her field. One untenured
professor called this "inherently
ludicrous" and "unrealistic."
• The overburdening of junior fac
ulty with administrative chores
that prevent them from develop
ing their research to the satisfac
tion of tenure review committees.
Kolak said junior faculty have
recourse within their depart
ments to have their workloads
lightened, but junior faculty said
some department chairs can be
unsympathetic.
• A perception among junior fac
ulty that being known for concen
trating too hard on teaching often
leads tenure committees to ques
tion the scholarship of a candi
date. Some faculty members
jokingly refer to the annual
Dinkespiel Award recognizing
teaching excellence as the "kiss
of death" because many recipients
are later denied tenure.

• Whether secretive deliberations
by department tenure committees
and the Tenure and Promotions
Board produce political decisions
that infringe on academic freedom
and are not based solely on the
candidate's scholastic merit. The
recent tenure denials of Norm
Davies and Stephen Ferruolo at
the History Department raised
these issues in court, where ac
cusations of discrmination were
dismissed and the confidentiality
of tenure voting upheld.
Most of the faculty interviewed
in this investigation said they ap
preciate the need for confiden
tiality in tenure review but still
suspect that political considera
tions are often a candidate's un
doing.
The final decision on who will
sit on the senate committee is
still being debated and will un
doubtedly affect whether and how
these issues are addressed.
Appointments to the committee
should be completed by early next
week.
Biology Prof. Phillip Hanawalt,
chairs the committee, was un
available for comment. The un
determined senate members on
the committee will also be joined
by Kolak and Provost James
Rosse.
Kolak said in the administra
tion's view, there is no desire to
make the tenure process more dif
ficult, but she hadn't made up
her mind yet on the issue of ex
tending the seven-year tenure
track period.
The committee will also take a
look at faculty outside of the ten
ure track.

Stanford's tenure appointment process,
already known for it stringency, may be
come even tougher.
This year, the Faculty Senate will con
sider a measure that would extend the
tenure track — a mandatory period for
tenure review — from seven to 10 years,
a University official confirmed yesterday.
Vice Provost Noel Kolak said that the
Second Senate Ad Hoc Committee on the
Professoriate, a committee charged by the
senate in March with reviewing the tenure
process, will "seriously consider" the ten
ure track extension.
The announcement comes even as many
"junior" faculty members say they live un
der a shadow of fear that drives them to
consider offers of tenured positions at other
schools.
Kolak, who will sit on the committee,
said although it is too early to know what
the committee's findings will be, "there is
certainly a possibility" it will suggest the
longer review period when making its first
report to the senate by winter quarter of
1988.
According to Communications Prof.
Henry Breitrose, president of the Stanford
chapter of the American Association of Uni
versity Professors, such a proposal would
be opposed by his group.
The Association "would not look kindly
on the University messing with the seven
year period," Breitrose said. "My own

feeling is that seven years is a useful com
promise."
The seven-year track is standard at other
top universities around the country and
was developed by the association.
The tenure period is only one of several
topics to be discussed by the committee,
which will also consider general procedures
and policies governing the tenure and reap
pointment process.
But addressing the question of whether
existing policies drive some faculty away
does not appear to be on the committee's
agenda.
"I haven't heard that as an issue," Kolak
said when asked if the tenure standards
at Stanford were causing professors to
leave for other schools.
However, in a series of interviews with
The Daily, several junior faculty members,
who have asked not to be named, said this
is an important concern.
The prospect of an already rigorous ten
ure process becoming even more stringent
increases the lure of other institutions of
fering larger salaries and automatic tenure,
they said.
Further, widely publicized disputes over
the University's refusal to grant tenure to
different members of the faculty loom in
the memories of many tenure candidates.
One assistant professor who had received
such an offer described his dilemma this
way: "Do you risk job security for the rest
of your life for a prestigious but uncertain
future at Stanford?" He accused the tenure
process at Stanford of being "cruel" and
"inhumane."
Breitrose, who will carefully
study the committee's findings for
the association, agreed with this
characterization. But as one who
has struggled for many years with
issues of Stanford tenure,
Breitrose said he sees no alterna
tive.
"Creating distinctions between
people who are good, very good,
and very, very good is inhumane,"
Breitrose said. But he called the
situation "inevitable."
Figures supplied by the
Provost's Office show that 35
members of the University's fac
ulty are eligible for tenure this
year, with 311 still waiting to be
reviewed. About 875 Stanford fac
ulty already have tenure, al
though many of them got it dur
ing the 1960s and '70s when the
standiirds were reportedly more
relaxed.
A study conducted by Commu
nications Prof. Cliff Nass of
tenures awarded over the last 20
years within the School of Hu
manities and Social Sciences in
dicated that 39.4 percent of junior
faculty win reappointment after
their first three-year term.
However, only 46.7 percent of
those reappointed win tenure
after their second term. Ultimate
ly, only 15.9 percent of those who
begin teaching at Stanford end up
receiving tenure in Humanities
and Social Sciences after complet
ing their seven-year track.
