## Meaning of Dollies' name has changed over years 
### 
IN RESPONSE to R. Suzanne
Swann's letter of April 5, which
labels the name (and names the
label) "Dollie" as degrading to women,
dolls and sexist toys throughout the
world, we would simply like to say,
"My, how interesting."
Let us enlighten you.
The Dollies have been a part of
Stanford since the 1940s and were
integrated into the Band in the 19505.
At that time the name "Dollie" was
seriously debated between the drum
the drum general and the drum
rear admiral (the Band was military
style previous to 1963).
The name was seen as possibly
sexist and also possibly an infringe
ment on Mattel's efforts to secure the

term "doll" as a registered trademark.
Fortunately both issues were resolved
without much conflict, as Mattel was
unsuccessful, and the focus of the
name "Dollie" was shifted considerably,
according to the following timeline:
• 1963 — The Band abandons military
style entirely, but establishes a link to
the past by retaining Dollies, entirely
conscious of this subtle allusion to
Salvador Dali's 1931 work, "The Per
sistence of Memory."
• 1973 — Band members demand that
the name "Dollie" be officially spelled
with an 'ie' at the end in order to
divorce it entirely from the word "dol
ly," which according to the Oxford
English Dictionary, has the rather

disgusting definition of "attractive,
fashionable girl, etc."
• 1976 — As a salute to the Bicenten
nial and to the founding fathers of our
great nation, the Band officially links
the Dollies to Dolly Madison. The
Madison Estate was asked to change
the spelling of Dolly to match the
Band's preferred spelling. They said
they would think about it.
• 1980 — The Band alerts Bil Keane
(of "Family Circus" fame) that his
cartoon character "Dolly" may encoun
ter some resistance from graduate
students in operations research. The
Band heartily approves of Keane's
name "Barfy" for a family pet. Keane
replies cordially, thanking the Band for
its concern and asks what operations

research is.
• 1983 — The Band establishes the
name "Dollie" as also associated with
the term dolly as a "platform on a
roller or on wheels or casters for
moving heavy objects." This, they say,
salutes the Dollies' functional purpose,
fluidity of movement and repeated
assistance in carrying the tuba cases.
In sum then, our point is that the
Stanford Dollies do not in any way
"represent" Barbie dolls, rag dolls or
dolls that wet (either on command or
otherwise). Thank you, however, for
your concern.
