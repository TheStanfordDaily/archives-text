# The 						Bug overlooked facts on sororities
## 
### 
It's spring quarter at good ol' Stan
ford, and the bugs are out on the
rampage. And not just hanging off the
trees. It seems as though one bug in
particular has chosen to hang around
in his very own Daily column.
Bug me? Yes, it did. I am refering to
"Bug Me's" observations of April 5
regarding the sorority rush system,
which I am sure as a male, he is well
acquainted with. Allow me to clear up
a few of his misunderstandings.
Sorry to disappoint the Bug, but he
or any other male would never be in
vited to participate in a sorority's
party or skit. No men may attend.
Rush is a time for interested women
to (albeit hurriedly) meet the members
of each sorority, not the men with
whom they associate.
The skits may occasionally be sen
timental, but they are never as inane
as he his depicted them. They serve to

showcase the talents of members and
the quality results of teamwork and
sisterhood. They seem not to "dis
courage the sane from joining." Statis
tics prove otherwise, as approximately
25 percent of Stanford women are
presently affiliated with Greek organi
zations.
Yet another point about which he
appears to be misinformed is the role
of the "Rush counselor." Her sole pur
pose is not to answer such ditzy, shal
low questions as he dreamt up in his
column.
She functions as a nonpartisan ad
visor, a spokeswoman for all sororities,
who answers questions regarding the
technicalities of Rush. Perhaps he
should contact one before waxing such
"witty" and unfounded commentary
again.
But don't get me wrong here — I
appreciate his "insightful" observations
as much as he seems to appreciate
sororities. But he seems to have for
gotten the first rule of journalism:
Just the facts, Bug, just the facts.
As a reporter, he should know how

to get them. Crash a Rush party. He
just might be "very impressed by the
way the potential pledges are han
dled. ..
