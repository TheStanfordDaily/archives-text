# Israel's actions like South Africa
## 
### 
We agree with Rabbi Ari Mark Car
tun's remark in his April 5 Viewpoint
that .. we and the media should
clarify rather than cloud issues for
more constructive understanding of
world events." Unfortunately, the bulk
of his Viewpoint undermines this state
ment.
Rabbi Cartun refutes the compari
sons of Israel's treatment of Palestini
ans with South Africa's treatment of
blacks; however, in building his argu
ment, he seems to miss the point. Ob
viously there are differences: Jews are
not a small minority whereas the
white South Africans are; race divides
South Africa while nationalism divides

Israel.
There are any number of distinctions
one could draw, but these details are
not very important in the context of
Rabbi Carton's claim. It is the way
Israel is attemping to quell the upris
ing in the occupied territories that
invites the comparisons.
Unfortunately, Rabbi Cartun neatly
skirts the issue of the treatment of the
Palestinians in the occupied territory
first by focusing on the rights of Pal
estinians living in Israel, then by deny
ing that people in the occupied ter
ritories should have any say in Israeli
politics (despite the fact that Israel has
total military and economic control
over these areas), and finally, by pass
ing the conflict off as typical "ethnic
tension."
Rabbi Cartun's desire to impart a
clear understanding of the Palestinian
issue was commendable. We only wish
he had done so.
