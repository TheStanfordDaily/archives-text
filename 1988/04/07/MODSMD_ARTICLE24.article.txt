## Safe sex isn't a game 
### 
IN THESE DAYS of paranoia and fear
of sexually transmitted diseases, it is
encouraging to find students actively
educating the University community on
issues surrounding safe sex and AIDS.
The Stanford AIDS Education Project,
for example, should be given a great deal
of credit for its contributions to the level
of AIDS awareness on our campus.
However, the latest undertaking of
Stanford's AIDS Education Project, the
"1988 Great Condom Rating Contest,"
raises many questions of the propriety
and ethics of such a program. In dealing
with safe sex, the issues of caution and
responsibility should be kept at the fore
front of student awareness.
The AEP flyer calls to mind a "fun
and games with condoms" approach to
the program, A cartoon on the flyer shows
and man and a woman comparing the
virtues of literally showering in raincoats
with the prospect of engaging in sex with
condoms, saying that "showering with
your raincoat on is a lot less fun than
sex with condoms."
Its caption invites the entire University
to "join [the AEP] in shattering the 'Rub
ber Raincoat' Myth." Clearly, the flyers
are designed to catch attention and spur
open discussion of the condom issue. Yet
it is not so clear that the AEP has
thoughtfully dealt with all of the impli
cations of their program.
While knowledge about acquired im
mune deficiency syndrome is crucial to
fighting its spread and openness to con
doms and protection from sexually trans
mitted diseases is important, it is impor

tant for organizations to get their edu
cational messages across to the student
body in a manner that does not promote
or unconsciously advocate casual sex.
The AEP feels that their project is vital
in bringing condoms into the no-man's
land of ignorant students. And it very
definitely is. I'm sure that hundreds of
students who would have never felt com
fortable going to the Contraceptive In
formation Center, will feel bold enough
to grab their six-pack of condoms at the
booth in White Plaza.
Part of the project's success, no doubt,
will be the vast range and number of
students that it reaches due to its infor
mal, relaxed presentation. But turning
an educational program into a rating
game invariably extends its implications
beyond education.
True, sexually active students need ex
posure to measures that help prevent
disease. But giving out multi-packs of
condoms with the instructions to try
them out (in whatever way you feel is
appropriate) and to send back the results
in a week, seems to convey the message
that caution in sexual encounters is un
necessary, that condoms alone are im
penetrable protection. It serves to rein
force the notion that casual sex is okay
and that sexual activity is the norm.
The fun-and-games approach, while
serving as effective publicity and mar
keting, devalues the advice that has come
before the program — the advice to
proceed with a great deal of caution and
responsibility in sexual matters, the ad
vice that abstinence is acceptable.

Many people who see the flyer and
participate in the contest won't even see
casual sex and responsibility as a relevant
issue. But the point is precisely that:
Turning AIDS awareness into a game
makes people forget the dangers inherent
in sex. It makes people less attuned to
the special personal responsibility that
goes with sex and more willing to play
dangerous games.
Even the prospect of saving lives does
does not excuse the sponsors of the pro
gram from dismissing the wider implica
tions of the message they advertise. Say
ing that everyone will eiy'oy shattering
the rubber raincoat myth is an entirely
different and less responsible message
than saying that safe sex is the only
intelligent sex.
Daniel Bao of the AEP says the project
takes the stand that "sex is a natural
function — as natural as walking. If you
look at sex that way, then the analogy
is that we are simply giving out condoms
like free pairs of shoes for you to try on."
If life was that simple and sex that
safe, we could simply buy replacement
soles for those who now suffer the con
sequences of opportunistic disease.
