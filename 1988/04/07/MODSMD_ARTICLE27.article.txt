## A 						'helping hand': new tool for deaf-blind people 
### Eric Ly Staff writer 
Communication, such a natural
part of daily activity, is taken for
granted by most. Whether one is
an astronaut, an office worker or
a manual laborer, communication
is a basic necessity for living.

But for the estimated 15,000
people in this country who are
both blind and deaf, communica
tion is a daily struggle that often
leaves them in isolation from
others, even from people in the
same room.
In the future, however, they
may be able to overcome this con
finement. A robotic hand cur
rently being developed by Stan
ford students and researchers at
Palo Alto's Veterans Administra
tion Medical Center may offer
new opportunities for the deaf
blind.
The robotic hand, Dexter, may
give those without sight and
hearing a powerful new commu
nications link to the world.
Deaf-blind people can now only
communicate by spelling out
words letter by letter by touching
another person's hand, a tech
nique called finger spelling.
Finger spelling has several

limitations, according to David
Jaffe, a research biomedical en
gineer at the Medical Center.
Finger spelling only allows inter
action with others who are both
knowledgeable in sign language
and are willing to participate in
hands-on-hands communication.
"The problem is that the deaf
blind person is totally dependent
on this person (who knows the
technique), and there are very few
people who know finger spelling,"
Jaffe said.
With Dexter, however, a deaf
blind person can receive a mes
sage through a mechanical hand,
which finger spells on the person's
hand in response to a message
typed into a computer keyboard.
Dexter has already proven to
be easy to use in tests with a
small number of deaf-blind people
from the Lions Blind Center in
Oakland. Jaffe said the subjects
were able to identify most of the
letters presented by the robot
hand.
"They needed no instructions
and in less than an hour were
correctly interpreting sentences.
They seemed to enjoy using it and
were intrigued by its novelty,"
Jaffe said.
Dexter started as a project in
a mechanical engineering course
three years ago and was initially
designed by students John
Danssaert, Alan Greenstein,
Patricia Lee and Alex Meade. The
class project was sponsored by the
Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research
Foundation of San Francisco.
Deborah Gilden, co-director of
the foundation, launched the proj
ect after receiving $10,000 from
the U.S. Department of Educa
tion's National Institute on Dis
ability and Rehabilitation Re
search. Gilden is responsible for
the evaluation and testing of Dex
ter.

The mechanical hand can also
be connected to computers to pro
vide vocational and avocational
training and other opportunities
to the deaf-blind community, op
portunities that have eluded them
before, Jaffe said.
"The need for interpreters pos
sibly makes the deaf-blind person
feel more dependent," Jaffe said.
In fact, JafTe said most deaf
blind people are dependent on
finger spelling as the only form
of communication because they
fail to learn other systems of com
munication, such as Braille.
The dependence occurs fre
quently with deaf-blind adults
who have Usher's Syndrome, an
illness which is not detected until
the damage is irreversible. Ush
er's Syndrome is characterized by
deafness at birth followed by a
gradual loss of vision beginning
in the late teens or early twenties.
Usher's patients typically ex
perience a decrease in peripheral
vision, followed by a gradual loss
of central vision.
Most young Usher's children,
who have not been diagnosed, fail
to learn Braille because educators
believe that teaching them sign
language is enough. The disease
is usually not diagnosed until the
onset of visual impairment, JafTe
said.
Braille is difficult to learn that
late in life, and even more so for
the elderly, according to JafTe.
Once its design is perfected, Dex
ter will help these people commu
nicate without assistance.
In testing the hand, however,
researchers found some slight
problems with the representation
of some of the gestures, JafTe said.
The researchers also recognized
that Dexter needed to work faster.
Dexter finger spelled at about
two-and-a-half letters per second,
while the subjects could interpret

the gestures twice as fast, JafTe
said.
A group of mechanical engi
neering students at Stanford is
currently trying to improve on
Dexter's design. These research
ers say that they will next try to
improve on representations of the
finger spelling alphabet and to
enable the mechanical hand to
make smooth transitions from
one letter to another.
Improvements like those will
not be enough, however. Signifi
cant design changes are needed
to make Dexter a practical com
mercial product, Jaffe said.
"There's a lot of work to be done,
and it's going to be a challenge,"
he said.
The problems that need to be
solved include reducing the size
of the tank of compressed air cur
rently used to activate Dexter's
finger movements, which now oc
cupies the space of two large office
filing cabinets and is potentially
dangerous.
Another problem is that cur
rently Dexter's intricate alumi
num hand requires thousands of
hours of handiwork by a skilled
craftsman to construct, making it
too complicated for mass produc
tion.
The researchers are optimistic,
despite these problems, that they
can reduce its size to that of a
brief case so it can be offered for
sale within five years. To ac
complish this, they are consider
ing the use of plastic molded fin
gers and electric motors.
Since Dexter only lets the deaf
blind receive messages, research
ers are also trying to devise a
computerized glove that will let
them talk back to Dexter. This
project is being led by Jim
Kramer, a doctoral candidate in
mechanical engineering.

According to Jaffe, the ultimate
goal of the entire project is to
make Dexter portable so that a
deaf-blind person "will be able to
pop up the hand and communicate

with anybody anywhere."
"Although Dexter won't solve
all the problems of deaf-blind
(people), it will at least give them
a helping hand," he said.
