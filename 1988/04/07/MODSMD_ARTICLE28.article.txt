William F. Buckley's latest spy
thriller, "Mongoose, R.1.P.,"
chronicles the continuing, tur
bulent adventures of top CIA hit
man, Blackford Oakes. The title
refers to the JFK/CLA program to
depose Fidel Castro. For dramatic
purposes, Buckley has Kennedy
resurrect the abortive project, in
1963 — a secret even within the
CIA — with agent Oakes as the
man responsible for Castro's as
sassination and for the institution
of an acceptable successor.
Oakes takes to his super-secret
mission with a vengeance. Mean
while, mainstream CIA agents,
unaware of Oakes' plan, stumble
through their own plots, which
fall into the "poison in his beer"
category.
Paradoxically, the premise of
"Mongoose" both lends it realism
and contributes heavily to its in
herent tedium. Indeed, the his
torical events in this fictional
book have been well documented.
In fact, the plot tends to unfold
like an embellishment of congres
sional reports. However, Fidel
Castro's life was not taken in
1963. Hence Buckley's challenge:
how to generate tension in the
book the' historical outcome of
which is never in doubt.
Buckley is aware of this chal
lenge, and he plays on it. Not only
does the title ("R.1.P.") admit his
torical defeat, but Buckley goes
so far as to include — in lieu of
a disclamatory introduction —
two historical quotations. The
first comes from a 1975 Senate
report on CIA activity, and the
second from Buckley's own mag
azine, National Review. The first
statement affirms the existence
of the assassination attempts
while the second mocks their fail
ure.
Thus, as Oakes marches and
the rest of the CIA stumbles
towards an anti-Castro coup, the

reader is constantly aware that
they are going to fail. It's like
watching James Bond and
knowing that he won't die — if
we stopped to think about it, it
would ruin the suspense, but we
don't, so it doesn't.
However, Buckley takes few
pains to encourage his reader to
suspend disbelief. Even though it
remains conscious of general his
torical facts, "Mongoose" tends to
trudge along as though in a
swamp, pausing to point out the
necessary historical vermin. To
his credit, Buckley saves the end
ing with a Cuban counterplot, dis
covered by Oakes, "that," to quote
the sleeve's tease, "only inciden
tally calls for the death of Oakes
himself."
If one looks at the book
charitably as a work of historical
fiction, it's OK. Buckley spared
his staff no pains in researching
Cuban history, congressional and
news media reports, and fine tech
nical details. The best of these
details is the logistical operation
of a Soviet SS-4 missile which
Castro discovers left over from
the Cuban missile crisis, and
which he plans to use to assure

retaliation against President Ken
nedy.
Nonetheless, "Mongoose" fails
all around as a sustained creative
effort. The enjoyable prepon
derance of detail — how a poison
will work, the complications of
donning a disguise, and, of course,
the obligatory chapter on yachting
— masks but can not compensate
for the book's irritating lack of
driving plot or depth of character.
Buckley's lengthy flashback to the
"heroine's" traumatic childhood,
for example, seems to exist merely
as a shallow, plot-driven tech
nicality to justify her later separa
tion form Oakes.
And it is difficult to entertain
deep sympathy for Oakes himself,
when, having learned of his
girlfriend's betrayal, all one is told
is that "(he) felt the blood drain
from his head." Then he goes
sailing, in silent lamentation.
In sum, unless one has a deep
affection for the protagonist, the
author or for mediocre historical
fiction, this volume merits little,
if any, notice, and certainly not
the price of a hardback.
