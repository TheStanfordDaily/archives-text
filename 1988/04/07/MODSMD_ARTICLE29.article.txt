The colonization of Australia
was modern humanity's first ex
periment in large-scale social
engineering. Or, as Robert
Hughes puts it in his excellent
book: "In Australia, England
drew the sketch for our own
century's vaster and more ter
rible fresco of repression, the
Gulag."
From 1787 to 1868, the
British empire used Australia
as a dumping ground for "the
criminal class" of England and
Ireland, converting an island
continent the size of Europe
into a giant, meticulously bu
reaucratic prison.
In"The Fatal Shore" Robert-
Hughes, an Australian and art
critic for Time magazine, claims
that penal Australia had four
functions: "sublimate, deter,
reform and colonize." Although
it succeeded only in coloniza
tion, Australia's youth, which
Hughes chronicles, was a wild,
chilling and fascinating one.
To begin with, it was concep
tually bizarre. The notion of a
huge, natural penitentiary, lo
cated at the end of the world,
had no precedent. But the
Crown was enthusiastic about
Australia, sending 825 shiploads
of approximately 200 prisoners
each during the course of
"transportation."
Moreover, the system was
cruel, and its cruelty fuels our
fascination. The transport ships
were nightmares — disease,
scurvy and sadism ran rampant
below the cramped decks of the
early transports. Worse even
than the transport ships, how
ever, were the Australian jails
— isolated prisons within a
prison, such as Van Dieman's

Land and, especially, Norfolk Is
land — which reached a level
of institutionalized cruelty and
degradation which can only be
compared to the concentration
camps of a hundred years later.
In these places, warped men,
backed up by. the isolation of
the antipodes and the faceless
power of the colonial bureau
cracy, exercised the peculiar,
methodical evil of the absolute
lord charged with a task of
misery.
But, in general, Australia was
not hell for the convicts — it
was just hard. At the heart of
life in Australia was the bureau
cratic System, which assigned
convicts to labor on the farms

of free seders for the term of
their conviction. Basically, early
Australia existed as a slave eco
nomy with the continent's most
precious commodity, convict
labor, controlled by the colonial
administration.
This book should be read for
three reasons: First, the subject
matter. Second, Robert Hughes'
colossal skill as a writer. Third,
the perspective that Hughes
brings to the book. His refresh
ing, art critic's eye analyzes his
tory as it would a canvas, and
the result is both refreshing and
beautiful.
