# ASSU panel changes endorsement after racism charge
## 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
Amid charges of racism, a new ASSU
senate committee last night awarded a
black student an endorsement that had
previously been awarded to a white stu
dent.
The controversy began at Tuesday
night's senate meeting, when the Black
Student Union criticized the selection
process the ASSU uses to determine
service project managers. BSU Presi
dent Bill King charged that a "different
set of criteria" was used to judge black
candidates, and he specifically cited
three cases in which he believed "rac
ism" had influenced the decision proc
ess.
One of those cases — involving ra
cially related interview questions by the
ASSU interviewing committee — had
already been resolved. Interviewers
apologized to black sophomore Lloyd
Metz for the questions shortly after his
interview ended and Tuesday night rec
ommended him for chair of the ASSU
Nominations Commission. Metz gained
senate approval Tuesday, bringing the
total number of black students ap
pointed to 10 of 12 who interviewed for
positions.
In the other two cases, the senate set
up two special committees to repeat the
selection process after denying those
recommended sets of people the two

thirds vote required for approval.
One of the two new committees was
directed to re-select recommendations
for two jobs in the ASSU Office of Public
Affairs, the director of public affairs
and the advertising manager. The other
committee was ordered to re-select the
director and assistant director of ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
The BSU had challenged both sets of
recommendations at the senate meeting
Tuesday, making charges of procedural
problems that resulted in discrimina
tion.
Last night, the first committee
changed the recommendations for di
rector of public affairs. An earlier com
mittee had recommended that sopho
more Deanna Terzian, a white student,
be granted the position. Last night's
committee, however, decided to recom
mend junior Rachel Wiesen, a black stu
dent, after re-interviewing the two can
didates.
The second committee has not yet
met. It will reconsider the recommended
appointment of a white student over a
black student to the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
Wiesen's selection remains tentative
"pending senate confirmation," said
Senate Chair David Smolen, a senior.
The full senate will discuss the issue
and the recommendations at a special
meeting Monday.
The earlier committee, consisting of

junior Leonard Adler — a candidate for
the Council of Presidents on the Ener
gizers slate — and sophomore Sheilon
King, recommended Terzian for the
public affairs directorship and Wiesen
for the position of advertising manager.
Wiesen said at Tuesday night's senate
meeting that she had been "switched"
to advertising manager because she is
black.
Adler denied that the original com
mittee had "switched" Wiesen. "No one
had been assured of any position," he
said. "No one was 'switched' from any
position to another position."
Sen. David Teich warned that the
selection process may not yet be over.
"It could get complicated," he said.
"Serious questions were raised about
what happened and whether (the rec
ommendation) will stay," he added.
Teich, a graduate student, added that
tensions in the ASSU have been in
creased by Tuesday night's charges of
racism. "Everyone's walking on eg
gshells," he said. "A lot of people at
this point in the senate are not talking
to each other." he said.
COP member Maria Can as, who was
a member of last night's new committee
on public affairs, said she believed the
latest committee's recommendations
will be confirmed by the full senate.
"We asked basically the same questions
of each candidate," she said.
