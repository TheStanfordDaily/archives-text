## Swimmers race for checkered flag at Indy 'Longshots' confident about nabbing 5th NCAA title 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Luckily the men s swim
ming team believes in it
self, for not many others
do. Entering the NCAA
Championships which
run today through Sat
urday in Indianapolis,

the three-time defending national cham
pion Cardinal is considered a longshot
for the 1988 title, even after defeating
No. 1 USC in the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships by 149 points.
But the Stanford squad is confident
of its chances of attaining a fourth
straight and fifth-overall national
crown.
"The team looks better now than we
have all season, even better than at
Pac-10's," senior tri-Captain Anthony
Mosse said. "We really think we can
win."
Unlike the previous three years, how
ever, when the Cardinal had the aid of
11-time national champions Pablo
Morales and JefT Kostoff, the meet will
not be a breeze. Last year, the squad
had the meet wrapped up by the second
day of the three-day competition and
won by over 100 points. This weekend
the squad has to battle favorites USC
and Texas as well as the up-and-coming
Florida and California squads.
"Experts have USC and Texas
favored, with Stanford and Cal battling
for third place," Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney said. "But even if we're not
favored we are going to be in the hunt."
"This year there is just more pressure
to swim fast individually," American
100-yard backstroke record holder Jay
Mortenson said, "because everyone's
points are going to be very important
to the team score. Last year we had so
much power we knew we were going to
win."
In addition to its championship ex
perience, the Cardinal brings with it
one of the largest squads in the nation
— 16 swimmers and one diver. In con
trast, the Trojans are carrying only 10
swimmers and no divers, so Stanford
has a definite advantage in point-scoring

potential if all of its competitors come
through.
In fact, the Trojans' and Longhorns'
top swimmers compete in many of the
same events, so Kenney is hoping they
will detract points from each other in
the team tallies. Stanford is also count
ing on Florida and Cal to take away
points from USC and Texas in events
that will not injure Stanford.
"The newer teams on the block are
all competing for the same points in
the freestyle events, while we are real
strong in the strokes, especially fly and
breast," said Mortenson.
The Cardinal will be led by a fairly
large core of NCAA scorers, including
a former individual national champion.
Backstroker Sean Murphy was 200-back
champion in both 1985 and 1986, and
is considered a favorite to retain his
title in Indianapolis.
Along with Murphy, a number of
Stanford competitors and relay teams
have legitimate shots at capturing titles
or at least placing in the top three.
Mosse, who has been in the shadow of
Morales for the past three seasons, is
one of the favorites in the 200 fly, and
Mortenson is favored in the 100 fly as
well as the 100 back.
John Witchel has a shot at the 200
free, freshman Matt Rodgers could very
possibly win a gold in the 200 breast,
and sophomore Lunn Lestina has an
outside chance in the 500 free.
The medley relay team is one of the
favorites, and the 400- and 800-free
relay squads are in the running for
top-three honors.
In addition, individual medlier Matt
Nance, freestyler John Hodge,
breaststroker Sam Schwartz and sprint
freestyler Doug Lillydahl bring both in
dividual and relay finalist experience to
the meet.
According to Kenney, the relay teams,
especially the three-time defending na
tional champion medley team, will be
a key to the Cardinal's success. He also
feels the performance of diver Matt
Frawley, Western Regional one- and
three-meter champion, will be of much
importance to the team considering the

fact that neither USC nor Cal qualified
divers. But above all, Kenney is espe
cially counting on the performance of
the "middle eight."
"The big guns (Mosse, Murphy, Mor
tenson and Witchel) need to come in
first, second or third," Kenney said.
"But the meet will be decided on how
the middle eight of our swimming corps
perform — whether they place in the
low finals or are in the consolation
heat."
Since USC's best events are on the
first day, Stanford is looking only to
gain momentum today and be within
15 points of the leader. "We know USC
is going to be very strong on the first
day, especially in the 500 free, but if
we are within a certain number of points
we can definitely catch up on the second
and third days," Mosse said. "If we start
a good roll we know that no team can
take us."
The squad consensus is that the Car
dinal has a fairly good shot at taking
the crown if everyone just swims his
best or times similar to those at Pac
10's. In other words, Stanford has a
legitimate shot to win without excep
tional performances. According to Ken
ney, over 40 percent of last year's cham
pionship heat times were equal to or
slower than times clocked in conference
championship meets, so the majority of
the Cardinal squad just needs to main
tain their current times and the team
will be in the running.
"Everyone is confident that we can
win if everyone swims well. Super
human performances are not neces
sary," Schwartz said.
The swimmers also feel the Cardinal
will be victorious if no mental mistakes
are committed by the competitors.
"We just can't make any mistakes —
no disqualifications or letting down on
the second day," Lillydahl said. "But I
don't think anything is going to go
wrong. We're swimming really well and
coming into the meet with a lot of mo
mentum."
"I realized that this would be an end
of-the-season squad," Mosse said.
"We've taken a lot of heat from many
people this entire year, and it is up to
us to prove them wrong now."

will be victorious if no mental mistakes
are committed by the competitors.
"We just can't make any mistakes —
no disqualifications or letting down on
the second day," Lillydahl said. "But I
don't think anything is going to go
wrong. We're swimming really well and
coming into the meet with a lot of mo
mentum."
"I realized that this would be an end
of-the-season squad," Mosse said.
"We've taken a lot of heat from many
people this entire year, and it is up to
us to prove them wrong now."

Stanford Men s Swimming Coach Skip Kenney isn't discouraged that the Cardinal
Isn't a favorite to capture its fourth-straight NCAA swimming title. If the swimmers
can all maintain their current times, Kenney believes, then they will definitely be in
the hunt for the title.
Luckily the men s swim
ming team believes in it
self, for not many others
do. Entering the NCAA
Championships which
run today through Sat
urday in Indianapolis,

the three-time defending national cham
pion Cardinal is considered a longshot
for the 1988 title, even after defeating
No. 1 USC in the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships by 149 points.
But the Stanford squad is confident
of its chances of attaining a fourth
straight and fifth-overall national
crown.
"The team looks better now than we
have all season, even better than at
Pac-10's," senior tri-Captain Anthony
Mosse said. "We really think we can
win."
Unlike the previous three years, how
ever, when the Cardinal had the aid of
11-time national champions Pablo
Morales and JefT Kostoff, the meet will
not be a breeze. Last year, the squad
had the meet wrapped up by the second
day of the three-day competition and
won by over 100 points. This weekend
the squad has to battle favorites USC
and Texas as well as the up-and-coming
Florida and California squads.
"Experts have USC and Texas
favored, with Stanford and Cal battling
for third place," Stanford Coach Skip
Kenney said. "But even if we're not
favored we are going to be in the hunt."
"This year there is just more pressure
to swim fast individually," American
100-yard backstroke record holder Jay
Mortenson said, "because everyone's
points are going to be very important
to the team score. Last year we had so
much power we knew we were going to
win."
In addition to its championship ex
perience, the Cardinal brings with it
one of the largest squads in the nation
— 16 swimmers and one diver. In con
trast, the Trojans are carrying only 10
swimmers and no divers, so Stanford
has a definite advantage in point-scoring

potential if all of its competitors come
through.
In fact, the Trojans' and Longhorns'
top swimmers compete in many of the
same events, so Kenney is hoping they
will detract points from each other in
the team tallies. Stanford is also count
ing on Florida and Cal to take away
points from USC and Texas in events
that will not injure Stanford.
"The newer teams on the block are
all competing for the same points in
the freestyle events, while we are real
strong in the strokes, especially fly and
breast," said Mortenson.
The Cardinal will be led by a fairly
large core of NCAA scorers, including
a former individual national champion.
Backstroker Sean Murphy was 200-back
champion in both 1985 and 1986, and
is considered a favorite to retain his
title in Indianapolis.
Along with Murphy, a number of
Stanford competitors and relay teams
have legitimate shots at capturing titles
or at least placing in the top three.
Mosse, who has been in the shadow of
Morales for the past three seasons, is
one of the favorites in the 200 fly, and
Mortenson is favored in the 100 fly as
well as the 100 back.
John Witchel has a shot at the 200
free, freshman Matt Rodgers could very
possibly win a gold in the 200 breast,
and sophomore Lunn Lestina has an
outside chance in the 500 free.
The medley relay team is one of the
favorites, and the 400- and 800-free
relay squads are in the running for
top-three honors.
In addition, individual medlier Matt
Nance, freestyler John Hodge,
breaststroker Sam Schwartz and sprint
freestyler Doug Lillydahl bring both in
dividual and relay finalist experience to
the meet.
According to Kenney, the relay teams,
especially the three-time defending na
tional champion medley team, will be
a key to the Cardinal's success. He also
feels the performance of diver Matt
Frawley, Western Regional one- and
three-meter champion, will be of much
importance to the team considering the

fact that neither USC nor Cal qualified
divers. But above all, Kenney is espe
cially counting on the performance of
the "middle eight."
"The big guns (Mosse, Murphy, Mor
tenson and Witchel) need to come in
first, second or third," Kenney said.
"But the meet will be decided on how
the middle eight of our swimming corps
perform — whether they place in the
low finals or are in the consolation
heat."
Since USC's best events are on the
first day, Stanford is looking only to
gain momentum today and be within
15 points of the leader. "We know USC
is going to be very strong on the first
day, especially in the 500 free, but if
we are within a certain number of points
we can definitely catch up on the second
and third days," Mosse said. "If we start
a good roll we know that no team can
take us."
The squad consensus is that the Car
dinal has a fairly good shot at taking
the crown if everyone just swims his
best or times similar to those at Pac
10's. In other words, Stanford has a
legitimate shot to win without excep
tional performances. According to Ken
ney, over 40 percent of last year's cham
pionship heat times were equal to or
slower than times clocked in conference
championship meets, so the majority of
the Cardinal squad just needs to main
tain their current times and the team
will be in the running.
"Everyone is confident that we can
win if everyone swims well. Super
human performances are not neces
sary," Schwartz said.
The swimmers also feel the Cardinal
will be victorious if no mental mistakes
are committed by the competitors.
"We just can't make any mistakes —
no disqualifications or letting down on
the second day," Lillydahl said. "But I
don't think anything is going to go
wrong. We're swimming really well and
coming into the meet with a lot of mo
mentum."
"I realized that this would be an end
of-the-season squad," Mosse said.
"We've taken a lot of heat from many
people this entire year, and it is up to
us to prove them wrong now."
