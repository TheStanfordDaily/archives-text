# Bears aren't scared of Card netters
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
After beating Stanford at home and
away last season, the California wom
en's tennis team still hasn't displaced
the Cardinal as the top team in the
Bay Area.
Stanford recovered from the two
losses to the Golden Bears last season

to win the NCAA championship. And this season
the Cardinal is 17-1 and ranked second in the
nation, while Cal is 15-4 and ranked fifth.
Yet, when the two rivals square off today at 1:30
p.m. at the Stanford Tennis Stadium, the Bears
and their coach, Jan Brogan, will not be plagued
by any inferiority complexes.
"We're aware how good they (Stanford) are and
how strong they are, (but) my players feel they
(Cal) are as good as anyone," Brogan said.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan agreed that Cal,
after knocking off his team for the first time ever
last year, is no longer intimidated by the Cardinal.
"The mystique is gone after beating us in both
places," he said.

When the two rivals square
off today, the Bears will not
be plagued by any inferiority
complexes.

Despite the fact that the Bears have a worse
record this season than they did at this time last
year, both Brogan and Brennan feel that the Cal
lineup is stronger now. "They are very, very solid
all the way down the lineup," Brennan said. "Cal
has taken a jump."
"My team is more prepared this year for the new
team that Stanford has than they were last year,"
Brogan said.
The Bears lost Linda Oechsle, the No. 3 singles
player, from last year's squad, but they have three
additions this season. Freshman Kay Louthian has
played at the top of the Cal lineup when she has
been healthy. A lower back injury forced Louthian
to miss nine dual matches, but she is back and
played No. 3 singles last weekend in Arizona.
Jean Marie Lozano and Jennifer Prah, who both
sat out last season, have returned to give the Bears
more depth.
Cal also returns a solid nucleus from last year's
team, including regular No. 1 singles player Karen
Shin, defending Pacific 10 Conference singles
runner-up Alissa Finerman, Sharon Fletcher and
Tiffany Silveria.
Like the Bears, the Cardinal also has three new
faces this year, all of whom have impressed Brogan.
"I don't think there's any doubt that Stanford got
three of the top recruits this year," she said.
The recruits to whom Brogan was referring —
Tami and Teri Whitlinger, and Sandra Birch —
have blossomed into stellar freshmen. Shin was
undoubtedly glad to see the graduation of Patty
Fendick, who smashed her each time the two met
last year, but now the Cal junior must face Tami


Senior Carl Hagey, who already shares the top spot on
Sandra Birch, moves back Into the No. 6 singles slot today against the California
Golden Bears.
