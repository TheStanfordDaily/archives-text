# Will's a thrill but 'E' is the Topps

I leafed through the kid's base
ball cards at Sunken Diamond un
til I saw the mug of Eric Davis.
I believe it was at that point that
I lost all control, although on
these baseball-sun-hops-and
barley-filled afternoons any par
ticular point in time is elusive.

I offered the kid a dollar for
the 1988 Topps Eric Davis card.
He did not speak.
I said, "Do you speak?"
He said, "Yes."
"I'll give you a buck â€” a dollar
for this Eric Davis card."
I should mention that I'm a
Cincinnati Reds fan, and Davis is
the Big Red. Back in my prime,
Joe Morgan was the Red, except
on the wiffle-ball field where I
batted better righty, so Johnny
Bench got more adulation.
If I could find a wiffle-ball field
anywhere in the greater Palo Alto
area, I'm sure Eric Davis would
eclipse Morgan and Bench. So,
you see, I needed that baseball
card.
But the kid stayed rather stoic,
so I tried a new strategy. I asked

him who his favorite player was.
The kid was obviously not a
talker. He just grabbed the binder
and started leafing through it.
Now I'm eight or nine years
removed from collecting baseball
cards, but I do remember that we
used to use rubber bands and
shoeboxes to contain our cards.
Of course the cards would squirt
out of their bundles or fall out of
the flimsy boxes, so we would
have to organize them again.
Actually, besides trading, reor
ganizing the cards was probably
the most fun. First, put 'em in
piles by team, then on a rainy
day (it does rain in the summer
in some parts of this country),
maybe split 'em up by position or
Fish out all the home-run hitters.
Never, ever mix years. A pile
of cards with two difTerent-year
cards in it was utter chaos. But
this kid at Sunken Diamond had
his cards in those plastic sheet
