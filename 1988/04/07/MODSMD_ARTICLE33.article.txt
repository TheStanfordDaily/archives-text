# Will's a thrill but 'E' is the Topps
## 
### 
I leafed through the kid's base
ball cards at Sunken Diamond un
til I saw the mug of Eric Davis.
I believe it was at that point that
I lost all control, although on
these baseball-sun-hops-and
barley-filled afternoons any par
ticular point in time is elusive.

I offered the kid a dollar for
the 1988 Topps Eric Davis card.
He did not speak.
I said, "Do you speak?"
He said, "Yes."
"I'll give you a buck — a dollar
for this Eric Davis card."
I should mention that I'm a
Cincinnati Reds fan, and Davis is
the Big Red. Back in my prime,
Joe Morgan was the Red, except
on the wiffle-ball field where I
batted better righty, so Johnny
Bench got more adulation.
If I could find a wiffle-ball field
anywhere in the greater Palo Alto
area, I'm sure Eric Davis would
eclipse Morgan and Bench. So,
you see, I needed that baseball
card.
But the kid stayed rather stoic,
so I tried a new strategy. I asked

sun-hops-and-
barley-filled after
noons any particu
lar point in time is
elusive.

him who his favorite player was.
The kid was obviously not a
talker. He just grabbed the binder
and started leafing through it.
Now I'm eight or nine years
removed from collecting baseball
cards, but I do remember that we
used to use rubber bands and
shoeboxes to contain our cards.
Of course the cards would squirt
out of their bundles or fall out of
the flimsy boxes, so we would
have to organize them again.
Actually, besides trading, reor
ganizing the cards was probably
the most fun. First, put 'em in
piles by team, then on a rainy
day (it does rain in the summer
in some parts of this country),
maybe split 'em up by position or
Fish out all the home-run hitters.
Never, ever mix years. A pile
of cards with two difTerent-year
cards in it was utter chaos. But
this kid at Sunken Diamond had
his cards in those plastic sheet


CHRIS fialko
holders, and he mixed years. He
had all of Dwight Gooden's cards
for the past four years on one
page, and so forth.
Well, this mixture of strict plas
tic order and the chaos of mixed
years had me off-balance, and
when the kid stopped and pointed
at a card of Will Clark, I fell down.

"This is your favorite guy?" I
dsked
The kid said, "Will the Thrill,"
and since he used three entire
words I knew Clark was his Big
Giant. I detest the Giants.
But I wanted the Eric Davis
card, so I let his misjudgment go
uncorrected. I leafed back to the
Davis card and told the kid that
Eric Davis was my favorite player,
hoping I would have his sympa
thy. And I offered him two dollars.
The kid, however, was not in

terested in money. But he did
muster a complete sentence (no
mean feat for a Giant fan).
"Don't you have any cards you
could trade me?" he said.
As I sat back down on the grass
at Sunken Diamond I felt very
sheepish. 1 had no baseball cards.
Now, I have about two hundred
1988 baseball cards. I keep them
in rubber-banded piles, but I'm
looking for a shoebox. I have two
Will Clark cards, but no Eric
Davis. I need to find that kid.
