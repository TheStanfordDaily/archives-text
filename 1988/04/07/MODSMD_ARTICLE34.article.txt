The strength of Stanford's competition in the
Western Collegiate Cycling Conference was
proven yet again last weekend. Stanford won two
road races on Saturday and captured a first and
a second place in two multiple-lap races, known
as criteriums, on Sunday. This was good enough
to snare the team second overall on each day.
After last weekend Stanford moved up in the
WCCC rankings from sixth to third place, jump
ing ahead of California and two San Diego teams,
UC-San Diego and San Diego State.
UC-Santa Barbara, which hosted the competi
tion both days, held its road race Saturday on
relatively fiat terrain, a boon for the Stanford
team. Despite suffering some unusual bad luck
when two of its top riders were eliminated, the
Cardinal's A team scored well. Stanford graduate
student Mike Fadich won the A race with a
spectacular solo breakaway and grad student
Brock LaPorte sprinted to ninth place.
The B race was just as rewarding for the
Cardinal. B-cyclist Dave Louden, a fifth-year
senior dominated the final sprint and won a clear
victory while sophomore Lou O'Neill hammered
to a third-place finish and junior Hank Dart

edged into seventh place.
While none of the women or C racers took
first in their races, senior Alex Weiher, graduate
Pam Stevenson and Stanford researcher Ami
Laws jostled their way into seventh, ninth and
13th places.
Sunday's flat criterium was seemingly con
structed to Stevenson's specifications. Stevenson
controlled the entire race and emerged victorious
in the final sprint.
In the B race, Louden's sprint virtually assured
him of a high placing, but in a close finish he
was edged out and took second. Though no other
Stanford riders placed, the Cardinal's Dart won
several needed primes.
Stanford's A riders dominated the first half of
their criterium, with LaPorte and freshman Coul
ter Richardson exchanging prime wins.
Men's Rugby
In his first appearance at wing for the Stanford
men's rugby team on April 2, freshman Russell
Driver scored two tries, as did sophomore J.C.
Schmeil, as the Cardinal went on to crush Chico
State 45-10.
