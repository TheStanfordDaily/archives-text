# Student organizers launch Homeless Awareness Week
## 
### Erik Johnson 
The closest most Stanford
students come to homelessness
is a bad draw number; yet for
thousands of less fortunate
Americans, lack of shelter
remains a painful reality.
Hoping to bring this growing
problem to the attention of the
Stanford community, a group of
student organizers on Monday
launched Homeless Awareness
Week, a series of events focusing
on the plight of the nation's
homeless.
Organizers kicked the pro
gram off by building a cardboard
shanty in White Plaza.
The week's events will also
feature a concert by Windham
Hill musicians tomorrow night
at Toyon to benefit the Urban
Ministry, a Palo Alto organiza
tion which aids both poor and
homeless people.
Workshops and a panel dis
cussion on the homeless are
scheduled for Saturday at Ster
ling Quad, and SUNet programs
on homelessness have been
scheduled throughout the week.
All events are being sponsored
by the Stanford Volunteer Net
work and Residential Education
at Stanford.
According to junior Veronica

Shim, chief organizer of the pro
gram, which may become an an
nual event, the growing number
of homeless people in America
requires that students take ac
tion to combat the crisis. "There
are larger numbers of homeless
(than ever before) everywhere,
including the Bay Area," she
said.
In Palo Alto, for example,
there are probably close to 300
homeless people, according to
Jim Burklo, head of the Urban
Ministry.
Even in the relatively affluent
South Bay, the number of
people without access to perma
nent shelter is rising at an
alarming rate, Shim said. From
1985 to 1987 the estimated
number of homeless people in
Santa Clara County rose from
13,495 to 18,956, according to
estimates prepared by the
county's Human Relations De
partment.
The student organizers of
Stanford's Homeless Awareness
Week also point to evidence that
homelessness is widespread
across the state. In Los Angeles
County, for example, an esti
mated 25,000 people are with
out shelter, according to the Los
Angeles-based Interface Hunger
Coalition.

And in San Francisco, an es
timated 6,000 to 8,000 people
live on the city's streets and in
its parks, said senior Lisa
Beattie, director of the Stanford
Homeless Research Project,
which provided consultation
and advice to organizers of the
Awareness Week.
In addition, 15 Stanford stu
dents who worked among the
homeless in San Francisco dur
ing spring break helped organize
a panel discussion on Saturday.
Beattie explained that accu
rate estimates of the number of
homeless Americans are diffi
cult to obtain. Noting that leg
islators are generally more
likely to vote for poverty pro
grams if their cost is low.
Beattie said many official es
timates of homelessness have
been purposely kept low to make
homeless aid packages more
palatable to lawmakers.
In addition, Beattie said, the
Reagan administration has
"dumped the problem of home
less onto the counties, making
it a local problem." As a result,
she explained, the federal gov
ernment does not produce reli
able statistics on homelessness
and "really has no idea what
the real numbers are."
