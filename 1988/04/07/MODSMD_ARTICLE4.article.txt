# ASSU T-shirts shrink Bookstore revenues
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
For more than a decade, the
ASSU T-shirt shop has provided
students with less-expensive, non
traditional alternatives to the T
shirts and sweatshirts sold by the
Stanford Bookstore.
However, according to Eldon
Speed, manager of the Bookstore,
an increase in the T-shirt shop's
sales combined with an expansion
in services may lead to a reduction
in the money the Bookstore
returns to students through its
annual textbook rebate.
The Bookstore, a non-profit or
ganization, has traditionally
returned a share of its earnings
to customers who save their text
book receipts and hand them in
to the Bookstore at the end of
the academic year. Last year, the
Bookstore returned $400,000 to
text book customers, the largest
rebate in their history.
Although Speed said the Book
store is currently "staying com
petitive" with the ASSU, he
predicted that if the Bookstore
loses its competitive edge, it ..
will have to take steps to become
competitive," thereby increasing
costs.
According to Speed, 95 percent
of the Bookstore's profits come
from clothing and souvenirs sales.
A decrease in those profits, which
are in turn used to finance the
rebate, could affect the amount
of money returned to customers,
Speed said.

Despite the ASSU shop's
growth, Speed said he is not
worried about competition from
the ASSU or any smaller opera
tions. Many stores in the area sell
Stanford clothing, but Speed says
he hasn't noticed a change in sales
due to any of these competitors.
However, sales at the ASSU
shop have definitely increased
since its expansion last year, ac
cording to senior Tim Brown, the
current shop manager. He cited
a nearly 80 percent increase in
profits from $4,300 to $7,800 last
spring quarter compared to spring
quarter 1986.
All of the ASSU shop profits
go into the operating budget of
the ASSU and are used to finance
programs and events put on by
the Council of Presidents, Senate
and Financial Office, said senior
Vivienne Huang, ASSU financial
manager. Huang said the shop is
probably the ASSU's third or
fourth most successful project.
Besides offering products
embossed with logos and mes
sages more irreverent than the
alternatives at the Bookstore, the
ASSU's biggest selling point is low
prices. A hooded one-color sweat
shirt runs for $17.60 at the ASSU
as compared to $28.95 at the
Bookstore.
"We don't mark things up as
much, which will mean less of a
profit," Brown said, adding that
the T-shirt shop's main goal is to
provide students with quality, in
expensive clothes rather than
making a large profit.
Yet, Speed argues that, "Stu
dents can benefit by lower prices
or they can benefit by the rebate
at the end of the year, but they
couldn't benefit from both."
According to Brown, when the
ASSU store began operating in
1976, it was nothing more than
a walk-up cage inside the ASSU
loft. Now it is a completely self

sufficient store, staffed by ASSU
members.
Last spring, as part of the over
all expansion of ASSU offices, the
store moved to its present location
on the upper deck of Tresidder
Union. The new store is about
three times the size of the old
location, Brown said. "This is the
first time you could really call it
a store," he said, "It's the first
year we ever had shopping bags
with our own logo."
"Spring quarter is generally our
best quarter, and I can see us
doing even better .. . this year."
Students still make up about

70 percent of customers at the
ASSU store, said Brown, but in
past years, sales to tourists and
people from outside the Univer
sity have increased. Brown attrib
uted this increase partly to the
new location. "We're right there
by the parking lot. A lot of people
do see us when they are parking
their cars and leaving," he said.
This expansion of sales to
tourists might mean less business
for the Stanford Bookstore. Book
store clothing buyer Laura
Dowling estimated that tourists
could make up as much as 50
percent of clothing buyers.
