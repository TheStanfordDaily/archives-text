### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
Ambiguity over when candidates may
legally start campaigning for this year's
ASSU spring elections sparked disagree
ment in the early morning hours Wed
nesday after a number of campaigns
began posting materials around campus
at 12 a.m.
The controversy centered around an
ASSU rule stating that campaigning
shall begin "one week before the opening
of polls." Polls are scheduled to open
Wednesday, April 13. Although most of
the candidates running this spring un
derstood the rule to mean 12 a.m. today,
a number of others chose to begin cam
paigning 24 hours earlier.
Elections Commissioner Steve Baer
and Hearings Commissioner Andrew
Dinsmore decided last week that the
campaign would officially begin at 12
a.m. today. But after they discovered
that campaign materials were posted
early Wednesday morning, however,

elections officials met at noon Wednes
day and retroactively approved the early
campaigning.
The ambiguity first arose at a cam
paign rules meeting last Thursday. Re
ferring to that meeting, Dinsmore said
that he "made the mistake of determin
ing (12 a.m.) April 7" — today — as
the effective campaign starting date.
"I had told everyone else the same
misinformation," Dinsmore said. Since
"no questions were asked at that point,"
Dinsmore said he felt all candidates un
derstood when campaigning could begin
and (that) everyone would start on
"common ground."
One Council of Presidents slate, the
Energizers, and a few senate candidates
began posting campaign materials at 12
a.m. Wednesday. Opposing candidates
complained to Dinsmore less than an
hour later, and at about 1 a.m. Dinsmore
ordered that the campaign materials be
removed.
Leonard Adler, a member of the
Energizers and a current COP
member, criticized Dinsmore's
handling of the matter. "He
should have consulted other
groups before making the (1 a.m.)
decision," Adler said. "We're on
top of the rules, but we're being
penalized," Adler said, arguing
that "ignorance (of the rules) is
no excuse."
Dinsmore, however, explained

that the dispute arose too late to
consult all the other groups. "It
wasn't very easy to talk to all of
them at 1 a.m." he said.
David Brown, member of A New
Slate of Mind, the COP slate op
posing the Energizers in the cam
paign, expressed concern that of
ficials were "reneging on their
original decision."
Brown also said his slate
suspected that the Energizers
may have pressured the commis
sion to change its decision. "By
putting blame on them, [the Ener
gizersl were able to change the
election commissioner's decision,"

he said.
Adler denied the Energizers had
tried to influence the commis
sion's decision and emphasized
that he did not talk to election
officials.
"They on their own decided to
change their decision," Adler said.
Brown also said he was worried
that the Energizers may have
gained an early advantage by put
ting out their materials earlier
than A New Slate of Mind. "Ob
viously they had a jump on us,"
Brown said, "But I don't think
it's going to determine the out
come of the race."
