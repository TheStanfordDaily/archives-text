## Rock singer decries censorship 
### Leann Wiley 
Recent conservative efforts to
restrict the sale of sexually ex
plicit rock music to minors
threaten to set off a "domino ef
fect" of censorship in American
society, Dead Kennedys' lead
singer Jello Biafra told an audi
ence at the Law School yesterday.
Although he is a musician and
not a legal scholar, Biafra has
spent the past two years cam
paigning full time for the First
Amendment rights of rock
musicians. Two years ago, a Dead
Kennedys album insert titled
"Penis Landscape" landed Biafra
in court, charged with "distribu
tion of harmful materials to
minors."
Charging that the Dead Ken
nedy's were brought to trial as
"fall guys," Biafra warned that
his case signals an impending
wave of censorship of other forms
of expression. Although the Dead
Kennedys case ended in a hung
jury, conservative advocacy
groups, such as the Washington
based Parents Music Resource
Center, have in recent years
succeeded in forcing record com
panies to label sexually explicit
albums and restrict their sale to
minors.
Biafra referred to the organiza
tion's founders Tipper Gore and
Susan Baker as "well-connected
Senate wives who grew up in shel
tered environments and (who are)
used to getting their way."
Calling the women "cultural
vigilantes," Biafra warned that

their efforts represent a "Trojan
horse for the religious right."
Biafra said that the group,
along with right-wing leaders
such as Attorney General Edwin
Meese and television evangelists
Jerry Falwell and Jimmy Swag
gart, is part of a large-scale effort
to impose conservative morality
on American society.
"Once they take care of music,
what's going to stop them?"
Biafra asked. "Censorship is like
a certain brand of potato chips,
because nobody can stop after
one," he said.

Biafra speculated that right
wing efforts to censor the rock
industry might even lead to a con
stitutional amendment restricting
freedom of expression. Although
such an amendment would re
quire approval of two-thirds of the
state legislatures, Biafra said that
conservatives might be able to get
enough "concerned parents" to
"think melodramatically about
their little kids" to pull it ofT.
Biafra ridiculed Gore and Baker
as "bouffant-encrusted thought

a lot funnier if [they] had less
money and power."
Instead of seeking to prohibit
the sale of sexually explicit rock
to minors, Biafra said Gore, Baker
and other parents should rely on

"rational communication" with
their children. "It's a far better
way" to deal with the issue, he
said.
He said the group has been un
fairly narrow in its attacks. "It's
a witch hunt" against rock music.
"Why don't they go after country
music?"
The organization's successful
campaign to have warning labels
placed on certain records has

prompted many music stores to
remove these records altogether,
Biafra said. "This is how much
power these people (the group)
are getting."
Biafra lamented the fact that
his ongoing legal battle "took over
a year and a half out of my life.
I haven't written a song in over
two years."
"It takes a lot of time and a
lot of work," he said.
