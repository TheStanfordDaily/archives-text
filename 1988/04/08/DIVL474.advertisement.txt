A recent study, presented to the American Psychological Association, revealed
some interesting facts about former Peace Corps Volunteers. For example:
• Over a five-year period, college faculty with Peace Corps experience averaged
almost double the salary gains of Fulbright scholars.
• 250 Congressional aides and 10 percent of all Foreign Service officers are Returned
Peace Corps Volunteers.
• From 1980 to 1985, former Peace Corps Volunteers outperformed national average
salary gains for health service workers by 40.1%, educators by 13.5%, and public sector
employees by 10.6%.
PEACE CORPS SERVICE IS A WAY TO HELP YOURSELF BY HELPING OTHERS.
Working at a professional level that ordinarily might take years of apprenticeship back
home, volunteers find the career growth they're looking for and enjoy a unique experi
ence in the developing world. International firms and government agencies value the
skills and knowledge mastered during Peace Corps service.
