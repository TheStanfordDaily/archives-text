# Fetter chooses Class of 1992
## More minorities admitted; number of applicants declines 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Ethnic minority admissions for next
year's freshman class increased again
this year — the third year in a row
—- according to figures released yes
terday by the Undergraduate Office
of Admissions, which Tuesday mailed
acceptance letters to 2,521 of 15,826
applicants.
Although the total number of ap
plicants declined by 6 percent from
last year, "every quantitative measure
of quality of the applicants showed
an increase over 1987," according to
the Admissions Office. The office ex
pects 1,525 freshman to enroll for
next year.
Black students constitute 10.7 per

cent of this year's admitted class, up
from 9.4 percent last year and 7.7
percent in 1986. Chicano-Latino stu
dents make up 8.3 percent, an in
crease from 7.9 percent and 7.3 per
cent during the past two years. Asian-
Americans comprise 17.4 percent of
admitted applicants, a three-tenths of
a percent rise from 1987.
However, Native American students
accepted remained constant at 0.8 per
cent.
The percentage of women admitted
also remained steady at 44 percent,
just below last year's 45 percent.
The Admissions Office also recog
nized close to 200 David Starr Jordan
scholars, who are recognized for "ex
traordinary academic accomplish

ment," but receive no other compen
sation.
One of the two questions in this
year's essay section presented some
difficulty in judging applications, ad
missions officials said. The essay,
which asked applicants to write a fable
drawing upon a personal experience,
was "difficult to read," Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter
said.
She said many applicants who chose
this question failed to develop a moral
and sometimes did not successfully
blend a personal experience into the
fable.
Fetter said she doubts the question
will ever appear again.

Admissions officers yesterday review the list of applicants they approved. Over 2,500 acceptance letters were
mailed Tuesday.
Admitted students, which rep
resent every state and 35 foreign
countries, must respond to the
Stanford offer by May 1.
Last year, 2,474 students were
offered admission out of an ap
plicant pool of 16,883. The in
crease in offers this year may be
a reaction to last year's unex
pected low yield, the percentage
of students who actually accept
offers.
The mEyority of admitted stu
dents — 31.9 percent — are from
California, followed by New York
at 8.2 percent, Texas at 6.0 per
cent, New Jersey at 3.9 percent,
and Illinois at 3.7 percent.
Over 3,000 applicants had a 4.0
grade point average, and 42 per
cent had a GPA of 3.8 or above.
Eleven percent of students sub
mitting Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores received a 700 or above on
the verbal section, and 40 percent
received above 700 in math. Of
national college-bound seniors, 1
percent scored above 700 on ver

bal and 3 percent scored above
700 on math.
The end of the Admission Of
fice's 12-week reading period
ended at 6:15 p.m. on April 2,
when the last decision was made,
according to Fetter.
The admissions office is cur
rently receiving phone calls and
visits from 1988 applicants and
is preparing a phone-a-thon in
which current freshmen call all
admitted students and answer
questions.
The office is also planning a
"prospective freshman" week, and
Fetter expects over 500 prospec
tive freshmen to visit campus and
stay with hosts.
"I am pleased with the class
and pleased with the process,"
Fetter said.
The Admissions Office this year
made a few procedural changes
in the application process in hopes
of making it run more smoothly.
In previous years, applicants re
quested a pre-application bro
chure and then sent for an appli
cation. This year, a one-step proc
ess was used, and a full applica
tion was sent upon initial request.
This process has worked better,

according to Fetter, and she is
"pretty sure" it will be continued,
though possibly in a modified
form after the office formally as
sesses it.
The creation of a new position
of Assistant Dean of Admissions,
which deals with staff affairs, ad
missions budget and publications,
also worked well this year, accord
ing to Fetter.

The end of the Admission Of
fice's 12-week reading period
ended at 6:15 p.m. on April 2,
when the last decision was made,
according to Fetter.
The admissions office is cur
rently receiving phone calls and
visits from 1988 applicants and
is preparing a phone-a-thon in
which current freshmen call all
admitted students and answer
questions.
The office is also planning a
"prospective freshman" week, and
Fetter expects over 500 prospec
tive freshmen to visit campus and
stay with hosts.
"I am pleased with the class
and pleased with the process,"
Fetter said.
The Admissions Office this year
made a few procedural changes
in the application process in hopes
of making it run more smoothly.
In previous years, applicants re
quested a pre-application bro
chure and then sent for an appli
cation. This year, a one-step proc
ess was used, and a full applica
tion was sent upon initial request.
This process has worked better,

according to Fetter, and she is
"pretty sure" it will be continued,
though possibly in a modified
form after the office formally as
sesses it.
The creation of a new position
of Assistant Dean of Admissions,
which deals with staff affairs, ad
missions budget and publications,
also worked well this year, accord
ing to Fetter.
