# Fetter chooses Class of 1992
## More minorities admitted; number of applicants declines 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Ethnic minority admissions for next
year's freshman class increased again
this year — the third year in a row
—- according to figures released yes
terday by the Undergraduate Office
of Admissions, which Tuesday mailed
acceptance letters to 2,521 of 15,826
applicants.
Although the total number of ap
plicants declined by 6 percent from
last year, "every quantitative measure
of quality of the applicants showed
an increase over 1987," according to
the Admissions Office. The office ex
pects 1,525 freshman to enroll for
next year.
Black students constitute 10.7 per

cent of this year's admitted class, up
from 9.4 percent last year and 7.7
percent in 1986. Chicano-Latino stu
dents make up 8.3 percent, an in
crease from 7.9 percent and 7.3 per
cent during the past two years. Asian-
Americans comprise 17.4 percent of
admitted applicants, a three-tenths of
a percent rise from 1987.
However, Native American students
accepted remained constant at 0.8 per
cent.
The percentage of women admitted
also remained steady at 44 percent,
just below last year's 45 percent.
The Admissions Office also recog
nized close to 200 David Starr Jordan
scholars, who are recognized for "ex
traordinary academic accomplish

ment," but receive no other compen
sation.
One of the two questions in this
year's essay section presented some
difficulty in judging applications, ad
missions officials said. The essay,
which asked applicants to write a fable
drawing upon a personal experience,
was "difficult to read," Dean of Un
dergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter
said.
She said many applicants who chose
this question failed to develop a moral
and sometimes did not successfully
blend a personal experience into the
fable.
Fetter said she doubts the question
will ever appear again.
