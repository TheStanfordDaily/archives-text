Home AIDS test kits blocked
WASHINGTON — Federal health officials
have blocked an ambitious attempt to mass
market AIDS tests for use in the home, citing
concerns about accuracy and lack of medical
supervision.
The move pre-empts the plans of several
companies to sell AIDS testing kits in drug
stores and supermarkets, a prospect that
frightened many public health officials who
insist that testing without appropriate guid
ance does more harm than good.
"Home kits are genuinely a health risk,"
said June Osborn, dean of the University of
Michigan School of Public Health. "Some
people cannot withstand the power of that
dreadful message (that they are infected with
the AIDS virus). They need to have help to
understand the news and cope with it."
In a letter sent last week to companies
seeking to enter the home-test market, the
Food and Drug Administration set out a strict
set of medical guidelines, restricting the kits
to "professional use only within a comprehen
sive health care environment."
Shuttle gets 10-foot safety pole
WASHINGTON — The United States' space
shuttle Discovery will be equipped with a 10-
foot-long aluminum pole to enable crew mem
bers to bail out during a landing emergency,
the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration announced yesterday.
The decision to install the escape device
came after 66 tests by Navy parachutists who
used it to exit a C-141 transport plane outfitted
with a hatch similar to the shuttle exit. NASA
said the telescoping pole, to be located in the
orbiter's mid-deck, would be installed in time
for Discovery's four-day flight, now scheduled
for launch Aug. 4.
Concern over the absence of an emergency
escape system in the space vehicle was
heightened by the January 1986 Challenger
tragedy, which claimed the lives of seven
astronauts.
A presidential commission investigating the
accident urged the space agency to address
the emergency bail-out problem, and NASA
spent months evaluating designs of an emer
gency escape system.
Newsweek On Campus to close
Beset by higher costs on an already un
profitable venture, Newsweek magazine an
nounced yesterday that Newsweek On
Campus, a spinoff aimed at college students,
would cease publication after the September
1988 issue.
On Campus, with a circulation of 1.3 million,
is distributed free on college campuses. It was
launched as a way to bring in new, younger
readers to the parent magazine but has been
unprofitable in five out of its six years, ac
cording to a Newsweek spokesperson.
The 12 business-side staffers at On Campus
got pink slips yesterday, but some will be
offered other positions at Newsweek, according
to a press representative. The eight editorial
staff members have been offered new jobs.
"It was absolutely a surprise to editorial
people. They were stunned," one Newsweek
insider said.
The magazine won numerous awards for its
editorial quality, including most recently a cita
tion from the Education Writers Association,
but it failed in its fundamental mission of
creating lifelong Newsweek readers.
