# Israeli may have been shot by guard

### 
KARNEI SHOMRON, West Bank -
A preliminary army investigation into
what was originally reported as the
stoning death of a West Bank Jewish
teenager shows the girl had also been
shot in the head, apparently by an
Israeli security guard accompanying
her, Israeli television reported last
night.
The army refused comment pending
completion of its probe, but a senior
government source who spoke on con
dition of anonymity confirmed the tele
vision account.
It was unclear whether the cause of
the girl's death was the bullet wound
or stones hurled at her, reportedly by
the mother of one of two Palestinian
villagers shot to death by a security
guard during the same incident. The
girl, Tirza Porat, was one of 16 Jewish
teenagers who had been hiking near
the West Bank village of Beita on Wed
nesday, accompanied by two armed Is

raeli guards, when the trouble began.
The circumstances of how the girl
was shot also were unclear, although
both Israel Television and Israel Radio
reported that army investigators had
found no evidence that any weapons
were used except those carried by the
guards. Although Palestinian villagers
at some point took the weapons away
from the pair, they had by then run
out of ammunition, Israel Television
reported, quoting an unnamed "senior
army official."
The surprise revelations came only
hours after the army said Israeli
troops, searching near Beita yesterday
afternoon, shot to death a Palestinian
suspect when he tried to flee a patrol.
Fifteen other villagers were arrested
in connection with the previous day's
violence, and the homes of five people
accused of instigating or participating
in the incident were demolished by
high explosives, the army added.

'The blood of the whole
nation is boiling.'

Yitzhak Shamir

Here in Kornei Shomron, about
3,000 angry mourners, most of them
Jewish settlers, turned yesterday's fu
neral of the dead schoolgirl into a po
litical demonstration for tougher gov
ernment measures against Arab
protesters.
Porat, who was 15, was the first
Israeli civilian killed as a direct result
of the violence that has rocked the
occupied territories of the West Bank
and Gaza for the last four months.
"The blood of the whole nation is
boiling," Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir told the funeral gathering.

However, the reports on state radio
and television raised serious new ques
tions that could bear importantly on
how the events that occurred in Beita
on Wednesday are viewed. The ac
counts were said to be based on a
report submitted by army inves
tigators yesterday to Lt. Gen. Dan
Shomron, the chief of staff.
It also was unclear why the military
refused yesterday to comment on the
cause of Porat's death. Deputy army
spokesman Col. Raanan Gissin con
firmed in a telephone interview that
there had been a pathological exam
ination of Porat's body before she was
buried. Such examinations are usually
meant to determine the cause of death.
Beita was sealed off by the army
immediately after Wednesday's vio
lence, making it impossible for jour
nalists to get first-hand reports by Pal
estinian witnesses.
