# Gorbachev announces Afghanistan accord
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev and Afghan President
Najibullah said yesterday that they
had cleared away the "last obstacles"
to a peace agreement on Afghanistan,
allowing the Soviets to start withdraw
ing their troops next month.
If an accord is signed soon in
Geneva, where peace talks on Afghan
istan are under way, Moscow will begin
May 15 to withdraw the estimated
115,000 troops it has in Afghanistan,
the two leaders said in a statement
issued in the Soviet Central Asian city
of Tashkent.
The Soviets have been pressing to
begin the withdrawal in advance of
the summit meeting between Gorba
chev and President Reagan in Moscow

beginning May 29.
Tass, the Soviet news agency, quoted
Gorbachev as saying: "There is certain
to be a signed agreement on political
normalization. I think both Pakistan
and Afghanistan will come to agree
ment, and that we and the Americans
will agree to be guarantors." Pakistan
is involved in the talks because about
3 million Afghans have fled the fight
ing and taken refuge in the neighbor
ing country.
In Geneva, official sources indicated
that formal announcement of a settle
ment could come as early as today.
"I think the situation will be clear
by tomorrow," said a United Nations
official who asked not to be identified.

"There's a certain amount of technical
work that has to be done, texts that
have to be checked. . . . Each minister
has to sign 50 times."
He said that the delegations were
still consulting and that "all the par
ties are being very careful."
In Washington, State Department
press representative Phyllis Oakley
said the United States "noted with
great interest the Tass statement. ...
We, too, hope that rapid progress can
be made in concluding the Geneva ac
cords."
The United States told the Soviets
last month that it would not guarantee
the peace agreement unless Moscow
would accept the principle of "sym

metry" in connection with military aid
to the rival factions in Afghanistan —
Najibullah's Soviet-backed govern
ment, on the one hand, and the U.S.-
backed rebels on the other.
Oakley said the United States had
not yet received a formal response
from the Soviet Union. Until the So
viet reply is received, she said, "We
must reserve judgment."
A press representative for the Soviet
Foreign Ministry, Gennady Gerasi
mov, said the dispute over military aid
was one of the obstacles that has been
overcome, but neither he nor the state
ment issued in Tashkent spelled out
how the stalemate had been resolved.
