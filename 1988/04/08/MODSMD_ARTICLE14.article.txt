# Simon ends campaign
## Will not relinquish his 170 delegates 
### 
WASHINGTON - Two days
short of a year after he said
he would announce his can
didacy for president, Illinois
Sen. Paul Simon suspended his
campaigning yesterday with
"no regrets" about his presi
dential bid and "no illusions
that the nomination will come
my way."
Simon, by not withdrawing
outright, holds on to his
delegates — about 170 — in
cluding 47 at-large Illinois
delegates coming his way next
month who would otherwise
have been awarded to rival
Jesse Jackson, who finished
second to Simon in the Illinois
primary.
Jackson denounced the
move, but Simon denied that
he was part of any stop-
Jackson effort.
"In a year that has already
seen many surprises, no one
knows what twists and turns
may develop" before the July
18 Democratic convention in
Atlanta, he told reporters in
the Senate Budget Committee
hearing room, which was

jammed with Simon support
ers, many of them wearing
Simonesque bow ties in tribute.
"I owe something to those
delegates, and I also frankly
want to have an impact on
what happens," said Simon,
who plans to meet with them
after June 7 to decide his next
step.
