# Panama banks refuse to open

### 
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Panama
nian banks rejected yesterday a govern
ment demand that they reopen by the end
of this week, dealing a blow to Gen. Manuel
Noriega's attempts to fend off American-led
economic sanctions aimed at driving him
from power.
Noriega desperately needs cash to meet
government payrolls, including those of the
15,000-member Panama Defense Forces.
Salary payments for civil servants and
other public workers are believed to be
about two weeks behind, and further delays
could exacerbate anti-Noriega sentiment.
The banks' closure also has prevented
many companies from obtaining cash to
pay workers' salaries, which has kept many
businesses from reopening even after the
demise of a two-week general strike. In
turn, many companies have been unable
to get funds to pay taxes to keep the gov
ernment afloat.
Officials in Noriega's government saw
the opening of banks as a means to refuel
at least modest economic activity, since
Panama City is still clearly a capital under
siege. Few of the stores that have reopened
in recent days are conducting any business
as consumers spend what money they have
only on necessities, especially food.
Parking lots in front of electronic goods
stores and boutiques on main shopping
thoroughfares remain virtually empty
throughout the day.
Panama's 12 domestic banks had agreed
last week to reopen for limited business if

Noriega's government met four conditions,
including the delivery of sufficient funds
to the banks to cover withdrawal demands.
Withdrawals were to be limited to 25 per
cent of checking account balances, up to a
maximum of $10,000, and 5 percent of
savings account balances.
Bankers fear a run on deposits if they
reopen without adequate restrictions and
funds to meet demand. Many bankers are
sympathetic to the opposition campaign to
remove Noriega, but at the same time they
worry that continued defiance of Noriega
could prompt him to nationalize the banks
or seize the assets in their vaults.
The bankers had set out the conditions
for reopening during talks in recent days
with the government-dominated Panama
Banking Commission. Those terms in
cluded a publicity campaign to inform Pan
amanians of the restrictions on
withdrawals to avoid violence at the banks.
No such campaign has materialized.
"Without these conditions being met, it
is not possible for us to reopen," one board
member of a Panamanian bank said.
A Western financial analyst said of the
bankers, "They are trying to stonewall as
much as they can, without looking like it."
The analyst, speaking on the condition
that he not be identified, said Noriega's
success or failure in getting access to cash
remained central to the outcome of the
multifaceted anti-Noriega movement.
