## Make more room 
### 
WHILE THE QUALITY and
the quantity of student
groups at Stanford is high,
the same cannot be said about the
facilities that house them.
Only 70 of the 300 student or
ganizations currently have space,
and the quality of that space is
poor. The shortage, and the neglect
on the part of the University of
what little space there is, reflects
the University's lack of commit
ment to student groups in general.
The situation is so bad that
many groups don't even bother to
seek space. While most of the or
ganizations that applied for space
this year will get it, some will have
to share offices with others. This
hinders student organizational ef
forts in several ways.
First, normal office tasks are
made more difficult. Students
sharing offices must struggle to
conduct meetings uninterrupted as
well as try to keep office materials
separate.
Further, the shortage has caused
antagonism between the groups as
they struggle to get a bigger share
of the limited space.
In addition, the sorry state of
the buildings continues to go un
noticed by the University. The Old
Firehouse has been deemed unsafe
in the past; safety upgrades this
year have proceeded very slowly,
and it still needs a major external
renovation. But this is just one
example; the University ignores

other student office buildings.
The student groups cannot solve
the problem of office space; the
University should take responsibil
ity. Right now, Stanford should
upgrade the buildings that house
the student groups in addition to
creating additional space.
Ideally, the University should
consolidate its student offices that
are currently scattered throughout
campus.
The distribution of office space
among the groups is problematic.
Some offices are in Old Union,
others in the Toy on Eating Clubs.
The dispersion of the groups all
around campus hinders effective
communication between them,
makes them less accessible to stu
dents and indicates a lack of
foresight on the part of University
planners.
The University should centralize
and extend student office space as
much as possible. One route might
be to use the buildings located be
tween Old Union and Storke for
student groups after the labs now
housed there move to the new Near
West campus development.
The University should explore
this and other options in showing
that it is truly willing to give stu
dent groups a high priority. While
its plans for expanding academic
facilities are commendable, Stan
ford must not lose sight of the
student quality of life on campus.
