## Meese divides GOP 
### 
Edwin meese collects pig
figurines. This, it seems, is the
embattled attorney general's trib
ute to policemen everywhere, recalling
their popular nickname from the '60s.
No joke.
He also collects special prosecutors. So
far he's got three. One looked into
Meese's "coincidental" appointment of
associates who happened to have helped
him financially; another is busy investi
gating Meese's apparent complicity in the
corrupt award of defense contracts to
Wedtech Corp.; the third — now take a
deep breath — is gathering evidence
about Meese's action, or lack of it, on a
memo from longtime friend e. Robert wal
lach (who spells his name with no capi
tals) detailing plans to bribe the Israelis
into helping build an Iraqi oil pipeline.
Got all that?
Meese has become so controversial, es
pecially since he garnered his record
breaking third special prosecutor, that
he has become the divisive issue in an
otherwise united GOP.
Three subspecies of Republicans now
roam Washington. All three love Ronald
Reagan, George Bush, baseball, Mom and
apple pie and they all think of 1953 as
the Good Old Days. How, then, does a
political biologist distinguish between the
three breeds? Simple. Find out their
views on Meese.
The first, Buchananus mechamus,
loves Ed Meese. This animal, distin
guished by his bright red neck and Bob
Jones University sheepskin, respects
Meese for calling a spade a spade — as
well as an Arab a "sand nigger," a female
athlete a lesbian and a certain martyred

civil rights leader "Martin Luther Coon."
This lowest order subspecies doesn't
bat an eye at Meese-isms like, "You don't
have many suspects who are innocent of
a crime. That's contradictory. If a person
is innocent of a crime, then he is not a
suspect." Just think of the money and
time that could be saved by doing away
with trials!
In sum, this first GOP breed equates
Meese with Santa Claus. He also believes
Richard Nixon was not a crook.
The second subspecies, Buckleyus
apologus, is too intelligent to defend
Meese as a great conservative mind. This
creature may wish, indeed, that someone
else were attorney general; still, he op
poses demands that Meese step down or
be fired now, because that would look
like a bow to liberal pressure.
And while Buckleyus is embarrassed
by Meese's borderline competency and
questionable ethics, he insists that The
Liberal Establishment has seized upon
his foul-ups — or, in some versions, has
created them — as transparent pretexts
for attacking the whole conservative
agenda.
This second sort of Republican, then,
asks that this politically motivated
hounding of the adequate Meese stop;
the attorney general should be innocent
until proven guilty.
Like John Mitchell.
A third subspecies, Axim immediatus,
has lost whatever patience he once had
for Meese. Despite Axim'a conservatism,
he sees Meese as a bumbling, reactionary
Reagan sycophant who happened to have
a law degree and a little experience as a
prosecutor.

Axim believes that Meese, regardless
of whether or not he committed any
crimes, did let personal matters unethi
cally warp his actions on the job.
Though many specimens of Axim are
liberal Republicans, like Bork opponent
Sen. Arlen Specter most hail from the
party's center and right wings.
For example, Arnold Burns, the num
ber two man in the entire Justice De
partment, and three other top Justice
officials just resigned — essentially be
cause Meese wouldn't; Kemp-backer
James Kilpatrick terms Meese "that con
summate bungler"; and arch
conservative Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-
N.C., tipped Meese off last week that his
GOP support in Congress had dried up.
Now that the polls are indicating an
extremeley tight race for the White House
in November, the typical Axim sees Meese
as excess ballast on the Bush balloon,
already sagging due to Iranamok.
Accordingly, this third breed of Repub
lican is demanding immediate action.
Before Meese can drag Bush and the
GOP down with him, he should resign
— or be fired by Reagan.
Nancy, that is.
