# Vital new discovery sheds light on AIDS
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
In what one scientist called "a step along
the way," researchers at the Stanford Med
ical School have discovered a critical junc
ture in the life cycle of the AIDS virus
that inhibitory drugs may be able to block.
The breakthrough may lead to an AIDS
vaccine, researchers said.
The discovery is tied to a protein exposed
on the outer shell of the AIDS virus that
cleaves — or splits in two — thereby ex
posing a new section of protein that sci
entists believe is involved in the activation
process.
Scientists developed a mutant strain of
the virus that could not complete this cri
tical cleavage step and is thus unable to
fuse with human cells in tissue culture,
explained Dr. Mike McCune, a postdoctoral
scholar at the Medical School who is leading
the study.
The research suggests that a drug that
could block the fusion might inhibit the
virus' infectiousness and provide therapeu
tic approaches to fighting AIDS. However,
the enzyme responsible for the cleavage
has not yet been identified. Work is cur
rently underway at Stanford to locate the
enzyme and ultimately inhibit it, according
to McCune.
But they cautioned that it is far too soon
to say whether such drugs could be
developed or if they would be safe and
effective for clinical use.

Prof. Irving Weissman, co-authored the
study with Dr. Gregory Reyes and Linda
Rabin of Genelabs, Inc., in Redwood City,
Dr. Mark Feinberg of the Whitehead In
stitue in Cambridge, Mass., and Drs. Jon
Kosek and Miriam Liberman of Stanford's
Medical School.
The AIDS virus is a piece of genetic
material in a protein envelope. The scien
tists discovered that the virus can infect
cells only if an enzyme clips the envelope
protein in two pieces.
If this cleavage doesn't occur, the virus
particles assemble and appear normal in
every way, but they are disarmed and un
able to infect new cells, McCune explained.
The virus is not dormant before it fuses

with its target cell, but it is not infective,
explained McCune. During the many years
the virus may float outside the cells without
penetrating them, it may be growing like
cancer, making more progeny virus, he
said.
The mutant strain that was developed
had its envelope protein altered at the "clip
site." Unable to have its envelope protein
cut in two, the mutant strain appeared
normal but was biologically inactive,
McCune said.
Two earlier breakthroughs made by
Stanford scientists working in the Depart
ment of Pathology under the direction of
Dr. Edgar Engleman provided the back
ground necessary for McCune's discovery.
Dr. Jeff Lifson showed that envelope
proteins were necessary for infection, and
Dr. Barry Stein proved that fusion of the
AIDS virus and the human cell takes place
at the surface of the cell in the plasma
membrane, and not in the cell interior.
Dr. Tom Merigan, Chief of Infectious
Diseases, runs clinical trials testing ther
apeutic drug treatments. Most of the drugs
are similar in type to AZT, currently the
only treatment endorsed by the Food and
Drug Administration.
AZT works by inhibiting reverse
transcriptase, an enzyme secreted at an
other critical juncture in the life cycle of
the virus. The virus, which exists as RNA
genetic material, transforms itself into
DNA using reverse transcriptase. Once in
the form of DNA, the virus incorporates
itself into its host's DNA and begins
producing toxic proteins.
The other type of drug attempts
to combat the virus by strengthening the
immune system that AIDS weakens.
Merigan's lab conducts controlled trials
on a number of different experimental
drugs. A successful treatment must be
shown not to be toxic at effective levels.
