## Israel denies civil, political rights to Palestinians 
### 
IN HIS APRIL 5 LETTER, "Israel
and South Africa dissimilar," Rabbi
Ari Cartun's arguments are not
convincing. Israel, like South Africa,
rules over another people by force,
appropriates their land and water for
its own use and has turned their area
into a source of cheap labor.
In the Jan. 26 New York Times,
First Amendment specialist Martin
Garbus wrote, "There is hardly an
appearance of justice in these military
courts.... Military authorities can
detain and interrogate Palestinians
without charges for months on end."
In recent weeks at least 4,000 Pales
tinians have been herded into deten
tion centers (essentially concentration
camps). Last fall an Israeli inves
tigatory commission revealed that for

16 years Israel's security force, the
Shin Bet, has systematically tortured
Palestinian prisoners to obtain confes
sions but the commission did not order
an end to the practice.
Even more shocking was Amnesty
International's revelation that Israel is
one of 18 countries that torture
children. The Associated Press reported
last August that boys in a Gaza prison
were hooded and beaten, burned and
locked in cupboards.
Rabbi Cartun writes that in Israel
itself, "all citizens are equal before the
law." But according to David Shipler,
whose book on Israel won the Pulitzer
Prize last year, "To be an Israeli Arab
is an invitation to the police, to the
Shin Bet and to the army to be
stopped and searched." They are "dis
criminated against in employment,

housing, education and welfare pay
ments."
Israeli Arabs do not even have politi
cal equality, since "The banning of
Arab political parties is achieved be
cause Shin Bet officials repeatedly
interrogate Arabs who attempt to
organize other Arabs."
One could argue, as Rabbi Cartun
does, that minorities in most countries
suffer discrimination, that "no democ
racy is without its shortcomings" and
that "the enthronement of race as the
basis of law" is what singles out South
Africa.
But the ruthlessness of the policy of
"force, might, beatings," under which
Palestinians of all ages have been
deliberately bludgeoned into bloody
pulp; shutting down the Palestinian

press and the arrest of journalists;
barring TV cameras ("a la South
Africa," as Henry Kissinger described
it); nightly raids of homes and hospi
tals; mass arrests; and the refusal even
to consider negotiations with Palestin
ian leaders â€” all these are indications
not of "ethnic tension" as Rabbi Car
tun puts it, but of underlying racism.
Given such messages and the
brutality that accompanies them, it
seems clear that the Palestinians'
struggle is not only for political free
dom but for the right to be treated as
human beings. As long as they are
denied this right, the specter of South
Africa must necessarily haunt the
people of Israel and those who support
its survival.
