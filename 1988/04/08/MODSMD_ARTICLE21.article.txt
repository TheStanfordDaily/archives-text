# We underestimate significance of sex

### 
Condom vending machines in
residence bathrooms are presumably
the newest weapon in the ongoing
battle against AIDS being waged by
campus health authorities.
Those responsible for the decision
rightly foresee that some students will
find the condom dispensers objec
tionable. But I find it surprising that
the University hasn't taken a more
direct approach to the formidable task
of distributing condoms to the student
population. A more practical plan
might be for the University to insure
that at the beginning of each quarter a
fresh condom is taped to the bedpost
of each bed in all University residen
ces.
Perish the thought that a Stanford
student should have to consider
whether or not to have sex with some

one for the unendurable time that it
takes to dash down the hall to pop a
comdom out of the dispenser.
There is something to be said,
though, for making sex less accessible,
for insisting that our sexual public
policy should be directed at making
people more reflective about the impli
cations of their sexual activity.
The reigning ethic on this campus
regarding sex points to the tearing
away of whatever barriers or incon
veniences might stand in the way of
Stanford students' pursuing their
varied sexual mindset; it goes with the
idea of tolerance and the notion that
whatever someone does voluntarily, so
long as no one else is harmed, ought
not to be the concern of society at
large.
People will forever like and seek sex.
The simple fact that we have sexual
desires which can be satisfied in a
variety of ways does not make those
desires or their satisfaction especially

noble or socially valuable.
How we are to channel our sexual
impulses is too consequential to dis
miss as just another lifestyle choice,
like how we dress or the deodorant we
choose. Sexual tolerance means refrain
ing from active interference with the
sexual practices of others; it does not
mean renouncing private and public
judgment on those practices.
We trivialize sex if we reduce it to
the status of one among many enor
mously satisfying but entirely routine
bodily functions. It seems sometimes
that sex has been relegated to a place
among eating, peeing, scratching and
farting. We have sanitary standards for
it but little else.
We simply don't have to work as
hard to get sex as our parents did.
The prospect of sex on the first en
counter makes all the tiresome non
sense of courting, wooing and romanc
ing unnecessary.
Very oflen there are no intermediate

goals in relationships for our imagina
tions to latch onto. Our sexual atti
tudes don't insist that anything come
between mutual attraction and sexual
intercourse, so very oflen nothing does.
It is difficult to argue that contem
porary liberality concerning acceptable
sexual practices does not relate to the
incidence of rape, the objectification of
women, the sexual abuse of children,
divorce, infidelity.... The list goes on.
Nonetheless, our actions oflen suggest
that we take our sexual standards to
be isolated from these highly disturb
ing social phenomena.
I don't know that self-scrutiny will
make us reconsider putting condom
machines in the dorms. Our sexuality,
and particularly our sexual public
policy, should give us pause, though, if
for no other reason than that we are
profoundly sexual beings.
