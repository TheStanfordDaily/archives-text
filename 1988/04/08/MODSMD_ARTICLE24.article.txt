## One last revelry with the Roble refugees With winter quarter behind them, former residents evaluate the aftershock

yeah!"

If buildings could sing, that's
what Roble Hall would be croon
ing today — perhaps tauntingly,
perhaps venerably. Perhaps the
next verse would be, "I told you
SO.
Roble residents who were forced
to vacate Roble when it was
declared earthquake unsafe in De
cember could also rightfully sing
"I'm Still Standing." But for
them, the tone in their song would
be one of having survived — and
conquered.
While the hardships of the
"Roble Refugees" have already
been expounded upon at great
length, aftershocks are still being
felt. Now that spring quarter is
here, are students finally back on
solid footing?
As the infamous news of Roble's
instability broke at the end of
finals week in December, most
students were already on their
way home for holiday cheer. The
merriment was short-lived, how
ever, when Roble students learned
through the mail that their Stan
ford home was no more. Winter
quarter set in, and the chaotic
scramble began.
Confusion included the search
for new housing, the packing and
moving and the waiting for furni
ture and belongings to arrive.
They lived out of boxes — and
by the way — how were classes
going?
"There was a lot of closing
down stuff to do," said Resident
Assistant Denise Clark, a senior.
She pointed out that changing
phone bills was just one hassle
they faced.
"Most of the freshmen didn't
really get involved in their classes
until at least the second week,
and they're not used to being be
hind. A lot of people are just writ

ing [winter] quarter off," she ex
plained.
Despite the difficulties, Roble
nomads said they understood why
students had grown tired of
hearing about their perils.
"In fairness, people are pretty
sick about hearing about the
Roble scene," Resident Fellow
Ann Porteus said. "I don't blame
people for having a negative re
action."
Perhaps people would have
been more sympathetic if the
crisis had seemed more dire, Por
teus speculated. "If Roble was in
a pile of rubble, people might not
feel so put out," she said. "The
problem is since Roble is stili
standing, people don't feel that it
is a crisis."
Clark, who went overseas fall
quarter of her junior year, said
that the Roble situation was
indeed difficult, more difficult
than the culture shock of return
ing from a different country.
"When you come back from
overseas, it's a totally different
mentality. It's kind of hectic, but
you're prepared for that," she
said. "[ln Roble], you're settled
in for the year, and you're really
disrupted.... It becomes some
thing that you build into your
life, and then it's not there."
The most significant hole in
many people's lives was losing 293
dormmates. With the Roble
diaspora, those who moved to
other places on campus were torn
between holding onto their friend
ships with their old dormmates
— some just blossoming after a

quarter, others deepening with
age — and interspersing with new
ones.
"The thing I miss the most is
the friends I don't see now be
cause we don't live 50 feet from
each other," junior Glenn
Schneider said.
For the more than 50 people
who chose to live off campus,
staying in contact with former
dorm friends is especially difficult.
For them, scheduled functions —
including February's Roble Cafe
Night, attended by over 100 —
help maintain ties. Some Roble
residents are also organizing a
spring quarter dorm show, "The
Importance of Being Earnest," to
be performed tonight at 8:30.
"Anything they try to do to
bring people back together goes
over really well," said senior
Crissie Collins, one Roble refugee
who is living off-campus.
Regardless of living situation,
the choice most Roble expatriates
seemed to have made was to put
Roble behind them. Clark said the
Roble functions were held "much
more in a reunion sense." The
staff philosophy has been to en
courage people to carve new
niches in their new residences.
But integrating wasn't always
easy, according to some ex-Roble
residents. In one residence, the
reception was described as "help
ful, friendly and understanding,"
but in another it was termed "in
different."
Freshman Jack Sparks summed
up the general feeling that the

burden to fit in ultimately fell on
the shoulders of the Roble refu
gees.
"If we took the time to meet
[our new residents], then they
took the time to meet us," he said.
"Roble was like a little family
that was self-sufficient for itself.
Once I moved [to Toyon] I saw
how limiting, how shallow that
(situation) was."
Freshman Michelle Jesse, now
living in Branner Hall, said she
has also benefited from the move.
"My friendships at Roble were
just getting close. But [now] I'm
feeling the same way (about new
ties)."
No one was prepared to say,
however, that meeting new stu
dents was worth the disruption
of leaving Roble mid-year.
As for those living off-campus,
the Roble staff assumed that most
off-campus students are now in
dependent. While RFs Evan and

Ann Porteus rotate around
campus to have dinner with
former Roble people, virtually all
of their contact with off-campus
students comes at the scheduled
functions.
"We try to stay in touch to a
point," Ann Porteus said, "but
there's no way we can do it."
Even as Roble students began
to settle into their new residences
—on or off campus — concentrat
ing on academics remained diffi
cult.
Because the University did not
permit off-campus students to
have any of the Roble furniture,
studying without desks was one
frustration they faced.
"We [did not] have any desks,"
Mathas said. "There are 300 desks
in R0b1e.... I even offered to put
a deposit down. But if you're off
campus, you can't have school
property."
Clark admitted that "furniture

was a problem" but that "there
was enough space to live on
campus." According to Clark, stu
dents did not have to take their
lives "into [their] own hands" and
face the inconveniences of living
off-campus.
Looking back on his winter
quarter, Mathas said he was
satisfied with Stanford's handling
of the situation. Indeed, despite
the many snags, most students
were.
"Given the time pressures and
just the novelty of the situa
tion. ... I think what [Stanford!
did was really commendable," RA
Kym Boyman said.
Stanford "was hit just as hard
by Roble closing as we were,"
Schneider said. "Everybody seems
to have the attitude that it was
the Big Bad University gaining
up on the kids. It was out of their
hands. I think they did everything
and more than they could have."

As the infamous news of Roble's
instability broke at the end of
finals week in December, most
students were already on their
way home for holiday cheer. The
merriment was short-lived, how
ever, when Roble students learned
through the mail that their Stan
ford home was no more. Winter
quarter set in, and the chaotic
scramble began.
Confusion included the search
for new housing, the packing and
moving and the waiting for furni
ture and belongings to arrive.
They lived out of boxes — and
by the way — how were classes
going?
"There was a lot of closing
down stuff to do," said Resident
Assistant Denise Clark, a senior.
She pointed out that changing
phone bills was just one hassle
they faced.
"Most of the freshmen didn't
really get involved in their classes
until at least the second week,
and they're not used to being be
hind. A lot of people are just writ

ing [winter] quarter off," she ex
plained.
Despite the difficulties, Roble
nomads said they understood why
students had grown tired of
hearing about their perils.
"In fairness, people are pretty
sick about hearing about the
Roble scene," Resident Fellow
Ann Porteus said. "I don't blame
people for having a negative re
action."
Perhaps people would have
been more sympathetic if the
crisis had seemed more dire, Por
teus speculated. "If Roble was in
a pile of rubble, people might not
feel so put out," she said. "The
problem is since Roble is stili
standing, people don't feel that it
is a crisis."
Clark, who went overseas fall
quarter of her junior year, said
that the Roble situation was
indeed difficult, more difficult
than the culture shock of return
ing from a different country.
"When you come back from
overseas, it's a totally different
mentality. It's kind of hectic, but
you're prepared for that," she
said. "[ln Roble], you're settled
in for the year, and you're really
disrupted.... It becomes some
thing that you build into your
life, and then it's not there."
The most significant hole in
many people's lives was losing 293
dormmates. With the Roble
diaspora, those who moved to
other places on campus were torn
between holding onto their friend
ships with their old dormmates
— some just blossoming after a

quarter, others deepening with
age — and interspersing with new
ones.
"The thing I miss the most is
the friends I don't see now be
cause we don't live 50 feet from
each other," junior Glenn
Schneider said.
For the more than 50 people
who chose to live off campus,
staying in contact with former
dorm friends is especially difficult.
For them, scheduled functions —
including February's Roble Cafe
Night, attended by over 100 —
help maintain ties. Some Roble
residents are also organizing a
spring quarter dorm show, "The
Importance of Being Earnest," to
be performed tonight at 8:30.
"Anything they try to do to
bring people back together goes
over really well," said senior
Crissie Collins, one Roble refugee
who is living off-campus.
Regardless of living situation,
the choice most Roble expatriates
seemed to have made was to put
Roble behind them. Clark said the
Roble functions were held "much
more in a reunion sense." The
staff philosophy has been to en
courage people to carve new
niches in their new residences.
But integrating wasn't always
easy, according to some ex-Roble
residents. In one residence, the
reception was described as "help
ful, friendly and understanding,"
but in another it was termed "in
different."
Freshman Jack Sparks summed
up the general feeling that the

burden to fit in ultimately fell on
the shoulders of the Roble refu
gees.
"If we took the time to meet
[our new residents], then they
took the time to meet us," he said.
"Roble was like a little family
that was self-sufficient for itself.
Once I moved [to Toyon] I saw
how limiting, how shallow that
(situation) was."
Freshman Michelle Jesse, now
living in Branner Hall, said she
has also benefited from the move.
"My friendships at Roble were
just getting close. But [now] I'm
feeling the same way (about new
ties)."
No one was prepared to say,
however, that meeting new stu
dents was worth the disruption
of leaving Roble mid-year.
As for those living off-campus,
the Roble staff assumed that most
off-campus students are now in
dependent. While RFs Evan and

Ann Porteus rotate around
campus to have dinner with
former Roble people, virtually all
of their contact with off-campus
students comes at the scheduled
functions.
"We try to stay in touch to a
point," Ann Porteus said, "but
there's no way we can do it."
Even as Roble students began
to settle into their new residences
—on or off campus — concentrat
ing on academics remained diffi
cult.
Because the University did not
permit off-campus students to
have any of the Roble furniture,
studying without desks was one
frustration they faced.
"We [did not] have any desks,"
Mathas said. "There are 300 desks
in R0b1e.... I even offered to put
a deposit down. But if you're off
campus, you can't have school
property."
Clark admitted that "furniture

was a problem" but that "there
was enough space to live on
campus." According to Clark, stu
dents did not have to take their
lives "into [their] own hands" and
face the inconveniences of living
off-campus.
Looking back on his winter
quarter, Mathas said he was
satisfied with Stanford's handling
of the situation. Indeed, despite
the many snags, most students
were.
"Given the time pressures and
just the novelty of the situa
tion. ... I think what [Stanford!
did was really commendable," RA
Kym Boyman said.
Stanford "was hit just as hard
by Roble closing as we were,"
Schneider said. "Everybody seems
to have the attitude that it was
the Big Bad University gaining
up on the kids. It was out of their
hands. I think they did everything
and more than they could have."

them, the tone in their song would

"Roble Refugees" have already
been expounded upon at great
