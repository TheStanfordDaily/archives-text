# Brain Teaser plays with linguistics
## 
### Paul de Figueirdo Staff writer 
One afternoon, while sitting in junior high
math class, Johnny Flaherty, an exchange
student from Australia, shouted out, "Does
someone have a rubber I can borrow?"
The class burst into laughter, and a red
faced Johnny proceeded to explain that what
Americans call an eraser, Australians call a
rubber. Johnny had innocently been think
ing about his multipliction tables — not the
birds and the bees.

Differences between the way American
and Australians use particular English
words certainly do exist. Dialects and accents
fascinate me, and with 5,000 different lan
guages and dialects spoken in the world,
my supply for amusement is almost un
limited.
According to the Guinness Book of World
Records, 400 million people — 10 percent
of the world's population — speak English
today. Mandarin Chinese, on the other hand,

is spoken by 700 million people.
English, according to linguists, is a lan
guage of moderate complexity. It contains
some 490,000 words and another 300,000
technical terms.
Guinness claims that the most complex
language in the world is Chippewa, a
Minnesota-area Native American language,
which has as many as 6,000 verb forms.
Not having the drive to study a language
like Chippewa the other night, I began wan
dering around the dorm, seeing how many
different languages were spoken by resi
dents. If we do not count particle physics
as a foreign language, 11 different languages
were spoken among the students I encoun
tered.
To test their fluency, I asked each person
to translate an English phrase that is es
sential to spring quarter Stanford life. See
if you can identify the 11 languages to the
right.
And for all of you eagerly awaiting for
the solutions to last week's corporation logo

(1) Purina, (2) Bantam Books (3) Goodyear
Tire and Rubber (4) Eastern Airlines (5)
Travelers Insurance (6) Goodwill Industries
(7) Rockwell International (8) Kampgrounds
of America (9) The Metropolitan Corp.

Mind benders and puzzles appear in Brain
Teaser every Friday.
