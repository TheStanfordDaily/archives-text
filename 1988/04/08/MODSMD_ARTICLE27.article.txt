"Dominick and Eugene"
Aquarius
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
What makes "Dominick and
Eugene" such a compelling film
is its ability to present the viewer
with an extraordinarily painful di
lemma and set it in such un
pretentious and believable terms.
The film centers on the rela
tionship between two twin broth
ers, Nicky and Gino Luciano
(played by Tom Hulce and Ray
Liatto respectively). Both of them,
now parentless, share their vastly
divergent lives and a run-down
apartment in a working class
neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
Nicky, who is mentally handi
capped as a result of a childhood
accident, has helped to put Gino
through medical school by
working as a garbage truck hel
per. Gino is not only brilliant and
intense but also a compassionate
brother who faces a crisis of con
science when he gets a prestigious
internship at Stanford — one
which he covets but one which
will ultimately take him away
from his brother.
Nicky's close, dependent rela
tionship to Gino is also threatened
by the appearance of a girl, Jen
nifer Reston (Jamie Lee Curtis),
no doubt one of Gino's rare
friendships since he began medi
cal school.
Hulce was excellent in Ama
deus, and his performance as
Nicky, a character so strikingly
different from the wunderkind
Mozart, shows Hulce's remark
able range as an actor. Hulce's
measured simplicity and sincerity
in this role brings an exceptional

and compelling dignity to Nicky's
character.
The film's greatest success is
its ability to capture an extraordi
nary dilemma in such ordinary
settings. Young's greatest stylistic
success in the film is how he
sketches the setting in his charac
terizations.
Director Robert Young proceeds
gently, building his world with
care, until all the blocks are in
place. Our belief in the final action
will depend on a devastating rev
elation, which we must read en
tirely in Hulce's face — and we
do. There have been no hints, no
easy foreshadowing to take away
from this moment.
See this movie. You won't
regret it.

"Bright Lights, Big City"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
"Bright Lights, Big City" is yet
another movie about the bumpy
stretches in the fast lane, showing
us once again that the sexy night
life and cocaine are hollow
pleasures that leave you sad and
with a bloody nose.
The novel "Bright Lights, Big
City" was a shallow and jazzy tale
of a young writer going into a
cocaine tailspin in New York, and
the movie follows the book care
fully, only it isn't nearly so sleek.
While the novel was punchy, fast,
immediate, the movie is clunky
and removed, though not without

its own (few) fine moments.
Michael J. Fox plays the lead,
Jamie, whose plasticky fashion
model wife (Phoebe Cates) has left
him. He's taken it hard (God
knows why) and now spends his
nights at clubs, drinking and
taking different drugs, egged on
by his corrupt and seductive
friend Tad Allagash (Kiefer Suth
erland).
It's the usual array of scenes:
discos where Jamie smiles but
clearly feels alone, toilet stalls
where he snorts cocaine, over
sleeping in the morning and com
ing in late to work. He's losing it.
His job, fact-checking at a stuf
fy, prestigious magazine, bores
him, and his boss, a truly terri
fying woman who looks like a
spinster librarian or first-grade
teacher, lectures and emasculates
him daily. (These scenes are ter
rific.) It's a comical set-up, put
together with imagination and
flair, but it still seems stale.
Fox is very funny, and he brings
some sparkle to the story, but he
also looks like he should be swap
ping baseball cards by the jungle
gym, not living the glitzy life in
New York.
Despite his good acting, he
looks too young for the role —
like a child actor impersonating
a grown-up. Actually, this may
bring some unintended humor to
the whole production: He's a child
caught in an adult world and no
one seems to notice.
Flashback scenes of Jamie's
dying mother (Dianne Wiest) are
sometimes moving, but too often
sappy. They are supposed to help
explain why Jamie has gone into

this numb, druggy phase, but they
really don't do much at all except
show us a better life than the one
Jamie is living, a life of traditional
values.
How many more movies and
books about the emptiness of the
fast lane do we need or want?
This seems to be the "hot" topic
these days, but it's getting boring.
We get the point: Drugs and clubs
are not the way to live. Now take
it from there, Hollywood; show
us something new. Show us what
happens to Jamie when he's back
on his feet; show us his problems
then.
"Bright Lights, Big City" is a
mediocre movie: unoriginal and
flat. It isn't bad, but there's noth
ing about it that will startle or
deeply impress.

"The Seventh Sign"
AMC Old Mill Six
San Antonio/Central
Mountain View
The Seventh Sign should be a
"Do not enter" sign. This slow,
calm and uninspiring "thriller"
might be OK television fare at 2
a.m., but just barely.
A tale of the Apocalypse, the
story takes place sometime tomor
row. Abby Quinn (Demi Moore)
is going to have a baby, a very
special baby. Her baby will be
born without a soul and then the
whole world goes down the tubes
in the culmination of a series of
strange occurences.
A mysterious blond man (Jur
gen Prochnow) runs around
breaking ancient seals on ancient
parchments, and ancient prophe

cies come to life. On Christmas
day the seas off Tahiti boil and
the locals have more cooked fish
than they know what to do with.
Three days later a small town in
the desert in Israel freezes over.
Then things become more con
fusing, and I lost track of which
sign we were on.
The seal-breaking stranger
moves into the garage apartment
behind the Quinns, and Abby
starts taking quantum leaps in
paranoia in coming to the conclu
sion that the stranger is after her
baby.
Abby, while searching the
stranger's room, steps on a seal
and causes a bird to die, an earth
quake and a hailstorm that drops
tennis ball-size hail on everyone
but doesn't dent the cars.
Unfortunately, all these neat
things don't make this an inter
esting movie. There are a lot of
subplots that are clumsily han
dled and, I hate to give away the
ending, but the world is eventu
ally saved.
When the world was saved, the
audience in the theater laughed,
groaned, threw their popcorn in
the air and thought about leaving.
The part I liked best is when
a Jewish Scholar is talking to a
Catholic priest about the possibil
ity of all this really indicating The
End. When asked who was right
about the Apocalypse, the priest
said, "Oh my God, what if it's
the Hare Krishnas?"
That line isn't even worth a $3
matinee. For two bucks you can
rent the movie (eventually) and
then you can use the slow motion
to look for the seams where they
attached the tummy on Moore.
