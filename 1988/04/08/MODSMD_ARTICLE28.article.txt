# Roble is closed but the show goes on
## 
### James Mokhiber Staff writer 
Senior Johnathan Baylor's
duties as director of his dorm's
play, "The Importance of Being
Earnest," have forced him to cut
classes, lose a lot of sleep and
return calls after midnight.
Unusual? The University closed
Baylor's dorm, Roble Hall, three
months ago and evicted all 294
of its student residents.
For some people the show truly
must go on.
Having borrowed a stage, props
and costumes, more than 25
former Roble students have
succeeded in mounting an ambi
tious production of this Oscar
Wilde satire of social propriety to
be performed free of charge today
and tomorrow at 8 p.m. in Ster
ling Quad's Ricker Performance
Center.
"There was an unusual energy
in Roble Hall," Baylor said. "And
we wanted to work with that."
Production plans fell briefly

into limbo after Roble closed last
December, but were resurrected
after a minor three-week delay.
Mid-January tryouts for the play
brought a sizable though largely
inexperienced cast and crew to
gether.
Prompted by Resident Fellow
Ann Porteus and promised finan
cial support from Residential Ed
ucation, the revived play was seen
mainly as an occasion for Roble
students to remain in contact with
each other. "Originally it was a
let's-keep-Roble-together kind of
thing," said Kevin Richardson,
the assistant director, "because
everyone was still searching for
vestiges of Roble activities. .. .
(But) the scale grew. It's turned
out to be a regular play and not
just a dorm play."
Baylor said that they were able
to overcome the initial obstacle of
a relatively inexperienced crew by
having the actors partake in all
facets of the production, including
set-building and prop-gathering.
With the addition of props and

effects from the Stanford
Savoyards, Ram's Head and the
Drama Department, Baylor said
the play had "definitely become a
collective thespian effort."
Since the cast is composed ex
clusively of Roble students, the
replacement of one of the lead
characters three weeks into pro
duction was the cause of great
concern. "At that point I really
wondered if we could complete
this project," Baylor said. "It's
been a roller coaster."
According to stage manager
Erica Webber, the real difficulty
was coordinating logistics because
the cast was dispersed across and
off campus. Rehearsal areas were
constantly changed, and storage
areas were hard to find. Further
more, communication was "frus
trating" and was mainly accom
plished via an information box left
outside Porteus' office.
Lighting was one of the most
nettlesome problems for the pro
duction. The crew was unable to
gain access to University equip

ment normally supplied through
the Undergraduate Lighting Proj
ect because of the project's staff
ing problems. Organizers were
forced to turn to a private com
pany based in San Jose, which
consumed a large portion of the
already limited funds.
To a lesser degree, the play has
been the victim of a sense of over
kill by Roble coverage. Junior
Frank Beadle, who plays the pom
pous but good-at-heart Jack
Worthing, noted that "Some
people react to the play like 'Oh
God, not another Roble thing,' but
more just recognize it's a lot of
work." Richardson agreed, "Some
are reacting bitterly, but others
think it's hot that we're still to
gether."
Several members of the cast
shrug off such criticism. "I didn't
do it because 'Roble must be
remembered,'" said Junior Sara
Dougherty who plays the gover
ness Miss Prism. "I did it because
it seemed like a lot of fun and a

good way to stay in touch."
For Doug Dorst, a freshman
who plays the ineffable Algernon,
the play has allowed him to main
tain contact with friends he might
not otherwise see. "At the risk of
sounding sappy, 'It' is still
there. ... There's still a whole lot
of friendship."
While other events are planned
for the displaced Roble students

throughout spring quarter, this
is the last event open to non-Roble
students. Therefore, despite their
personal motivations, the cast is
aware that others will be watch
ing.
"We decided: 'Let's not make
it another dorm play,'" Richard
son said, "Let's make it a per
forming swan song for the whole
campus to see.'"
