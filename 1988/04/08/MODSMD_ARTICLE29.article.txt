## Witchel wins but Card 5th out of NCAA gate 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
INDIANAPOLIS - The
crowd was smaller, the team
points fewer, and the mo
mentum not quite as strong,
but at least one result was
familiar: Stanford swim
ming won gold.

Sophomore John Witchel won the 500
freestyle in a scathing time of 4:15.67 dur
ing the first evening of competition at the
NCAA Men's Swimming Championships in
Indianapolis yesterday.
Witchel recorded not only his best clock
ing of the season but also of his career,
coming within two seconds of the American
record.
Witchel entered the finals seeded second
behind USC's Dan Jorgensen after swim
ming 4:17.04 in the morning heats.
"I'd rather enter at second or third be
cause then the pressure's on the first seed,"
Witchel said. "The thing that really
motivated me was swimming against four
USC competitors. I felt I was the only
thing standing between USC and us."
The remainder of the Stanford squad
did not fare quite so well.
After a completion of the first day's
events, Stanford is in fifth place overall at
64.5 points, trailing leader USC (120.5) by
an almost insurmountable 50 points. Texas
(110) is in second, followed by Louisiana
State (78) and California (70).
In addition, Stanford's three-time
defending national champion medley relay
team was dethroned by Texas. The squad
of junior Jay Mortenson, freshman Matt

Rodgers, senior Anthony Mosse and soph
omore Doug Lillydahl clocked a seasonal
best of 3:14.8, but it was not enough to
catch the Longhorns, and the Cardinal fell
in one of its traditionally strong events.
Witchel, however, is still optomistic
about the Cardinal's chance of capturing
a fourth consecutive NCAA crown.
"We were prepared not to be in the lead
at this point, and we're only about 12
points behind where we wanted to be," he
said. "The situation looks worse than it is.
We have enough momentum to have a good
day Friday."
The Cardinal's placing is largely a result
of sluggish morning qualifying swims. Trial
performances left the Cardinal with racers
in only two championship finals (top eight
swimmers) and two consolation finals
(ninth-16th place). Disappointments in
cluded the swims of sophomore Lunn Les
tina in the 500 free, senior Matt Nance in
the 200 IM and sophomore Jeff Garr in
the 50 free. All failed to qualify for the
evening final heats.
However, despite having only three in
dividuals and one relay team competing in
the finals, Stanford reversed its momentum
at the evening races.
"We struggled in the morning, but the
guys came back tonight and did a great
job," Stanford Coach Skip Kenney said. "It
was great to see the momentum pick up
amd the team spirit grow. It really helped
everyone's swims."
Sprint freestylist Lillydahl qualified for
the consolation finals of the 50 free in the
last position but moved up to 13th place

Stanford sophomore John Witchel swam a career-best 4:15.67 in the 500-yard freestyle last night in Indianapolis to
capture the gold in the event. Witchel was seeded second entering the final heat, but edged (JSC's Dan Jorgensen
by 1.49 seconds to win for the Cardinal.

with his swim of 20.25. Sopho
more Byron Burson, seeded 12th
in the 200 IM, clinched 10th place
with his 1:40.13 effort. And junior
Matt Frawley placed 16th in the
one-meter diving competion.
According to Mosse, the team's
performance in the evening had
the Cardinal going in the right
direction heading into today's
competion, which includes several

of Stanford's best events: the 200
free, 100 fly, 100 back, 100 breast,
400 IM, 800 free relay and three
meter diving.
"We have a couple of very spec
tacular 100 racers," tri-captain
Mosse said. "As far as the meet
goes, we're getting better and bet
ter, which has been the case this
entire season."
Kenney is not as optimistic, but
does not count Stanford out.
"There's a slim chance we can
win," he said. "We put ourselves
in a real hole. If we have a great

day Friday we can climb out. We
do have the capability."
