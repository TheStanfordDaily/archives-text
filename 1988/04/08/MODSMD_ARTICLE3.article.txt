# Tension of road to tenure aggravates junior faculty
## 
### Jeff Album 
Editor's note: This article is the second
of a two-part series examining Stanford's
tenure system and its effects on the fac
ulty.

When Jeremy Cohen took his first
physical exam after arriving to begin his
Stanford professorial career, the doctor
looked at him and asked a critical health
related question.
"What will you do if you don't get
tenure?"
According to members of the faculty
who are on the tenure track, it is a
question that pervades the rank and file.
For some, it creates an atmosphere of

intimidation that must be dealt with on
a daily basis.
"The number one topic among every
one I know who is an assistant professor
is tenure," said Cohen, an assistant pro
fessor at the Communication Depart
ment. "You carry the threat of that with
you. It affects everything," he said.
With a review of tenure policies coming
up this year in the Faculty Senate, it is
likely that debate over the procedures
that govern the tenure process will heat
up. The issue strikes at the very heart
of the University.
The charge given to the Second Senate
Ad Hoc Committee of the Professoriate
at Stanford is broad in nature. It asks
the committee to investigate "the criteria,

general procedures and policies governing
the appointment, reappointment, promo
tion and notice of non-renewal or non
promotion of members of the Academic
Council. ..."
In addition, the committee is instructed
to review policies affecting the Universi
ty's nontenured faculty, such as research
associates, lecturers and courtesy ap
pointments.
"It's a kind of housecleaning that needs
to be done," said Communication Prof.
Henry Breitrose, president of the Stan
ford chapter of the American Association
of University Professors. Breitrose
believes it is appropriate to continually
address tenure issues at the University,
but he is wary of any proposals for drastic

changes that might come from a review
of those issues.
"As long as the University lives up to
its own rules, the process is sufficient,"
Breitrose said.
What is unclear and likely to remain
so until winter 1988, when the committee
gives its first report to the senate, is
whether proposed changes will make ten
ure easier, harder or simply smoother
for candidates.
Asst. Provost Noel Kolak, who will staff
the committee, made it clear Thursday
that the committee might not have any
changes to propose by the winter dead
line.
Kolak did say, however, that the com
mittee would consider extending the

seven-year mandatory tenure review pe
riod. While the possibility of adding a
few years to the tenure track might sug
gest yet another obstacle in the paths of
professors seeking tenure, Kolak said an
extention might have the opposite effect.
"The longer a person is a staff member,
the more difficult it becomes to terminate
that person," Kolak said. "That can lead
to a decrease in the quality of the fac
ulty."
On the other hand, Kolak said there
could also be advantages to the longer
tenure period for departments like phi
losophy and archaeology, where seven
years is not always long enough for pro-
fessors to collect and evaluate the
research that will determine their
level of scholarship in the eyes of
tenure review committees.
From the perspective of the
people who must go through the
tenure ordeal, it is clear that wor
rying about tenure takes its toll.
The possibility that changes could
make tenure even harder fuels
their anxieties.
"Having these guys (senior fac
ulty) read every word you've ever
written and then tell you what
they think isn't very fun," said
one assistant professor who is cur
rently a candidate for tenure. "I'll
be glad when it's done."
Asst. Communication Prof.
ClifT Nass, still in his first term,
deals with the prospect of tenure
rejection in a different way.
"My resolution to this absurdity
is not to worry because there's
no solution," Nass said.
Another aspect of how the Uni
versity treats its faculty is its pol
icies toward faculty outside of the
tenure track, many of whom are
hoping for promotion to a tenure
track position. In particular, the
loss of Coit Blacker, a senior re
search associate at the Center for
International Security and Arms

Control, raises auestions about
the University's ability to hold on
to non-tenured personnel.
Blacker, who recently accepted
a tenured position offered by the
University of Southern California,
said in an interview yesterday
that being offered tenure was a
msgor factor in his decision to
leave Stanford. According to
Blacker, Stanford did not have
any mechanism available to
counter USC's offer in time for
him to choose.
Blacker went, instead, for the
sure thing: job security.
The perspective from tenure
track faculty is no brighter.
An untenured professor, who
asked not to be named, suggested
that one thing protecting junior
faculty from anxiety is their ar
rogance â€” an over-confidence
that brings them to Stanford in
the first place and deludes them
into thinking they will win tenure,
despite odds that they will not.
"Everyone thinks, 'So what if
there's a one-in-10 chance? I've
been the one in 10 all my life,' "
she said.
The professor pointed out, how
ever, that at Stanford, junior fac
ulty compete with top-notch
scholars who also have been the
one in 10 for most of their lives.
She speculated that tenure denial
may come to these people as a
rude awakening.

tenure track, many of whom are
hoping for promotion to a tenure
track position. In particular, the
loss of Coit Blacker, a senior re
search associate at the Center for
International Security and Arms

Control, raises auestions about
the University's ability to hold on
to non-tenured personnel.
Blacker, who recently accepted
a tenured position offered by the
University of Southern California,
said in an interview yesterday
that being offered tenure was a
msgor factor in his decision to
leave Stanford. According to
Blacker, Stanford did not have
any mechanism available to
counter USC's offer in time for
him to choose.
Blacker went, instead, for the
sure thing: job security.
The perspective from tenure
track faculty is no brighter.
An untenured professor, who
asked not to be named, suggested
that one thing protecting junior
faculty from anxiety is their ar
rogance â€” an over-confidence
that brings them to Stanford in
the first place and deludes them
into thinking they will win tenure,
despite odds that they will not.
"Everyone thinks, 'So what if
there's a one-in-10 chance? I've
been the one in 10 all my life,' "
she said.
The professor pointed out, how
ever, that at Stanford, junior fac
ulty compete with top-notch
scholars who also have been the
one in 10 for most of their lives.
She speculated that tenure denial
may come to these people as a
rude awakening.
Editor's note: This article is the second
of a two-part series examining Stanford's
tenure system and its effects on the fac
ulty.

When Jeremy Cohen took his first
physical exam after arriving to begin his
Stanford professorial career, the doctor
looked at him and asked a critical health
related question.
"What will you do if you don't get
tenure?"
According to members of the faculty
who are on the tenure track, it is a
question that pervades the rank and file.
For some, it creates an atmosphere of

intimidation that must be dealt with on
a daily basis.
"The number one topic among every
one I know who is an assistant professor
is tenure," said Cohen, an assistant pro
fessor at the Communication Depart
ment. "You carry the threat of that with
you. It affects everything," he said.
With a review of tenure policies coming
up this year in the Faculty Senate, it is
likely that debate over the procedures
that govern the tenure process will heat
up. The issue strikes at the very heart
of the University.
The charge given to the Second Senate
Ad Hoc Committee of the Professoriate
at Stanford is broad in nature. It asks
the committee to investigate "the criteria,

general procedures and policies governing
the appointment, reappointment, promo
tion and notice of non-renewal or non
promotion of members of the Academic
Council. ..."
In addition, the committee is instructed
to review policies affecting the Universi
ty's nontenured faculty, such as research
associates, lecturers and courtesy ap
pointments.
"It's a kind of housecleaning that needs
to be done," said Communication Prof.
Henry Breitrose, president of the Stan
ford chapter of the American Association
of University Professors. Breitrose
believes it is appropriate to continually
address tenure issues at the University,
but he is wary of any proposals for drastic

changes that might come from a review
of those issues.
"As long as the University lives up to
its own rules, the process is sufficient,"
Breitrose said.
What is unclear and likely to remain
so until winter 1988, when the committee
gives its first report to the senate, is
whether proposed changes will make ten
ure easier, harder or simply smoother
for candidates.
Asst. Provost Noel Kolak, who will staff
the committee, made it clear Thursday
that the committee might not have any
changes to propose by the winter dead
line.
Kolak did say, however, that the com
mittee would consider extending the

seven-year mandatory tenure review pe
riod. While the possibility of adding a
few years to the tenure track might sug
gest yet another obstacle in the paths of
professors seeking tenure, Kolak said an
extention might have the opposite effect.
"The longer a person is a staff member,
the more difficult it becomes to terminate
that person," Kolak said. "That can lead
to a decrease in the quality of the fac
ulty."
On the other hand, Kolak said there
could also be advantages to the longer
tenure period for departments like phi
losophy and archaeology, where seven
years is not always long enough for pro-
fessors to collect and evaluate the
research that will determine their
level of scholarship in the eyes of
tenure review committees.
From the perspective of the
people who must go through the
tenure ordeal, it is clear that wor
rying about tenure takes its toll.
The possibility that changes could
make tenure even harder fuels
their anxieties.
"Having these guys (senior fac
ulty) read every word you've ever
written and then tell you what
they think isn't very fun," said
one assistant professor who is cur
rently a candidate for tenure. "I'll
be glad when it's done."
Asst. Communication Prof.
ClifT Nass, still in his first term,
deals with the prospect of tenure
rejection in a different way.
"My resolution to this absurdity
is not to worry because there's
no solution," Nass said.
Another aspect of how the Uni
versity treats its faculty is its pol
icies toward faculty outside of the
tenure track, many of whom are
hoping for promotion to a tenure
track position. In particular, the
loss of Coit Blacker, a senior re
search associate at the Center for
International Security and Arms

Control, raises auestions about
the University's ability to hold on
to non-tenured personnel.
