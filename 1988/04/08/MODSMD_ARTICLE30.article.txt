# Sprague pulls pro dream nearer
## Cardinal home-run pacesetter leads Stanford into Arizona for three 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Ed Sprague wasn't born with
a baseball bat in his hands. But
if he had been, he would have
been a pull hitter, even in his
diapers.
"I've always been a pull hitter,"
Sprague said.
He has also always wanted to
be a professional baseball player.
"That's been a dream for me
since Day One," he said.
Most observers think Sprague,
Stanford's junior third baseman,
will have a chance to realize that
dream soon.
Baseball America, the Bible of
minor league baseball, has
forecast him as a probable first
round pick in the leagues'
June amateur draft. Sprague —
who goes into this weekend's
three-game Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division series at
Arizona with a .336 average (.375
in Six-Pac play), 12 home runs,
34 RBI and a .656 slugging per
centage — is rated 11th among
all college prospects by the pub
lication.
That's all well and good, says
Sprague, but he's not entirely
sure he's going pro after this year.
And if he is sure, he's not telling
anyone.
"It's always nice to be forecast
(as a first-rqund draft pick)," he
said. "But I try not to think about
myself like that.... I still have a
job to do here at Stanford — I
have to think about that first."
Sprague said he will definitely

enter the draft this year. How
ever, whether he signs with a
team will depend on "a lot of fac
tors."
In the meantime, he also wants
to play on the 1988 U.S. Olympic
baseball team, which will be
coached by Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess. It's conceivable that he
would sign with a pro team, play
on the Olympic team this sum
mer, then report to the pro team
in the fall.
That would depend on whether
"pro baseball is going to cooperate
with the USBF (United States
Baseball Federation) in allowing
pro draftees to play on the Olym
pic team," Sprague said.
"I would hope they (the profes
sional teams) would cooperate if
they want the U.S. to make a
good showing," he added.
Regardless of what happens in
this year's draft or with the Olym
pics, Sprague said he wants to be
in the major leagues by 1991 or
1992. "I think that's realistic for
me," he said. "Two or three years
in the minors, and then I'll be 22
or 23."
Sprague said he won't be picky
about what team he plays for.
"I'd prefer to stay on the West
Coast, because I've always lived
out here," he said, naming the
A's, Giants, Dodgers, Angels and
Padres as possible candidates.
"But I'd be more than happy if
anybody took me in the first
round.... I'd have to look at what
team needs what."
Sprague usually pitched or
played first base at St. Mary's

High School in Stockton and has
developed into a steady if unspec
tacular third baseman since
taking up that position for the
Cardinal in his freshman year.
Still, many scouts and observers
have him pegged to play catcher
in the pros because of his strong
arm.
"I wouldn't mind [playing
catcher], but I think I can play
third in the pros, too," he said.
"I think you can make it into the
pros more easily as a catcher, be
cause there aren't that many good
catchers around. I've caught a
little bit, but that will be an ad
justment."
Usually, however, when people
talk about Sprague, they don't
talk about his defense — they talk
about his hitting. "Obviously, my
bat is going to determine where
I go in baseball," he said.
Indeed, Sprague's home runs
are dazzling, not so much for their
frequency as for their trajectory.
No wind-aided, aluminum-bat
homers for him — his home runs
are rockets, just like his singles,
but a little higher.
And they are to left field. Pe
riod. Sprague's tendency to pull
the ball is so pronounced, in fact,
that in a Six-Pac series last week
end, California unveiled a new de
fensive shift against him. Golden
Bear second baseman Darryl Vice
moved over to the shortstop side
of second base, and centerfielder
Darren Lewis played in the left
center alley.
"That was the first time I'd
seen that used against me,"
Sprague said. "It's funny — kinda
humors you a little bit. But it
worked.... It screwed me up. . ..
They got me tinkering with my
swing, trying to push the ball over
toward second base."
Sprague will probably continue
to pull the ball even after he
switches over to the heavier
wooden bats used in professional
baseball. Although many baseball
experts say college players are
handicapped in the pros because
they spend three or four years
learning bad habits with alumi
num bats, Sprague isn't worried
about the transition to wood.
"I've swung wood my entire
life," he said. "That's going to be
a fun adjustment for me."
If it seems like Sprague isn't
intimidated by the prospect of
playing in the mtyor leagues,
that's because he isn't. His father,
Ed Sprague Sr., was a big-league
pitcher for the A's, Cincinnati
Reds, St. Louis Cardinals and Mil
waukee Brewers, so Ed Jr. grew
up around professional baseball.
The elder Sprague also owned
a minor league team — the Stock
ton Ports of the Class A California
League — for a few years, and
his son was a batboy for the team.
"I've always been around the
clubhouse," Sprague says. "That
helped me out mentally — I saw
what it takes."
And most observers agree that
the younger Sprague has what it
takes to follow in the footsteps of
his dad and make it in the miyor
leagues.

in the Six-Pac going into the week

Field in Tucson, Ariz. The Cardinal,
ranked ninth nationally by Baseball
America and 12th by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball, is tied with USC for second
in the league, a half game behind
first-place Cal. Arizona is in the
league cellar, with a 25-18 overall
record but a woeful 2-12 record in
the Six-Pac.
In other Six-Pac action this week
end, Cal plays at UCLA and USC
takes on Arizona State in Tempe,
Ariz.
Tonight's game is at 6 p.m. PDT,
as is tomorrow night's. Sunday's
game is at noon. All three games will
be broadcast live by KZSU-90.1 FM,
with the dulcet tones of John "Tor

Chappel carressing the air waves.
Senior Lee Plemel (5-3 with a 4.36
ERA this season) will start tonight
for the Cardinal, which is bad news
for the Wildcats. Plemel has virtually
owned Arizona over the last three
years. His career mark against the
Wildcats is 6-0 with a 1.18 ERA He
has allowed six earned runs in 45.7
innings against Arizona.
Plemel's 277 career strikeouts put
him third on the all-time list at Stan
ford, and leave him only 60 whiffs
short of the school record of 337 set
by Jack McDowell in the 1985, '86
and '87 seasons.
Speaking of McDowell, the lanky
right-hander made his 1988 debut for
the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday.
He went seven innings against the
Angels, giving up only one run on
four hits but getting no decision in a
game the Angels eventually won.
Freshman Mike Mussina (6-1,
3.31) will start tomorrow's game for
Stanford, with fellow freshman Stan
Spencer (4-1, 2.53) going on Sunday.
Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall will
miss tonight's game to attend the fu
neral of his father, who died Tuesday.
It has been a tough year for the well
liked Kindall. His wife, Georgia, died
last June 27 after a lengthy illness.
Sophomore designated hitter Tim
Griffin is batting .387 in 31 at-bata.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen
is leading the regulars in hitting with
a .342 average to go with 11 doubles
and four home runs. Paulsen is riding
a team-high 14-game hitting streak.
The Cardinal's team fielding per
centage of .970 is on pace to break
the school record of .968, set in 1967.
That 1967 squad featured an Ail-
American first baseman named Mark
Marquess.
Stanford has outscored its oppo
nents 46-19 in the first inningß of its
games this year, but has been out
scored 20-8 in ninth innings.
Going into a string of seven straight
Six-Pac road games, the Cardinal is
18-3 at home, but 6-8 on the road.
After getting his first collegiate hit,
relief pitcher Steve Chitren is leading
the team in batting with a 1.000

(as a first-rqund draft pick)," he
said. "But I try not to think about
myself like that.... I still have a
job to do here at Stanford — I
have to think about that first."
Sprague said he will definitely

enter the draft this year. How
ever, whether he signs with a
team will depend on "a lot of fac
tors."
In the meantime, he also wants
to play on the 1988 U.S. Olympic
baseball team, which will be
coached by Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess. It's conceivable that he
would sign with a pro team, play
on the Olympic team this sum
mer, then report to the pro team
in the fall.
That would depend on whether
"pro baseball is going to cooperate
with the USBF (United States
Baseball Federation) in allowing
pro draftees to play on the Olym
pic team," Sprague said.
"I would hope they (the profes
sional teams) would cooperate if
they want the U.S. to make a
good showing," he added.
Regardless of what happens in
this year's draft or with the Olym
pics, Sprague said he wants to be
in the major leagues by 1991 or
1992. "I think that's realistic for
me," he said. "Two or three years
in the minors, and then I'll be 22
or 23."
Sprague said he won't be picky
about what team he plays for.
"I'd prefer to stay on the West
Coast, because I've always lived
out here," he said, naming the
A's, Giants, Dodgers, Angels and
Padres as possible candidates.
"But I'd be more than happy if
anybody took me in the first
round.... I'd have to look at what
team needs what."
Sprague usually pitched or
played first base at St. Mary's

High School in Stockton and has
developed into a steady if unspec
tacular third baseman since
taking up that position for the
Cardinal in his freshman year.
Still, many scouts and observers
have him pegged to play catcher
in the pros because of his strong
arm.
"I wouldn't mind [playing
catcher], but I think I can play
third in the pros, too," he said.
"I think you can make it into the
pros more easily as a catcher, be
cause there aren't that many good
catchers around. I've caught a
little bit, but that will be an ad
justment."
Usually, however, when people
talk about Sprague, they don't
talk about his defense — they talk
about his hitting. "Obviously, my
bat is going to determine where
I go in baseball," he said.
Indeed, Sprague's home runs
are dazzling, not so much for their
frequency as for their trajectory.
No wind-aided, aluminum-bat
homers for him — his home runs
are rockets, just like his singles,
but a little higher.
And they are to left field. Pe
riod. Sprague's tendency to pull
the ball is so pronounced, in fact,
that in a Six-Pac series last week
end, California unveiled a new de
fensive shift against him. Golden
Bear second baseman Darryl Vice
moved over to the shortstop side
of second base, and centerfielder
Darren Lewis played in the left
center alley.
"That was the first time I'd
seen that used against me,"
Sprague said. "It's funny — kinda
humors you a little bit. But it
worked.... It screwed me up. . ..
They got me tinkering with my
swing, trying to push the ball over
toward second base."
Sprague will probably continue
to pull the ball even after he
switches over to the heavier
wooden bats used in professional
baseball. Although many baseball
experts say college players are
handicapped in the pros because
they spend three or four years
learning bad habits with alumi
num bats, Sprague isn't worried
about the transition to wood.
"I've swung wood my entire
life," he said. "That's going to be
a fun adjustment for me."
If it seems like Sprague isn't
intimidated by the prospect of
playing in the mtyor leagues,
that's because he isn't. His father,
Ed Sprague Sr., was a big-league
pitcher for the A's, Cincinnati
Reds, St. Louis Cardinals and Mil
waukee Brewers, so Ed Jr. grew
up around professional baseball.
The elder Sprague also owned
a minor league team — the Stock
ton Ports of the Class A California
League — for a few years, and
his son was a batboy for the team.
"I've always been around the
clubhouse," Sprague says. "That
helped me out mentally — I saw
what it takes."
And most observers agree that
the younger Sprague has what it
takes to follow in the footsteps of
his dad and make it in the miyor
leagues.

Field in Tucson, Ariz. The Cardinal,
ranked ninth nationally by Baseball
America and 12th by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball, is tied with USC for second
in the league, a half game behind
first-place Cal. Arizona is in the
league cellar, with a 25-18 overall
record but a woeful 2-12 record in
the Six-Pac.
In other Six-Pac action this week
end, Cal plays at UCLA and USC
takes on Arizona State in Tempe,
Ariz.
Tonight's game is at 6 p.m. PDT,
as is tomorrow night's. Sunday's
game is at noon. All three games will
be broadcast live by KZSU-90.1 FM,
with the dulcet tones of John "Tor

Chappel carressing the air waves.
Senior Lee Plemel (5-3 with a 4.36
ERA this season) will start tonight
for the Cardinal, which is bad news
for the Wildcats. Plemel has virtually
owned Arizona over the last three
years. His career mark against the
Wildcats is 6-0 with a 1.18 ERA He
has allowed six earned runs in 45.7
innings against Arizona.
Plemel's 277 career strikeouts put
him third on the all-time list at Stan
ford, and leave him only 60 whiffs
short of the school record of 337 set
by Jack McDowell in the 1985, '86
and '87 seasons.
Speaking of McDowell, the lanky
right-hander made his 1988 debut for
the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday.
He went seven innings against the
Angels, giving up only one run on
four hits but getting no decision in a
game the Angels eventually won.
Freshman Mike Mussina (6-1,
3.31) will start tomorrow's game for
Stanford, with fellow freshman Stan
Spencer (4-1, 2.53) going on Sunday.
Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall will
miss tonight's game to attend the fu

It has been a tough year for the well
liked Kindall. His wife, Georgia, died
last June 27 after a lengthy illness.
Sophomore designated hitter Tim
Griffin is batting .387 in 31 at-bata.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen
is leading the regulars in hitting with
a .342 average to go with 11 doubles
and four home runs. Paulsen is riding
a team-high 14-game hitting streak.
The Cardinal's team fielding per
centage of .970 is on pace to break
the school record of .968, set in 1967.
That 1967 squad featured an Ail-
American first baseman named Mark
Marquess.
Stanford has outscored its oppo
nents 46-19 in the first inningß of its
games this year, but has been out
scored 20-8 in ninth innings.
Going into a string of seven straight
Six-Pac road games, the Cardinal is
18-3 at home, but 6-8 on the road.
After getting his first collegiate hit,
relief pitcher Steve Chitren is leading
the team in batting with a 1.000

Junior Ed Sprague Is an excellent bet to follow In his father's
footsteps and play Major League Baseball. Sprague plays third
base for the Cardinal but may be converted to catcher for the pros.
Ed Sprague wasn't born with
a baseball bat in his hands. But
if he had been, he would have
been a pull hitter, even in his
diapers.
"I've always been a pull hitter,"
Sprague said.
He has also always wanted to
be a professional baseball player.
"That's been a dream for me
since Day One," he said.
Most observers think Sprague,
Stanford's junior third baseman,
will have a chance to realize that
dream soon.
Baseball America, the Bible of
minor league baseball, has
forecast him as a probable first
round pick in the leagues'
June amateur draft. Sprague —
who goes into this weekend's
three-game Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division series at
Arizona with a .336 average (.375
in Six-Pac play), 12 home runs,
34 RBI and a .656 slugging per
centage — is rated 11th among
all college prospects by the pub
lication.
That's all well and good, says
Sprague, but he's not entirely
sure he's going pro after this year.
And if he is sure, he's not telling
anyone.

me," he said. "Two or three years
in the minors, and then I'll be 22
or 23."
Sprague said he won't be picky
about what team he plays for.
"I'd prefer to stay on the West
Coast, because I've always lived
out here," he said, naming the
A's, Giants, Dodgers, Angels and
Padres as possible candidates.
"But I'd be more than happy if
anybody took me in the first
round.... I'd have to look at what
team needs what."
Sprague usually pitched or
played first base at St. Mary's

High School in Stockton and has
developed into a steady if unspec
tacular third baseman since
taking up that position for the
Cardinal in his freshman year.
Still, many scouts and observers
have him pegged to play catcher
in the pros because of his strong
arm.
"I wouldn't mind [playing
catcher], but I think I can play
third in the pros, too," he said.
"I think you can make it into the
pros more easily as a catcher, be
cause there aren't that many good
catchers around. I've caught a
little bit, but that will be an ad
justment."
Usually, however, when people
talk about Sprague, they don't
talk about his defense — they talk
about his hitting. "Obviously, my
bat is going to determine where
I go in baseball," he said.
Indeed, Sprague's home runs
are dazzling, not so much for their
frequency as for their trajectory.
No wind-aided, aluminum-bat
homers for him — his home runs
are rockets, just like his singles,
but a little higher.
And they are to left field. Pe
riod. Sprague's tendency to pull
the ball is so pronounced, in fact,
that in a Six-Pac series last week
end, California unveiled a new de
fensive shift against him. Golden
Bear second baseman Darryl Vice
moved over to the shortstop side
of second base, and centerfielder
Darren Lewis played in the left
center alley.
"That was the first time I'd
seen that used against me,"
Sprague said. "It's funny — kinda
humors you a little bit. But it
worked.... It screwed me up. . ..
They got me tinkering with my
swing, trying to push the ball over
toward second base."
Sprague will probably continue
to pull the ball even after he
switches over to the heavier
wooden bats used in professional
baseball. Although many baseball
experts say college players are
handicapped in the pros because
they spend three or four years
learning bad habits with alumi
num bats, Sprague isn't worried
about the transition to wood.
"I've swung wood my entire
life," he said. "That's going to be
a fun adjustment for me."
If it seems like Sprague isn't
intimidated by the prospect of
playing in the mtyor leagues,
that's because he isn't. His father,
Ed Sprague Sr., was a big-league
pitcher for the A's, Cincinnati
Reds, St. Louis Cardinals and Mil
waukee Brewers, so Ed Jr. grew
up around professional baseball.
The elder Sprague also owned
a minor league team — the Stock
ton Ports of the Class A California
League — for a few years, and
his son was a batboy for the team.
"I've always been around the
clubhouse," Sprague says. "That
helped me out mentally — I saw
what it takes."
And most observers agree that
the younger Sprague has what it
takes to follow in the footsteps of
his dad and make it in the miyor
leagues.

in the Six-Pac going into the week
end's series with Arizona at Sancet
Field in Tucson, Ariz. The Cardinal,
ranked ninth nationally by Baseball
America and 12th by ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball, is tied with USC for second
in the league, a half game behind
first-place Cal. Arizona is in the
league cellar, with a 25-18 overall
record but a woeful 2-12 record in
the Six-Pac.
In other Six-Pac action this week
end, Cal plays at UCLA and USC
takes on Arizona State in Tempe,
Ariz.
Tonight's game is at 6 p.m. PDT,
as is tomorrow night's. Sunday's
game is at noon. All three games will
be broadcast live by KZSU-90.1 FM,
with the dulcet tones of John "Tor
tilla" Platz and Randy "Going to the"
Chappel carressing the air waves.
Senior Lee Plemel (5-3 with a 4.36
ERA this season) will start tonight
for the Cardinal, which is bad news
for the Wildcats. Plemel has virtually
owned Arizona over the last three
years. His career mark against the
Wildcats is 6-0 with a 1.18 ERA He
has allowed six earned runs in 45.7
innings against Arizona.
Plemel's 277 career strikeouts put
him third on the all-time list at Stan
ford, and leave him only 60 whiffs
short of the school record of 337 set
by Jack McDowell in the 1985, '86
and '87 seasons.
Speaking of McDowell, the lanky
right-hander made his 1988 debut for
the Chicago White Sox on Wednesday.
He went seven innings against the
Angels, giving up only one run on
four hits but getting no decision in a
game the Angels eventually won.
Freshman Mike Mussina (6-1,
3.31) will start tomorrow's game for
Stanford, with fellow freshman Stan
Spencer (4-1, 2.53) going on Sunday.
Arizona Coach Jerry Kindall will
miss tonight's game to attend the fu
neral of his father, who died Tuesday.
It has been a tough year for the well
liked Kindall. His wife, Georgia, died
last June 27 after a lengthy illness.
Sophomore designated hitter Tim
Griffin is batting .387 in 31 at-bata.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen
is leading the regulars in hitting with
a .342 average to go with 11 doubles
and four home runs. Paulsen is riding
a team-high 14-game hitting streak.
The Cardinal's team fielding per
centage of .970 is on pace to break
the school record of .968, set in 1967.
That 1967 squad featured an Ail-
American first baseman named Mark
Marquess.
Stanford has outscored its oppo
nents 46-19 in the first inningß of its
games this year, but has been out
scored 20-8 in ninth innings.
Going into a string of seven straight
Six-Pac road games, the Cardinal is
18-3 at home, but 6-8 on the road.
After getting his first collegiate hit,
relief pitcher Steve Chitren is leading
the team in batting with a 1.000
average.


Richard Murphy — Dally file
Junior Ed Sprague Is an excellent bet to follow In his father's
footsteps and play Major League Baseball. Sprague plays third
base for the Cardinal but may be converted to catcher for the pros.
