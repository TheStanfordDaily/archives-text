# Women's tennis narrowly routs

### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
A tennis match
that is clinched in
the singles nor
mally wouldn't be
considered a close
call, but Stanford's
6-3 victory over

California yesterday at the Stan
ford Tennis Stadium certainly fit
that description.
The drama yesterday centered
around whether Stanford would
be able to overcome a few minor
injuries and illnesses that
emerged just prior to and during
the match with the fifth-ranked
Golden Bears. The No. 2 Cardinal
was up to the task and snapped
a two-match losing streak against
its cross-Bay rival. Stanford
raised its record to 18-1, while
Cal dropped to 15-5.
The Cardinal travels south this
weekend for an 11 a.m. match
tomorrow at San Diego State and
a noon match Sunday at U.S. In
ternational University.
Freshman sensation Tami
Whitlinger, who is fighting the
flu and missed some practice time
this week, was questionable right
up until yesterday morning. "It
was nip and tuck whether she'd
be able to play," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said. "And, of
course, she played great."
As usual, Whitlinger disposed
of her opponent quickly. Yester
day's victim was Cal's Karen
Shin, who got as close as 4-3 in
the first set but then saw Whit
linger string together eight
straight games to close out the
No. 1 singles, 6-3, 6-0.
Cal momentarily knotted the
team score when Tiffany Silveria
blew past Cari Hagey 6-0, 6-2 in
the No. 6 singles, but the Cardinal
took the other four singles con
testa to clinch the team match.
Sophomore Lisa Green led the
way with a 7-5, 6-1 win over the
Bears' Jean Marie Lozano at No.
2 singles. The win improved
Green's dual-match record to 15-
4, a mark that would normally
be considered outstanding. Her
four losses, however, are the most
on the team.
Green said she felt more relaxed
yesterday than she has in recent

matches. "The last couple of
matches I've been kind of up
tight," she said. "Today I just hit
the ball. . . . It's hard when
everybody else (on the team) is
winning, but I have to stay pos
itive."
In the other three singles
matches, Cardinal freshman
Sandra Birch swept by Cal fresh
man Kay Louthian 6-1, 6-4, senior
Kay Tittle rallied for an impres
sive 3-6, 6-2, 6-1 win against
Alissa Finerman, last year's
Pacific 10 Conference singles
runner-up, and freshman Teri
Whitlinger outlasted the Bears'
Jennifer Prah 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
The Whitlinger-Prah match
was a marathon, as Prah stayed
at the baseline and served up a
variety of off-speed shots. Whit
linger had to patiently wait for
openings, and in the meantime
she developed a blood blister on
her foot after taking the opening
set rather easily. The blister be
came more bothersome as the
match progressed, but she was
able to win and improve her per
fect dual-match record to 19-0.
Cal Coach Jan Brogan expected
her team to win more than one
singles match, but she was not
surprised by Stanford's strong
showing. "There was no question
we knew they would be really
awesome," Brogan said.
Stanford lost two of the three
doubles matches, one by default
as Hagey hurt her right shoulder
in the second game of the No. 1
contest.
The Whitlingers almost didn't
take the court for the No. 2 dou
bles, as the condition of Ten's
blister was a concern. They
decided to play and eventually
were upended for the first time
this season in a dual match. Cad's
Lozano and Sharon Fletcher re
corded the upset 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-
4).
Tittle and Green posted the
Cardinal's lone doubles victory,
besting Prah and Louthian 7-5,
6-4. The Stanford tandem is only
7-5 on the season, but Green said
they are steadily improving.
"We're doing better together,"
she said. "Today we both played
well. Usually one of us plays well
and the other doesn't."
