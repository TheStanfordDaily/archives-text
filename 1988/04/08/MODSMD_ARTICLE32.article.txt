# 13th would be unlucky for gymnasts
## 
### Chris Kendrick Staff writer 
Making the
dozen is the
goal of the Stan
ford women's
gymnastics
team in the
NCAA Regional

meet this Saturday in Corval
lis, Oregon. Only the top-12
teams in the country qualify
for the Nationals. Currently,
the Cardinal is ranked 17th in
the nation and is seeded fifth
in its region.
"We need to have the best
meet we've had all year. That's
what regionals are about,"
Stanford Coach Homer Sardina
said.
The gymnasts have quite a
task facing them. The powerful
UCLA Bruins are leading the
regional pack, followed closely
by No. 2 Oregon State, No. 3
Fullerton State and No. 4
Washington. Boise State and
Seattle-Pacific are trailing the
Cardinal.
Stanford needs to move up
five places nationally to be part

of the dozen. Although such a
jump seems nearly impossible
considering the quality of the
competition, Sardina said Stan
ford's top 15 team scores are
in the 185-point range, putting
them in the running to
succeed.
"10th to 17th are separated
by fractions," he said. It all
comes down to this meet. "To
have a chance (to qualify for
the nationals), we've got to
beat Fullerton by a point and
finish over the 186-point
range," Sardina added.
That would be Stanford's
highest team total of the
season. The team's season-high
to date is 185.10, which the
gymnasts tallied in a victory
over Fullerton in February.
The estimated total of 186
points translates into an
average event score of 46.5.
Sophomore Dina Amoroso,
seeded third in this meet,
senior Alison McGann and
junior Jinny Rhee have a good
chance to qualify for the Na
tionals as individual all
arounders even if the team
does not qualify.
