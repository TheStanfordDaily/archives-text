There is no rest for the weary.
After a marathon week of play, the
Stanford men's golf team hosts the
Stanford/Bekins U.S. Intercollegiate
today and Saturday. The 54-hole con
test, which matches the Cardinal
against most of the better Western

schools, will be a good chance for the team to tune
up for the Pacific 10 Conference tournament next
month.
On Monday, while the Stanford golf course was
closed to the public, the golf team, along with other
Bay Area celebrities, played in what Stanford Coach
Wally Goodwin called a "horse race" to raise money
for the Stanford children's hospital and the men's
golf program. Each golfer had solicited pledges per
hole and had to play as many holes as possible
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Most players far exceeded
the 50 holes that Goodwin expected them to play,
with junior Roger Miraglia finishing an amazing
101 holes in the 10-hour period.
The Stanford Golf Course should see more fine
golf this weekend. Arizona, considered the top team
in the west, will compete along with other top
ranked schools such as UCLA, USC, Fresno State
and UC-Santa Barbara.

"The tournament was designed
to give the top 12 teams in the
(Western) district one more
chance to compete against each
other," Goodwin said. This allows
the NCAA to get a good look at
the teams before selecting its
tournament field. Stanford is cur
rently ranked 10th in the Western

district.
Stanford qualifiers Brad
Benbrook, Josh Zander, Don
Christensen, John Mahon, Mark
Funseth and Brad Joondeph
should have their hands full with
the likes of Arizona's Mike
Springer and Illinois' Steve
Strieker. The Stanford team is un
changed from last week's tourney
at Pasatiempo, with the excep
tions of Benbrook and Zander.
Benbrook had been sidelined
earlier in the season with an ill

ness, but he led all qualifiers for
the Stanford tournament, firing
a 145 (72-73) last weekend.
The golf course itself will pres
ent quite a challenge.
For today's 36-hole competi
tion, the greens have been set up
so that the average college golfer
will have no trouble completing
his round.
"Saturday is a different story,"
the coach chuckled, adding that
the course will be almost unsolv
able for the final 18 holes.
