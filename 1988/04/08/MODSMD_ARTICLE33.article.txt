There is no rest for the weary.
After a marathon week of play, the
Stanford men's golf team hosts the
Stanford/Bekins U.S. Intercollegiate
today and Saturday. The 54-hole con
test, which matches the Cardinal
against most of the better Western

schools, will be a good chance for the team to tune
up for the Pacific 10 Conference tournament next
month.
On Monday, while the Stanford golf course was
closed to the public, the golf team, along with other
Bay Area celebrities, played in what Stanford Coach
Wally Goodwin called a "horse race" to raise money
for the Stanford children's hospital and the men's
golf program. Each golfer had solicited pledges per
hole and had to play as many holes as possible
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Most players far exceeded
the 50 holes that Goodwin expected them to play,
with junior Roger Miraglia finishing an amazing
101 holes in the 10-hour period.
The Stanford Golf Course should see more fine
golf this weekend. Arizona, considered the top team
in the west, will compete along with other top
ranked schools such as UCLA, USC, Fresno State
and UC-Santa Barbara.
