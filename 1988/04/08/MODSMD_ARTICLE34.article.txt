# Volleyball learns rules of Hawaii â€” and loses
## 
### Cameron Macky Staff writer 
When traveling to the Uni
versity of Hawaii to play vol
leyball, there are two rules
to follow: (1) Take lots of
suntan lotion, and (2) Don't
expect to win a heck of a
lot of games.

The Stanford men's volleyball team,
which Monday came within two points of
upsetting the No. 3 Rainbows, became ex
tremely aware of the second rule Wednes
day night as it bowed to the 'Bows, 15-7,
15-11, 15-6. Hawaii, now 19-3 (11-2 in the
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion) remains unbeaten at home this year.
"They're a real tough team at home,"
Stanford Coach Fred Sturm said. "We
didn't execute very well, and Hawaii played
a great match. That pretty much sums it
up."
With the loss, Stanford falls to 10-17
(4-11) and has now dropped seven matches
in a row. The team will return to league

play April 16 at home against Pepperdine.
In contrast to Monday night, when the
Cardinal combined excellent hitting and
gutty defense to mount its upset bid, the
Stanford offense never got rolling Wednes
day, as Hawaii outhit the Cardinal spikers
.288 to .142. Stanford sophomore outside
hitter Craig Forsyth was the lone bright
spot on offense, tallying 11 kills and a
sterling .444 hitting mark.
Sophomore middle blocker Dan Hanan,
whose 32 kills Monday were a career high,
added eight kills to place second on the
team, but was held to a .125 hitting per
centage by the Hawaii defenders. Hanan
also had a team-high eight digs.
Hawaii was once again led by junior out
side hitter Allen "No, it's not a typo" Allen,
who scored a match-high 12 kills and 10
digs while hitting .385.
During their week off, the Cardinal
spikers will compete in the fifth Varsity-
Alumni Tournament tomorrow at Maples
Pavilion. Between 25 and 35 Stanford
alumni will be on hand for the event, which
begins at 1 p.m.
