# Netters tangle with 'Cats, Devils

No longer are the Ar
izona schools push
overs. Not exactly
household names in
collegiate tennis, Ari
zona and Arizona State
in particular have

made waves this season against top
flight competition.
Arizona extended the Stanford
men's tennis team to three sets in
five of six singles matches in a loss
to the Cardinal March 25, while ASU
has upset No. 2 USC, Clemson and
South Carolina on its way to a sur
prising No. 10 national ranking.
But Arizona State Coach Lou
Belken harbors no illusions about his
squad's chances against the Stanford
men's tennis team.
"Stanford has the best team in the
country," Belken said. "They may not
be ranked No. 1, but they have all

the names in the strongest lineup in
the nation."
In the final weekend homestand of
the season, the third-rated Cardinal,
15-1, looks to stomp out Arizona today
at 1:30 p.m. and the Sun Devils to
morrow at 1 p.m. at Stanford Tennis
Stadium. The Wildcats are 11-10 (0-7
in the Pacific 10 Conference). ASU
checks in at 17-6 (3-4 in conference
play).
Arizona looks to be the easier of
the two Stanford foes. After having
overlooked the Wildcats in Tucson and
having played sluggishly against Cal
ifornia on Tuesday, Stanford is
looking to raise its quality of play a
notch today in preparation for the
UCLA and USC matches next week
end.
"I wouldn't look past Arizona for a
second," Stanford Coach Dick Gould
said. "We have to keep improving.
Right now, we're not even fit to walk
out on the court at UCLA and USC."
Tomorrow's contest should provide

a stern test for the Cardinal. Led by
Doug Sachs and Ken Kuperstein at
No. 1 and No. 2 singles, the Sun
Devils sport a solid lineup at every
position. Mike Holten and Bryan
Gyetko are the No. 3 doubles tandem
in the nation.
"For us, it's a really fun match,"
Belken said. "We enjoy being the un
derdog. We showed at our place that
we are competitive with Stanford;
that's the attitude we bring to this
match."
What attitude is Stanford bringing
to the match?
"We are ready to go," freshman
Martin Blackman said. "If everyone
plays well, we should win in singles.
I don't think anyone will under
stimate them this time around."
Matches to watch include the top
two singles contests and the No. 1
doubles match. Freshman David
Wheaton and sophomore Jeff Tarango
bested Holten and Gyetko 6-3, 6-1 the
last time the two teams met.
