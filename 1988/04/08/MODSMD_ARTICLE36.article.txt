# Track splits for Austin, Fresno
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
One key to victory in tr«ck is to have
successful splits. That's what Stan
ford track and field hopes to have
this weekend.
After completing a successful series
of three home track meets, the Car
dinal takes on the best today and

tomorrow at the Texas Relays in Austin, while a
split squad races at the Fresno Relays tomorrow.
The main contest at Texas is the men's distance
relays. The Cardinal, coming off a distance medley
win at the Stanford Holiday Inn Invitational in a
school record time of 9 minutes, 32.85 seconds, will
face the top guns in the country, as track power
houses Arkansas and Villinova are expected to be
among the 50 teams at Austin.
Stanford will be running a young group, with
freshmen James Cramton going 400 meters (one
lap) and David Strang running three laps. Sopho
more Bill Crowley will go a half-mile, and fifth-year
senior Marc Oleson will run the final mile as Stan
ford aims to recapture the event they won in 1986
but lost last year.
Recent NCAA-Championship qualifier David Pick
ett, a senior, will compete in the men's javelin in
Austin, while John Gash, also a senior, will be

looking to add a few inches to his best pole vault
of the season and qualify for the NCAA meet.
The Cardinal will also be seeking Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship qualifiers in the field events,
including freshman John Hopkins in the high jump
and sophomore Andy Papathanassiou in the shot
put. Two competitors, Henry Green (long jump)
and Brian Boggess (shot put) made Pac-10 marks
during Stanford's home series and will be aiming
for the NCAA marks.
Meanwhile, Stanford Asst. Coach Scott Chism
takes most of the sprinters and women throwers
to Fresno City College tomorrow. Tops among them
will be shot-putters Patty Purpur and Morgyn
Warner, both juniors, and freshman Debbie Malueg.
They are threats to sweep the event, as they did
at the Athletes Equity Challenge last weekend.
In the women's sprints, junior Tess Adams, fresh
man Alysia Hubbard and sophomore Cheryl Gray
will represent the Cardinal at Fresno. Sophomore
Venessa Henlon, who is the new holder of the school
triple-jump record, will also stick close to home.
One of the notable entries this weekend is Carol
Gray and the women's distance team. Gray was
recognized as a Pac-10 athlete of the week for her
performance last weekend, when the sophomore
beat the NCAA time in a convincing 3,000-meters
win.
