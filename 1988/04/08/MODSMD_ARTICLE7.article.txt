# Nader berates apathy
## Students should "work for the world" 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Leading consumer activist Ralph Nader
told a half-capacity Kresge auditorium
crowd yesterday that students should "get
out of the rut of Stanford's idyllic world"
and take an active part in civic life by
using the energy and idealism of youth.
Disappointed with what he saw as a small
crowd, Nader complained that students are
more preoccupied with sunny weather than
contemporary problems. Nader said his last
visit — in 1985 — drew a capacity crowd.
This year Nader spoke at 2 p.m.
Nader criticized the apathy at "elite"
universities — using Stanford as an exam
ple — and said that students are too pam

pered in college settings that emphasize
academic and monetary success.
"Students are climbing a track of success
here to get into graduate schools and then
to get good jobs to get rich. . . . You pursue
means to means to means," Nader said.
"When you're young, break away from it
and propel out of success. There's nothing
at the top. So work for something other
than money. Work for the world."
According to Nader, a college campus
setting is conducive to public service. He
cited enormous informational resources —
internal publications, the ability to freely
exchange ideas within the university com
munity and student idealism — as assets
which must be applied to solving
the "big problems which nobody
seems to care about."
Nader gave examples of success
ful student activism in issues such
as environment, civil rights and
the Vietnam war where "changes
would not have been possible
without the energy and courage
of the students."
But now there are latent fears
and unhappiness in campus life,
Nader said. "Students are bored,
because there's no entailed pur
pose to knowledge, no application
of knowledge. It's debilitating," he
said.
Nader suggested combining col
lege studies with public service,
and applying political, scientific
and economic theories to services
such as helping the poor and im
proving the environment.
Nader said the recent trend in
decreased college activism seems
to be a "wave" of concern brought
up for one issue and then
"dropped when the students get

bored with it and decide that
soaking up the sun is better."
He criticized students for giving
too much attention to issues of
race and gender and overlooking
problems such as depletion of the

ozone layer and nuclear build-up.
Nader blamed students for a
widespread lack of appreciation of
their rights.
"Get rid of that. Take advan
tage of the freedom," he added.
