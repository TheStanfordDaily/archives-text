# Nader berates apathy
## Students should "work for the world"

Leading consumer activist Ralph Nader
told a half-capacity Kresge auditorium
crowd yesterday that students should "get
out of the rut of Stanford's idyllic world"
and take an active part in civic life by
using the energy and idealism of youth.
Disappointed with what he saw as a small
crowd, Nader complained that students are
more preoccupied with sunny weather than
contemporary problems. Nader said his last
visit — in 1985 — drew a capacity crowd.
This year Nader spoke at 2 p.m.

universities — using Stanford as an exam

academic and monetary success.
"Students are climbing a track of success
here to get into graduate schools and then
to get good jobs to get rich. . . . You pursue
means to means to means," Nader said.
"When you're young, break away from it
and propel out of success. There's nothing
at the top. So work for something other
than money. Work for the world."
According to Nader, a college campus

exchange ideas within the university com
