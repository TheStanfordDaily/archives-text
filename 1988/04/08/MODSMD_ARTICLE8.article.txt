# Students visit Nicaragua, speak with local leaders
## 
### Eric Richardson 
During what could prove to be one of
the most pivotal weeks in the history of
Nicaragua, a group of 20 Stanford students
and staff members traveled to that war
torn, poverty-stricken nation over spring
break.
As the group left San Francisco bound
for the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on
March 17, 3,200 U.S. troops also headed
for Central America, prepared to support
Honduran and Contra forces reportedly
threatened by a Nicaraguan invasion of
Honduran territory. Before the group
returned March 29, Contra and Sandinista
rulers began cease-fire talks in an effort

to end Nicaragua's eight-year civil war.
Sponsored by the Palo Alto-based Syn
ergy Foundation, a non-profit organization
not connected with the campus residence,
the trip allowed students to meet with
leaders of Nicaraguan government agen
cies, opposition parties, business groups,
labor unions and a U.S embassy represen
tative. In addition, the students spent four
days living with families and working in
barrios outside Managua to "put a human
face" on life in Central America.
Sophomore Steve Levitsky said the
"reality of the war" became apparent im
mediately after the group's arrival. En
route to their Managua hotel, the
group's Nicaraguan guide in
formed them that he might not
be able to continue as their leader
the next day. He explained that
Nicaragua was on a state of alert
preparing for a possible U.S. in
vasion and he might be needed
to fight.
Senior Karen Peterson said she
was "scared" and "panicked"
about the introduction of U.S.
troops into the region, although
the Stanford group never got
nearer than one-and-a-half hours
by car from the area of fighting
along the border. "But we realized
that the Nicaraguans have to live
in it," she added.
"It's nothing new for them,"
said senior Lea Schuster. "They
are under constant threat of in
vasion."
Sophomore Amy Nellis said the
"effects of war" were clearly
visible throughout the area where
the Stanford group traveled and
cited bullet holes which dot many
of the Managua buildings as
evidence of those effects.
Levitsky said economic drain
caused by the war left obvious
shortages of goods, ranging from
food to medical supplies. One
third of the group spent focr days

working in an area housing refu
gee soldiers of the El Salvadoren
Farabundo Marti National Liber
ation Front opposition group,
many of whom had lost limbs in
the civil war in that neighboring
nation.
In contrast to the horror that
the group felt seeing evidence of
war, the students said Nicara
guans were "optimistic" about the
peace talks, which began in the
city of Sopoa during the second
week of their visit.
Levitsky and other Stanford
students attended an all-night
vigil held the night before peace
talks began in which Nicaraguans
lined the 200-kilometer road
stretching from Managua to
Sopoa to show their support for
peace.
Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega and American peace activ
ist Bryan Wilson — who lost his
legs last September when a mili
tary train ran over him in Con
cord, Calif., while he protested
U.S. arms shipments to the Con
tras — attended the rally.
Levitsky said Ortega walked
through the crowd with so little
security that Levitsky "could have
stabbed him" had he been so in
clined. At the same time, Ortega's
wife danced to reggae music,
which soon turned the vigil into
a party.
Schuster said many of the stu
dents went to Nicaragua "with a

pretty rosy picture, thinking
everyone loves the Sandinistas"
but found that to be untrue.
"They have been at war for
eight years and a lot of the people
are upset about the shortages of
food. . . . The Sandinistas also
seem to have hegemony over the
mass media, which is pretty bad.
But it's still none of the United
States' business," he said.

'It's nothing new
for them. They are
under constant
threat of invasion.'

The students expressed amaze
ment at the minimal amount of
anti-Americanism the group en
countered. "Before we left for Nic
aragua, I was skeptical that the
Nicaraguan people could be
friendly and generous to us," Nel
lis said. "But they were so nice
to us. I felt a lot of shame that
they had to look at me as separate
from my government."
Schuster said the death of
young Nicaraguans made the big
gest impression on her. "I met a

22-year-old soldier who had been
in mandatory military service
since he was 17. By the time he
was 22, he had lost 45 friends
from his graduating class who had
been killed in the war," she said.
Similarly, Peterson attended a
Palm Sunday service where rela
tives shouted out names of family
members who had been killed in
the war. She said there was not
enough time during the service
to mention all of the victims.
Now that they have returned,
many of the students said they
plan to remain active in progres
sive Central American politics.
"The trip really lit a fire and
motivated me," said senior Mike
Meuter. "Now I want to come
back and tell everyone I see what
it is really like down there. I could
write a thousand letters to
Congress telling them to stop
Contra aid."
"You can't understand without
being there," Levitsky concluded.
"We just have to stop the war.
There are too many people dying."
The trip was organized by Steve
Babb and Magdalena Fittoria, two
staff members of the Public Serv
ice Center. The pair helped locate
the Synergy Foundation, which
helped students raise money to
fund the trip.
According to Levitsky each stu
dent paid "what they could" and
the rest was raised through
various projects.

that the Nicaraguans have to live
in it," she added.
"It's nothing new for them,"
said senior Lea Schuster. "They
are under constant threat of in
vasion."
Sophomore Amy Nellis said the
"effects of war" were clearly
visible throughout the area where
the Stanford group traveled and
cited bullet holes which dot many

evidence of those effects.
Levitsky said economic drain
caused by the war left obvious
shortages of goods, ranging from
food to medical supplies. One

In contrast to the horror that
the group felt seeing evidence of
war, the students said Nicara
guans were "optimistic" about the
peace talks, which began in the
city of Sopoa during the second
week of their visit.
Levitsky and other Stanford
students attended an all-night
vigil held the night before peace
talks began in which Nicaraguans
lined the 200-kilometer road
stretching from Managua to
Sopoa to show their support for
peace.
Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega and American peace activ
ist Bryan Wilson — who lost his
legs last September when a mili
tary train ran over him in Con
cord, Calif., while he protested
U.S. arms shipments to the Con

Levitsky said Ortega walked
through the crowd with so little
security that Levitsky "could have
stabbed him" had he been so in
clined. At the same time, Ortega's
wife danced to reggae music,
which soon turned the vigil into
a party.
Schuster said many of the stu
dents went to Nicaragua "with a

pretty rosy picture, thinking
everyone loves the Sandinistas"
but found that to be untrue.
"They have been at war for
eight years and a lot of the people
are upset about the shortages of
food. . . . The Sandinistas also
seem to have hegemony over the
mass media, which is pretty bad.
But it's still none of the United
States' business," he said.

'It's nothing new
for them. They are
under constant
threat of invasion.'

The students expressed amaze
ment at the minimal amount of
anti-Americanism the group en
countered. "Before we left for Nic
aragua, I was skeptical that the
Nicaraguan people could be
friendly and generous to us," Nel
lis said. "But they were so nice
to us. I felt a lot of shame that
they had to look at me as separate
from my government."
Schuster said the death of
young Nicaraguans made the big
gest impression on her. "I met a

22-year-old soldier who had been
in mandatory military service
since he was 17. By the time he
was 22, he had lost 45 friends
from his graduating class who had
been killed in the war," she said.
Similarly, Peterson attended a
Palm Sunday service where rela
tives shouted out names of family
members who had been killed in
the war. She said there was not
enough time during the service
to mention all of the victims.
Now that they have returned,
many of the students said they
plan to remain active in progres
sive Central American politics.
"The trip really lit a fire and
motivated me," said senior Mike
Meuter. "Now I want to come
back and tell everyone I see what
it is really like down there. I could
write a thousand letters to
Congress telling them to stop
Contra aid."
"You can't understand without
being there," Levitsky concluded.
"We just have to stop the war.
There are too many people dying."
The trip was organized by Steve
Babb and Magdalena Fittoria, two
staff members of the Public Serv
ice Center. The pair helped locate
the Synergy Foundation, which
helped students raise money to
fund the trip.
According to Levitsky each stu
dent paid "what they could" and
the rest was raised through
various projects.
During what could prove to be one of
the most pivotal weeks in the history of
Nicaragua, a group of 20 Stanford students
and staff members traveled to that war
torn, poverty-stricken nation over spring
break.
As the group left San Francisco bound
for the Nicaraguan capital of Managua on
March 17, 3,200 U.S. troops also headed
for Central America, prepared to support
Honduran and Contra forces reportedly
threatened by a Nicaraguan invasion of
Honduran territory. Before the group
returned March 29, Contra and Sandinista
rulers began cease-fire talks in an effort

to end Nicaragua's eight-year civil war.
Sponsored by the Palo Alto-based Syn
ergy Foundation, a non-profit organization
not connected with the campus residence,
the trip allowed students to meet with
leaders of Nicaraguan government agen
cies, opposition parties, business groups,
labor unions and a U.S embassy represen
tative. In addition, the students spent four
days living with families and working in
barrios outside Managua to "put a human
face" on life in Central America.
Sophomore Steve Levitsky said the
"reality of the war" became apparent im
mediately after the group's arrival. En
route to their Managua hotel, the
group's Nicaraguan guide in
formed them that he might not
be able to continue as their leader
the next day. He explained that
Nicaragua was on a state of alert
preparing for a possible U.S. in
vasion and he might be needed
to fight.
Senior Karen Peterson said she
was "scared" and "panicked"
about the introduction of U.S.
troops into the region, although
the Stanford group never got
nearer than one-and-a-half hours
by car from the area of fighting
along the border. "But we realized
that the Nicaraguans have to live
in it," she added.
"It's nothing new for them,"
said senior Lea Schuster. "They
