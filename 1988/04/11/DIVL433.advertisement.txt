for your
Career
Trimble Navigation, Ltd., is looking for hardware and software
engineers with a BS or MS in EE. These engineers would be part
of a small two-three person team working on next generation
products and technologies.
Since we provide solutions to customers' problems, we expect
the engineer to become familiar with the customers and their
applications of our products to solve their problems.
Software Engineers
We have needs for engineers with knowledge of either user
interface or signal processing software. These programs are
written in both "C" and Pascal, and run on microprocessors like
6809's or 68000's. These challenging applications require both
teamwork and creativity.
Hardware Engineers
For hardware engineers, we seek expertise in both digital and
RF hardware.
■ Digital design experience with microprocessor-based
systems is needed that will eventually be integrated into
large CMOS gate arrays.
■ In the RF area, we need a creative solution for next genera
tion satellite receivers that include mixers, IF's, low noise
preamps and oscillators.
If you have expertise in any of these areas, and would like to
work in a fast growing, small company environment, we can
offer you a challenging opportunity with a hard working team
where your contribution will be recognized and rewarded.
We will be on your campus Wednesday, April 13, 1988. Please
sign up in the Career Planning Center. If you miss us, please
send a letter of interest to: TRIMBLE NAVIGATION, P.O. Box
3642, Sunnyvale, CA 94088-3642. An equal opportunity
employer.
