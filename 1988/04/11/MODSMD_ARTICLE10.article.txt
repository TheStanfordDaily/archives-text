## Senate candidate pool expands 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
Campaigning on
promises ranging
from lighted tennis
courts to the ex
pansion of Lake
Lagunita's beach,
almost 50 candi-

dates are frantically posting cam
paign fliers all across campus in
anticipation of this week's ASSU
elections.
Forty-eight undergraduate can
didates are running for 10 voting
and 10 non-voting positions on
the senate, as compared to last
year's elections, when only 33 un
dergraduates ran.
Noting the increased number
of candidates in this year's elec
tions, current Senate Chair David
Smolen, a senior, speculated that
students' opinions of the senate
have improved over recent years.
Smolen, a senior, said this
might be because the ASSU has
been "doing a better job" than in
the past.
As usual, many of the candi
dates are freshmen; this year

there are 21. "Freshmen are the
most enthusiastic about being
here," said ASSU senator Brett
Mahoney, a senior. Smolen also
said the Senate Associate program
and the senate's publicity cam
paigns in freshman dorms have
encouraged many freshmen to
run.
According to Smolen, both
serious and flippant campaign
techniques are effective, but stu
dents who post serious fliers are
usually the top vote-getters.
However, candidates "tap into
something when (they) are ir
reverent. It's the Stanford style,"
Smolen acknowledged. In this
vein, Smolen recalled the success
ful campaign last year of a football
player who advocated more snow
days and more fudgesicles in
dining halls.
Mahoney said the most effective
fliers give candidates "an identi
ty" and associate them with an
idea or a particular stance on an
issue.
For this reason, Smolen and
Mahoney said they support stu

dent political groups such as the
People's Platform, which last year
nominated eight winning candi
dates, according to Smolen.
The People's Platform, a coali
tion made up largely of minority
student groups, supports candi
dates sympathetic to minority stu
dent needs.
"The best way to campaign is
through student groups," Smolen
said.
Some candidates are wary of
the the Platform's large number
of endorsements. For example,
freshman Brian Fagel and soph
omore Jeff Resnick, both candi
dates, said having 10 candidates
run from this group is too many.
Fagel said a victory by this
many people from one organiza
tion may create "special interest
groups" in the ASSU, which he
said have lessened the senate's
legitimacy in the past. He cited
last year's senate grape boycott,
which the administration refused
to acknowledge because it said the
senate didn't represent the stu
dent body.
However, freshman Duru
Ahanotu, a People's Platform can
didate, said this criticism is un
founded. "In order for the
People's Platform to achieve its

goals, we need as many members
of it on the senate as we can,"
he said. "If the student body
agrees with us, they will vote for
all 10."
While interest has increased in
undergraduate senate elections,
this year is no different from past
years when the ASSU has suf
fered from a lack of interest
among graduate students.
Former graduate ASSU senator
Michael Gaulard, a graduate stu
dent in computer science, attrib
uted this shortage to graduate
students' busy schedules.
Smolen speculated that many
graduate students are not at Stan
ford long enough to become in
volved in student life.
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Steve Baer, a senior, said the
shortfall in graduate candidates
will be resolved by write-in can
didacies.
Sixteen graduate students are
running to fill the 20 posts al
lotted them. Four positions are
open for candidates from the
School of Engineering, three from
the Schools of Law, Business, and
Medicine, and three from the
Schools of Humanities, Sciences,
and Earth Sciences and an equal
proportion are elected as non
voting alternates.
Graduate and undergraduate
alternates attend every senate
meeting and sometimes vote for
voting senators who are absent.
