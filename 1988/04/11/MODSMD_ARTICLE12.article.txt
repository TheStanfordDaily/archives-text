# Feminist journal 'dawns again'
## Aurora set to reappear in May after one-year absence 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
After a one-year hiatus, the feminist
literary journal Aurora is again poised
to publish opinions on women's issues
for the Stanford community.
Aurora's revival is largely because of
the work of Council of Presidents mem
ber Maria Canas, who said she decided
to bring the journal back because the
campus needs a feminist voice. Canas
said she was concerned about what she
saw as the lack of communication be
tween women's groups on campus.
Aurora is intended to help combat
the "stereotype of the women's move
ment." This year's first issue is sched
uled to arrive on campus May 12. Many
people, Canas said, believe feminism
deals solely with white, upper-middle
class women.
"A lot of people are scared by the
term feminism," she said. Aurora staff
member Theresa Chan agreed. There
may be some resistance to the journal,
Chan said, because the word feminist
"tends to alienate some people."
According to Canas, people need to
understand" "there are several different
definitions of feminism."
Noting that apathy was at least partly
responsible for the collapse of Aurora
a year ago, Canas said she sometimes
observed the same kind of indifference
when she told other students she was

restarting the journal.
According to Canas, some people she
talked with thought the idea was "cute"
or would ask "if it was just a women's
fashion magazine or a militant, lesbian
magazine."
The format of the revived Aurora will
be a "collage of what [the journal's staff
and contributors] think of feminism,"

Carias said.
Though people have sharply differing
opinions about feminism, Canas said
she thought this would lead to few prob
lems in publication. Chan, however, said
such differences did "bring up conflict
at meetings." Both stressed that the
main purpose of the new Aurora will
be to provide an open forum to impress
the importance of women's issues upon
the Stanford community.
A statement of purpose drawn up for
the new Aurora promises to accept con
tributions from both men and women
of any sexual preference and race.
Canas said she hoped readers of both
sexes would read the journal with "open
minds." Chan said she hoped that males
who are not involved in feminist pro
grams would "pick it up because they
are interested."
The format of the new journal will
differ from the old version, which began
publishing in the fall of 1977 with a
staff of eight Stanford women.
Like its predecessor, the new Aurora
will be published quarterly, but it will
not feature news stories, as did its
predecessor. Rather, each edition will
carry poems, essays, short stories and
possibly a calendar of campus events of
particular concern to women.
The new journal is being supported
financially by the Feminist Studies Pro
gram, the Women's Center and the Of
fice of Residential Education.
