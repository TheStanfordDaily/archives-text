MOSCOW — Soviet General Secre
tary Mikhail Gorbachev haa urged Pal
estinian leader Yasser Arafat to rec
ognize Israel's right to exist as an
important step in achieving peace in
the Middle East, the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda reported yesterday.
"The Palestinians are a people with
a difficult fate," Gorbachev told Arafat
during a meeting here Saturday,
Pravda said. "But they receive broad
international support, and this is the
guarantee for resolving the main ques
tion for the Palestinians — self
determination.
"In the same way, recognition of
the state of Israel, consideration of its
security interests, the solution of this
question is a necessary element for
the establishment of peace and good
neighborliness in the region based on
principles of international law."
Diplomats here said Gorbachev's
remarks represent a further evolution
in the Soviet Union's position on the
Middle East, showing greater
flexibility toward Israel and a desire
to steer the Palestinian leadership
away from armed struggle and toward
a negotiated settlement.

Gorbachev said that the Soviet Un
ion would prefer a settlement in the
region that included the withdrawal
of Israeli troops from the territories
occupied after the 1967 war, Palestin
ian self-determination and a United
Nations-sponsored peace conference.
Although the Soviet Union itself has
not had diplomatic ties with Israel
since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, infor
mal exploratory meetings between the
two countries have taken place since
Gorbachev came to power.
Last summer a Soviet consular del
egation headed by Yevgeny Antipov,
deputy director of the Foreign Mini
stry's consular department, traveled
to Israel.
Soviet officials have said that an
Israeli delegation will visit the Soviet
Union in the near future, and many
analysts here believe that the two
countries could soon restore normal
diplomatic ties.
Ever since the violence began in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip last
December, the official Soviet press has
consistently and harshly denounced Is
rael for its tactics in attempting to
quell the uprising. But Gorbachev's

comments this weekend showed a
more conciliatory posture.
"Gorbachev's remarks to Arafat
reflect more of what he calls 'the new
political thinking,' " one diplomat said.
"In a way, it's like Afghanistan. Noth
ing got done until the Soviet Union
and the Americans sat down to work.
Gorbachev is also very interested in
resolving regional conflicts that could
aggravate U.S.-Soviet relations."
One diplomat who knows the Middle
East region well said that Arafat
should gain politically within the
Palestine Liberation Organization
after his meetings with Gorbachev.
The Soviet Union has long been a
principal' supporter of the PLO. Gor
bachev's admonition to recognize Is
rael's right to exist could exacerbate
a political split between Arafat, who
seeks a negotiated settlement with Is
rael, and more radical PLO leaders
who reject negotiations and advocate
continued armed struggle.
However, many of the more radical
groups — most notably the Marxist
Democratic Front for the Liberation
of Palestine and the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine — are

even more closely aligned with Moscow
than Arafat. It remained unclear how
those groups would react to Gorba
chev's statement.
Previously Gorbachev told Syrian
President Hafez Assad that it was "ab
normal" for Syria not to have relations
with Israel.
The official Soviet news agency Tass
quoted Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze as saying at a
Kremlin dinner Saturday, "The Pal
estinian people, which is one of the
main parties to the Middle East con
flict, must be ensured the right to
self-determination in the same mea
sure as it was ensured to the people
of Israel."
Arafat told a news conference here
that 280 Palestinians had been killed
in the violence in the occupied ter
ritories over the past five months.
Exact figures are unavailable, but
hospitals and independent relief agen
cies in the occupied territories say that
at least 131 Palestinians and two Is
raelis have been killed in violence
related to the uprising.
