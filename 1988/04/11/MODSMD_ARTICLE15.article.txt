# Dispute heats up over death of Israeli girl in West Bank
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — A military investi
gation into the death of an Israeli teen
ager in a West Bank village last week
became the focus of its own political
controversy here yesterday as Jewish
settlers accused the army of trying to
shift blame off the Arabs and a right
wing member of Parliament called for
the dismissal of the country's top soldier.
Recriminations flared as young
friends who had been in the village of
Beita with the teen-age girl gave a
sharply different version of events than
have previously been reported. They
spoke during meetings yesterday with
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and fel
low Cabinet ministers from his rightist
Likud Bloc, then later with the press.
Separately, Cabinet ministers heard
an interim report on the incident at
their weekly meeting yesterday from
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the
army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shom
ron. Afterward, Shamir said that he
would make no statement on the affair
until a final report was given to the
government later this week.
And Israeli President Chaim Herzog
warned during a tour of the north that
attempts to drag the army into the po
litical debate surrounding the incident
were dangerous for the country.
At issue is a clash last Wednesday
involving hundreds of Arab villagers
from Beita, 16 teen-age hikers mostly
from the West Bank Jewish settlement
of Elon Moreh, and two Israeli security
guards from the same settlement. Two
Palestinians were shot to death in the
incident, and it was initially reported
that 15-year-old Tirza Porat died by
stoning.

Later, senior government officials con
firmed that a pathological examination
showed that the girl had been shot in
the head. She was the first Israeli civil
ian killed in the four-month-old Arab
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, during which at least 135 Pales
tinians and an Israeli soldier have also
been killed.
Through the end of last week, the
Israeli media carried conflicting versions
of the cause of the girl's death and of
the circumstances leading up to it. The
situation was doubly hard to clarify be
cause government offices were closed in
observance of the Jewish feast of Pass
over. During the week, Shomron gave
two controversial interviews apparently
designed in part to head off possible
retaliatory attacks against Arabs by the
settlers.
According to the interim report pre
sented to Cabinet ministers by Rabin
and Shomron yesterday, the girl died
not from a stone but from the gunshot
wound, Cabinet sources confirmed. It is
believed, they added, that the fatal bullet
was fired from an M-16 assault rifle
carried by one of the two Israeli guards
accompanying the group. The bullet was
never found, they said, but pathological
evidence indicates that the fatal wound
was caused by an M-16 round.
The Cabinet sources said that it was
still unclear who fired the fatal shot.
A prominent Jewish settlement leader
and a number of Tirza's fellow hikers
challenged the army's preliminary ac
count yesterday, however, and charged
that investigators had yet to take full
statements from the teen-agers involved.
