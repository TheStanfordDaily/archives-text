# Explosion kills 76
## Pakistan munitions dump blows up 
### 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â€” An
enormous explosion at an army
ammunition dump left more than
76 people dead and 850 injured
yesterday and showered the
Pakistani capital and its sister city
of Rawalpindi with hundreds of
missiles and artillery shells.
Panic swept through the capital
region as huge explosions shook
the area for more than an hour
and shells landed near houses,
schools and embassies, some of
them as much as eight miles from
the ammunition dump. The toll
is expected to rise since the initial
figures are believed not to include
any from the hundreds of troops
inside the camp.
Close to the site of the explo
sion, the scene was one of devas
tation, as if a battle had
been fought. Streets and fields
were littered with thousands of
pieces of ordnance, houses and
buildings were destroyed, and
bodies of humans and livestock
lay untended as emergency per
sonnel struggled to cope with the
hundreds of casualties.
An official statement said the
explosions began when soldiers
loading a truck could not contain
a fire that broke out at the Ojhari
camp, located between Islamabad
and Rawalpindi. Officials said the
camp is used to supply defense
needs for the capital region. But
there were suggestions and some
evidence that the camp was being
used to funnel supplies to the
mujaheddin, the guerrillas bat
tling Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
Three sources familiar with the

massive supply operation for the
Afghan resistance said they either
had heard that Ojhari camp was
one transit point for arms and
ammunition headed for the Af
ghan border region or could not
rule out that possibility. Many of
the thousands of shell casings
that littered the area around the
camp were munitions known to
be used by the resistance. A large
number of trucks, some even
bearing Afgfhan and Peshawar
area licence plates, were destroyed
by the explosions inside the camp
perimeter. The same types of
trucks are widely believed to be
used to ferry munitions to the
Afghan guerrilla forces.
U.S. and Pakistani officials
refused to comment on the supply
operation for the Afghan guerrilla
forces. "It is something we would
not even speculate on," one U.S.
official said yesterday.
If the huge amounts of ammu
nition that exploded yesterday
had been earmarked for the Af
ghan guerrillas, however, its loss
would appear to be a significant
blow as the resistance and the
Soviet-backed Kabul regime
prepare for what is expected to
be a mayor test of strength fol
lowing the anticipated withdrawal
of Soviet forces under an accord
expected to be signed in Geneva
this week.
Pakistani Prime Minister
Mohammed Khan Junejo imme
diately ordered an investigation
into the cause of the explosion.
