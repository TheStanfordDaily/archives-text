Shi-ite hijackers demand fuel
LARNACA, Cyprus — The hijackers holding
a Kuwaiti jumbo jet at Larnaca airport threat
ened yesterday to kill their remaining hostages
in a "slow and quiet massacre" unless author
ities agreed to refuel their plane.
Later, they postponed the threat but said
that they had "hurt" one hostage — in what
manner and how badly was not clear — in
reprisal for the Cypriot government's refusal
to refuel the plane, which landed in Larnaca
Friday after spending three days on the ground
in Iran.
The terrorists, who yesterday tortured and
killed one hostage, a Kuwaiti security guard
whose body they then dumped onto the run
way, also said at one point that they next
planned to fly the Kuwait Airways jetliner to
Kuwait and crash it into the palace of Kuwait's
ruler, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah.
The hijackers, who are believed to be
Lebanese Shia Moslems, are seeking the
release of 17 fellow Shias imprisoned in Kuwait
for a number of terrorist offenses, including
the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French
embassies.
Kuwait, which resisted similar pressure for
the release of the 17 when one of its airliners
was hyacked in 1984, has rejected the de
mands, and a government press representative
reaffirmed yesterday that Kuwait would not
negotiate with the terrorists.
However, after daylong negotiations be
tween the terrorists and a representative of
the Palestine Liberation Organization who was
brought into the talks Saturday, a Cypriot
government representative told reporters that
he hoped to have some "good? news to an
nounce soon.
Afghan rebels down airliner
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Anti-communist
mujahedeen shot down a Soviet-built airliner
yesterday on a flight along Afghanistan's bor
der with the Soviet Union, killing 23 pas
sengers and six crew members, according to
reports from Kabul radio in the Afghan capital.
The broadcast did not indicate whether it
was a civilian or military flight. The aircraft
involved, an AN-26 two-engine turboprop, is
used by both the Soviet and Afghan airlines
as well as their air forces.
The attack, which Kabul charged was carried
out by "extremist elements " was particularly
significant for its location. The broadcast said
that the plane was en route from Maimana,
capital of Faryab province in Afghanistan's
extreme northwest corner, to Mazar-l-Sharif,
the chief city of northern Afghanistan. Mazr
1-Sharif lies 38 miles from the main Soviet
border crossing of Termez.
Some analysts predict that the Soviets, com
mitted to withdrawing all forces from Afghan
istan starting May 15, may try to maintain a
pro-Soviet regime in the northern sector even
if the rest of the country falls to the Islamic
guerrilla forces. The reported attack suggests
a strong mujahedeen presence even in that
favored sector.
There was no immediate comment from
headquarters of the seven mayor mujahedeen
groups at Peshawar, in Pakistan near the Af
ghan border.
