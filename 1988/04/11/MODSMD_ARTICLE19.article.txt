## Vote 'New Slate' 
### 
BECAUSE we believe that one
group offers a forceful,
unified, effective voice to
work for change in the bureaucracy
of the ASSU and throughout the
campus, The Daily endorses A New
Slate of Mind for Council of Presi
dents in the Spring Election to be
held Wednesday and Thursday.
Senior Stacey Leyton, junior
Miguel Marquez and sophomores
David Brown and Canetta Ivy have
an ambitious agenda. Their goal is
to revamp the traditional role of
the COP, transforming it from a
primarily functional, administra
tive group to a conduit and
facilitator of discussion on political
issues that affect the educational
climate of the University.
This metamorphosis of the role
of the COP is risky, though. If
elected, the slate must continually
re-examine itself to ensure that its
ideological tilt toward progres
sivism and minority issues does
not close the ASSU to those with
other concerns.
The ASSU has a broad con
stituency — liberal and conserva
tive alike. If A New Slate of Mind
truly believes in pluralism, as it
espouses, then it must tolerate

radically opposing viewpoints. If it
proves intolerant, then the slate
would be hypocritical.
The slate must give equal time
to the pragmatic and the idealistic.
Broad goals like tenure reform and
an Ethnic Studies Department are
laudable, but they must not over
ride logistical problems that plague
student life such as the student
office space shortage.
Leyton, Marquez, Ivy and Brown
are more than simply progressive
leaders; together these four can
lead the whole ASSU. Leyton and
Marquez, current senators, are
well acquainted with the senate's
byzantine workings and know how
to grease its often creaky wheels.
This slate is impressive, but it
must recognize that it has now
stepped forward to represent not
just special interests, but the con
cerns of the entire student body.
