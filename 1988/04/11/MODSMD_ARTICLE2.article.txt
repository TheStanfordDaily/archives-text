# ASSU Senate combats racism charges
## 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
Prompted in part by last week's charges of
racism, the ASSU Senate appears to have
focused its attention on problems in its
nominating and appointment process.
In a meeting today, the senate is scheduled
to discuss measures that would make the
bureaucratic process of appointing ASSU of
ficers more uniform, in order to avoid poten
tially racist incidents.
Last Tuesday, the Black Student Union
charged that "institutional racism" was a fac
tor in three recommended appointments by
the ASSU. In one instance, ASSU Speakers
Bureau Director Terri James, a black junior,
was not recommended for reappointment by
a senate nominations committee. Instead,
white sophomore Andrew Berke received the
committee's recommendation.
According to the BSU, James was asked
questions pertaining to possible "vested in

terests" or "biases" connected with being
black.
Although last week James said she heard
rumors that racism was a factor in the com
mittee's recommendation, she said yesterday
that racism probably did not figure into the
decision. "I don't think [the recommendation]
was based on racism," James said, adding
that she planned to stay on at the Speakers
Bureau and work as an event promoter.
According to members of the committee
that recommended Berke, differences over the
objectives of the Speakers Bureau, rather than
the racism alleged last week by the BSU, led
to a recommended change in the leadership
of the program.
COP member Maria Canas, graduate
senator Galia Tylman and undergraduate
senator Timur Colak all said Thursday that
the committee's decision was motivated by
clear differences in each applicant's goals for
the Speakers Bureau.
Canas, Tylman and Colak were the three

voting members of the committee that voted
unanimously to recommend Berke.
The three agreed that Berke was chosen to
replace James as director because the
Speakers Bureau under James was reportedly
not attracting enough "headliners" to speak
on campus.
Colak said he may be able to pinpoint where
the misunderstanding originated concerning
"racism" in the selection process. During the
James interview, Colak explained, he asked
one question that may have been misin
terpreted by the people who alleged racism.
Colak explained to James that since she
was the incumbent, her performance as di
rector over the past year was under scrutiny.
Colak said he questioned one specific Speakers
Bureau program set up by James, a year-long
series on "Poetry, Prose and Politics."
"I asked whether it was wise to cater to a
small group of people," Colak said, explaining
