# Reject project tax plan

### 
THE constitutional amend
ment to provide funding for
long-term ASSU projects —
reappearing on the ballot for the
fourth time — should be voted
down once again.
If passed, the ASSU would be
able to tax students for long-term
projects, such as recreational
facilities, that students want but
the University will not or can not
fund.
The amendment places the bur
den of funding and building the
student projects on the ASSU
when the burden rightfully rests
with the University. It absolves the
University of its responsibility to
provide facilities for students.

proval of a long-term project would
require a great mobilization of stu
dent energy that would be better
spent pressuring the University to
respond to students' needs.
This amendment is a compro
mise of student integrity. ASSU
legislation should seek to draw the
University's attention to its stu
dents, not to find ways for students
to administer the tasks that belong
in the University's hands.
