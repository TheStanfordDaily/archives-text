# Require ASSU training
## 
### 
THE DAILY supports the con
stitutional amendment to re
quire training of elected and
appointed officials in the ASSU. It
should be the obligation of past
officials to train newly elected can
didates.
Opponents to the amendment
argue that procedural provisions
belong in the ASSU by-laws and
not in its constitution. This
amendment is not merely
procedural; it helps to define the
roles and responsibilities of the
Council of Presidents, and there
fore does belong in the constitu
tion.
The details of the training pro
gram, however, are properly set
forth in the by-laws, and should
be explicitly defined.

Constitutional
Amendment Two:
M Yes

According to the current COP,
which supports the amendment,
training is currently handled hap
hazardly and is often ignored.
This amendment will provide a
continuity that has been sadly
lacking in ASSU bodies.
By placing a training require
ment in the constitution, the im
portance of officer training — in
a government that undergoes an
annual leadership transition —
could no longer be questioned.
