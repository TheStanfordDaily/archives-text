## Avoid evils of silence 
### 
THE EXPRESSIONS on the
children's faces unleashed a tor
rent of tears that I could no longer
hold back. I had endured looking at the
black and white photographs of tons of
human hair, of mass graves of human
skeletons, of the furnaces and tools of
human genocide. But seeing the faces of
the children who went through the
Holocaust at Yad Vashem, Israel's
Holocaust Memorial, transformed the
abstract number of six million into the
very real children before me. And I cried.
I cried not because I had not seen looks
of death and despair before. The nightly
news and weekly magazines present a
continuous technicolor flow of the images
of worldwide torture, killings and other
ravages of war and terrorism. My tears
streamed because I could relate to the
raw emotions of shock, fear, puzzlement
and emptiness in front of me.
Their faces asked the questions: Where
are they taking us? Where are my mother,
my father, my sisters, my brothers? What
have I done wrong? When can I leave or
when will it be over? Why is this hap
pening?
At my Passover Seder this year, an
evening that celebrated the Jews' exodus
from Egyptian slavery, we read the tradi
tional four sons passages. These sons —
the Wise Son, the Rebellious Son, the
Simple Son and the One Who Does Not
Know How To Ask — represent four
types of children that require progres
sively simpler explanations of Passover's
meaning.
But this year, we read about a Fifth
Child, a child of the Holocaust, who did

not survive to ask a question. For that
child, we ask the question: Why?
We answered that child's question with
silence. The silence of the children who
stopped asking questions because there
were no comprehendable answers. The
Third Reich told them that they, as Jews,
were Europe's vermin; only complete ex
termination would prevent the disease
from spreading.
Silence was the disease back then. It
is the disease right now. Hitler showed
the world that no one wanted the Jews
when he sent several hundred of them
on a ship, the Voyage of the Damned.
No country, the United States in
cluded, would allow this ship to dock and
admit these outcast men, women and
children. Hitler laughed at the world's
silence. Where was the public's moral
outrage and the voices of the media, the
Vatican and the world's leaders?
Drowned out in silence.
Silence lets us deny our responsibility
for the problems created. "I was just
following orders," says the captured Ges
tapo soldier or Kurt Waldheim, president
of Austria.
"It was not our fault," state some Ger
man government members about the
Holocaust and some Americans about the
slavery and discrimination against blacks.
Silence lets you forget. Why shouldn't
you have visited Bitburg cemetery, Mr.
President? Because SS soldiers are buried
there and the memory of their mutila
tions can not and should not be buried
along with them.
Although Elie Wiesel will "never forget

the little faces of the children whose
bodies he saw turned into wreaths of
smoke beneath a silent blue sky," studies
have already emerged alleging that the
Holocaust never occurred but was a
Jewish scheme to obtain a Jewish state.
Silence must be constantly combatted.
Buying a "We Are the World" T-shirt or
album in 1985 does not help starving
Ethiopians in 1988. Once we begin to
speak, we must continue to voice our
views lest the spreading cancer of silence
engulf us again.
The final frames of Louis Malle's "Au
Revoir Les Enfants" focuses on the
silence that surrounds the young Malle
as he watches the Nazis take away his
Jewish friend. The message of those last
frames is clear: Silence created the
Holocaust, and silence can beget another
one.
Yom Hashoah, the annual day to re
member the Holocaust's victims, occurs
this Wednesday, April 13. This day asks
everyone, not just Jews, to stop and hear
the sounds of children playing in Europe
over 40 years ago. Then, feel their silence
and the world's silence. And never let it
happen again.
