## SIG ignores Libertarians 
### 
THIS LETTER is prompted by a
frustrating encounter April 6
with Stanford in Government
President Gary Rosen at the SlG
sponsored debate "Democrats or Re
publicans in '88?"
The title of this debate alone implies
that no alternatives to the two-party
political monopoly exist, despite the
fact that three other parties have
complied with the arduous process
required for official California ballot
certification.
This event was apparently an
nounced in the San Jose Mercury
News on the morning of the event,
which prompted several local leaders of
the Libertarian Party to contact Rosen
about why they had not been invited
to participate.
Rosen initially tried to hide behind a
stance that since he was being con
tacted so close to the actual event
there was nothing he could do about
expanding the scope.
At the behest of Mark Hinkle, past
chair of the California Libertarian
Party, and Scott Lieberman, San Jose
campaign coordinator for Ron Paul for
President, I spoke with Rosen about
their concern that no attempt had
been made to reach the Libertarian
Party regarding the event.
As a member of the Stanford com
munity and a candidate myself, I
offered to provide him with a conduit
for cooperation on future events. It
rapidly became clear, however, that
Rosen does not view the efforts of
anyone other than Republicrats as
worthy of attention.
He backed from his initial position
of not having enough time to include
the Libertarians in this event to admit
ting that he had no interest in contact
ing any "fringe" political groups for
forum-type events sponsored by SIG.
He implied that it was the responsi
bility of these groups to prove their

worthiness for inclusion in advance.
When pressed to define a standard
by which he would judge such worthi
ness, however, he was suddenly at a
loss for words. Clearly, to define such
a criterion would make it possible for
the untouchables to meet it, and thus
deny him the opportunity to exclude
them.
We have just gone through a
traumatic year at Stanford in evaluat
ing our recognition of the contributions
of minority groups to our institution
and society.
I submit that it is no less important
for us to understand and admit the
contributions of minority political
efforts. I question whether it is appro
priate to expend ASSU funds on an
organization which deliberately ex
cludes such minority input from its
forums.
The Libertarian Party and its candi
dates stand ready to participate in
broadening the scope of political debate
at Stanford. I urge all members of the
Stanford community to demand that
we and other third parties are provided
with that opportunity.
