## Charge of racism unfair 
### 
I AM WRITING in regard to the
April 6 and 7 articles about the
ASSU Office of Public Affairs and
the charges of racism. I am writing
this letter not because I feel I must
defend myself or the original selection
of me as director.
My reason and values force me to
explain the circumstances surrounding
this affair because of gross, unfair
treatment of me by The Daily, the
ASSU Senate and the Black Student
Union.
At the senate meeting, allegations of
racism were made by director of the
Speakers Bureau Terri James, the BSU
and junior Rachel Wiesen regarding
the Office of Public Affairs and the
recommendation of my appointment as
director.
These allegations were made by all
three parties without previous knowl
edge of my qualifications. They could
not have seen my application, my
resume or have known the content of
my interview because all of that infor
mation was confidential. What was
obvious at the time was the racial
difference between Wiesen and me and
the two interviewers.
When the charge of racism is used
improperly or without any justification,

it serves to undermine all that minor
ity groups have accomplished and
worked for on this campus.
The selection committee's rationale
for the decision was not challenged.
The decision had been labeled racist.
The senate accepted this label as rea
son enough to re-evaluate the candi
dates. This faulty reasoning had
serious consequences on the re
interviewing process.
The irony of the whole situation is
that racism had nothing to do with the
original recommendation of my ap
pointment as director. A great conflict
existed between the new administrative
manager, Sheilon King, and COP
member Leonard Adler, the only two
voting members of the committee.
Two weeks ago I went to King and
asked her why the selection process
had been taking so long. Unlike The
Daily implied, I, like Wiesen, had to
wait six weeks for the decision. She
told me that the whole thing had
"boiled down to a battle of wills."
Only one week later, King was asked
to serve on the new selection commit
tee. Adler did not serve on the new
committee.
King's presence was not questioned
on the committee because the reasons

behind the needed re-evaluation were
charges of racism.
If the senate had investigated the
allegation before it acted on it, it
would have discovered that a fair
re-evaluation of the candidates, if
needed, meant that no member from
the original committee could un
biasedly sit on the new selection com
mittee.
In the senate's haste to accommo
date Wiesen's disapproval of the
amount of time taken to make a deci
sion, the new interview was scheduled
in less than 24 hours of the emotion
ally disturbing senate meeting. In that
time, The Daily's one-sided treatment
of the racial allegations and sen
sationalizing of the facts, had a great
impact on the Stanford community.
Because the BSU made unsubstanti
ated allegations, the senate acted with
haste without complete information,
and The Daily failed in its efforts to
do a little investigative reporting, racial
tensions have been allowed to grow on
campus.
In a year where we have seen tre
mendous progress in the recognitinon
of the racial problems that exist at
Stanford, we also see all that work
jeopardized. It saddens and angers me
to see this happen.

Director, ASSU Office of Public Affairs
