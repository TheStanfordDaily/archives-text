## Many blacks hold ASSU administrative positions 
### 
WHAT ARE the main motiva
tions behind the Black Student
Union's charges of racism
aimed at the ASSU?
Equal and fair treatment for all
applicants? A higher percentage of
minority students represented in the
ASSU?
Minority students occupy 22 out of
36 available positions in the ASSU
administration.
Ten out of 12 black students inter
viewed last quarter were appointed,
bringing total black representation in
the ASSU to over 25 percent of all
positions, a percentage greater than
that of blacks composing the Stanford
student body.
Yet, BSU Chair Bill King still feels
that blacks are not adequately repre
sented. He claims some black students
were judged unfairly by the racially
biased ASSU interview committees.
However, King neglected to mention
the way the committees are biased.
The ASSU interview committee for
Program Board officers last quarter
was composed of three black voting
members and one Latino non-voting

member, and next year's chosen direc
tor and assistant director of the Pro
gram Board are black.
Regardless of whether they were the
most qualified applicants or not, the
circumstances under which they were
chosen were not ideally fair to all
applicants.
Furthermore, King's assertion that
the high proportion of blacks in the
ASSU represents more active involve
ment in student government is er
roneous; rather, he should say the
high involvement is the result to more
calculated and aggressive activities.
The BSU is a valuable umbrella
organization for black students, serving
many of the needs of the black com
munity, including protection against
discrimination.
If, however, the major motivation of
the BSU is to have fair and equal
treatment for all students, its members
and its chair should consider their own
actions and biases before they fire such
blanket charges against all of the
ASSU.
