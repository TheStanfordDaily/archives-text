## Swimmers capture five titles at NCAAs 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The strains of
"The Eyes of
Texas" emitting
from the victory
stand in the In
dianapolis Natato
rium signaled the

end of an NCAA men's swimming
dynasty, but not the death of the
old guard.
Texas ended Stanford's three
year reign as national champions
Saturday night, but the Cardinal
was far from passive. The squad
won five individual events, the
most of any school in the meet,

on its way to an overall bronze.
Individual victories by senior
Sean Murphy in the 200 yard
backstroke, senior Anthony Mosse
in the 200 butterfly, junior Jay
Mortenson in the 100 back and
100 fly and sophomore John
Witchel in the 500 freestyle paced
Stanford to a third-place finish.
The Cardinal's 276.5 points
placed the team behind the Long
horns (424) and USC (369.5). Cal
ifornia's tally of 250 was good for
fourth place with Michigan fol
lowing at 203.5. Louisiana State,
UCLA, Florida, Southern Meth
odist, and Nebraska rounded out
the top 10.
"Coming into the meet as the

three-time defending champion
it's hard to settle for anything
less than victory," Stanford Coach
Skip Kenney said. "But we came
away with five individual titles,
more than any other school, and
I'm really pleased with our per
formance."
Even with Witchel's victory
Thursday night, the Cardinal was
down by over 50 points on the
first day, a fairly insurmountable
spread to overcome. But the squad
refused to succumb to its situa
tion, exemplified by Mortenson,
Murphy and Mosse's Friday
performances.
The 6-foot-4 Mortenson merely
became the first person since

George Kojac in 1927 to win two
individual races in the same eve
ning. The Wisconsin native
cruised to a 100-fly victory in
47.27 seconds, just ahead of South
Carolina's Wade King and team
mate Mosse, for his first NCAA
title. The American 100-back
recordholder then outdistanced
teammate Murphy less than half
an hour later in the 100 back for
his second gold of the night. His
48.17, while just off his 47.94
swim of 1987, was good for a pool
record.
"Jay was really awesome," Ken
ney said, getting straight to the
point.
But co-captains (and room
mates) Murphy and Mosse
refused to settle for second and
third places. The dethroned 200-
back champion Murphy came
back with a vengeance Saturday
night. After posting the second
fastest morning qualifying time
to Texas' Doug Gjertson, his
nemesis last season, the '85 and
'86 titleholder took the lead in
the first 50 yards of the final and
refused to let go of his advantage.
Leading Gjertson at one point by
almost two seconds, Murphy held
on for a victory, posting a time
of 1:45.54.
Mosse's performance almost
mirrored that of Murphy. After
swimming in the shadow of All-
Everything butterflier Pablo
Morales for the past three years,
the New Zealand Olympian was
not going to let his last opportu
nity for an individual title slip by.
"It was the most pressure I've

ever felt going into a race, even
more than the Olympics in Los
Angeles, because it was my last
race on the last night (of NCAAs)
and was the final time I would
be swimming for Stanford,"
Mosse said.
Mosse also grabbed an early
lead and held on for the victory
over David Wharton, who was
named Swimmer of the Year. The
Trojan freshman had already
posted victories in the 200 and
400 individual medleys, setting an
American record of 3:42.54 in the
400 on Friday. Mosse's 1:43.99
was good for the Cardinal's fifth
individual crown of the meet.
"Not only are Anthony and
Sean going out on top, but they
beat two of the hottest swimmers
in the nation (Wharton and
Gjertson), creating momentum
for themselves going into this
summer and the Olympics," Ken
ney said.
"Sean and Anthony had
phenomenal swims," sophomore
sprinter Doug Lillydahl added.
Although Stanford had prob
lems with its depth in supporting
the team placing, the situation
was far from bleak. While a num
ber of competitors failed to reach
championship or consolation
finals due to swimming much un
der their potential, especially on
the first day of racing, many
caught on to Witchel, Mortenson,
Mosse and Murphy's momentum.
Sophomore Rick Gould, a first
time qualifier, placed 11th in the
100 back Friday and again
reached the consolation finals Sat

urday, taking 13th in the 200
back. Sophomore Byron Burson
finished a respectable 12th in the
100 fly, then posted a personal
best while placing 17th in the 100
free Saturday.
"We definitely built into the
meet as the week went on," Lil
lydahl stated. "It was great that
by the third day we rebounded
and built momentum and had the
little guys do best times."
"The guys did a great job of
coming back the second and third
days after a slow opening day,"
Kenney said.
Diver Matt Frawly scored his
first national championship
points by placing 15th in the one
meter and 14th in the three-meter
competitions. Friday's 800 free
relay took sixth while the 400 free
relay posted a seventh-place finish
in the final race of the champi
onships.
Both of the free relays, as well
as the medley relay team, lost to
Texas' squads. The Longhorns be
came the first team since 1976 to
win all three relay events, setting
a new American record in the 400
free Saturday night (2:52.01) on
the way to its sweep.
"If you had asked me three
weeks ago how I'd feel about Stan
ford placing third as a team I
would have said very disap
pointed," tri-captain Mosse said.
"But I'm really pleased with the
overall performance of the team.
Everyone showed a lot of charac
ter."

Despite Anthony Mosse's victory in the 200-yard butterfly, the Cardinal swimming team came up
short in its bid for a fourth consecutive NCAA title.
