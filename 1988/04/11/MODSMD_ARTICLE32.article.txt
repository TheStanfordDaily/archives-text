# Stanford wilts in Arizona sun

TUCSON, Ariz. — If cats have
nine lives, then the Arizona
Wildcats used all of theirs yes
terday, coming back from the
dead several times to beat
Stanford 9-8 at Sancet Field.
The Wildcats trailed 6-1 at

one point and 8-7 later, but scored twice in
the bottom of the eighth to hand the Cardinal
its second loss of the weekend.
The Cardinal was toasted 20-5 Friday and
won 10-7 Saturday to move its season record
to 25-13 and its conference record to 10-7. A
win yesterday would have propelled Stanford
into first place in the tightly bunched Pacific
10 Southern Division. But after the loss, the
Cardinal stands in third place, behind Cali
fornia and Arizona State, which are tied for
first at 11-7. USC lurks in fourth with a 9-8
record.
The Cardinal dropped the two games when
its two trademarks — pitching and defense
— failed it. On Friday, Stanford's pitchers
couldn't get any Wildcats out, period, and
yesterday, they couldn't get them out when
it mattered.
The Cardinal started strongly yesterday be
hind freshman pitcher Stan Spencer, scoring
once in the first and twice in the fourth, but
leaving the bases loaded in both the second
and third innings.
Spencer looked invincible through five,
giving up only three hits, including a solo
home run by Todd Devereaux in the fifth.
Stanford added three in the sixth. The big
blow was a two-run triple by Troy Paulsen.
With Paul Carey on second and Frank Carey
on first, Paulsen stroked what looked to be
a long fly-out to right field.
But as the runners held up, Wildcat
rightfielder Sean Murphy broke toward the
right-center gap while Paulsen's hit sliced
away from him into the corner. Both of the

runners came around to score and Paulsen
ended up on third.
Spencer looked to be cruising along, enter
ing the sixth with a 6-1 lead, but the Wildcats
had different ideas. They loaded the bases
with one out in the sixth, then Frank Hal
covich doubled into the left-field corner to
clear the bases and make the score 6-4.
Steve Chitren replaced Spencer, but imme
diately gave up an RBI single to J.T. Snow
that brought the Wildcats to within a run, at
6-5.
Both teomß ■cored twice m the seventh to
run the score to 8-7.
In the bottom of the eighth, the third Car
dinal pitcher of the day, Lee Plemel, had two
outs with a man on first, but walked Dave
Shermet to put two on. After Cardinal
shortstop Paulsen booted Glenn Baxley's
grounder, the bases were full.
Kevin Long then singled up the middle to
bring in two runs and give the Wildcats the
lead for the first time in the game. "I had a
feeling I was going to come through," Long
said. "We just battled back."
The Cardinal hit the ball hard three times
in the ninth, but all three were right at Wildcat
defenders, as reliever Jason Klonoski wrapped
up the win to improve his record to 5-4.
Plemel was tagged with the loss — his
second of the weekend — moving his record
to 5-5.
"We just didn't do a real good job of relief,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said. "But
credit them — they hit the ball well."
"It was a tough game," Stanford first
baseman Ron Witmeyer said. "It's typical of
this park and this league — there's no lead
that's safe."
In fact, it looked like the Cardinal's big
lead Saturday night might not be safe, either.
After neither team scored through four in
nings, Stanford exploded in the fifth, scoring
seven runs on six hits to chase Wildcat starter
Jim Richardson.
The Cardinal added two in the sixth on a

two-run single by Paul Carey, and got one
more in the eighth. Carey had four RBI on
the day.
Freshman Mike Mussina, meanwhile,
turned up the dial on his fastball, striking
out a career-high 10 and allowing only seven
hits (although those included two home runs)
through eight. He entered the ninth with a
comfy 10-3 lead, then pitched himself into
and out of a jam.
The first four Wildcat batters got hits, in
cluding a three-run home run by Dave Sher
met that made the score 10-7.
Mussina got the next two batters on fly
outs, however, and after Long drew a walk,
Paul Carey gloved Greg Fowble's blast to right
to seal the win.
It was Mussina's fifth complete game in 12
starts this year, and the win improves his
record to 7-1.
"We were slow starting offensively, but Mike
(Mussina) kept us in the game until we ex
ploded in the fifth," Marquess said. "Mussina
was at his best until the end of the game.
He pitched a terrific game and held back a
very talented offensive team."
"After (Friday night), I knew they could
hit the ball," Mussina said. "I still had to
pitch my game, though, and my game is
fastball. We hit the ball well . . . the support
was there."
Wildcat pitcher Halcovich, who doubles as
Arizona's designated hitter, was the one who
got the support on Friday night.
The Wildcats' wild bats collected 19 hits,
including four doubles, two triples and three
home runs. The first homer was a third-inning
grand slam by Devereaux that broke the game
wide open.
Things were so grim that the Cardinal ef
fectively surrendered in the sixth. Not wanting
to expend another pitcher in a losing cause,
Marquess sent sacrificial lambs Mike Eicher
(ordinarily an outfielder) and Jeff Light (or
dinarily an infielder) to the mound to finish
up.

The brightest spot for the Cardinal baseball squad in Arizona was
the pitching of Mike Mussina. The freshman struck out 10 In a
complete-game win Saturday.
