# Non-league foes pose little challenge for Card
## Second-ranked Cardinal has an easy time in San Diego 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
When No. 21 San
Diego State and
No. 24 U.S. Inter
national find
themselves up a
gainst the likes of
Stanford, the sec-

ond-ranked women's tennis team
in the country, their hopes rest
on the possibility that the Cardi
nal might become complacent.
Their hopes, however, are
futile.
"We're pretty serious with
every match we go into," Cardinal
freshman Sandra Birch said. "We
kind of just do our business on
the court."
This weekend in San Diego, the
Aztecs and Gulls got a first-hand
view of Stanford's business like
approach. The Cardinal took care
of SDSU 6-1 Saturday and
polished off USIU 5-1 yesterday
to up its record to 20-1. The two
time defending national cham
pions have clinched 18 of their
20 victories in singles.
With junior Eleni Roasides and
senior Cari Hagey sidelined by in
juries, the Cardinal only had
seven players available for this

weekend's matches. And several
of those players were not 100 per
cent. "Our whole team is fighting
the flu," Birch said. "Nobody is
feeling that well."
Yet almost everybody is win
ning. And in straight sets.
Saturday, the Cardinal swept
the singles contests, winning
every set in the process. Junior
Cindy Buchsbaum posted her first
win of the season as she defeated
SDSU's Karen Cooper 6-1, 6-1 in
the No. 6 singles.
The Aztecs' only victory came
in the No. 3 doubles, where Julie
Tullberg and Kristin Hill knocked
off Buchsbaum and sophomore
Valerie Wilson 6-2, 6-2.
Yesterday, the only blemish for
Stanford came at No. 6 singles.
Buchsbaum, who has traded off
with Hagey at No. 6 in recent
matches, lost a cliff-hanger to the
Gulls' Shabnam Siddiqi 7-6 (7-5),
7-6 (7-4).
The other contests were not
nearly as close, as the top five
Cardinal players took little time
disposing their opponents. Fresh
man Teri Whitlinger remained
undefeated in dual-match action
with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over
USIU's Julie Labonte.
Freshmen Tami Whitlinger and

Birch, and senior Kay Tittle also
kept winning streaks intact with
a pair of victories this weekend.
Whitlinger, the team's No. 1
singles player, has won 15 con
secutive matches. Birch has re
corded 14 straight victories, and
Tittle has won seven in a row.
Birch downplayed her recent
hot streak. "I don't really think
about it. I'm not aware of my
record," she said.
She pointed to next weekend's
home matches against No. 3 USC
and No. 4 UCLA as being "really
important."
Stanford beat the Trojans 7-1
and the Bruins 6-3 in Los Angeles
two weeks ago, but Birch said that
the Cardinal expects a much
tougher battle this time. "We
thought that USC was really flat
when we played them," she said,
explaining that the Trojans were
in the middle of exams at that
time. "I think they were a little
bit anxious to get done (with
finals). They're going to want
revenge."
The score of the UCLA match
was a bit misleading. The Bruins
had only five healthy people and,
thus, were forced to default in
the No. 6 singles and No. 3 dou
bles.
