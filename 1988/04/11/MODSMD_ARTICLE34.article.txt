# Golfers 7th at home

### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
Stanford Men's
Golf Coach Wally
Goodwin did not
want his team to
have a "home
course advan-
Jtage" in this

weekend's Stanford/U.S. Inter
collegiate, so he did not give his
players the pin placement sheets
for the Stanford Golf Course
early. The Cardinal golfers did
not need any advance informa
tion, however, as they turned
in one of their best perform
ances of the year against a chal
lenging field.
Stanford placed seventh in
the field of 18 of the finest West
ern teams, including top-ranked
Arizona and highly regarded
UCLA, USC, Fresno State,
Pacific and UC-Santa Barbara.

Arizona took the tournament
title with a 54-hole team total
of 1,080. UCLA followed with a
score of 1,097. Stanford's three
round tally of 1,118 was two
shots better than UOP's and a
full 17 strokes better than
UCSB's.
After the first 36 holes Friday,
many scores were surprisingly
low for the challenging Stanford
course. UCLA's Kevin Leach led
the field with a score of 133
(69-64). Stanford sophomore
Brad Joondeph was tied for
eighth the first day, firing a 143
(70-73).
Saturday's round was a com
pletely different story. Most of
the pins were set in the hardest
areas possible. It was not a day
to try and make birdies, it was
a day to avoid bogeys. As ex
pected, the scores ballooned.
Leach hung on to win with a
final round 73, and most course

locals heaved a sigh of relief that
the senior did not even come
within striking distance of the
golf course's 54-hole tourna
ment record (199).
Stanford's Joondeph shot one
of the best scores of the day, a
3-over par 74, to give him a 217
for the tournament and seventh
place among all golfers. Sopho
more Josh Zander followed
Joondeph with a final round 74
as well, and a tournament total
of 224.
Everything that happened
this week was positive. The
team did well, the tournament
ran smoothly and the course
was in outstanding condition.
Reflecting on his team's per
formance, Goodwin said that it
was "far from perfection, but
it's getting there. Everyone in
terested in golf around the uni
versity should be encouraged."
