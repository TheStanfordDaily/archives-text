# Women take off to Phoenix
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
It's do-or-die time
for the Stanford
women's golf team
as it is entering
this week's Lady
Sun Devil Tourna
ment at the

Anasazi Golf Course in Phoenix
with its back to the wall.
With 10 competitive rounds
remaining in the season, Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin believes the
Cardinal will have to beat eight
of its 14 best team "differentials"
in order to qualify for the NCAA
Championships.
A player's differential is calcu
lated by subtracting the player's
score from the course rating, a
number used to describe the dif
ficulty of a course relative to other
courses. The team differential is
the sum of the four lowest player
differentials for that round.
The 14 teams with the lowest
average differential over their
best 14 rounds qualify for NCAAs.

"For us to make NCAAs we, and
the girls know this, are going to
have to play very well," Baldwin
said.
Despite the tough road ahead,
the Cardinal women have gained
some momentum heading into Ar
izona. During spring break they
won the University of Hawaii's
tournament by a whopping 20
strokes. Also, senior Kay Cor
nelius won her first individual
championship of her collegiate
career. She beat freshman team
mate Jodi Figley on the first hole
of sudden death after the two
were tied through 54 holes.
In addition, freshman Kristin
Ryan, whose scores have been
consistently improving over the
year, captured sixth place. Her
improved play should provide the
Cardinal with some necessary ad
ditional punch down the stretch.
"Kristin will have a very good
tournament," Baldwin predicted.
"She is striking the ball really
well."
That extra punch may be
enough for the women. The

course, a par-72, 6,500-yard mon
ster that carries a 75.3 rating,
was designed by Pete Dye, an ar
chitect well-known for the length
and difficulty of his masterpieces.
To give a perspective on the
length of Anasazi, it is longer than
the Stanford Golf Course played
from the men's tees (6,400 yards).
"It's a very demanding course,"
said Baldwin. "Very long and dif
ficult. It's going to be a test for
everyone."
Baldwin is hoping that his
young team can put together
three good rounds and come out
with "a top-five finish." That goal
is a lofty one indeed, as seven of
the nation's top 10 teams will
compete. Arizona, host Arizona
State, New Mexico, New Mexico
State, Oklahoma State, Tulsa and
UCLA will stand in the way of
the Cardinal's goal.
"If we have three good, solid
rounds," Baldwin said, "there will
be a very good feeling heading
into the conference champion
ship."
