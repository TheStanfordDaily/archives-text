# Gymnasts finish year on high note

Sometimes a
competitive
season is just
like a roller
coaster, with
many ups and
downs. As the

——uuuiio. no biiv
Stanford women's gymnastics
team entered regional compe
tition Saturday, it was hoping
this particular meet would be
one of those ups.
"We had the best meet of
our season," Stanford Coach
Homer Sardina explained hap
pily. That was the good news.
However, despite hitting the
peak they had hoped for, the
women were victimized by low
scores. They managed to
muster up a 182.95 team score
and a fifth-place finish behind
winner Oregon State, runner
up UCLA, Washington and
Fullerton State.
The team score, more than
two points lower than the
squad's previous high of
185.10, was not indicative of
the gymnasts' performances,
according to Sardina. The com
petition was divided into two
sessions, with the fifth-ranked
Cardinal joining the sixth- and
seventh-ranked teams in the
first session, and the first
through fourth-ranked teams
competing later in the day.
As often occurs in figure
skating, the judges kept the
early scores down to leave room
for later performances that
might better them. As a result,
comparable performances in
the different sessions led to
lower scores in the early ses
sion and inflated scores later
in the evening. Junior Cheryl
Doo explained, "I think we
could have gotten at least a
186, if not a 187, if we had
been competing in the second

session."
Undaunted by the disap
pointing scores, the women
finished the meet having hit
20 out of 24 sets and only
having to count one fall when
computing the team score. The
team's clean performance was
the most consiatant yet, reflect
ing the gymnasts' positive at
titude entering the meet. "We
felt we had nothing to lose, so
we just went out there and gave
it our all," junior Sheri Ev«n
son explained.
Though the Cardinal will not
be represented as a team at
the NCAA Championships this
year, sophomore Dina Amoroso
proved herself worthy of a trip
as an individual all-around per
former. Amoroso topped off her
record-breaking season — in
cluding the highest Stanford
all-around score in history, a
38.25 — by finishing in fourth
place with a 37.80.
"Dina's a quality person rep
resenting us at NCAAs," Sar
dina commented. Understand
ably proud of his gymnast, he
hopes to see Amoroso become
an All-American, a title earned
by placing top in the 10 in the
all-around at nationals.
Senior Alison McGann also
put in a top-quality perform
ance, ending her collegiate
career with a 37.15 all-around
mark. Once again, scoring
plagued the Cardinal. Sardina
accounted for McGann's nar
row miss at qualifying for na
tionals because of her ques
tionably low vault score.
All and all, it may not have
been the fairy-tale ending the
gymnasts and their coaches
were hoping for, but the Car
dinal agreed that its perform
ance Saturday was a positive
way to finish the season. "No
one can say we didn't have
team spirit," Evenson said.
