# Netters clobber Arizona, ASU

### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
Freshman David
Wheaton, showing
flashes of the play
expected of the top
U.S. junior, won
his singles and
doubles matches

over the weekend as the Stanford
men's tennis team notched im
pressive 8-1 wins against Arizona
and Arizona State at Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
As Wheaton is regaining the
form that enabled him to reach
the finals of the Volvo/All-
America tournament in Novem
ber, the third-rated Cardinal is
seeing a key ingredient to its
championship hopes fall into
place. Stanford is now 17-1 (7-0
in the Pacific 10 Conference).
"Our team hasn't been playing
up to its ability most of the year,"
Wheaton said. "But we have been
getting better with each match
we play. I'm back into the swing
of things. I'm definitely not
playing my best, but I'm getting
better every day."
Wheaton, playing at No. 2
singles, served and volleyed his
way to a 6-4, 6-0 win over Arizo
na's lan Aler and a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4
victory against ASU's Ken
Kuperstein. He is 7-1 since his
return from injury.
Saturday, Wheaton also paired
with sophomore Jeff Tarango to
annihilate the Sun Devils' Mike
Holten and Bryan Gyetko 6-4, 6-1.
The net play of Wheaton and
Tarango just overpowered the
ASU tandem.
With the win, Wheaton and
Tarango own two victories over
Holten and Gyetko, the nation's
third-ranked pair, and two wins
against USC's Scott Melville and
Eric Amend, the nation's No. 1
tandem.
Neither Friday's match against
the Wildcats nor the contest
against ASU turned out to be
much of a battle. With the Car
dinal airing out strong perform
ances at every position, Stanford
clinched both matches in the

'Stanford is the best
team in the country.'

singles competition.
"The last two matches were our
most solid of the year," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "I had
hoped we'd turn the corner and
get three solid efforts (the Cardi
nal hosts Utah tomorrow). We've
got two of them."
Senior Patrick McEnroe started
off the Stanford romp against Ar
izona with a 6-1, 6-1 win over
Scott Sigerseth. Tarango,
Wheaton, freshman Martin Black
man and freshman Glenn
Solomon all won their singles
matches.
The lone blemish for the Car
dinal was Wildcat Jeff Spier's 3-6,
7-6, 7-5 victory over sophomore
Jeff Cathrall. With the loss, Ari
zona dropped to 11-11 (0-8 in con
ference play).
No. 10 ASU figured to put up
more of a fight against Stanford
but a second consecutive solid
singles performance by the Car
dinal sent the Sun Devils packing.
"Stanford is the best team in the
country," Arizona State Coach
Lou Belken said.
ASU slipped to 17-8 (3-6 in Pac
-10 play).
McEnroe bested Holten 6-3, 6-3
and Cathrall disposed of Jeff
Wood 6-4, 6-1 to put the Cardinal
up 2-0.
Wheaton followed with his vic
tory, and Blackman ousted
Gyetko by a 7-6, 3-6, 6-2 score.
Tarango's forehands and return
of serve were too much for Doug
Sachs, as Tarango upended him
6-4, 7-6.
Solomon, upping his dual
match record to 11-1, outlasted
Dan Marting 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.
In doubles play, Wood and Mar
ting defeated sophomore Eric
Peus and freshman Dan Turbow
6-4, 3-6, 6-2 and Solomon and
sophomore Jonathan Kahn beat
Joel Finnigan and Lance Stanley
6-1, 6-4.

Saturday, Wheaton also paired
with sophomore Jeff Tarango to
annihilate the Sun Devils' Mike
Holten and Bryan Gyetko 6-4, 6-1.
The net play of Wheaton and
Tarango just overpowered the
ASU tandem.
With the win, Wheaton and
Tarango own two victories over
Holten and Gyetko, the nation's
third-ranked pair, and two wins
against USC's Scott Melville and
Eric Amend, the nation's No. 1
tandem.
Neither Friday's match against
the Wildcats nor the contest
against ASU turned out to be
much of a battle. With the Car
dinal airing out strong perform
ances at every position, Stanford
clinched both matches in the

team in the country.'

singles competition.
"The last two matches were our
most solid of the year," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "I had
hoped we'd turn the corner and
get three solid efforts (the Cardi
nal hosts Utah tomorrow). We've
got two of them."
Senior Patrick McEnroe started
off the Stanford romp against Ar
izona with a 6-1, 6-1 win over
Scott Sigerseth. Tarango,
Wheaton, freshman Martin Black
man and freshman Glenn
Solomon all won their singles
matches.
The lone blemish for the Car
dinal was Wildcat Jeff Spier's 3-6,
7-6, 7-5 victory over sophomore
Jeff Cathrall. With the loss, Ari
zona dropped to 11-11 (0-8 in con
ference play).
No. 10 ASU figured to put up
more of a fight against Stanford
but a second consecutive solid
singles performance by the Car
dinal sent the Sun Devils packing.
"Stanford is the best team in the
country," Arizona State Coach
Lou Belken said.
ASU slipped to 17-8 (3-6 in Pac
-10 play).
McEnroe bested Holten 6-3, 6-3
and Cathrall disposed of Jeff
Wood 6-4, 6-1 to put the Cardinal
up 2-0.
Wheaton followed with his vic
tory, and Blackman ousted
Gyetko by a 7-6, 3-6, 6-2 score.
Tarango's forehands and return
of serve were too much for Doug
Sachs, as Tarango upended him
6-4, 7-6.
Solomon, upping his dual
match record to 11-1, outlasted
Dan Marting 6-2, 2-6, 6-4.
In doubles play, Wood and Mar
ting defeated sophomore Eric
Peus and freshman Dan Turbow
6-4, 3-6, 6-2 and Solomon and
sophomore Jonathan Kahn beat
Joel Finnigan and Lance Stanley
6-1, 6-4.
