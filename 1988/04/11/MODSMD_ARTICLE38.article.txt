# Track relay team stuns Arkansas
## Two-mile squad flies to a new Stanford record 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Stanford track
and field team sent
a split squad to the
Texas Relays in
Austin, where
everyone had their
own nemesis, but

Stanford took one relay and al
most another from top distance
team Arkansas. For Marc Oleson
it was NCAA double indoor cham
pion Joe Falcon of Arkansas, for
Bill Crowley it was a spiking and
for John Gash it was several thun
derstorms, but Stanford gave
Arkansas a run for its money in
the distance medley and took the
two-mile relay Saturday.
Freshman David Strang was
the top gun on the Stanford two
mile squad, nailing Arkansas with
a final half-mile split unofficially
clocked at 1 minute, 46.5 seconds.
Senior Christian Skoog set up the
win by running a sub-1:50 leg,
dropping six seconds from his
time last week. Senior Steve
Schadler and fifth-year senior
Oleson were the first two legs as
the team broke a 24-year-old
school record.
Strang and Oleson were coming
back from the distance medley
Friday night, where Stanford just
barely missed another title. Soph
omore Crowley ran 800 meters
and handed off to freshman
James Cramton. Strang took the
baton in sixth place and after
three laps put Stanford back in
the hunt.
The final battle pitted Oleson
against NCAA indoor mile cham
pion Falcon. It went right to the
wire, with Falcon kicking to the
line and Oleson just a second be
hind with a 4:01 mile. The team
ended with a time of 9:31.7,
breaking the school record they
set two weeks ago.
Stanford set two new school
records despite thundershowers
that kept senior pole vaulter Gash
from competing in the finals and
a spiking of sophomore Crowley
that knocked out a strong four
by-1,500-meter relay team. Stan
ford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
said "the intent was to go down
and beat up on Southern schools,"
and the Cardinal did well on that
score.
The men's distance team went
against some of the best and came
back with several top marks.
Oleson and Strang have formed
a potent combination in the

middle distances with Schadler
and Crowley, and all four have
qualified for the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship meet in the
1,500 meters.
Several individuals also scored
Pac-10 qualifying marks. Redshirt
freshman Eric Mastalir ran what
Chisam termed "his best race at
Stanford" at Fresno in the 5,000
meters. Running through the heat
in a pack of over 40 runners, he
went out with the leaders, averag
ing a 4:30-mile pace for the first
two miles. Mastalir finished fifth
at 14:07, within striking distance
of the NCAA standards and under
the Pac-10 meet mark. Junior

James Alborough also ran the
5,000 meters, just missing the
Pac-10 standard.
Freshman Jennifer Jauquet
scored 4,500 points in the heptat
halon, exceeding the tentative
Pac-10 mark in that event, al
though the final standard has not
been decided. Sophomore Erica
Wheeler also did well in the field
events, continuing her strong
season by throwing the javelin
172 feet to take second.
Coach Brooks Johnson is opti
mistic about this season. The
team has qualified nearly as many
athletes for the Pac-10 Champi
onships with six weeks left as it

did during the entire season last
year, and a large number will be
going to the NCAA Champion
ships. The Cardinal hopes to be
a force at these two championship
meets.
The Cardinal will race Wash
ington and Notre Dame this Sat
urday at home in the Stanford
Classic "with the intent of fast
and strong performances" to gain
new qualifiers, according to
Chisam. Stanford has also been
working hard to prepare for its
dual meet April 30 with Califor
nia. Cal has traditionally been a
tough opponent, but the Cardinal
thinks this could be its year.

that kept senior pole vaulter Gash
from competing in the finals and
a spiking of sophomore Crowley
that knocked out a strong four
by-1,500-meter relay team. Stan
ford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
said "the intent was to go down
and beat up on Southern schools,"
and the Cardinal did well on that
score.
The men's distance team went
against some of the best and came
back with several top marks.
Oleson and Strang have formed
a potent combination in the

middle distances with Schadler
and Crowley, and all four have
qualified for the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship meet in the
1,500 meters.
Several individuals also scored
Pac-10 qualifying marks. Redshirt
freshman Eric Mastalir ran what
Chisam termed "his best race at
Stanford" at Fresno in the 5,000
meters. Running through the heat
in a pack of over 40 runners, he
went out with the leaders, averag
ing a 4:30-mile pace for the first
two miles. Mastalir finished fifth
at 14:07, within striking distance
of the NCAA standards and under
the Pac-10 meet mark. Junior

James Alborough also ran the
5,000 meters, just missing the
Pac-10 standard.
Freshman Jennifer Jauquet
scored 4,500 points in the heptat
halon, exceeding the tentative
Pac-10 mark in that event, al
though the final standard has not
been decided. Sophomore Erica
Wheeler also did well in the field
events, continuing her strong
season by throwing the javelin
172 feet to take second.
Coach Brooks Johnson is opti
mistic about this season. The
team has qualified nearly as many
athletes for the Pac-10 Champi
onships with six weeks left as it

did during the entire season last
year, and a large number will be
going to the NCAA Champion
ships. The Cardinal hopes to be
a force at these two championship
meets.
The Cardinal will race Wash
ington and Notre Dame this Sat
urday at home in the Stanford
Classic "with the intent of fast
and strong performances" to gain
new qualifiers, according to
Chisam. Stanford has also been
working hard to prepare for its
dual meet April 30 with Califor
nia. Cal has traditionally been a
tough opponent, but the Cardinal
thinks this could be its year.

Freshman David Strang is already proving himself to be one of the top middle distance runners in
Stanford history.
