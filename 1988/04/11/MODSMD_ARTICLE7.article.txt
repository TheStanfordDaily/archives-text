# Grape boycott plans dry up
## 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
A planned "educational blitz" to inform
students about a campus boycott of grapes
has fizzled due to a lack of student interest
and charges of bias.
Months after MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
student group, began a program designed
to allow individual dorms and houses to
vote on whether they wanted to boycott
grapes, only a few houses have actually
voted.
Synergy and 553 Mayfield have con
firmed independently that they support the
boycott, but no residences have notified
Residential Education that they intend to
institutionalize the boycott in any signifi
cant way.
"None of the results have been commun
icated to us," said Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Alice Supton.
According to Synergy Resident Assistant
Laura Bonk, Synergy residents decided to
stop buying grapes on their own initiative
before MEChA began its educational cam

paign. She said the house strongly supports
MEChA's initiative.
MEChA had originally planned to dis
tribute information, host a debate and give
presentations to dorms concerning the
boycott. Junior Marc Pizarro, a member
of MEChA, said the group began by dis
tributing information, but that the pro
boycott information was distributed far in
advance of the anti-boycott fliers, leading
many students to assail the campaign for
being biased.
The group eventually "dusted the whole
thing because people thought it was overly
biased," Pizarro said.
As a result, a planned debate between
representatives from the Grape Workers
and Farmers Coalition and the United
Farm Workers was canceled, and presen
tations scheduled by MEChA in residences
were called off.
Hoping to resurrect the issue in some
form, Pizarro said MEChA is "working
with Residential Education to make a new
plan." Yet, he would not confirm
a schedule for any possible revival
of the plan, though.
In the meantime, residences
that wish to hear a presentation
may request one from MEChA
and vote on the issue.
Joline McQuillan, food service
manager at Florence Moore Hall,

said no dorms had requested a
boycott. Although some individual
students had commented concern
ing the issue earlier this year,
McQuillan said she has not heard
any complaints recently.
However, she added that if any
dorm voted for a student boycott
of grapes, Food Service would
honor the request.
Reaction to the issue from res
idences around campus reflected
mostly apathy, but also a feeling
that the movement was biased.
