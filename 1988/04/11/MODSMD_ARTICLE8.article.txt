# Anti-apartheid group forms

### Gaby Banks 
Frustrated by the Board of Trustees'
recent rejection of a proposal to strengthen
Stanford's divestment policy, a group of
Stanford students has formed a new or
ganization to educate the Stanford com
munity about issues in South Africa and
to pressure the trustees to re-evaluate the
University's policy of selective disinvest
ment.
Members of Students for a Free South
Africa hope to bring the issues of apartheid
and divestment back to the forefront of
campus debate. SFSA follows in the
footsteps of the now-defunct anti-apartheid
group Stanford Out of South Africa, which
lobbied for total divestment from 1985 to
1987.
According to Mia Lewis, a graduate stu
dent in the School of Education and co
organizer of SFSA, the new group is not
just a renamed SOSA, although many of

its goals are similar.
Lewis said Stanford student action
against apartheid has re-organized now
"because the situation [in South Africa 1
has gotten worse recently and because we
were completely disgusted that the trustees
are unable to take a stand on apartheid."
According to Lewis, South Africa's re
strictions on news coverage of current un
rest there has led many Americans to be
lieve that turbulence in the country has
died down. To combat this perception —
which Lewis considers a victory of South
Africa's government" — SFSA hopes to
broaden student awareness of the daily
events occurring in South Africa, she said.
SFSA member Hanna Rosin, a freshman,
also decried the press restrictions in South
Africa."The press ban and the lack of in
formation coming from South Africa has
been effective in silencing students about
apartheid," said Rosin, adding
that she hopes "SFSA can make
some noise again about the issue."
The South African government
imposed a press ban in 1985 as
part of the national state of emer
gency then in effect. By 1986, re
strictions on the media had ex
panded to prohibit international
communication of all anti
apartheid activities.
Internal restrictions have since
been strengthened to the extent
that all of the 17 anti-apartheid
organizations within South Africa
have either been banned or
severly restricted, according to
Lewis.
The formation of SFSA marks
the third generation of anti

apartheid activity at Stanford. In
1979, 294 demonstrators were ar
rested here at an Old Union sit-in
protesting Stanford's investment
in companies that do business
with South Africa.
More recently, in the spring of
1985, students staged another
protest, some camping out for two
weeks in front of the president's
office in the inner Quad.
Out of this protest emerged
Stanford Out of South Africa, a
group that continued to work to
change Stanford's policy of selec
tive divestment. After the wave
of pro-divestment demonstrations
died down across the nation,
SOSA lost membership and its
voice on campus diminished sig
nificantly.
SFSA hopes to pressure the
trustees to adopt a policy of total
divestment, or selling of shares,
from companies that do business

in South Africa, rather than selec
tive disinvestment, or urging com
panies to withdraw from the na
tion.
In a vote on March 8, the trus
tees reserved the right to abstain
from evaluating donation con
tracts of companies such as
Hewlett-Packard, a mtyor bene
factor of Stanford that strongly
advocates remaining in South
Africa.
In effect, the trustees voted to
either approve or abstain on all
shareholder resolutions calling for
a company to withdraw
South Africa, or disinvest. The
trustees rejected motions for total
divestment.
Critics of the decision call it
ineffective because an abstention
constitutes neither a positive nor
a negative judgment of a company
doing business in South Africa.

Another goal of the group is to
raise funds to support other anti
apartheid organizations. For ex
ample, SFSA supports the Free
South Africa Fund, an alternative
alumni donation fund set up by
students and faculty in 1986 with
the purpose of attracting support
from alumni who do not want
their donations to the University
invested in South Africa.
At the national level, SFSA will
lobby congressmen and senators
to support anti-apartheid legisla
tion, and to raise funds to support
anti-apartheid groups.
The new group includes mem
bers of the Stanford African Stu
dent Association, advocates of the
Free South Africa Fund, and
other concerned students, many
of whom were involved in a
SWOPSI course offered last quar
ter titled "The United States and
South Africa."
