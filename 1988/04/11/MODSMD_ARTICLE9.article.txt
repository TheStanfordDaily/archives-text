# Davies reopens tenure wounds
## 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
The Norman Davies tenure suit
against Stanford, just last month
considered closed, may soon be
open again.
Seeking to clarify an "exces
sively general" court statement,
Stanford lawyers have withdrawn
one of the arguments they used
to defend the University against
a $9 million suit filed by former
Visiting Prof, of History Norman
Davies.
The switch by the University
may give Davies the chance to
appeal his case.
Understandably pleased by the
University's move, Davies, in a
telephone interview from London,
said he is "not surprised" by the
latest development because Stan
ford had made an "absurd argu
ment."
"Contrary to what the Univer
sity has been leading everyone to
believe, this case is not over," said
Davies, who is a full professor at
the University of London. "Their
position will collapse."
Davies sued Stanford and 29

history professors after he was
denied tenure here in 1986, claim
ing he was professionally
"defamed" by the rejection. He
lost the suit on March 2, when
the Santa Clara County Superior
Court ruled that the University
had not discriminated against
him.
Although the pertinent legal
documents were not available last
night, University Staff Counsel
Iris Brest said that the University
wishes to clear up a "misun
derstanding" of Stanford's posi
tion in the case.
The University had previously
submitted a brief that did not ac
curately reflect its academic free
dom policy. Brest said the new
brief, presented to the court on
March 21, reiterates the policy in
more precise language, stating
that visiting professors have fewer
privileges than tenured profes
sors.
Brest said the University sub
mitted the brief because it didn't
want the court's decision to leave
outsiders with the impression
that it discriminated against visit
ing professors. But it remained
unclear, and Brest would not spec
ulate, why the University chose
to muddle a case that seemed
settled a month ago.
Stanford had successfully
argued in court that Davies, as a
visiting professor, could not claim

access to certain University griev
ance channels regarding tenure.
Davies, on the other hand, con
tended that because he was denied
access to these channels, his ac
ademic freedom was com
promised.
Stanford's arguments were
based on specific language con
tained in the Statement of Aca
demic Freedom found in the Uni
versity's Faculty Handbook.
Shocked by the History Depart
ment's 12-11 vote turning down

his application in 1986, Davies,
considered by many to be the
world's leading Polish historian
writing in English, had sought to
have a hearing in the department
to contest the rejection. But such
hearings can only be obtained by
tenured and special non-tenured
faculty in exceptional cases.
Brest said yesterday that Stan
ford does extend academic protec
tion to visiting professors, but
that they do not normally have
the same access to official proce

dures for redressing academic
grievances.
She said Stanford is not making
a "substantive claim" and that
"nothing turns on this."
Davies' attorney, former Con
gressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
expressed surprise that Stanford
would meddle with a successful
decision.
"This is one of the most
peculiar things I've seen in over
20 years of law practice," he said.

According to McCloskey, the
University was "understandably
embarrassed" by its position on
the case, even though they won
the original decision. "If Stanford
goes on record as saying the State
ment on Academic Freedom
doesn't apply to guest professors,
they'll never get a guest professor
again," he said.
Davies echoed McCloskey's
statement. "Stanford can hardly
be called a bastion of academic
freedom if that freedom only ap

plies to certain people," he said.
He added that this development
is "much more serious than Iris
Brest would have people believe.
This is more than just putting a
few words straight."
McCloskey said the court will
determine later this week how
much of the original decision
hinged on this "misunderstand
ing," and will then decide whether
Stanford in effect misled the court
regarding its overall policy.

privileges than tenured profes
sors.
Brest said the University sub
mitted the brief because it didn't
want the court's decision to leave
outsiders with the impression
that it discriminated against visit
ing professors. But it remained
unclear, and Brest would not spec
ulate, why the University chose
to muddle a case that seemed
settled a month ago.
Stanford had successfully
argued in court that Davies, as a
visiting professor, could not claim

access to certain University griev
ance channels regarding tenure.
Davies, on the other hand, con
tended that because he was denied
access to these channels, his ac
ademic freedom was com
promised.
Stanford's arguments were
based on specific language con
tained in the Statement of Aca
demic Freedom found in the Uni
versity's Faculty Handbook.
Shocked by the History Depart
ment's 12-11 vote turning down

his application in 1986, Davies,
considered by many to be the
world's leading Polish historian
writing in English, had sought to
have a hearing in the department
to contest the rejection. But such
hearings can only be obtained by
tenured and special non-tenured
faculty in exceptional cases.
Brest said yesterday that Stan
ford does extend academic protec
tion to visiting professors, but
that they do not normally have
the same access to official proce

dures for redressing academic
grievances.
She said Stanford is not making
a "substantive claim" and that
"nothing turns on this."
Davies' attorney, former Con
gressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
expressed surprise that Stanford
would meddle with a successful
decision.
"This is one of the most
peculiar things I've seen in over
20 years of law practice," he said.

According to McCloskey, the
University was "understandably
embarrassed" by its position on
the case, even though they won
the original decision. "If Stanford
goes on record as saying the State
ment on Academic Freedom
doesn't apply to guest professors,
they'll never get a guest professor
again," he said.
Davies echoed McCloskey's
statement. "Stanford can hardly
be called a bastion of academic
freedom if that freedom only ap

plies to certain people," he said.
He added that this development
is "much more serious than Iris
Brest would have people believe.
This is more than just putting a
few words straight."
McCloskey said the court will
determine later this week how
much of the original decision
hinged on this "misunderstand
ing," and will then decide whether
Stanford in effect misled the court
regarding its overall policy.
