# Davies reopens tenure wounds
## 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
The Norman Davies tenure suit
against Stanford, just last month
considered closed, may soon be
open again.
Seeking to clarify an "exces
sively general" court statement,
Stanford lawyers have withdrawn
one of the arguments they used
to defend the University against
a $9 million suit filed by former
Visiting Prof, of History Norman
Davies.
The switch by the University
may give Davies the chance to
appeal his case.
Understandably pleased by the
University's move, Davies, in a
telephone interview from London,
said he is "not surprised" by the
latest development because Stan
ford had made an "absurd argu
ment."
"Contrary to what the Univer
sity has been leading everyone to
believe, this case is not over," said
Davies, who is a full professor at
the University of London. "Their
position will collapse."
Davies sued Stanford and 29

history professors after he was
denied tenure here in 1986, claim
ing he was professionally
"defamed" by the rejection. He
lost the suit on March 2, when
the Santa Clara County Superior
Court ruled that the University
had not discriminated against
him.
Although the pertinent legal
documents were not available last
night, University Staff Counsel
Iris Brest said that the University
wishes to clear up a "misun
derstanding" of Stanford's posi
tion in the case.
The University had previously
submitted a brief that did not ac
curately reflect its academic free
dom policy. Brest said the new
brief, presented to the court on
March 21, reiterates the policy in
more precise language, stating
that visiting professors have fewer
privileges than tenured profes
sors.
Brest said the University sub
mitted the brief because it didn't
want the court's decision to leave
outsiders with the impression
