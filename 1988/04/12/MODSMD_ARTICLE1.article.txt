# Campus asbestos may be linked to worker's cancer
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
An employee who complained
to University officials for eight
years about exposed asbestos at
Tresidder Union has contracted
lung cancer, and his disease may
be linked to repeated contact with
an asbestos-covered pipe in the
bakery there.
When Frank Kutch, who has
been a baker at Tresidder for over
11 years, was diagnosed recently
with terminal cancer, his doctor
suggested that asbestos exposure
may have contributed to his dis
ease. Kutch said he then made
the connection between the can
cer and his daily contact with as
bestos in the cramped bakery.
Kutch's doctor was unavailable
for comment yesterday.
According to University offi
cials, the pipe will be removed
today. Its removal had not previ
ously been a high priority, al
though asbestos at Tresidder is
monitored as part of a University
wide process.
The pipe in question, which is
wrapped with old, dusty asbestos,
is in the corner of the bakery
kitchen and is frequently in close
contact with pans and utensils.

The pipe is frequently
in close contact with
pans and utensils.

Kutch, who retired about two
weeks ago, first requested its
removal eight years ago not only
for health concerns, but also be
cause of a space shortage.
According to a November letter
circulated by the University con
cerning asbestos levels in residen
ces, pipe coverings such as the
one in the bakery constitute one
of "the most important sources
of asbestos contamination in
structures."
Tresidder, University officials
and Kutch himself emphasized
that one of the reasons Kutch's
complaints went unheeded —
leaving the piping in place years
after it stopped functioning — is
the high turnover of management
in recent years.
Bobbi Braden, director of Tres
idder, who began work in Septem
ber, said she had never seen any
record of Kutch's complaints.
Other workers, however, said they
remember his protests. "He
talked to the management

upstairs," said A.K. Lee, the
retired head of maintenance who
was also treated for cancer last
year.
Braden said she became aware
of the asbestos-covered pipe in De
cember when she was taking a
tour of the facility, and was "con
cerned" aboout it then. Conse
quently, she asked Health and
Safety to conduct another air
sampling, but no remedial action
was taken until this week.
The University is continuing a
three- to four-year survey aimed
at controlling asbestos on campus.
Braden said the Department of
Health and Safety "told us we
were not as high a priority as
other places on campus."
"When we learned an employee
had cancer," Braden said, "we
were moved up on the schedule."
Two measurements of the as
bestos level in the bakery were
taken in the past year, according
to Jeffery Bramlett, a Health and
Safety specialist in charge of the
asbestos program. The results of
the samples showed no unsafe
conditions, and Chuck Mann, an
Operations and Maintenance su
pervisor, said the low reading was

his contact with the pipe.
the main reason work at the
bakery had been deferred.
Nonetheless, Kutch said he and
a few of the other workers were
concerned that the readings were
inaccurate because the tests did
not reflect the worn condition of
the pipe, which has bits of as
bestos flaking off it. He said he
could often "see dust flying up
from the pipe."
Bramlett said he was unaware
of this, and said if he had been,
he would have been "worried."
Other bakers said they have
noticed unusual coughing and
throat irritation, both symptoms
of asbestos exposure, particularly
when the pipe is shaken acciden
tally.
Tresidder workers such as
Kutch are not hired by the Uni
versity, which owns and main
tains the building, but contracted
by the Marriott Corp., which runs
the businesses in the building as
a vendor.

The workers are not part of a
union and have little protection,
according to Linda Crouse, chief
steward of the United Stanford
Workers.
Crouse said workers are often
"intimidated" to speak out against
poor working conditions because
they are afraid they will lose their
jobs. She said she has had workers
slip her questions about policy
and unfair practices because they
do not want to complain aloud.
Ralph Buchanan, director of
Operations and Maintenance, said
he was not aware of the situation,
but that any employee was enti
tled to file a claim with his or
her employer for a work-related
injury. He said in this case, "the
employer (Marriott) would prob
ably file a suit with Stanford if
there was illness resulting from
work" in a building maintained
by Stanford.
Crouse said that "when people
are exposed unnecessarily to
hazards such as asbestos, you're
playing statistical roulette with
workers' lives."
Asbestos is known to cause
several diseases, including lung

cancer. It also causes a rarer form
of cancer called mesothelioma,
which is a rapidly fatal form of
lung cancer that can be caused
by lesser amounts of asbestos ex
posure.
Although Kutch has smoked for
years, he said that his doctor did
not believe cigarettes could cause
the sudden appearance of malign
tumors as developed in Kutch's
lungs. That belief prompted the
doctor to ask about possible as
bestos exposure. Smoking ag
gravates the effect of asbestos
contamination by weakening the
lungs' resistance.
Kutch said he is not sure what
his next step will be in following
up the possible link between his
working conditions and the ad
vent of the illness. If any connec
tion is determined, he said he
hopes he could "at least get some
thing to help my family after I
die."
Kutch said Sunday he "is not
afraid of dying. It's my family I'm
worried about. I have grand
children and I wanted to live a
little longer to enjoy them."
