# 'Styroglobe' encourages recycling, saving ozone
## 
### John Griffin 
Calling for more recycling and
less styrofoam, members of Stu
dents for Environmental Action
have displayed their "Styro
globe" sculpture in White Plaza
since Monday.
The sculpture is a hollow, six
foot-wide sphere painted to rep
resent the earth. Mounted on
square plywood supports, the
globe has a chicken-wire frame
covered with hundreds of
styrofoam cups. Group mem
bers gathered the cups from
Tresidder customers Monday af
ternoon.
Some of the information and
opinions on display refer to recy
cling. One poster states that the
Stanford Recycling Center's
work has saved 60,000 trees and
diverted tons of waste from the
local landfill. Another promotes
the interdorm recycling contest
which the organization is now
running.
The other concern of the dis
play is styrofoam. Styrofoam
poses two difficulties, said

senior Laure Haak, a group
member. "One problem is with
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
used in blowing and manufac
turing processes of some
styrofoam."
CFCs destroy atmospheric
ozone, increasing ultraviolet ra
diation and skin cancer on
earth. Haak said that while
styrofoam production creates
fewer CFCs than refrigeration,
soft foam production and
aerosol use, the student group
focuses on styrofoam because
"everyone can do something
about it."
The second problem with
styrofoam, Haak said, is that it
is not recyclable or biode
gradable.
Junior Kristen Brown, a rep
resentative of the organization,
met yesterday with Paul
Komelasky, Tresidder's new di
rector of food service, to discuss
the use of styrofoam there.
Komelasky said that Tresid
der uses 18,000 styrofoam cups
per week. He added that Tres
idder may begin programs to

reduce styrofoam use next fall,
perhaps by selling sturdy plastic
cups to customers for repeated
use.
When Brown asked if Tresid
der might change to reusable or
paper supplies, Komelasky said
it would be unlikely in the near
future due to Tresidder's "mtgor
redesign in the next few years,
including dishwashing facil
ities," and because paper prod
ucts cost two or three times as
much as styrofoam.
At least two other California
universities have recently
slashed their styrofoam use. In
response to a 3,000-signature
petition, UC-Santa Cruz re
cently changed from styrofoam
to paper for its service of 6,000
residence-hall meals, said Greg
Howe, UCSC's general manager
of food service.
And at UC-Davis, the deli,
pub and other cash-driven
eateries use only paper. A pro
duction manager for the Davis
eateries said the change gener
ally brought "a favorable reac
tion."
