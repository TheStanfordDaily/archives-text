## Coin machines installed

No longer will students be
forced to boldly go where no stu
dent has gone before when search
ing for those elusive quarters for
laundry machines. Over the next
two weeks an outside contractor
is scheduled to place change mac
hines in dormitories.
Web Service Co., which
manages all of the laundry mac
hines on campus, will this week
begin placing machines that
change $1 and $5 bills in eight
campus locations, according to
Suzanne Tamiesie, manager of
student housing operations.
Each of the following locations
will receive one machine: Bur
bank, Crothers, Crothers
Memorial, Toyon, Branner,
Lagunita, Elliot Program Center
and the Row Cluster Building at
672 Lomita Drive.
Web will wait to see how much
use the new machines receive and
how well they perform before in
stalling more. However, Tamiesie
predicted that the machines will
be heavily used and more will be
installed.
Currently, change machines are
located only in Tresidder Union's

Hall laundry room.
The machines were installed at
the urging of junior Leonard Ad
ler, a member of the Council of
Presidents and a candidate for re
election on the Energizers slate.
Adler approached Keith Guy, di
rector of housing and food service,
in the fall of 1986 with the idea
of placing the machines in dormi
tories.
That winter, Guy placed a ma
chine in the Wilbur laundry room
— which serves 700 people — on
a trial basis.
Guy and Web were concerned

that the machine would be van
dalized. But the trial period ended
without incident, and Adler con
tinued to press for machines in
dormitories around campus.
Web then moved to obtain mac
hines from other locations in the
Bay Area and place them in dor
mitories.
Adler said the installation of
the machines took over a year
and a half not because the Uni-"
versity resisted the idea, but be
cause the University has a "longer
cycle than students" for imple
menting change.
