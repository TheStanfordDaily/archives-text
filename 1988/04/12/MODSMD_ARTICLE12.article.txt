# Alcohol education program promotes safe drinking habits
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
In response to increasing awareness of
alcohol-related incidents on campus, the
Cowell Health Promotion Program is cre
ating the Stanford Alcohol Risk Reduc
tion Project, a new student-run alcohol
education program.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said he feels the new program, which
will focus on peer education, could be
"the best alcohol education program in
the country" because it "avoids some of
the common mistakes" of other pro
grams. The alcohol reduction program
does not presume that all alcohol use is
bad, nor does it assume that knowledge
alone will control behavior, he said. "The

heaviest drinkers know the most about
it."

The program, which is
scheduled to begin next
fall, differs from previous
efforts because it focuses
on the average student
drinker rather than the
problem drinker. Staff
has always been available
at Cowell to work with
problem drinkers and ad
vise them about treat-

ment, according to Vincent D'Andrea,
substance abuse coordinator for the coun
seling services at the Health Center. This
service will continue and work with the
project, which will provide direct and in
direct referrals, he said.

Louise Miller, the Cowell Health
promotion specialist who has overseen
the program's formation, emphasized
that the purpose of the program is not
to discourage drinking; it is to help devise
ways of using alcohol more safely.
A five-student planning group, formed
two weeks ago, is currently doing social
market research in order to create a stu
dent consulting service and assess the
best methods for encouraging less risky
behavior.
The consulting service will consist
mainly of a self-administered alcohol risk
appraisal test and a creative party plan
ning service to help students give "better
as well as safer parties," said senior Grant
Winfrey, a Branner resident assistant
who serves on the group. However,

Winfrey said he worried students would
interpret the service as an anti-alcohol
campaign when actually its purpose is
"to strengthen the other parts of the
party that aren't alcohol-related."
The project will concentrate on fresh
men and fraternity members, Miller said.
"If we get freshmen right when they
come in, the messages might have a long
term effect."
Miller has been working with the In
terfraternity Council since the beginning
of the year, when IFC president Vinnie
Frost approached her and asked for help
in combatting the alcohol problem. To
gether they have develped a new psychol
ogy course, "The American Drinking Cul
ture."
The course is a model for student con

suiting training and will most likely pro
vide the first consultants next year, said
sophomore Ted DesMaisons, Miller's stu
dent assistant.
Once implemented, the biggest chal
lenge to the program will be finding an
effective way to evaluate it and prove
that behavior has been altered, Miller
said. "It's very hard to evaluate preven
tion. It's measuring a non-event."
Despite this challenge, Miller is opti
mistic about the project's future. "I was
really quite surprised by all the support
I've gotten," she said. "The key to success
is the support of the students."
DesMaisons predicted that student in
volvement in the program will be the key
to a favorable response.
