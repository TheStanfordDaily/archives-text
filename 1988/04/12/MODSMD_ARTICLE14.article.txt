Scientists patent altered mouse
WASHINGTON — In a decision that is a
milestone in the efforts to commercialize
biotechnology, the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office said yesterday that it has approved a
patent for a genetically altered mouse, the
first time a patent has been issued for an
animal.
Details of the application will be announced
at a press conference today. But congressional
sources said the patent has been granted to
researchers at Harvard University, who have
genetically altered the animal for use in cancer
related laboratory research.
Man-made life organisms have been patent
able under U.S. law since a landmark Supreme
Court decision in 1980, but today's announce
ment will mark the first time that patent law
will protect a genetic change in a higher life
form.
Licensing rights for the patent, which could
have wide commercial possibilities in cancer
laboratories, are held by Du Pont Co., which
financed the Harvard research. But while the
Patent Office decision was greeted warmly by
officials of the biotechnology industry and may
provide a boon for scientific research, it comes
at a time of mounting ethical questions about
the use and ownership of artificially created
life forms.
Catholic bishops: Sexism sinful
A panel of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops
released a draft of a pastoral letter on women
yesterday that condemns sexism as a sin —
a "social and moral evil" — but reiterates the
church's ban on women priests.
The 164-page letter, which will be the topic
of church discussions around the nation, says
that the church has perpetuated sexism by
historically interpreting scriptures as teaching
that women were inferior to men.
"We therefore regret and confess our indi
vidual and collective failures to respond to
women as they deserve," the panel said. "We
call the people of God to join us in personal
and corporate contrition for the sins of sexism
that violate the basic tenets of our faith."
The pastoral letter, which the bishops
decided to write five years ago, will represent
official church teaching if it is approved by
the full body of nearly 380 bishops in the
United States.
The document is expected to raise contro
versy within the church's all-male hierarchy.
While it upholds official church teachings in
areas where the pope has forbidden dissent,
the letter also shows compassion for women
who disagree with those positions and even
challenges lesser prohibitions on which Rome
has not barred debate.
But the bishops reiterated official church
teachings that ban women from the priest
hood. They acknowledged that many women
believe that womens' ordination is essential
to gaining equality and cannot accept the
church's reasons for maintaining an all-male
priesthood. Yet, the bishops wrote, "The
church is not free to depart from the tradi
tion."
Maryland restricts handguns
ANNAPOLIS, Md., — Gun control advocates
yesterday celebrated a dramatic turnabout in
the Maryland General Assembly, and said the
unique measure passed yesterday that effec
tively outlaws cheap handguns could be a
model for other states.
The House of Delegates' 95-to-41 vote to
approve the measure will make Maryland one
of only a handful of states with laws restricting
the sale and manufacture of hanguns, and
was a rare legislative defeat for the National
Rifle Association, which had lobbied exten
sively against it.
It was also a surprising conclusion to a
battle over gun control that proponents just
a week ago felt they would lose. At the time,
the Senate had killed a similar measure to
ban Saturday night specials and had passed
a bill that would have overturned a landmark
Maryland court decision that was the envy of
gun control advocates across the country.
But the change in the 188-member legisla
ture came partly because gun control advocates
adopted the lobbying techniques that they say
are usually the specialty of the NRA.
Pakistan links blast to Soviets
WASHINGTON — The devastating explo
sions at a Pakistani ammunition dump that
killed at least 93 people yesterday were trig
gered by a coordinated sabotage attack appar
ently carried out by supporters of the pro-
Soviet regime in Afghanistan, sources yester
day quoted Pakistani military officials as tell
ing the United States.
The attack, seen by U.S. intelligence analysts
as an escalation of the recent Soviet campaign
to discourage Pakistan's support for the anti-
Soviet rebels in Afghanistan, was touched off
by three incendiary devices carried to the scene
by trucks bearing Afghan license plates, these
sources said.
The U.S. sources, who refused to be iden
tified, said the explosions wiped out a mtyor
source of CIA-supplied tactical assault weap
ons for the U.S.-backed moujahedeen resis
tance forces battling the Soviet-supported gov
ernment of in Afghanistan.
The weapons lost in the blast — including
Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, anti-tank weap
ons, assault rockets and mines — leave the
resistance critically short of the sorts of arms
needed to mount a final offensive against the
Afghan capital of Kabul, two sources said.
