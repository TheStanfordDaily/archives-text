# Hijackers kill second Kuwaiti hostage
## 
### 
LARNACA, Cyprus — The
hijackers of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet
shot and killed another hostage
yesterday at Larnaca airport and
threw his body from the plane to
press their demands for fuel.
The body of the victim, believed
to be one of three Kuwaiti military
officers on board the flight, was
tossed onto the airport apron
shortly after the expiration of one
of several deadlines the hijackers
set during the day for the Boeing
747 to be refueled. v
Announcing his death, the
hijackers threatened to "take
more dangerous steps" unless
their demands were met. Later,
after nearly three tense hours of
silence, they put one of the

hostages on the radio to plead
with Cypriot authorities for fuel.
The man killed yesterday was
the second hostage to be slain by
the hijackers since the Kuwait
Airways jetliner arrived in Lar
naca's small seaside airport Fri
day night following a harrowing
flight across the Middle East from
Iran. Another man, also identified
as a military officer, was killed
Saturday to dramatize the
demand for fuel.
Yesterday's slaying appeared to
come as a deeper shock to Cypriot
authorities because it also effec
tively killed the hope that nego
tiators earlier had raised for an
imminent end to the hyacking,
now in its eighth day.
