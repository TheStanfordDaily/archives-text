# 'Emperor' sweeps Oscars
## Michael Douglas, Cher win best actor, actress 
### 
HOLLYWOOD — Bernardo Bertolucci's
"The Last Emperor" dominated the 60th
Academy Awards last night, winning best
picture and eight other Oscars during an
evening that was heavily dominated by ex
pected winners.
It was the most victories since "West
Side Story" won 10 Oscars in the 1962
awards. "Ben-Hur" captured 11 Oscars in
its 12 nominations in the 1960 awards,
the Academy record for one motion picture.
The 47-year-old Italian filmmaker, who
had never previously won an Oscar, was
named best director and shared a statuette
for best adapted screenplay with writer
Mark Peploe.
The Columbia Pictures production also
was honored for art direction, costume
design, sound editing, film editing, original
score and cinematography.
"Moonstruck," a Norman Jewison
directed comedy about the travails of a
Brooklyn Italian family, garnered three
statuettes — including Cher for best
actress, Olympia Dukakis for best support
ing actress and best screenplay.
But "Broadcast News," directed by
James Brooks; "Hope and Glory," directed
by John Boorman; "Fatal Attraction," di
rected by Adrian Lyne, and "Empire of the
Sun," directed by Steven Spielberg, were
all shut out despite multiple nominations.
Cher, who had been a heavy favorite,
was honored for her portrayal of a widowed
career woman whose loves throw the fic
tional Castorini family into turmoil. The
42-year-old rock star-turned-actress had
not previously won an Oscar. She was
nominated for her supporting role in the
1983 film "Silkwood."
"I want to really say something," she
said. "When I was little my mother said,
'I want you to be something,' and I guess
this represents 23 or 24 years of my work,
and I've never won anything before from
my peers. I'm really, really happy."

Michael Douglas won the best actor
award for his portrayal of corrupt financier
Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street." The 43-
year-old had been an expected winner, even
though the film — written and directed
by previous Oscar-winner Oliver Stone —
did not receive any other nominations.
An epic in the mold of past winners
"Amadeus" (presented in 1985) and "Out
of Africa" (presented in 1986), "The Last
Emperor" followed the life of Chinese Em
peror Pu Yi from the time he assumed the
throne in 1908 at the age of 3, through
his years in a prison camp, until his death
as an obscure private citizen in 1967.
Bertolucci had previously been
nominated for directing "Last Tango in
Paris" in 1973, and for writing "The Con
formist" in 1971.
He said the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences was something that he,
as a European, "really didn't belong to"
in the past. When he received the nomina
tions, however, "everything changed im
mediately. I started to learn the rules of
the game. To check the odds."
Sean Connery, a sentimental favorite,
won for best supporting actor for his
portrayal of a hardened beat cop-turned
gangster buster in"The Untouchables."
Despite his work in 44 films, including
the lead in seven James Bond movies, the
57-year-old Connery had never been
nominated.
"If such a thing as a wish accompanied
this award, mine would be that we ended
the writers strike," Connery said.
Connery told reporters backstage that
the month-long strike by the Writers Guild
of America had caused "almost irreparable"
damage to his movie plans. He said he
wanted to begin work on the next Indiana
Jones film, scheduled for release by
Paramount in the summer of 1989, but
could not proceed, because the script
needed work.
