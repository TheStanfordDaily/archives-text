# Speakes authored Reagan 'quotes'

WASHINGTON - Former
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes, in memoirs published
this week, recounts two inci
dents in which he manufac
tured quotes and attributed
them to President Reagan, in
cluding a widely reported state
ment issued when Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorba
chev held their historic first
meeting in Geneva in 1985.
Speakes, who became chief
spokesman for Reagan when
James Brady was shot in 1981,
recounts in his book, "Speaking
Out," that he made up the
quotes because he was fearful
of the Soviet "communications
juggernaut" at Geneva.
Noting that Gorbachev had
made several quotable state
ments about Soviet desires for
peace, while Reagan said little,
Speakes writes that he in
structed press aide Mark Wein
berg "to draft some quotes for
the president.
"I polished the quotes and
told the press that, while the
two leaders stood together at
the end of one session, the pres
ident said to Gorbachev, 'There
is much that divides us, but I
believe the world breathes
easier because we are talking
here together.' "
In an interview Monday,
Speakes said making up pres
idential quotes "is not lying.
. . . When you're a press secre
tary, you develop a bond of un

derstanding with the president
so that you think like the pres
ident. "
Another Reagan quote from
that summit that Speakes said
"we manufactured that
received extensive play in the
press was, 'Our differences are
serious, but so is our commit
ment to improving understand

xng.
He adds, however, that in
retrospect, it was "clearly
wrong to take such liberties"
because the Soviets could have
said that Reagan had said no
such things.
The other incident recounted
in detail in the book involved
Reagan's sessions with his
Cabinet and congressional
leaders after a Soviet fighter
plane shot down a Korean Air
Lines passenger jet in 1983.
At the sessions, Speakes
recounts that Secretary of
State George Shultz and others
offered suggestions on retalia
tion and characterized the in
cident as a disaster for the
Soviets in which the entire
world was on one 3iie and the
Soviets on the other.
Speakes says he decided to
take Shultz's words and put
them in Reagan's mouth.
"Since the president had had
almost nothing to say during
the . . . meetings, I made pres
idential quotes out of Shultz's
comments . . "he writes,
