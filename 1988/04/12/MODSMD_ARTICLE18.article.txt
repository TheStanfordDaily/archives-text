LIMA, Peru â€” Peruvian President
Alan Garcia Perez pledged yesterday
to attack his nation's enormous coca
crop with newly developed aerial her
bicides after tests on their safety and
effectiveness are completed, Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 said.
Aerial spraying is an extremely
sensitive political issue in poverty
ridden Peru, where farmers are
growing an estimated 504,000 acres
of coca leaf a year, making it by far
the nation's largest cash crop. Nar
cotics trafficking, primarily in cocaine,
accounts for about $700 million an
nually, or nearly 30 percent of Peru's
official foreign exchange earnings.
Cocaine is a derivative of the leaves
of the coca plant.
Meese, who is conducting a presi
dential mission on the Latin cocaine
crisis, said that Garcia's promise is
significant because the sometimes
difficult Peruvian president has

greater ideological differences with the
Reagan administration than the
leaders of the other four nations with
whom the attorney general is meeting
on his week-long tour of the region.
In a 55-minute meeting with Meese,
Garcia said that he wanted Americans
to remember him as the Peruvian pres
ident who provided the leadership
needed to wipe out the coca plants.
They are the source of most of the
illicit cocaine that enters the United
States.

A beaming Meese called Garcia's
remarks "the most significant state
ment of support" he had received from
South American leaders thus far on
their willingness to deal with the
cocaine problem. In addition to
eradication efforts, Meese and Garcia
discussed expansion of Peruvian police
efforts against cocaine laboratory and
production facilities.
Limited manual eradication efforts
by Peru's police and military forces
have had little success, particularly
with the hundreds of thousands of
acres of coca crop in the Upper Hua-
Uaga Valley.
Efforts against the crop in the valley
and in other remote areas have been
hampered by the military's need to
cope with terrorist organizations, in
cluding the Sendero Luminoso, or
"Shining Path," and the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement.
Meese said that the herbicide being

considered for use in Peru, known as
tebuthurion, was already being widely
applied in the Southwest United States
to clear brush. He said the chemical
was being tested with Peruvian soil
brought to U.S. laboratory facilities,
adding that initial results of field tests
show it to be effective.
According to State Department es
timates, Peru could eradicate 24,000
acres of coca plants a year with effec
tive and safe aerial herbicides. If the
herbicide is available by the beginning
of 1989, which Meese said was possi
ble, Peru could eradicate at least one
tenth of its coca crop.
Meese and Garcia also discussed an
other potential weapon in the cocaine
battle that has never been used, the
U.S.-Peru extradition treaty on nar
cotics offenses.
The two men talked about the pos
sibility of strengthening the pact.
