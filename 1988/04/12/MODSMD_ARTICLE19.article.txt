# Israel deports 8 Palestinians from territories
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — The Israeli government
deported eight Palestinians from the occu
pied territories yesterday and served a
dozen more with expulsion orders as it
continued a series of reprisals following
the controversial killing of a Jewish teen
ager last week in a West Bank Arab village.
A West Bank Jewish settlement leader
branded the government response as "too
little, too late" after 15-year-old Tirza Porat
died and 15 companions, most of them
teen-agers, were injured in a violent clash
at the village of Beita. Two Palestinians
were shot to death and two others were
wounded in the incident, in circumstances
that army investigators say are still not
completely clear.
Other critics charged that the expulsions
were ur\justified and were evidence that
the authorities either could not or would
not stand up to right-wing militants in the
settlement movement.
"If you look at what has been going on,"
a Western diplomat said, "you see that
proportionality and accountability are no
longer operative terms."
In Washington, the United States said
that it "strongly opposed" the deportations,
calling them "counterproductive" and say
ing that the measure would only "further
inflame passions."

The deportations were carried out as two
more Palestinians were shot to death by
army gunfire in the West Bank village of
Kafr Rai, northeast of Tulkarm. The deaths
brought to at least 137 the unofficial toll
of Arab dead in more than four months
of unrest in the territories. In addition to
Porat, one other Israeli, a soldier, has been
killed.
Six of those served with expulsion orders
yesterday were from Beita. The army said
that they were among those "who took an
active part in the attack" on the Jewish
teen-agers and two armed guards hiking
with them.
The eight who were deported were trans
ferred by army helicopter to the edge of
Israel's self-proclaimed "security zone" in
southern Lebanon. They had been in cus
tody since at least December and had pre
viously either exhausted or rejected their
limited rights of appeal.
All eight, the army said, were "leading
activists in terror organizations involved
in incitement and subversive activities....
Most of them have served long jail sen
tences in the past for terrorist activity and
incitement."
