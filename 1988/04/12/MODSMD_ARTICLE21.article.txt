## We recommend... 
### 
The Daily's endorsements are
based on reviews of each organi
zation's current and proposed
budget, as well as interviews with
group representatives. Only organ
izations that interviewed with The
Daily are listed below.
Axe Committee
$30,989 YES
The Stanford Axe Committee has
been essential to the growth of school
spirit. The committee has rekindled
the Bonfire tradition and done an ex
cellent job with the Big Game rally.
Without the committee, Big Game fes
tivities and support for Stanford ath
letics would suffer.
The Band
$35,272 YES
The Band has shown a new maturity
this year, dramatically improving re
lations with the Athletic Department
while retaining its unique personality.
The Band added a treasurer this year
and improved management of its
funds. This Stanford institution
deserves student support.
Black Student Union
$24,419 YES
The BSU is a diverse organization
that presents a wide variety of events
that are attended and enjoyed by the
entire community. The BSU is also
highly organized politically and capa
ble of mobilizing students for change,
as evidenced by its integral role in the
recent passage of the Cultures, Ideas
and Values proposal.
The Chaparral
$9,873 YES
The Chaparral humor magazine is
a campus institution of 88 years. It
provides a valuable opportunity for
students to gain experience in the writ
ing and production of a specialized
publication. The only significant in
crease in this year's fee request over
that of last year is in the area of
printing costs, which have soared for
all publications this year.
ChIPS
$14,955 YES
Chicanos in Public Service has
tutored children from East Palo Alto
on a one-to-one basis for 15 years. It
is the only group that brings the
children to campus and sponsors a
quarterly field trip for the children.
Concert Network
$33,333 NO
The Concert Network has never
worked and it never will. It cannot
achieve its goal of bringing big-name
rock bands to campus because Bay
Area promoter Bill Graham has cor
nered the area market and will not
allow it. The network also has
budgeted absurdly high salary in
creases. The network should be
dropped and a new organization
formed to focus on the successful jazz
concerts the network has implement
ed.
Course Guide
$17,988 YES
A computerized course guide has
proven to be a good idea. The guide
is readily accessible through Folio, and
even without much publicity this year
it has been- accessed over 2,000 times.
Having a course guide on-line means
students can read about classes that
fall into any category, such as number
of units or time offered.
GSA
$16,586 YES
The Graduate Student Association
provides the valuable service of bring
ing graduate students in various de
partments together. It is the only
broad-based graduate organization at
a university where graduate students
have few opportunities to interact.
KZSU
$76,592 YES
KZSU, the campus radio station, is
an important educational tool for stu
dents interested in the radio industry.
It provides excellent coverage of

campus political, community and
sporting events, and is in the process
of expanding its news department.
Legal Counseling
$67,531 YES
ASSU Legal Counseling provides ne
cessary advice for both graduates and
undergraduates on subjects including
landlord/tenant problems, traffic and
criminal violations and contracts. In
addition, this year it has begun
notarizing documents at no charge.
PAT
$24,267 NO
Public Access Television would
make very expensive, high-quality
video equipment available to students,
allowing them to produce their own
films. The cost of implementation will
transcend any benefits it brings. PAT's
sensitive equipment will not last long
under the liberal check-out guidelines
PAT's director has proposed. Do we
really need more toys to play with?
Release magazine
$11,880 YES
Release puts out one of the most
innovative and exciting magazines on
campus. The magazine is losing
money, which is not unusual for a
start-up. If it doesn't get its fee re
quest, it might not survive. Let's help
Release out. Its staff has shown its
commitment to producing a quality
product.
SIG
$25,727 YES
Stanford in Government is a very
well-run group that has established a
tremendous reputation through its
hard work and dedication to the stu
dent body. Each year it offers students
access to a number of job opportunities
in the political arena. In addition, SIG
brings to campus a number of
politicians for debates, conferences and
talks.
Speakers Bureau
$81,027 YES
Although the Speakers Bureau has
been accused recently of poor manage
ment and has done an inadequate job
with publicity, it has a track record
of providing students with interesting
and entertaining speakers.
The Stanford Daily
$46,533 NEUTRAL
The Daily believes it is inappropriate
to endorse its own fee request.
STOP
$32,596 YES
Safe Transportation Project pro
vides rides home for students who are
too drunk to drive — a much-needed
service. Staffed completely by volun
teers, STOP will use the majority of
its fee to buy a van, which will be
owned by the ASSU and available to
other student groups. STOP deserves
its fee request; it's cost-effective, and
more importantly, it saves lives.
SURE
$48,785 NO
Although the concept of an escort
service is a necessary contribution to
the safety of the Stanford community,
we believe that its directors are asking
for too much money — especially the
$6,000 increase in salaries. SURE
should return to a voluntary service
and use the money to increase its
reliability through a greater number
and better maintenance of golf carts.
We encourage those who truly believe
in SURE's philosophical unity to re
organize the escort service to be cost
effective.
Tuesday Films
$19,867 YES
At four cents per film per student,
Tuesday Films is a very efficient and
cost-effective organization that pro
vides a year-long program of interest
ing and educational films. Tuesday
Films successfully took the initiative
to provide the Stanford community
with an alternative to Rambo. That
alone merits our support.
