## Israel's acts justified 
### 
AS THE PLETHORA of stories that
has filled the media in the last
several months bears witness, it is
commonplace and perhaps even chic to
join in the voices denouncing the violence
in the West Bank and equating Israel
with South Africa.
Even the pages of The Daily show how
readily Israel's critics — often members
of America's affluent left grown impos
sibly spoiled and impatient from years
of living in America, where in the absence
of an enemy bent on our country's
destruction living on our borders, democ
racy is easily sustained — revel in
exposing the "underlying racism" in the
Jewish State's policy.
The policies of beatings that Israel has
instituted in the occupied territories vi
olate our standards of human rights. But
these policies of institutionalized violence
and hostility are also anathema to most
Israelis; after all, their state was founded
on the very principles of economic and
social equality and justice.
To understand then why the violence
continues, it is necessary to know the
historical context of the occupation.
For 40 years Israel, despite its eager
ness to cooperate with its neighbors, has
been the subject of the intense fury and
hatred of the surrounding Arab states.
These states pledge openly to destroy the
Jewish State by "driving the Jews into
the sea," and have tried in five separate
wars to do just that.
If the Arab countries had simply ac
cepted Israel's right to exist 20 years
ago, there would not have been a 1967
war, and the occupied territories might
today be part, of a Palestinian state.
Unfortunately, the Arabs persisted in

their inflexible stand, and after suddenly
winning in 1967, Israel found itself oc
cupying the territories. Israel could give
the land to the Palestinians, and I think
it would if the Palestinians would ac
knowledge the right of Israel to exist and
take steps to show they would make a
committed effort toward sustaining
peace, hardly unreasonable demands.
However, the Palestinians have been
unable to come up with the organization
or the leadership to make this a viable
possibility. Negotiations with Yassir
Arafat, whom Israel's critics so fondly
embrace as a leader of the Palestinian
people, are not a realistic option.
Arafat may fit nicely into the Palo
Altan romantic vision of a Palestinian
savior, but this butcher and the organi
zation he heads, in order to consolidate
their own position and quiet Arab dis
senters, murdered more Palestinians and
other Arabs than all those that died in
the five wars. This doesn't even include
all the Israeli lives claimed by his terrorist
activities.
Further, the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization remains committed by charter
and by the general consensus of its mem
bership to the destruction of the Jewish
State. Israel has no reason to trust that
a Palestinian state on its border would
be anything but a great liability; greater,
perhaps, than indefinitely occupying the
territories.
Israel, unwilling to turn the West Bank
and Gaza over to militant opponents,
tried the next best thing, to administer
the territories fairly and wisely. By most
standards, Israel has been very successful
at this.

It is arguable that the Palestinians in
the West Bank enjoy the highest standard
of living in the Arab world. Statisics in
dicating the general health of the popu
lation imply that medical care in the
territories is excellent. Since the Israeli
occupation, Palestinian infant mortality
has declined 60 percent and life expec
tancy for adults has increased by 30 per
cent.
Moreover, education in the occupied
lands has increased and improved in
quality unprecedented in their history;
the number of scholastic institutions has
literally doubled. Critics may complain
that Palestinian college graduates can't
get employment to match their abilities,
but they fail to mention who built the
universities where the Arabs are being
educated. Before 1967 there were no uni
versities for the occupied lands; now
there are six.
History shows that if there is a group
committed to racist policies, it has been
the Arabs. By choosing only the most
extreme military rejectionist position and
by refusing to cooperate and build trust,
they have pushed Israel to the edge. They
coined the policies of intractability and
inflexibilty. Now they are living with the
consequences.

ago, there would not have been a 1967
war, and the occupied territories might
today be part, of a Palestinian state.
Unfortunately, the Arabs persisted in

their inflexible stand, and after suddenly
winning in 1967, Israel found itself oc
cupying the territories. Israel could give
the land to the Palestinians, and I think
it would if the Palestinians would ac
knowledge the right of Israel to exist and
take steps to show they would make a
committed effort toward sustaining
peace, hardly unreasonable demands.
However, the Palestinians have been
unable to come up with the organization
or the leadership to make this a viable
possibility. Negotiations with Yassir
Arafat, whom Israel's critics so fondly
embrace as a leader of the Palestinian
people, are not a realistic option.
Arafat may fit nicely into the Palo
Altan romantic vision of a Palestinian
savior, but this butcher and the organi
zation he heads, in order to consolidate
their own position and quiet Arab dis
senters, murdered more Palestinians and
other Arabs than all those that died in
the five wars. This doesn't even include
all the Israeli lives claimed by his terrorist
activities.
Further, the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization remains committed by charter
and by the general consensus of its mem
bership to the destruction of the Jewish
State. Israel has no reason to trust that
a Palestinian state on its border would
be anything but a great liability; greater,
perhaps, than indefinitely occupying the
territories.
Israel, unwilling to turn the West Bank
and Gaza over to militant opponents,
tried the next best thing, to administer
the territories fairly and wisely. By most
standards, Israel has been very successful
at this.

It is arguable that the Palestinians in
the West Bank enjoy the highest standard
of living in the Arab world. Statisics in
dicating the general health of the popu
lation imply that medical care in the
territories is excellent. Since the Israeli
occupation, Palestinian infant mortality
has declined 60 percent and life expec
tancy for adults has increased by 30 per
cent.
Moreover, education in the occupied
lands has increased and improved in
quality unprecedented in their history;
the number of scholastic institutions has
literally doubled. Critics may complain
that Palestinian college graduates can't
get employment to match their abilities,
but they fail to mention who built the
universities where the Arabs are being
educated. Before 1967 there were no uni
versities for the occupied lands; now
there are six.
History shows that if there is a group
committed to racist policies, it has been
the Arabs. By choosing only the most
extreme military rejectionist position and
by refusing to cooperate and build trust,
they have pushed Israel to the edge. They
coined the policies of intractability and
inflexibilty. Now they are living with the
consequences.
