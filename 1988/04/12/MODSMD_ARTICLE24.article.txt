## Don't moralize on AIDS 
### 
KAY DEVGAN'S April 7 column
"Safe sex isn't a game" presents
two common critiques of the
Stanford AIDS Education Project's
approach and philosophy that I would
like to address.
The first is her claim that "... It is
important for organizations to get their
educational messages across to the
student body in a manner that does
not promote or unconsciously advocate
casual sex."
Here, she shows a common misun
derstanding of our educational ap
proach. She tries to focus attention on
the casual/serious sex dichotomy that
does nothing more than inject morality
into the discussion.
The real problem is not "casual" sex
(whatever this means) but unsafe sex.
The real solution is not "serious" sex
but abstinence or safer sex.
Our job is not to moralize but to
inform. We believe that people should
be informed about the risks of particu
lar actions. With this information, it is
then up to the individual to decide
what she or he will do. So far,
moralistic discussion has only served to
hamper efforts to educate and led to
needless deaths.
In order to educate and acquaint

people with safer sex, condoms and
other safer sex supplies, we reach out
to dorms and classes, host "Rubber
wear" parties, run the Safer Sex
Shoppe and present the Great Condom
Rating Contest.
As to the AEP's philosophical ap
proach to sex, we do view sex as a
natural bodily function. Yet, there can
be serious repercussions to sex, from
pregnancy to STDs to AIDS.
Many people in long-term
monogamous relationships don't need
to respond directly to these conse
quences. Most others, however, do
need to consider practicing abstinence,
safer sex or contraceptive sex. This
choice should be educated and it
should be yours, not anybody else's.
But the important point is that
people don't have to agree with our
philosophy to become educated about
AIDS and other STDs. There are a
variety of resources and approaches
available for AIDS and STD education
both on campus and off.
So educate yourself, your family and
your friends to help them make in
formed and responsible decisions.
