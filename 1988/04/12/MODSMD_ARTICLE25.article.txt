# Miniskirt article sexist
## 
### 
I have a lot of questions as to what
the intentions were of the March 9
article, "Miniskirts dominate spring
party wear."
The article's blatantly sexist com
ments about the so-called intentions of
"a woman who wears a high-cut
leather miniskirt" and its forecast for
"a good chance of widespread mini
skirts" were offensive and surprising.
The same Daily that touted the

March 2 "Take Back the Night" march
and that made date rape a major topic
of discussion on campus made itself a
forum for the kind of attitude that
propagates violence against women.
Second-guessing a woman's inten
tions because of how she looks or what
she wears is not only sexist, but is
exactly what makes rape a problem in
this society.
