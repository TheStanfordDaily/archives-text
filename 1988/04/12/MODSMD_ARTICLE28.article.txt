Dear Bug,
Many pizzas ago, I began to
suspect that anchovies are not
animal matter. I recently heard
something which seemingly con
firms this theory. I am told that
one may purchase a vegetarian
dish at Tresidder which is called
"Monterey Bake." One ingredient
in Monterey Bake is Worcester
shire sauce, and we all know that
Worcestershire sauce contains
anchovies. Thus, anchovies must
not be animal matter. My question
is this: Since anchovies aren't
animal matter, where do they
come from? Are they spon
taneously generated in Caesar
salads, or just what 1 ?
- J.B.
A brilliant piece of investigative
journalism, J.B, except you gloss
over one minor detail: Anchovies
are not a required element in Wor

cestershire sauce. One of the
Kitchen Head Honchos at Tres
idder read to me over the phone
the ingredients in their Worces
tershire sauce, none of which was
anchovies.
Before he checked the bottle,
however, the guy did not seem
overly concerned with whether
the Monterey Bake contained
minute amounts of anchovy or
not, expressing the opinion that
there was a great deal of debate
among the vegetarian community
as to the admisibility of fish in
one's diet, particularly small,
smelly, hairy fish.
Rest assured, however, that
anchovies are indeed animal mat
ter. Most of them come from the
Mediterranean which, coinciden
tally, is where most wild pep
peronis are hunted.
Dear Bug-Me,
My friend and I live in Sterling
Quad. Sometimes when returning
to the dorm at night we pass by
the greenhouses on Campus
Drive. Usually they are lit up in
bright colors — orange, blue —
sometimes they are dark. I'm sure
the University is not involved in
growing illicit plants or even cul
tivating pods from outer space,
but what exactly does go on in
those greenhouses ?

Question:
What the heck is going on in
those greenhouses over near Ster
ling Quad? It would seem to me
that since the UV lights are on
at strange hours, maybe they are
growing pot or some other kind
of wacko plant. Inquiring minds
want to know: Does Don Kennedy
go for serious harvesting or what

Well, bud (pun gloriously in
tended), Don couldn't be reached
for comment on this one, but I
can tell you for a fact that the
most exciting plant growing in
those greenhouses is corn.
There's also rice, alfalfa, wild

radishes and snapdragons, but
that's about as exotic as it gets.
The greenhouses, paid for by a
grant from the National Science
Foundation and by Stanford, are
used for plant growth research by
the Biological Sciences depart
ment. Because many of the plants
within the greenhouses need 12
to 14 hours of sunlight per day,
the ultraviolet lights are there
glowing at weird hours to supple
ment the natural light. By mid
summer there will be substantial
daylight to eliminate the need to
use the greenhouse lights.
Admittedly the place looks cool
at night. "(The green house) looks
like E.T," Biology Prof. Virginia
Walbot reported. But in the
daytime, up close, it looks like a
bunch of plastic and sprouts.
Outside the greenhouses is a
bunch of land where experimental
stuff is grown — most notably
poison ivy. Of course, if the poison
ivy doesn't bother you, there's al
ways the matter of that skunk
that had the nerve to get itself
hit by a car on Campus Drive last
week and promptly released a 20-
megaton stench into the air. That
smell, if it were to fall into the
hands of the wrong people, could
conceivably tip the balance of
power in favor of the enemy.

Bug Me appears every Tuesday,
ready to answer mind-boggling
questions.
