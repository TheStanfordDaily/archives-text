## Card rests from grueling Six-Pac 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
It's just past mid
season in the
Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Di
vision, and time
for a brief look at
the conference

race.
After six series weekends, Cal
ifornia and streaking Arizona
State are tied for first with 11-7
conference records. Stanford,
which plays USF at 2:30 p.m.
today at Benedetti Diamond in
San Francisco, is a half-game back
in third at 10-7, with USC in
fourth at 9-8.
The conference is more
bunched than ever, and as always,
no team can be taken for granted:
Last weekend, fifth-place UCLA
took two of three from Cal and
cellar-dwelling Arizona beat the
Cardinal twice.
Last year, the top four teams
from the Six-Pac were invited to
NCAA regional play. The top two
teams (Stanford and ASU) were
selected to host regionals.
As it enters the conference
home stretch, the Cardinal, as the
saying goes, has its destiny in its
own hands.
Stanford travels to UCLA for a
three-game series this weekend,
then goes to USC on Monday to
make up a game that was canceled
because of rain earlier this year.
After that, the Cardinal plays all
three of the other current con
tenders, with home stands against
USC and ASU and a home-and

road series with Cal.
This weekend will be particu
larly important, as the Cardinal
seeks to keep itself in contention
and build some momentum going
into the home series.
"We have a very crucial week
end coming up with four confer
ence games on the road," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "We
haven't been playing well on the
road lately and if we're going to
contend for the conference title
we're going to have to play better
on the road."
The Cardinal is 7-10 on the road
this year and 1-6 in its last seven
Six-Pac road games.
If it is going to contend for the
league title the Cardinal must also
beat Arizona State, which would
be more than anybody else has
done in the last several weeks.
The red-hot Sun Devils, ranked
third nationally in both polls,
have won 18 games in a row, in
cluding series sweeps of Six-Pac
opponents Stanford, Arizona and
use.
ASU's last loss came on March
6, but the Sun Devils haven't
played a game outside the friendly
confines of Packard Stadium in
Tempe, Ariz., since March 13,
nearly a month ago. This weekend
they travel to Berkeley for a three
game series with co-league-leader
Cal.
Card notes
USF is 12-22 on the season and
2-10 in West Coast Athletic Confer
ence play going into today's game.
The Dons are an all-hit, no-pitch
team: They lost four out of five games

last week despite hitting .370 as a
team during the week. They are led
by senior designated hitter Ron Her
bert, batting .411, and senior out
fielder Dean Jeffries, batting .354.
Jeffries, a native of Millbrae, is the
older brother of New York Mets farm
phenom Greg Jeffries. In the two
teams' only other meeting this season,
on Feb. 17, the Cardinal beat the
Dons 5-3.
Stanford sophomore rightfielder
Paul Carey was named the Player of
the Week in college baseball last week

by ESPN/Collegiate Baseball. Carey
was 6-for-ll in Stanford's four games
last week, collecting seven RBI and
his first home run of the year — a
solo shot against Santa Clara last
Tuesday. In the Cardinal's three
games against Arizona over the week
end, he was 5-for-9 with six RBI. On
Saturday he recorded his first four-
RBI game since the Cardinal's College
World Series game against LSU last
June 5. Carey hit a game-winning
grand slam in the bottom of the 10th
inning in that game and went on to

be named the Most Outstanding
Player of the CWS.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen
extended his team-high hitting streak
to 17 games with hits in each of the
Cardinal's games against Arizona.
Paulsen was 3-for-5 with a double on
Friday, l-for-4 on Saturday and 2-for
-5 with a triple on Sunday. Paulsen
has hit in 25 of Stanford's last 26
games; he is hitting .375 (45-for-120)
with 28 runs and 21 RBI in those 26
games. Stanford doesn't keep records
for hitting streaks, but the longest

streak by a Cardinal last year was Ed
Sprague's 15-game skein.
Speaking of Sprague — the junior
third baseman is on a six-game hitting
streak, and is 11-for-23 (.478) with
four home runs and 14 RBI during
that streak. In his last 10 games,
Sprague is batting .421 with six
homers and 17 RBI. In less than three
seasons at Stanford, he ranks fifth
all-time with 32 home runs, seventh
in doubles with 35, eighth in RBI
with 139 and 10th in career batting
average at .326.



Sophomore rightfielder Paul Carey, shown here sliding safely into
home past UCLA catcher Paul Ellis, garnered national honors by

James Rucker — Daily file
being named ESPN/Collegiate Baseball Player of the Week. Carey
batted .545 last week with a home run and seven RBI.
