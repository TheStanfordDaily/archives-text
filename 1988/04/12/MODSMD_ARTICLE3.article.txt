# Davies challenges tenure policy
## Tenured faculty enjoy greater freedoms than visiting profs. 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
The question of whether visiting pro
fessors should have the same academic
freedom as tenured professors has
emerged as the focus of the revived
debate between the University and
former Visiting Prof. Norman Davies.
Davies last month lost his $9 million
lawsuit against Stanford, in which he
argued that in 1986 the University dis
criminated against him for his political
views when he was denied History De
partment tenure.
Although the University prevailed in
the suit, Stanford formally withdrew
part of its written argument less than
three weeks later — which could prompt
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge James Stewart to reopen the case.
University attorney Iris Brest, who is
handling the case, said the University
made the move because she said por
tions of Stanford's argument misled
Stewart.
According to Brest, Stewart under
stood Stanford's argument as being
that, as a visiting professor, Davies was
entitled to none of the protections out
lined in the University's Statement on
Academic Freedom.
But Brest said one of the protections
in the statement does apply to visiting
faculty: the guarantee that no profes
sor's personal views unrelated to aca

demic scholarship can be factored into
evaluaions of that work.
According to Brest, because the lan
guage in Stewart's decision reflected the
misunderstanding, the University sent
a letter the day following the ruling
that asks Stewart to change some wor
ding in his opinion.
In that March 3 letter, University
attorneys accepted blame for "blurring"
their argument.
According to Brest this modification
of the court's decision will not affect
the ruling.
However, Davies' attorney, former
Congressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
argued that once some rights are ex
tended to visiting professors, "It be
comes completely implausible to argue
that Davies is not also protected by the
procedures intended to preserve those
rights."
The statement guarantees that pro
fessors who feel they have been treated
unfairly in questions relating to em
ployment decisions are entitled to Uni
versity grievence hearings.
Stanford's initial request on March 3
that the court modify its decision was
denied by the court. Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge James Stewart
wrote in a March 9 letter that Stanford's
own briefs had contended that the en
tire Statement on Academic freedom
was inapplicable to Davies, not just spe
cific sections of the policy.

In the original brief, Stanford con
tended that "the Statement on Aca
demic Freedom does not apply to visit
ing professors" like Davies.
Furthermore, in a reply brief Stan
ford stated that Davies "can neither
rely on the Statement of Academic Free
dom to support his claim that Stanford
improperly considered his 'political
views' nor cite the remedies described
in the statement. . .
After receiving Stewart's reply to its
request, Stanford filed for a formal
withdrawal of these portions of its in
itial argument.
In response, McCloskey filed to have
the entire March 2 ruling thrown out,
arguing that the result of Stanford's
withdrawal had been to "change com
pletely the basis upon which this matter
originally was argued and upon which
the court originally ruled."
On March 30, the court denied this
motion by McClosky, but issued a for
mal order allowing him to determine
whether to appeal the case.
Stewart argued that McCloskey failed
to show that the University's decision
had changed completely because of the
University's clarification.
McCloskey said yesterday he hopes
the court will allow him to amend se
lected clauses of his argument, possibly
granting a new summary judgment and
reopening the case entirely.
