# Stanford football wakes up to find spring in its step
## 
### 
It used to be said that schools in the
South played two sports: football and
spring football. Things are not taken that
seriously on the Farm, but spring football
nonetheless remains an important testing
and teaching time for Stanford Coach
Jack El way and his staff.

Workouts begin today at 2:30 p.m. and
will continue every Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday, along with a series of
Saturday-morning scrimmages that will
culminate with the Cardinal/White Game
on May 12.
Spring ball gives the players an oppor
tunity to work out the kinks after a
winter spent in the weight room and will
also begin to give some indication of who
will step forward to replace a cadre of

graduating seniors. The coaches are ex
pecting to come out of the spring with
a working depth chart and are looking
for answers to the numerous questions
that arose last season when Stanford lost
its first four games (before winning five
of the last seven).
The question on everybody's mind is
who will be next year's quarterback.
Sophomore Brian Johnson is the incum
bent, but he will be pressed by former
starters Greg Ennis, a senior, Scott Stark,
a sophomore, and freshman Jason
Palumbis.
"We're going to really hone in on Brian
Johnson," Stanford Asst. Coach Dave
Baldwin said. "We're really excited about
his future here, but it's still an open
position."
The starting left fielder for the baseball
team and a modern-day Frank Merriwell,
Johnson will have a busy spring as he
juggles baseball and football, but he is
expected to make most if not all of the
football workouts.
The competition will be stiff. Ennis,
the veteran, has started some big games
for the Cardinal, including the 1987
Gator Bowl. Stark is perhaps the most
talented of all the quarterback candi

dates, and the coaches are very high on
the young Palumbis.
All the quarterbacks should get a lot
of work this spring as back problems
have left the status of the Cardinal's top
running backs, sophomores Charlie
Young and Jon Volpe, day-to-day. This
will force the coaches to concentrate on
the passing game. Elway is also said to
be toying with the idea of instituting a
four-receiver offense.
The receiving positions are among the
team *8 deepest. Sophomore Ed McCaffrey
is expected to replace the graduating Jeff
James as the Cardinal's top threat. The
lanky McCaffrey is coming off a 30-catch
season.
"I'm personally excited about Ed
McCaffrey," Baldwin said. "I thought he
was at the end of the season as consistent
as any receiver in the conference. He's
got the capabilities to do it all."
A bevy of receivers led by electrifying
freshman Walter Batson will be compet
ing for the spot opposite McCaffrey.
Fifth-year seniors Spencer Cotten and
Henry Green as well as freshmen Jon
Pinckney and Cory Booker will all vie
for time. Junior Jim Price has dropped
baseball in order to concentrate on foot

ball and has been penciled in at tight end.
Offensive line is the Cardinal's
strongest position and is anchored by
All-America candidate Andy Sinclair at
center. Probably the best college center
in the country, the senior Sinclair leads
a crew that is big, strong, deep and ex
perienced.
All five starters return as well as the
top reserves. Senior John Zentner should
push for All-Pacific 10 Conference
honors, and former tight end John
Carpenter, a freshman, has bulked up
and will add further depth at tackle.
The only offensive line negative is that
the unit won't be at full strength for
spring drills. Several linemen are fighting
nagging injuries, and starter Andy Papat
hanassiou, a junior, is concentrating on
track this spring as he prepares for a bid
to make the Greek Olympic team in the
shot put.
On the whole, the offense is solid.
Though probable high NFL draft picks
Brad Muster and James will leave gaps
at the skill positions, the offensive line
should be one of the best in the confer
ence. A return to health for Volpe and
Young remains critical because Stanford
is dangerously thin at running back, but

otherwise there are no weaknesses.
The defense will also be looking to
replace key performers, including four
starters and All-Pac-10 safety Brad
Humphreys.
"We're going to mirror the offense in
some respects in that we'll be a young
football team but an experienced team,"
Stanford Defensive Coordinator Dick
Mannini said. "We've got to be more
aggressive. We can't be as soft as last
year. The one question mark we've got
is the two safety positions."
While the cornerback spots look solid
with starters Alan Grant, a junior, and
freshman Kevin Scott returning, Mannini
will be holding a cattle call for safeties.
Junior Rob Englehardt played nickel
back for the Cardinal last year and leads
a group that also includes senior letter
men Rick Theder, Mike Newton and Pat
Kelly as well as junior Lance Johnson.
None of the safeties are particularly ex
perienced, and the defense's fate will rest
to a large extent on how quickly the
safeties develop.
The line looks solid with junior All-
America candidate Lester Archambeau at


BRENDAN HEALEY
tackle and junior returning
starter Ray Huckestein at nose
guard.
Three regulars return at line
backer, and former starter Barry
McKeever continues his recovery
from a serious knee injury suf
fered a year ago. Again, experi
enced depth remains a problem.
One new look that may be ex
perimented with this spring is a
four-man front. Stanford has
traditionally gone with a three
man line but might try to imple
ment an even front.
The kicking game should be
well taken care of by freshman
John Hopkins. Hopkins had
beaten out David Sweeney at place
kicker before getting iryured last
year. He has recently been doing
some high jumping for the track
team and appears be recovered.
Hopkins will also battle junior
Jeff Blaisdell for the right to
replace superstar punter Doug
Robison, and Grant should be one
of the most exciting kick
returners in the country.
But this is all far into the fu
ture. For now, while other Stan
ford students lay out this spring,
the members of the football team
will be laying each other out.
