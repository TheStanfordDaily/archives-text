# Cornelius fires 68, leads at Sun Devil
## Card tied for seventh after 18 holes 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
Tim Baldwin,
the Stanford
women's golf
coach, has both
experience and
youthful talent
on this year's

team. In the first round of the
Lady Sun Devil Tournament
at the Anasazi Golf Course in
Phoenix, Ariz., the experience
came through in grand fashion.
Senior star Kay Cornelius
shot a blistering four-under
par 68 to lead all competitors
in the tournament. Her closest
rival, Arizona State's Missy
Farr, is two strokes back with
an opening round of 70.
Cornelius' mastery of the ex
tremely long (6,400 yards)
course is merely a continuation
of her fine performance at the
Rainbow Intercollegiate in
Hawaii last month, where she
won her first collegiate tour
nament ever, beating out team
mate Jodi Figley on the first
playoff hole of the 54-hole tour
ney.
After the first round, Stan
ford is tied for seventh place
with San Diego State with a
total of 306 strokes. Tulsa
stands in first place with a
team score of 298, and USIU
is one shot back with 299.

With seven of the nation's
top-10 teams competing at the
Lady Sun Devil, the women are
facing some stiff competition.
Led by Cornelius, the team al
ready stands ahead of nation
ally ranked New Mexico and
New Mexico State.
Unfortunately, the rest of
the Cardinal golfers did not
quite match their leader's per
formance. Figley continues to
perform well, carding a respect
able 75. Her freshman team
mate Kristin Ryan, who has
shown great improvement over
the past month, also stayed in
contention with 78. But fellow
freshman Michele Lyford and
sophomore Stephanie Parel
still have a lot of work left to
do. They both shot opening
round 85s.
This week's tournament is a
crucial one for the women gol
fers. The whole team needs to
perform well at Anasazi to
lower the team's differential, a
measure the NCAA uses to de
termine who qualifies for the
championship tournament. If
Cornelius continues to master
the course the way she did
Monday, she could have her
second tournament win in a
row after a four-year dry spell.
If her young teammates can
back her up with good scores,
the golfers could be on their
way to the NCAAs.
