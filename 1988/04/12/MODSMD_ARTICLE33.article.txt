# Sailors lead comfortably
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
The wind was from the east,
the temperature was in the
80s, and the Cardinal
cruised to an easy overall
victory — it was hard for
the Stanford sailing team to
believe they were sailing in

Berkeley.
The occasion was the seventh regatta of
the Northern series, which the Cardinal
now leads by a comfortable margin after
rival Cal finished a disappointing eighth.
Stanford followed its victory with an
other impressive performance at the open
team racing regatta that Cal hosted on
Sunday. Losing narrowly to UC-Irvine in
one of the day's last races cost the Cardinal
an overall win, leaving them in second
place at the end of the second regatta,
which did not count toward the overall
Northern series totals.
For the regatta that did count, Stanford
fielded a strong team of seven boats, all
of which showed moments of brilliance as
they battled a fleet of 30 boats representing
10 schools from throughout the Pacific
region.
By day's end, Stanford seniors Dan Buck
staff and Kathleen Mallery had sailed to
a close second in the A Division behind
Irvine, while senior Tom Kuhnle and junior
Rita Snape fought their way to second in
B-Division.
Without winning either division, the Car

dinal still managed to leave with the first
place points because of their consistency.
Irvine took the second and third spots,
while USC finished fourth.
Other boats from Stanford claimed sixth,
ninth, 10th, 13th, 16th and 20th.
In Sunday's racing, three teams of three
boats competed for the Cardinal in an event
that pitted schools against each other in
a one-on-one format. Buckstaff, Mallery,
Kuhnle and Snape were joined by senior
Drew Gashler and freshman Kevin Hagan
as they sailed to a second-place tie with Cal.
For Gashler, Sunday couldn't match Sat
urday night, when the Stanford senior and
his coach, Blake Middleton, were honored
at a special ceremony for their contribution
to college sailing.
Understandably, the team left Berkeley
content.
"It was a very enjoyable regatta," Mid
dleton said. "The Cal team did a great job
of running both events, and we couldn't
have asked for a better weekend."
After a weekend away from the
racecourse, Stanford will return to compe
tition in two weeks when San Francisco
State hosts the final regattas of the North
ern Series. Even though they are now
ahead, Stanford's sailors know they will
have to keep up their guard.
"We are getting better and better, but
so are a lot of the other top teams," junior
Ev Rend said. "To get to the nationals,
and do well there, the whole team has to
hang together and not let anything break
our momentum."
