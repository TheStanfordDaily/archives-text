# ASSU to alter hiring policy
## 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate yesterday
took a mtyor step toward ending
a week-long dispute over charges
that its committees were racially
biased in appointing ASSU man
agers.
In a meeting called specifically
to deal with Black Student Union
charges made last week that two
white students were favored in
the appointments process over
two black students, the senate
created a special task force to
review ASSU hiring procedures.
The task force, which appeared
to placate temporarily all con
cerned parties, is charged with:
• Resolving the present disputes;
and

• Making recommendations for
long-term solutions to ensure that
racial bias is not an issue in ap
pointments.
The senate yesterday confirmed
the controversial appointment of
Andrew Berke, a white sopho

Speakers Bureau. Berke was re
appointed to the position yester
day after applicants were
reviewed again in response to the
BSU charges.
The task force will determine
the outcome of the second con
tested position, director of public
affairs. Deanna Terzian, a white
sophomore, was appointed to the
post last week but did not gain
senate confirmation after the
BSU charges.
Yesterday a special committee

— set up by the senate to repeat
the selection process — appointed
Rachel Wiesen, A black junior, to
the post.
The Task Force on ASSU Staff
Hiring will also conduct a thor
ough review of the selection proc
ess used in determining appoint
ments. In his proposal for the task
force, Senate Chair Dave Smolen
said the existing system is "over
taxed and unable to properly serve
its purpose" because of a tremen
dous growth in the ASSU bureau
cracy.
Smolen said possible long-term
changes in the selection process
include:
• a reduction in the number of
appointed positions;
