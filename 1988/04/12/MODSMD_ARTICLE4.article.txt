# ASSU to alter hiring policy
## 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate yesterday
took a mtyor step toward ending
a week-long dispute over charges
that its committees were racially
biased in appointing ASSU man
agers.
In a meeting called specifically
to deal with Black Student Union
charges made last week that two
white students were favored in
the appointments process over
two black students, the senate
created a special task force to
review ASSU hiring procedures.
The task force, which appeared
to placate temporarily all con
cerned parties, is charged with:
• Resolving the present disputes;
and

• Making recommendations for
long-term solutions to ensure that
racial bias is not an issue in ap
pointments.
The senate yesterday confirmed
the controversial appointment of
Andrew Berke, a white sopho
more, as director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. Berke was re
appointed to the position yester
day after applicants were
reviewed again in response to the
BSU charges.
The task force will determine
the outcome of the second con
tested position, director of public
affairs. Deanna Terzian, a white
sophomore, was appointed to the
post last week but did not gain
senate confirmation after the
BSU charges.
Yesterday a special committee

— set up by the senate to repeat
the selection process — appointed
Rachel Wiesen, A black junior, to
the post.
The Task Force on ASSU Staff
Hiring will also conduct a thor
ough review of the selection proc
ess used in determining appoint
ments. In his proposal for the task
force, Senate Chair Dave Smolen
said the existing system is "over
taxed and unable to properly serve
its purpose" because of a tremen
dous growth in the ASSU bureau
cracy.
Smolen said possible long-term
changes in the selection process
include:
• a reduction in the number of
appointed positions;
• an extension of the interviewing
period to decrease the pressure to
finish interviews quickly; and
• making the senate chair respon
sible for organizing selection com
mittees, instead of allowing arbi
trary committees to form.
The appointment dispute first
erupted last Tuesday, when Ter
zian and Berke, both white, were
recommended over Wiesen and
Terri James, who are both black.
The BSU contends that biased in
terview questions were asked of
the black candidates.
Neither recommendation was
approved, and each was returned
to a new committee for re
interviewing and re-selection.
After the second selection process,
Wiesen was recommended for di
rector of public affairs, reversing
the original endorsement for Ter
zian.
The Speakers Bureau contro
versy was resolved when James
chose not to re-interview and

Berke was again recommended for
the appointment.
In a surprise development, the
new committee recommended a
different person for assistant di
rector. Freshman Michael Canul
was endorsed over freshman Lara
Rosenthal, who was originally rec
ommended at last week's senate
meeting.
The appointment was not ques
tioned at last week's meeting.
Rosenthal appealed to the sen
ate yesterday, claiming she had
been victimized "by convoluted
politics." She added that she did
not find out that Canul was en
dorsed in her place until 15
minutes before yesterday's senate
meeting.
The senate, reversing itself
again, agreed with Rosenthal and
appointed her.
Explaining her dismay with the
selection process, Terzian ap
pealed to the senate yesterday to
re-examine the system before it
approved the Public Affairs posi
tions. She claimed the second
committee's decision was skewed
by previous biases and rushed in
terviews.

Terzian argued that a senate
oversight allowed sophomore
Sheilon King, who served on the
original committee that rejected
her, to serve on the second com
mittee also.
Since King had been "adamant"
in support of Wiesen afler the
first set of interviews, Terzian
said "her perspective was one
sided" and tilted the second com
mittee to vote 3-2 in favor of
Wiesen.
Terzian said the committee
could not be expected to have a
"clear, fair evaluation" of appli
cants.
For the Public Affairs position,
the task force will either appoint
someone, establish the selection
process, or eliminate the position
altogether. The last is possible be
cause the position was newly
created for next year.
Smolen explained that Public
Affairs appointments are not ur
gent, since the positions are not
yet part of the ASSU bylaws.
Smolen said the division in the
senate over the Public Affairs po
sitions would make it "difficult"
for any action to be taken.

"clear, fair evaluation" of appli
cants.
For the Public Affairs position,
the task force will either appoint
someone, establish the selection
process, or eliminate the position
altogether. The last is possible be
cause the position was newly
created for next year.
Smolen explained that Public
Affairs appointments are not ur
gent, since the positions are not
yet part of the ASSU bylaws.
Smolen said the division in the
senate over the Public Affairs po
sitions would make it "difficult"
for any action to be taken.
The ASSU Senate yesterday
took a mtyor step toward ending
a week-long dispute over charges
that its committees were racially
biased in appointing ASSU man
agers.
In a meeting called specifically
to deal with Black Student Union
charges made last week that two
white students were favored in
the appointments process over
two black students, the senate
created a special task force to
review ASSU hiring procedures.
The task force, which appeared
to placate temporarily all con
cerned parties, is charged with:
• Resolving the present disputes;
and

• Making recommendations for
long-term solutions to ensure that
racial bias is not an issue in ap
pointments.
The senate yesterday confirmed
the controversial appointment of
Andrew Berke, a white sopho
more, as director of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau. Berke was re
appointed to the position yester
day after applicants were
reviewed again in response to the
BSU charges.
The task force will determine
the outcome of the second con
tested position, director of public
affairs. Deanna Terzian, a white
sophomore, was appointed to the
post last week but did not gain
senate confirmation after the
BSU charges.
Yesterday a special committee

— set up by the senate to repeat
the selection process — appointed
Rachel Wiesen, A black junior, to
the post.
The Task Force on ASSU Staff
Hiring will also conduct a thor
ough review of the selection proc
ess used in determining appoint
ments. In his proposal for the task
force, Senate Chair Dave Smolen
said the existing system is "over
taxed and unable to properly serve
its purpose" because of a tremen
dous growth in the ASSU bureau
cracy.
Smolen said possible long-term
changes in the selection process
include:
• a reduction in the number of
appointed positions;
• an extension of the interviewing
period to decrease the pressure to
finish interviews quickly; and
• making the senate chair respon
sible for organizing selection com
mittees, instead of allowing arbi
trary committees to form.
The appointment dispute first
erupted last Tuesday, when Ter
zian and Berke, both white, were
recommended over Wiesen and
Terri James, who are both black.
The BSU contends that biased in
terview questions were asked of
the black candidates.
Neither recommendation was
approved, and each was returned
to a new committee for re
interviewing and re-selection.
After the second selection process,
Wiesen was recommended for di
rector of public affairs, reversing
the original endorsement for Ter
zian.
The Speakers Bureau contro
versy was resolved when James
chose not to re-interview and

Berke was again recommended for
the appointment.
In a surprise development, the
new committee recommended a
different person for assistant di
rector. Freshman Michael Canul
was endorsed over freshman Lara
Rosenthal, who was originally rec
ommended at last week's senate
meeting.
The appointment was not ques
tioned at last week's meeting.
Rosenthal appealed to the sen
ate yesterday, claiming she had
been victimized "by convoluted
politics." She added that she did
not find out that Canul was en
dorsed in her place until 15
minutes before yesterday's senate
meeting.
The senate, reversing itself
again, agreed with Rosenthal and
appointed her.
Explaining her dismay with the
selection process, Terzian ap
pealed to the senate yesterday to
re-examine the system before it
approved the Public Affairs posi
tions. She claimed the second
committee's decision was skewed
by previous biases and rushed in
terviews.

Terzian argued that a senate
oversight allowed sophomore
Sheilon King, who served on the
original committee that rejected
her, to serve on the second com
mittee also.
Since King had been "adamant"
in support of Wiesen afler the
first set of interviews, Terzian
said "her perspective was one
sided" and tilted the second com
mittee to vote 3-2 in favor of
Wiesen.
Terzian said the committee
could not be expected to have a
"clear, fair evaluation" of appli
cants.
For the Public Affairs position,
the task force will either appoint
someone, establish the selection
process, or eliminate the position
altogether. The last is possible be
cause the position was newly
