# News and Pubs faces cash crunch
## 
### Jeff Album Staff writer 
Money is a touchy subject, and
for the Stanford News and Pub
lications Service, what it touches
is a raw nerve.
For Bob Beyers, director of the
news agency, finance can even
touch off a tirade about Univer
sity politics, ungrateful
bureaucrats and what Beyers
called a "noble" but increasingly
difficult mission to publicize the
ideas and accomplishments of
Stanford faculty and students.
With 13 full-time staff and an
annual budget of $1.1 million,

Beyers is responsible for produc
ing the Campus Report that has
a weekly circulation of 16,000, the
Stanford Observer and hundreds
of press releases that significantly
impact the media's perception of
Stanford. But recent budget con
straints have made Beyer's iob
increasingly difficult — jeopardiz
ing the quality of news about
Stanford that reaches the nation.
Against the backdrop of scat
tered papers strewn across his
cluttered desk, Beyers spoke with
conviction of the budget con
straints his staff must work un
der.
"I am resentful that having

stayed deliberately small, we are
subject to the same budget pres
sures that other larger and less
productive (University) depart
ments must face," Beyers said.
Campus officials were not ready
to refute Beyer's claim. "Bob
Beyers is in a bftter position to
know (about insufficient funding)
than 1 am," said Vice Provost
Raymond Bacchetti, the Univer
sity's budget director.
"He is one of the masters at
stretching University dollars as
far as they will go. He is the
model."
According to Beyers, budget
pressures hit the news agency
hard last year after he volun
tarily gave away one of his staff
positions to the Public Affairs
Department, which was facing
a staff shortage at the time.
Although the news agency's
staff position has been restored
since then, the agency is still
only at the same level of staffing
it was at four years ago. Beyers
is currently requesting for a
staff increase to meet the de
mands facing the agency.
Larry Davidson, director for
the administration of public af
fairs, is evaluating Beyer's re
quest for a larger staff. David
son said his department is
working hard to "clear up what
the needs of the news service
are," but he has yet to make
any final decisions.
Beyers said the University
has placed new demands on the
news agency for greater cover
age of what he calls "ad
ministrivia" — printing offical
Stanford announcements and
advertising University job
openings.
"These annoucement func
tions do not go to the heart of
the University, yet they con
sume about 85 percent of our
time and resources," Beyers
said. "By any standards of com
parison, there is no organization
in the college news that is doing
as much with so few people."
The increased demands of
these daily chores jeopardize the
quality of news his agency can
produce, Beyers said, explaining
that "urgency takes precedence
over the important."
He claimed that staff
shortages prevented his agency
from doing in-depth coverage of
Stanford graduate Anthony
Kennedy's nomination to the
Supreme Court and from cover
ing an important conference of
Indian educators at Stanford.

"We just don't have the
bodies," he said.
While the budget needs of the
news service may be in dispute,
the quality of its product is not.
Over the 26 years that Beyers
has been the director, he has
created a news agency that is
nationally acclaimed as one of
the country's leading university
news services. Currents maga
zine, the San Jose Mercury
News and other major publica
tions have all praised the
agency.
But quality news service has
a cost, and Beyers' approach is
to hire well-paid professional
writers, trained as journalists,
who are capable of the quality
investigative reporting he de
mands.
What seems to distinguish the
Stanford news agency from its
counterparts is the agency's
willingness to report controver
sial news about Stanford as well
as the necessary "a d -
ministrivia."
For example, when the Uni
versity's investment policy on
firms active in South Africa was
challenged by students in 1985,
the agency covered both the
challenge and the trustee's
response.

"When a student government
committee did an extensive
analysis critical of the tuition
increase several years ago ...
we published its report and its
recommendation to the board in
full," Beyers pointed out.
With salaries ranging from
$30,000 to $40,000, personnel
costs alone eat up $780,000 of
the service's annual $1.1 million
budget. Another $211,000 goes
toward production costs for the
Stanford Observer, $54,000 for
the Campus Report and $30,000
for central processing, according
to Beyers.
Despite these high costs,
Beyers claimed the expenses are
small considering the agency's
success for promoting the Uni
versity's prestige and attracting
foundations and philanthropies
to donate millions of dollars.
An informal survey conducted
by the agency showed that the
staff averages $10,000 less an
nually than the public affairs
personnel at other universities
including Harvard, Pennsylva
nia State and the University of
Minnesota.
"One of the most devastating
feelings I ever had was when I
was told our people were over
paid. It is not true," Beyers said.

that "urgency takes precedence
over the important."
He claimed that staff
shortages prevented his agency
from doing in-depth coverage of
Stanford graduate Anthony
Kennedy's nomination to the
Supreme Court and from cover
ing an important conference of
Indian educators at Stanford.

"We just don't have the
bodies," he said.
While the budget needs of the
news service may be in dispute,
the quality of its product is not.
Over the 26 years that Beyers
has been the director, he has
created a news agency that is
nationally acclaimed as one of
the country's leading university
news services. Currents maga
zine, the San Jose Mercury
News and other major publica
tions have all praised the
agency.
But quality news service has
a cost, and Beyers' approach is
to hire well-paid professional
writers, trained as journalists,
who are capable of the quality
investigative reporting he de
mands.
What seems to distinguish the
Stanford news agency from its
counterparts is the agency's
willingness to report controver
sial news about Stanford as well
as the necessary "a d -
ministrivia."
For example, when the Uni
versity's investment policy on
firms active in South Africa was
challenged by students in 1985,
the agency covered both the
challenge and the trustee's
response.

"When a student government
committee did an extensive
analysis critical of the tuition
increase several years ago ...
we published its report and its
recommendation to the board in
full," Beyers pointed out.
With salaries ranging from
$30,000 to $40,000, personnel
costs alone eat up $780,000 of
the service's annual $1.1 million
budget. Another $211,000 goes
toward production costs for the
Stanford Observer, $54,000 for
the Campus Report and $30,000
for central processing, according
to Beyers.
Despite these high costs,
Beyers claimed the expenses are
small considering the agency's
success for promoting the Uni
versity's prestige and attracting
foundations and philanthropies
to donate millions of dollars.
An informal survey conducted
by the agency showed that the
staff averages $10,000 less an
nually than the public affairs
personnel at other universities
including Harvard, Pennsylva
nia State and the University of
Minnesota.
"One of the most devastating
feelings I ever had was when I
was told our people were over
paid. It is not true," Beyers said.


The master of stretching University dollars, Director of Stanford
News and Publications Bob Beyers is now facing budgetary
constraints too tight even for his talents.
Money is a touchy subject, and
for the Stanford News and Pub
lications Service, what it touches
is a raw nerve.
For Bob Beyers, director of the
news agency, finance can even
touch off a tirade about Univer
sity politics, ungrateful
bureaucrats and what Beyers
called a "noble" but increasingly
difficult mission to publicize the
ideas and accomplishments of
Stanford faculty and students.
With 13 full-time staff and an
annual budget of $1.1 million,

Beyers is responsible for produc
ing the Campus Report that has
a weekly circulation of 16,000, the
Stanford Observer and hundreds
of press releases that significantly
impact the media's perception of
Stanford. But recent budget con
straints have made Beyer's iob
increasingly difficult — jeopardiz
ing the quality of news about
Stanford that reaches the nation.
Against the backdrop of scat
tered papers strewn across his
cluttered desk, Beyers spoke with
conviction of the budget con
straints his staff must work un
der.
"I am resentful that having

stayed deliberately small, we are
subject to the same budget pres
sures that other larger and less
productive (University) depart
ments must face," Beyers said.
Campus officials were not ready
to refute Beyer's claim. "Bob
Beyers is in a bftter position to
know (about insufficient funding)
than 1 am," said Vice Provost
Raymond Bacchetti, the Univer
sity's budget director.
"He is one of the masters at
stretching University dollars as
far as they will go. He is the
model."
According to Beyers, budget
pressures hit the news agency
hard last year after he volun
tarily gave away one of his staff
positions to the Public Affairs
Department, which was facing
a staff shortage at the time.
Although the news agency's
staff position has been restored
since then, the agency is still
only at the same level of staffing
it was at four years ago. Beyers
is currently requesting for a
staff increase to meet the de
mands facing the agency.
Larry Davidson, director for
the administration of public af
fairs, is evaluating Beyer's re
quest for a larger staff. David
son said his department is
working hard to "clear up what
the needs of the news service
are," but he has yet to make
any final decisions.
Beyers said the University
has placed new demands on the
news agency for greater cover
age of what he calls "ad
ministrivia" — printing offical
Stanford announcements and
advertising University job
openings.
"These annoucement func
tions do not go to the heart of
the University, yet they con
sume about 85 percent of our
time and resources," Beyers
said. "By any standards of com
parison, there is no organization
in the college news that is doing
as much with so few people."
The increased demands of
these daily chores jeopardize the
quality of news his agency can
produce, Beyers said, explaining
that "urgency takes precedence
over the important."
He claimed that staff
shortages prevented his agency
from doing in-depth coverage of
Stanford graduate Anthony
Kennedy's nomination to the
