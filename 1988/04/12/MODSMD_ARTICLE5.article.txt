# News and Pubs faces cash crunch
## 
### Jeff Album Staff writer 
Money is a touchy subject, and
for the Stanford News and Pub
lications Service, what it touches
is a raw nerve.
For Bob Beyers, director of the
news agency, finance can even
touch off a tirade about Univer
sity politics, ungrateful
bureaucrats and what Beyers
called a "noble" but increasingly
difficult mission to publicize the
ideas and accomplishments of
Stanford faculty and students.
With 13 full-time staff and an
annual budget of $1.1 million,

Beyers is responsible for produc
ing the Campus Report that has
a weekly circulation of 16,000, the
Stanford Observer and hundreds
of press releases that significantly
impact the media's perception of
Stanford. But recent budget con
straints have made Beyer's iob
increasingly difficult â€” jeopardiz
ing the quality of news about
Stanford that reaches the nation.
Against the backdrop of scat
tered papers strewn across his
cluttered desk, Beyers spoke with
conviction of the budget con
straints his staff must work un
der.
"I am resentful that having

stayed deliberately small, we are
subject to the same budget pres
sures that other larger and less
productive (University) depart
ments must face," Beyers said.
Campus officials were not ready
to refute Beyer's claim. "Bob
Beyers is in a bftter position to
know (about insufficient funding)
than 1 am," said Vice Provost
Raymond Bacchetti, the Univer
sity's budget director.
"He is one of the masters at
stretching University dollars as
far as they will go. He is the
model."
