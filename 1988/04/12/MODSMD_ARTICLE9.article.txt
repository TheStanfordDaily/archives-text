# Financing projects: Capital fees again
## 
### Hobby Schrader Editorial staff 
Citing "University
indifference" to
ward funding for
major student
projects, the ASSU
Senate for the
third time in four

years has endorsed a capital fees
amendment on tomorrow's ballot.
If ratified, the capital fees
amendment would allow the sen
ate to request a special multi-year
tax for high-cost student projects
such as building renovations or
new construction. The fee request
requires a two-thirds majority for
passage.
Last year the amendment
received almost 62 percent of the
vote, falling 4 percent short of
approval.
According to Council of Presi
dents member Leonard Adler, a
co-sponsor of the bill, the amend
ment will serve as a means of
prodding the University bureau
cracy to address student needs.
"For the past couple of years,
many in the ASSU have tried to
put pressure on the University
over student projects .. . and it
just doesn't work," he said. "This
amendment gives us the option
to take matters into our own
hands."
However, opponents of the bill
argue that it would shift the bur
den of funding student projects

onto the ASSU and away from
the University. "The bill would
clearly pave the way for the Uni
versity to abrogate its responsi
bilities to students," said Senator
David Teich.
Rather than promoting an ef
fort to buy off the University,
Teich contended that the ASSU
resort to a more dramatic appli
cation of political pressure to .solve
student concerns. "If it's
important enough, we ought to
organize a student protest," he
said. "I haven't seen anyone try
to do anything to mobilize general
student opinion on the office
space issue."
Currently, 70 of approximately
300 student organizations have
office space.
Adler, calling the University bu
reaucracy "hostile to stu
dent building projects," suggested
that by raising a special fee, the
ASSU could alleviate the office
space problem directly.
And with the revenues collected
from the student body, the ASSU
could then negotiate with the Uni
versity to supply remaining funds.
According to Adler and COP
member Jim Durkin, the amend
ment would actually increase the
ASSU's leverage with the Univer
sity.
However, Teich believes that
the measure will divert student
energy that could be more effec
tively used to exert pressure on
the University.
