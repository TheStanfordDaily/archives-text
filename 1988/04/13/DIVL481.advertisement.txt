Hopeful Transfer Applicant
(TO THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES theme):
Come on listen to my story of a rabbit named
Bink, Star of Ufe In Hell, a strip that makes you
think. Well one day Bink was feelln' klnda low.
So he came up wth the plan to make some
dough. Merchandising that Is. Fun garb. Comfy
T's. Well the first thing you know the shirts
began to sell. Bink's kintolk said: "This aint so
bad for Helll" They said: "Hooray tor Califomy
and all Its glam and glossl" So Binky paid his
rent and he stayed right there In Los. Angeles,
that Is. Swimming pools. Obscure cartoonists.
