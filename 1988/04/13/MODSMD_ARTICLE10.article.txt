# ELECTIONS
## Divergent views of the COP's job 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
When students go to the polls
today to elect a new Council of
Presidents, they will be con
fronted with a clear choice be
tween two radically different ap
proaches to student government.
The Energizers, one of two COP
slates on this year's ASSU spring
election ballot, argue that next
year's administration should
build upon gains made by the
ASSU in years past. A New Slate
of Mind, on the other hand, con
tends that a "new approach" is
needed to make the ASSU more
representative of the needs of a
diverse student body.
• The Energizers
Junior Leonard Adler, a mem
ber of the Energizers and of this
year's COP, said his slate's goal
is to "continue the successes and
positive gains made this year."
Alluding to current COP progress,

Adler said present methods "have
been working fine." He expressed
concern that many of these gains
"will be lost" if A New Slate of
Mind is elected COP.
Adler said The Energizers will
be "going through regular chan
nels" to achieve their goals.
"Using our sources and our clout,
we will talk to influential people
to actually get things done," slate
member Sue Kown said.
Vowing to continue the tradi
tional role of the ASSU, Adler
said the top priority of The Ener
gizers will be student services.
Stressing the importance of "im
proving the quality of student
life," Adler said specific Energizer
proposals include universal
laminated student I.D. cards, an
improved library system, better
parking and lighted tennis courts.
The second priority of The
Energizers will be to improve
communication between students
and the ASSU, Adler said. Al
though a better "communication

link" is also a goal of this year's
COP, Adler said much work
remains to be done. Specifically,
the Energizers propose to estab
lish ASSU dorm liasons, a 24-hour
COP hotline and regular COP at
tendance at student meetings.
• A New Slate of Mind
In sharp contrast to The Ener
gizers, A New Slate of Mind has
proposed a "new approach" to
running the ASSU that stresses
increased student and minority
involvement. Sophomore Canetta

Ivy said her slate will attempt to
"transform the ASSU."
Endorsed by the People's Plat
form, a coalition of campus mi
nority groups who nominate can
didates to seats in the ASSU, A
New Slate of Mind advocates ex
panding recruitment of minority
students, increasing ethnic and
feminist studies programs, and
pushing for total University di
vestment from companies that do
business in South Africa.
Responding to criticism that the
slate is "only concerned with spe

cial interests," Ivy said "those
concerns will be put to rest."
Minority issues are not "special
interests" because "the issue of
racism on campus affects all
people," said slate member Stacey
Leyton.
Tactics for achieving student
goals would be different under A
New Slate of Mind, senior Leyton
said. Emphasizing the need to "or
ganize the student body" behind
its goals, Leyton said improve
ments can only be made if stu
dents "face the University with

representation behind them."
Ivy said her slate wants to
"change the way people look at
the ASSU."
"If a student has a problem, he
or she will go to the ASSU,"
Leyton said.
Like The Energizers, A New
Slate of Mind has also made stu
dent services a priority. However,
slate member Miguel Marquez
said A New Slate of Mind plans
to expand the ASSU's present
services to include more non
traditional services.
