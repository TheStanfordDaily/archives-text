# Fee request scramble
## 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
Voting today and tomorrow will de
termine which of the University's 22
largest student groups will receive fund
ing from the ASSU.
Special fee requests from these
groups, totalling $771,933, are one of
three ways in which student organiza
tions may obtain ASSU financial sup
port.
Student group 3 needing more than
$4,000 annually are required to submit
fee requests for approval by the general
student body in the ASSU spring elec
tion.
However, most organizations with
smaller budgets can bypass the general
election in order to receive ASSU fund
ing. These groups apply to the ASSU

Programming Board and the ASSU Pub
lications Board.
The more than 50 groups that applied
for funding from these boards are
divided into two categories.
Established groups intending to put
on a series of programs over the course
of the upcoming school year may apply
for "annual" funding.
If a group is founded in the middle
of a year, however, or if it doesn't plan
events a year in advance, it may apply
for funding during one of the board's
regular "discretionary cycles" which the
Programming Board conducts twice a
quarter.
Three of the 22 groups appearing on
this year's ballot — the Graduate Stu
dent Association, Release Magazine and
X-TV. the Student Channel — did not
appear on the ballot last year.
