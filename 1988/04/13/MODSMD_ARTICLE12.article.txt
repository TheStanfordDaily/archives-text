# Drawing out the reluctant voter
## 
### James Mokhiber Staff writer 
Organizers of the ASSU elections,
being held today and tomorrow, said
they are hoping for a higher voter turn
out and expecting faster returns on the
election results than last year.
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Smolen said
a greater enthusiasm in the election
may lead more students to voice their
opinions at the polls. Forty-eight un
dergraduates are vying for 20 spots in
the senate this year â€” over a dozen
more candidates than last year.
To tabulate the votes faster than in
past years, the ASSU will use voting
machines for the first time in a general
election here. The machines, rented
from Santa Clara County, were tested
in a smaller special election this fall.
Criticism of the system has centered on
its cost, which ASSU Election Commis
sioner Steve Baer said is more than

$5,000.
Baer said the People's Platform, a
political party formed last year by stu
dents to nominate progressive candi
dates for the ASSU, may have sparked
new student interest in student govern
ment.
"It seems like the People's Platform
generates a lot of discussion and con
troversy both within and outside the
senate," he said. "Whenever you do that
you get more people at the polls."
Despite the rise in undergraduate
candidacies, there are fewer graduate
candidates than the number of seats
they must fill. Current graduate
senators hoped to remedy the lack of
graduate student awareness about the
ASSU through a letter campaign,
Smolen said.
Baer said the senators decided to send
letters to all 6,500 graduate students
informing them of both the election and
the issues on which the student body

will vote.
"The ASSU has had a terrible time
getting in touch with graduate students
mostly because they have no meeting
places," Smolen said.
To inform all students about the elec
tion, the ASSU sponsored a debate last
night between the Council of Presidents
slates in Branner Hall. Twenty students
showed up to the event.
Other canl'dates for ASSU positions
gave speeches in White Plaza April 7
and yesterday.
"We wanted the elections to center
more on issues," Smolen said, "not just
faces on a flyer and a cute slogan."
Baer said he expects preliminary
results, without write-in candidates, by
Friday afternoon. Under the old voting
system, results could not be expected
until several days after the polls closed.
The voting system, which replaces the
Scantron system blamed for last year's
week-long delay in election results.
