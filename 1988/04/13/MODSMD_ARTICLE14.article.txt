U.S. marine killed in Panama
WASHINGTON - A U.S. Marine was ac
cidentally shot and killed by fellow Marines
in Panama during a melee early yesterday
morning involving an alleged intrusion by
suspected Panamanian defense forces at a U.S.
fuel supply depot, Pentagon officials said yes
terday.
Cpl. Roberto Villahermosa, 25, of Puerto
Rico, was shot in the abdomen by fellow guards
after his unit became separated in the jungle
while investigating what military officials said
was the latest in a series of trespassing inci
dents at the Arrayan fuel tank farm near
Howard Air Force Base.
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said mil
itary officials believe the intruders involved in
the incidents are members of the Panamanian
Defense Forces (PDF) led by the country's
strongman ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Nori
ega.
"I didn't say we had proof," said Howard,
who added that some of the alleged intruders
were wearing camouflage uniforms. "The as
sumption that one comes to is, of course,
they're PDF."
The PDF press office called the Pentagon
accusations "reckless and irresponsible" and
alleged that at least three U.S. Marines had
been killed and several others wounded in the
incident, foreign correspondent William
Branigin reported from Panama.
Trade bill talks end unresolved
WASHINGTON — Senate authors of a
trade bill met with top administration
officials yesterday hoping to find out what it
would take to get President Reagan to sign
the controversial legislation.
They did not get an answer.
Neither the administration nor the law
makers were willing to disclose their bottom
line on the bill, although a labor-supported
provision to force big business to notify em
ployees of plant closings or mfyor layoffs ap
peared to be the stumbling block to a
presidential signature. Administration officials
continued to insist that the provision would
draw a sure veto — one that would be sup
ported by mtyor business interests, who are
in favor of the trade bill if the plant closing
provision is omitted.
While White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater took a conciliatory position on the
trade bill, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
issued a tough statement accusing the admin
istration of trying to "lobotomize the trade
bill as the price for the president's signature."
Wright cited plant closing notification and a
requirement that foreign investors disclose
their U.S. holdings as measures that help
American workers and should remain in the
bill. Either would provoke a veto, the admin
istration says.
Party contests Salvadoran vote
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Roberto
d'Aubuisson's rightist party has formally chal
lenged the final vote count in last month's
legislative elections, setting up a legal con
frontation that could delay the swearing in of
the new Congress, according to politicians and
diplomats.
In a motion presented late Monday, the
Republican Nationalist Alliance (ARENA)
asked the Electoral Council to nullify the
results of the voting in eastern La Union
province, where the party claims to have won
two deputies, but the final tally gave it only
one.
The difference is crucial, because the addi
tional deputy would give the right an absolute
majority of 31 seats in the 60-seat Legislative
Assembly. ARENA then would be able to carry
out its legislative program without alliances,
as well as name the Supreme Court, attorney
general and other important judicial posts.
Under a complex system of proportional rep
resentation, a handful of votes can determine
who gets a seat, and ARENA accuses the Chris
tian Democrats and the smaller National Con
ciliation Party (PCN) of voiding its valid votes
while approving fradulent votes for the Chris
tian Democrats.
The Christian Democrats and PCN deny the
charges and say ARENA is trying to bully its
way to a majority it did not win.
New Chinese Cabinet approved

BEIJING — The National
People's Congress yesterday
approved a new Chinese
Cabinet, including new minis
ters of defense and foreign af
fairs.
The congress also approved
constitutional amendments
confirming the legalitv of
private enterprise and allow
ing land-use rights to be

bought and sold.
Qian Qichen, 60, who speaks Russian and
English and has dealt with Soviet affairs as
a vice foreign minister, replaced Wu Xueqian,
60, as foreign minister. Wu was named one
of three vice premiers.
Gen. Qin Jiwei, 73, who has been com
mander of the Beying Military Area, replaced
the ailing Zhang Aiping, 80, as defense min
ister. Qin was also named one of nine state
councillors, who rank just below the vice
premiers.
Vice Premiers Yao Yilin and Tian Jiyun
retained their posts.
Altogether, the heads of 41 State Council
ministries and commissions were named, in
cluding 10 new ministers.

Republican Nationalist Alliance (ARENA)
asked the Electoral Council to nullify the
results of the voting in eastern La Union
province, where the party claims to have won
two deputies, but the final tally gave it only
one.
The difference is crucial, because the addi
tional deputy would give the right an absolute
majority of 31 seats in the 60-seat Legislative
Assembly. ARENA then would be able to carry
out its legislative program without alliances,
as well as name the Supreme Court, attorney
general and other important judicial posts.
Under a complex system of proportional rep
resentation, a handful of votes can determine
who gets a seat, and ARENA accuses the Chris
tian Democrats and the smaller National Con
ciliation Party (PCN) of voiding its valid votes
while approving fradulent votes for the Chris
tian Democrats.
The Christian Democrats and PCN deny the
charges and say ARENA is trying to bully its
way to a majority it did not win.

U.S. marine killed in Panama
WASHINGTON - A U.S. Marine was ac
cidentally shot and killed by fellow Marines
in Panama during a melee early yesterday
morning involving an alleged intrusion by
suspected Panamanian defense forces at a U.S.
fuel supply depot, Pentagon officials said yes
terday.
Cpl. Roberto Villahermosa, 25, of Puerto
Rico, was shot in the abdomen by fellow guards
after his unit became separated in the jungle
while investigating what military officials said
was the latest in a series of trespassing inci
dents at the Arrayan fuel tank farm near
Howard Air Force Base.
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said mil
itary officials believe the intruders involved in
the incidents are members of the Panamanian
Defense Forces (PDF) led by the country's
strongman ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Nori
ega.
"I didn't say we had proof," said Howard,
who added that some of the alleged intruders
were wearing camouflage uniforms. "The as
sumption that one comes to is, of course,
they're PDF."
The PDF press office called the Pentagon
accusations "reckless and irresponsible" and
alleged that at least three U.S. Marines had
been killed and several others wounded in the
incident, foreign correspondent William
Branigin reported from Panama.
Trade bill talks end unresolved
WASHINGTON — Senate authors of a
trade bill met with top administration
officials yesterday hoping to find out what it
would take to get President Reagan to sign
the controversial legislation.
They did not get an answer.
Neither the administration nor the law
makers were willing to disclose their bottom
line on the bill, although a labor-supported
provision to force big business to notify em
ployees of plant closings or mfyor layoffs ap
peared to be the stumbling block to a
presidential signature. Administration officials
continued to insist that the provision would
draw a sure veto — one that would be sup
ported by mtyor business interests, who are
in favor of the trade bill if the plant closing
provision is omitted.
While White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater took a conciliatory position on the
trade bill, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
issued a tough statement accusing the admin
istration of trying to "lobotomize the trade
bill as the price for the president's signature."
Wright cited plant closing notification and a
requirement that foreign investors disclose
their U.S. holdings as measures that help
American workers and should remain in the
bill. Either would provoke a veto, the admin
istration says.
Party contests Salvadoran vote
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Roberto
d'Aubuisson's rightist party has formally chal
lenged the final vote count in last month's
legislative elections, setting up a legal con
frontation that could delay the swearing in of
the new Congress, according to politicians and
diplomats.
In a motion presented late Monday, the
Republican Nationalist Alliance (ARENA)
asked the Electoral Council to nullify the
results of the voting in eastern La Union
province, where the party claims to have won
two deputies, but the final tally gave it only
one.
