# Byrd to give up Senate leadership post
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., an
nounced yesterday he will step down
next year after more than a decade as
parliamentary ringmaster for Senate
Democrats, paving the way for a three
way succession contest with potentially
important implications for the Senate
and the Democratic Party.
Within moments of Byrd's announce
ment to his Democratic colleagues at
their weekly luncheon, Sens. Daniel In
ouye of Hawaii, J. Bennett Johnston of
Louisiana and George Mitchell of Maine
told reporters they are candidates to
succeed him as Democratic leader in
the Senate.
All three had been quietly courting
support in anticipation that Byrd would
step down, but Byrd delayed a final
decision until this week, prompting
weeks of rumors, mystery and intrigue
that the National Journal recently
likened to the "workings of the Vatican
in the selection of a pope."

Many senators said there is no early
front-runner, although several sugges
ted that Mitchell could emerge as a
particularly strong contender if the
Democrats choose what one described
as a "bolder ... more daring" course.
In his speech to Democratic colleagues
and at a subsequent news conference,
Byrd, 70, said he is giving up the Dem
ocratic leadership post he has held since
1977 to become chairman of the pow
erful Senate Appropriations Committee.
With the impending retirement of
Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., Byrd is in
line to succeed Stennis as Appropria
tions chairman and as president pro
tempore of the Senate so long as Dem
ocrats retain control of the Senate in
this fall's elections, as currently appears
likely.
Byrd described the Appropriations
chairmanship as both a 30-year personal
goal and a civic obligation to poverty
ridden West Virginia, where he is

seeking election this fall to a sixth term,
thus far without serious opposition.
"I chose that role ... that will be
best for West Virginia and West Vir
ginians feel the same way about it,"he
said, vowing to use the committee's con
trol over federal purse strings to "see
that West Virginia receives the share
for which it is eligible."
There also has been speculation that
Byrd, a master parliamentarian with a
deep love for Senate traditions, may
seek to use the normally ceremonial
post of president pro tem to continue
to exercise a leadership role in the Sen
ate.
While many Democrats have privately
criticized Byrd as a lackluster party
leader who ran the Senate like a "con
ductor on a train," as one critic once
put it, he was valued as a parliamentary
expert who pulled the party's fractious
elements together.
