# Hijacked Kuwaiti airliner lands in Tangiers
## Hijackers exchange 12 hostages for fuel in Cyprus, but at least 35 still remain on board 
### 
LARNACA, Cyprus — A hyacked
Kuwaiti jumbo jet landed in Algeria
early today after the terrorists who
commandeered it eight days ago freed
another 12 passengers in exchange for
fuel at Larnaca Airport.
The giant blue and white Kuwait
Airways jetliner, its departure delayed
by last-minute technical difficulties
with two of its engines, took off at
1:17 a.m., almost eight days to the
hour after it was hijacked over the
Arabian Sea by Shia Moslem ex
tremists seeking the release of 17 fel
low Shias jailed in Kuwait.
The airliner landed at Algiers airport
at 2:55 a.m. local time after its flight
across the Mediterranean, news
reports said.
The hijackers, believed to be eight
gunmen armed with pistols and hand
grenades, vowed in a statement read
over the cockpit radio before their
departure to "continue our journey un
til our demands for the release of the
17 in Kuwait (are met)."
The plane's departure followed a day
that began on a grim note. At one

point the terrorists announced that
they had renamed the airliner "The
Plane of the Martyrs" and said they
had put on their "death shrouds."
Declaring that "death with glory is
better than life in darkness," the
hijackers threatened to "martyr"
themselves and their passengers un
less their demands for fuel were met.
Referring to the Kuwaiti Cabinet
meeting that rejected their demands,
the hijackers said, "We too have held
a Cabinet meeting on the plane ...
and have decided to put on our death
shrouds under our clothes.
"Either our 17 brothers are
returned to us or we shall join the
ghosts in heaven," they said in a state
ment read to the control tower.
Still on board the Boeing 747 are
32 hostage passengers and crew, in
cluding three members of Kuwait's
ruling Sabah family.
However, Cypriot authorities said
they had been given assurances that
the remaining hostages would be re
leased in Algiers, where the bizarre
and bloody drama could end under the

terms of a deal reportedly negotiated
by the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion.
"We were assured they would be
freed in Algeria," Cypriot Interior Min
ister Khristodoulos Veniamin told
reporters. "We have assurances from
the Algerian government as well."
However, there were conflicting
reports that the hijackers denied they
would hand over the plane.
The 12 passengers freed three hours
earlier included two Palestinians of
Jordanian nationality whom the
hijackers said they were releasing "as
a present to the uprising" in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
The others, whom the hijackers
called "a present to the Cypriot gov
ernment," included Kuwaitis, Jor
danians and Egyptians. The hijackers
said they freed them either because
they are ill or poor or have families
with many children.
The freed hostages began descend
ing a mobile staircase beside the plane,
parked at one end of Larnaca's lone

runway, at about 10:25 p.m. One had
to be assisted, but the others walked
slowly to three waiting ambulances,
their flashing red lights casting an
eerie glow over the darkened runway.
A doctor at the Larnaca hospital
where the passengers were taken said
most were suffering from shock, ex
haustion and dehydration brought on
by the physical and emotional strain
of their ordeal. Some were sedated
after they arrived, the doctor said.
The on-board air conditioning units
continually malfunctioned during the
five days that the plane sat in the
Mediterranean sun at Larnaca's
seaside airport, and temperatures in
the cabin exceeded 95 degrees in the
afternoons.
Little was immediately known about
the agreement reached with the hijack
ers, worked out in repeated plane-side
negotiating sessions between the gun
men and a joint Cypriot-PLO delega
tion.
