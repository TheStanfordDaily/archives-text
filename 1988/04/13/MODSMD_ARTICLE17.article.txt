# Iran-Contra judge rebukes attorneys
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - U.S. Dis
trict Judge Gerhard Gesell,
rebuking attorneys in the Iran-
Contra criminal case for daw
dling over procedural matters,
indicated yesterday that he
wanted to begin the trial of Lt.
Col. Oliver North and his three
associates as early as July,
months before either the
defense or prosecution has sug
gested.
In a pretrial hearing on the
case, Gesell demanded an end
to what he called a legal "cat
and mouse game" between in
dependent counsel Lawrence
Walsh and defense attorneys
so that a trial of the four men
could be finished before No
vember's presidential election.
At one point, he warned
Walsh that "ridiculous" gov
ernment restrictions on secret
data in the case, which could
take months to resolve, could
force the dismissal of charges
against the men because their
rights to quick and fair hear
ings would be violated.
Gesell reached no decision on
a trial date. He said the
proceedings should last about
three months and voiced con
cern that a longer trial, over
lapping the November elec
tions, could unduly politicize
the case and afTect the presi
dential race.
Walsh said a trial beginning
in September would be "more
realistic" than July, but said
his staff would meet a July
deadline if Gesell orders it.

However, lawyers for North
and defendants John M. Poin
dexter, Albert Hakim and Rich
ard Secord strongly objected to
the expedited schedule. They
said a trial would last at least
six months and maintained
that they could not possibly
review the 900,000 pages of
evidence and hundreds of wit
nesses in the case before March
1989.
"Evelyn Wood couldn't read
those documents by July,"
North's lawyer, Brendan Sul
livan, told Gesell. "If we all
stayed here tonight and didn't
go home until February, we
still couldn't prepare that case
properly."
But Gesell, who previously
has made clear his plan to bring
the massive case to trial as
quickly as possible, appeared
little moved by the complaints.
He regularly rebuked
lawyers on both sides for wran
gling over pretrial procedures,
and set another hearing for
April 25 — an unusually short
time — to determine whether
Walsh has adequate evidence
against the defendants to
proceed with a trial.
The judge warned defense
lawyers that their behavior
suggests they are "not anx
ious" to begin a trial soon. The
lawyers said they planned to
file a sheaf of motions seeking
to dismiss or modify the up
coming trial on a long list of
legal grounds.
