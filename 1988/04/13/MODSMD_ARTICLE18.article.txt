# Jackson preaches unity in N.Y.

### 
NEW YORK — Sen. Albert Gore and
Gov. Michael Dukakis snapped and snarled
at each other during a primary campaign
debate here yesterday while the Rev. Jesse
Jackson preached party unity, asserting
that he had done more than his Democratic
rivals to "reach out to puli together" the
fractious elements of his party.
The first full-dress Democratic debate
since early March — prior to the Super
yesterday primaries — demonstrated that,
with the field of contenders considerably
shrunken, the apparent substantive dis
agreements between them have faded.
Until Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
dropped out of the race last month, the
candidates often argued about trade. And
during the campaigning in the Southern
states, Gore had sought to make an issue
out of his ostensibly tougher stand on
foreign policy and defense issues —
presumably because the Tennessee sena
tor's advisers thought these views would
help him with Southern voters.
But yesterday, most of the differences
underlined by the three candidates vying
for support in the April 19 New York pri
mary had mainly to do with style and
background. Most of the squabbling was
between Dukakis and Gore.
The only serious dispute that emerged
between Dukakis and Jackson in the "Big
Apple Debate," sponsored by the New York
Daily News and carried by public television,
was over how the party should select its
standard-bearer.
Dukakis said the the nomination should
not go to the candidate with the most
popular votes but rather to the candidate
whose has the most delegates. Though Du
kakis holds a narrow lead over Jackson in
both categories, he is considered likely to
emerge with the advantage in the delegate
count because of the number of "super
delegates" — party and elected officials —
who are expected to back him.
Asked whether the nomination should
go to the candidate with the largest popular
vote, Dukakis said: "No. I think it ought
to go to the candidate who receives the
majority of the delegates. That is what this

race is all about. 1 *
But Jackson, referring to the concept of
"one person, one vote," said, "the integrity
of that must be protected in this process."
He added that while the super delegates
had "a role to play," they should not "su
persede supervoters. I believe power in a
democracy rests with the individual per
son.
In answering the questions from a panel
of journalists, Dukakis, as he has through
out the campaign, sought to emphasize his
experience as a three-term governor of
Massachusetts. But in this debate, Gore
tried to turn Dukakis' record against him.
For example, when the issue of welfare
reform was raised, Dukakis said, "Here
there's no mystery about how we help
people on welfare lift themselves out of
poverty. We're doing it in my state and in
a dozen other states."
Solving the problem, Dukakis explained,
meant investing in job training for the
single mothers who make up the bulk of
the welfare caseload, and day-care for their
children.
Gore went after Dukakis again when,
given the opportunity to question him di
rectly, he brought up a prison reform pro
gram that Dukakis had sponsored in Mas
sachusetts, which granted weekend passes
to prisoners, including some serving life
sentences for murder. As Gore noted, 11
of those convicts failed to return, and two
committed murders.
"If you were elected president, would
you advocate a similar program for federal
penitentiaries?" Gore asked to hoots and
laughter from the audience.
"Al, the difference between you and me
is that I have run a criminal justice system
and you never have," Dukakis replied
heatedly. "Let me tell you that I'm very
proud of my record when it comes to fight
ing crime."
But Gore insisted that Dukakis answer
the question directly, and the governor
said: "Obviously not."
