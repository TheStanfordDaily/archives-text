# Debate over 'Perestroika' key to Gorbachev's fate
## 
### 
MOSCOW — An unprecedented
debate has surfaced in the Soviet press
over "perestroika," the economic
reform programs of Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev, and analysts say the
rancorous exchange may eventually af
fect the political fate of Gorbachev
himself.
Although some criticism of Soviet
society has been encouraged under
Gorbachev's "glasnost," or openness,
policy, the debate in the press questons
perestroika itself.
The criticism of perestroika is
believed to represent the views of a
conservative faction in the Soviet lead
ership, a faction apparently growing
alarmed at the changes proposed by
Gorbachev. The Kremlin leader has
proposed a broad modernization of the

Soviet economy, cutting back the
power of central planners and relying
more on local decision-making in order
to increase food supplies and consumer
goods and improve, among other
things, the quality of health care.
According to Western analysts, the
extraordinary debate reflects to a great
extent the political maneuvering
taking place in advance of the Com
munist Party conference scheduled to
begin June 28.
No agenda has been announced, but
it is widely believed that the confer
ence will become a litmus test for
perestroika. Significant opposition
could arise.
The first volley in the press debate
was fired March 13 when the daily
newspaper Soviet Russia published a

full-page letter headed, M I Can't
Renounce My Friends."
Signed by Nina Andreyeva, a lec
turer at Leningrad's Technological In
stitute, the letter says that "much has
appeared of late with which I cannot
agree," and goes on to become virtually
a manifesto of the conservative oppo
sition to Gorbachev.
Because of the sensitive nature of
the letter's subject, diplomats here be
lieve that the newspaper received
clearance from someone in the ruling
Politburo before printing it.
A popular theory, although it has
not been officially confirmed, is that
Andreyeva wrote a brief letter on the
subject to Yegor Ligachev, the Polit
buro ideologist, who then ordered So
viet Russia, an increasingly orthodox

publication, to print it, and that it was
somewhat embellished by the newspa
per's editor, Valentin Chikin. Ligachev
is the second-ranking member of the
hierarchy and is known to be the
leading conservative voice in the
Kremlin.
The letter calls for maintaining a
balanced view of the Soviet past. It
says in essence that mistakes were
committed under dictator Josef Stalin,
but that there were significant
achievements as well.
"The formula of personality cult ar
tificially embraces industrialization,
collectivization and the cultural revo
lution, which put our country among
the leading world powers," the letter
says.
