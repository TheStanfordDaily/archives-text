# Stanford fund raising tops U.S. college list
## 
### Indu Srinivasan 
For the second year in a row, Stanford
has demonstrated the most successful fund
raising campaign of all U.S. universities,
pulling in over $198 million in the 1987
fiscal year.
In an annual fund raising survey con
ducted by the Council for Aid to Higher
Education in New York, Harvard Univer
sity finished second, with a sum nearing
$178 million, followed by Cornell Univer
sity at about $150 million.
The non-profit organization seeks to pro
vide information about and encouragement
for the donation of funds to universities,
and to emphasize the importance of edu
cation in society.
As a group, the nation's universities in
creased their income by $1.1 billion, bring
ing the final tally to a record $8.5 billion
raised during the 1986-87 school year.
Stanford's jump to the No. 1 position
for the past two years may be because
Stanford is well into the second year of its
Centennial Fund raising Campaign, which
organizers hope will raise $1.1 billion by
1991.
The campaign, which celebrates the Uni
versity's 100-year anniversary, has brought
in $525 million to date, according to the
Stanford Development Office.
For close to 15 years, up until 1986,
Stanford was ranked second behind Har
vard.
David Fulton, press representative for

the Stanford Development Office, said he
believes the University will remain a leader
in fund raising even after Centennial
preparations are over. "If past experience
is any guide, Stanford will not let up" in
its fund raising efforts, he said.
"Stanford has a very good reputation
and people enjoy supporting it." There is
"every reason to expect [that Stanford will]
remain in the top two or three" rankings
in coming years, he said.
Fulton would not, however, make any
predictions as to how much money Stan
ford will raise in 1988, or how much effect
the October stock market crash will have
on potential donors. "We never start (the
new year) with preconceptions of how much
we will receive," he said.
However, Fulton said he doesn't think
Stanford will be making any changes in
their current fund raising methods to com
pensate for the stock market crash.
The 22 percent plunge of the Dow Jones
industrial average in late October trans
lated into a 9 percent endowment loss for
the University. The endowment fund,
devoted to generate income for Stanford,
was worth $1.5 billion at the start of trade
that day, but lost over $100 million before
the market closed.
Because of Stanford's diverse portfolio
of investments, however, the University
fared better than most other institutions,
according to William Massy, University vice
president for Business and Finance.
