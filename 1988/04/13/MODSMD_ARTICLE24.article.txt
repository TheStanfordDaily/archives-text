## Ignore Mario Cuomo 
### 
MARIO CUOMO is an ass. Gather
'round, my friends and find out
why.
Just who in the hell does Mario Cuomo
think he is? Last time I checked, he was
governor of the corruption-filled and
debt-ridden state of New York. Now, for
the 53rd time in the past three years,
I'm bombarded with "Will Mario run?"
headlines and speculations. Hello?
Frankly, I couldn't care less whether
Cuomo runs for president and I'm sick
and tired of hearing this pompous jerk's
half-and-half denials.
Mario, I'm sure you subscribe to The
Daily (excuse me?), so let me fill you in
on a few facts: First, you're tremendously
boring. When I have trouble sleeping in
frosh-filled Branner Hall, I pop an old
campaign speech of yours into the cas
sette deck and I'm out like a light seconds
later.
(Of course, when I've had 14 Cokes in
a one-hour span and my pulse is near
200, a Mike Dukakis speech will do the
trick even better. He's human hemlock!)
Will someone please tell me where
people got the twisted and ill-conceived
notion that Mario Cuomo is "passionate"
and "stirring?" Good God, the only thing
Mario Cuomo stirs is Nestle Quik choc
olate milk before bed.
Seriously, why must I keep reading
about Cuomo's alleged "passion" and
"conviction?" Oh, I get it. You're com
paring him to Dukakis again. Well, com
pared to Dukakis, just reading the Menlo
Park phone book aloud would seem
enthralling (and more factual). I mean,

where is this gibberish about Cuomo com
ing from?
Mario, if you're so hot (and I refuse
to concede anything of the sort), why
haven't you gone through the same gruel
ing nomination process as everyone else?
What makes you different than Governor
Bruce Babbitt or Governor Mike Duka
kis?
These men have given their time and
have discussed issues (albeit very gener
ally) hither and yon. As for yourself,
how's Albany? I ask only because I'm
sure you're an expert, never having left
there in the past three years except for
a few well-timed political speeches in such
random locations as, say, lowa and New
Hampshire.
Mario, here's the biggest fact of all.
You, my man, are in large part respon
sible for your party's precipitous decline
in.1988. Being a vain man, you of course
have to realize (for some shocking reason
thqf, escapes me) that you are a "big fish"
(the smelly kind) in the Democratic
Party.
Yet look what you've done with your
inexplicably huge political capital: You
waffled on whether or not you were run
ning for many months, you stole the
limelight from the people who were run
ning by planning trips to the Soviet Un
ion and Poland at opportune, headline
stealing moments and you've refused to
come clean on your intentions for as long
as the race has been on.
These actions have crippled the Dem
ocratic candidates and yet you remain
coy, ever so cute in your half-hearted
statements about whether you might ac

cept your party's nomination at a
brokered convention. You, Mario, are
supremely selfish, having forsaken the
goals of your party for your own little
games.
When your party needed a firm answer
from you most of all, you continued your
ridiculous fence-sitting. A Saviour you
are not. You deserve, and will most cer
tainly get, nothing.
As a Republican, I hope George Bush
wins in November. Yet, for all that's
worth, I'd much rather see Bush win
after all of the issues have been debated
and all of the positions are known. I'm
disgusted with the Mario Cuomo stories
because they rob all of us of the debates
on the issues that we need to hear.
Mario's headline-seeking stunts and
coy moves are repugnant, for the Dem
ocrats need to avoid a brokered conven
tion and need to very quickly settle on
one candidate who can press George
Bush. With Mario always in the wings,
how can this happen?
Convinced more than ever, I'll go out
just as I came in: Mario Cuomo is an ass.

governor of the corruption-filled and
debt-ridden state of New York. Now, for
the 53rd time in the past three years,
I'm bombarded with "Will Mario run?"
headlines and speculations. Hello?
Frankly, I couldn't care less whether
Cuomo runs for president and I'm sick
and tired of hearing this pompous jerk's
half-and-half denials.
Mario, I'm sure you subscribe to The
Daily (excuse me?), so let me fill you in
on a few facts: First, you're tremendously
boring. When I have trouble sleeping in
frosh-filled Branner Hall, I pop an old
campaign speech of yours into the cas
sette deck and I'm out like a light seconds
later.
(Of course, when I've had 14 Cokes in
a one-hour span and my pulse is near
200, a Mike Dukakis speech will do the
trick even better. He's human hemlock!)
Will someone please tell me where
people got the twisted and ill-conceived
notion that Mario Cuomo is "passionate"
and "stirring?" Good God, the only thing
Mario Cuomo stirs is Nestle Quik choc
olate milk before bed.
Seriously, why must I keep reading
about Cuomo's alleged "passion" and
"conviction?" Oh, I get it. You're com
paring him to Dukakis again. Well, com
pared to Dukakis, just reading the Menlo
Park phone book aloud would seem
enthralling (and more factual). I mean,

where is this gibberish about Cuomo com
ing from?
Mario, if you're so hot (and I refuse
to concede anything of the sort), why
haven't you gone through the same gruel
ing nomination process as everyone else?
What makes you different than Governor
Bruce Babbitt or Governor Mike Duka
kis?
These men have given their time and
have discussed issues (albeit very gener
ally) hither and yon. As for yourself,
how's Albany? I ask only because I'm
sure you're an expert, never having left
there in the past three years except for
a few well-timed political speeches in such
random locations as, say, lowa and New
Hampshire.
Mario, here's the biggest fact of all.
You, my man, are in large part respon
sible for your party's precipitous decline
in.1988. Being a vain man, you of course
have to realize (for some shocking reason
thqf, escapes me) that you are a "big fish"
(the smelly kind) in the Democratic
Party.
Yet look what you've done with your
inexplicably huge political capital: You
waffled on whether or not you were run
ning for many months, you stole the
limelight from the people who were run
ning by planning trips to the Soviet Un
ion and Poland at opportune, headline
stealing moments and you've refused to
come clean on your intentions for as long
as the race has been on.
These actions have crippled the Dem
ocratic candidates and yet you remain
coy, ever so cute in your half-hearted
statements about whether you might ac

cept your party's nomination at a
brokered convention. You, Mario, are
supremely selfish, having forsaken the
goals of your party for your own little
games.
When your party needed a firm answer
from you most of all, you continued your
ridiculous fence-sitting. A Saviour you
are not. You deserve, and will most cer
tainly get, nothing.
As a Republican, I hope George Bush
wins in November. Yet, for all that's
worth, I'd much rather see Bush win
after all of the issues have been debated
and all of the positions are known. I'm
disgusted with the Mario Cuomo stories
because they rob all of us of the debates
on the issues that we need to hear.
Mario's headline-seeking stunts and
coy moves are repugnant, for the Dem
ocrats need to avoid a brokered conven
tion and need to very quickly settle on
one candidate who can press George
Bush. With Mario always in the wings,
how can this happen?
Convinced more than ever, I'll go out
just as I came in: Mario Cuomo is an ass.
