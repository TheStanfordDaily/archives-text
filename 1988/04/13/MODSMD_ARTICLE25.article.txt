## Increase faculty exposure 
### 
WE PROPOSE that every under
graduate be required to partici
pate in at least one individual
or small group faculty-directed experi
ence while at Stanford.
This proposal germinated during
discussions with the Roble Hall advis
ing team — consisting of resident
advisers, advising associates, resident
fellows and resident assistants — in
the spring of 1986.
Of the 185 Roble residents who
responded to our survey, 36 (about 19
percent) had engaged in research under
the supervision of a Stanford faculty
member. Thirty (over 80 percent) of
those felt their experience significantly
added to their education. Of the 146
who responded that they had not had
such an experience, 115 (nearly 80
percent) said they would like to have
one.
Those who have had close experi
ences with Stanford faculty are almost
uniformly positive about them. Yet 14
percent of the respondents to the 1987
Senior Survey felt that opportunities
for individual work with faculty are
poor and 38 percent felt such opportu
nities are fair or worse.
The benefits for students of our
proposal include: definition and refine
ment of interests; building and
strengthening of initiative and innova
tion; expansion of intellectual skills
through discussion, research and proj
ects outside the traditional classroom;
and the gain of faculty friends and
members who know their interests and
capabilities and who can thereby write
substantive recommendations.
The benefits for faculty include: a
steady source of new students to help
on research problems; newly created
options for faculty members who don't
currently have well developed seminar
programs to pursue topics in depth;
the opportunity to combine teaching,
research and advising; greater contact

with undergraduates; the potential to
stimulate greater numbers of talented
undergraduates to pursue graduate
studies in their disciplines; and the
ability to write more effective recom
mendations.
We envision that this requirement
could be fulfilled in many different
ways, such as departmental seminars,
directed reading, individual research.
More opportunities should be made
available, such as introducing seminars
and undergraduate research programs
in departments that have few or none
now. The programs that do exist in
the other departments should be
strengthened.
Clearly, substantial financial re
sources will be needed to implement
our proposed requirement. However,
with the Centennial Program under
way, we feel this proposal represents
an appropriate way to utilize some of
the new resources that will be derived.
We are the No. 1 university in the
country if not the world. Yet hundreds
of undergraduates leave Stanford with
out getting to know even one faculty
member well enough to be able to ask
for a recommendation.
Clearly, they have not had the bene
fit of closely interacting with the pri
mary resource that makes this univer
sity great. Must undergraduates always
remain under the shadow of graduate
students at Stanford?
We feel that a substantial improve
ment in both the quality and quantity
of student-faculty interaction is possi
ble and desirable. We believe that our
proposal, if implemented, will help
facilitate such an improvement.
