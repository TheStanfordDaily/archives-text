SURE service
needs its funding
THIS IS IN direct response to
The Daily's April 12 editorial
recommending that SURE Escort
Service be denied its fee request.
In last year's election the budget
was approved by over 80 percent of
the voting student population. The
total operating budget for this year is
only $1000 more. Our service is
recovering from the apathetic manage
ment and use of past years. We must
have funds in order to restore the
quality, community awareness and
utilization of our service.
The Daily seems to be comparing
SURE and STOP without recognizing
the inherent differences of our serv
ices. Both SURE and STOP are valu
able, so we do not understand why
The Daily would approve STOP and
not SURE. Our job is to provide a safe
escort for people who must travel on
campus alone at night.
Many people have experienced dis
comfort and/or nervousness while
walking alone at night despite the
deceptively safe and immune atmos
phere at Stanford. Our service protects
the personal safety of people who
cannot control their surroundings.
SURE offers a reliable alternative to
walking home alone at night.
The largest portion of our budget
goes towards the salaries (less than
campus minimum wage) of our escorts.
The Daily contends that both services
should operate on a volunteer basis.
However, unlike STOP, SURE does
not have a large pool of fraternity and
sorority members to draw upon.
In the past, we have asked fraterni
ties and other individuals to volunteer
their time, but in general, volunteers
simply are not as committed and
motivated to get to work on time and
remain for the full evening, depending

on daylight hours. STOP volunteers
need only work a three-hour shift,
Wednesdays through Saturdays.
The Daily is correct in recognizing
our need for more equipment (golf
carts, walkie-talkies) so that customers
are never kept waiting, but better
equipment will not improve service
without reliable employees. We have
already experienced a mcyor increase in
usage since last year (when we ran out
of budget money and had to rely on
volunteers).
We expect to continue attracting
more users, but we cannot hope to
adequately serve these people if we do
not receive funding.
The Senate and its Appropriations
Committee has already examined and
approved our budget. We hope that the
student body will consider our position
and vote in our favor.
