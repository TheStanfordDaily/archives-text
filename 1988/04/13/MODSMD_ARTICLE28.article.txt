## What does the BSU want, anyway? 
### 
WHAT'S THE Black Student
Union complaining about now?
If it's not Western Culture, it's
racism in the ASSU. When will they
be satisifed?
We put up with their loud com
plaints for eight years about the West
ern Culture program. OK, so the
program didn't have too many minori
ties in it. Now that's changed with the
new Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
posal. You would think we could get
back to business as usual now.
I don't understand what the big deal
is about the ASSU. So, they didn't
rehire a black woman for head of the
Speakers Bureau. That's the way it
goes. The best man gets the job. If the
best man happens to be white, younger
and have less experience that doesn't
mean he isn't qualified. It can't be
racism as the BSU charges.
I don't see racism around every
corner like the BSU does. Black people
don't get beaten up anymore for
walking into the wrong neighborhoods.
The Bernard Goetz shooting, the
Howard Beach killing, the Forsyth
County attacks, the cross burnings in
Cleveland, the hangings in Concord are
all just isolated incidents.
This isn't the 19605. Things have
changed, particularly on college cam
puses. Black students are overreacting
to minor misunderstandings in these
protests at Stanford, UC-Berkeley, the
University of Massachusetts,
Hampshire College, the University of
Alabama, the University of Wisconsin,
the Citadel Military Academy, Cal
State Long Beach, the University of
Michigan, Columbia University, Penn
State and the University of Pennsylva
nia. I don't see a pattern anywhere.
It's just a coincidence.
It really seems to be a genetic prob
lem with black people that they're

always protesting about something. As
soon as they booked passage away
from the savagery of Africa they
started complaining about the cramped
quarters on the slave ships. Then they
complained about being sold into chat
tel slavery and having their families
separated.
Honest Abe graciously freed them,
but they still weren't satisfied. Next
they started complaining about wan
ting 40 acres and a mule and the right
to take part in the political process.
Things got so out of hand during
Reconstruction that there were even
black senators and governors!
Franklin Roosevelt came up with all
kinds of nice programs for blacks
during the New Deal, but were they
grateful? No. They continued to com
plain all the way up until the '50s
when Rosa Parks decided the back of
the bus wasn't good enough for her.
A century after Reconstruction,
Martin Luther King Jr. and they again
started clamoring for the right to vote.
Something about a dream and wanting
to be equal citizens. Some even got so
worked up that they gave their lives so
others could vote. Is that extremism or
what?
Instead of getting all worked up and
sending in the federal troops to put
them in their place, LBJ decided to
bite his tongue and give them the
Voting Rights Act. You would think
that that would be enough. But, of
course, it wasn't.
This time around it was the issue of
poverty. Seems like one-third of their
people being poor was too much (even
though it's a much higher standard of
living than blacks in Africa). So King
and they started working on the Poor
People's campaign.
That was when he got killed. While
I'm sorry that he had to die and all,

he really was getting kind of radical. I
mean all that talk about ending the
Vietnam War and redistributing the
wealth so no one would have to be
poor in the United States. It was just
too much too soon. America wasn't
ready for that then.
It got a little out of hand, actually.
In the late '60s, there were sit-ins and
student strikes all across the country
just because there were no Black
Studies courses and few black profes
sors. As I understand it, they were
complaining about how the universities
had been built and developed for hun
dreds of years without their input or
any thought given to the history and
culture of their people.
So administrators allowed them to
form BSUs and gave them Afro-
American courses and black cultural
centers. For some reason, they just
can't be satisfied with those luxuries
for ten years. When half of the black
studies programs were eliminated in
the '70s, the complaining began again.
For me, I'm getting a little tired of
the narrow, special interest of black
people. First, it's an end to slavery.
Then, open up the buses and public
accomodations for everybody. Then, it's
the right to vote for everybody. Then,
it's end poverty for everybody. Then,
it's a broad and diverse education for
everybody. What do they want? For
everybody to have an understanding
and appreciation of all the people who
make up our society? Ridiculous.
When will the BSU be satisfied? I
bet they adhere to the words of Martin
Luther King: "We will not be satisfied
until justice rolls down like waters and
righteousness like a mighty stream."
Oh well, guess I'll just have to grin
and bear it.
