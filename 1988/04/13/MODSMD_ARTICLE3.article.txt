# Dorm trespassing rises
## Campus vagrant reported by Donner residents 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Donner residents reported that an uni
dentified male loiterer was in their dorm
Monday afternoon, the latest of several
such incidents this spring.
According to a police report released yes
terday, four female Donner residents ob
served a slight man with dirty, dark brown
hair walking slowly up and down their
all-female hallway. Stanford police were
called to Donner at 5:05 p.m. yesterday
but did not find the intruder.
Residents called police later that night
when a male resident reported seeing the
same man loitering outside his ground-floor
window at around 11:30 p.m.
The man apparently did not make phys
ical contact with anyone, police said.
The Donner incident comes on the heels
of two similar incidents reported Sunday
by residents of 353 Campus Drive. Accord

ing to Resident Assistant Manda Dunlop,
a male resident of the house reported seeing
an unidentified man peering in his window
Sunday afternoon.
Later that night, Dunlop said, a different
unidentified man exposed himself to two
female joggers near the house, Dunlop said.
According to Stanford Police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer, police do not believe the
incidents are related.
Both Niemeyer and Donner Resident Fel
low Linda Paulson said frequent sightings
of transients on campus during spring
quarter are not unusual. Transients tend
to "come and go" at Stanford during spring
quarter, Niemeyer said.
Although most of these transients are
not violent and do not intend to steal any
thing, many of them are "not mentally
stable," Niemeyer said.
"They want to identify with students,"
