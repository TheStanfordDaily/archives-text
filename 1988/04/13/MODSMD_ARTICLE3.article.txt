# Dorm trespassing rises
## Campus vagrant reported by Donner residents 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Donner residents reported that an uni
dentified male loiterer was in their dorm
Monday afternoon, the latest of several
such incidents this spring.
According to a police report released yes
terday, four female Donner residents ob
served a slight man with dirty, dark brown
hair walking slowly up and down their
all-female hallway. Stanford police were
called to Donner at 5:05 p.m. yesterday
but did not find the intruder.
Residents called police later that night
when a male resident reported seeing the
same man loitering outside his ground-floor
window at around 11:30 p.m.
The man apparently did not make phys
ical contact with anyone, police said.
The Donner incident comes on the heels
of two similar incidents reported Sunday
by residents of 353 Campus Drive. Accord

ing to Resident Assistant Manda Dunlop,
a male resident of the house reported seeing
an unidentified man peering in his window
Sunday afternoon.
Later that night, Dunlop said, a different
unidentified man exposed himself to two
female joggers near the house, Dunlop said.
According to Stanford Police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer, police do not believe the
incidents are related.
Both Niemeyer and Donner Resident Fel
low Linda Paulson said frequent sightings
of transients on campus during spring
quarter are not unusual. Transients tend
to "come and go" at Stanford during spring
quarter, Niemeyer said.
Although most of these transients are
not violent and do not intend to steal any
thing, many of them are "not mentally
stable," Niemeyer said.
"They want to identify with students,"
he said. "They look for handouts
and a place to sleep."
Spots on campus favored by
transients include Memorial
Church, Tresidder Union and the
athletic fields, Niemeyer said.
Several students at Donner and
at 353 Campus Drive said yester
day that they plan to pay more
attention to residence security.
Donner resident Felicia Yu, for
example, said she would lock her
doors and check in bathrooms for
suspicious persons. Jeannette
Laflors, also a Donner resident,
said she would "just use common

sense" concerning her safety in
the dormitory. -
The women who reported the
Donner incident to the police said
they were "frightened" by the
"creepy" man they saw. Fresh
man Trina Finley said she "felt
like I wanted to run" when she
knew the man was behind her.
Ironically, Donner resident
Tony Romero said he saw the uni
dentified man outside his window
at the exact time a meeting on
dorm safety was in session across
the hall.
According to police, the in
truder observed in Donner is de
scribed as 5-feet-8 inches tall with
a generally dirty, unkept appear
ance.
