## Stanford tutors get a boost 
### Todd Dereemer 
Lynne Rambin, an excitable first-grader, had dif
ficulty paying attention to Stanford sophomore Ceri
Jones, who was trying to explain how to add eight
and one. Abandoning the addition, Rambin held up
a crayola drawing of herself and said that she was
having "fun" learning with Jones.
Thanks to a donation of $18,700 from the Stuart
Foundations of San Francisco, the Stanford tutorial
program can now help eager grade school students
like Rambin more effectively.
The program, a Public Service Center project, is
designed to help the primarily black Ravenswood
City School District whose student test scores are
the lowest in the state.
The Stuart Foundations, founded in the 1930s
by the original owner of the Carnation Corp., was
set up to aid disadvantaged children. "One of our
special interests is helping public school systems
that don't have enough funding," according to Bob
Funkhouser, president of the Stuart Foundations.
"The donation allows us to pay six student coor
dinators, one for each school in the district," Stan
ford Program Coordinator Magdalena Fittoria ex
plained.
"Last year, I was overwhelmed with trying to
manage the program all by myself. .. . The program
is much more efficient now that I don't have to do
everything," Fittoria said.
According to Student Coordinator Heather
Hughes, "Last year, we had problems with little
things, like rides not showing up. This year things

are smoother because there is better organization."
Hughes, a junior, explained that having one coor
dinator for each school in the district makes for
more personal attention between tutors and stu
dents.
Once a week Stanford students trek over to East
Palo Alto to tutor first through sixth graders in
math and reading and — when time permits —
play basketball with the children.
Nine-year-old Schkerezade Midkiff summed up
the tutorial program in a few well chosen words:
"We do math, reading and lots of stuff."
According to Sondra Arnsdorf, principal of Willow
Oaks Elementary School in Menlo Park, "the tough
est thing that we have to deal with here is the lack
of importance that parents put on school. The kids
need someone to be enthusiastic about learning."
Arnsdorf said that the Stanford tutors not only
serve as role models for the children but are en
couraging reinforcements for the adults as well.
"The teachers are as pleased as the kids are,"
Arnsdorf said.
Stanford students said that working with the
children is a refreshing break from the stresses of
college life. "Tutoring gives us a real break from
the rigors of Stanford," Hughes said.
"The great thing about tutoring is that you get
more out of it than you put into it," junior Chris
Tebben said.
"Sometimes when I'm teaching one of my kids
about how to add one plus one, I find myself back
in the first grade. It's great."
