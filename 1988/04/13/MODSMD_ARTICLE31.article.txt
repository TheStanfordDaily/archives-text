Mia's latest coffee-drinking hang-out:
For Palo Alto's best cafe mocha (in my
humble opinion), try the Palo Alto Roasting
Co. in the Stanford Shopping Center. Located
across from Macy's, with outdoor seating (in
the sun or in the shade!), the atmosphere
can't be beat.
The Rites of Spring:
Sorority Rush came to a close with last
night's Preference parties. Official bids go out
to would-be pledges today. Good luck!
While parties wind down for the women,
fraternity action heats up. I am constantly
being beseiged with (no, not invitations) fliers
galore — what a hectic pace these guys are
maintaining.
Inside Rinconada:
I was talking to Rinc RA David Ransburg
who mentioned that plans for the 1988 Rin
cadelt are taking shape. The all-campus ex
travaganza is scheduled for April 22 in Frost
Ampitheater. According to "the Rans" the
party will be pretty much like last year's —
only better! Most likely, the reggae band The
Babylon Warriors will get top-billing while a
campus band and the LSJUMB will hopefully
be opening.
Extravaganza:
Extravaganza, the annual Asian-American
cultural fair, will be held in White Plaza Sat
urday, April 16, from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m.
Progressive Movement (And I'm not talking
U.S. history!):
Since I'm not a senior, and I'm still not 21,
I'll have to forgo tomorrow night's Progressive
Pub Night — which promises to be quite an
adventure! Buses leave Tresidder at 7 p.m.
(tickets are $10) for a long night of bar-hopping
and dancing. First stop is the Lanai in Bel
mont. Then the revelers will move on to the
Cadillac Bar, in the City. From there, seniors
will head to San Francisco's "Triangle" which
boasts such watering holes as Margaritaville,
the California Cafe, and the Balboa Street Bar
and Grill. - - r -
If you have any energy left after all that,
the group is meeting to dance at DV-8 at 11:30
p.m. San Francisco won't know what's hit it!
