## Album Review Smithereens fail to explode

The Smithereens — "Green Thoughts"
The Smithereens seem to have created
a new genre: Music You Can Do Your
Laundry To.
Not intentionally, mind you. After the
surprise success of their debut album "Es
pecially For You," the group most certainly
entered the studio with the hope of creating
a follow-up record even better than their
first.
The result is . . . well, music perfect for
household chores. Faced with the task of
laying my laundry out to dry before folding
it, I popped "Green Thoughts" into my
cassette deck and promptly realized that,
under any other listening circumstances, I
might have been truly disappointed with
the effort.
After folding the clothes and giving the
album a careful listen, I felt an emotion
that is absolutely lethal to a reviewer —
complete indifference. I could not find any
thing glaringly wrong with "Thoughts,"
one of the most consistent — albeit lack

luster — records released in a while, but
I also found myself standing around hoping
for something more.
Quite simply, the songs lack snap. While
each is a solid and relatively enjoyable ef
fort, none come even close to duplicating
the freshness and magic of the band's
breakout tune "Blood and Roses" that high
lighted the debut.
In fact, the best song on the follow-up
is from the debut. Whether from pride or
prudence, The Smithereens and/or pro
ducer Don Dixon elected to end the first
side with "Especially For You," a nifty but
not noteworthy endeavor.
Of the new songs, "Only A Memory"
(the first single that starts side one) and
"Drown In My Own Tears" (probably the
second single) are the cream of this crop.
"Elaine," a song of romantic regret, also
stands out slightly from the rest.
If you are a rabid Smithereens fan or
have to do a lot of housework in the near
future, "Thoughts" will make an upbeat
addition to your collection. If not, however,
it might be best to hold out and see what
trails they blaze the next time around.
