## Lanzone's: a fine, romantic dinner

Van Nes»s Avenue offers much
for the music-minded Stanford
student — Davies Symphony Hall
and the War Memorial Opera
House — and it also presents a
visual spectacle for those with ar
tistic inclinations. We are talking
about Modesto Lanzone's at
Opera Plaza, an Italian restaurant
decorated with the proprietor's
modern art collection and a fine
choice for concert goers.
We were seated in one of several
intimate rooms, each comple
mented by oil paintings and small
sculpture work from the hands of
Bay Area and Italian artists. After
being greeted by this aesthetic
charm, our waiter presented the
evening's specials. We wisely took
his advice, ordering the antipasto
platter as appetizer, and, as
entrees, coho salmon and capellini

with mussels and clams.
The spread that came before us
on the platter mixed textures and
tastes — combining endives with
seafood, marinated red peppers
and eggplant. These distinct
flavors teased us to anticipation.
Our main course did not disap
point us. The fish was broiled per
fectly, and, sprinkled with lemon,
was pleasantly light. The capel
lini, a type of angel hair pasta,
had a tomato-based sauce and was
served in generous portion. The
seafood was fresh, tender and
abundant.
In the course of eating our
entrees, we could not but notice
the impressive dessert cart being
wheeled around us. Part of this
crew's dining strategy was saving
room for our own plunders, and
after our dinner plates had been
cleared, we ordered cheesecake
and a custard puff pastry with
chocolate and vanilla cream. With
coffee, these delights topped the
evening's fare.

bience. But we especially recom
mend it before a performance of
the symphony, ballet or opera. Its
convenient location and pre
theater menu ensure that time
will be on your side.
Do take time to stroll about the
restaurant before you leave.
Modesto encourages his visitors
to take in the full offering of his
art collection, and, as each room
suggests different colors and dif
ferent moods, one's impression of
this restaurant is truly kaleido
scopic.
A full dinner for two, without
wine, should cost under $50, a
reasonable amount for its visual
and culinary delights. For those
that want to splurge, Modesto cel
lars an extensive wine list, espe
cially strong in Italian and
Californian labels.
