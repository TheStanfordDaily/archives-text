## Stanford hit-men rub out the Dons, 17-6 Card pitchers throw seven-hitter 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO - Stan
ford scored early and often
and got a solid pitching
peformance from three dif
ferent pitchers yesterday,
rolling to a 17-6 victory over
USF at Benedetti Diamond.

Sophomore Tim Griffin's first-inning
home run and junior Ron Witmeyer's two
triples highlighted a 17-hit Cardinal attack,
and sophomore Robbie Kamerschen and
juniors Brian Keyser and Steve Chitren
combined to hold the Dons to seven hits.
Keyser started and gave up one hit in
three innings to record the win, going to
4-0 on the year. Chitren pitched the last
three innings, striking out three to pick
up his seventh save.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen,
meanwhile, extended his team-high hitting
streak to 18 games, going 4-for-5 with a
triple and two RBI,
The non-league win improves the Car
dinal's record to 26-13 overall. Stanford,
ranked 10th nationally by Baseball America
and 12th by ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, is
10-7 in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division going into a four-game Six-Pac
road trip to Southern California •
Paulsen wasted no time in extending his
streak, leading off the game with a single
up the middle. He stole second, then scored
on a single by senior Doug Robbins. After
Griffin crushed a ball over the left-field

fence for his second home run of the season,
the Cardinal led 3-0.
Stanford added two in the third, four in
the fourth, one in the sixth and seven in
the seventh. Witmeyer's two-run triple was
the big blow in the fourth and the junior
ripped another triple — this one with the
bases loaded — to pace the attack in the
seventh.
"Those two (triples) were hit about as
hard as I can hit it," Witmeyer said. "Eveiy
time I go up there now, I think I can hit
the ball hard."
The first triple was off USF starter Greg
Wieser, a left-hander. "I've seen a lot of
lefties this year — it really doesn't make
a difference now," the left-hand hitting
Witmeyer said. "Probably half the pitchers
we've seen have been lefties ... we're
geting used to that."
"It's getting to the point where we're
hitting the ball well consistently," Wit
meyer added. "It's good to get some con
fidence going into the weekend."
The Dons came back in the sixth against
Keyser, scoring four runs on three hits
and five Cardinal errors.
Chitren, however, shut them down
through the last three. It was the best
outing in several weeks for Chitren, who
has had a difficult time in the last three
Six-Pac series.
"We just need to get him some innings
and some confidence," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said. "Relief pitching is
such a delicate thing ... (and) he had a
good sharp breaking ball today."
