# Balking at new rule should stop, discernably
## 
### 
The baseball season is just over a week
old, and the biggest news other than the
George Steinbrenner-Dave Winfield feud
(Steinbrenner fighting with one of his
players is hardly news) is the resurgence
of the balk.

Reactions to the exponential rise in
the number of balks being called by
league umpires have been almost entirely
negative, ranging from the comical to the
intolerant. The San Francisco Chronicle

is running a daily Balk-O-Mania section,
and at least one local television station
has substituted the Balk of the Night for
the Play of the Night on its evening
sportscast.
Oakland A's General Manager Sandy
Alderson has reached the breaking point.
After six games of watching his team get
called for eight balks, Alderson had
enough. He called the American League
office and the commissioner's office to
express his outrage.
Pitchers are being cited for not coming
to a "discernable stop" when they come
to the belt. The necessity of this rule is
debatable. Proponents argue that without
the rule pitchers can quick-pitch,
ing both the baserunner and the batter
oft guard. Opponents claim that the rule
is nit-picky and unnecessary.
The opponents may have a good point,
but their constant bickering in this case
is kind of ridiculous. After all, what are

the pitchers being asked to do?
Are they being told to throw the ball
with their opposite hand? No.
Do they have to throw the ball behind
their back or between their legs? No.
Have they been asked to do a hand
stand and pitch with their feet? No.
They have simply been told that they
must come to a stop when they bring
their hands together at the stretch. Ooh,
this sounds difficult.
I can just see it now: All the little
leagues around the country are going to
have to come out with instructional films
to teach aspiring pitchers how to come
to a stop. Mr. Rogers will be the narrator:
"Now boys and girls, this is how you
pitch out of the stretch," he will say.
"First you bring your left hand together
with your right hand. Can you do that?
Good. Then you hold them there for a
split-second. Good. Now you're ready to
pitch in the big leagues."

The point is that pitching out of the
stretch without balking is about as dif
ficult as getting Tommy Lasorda to come
to the dinner table.
The only thing surprising about the
proliferation in the number of balks dur
ing the first week of the season is that
the pitchers haven't yet learned that the
umpires mean business. The new inter
pretation of the rule was announced
months ago, and balks were called
vigilantly during spring training. Still,
everyone seems shocked that the umpires
are sticking to the new interpretation.
The fact that the balk was not enforced
for so many years is no doubt the reason
that its resurgence has annoyed so many
people. Baseball players, like everyone
else, are creatures of habit. When they
are used to doing something a particular
way, they react negatively to change.
In many cases, their opposition is un
derstandable. For example, the new ex

panded strike zone — baseball's other
msyor rule change this season — has left
pitchers and batters alike wondering
which umpires will call the new "higher
strike," and which will retain the old
strike zone.
Gripes are legitimate when rules are
not enforced consistently. This has obvi
ously not been the case with the balk
interpretation, however. Umpires have
made it clear during the first week of
the season that they will nail offenders.
So the situation is this: Pitchers know
what the rule states, they know that it
is relatively easy to abide by, and they
realize that the umpires are going to
enforce it. I don't know about you, but
it all sounds pretty clear-cut to me.
In other words, if Balk-O-Mania is still
playing before record crowds at the end
of the season, the pitchers will only have
themselves to blame.
