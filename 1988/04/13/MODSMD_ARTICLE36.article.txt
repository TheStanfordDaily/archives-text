# Golfers slip to 10th, Cornelius two shots back
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
After shooting
the finest round
of her collegiate
career Monday,
Stanford senior
Kay Cornelius
returned to

Earth yesterday.
Her humbling 77, coupled
with Monday's four-under-par
68, puts her in fourth place,
only two strokes out of first
going into today's final round
of the Lady Sun Devil Golf
Classic at the tortuously long
Anasazi Golf Club in Phoenix,
Arizona.
Meanwhile, freshman Jodi
Figley rebounded from a
routine 75 Monday with a solid
73 yesterday. Her two-round
total of 148 is good enough for
ninth and is only five strokes
out of first.
Should Figley shoot similarly
today, she would finish in the
top 10 for the sixth time in
seven tournaments this season.
In addition, pending consistent
play over their final two tour
naments, both she and Cor
nelius would almost certainly
earn individual berths in the
NCAA Championships should
the team not qualify as a whole.
The tournament's individual
leader board has changed con
siderably from Monday.
Tulsa's Melissa McNamara
shot a solid two-under-par 70
to tako the lead by one stroke
over Oklahoma State's Eva
Dahllof (72-72) and U.S. Inter
national's Helen Alfredson (72-
72).
Trailing Cornelius by one
stroke is Pam Wright (73-73)
of host Arizona State, with
Washington's Nancy Kessler
(74-73), New Mexico State's
Ceci Stoder (75-72) and Tulsa's

long-hitting freshman Kelly
Robbins (75-72) all tied for
sixth at 147. ASU's Pearl Sinn
(76-72) is tied with Figley at
148.
According to Baldwin, any of
the top 10 players can win the
individual championship.
"They all have the potential to
shoot below 70."
With two of those 10 on his
team, Baldwin is hoping that
Cornelius and Figley can get a
little more support from their
teammates for the team to
score as well as the 306 it
carded Monday. Freshman
Kristin Ryan, whose play is
much improved over the begin
ning of the season, has pro
vided some extra punch, shoot
ing 78 and 79 over the past
two days.
In the team standings, Tulsa
is well on its way to winning
its fifth tournament of the
season, with a solid seven
stroke cushion over second
place ASU. Arizona is in third
at 601, with New Mexico State
fourth at 605 and Oklahoma
State another stroke back.
USIU, which slipped from sec
ond to sixth with a 310 yester
day, rounds out the first pack
of teams at 609.
While catching USIU is a
longshot, Stanford (306-314)
definitely has a chance U4 catch
nationally-ranked New Mexico
and UCLA, which are only five
strokes ahead.
Regardless of what happens
tomorrow, Baldwin can be
pleased with his team's play,
as both Monday's and yester
day's rounds were among their
14 best this season. Thus, ac
cording to Baldwin, the Stan
ford women now need six of
their remaining eight rounds
to make their top 14 in order
to qualify for NCAA*.
