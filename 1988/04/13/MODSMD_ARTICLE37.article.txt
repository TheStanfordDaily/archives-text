Despite Jari
Koho's upset win
over Cardinal
sophomore Jeff
Tarango, the Stan
ford men's tennis
team buried Utah

7-2 yesterday at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.

The Cardinal improved to 18-1,
while Utah dropped to 11-15.
Though the Utes broke through
the Stanford singles corps at the
No. 1 position and the doubles
lineup at the No. 2 slot, the Car
dinal looked sharp overall, not
dropping a set in its seven wins.
"The concentration level was
reasonably good for not playing a
great team," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "It was a solid effort."

At No. 1 singles, Koho dinked,
sliced and lobbed his way to a
6-3, 7-6 victory. Prior to yester
day's contest, Tarango had won
11 straight matches.
"Koho's capable of beating
some of the nation's top players,"
Utah Coach F.D. Robbins said.
"You can't try to overpower and
outhit Tarango. We tried to
change the pace a lot to throw
his timing off.

"Stanford is so strong in
singles. If they put it together at
the right time, they have a good
shot at winning it all."
Apart from the No. 1 match,
the Cardinal had little trouble in
singles with the pesky Utes.
Senior Patrick McEnroe was the
first player off the court, whipping
Eric Chin 6-1, 6-1.
"It's important in matches like
these to get off to a good start,"
McEnroe said. "Almost everyone
did that today and the match
came out the way it was supposed
to."

'Stanford is so strong
in singles. If they put
it together at the right
time, they have a
good shot at winning
it all.'

Freshman David Wheaton
upended John Hogstedt 6-1, 6-3,
upping his record to 12-2.
Freshman Martin Blackman
overpowered Chris Entzel 6-2, 6-
4, and freshman Glenn Solomon
recovered from a 4-1 second-set
deficit to dust off Brendon Bowyer
6-2, 6-4.
At No. 6 singles, junior Curtis
Dunn disposed of Jeff Weichers
6-3, 6-3 to raise his record to 13-2
on the season.
In doubles play, sophomores
Jeff Cathrall and Eric Peus bested
Bowyer and Entzel 6-0, 6-4 and
sophomores John Connolly and
Jonathan Kahn edged Koho and
Weichers 7-5, 7-6.
At No. 2 doubles, Hogstedt and
Chin outlasted sophomore Barry
Richards and freshman Dan Tur
bow 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.
