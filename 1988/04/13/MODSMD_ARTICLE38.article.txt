# Pepperdine coach replaces Hazzard
## Harrick goes to UCLA 
### 
LOS ANGELES - Jim Harrick
was introduced as UCLA's new
head basketball coach yesterday
and said he didn't care about not
being the Bruins' first choice for
the job.
"Did you know that John
Wooden was the fourth choice at
UCLA? I'm serious," Harrick said
at a packed campus news confer
ence, referring to the legendary
coach who led the Bruins to 10
NCAA championships in 12 years
before retiring in 1975.
Harrick, a former UCLA assis
tant who was the head coach at
Pepperdine the past nine seasons,
was hired 13 days after Walt Haz
zard, who had held the job for
four years, was dismissed.
Since Hazzard's firing, several
big-name coaches were inter
viewed by UCLA amidst much
hoopla. Among them were North
Carolina State's Jim Valvano and
Kansas' Larry Brown, who was
offered the job last Thursday
night and accepted it, but changed
his mind the next day, deciding
to stay with national champion
Kansas.
Harrick, 49, said he signed a
four-year contract.

"I've worked every day of the
last 28 years to prepare myself
for this opportunity. I know the
magnitude of this program. I
know what we can accomplish.
We have some great, young guys
in the program. We're looking for
ward to a tremendous experi
ence."
The Bruins were 77-47 under
Hazzard, but only 16-14 this past
season, well below expectations a
year after they won the Pacific
10 Conference championship.
Under Harrick, Pepperdine was
17-13 this season and 167-97
overall. The Waves appeared in
the NCAA Tournament four
times and the National Invitation
Tournament twice in Harrick's
nine years.
Harrick is the sixth coach at
UCLA since Wooden retired. Gene
Bartow, Gary Cunningham and
Brown lasted two years each;
Larry Farmer held the job three
years and Hazzard four.
Harrick was an assistant under
Cunningham from 1977-79. He
took over at Pepperdine the fol
lowing season.
Athletic Director Peter Dalis
said he made up his mind to hire

Harrick Monday night after an
hour-long discussion with Louis
ville Coach Denny Crum, a former
classmate of Dalis' and an assis
tant under Wooden. Harrick was
informed of the decision yesterday
morning.
"When I called Jim this morn
ing I asked him if he was ready
to join me in the toughest job in
college basketball," Dalis said. "It
is, without a doubt. This place is
a fishbowl, it really is. There is
a built-in anxiety at UCLA."
Contrary to what's been re
ported, Dalis said the job was ac
tually offered to only two men —
Brown and Harrick.
UCLA point guard Pooh Rich
ardson applauded the hiring of
Harrick.
"I think definitely it will be
OK," he said. "He'll bring some
things to the program we need —
enthusiasm, discipline. I think
he'll be straight with the guys.
I'm comfortable."
Harrick said he would bring
Pepperdine assistant Tony Fuller
with him to UCLA. Otherwise, he
said no decisions have been made
on his coaching staff.
