# Student financial aid gouged by 'tax simplification' law
## 
### Steve Kasierski Staff writer 
Tax simplification is supposed to sug
gest less hassles before the April 15 tax
deadline.
But to many students looking forward
to Friday, it simply means more taxes.
For the first time many students will
pay Uncle Sam taxes on scholarships or
grants that exceed their tuition expenses.
Students have been caught in a revenue
squeeze fostered by the celebrated Tax
Reform Act of 1986. Although most tax
rates were reduced and the rate structure
was simplified, some student financial
aid has been re-classified as income.
Particularly hard hit will be students,
especially athletes, who receive full tui
tion scholarships or graduate fellowships,

according to Chris Canellos of the Uni
versity Controller's Office. "It would af
fect virtually the entire graduate student
population," he said. "At the undergrad
uate level, somewhere in the area of 500
students might be affected."
Under the new rules, any scholarship
or fellowship amount received exceeding
tuition, plus directly related expenses
such as fees, supplies and equipment will
be counted as income and subject to tax.
Items such as travel and room and board
would be taxable for both undergraduates
and graduate students, Canellos said.
Taxing all scholarship aid in excess of
tuition may put additional burdens on
the neediest undergraduates. Because fi
nancial aid is determined by subtracting
student resources from total educational
cost, students with limited resources of

ten receive aid in excess of tuition.
When combined with normal summer
earnings, scholarship assistance for Stan
ford room and board could very easily
exceed the current standard deduction of
$2,540 and be subject to tax.
Figures on the number of affected un
dergraduates at Stanford were unavail
able at press time. But statistics compiled
for The Daily by the Financial Aids Office
when the tax reform package was debated
in Congress showed that 414 undergrad
uates — including 186 students on "full
ride" athletic scholarships — received
scholarship assistance exceeding tuition
for the 1985-86 academic year.
The scholarship aid totaled about
$973,000 that year. The average award
in excess of tuition was $2,351 per stu
dent. These figures did not include

private, outside scholarships that often
go unreported.
Stanford is not obligated and typically
does not report to the Internal Revenue
Service any taxable scholarships for U.S.
citizens or resident aliens. The responsi
bility for reporting such income rests in
stead with the students, Canellos said.
Graduate students with "assis
tantships" awarded after August 1986
have their awards fully taxable, but these
students have received W-2 forms from
the Controller's Office indicating that the
award is reported as income as well as
the amount withheld as tax.
"Assistantships" is the IRS classifica
tion for teaching or research positions
that for tax purposes are defined as a
job that is a service to the University.
Assistantships granted before the Au

gust date are covered under a set of
"transition rules" which differentiate the
"base amount" of the award from sub
sequent increases. The base amount is
exempt from tax, but any increases not
spelled out at the time of the award are
subject to tax.
The original award is only exempt from
tax, however, if a record is on file showing
that the award was given, or "promised,"
through completion of the degree, Canel
los said.
The new rules are even tougher for
postdoctoral fellows, he said. There is no
exclusion at all on any of these awards.
Many students also face an unfortu
nate combination of losing their personal
exemption while seeing their taxable in-
come climb from adding scholar
ships or grants. Full-time stu
dents previously could claim
themselves as a dependent at the
same time they were claimed on
a parent or guardian's tax return,
but this double-exemption no
longer exists.
"If they can be claimed by their
parents or any other person who
provides more than half of their
support, (then) the student may
not claim themselves as a depen
dent and they lose the $1,900 ex
emption," Canellos said.

Students with tax questions
related to financial aid can get
tax help here on campus, Canellos
said. In January, the Controller's
Office hired Brigid Muldowney as
a full-time student tax consultant.
Muldowney can be reached at 723-
0241 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.
The student tax office in the
basement of Encina Hall will also
have special extended hours to
morrow and Friday, when it will
be open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Late-hour procrastinators will
find some nourishment with their
tax advice, Canellos said.
"We're going to offer milk and
cookies to those who come by at
those later hours."
