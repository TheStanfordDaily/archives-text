# Memorial to honor Holocaust victims
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
A memorial service today will
give the Stanford community
the chance to reflect on the
Holocaust, which brought
nearly six million innocent
Jewish people to their deaths.
The service, which will be
held in front of the Clock
Tower at 7 p.m., is part of to
morrow's national Holocaust
Day of Remembrance.
Rabbi Ari Cartun, who works
with Stanford's Jewish student
organization Hillel, said me
morials such as these are im
portant in order to keep the
memory of the Holocaust vic
tims alive. The service is tar
geted primarily to Jewish com
munity members and students,
because Jewish people were the
"main target of the German
murder machine," he said.
All members of the Stanford
community are welcome to at
tend.
According to Cartun, me
morial services for the

Holocaust victims have been
held annually at Stanford for
"well over a decade." This
year's memorial will take the
traditional form of a Jewish
religious service, and will in
clude readings from various
people who have written about
the Holocaust, he said.
In 1984, when the govern
ment began sponsoring the
U.S. Holocaust Council, a
nationwide organization which
annually holds events to re
member the tragedy, Hillel
asked University President
Donald Kennedy to issue a
statement every year on the
Holocaust Day of Remem
brance.
Cartun said Kennedy was
"quite willing" to comply with
this request.
In this year's statement,
Kennedy said the Holocaust is
important to all people. "As a
university it is our duty to ex
amine the great failures, as
well as the successes in the
conduct of human affairs,"
Kennedy wrote.
