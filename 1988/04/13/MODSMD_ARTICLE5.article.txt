# ASSU Speakers
## No headliners? 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
With most of the academic year behind them,
Stanford students might be left wondering
where are the headline-grabbing speakers who
have come the campus in the past, ready to
inspire and inform.
While media darlings like the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and Dr. Ruth Westheimer filled
auditoriums last year, ASSU Speakers Bureau
Director Terri James admitted that some Stan
ford students are disappointed that the bureau
has not treated them to similar personalities
this year.
After reflecting upon who her group has
sponsored this year, James said, "It is inherent
in the job that we're not going to please every
one." She said she decided to change the focus
of Speakers Bureau this year to avoid paying
for speakers her group did not think were
worth the honorarium fee.
But Speakers Bureau's commitment to
bringing quality speakers to campus was ques
tioned this March when the Stanford Review,
a conservative publication on campus, offered
to sponser Secretary of Education William
Bennett who will speak on campus Monday.
According to James, Bennett did not initiate
communication with her organi
zation but rather with History
Prof. Kennel Jackson of Branner
Presents, a dormitory based group
that recruits speakers as well.
James said, "A rumor spread that
I turned down Bennett," resulting
in a bad reputation for Speakers
Bureau.
James pointed out that the
bureau also rejected the offer to
have televangelists Jim and
Tammy Bakker come to campus.
James said the couple's agent con
tacted Speakers Bureau, inform
ing her that the controversial duo
would speak at the University for
$10,000. Speakers Bureau
rejected the offer because "they
were demanding too much
money," James said. "What Jim
did on the side with that woman
was not worth (publicizing)."
It is unusual, however, that
Speakers Bureau has the option
of rejecting a speaker's proposal.
Usually the organization has to
send out hundreds of letters, fol
lowed by just as many phone calls,
to begin contact with possible
speakers. Of the roughly 250 let
ters sent out this year, only a
small percentage will eventually
result in a confirmation and an
actual appearance, said Speakers
Bureau members.
In addition, James said her
group was stepping up efforts to
work more with other student or
ganizations who want to bring a
speaker to campus. Last January,
for example, the Black Student
Union and the Speakers Bureau
co-sponsored a speech by Yolanda
King commemorating her father's
birthday.
If Speakers Bureau does not
work in conjunction with others,
it will be counterproductive, ac
cording to James. "We're all after
the same thing," she said
According to Speakers Bureau
assistant director Doug Upton,
the bureau has set aside a greater
amount of money in this year's
budget for co-sponsorships.
Sophomore Steve Struthers, a
member of the bureau this year
and last, pointed out that the
group has also tried to attract
entertainment figures such as
television host David Letterman,
but that most are usually booked

one to two years in advance.
An additional difficulty for
Speakers Bureau is that the or
ganization is only in full operation
for the academic year. Some let
ters are sent out during the sum
mer, but the only time most other
communication is made begins in
September. The summer break
creates problems in trying to
maintain communication.
Student groups do not receive
priority for auditoriums or for
Frost Ampitheater, resulting in
further complications in their at
tempt to obtain speakers.
When all their work comes
down to the bottom line, however,
Upton said the bureau must eval
uate whether they "can afford
(the speaker) at that point of
time."
Also, it is possible that if
Speakers Bureau attempts to
bring a popular speaker one year,
that personality may not be able
to come before the volunteer staff
changes the next year. Often stu
dents will credit the current
Speakers Bureau staff with bring
ing a particular speaker when it

was actually their predecessors
who attracted the figure.
James said she thought the
bureau has been effective in at
tracting personalities such as mo
tion picture actor Danny Glover
who strike a "happy medium" by
offering substance and entertain
ment. She also said that of the
16 programs this year, speakers
have been diverse and have
reached out to a more varied
group of students.
However, no Speakers Bureau
represenatives could estimate how
many students had attended the
events or if they attracted a larger
crowd than in past years.
James said that despite some
of the complaints this year, stu
dents should realize that her
group is still developing. Speakers
Bureau has changed drastically
since the 1970s when its main
function was to attract visiting
professors to teach classes and
give lectures.

"Speakers Bureau is not old â€”
it is still in the process of growing
and evolving," she said.
