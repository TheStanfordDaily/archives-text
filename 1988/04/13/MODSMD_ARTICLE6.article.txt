# RA applications plummet: Fewer blacks, grad students
## 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
The number of black students and grad
uate students applying for resident assis
tant positions declined sharply this year,
a Residential Education official said yes
terday.
The total number of applications dropped
to 340 from 415 last year, a 13-percent
decrease, said Asst. Residential Education
Director Karen Kinney.
A 40-percent drop in black applicants
accounted for a significant portion of the
overall decline, Kinney said. The number
of Asian, Latino and white applicants re
mained roughly constant, she said.
According to Kinney, Res Ed officials
have "no real idea" why the decrease in
blacK applicants occurred.
The number of graduate students apply
ing to be RAs also declined sharply, from
over 40 last year to seven this year. Kinney
attributed this to student misunderstand
ings regarding Res Ed's recent decision to
eliminate RA positions in graduate resi
dences.
Beginning in the fall, RAs in the graduate
residences of Crothers Hall, Crothers
Memorial Hall and Manzanita Park will
be replaced by part-time "graduate coordi
nators." The graduate coordinators will be

"RAs with half the duties and half the
pay" who will "delegate more to the grad
uate students themselves," Kinney said.
She said this new system caused confu
sion among prospective graduate student
applicants, giving them the impression that
they could not apply to be RAs in under
graduate houses. To remedy this problem,
Res Ed has extended the application dead
line until Thursday to give those students
more time to apply.
Eric Jackson, an RAin Branner, specu
lated that the drop in black RA applicants
might have much to do with the fact that
minority RAs face more challenges than
white RAs. "Being a black RA is tough,"
he said. "We enlighten the dorm on the
minority issues, and you have to realize
that you are a black RA and that you can't
escape that label."
Jackson added that this year's drop in
black RA applicants might also be due to
the busy lives of many black undergradu
ates. "It seems to me that blacks are very
involved in things like BSU (the Black
Student Union), the outreach programs
and stuff that takes up a lot of time," he
said. "The RAship could be just an addi
tional burden."
Jackson said he believes Res Ed
should do more to attract black
RA applicants. "We didn't do
enough to emphasize the positive
aspects," he said. "Res Ed does a
great job of recruiting minorities,
but I think they can definitely do
more to contact the minorities
personally and get them involved
in this process."
Even though the number of ap
plicants is down this year, Kinney
said competition for available RA

spots remains extremely stiff. Ap
proximately 340 students have ap
plied for 157 positions, she said.
The decline in applicants was
accompanied by a decline in the
number of open RA positions. Be
cause of the closing of Roble Hall
and the elimination of RA jobs in
graduate housing, there will be
24 fewer RA positions next year,
Kinney said.
In addition to eliminating RAs
in graduate housing, Res Ed plans
to restructure its residence staff
in Mirrielees, which houses both
graduates and undergraduates.
Instead of four RAs in Mirrielees,

next year there will be 12 part
time "wing coordinators," Kinney
said.
According to Kinney, spreading
the work of RAs among more staff
members will boost the amount
of "personal contact" between res
idents and staff. "Right now, the
atmosphere there (in Mirielees) is
kind of like an apartment build
ing," Kinney said. "There isn't a
lot of community activity."
Kinney said Res Ed is disap
pointed that the special
"workshops for people of color"
it implemented this past year to

attract minority RA applicants do
not seem to have reached black
students.
Of the workshops, Kinney said,
"We want to give minority stu
dents information on the added
extras that come along with being
an RA if you are a minority,"
Kinney said. "For example, being
a black RA could mean being an
ambassador for the whole race in
this predominantly white univer
sity."
"That's a heavy burden that
some minorities may not want to
bear," she said.
