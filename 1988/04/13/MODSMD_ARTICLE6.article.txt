# RA applications plummet: Fewer blacks, grad students
## 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
The number of black students and grad
uate students applying for resident assis
tant positions declined sharply this year,
a Residential Education official said yes
terday.
The total number of applications dropped
to 340 from 415 last year, a 13-percent
decrease, said Asst. Residential Education
Director Karen Kinney.
A 40-percent drop in black applicants
accounted for a significant portion of the
overall decline, Kinney said. The number
of Asian, Latino and white applicants re
mained roughly constant, she said.
According to Kinney, Res Ed officials
have "no real idea" why the decrease in
blacK applicants occurred.
The number of graduate students apply
ing to be RAs also declined sharply, from
over 40 last year to seven this year. Kinney
attributed this to student misunderstand
ings regarding Res Ed's recent decision to
eliminate RA positions in graduate resi
dences.
Beginning in the fall, RAs in the graduate
residences of Crothers Hall, Crothers
Memorial Hall and Manzanita Park will
be replaced by part-time "graduate coordi
nators." The graduate coordinators will be

"RAs with half the duties and half the
pay" who will "delegate more to the grad
uate students themselves," Kinney said.
She said this new system caused confu
sion among prospective graduate student
applicants, giving them the impression that
they could not apply to be RAs in under
graduate houses. To remedy this problem,
Res Ed has extended the application dead
line until Thursday to give those students
more time to apply.
Eric Jackson, an RAin Branner, specu
lated that the drop in black RA applicants
might have much to do with the fact that
minority RAs face more challenges than
white RAs. "Being a black RA is tough,"
he said. "We enlighten the dorm on the
minority issues, and you have to realize
that you are a black RA and that you can't
escape that label."
Jackson added that this year's drop in
black RA applicants might also be due to
the busy lives of many black undergradu
ates. "It seems to me that blacks are very
involved in things like BSU (the Black
Student Union), the outreach programs
and stuff that takes up a lot of time," he
said. "The RAship could be just an addi
tional burden."
