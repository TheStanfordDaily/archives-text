# Election draws crowds
## But new computer system delays voters 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
The start of the ASSU spring elections
included em interesting feature yester
day, as voters found themselves in un
characteristically long lines while
waiting to cast their ballots.
The lines were the result of what Elec
tions Commissioner Steve Baer called a
"huge" turnout, which he estimated to
be about 2,500 students.
Baer said that yesterday's voting went
smoothly, despite the wait, and attrib

uted the large turnout to an extensive
letter campaign directed at graduate stu
dents.
"Grad students turned out in force,"
he said.
Many voters were not scared away by
the long lines snaking around the polling
sites. Thirty people patiently waited to
vote at the Post Office late yesterday
afternoon, despite the average waiting
time of ten minutes or more.
"The lines actually reminded me about

(the election)," said junior Mic
hele Torres, one of those waiting
in line at the Post Office. "I'm in
no hurry."
She speculated that part of the
increased turnout was because of
the current national election year.
"People are thinking about elec
tions more because (this year's
ASSU election) coincides with the
big elections," she said.
Pollwatchers blamed some of
the delay on the new computer
ized voting system the ASSU
began using this year.
"This year (the voting proce
dure) is more organized, but last
year it went quicker," said junior

Jason Jensen, a member of the
Inter-Varsity Christian Fellow
ship, whose members are serving
as pollwatchers.
Baer cited a general un
familiarity with the election guide
and the new voting process for
the slowdown.
Elections commission members
"thought people would have a bet
ter grasp of things," Baer said.
The new computerized voting
machines were purchased from
the Santa Clara County Registrar
for about $5,300 this year because
of inaccurate results and delays
during ASSU elections last spring.
Baer said the commission would
try to compensate for the longer
lines today by moving voting mac
hines from polling places with lim
ited hours to sites that will be
open all day.

However, there were reports
that confusion attended some of
the voting. Many students did not
realize that there were two pages
for fee assessments and senatorial
candidates and some casted bal
lots without knowledge of the full
lists.
"I looked at the first page (of
senatorial candidates), voted, then
turned the page and realized that
I hadn't seen the full list of can
didates," said freshman Rett
Snotherly after voting.
"If there was anything men
tioning a second page, it wasn't
made obvious," he said.
Baer said that after surveying
all the pollwatchers, he believed
that confusion was minimal. He
added that he had only received
one complaint about the two-page
voting arrangement.
