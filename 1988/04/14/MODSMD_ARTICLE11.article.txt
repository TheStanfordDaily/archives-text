Eastern, Texas Air under fire
WASHINGTON — In a multi-pronged blow
to one of the nation's largest air carriers,
federal aviation officials yesterday fined East
ern Airlines $823,000, launched an unprece
dented plane-by-plane inspection of its fleet
and declared that it would examine the fitness
of Eastern's parent company to operate air
lines.
Between May and September of last year,
Eastern flew one of its Boeing aircraft "on
approximately 511 flights when it was unair
worthy" due to a missing drain tube in an
engine, the Federal Aviation Administration
charged.
Eastern's failure to promptly fix the problem
"endangered the lives" of its passengers and
was part of "a pattern" of alleged safety vio
lations, the agency said in levying the fine —
the second imyor one against the airline in
the last two years.
Eastern President Phil Bakes called the
FAA's citations "primarily procedural ir
regularities" and said in a statement: "We
welcome (the investigation) because we hope
the whole story of Eastern Airlines' dedication
to safety and performance will finally be told."
The parent company, Texas Air Corp., also
owns Continental Airlines and holds the larg
est share of passenger volume in the country.
The Department of Transportation said that
unless the investigation shows the company
is "fit, willing and able" to run air carriers,
both fleets could be grounded.
Marines skirmish in Panama
PANAMA CITY, Panama — About 100
Marines fired rifles and mortars for two hours
at a group of 40 to 50 intruders in dark
uniforms in the second encounter in two days
at a Navy fuel depot near the Panama Canal,
U.S. military authorities said yesterday.
Despite the intense gunfire and support from
American helicopters with searchlights, the
Marines neither inflicted nor suffered
casualties, and they captured none of the uni
dentified trespassers, U.S. officials said.
Army Col. Ronald Sconyers, chief spokesman
for the U.S. Southern Command, the military
headquarters for Latin America, said a patrol
of a dozen Marines spotted about 40 to 50
people in dark uniforms at dusk Tuesday near
the fuel storage depot at Rodman Navy Sta
tion. Shooting broke out after reinforcements
arrived at the site, four miles west of the
Pacific Ocean entrance to the canal, bringing
the Marine force to about 100.
Sconyers declined to say who fired first, but
he said the Marines heard gunshots from the
intruders and saw muzzle flashes during a
two-hour gun fight ending about 10:30 p.m.
Tuesday. He said the Marines set off about
30 illumination mortar rounds and shot three
explosive mortar rounds as well as rifle fire
at the intruders.
