# Meese, Senate wage 'war on drugs'
## 
### 
U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
111 said yesterday that Bolivia, South
America's second-largest source of
cocaine, is entering a critical phase in
its drive to drastically reduce its coca
crop, an effort that officials hope will
significantly cut the world's cocaine
supply.
The outcome of the anti-cocaine ef
forts by the continent's poorest nation
could bring pressure on other mtyor
coca-producing nations, including
Peru and Colombia, to expedite their
own programs to combat the drug.
Meanwhile yesterday, the Senate,
departing from the White House sum
mit agreement on federal spending
limits to launch an election-year "war
on drugs," voted unanimously to au
thorize another $2.6 billion to enforce
anti-drug laws.
Meese gave his report on Bolivia's
critical anti-drug period, expected to
last for several months, to reporters
during a flight back to the United
States from a weeklong, five-country
mission on the Latin cocaine crisis.
The attorney general said the trip
was extremely helpful but made clear
that he expects no short-term solu
tions to the cocaine problem. Although
Meese said the personal review of the
efforts in each of the countries pro
vided "a more vivid picture" of the
problem, he added: "The extent of the
challenge is meyor. We don't see any
quick solutions or lucky breaks."
By a vote of 93-0, Democrats and
Republicans joined in supporting the
extraordinary measure that would not
take effect unless President Reagan
declared that narcotics addiction in the
United States has created a "dire
emergency."

It was added as an amendment to
the $1.1 trillion budget resolution that
otherwise follows the ceilings on
spending and revenues in the deal
worked out by Reagan and congres
sional leaders last November.
As part of its efforts to stem cocaine
output, Bolivia has been paying farm
ers up to $2,000 to stop growing coca
plants, but the program has been ham
pered by the country's dwindling
finances. Bolivia has recently lagged
behind in its payments for the volun
tary coca reduction, and the govern
ment fears that farmers may not
cooperate if the situation worsens.
In a meeting with Bolivia President
Victor Paz Estenssoro yesterday,
Meese said the two men explored steps
that the South American nation could
take to pressure neighboring countries
to pay large sums owed Bolivia so that
it can continue the farm payments.
He said they also discussed the possi
ble use of U.S. economic security funds
to provide Bolivia with more money.
The attorney general said the com
ing months will be a crucial period in
the Bolivian cocaine battle because
police forces have been successful in
recent efforts against makers of coca
paste, processed as the first step in
cocaine production. The result has
been a drop in coca leaf prices, a de
velopment that has made the volun
tary reduction program appealing to
farmers.
Commenting on the Senate action,
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking
Republican member of the Senate
Budget Committee, said, "There just
wasn't enough money in there (the
budget) for combatting drugs." The
budget-stretching amendment was

just one of several anti-drug measures
that are being offered for congressional
approval as the November election ap
proaches.
This flurry of anti-drug legislation
also reflects congressional reaction to
disclosures that the administration
failed to take action against Panama
nian dictator Manuel Noriega until re
cently, despite overwhelming evidence
that he was profiting from the Latin
American drug trade.
The Senate may vote as early as
today on a measure that would impose
sanctions on Mexico for failing to
cooperate with U.S. efforts to stem

the flow of illegal drugs from Latin
America into the United States. Two
congressional panels have deadlocked
this week on similar legislation to
penalize drug-supplier nations in the
Western hemisphere.
In addition, the Senate earlier yes
terday approved another budget
amendment authored by Rep. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., that would shift $125
million from government travel al
lowances. Instead, $100 million would
be used to build prisons and $25 mil
lion would go to create a drug-fighting
division of the Treasury Department.

was extremely helpful but made clear
that he expects no short-term solu
tions to the cocaine problem. Although
Meese said the personal review of the
efforts in each of the countries pro
vided "a more vivid picture" of the
problem, he added: "The extent of the
challenge is meyor. We don't see any
quick solutions or lucky breaks."
By a vote of 93-0, Democrats and
Republicans joined in supporting the
extraordinary measure that would not
take effect unless President Reagan
declared that narcotics addiction in the
United States has created a "dire
emergency."

It was added as an amendment to
the $1.1 trillion budget resolution that
otherwise follows the ceilings on
spending and revenues in the deal
worked out by Reagan and congres
sional leaders last November.
As part of its efforts to stem cocaine
output, Bolivia has been paying farm
ers up to $2,000 to stop growing coca
plants, but the program has been ham
pered by the country's dwindling
finances. Bolivia has recently lagged
behind in its payments for the volun
tary coca reduction, and the govern
ment fears that farmers may not
cooperate if the situation worsens.
In a meeting with Bolivia President
Victor Paz Estenssoro yesterday,
Meese said the two men explored steps
that the South American nation could
take to pressure neighboring countries
to pay large sums owed Bolivia so that
it can continue the farm payments.
He said they also discussed the possi
ble use of U.S. economic security funds
to provide Bolivia with more money.
The attorney general said the com
ing months will be a crucial period in
the Bolivian cocaine battle because
police forces have been successful in
recent efforts against makers of coca
paste, processed as the first step in
cocaine production. The result has
been a drop in coca leaf prices, a de
velopment that has made the volun
tary reduction program appealing to
farmers.
Commenting on the Senate action,
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking
Republican member of the Senate
Budget Committee, said, "There just
wasn't enough money in there (the
budget) for combatting drugs." The
budget-stretching amendment was

just one of several anti-drug measures
that are being offered for congressional
approval as the November election ap
proaches.
This flurry of anti-drug legislation
also reflects congressional reaction to
disclosures that the administration
failed to take action against Panama
nian dictator Manuel Noriega until re
cently, despite overwhelming evidence
that he was profiting from the Latin
American drug trade.
The Senate may vote as early as
today on a measure that would impose
sanctions on Mexico for failing to
cooperate with U.S. efforts to stem

the flow of illegal drugs from Latin
America into the United States. Two
congressional panels have deadlocked
this week on similar legislation to
penalize drug-supplier nations in the
Western hemisphere.
In addition, the Senate earlier yes
terday approved another budget
amendment authored by Rep. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., that would shift $125
million from government travel al
lowances. Instead, $100 million would
be used to build prisons and $25 mil
lion would go to create a drug-fighting
division of the Treasury Department.
