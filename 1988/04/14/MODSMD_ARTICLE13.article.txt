# Algerian officials, hijackers negotiate
## Released hostages say Iran may have been involved with the hijacking 
### 
Algerian officials boarded a hijacked
Kuwaiti Airlines jumbo jet three times
yesterday to talk in secret with the
terrorists who control it and to try to
negotiate an end to the nine-day ordeal
that has cost the lives of two pas
sengers so far.
With no result evident from the
talks, hopes were dampened that an
agreement had been worked out with
the hijackers, who are thought to be
Shia Moslem Lebanese.
The secrecy, however, eased some
of the sense of fear and crisis, at least
outside the plane. No more death
threats could be heard in public, be
cause the hijackers no longer were
making their demands by radio to the
airport control tower.
After talking with the hyackers, the
Algerian officials conferred with
Kuwaiti officials who had flown to Al
giers yesterday afternoon. Asked

whether Kuwait was now ready to free
any of the 17 Shia prisoners whose
release had been demanded by the
hijackers, Mohammed Saud al Osaimi,
the Kuwaiti minister of state for
foreign affairs, replied: "We are a na
tion of laws, and we will remain a
nation of laws."
Three crewmen and 29 passengers,
including three members of Kuwait's
ruling al Sabah family, remained on
board as hostages after 12 passengers
were freed in Larnaca, Cyprus, Tues
day night.
At least one hijacker boarded a com
mandeered Kuwaiti jumbo jet in Iran,
bringing along explosives and machine
guns, several of the hostages released
from the plane in Cyprus said yester
day.
At the same time, Palestine Liber
ation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat, who has been trying to secure

the release of the remaining hostages,
was quoted as accusing Iran of mas
terminding the nine-day hijacking.
Iran, the first country to which the
hijackers flew after taking over the
Kuwait Airways Boeing 747 last Tues
day, has denied it had anything to do
with the hijacking.
However, there is growing evidence
— albeit mostly circumstantial — that
the Iranians at least abetted the
Hijackers, even if they did not plan
the deed itself.
Several Western and Arab diplomats
in the region, speaking on the condi
tion of anonymity, added that they
considered it extremely likely that
Iran, or some faction within Iran, was
behind the hyacking.
And although the diplomats
conceded that they had no hard
evidence, their conviction was
strengthed by the testimony of the

freed hostages themselves. Several of
the former captives said that more
hijackers and heavier arms suddenly
appeared on the hijacked plane after
it landed at Mashhad airport in north
eastern Iran.
It had been widely reported from
Cyprus that a deal had been reached
in which terrorists would release the
remaining hostages in Algiers,
presumably in return for their own
freedom. In fact, Cypriot Interior Min
ister Khristodoulous Veniamin told
reporters at Larnaca Tuesday night,
"We were assured they would be freed
in Algeria."
However, the hijackers, in a state
ment read from the cockpit before the
plane took off for Algiers, vowed to
"continue our journey until our de
mands for the release of the 17 in
Kuwait (are met)."
