## Fight society's limits 
### 
IN 1928, Anne Morrow, a Smith un
dergraduate wrote, before she mar
ried Charles Lindbergh:
"I must say over and over to myself:
Make your world count. It is little, but
you must find something here. I am
trying to work it out. What do I want
to do; what can I do? The nearest I can
get to it is that perhaps I could be useful
and happy trying to help people to ap
preciate (by teaching or some other way
— writing perhaps and perhaps through
a family and children) the things I care
most about: the beauty and poise and
completion of flowers or birds or music,
of some writing, of some people —
glimpses of perfection in all of these."
Morrow writes poignant prose, not only
expressing the yearnings and challenges
faced by women of her decade, but also
those of our own.
The sentiments she addresses are rel
evant in many ways to women at Stan
ford. Women deciding the area of their
specialty and women graduating soon to
pursue work in their chosen areas of
specialty must face the same questions:
"What do I want to do? What can I do?"
In answering these questions, it is im
portant that women look beyond the
limitations imposed by society and focus
instead on their sense of personal hap
piness.
It is easy to allow ourselves as women
to unquestioningly accept and fall into
the stereotypical image of the '80s era,
that of the "superwoman." But it is cer
tainly not the case that all women at

Stanford should be pushed into the career
woman-mother-wife-homemaker and su
perwoman role.
In a world where women were first
told how to behave, where to behave and
what we could and could not do with our
lives, it is important to stand strong and
focus both on the unique qualities inher
ent in being a women and on the course
that we as women would like to set for
ourselves and our futures.
There are thousands of avenues open
to female college graduates in this coun
try today. Yet it seems that those who
choose to go into unglorified fields like
teaching, nursing, public service and even
homemaking are denied the respect and
social approval from their peers that they
deserve.
Trading in the stereotypes of hundreds
of years of servitude, submission and
domesticity for those that go with the
label of "superwoman" is not progress.
It is further acceptance of restrictive
societal norms that serve in many cases
to make women and men less responsive
to their own personal needs and happi
ness.
In the past 60 years, there has been
an extraordinary amount of progress and
growth in the women's movement.
Women have seen in these years much
evolution and permutatuion that is now
taken for granted.
The right to a voice in politics, Title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the
struggles of the Equal Rights Amend
ment, the passage of equal pay legislation
and the right to be educated: All of these

speak clearly that "anatomy is no longer
destiny." Most importantly, they empha
size the glowing prize in a series of
modest victories — that of freedom of
choice, freedom to "craft the self."
Bearing the burdens of living up to
stereotypes forces women and men to
define themselves in terms of values that
are not their own. Repression of drives
and channeling of energy in directions
that are unfulfilling leaves us numb and
grounded, shackled by our sex rather
than enriched by it.
Hopefully, many hard years of fighting
for the right to be indomitably indepen
dent in feeling, thought and action won't
be lost by a generation that conforms to
images at the expense of their own hap
piness and personal choice.
Each woman who graduates this year
has the pleasure or pain of making her
own decisions. Hopefully, when these de
cisions are made with respect to career
and personal identity, the rewards of ma
terial success won't be accomplished at
the expense of the strength and beauty
and nurturance that is unique to women.

Bearing the burdens of living up to
stereotypes forces women and men to
define themselves in terms of values that

the expense of the strength and beauty
and nurturance that is unique to women.
