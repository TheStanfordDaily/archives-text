## Add women to work force 
### 
ON MY WAY to and from work, I
have deliberately observed the
composition of the work force
on the facilities being constructed
adjacent to Encina tennis courts. To
date, with one exception, this work
force has been comprised of white
males.
A msgor part of these facilities will
be named to honor Amy Blue — whose
office oversees facility construction at
Stanford and who has expressed a
personal desire to have women repre
sented on such work forces.
Consequently, while there is still
ample time, I believe she would be
honored further if her wishes were
made manifest in all phases in the
construction and equipping of these
facilities.
It would not hurt to include racial
minorities.

On that score, 30 years ago racial
minorities were told it would be diffi
cult for them to break into trade
unions because of seniority. It is there
fore ironic that the average age of the
current all-white male work force is
about 30.
The young men on this job were
practically guaranteed a job 30 years
ago because of their sex and race.
It makes you think about the com
plaint of the current mcgority popula
tion that it should not have to suffer
for the actions of prior generations
against minorities and women, yet it
continues to reap the benefits of those
actions.
This is an opportune occasion to put
life into the University's otherwise
defunct external affirmative action
program.
