# Trustees: IBM out of South Africa
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Taking a more aggressive stance in pressuring
companies to release their holdings in South Africa,
a Board of Trustees committee approved a share
holder resolution Tuesday calling for IBM to sever
all economic ties with South Africa until apartheid
ends.
The decision by the trustees' Special Committee
on Investment Responsibility is significant, said
Kirk Hanson, co-chair of the University's Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility, because it is the
first time the trustees have addressed a resolution
asking a company to go beyond withdrawal to break
ing all economic ties.
The CIR is a 12-member group of students, faculty
and alumni that advises the SCIR on investment
issues.
The shareholder resolution approved by the SCIR
called for IBM — which accounts for 9.8 percent
of Stanford's total holdings in South Africa
connected companies — to stop all sales of com
puters and services to South Africa.
While happily surprised by the SCIR's immediate
approval of the resolution, the CIR nevertheless
reaffirmed its recommendation for a stronger overall
disinvestment policy, although the SCIR rejected
that proposal last month.
The CIR continues to urge the SCIR to vote for
all resolutions which call for corporations to with
draw from South Africa, under a blanket disinvest
ment policy.
Under the present selective disinvestment policy,
the SCIR considers withdrawal resolutions on a
case-by-case basis and may either vote in favor of
such resolutions or not vote on
them at all. According to its
policy, the trustees may not reject
a withdrawal resolution.
Hanson, a lecturer in the Grad
uate School of Business, said the
resolution concerning IBM is part
of "the first batch" of resolutions
asking corporations to disinvest
from South Africa that the SCIR
will consider this spring. Hanson
estimated that the SCIR will con
sider 10 more resolutions.
In a telephone conference this
week, the six SCIR members also
considered a resolution asking
American Cyanamid to terminate
all sales of water treatment
chemicals to Escom, the state
owned electric corporation that
produces 90 percent of South
Africa's electricity.
Although the CIR unanimously
recommended that Stanford vote
in favor of the resolution concern
ing American Cyanamid, the
SCIR postponed its decision until
it obtains further information on
American Cyanamid's sales of

chemicals to Escom.
Stanford holds 1,000 shares of
American Cyanamid valued at
$48,500 while its IBM holdings
tally to 142,285 shares valued at
$16.7 million.
Although IBM sold its South
African subsidiary a year ago, the
newly independent company, In
formation Systems Management,
still distributes IBM products in
South Africa.
Most CIR and SCIR members
agreed that IBM's withdrawal in
March 1987 was a "sham with
drawal," Hanson said.
In urging the SCIR to vote in
favor of the resolution, the CIR
said that "business should not
continue 'as usual' by simply
changing the ownership of the
South African subsidiary."
Judging from the SCIR's deci
sion concerning IBM, Hanson said
the SCIR and CIR members both
share the belief that "if a company
is withdrawing from South Africa,
it ought to break all economic
ties."
In defense of a blanket disin
vestment policy instead of selec
tive disinvestment, Hanson said
the CIR "wanted to let the SCIR

know (that) we still differ with
the announced position of the
SCIR."
"[We] believe that sufficient
evidence has accumulated to war
rant voting in favor of all the
withdrawal resolutions."
Also, Hanson said the CIR still
disagrees with the SCIR's position
that corporate withdrawal from
South Africa will be ineffective in
combatting apartheid unless it is
done collectively.
"There is no morally defensible
reason" for corporations to stay
in South Africa, Hanson added.
"The net effect (of their presence)
is negative."
According to the CIR, Escom
discriminates against non-white
South Africans by providing them
only sparingly with electricity,
contributing to the country's so
cial stratification and apartheid
system.
Acknowledging the ClR's advice
on this issue as well as American
Cyanamid's claim that Escom
"serves the whole of South
Africa," the SCIR directed Uni
versity staff to promptly investi
gate the matter by writing to
American Cyanamid.
