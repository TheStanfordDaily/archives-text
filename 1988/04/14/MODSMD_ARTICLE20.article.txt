# Fishbone's songs sexist
## 
### 
I attended Fishbone's concert in
White Plaza Tuesday afternoon and
was furious at the blatant sexism con
tained in lyrics and various comments
made to the crowd.
I was made uncomfortable when
they started singing "I want soipe pus
sy" — when will women stop being
treated solely as sexual objects? I
realize those lyrics were written by
another group — this is no excuse.
Then Fishbone introduced their song
"Lying-ass Bitch." One member of the
group told the men in the crowd to
turn to those women who had
"dogged" them the most and tell them
they are hated because they are "lying
ass bitches."
This comment was followed by a
statement to the effect that they were

going to be so misogynous that the
"lesbians in Seattle" would hear about
it.
Many people in the crowd cheered
when these comments were made. At
first I was uncertain if I had heard
correctly. Could it be that those who
cheered were also not certain of what
was being said?
It is more likely that Fishbone's
comments as well as the reaction of
some Stanford students result from a
deep-rooted lack of respect for women
that exists in both our university and
our society; the above example is but
one manifestation of sexist attitudes
that harm both women and men.
