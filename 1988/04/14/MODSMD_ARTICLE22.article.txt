# Point/Counterpoint
## The 						Palestinian state Should Israel bear responsibility for Palestinian problem ? 
### 
The inhabitants of
America are the
Americans, of Java
the Javanese, of
San Marino the
San Marinese. But
I somehow, a group

or mainly European immigrants
to Palestine decreed in 1948 that
the inhabitants of Palestine are
the Israelis.
What happenned to the Pales
tinians? According to the original
Israeli version, they did not "real
ly" exist — the cities they left
just happened to be.
In all the countries surrounding
the said land, there are millions
of people who claim they are Pal
estinian, have a Palestinian flag
and a Palestinian identity. They
live in tents. They say they were
expelled and those who did not
leave were massacred.
But the Israelis retort that all
these people are merely the con
fused products of spontaneous
generation.
Wars are fought. The Palestin
ians lose; they still live in tents
and a few of them engage in ter
rorism. But the Israelis do not
need to resume their pre-1948 ter
rorism: They now have propa
ganda, Ml6s, Flss and Special
Services to do the dirty jobs. They
are a respected international en
tity. They do not murder; they
raid.

The implementation of
Zionism was
colonialism —
colonialism that has
been (unsuccessfully)
opposed.

Since last December, the Is
raelis have been facing civil
unrest in territories they illegally
occupy. The latter are inhabited
by over a million of those confused
blokes who stubbornly claim that
they are Palestinian.
Over 100 of them, mainly
teenagers, have been shot dead.
Thousands of them have been
savagely beaten up. United Na
tions officials protest the ruthless
battering of the elderly. Israeli
soldiers try to bury four demon
strators alive with a bulldozer, but
the media broadcasts the news
throughout the world: The sol
diers are "reprimanded" and get
four-month jail terms; their com
manding officer is not re
moved.
Israel's hackneyed dialectics
and its grotesque political ges
ticulations cannot change the fact
that the implementation of
Zionism was colonialism —

colonialism that has been (unsuc
cessfully) opposed.
Zionism provoked the migration
of the Palestinian population. The
central problem involves land; it
will only be resolved through land.
The Israelis belong in Israel —
let's not repeat bad history.
Similarly, the Palestinians belong
in Palestine (in the occupied ter
ritories).
The UN ought to guarantee the
existence and the security of both
an Israeli state and a Palestinian
state and to encourage their
cooperation. The inexorable logic
of the sociopolitical destiny of the
Middle East foretells the Pales
tinian State.
It is high time Israeli leaders
realized that history cannot be
fooled forever. Their current pol
icies of fire and blood merely in
sure that they will, sooner or lat
er, share the fate of the French
in Algeria in 1962.
As to their outrageous actions
in the occupied territories, one
does not find in their beginning
"the World," but a primitive and
criminal cry that sprang from the
depth of the zoological world and
that now ought to be superseded
by a serene respect for human
life and human dignity.

Is it possible for a
Palestinian state
to exist alongside
Israel? The pro
posal was first
made in 1947
when the United

Nations divided its mandate be
tween the Jews and the Palestin
ians. The Jews said yes and chose
peace; the Arabs said no and chose
war.
Twenty years later, Israel was
again invaded from all sides yet
survived and gained land. Israel
immediately moved to give back
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
in exchange for peace. This plan
was met with the unanimous re
jection by the Arab League's three
no's: no peace, no negotiation and
no recognition of Israel. Except
for Egypt, the Arab position
remains unchanged.
A key propaganda device of Is
rael's opponents is to portray Is
rael as the Goliath of the region.
Images of soldiers beating rioters
may show this, but there are cer
tain things which television does
not show.
Israel is a nation of 8,000
square miles and four million
people surrounded by Arab states
with 5,300,000 square miles and
180 million people.
Twenty-one of 22 Arab states
are technically in a state of
declared war against Israel. Their

If people see the con
flict as Israeli-Palestin
ian instead of Israeli-
Arab, it is because of
Arab indifference to
the Palestinians.

commitment to destroy Israel has
caused all five mcyor Middle East
wars. And while Arab states may
live to fight another day, Israel
knows its first defeat will be its
last.
If people see the conflict as
Israeli-Palestinian instead of
Israeli-Arab, it is because of Arab
indifference to the Palestinians.
Jordan and Egypt ruled the West
Bank and Gaza for 20 years, yet
did not give Palestinians autono
my. While Israel absorbed
800,000 Jewish refugees from
Arab lands, the Arabs refused to
help their refugees.
While the Arabs continue to
treat the Palestinians as a polit
ical football, Israel knows that
demographics will require Israel
to relinquish its democratic na
ture, its Jewishness or the ter
ritories. Most Israelis will opt for
the third choice. But if Israel is
to cede land, it must receive peace

in return.
But does the Palestinian Liber
ation Organization want peace or
Israel's destruction? The PLO
charter eschews diplomacy:
"Armed struggle is the only way
to liberate Palestine." PLO leader
Yasir Arafat seeks all of Israel,
not only the West Bank and Gaza.
The PLO charter was written in
1964 and has not been amended
since.
While Arafat may claim "the
goal of our struggle is the end of
Israel, and there can be no com
promise," there are many Pales
tinians who would compromise:
recognize Israel's existence in ex
change for land and the chance
to live in their own self-governing
state.
Unfortunately, the advocacy of
any peace with Israel is considered
a capital crime in the Arab world,
to which the assassinations of An
war Sadat and other moderate
Arab leaders will attest.
If Palestinians can place their
aspirations for autonomy over the
grandiose ambitions of Arafat and
the Arab League, peaceful coex
istence can be achieved. The Pal
estinians want peace, and they
want a homeland. Israel wants
peace, and it wants security. The
two need not be exclusive.

Israel is a nation of 8,000

commitment to destroy Israel has
caused all five mcyor Middle East
wars. And while Arab states may
live to fight another day, Israel
knows its first defeat will be its
last.
If people see the conflict as
Israeli-Palestinian instead of
Israeli-Arab, it is because of Arab
indifference to the Palestinians.
Jordan and Egypt ruled the West
Bank and Gaza for 20 years, yet
did not give Palestinians autono
my. While Israel absorbed
800,000 Jewish refugees from
Arab lands, the Arabs refused to
help their refugees.
While the Arabs continue to
treat the Palestinians as a polit
ical football, Israel knows that
demographics will require Israel
to relinquish its democratic na
ture, its Jewishness or the ter
ritories. Most Israelis will opt for
the third choice. But if Israel is
to cede land, it must receive peace

in return.
But does the Palestinian Liber
ation Organization want peace or
Israel's destruction? The PLO
charter eschews diplomacy:
"Armed struggle is the only way
to liberate Palestine." PLO leader
Yasir Arafat seeks all of Israel,
not only the West Bank and Gaza.
The PLO charter was written in
1964 and has not been amended
since.
While Arafat may claim "the
goal of our struggle is the end of
Israel, and there can be no com
promise," there are many Pales
tinians who would compromise:
recognize Israel's existence in ex
change for land and the chance
to live in their own self-governing
state.
Unfortunately, the advocacy of
any peace with Israel is considered
a capital crime in the Arab world,
to which the assassinations of An
war Sadat and other moderate
Arab leaders will attest.
If Palestinians can place their
aspirations for autonomy over the
grandiose ambitions of Arafat and
the Arab League, peaceful coex
istence can be achieved. The Pal
estinians want peace, and they
want a homeland. Israel wants
peace, and it wants security. The
two need not be exclusive.

I somehow, a group

to Palestine decreed in 1948 that
the inhabitants of Palestine are
the Israelis.
What happenned to the Pales
tinians? According to the original
Israeli version, they did not "real
ly" exist — the cities they left
just happened to be.
In all the countries surrounding
the said land, there are millions
of people who claim they are Pal
estinian, have a Palestinian flag
and a Palestinian identity. They
live in tents. They say they were
expelled and those who did not
leave were massacred.
But the Israelis retort that all
these people are merely the con
fused products of spontaneous
generation.
Wars are fought. The Palestin
ians lose; they still live in tents
and a few of them engage in ter
rorism. But the Israelis do not
need to resume their pre-1948 ter
rorism: They now have propa
ganda, Ml6s, Flss and Special
Services to do the dirty jobs. They
are a respected international en
tity. They do not murder; they
raid.

The implementation of
Zionism was
colonialism —
colonialism that has

Since last December, the Is
raelis have been facing civil
unrest in territories they illegally
occupy. The latter are inhabited
by over a million of those confused
blokes who stubbornly claim that
they are Palestinian.
Over 100 of them, mainly
teenagers, have been shot dead.
Thousands of them have been
savagely beaten up. United Na

battering of the elderly. Israeli
soldiers try to bury four demon
strators alive with a bulldozer, but
the media broadcasts the news
throughout the world: The sol
diers are "reprimanded" and get
four-month jail terms; their com
manding officer is not re
moved.
Israel's hackneyed dialectics
and its grotesque political ges
ticulations cannot change the fact
that the implementation of
Zionism was colonialism —

colonialism that has been (unsuc
cessfully) opposed.
Zionism provoked the migration
of the Palestinian population. The
central problem involves land; it
will only be resolved through land.
The Israelis belong in Israel —
let's not repeat bad history.
Similarly, the Palestinians belong
in Palestine (in the occupied ter
ritories).
The UN ought to guarantee the
existence and the security of both
an Israeli state and a Palestinian
state and to encourage their
cooperation. The inexorable logic
of the sociopolitical destiny of the
Middle East foretells the Pales

As to their outrageous actions
in the occupied territories, one
does not find in their beginning
"the World," but a primitive and
criminal cry that sprang from the
depth of the zoological world and
that now ought to be superseded
by a serene respect for human
life and human dignity.
