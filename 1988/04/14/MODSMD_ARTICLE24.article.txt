## A 						walk on the Wilde side Ellmann's book shows a man, his moment Excerpt 
### Oscar Wilde" by Richard Ellmann

If you enjoy a story full of snaggle-toothed, saber
rattling contradictions, the life of Oscar Wilde —
presented by Richard Ellmann in this fascinating
new biography — should be just your speed. The
particulars of his life go virtually unremarked today,
although, in some circles, he is larger in the grave
than he ever was outside it.
Most people know the man by layers. The out
ermost layer is that of a stunning wit, on the level
of Aristophanes, Petronius, Swift and, in this cen
tury, Dorothy Parker — a man who knew the
funniest and the pithiest thing to say in any situ
ation. He was a kind of 19th-century Johnny Carson,
only far more acerbic and far less conventional.
Next, there is the level of the writer — a writer
of amazing virtuosity and versatility, of poems,
reviews, essays, lectures, fables, short stories, novel
las, sketches and plays. In a period when few writers
made any impact more significant than that of a
chalk mark in a rainstorm, Wilde stood out. He
wrote, at his best, pieces that brought outrage out
of strait-laced Victorian Britain, or when not out
rage, uproarious laughter.
The proof is in the pudding: "The Importance of
Being Earnest" still brings laughs out of audiences
today — indeed, laughs of the volume usually
reserved for dimwits like David Letter man. And his
perfect aphorisms — terse, jangling and undeniably
pointed — never cease to surprise.
Then there is the level few people get to see, or
care to see. And while Richard Ellmann (who is
best known for his landmark biography of James
Joyce) devotes as much attention as he can to every
level of the man, he concentrates most strictly on
this third level, bringing to light the contradictions
Wilde embodied, sometimes helplessly, sometimes
perversely, always (to all who knew him) infuriat
ingly. The biggest question Ellmann sets himself
to answering is: How could such a remarkable man
have had such a remarkable fall?
Wilde, after all, despite having a number of fero
cious enemies in high places, was, at the height of
his career, a true celebrity of colossal dimensions.

"The house was full ... Full, that
is, except for the first two rows,
which remained mysteriously empty
until just before the speaker was to
appear. Then suddenly down the
aisle came 60 Harvard students,
dressed in the high aesthetic line
with breeches, dinner jackets,
Whistler locks of white hair, hats
like Bunthorne's, each bearing, in a
stained-glass attitude, a sunflower.
Their leader lounged, limp and list
less and vacant-eyed, to a seat.
There was great merriment as the

As Ellmann writes, "He declined, in a public and
ceremonious manner, to live within his means, be
have modestly, respect his elders, or recognize such
entities as nature and art in their traditional ap
parel. He won admiration, and denigration."
And he won imprisonment — ironically, at the
peak of his career. Not two months after "Impor
tance" had opened to rave reviews in even journals
that had traditionally reserved their most poisonous
revilements for its author, Wilde's name was being
torn from marquees all over London. He was being
brought up on trial for, as Ellmann puts it, "what
the law picturesquely calls sodomy." Less than five
years later, Wilde died penniless and forgotten in
Paris. "So much glory," Ellmann writes, "has rarely
been followed by so much humiliation."
To go into a full-blown explanation of the reasons
for Wilde's fall would take too much away from
the pleasure of reading the biography itself, which,
in a genre bloated with kiss-and-tells ("The Prize
Pulitzer"), braggadocio sheets ("Trump: The Art of
the Deal"), whiners ("On the Outside Looking In")
and ghostwriters ("The Unforgettable Fire"), is a

stage door opened to admit the
lecturer. But Wilde was able to
mock the mockers. Tipped off in
advance, he had donned conven
tional dinner jacket and trousers,
and hinted at iconoclasm only in
the unusually wide cravat, which
reached nearly to his shoulders on
either side.... The students tried
to recover their advantage by ap
plauding heartily every time he
drank from a glass of water, but it
was small revenge."

masterpiece in its own right. In short, though, Wilde
was a man whose personal creed — that life should
imitate art, that a life lived without beauty, even
panache, was a worthless one — seemed not only
ahead of its time, but ahead, frequently, of its own
author's control.
Wilde had many practical friends who saw ways
of avoiding trial, but since Wilde thought exile a
callow and cowardly option, he refused. While Wilde
was in prison, he grew to hate the lover, Lord
Alfred Douglas, for whom he had sacrificed his
prestige and his freedom. But as soon as Wilde was
free, notwithstanding Douglas' mental instability
and incorrigible self-centeredness (when Wilde was
laid up in bed with a cold, Douglas would taunt
him: "You are not so interesting when you are not
on your pedestal"), he was back on Douglas' trail.
Wilde was aware of exigencies, practicalities and
necessities. He just saw no reason to enslave himself
to them, or, for that matter, even to acknowledge
their significance. "Even a color-sense is more im
portant, in the development of the individual," he
once said, "than a sense of right and wrong."

In a society obsessed with propriety, Wilde's was
hardly the correct attitude to have. Indeed, Wilde
himself was victim of deep-seated insecurities and
superstitions. The fact that many of his denoue
ments rest on sudden reversals of fortune, or on
astonishing revelations, is no accident: he lived in
much the same way, noisily shifting gears in the
middle of a smooth journey, spewing smoke in the
faces of his loved ones.
One of the strengths of Ellmann's book, apart
from its fine prose, is the extent to which it makes
the reader see, for himself, that being a good man
is not necessarily as much a matter of convention
as it is of innovation, and that innovation is not
necessarily as much a function of confidence as it
is of doubt.
Perhaps the book is best read as a parable about
the relationship of the individual to his society.
(Wilde was immensely fond of parables, and he used
them whenever he could to illustrate his points.)
And in a time when Victorianism, in the bedroom
and on the street, is more than ever not only an
object of nostalgia and a fashion statement, but for
many a modus vivendi, the story of Wilde is cor
rective, even refreshing.
It is, moreover, an important story, not only
because Wilde brilliantly flouted convention, but
because in the end convention flouted him right
back. There are some who would champion Wilde's
gayness as the exclusive measure by which he should
be defined — as a sort of pre-liberationist standard
bearer and martyr — but Wilde would surely dis
agree. Not just his gayness, but also his wit, his
success, and his talent brought the wrath of his
society down upon him.
Wilde liked to portray Christ as the ultimate
individualist, but even Christ died because his ac
tions disturbed the society to which he belonged.
The same must be said of Wilde; nothing closes
ranks faster than a threatened community.
For, unfortunately, Wilde deceived himself,
through the legerdemain of his own aesthetics, into
believing that persuasion, if it was beautifully
employed, could dispel the taboos closest to the
hearts of his countrymen. But if morality cannot
be legislated, instinct cannot be manipulated. As
Ellmann points out, Wilde never learned that fact.
Such was his tragedy.

las, sketches and plays. In a period when few writers
made any impact more significant than that of a
chalk mark in a rainstorm, Wilde stood out. He
wrote, at his best, pieces that brought outrage out
of strait-laced Victorian Britain, or when not out
rage, uproarious laughter.
The proof is in the pudding: "The Importance of
Being Earnest" still brings laughs out of audiences
today — indeed, laughs of the volume usually
reserved for dimwits like David Letter man. And his
perfect aphorisms — terse, jangling and undeniably
pointed — never cease to surprise.
Then there is the level few people get to see, or
care to see. And while Richard Ellmann (who is
best known for his landmark biography of James
Joyce) devotes as much attention as he can to every
level of the man, he concentrates most strictly on
this third level, bringing to light the contradictions
Wilde embodied, sometimes helplessly, sometimes
perversely, always (to all who knew him) infuriat
ingly. The biggest question Ellmann sets himself
to answering is: How could such a remarkable man
have had such a remarkable fall?
Wilde, after all, despite having a number of fero
cious enemies in high places, was, at the height of
his career, a true celebrity of colossal dimensions.

which remained mysteriously empty
until just before the speaker was to

dressed in the high aesthetic line
with breeches, dinner jackets,
Whistler locks of white hair, hats
like Bunthorne's, each bearing, in a
stained-glass attitude, a sunflower.

As Ellmann writes, "He declined, in a public and
ceremonious manner, to live within his means, be
have modestly, respect his elders, or recognize such
entities as nature and art in their traditional ap
parel. He won admiration, and denigration."
And he won imprisonment — ironically, at the
peak of his career. Not two months after "Impor
tance" had opened to rave reviews in even journals
that had traditionally reserved their most poisonous
revilements for its author, Wilde's name was being
torn from marquees all over London. He was being
brought up on trial for, as Ellmann puts it, "what
the law picturesquely calls sodomy." Less than five
years later, Wilde died penniless and forgotten in
Paris. "So much glory," Ellmann writes, "has rarely
been followed by so much humiliation."
To go into a full-blown explanation of the reasons
for Wilde's fall would take too much away from
the pleasure of reading the biography itself, which,
in a genre bloated with kiss-and-tells ("The Prize
Pulitzer"), braggadocio sheets ("Trump: The Art of
the Deal"), whiners ("On the Outside Looking In")
and ghostwriters ("The Unforgettable Fire"), is a

stage door opened to admit the
lecturer. But Wilde was able to
mock the mockers. Tipped off in
advance, he had donned conven
tional dinner jacket and trousers,
and hinted at iconoclasm only in
the unusually wide cravat, which
reached nearly to his shoulders on
either side.... The students tried
to recover their advantage by ap
plauding heartily every time he
drank from a glass of water, but it
was small revenge."

masterpiece in its own right. In short, though, Wilde
was a man whose personal creed — that life should
imitate art, that a life lived without beauty, even
panache, was a worthless one — seemed not only
ahead of its time, but ahead, frequently, of its own
author's control.
Wilde had many practical friends who saw ways
of avoiding trial, but since Wilde thought exile a
callow and cowardly option, he refused. While Wilde
was in prison, he grew to hate the lover, Lord
Alfred Douglas, for whom he had sacrificed his
prestige and his freedom. But as soon as Wilde was
free, notwithstanding Douglas' mental instability
and incorrigible self-centeredness (when Wilde was
laid up in bed with a cold, Douglas would taunt
him: "You are not so interesting when you are not
on your pedestal"), he was back on Douglas' trail.
Wilde was aware of exigencies, practicalities and
necessities. He just saw no reason to enslave himself
to them, or, for that matter, even to acknowledge
their significance. "Even a color-sense is more im
portant, in the development of the individual," he
once said, "than a sense of right and wrong."

In a society obsessed with propriety, Wilde's was
hardly the correct attitude to have. Indeed, Wilde
himself was victim of deep-seated insecurities and
superstitions. The fact that many of his denoue
ments rest on sudden reversals of fortune, or on
astonishing revelations, is no accident: he lived in
much the same way, noisily shifting gears in the
middle of a smooth journey, spewing smoke in the
faces of his loved ones.
One of the strengths of Ellmann's book, apart
from its fine prose, is the extent to which it makes
the reader see, for himself, that being a good man
is not necessarily as much a matter of convention
as it is of innovation, and that innovation is not
necessarily as much a function of confidence as it
is of doubt.
Perhaps the book is best read as a parable about
the relationship of the individual to his society.
(Wilde was immensely fond of parables, and he used
them whenever he could to illustrate his points.)
And in a time when Victorianism, in the bedroom
and on the street, is more than ever not only an
object of nostalgia and a fashion statement, but for
many a modus vivendi, the story of Wilde is cor
rective, even refreshing.
It is, moreover, an important story, not only
because Wilde brilliantly flouted convention, but
because in the end convention flouted him right
back. There are some who would champion Wilde's
gayness as the exclusive measure by which he should
be defined — as a sort of pre-liberationist standard
bearer and martyr — but Wilde would surely dis
agree. Not just his gayness, but also his wit, his
success, and his talent brought the wrath of his
society down upon him.
Wilde liked to portray Christ as the ultimate
individualist, but even Christ died because his ac
tions disturbed the society to which he belonged.
The same must be said of Wilde; nothing closes
ranks faster than a threatened community.
For, unfortunately, Wilde deceived himself,
through the legerdemain of his own aesthetics, into
believing that persuasion, if it was beautifully
employed, could dispel the taboos closest to the
hearts of his countrymen. But if morality cannot
be legislated, instinct cannot be manipulated. As
Ellmann points out, Wilde never learned that fact.
Such was his tragedy.

If you enjoy a story full of snaggle-toothed, saber
rattling contradictions, the life of Oscar Wilde —
presented by Richard Ellmann in this fascinating
new biography — should be just your speed. The
particulars of his life go virtually unremarked today,
although, in some circles, he is larger in the grave
than he ever was outside it.
Most people know the man by layers. The out
ermost layer is that of a stunning wit, on the level
of Aristophanes, Petronius, Swift and, in this cen
tury, Dorothy Parker — a man who knew the
funniest and the pithiest thing to say in any situ
ation. He was a kind of 19th-century Johnny Carson,
only far more acerbic and far less conventional.
