## Men's gymnasts pull together for NCAAs Card trained intensely 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
No matter what the diversity of at
titude and approach to their sport
might be during the regular season,
members of a team vying for a na
tional championship tend to come to
gether as the NCAA Championships
approach.

And when the championships are finally at hand,
a team's varied personalities mesh into one.
This, at least, is the ideal that coaches hope their
teams will reach. For Stanford Gymnastics Coach
Sadao Hamada, this hope has been fulfilled. A visitor
to Encina Gym during the past two weeks could
not help but be struck with the fierce drive of the
Stanford gymnasts as they went through their train
ing. The intensity has been almost stifling and the
self-criticism very harsh, and the payoff will come
this weekend when the Cardinal takes the floor
willing to accept only one thing, an NCAA title.
Tonight at Nebraska's Devaney Sports Center,
the NCAA team preliminaries will be held to de
termine the three finalists for tomorrow night's
championship meet.
Two years ago at Devaney, the Cardinal made
the team finals then suffered a letdown, finishing
well behind champion Arizona State and runner-up
Nebraska. The Cardinal did not qualify as a team
last season, when host UCLA won and the Cornhus
kers again settled for second.
This season, however, has seen the best team
and individual performances in the history of Stan
ford gymnastics, and co-captain Mike Matzek said
the team has used the last two weeks of NCAA
preparation well.
"Right now we're putting on the finishing touches,
pretty much building up our confidence ... getting
more mentally prepared," Matzek said during the
squad's last home practice Monday. "These two
weeks have been very intense, very intense."
Stanford is ranked fourth in the nation, No. 1

in the West. Matzek gave the No. 3 Cornhuskers
a slight edge due to home-court advantage in what
will be a tightly contested competition. No. 1 Illinois
is noted for its consistency, which will win out
should the other teams' performances be spectacular
but flawed.
No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 8 UCLA are considered
the only other two teams of the 12-team field with
the talent and experience to advance to tomorrow's
finals.

Hamada said that the team that is toughest men
tally will win. "It's all psychological at this point,"
he said. "Technically we are doing well; physically,
also, the guys are well conditioned and very strong.
Our assignment now is to match that with our
effort to come up with our best possible perform
ance."
