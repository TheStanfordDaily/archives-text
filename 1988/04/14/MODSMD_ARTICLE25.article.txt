## Men's gymnasts pull together for NCAAs Card trained intensely 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
No matter what the diversity of at
titude and approach to their sport
might be during the regular season,
members of a team vying for a na
tional championship tend to come to
gether as the NCAA Championships
approach.

And when the championships are finally at hand,
a team's varied personalities mesh into one.
This, at least, is the ideal that coaches hope their
teams will reach. For Stanford Gymnastics Coach
Sadao Hamada, this hope has been fulfilled. A visitor
to Encina Gym during the past two weeks could
not help but be struck with the fierce drive of the
Stanford gymnasts as they went through their train
ing. The intensity has been almost stifling and the
self-criticism very harsh, and the payoff will come
this weekend when the Cardinal takes the floor
willing to accept only one thing, an NCAA title.
Tonight at Nebraska's Devaney Sports Center,
the NCAA team preliminaries will be held to de
termine the three finalists for tomorrow night's
championship meet.
Two years ago at Devaney, the Cardinal made
the team finals then suffered a letdown, finishing
well behind champion Arizona State and runner-up
Nebraska. The Cardinal did not qualify as a team
last season, when host UCLA won and the Cornhus
kers again settled for second.
This season, however, has seen the best team
and individual performances in the history of Stan
ford gymnastics, and co-captain Mike Matzek said
the team has used the last two weeks of NCAA
preparation well.
"Right now we're putting on the finishing touches,
pretty much building up our confidence ... getting
more mentally prepared," Matzek said during the
squad's last home practice Monday. "These two
weeks have been very intense, very intense."
Stanford is ranked fourth in the nation, No. 1

in the West. Matzek gave the No. 3 Cornhuskers
a slight edge due to home-court advantage in what
will be a tightly contested competition. No. 1 Illinois
is noted for its consistency, which will win out
should the other teams' performances be spectacular
but flawed.
No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 8 UCLA are considered
the only other two teams of the 12-team field with
the talent and experience to advance to tomorrow's
finals.

Hamada said that the team that is toughest men
tally will win. "It's all psychological at this point,"
he said. "Technically we are doing well; physically,
also, the guys are well conditioned and very strong.
Our assignment now is to match that with our
effort to come up with our best possible perform
ance."
Sophomore Charles Loop thinks the depth and

condition of the Cardinal gym
nasts give them an advantage, as
does the experience of the team's
three seniors — Matzek, Randy
Besosa and Chuck Gerardo — all
of whom were vital assets to the
1986 squad.
"We need to take it one day at
a time. I think it's important to
have our best meet of the year
that first day, Thursday," Loop
said. "Then we get in, start over
and I think we're the best condi
tioned team, we've done the most
routines. That will show the sec
ond day."
"Ever since the Pac-lOs (the
conference championships, March
25-26), I've been trying to imagine
myself in workouts competing as
if every routine were in front of

15,000 people," Loop said, adding
that no matter what the excite
ment of NCAA competition, Stan
ford's concentration will be fully
focused until the last routine of
the championship meet. "It
means too much to the seniors;
it means too much to the older
guys who have been there and
don't want to finish third again,
and I think they'll instill that
(commitment) in the [underclas
smen]."
The progress of Stanford and
the lack of progress of Nebraska
over the past three years may give
these two teams the incentive to
get ahead of the pack. In its first
NCAA team appearance in 1985,
the Cardinal finished seventh.
Then, after moving up to third
in 1986, Stanford lost an NCAA
individual champion and two
other gymnasts, but refortified
the troops with the nation's best
recruiting class. Early-season in

juries and the lack of seniors on
last year's team put the progres
sion on hold and led Hamada to
the strategic redshirting of Besosa
and No. 1 recruit Adam For man,
sacrificing the season in prepara
tion for this year.
The Cornhuskers have been
frustrated by three straight years
as the NCAA runner-up. Al
though this kind of frustration
could be endured by most any
other program, the Cornhuskers
are used to winning, as they did
for five straight years, from 1979
to 1983.
Nebraska, though, lost only one
gymnast from last year's squad
and returns both Tom Schlesinger
and Kevin Davis, 1987's top-two
collegiate gymnasts. If the Hus
kers are ever to get out of their
comfortable rut, it will be this
weekend.
The Cardinal's performance
tonight will hinge on its first

event, the pommel horse. Never
a Stanford strong point, a good
performance will mean the Car
dinal can only get better, while a
poor showing will have to be fol
lowed by near perfection.
Either way, Stanford will be
glad to get the pommel horse over
with. From there scores of at least
9.7 will be expected from each of
the seniors on each event, while
sophomore Conrad Voorsanger

and junior Scott Schaffer will be
counted on for excellence on their
respective specialties, the high bar
and vault. Consistency will be
paramount for the underclassmen
and occasional elite scores on one
event may be necessary to cancel
out any disappointing marks on
others.
The anticipation and expecta
tions for this one meet have been
building for two years. If Stanford
wins the title, it will be a remark
able synthesis of athletic prepa
ration and performance. Hamada
believes that only Stanford can
beat itself. Hamada said a flawed
performance will not be excused
by any of its four rivals, nor by
the Cardinal gymnasts-
For Stanford, the patience can
be discarded and the struggle is
behind. If all goes as planned, the
memories and results of both will
bring home Stanford's first NCAA
title of the year.
