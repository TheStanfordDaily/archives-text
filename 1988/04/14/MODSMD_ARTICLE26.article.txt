# Stanford, Cal, 18 holes...
## Big Golf returns 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The fierce ri
valry that exists
between Stan
ford and Cali
fornia in most
sports is not as
evident in golf.

There is no axe trophy ex
changed between the schools,
nor do hooligans from across
the bay paint their evil bear
paws on Stanford buildings
before a golf match. But Stan
ford Coach Wally Goodwin and
his counterpart at Cal, Steve
Desimone, intend to inject
some tradition into the match
starting this year.
The men's golf team today
will play its first dual match
of the year in Orinda, Calif.
Goodwin and Desimone have
decided to resurrect the "old
college duel" format for the
tournament.
Each of the six players plays
his opponent over 18 holes. He
gets one point for winning the
first nine holes, one point for
the second nine, and one for
the overall match, for a total
of three points per pairing.
In addition, the first two
players from Stanford will be
matched with the first two
players from Cal and will play
a best-ball match for three
points. The numbers three,
four, five and six players will
play the same type of match.
Such a tournament brings
back some long-needed tradi
tion to the venerable sport of
college golf. When Tom Watson

played for Stanford in the
19705, he often lamented the
passing of match play in college
golf.
The tournament will be
played at the 6,400-yard
Orinda Country Club, which is
also the site of the Pacific-10
Conference tournament next
month. Although the hilly
course is considered short for
the men's golfers, it has re
cently been extended and sand
traps have been added to make
it more challenging.
"It is really nice for Berkeley
to give us a date and an op
portunity to play the course
that we'll be using for the tour
nament in two weeks," Good
win said.
Goodwin will use the same
six players that played in the
Stanford/U.S. Intercollegiate
last weekend. Sophomores
Brad Joondeph, Brad Ben
brook, Don Christensen, Mark
Funseth, Josh Zander and
junior John Mahon will com
pete head-to-head with the Cal
golfers.
"This is a dual match that
we will fight like mad to win,"
Goodwin said.
He added that because the
Cardinal is playing the course
sight unseen, he will learn a
lot about the team that will
help him make a decision about
who he will send to the con
ference championships.
The team's goal is to finish
fifth at Pac-lOs, and a win
against Cal would certainly
help. "We're a better golf team
and we should win," Goodwin
said.
