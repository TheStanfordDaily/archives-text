# Individual hopes high
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
If the Stanford men's gymnastics team can back
up their words with action, it may need extra bag
gage for the trip home from the NCAA Champion
ships Sunday to carry all the individual medals,
and, of course, the team trophy.
Senior gymnast Mike Matzek might have been a
bit biased when he said the Cardinal "has the best
personnel" in the NCAA going into this weekend's
championships. And all year, Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada has been boasting of the superior difficulty
involved in his gymnasts' routines. For Stanford's
resident acrobats, the competition is a welcome
opportunity to prove themselves.
Should the team fail to win the NCAA title,
however, there are a number of Cardinal individuals
who may find solace in bringing home gold, silver
or bronze from the individual championships Sat
urday night at the Devaney Sports Center in Lin
coln, Neb.
Seniors Randy Besosa, Chuck Gerardo and Mike
Matzek can be expected to perform on a number
of apparati during Saturday night's event finals.
Most of the participants in this all-star meet will
be determined by performances in the team
preliminaries tonight. Others have already qualified
by virtue of superior scores over the course of the
regular schedule.
The senior triumvirate should account for at least
one spot among the top five all-around collegians.
Besosa's 58.05 total in a dual meet on March 5 is
among the nation's finest marks, and is a school
record. Gerardo has been Mr. Consistency this year,
with a top score of 57.5. Matzek's weak link is the
pommel horse, but if he survives that event, he
also figures to fight for an all-around medal.
Stanford has elite performers with a good chance
to take the victory stand on each event. Many are
already ranked either among the top in the West
