# Cornelius misses by one, Card 10th
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
Golf tournament
final rounds are
typically tougher,
and yesterday's at
the Lady Sun Devil
Golf Classic in
Phoenix, Ariz.,

was no exception.
The first two days yielded team
scores as low as 293, but yesterday
Arizona State's 303 was the low
of the day.
The effects on individuals were
similar, as ASU's Pam Wright,
who shot 74, was the low scorer
of the day on the par-72, 6,500-
yard desert course. No one shot
75, and Stanford senior Kay Cor
nelius, Oklahoma State's Eva
Dahloff and Washington's Nancy
Kessler were the only players to
shoot 76.
Although she shot the low
round on Monday (68), Cornelius'
bid to win her second consecutive
tournament fell one stroke short,
as Dahloff began the day a stroke
ahead of her. Dahloff and Wright
finished tied for the lead after the
final 18 holes. The result of their
individual playoff was not avail
able.
Tying Cornelius for third was
U.S. International's Helen Alfred
son at 221. Melissa McNamara of
Tulsa, who led going into yester
day, saw her score swell to 79
and finished in fifth at 222. Wash
ington's Nancy Kessler was an
other stroke back at 223, and New
Mexico's Tara Fleming, New
Mexico State's Jackie Vigil and
ASU's Amy Fruhwirth rounded
out the leader board at 224.
Stanford freshman Jodi Figley
saw her chance at a sixth top-10
finish vanish with a disappointing
79 yesterday.

However, a bright light
emerged from the tournament in
freshman Kristin Ryan. Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin predicted that
Ryan would have a good tourna
ment, and he was right. Ryan shot
a consistent 78-79-79. This is the
second consecutive tournament in
which Ryan has played well. She
finished in sixth at the University
of Hawaii Invitational last month.
Sophomore Stephanie Parel
(85-85-80) and freshman Michele
Lyford (85-85-82) both improved
in the final round, but the team's
final-round 314 was not enough
to make any change in the team's
standing. The Cardinal finished
10th of 14 teams. However,
among the nine teams which
finished ahead of the women,
seven are ranked in the top 10.
ASU, which began the day
seven shots behind Tulsa, fired
the low team total of the day (303)
and beat Tulsa by the same seven
stroke margin. The Golden Hur
ricane finished in second at 907.
Oklahoma State was another
three strokes back, with Arizona
(918) edging New Mexico by one
stroke for fourth.
UCLA shot an impressive final
round 309 to tie USIU for sixth
at 924, while New Mexico finished
eighth at 926. San Diego State
edged out Stanford by four
strokes, finishing at 930. The Az
tecs have bothered Stanford all
year, beating them three times.
The only time the Cardinal has
emerged victorious was at the
Stanford Intercollegiate last fall.
Of the top eight finishers, only
USIU is not a top-10 team.
Baldwin is not disappointed
with his team's finish, however.
All three of the team's rounds are
among its best 14 this year, and
thus will raise its national
ranking.
