SAN FRANCISCO — The boxscore of yes
terday afternoon's San Francisco Giants-
Cincinnati Reds game at Candlestick Park
exhibits the participation of some 40-odd
players, but as the 11-inning, three-and-a
half-hour game wore on, it became apparent
that everyone was waiting for one player to
show up.

But which player would that be? Well, by
baseball logic, it had to be someone who could
hit a dinger.
The Reds, you see, were scoring their runs
on walks, sacrifice flies and Giants' miscues.
(A short digression: one of the more pleasing
aspects of this season so far is that Manager
Roger Craig's ballyhooed sound-skilled Giants
just keep messing up.)
Meanwhile, the Giants poked stringß of
singles to tally their runs, and nobody on
either team was hitting the ball hard. sk) it

was pretty much a good bet that a crunching
home run would win this ball game. That's
baseball logic.
Before logic leveled things out, however,
the fans were treated to some haywire plays.
People will tell you that no matter how many
baseball games you attend, you will always
see at least one occurence you've never wit
nessed before. Yesterday there were two.
The first involved Tommy Helms' shin. The
Giants led 3-2, but the Reds had Kalvoski
Daniels on second and Eric Davis on first.
Batter Paul O'Neill chased Daniels home with
a single to center, and Davis tped to scoot to
third on the play. Here's where the fun began.
Giants centerfielder Brett Butler's throw
got by third baseman Kevin Mitchell and the
ball was headed toward the dugout, where
Giants pitcher Mike LaCoss should have been
backing up the play, but was nowhere to be
found.
And so for a millisecond, it looked like Davis
would score the go-ahead run and O'Neill
might meander his way to third on the over
throw. But third base coach Tommy Helms'
shin jumped out and knocked the ball down.
Never seen nuthin' like it...
Until the 11th inning, that is. With two
outs and Bo Diaz on first base for the Reds,
Barry Larkin was at the plate. Diaz broke for
second and Larkin swung on and missed a
third strike.

Strike three and the third out, it seemed.
The Giants jogged off the field, but Helms
got back into the act. Helms waved at Diaz
to keep rounding the bases, and at Larkin to
run to first because he thought the pitch had
been in the dirt, and Larkin hadn't been
tagged out. Got all that?
Anyway, Mitchell finally got a clue and
picked up the discarded ball. Diaz stopped at
third and Larkin slowed down between first
and second. Confusion reigned.
But the Reds' hopes were dashed after a
brief argument with the home-plate umpire.
He said that Larkin was out, period. Still, the
near mammoth miscue by the Giants was
worth a chuckle. Humm Baby.
The bottom of the 11th inning loomed, and
everyone was still waiting for a homer. And
they waited two more outs. Then the Natural
stepped up to the plate.
Will Clark had been nearly invisible most
of the day. He had managed a pool-cue single,
and halted a Reds rally with a neighborhood
job stretch at first.
Otherwise, the super-smooth Clark seemed
to be sleep walking. He didn't really ever
wake up, either. He just pummelled a Pat
Perry curveball 380 feet over the right
centerfield fence to end the game. He admired
it for a moment, and then sleep-walked around
the diamond.
Giants 5, Reds 4.
