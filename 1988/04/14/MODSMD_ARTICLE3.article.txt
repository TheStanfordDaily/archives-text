# Dean Wasow upbraids new 'anti-intellectual' fitness class
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
A popular four-unit fitness class
taught this quarter was portrayed
in advertising fliers as a lot of
fun and games, but Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow isn't amused.
Wasow is disturbed by the anti
intellectual tone of the organiza
tion and promotion of "Optimal
Health and Fitness" and by what
he calls the "unethical behavior"
of its instructor, Jack Martin.
Martin, Wasow said yesterday,
should be barred from teaching
at Stanford.
Martin countered that the class
is not anti-intellectual and at

tacked Wasow's reaction as "un
professional." Martin said that
Wasow's criticisms are based
solely on the fliers circulated, and
that Wasow made no effort to
learn more about the course or
contact Martin personally.
Medical School officials, under
whose auspices the class is con
ducted, have reviewed the class
and say that it does involve "some
rigor."
Wasow said he originally be
came concerned about the class
after reading fliers used to adver
tise it on campus. The fliers
claimed that the class would not
focus on tests, problem sets or
papers because "we don't think
they are healthy for you."

Wasow, who
has been out
spoken in his
commitment to
improving the
quality and rigor
of Stanford's un
dergraduate edu
cation since he
was named dean
of undergraduate

studies last summer, was both
ered by the anti-intellectual
characterization of the class. He
said he would much rather see
the course offered as a one- or
two-unit, pass/no credit class in
the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recrea
tion.

Wasow said he is not alone in
being concerned about the course.
Criticisms from other faculty and
administrators originally prompt
ed his interest in the course.
Dr. Robert Cutler, associate
dean of the Medical School, re
viewed the course aftor Wasow
expressed his concerns. However,
since the course is under Medical
School control, Wasow has no
power over its accreditation or in
structor.
Cutler expressed the hope that
Martin would not be censured by
the Medical School, and said he
knew of no such plans.
Martin pointed out that the
course meets the University's
standards for credit in "every

way." The class includes three lec
tures a week, weekly tests and
required attendance at an exercise
session.
After looking over the syllabus
for the course, Wasow said he be
came "quite upset." Both the $10
payment required by Martin, and
the prerequisite that students
should not take more than 13
other units during spring quarter
were inappropriate, Wasow said.
Martin, who teaches the course
strictly on a volunteer basis, is
not a University employee. Wasow
said the $10 charged students by
Martin was intended to pay him
for his time, as the Medical School
does not provide funding for the
course.

Also assuming the student's
money was kept by Martin, Cutler
agreed that the monetary charge
by Martin was highly inappropri
ate. He said that he hoped to get
the money back to students soon.
Martin said, however, that the
$10 was meant only to defray the
costs of the course, and in no way
acts as a personal salary. He of
fered to show receipts for the
money received from students.
The 17-unit limit placed on stu
dents in the class is unprece
dented and represents an unnec
essary intrusion on students' lives
outside of the class, Wasow said.
The large turnout for the
course — over 600 students —
was disheartening, Wasow said.
