Some people are never satisfied.
The Stanford cycling team, for in
stance, emerged dissatisfied from
last weekend's racing at UC-
Davis, despite many top placings
in both Saturday's criteriums and
Sunday's circuit races.
The criterium course Saturday,
a tight loop, lent itself particularly
well to the sprinting abilities of
Stanford's team members. In the
men's A race, freshman Coulter
Richardson broke off the front
with three other riders and then
hammered to a hotly contested
second place. Sophomore John
Coyle scored in the field sprint,
placing 10th overall.
The women's race featured a
tight battle for sprinting su
premacy between Cardinal

alumnus Pam Stevenson and a
Davis rider, ending with Steven
son in second place. Graduate stu
dent Kaye Wagner, post-doctoral
student Ami Laws, and freshman
Libby Feil finished fourth, eighth
and ninth.
Two Stanford cyclists placed
well in the B race. Junior Hank
Dart snared second place, "and
senior Bob Borchers showed a
return to form with a fourth-place
finish. Sophomore James Couture
and grad student Brian Bray did
well, placing third and sixth
respectively.
Sunday's flat road race also
seemed made to order for the
Stanford team, which has a
preponderance of sprinters. In the
A race, the Cardinal's Coyle
nipped teammate Richardson in

the final sprint for a two-three
Stanford finish. Junior Steve Mil
ler also sped to eighth place.
The women's placings were
identical to those of the A's. Ste
venson again won second, while
this time Wagner bolted to third
place, thus breaking her long
string of fourth-place finishes.
Feil rounded out the Stanford
results with an eighth-place ef
fort.
The B race was exciting for the
Cardinal. Dart won the race hand
ily and Borchers pulled off sixth
place. But the team was dec
imated in the last 200 meters of
the race when a heartbreaking
crash eliminated the other three
Stanford B riders, all of whom
were in position for top-10
placings.

Stanford's only scorer in the C
race was freshman Greg Na
kamoto, who completed the race
with a strong sixth-place finish.
Equestrian
Several members of the Stan
ford equestrian team will be
riding in the team's annual horse
show this Sunday at Stanford.
The show will have English and
Western classes in both intercol
legiate and open divisions.
Although many team members
will be riding, only six of these
riders' points will contribute to
the team's point total. Several of
these equestrians will be riding
horses borrowed from private
owners.
