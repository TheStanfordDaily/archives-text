# It's no joke — Mussina is ready to play

Get this. ..
After a high-school career in which
he went 24-4 with a 0.87 ERA and
was named Pennsylvania Baseball
Player of the Year two years running,
Stanford's Mike Mussina has posted
a 7-1 record this season with five com
plete games and a two-hit shutout to
his credit. He is also 4-0 in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division,
thought by many to be the nation's
most formidable league.
Okay, so here's the joke. Mussina
claims that he turned down a six-figure
contract to turn pro because.. .are you
ready? He says he wasn't mature
enough.
Somebody had better tell Mike to
cut the gag. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound
freshman from Mountoursville, Penn.,
has to be one of the most precocious
hurlers ever to lay down his knapsack
on the Farm.
"He's undefeated in the best con
ference in the country," Stanford
Asst. Coach Tom Dunton said. "And
I think it's tougher to adjust from
high school to the Pac-10 than it is
from the Pac-10 to pro ball."
There you have it: he's a regular
world-beater. But if you question him
about it, he will stick to his story with

a deep-eyed, earnest, mature response:
Pro ball may have been ready for him,
but he wasn't ready for pro ball.
"There *8 no doubt I made the right
choice — to come to school as opposed
to signing a professional contract,"
Mussina said. "At the time, I didn't
feel I was ready to jump, right into
pro ball. Coming out of high school,
it just didn't seem like the right thing
at the right time."
Well, let's give Mussina the benefit
of the doubt, for Stanford has all the
evidence of being "the right thing."
He likes the wide-open campus and
the moderate number of students,
where "you're a person and not a num
ber." But above all, Mussina likes the
two-fold education athletes get at
Stanford — on the field, and of equal
importance, in the classroom.
"Education's important," he said.
"If you go straight to professional ball,
and for some reason you can't continue
due to iryury or whatever, without an
education you're kind of stuck with
nothing to do. I didn't want to be
stuck in that situation."
So, while most Stanford students
complain about paying $15,000 for a
year of education at Stanford, Mussina
paid $300,000 — the amount of the
signing bonus he turned down from
the Baltimore Orioles organization —
to get his partial scholarship to Stan

ford.
Of course, in return for that large
payment comes the tutelage he needs
to fine-tune his pitching. For starters,
Mussina feels he has to develop his
other pitches besides his out-pitch, the
fastball.
"I throw so many fastballs in a
game," he said, "I could probably
throw a hundred curves and come
right back with a fastball and ...
throw it right over the plate, or pretty
close. I have to be able to throw a
curve over the plate, or when I need
to, a straight change over the plate —
something else besides a fastball."
"He needs a better command of all
his pitches, like any young pitcher,"
Dunton said. "He's got a great arsenal
of pitches, but he has to be more con
sistent with [location]. He's got to
throw it over the pitcher's part of the
plate."
Problems with location help explain
the team-leading 13 home runs Mus
sina has given up. He can no longer
simply blow his fastball past hitters
as he did in high school.
Nevertheless, the home-run totals
don't concern Dunton, especially since
only four of the 13 have come with
men on base.
"This is a fastball hitter's league,"
Dunton said. "The reason they're here
is they know how to hit a fastball.

Jack McDowell gave up a lot of home
runs. They'll cut down as he (Mussina)
goes along."
In fact, Dunton paid Mussina the
highest of compliments when he said
that Mussina compares favorably with
McDowell, the former Stanford All-
American and current Chicago White
Sox phenom.
So, Mussina is learning his lessons
well. He has also been teaching a few
lessons himself — to opposing batters.
Mussina has won seven straight games
since suffering a narrow, opening-day
3-2 loss to Santa Clara, and boasts a
three-to-one strikeouts-to-walks ratio.
Obviously, the fact that he's still
learning about pitching hasn't slowed
him down. But there is one aspect of
his game that needs no instruction —
the mental side (i.e. maturity).
"That's the first thing that most
people notice," Dunton said. "He's got
great mound presence and tremendous
poise. He doesn't show his emotions
on his sleeves like some young
pitchers. That's not something you can
teach. And the reason probably is
(that) he's confident about his abili
ties."
"I try to stay composed on the
mound," Mussina said. "I try not to
let things bother me... you just have
