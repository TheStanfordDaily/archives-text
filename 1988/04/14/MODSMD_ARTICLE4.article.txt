# Animal rights activity deserves a second look

Darkly clad bodies entered scientific
laboratories at the Univeristy of Oregon
early one Sunday morning. They bashed
in a $10,000 microscope with a $5 crow
bar, threw an EKG machine on the floor
and poured paint down the tube of an
X-ray machine.
As a final touch, the vandals signed
the walls "ALF" with spray paint and
left with over 125 cats, hamsters, rabbits
and rats. They left behind $34,900 in
damage to the labs of Oregon Psychology
Profs. Barbara Gordon-Lickey and Rich
ard Marrocco.
Oregon was No. 26 on the "hit list"
of the Animal Liberation Front, the chief
animal rights terrorist organization in
the United States, according to Greg
Stickrod, Oregon animal services labo
ratory director.
Since the October 1986 Oregon break
in, ALF has violently attacked about 10
research laboratories in the country and
that number "appears to be growing at
an exponential rate," Stickrod said.
Although no Stanford research facility
has suffered a mtyor terrorist attack,
California is a primary target of ALF.
Last April at UC-Davis, ALF members
burned a veterinary diagnostic plant,
causing $3.5 million in damage. The UC-
Davis incident is, so far, the biggest
terrorist attack by an animal rights
group in this country, according to Stick
rod.
The most prominent political animal

rights organization in the U.S. is People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
Gordon-Lickey said. Although PETA
claims to disapprove of the methods of
ALF, they are suspected of using some
of their estimated $20 million budget to
fund ALF activities, according to Stick
rod.
The main animal rights group in
fluencing Stanford research is the Palo
Alto Humane Society, which operates
through legal means to challenge Stan
ford on health and safety as well as
animal issues.
The most extreme supporters of
animal research are not university offi
cials and scientists, but groups of
patients, such as the Incurably 111 for
Environmental Research, who would
like researchers to have license to ex
periment in any fashion.
Universities, which recognize the need
for certain restrictions on research to
protect the animals, represent a more
middle ground, Hamm said.
The Oregon break-in led to what is
believed to be the first criminal prose
cution in this country of a participant
in a raid on an animal research labora
tory, according to The Eugene Register
Guard.
Roger Troen, 57, a former elementary
school teacher, was found guilty Jan.
21 on charges of first-degree theft, con
spiracy to commit second-degree bur
glary and second-degree burglary,
according to The Register Guard.
