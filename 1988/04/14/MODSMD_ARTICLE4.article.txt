# Animal rights activity deserves a second look

Darkly clad bodies entered scientific
laboratories at the Univeristy of Oregon
early one Sunday morning. They bashed
in a $10,000 microscope with a $5 crow
bar, threw an EKG machine on the floor
and poured paint down the tube of an
X-ray machine.
As a final touch, the vandals signed
the walls "ALF" with spray paint and
left with over 125 cats, hamsters, rabbits
and rats. They left behind $34,900 in
damage to the labs of Oregon Psychology
Profs. Barbara Gordon-Lickey and Rich
ard Marrocco.
Oregon was No. 26 on the "hit list"
of the Animal Liberation Front, the chief
animal rights terrorist organization in
the United States, according to Greg
Stickrod, Oregon animal services labo
ratory director.
Since the October 1986 Oregon break
in, ALF has violently attacked about 10
research laboratories in the country and
that number "appears to be growing at
an exponential rate," Stickrod said.
Although no Stanford research facility
has suffered a mtyor terrorist attack,
California is a primary target of ALF.
Last April at UC-Davis, ALF members
burned a veterinary diagnostic plant,
causing $3.5 million in damage. The UC-
Davis incident is, so far, the biggest
terrorist attack by an animal rights
group in this country, according to Stick
rod.
The most prominent political animal

rights organization in the U.S. is People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
Gordon-Lickey said. Although PETA
claims to disapprove of the methods of
ALF, they are suspected of using some
of their estimated $20 million budget to
fund ALF activities, according to Stick
rod.
The main animal rights group in
fluencing Stanford research is the Palo
Alto Humane Society, which operates
through legal means to challenge Stan
ford on health and safety as well as
animal issues.
The most extreme supporters of
animal research are not university offi
cials and scientists, but groups of
patients, such as the Incurably 111 for
Environmental Research, who would
like researchers to have license to ex
periment in any fashion.
Universities, which recognize the need
for certain restrictions on research to
protect the animals, represent a more
middle ground, Hamm said.
The Oregon break-in led to what is
believed to be the first criminal prose
cution in this country of a participant
in a raid on an animal research labora
tory, according to The Eugene Register
Guard.
Roger Troen, 57, a former elementary
school teacher, was found guilty Jan.
21 on charges of first-degree theft, con
spiracy to commit second-degree bur
glary and second-degree burglary,
according to The Register Guard.
"The animal rights movement
means that animals have the
same rights as people," Hamm
said. "A rat is the same as a boy
and should be treated the same
as a boy."

Although much of animal re
search is not directed toward dis
covering the cure to a specific dis
ease, without the knowledge ob
tained through basic research,
many deadly and debilitating dis
eases from polio to heart disease
could not be prevented or treated
today.
Treatment of high blood pres
sure with drugs such as inderal
would be impossible without basic
research using frogs and mam
mals dating back to the 19305.
"The modern treatment of
heart disease involving pace
makers and bypass surgeries
depends upon many decades of
research on heart physiology and
anatomy," Gordon-Lickey and
Marrocco said in a March 25 ed
itorial in The Register Guard.
They stress that research into
the function and structure of an
intact organ requires experiment
ing with live animals.

"Similarly, curing AIDS is
going to require that non-human
primates be deliberately infec
ted," according to the editorial.
Today, doctors have drugs to
treat Parkinson's disease, a dis
ease that degenerates a region of
the brain that controls certain
motor skills. Victims of this dis
ease are usually over 50 and suffer
from tremors, rigidity and inabil
ity to initiate movement, accord
ing to Gordon-Lickey.
The cause of Parkinson's dis
ease — a decrease in the commu
nication of nerve cells which
release a chemical called dop
amine — had to be learned before
a medication to treat it could be
found.
However, before scientists
could even ask the question,
"What causes Parkinson's dis
ease?" they had to acquire a basic
understanding of the way nerve
cells communicate across gaps or
synapses. It is this basic under
standing that much of animal re
search is meant to provide.
Every surgical procedure must
be perfected on animals before it
can be practiced on humans, ac
cording to Gordon-Lickey. Human
heart transplants would not be
possible without experiments
using dogs.
Any drugs now used to cure
diseases had to have been tested
for both safety and efficacy on
animals before they could be used
on humans, Gordon-Lickey said.
The release of the animals from
the Oregon labs delayed several
important research projects and
put an end to others. One of the
stolen rabbits, for example, was
the only one in existence whose
blood contained an antibody used
by researchers all over the world
to diagnose a malady called
"floppy baby syndrome," accord

ing to Gordon-Lickey.
Another stolen rabbit contained
an insect-killing antibody that sci
entists were hoping might be able
to replace pesticides.
A Stanford University medical
professor studying Alzheimer's
disease stated, in a letter read by
the Judge at the Oregon sentenc
ing, that the raids on labs in Cal
ifornia are having a "terrifying
impact" on his field, including
scaring the brightest students
from going into research.
There have been three fire

bombings in California. Hamm es
timates the animal rights move
ment here is five years behind
England, where there have been
40 firebombings.
"I think that's really sad,"
Hamm said. "It's hard for me to
believe that someone who really
loves animals would do things
that are that violent."
Animal rights activists have
many legal alternatives to vio
lence, including peaceful demon
stration, petitioning university of
ficials and lawmakers, filing re

quests with the state attorney
general and filing lawsuits.
The PAHS protested Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion's original decision exempting
Stanford from writing an environ
mental impact report for two new
planned buildings in which
animals will be used. As a result
of the protest, Stanford must now
write reports for both buildings,
which delayed construction of the
animal facility by a year and cost
Stanford $1 million, Hamm said.
"That's fine, because that's at
least legal," he said. "In fact, it's
kind of impressive what a good
job they're doing."
There is no evidence that the
animals kidnapped from Oregon
are better off today than they
were in the lab. In fact, humane
societies and animal shelters must
put many animals to death be
cause they cannot find homes for
them, Gordon-Lickey said.
Every year in California one
million pound dogs are killed "for
no good reason," according to
Hamm. Stanford uses fewer than
200 dogs a year for research.
These dogs die painlessly because
of the expertise of Stanford re
searchers, yet local pounds and
shelters will not let their dogs be
used for research. Hamm calls
this a "gross inconsistency" in
the animal rights cause.
This country's standards for
the care and use of laboratory
animals have risen significantly
in the last 10 years. Animal living
quarters have been upgraded and
there has been greater effort to
determine appropriate anesthesia
levels for animals in experiments.
Within the last three years,
Stanford has built one state-of
the-art animal care facility and a
second is planned.
Gordon-Lickey said she expects

animal care standards to continue
to improve and welcomes such im
provement.
Unfortunately, the primary
goal of animal rights activists is
not to improve laboratory animal
care, but to stop all animal re
search, a goal toward which they
have made almost no progress,
Gordon-Lickey said.
Guidelines for the care and use
of laboratory animals are estab
lished by the National Institutes
of Health. The NIH guidelines
have changed over the past 15
years and are expected to continue
to change, according to Gordon-
Lickey and Marrocco.
Next week is world Animal
Rights Week, a once a year period
during which animal rights ac
tivists attempt to get publicity for
their cause. The week preceding
Animal Rights Week is usually
wrought with terrorist activity. It
was this week a year ago that the
UC-Davis building was burned.
"So, during this week, we are ex
pecting a break-in somewhere,"
Hamm said.
There is a bill pending in
Congress that would give people
the right to sue universities on
behalf of animals. If this bill were
to pass, Hamm said, Stanford and
other universities would be con
tinually tied up in law suits.
In the future it may be possible
to use cell cultures or computer
simulations in place of animals
for certain kinds of research
which now require animal ex
perimentation. For most prob
lems, however, switching to these
alternative methods does not
seem possible in the foreseeable
future, Gordon-Lickey said.

Although much of animal re
search is not directed toward dis
covering the cure to a specific dis
ease, without the knowledge ob
tained through basic research,
many deadly and debilitating dis
eases from polio to heart disease
could not be prevented or treated
today.
Treatment of high blood pres
sure with drugs such as inderal
would be impossible without basic
research using frogs and mam

"The modern treatment of
heart disease involving pace
makers and bypass surgeries
depends upon many decades of
research on heart physiology and
anatomy," Gordon-Lickey and
Marrocco said in a March 25 ed
itorial in The Register Guard.
They stress that research into
the function and structure of an
intact organ requires experiment
ing with live animals.

"Similarly, curing AIDS is

Today, doctors have drugs to
treat Parkinson's disease, a dis
ease that degenerates a region of
the brain that controls certain
motor skills. Victims of this dis
ease are usually over 50 and suffer
from tremors, rigidity and inabil
ity to initiate movement, accord
ing to Gordon-Lickey.
The cause of Parkinson's dis
ease — a decrease in the commu
nication of nerve cells which
release a chemical called dop
amine — had to be learned before
a medication to treat it could be
found.
However, before scientists
could even ask the question,
"What causes Parkinson's dis
ease?" they had to acquire a basic
understanding of the way nerve
cells communicate across gaps or
synapses. It is this basic under
standing that much of animal re
search is meant to provide.
Every surgical procedure must
be perfected on animals before it
can be practiced on humans, ac
cording to Gordon-Lickey. Human
heart transplants would not be
possible without experiments
using dogs.
Any drugs now used to cure
diseases had to have been tested
for both safety and efficacy on
animals before they could be used
on humans, Gordon-Lickey said.
The release of the animals from
the Oregon labs delayed several
important research projects and
put an end to others. One of the
stolen rabbits, for example, was
the only one in existence whose
blood contained an antibody used
by researchers all over the world
to diagnose a malady called
"floppy baby syndrome," accord

ing to Gordon-Lickey.
Another stolen rabbit contained
an insect-killing antibody that sci
entists were hoping might be able
to replace pesticides.
A Stanford University medical
professor studying Alzheimer's
disease stated, in a letter read by
the Judge at the Oregon sentenc
ing, that the raids on labs in Cal
ifornia are having a "terrifying
impact" on his field, including
scaring the brightest students
from going into research.
There have been three fire

bombings in California. Hamm es
timates the animal rights move
ment here is five years behind
England, where there have been
40 firebombings.
"I think that's really sad,"
Hamm said. "It's hard for me to
believe that someone who really
loves animals would do things
that are that violent."
Animal rights activists have
many legal alternatives to vio
lence, including peaceful demon
stration, petitioning university of
ficials and lawmakers, filing re

quests with the state attorney
general and filing lawsuits.
The PAHS protested Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion's original decision exempting
Stanford from writing an environ
mental impact report for two new
planned buildings in which
animals will be used. As a result
of the protest, Stanford must now
write reports for both buildings,
which delayed construction of the
animal facility by a year and cost
Stanford $1 million, Hamm said.
"That's fine, because that's at
least legal," he said. "In fact, it's
kind of impressive what a good
job they're doing."
There is no evidence that the
animals kidnapped from Oregon
are better off today than they
were in the lab. In fact, humane
societies and animal shelters must
put many animals to death be
cause they cannot find homes for
them, Gordon-Lickey said.
Every year in California one
million pound dogs are killed "for
no good reason," according to
Hamm. Stanford uses fewer than
200 dogs a year for research.
These dogs die painlessly because
of the expertise of Stanford re
searchers, yet local pounds and
shelters will not let their dogs be
used for research. Hamm calls
this a "gross inconsistency" in
the animal rights cause.
This country's standards for
the care and use of laboratory
animals have risen significantly
in the last 10 years. Animal living
quarters have been upgraded and
there has been greater effort to
determine appropriate anesthesia
levels for animals in experiments.
Within the last three years,
Stanford has built one state-of
the-art animal care facility and a
second is planned.
Gordon-Lickey said she expects

animal care standards to continue
to improve and welcomes such im
provement.
Unfortunately, the primary
goal of animal rights activists is
not to improve laboratory animal
care, but to stop all animal re
search, a goal toward which they
have made almost no progress,
Gordon-Lickey said.
Guidelines for the care and use
of laboratory animals are estab
lished by the National Institutes
of Health. The NIH guidelines
have changed over the past 15
years and are expected to continue
to change, according to Gordon-
Lickey and Marrocco.
Next week is world Animal
Rights Week, a once a year period
during which animal rights ac
tivists attempt to get publicity for
their cause. The week preceding
Animal Rights Week is usually
wrought with terrorist activity. It
was this week a year ago that the
UC-Davis building was burned.
"So, during this week, we are ex
pecting a break-in somewhere,"
Hamm said.
There is a bill pending in
Congress that would give people
the right to sue universities on
behalf of animals. If this bill were
to pass, Hamm said, Stanford and
other universities would be con
tinually tied up in law suits.
In the future it may be possible
to use cell cultures or computer
simulations in place of animals
for certain kinds of research
which now require animal ex
perimentation. For most prob
lems, however, switching to these
alternative methods does not
seem possible in the foreseeable
future, Gordon-Lickey said.

A researcher at the Laboratory of Animal Medicine has a ball with
one of her patients.
Darkly clad bodies entered scientific
laboratories at the Univeristy of Oregon
early one Sunday morning. They bashed
in a $10,000 microscope with a $5 crow
bar, threw an EKG machine on the floor
and poured paint down the tube of an
X-ray machine.
As a final touch, the vandals signed
the walls "ALF" with spray paint and
left with over 125 cats, hamsters, rabbits
and rats. They left behind $34,900 in
damage to the labs of Oregon Psychology
Profs. Barbara Gordon-Lickey and Rich
ard Marrocco.
Oregon was No. 26 on the "hit list"
of the Animal Liberation Front, the chief
animal rights terrorist organization in
the United States, according to Greg
Stickrod, Oregon animal services labo
ratory director.
Since the October 1986 Oregon break
in, ALF has violently attacked about 10
research laboratories in the country and
that number "appears to be growing at
an exponential rate," Stickrod said.
Although no Stanford research facility
has suffered a mtyor terrorist attack,
California is a primary target of ALF.
Last April at UC-Davis, ALF members
burned a veterinary diagnostic plant,
causing $3.5 million in damage. The UC-
Davis incident is, so far, the biggest
terrorist attack by an animal rights
group in this country, according to Stick
rod.
The most prominent political animal

rights organization in the U.S. is People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
Gordon-Lickey said. Although PETA
claims to disapprove of the methods of
ALF, they are suspected of using some
of their estimated $20 million budget to
fund ALF activities, according to Stick
rod.
The main animal rights group in
fluencing Stanford research is the Palo
Alto Humane Society, which operates
through legal means to challenge Stan
ford on health and safety as well as
animal issues.
The most extreme supporters of
animal research are not university offi
cials and scientists, but groups of
patients, such as the Incurably 111 for
Environmental Research, who would
like researchers to have license to ex
periment in any fashion.
Universities, which recognize the need
for certain restrictions on research to
protect the animals, represent a more
middle ground, Hamm said.
The Oregon break-in led to what is
believed to be the first criminal prose
cution in this country of a participant
in a raid on an animal research labora
tory, according to The Eugene Register
Guard.
Roger Troen, 57, a former elementary
school teacher, was found guilty Jan.
21 on charges of first-degree theft, con
spiracy to commit second-degree bur
glary and second-degree burglary,
according to The Register Guard.

bombings in California. Hamm es
timates the animal rights move
ment here is five years behind
England, where there have been
40 firebombings.
"I think that's really sad,"
Hamm said. "It's hard for me to
believe that someone who really
loves animals would do things
that are that violent."
Animal rights activists have
many legal alternatives to vio
lence, including peaceful demon
stration, petitioning university of
ficials and lawmakers, filing re

quests with the state attorney
general and filing lawsuits.
The PAHS protested Santa
Clara County Planning Commis
sion's original decision exempting
Stanford from writing an environ
mental impact report for two new
planned buildings in which
animals will be used. As a result
of the protest, Stanford must now
write reports for both buildings,
which delayed construction of the
animal facility by a year and cost
Stanford $1 million, Hamm said.
"That's fine, because that's at
least legal," he said. "In fact, it's
kind of impressive what a good
job they're doing."
There is no evidence that the
animals kidnapped from Oregon
are better off today than they
were in the lab. In fact, humane
societies and animal shelters must
put many animals to death be
cause they cannot find homes for
them, Gordon-Lickey said.
Every year in California one
million pound dogs are killed "for
no good reason," according to
Hamm. Stanford uses fewer than
200 dogs a year for research.
These dogs die painlessly because
of the expertise of Stanford re
searchers, yet local pounds and
shelters will not let their dogs be
used for research. Hamm calls
this a "gross inconsistency" in
the animal rights cause.
This country's standards for
the care and use of laboratory
animals have risen significantly
in the last 10 years. Animal living
quarters have been upgraded and
there has been greater effort to
determine appropriate anesthesia
levels for animals in experiments.
Within the last three years,
Stanford has built one state-of
the-art animal care facility and a
second is planned.
Gordon-Lickey said she expects

animal care standards to continue
to improve and welcomes such im
provement.
Unfortunately, the primary
goal of animal rights activists is
not to improve laboratory animal
care, but to stop all animal re
search, a goal toward which they
have made almost no progress,
Gordon-Lickey said.
Guidelines for the care and use
of laboratory animals are estab
lished by the National Institutes
of Health. The NIH guidelines
have changed over the past 15
years and are expected to continue
to change, according to Gordon-
Lickey and Marrocco.
Next week is world Animal
Rights Week, a once a year period
during which animal rights ac
tivists attempt to get publicity for
their cause. The week preceding
Animal Rights Week is usually
wrought with terrorist activity. It
was this week a year ago that the
UC-Davis building was burned.
"So, during this week, we are ex
pecting a break-in somewhere,"
Hamm said.
There is a bill pending in
Congress that would give people
the right to sue universities on
behalf of animals. If this bill were
to pass, Hamm said, Stanford and
other universities would be con
tinually tied up in law suits.
In the future it may be possible
to use cell cultures or computer
simulations in place of animals
for certain kinds of research
which now require animal ex
perimentation. For most prob
lems, however, switching to these
alternative methods does not
seem possible in the foreseeable
future, Gordon-Lickey said.

Darkly clad bodies entered scientific
laboratories at the Univeristy of Oregon
early one Sunday morning. They bashed
in a $10,000 microscope with a $5 crow
bar, threw an EKG machine on the floor
and poured paint down the tube of an
X-ray machine.
As a final touch, the vandals signed
the walls "ALF" with spray paint and
left with over 125 cats, hamsters, rabbits
and rats. They left behind $34,900 in
damage to the labs of Oregon Psychology
Profs. Barbara Gordon-Lickey and Rich
ard Marrocco.
Oregon was No. 26 on the "hit list"
of the Animal Liberation Front, the chief
animal rights terrorist organization in
the United States, according to Greg
Stickrod, Oregon animal services labo
ratory director.
Since the October 1986 Oregon break
in, ALF has violently attacked about 10
research laboratories in the country and
that number "appears to be growing at
an exponential rate," Stickrod said.
Although no Stanford research facility
has suffered a mtyor terrorist attack,
California is a primary target of ALF.
Last April at UC-Davis, ALF members
burned a veterinary diagnostic plant,
causing $3.5 million in damage. The UC-
Davis incident is, so far, the biggest
terrorist attack by an animal rights
group in this country, according to Stick
rod.
The most prominent political animal

rights organization in the U.S. is People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
Gordon-Lickey said. Although PETA
claims to disapprove of the methods of
ALF, they are suspected of using some
of their estimated $20 million budget to
fund ALF activities, according to Stick
rod.
The main animal rights group in
fluencing Stanford research is the Palo
Alto Humane Society, which operates
through legal means to challenge Stan
ford on health and safety as well as
animal issues.
The most extreme supporters of
animal research are not university offi
cials and scientists, but groups of
patients, such as the Incurably 111 for
Environmental Research, who would
like researchers to have license to ex
periment in any fashion.
Universities, which recognize the need
for certain restrictions on research to
protect the animals, represent a more
middle ground, Hamm said.
The Oregon break-in led to what is
believed to be the first criminal prose
cution in this country of a participant
in a raid on an animal research labora
tory, according to The Eugene Register
Guard.
Roger Troen, 57, a former elementary
school teacher, was found guilty Jan.
21 on charges of first-degree theft, con
spiracy to commit second-degree bur
glary and second-degree burglary,
according to The Register Guard.
"The animal rights movement
means that animals have the
same rights as people," Hamm
said. "A rat is the same as a boy
and should be treated the same
as a boy."

Although much of animal re
search is not directed toward dis
covering the cure to a specific dis
ease, without the knowledge ob
tained through basic research,
many deadly and debilitating dis
eases from polio to heart disease
could not be prevented or treated
today.
Treatment of high blood pres
sure with drugs such as inderal
would be impossible without basic
research using frogs and mam
mals dating back to the 19305.
"The modern treatment of
heart disease involving pace
makers and bypass surgeries
depends upon many decades of
research on heart physiology and
anatomy," Gordon-Lickey and
Marrocco said in a March 25 ed
itorial in The Register Guard.
They stress that research into
the function and structure of an
intact organ requires experiment
ing with live animals.

"Similarly, curing AIDS is
going to require that non-human
primates be deliberately infec
ted," according to the editorial.
Today, doctors have drugs to
treat Parkinson's disease, a dis
ease that degenerates a region of
the brain that controls certain
motor skills. Victims of this dis
ease are usually over 50 and suffer
from tremors, rigidity and inabil
ity to initiate movement, accord
ing to Gordon-Lickey.
The cause of Parkinson's dis
ease — a decrease in the commu
nication of nerve cells which
release a chemical called dop
amine — had to be learned before
a medication to treat it could be
found.
However, before scientists
could even ask the question,
"What causes Parkinson's dis
ease?" they had to acquire a basic
understanding of the way nerve
cells communicate across gaps or
synapses. It is this basic under
standing that much of animal re
search is meant to provide.
Every surgical procedure must
be perfected on animals before it
can be practiced on humans, ac
cording to Gordon-Lickey. Human
heart transplants would not be
possible without experiments
using dogs.
Any drugs now used to cure
diseases had to have been tested
for both safety and efficacy on
animals before they could be used
on humans, Gordon-Lickey said.
The release of the animals from
the Oregon labs delayed several
important research projects and
put an end to others. One of the
stolen rabbits, for example, was
the only one in existence whose
blood contained an antibody used
by researchers all over the world
to diagnose a malady called
"floppy baby syndrome," accord

ing to Gordon-Lickey.
Another stolen rabbit contained
an insect-killing antibody that sci
entists were hoping might be able
to replace pesticides.
A Stanford University medical
professor studying Alzheimer's
disease stated, in a letter read by
the Judge at the Oregon sentenc
ing, that the raids on labs in Cal
ifornia are having a "terrifying
impact" on his field, including
scaring the brightest students
from going into research.
