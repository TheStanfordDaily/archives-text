# Panel blames sports racism on society
## 
### Michael Lenz 
The alleged racism in professional
baseball that has gained national atten
tion in the past year is largely a reflec
tion of American society as a whole,
panelists said last night in a discussion
held in Kresge Auditorium.
"It is impossible to have sports in a
non-racist way in a society . . . which
is racist," said panelist Terry Jones,
professor of sociology at Cal State-
Hayward. Jones said that the attitudes
expressed in baseball and other profes
sional sports reflect popular sentiment,
and that so far attempts have been made
only "to cover up but not (to) deal with
inequities in professional baseball."
Jones and three other panelists ad
dressed the issue of racism in mfyor
league baseball in a discussion titled
"Race For the Pennant: The Changing
Face of Baseball." The panelists cited

organizational structures, staffing pro
cedures and media apathy as sources
of perpetuated racial discrimination in
baseball.
Prejudice in professional baseball en
tered the national spotlight last April
following remarks made by then-Los
Angeles Dodgers vice president A 1 Cam
panis. In an interview on ABC's
"Nightline," Campanis said that "blacks
do not have the necessities" to hold
management positions in baseball.
Campanis was fired the following day.
Panelist Corey Busch, executive vice
president of the San Francisco Giants,
said the Campanis incident has had a
positive effect on the industry's racial
attitudes. "Sometimes it takes a (con
troversial) event to bring about change
which is long overdue," he said.
Only 1.9 percent of league man
agement officials are black, said Henry

McGee, a professor of law at UCLA.
Twenty percent of the players are black,
compared to 54 percent of professional
football players and 75 percent of bas
ketball players.
The problem came into especially
sharp focus on Tuesday, when Frank
Robinson — who became major league
baseball's first black manager when he
took the helm of the Cleveland Indians
in 1975 — was appointed manager of
the Baltimore Orioles. Robinson, who
also managed the San Francisco Giants
from 1981-1984, is still the game's only
black manager.
McGee blamed racial prejudice on the
organization of the industry. Baseball
teams, he said, are "small, clubby, even
incestuous organizations much like fra
ternities — people are picked (for man
agerial positions) because they are close,
personal friends."
