# ASSU demands Boathouse renovation

Warning that the Lake Lagunita
Boathouse is "in virtually irreparable
condition," ASSU officials Monday for
mally requested that the University
replace the 49-year-old structure.
In a letter addressed to University
officials — including Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons and University
President Donald Kennedy — the ASSU
officials said that the student union
might be willing to relinquish ownership
of the Boathouse if the administration
were to assume financial responsibility
for replacing the building.
Lyons responded favorably to the re
quest. "We all understand the impor
tance of the Boathouse," he told The
Daily, "and if the ASSU stays behind
it as they have already started to, then
a new boathouse is certainly possibile."
Lyons said a new boathouse might
be funded out of the University's Cen
tennial Campaign, a $1 billion fund

raising effort that began in 1987 and
will continue through 1991.
"While the overall Centennial objec
tives have already been set, it is still
possible to raise funds for the Boathouse
as part of the Centennial Campaign,"
he said. Some people are not willing to
donate money to the University's gen
eral fund, he said, but they may be
willing to give to a "concrete" project
like the Boathouse.
The Boathouse was built in 1939, was
condemned in 1969, and underwent
emergency renovation in 1972. The
1972 renovation left the structure in
the operable — but far from optimal
— condition that exists to this day, said
senior Tigre Wenrich, a manager at the
Boathouse.
Currently the Boathouse is used for
storing equipment for water sports on
Lagunita and for social events.
"If a new boathouse were built," Wen
rich said, "then student meeting space,
showers and wheelchair-accessible

bathrooms could be included, which the
current boathouse does not have."
The authors of the letter also re
quested that renovations include show
ers and lockers for joggers and lake
users, and a concession stand for beach
goers.
The letter cited several problems with
the building: inability to use the upper
deck for large groups; an understruc
ture "in need of repair and reinforce
ment"; and an "appearance marred by
terminally peeling paint and other
visible signs of deterioration."
The ASSU, however, has been unable
in recent years to muster funding for
replacement of the structure. "We wish
that the ASSU were able to provide the
funds needed to construct a new boat
house," the letter states, but several
requests for student capital fees have
failed at the polls.
"The cost for a new boathouse could

have fewer safety problems to worry about.
