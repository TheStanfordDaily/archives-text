# Kennedy outlines goals for 2010

### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy's wish list for Stanford
in the year 2010 includes —
surprise — better teaching at
Stanford and more opportunities
nationwide for minority students
interested in academic careers.
Unveiling his long-range goals
for the University yesterday at
the annual meeting of the Aca
demic Council, Kennedy said
Stanford should do more to
promote "good teaching among
faculty and graduate teaching as
sistants" and to develop "pro
grams (with other institutions) to
target minority students for grad
uate work leading toward aca
demic careers."
The Academic Council is the
collective body of tenured and
tenure-track professors. Kennedy
chairs the council.
Last winter, while Kennedy was
on a leave of absence, he and five
advisers formed a planning group
to brainstorm future objectives
for Stanford. Kennedy's group
began bv trying to predict what
Stanford would De like in the year
2010 if current policies remained
in effect. The planning group's
crystal ball revealed an image that
"wasn't very flattering," accord
ing to Kennedy.
Kennedy said one quagmire the
University must escape is "indi

rect costs." Research efforts are
drained by an "indirect" delay in
federal monetary support for in
vestigators at Stanford, Kennedy
said.
Stanford will naturally adapt to
changing conditions over the next
25 years, Kennedy noted, but
there are still some projects that
the Univeroity should try to ac
complish.
Addressing the need to improve
teaching quality, Kennedy said
that although teaching here has
improved over the past decade,
Stanford still needs an "urgent
mandate" to continue this trend.
Kennedy emphasized that he
aimed simply to propose goals, not
outline steps for implementation,
so he did not specify exactly how
the University would improve
teaching quality.
Kennedy said the new agenda
is "not an end." It marks a "new
stage" for the University.
In meetingß last winter, the
planning group composed a list of
"internal and external factors
that will shape Stanford's future
over the next 25 years," Kennedy
said.
Among other things, the factors
included demographics, competi
tion with other universities, eco
nomic restraints and allocation of
financial resources.
From this list, the group came
up with 25 policy objectives for
the University to work on over

the next year.
Kennedy's new agenda also
calls for the University to con
tinue its "leadership of national
efTorts among universities to in
fluence the federal policies of re
search support." Kennedy added
that this will require institutional
cooperation and that Stanford
should continue its present role.
Kennedy called for some new
University policies to improve
Stanford's relationship with local
political jurisdictions and to
restructure the University retire
ment incentives for both individ
uals and departments.
