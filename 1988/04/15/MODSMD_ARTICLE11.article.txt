# Two students named Truman Scholars
## 
### Brent Bigler 
Chosen from among 1,600 ap
plicants nationwide, sophomores
Leslie Hatamiya and Andrew Weis
have been named as this year's
Truman Scholars, garnering
$28,000 apiece for the honor.
The scholarships, appropriated
by Congress, are awarded each
year to 100 students who have
shown a "very strong record of
political activity" and plan careers
in public service, according to Po
litical Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall, one of the reviewers of the
Stanford applicants.
The money is paid out in $7,000
increments for the final two years
of undergraduate study and the
first two years of graduate study.
Hatamiya and Weis are involved
in Stanford-in-Government, and
both plan to participate in intern
ships this summer in Washington,
D.C.
In addition, Hatamiya is active
in the Stanford Democrats and
Stanford Students for Dukakis.
Weis will attend Stanford-in-

Washington next fall to partici
pate in yet another internship.
After receiving her award letter
last Friday, Hatamiya said, "I'm
pretty shocked; it hasn't set in
yet." She said that in applying for
the scholarship she never thought
she would get it, but decided to
"go for it."
Weis had a similiar reaction.
"It's a very nice honor," he said.
"I never actually thought I'd
win."
Scholarship applicants from
Stanford were interviewed by a
committee made up of Marshall,
Economics Prof. Gavin Wright
and Tim Stanton, a staff member
with the Public Service Center.
According to Marshall, the com
mittee took into account the ap
plicants' academic record, involve
ment in political activities and
poise in front of a panel.
Each of the Stanford applicant's
files was then reviewed by a na
tional committee, and those selec
ted for an interview faced a panel
of six in the final stage of the
process.
