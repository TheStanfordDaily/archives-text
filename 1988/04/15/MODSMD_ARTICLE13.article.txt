Trade bill compromise is dead
WASHINGTON — After two days of intense
negotiation, congressional Democratic leaders
yesterday defied President Reagan's veto
threats and abandoned further attempts to
reach a compromise with the administration
on the omnibu» trade bill.
They said that the bill, which would overhaul
the nation's trade policies, would retain a con
troversial provision to require manufacturers
to give 60 days notice before closing un
profitable plants or laying off large numbers
of workers. Reagan has threatened to veto any
bill with that provision.
Citing yesterday's report of an increased
trade deficit and the 100-point stock market
collapse in its wake, Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W Va., and House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, announced that they had
instructed House and Senate negotiators to
prepare the final 1,000-page bill for forwarding
to Reagan's desk, for the all but certain con
frontation.
"We have gone more than half way to meet
the administration's concerns," Wright and
Byrd said in a joint statement.... We now
believe strongly that we must move as quickly
as possible with a strong trade and competi
tiveness bill, including protection for workers
who are about to be laid off or whose plants
are about to close."
Earlier, representatives of organized labor
told Democratic leaders that they could not
endorse the trade bill if the plant closings
measure was removed. Several other strong
protectionist provisions favored by labor al
ready had been deleted.
Mine damages frigate in Gulf
WASHINGTON — A U.S. warship appar
ently hit a mine yesterday after escorting a
U.S.-registered Kuwaiti tanker through the
Persian Gulf, leaving 10 American sailors in
jured, Department of Defense officials said.
The guided-missile frigate Samuel Roberts
suffered what officials described as "an un
derwater explosion" in the central gulf about
70 miles east of Bahrain. The blast, which
occurred at 10:10 a.m. EDT, started a fire,
caused significant hull damage and left the
frigate's engine room flooded, officials said,
but the ship was in no danger of sinking.
One of the iryured sailors has serious burns,
the Pentagon said late yesterday, and the
others suffered slight burns or back injuries.
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said none
of the injuries was "life threatening."
The injuries and damage were the first suf
fered by a U.S. warship in the gulf since the
Stark, another guided-missile frigate, was hit
by two missiles fired by an Iraqi jet last May,
killing 37 American sailors. Iraq said the attack
on the Stark was an accident, and U.S. officials
have accepted the explanation.
