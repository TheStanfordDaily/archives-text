# U.S., Soviets sign historic Afghan pact
## U.S.-Soviet accord could be model for cooperation in settling Third World conflicts 
### 
GENEVA â€” The United States and the Soviet
Union, joined by Pakistan and Afghanistan, signed
a fragile agreement yesterday calling for withdrawal
of Soviet forces from Afghanistan but allowing the
superpowers, according to the U.S. interpretation,
to continue pouring arms into the eight-year-old
civil war.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who signed the
accords for the United States, told reporters that
the agreement was a historic one that could become
a model for cooperation between the U.S. and Soviet
governments in settling other Third World conflicts.
Nevertheless, Shultz said, the United States
would not stop supplying weapons to the anti-
Communist "moujahedeen" guerrillas in Afghani
stan unless Moscow ended its military aid to the
government of President N^jibullah.
He said that the United States would "meet
restraint with restraint" in the event Moscow
stopped sending arms to the government forces.
But as long as Soviet arms continued to reach the
army, he declared, "the moujahedeen may be sure
that the United States will continue to support
them."
In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater also said that the United States "will
support the moujahedeen as the Soviets support

the Kabul government."
"We would expect the rebels to remain an active
and viable fighting forces ... if the Afghan govern
ment is operating in the same fashion," he said.
Fitzwater said President Reagan had encouraged
the rebels to "fight on if the opposition remains, if
the fight is there to maintain."
The moujahedeen have rejected the Geneva agree
ment and have vowed to ignore it.
The key aspect of the accord, from the U.S. point
of view, is withdrawal of the 115,000 Soviet forces
that have been in Afghanistan since 1979.
"The faithful implementation of the withdrawal
commitments . . . will do much to improve the at
mosphere for our bilateral relations." Shultz said
Asked how Washington can trust Moscow to pull
out its forces, he replied, "It is well to be cautious
in our dealing with the Soviet Union, but it is also
well to be willing to agree when we can agree."
After the signing ceremony, Shultz met for about
90 minutes with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to discuss issues that will be on the
agenda next week when Shultz visits- Moscow to
continue planning for the upcoming summit meeting
between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
