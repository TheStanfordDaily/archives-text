# Imports surge, sends trade deficit back up
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — In a report
that rocked financial markets
around the world and sent Wall
Street into a tailspin, the Depart
ment of Commerce disclosed yes
terday that the monthly U.S.
trade deficit swelled by $1.4 bil
lion to $13.8 billion in February.
"This is disasterville for the
markets," said John Paulus, chief
economist at Morgan Stanley, a
New York investment broker.
"Under this kind of pressure, the
dollar is going to have to fall ap
preciably."
Although U.S. exports contin
ued to rise, expanding by $1.2
billion in February to $23.6 bil
lion, the increase was swamped
by a surge of foreign goods that
sent imports up $2.6 billion to
$37.4 billion.
Most analysts had expected the
trade deficit to fall at least $1
billion from January's $12.4 bil
lion, primarily because normal
seasonal factors during February
usually produce a substantial im
provement in U.S. exports and a
modest slowdown in imports.
But when the figures indicated
the trade gap had widened in
stead, currency traders around
the globe quicldy dumped dollars
out of fear that the greenback
still had not fallen far enough to

help bring the U.S. trade deficit
under control.
Eventually, a decline in the dol
lar is supposed to narrow the
trade deficit by making foreign
goods more expensive in the
United States and American prod
ucts cheaper abroad. But it is dif
ficult to staunch the flow of im
ports as long as spending remains
robust in the United States.
"Ironically, the root of the trade
problem is that the American con
sumer is coming back," said David
Wyss, a senior economist at Data
Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass. "Investors are convinced
that Americans must stop spend
ing so much on foreign goods, and
if they won't cut back on their
own, the markets are going to try
to do it for them."
Economists cautioned, how
ever, against reading too much
significance into the notoriously
volatile trade figures. "In terms
of substance, you can't draw any
firm conclusions from one
month's numbers," said Ira
Kaminow, chief economist at the
Government Research Corp.
"Despite this (increase), there's
no doubt that the trade deficit is
still heading down."
