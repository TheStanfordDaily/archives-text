# Koch endorses Gore in N.Y.
## 
### 
NEW YORK — Powerful and contro
versial Mayor Edward Koch bestowed
his long-awaited endorsement yesterday
on Albert Gore Jr., creating a new flicker
of hope for the Tennessee senator's long
shot presidential campaign in the final
days before the crucial Democratic pri
mary here.
The New York mayor's political influ
ence may help Gore shake his biggest
problem, a perception that he is not a
serious contender in what is developing
as a two-man race for the nomination.
Although a strong showing Tuesday is
crucial to the survival of Gore's cam
paign, polls show him running a distant
third, unable to break out of the single
digits.
The endorsement from one of the Rev.
Jesse Jackson's harshest critics also ad
dresses one of Gore's deeper, more sensi
tive difficulties in this racially charged
atmosphere: the idea that a vote for
Gore indirectly helps Jackson by cutting
into the margin of Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis. Gore and his aides
have complained that the word was
being passed quietly around, particularly
among Jewish voters, that a vote for
Gore amounted to a vote for Jackson.
"The primaries in New York ought to
be fought out on the basis of one's hopes
and not on the basis of one's fears,"
Gore insisted, adding that Koch's en
dorsement says "once and for all in this
city and this state, a vote for Gore is a
vote for Gore."
Although Gore has avidly courted

Jewish voters by stressing his pro-Israel
record, many of the conservative Jews
who might otherwise support him are
more driven by their desire to defeat
Jackson. They cannot forgive Jackson
for once referring to New York with the
slur "Hymietown" and associated with
black Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan,
whose numerous anti-Semitic remarks
have included a reference to Judaism as
a "gutter religion."
Never one to mince words, Koch added
to the tension two weeks ago, when he
announced that any Jews or supporters
of Israel "have got to be crazy" to vote
for Jackson. Koch compared that
prospect to a black voting for someone
who supported the government of South
Africa.
At this point, Koch's endorsement is
certain to be "a positive factor in the
Jewish community," which generally
casts about one-quarter of New York's
Democratic primary votes, said City
Councilman Robert Dryfoos, who is un
committed in the presidential race.
Some analysts have speculated that
Jackson may have benefited from Koch's
earlier attack, because it could increase
turnout among angered blacks, who will
rally behind the first of their race to
make a serious run at the White House.
Blacks compose another quarter of the
Democratic electorate here.
Koch said he would even campaign
for Jackson if he were the nominee,
