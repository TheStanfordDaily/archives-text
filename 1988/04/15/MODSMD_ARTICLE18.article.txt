## No more excuses 
### 
THE EXCUSES must stop.
There is no excuse for
neglecting campus health
and safety. There is no excuse for
one employee to be dying and other
employees to be showing
symptoms of possible asbestos con
tamination. The University must
stop making excuses for its
negligence.
In Tresidder Union, a pipe
wrapped with asbestos remained
uncovered for eight years. Why?
The pipe was located in the
bakery, where it could easily con
taminate the kitchen's cooking
utensils. There were complaints
for years about asbestos fibers in
the kitchen's pots and pans.
Frank Kutch, a former baker at
Tresidder who is dying of lung can
cer, has been for eight years one
of the most persistent complainers
— but Tresidder didn't listen,
flagrantly demonstrating a disre
gard for workers' safety.
Tresidder managers didn't con
cern themselves with the pipe until
it was reported that Kutch was
dying. Only then did the pipe's
replacement become a high
priority. Within 48 hours, the Uni
versity removed the pipe.
Tresidder's first excuse? Man
agement turnover. Nothing was
done, officials say, because the
management of Tresidder has
changed often in recent years.
This is absurd. The entire Tres
idder staff does not change with
each management change. Certain
things have to get done no matter
who's in charge.
Tresidder's second excuse? Air
sampling test results. Recent

measurements of the asbestos
levels in the kitchen's air reported
safe conditions, so the pipe's re
placement was not a high priority.
This is also absurd. You need a
test to tell you that exposed as
bestos is dangerous about as much
as you need a test to tell you that
jumping off skyscrapers is not safe.
The pipe was a clear — and obvious
— health hazard.
Linda Crouse, chief steward of
the United Stanford Workers, may
very well be correct when she
charges the University with
"playing statistical roulette with
workers' lives" by relying on the
University's ineffectual asbestos
survey.
The four-year survey, currently
underway, declared the Tresidder
bakery "safe." It is the same survey
that told us that campus dorms
and buildings are safe. Stanford
students, faculty and staff should
be wary. Is the University gam
bling with their lives also? The
Stanford community must be
guaranteed that its health is not
in danger.
The University must truthfully
answer questions about asbestos
contamination and all other health
hazards on campus. The days of
turning a blind eye and a deaf ear
must come to an end.
No one must be allowed to die
before the University decides to
become serious about health and
safety standards and enforcement.
It is time the University and Tres
idder be held accountable for their
actions.
And more importantly, it is time
for common sense to prevail.
