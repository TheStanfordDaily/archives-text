## Don't overlook Jewish suffering incurred by Poles 
### 
GORDON BLACK'S April 1 letter
defending Norman Davies ig
nores the real issue, which is of
course Norman Davies' controversial
scholarship on Polish-Jewish relations.
Instead, Black elucidates his own
view of Polish war history. Nowhere
does he make reference to Davies'
opinions on these matters.
Besides this oversight in Black's
letter, which makes it immaterial to
his stated topic, his version of Polish
war history is skewed. He cites the
statistic of 3,000,000 civilian Polish
war dead to argue that the Poles were
victims of "genocidal actions" as were
the Jews.
In fact, many victims included in
that statistic were killed in air raids

and other military maneuvers, which
does not qualify as genocide. Moreover,
Poles in concentration camps were
interned there primarily as political or
military prisoners.
Black glosses over the crucial differ
ence that all Jewish persons, active in
the resistance or not, were shipped to
the camps. That is genocide. One is a
war crime; the other is a crime against
humanity.
No matter how great Polish suffer
ing at the hands of Germans was, this
does not mitigate Jewish suffering at
the hands of the Poles. Before the
war, Poland's "National Democratic
Party," backed by the Catholic Church,
drafted racial legislation in 1937 bor
rowed almost verbatim from the Ger-

mans, and party affiliates even began
using the Hitler salute.
It encouraged pogroms, and violence
against Jews ran rampant. Under
German occupation, Polish civilians
compiled a formidable record of
atrocities against Jews, unequalled by
any other country not aligned with
Germany.
The underground Home Army re
ported "it is a fact that the over
whelming mfiyority of the country is
anti-Semitic."
After the war, pogroms resumed.
Polish mobs killed around 1,000
Jewish survivors between March 1945
and August 1946, indignant that Hitler
had not finished the job. The leader of
the Sobibor death-camp revolt, Leon
Feldhendler, was among the victims.

As a result, 150,000 Jews fled
Poland. Over half of the Jews remain
ing in Poland in 1969 emigrated when
a wave of anti-Semitism purged Jews
from universities and political and
economic positions.
In other words, persecution of Poles
does not preclude persection by Poles.
Black's pain over Polish war losses
carries no weight as an apologia for
Polish behavior.
If I have ignored Davies' record, it is
because the letter to which I respond
does so as well. Black has simply
provided us with a revisionist nistory,
as elided as it is irrevelant to the the
debate at Stanford.
