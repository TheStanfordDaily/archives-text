# Profs. petition faculty to break off Hoover ties

Political Science Prof. John Manley and
English Prof. Ron Rebholz sent copies of
a petition to over 200 faculty members
yesterday as part of their long-standing
efforts to sever ties between the University
and the Hoover Institution.
The petition seeks to force the Faculty
Senate to discuss Manley's and Rebholz's
demands that the University separate itself
from Hoover. Recently the Faculty Senate
Steering Committee refused to place the
issue on the senate's agenda.
Manley said he and Rebholz hope to "go
over the heads" of the Steering Committee
and appeal directly to the faculty.
Citing their previous success with senate
petitions to examine the University's rela
tions with Hoover, Manley said he and
Rebholz hope the faculty will again be
responsive to their proposal.
Currently, the Steering Committee is

being "overly responsive to (University
President) Donald Kennedy and the
provost" in their support of Hoover, Manley
said. According to Manley, the administra
tion has been "stonewalling the issue for
five years," preferring instead to increase
ties between Stanford and Hoover.
Chair of the Steering Committee Gerald
Lieberman, a professor of operation re
search and statistics, declined to comment
on the committee's decision.
According to Manley, the recent petition
calls on provisions made in the 1985
Dornbusch Report, which recommended
that if relations between the two institu
tions did not improve, Stanford should con
sider a separation. The Dornbusch report
was written by a faculty committee estab
lished to examine the relationship between
Stanford and Hoover.
Since 1985, relations between the two
institutions have deteriorated, especially in
