# Profs. petition faculty to break off Hoover ties
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Political Science Prof. John Manley and
English Prof. Ron Rebholz sent copies of
a petition to over 200 faculty members
yesterday as part of their long-standing
efforts to sever ties between the University
and the Hoover Institution.
The petition seeks to force the Faculty
Senate to discuss Manley's and Rebholz's
demands that the University separate itself
from Hoover. Recently the Faculty Senate
Steering Committee refused to place the
issue on the senate's agenda.
Manley said he and Rebholz hope to "go
over the heads" of the Steering Committee
and appeal directly to the faculty.
Citing their previous success with senate
petitions to examine the University's rela
tions with Hoover, Manley said he and
Rebholz hope the faculty will again be
responsive to their proposal.
Currently, the Steering Committee is

being "overly responsive to (University
President) Donald Kennedy and the
provost" in their support of Hoover, Manley
said. According to Manley, the administra
tion has been "stonewalling the issue for
five years," preferring instead to increase
ties between Stanford and Hoover.
Chair of the Steering Committee Gerald
Lieberman, a professor of operation re
search and statistics, declined to comment
on the committee's decision.
According to Manley, the recent petition
calls on provisions made in the 1985
Dornbusch Report, which recommended
that if relations between the two institu
tions did not improve, Stanford should con
sider a separation. The Dornbusch report
was written by a faculty committee estab
lished to examine the relationship between
Stanford and Hoover.
Since 1985, relations between the two
institutions have deteriorated, especially in
light of a report made last year
by Hoover Senior Research Fellow
George Marotta, the petition
states.
In his report, Marotta examined
the voting records of 534 Stanford
faculty members and concluded
that there was an overwhelming
liberal ideological bias held by
most University faculty. Marotta
speculated that this bias may con
tribute to the tension between
Stanford faculty and Hoover.
Manley said this report was tan
tamount to "open warfare"
against the University, harming
Stanford's public image. In their
letters, Manley and Rebholz cite
numerous newspaper editorials
which accuse Stanford of being
liberally biased.
Marotta said he did not think
he was responsible for damaging
the University's reputation.
Citing the dismissal by the
Dornbusch committee of the
charge that the Hoover Institu
tion was a partisan group,

Marotta said his study shows the
University is "not as balanced"
ideologically as Hoover.
"I just reported my research,"
Marotta said. "If it turns out to
be derogatory, I just deliver the
message It's not me creating
a bad image, but the behavior of
certain professors who are in
tolerant."
In addition, Manley said Marot
ta's methods of "snooping" into
the personal voting records of fac
ulty members were wholly inap
propriate as well as unreliable for
determining individual political
beliefs.
Marotta explained he did not
want to investigate the voting
records of faculty members, but
he could find no other way to
conduct his research.
Marotta said "nothing new has
happened since the Dornbusch
Committee report." He said he
began his study as a result of the
senate's refused last year to build
the Reagan Library.
He accused the senate of creat
ing "a situation where we do not
have a Presidential library of a
president who just happens to be
a Republican."
