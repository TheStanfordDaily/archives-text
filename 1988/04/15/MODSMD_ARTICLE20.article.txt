# Concert Network is a good organization
## 
### 
After six years at Stanford and a
year as a member of the Council of
Presidents, I've read something in The
Daily so completely misleading it war
rants a letter: the April 12 "endorse
ment" of the Concert Network Special
Fee request.
It is mentioned that the Concert
Network "has never worked." Yet four
years ago it helped bring the Grateful
Dead, Kenny Loggins, Santana, Pat
Benatar and the Beach Boys to Stan
ford. How soon we forget. Maybe the
editorial board should read some of
The Daily's back issues.
And the staffs "absurdly high"
salaries will be a whopping $150 per
month for the Director and $37.50 per
month for the Production Manager.
I'm sure the student body would feel
raped if it knew this.
Most importantly, unlike any other

student organization, the Network
receives its fee contingent upon the
promotion of at least five rock shows
next year. No rock shows means no fee
receipts.
You say that the Network should
give up to Bill Graham. That's the
attitude! And maybe KZSU should give
up to KITS, or Chaparral should give
up to the National Lampoon. Granted,
no other organization competes so di
rectly with "real world" businesses
(not to mention University bureaucra
cy).
Yet the Network will have brought
Alex Bennett, the Tubes, the Beat
Farmers, Fishbone and the Grateful
Dead to campus this year.
Like KZSU, the Concert Network
provides an ideal educational opportu
nity for students interested in pursu
ing careers in entertainment. Former
Network staffers have gone on to work
for Warner Bros., MCA, Atlantic
Records and Pace Concerts. Or does
The Daily feel that everyone at Stan
ford today wants to work for Bain &

Co.?
It disappoints me that the Network
has not done a better job in publiciz
ing its activities. Moreover, last year's
staff was so inept that it was forced to
resign. Anyone working for a student
organization knows that there will
always be peaks and valleys. With the
current experienced staff and Univer
sity cooperation, the present rebound
can only be enhanced in the coming
years.
