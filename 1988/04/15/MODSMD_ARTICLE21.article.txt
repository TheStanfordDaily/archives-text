# Charges of ‘reverse racism’ unfounded
## 
### 
I have a few comments in reference
to the April 11 letter, "Charges of
racism unfair." Most whites are com
fortable in their own assessments of
what constitutes racist activity. Most
blacks and other non-whites are suspi
cious at best of such comfort zones.
Slavery was not an accident, nor are

the concomitant non-white racial
stereotypes accidental or trivial. Our
current popular, racist mentality,
which is the residue of years of condi
tioning and propaganda, is woven into
every facet of American life.
To expect that non-whites
"trust" whites to be fair, unbiased and
supportive to a community that is even
now being further purposely damaged
by whites is a cruel joke.
I strongly disagree with the implied
charges of "reverse racism." In the
midst of 400 years of sanctioned "ra
cial tensions," white Americans look
pretty silly crying foul when the game
changes to include a sharing of power.
I am ashamed to live among such
callous and mean-spirited people. But
I'll continue to marvel at the truly
gross hypocrisy of it all.
Meanwhile, white male-fashioned
definitions of racism, democracy, jus
tice and intelligence operate daily with
impunity. So, what's fair?
