## Catering to New York 
### 
NEW YORK'S democratic primary,
with its 255 delegates, will be re
solved Tuesday, we now know,
without divine guidance from His
Eminence Mario the First.
"What we've got is an embarrassment
of riches," Cuomo said of the party's
chaos so late in the White House race.
Riches? Maybe. Democrats can cer
tainly agree on one thing, though, about
the field and the way it's been campaign
ing in New York: It's an embarrassment,
all right.
Look at Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, better known as the cousin of
this year's best supporting actress. He
enters New York with a razor-thin lead
in delegates and slight momentum from
his win in Wisconsin.
Though I feel Dukakis is not the party's
strongest potential standard-bearer vs.
George Herbert Walker Bush, I do have
to respect his consistency. Unlike rivals
Sen. A 1 Gore, D-Tenn., and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Dukakis has resisted the temp
tation to retailor his message as he moves
from state to state. Yes indeed, the Du
kakis message has been consistent.
Boring as hell, but consistent.
Look at A 1 Gore. The 40-year-old U.S.
senator had won respect early on for his
mixture of moderation in foreign and
military policy with progressivism in so
cial and economic issues. He'd even
succeeded in making millions forget
about Tipper.
Then he gets off the plane in New
York, which happens to be 25 percent
Jewish, and, by golly, he suddenly finds
a new issue: Israel.
Gore has decided to play that popular
New York street politics game, Panic The
Jews (to use a phrase coined by The New

Republic's Hendrik Hertzberg). In a
speech before a Jewish group two weeks
ago, he criticized Dukakis and Jackson
for what amounted to espousing less than
fanatical support of Israel.
He may be on terra firma when it
comes to Jackson, at least from the
Zionist perspective.
But Dukakis is about as orthodox a
supporter of Israel as you will find. When
playing Panic The Jews, though, you have
to place yourself to the right of all others
in order to win. So when Dukakis en
dorsed a letter issued last month by 30
senators (including such staunch Israel
backers as Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Frank Lauten
berg, D-N.J., protesting Israeli intrac
tability in the occupied territories, Gore
was ready to pounce.
"At this time of tension and violence,"
he swaggered, "such action sends
precisely the wrong message." Wrong.
The message — that the United States
will always support Israel but will not
always support individual Israeli policies
— seems precisely the right one. In sum,
A 1 Gore has embarrassed himself in New
York by shamelessly pandering to Jews.
Look at Jesse Jackson. He is still
haunted, unjustly, by his "Hymietown"
slip and, quite justly, by his ongoing as
sociation with black racist Louis Farrak
han — the Nation of Islam leader who
called Hitler "a great man" and Judaism
"a gutter religion."
So which voting group feels most
alienated by Jackson? Which bit of the
New York electorate do you think, there
fore, he'd be catering to?
I'll give you one guess.
Sure enough, Jackson has done every

thing possible to heal the rift with the
Jewish community while campaigning in
New York. He's trying too hard.
Even before Super Tuesday, the Jack
son campaign worked hard to spotlight
its many Jewish members. Great. For an
entire year, moreover, Jackson remained
largely silent on the Israeli-Palestinian
issue. Not so great. And now that he's
in New York, he's actually backpedaling
from his earlier, pro-PLO positions,
hoping to appease the Jewish voters.
Jackson even promised that, as Presi
dent, he wouldn t again meet with PLO
chief Yasser Arafat. Well, there's a switch
— putting Jackson somewhere to the
right of George Shultz.
The change in tone in the Jackson
campaign, just in time for the New York
primary, is understandable but ulti
mately transparent and cosmetic. Next I
expect to see him, yarmulke in place,
opening speeches with a hearty
"Shalom."
Gore and Jackson have hurt them
selves in New York, and the vote tally
on Tuesday for Dukakis will show that
Slow and Steady — and Well-funded —
often wins the race. Where his rivals
have tired, the duke has endured.
But will he be bushed by November?

New York electorate do you think, there
fore, he'd be catering to?
I'll give you one guess.
Sure enough, Jackson has done every

thing possible to heal the rift with the
Jewish community while campaigning in
New York. He's trying too hard.
Even before Super Tuesday, the Jack
son campaign worked hard to spotlight
its many Jewish members. Great. For an
entire year, moreover, Jackson remained
largely silent on the Israeli-Palestinian
issue. Not so great. And now that he's
in New York, he's actually backpedaling
from his earlier, pro-PLO positions,
hoping to appease the Jewish voters.
Jackson even promised that, as Presi
dent, he wouldn t again meet with PLO
chief Yasser Arafat. Well, there's a switch
— putting Jackson somewhere to the
right of George Shultz.
The change in tone in the Jackson
campaign, just in time for the New York
primary, is understandable but ulti
mately transparent and cosmetic. Next I
expect to see him, yarmulke in place,
opening speeches with a hearty
"Shalom."
Gore and Jackson have hurt them
selves in New York, and the vote tally
on Tuesday for Dukakis will show that
Slow and Steady — and Well-funded —
often wins the race. Where his rivals
have tired, the duke has endured.
But will he be bushed by November?

NEW YORK'S democratic primary,
with its 255 delegates, will be re
solved Tuesday, we now know,
without divine guidance from His
Eminence Mario the First.
"What we've got is an embarrassment
of riches," Cuomo said of the party's
chaos so late in the White House race.
Riches? Maybe. Democrats can cer
tainly agree on one thing, though, about
the field and the way it's been campaign
ing in New York: It's an embarrassment,
all right.
Look at Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, better known as the cousin of
this year's best supporting actress. He
enters New York with a razor-thin lead
in delegates and slight momentum from
his win in Wisconsin.
Though I feel Dukakis is not the party's
strongest potential standard-bearer vs.
George Herbert Walker Bush, I do have
to respect his consistency. Unlike rivals
Sen. A 1 Gore, D-Tenn., and the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, Dukakis has resisted the temp
tation to retailor his message as he moves
from state to state. Yes indeed, the Du
kakis message has been consistent.
Boring as hell, but consistent.
Look at A 1 Gore. The 40-year-old U.S.
senator had won respect early on for his
mixture of moderation in foreign and
military policy with progressivism in so
cial and economic issues. He'd even
succeeded in making millions forget
about Tipper.
Then he gets off the plane in New
York, which happens to be 25 percent
Jewish, and, by golly, he suddenly finds
a new issue: Israel.
Gore has decided to play that popular
New York street politics game, Panic The
Jews (to use a phrase coined by The New

Republic's Hendrik Hertzberg). In a
speech before a Jewish group two weeks
ago, he criticized Dukakis and Jackson
for what amounted to espousing less than
fanatical support of Israel.
He may be on terra firma when it
comes to Jackson, at least from the
Zionist perspective.
But Dukakis is about as orthodox a
supporter of Israel as you will find. When
playing Panic The Jews, though, you have
to place yourself to the right of all others
in order to win. So when Dukakis en
dorsed a letter issued last month by 30
senators (including such staunch Israel
backers as Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Frank Lauten
berg, D-N.J., protesting Israeli intrac
tability in the occupied territories, Gore
was ready to pounce.
"At this time of tension and violence,"
he swaggered, "such action sends
precisely the wrong message." Wrong.
The message — that the United States
will always support Israel but will not
always support individual Israeli policies
— seems precisely the right one. In sum,
A 1 Gore has embarrassed himself in New
York by shamelessly pandering to Jews.
Look at Jesse Jackson. He is still
haunted, unjustly, by his "Hymietown"
slip and, quite justly, by his ongoing as
sociation with black racist Louis Farrak
han — the Nation of Islam leader who
called Hitler "a great man" and Judaism
"a gutter religion."
So which voting group feels most
alienated by Jackson? Which bit of the
New York electorate do you think, there
fore, he'd be catering to?
I'll give you one guess.
