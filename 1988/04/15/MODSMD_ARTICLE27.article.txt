## No time to be goofy: Disney Draw is here 
### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
"When you wish upon a star,
it makes no difference who you
are ..
Yes, it is that time of the year
again — the Draw — and with
this year's Disneyland theme, stu
dents will surely be wishing to
draw into their own magic
kingdom. ■
"We're trying to make it a fes
tive atmosphere," Draw Coordi
nator Doug Bunnell said, explain
ing that the theme will be called
"Drawland" this year.
One year the Draw had a Chi
nese theme and the students
cracked fortune cookies to get
their draw number. "It didn't
come off real well," said Roger
Whitney, director of Student
Housing. "Too many of the
cookies broke."
Students striving for the
coveted No. 1 draw card are often
as creative as Draw themes them
selves. "Students come with good
luck charms or dressed up in
tuxedos. One year a student
brought his robot and tried to get
it to draw his number. There's
something new every year," Whit
ney said.
But with 60 different under
graduate residences and addi
tional all-freshman housing, even
elaborate schemes do not always
avert student anxiety about the
process. "The Stanford housing
system is the most diverse and
complex in the United States,"
Whitney said.
Draw history
The Draw used to be a simple
lottery. Students merely picked a
number and those with the high
est numbers chose their housing
first. The process continued until
all was full. There was no guaran
teed/unguaranteed status, return
ing resident priorities or second
round assignments that are asso
ciated with the Draw today.
In 1968 the Draw evolved from
its primitive form into a process
similar to today's. The Draw has
been modified in 1974, 1982 and

1987. Before 1985 unguaranteed
students used to draw from the
same pool of numbers as the
guaranteed students, so the un
guaranteed students had a "good
shot at many of the better loca
tions on campus," Whitney said.
The Roble Hall effect
Whitney said he wanted to as
sure students that the closing of
Roble Hall in January would have
"zero impact" on this year's draw.
Although Roble can house 294
students and will not re-open un
til fall quarter of 1989, Whitney
said that there are 15 more un
dergraduate spaces available this
year than there were last year.
Joshua Lipp, student assistant
in the Housing Center, agreed
that the closing "won't affect
whether or not students get a spot
on campus." Lipp, however, went
on to speculate that the closing
would "lower the cut-off numbers
for the more popular places" next
year.
Some of the emergency spaces
established for the former Roble
residents will be kept as housing
for next year. In addition, some
graduate spots will become un
dergraduate housing for next
year. Many of the graduate spots
in Manzanita, for example, have
been allocated to undergraduates
for next year.
A new housing complex located
near the Cowell Cluster is sched
uled to open next fall and will
provide approximately 780 new
spots for single graduate students
as well.
Closer quarters
In the past, the University has
worked to enlarge student living
quarters by placing only three stu
dents in the trailers that were
originally designed for four and
transforming some dorm triples
into doubles.
Next year the Housing Center
"will have to go back to the con
figurations that these places were
originally defined for," Whitney
admitted. "These are not
cramped, overly restrictive spaces
like some of the Roble refugees

have had this year; we pulled
those out of the Draw for next
year."
Returning residency controversy
Controversy over the Universi
ty's returning resident priority is
certainly not a new aspect of this
year's draw. The controversy
"comes and goes in cycles," Whit
ney said.
The returning residency policy
was established in the mid-'7os
to "ensure continuity in a house,
provide programming support and
give students a place to return to
and feel at home" Whitney ex
plained.
The Housing Center has
modified the policy since its crea
tion, no longer granting freshmen

priority and only allowing up
perclass students to use the
priority once during a guaranteed
year. In addition, students cannot
claim returning residency if their
house has changed its theme.
According to Whitney, the
policy has not been evaluated
since 1984 but will be under
review this spring.
Although Whitney admitted
that Resident Fellows have ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the
policy, he said that he does not
"see many ways to reduce its im
pact without completely removing
(the policy)."
Returning residents fill approx
imately 25 percent of any given
house on campus each year, re
ported Bill Georges, assistant di
rector of the Housing Center.

The most popular choices for
housing do not fluctuate much,
Whitney pointed out. Last year's
most popular choice was 558
Mayfield, requiring a number
lower than 241 for men and 159
for women. Storey house finished
second.
But Whitney warned that "ar
chitecturally neat" buildings do
not necessarily "address the per
sonal needs of the student."
"I've had more complaints from
some of these houses than I've
ever had from Wilbur or Stern.
Students seem to be in a happier
environment in Wilbur."
Only the Suites seem to sway
in popularity from year to year.
The popularity of Governor's Cor
ner seems to be dropping as the
newness wears off, according to

Alvin Lee - Daily
Whitney.
Houses that are not run by the
University are having difficulty
attracting enough residents. Last
year when Synergy could not
recruit enough students to fill the
house, the University proposed
switching the cooperative into a
University-run house. But some
determined Synergy residents
recruited support from students,
faculty and staff and reached an
agreement with the University,
maintaining their co-op status.
According to Synergy resident
Glen Smith, the only modification
at Synergy this year is that "the
house hired a University maid to
clean."
With activities ranging from a


As these randomly selected samples show, the popularity of some housing options has remained
fairly steady, while the draw number in others has fluctuated greatly from year to year.
