# Match wits with the teaser

Okay, readers, this week you
have met your match â€” your
safety match that is.
In 1855 J.E. Lundstrom in
vented the precursor of the
modern-day safety match.
Lundstrom's new match
utilized two chemical com
posities, one on the match stick
and another on the container.
When brought together under
the force of friction, the chemi
cals ignited into a flame.

The match stick is coated in
a combination of potassium
chlorate, glue and trisulfide, and
the match container is coated
with red phosphorus, powdered
glass and glue. With this design
the match can only be ignited
when struck against the match
container.
Before the invention of the
safety match, the "strike
anywhere match" was most
common. The strike anywhere
match, invented in 1827 by
John Walker, replaced the tin
derbox as the most common
method for starting a fire. As
the name implies, the strike
anywhere match can be ignited
on almost any surface.
In both the strike anywhere
and safety match a portion of
the match stick is dipped in par
rafin to allow the match, once

ignited, to burn longer. The
remainder of the match stick is
coated in ammonium phosphate
to prevent hazardous after glow.
The construction of matches
evolved from the ancient art of
firemaking, or pyrotechnics.
Black powder is one pyrotechnic
that greatly impacted Western
civilization.
Invented in China in the 11th
century, black powder was used
to make rockets and fireworks.
It was later introduced to Eu
rope and Robert Bacon recorded
its formula in 1242. Used in the
manufacturing of gunpowder
and mines, black powder soon
became an instrumental weapon
of warfare.
Matches, however, can do

more than start up a fire. Listed
below are a series of puzzles
using matches. See if you are
bright enough to solve them.
