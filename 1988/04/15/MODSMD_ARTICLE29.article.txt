"The Milagro Beanfield War"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at 101
Mountain View
"The Milagro Beanfield War" is
a corny American classic that only
Robert Redford could have made:
It has his unique sensibility and
humor. You'd have to be incred
ibly mean-spirited not to like this
film. It won't impress cinema
"snobs" because it isn't sophisti
cated, profound or disturbing, but
it's great stuff nonetheless: hokey,
charming, wry and wonderful.
The story is set in Milagro, New
Mexico, a beautiful rural town
where all the people are poor,
simple and happy. Life moves
slowly in this rustic wonderland,
the townspeople know what's im
portant. (Yes, it's implausible, but
what of it?)
A black cloud hovers on the
Disney horizon, however. A
greedy, overfed developer plans to
build a resort on the town's land,
which would destroy the commu
nity even more than it already
has been.
In a desperado attempt to revive
some of the town's traditional
ways, a local man, Joe Mon
dragon, illegally diverts water into
his defunct, parched beanfield,
thereby disrupting the develop
ment. Naturally this infuriates
the developers (who look like var
iations on J.R. Ewing) and they
begin the "war" to stop
Mondragon.
It's a battle we've seen before:
good, honest people fighting the
forces of development and big
business. But this isn't another
passionate, self-righteous and po
litical movie dramatizing a good
cause — this film has humor.
The whole show has the feel of
a weird fairy tale. Milagro is filled
with cute gnome-like old people
who resemble fairy tale dwarves.
There are a lot of quirky, silly
touches that give this film its dis
tinctive flavor, and lighten up

what could be a leaden political
message.
There's a large and colorful cast
of characters. The story flits from
one character to another, never
dwelling too long on anyone,
never losing its light touch. The
actors — many of them high
powered and successful — play
their slender roles with surprising
energy and humor.
Sonia Braga is the strong, de
termined woman who wants to
organize the town — for Braga
this is a small and unglamorous
role, but she plays it well.
Christopher Walken, a master
at playing the enigmatic, evil
character, is cast as the suave
troubleshooter sent in to demo
bilize Joe Mondragon. Walken is
more chilling, intriguing and
bizarre than ever here, with his
cowboy hat and oily Texas accent.
He improves every movie he ap
pears in, just by appearing in it.
This film won't hold up under
intense analysis; it's undeniably
simplistic, frequently silly, and its
fairy tale happy ending may make
you wince.
You can either roil your eyes
and disdain this sappy movie, or
you can get into its corny, good
hearted spirit, in which case you
will have a terrific time. This is
a warm, joyous movie, deftly made
and magically sentimental.

"Stand and Deliver"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at 101
Mountain View
Some movies should never have
been made, and, alas, "Stand and
Deliver" is such a movie. It is
based on the true story of an
heroic East Los Angeles high
school teacher who got a class of
unmotivated Hispanic students to
learn calculus, and pass the ad
vanced placement exam.
It's inspirational material and
the film is full of integrity (drip

ping with it!), but it should have
been born a documentary.
Though the filmmakers clearly
milked the material for all it was
worth, there just isn't enough
drama here for a riveting, involv
ing feature film. They should have
recognized this and let it go.
The story itself is quite power
ful, but there isn't much dramatic
tension to it. The bulk of the
movie consists of shots of Jaime
Escalante (Edward James Olmos),
a tired-looking middle-aged man
teaching his class math. There are
a lot of classroom jokes — some
funny, some not-so-funny — and
we're shown Escalante's admira
ble dedication and wry sense of
humor.
We get some flimsy scenes of
students grappling with social and
academic problems, but none of
this is sustained or moving. It's
all too loosely strung together,
and the film never takes off. It
has the feel of a documentary
without a documentary's pointed
ness and insight.
The high point of the film is
when the whole class passes the
A.P. exam and the Educational
Testing Service accuses them of
cheating, presumably because
they are Hispanic. The racist im
plications are interesting, but
never explored much, probably be
cause the film tries to stick to the
"truth." It's too bad they couldn't
have spiced it up a little with
some fabrication.
The class retakes the test, and
in the film's would-be tense
climax we get close-up shots of
equations on the exam as students
pencil in answers. This just isn't
highly dramatic or exciting, in
fact, it's unintentionally quite
comical. Desperately trying to
make drama where none exists —
this is the film's obvious and
repeated failure.
The actors perform brilliantly,
but their parts are shallow. It's
as though they are impersonating
figures in a documentary — there

isn't much color or scope to these
roles. Olmos is a pock-marked,
sagging Escalante — likeable, con
vincing and extremely homely.
Lou Diamond Phillips is the
good-hearted cholo in the class —
he's funnier here than in "La
Bamba." These two actors are in
top form; it's too bad they weren't
handed meatier roles.
"Stand and Deliver" tells an in
teresting story, but as a movie it
is only third rate. Fine acting and
good intentions are wasted in an
inherently undramatic film.

"Hairspray"
Blossom Hill
646 Blossom Hill
San Jose
John Waters, the veteran direc
tor of crude underground com
edies like "Polyester" and "Pink
Flamingos," has made racism the

theme of his new farce
"Hairspray."
Although this film features
Divine, the obese, recently
deceased transvestite star of
Waters' other movies who once
ate dog excrement on-screen, it
should appeal to mainstream
audiences. It isn't gross or grisly;
but it is grotesquely good.
The time is 1962. The Corny
Collins TV dance show is all the
rage with the youth of Baltimore,
including Tracy Turnblad and her
friend Penny. When Tracy sud
denly gets to dance on the show,
her life heats up.
Her mother, played by Divine,
at first thinks her "teen-age
Jezebel" daughter has gone too
far, but changes her mind when
show biz offers start pouring in
for the chubby rising star.
Stylishly decked out in
chartreuse from dressmaking
sponsor Mr. Pinky, Tracy rolls on

ward and upward. She displaces
Amber, the show's ice queen, as
the most popular dancer, and falls
in love with Amber's ex-beau in
fine schlock-Hollywood style.
Tracy and Penny soon get into
trouble. When they meet Penny's
black boyfriend Link to dance at
a record store, Penny's paranoid
mother drags Penny home. But
Penny sneaks out and joins her
friends at a dance, where they
rally with black kids for integra
tion on the Corny Collins show,
which only lets blacks on the set
once a month for "Negro Day."
After the dance and an encoun
ter with an odd beatnik couple
(played by Rick Ocasek and Pia
Zadora), Penny is caught again
and put in a straitjacket, courtesy
of her mom. But the fight for
racial justice goes on without Pen
ny. The movie climaxes with a
riot at an amusement park and
a happy, integrated ending.
The acting in "Hairspray" is in
tentionally campy. The film
cleverly mocks B-movies by con
sciously being one.
But the oddball characters are
the movie's funniest feature.
Among them are Divine's joke
shop owner husband, Amber's
wilting-Ken-and-Barbie parents
(Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry),
rhythm and blues mama Motor
mouth Maybelle (Ruth Brown),
and the psychiatrist with his
electric cattle prod (Waters).
Sometimes Waters' mockery of
early '60s "culture" fits the '80s
like a chartreuse glove. For in
stance, there is an episode of the
Corny Collins show where young
children dress and dance like the
regular teen guests. It brings to
mind the recently-spawned game
shows on which post-Romper
Room contestants compete as
frantically as adults.
I hope you get to see
"Hairspray." Funny movies
abound, but only a few are
Divinely hilarious.

Stierlin Road at 101
Mountain View
Some movies should never have
been made, and, alas, "Stand and
Deliver" is such a movie. It is
based on the true story of an
heroic East Los Angeles high
school teacher who got a class of
unmotivated Hispanic students to
learn calculus, and pass the ad
vanced placement exam.
It's inspirational material and
the film is full of integrity (drip

ping with it!), but it should have
been born a documentary.
Though the filmmakers clearly
milked the material for all it was
worth, there just isn't enough
drama here for a riveting, involv
ing feature film. They should have
recognized this and let it go.
The story itself is quite power
ful, but there isn't much dramatic
tension to it. The bulk of the
movie consists of shots of Jaime
Escalante (Edward James Olmos),
a tired-looking middle-aged man
teaching his class math. There are
a lot of classroom jokes — some
funny, some not-so-funny — and
we're shown Escalante's admira
ble dedication and wry sense of
humor.
We get some flimsy scenes of
students grappling with social and
academic problems, but none of
this is sustained or moving. It's
all too loosely strung together,
and the film never takes off. It
has the feel of a documentary
without a documentary's pointed
ness and insight.
The high point of the film is
when the whole class passes the
A.P. exam and the Educational
Testing Service accuses them of
cheating, presumably because
they are Hispanic. The racist im
plications are interesting, but
never explored much, probably be
cause the film tries to stick to the
"truth." It's too bad they couldn't
have spiced it up a little with
some fabrication.
The class retakes the test, and
in the film's would-be tense
climax we get close-up shots of
equations on the exam as students
pencil in answers. This just isn't
highly dramatic or exciting, in
fact, it's unintentionally quite
comical. Desperately trying to
make drama where none exists —
this is the film's obvious and
repeated failure.
The actors perform brilliantly,
but their parts are shallow. It's
as though they are impersonating
figures in a documentary — there

isn't much color or scope to these
roles. Olmos is a pock-marked,
sagging Escalante — likeable, con
vincing and extremely homely.
Lou Diamond Phillips is the
good-hearted cholo in the class —
he's funnier here than in "La
Bamba." These two actors are in
top form; it's too bad they weren't
handed meatier roles.
"Stand and Deliver" tells an in
teresting story, but as a movie it
is only third rate. Fine acting and
good intentions are wasted in an
inherently undramatic film.

"Hairspray"
Blossom Hill
646 Blossom Hill
San Jose
John Waters, the veteran direc
tor of crude underground com
edies like "Polyester" and "Pink
Flamingos," has made racism the

theme of his new farce
"Hairspray."
Although this film features
Divine, the obese, recently
deceased transvestite star of
Waters' other movies who once
ate dog excrement on-screen, it
should appeal to mainstream
audiences. It isn't gross or grisly;
but it is grotesquely good.
The time is 1962. The Corny
Collins TV dance show is all the
rage with the youth of Baltimore,
including Tracy Turnblad and her
friend Penny. When Tracy sud
denly gets to dance on the show,
her life heats up.
Her mother, played by Divine,
at first thinks her "teen-age
Jezebel" daughter has gone too
far, but changes her mind when
show biz offers start pouring in
for the chubby rising star.
Stylishly decked out in
chartreuse from dressmaking
sponsor Mr. Pinky, Tracy rolls on

ward and upward. She displaces
Amber, the show's ice queen, as
the most popular dancer, and falls
in love with Amber's ex-beau in
fine schlock-Hollywood style.
Tracy and Penny soon get into
trouble. When they meet Penny's
black boyfriend Link to dance at
a record store, Penny's paranoid
mother drags Penny home. But
Penny sneaks out and joins her
friends at a dance, where they
rally with black kids for integra
tion on the Corny Collins show,
which only lets blacks on the set
once a month for "Negro Day."
After the dance and an encoun
ter with an odd beatnik couple
(played by Rick Ocasek and Pia
Zadora), Penny is caught again
and put in a straitjacket, courtesy
of her mom. But the fight for
racial justice goes on without Pen
ny. The movie climaxes with a
riot at an amusement park and
a happy, integrated ending.
The acting in "Hairspray" is in
tentionally campy. The film
cleverly mocks B-movies by con
sciously being one.
But the oddball characters are
the movie's funniest feature.
Among them are Divine's joke
shop owner husband, Amber's
wilting-Ken-and-Barbie parents
(Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry),
rhythm and blues mama Motor
mouth Maybelle (Ruth Brown),
and the psychiatrist with his
electric cattle prod (Waters).
Sometimes Waters' mockery of
early '60s "culture" fits the '80s
like a chartreuse glove. For in
stance, there is an episode of the
Corny Collins show where young
children dress and dance like the
regular teen guests. It brings to
mind the recently-spawned game
shows on which post-Romper
Room contestants compete as
frantically as adults.
I hope you get to see
"Hairspray." Funny movies
abound, but only a few are
Divinely hilarious.

"The Milagro Beanfield War"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at 101
Mountain View
"The Milagro Beanfield War" is
a corny American classic that only
Robert Redford could have made:
It has his unique sensibility and
humor. You'd have to be incred
ibly mean-spirited not to like this
film. It won't impress cinema
"snobs" because it isn't sophisti
cated, profound or disturbing, but
it's great stuff nonetheless: hokey,
charming, wry and wonderful.
The story is set in Milagro, New
Mexico, a beautiful rural town
where all the people are poor,
simple and happy. Life moves
slowly in this rustic wonderland,
the townspeople know what's im
portant. (Yes, it's implausible, but
what of it?)
A black cloud hovers on the
Disney horizon, however. A
greedy, overfed developer plans to
build a resort on the town's land,
which would destroy the commu
nity even more than it already
has been.
In a desperado attempt to revive
some of the town's traditional
ways, a local man, Joe Mon
dragon, illegally diverts water into
his defunct, parched beanfield,
thereby disrupting the develop
ment. Naturally this infuriates
the developers (who look like var
iations on J.R. Ewing) and they
begin the "war" to stop
Mondragon.
It's a battle we've seen before:
good, honest people fighting the
forces of development and big
business. But this isn't another
passionate, self-righteous and po
litical movie dramatizing a good
cause — this film has humor.
The whole show has the feel of
a weird fairy tale. Milagro is filled
with cute gnome-like old people
who resemble fairy tale dwarves.
There are a lot of quirky, silly
touches that give this film its dis
tinctive flavor, and lighten up

what could be a leaden political
message.
There's a large and colorful cast
of characters. The story flits from
one character to another, never
dwelling too long on anyone,
never losing its light touch. The
actors — many of them high
powered and successful — play
their slender roles with surprising
energy and humor.
Sonia Braga is the strong, de
termined woman who wants to
organize the town — for Braga
this is a small and unglamorous
role, but she plays it well.
Christopher Walken, a master
at playing the enigmatic, evil
character, is cast as the suave
troubleshooter sent in to demo
bilize Joe Mondragon. Walken is
more chilling, intriguing and
bizarre than ever here, with his
cowboy hat and oily Texas accent.
He improves every movie he ap
pears in, just by appearing in it.
This film won't hold up under
intense analysis; it's undeniably
simplistic, frequently silly, and its
fairy tale happy ending may make
you wince.
You can either roil your eyes
and disdain this sappy movie, or
you can get into its corny, good
hearted spirit, in which case you
will have a terrific time. This is
a warm, joyous movie, deftly made
and magically sentimental.

ate dog excrement on-screen, it
should appeal to mainstream
audiences. It isn't gross or grisly;
but it is grotesquely good.
The time is 1962. The Corny
Collins TV dance show is all the
rage with the youth of Baltimore,
including Tracy Turnblad and her
friend Penny. When Tracy sud
denly gets to dance on the show,
her life heats up.
Her mother, played by Divine,
at first thinks her "teen-age
Jezebel" daughter has gone too
far, but changes her mind when
show biz offers start pouring in
for the chubby rising star.
Stylishly decked out in
chartreuse from dressmaking
sponsor Mr. Pinky, Tracy rolls on

ward and upward. She displaces
Amber, the show's ice queen, as
the most popular dancer, and falls
in love with Amber's ex-beau in
fine schlock-Hollywood style.
Tracy and Penny soon get into
trouble. When they meet Penny's
black boyfriend Link to dance at
a record store, Penny's paranoid
mother drags Penny home. But
Penny sneaks out and joins her
friends at a dance, where they
rally with black kids for integra
tion on the Corny Collins show,
which only lets blacks on the set
once a month for "Negro Day."
After the dance and an encoun
ter with an odd beatnik couple
(played by Rick Ocasek and Pia
Zadora), Penny is caught again
and put in a straitjacket, courtesy
of her mom. But the fight for
racial justice goes on without Pen
ny. The movie climaxes with a
riot at an amusement park and
a happy, integrated ending.
The acting in "Hairspray" is in
tentionally campy. The film
cleverly mocks B-movies by con
sciously being one.
But the oddball characters are
the movie's funniest feature.
Among them are Divine's joke
shop owner husband, Amber's
wilting-Ken-and-Barbie parents
(Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry),
rhythm and blues mama Motor
mouth Maybelle (Ruth Brown),
and the psychiatrist with his
electric cattle prod (Waters).
Sometimes Waters' mockery of
early '60s "culture" fits the '80s
like a chartreuse glove. For in
stance, there is an episode of the
Corny Collins show where young
children dress and dance like the
regular teen guests. It brings to
mind the recently-spawned game
shows on which post-Romper
Room contestants compete as
frantically as adults.
I hope you get to see
"Hairspray." Funny movies
abound, but only a few are
Divinely hilarious.

"The Milagro Beanfield War"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at 101
Mountain View
"The Milagro Beanfield War" is
a corny American classic that only
Robert Redford could have made:
It has his unique sensibility and
humor. You'd have to be incred
ibly mean-spirited not to like this
film. It won't impress cinema
"snobs" because it isn't sophisti
cated, profound or disturbing, but
it's great stuff nonetheless: hokey,
charming, wry and wonderful.
The story is set in Milagro, New
Mexico, a beautiful rural town
where all the people are poor,
simple and happy. Life moves
slowly in this rustic wonderland,
the townspeople know what's im
portant. (Yes, it's implausible, but
what of it?)
A black cloud hovers on the
Disney horizon, however. A
greedy, overfed developer plans to
build a resort on the town's land,
which would destroy the commu
nity even more than it already
has been.
In a desperado attempt to revive
some of the town's traditional
ways, a local man, Joe Mon
dragon, illegally diverts water into
his defunct, parched beanfield,
thereby disrupting the develop
ment. Naturally this infuriates
the developers (who look like var
iations on J.R. Ewing) and they
begin the "war" to stop
Mondragon.
It's a battle we've seen before:
good, honest people fighting the
forces of development and big
business. But this isn't another
passionate, self-righteous and po
litical movie dramatizing a good
cause — this film has humor.
The whole show has the feel of
a weird fairy tale. Milagro is filled
with cute gnome-like old people
who resemble fairy tale dwarves.
There are a lot of quirky, silly
touches that give this film its dis
tinctive flavor, and lighten up

what could be a leaden political
message.
There's a large and colorful cast
of characters. The story flits from
one character to another, never
dwelling too long on anyone,
never losing its light touch. The
actors — many of them high
powered and successful — play
their slender roles with surprising
energy and humor.
Sonia Braga is the strong, de
termined woman who wants to
organize the town — for Braga
this is a small and unglamorous
role, but she plays it well.
Christopher Walken, a master
at playing the enigmatic, evil
character, is cast as the suave
troubleshooter sent in to demo
bilize Joe Mondragon. Walken is
more chilling, intriguing and
bizarre than ever here, with his
cowboy hat and oily Texas accent.
He improves every movie he ap
pears in, just by appearing in it.
This film won't hold up under
intense analysis; it's undeniably
simplistic, frequently silly, and its
fairy tale happy ending may make
you wince.
You can either roil your eyes
and disdain this sappy movie, or
you can get into its corny, good
hearted spirit, in which case you
will have a terrific time. This is
a warm, joyous movie, deftly made
and magically sentimental.

"Stand and Deliver"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at 101
Mountain View
Some movies should never have
been made, and, alas, "Stand and
Deliver" is such a movie. It is
based on the true story of an
heroic East Los Angeles high
school teacher who got a class of
unmotivated Hispanic students to
learn calculus, and pass the ad
vanced placement exam.
It's inspirational material and
the film is full of integrity (drip

ping with it!), but it should have
been born a documentary.
Though the filmmakers clearly
milked the material for all it was
worth, there just isn't enough
drama here for a riveting, involv
ing feature film. They should have
recognized this and let it go.
The story itself is quite power
ful, but there isn't much dramatic
tension to it. The bulk of the
movie consists of shots of Jaime
Escalante (Edward James Olmos),
a tired-looking middle-aged man
teaching his class math. There are
a lot of classroom jokes — some
funny, some not-so-funny — and
we're shown Escalante's admira
ble dedication and wry sense of
humor.
We get some flimsy scenes of
students grappling with social and
academic problems, but none of
this is sustained or moving. It's
all too loosely strung together,
and the film never takes off. It
has the feel of a documentary
without a documentary's pointed
ness and insight.
The high point of the film is
when the whole class passes the
A.P. exam and the Educational
Testing Service accuses them of
cheating, presumably because
they are Hispanic. The racist im
plications are interesting, but
never explored much, probably be
cause the film tries to stick to the
"truth." It's too bad they couldn't
have spiced it up a little with
some fabrication.
The class retakes the test, and
in the film's would-be tense
climax we get close-up shots of
equations on the exam as students
pencil in answers. This just isn't
highly dramatic or exciting, in
fact, it's unintentionally quite
comical. Desperately trying to
make drama where none exists —
this is the film's obvious and
repeated failure.
The actors perform brilliantly,
but their parts are shallow. It's
as though they are impersonating
figures in a documentary — there

isn't much color or scope to these
roles. Olmos is a pock-marked,
sagging Escalante — likeable, con
vincing and extremely homely.
Lou Diamond Phillips is the
good-hearted cholo in the class —
he's funnier here than in "La
Bamba." These two actors are in
top form; it's too bad they weren't
handed meatier roles.
"Stand and Deliver" tells an in
teresting story, but as a movie it
is only third rate. Fine acting and
good intentions are wasted in an
inherently undramatic film.

John Waters, the veteran direc

theme of his new farce
"Hairspray."
