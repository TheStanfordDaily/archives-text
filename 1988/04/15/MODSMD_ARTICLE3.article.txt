### Nick Anderson Editorial staff 
The die is cast.
Preliminary
results from the
ASSU Spring Elec
tion will be posted
today at 5 p.m. in
the front window

of the student union offices. Final
tallies will be available Monday.
Over 5,000 students cast a vote
in the election, up about 500 from
last year and totaling almost a
third of the student body. No of
ficial records are kept of past
years' voter turnouts, but by most
accounts this election generated
the highest turnout figures in
several years, Elections Commis
sioner Steve Baer said last night.
ASSU elections are notorious
for attracting those students who
vote simply to pick up an election
receipt in order to be eligible for
a fee refund the following year.
Baer said the heavier turnout
this year may be attributable to
the allure of the fee refund. Grad
uate students, who presumably
ask for more refunds because the
fees mainly benefit undergraduate
groups, came out in larger num
bers this year.
Baer said a letter mailing cam
paign to grad students had roused

The heavier turnout
this year may be at
tributable to the allure
of the fee refund.

interest in that bloc.
Another factor influencing the
turnout may have been party
politics, as distinct political fac
tions continued to coalesce for the
second year at the instigation of
the People's Platform party.
In the election, a minor
procedural controversy centered
around the new computerized
voting system. Baer said he
received "a few complaints" about
the ballot's two-page listing for
senate candidates.
Some charged that the format
was confusing and that candidates
on the second page were ignored
by voters.
Baer discounted those claims
and pointed to the random alpha
betical listing of the candidates
and the large box on the first
page saying, in large lettering,
"Go to next page" as proof that
voters should be able to decipher
the listing.
No investigation of the matter
will be pursued, Baer said.
