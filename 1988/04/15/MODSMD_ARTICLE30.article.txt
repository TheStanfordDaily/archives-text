## Paulsen streaks — will Card? Shortstop takes 18-game skein into crucial series with UCLA 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Baseball shortstops tradition
ally are an elegant, smooth, flashy
breed.
But Stanford shortstop Troy
Paulsen is different. He's stocky
and gritty, a no-nonsense, brass
tacks kind of pteyer. Paulsen
won't be doing backflips any time
soon.
And Paulsen is different from
the prototypical shortstop in an
other important way: He hits the
ball. Often.
In fact, the 6-foot sophomore
from Fountain Valley has hit
safely in 26 of his last 27 games
and his last 18 games in a row.
He's batting .363 on the season
and .395 in Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division play, and leads
the team in doubles with 12.
When the Cardinal (26-13 over
all, 10-7 in Six-Pac play) begins
a four-game road trip at 7 tonight
at UCIiA, Paulsen — as usual —
won't be thinking about his hit
ting streak much. In fact, he for
got all about it during a game
last weekend at Arizona, and only
remembered it when a teammate
reminded him.
"I'm aware of it," Paulsen said,
"But I haven't really put any ex
tra pressure on myself."
At the beginning of the season,
though, things were different.
Paulsen struggled with the bat.
"I was pressing a lot," he said. "I
was really pressing to do well."
But the fact that Paulsen was
in the lineup at ail at the begin
ning of this season was remark
able. He was the Cardinal's start

ing shortstop at the beginning of
last season, but was knocked out
for the season Feb. 21 by a knee
injury.
He suffered exensive ligament
and cartilage damage to his left
knee and underwent complete
reconstructive knee surgery
March 21. Then, as he sat on the
sidelines healing, the Cardinal,
with senior David Esquer starting
in his place, went on to win the
College World Series.
"That was really frustrating,"
Paulsen said. "I was doing well
when I got hit, then I'm on
crutches watching the team go on
to win league and then the
title. ... I was really happy for
them, but I wanted to be there."
And he was determined to be
in the lineup this year, although
neither he nor his coach was sure
that he would make it back.
"When I was injured I was hit
ting really well," Paulsen said. "I
wasn't sure if I could hit well
again. ... I kind of had to prove
myself again."
"I thought it would take him
longer," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "I wasn't sure if
he would be able to come back
with the range and mobility to
play shortstop . . . that was a real
serious injury."
Paulsen spent the summer at
home, rehabilitating the knee and
working at a summer job. It was
the first time he hadn't played
baseball in the summer since
"before Little League."
"It was really weird not playing
baseball in the summer," he said.
Then when he was able to play
in the fall, he had problems. "I

struggled in fall baseball," he said.
"It took me a long time to get
back in the groove, especially with
groundballs. ... I was really rusty
. . . and I couldn't hit at all."
When the team traveled to
Taiwan early last December to
represent the United States in an
international tournament, Paul
sen's troubles continued. "I think
I was 4-for-29 in Taiwan, and
struck out about nine times," he
said. "I was so frustrated . . . but
my teammates just kept telling
me, 'You're OK, you'll be there.'
And Marquess thinks the trip
to Taiwan was the turning point
in Paulsen's comeback. "Taiwan
was good for him, because there
wasn't a lot of pressure, and he
proved to himself that the leg was
all right," Marquess said.
Paulsen, however, didn't start
feeling comfortable until the Car
dinal's series in Hawaii in Febru
ary. "The Hawaii series turned it
around," he said. "I started to get
really confident . . . but I still
wanted to prove that I could hit
well in league — I didn't want to
just hit well on Tuesday (in non
league games) and then flail on
the weekends."
Paulsen has done very little
flailing on recent weekends. In
the Cardinal's last 27 games, he
is 49-for-125 (.392), with 23 RBI
and 32 runs.
"He's really been on a tear,"
Marquess said.
"I just started relaxing," Paul
sen said. "And I started going to
the field early, getting in some
extra hacks and getting help from
the coaches."
Paulsen's offensive production

tends to overshadow his defense,
which has been solid as a rock.
"I've been unbelievably pleased
with his defense," Marquess said.
"He's been playing as steady a
shortstop as we have had here.. ..
He's not as flashy as some of the
people we've had at short, but he
makes all the routine plays — you
don't want someone who makes
the spectacular play and boots the
easy ones."
And Paulsen has done all this
while wearing a heavy metal brace
on his knee. "I'm really comfort
able with it," Paulsen said of the
brace. "The only time I think
about it is when it starts slipping
down my leg and I have to pull
it up."
But he said that if he could, he
would gladly abandon the brace.
"Actually, I'm really sick of it,"
he said. "But I went to the doctor
this week and he said it's some
thing I'll have to wear for quite
a while longer. ... It sounds like
I'll have to wear it forever.
"The knee's OK taking
grounders and batting, but the
starting and stopping stuff is dan
gerous — it could blow again."
Paulsen, however, isn't living
in fear of re-injuring his knee —
he's too busy working and taking
his hacks and planning for the
future.
"I want to play pro baseball
bad," he said. "I know the injury
slowed me down a little bit, but
I just want a chance."

The Cardinal then plays USC at 1
p.m. Monday at Dedeaux Field in a
make-up of a game that was rained
out earlier this season.
All four games will be braodcast
live on KZSU-90.1 FM, with the
redoubtable John Platz and the in

record, a half game behind co-leaders
California and ASU, both 11-7. USC
is in fourth with a 9-8 record, and
UCLA is in fifth with a 7-10 confer

the rear at 4-13.
In other league series this weekend,
ASU and California do battle in

nia. "This is a big weekend,"
Marquess said.
Senior Lee Plcmel (5-5, 5.04) will

defeat of USF on Tuesday. Keyser did
throw three inings in the game, but
Robbie Kamcrschen started and re
corded the victory, improving his
season record to 4-0.
