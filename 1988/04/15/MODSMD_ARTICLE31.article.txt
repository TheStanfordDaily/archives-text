# A 						'Classic' case of crew competition
## 
### Don Hogue Staff writer 
The third annual
Redwood Shores/
Stanford Rowing
Classic at Redwood
Shores should
truly live up to its
hillincr as a "clas-

sic." This weekend's regatta will
feature eight of the nation's top
men's and women's collegiate
crews in head-to-head competition
Saturday and Sunday.
Crew afficioados take note —
the event has already been fea
tured on television's PM Maga
zine and Bay Area Backroads as
well as on local news coverage.
The New York Times, Seattle
Times and possibly Sports Il
lustrated will also be on hand to
capture the two-day event.
"Next to the (national) cham
pionship regatta in Cincinnati,
this is the most important rowing
event in the nation," said UCIiA
Men's Coach Zenon who
last year guided his crew to its
first Pacific 10 Conference title
in 17 years. "It will be a true
Qiew of the best crews from
the East Coast and the West
Coast."
The men's field is highlighted
by Harvard, the defending na
tional champion; Brown, runner

up at nationals and Intercollegiate
Rowing Association (IRA) cham
pion; UCLA, defending Pacific
Coast champion; and Wisconsin,
third at nationals and second at
the IRA Championships. In addi
tion, each of the crews from Wash
ington, Penn, Stanford and Cali
fornia add considerable depth to
the lineup.
The women's field will be
equally competitive. The regatta
will feature Washington, the na
tional and Pacific Coast cham
pion; Yale, runner-up at both
Eastern Sprints and nationals;
and Radcliffe, defending Eastern
Sprints champion. Wisconsin,
UCLA, Brown, California or Stan
ford could emerge as regatta
champion.
"These particular teams will
undoubtedly have a number of
competitors who will eventually
be seen in the Olympic games,"
said Regatta Director Dick Lyon,
himself a two-time Olympian.
"This will be the finest rowing
regatta in the nation, based on
the fact it is being held so close
to the Olympic trials, and that it
features the nation's best crews."
As Regatta Director, Lyon will
be busy overseeing a number of
important functions: course prep
aration, timing systems, race
scheduling, judging, race start and
communication of race results.

Lyon also developed the regatta's
present format, in which each
crew will race three ♦imea during
the weekend. Tomorrow morn
ing's races will pit Eastern crews
against Western crews, with
matchups determined by a ran
dom draw, rather than a seeded
format.
"What differentiates this
regatta from a number of others,
is the fact that crews will battle
one-on-one in rigorous 2,000-
meter sprints," Lyon said, noting
that most regattas feature eight
boat races.
"Everybody will be at about the
same level of fatigue," said Yale
Coach Nat Case, whose women

finished second nationally last
year. "The format should provide
excellent racing."
Excellent racing is precisely the
reason for developing the present
format, noted Stanford Men's
Coach Ken Dreyfuss. "The week
end's champion emerges not only
as the fastest crew, but also the
one which can remain strong
through three grueling races,"
Dreyfuss said.
Jeff Urdan, an oartman and
1986 graduate of Stanford, has
helped organize much of the logis
tics of the regatta, including spon
sors for each of the crews.
"Each of the sponsors has com
mitted enough funding for all ex

penses of one or more of the crews
that competes at the regatta," Ur
dan said. He estimated that such
expenses average $7500 per crew
for air fare, lodging, meals and
officiating.
Sponsorship on the local and
national levels helped make the
Classic an attractive event for
East Coast crews.
"Many of the schools back East
have traditional schedules," Ur
dan said, noting rivalries such as
Harvard-Yale. "This year, a lot of
schools rearranged their
schedules to accomodate this
regatta."
Another logistical problem for
Regatta organizers is providing

racing shells for the East Coast
crews. Several local crews have
arranged to lend shells to the
Eastern crews. Assisting Stanford
and California, Washington and
Orange Coast College have
trucked additional racing shells to
the regatta. The situation, how
ever, does create a few anxious
moments for coaches to rig the
boats according to the crewa'
needs.
First heats will begin Saturday
at 8 a.m. and continue until 11:30
a.m. Afternoon heats will con
tinue from 2 p.m. until 5:30 p.m.
The regatta will conclude Sunday,
with final heats scheduled from
8:30 a.m. until 11:00 a.m.
