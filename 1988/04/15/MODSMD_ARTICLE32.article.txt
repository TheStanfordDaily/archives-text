# Gymnasts 4th
## Eliminated from NCAA finals 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
LINCOLN,
Nebr. — The
Stanford men's
gymnastics
team fell short
of its quest for
an NCAA title,

finishing fourth in last night's
team preliminaries, two points
away from qualifying for
tonight's team finals.
Tough judging, too many
minor errors, and the superior
performance of the top-three
finishers left the Cardinal
short of its dream and very
disappointed. Nebraska
(286.65), Illinois (285.70) and
UCLA (285.25) advanced to
tonight's meet at the Devaney
Sports Center in Lincoln, Nebr.
"We messed up on one
event," senior Chuck Gerardo
said. "We looked great before
that and after that, but with
this kind of competition, I
guess one bad event is all it
took."
That one event, the only one
where Stanford performed
below its capability, was the
parallel bars. It had been the
Cardinal's second-best event all
season: Stanford scored a
school-record 48.60 on it a
month ago. However, the Car
dinal managed only a 47.25 on
it last night, thanks to four
poor landings off dismounts.
"I must say I am disap
pointed, even though the guys
performed just about max,"
Stanford Coach Sadao Hamada
said. "Parallel bars was the

only one where I really regret
we had so many misses. I think
we lost close to two points
there."
The Cardinal started the
meet on its worst event, the
pommel horse, and went into
the meet's second rotation far
back from the leaders. A superb
rings performance followed by
an adequate vault score
brought Stanford back toward
the top.
However, when they needed
elite scores from the remaining
three events, the Cardinal gym
nasts managed only to main
tain their position while Illinois
pulled away with clutch floor
and pommel-horse sets.
While Stanford only lived up
to its pre-meet seeding, eighth
ranked UCLA surprised, bol
ting up to a third-place finish.
Third-seeded Oklahoma
dropped back into the pack,
three points behind Stanford.
To Gerardo, "it seemed like
[Stanford] fell short on a lot
of things. Stanford was only
good, in a meet where only
great was good enough."
For three Cardinal gym
nasts, the season is not yet
over. In Saturday night's indi
vidual event finals, senior co
captain Mike Matzek will com
pete on the high bar and rings,
qualifying last night with a 9.9
on the latter. Senior Randy Be
sosa advanced on the rings and
in the parallel bars with scores
of 9.75 on each. And sopho
more Conrad Voorsanger
turned in a 9.9 on the parallel
bars, to advance to that event's
finals.
