# Card track hosts its own 'Classic'
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
There's been just
one philosophy for
the Stanford track
and field team this
season — to pre
pare for the Pacific
10 Conference

Championships.
Saturday, the Cardinal will
have that philosophy in mind as
it hosts Washington and Notre
Dame in the Stanford Track Clas
sic. And with 19 team members
already qualified, the team can
easily pick up the two more that
it needs to match last year's
season total.
The meet will be primarily a
matchup between Pac-10 rivals
Stanford and Washington, with
th* Notre Dame men's team also
competing. While the event will
not be scored as a dual meet, it
will offer the same strong com
peition that many of Stanford's
athletes will be competing against
at the Pac-10 and NCAA Cham
pionships.
Stanford will also be bringing
out their top seniors in the field,
as senior high jumpers Brian Mar
shall and Lisa Bernhagen will be
competing in their first home
meet of the year. Marshall will
be competing against Washing
ton's Rick Noji, who has cleared
seven feet, five inches. Both will

be going to the NCAA Champi
onship meet.
Stanford steamroller Patty Pur
pur will also meet worthy compe
tition from Pac-10 Conference
rival Washington in the shot put.
Third-ranked Purpur, a junior,
will meet conference leader Jen
nifer Ponath and runner-up Shir
ley Ross. The three will also fight
a closely contested battle in the
discus.
Senior Dave Pickett is leading
the conference in the javelin and
will face current runner-up Darryl
Roberson of Washington. Junior
Erica Wheeler, the top female
javelin thrower, is 10 feet ahead
of Washington's fourth-place
Shelly Sanford and should domi
nate that event.
Another top match-up is soph
omore Carol Gray in the 1,500
meters against Washington's
Sarah Blender and Mary Dong.
As with the other top contenders,
they all qualified for NCAAs, and
this matchup will serve as a
preview of the Pac-10 meet in
May.
In addition, there will be several
athletes trying to beat the 21 Pac
-10 qualifiers last year. Stanford
is considerably improved over last
year's disapointing 1987 confer
ence showing.
The men have accounted for 13
of the Pac-10 berths, and are

sic.
likely to take more. Among those
are Darrell Armstrong, a fresh
man, who is close to qualifying
in both the 100 meters and the
long jump. Senior Christian
Skoog, Stanford's top 800-meter
runner last year, has easily taken
the Pac-10 time in last weekends
winning two-mile relay at the
Texas Relays with a leg of 1:49.5,
and will be aiming for the NCAA
mark.
The men are also looking for
three 5,000-meter times under
the Pac-10 14:25 barrier. Senior
Steve Schadler, whp has made the
1,500 meters, ana junior James
Alborough are a few seconds away
while sophomore Mark Mastalir
hopes to join brother Eric in the
Pac-10 club. The team could easily
come away with a soild 5,000-

meter group to match a strong
pack of 1,500 meter runners.
Several team members are also
competing with a larger goal than
the college season: the 1988 Sum
mer Olympics in Seoul, South
Korea. Bernhagen jumped 6' 5"
indoors last year, destroying the
collegiate record with one of the
top jumps ever, and will be fight
ing to mark the top three at the
U.S. Olympic trials this summer.
Fifth-year senior Marc Oleson
and John Marshall will also be
shooting for Seoul, but as mem
bers of the Canadian national
team. Oelson is hoping to go un
der 3:40 in the 1,500 meters this
weekend to impress the Canadian
selection committee, and bypassed
some college meets to run up
North. Marshall must also be en
dorsed by the selection committee.
Stanford is looking strong this
season. The Stanford Track Clas
sic will be another opportunity to
sharpen its competitive edge.

season. The Stanford Track Clas
sic will be another opportunity to
sharpen its competitive edge.
There's been just
one philosophy for
the Stanford track
and field team this
season — to pre
pare for the Pacific
10 Conference

Championships.
Saturday, the Cardinal will
have that philosophy in mind as
it hosts Washington and Notre
Dame in the Stanford Track Clas
sic. And with 19 team members
already qualified, the team can
easily pick up the two more that
it needs to match last year's
season total.
The meet will be primarily a
matchup between Pac-10 rivals
Stanford and Washington, with
th* Notre Dame men's team also
competing. While the event will
not be scored as a dual meet, it
will offer the same strong com
peition that many of Stanford's
athletes will be competing against
at the Pac-10 and NCAA Cham
pionships.
Stanford will also be bringing
out their top seniors in the field,
as senior high jumpers Brian Mar
shall and Lisa Bernhagen will be
competing in their first home
meet of the year. Marshall will
be competing against Washing
ton's Rick Noji, who has cleared
seven feet, five inches. Both will

be going to the NCAA Champi
onship meet.
Stanford steamroller Patty Pur
pur will also meet worthy compe
tition from Pac-10 Conference
rival Washington in the shot put.
Third-ranked Purpur, a junior,
will meet conference leader Jen
nifer Ponath and runner-up Shir
ley Ross. The three will also fight
a closely contested battle in the
discus.
Senior Dave Pickett is leading
the conference in the javelin and
will face current runner-up Darryl
Roberson of Washington. Junior
Erica Wheeler, the top female
javelin thrower, is 10 feet ahead
of Washington's fourth-place
Shelly Sanford and should domi
nate that event.
Another top match-up is soph
omore Carol Gray in the 1,500
meters against Washington's
Sarah Blender and Mary Dong.
As with the other top contenders,
they all qualified for NCAAs, and
this matchup will serve as a
preview of the Pac-10 meet in
May.
In addition, there will be several
athletes trying to beat the 21 Pac
-10 qualifiers last year. Stanford
is considerably improved over last
year's disapointing 1987 confer
ence showing.
The men have accounted for 13
of the Pac-10 berths, and are

sic.
likely to take more. Among those
are Darrell Armstrong, a fresh
man, who is close to qualifying
in both the 100 meters and the
long jump. Senior Christian
Skoog, Stanford's top 800-meter
runner last year, has easily taken
the Pac-10 time in last weekends
winning two-mile relay at the
Texas Relays with a leg of 1:49.5,
and will be aiming for the NCAA
mark.
The men are also looking for
three 5,000-meter times under
the Pac-10 14:25 barrier. Senior
Steve Schadler, whp has made the
1,500 meters, ana junior James
Alborough are a few seconds away
while sophomore Mark Mastalir
hopes to join brother Eric in the
Pac-10 club. The team could easily
come away with a soild 5,000-

meter group to match a strong
pack of 1,500 meter runners.
Several team members are also
competing with a larger goal than
the college season: the 1988 Sum
mer Olympics in Seoul, South
Korea. Bernhagen jumped 6' 5"
indoors last year, destroying the
collegiate record with one of the
top jumps ever, and will be fight
ing to mark the top three at the
U.S. Olympic trials this summer.
Fifth-year senior Marc Oleson
and John Marshall will also be
shooting for Seoul, but as mem
bers of the Canadian national
team. Oelson is hoping to go un
der 3:40 in the 1,500 meters this
weekend to impress the Canadian
selection committee, and bypassed
some college meets to run up
North. Marshall must also be en
dorsed by the selection committee.
Stanford is looking strong this
season. The Stanford Track Clas
sic will be another opportunity to
sharpen its competitive edge.
