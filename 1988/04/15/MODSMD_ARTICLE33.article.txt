# Card track hosts its own 'Classic'
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
There's been just
one philosophy for
the Stanford track
and field team this
season — to pre
pare for the Pacific
10 Conference

Championships.
Saturday, the Cardinal will
have that philosophy in mind as
it hosts Washington and Notre
Dame in the Stanford Track Clas
sic. And with 19 team members
already qualified, the team can
easily pick up the two more that
it needs to match last year's
season total.
The meet will be primarily a
matchup between Pac-10 rivals
Stanford and Washington, with
th* Notre Dame men's team also
competing. While the event will
not be scored as a dual meet, it
will offer the same strong com
peition that many of Stanford's
athletes will be competing against
at the Pac-10 and NCAA Cham
pionships.
Stanford will also be bringing
out their top seniors in the field,
as senior high jumpers Brian Mar
shall and Lisa Bernhagen will be
competing in their first home
meet of the year. Marshall will
be competing against Washing
ton's Rick Noji, who has cleared
seven feet, five inches. Both will

be going to the NCAA Champi
onship meet.
Stanford steamroller Patty Pur
pur will also meet worthy compe
tition from Pac-10 Conference
rival Washington in the shot put.
Third-ranked Purpur, a junior,
will meet conference leader Jen
nifer Ponath and runner-up Shir
ley Ross. The three will also fight
a closely contested battle in the
discus.
Senior Dave Pickett is leading
the conference in the javelin and
will face current runner-up Darryl
Roberson of Washington. Junior
Erica Wheeler, the top female
javelin thrower, is 10 feet ahead
of Washington's fourth-place
Shelly Sanford and should domi
nate that event.
Another top match-up is soph
omore Carol Gray in the 1,500
meters against Washington's
Sarah Blender and Mary Dong.
As with the other top contenders,
they all qualified for NCAAs, and
this matchup will serve as a
preview of the Pac-10 meet in
May.
In addition, there will be several
athletes trying to beat the 21 Pac
-10 qualifiers last year. Stanford
is considerably improved over last
year's disapointing 1987 confer
ence showing.
The men have accounted for 13
of the Pac-10 berths, and are
