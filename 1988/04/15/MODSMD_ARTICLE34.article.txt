# Bears beat golfers
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
In the words of
Stanford Coach
Wally Goodwin,
the men's golf
team did not lose
to California yes
terday in their first

dual match, they were beaten.
"The difference is that when
you lose, you did it,"he said.
"When you get beaten. They did
it."
The Cardinal turned in some
very fine scores yesterday at the
Orinda Golf Club, but the Cal
golfers, playing on their home
course, were able to scramble for
a narrow victory in the old "col
lege duel" format.
Stanford lost by one point in
the match play format, in which
each player's match was worth
three points. In addition, each
foursome of two Stanford and two
Cal golfers had a best-ball match
going for three points, making the
tournament worth 27 points al
together.
To add insult to injury, in
stroke play, the Stanford team
total was merely one stroke worse
than that of the Bears.
"We played OK today," Good
win said. In fact, the finest round
for the team this year was re
corded by sophomore Mark Fun
seth, who turned in a three
under-par 69 on his score card.
His nearest competition from Cal
could only manage a 72.

The rest of the team backed
Funseth quite well. Sophomores
Brad Benbrook and Brad Joon
deph carded 755, while junior
John Mahon and sophomore Josh
Zander each shot 76. Goodwin
was quite pleased.
"The mark of good players are
those who can go into a course,
sight unseen and shoot 75 or 76,"
he said.
Funseth said that he played
particularly well at Orinda be
cause the course was so short and
because he putted very well. "You
didn't really need to use the
driver," he said. "The holes were
so short that the temptation
wasn't even there. That was good
because the driver is what has
been giving me trouble lately."
What the Cardinal wanted more
than a victory against Cal was a
look at Cal's home course, where
the Pacific-10 Conference Cham
pionship will be played in two
weeks.
"After seeing the course today,
I am more enthusiastic about our
chances in the Pac-10," Goodwin
said. "I came away thinking that
the course could be a neutralizer
for us. It is so short that you hit
3-woods off the tees and 9-irons
into the greens, which is what
our guys do well."
Funseth agreed, although he
thinks the course will play a lot
tougher for the Pac-lOs. "They'll
probably harden the greens and
make the pin placements much
more difficult," he predicted.
