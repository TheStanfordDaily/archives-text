# Stanford tennis squares off with UCLA, USC
## Expect the unexpected in women's matches 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Nobody seems to know what to ex
pect this weekend when fourth
ranked UCLA and third-ranked USC
visit the Stanford Tennis Stadium to
take on No. 2 Stanford.
The Cardinal whipped the Trojans
7-1 and knocked off the Bruins 6-3

three weeks ago in Los Angeles. But neither USC
nor UCLA was anywhere near their best in those
matches.
The Trojans wem in the middle of an exam period
and looked "flat as a pancake," according to Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan. And the Bruins had only
five healthy players and had to default two of the
matches.
So will the Cardinal be up against much tougher
versions of UCLA and USC this weekend? Well,
maybe. And maybe not. Both struggled last weekend
in Arizona, the Bruins losing 5-3 to Arizona State
and the Trojans falling 5-4 to Arizona.
UCLA and USC aren't the only teams that come
into this weekend with some question marks. Stan
ford will be playing with an untested No. 3 doubles
team.
Senior Cari Hagey, who normally teams with
freshman Sandra Birch in the No. 1 position, is
still nursing a sore right shoulder and will be
replaced by junior Cindy Buchsbaum in doubles.
Birch and Buchsbaum will play No. 3, with the
other two doubles teams moving up a notch.
UCLA, here today for a 1:30 p.m. match, is 16-4.
The Bruins have been plagued by iryuries all season,
but they apparently are approaching full strength.
Ail-American Joni Urban has missed the last month
of the season, but she will reportedly play this
afternoon.
The Cardinal has beaten the Bruins twice already
this season, although the score of the last match
was a narrow 4-3 excluding the defaults. Brennan
said his team is confident. "You always feel that
way after you beat a team twice," he said. "But
the personnel has changed."

Even if UCLA has all of its players available
today, Brennan feels the Cardinal should fare well.
"Frankly, I don't see us as being any worse than
4-2 (after singles)," he said. "That would leave us
needing one doubles, and I think we can do that."
USC, 15-3, plays here tomorrow at 1 p.m. The
Trojans have been blown out only one this season,
and that came at the hands of the Cardinal. Is the
Cardinal expecting another easy match tomorrow?
"I think actually just the opposite," Buchsbaum
said. "We're going to think, we beat them so badly
they must not have played their best. We're not
sure what their best is."
Brennan said the Trojans' performance in the
last match was probably not indicative of their
ability. "We told them (the Stanford players) after
the match, hey, this was a little unusual," Brennan
said.
"Now, having said that, then they lose to Arizo
na," he added. "So maybe they are not up to their
usual strength. We'll find out."
The best contest tomorrow could be the No. 1
singles, where Cardinal freshman Tami Whitlinger
will be pitted against Trojan freshman Trisha Laux.
Both are ranked in the top 10 in the nation, and
they have split two previous matches this season.
The loss of Hagey in doubles combined with the
strength of the opponents mean that Stanford will
need to maintain its impeccable singles play this
weekend. "Everyone just has a little more pressure
to really play well," senior Kay Tittle said. "We
can't afford any loose matches."
There will be added pressure on Buchsbaum, who
will be in the troublesome No. 6 singles position.
Buchsbaum said she has recovered physically from
the broken collarbone she suffered at the beginning
of the year, but her game is not back to where it
was prior to the injury.
"It's definitely a challenge to get back into it,"
Buchsbaum said.
"We haven't proven that the No. 6 spot can do
anything yet," Brennan said. "Cindy's a good tennis
player. She has to relax and let her talent flow. If

she just goes out there and feels
confident, she'll be fine."
If this weekend's matches are
decided in the doubles, Brennan
doesn't know quite what to expect
with Birch and Buchsbaum form
ing a new team and the other
teams having to move up.
"Our two team (Tami and Teri
Whitlinger) was like money in the
bank at two," he said. "Hopefully
thej 'll be money in the bank at
one."
Birch and Buchsbaum have
practiced only twice this week, but

Buchsbaum sees the potential for
a solid team. "It's just a matter
of getting some matches to
gether," she said. "Sandra's a
great doubles player. She could
play well with anybody."
"I'm keeping my fingers crossed
that they'll be able to put some
thing together," Brennan said of
Birch and Buchsbaum. Like
Buchsbaum, he feels that the new
pair is capable of playing well to
gether. "Sandra is an excellent
doubles player, (and) Cindy is a
good doubles player. Good doubles
players tend to work things out
quickly."
Both of this weekend's matches
will be free for students with
Stanford identification.

Whitlinger) was like money in the
bank at two," he said. "Hopefully
thej 'll be money in the bank at
one."
Birch and Buchsbaum have
practiced only twice this week, but

Buchsbaum sees the potential for
a solid team. "It's just a matter
of getting some matches to
gether," she said. "Sandra's a
great doubles player. She could
play well with anybody."
"I'm keeping my fingers crossed
that they'll be able to put some
thing together," Brennan said of
Birch and Buchsbaum. Like
Buchsbaum, he feels that the new
pair is capable of playing well to
gether. "Sandra is an excellent
doubles player, (and) Cindy is a
good doubles player. Good doubles
players tend to work things out
quickly."
Both of this weekend's matches
will be free for students with
Stanford identification.
Nobody seems to know what to ex
pect this weekend when fourth
ranked UCLA and third-ranked USC
visit the Stanford Tennis Stadium to
take on No. 2 Stanford.
The Cardinal whipped the Trojans
7-1 and knocked off the Bruins 6-3

three weeks ago in Los Angeles. But neither USC
nor UCLA was anywhere near their best in those
matches.
The Trojans wem in the middle of an exam period
and looked "flat as a pancake," according to Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan. And the Bruins had only
five healthy players and had to default two of the
matches.
So will the Cardinal be up against much tougher
versions of UCLA and USC this weekend? Well,
maybe. And maybe not. Both struggled last weekend
in Arizona, the Bruins losing 5-3 to Arizona State
and the Trojans falling 5-4 to Arizona.
UCLA and USC aren't the only teams that come
into this weekend with some question marks. Stan
ford will be playing with an untested No. 3 doubles
team.
Senior Cari Hagey, who normally teams with
freshman Sandra Birch in the No. 1 position, is
still nursing a sore right shoulder and will be
replaced by junior Cindy Buchsbaum in doubles.
Birch and Buchsbaum will play No. 3, with the
other two doubles teams moving up a notch.
UCLA, here today for a 1:30 p.m. match, is 16-4.
The Bruins have been plagued by iryuries all season,
but they apparently are approaching full strength.
Ail-American Joni Urban has missed the last month
of the season, but she will reportedly play this
afternoon.
The Cardinal has beaten the Bruins twice already
this season, although the score of the last match
was a narrow 4-3 excluding the defaults. Brennan
said his team is confident. "You always feel that
way after you beat a team twice," he said. "But
the personnel has changed."

Even if UCLA has all of its players available
today, Brennan feels the Cardinal should fare well.
"Frankly, I don't see us as being any worse than
4-2 (after singles)," he said. "That would leave us
needing one doubles, and I think we can do that."
USC, 15-3, plays here tomorrow at 1 p.m. The
Trojans have been blown out only one this season,
and that came at the hands of the Cardinal. Is the
Cardinal expecting another easy match tomorrow?
"I think actually just the opposite," Buchsbaum
said. "We're going to think, we beat them so badly
they must not have played their best. We're not
sure what their best is."
Brennan said the Trojans' performance in the
last match was probably not indicative of their
ability. "We told them (the Stanford players) after
the match, hey, this was a little unusual," Brennan
said.
"Now, having said that, then they lose to Arizo
na," he added. "So maybe they are not up to their
usual strength. We'll find out."
The best contest tomorrow could be the No. 1
singles, where Cardinal freshman Tami Whitlinger
will be pitted against Trojan freshman Trisha Laux.
Both are ranked in the top 10 in the nation, and
they have split two previous matches this season.
The loss of Hagey in doubles combined with the
strength of the opponents mean that Stanford will
need to maintain its impeccable singles play this
weekend. "Everyone just has a little more pressure
to really play well," senior Kay Tittle said. "We
can't afford any loose matches."
There will be added pressure on Buchsbaum, who
will be in the troublesome No. 6 singles position.
Buchsbaum said she has recovered physically from
the broken collarbone she suffered at the beginning
of the year, but her game is not back to where it
was prior to the injury.
"It's definitely a challenge to get back into it,"
Buchsbaum said.
"We haven't proven that the No. 6 spot can do
anything yet," Brennan said. "Cindy's a good tennis
player. She has to relax and let her talent flow. If

she just goes out there and feels
confident, she'll be fine."
If this weekend's matches are
decided in the doubles, Brennan
doesn't know quite what to expect
with Birch and Buchsbaum form
ing a new team and the other
teams having to move up.
