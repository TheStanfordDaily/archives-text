### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
In its final mqjor test of
the season, the Stanford
men's tennis team
battles rivals USC today
and UCLA tomorrow in
Los Angeles.
At Stanford Tennis

Stadium, the Cardinal bested UCLA 6-3
April 1 and USC 6-3 April 2, but playing
back-to-back contests before tough
home crowds will make two more
notches on Stanford's victory belt
harder to come by.
"This weekend will be a real challenge
for us," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
"We have to plav to win and not protect
anything. It will take a good effort to
beat us, but before a real vocal crowd
those teams are capable of beating us."

Today's match could preview the
NCAA final round. The top-rated Car
dinal, 18-1, and No. 3 USC, 21-3, have
alternated between the nation's top
three spots (along with Louisiana State)
all season long.
Stanford, spurred by the singles play
of freshman David Wheaton and con
sistent doubles tandems, has won 12
straight matches since bowing to USC
in Februrary.
"I think everyone is playing pretty
well," senior Patrick McEnroe said. "It
will be tough to win both matches down
there, but the guys are playing well
enough that we nave a good shot."
Like the Cardinal, the Trojans enter
the contest a confident team. Since
bowing to the Cardinal, USC has
trounced sixth-rated UC-Irvine 5-2 and
UCLA 5-1.
In singles play, Trojan senior Scott

Melville has defeated McEnroe,
Wheaton and sophomore Jeff Tarango
this season as a dominant No. 1 player.
Senior Jonas Wallgard, out of the USC
lineup for much of the season, is healthy
and penciled in as a singles and doubles
starter.
In addition, under coach Dick Leach,
USC has lost but six home matches in
eight years.
"In my eight years here, our home
record has been pretty good," Leach
said. "It's certainly an advantage.
UCLA, ranked ninth with a 15-6
record, figures to be the easier of the
two Cardinal opponents, but gave Stan
ford a tough go the last time the two
teams met.
Sophomore Brian Garrow beat
Wheaton, junior Buff Farrow upended
McEnroe and freshman Jason Netter
