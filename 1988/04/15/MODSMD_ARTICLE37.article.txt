There's no place
like home. Just ask
the men's volley
ball team, which
begins its final
home stand of the
season tomorrow

night against No. 5 Pepperdine
at 7:30 p.m.
The Cardinal spikers, who enter
the match with a 10-17 record
(4-11 in the Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association)
have played five of their last six
contests on the road (losing all
six) and have not won since March
3. The matchup against Pepper
dine (12-12, 8-8) is the first of
three straight home dates for the
Cardinal, which closes out the
season next weekend against Long
Beach State and San Diego State.
Playing at home will be a wel
come relief for the road-weary
Stanford squad. "A lot of the
teams in the league are so close,
the home-court advantage really
becomes a large factor," Stanford
Asst. Coach Ruben Nieves said.
"Coming home, we feel we have
an excellent chance of beating
Pepperdine."
The Cardinal, currently mired
in a seven-match slump, is looking
to play the role of spoiler against
the Waves, who are involved in a
three-team battle for the final

out and show what we
can do.'

conference berth in the NCAA
District 8 Regionals.
Only five teams from the WIVA
are allowed to qualify for the
Regionals each year, and Pepper
dine is in fifth place at 8-8, with
Cal State-Northridge (7-9) and
the 49ers (6-8) both one game
back.
A postseason appearance for
Stanford, however, will have to
wait until next year, as the team
has been mathematically elimi
nated from the playoffs for the
first time in four years. The team
is looking to avenge a 15-10, 15-7,
15-13 March 25 loss at Pepper
dine that, according to Nieves,
was much closer than the score
indicated.
"That (road trip) was a rough
stretch for the team," Nieves said.
"We'd lost a few matches, had
just made a lineup change —
shifting outside hitter Craig For
syth to middle blocker and bring
ing in Mark Amstutz to start —
and we still were able to play a
pretty darned good match.
"We're not competing for the
playoffs anymore, but we still
want to go out and show what
we can do."
