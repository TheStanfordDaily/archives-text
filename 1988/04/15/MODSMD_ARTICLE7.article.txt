# Cowell AIDS testing assailed
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Cowell Student Health Center has
been guilty of "gross incompetence" in
its implementation of an AIDS antibody
testing program, according to the direc
tor of the AIDS Education Project here
who has been pressuring the center to
change its system for nearly seven
months.
AEP Director Daniel Bao maintains
that Cowell should contact everyone
who tested negative for antibodies to
the human immunodeficiency virus at
Cowell between February and October
of last year to counsel them about ho\v
to interpret the results. The fact that
none of these people received post-test
counseling, along with other problems
with AIDS testing at Cowell, "could
jeopardize people's lives," Bao said.
However, Dr. Paul Walters, director
of Cowell, said an attempt to contact
those tested prior to last October would
create both ethical and legal problems
by threatening the confidentiality of the
patients' identities.
Although people are now receiving
both pre- and post-test counseling at
Cowell, when the health center began
its HIV testing program in February
1987 there was no post-test counseling
for those who tested negative.
AIDS specialists across the country
have established counseling's impor
tance for all who are tested for an
tibodies to HIV.
Bao strongly advocates counseling be
cause he believes many people do not
understand that a negative test for an
tibodies to the AIDS virus is not a guar
antee of a clean bill of health. A recent
infection might not show up on a test
because of the delay — which may be

as long as six months — between the
time of exposure to the virus and the
development of antibodies.
But "the possible harm of attempting
such contact would outweigh the
benefits," Walters said. "I am very un
comfortable about compiling any sort
of list of those who have been tested,
and sending out letters would compro
mise confidentiality, since you don't
know who will be opening them."
Bao, who has been trying unsuccess
fully for the last seven months to con
vince Cowell to contact all those who
never received counseling, said he was
angry with Walter's decision. "I'm even
more uncomfortable with people killing

themselves and others" as a result of
the decision, he said.
"It's possible people could have en
gaged in risky behavior" after receiving
a false negative test result, he said.
Bao said he discovered Cowell was
not counseling people after their tests
last October, and he said that as a result
of his complaints, proper counseling was
implemented.
Aside from the counseling problem,
Bao listed numerous other defects in
Cowell's program, including poorly
worded release forms, "factually incor
rect" protocols for testing, and the lack
of anonymity for test records.
According to Walters, who ad
mitted that the release forms were
poorly written, the protocols and
release forms were supplied by a
testing lab and have subsequently
been rewritten.
But Bao said Cowell "shouldn't
have allowed them to be used. It's
like using a racially slurred book
in a class and then saying you
didn't write it as a defense."
Bao also criticized Cowell for
not providing anonymous testing.
Cowell's AIDS antibody tests

are considered "confidential," but
are not classified as "anonymous
testing procedures," as are those
at county facilities. Anonymous
tests never require the name of
the patient to be given, but rely
instead on a numbering system
to process and distribute results.
Under Cowell's system the
results of AIDS tests are kept in
patients' confidential files, which
conceivably could be released un
der certain circumstances, Bao
said.
Walters advised that students
who want anonymous tests
should go to a county facility in
stead of Cowell. To date, about
200 people have been tested with
Cowell's help.
