# AIDS study targets colleges
## 
### Jeff Album Staff writer 
A controversial proposal by the Sur
geon General last February for man
datory AIDS testing has been molded
into a new plan more likely to yield
useful data about the frequency of
the AIDS virus among students.
Many civil rights activists criticized
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's
original plan because they felt it would
infringe on students' basic rights by
compelling them to participate and be
identified in the testing.
Senior Daniel Bao, director of the
Stanford AIDS Education Project, op
posed the original plan, but said he
is "basically satisfied" with the ap
proach of the new study.
"It would give us good data," he

said.
The U.S. Public Health Service's
Center for Disease Control has the
responsibility for implementing the
Surgeon General's recommendations
for health studies.
The new plan, which calls for test
ing of blood samples submitted
anonymously at over 20 universities
nationwide, also met with approval
yesterday from Paul Walters, director
of Cowell Student Health Center and
the person responsible for conducting
AIDS testing on campus.
In his original plan, Koop had pro
posed unprecedented mandatory test
ing of every college student at an un
specified college or university. The
reliability of information collected
from one geographical location
was also called into question.
"I think the Surgeon General
spoke out of turn," Walters said
of Koop's proposed study. "There
was no way for that plan to be
put into effect."
Walters refused to comment in
February on the original proposal.
In the new plan, donors' iden
tities would remain anonymous.
The study, to be conducted by the
American College Health Associ
ation for the Health Service, is
awaiting final approval from the
Health Service. "
Walters said Stanford would
not participate because, as one of
only a few private universities in
the San Francisco area, it would
be impossible to protect the
school's anonymity once results
of the study were released.
Once the study is completed,
statistics will be given by region
and distinctions will be made be

tween public and private univer
sities.
"I don't think any institution
wants to be compared on that
basis," said Walters, who added
that Stanford's diverse student
population would also not give
good regional information on who
is infected.
Richard Keeling, who heads the

national College Health Associa
tion's AIDS task force, said the
new study is expected to provide
crucial "baseline" information
about who is carrying the ac
quired immune deficiency syn
ome among college-age people in
different regions.
He said the study would be rela
tively inexpensive because it

would use blood samples that
have been taken for other unre
lated medical reasons. Keeling
added that the study is intended
to provide information and re
search rather than to alert indi
viduals if they are carriers of HIV.
People who develop antibodies
to HIV, or human immuno
deficiency virus, usually go on to
develop AIDS.
One aspect of the new study
that appeals to some AIDS ac
tivists is that participating uni
versities, whose names would not
be revealed by the Health Service,
are required to provide confiden
tial testing for Students who want
it, and to accompany their testing
with both pre- and post-test coun
seling sessions.
Doug Conaway, coordinator of
the College Health Association's
AIDS project, said in addition to
requirements for confidential
testing and counseling services,
institutions asked to participate
will be Chosen because their
health services routinely collect
1,000 or more blood samples over
short time periods.


Senior Daniel
Bao, director of the
Stanford AIDS Edu
cation Project, op
posed the original
plan but said the
new plan 'would
give us good data.'
