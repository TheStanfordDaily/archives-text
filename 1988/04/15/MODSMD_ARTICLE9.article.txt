# Honors may cost students more
## 
### Jennifer Schmid 
Students living on campus who wish
to write honor theses may find that,
along with the additional academic bur
den, they could end up paying more for
their undergraduate degrees.
However, a loophole also exists in the
current system that permits off-campus
students to avoid paying the extra fees.
Students who finish their mtyor re
quirements but wish to remain on
campus for an additional quarter as
non-registered students in order to
write honor theses must each pay a
$970 auditing fee.
This fee is charged to these students
above their housing costs, if they are
not taking any additional units and have
finished all the research. According to
Registrar Sally Mahoney, the auditing
fee covers many University resources
such as access to athletic fields and
libraries, as well as Cowell Health Serv
ices.
All non-registered students must pe
tition for campus housing. The petition
requires students to state whether they
are working on an honors thesis, and
if they are, the University charges a fee
about one-third of regular tuition per
quarter.
If students move off-campus, they can
avoid the auditing fee, simply because
the Registrar's Office has no way of
knowing that the student is doing
honors work.
Graduating seniors who have finished
all coursework, but aren't writing
honors theses, can remain in campus

housing without paying any fees above
what they pay for housing, according
to University Housing Policy.
Instead of moving off campus to avoid
the charge, senior Cecilia Evangelista
said she decided to stay on campus and
try to "fight" a policy that she said is
unfair.
Evangelista, a political science
and a member of the Humanities
Honors program, said she wrote a letter
concerning the financial difference to
Dean of Undergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow. Such a policy "could make the
decision to write an honors thesis a
financial one," she wrote.
Evangelista said she had completed
all her requirements for graduation, and
could have graduated after winter quar
ter without honors. Because she had
completed all research needed for her
thesis, Evangelista said she feels the
fee is being unfairly applied simply be
cause she remains in University
housing.
Chair of Humanities Special Pro

grams Paul Robinson, who wrote a let
ter of support for Evangelista to Wasow,
said he feels the University's policy "is
counterproductive.... I think students
don't do enough individual work as it
is, and anything which discourages
honors work is senseless."
Wasow said he had received the letter,
which was written in December, but
turned the matter over to Mahoney be
cause he "has no jurisdiction over fees."
After alerting Mahoney, the fee was
discussed at a meeting of academic
deans.
Mahoney said those attending the
meeting, which included herself, Wasow
and University Provost James Rosse,
agreed to "look into the circumstances
under which students are being charged
auditing fees."
The group will meet again sometime
this quarter to discuss the fees, but
Mahoney said that "right now we are
still in an information-gathering mode."
English mtyor and senior Sarah Lau
chose to move off-campus in order to
avoid paying the auditing fee while she
finishes her honors thesis. Lau said she
was told the fee was levied because,
"people will be evaluating my work, and
I have to pay for that."
Lau, who received the Dean's Award
for Academic Achievement in March,
said she thinks it is ironic for the Uni
versity to have recognized her academic
achievement while it continued to put
up roadblocks at a time she considers
the "apex" of her academic work.
Calling the fee "a real disincen
tive to do honors," Lau, who is
living on campus with friends un
til she finds housing, said she
thought it "absurd" that if she

chose to drop her honors work,
she could move back on campus
with no complaints from the Uni
versity.
Evangelista said she is "penal
ized for wanting to do an honors
thesis. ... If I was staying on
campus spring quarter not doing
anything, I would not have had
to pay any fees."
