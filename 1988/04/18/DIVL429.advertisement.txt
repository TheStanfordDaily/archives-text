Peer Counseling
We are a group of students offering free and con
fidential peer counseling to anyone who wants to
call or drop by. We are volunteers who have com
pleted an intensive counseling training class and
evaluation and take continuing training. We are here
to explore feelings, to help sort out problems and un
certainties, or just to talk. Call us for any reason —
from venting anger or frustration to discussing prob
lems concerning school, sexuality, substances, lonli
ness, family, or relationships. We're here to listen.
We also offer an information and referral service; j
especially concerning counseling, health, and social
issues.
