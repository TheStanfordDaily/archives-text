# 'New Slate' is likely to chalk up COP victory
## 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
About 500 ballots are left to be
counted, but preliminary ASSU
Election results indicate that a
slim majority of students have
opted for a "new approach" to
governing the ASSU.
A New Slate of Mind appears
to have captured the Council of
Presidents post after a campaign
emphasizing that progressive
politics is needed to transform the
ASSU.
Preliminary results released
Friday gave the People's Platform
slate 1,905 votes — 252 ahead of
the The Energizers' 1,703 votes
— leaving the main prize in the
election undecided. The Ener
gizers will have to garner over
350 of the 500 uncounted votes
to overtake A New Slate of Mind.
Voting machines counted 4,468
ballots. The 500 uncounted bal
lots include at least one write-in
vote each and have to be hand
counted.
The total number of students
voting this Wednesday and Thurs
day — 4,968 — is the largest turn
out for an ASSU election in recent
years, Elections Commissioner
Steve Baer said. Last spring's gen
eral election drew 4,623 students.
Official results will be posted
some time today at the ASSU of
fice, Baer said. The write-in bal
lots are being counted by the
Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters, located in San Jose.
Although most of the ballots
have been counted, a number of
positions and fee assessments
remain up in the air.
Sophomore David Brown, a
member of A New Slate of Mind,
said he is "encouraged by the pre
liminary results" but will not
claim victory yet. "We're not call
ing it a victory in any way until
those other ballots are counted,"
he said.
Brown said the preliminary
results reflect "a very close race"
that forced students to decide "be
tween two very good slates."
Sophomore Sue Kown, a mem

ber of The Energizers, agreed that
her slate still retains a chance at
victory. "It can still go two ways,"
she said.
Kown said her slate was pin
ning its hopes on the possibility
that most of the write-in ballots
were for graduate senate posi
tions. If that is the case, Kown
said her slate has a chance. "We
reached graduate students pretty
well in the campaign," she said,
predicting that her slate could
"pull ahead" with graduate stu
dent support.
The Energizers may request a
recount if the vote gets closer,
Kown said. "I don't think it would
be necessary to make a big fuss
if the counting is accurate," she
said, but added that her slate
might call for a recount "just to
make sure."
A controversial week-long
recount occurred after last
spring's elections, but Baer said
a recount would not be prob
lematic this year. "I can't imagine
it would be anything more than
running the ballots through the
machine again," he said.
In addition to the COP race,
most undergraduate and graduate
senate seats will not be deter
mined until the final tally is
known. Preliminary results could
drastically change because of the
closeness of the candidates' total
votes.
Twenty undergraduate ASSU
Senate positions were at stake in
the election — 10 voting positions
and 10 alternate seats. The same
number of graduate senate posi
tions were also up for grabs.
At this point, junior Julie Mar
tinez, a member of the Peoples'
Platform, holds the lead in the
undergraduate senate race with
708 votes. If her lead remains the
highest, she will become deputy
chair of the senate. But the 20
leading candidates are tightly
bunched, with only 350 votes sep
arating Martinez from the person
in 20th place, freshman Anita
DeLucio.
Nine of the 10 People's Plat
form candidates are placed in the

top 20 senate slots.
In the race for senior class
presidents, Mac Slate currently
holds the lead with 314 votes. The
slate of Choi, Hauck, McMahon
and Packard withdrew before the
election, but Baer said it was too
late to take the slate off the ballot.
A third slate, The Pleasure Prin
ciple, ran as a write-in.
Three students lead in the race
for Student Conduct Legislative
Council, which makes policy
dealing with the Fundamental
Standard. Sophomore Janie Yen
holds a preliminary lead with
1,574 votes, junior Sam Kim is
second with 1,477 and freshman
Eric Li holds third place with
1,166, ahead of his nearest com

petitor by over 100 votes.
Although most preliminary fee
request results will stand, a num
ber remain undecided. In the
cases of six fee requests, less than
400 votes separate the number of
"yes" votes and "no" votes.
In an unprecedented result, the
Black Student Union's fee request
remains surprisingly close.
Whereas the BSU usually has no
trouble with its fee request, only
51 percent of the students voted
for the request this year. Seventy
four votes make up the difference
between "yes" and "no" on the
BSU's request, according to pre
liminary results.
