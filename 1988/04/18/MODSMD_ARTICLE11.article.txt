# Bennett to speak out on CIV tonight
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Secretary of Educa
tion William Bennett
will get a chance to
strike back at Cul
tures, Ideas and
Values tonight.
An outspoken
proponent of retain
ing a conservative
core list of classic
Western culture texts
in universities, Ben-

nett will speak at 7:30 p.m. tonight in
Cubberley Auditorium on the topic
"Why the West?" to be followed by a
question and answer session and a
private reception.
Bennett is scheduled to discuss the
Area One compromise worked out late
last month by a coalition of faculty
members and will offer a defense of the
Western Culture core reading list that
was dropped at the time.
In January, Bennett offered several
sharp criticisms of the Area One debate
to the national media, but since Feb

ruary he has kept quiet, saying that he
would speak after the issue had been
decided on campus.
Faculty and student response to Ben
nett's visit has been mixed.
English Prof. William Chace, one ar
chitect of the compromise that resulted
in the CIV course, said yesterday in a
prepared statement that he thought
Bennett's "understanding of events" in
the Area One debate has been colored
by a "misunderstanding on his part and.
at times, a cavalier handling of the facts
as he has been told them."
Black Student Union Chair Bill King,
a senior, said, "I won't take [his com
ments! seriously, because I feel his im
pact on the debate on educational
reform is minimal."
King said the BSU does not plan to
demonstrate against Bennett's visit.
According to senior Stacey Leyton, a
member of Students United for Demo
cratic Education, a progressive group,
many of the faculty and students in
volved in the Stanford debate "thought
it was uncalled for for Bennett to get
involved in the debate in the first place."
However, junior Peter Thiel, editor

of the Stanford Review, a conservative
student quarterly that is a sponsor of
Bennett's visit, said Bennett has been
interested in "establishing more
rigorous academic standards for years,
and a core curriculum of classics in the
humanities is part of what he supports."
Because of this interest, Thiel said
Bennett "has a natural interest in the
Stanford debate" and is well-researched
on the subject.
Thiel said the speech may "represent
a side of the debate which hasn't been
given much hearing."
Other students, such as Leyton and
David Brown, also a member of SUDE,
disagreed with Thiel's assessment.
Brown said he thought Bennett "took
a stand on an issue which he had not
investigated" when he made comment*
to the press earlier this year that lam
hasted the Faculty Senate for consider
ing CIV.
In a speech in New Orleans yesterday,
Bennett expressed his concern about
the rising tide of intolerance for diverse
viewpoints on American campuses, ac
cording to Allison Hartwell, a Bennett
speechwriter.
