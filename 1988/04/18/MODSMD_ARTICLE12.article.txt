## Power brokers in the senate 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Power in the ASSU Senate, the ul
timate representative authority of Stan
ford students, comes from two main
sources: membership in the stable
voting bloc of the People's Platform and
experience.
Traditionally, much of the new
senators' conduct is influenced by more
senior members of the senate who have
held seats for more than one year. Ac
cording to preliminary results from last
week's election, roughly half of the un
dergraduate senate-elect has had no pre
vious connection with the senate.
People who serve to guide new
senators are sometimes members of the
Council of Presidents, graduate
senators or the senate chair.
The chair, however, is not usually
seen as a person who influences
senators' votes, but rather one who
helps guide the senate in its decisions.
Stipulated by the ASSU Constitution,
the chair can only vote in the event of
a tie.
Senior Dave Smolen, this year's chair,
defined his role was a mediator, not a
power broker. "I made my role apoliti
cal," Smolen said. "I didn't want to
influence or bias anybody."

According to the constitution, a stu
dent does not have to be a member of
the senate to run for the position of
chair after the spring election. But only
members of the new senate-elect can
choose the chair.
The deputy chair takes over in the
event of the chair's absence, and helps
the chair with senate business.
This position, although second to the
chair, has more power because the
holder may cast a vote in decisions.
Senior Stacey Leyton, who held the
position this year, downplayed the au
thority of her role. "I take over in the
chair's absence," Leyton simply said.
But Leyton's modesty belies her posi
tion. As the top vote-getter in last year's
election and a high-profile member of
this year's leading COP candidates, A
New Slate of Mind, Leyton's vote as
sumes a far greater prominence than
that of any other senator.
Several senate candidates could move
into Leyton's position next year. Among
them are junior Julie Martinez, a
Peoples' Platform member who holds a
tenuous lead in ASSU voting as of today,
and junior Amol Doshi, who is not a
member of the party and currently holds
second place.
While fledgling senators are some
times helped by the veterans, those en

dorsed by the progressively minded
People's Platform find themselves in a
bloc that has influenced decisions in
the ASSU for the past two years. Al
though not yet finalized, it appears that
half of the undergraduate senate seats
will be occupied by Platform-endorsed
candidates.
Symbolizing the Platform's success
in garnering a strong voting bloc during
campaign week is the fact that the top
vote-getter in the last three senate elec
tions has been endorsed by the People's
Platform.
This year may carry extra signifigance
for those stamped with the Platform's
seal of approval. If their favorable num
bers in the senate remain the same and
the Platform-endorsed COP slate — A
New Slate of Mind — wins, there is
the potential for great cooperation be
tween the top executive and legislative
branches.
In past years, there has been some
friction between these two branches.
Power struggles between the two have
resulted in controversies over appoint
ments to other ASSU positions.
Control of senate votes does not come
automatically, even with the high num
bers of People's Platform candidates in
both the senate and COP.
