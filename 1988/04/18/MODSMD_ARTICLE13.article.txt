# Student groups reeling
## Four ASSU special fee requests endangered 
### Glen Tripp Staff writer 
Four student groups suffered severe
blows in last week's Spring Election
when they were denied ASSU special
fees funding in preliminary vote tallies.
Leaders of Release magazine, the
Chaparral, X-TV and Public Access Tele
vision said although their groups will
continue to function as best as they can,
the lost funding will decrease the quality
and quantity of their output. No group
said they would cease operation.
Only those student organizations that
need more than $4,000 for their annual
budgets can make special fee requests
to the general student body in the an
nual ASSU Spring Election.
Release, an entertainment publica
tion, and Stanford's humor magazine,
the Chaparral, were both denied their
requests by more than 520 votes and
will not be affected by the 500 write-in
ballots, whose results will be posted
today.
Both X-TV, the student channel and
PAT, a group that sought to provide
video equipment to the student body,

still stand a slim chance for approval
when these last votes are counted. X-TV
trails by 127 votes while PAT is 221
votes behind.
Release, which made its first appear
ance on the special fee request ballot
this year, lost its bid for $11,880 by 604
votes. Senior Gwendolyn Dick, publisher
of the magazine, said the Release staff
was "very disappointed."
Release may apply to the ASSU Pro
gram Board for discretionary funding,
but any amount received there would
probably not have a large impact on the
group's performance, Dick said.
The Chaparral sought $9,873. The
group's loss by 527 votes marks the
second consecutive year the magazine's
special fee request has been denied.
X-TV was denied its request for
$28,203, while Public Access Television
will not receive its request for $24,267.
X-TV General Manager Wink Thorne
said the result came as a "nasty
surprise," especially after the group
received its fund request last year. "We
were doing a lot of valuable work and
its a shame we weren't recognized for
it," Thorne said.
