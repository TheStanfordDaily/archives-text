Israel orders curfew in W. Bank
JERUSALEM — Israeli authorities ordered
about 450,000 Palestinian residents of the oc
cupied territories confined to their homes yes
terday and declared other West Bank
population centers "closed military areas" in
an extraordinary effort to halt a new wave of
violence following the weekend assassination
of a popular Palestine Liberation Organization
leader.
Fifteen Palestinian refugee camps on the
West Bank and five in the Gaza Strip were
put under full or partial curfew, as was the
West Bank's largest city, Nablus, the army
said.
In most cases, the restrictions went into
effect yesterday morning, following the
bloodiest day since the Palestinian uprising
began in the occupied areas last December.
At least 12 Arabs were shot to death by Israeli
troops and as many as 100 wounded Saturday
following the announcement that an uniden
tified assassination squad had gunned down
Khalil Wazir, the chief deputy to Yasser Arafat
in the PLO's dominant Fatah wing.
Wazir, better known here by his nom de
guerre, Abu Jihad, was the central figure in
coordinating PLO support for the 18-week-old
uprising in the territories. PLO officials ac
cused Israel of carrying out the assassination,
and Israeli officials pointedly avoided any
direct denial of the charge.
Wazir was felled in his Tunis home by up
to 70 bullets, reportedly as a female member
of the death squad filmed the execution with
a video camera.
Iraq launches big offensive
KUWAIT — Iraq launched a large offensive
yesterday aimed at driving Iranian forces off
the Faw Peninsula, where Iranian military
authorities claimed that their forces were bom
barded during the day with chemical weapons
and that "fierce fighting" was still under way
last night.
The surprise offensive on the first day of
the Moslem month of fasting was code-named
"Blessed Ramadan" by Iraq's military com
mand, which said its pre-dawn attack com
bined units of the 7th army Corps and elite
Republican Guard forces, which have been on
alert for months to contain any new Iranian
offensive in the area.
The distant rumble of the war could be
heard by residents of this adjoining sheikdom,
which has been seized by the hijack crisis still
unfolding in Algeria.
This first Iraqi army offensive in nearly two
years comes as Iraq has expressed frustration
with efforts by the U.N. Security Council to
enforce a cease-fire resolution passed last July
20.
The international diplomacy to end the war
followed two successive winter campaigns in
which Iran overran Faw in February 1986
and then in January 1987 advanced to the
outskirts of Basra, Iraq's largest southern city,
where Iranian artillery terrorized the 1 million
inhabitants with punishing barrages.
Iraq's hopes, according to a number of West
ern officials, are pegged to pushing for peace
to avoid a drawn-out war of attrition in which
Iran's larger population and industrial base
could prove decisive.
