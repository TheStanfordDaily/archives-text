# U.S. readies forces to attack Iran
## Reagan administration orders move to retaliate for Iranian mining of USS Roberts 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Reagan ad
ministration has ordered U.S. military
forc< sin the Persian Guli to intensify
preparations for a possible military
strike against Iran for apparently
resuming its mine-laying operations in
the strategic waterway, U.S. officials
said yesterday.
Orders to go to a heightened state
of readiness went out from the Joint
Chiefs of Staff after President Reagan
met with his top advisers on Friday
to discuss ways to retaliate for the
Iranian mine that blew a nine-foot
hole in the USS Samuel Roberts, in
juring 10 crew members and almost
sinking the frigate in waters 67 miles
east of Bahrain.
Although the execute order had not
been issued to U.S. Persian Gulf forces
as of early last night and Reagan could
still pull away from a retaliatory strike,
informed officials said events were
moving toward military action rather
than away from it.
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci,
who planned to be in Puerto Rico today
to witness naval exercises, canceled
that trip to participate in the discus
sions on what to do about Iran's ap

parent resumption of mine laying in
the gulf, officials said.
Pentagon press representative Dan
Howard declined to say why Carlucci
had decided not to go. But Howard
remarked that Carlucci had concluded
it is "not an auspicious time to be out
of town."
The retaliatory plan, which has
gained momentum over the last few
days, officials said, was a possible lim
ited military attack coupled with a
stern warning from the U.S. govern
ment that any further mining by Iran
would bring harsher military reprisals.
The Roberts struck a mine just after
completing the 25th successful convoy
this year of one of the 11 Kuwaiti
tankers flying the U.S. flag. The mine,
which ripped apart the hull of the
Roberts, appeared to be a part of a
string, Pentagon officials said, indicat
ing the systematic resumption of
Iranian mining of the gulf.
Defense Department sources said
they have determined that Iran laid
the mines. "The mines are theirs —
there's no question about it," one
source said. Iranian mines have turned
out to be the biggest threat to U.S.

escort operations in the Persian Gulf.
Navy mine-hunting teams that
searched the area where the Roberts
was hit found and later destroyed two
mines after identifying Iran as the
manufacturer of the mines from serial
numbers on the weapons. AJI six of
the Navy's minesweepers are continu
ing a search for more mines, and mine
hunting vessels from other nations
also are conducting periodic searches.
But no other new mines have been
reported found.
Pentagon press representative
Howard refused to comment about any
possible planning for a retaliatory
strike. The Navy has 29 vessels in the
gulf and the north Arabian Sea, in
cluding the aircraft carrier USS En
terprise, with almost 100 combat
aircraft aboard.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
U.S. Central Command, which con
trols Persian Gulf operations, have al
ready prepared what are called "ready
strike" folders for targets in Iran. U.S.
forces in me gulf, officials said, are
updating information on these targets
as well as monitoring new Iranian mil
itary activities in case they qualify as

retaliatory targets.
The Navy photographed the mines
that the Roberts discovered on Thurs
day and determined through intelli
gence channels that they were made
in Iran last vear. U.S. officials said
that they do not have similar
photographic proof of the actual laying
of the mines by Iran, but said the
circumstantial evidence is persuasive
that it was done by Iranian forces.
The president tried this tit-for-tat
response for Iranian mining last Oc
tober when Navy warships shelled one
oil platform in the Gulf and a SEAL
(Sea-Air-Land) team boarded and blew
up another. The Iranians on the plat
forms had fled before they were at
tacked.
The attacks on the oil platforms
came after the United States caught
the Iranians sowing mines from the
Iran Ajr, which was captured by the
United States in an attack that killed
three Iranians. The 26 survivors were
returned to Tehran by way of Oman
and the ship later was towed to inter
national waters and blown up with
explosives by the United States.

Roberts, appeared to be a part of a
string, Pentagon officials said, indicat
ing the systematic resumption of
Iranian mining of the gulf.
Defense Department sources said
they have determined that Iran laid
the mines. "The mines are theirs —
there's no question about it," one
source said. Iranian mines have turned
out to be the biggest threat to U.S.

escort operations in the Persian Gulf.
Navy mine-hunting teams that
searched the area where the Roberts
was hit found and later destroyed two
mines after identifying Iran as the
manufacturer of the mines from serial
numbers on the weapons. AJI six of
the Navy's minesweepers are continu
ing a search for more mines, and mine
hunting vessels from other nations
also are conducting periodic searches.
But no other new mines have been
reported found.
Pentagon press representative
Howard refused to comment about any
possible planning for a retaliatory
strike. The Navy has 29 vessels in the
gulf and the north Arabian Sea, in
cluding the aircraft carrier USS En
terprise, with almost 100 combat
aircraft aboard.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
U.S. Central Command, which con
trols Persian Gulf operations, have al
ready prepared what are called "ready
strike" folders for targets in Iran. U.S.
forces in me gulf, officials said, are
updating information on these targets
as well as monitoring new Iranian mil
itary activities in case they qualify as

retaliatory targets.
The Navy photographed the mines
that the Roberts discovered on Thurs
day and determined through intelli
gence channels that they were made
in Iran last vear. U.S. officials said
that they do not have similar
photographic proof of the actual laying
of the mines by Iran, but said the
circumstantial evidence is persuasive
that it was done by Iranian forces.
The president tried this tit-for-tat
response for Iranian mining last Oc
tober when Navy warships shelled one
oil platform in the Gulf and a SEAL
(Sea-Air-Land) team boarded and blew
up another. The Iranians on the plat
forms had fled before they were at
tacked.
The attacks on the oil platforms
came after the United States caught
the Iranians sowing mines from the
Iran Ajr, which was captured by the
United States in an attack that killed
three Iranians. The 26 survivors were
returned to Tehran by way of Oman
and the ship later was towed to inter
national waters and blown up with
explosives by the United States.
