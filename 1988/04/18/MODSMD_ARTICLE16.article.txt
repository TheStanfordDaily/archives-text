# Talks may stall as Contras reject disarmament plan

### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Talks
aimed at a final settlement of the
Nicaraguan war appeared close to an
impasse yesterday after rebel leaders
rejected a Sandinista proposal to disarm
their guerrillas by July 1.
The government proposal would
postpone any discussion of political
changes in Nicaragua until Contra
leaders sign what amounts to a sur
render. Only by signing could they
receive non-lethal aid for their troops
or freedom for their prisoners.
Gen. Humberto Ortega, the defense
minister and chief Sandinista negotia
tor, described the initiative as an effort
to speed "a definitive victory for the
Nicaraguan people, the vanguard of the
defense of the revolution."
The head of the rebel delegation,
Adolfo Calero, called the proposal "to
tally one-sided and of course unaccept
able." During a recess to study the offer,
he said: "It makes no mention of de
mocracy as a condition for peace. It
sidesteps the negotiating procedure as
a way of achieving peace with freedom."
A Sandinista official said later that
the proposal was not an ultimatum, and
rebel leaders resumed the talks. But the
remarks by both sides seemed to dim
any chance of a formal cease-fire, much
less a political settlement, before the
end of three scheduled days of negotia
tions today.
The talks, which have brought rebel
leaders to Managua for the first time
in the six-year conflict, aim to turn the
current month-old informal truce into
a supervised cease-fire and set terms

under which the rebels would lay down
their weapons and return to civilian life.
As Contra leaders understood the ac
cord, technical details of separating the
warring armies were to be negotiated
first.
These first steps, rebel leaders
believed, would give them time, and a
cushion of aid, to judge the govern
ment's willingness to ease what they
call a one-party dictatorship.
But after seven days of talks failed to
iron out technical details of a cease-fire,
the government proposed yesterday to
negotiate a single followup agreement.
It would:
— Remove Sandinista forces from
seven rural cease-fire zones by April 25
and put Contra forces into them by May
15.
— Free half the Contras' remaining
1,500 prisoners, permit the rebels to
send eight delegates to the "national
dialogue" and allow them to receive U.S.
aid after May 20, when an international
commission is to confirm the rebels'
presence in the zones.
— Oblige rebel troops to turn in their
weapons, in one zone at a time, through
out the month of June. When four zones
are emptied of armed rebels, the remain
ing Contra prisoners will be freed.
— Free another 1,800 prisoners,
former members of the National Guard
arrested in the 1979 Sandinista
takeover, as soon as an agreement is
signed, except those whom an interna
tional commission finds guilty of
"atrocities" against civilians.
