# Senate panel OKs INF
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Senate
Foreign Relations committee has
approved almost unanimously a
report endorsing approval of the
Intermediate-Nuclear Forces
(INF) treaty, with the condition
that the Senate also repudiate
Reagan administration assertions
about treaty-making powers.
The committee approved the
report 17 to 2, the same vote by
which it approved the treaty itself
several weeks ago. The two nega
tive votes were cast by Sens. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and Larry Pres
sler, R-S.D.
The committee, wrapping up
three months of work on the
treaty in preparation for a Senate
debate to begin next month, said
in a report to be released today
that enactment of the controver
sial condition regarding treaty
making powers is needed to avert
several "far-reaching and danger
ous consequences," including
"nullification" of the Senate's fu
ture advisory powers and poten
tial "paralysis in treaty-making."
The condition, approved several
weeks ago by all of the commit
tee's Democrats but only two of
its Republicans, requires that
President Reagan agree that the
executive branch is required as a
matter of law to follow the treaty
interpretation shared by the ad
ministration and the Senate when
it is approved.
The administration, which
maintains that executive branch
representations to the Senate on
treaties can be legally irrelevant,
has termed the condition an "un
constitutional abrogation" of

treaty power, and has sought to
rally Senate Republicans to
amend it or defeat it.
The committee's majority, an
ticipating efforts to weaken the
provision, cast the debate in stark
terms and said "any 'compromise'
.. . would have the effect of dilut
ing and thereby perverting .. .
(its) basic purpose."
The committee said the elimi
nation of U.S. and Soviet medium
range and shorter-range nuclear
missiles called for by the pact
would have little military signifi
cance, because existing or new
strategic — or long-range — nu
clear weapons can strike the same
targets.
The committee also said "the
treaty represents a potentially
signficant change in the dynamics
of East-West confrontation," be
cause the Soviet Union has ac
cepted on-site inspections to
verify treaty compliance and
heavier cuts in their own forces
than in U.S. forces — "two crucial
principles ... that may portend
greater ... willingness to accom
modate NATO concerns in the on
going negotiations on strategic
nuclear arms."
Echoing comments made by
senior administration officials,
the committee said Senate rejec
tion of the treaty would be "a
disaster" that could breathe "new
life into the unilateral disarma
ment movement and ... spark a
resurgence of the anti-American
sentiments" that accompanied
U.S. medium-range missile
deployments in Europe.
