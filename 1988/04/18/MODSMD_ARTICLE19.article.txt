## BSU cries wolf 
### 
THE BSU cried wolf.
At the ASSU Senate's
April 5 meeting, the BSU al
leged that the selection process
used to fill three ASSU positions
was racially biased, discriminating
unfairly against black applicants.
But as the dust surrounding
these allegations settles, it becomes
clear that the BSU's protests were
irresponsible reactions to unsub
stantiated rumors of racism.
Institutional racism may indeed
exist in the ASSU; but in each of
these cases, factors other than race
explain why some students were
selected over others for ASSU po
sitions. In none of them can it be
shown that racism — in any form
— was a factor.
All three are, in fact, cases in
which individuals were caught in
the middle of standard political
processes.
In the case of the Speaker's
Bureau, Terri James did not get
a committee's recommendation be
cause of a conflict as to how the
Speaker's Bureau should be run.
Council of Presidents members
Leonard Adler, Maria Canas and
Jim Durkin explained that their
decision was based on James' past
performance as director. Although
James was the incumbent, her
record included a poor handling of
publicity and a philosophy of
speaker selection that proved too
narrow to many students. James
herself has admitted that her case
was not based on racism.
In the case of the Public Affairs
Committee, Adler said incumbent
Deanna Terzian, a white student,
received the nomination over Ra
chel Wiesen, a black student, be
cause Terzian had sucessfully
carried out the duties of the newly
created post. Adler had established
and overseen the committee, and
he believed Terzian was capable of
handling the job for another year.'
Although Wiesen was highly qual
ified, there was no reason to

change directors. Nowhere did race
play a role in the decision.
And in the case of the Nomina
tions Committee, Lloyd Metz was
a victim of poor judgment by Adler.
Adler was unnecessarily aggressive
in questioning Metz about a past
Daily editorial he wrote criticizing
the ASSU. Adler apologized later.
But Adler had the right to ques
tion and evaluate Metz's — and
all other candidates' — biases.
Metz's position as treasurer of the
BSU had to be seriously consid
ered, because the head of Nom
Comm wields tremendous power
in the appointment of many can
didates to other ASSU committees.
This is not racism; it's politics.
The BSU was "trigger-happy"
because it did not do its homework
before making very serious charges
of racism. Even BSU Chair Bill
King, who spoke to the senate, ad
mits he responded without com
pletely researching the rumors.
King and the BSU have been
backpedalling for a week to mini
mize the seriousness of their
charges. But semantics and polit
ical posturing changes nothing.
The fact that students may have
voted down the BSU's ASSU fee
request because of its unfounded
attacks should serve as a warning
to other groups.
The BSU is an indispensable
watchdog for black concerns at
Stanford. In its 20-year history —
and most recently during the Area
One debate — it has spoken per
suasively about issues important
to all students. But the power of
the BSU's political voice rests on
its credibility as a thoughtful and
responsible organization. The BSU
cannot successfully counter racial
injustice within this community
when its image is damaged.
To employ racial terms without
just cause is not only irresponsible
but will dull sympathetic ears to
future, legitimate advocacy by the
BSU.
