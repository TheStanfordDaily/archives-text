## The
						Windy City Blues 
### 
THE SMOKE thickened. Glasses
clinked. The members of Cicero
Blake's band approached the stage.
Sitting at a small, drink-filled table at
Rose's Blues Bar on the northwest side
of Chicago just last weekend, I watched
the owner grasp the microphone. He
spoke, "Testing one, two. Testing one,
two. .
Maybe the owner is on to something.
We do it with cars, washing machines,
book-of-the-month deals, health club
memberships, relationships and the Big
Mac — and why not with the Presidency?
Yes, we live in the warranty society, a
money-back-if-not-completely-satisfied
culture. If we are not happy after 45
days with most of life's important things,
we can return or exchange them. Why
should the President be the exception?
Imagine.
Jesse Jackson comes to reign. If the
dope keeps flowing through the nation's
veins, while not enough books are pro
vided for its brains, then Jesse's out on
the next train.
Mike Dukakis — no Massachusetts
miracle — out of here. George Bush con
tinues the Reagan legacy — out of here.
The nation's entitled to a mistake. If
politicians have become no more than
glossy media packages designed by
Madison Avenue, like a type of beer or
catfood, then they should be treated the
same way.
When I first learned about the enor
mity of the universe, I began to have
nightmares. These nightmares centered
on comparing my existence to the uni
verse's infinity and realizing that I was

nothing more than a speck of microdust
in the big picture.
Staring at Georges Seurat's "Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of La Grande
Jatte," in Chicago's Art Institute, the
thoughts of my nightmare returned.
From far away, the painting represents
a mellow weekend scene on a river shore.
Up close, however, all I saw were dots
of color forming the images. Even closer,
I noticed that the dots were of all dif
ferent colors that seemingly should not
have combined to form faces and bodies,
sailboats and trees.
How can we all take ourselves so
seriously if we are nothing more than
randomly colored dots? Our lives seem
to revolve around our tests, essays,
PSATs/SATs/GPAs and other criteria
which alledge to measure our societal
worth.
Seeing a person only as an embodiment
of his score, however, is like viewing
Serat's painting only as a tranquil river
scene. I am silently resentful when the
first and only question someone asks me
is what I do. I disagree with the '80s
equation: I do therefore I am. Seurat
reminded me that lurking behind the
superficial images people present are a
vast array of colors and experiences that
I will never see unless I look closely
enough.
In the bottom of Saturday's third in
ning at Wrigley Field, I and 30,000 of
my new friends tensed as the pitcher
delivered his fast ball. The score was 0-0,
the bases were loaded, two outs, three
balls, two strikes. The pitch: strike three.
The batter erupted in a series of un
intelligible screams while the fans around

me started yelling things about op
tometry, luck, tradition and God. Ah,
another pleasant afternoon enjoying the
nation's pasttime.
What I had trouble comprehending in
this scene was that 30,000 people were
ready to come to blows . . . over a baseball
game? Viewed realistically, all that hap
pended was a man in an aesthetically
unappealing yellow and black outfit
hurled a piece of leather very fast at a
squating man dressed in plastic armor
while a moustached man in red, white
and blue tights looked on. A black
cladded, masked man then yelled, "Strike
three" while making some bizarre hand
gestures and dancing a little jig.
But here the fans stood screaming and
hollering. How can a responsible society
explain the blind fealty of professional
sports fans when a city's schools, poor
and homeless fight for what little support
they can get.
Thirty-thousand people would never
come out to cheer high school science
project winners. In trying to figure out
why sports maintains such a strong grip
on us, I reached at least one conclusion
in Chicago. It can not be because the
team wins.
