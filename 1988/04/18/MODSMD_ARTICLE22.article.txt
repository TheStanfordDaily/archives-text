## Concert Network's sponsorship of Fishbone wrong 
### 
I AM WRITING in support of and
in addition to Heather McClure's
April 14 letter regarding the lunch
time Fishbone concert on April 12.
I have heard Fishbone before, and I
like their music in spite of the lyrics
of a few of the songs, and I was ex
cited by the opportunity to hear them
play. However, I agree with McClure's
comments on the sexist lyrics. The
concert left me feeling that Fishbone
should not have been brought to White
Plaza at lunch by Stanford sponsor
ship.
Many people would contest that
Fishbone is not "serious" about its
lyrics. Regardless of this factor, the
lyrics of several of the songs that were

played are literally offensive to at least
the female half of the Stanford com
munity. Whether or not anybody felt
the offense or was hurt by the lyrics is
irrelevant. Songs about women that
say things like, "U.G.L.Y. You ain't got
no alibi" or "Hey, we want some pus
sy" or "Lyin' ass bitch" are derogatory
and offensive in word whether or not
in purpose to women.
I recognize that this is popular
culture, and my own and McClure's
feelings about the lyrics may not
reflect everyone's, but it is disturbing
that the concert was as popular as it
was evidenced to be by the cheering
audience. It was hard to see women
whom I am not sure had really con-

templated Fishbone's meaning, singing
along to "U.G.L.Y." and "Lyin* ass
bitch."
I am curious if another band, offen
sive to a different portion of the popu
lation, blacks or perhaps men, would
receive a different reaction.
It is not so relevant how I or even
how the majority of students feel
about the words. I do not object to
Fishbone playing concerts for people
who have made the conscious decision
to go and hear what Fishbone has to
play. My objection to the lyrics is a
separate issue.
I just think that the band, in light
of the content of the lyrics, should not
have been sponsored by the Stanford

Concert Network, at undoubtedly great
cost, to play a public concert. Nobody
should have to hear Fishbone's lyrics
who had not chosen to. People working
in the post office or at Tresidder or
simply passing by should not have had
to hear them.
I appreciate the effort on the part of
the Concert Network to bring the
Stanford community something that
they otherwise might not have had
access to; however, I think that the
choice of Fishbone was not only a
weak representation of the entire
community but it was blatantly offen
sive to a great portion of it.
