# Link public service to academic studies
## 
### 
I would like to add my support for
the April 13 proposal to increase
student-faculty interaction made by
Evan and Ann Porteus.
In my work at the Public Service
Center I am often asked by students
to write letters of recommendation.
While it is gratifying to respond to
these requests, I find myself also sadly
reminded that many students come to
me because they do not know any
faculty well enough to ask. Thus, I
was not surprised by the survey data
revealed in the Porteus' letter.
However, in supporting the Porteus
proposal I would also like to expand
their vision of how a requirment "that
students participate in at least one
individual or small group faculty
directed experience" might be imple
mented.
While I am an enthusiastic supporter
of undergraduate research, directed
reading, etc., I would add to the Por-

teus' list of roles faculty could play
with students: the facilitation in stu
dents — through directed reading,
seminars, classes, etc. — of critical
reflection on their public service expe
riences and integration of these reflec
tions with regular academic learning.
Students often remark that they get
more out of community service than
they put in. When I inquire what it is
they get, a common response contains
statements about how much they learn
— about the people with whom they
work, about the social and political
context that surrounds their service
experience and about their own philos
ophy and values that motivate them to
serve.
When I next ask how these reflec
tions relate to their academic studies,
many students draw a blank. Some say
they had never thought about that
before, others respond with comments
like, "That's why I do community serv
ice, to learn about the parts of life
which academic study seems to ig
nore."
These responses well illustrate the

fragmentation in learning which results
from postsecondary education's tradi
tional distinction between theory and
practice. Stucturally, we have not pro
vided a means of linking academic
study to student's direct experience
with social problems and issues.
In the area of content, we have
failed to effectively educate students
with both an understanding of social
issues and an abilitly to apply their
understanding in solving human prob
lems.
A result of this fragmentation is the
multitude of students we see at the
Public Service Center who have
developed substantial knowledge of
public issues through coursework and
who became deeply involved in these
issues through community service, but
who have difficulty integrating these
two important parts of their lives.
How can faculty members play a
stronger role in enabling students to
link their public service and academic
experiences, to integrate their service
based and academic learning, to con
nect study with service so the disci-

plines illuminate and inform commu
nity service and so service experience
lends meaning and value to the disci
plines?
Surely part of the answer is through
the mechanisms proposed in the Por
teus letter — directed-study arrange
ments, seminars or even non-credited
residential education programs. There
exist instructional methods for encour
aging students to think critically about
their public service interests and expe
riences and to integrate that thinking
with theories and concepts represented
in the academic curriculum.
While I am not certain that requir
ing student-faculty interaction will
bring about the benefits articulated in
the Porteus letter, I feel the University
could provide both more incentives and
recognition to faculty who take the
time to work intensively with under
graduates. I hope the critical reflection
on public service described above will
be a primary focus of such interaction.
