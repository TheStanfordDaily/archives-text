## Scouting new horizons 
### Katherine Toy 
As a U.S. Coast Guard crew
climbed up their ship's masts and
prepared for docking in the San
Francisco Bay, girl scout Natalie
Minenko stood on the 147-foot
foremast, working beside the well
trained crew.
The Stanford sophomore is one
of two girl scouts representing the
organization on the Eagle, a mil
itary ship that recently sailed to
Australia for the country's bicen
tennial celebration.
During her five months aboard
the Eagle, Minenko has not only
participated in Australia's inter
national celebration of fleet ships
but has also traveled to ports
throughout the Pacific, learning
navigational skills and talking
with girl scouts throughout the
world.
She has met with Girl Scouts
in Tasmania, Mexico and every
other port on the Eagle's trip.
Girl Scout organizations exist in
108 different countries.
While aboard the Eagle, Minen
ko said she is expected to function
as a low ranking member of the
Coast Guard who must "work
hard, help out and pull (her) own
weight."
The ship now serves as a
"classroom-at-sea" for cadets and
instructors from the U.S. Coast
Guard Academy. Actual coast
guard officers instruct the 190
college-age students aboard ship.
As a girl scout, Minenko has
participated in navigational exer
cises before â€” but never so rig
orously. With over 20,000 square
feet of sail and 20 miles of rigging,
learning the ropes of the Eagle
was no easy task.
Minenko pointed to one ship
maneuver that requires the coor
dination of over 200 lines of rope.
"I learned by experience from day
one," Minenko said about the
complex maneuvers. "I've learned
a lot about teamwork, personal
stamina and endurance," she
added.
While friends here jog for ex
ercise, Minenko said one her fa
vorite workouts at sea has been

"going up the rigging." The exer
cise entails using rope ladders to
climb up one of the 147-foot mast.
"(Once up the mast) it feels like
you're on top of the world," she
boasted.
But not all experiences aboard
ship give Minenko the same high
as climbing the ropes. Some of
her ship board tasks include
scrubbing the deck and polishing
the brass instruments.
Besides the manual work,
Minenko also attends classes on
organizational behavior, oceanog
raphy and meteorology. Following
classes, Minenko works four
hours of ship duties which some
times include a turn at the helm.
When the Eagle docked in San
Francisco last March, the local
Girl Scout council presented the
Eagle's captain with 50 cases of
Girl Scout cookies for the crew.
Minenko has become especially

popular with Eagle crew mates
by taking orders for over 300
boxes of cookies that will be
delivered on board.
Originally built in 1936 Nazi
Germany, the Eagle served as a
training vessel for German Naval
cadets. The Eagle was taken as a
war prize by the United States
following World War 11.
Minenko's journey with the Ea
gle is the longest in the ship's
52-year history. Besides visiting
exotic ports in American Samoa
and Honolulu, the ship also
docked at San Francisco for two
days in March.
During the stay, Minenko, a
resident of Redwood City, went
home. She is now back on board
for the tail end of the trip through
the Panama Canal.
Although she is still an enthu
siastic sailor, during her stay in
San Francisco Minenko admitted
that "there's no place like home."
