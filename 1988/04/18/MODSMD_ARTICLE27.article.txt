# Hidden treasures of trash

Stanford Recycling is a lot more than green
barrels and old newspaper. This student-run or
ganization is working to help preserve the envi
ronment as well as help Palo Alto's overburdened
refuse disposal department.
The Palo Alto City Council recently announced
that its main land fill will be closed by 1996 and
converted to a park. This announcement brought
the issue of waste disposal to the attention of
the University.
To mitigate the problem of having diminishing
waste disposal capacity, the University began fi
nancial support for Stanford Recycling, according
to the organization's manager, Mary Poxon. The
additional funding has allowed the group to in
crease its recycling operation and thereby lessen
the Stanford community's demand on Palo Alto
waste disposal services.
"People are finally starting to take notice of
a problem that has existed for years," Poxon said.
Stanford Recycling grew out of a 1978 SWOPSI
course on solid waste management, and was in
itially funded by ASSU fees.
"In 1986, Stanford Recycling proposed that it
was saving the University considerable amounts
(of money) in garbage pick up. The University
agreed to pay some 25 percent of the yearly
budget of around $75,000, and guaranteed the
organization a work space on campus," said
Poxon.
Today the organization maintains over 850
collection barrels at about 300 barrel sites, and
owns three trucks and a cardboard bailing ma
chine, Poxon said. She said Stanford Recycling
collects about 6.5 percent of the waste in the
Stanford community.
Poxon said an estimated 70 percent of the
funds that support Stanford Recycling comes
from the sale of hand-sorted materials, consisting
of paper products, aluminum and glass.
"Our stuff is so clean and well-sorted, we're
a prized account" for the larger recycling com
panies, Poxon said.
Poxon charges state and local government with
apathy towards recycling. California only recently
adopted a redemption system for glass and alu
minum beverage containers, and provides only
one cent in reward for returned bottles and cans
compared to the 5 cents offered by some states.
Poxon realizes that recycling will only become
popular if people understand its potential value.
"Recycling requires a behavior change," Poxon
said. "But once it's learned it becomes habitual,
it's not that hard. The facts are motivation
enough: 17 good-sized trees are saved when a
ton of newspaper is recycled."
"Developing a recycling habit has a lot to do

'Our stuff is so clean and
well-sorted, we're a prized
account.'

with education," said Vera Dahle, recycling co
ordinator for Palo Alto Public Works. "People in
Palo Alto are aware, acknowledge the issue and
make the contributions that keep the service
alive."
Poxon also believes education is essential to
increase awareness of the necessity of recycling,
and hopes Stanford Re<ycling will become more
involved in the education of the Stanford com
munity.
"I find waste incredibly offensive," Poxon said.
"There is no sounder option for waste than recy
cling. I think it's appalling that educated people
at Stanford continue to litter and neglect recy
cling."
Despite Poxon's concern, Stanford Recycling
is notoriously successful for a student run recy
cling group, and this success makes the employees
feel especially rewarded for their labor.
"I really love working here," Poxon said. "I'm
enforcing a crucial issue, and recycling is money."
Stanford Recycling employee Glenn Smith said,
"I'm totally into recycling, it's a very important
environmental issue."
Kyndaron Reiner, another worker at Stanford
Recycling said, "I feel really good about working
here. I quit working in food service about three
weeks ago where I saw an incredible amount of
waste. What a contrast!"
Although Palo Alto has a stronger newspaper
recycling participation rate than most communi
ties, Poxon and the Palo Alto City Council are
obviously concerned with the proportions of
waste.
Search for a suitable land fill is in progress.
Proposals for a new land fill, which will include
an on-site recycling center, will be presented to
the lower peninsula city councils within the next
few weeks, said Valerie Lenz, solid waste manager
for Sunnyvale.
"To keep garbage accumulation to a minimum
both today and in the future, it is crucial to
catch the 25 percent of waste which is recyclable
before it gets dumped," Lenz said.
Poxon's immediate goal is to increase recycling
efforts in the Stanford community and volume
at Stanford Recycling to slow the filling of a new
dump.
"Trash is everybody's problem, people must
make a commitment to do something about it,"
she said.
