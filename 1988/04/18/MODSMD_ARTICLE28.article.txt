LOS ANGELES — Patrick McEnroe
and Martin Blackman staved off a
furious USC rally before a vocal
crowd at Marks Stadium Friday by
beating Murphy Jensen and Scott
Brownsberger 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 in the
deciding match to cap a 5-4 win for

the Stanford men's tennis team.
The top-ranked Cardinal, 20-1, also defeated No.
9 UCLA Saturday 5-2. With the two wins, Stanford
clinched the Pacific 10 Conference title with a 9-0
record and is a lock for the No. 1 seed at the NCAA
Championships next month. USC dropped to 22-4,
UCLA to 16-7.
"We played with a lot of confidence," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said late last night. "No. 2 doubles
is a definite strength. David (Wheaton) is getting
better all the time, and it was nice to see Jeff
Cathrall and Martin Blackman get a couple wins."
Down 4-1, the third-rated Trojans inched back
into Friday's contest. Brownsberger, urged on by
the home crowd, fought off Cardinal freshman
Glenn Solomon 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 to keep USC in the
match.
At No. 1 doubles, marked by the fist-pumping
antics of junior Eric Amend, Trojans Scott Melville
and Amend then outdueled Wheaton and sophomore
JefT Tarango 4-6, 6-3, 6-2.
USC's John Carras and Byron Black knotted the
match at 4-4 by squeaking past sophomores Cathrall
and Eric Peus 7-5, 7-6.
But McEnroe and Blackman slammed the door
on the Trojan comeback at No. 2 doubles.
Down two set points in the first set, McEnroe's
service returns and Blackman's volleys were too
much for the Trojan pair, deflating the momentum
USC had built by their three consecutive wins.
It was the first 5-4 win of the season for the
Cardinal.
"It was good beating them at their place," Black
man said. "We proved to ourselves we can come
through when the conditions aren't perfect. That
was the first time we've been in that situation —
and conditions won't always be perfect, especially
in Athens [Georgia] at the NCAAs."
At No. 1 singles, Melville continued his mastery
of Stanford players by dumping Tarango 6-3, 6-2.
Wheaton bested Carras 6-3, 7-6, while Blackman
edged Amend 0-6, 6-4, 6-4. McEnroe outlasted Black
6-7, 6-3, 7-5.
Against the Bruins, Stanford jumped out to a 4-2
lead after singles play and again cliched the match
with a win at No. 2 doubles.
Wheaton one of his two singles losses
this season by whipping Brian Garrow 6-2, 6-4.
Blackman also reversed an earlier decision by
defeating Jason Netter 7-5, 7-5.
Cathrall upended Robert Beirens 6-1, 6-1 and
Solomon beat Giora Payes 6-3, 6-3.
The Bruins got on the scoreboard when Patrick
Galbraith upset McEnroe 6-3, 6-3 and Buff Farrow
outlasted Tarango 6-1, 1-6, 6-3.
McEnroe and Blackman closed out the contest
by disposing of Bierens and Farrow 6-1, 6-4.
