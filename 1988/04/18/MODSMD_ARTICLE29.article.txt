# Women fall to UCLA, rebound to rout USC
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Alter being sur
prised by fourth
ranked UCLA 6-3
Friday, the No. 2
women's
tennis team looked
vulnerable for the

first time this season as third
ranked USC came into town for
a Saturday afternoon match.
Playing without senior Cari
Hagey, the Cardinal had been
swept in the doubles by the
Bruins. And freshman Teri Whit
linger, who had been undefeated
in dual-match play prior to this
weekend, saw her streak come to
a grinding halt with a 6-0, 6-0
loss at No. 3 singles.
But the Cardinal restored its
confidence Saturday by pummel
ing the Trojans for the second
time this year. The 5-1 victory
upped Stanford's record to 21-2.
"We were really pleased we
could bounce back," freshman
Sandra Birch said. "If you lose
you can get so dejected that you
don't play well the next day. We
used it as motivation to beat
USC."
"I thought that was wonder
ful," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said of Saturday's match.
"We proved we could come back.
And of course the only way you
can come back is to lose one."
And lose one is precisely what
the Cardinal did Friday. Stanford
had beaten the Bruins twice pre
viously this season, and Brennan
was almost certain that his team
would pull off the hat trick.
"I don't know if shocked is the
right word. We were surprised,"
Brennan said, referring to the
Cardinal's reaction after being up
set by UCLA. After pausing, he
added, "Yeah, I guess we were
shocked."
The Bruins were led by a pair
of freshmen Friday. Kirsten
Dreyer blanked a baffled Teri
Whitlinger, and Jessica Emmons
swept Cardinal sophomore Lisa
Green 6-4, 6-4 in the No. 2 con
test.
Stanford received strong per
formances once again from fresh
men Tami Whitlinger and Sandra
Birch and senior Kay Tittle. But
UCLA achieved a split in the
singles when Catherine O'Meara
outlasted junior Cindy
Buchsbaum 6-2, 0-6, 6-1 in the

No. 6 match.
The Bruins took the Cardinal
out quickly in doubles. In the No.
2 contest, Emmons and Joni Ur
ban knocked off Green and Tittle
6-4, 6-4.
Birch and Buchsbaum, playing
together for the first time, hung
tough for a set against Dreyer
and Maria LaFranchi, but the
UCLA tandem clinched the team
victory with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 win
at No. 3 doubles.
Saturday, the Cardinal restored
order as all three players that had
lost against UCLA won their
singles matches. "I'm always par
ticularly happy when a loser on
Friday comes back and wins Sat
urday," Brennan said. "You never
like to see somebody lose two in
a row."
Brennan was most pleased with
the victories posted by Buchs
baum and Teri Whitlinger.
Buchsbaum won a close first set
and then coasted in the second
set en route to a 7-6, 6-1 win over
the Trojans' Ginny Purdy. Her
victory was a relief for the Car
dinal, which has yet to find a
consistent No. 6 player.
"It was really great for Cindy
and great for the team," the Car
dinal coach said. "It's kind of nice
not to have to give one away."
Ten Whitlinger looked to be in
trouble again after dropping the
first set of the No. 3 singles
against USC's Anya Kochoff. But
even though she was still strug
gling, Whitlinger rallied for a 2-6,
6-3, 6-3 win that clinched the
team victory for Stanford.
"She still didn't play really
well," Brennan said. "What she
needed at that point was a win.
It waa ugly, but it was a win."
Trojan freshman Trisha Laux
prevented a shutout by beating
Tami Whitlinger for the second
time this season. Laux prevailed
6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in the No. 1 singles,
pinning Whitlinger with her first
loss in almost two months.
In the other singles contests,
Green beat Stephanie London 6-2,
7-6, Birch routed Mary Norwood
6-1, 6-2, and Tittle rolled past
Lupita Novelo 7-5, 6-1.

team victory for Stanford.
"She still didn't play really
well," Brennan said. "What she
needed at that point was a win.
It waa ugly, but it was a win."
Trojan freshman Trisha Laux
prevented a shutout by beating
Tami Whitlinger for the second
time this season. Laux prevailed
6-4, 4-6, 6-3 in the No. 1 singles,
pinning Whitlinger with her first
loss in almost two months.
In the other singles contests,
Green beat Stephanie London 6-2,
7-6, Birch routed Mary Norwood
6-1, 6-2, and Tittle rolled past
Lupita Novelo 7-5, 6-1.

Alter being sur
prised by fourth
ranked UCLA 6-3
Friday, the No. 2
women's
tennis team looked
vulnerable for the

first time this season as third
ranked USC came into town for
a Saturday afternoon match.
Playing without senior Cari
Hagey, the Cardinal had been
swept in the doubles by the
Bruins. And freshman Teri Whit
linger, who had been undefeated
in dual-match play prior to this
weekend, saw her streak come to
a grinding halt with a 6-0, 6-0
loss at No. 3 singles.
But the Cardinal restored its
confidence Saturday by pummel
ing the Trojans for the second
time this year. The 5-1 victory
upped Stanford's record to 21-2.
"We were really pleased we
could bounce back," freshman
Sandra Birch said. "If you lose
you can get so dejected that you
don't play well the next day. We
used it as motivation to beat
USC."
"I thought that was wonder
ful," Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan said of Saturday's match.
"We proved we could come back.
And of course the only way you
can come back is to lose one."
And lose one is precisely what
the Cardinal did Friday. Stanford
had beaten the Bruins twice pre
viously this season, and Brennan
was almost certain that his team
would pull off the hat trick.
"I don't know if shocked is the
right word. We were surprised,"
Brennan said, referring to the
Cardinal's reaction after being up
set by UCLA. After pausing, he
added, "Yeah, I guess we were
shocked."
The Bruins were led by a pair
of freshmen Friday. Kirsten
Dreyer blanked a baffled Teri
Whitlinger, and Jessica Emmons
swept Cardinal sophomore Lisa
Green 6-4, 6-4 in the No. 2 con
test.
Stanford received strong per
formances once again from fresh
men Tami Whitlinger and Sandra
Birch and senior Kay Tittle. But
UCLA achieved a split in the
singles when Catherine O'Meara
outlasted junior Cindy
Buchsbaum 6-2, 0-6, 6-1 in the

No. 6 match.
The Bruins took the Cardinal
out quickly in doubles. In the No.
2 contest, Emmons and Joni Ur
ban knocked off Green and Tittle
6-4, 6-4.
Birch and Buchsbaum, playing
together for the first time, hung
tough for a set against Dreyer
and Maria LaFranchi, but the
UCLA tandem clinched the team
victory with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 win
at No. 3 doubles.
Saturday, the Cardinal restored
order as all three players that had
lost against UCLA won their
singles matches. "I'm always par
ticularly happy when a loser on
Friday comes back and wins Sat
urday," Brennan said. "You never
like to see somebody lose two in
a row."
Brennan was most pleased with
the victories posted by Buchs
baum and Teri Whitlinger.
Buchsbaum won a close first set
and then coasted in the second
set en route to a 7-6, 6-1 win over
the Trojans' Ginny Purdy. Her
victory was a relief for the Car
dinal, which has yet to find a
consistent No. 6 player.
"It was really great for Cindy
and great for the team," the Car
dinal coach said. "It's kind of nice
not to have to give one away."
Ten Whitlinger looked to be in
trouble again after dropping the
first set of the No. 3 singles
against USC's Anya Kochoff. But
even though she was still strug
gling, Whitlinger rallied for a 2-6,
6-3, 6-3 win that clinched the
team victory for Stanford.
"She still didn't play really
well," Brennan said. "What she
needed at that point was a win.
It waa ugly, but it was a win."
