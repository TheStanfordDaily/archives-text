# Preliminary results show BSU in trouble
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Editorial staff 
Support for the Black Stu
dent Union declined sharply in
last week's ASSU elections, ac
cording to preliminary election
results that show only 51 per
cent of voters support its fee
request.
With about 500 ballots left
to count, the margin of ap
proval for the BSU's $24,419
fee request stands at only 74
votes. Usually, the fee request
is approved by a large margin
— 60 to 70 percent — accord
ing to BSU Chair Bill King.
Elections Commissioner
Steve Baer, a senior, said
tabulation of the remaining
500 ballots is expected today.
Calling the number of "yes"
votes "the lowest ever" for the
BSU, King said the results
"probably indicate a reaction
to the way that the BSU has
been acting."
The BSU's charges of racism

in the ASSU Senate two weeks
ago resulted in a negative po
litical backlash that is likely
the cause of the biggest anti-
BSU vote in years.
King said that negative
publicity and increased
visibility this year are factors
that may have reduced public
support for the organization,
which advocates the concerns
of the black community.
King cited a Nov. 17 "Bug
Me" column in The Daily as a
particular blow. The column
asserted that being black was
a precondition for BSU mem
bership.
King added that Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons
"didn't help us" when he said
he would investigate the BSU's
policies as a result of the affair.
"It was an indictment, real
ly," said King, who added that
later efforts to clarify the con
troversy did not receive as much
attention. "It's always true that
negative coverage gets more at
tention."
King said his appearance before
the senate on behalf of students
who alleged that race played a
role in its appointments process
just one week before the elections
might also have had a negative
effect on the outcome.
"As [BSU] chair, I have to go
in and lean on [the senate] if stu
dents have grievances," he said.
"I'm not supposed to question
whether this is the best time or
if it will hurt the BSU." Racism
is a dangerous word, King said,
but he insisted that he "will not
back down" if he hears allegations
of racism without finding ev
idence refuting the charge.

He said the nature of the BSU
is to be an organization "that
speaks for students with a bone
to pick, and that's not popular."
The BSU often serves as "a lightn
ing rod" for grievances, King said.
King also cited increased
visibility, including the BSU's role
in the movement to amend the
Area One requirement, as a pos
sible reason for the decline in stu
dent support. "By becoming
visible, there's always that fear
of disapproval."
King stressed that if the BSU
loses its assessment, many other
groups will be affected because it
funds various activities and public
service projects for the whole
black community.
Loss of the fee assessment will
force the BSU to request funding
every two months through the
ASSU discretionary fee cycle — a
process King says will make op
eration much more difficult. "It's
a lot easier to defend the philos

ophy of our organization once a
year rather than every two
months. It will make things go
much slower," he said.
