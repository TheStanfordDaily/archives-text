# Card pitchers lead the way; Stanford in 2nd
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES -
Paul Carey knew
what was coming.
When UCLA
reliever John Dis
hon ran the count
to 1-1 against

Carey in the 12th inning yester
day at Jackie Robinson Stadium,
Stanford's sophomore right
fielder knew what the next pitch
would be.
"We faced him (Dishon) Friday
night, and had a chart on him,"
Carey said. "Before 1 went up to
bat against him, the coaches told
me that he throws 100 percent
fastballs on the first pitch and
when he's behind or even in the
count. So when he went 1-1, I
knew he was coming in with the
fastball. That helped a lot."
Carey turned on Dishon's high
fastball and rerouted it over the
center-field fence for a three-run
homer that broke open a 2-2 tie
and gave the Cardinal a 5-2 lead.
Stanford junior reliever Steve
Chitren then shut down the
Bruins in the bottom of the 12th
to complete a pitching master
piece that freshman Stan Spencer
had begun. Chitren got the win
to improve his record to 4-4.
Stanford lost to the Bruins 9-4
on Friday and won 8-5 Saturday.
Yesterday's win keeps the Cardi
nal in the thick of a very thick
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division race.
Stanford, now 28-14 on the
season and 12-8 in conference
play, is in second place in the
Six-Pac after the weekend's play,
one-and-a-half games behind
first-place Arizona State (14-7 in
the conference). The streaking
Sun Devils swept California in
Berkeley to extend their winning
streak to 23 games and push the
Golden Bears (11-10) into third
place. USC, meanwhile, dropped
two of three to last-place Arizona
to fall to 10-10 in Six-Pac play, a
half-game behind Cal.
The Cardinal remains in Los

Angeles to play USC at 1 p.m.
today in the make-up of a game
that was rained out earlier in the
year. A win today would pull Stan
ford to within a game of ASU
going into a three-game series
against the Sun Devils at Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
Although Carey's home run was
one of three homers for Stanford
yesterday, hitting was not the big
story for the Cardinal.
"Pitching — that's all you can
say," Carey said. "It's a big dif
ference when you're behind and
they (the pitchers) shut them
down."
Indeed, Spencer threw a mar
velous game and Chitren turned
in his finest performance of the
season. Spencer went TVs innings,
giving up six hits and two runs,
striking out six and walking two.
Chitren went 4% innings,
giving up two hits and no runs,
striking out four and walking
none. It was the closest he has
come this year to his scintillating
form of 1987, when he won eight
games and saved 13.
"I had really good stuff,"
Chitren said. "I finally found my
groove. ... I hope this will be a
turning point. It sounds funny,
but I was just thinking less than
I have all year. ... I was just let
ting the ability take over."
Stanford's hitters, meanwhile,
just let the power take over. Un
able to put singles together to
score runs, the Cardinal went to
the long ball.
The Bruins scored first, on a
double by Mannie Adams and an
RBI single by Mike Hankins in
the second inning.
The score remained 1-0 through
six, as UCLA starter Mike Fyhrie
and Spencer battled. The Cardinal
stranded two runners in the fifth,
and loaded the bases with one out
in the sixth, only to come up
empty when Carey hit into an
inning-ending double play.
Having haa enough of that non
sense, Doug Bobbins led off the
seventh with a solo home run to
left to tie the score. It was the
senior's sixth homer of the year.

An inning later, junior Ed
Sprague went the other way with
a pitch from reliever Dave Zan
canaro, ripping his 14th homer of
the year to give the Cardinal a
2-1 lead.
UCLA was far from dead, how
ever. Robbie Katzaroff led off the
bottom of the eighth with a single
into right, and went to second on
a sacrifice bunt by Charlie Fiacco.
Chitren came on in relief of Spen
cer, and hit Eric Karros with his
first pitch to put men on first and
second with one out. Scott Cline
doubled into the left-center gap
to score Katzaroff and move Kar
ros to second. Chitren walked Joe
James intentionally to load the
bases.
With Jeff Osborn up, the Bruins
ran the suicide squeeze. Karros
charged from third, but Osborn
popped his bunt way up in the
air off to the right of and behind
the mound.
Junior first baseman Ron Wit
meyer gloved the ball but
stumbled as he did so. He
regained his balance in time to
throw to Sprague at third and
double up Karros, who was way
down the line by the time Wit
meyer made the catch.
Chitren said he was surprised
that the heavy-hitting Bruins
went for the squeeze in that sit
uation. "With a team like UCLA,
you'd think they'd go to swing
ing," he said. "As it turned out,
it picked me up in a tough spot."
In the 12th, Witmeyer singled
to left with one out and Sprague
drew a walk from reliever John
Sutherland to set up Carey's
game-winning home run off Dis
hon. It was Carey's third home
run of the year.
If pitching and the long ball
won yesterday's game, then it was
pitching and "little ball" that won
the game on Saturday.
Stanford fans couldn't help but
have a profound «ense of deja vu
for that second game.
On Friday night, the Bruins
had scored five times in the first
off senior starter Lee Plemel.
UCLA's inning looked like this:

single, single, single, walk, grand
slam. Score: 5-1. Plemel out.
Game over. Stanford collected 10
hits, but never got the big inning
it needed.
It looked like things would
repeat themselves on Saturday.
Cardinal starter Mike Mussina
was cruising along until the third.
Then Bobby Holley singled to
start the inning, stole second and
scored on Mike Hankins' double
into the left-field corner. With two
outs, Charlie Fiacco beat out a
bad-hop infield single. Karros and
Cline ripped back-to-back home
runs and suddenly the score was
5-1, just like the night before.
But that was all the scoring for
UCLA. While the Cardinal batters
continued to sputter, the fresh

man Mussina held the line.
"I had confidence that if I held
them at five (runs), we could come
back," Mussina said.
He did just that, and the Car
dinal began making noises in the
sixth. With two outs, Sprague
lined a long single off the right
field wall, and went to second on
Robbins' single. Carey brought
Sprague in with a single up the
middle to make the score 5-2.
Indeed, the Cardinal finally got
the big inning it was looking for
in the seventh. Sophomore Tim
Griffin led off with a bouncer into
left field. DeGraw sent a liner
slicing into the left-field corner,
and when the ball glanced off Kat
zarofTs glove, Griffin ended up at
third, with DeGraw at second and

no outs.
With one out, sophomore Troy
Paulsen, who extended his hitting
streak to 21 games yesterday,
brought Griffin in with a hard
single to left, making the score
5-3. A two-run triple into the
right-field corner by Witmeyer
tied the score, and after an inten
tional walk to Sprague, Robbins
bounced a single between third
and short to give Stanford the
lead at 6-5.
Mussina finished up to notch
the win, improving his record to
8-1 with his sixth complete game
of the season. He struck out five
and walked only one.
It was easily the Cardinal's best
comeback of the year.

meyer made the catch.
Chitren said he was surprised
that the heavy-hitting Bruins
went for the squeeze in that sit
uation. "With a team like UCLA,
you'd think they'd go to swing
ing," he said. "As it turned out,
it picked me up in a tough spot."
In the 12th, Witmeyer singled
to left with one out and Sprague
drew a walk from reliever John
Sutherland to set up Carey's
game-winning home run off Dis
hon. It was Carey's third home
run of the year.
If pitching and the long ball
won yesterday's game, then it was
pitching and "little ball" that won
the game on Saturday.
Stanford fans couldn't help but
have a profound «ense of deja vu
for that second game.
On Friday night, the Bruins
had scored five times in the first
off senior starter Lee Plemel.
UCLA's inning looked like this:

single, single, single, walk, grand
slam. Score: 5-1. Plemel out.
Game over. Stanford collected 10
hits, but never got the big inning
it needed.
It looked like things would
repeat themselves on Saturday.
Cardinal starter Mike Mussina
was cruising along until the third.
Then Bobby Holley singled to
start the inning, stole second and
scored on Mike Hankins' double
into the left-field corner. With two
outs, Charlie Fiacco beat out a
bad-hop infield single. Karros and
Cline ripped back-to-back home
runs and suddenly the score was
5-1, just like the night before.
But that was all the scoring for
UCLA. While the Cardinal batters
continued to sputter, the fresh

man Mussina held the line.
"I had confidence that if I held
them at five (runs), we could come
back," Mussina said.
He did just that, and the Car
dinal began making noises in the
sixth. With two outs, Sprague
lined a long single off the right
field wall, and went to second on
Robbins' single. Carey brought
Sprague in with a single up the
middle to make the score 5-2.
Indeed, the Cardinal finally got
the big inning it was looking for
in the seventh. Sophomore Tim
Griffin led off with a bouncer into
left field. DeGraw sent a liner
slicing into the left-field corner,
and when the ball glanced off Kat
zarofTs glove, Griffin ended up at
third, with DeGraw at second and

no outs.
With one out, sophomore Troy
Paulsen, who extended his hitting
streak to 21 games yesterday,
brought Griffin in with a hard
single to left, making the score
5-3. A two-run triple into the
right-field corner by Witmeyer
tied the score, and after an inten
tional walk to Sprague, Robbins
bounced a single between third
and short to give Stanford the
lead at 6-5.
Mussina finished up to notch
the win, improving his record to
8-1 with his sixth complete game
of the season. He struck out five
and walked only one.
It was easily the Cardinal's best
comeback of the year.

A big reason for the Cardinal's win Saturday was tha pitching of Steve Chltren. Chltren threw 4%
Innings of two-hit ball to set the scene for Paul Carey's 12th-lnnlng homer.
LOS ANGELES -
Paul Carey knew
what was coming.
When UCLA
reliever John Dis
hon ran the count
to 1-1 against

Carey in the 12th inning yester
day at Jackie Robinson Stadium,
Stanford's sophomore right
fielder knew what the next pitch
would be.
"We faced him (Dishon) Friday
night, and had a chart on him,"
Carey said. "Before 1 went up to
bat against him, the coaches told
me that he throws 100 percent
fastballs on the first pitch and
when he's behind or even in the
count. So when he went 1-1, I
knew he was coming in with the
fastball. That helped a lot."
Carey turned on Dishon's high
fastball and rerouted it over the
center-field fence for a three-run
homer that broke open a 2-2 tie
and gave the Cardinal a 5-2 lead.
Stanford junior reliever Steve
Chitren then shut down the
Bruins in the bottom of the 12th
to complete a pitching master
piece that freshman Stan Spencer
had begun. Chitren got the win
to improve his record to 4-4.
Stanford lost to the Bruins 9-4
on Friday and won 8-5 Saturday.
Yesterday's win keeps the Cardi
nal in the thick of a very thick
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division race.
Stanford, now 28-14 on the
season and 12-8 in conference
play, is in second place in the
Six-Pac after the weekend's play,
one-and-a-half games behind
first-place Arizona State (14-7 in
the conference). The streaking
Sun Devils swept California in
Berkeley to extend their winning
streak to 23 games and push the
Golden Bears (11-10) into third
place. USC, meanwhile, dropped
two of three to last-place Arizona
to fall to 10-10 in Six-Pac play, a
half-game behind Cal.
The Cardinal remains in Los

Angeles to play USC at 1 p.m.
today in the make-up of a game
that was rained out earlier in the
year. A win today would pull Stan
ford to within a game of ASU
going into a three-game series
against the Sun Devils at Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
Although Carey's home run was
one of three homers for Stanford
yesterday, hitting was not the big
story for the Cardinal.
"Pitching — that's all you can
say," Carey said. "It's a big dif
ference when you're behind and
they (the pitchers) shut them
down."
Indeed, Spencer threw a mar
velous game and Chitren turned
in his finest performance of the
season. Spencer went TVs innings,
giving up six hits and two runs,
striking out six and walking two.
Chitren went 4% innings,
giving up two hits and no runs,
striking out four and walking
none. It was the closest he has
come this year to his scintillating
form of 1987, when he won eight
games and saved 13.
"I had really good stuff,"
Chitren said. "I finally found my
groove. ... I hope this will be a
turning point. It sounds funny,
but I was just thinking less than
I have all year. ... I was just let
ting the ability take over."
Stanford's hitters, meanwhile,
just let the power take over. Un
able to put singles together to
score runs, the Cardinal went to
the long ball.
The Bruins scored first, on a
double by Mannie Adams and an
RBI single by Mike Hankins in
the second inning.
The score remained 1-0 through
six, as UCLA starter Mike Fyhrie
and Spencer battled. The Cardinal
stranded two runners in the fifth,
and loaded the bases with one out
in the sixth, only to come up
empty when Carey hit into an
inning-ending double play.
Having haa enough of that non
sense, Doug Bobbins led off the
seventh with a solo home run to
left to tie the score. It was the
senior's sixth homer of the year.

An inning later, junior Ed
Sprague went the other way with
a pitch from reliever Dave Zan
canaro, ripping his 14th homer of
the year to give the Cardinal a
2-1 lead.
UCLA was far from dead, how
ever. Robbie Katzaroff led off the
bottom of the eighth with a single
into right, and went to second on
a sacrifice bunt by Charlie Fiacco.
Chitren came on in relief of Spen
cer, and hit Eric Karros with his
first pitch to put men on first and
second with one out. Scott Cline
doubled into the left-center gap
to score Katzaroff and move Kar
ros to second. Chitren walked Joe
James intentionally to load the
bases.
With Jeff Osborn up, the Bruins
ran the suicide squeeze. Karros
charged from third, but Osborn
popped his bunt way up in the
air off to the right of and behind
the mound.
Junior first baseman Ron Wit
meyer gloved the ball but
stumbled as he did so. He
regained his balance in time to
throw to Sprague at third and
double up Karros, who was way
down the line by the time Wit
meyer made the catch.
Chitren said he was surprised
that the heavy-hitting Bruins
went for the squeeze in that sit
uation. "With a team like UCLA,
you'd think they'd go to swing

place. USC, meanwhile, dropped
two of three to last-place Arizona
to fall to 10-10 in Six-Pac play, a
half-game behind Cal.
The Cardinal remains in Los

Angeles to play USC at 1 p.m.
today in the make-up of a game
that was rained out earlier in the
year. A win today would pull Stan
ford to within a game of ASU
going into a three-game series
against the Sun Devils at Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
Although Carey's home run was
one of three homers for Stanford
yesterday, hitting was not the big
story for the Cardinal.
"Pitching — that's all you can
say," Carey said. "It's a big dif
ference when you're behind and
they (the pitchers) shut them
down."
Indeed, Spencer threw a mar
velous game and Chitren turned
in his finest performance of the
season. Spencer went TVs innings,
giving up six hits and two runs,
striking out six and walking two.
Chitren went 4% innings,
giving up two hits and no runs,
striking out four and walking
none. It was the closest he has
come this year to his scintillating
form of 1987, when he won eight
games and saved 13.
"I had really good stuff,"
Chitren said. "I finally found my
groove. ... I hope this will be a
turning point. It sounds funny,
but I was just thinking less than
I have all year. ... I was just let
ting the ability take over."
Stanford's hitters, meanwhile,
just let the power take over. Un
able to put singles together to
score runs, the Cardinal went to
the long ball.
The Bruins scored first, on a
double by Mannie Adams and an
RBI single by Mike Hankins in
the second inning.
The score remained 1-0 through
six, as UCLA starter Mike Fyhrie
and Spencer battled. The Cardinal
stranded two runners in the fifth,
and loaded the bases with one out
in the sixth, only to come up
empty when Carey hit into an
inning-ending double play.
Having haa enough of that non
sense, Doug Bobbins led off the
seventh with a solo home run to
left to tie the score. It was the
senior's sixth homer of the year.

An inning later, junior Ed
Sprague went the other way with
a pitch from reliever Dave Zan
canaro, ripping his 14th homer of
the year to give the Cardinal a
2-1 lead.
UCLA was far from dead, how
ever. Robbie Katzaroff led off the
bottom of the eighth with a single
into right, and went to second on
a sacrifice bunt by Charlie Fiacco.
Chitren came on in relief of Spen
cer, and hit Eric Karros with his
first pitch to put men on first and
second with one out. Scott Cline
doubled into the left-center gap
to score Katzaroff and move Kar
ros to second. Chitren walked Joe
James intentionally to load the
bases.
With Jeff Osborn up, the Bruins
ran the suicide squeeze. Karros
charged from third, but Osborn
popped his bunt way up in the
air off to the right of and behind
the mound.
Junior first baseman Ron Wit
meyer gloved the ball but
stumbled as he did so. He
regained his balance in time to
throw to Sprague at third and
double up Karros, who was way
down the line by the time Wit
meyer made the catch.
Chitren said he was surprised
that the heavy-hitting Bruins
went for the squeeze in that sit
uation. "With a team like UCLA,
you'd think they'd go to swing
ing," he said. "As it turned out,
it picked me up in a tough spot."
In the 12th, Witmeyer singled
to left with one out and Sprague
drew a walk from reliever John
Sutherland to set up Carey's
game-winning home run off Dis
hon. It was Carey's third home
run of the year.
If pitching and the long ball
won yesterday's game, then it was
pitching and "little ball" that won
the game on Saturday.
Stanford fans couldn't help but
have a profound «ense of deja vu
for that second game.
On Friday night, the Bruins
had scored five times in the first
off senior starter Lee Plemel.
UCLA's inning looked like this:

single, single, single, walk, grand
slam. Score: 5-1. Plemel out.
Game over. Stanford collected 10
hits, but never got the big inning
it needed.
It looked like things would
repeat themselves on Saturday.
Cardinal starter Mike Mussina
was cruising along until the third.
Then Bobby Holley singled to
start the inning, stole second and
scored on Mike Hankins' double
into the left-field corner. With two
outs, Charlie Fiacco beat out a
bad-hop infield single. Karros and
Cline ripped back-to-back home
runs and suddenly the score was
5-1, just like the night before.
But that was all the scoring for
UCLA. While the Cardinal batters
continued to sputter, the fresh

man Mussina held the line.
"I had confidence that if I held
them at five (runs), we could come
back," Mussina said.
He did just that, and the Car
dinal began making noises in the
sixth. With two outs, Sprague
lined a long single off the right
field wall, and went to second on
Robbins' single. Carey brought
Sprague in with a single up the
middle to make the score 5-2.
Indeed, the Cardinal finally got
the big inning it was looking for
in the seventh. Sophomore Tim
Griffin led off with a bouncer into
left field. DeGraw sent a liner
slicing into the left-field corner,
and when the ball glanced off Kat
zarofTs glove, Griffin ended up at
third, with DeGraw at second and

no outs.
With one out, sophomore Troy
Paulsen, who extended his hitting
streak to 21 games yesterday,
brought Griffin in with a hard
single to left, making the score
5-3. A two-run triple into the
right-field corner by Witmeyer
tied the score, and after an inten
tional walk to Sprague, Robbins
bounced a single between third
and short to give Stanford the
lead at 6-5.
Mussina finished up to notch
the win, improving his record to
8-1 with his sixth complete game
of the season. He struck out five
and walked only one.
It was easily the Cardinal's best
comeback of the year.

A big reason for the Cardinal's win Saturday was tha pitching of Steve Chltren. Chltren threw 4%
Innings of two-hit ball to set the scene for Paul Carey's 12th-lnnlng homer.
