# Matzek places second on rings to lead gymnasts

### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
LINCOLN, Neb.
— Striving to en
ter the rarefied at
mosphere of col
legiate gymnastics'
elite, the Stanford
men's gymnastics

team learned this weekend what
it means to come right up to the
doorstep of a dream but never get
in the door.
"Never has doing so well hurt
so much," senior co-captain
Randy Besosa said Saturday after
a weekend of success that brought
little reward. "I mean our team
kicked, but we came in fourth,
one place out of the finals. But
we have nothing to be ashamed
of. We performed so well, but we
were a hair out; that hurt."
The Cardinal entered the week
end's NCAA Championships in
Lincoln looking to establish the
Stanford program with at least a
top-three finish, knowing that if
everything went perfectly it could
take the title. But the final leader
board after Friday night's team
finals showed host Nebraska on
top with a national-record score
of 288.15, edging Illinois (287.15)
and trouncing UCLA (285.15).
The highly discriminating Fate of
college gymnastics refused to in
vite Stanford into its top ranks.
Nevertheless, although they
had to keep reminding them

selves, the Cardinal gymnasts per
formed admirably. "I can't say
we're disappointed," senior co
captain Mike Matzek said. "We
have no regrets about what we've
done. If you look at basketball,
making the Final Four is every
coach's dream, and we've done
that."
Matzek was a sophomore on the
1986 Cardinal squad that took
third at the national meet. He
won All-America honors with a
second place finish in Saturday
night's event finals, taking second
in the rings. His 9.775 score, .025
points from the gold, typified
Stanford's just-miss weekend.
Although two steps on his land
ing had stolen a gold medal from
Matzek, he felt he had ended his
collegiate career on a positive
note.
"I'm still an All-American," he
said, "that's been one of my
dreams (since I was a kid)."
Besosa, Matzek, senior Chuck
Gerardo and sophomore Conrad
Voorsanger all qualified for a shot
at the all-around individual title
by virtue of their optional scores
in Thursday night's team prelim
inaries. After Saturday after
noon's compulsories, all four
found themselves among the
country's top 15 collegians.
Once again, however, despite
the excellence, there was disap
pointment for Stanford. Besosa
missed Ail-American status by .05
points, finishing just that tremble

of a score behind the sixth-place
finisher.
Voorsanger took All-America
honors in the parallel bars with
a sixth-place finish in that event's
finals. In the all-around only one
true sophomore, UCLA's Chris
Waller, performed better than
sophomore Voorsanger's 15th
place finish. Matzek took 12th in
the all-around and Gerardo took
14th. Houston Baptist's 21-year
old sophomore Spaniards Miguel
Rubio and Alfonso Rodriguez took
first and second, respectively.
In the 46 years that the NCAA
meet has been held, four teams
— Illinois, Nebraska, Southern Il
linois and Penn State — have
taken over half of the national
championship and runner-up
trophies.
Collegiate gymnastics, then, is
not friendly territory for upstarts.
Dynasties rule. Over the past nine
years, UCLA or Nebraska has
been champion or runner-up 13
times. That's left only one spot
for non-dynasties in most of the
recent championships. It is not
especially refreshing that eight
time champ Illinois, led by a
junior and two freshmen, was this
season's infiltrator.
For 16 years, Sadao Hamada
has been the Cardinal head coach,
fighting the dynasty trend, and
despite Stanford's tough admis
sions standards, Hamada's pro
gram has cracked the ice and may
soon break it.

a weekend of success that brought
little reward. "I mean our team
kicked, but we came in fourth,
one place out of the finals. But
we have nothing to be ashamed
of. We performed so well, but we
were a hair out; that hurt."
The Cardinal entered the week
end's NCAA Championships in
Lincoln looking to establish the
Stanford program with at least a
top-three finish, knowing that if
everything went perfectly it could
take the title. But the final leader
board after Friday night's team
finals showed host Nebraska on
top with a national-record score
of 288.15, edging Illinois (287.15)
and trouncing UCLA (285.15).
The highly discriminating Fate of
college gymnastics refused to in
vite Stanford into its top ranks.
Nevertheless, although they
had to keep reminding them

selves, the Cardinal gymnasts per
formed admirably. "I can't say
we're disappointed," senior co
captain Mike Matzek said. "We
have no regrets about what we've
done. If you look at basketball,
making the Final Four is every
coach's dream, and we've done
that."
Matzek was a sophomore on the
1986 Cardinal squad that took
third at the national meet. He
won All-America honors with a
second place finish in Saturday
night's event finals, taking second
in the rings. His 9.775 score, .025
points from the gold, typified
Stanford's just-miss weekend.
Although two steps on his land
ing had stolen a gold medal from
Matzek, he felt he had ended his
collegiate career on a positive
note.
"I'm still an All-American," he
said, "that's been one of my
dreams (since I was a kid)."
Besosa, Matzek, senior Chuck
Gerardo and sophomore Conrad
Voorsanger all qualified for a shot
at the all-around individual title
by virtue of their optional scores
in Thursday night's team prelim
inaries. After Saturday after
noon's compulsories, all four
found themselves among the
country's top 15 collegians.
Once again, however, despite
the excellence, there was disap
pointment for Stanford. Besosa
missed Ail-American status by .05
points, finishing just that tremble

of a score behind the sixth-place
finisher.
Voorsanger took All-America
honors in the parallel bars with
a sixth-place finish in that event's
finals. In the all-around only one
true sophomore, UCLA's Chris
Waller, performed better than
sophomore Voorsanger's 15th
place finish. Matzek took 12th in
the all-around and Gerardo took
14th. Houston Baptist's 21-year
old sophomore Spaniards Miguel
Rubio and Alfonso Rodriguez took
first and second, respectively.
In the 46 years that the NCAA
meet has been held, four teams
— Illinois, Nebraska, Southern Il
linois and Penn State — have
taken over half of the national
championship and runner-up
trophies.
Collegiate gymnastics, then, is
not friendly territory for upstarts.
Dynasties rule. Over the past nine
years, UCLA or Nebraska has
been champion or runner-up 13
times. That's left only one spot
for non-dynasties in most of the
recent championships. It is not
especially refreshing that eight
time champ Illinois, led by a
junior and two freshmen, was this
season's infiltrator.
For 16 years, Sadao Hamada
has been the Cardinal head coach,
fighting the dynasty trend, and
despite Stanford's tough admis
sions standards, Hamada's pro
gram has cracked the ice and may
soon break it.
