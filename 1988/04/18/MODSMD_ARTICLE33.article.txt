# Cardinal struggles against top crews
## 
### Don Hogue Staff writer 
Despite less
than ideal
weather Satur
day and a disap
pointing finish
for the host
Stanford crew,

ihe Redwood Shores-Stanford
Rowing Classic proved the Bay
Area can play host to the na
tion's best.
Defending national cham
pion Harvard took the men's
varsity-eight title, defeating
Wisconsin in yesterday's cham
pionship race with the regatta's
fastest time.
Harvard, using a shell bor
rowed from Orange Coast Col
lege, led by as much as two
boat-lengths over Redwood
Shores' 2,000-meter course.
Harvard had defeated Wash
ington and UCLA during Sat
urday's heats.
The Washington women,
who have garnered six of the
past seven national titles,
surged in the final 150 meters
against Brown to claim their
second consecutive women's
varsity title. Brown had led the
majority of the race, but the
Huskies initiated a late surge
that went unchallenged.
"It's tough to come from be
hind in a dual race when you're
behind by three-quarters of a
length at the mid-point,"
Washington Coach Jan Har
ville said.
Stanford's varsity men
dropped Saturday's heats to
Penn and California by close
margins. "We had set our
sights high to race against the
best crews," Stanford Men's
Coach Ken Dreyfuss said, "but,
when we have high goals, we
have to be prepared to be dis
appointed."
Stanford rebounded yester
day with an impressive victory
over Washington. At 1,500
meters, Stanford had opened a
considerable lead which was
never relinquished. The vic
tory, Stanford's first against
the Huskies in a dual race sit
uation, gave Stanford's men a
1-2 regatta record.
Senior Jim Fox noted that
Stanford's disappointing
finishes Saturday to Penn and

California prompted a change
in strategy against Washing
ton. "We had to battle ahead
early and not rely as much
upon a sprint at the end," Fox
said. "As long as I've been here,
we've never beaten a mayor
crew in a big crew race."
The regatta was also the
final competition at Redwood
Shores for Stanford's seniors,
making the victory over Wash
ington more significant, ac
cording to senior captain Craig
Bouck.
Stanford's women, however,
didn't fare as well. Stanford
dropped its opening heat
against Brown Saturday morn
ing. Then, in the afternoon
heat, UCLA edged the Cardinal
by a mere .12 seconds in one
of the regatta's closest finishes.
Stanford had maintained a one
to two-seat lead throughout the
first half of the race, but UCLA
closed the gap at 1,200 meters.
The boats were deadlocked
coming into the finish, but
UCLA prevailed on the final
stroke of the race.
"That's boat racing," said
Stanford Women's Coach John
Davis. "At the finish we were
on the catch and UCLA was
on the release. It was a tough
race â€” one that's hard for
either team to lose." Stanford
lost yesterday's final heat to
California, finishing the
regatta with a disappointing 0-
3 record.
"It's frustrating," junior
Christie May said. "It's hard
to keep the momentum up for
three races. J.D. [Davis] was
very supportive and didn't let
us get down on ourselves."
Davis did keep an optimistic
outlook for the rest of Stan
ford's season, which includes
the Stanford-Cal Big Row in
two weeks. "We're a young
boat," he said. "Our goal is not
necessarily to win all of our
races, but to go faster. If we
keep getting faster, the vic
tories will come."
Stanford's men's and wom
en's junior varsity crews
finished with 1-2 records. The
men defeated UCLA and the
women defeated California in
Saturday afternoon heats. The
novice women finished with a
1-1 ledger, and the novice men
lost both of their heats.
