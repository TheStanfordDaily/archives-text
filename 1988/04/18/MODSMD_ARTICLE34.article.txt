# Spikers tossed by the Waves

You can only ride
the Waves for so
long.
The Stanford
men's volleyball
team rode all over
the No. 6 Pepper-

dine Waves for two games Satur

day night at Maples Pavilion, but
then wiped out in the final three
games, eventually losing 5-15, 13-
15, 15-10, 15-8, 15-10.
With the loss, Stanford slipped
to 10-18 (4-12 in the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion), while the Waves, who upped
their slate to 13-12 (9-8), moved
one step closer to claiming the
conference's fifth and final playoff

spot.
The Cardinal played the first
two games like a team possessed,
hitting at a phenomenal .484 clip
in the first game while shutting
down Pepperdine's offense. Jun
ior outside hitter Randy
Bergstedt, who came in as the
Waves' top gun with a .378 hitting
average, was held to just one kill
in the first game and more often
than not had his spikes put right
back in his face by the Cardinal
blockers.
"That's probably the worst I've
played all year," Bergstedt said.
"They (Stanford) were blocking
really well."
The blocking attack was led by
Cardinal sophomore middle
blocker Dan Hanan, who finished
with a match-high seven blocks
and 11 digs. Hanan was also the
focus of the Stanford offense, tal
lying 17 kills in the first two
games and converting 10 straight
sets at one point.
"Pepperdine wasn't keying on
me too much at the start," Hanan
said. "They were putting one
blocker on me, and when there's
only one blocker there I can
usually put it away."
With the score 6-5 Stanford in
the first game, Hanan blocked
Bergstedt to make it 7-5, and after
three kills by Cardinal middle
blocker Craig Forsyth and three
Pepperdine errors, the score was
13-5. Forsyth, a sophomore,
finished with 16 kills and a siz
zling .448 hitting mark.
"Stanford played really well in
the first two games," Pepperdine
Coach Rod Wilde said. "They had
very, very consistent defense and
passing. It's tough to get on track
when they're playing like that.
The great defense gets you frus
trated."
Hanan and Co. continued
thrashing at the start of the sec
ond game, jumping out to a 9-4
lead, but the Waves mounted a
comeback as their offense finally
sputtered into gear. Bergstedt,
who finished the match with a
sub-par .229 hitting percentage,
found the mark with four spikes
during a 9-2 Pepperdine run as
the Waves took a 13-11 lead.
But then the Cardinal came
right back. Two kills by senior
outside hitter Mark Amstutz
(who, along with freshman out
side hitter John Alstrom, finished
with a team-high 24 kills) and
one by Hanan to make it 14-13
Stanford.
After several sideouts, Cardinal
senior David Look recorded his
first kill of the match to give the

game and a 2-0 lead to Stanford.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal
spikers, however, the tide was
about to turn. Hanan, who had
10 game-two kills, would put away
only five more the rest of the
match as Pepperdine's blockers
began to come to life.
"They started putting two and
three blockers on me, and they
also picked up their offense a bit,"
Hanan said. "All of a sudden we
couldn't stop them."
The Waves started rolling be
hind the hitting of sophomore
middle blocker Robert Keller, who
tallied eight of his team-high 23
kills in the third game. With the
score 4-1 Stanford, Keller put two
spikes down to start a 12-0 sprint.
The Cardinal battled back to 13-
10, but a Keller spike and a Stan
ford hitting error gave the game
and momentum to the Waves.
"We had several chances to
come back (in the game), and we
just couldn't do it," Amstutz said.
"Those are the key times. Those
chances to convert are the most
important, and we just didn't
capitalize on them.
"We had them shut off at the
start, but they adjusted after the
first two games," Amstutz contin
ued. "They went from hitting it
down the lines to more inside
plays."
The Waves again swamped
Stanford in the fourth game, as
the Cardinal hitting percentage
sunk to an abysmal .083. The
Waves poured it on at the start
of the fifth game to take an 8-1
lead, but the Cardinal began a
comeback of their own. Behind
the hitting of Alstrom and
Amstutz, Stanford battled back
and got as close as 11-9, but no
closer, as a Bergstedt kill ended
the match.
"You've got to hand it to Pep
perdine," Amstutz said. "They
made the changes when they had
to, and it paid off."

Sophomore Craig Forsyth tallied 16 kills and a .448 hitting per
centage, but it was not enough to carry the Cardinal past the
fifth-ranked Pepperdine Waves Saturday night.
