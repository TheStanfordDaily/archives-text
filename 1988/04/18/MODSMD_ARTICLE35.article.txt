### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Washington
Huskies brought
bad weather with
them to Stanford
Stadium Saturday,
nearly washing out
the Cardinal in the

Stanford Track and Field Classic.
In the end, however, neither the
Huskies nor the rain slowed the
performances of many of Stan
ford's top guns.
Marc Olesen was the biggest
star for Stanford, breaking the
school 1,500-meter record with a
time of 3 minutes, 40.82 seconds.
Freshman Chris Rae took out the
early pace, bringing the pack
through 800 meters in 1:57, at
which point Olesen took control.
Olesen looked strong all the way
to the line, outkicking former
Stanford star Brian Pettingill,
who was competing as an open
athlete.
Several hot match-ups fizzled
in the dreary cold. Junior Lisa

Bernhagen easily flew to a win in
her home opener in the high jump
at 5 feet, 10-3/4 inches, but did
hit her usual six-foot plateau. In
the men's high jump, Rick Noji
of Washington beat senior Brian
Marshall at just under seven feet
in an event featuring four men
who have broken the seven-foot
barrier.
The men's javelin was strongly
contested as Washington's Darryl
Roberson beat out Stanford senior
Dave Pickett by adding 20 feet to
his season's best. Pickett set a
new personal best at 233-11, but
Roberson went a spectatular 241-
3.
The women's field events were
the mtgor disapointment for Stan
ford. Junior Erica Wheeler had
an unusual off day, fouling several
times and winding up more than
20 feet from her usual range and
in second place.
Stanford did gain one new
Pacific 10 Conference Champion
ship qualifier as senior Steve
Schadler made the time in the
5,000 meters.
