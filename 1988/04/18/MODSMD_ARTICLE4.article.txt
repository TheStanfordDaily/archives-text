# USW charges abuse in firing
## 
### Liz Lempert Susan McKean Staff writers 
In what local union leaders are
calling the worst case of labor ex
ploitation in years, an employee
in the Mechanical Engineering
Department was fired Tuesday
after the United Stanford
Workers union intervened in or
der to remedy the "questionable"
terms of his employment.

According to the University,
Long Quach was fired from his
job as a lab technician because he
was unqualified for his duties.
The USW, however, contends
that Quach was required to per
form tasks he was not hired to
perform and that were technically
more advanced than could be ex
pected of a "miscellaneous service
worker," as Quach's job was titled
in a Campus Report job listing.
In addition, the USW claims he

was underpaid and verbally har
rassed by his supervisor, Michael
Castellanos.
Castellanos and a personnel
representative for the Mechanical
Engineering Department, Kathy
Davis, both refused to comment
on the matter.
Quach was paid $7.50 per hour
for repairing power supplies and
temperature controls in Mechan-
ical Engineering laboratories, but
according to USW officials he
should have been receiving $16.50
per hour for such work because
his job title was incorrect.
Before Quach was fired, the
USW submitted a grievance on
his behalf to the University de
manding higher pay, back pay and
recognition as a union worker.
Quach is not a member of the
USW.
Now Quach, a Chinese im
migrant who speaks English poor
ly, hopes he can 3imply get his
job back or a similar job in an
other department.
But the grievance process is
slow, and according to both Uni
versity and USW officials, almost

400 grievances await hearing
before Quach's.
Michael Vartain — a staff at
torney in the University Legal Of
fice and Stanford's press repre
sentative for the case — said he
doubted that the University acted
incorrectly and predicted the
grievance procedure will probably
take less than four weeks to com
plete.
"Anytime someone is ter
minated the University treats it
seriously, but this case is not un
usual," Vartain said.
Barnett argued that the Uni
versity breached its contract with
the USW by failing to alert the
union of Quach's employment,
thereby avoiding implementation
of contract-determined pay scales.
Under this contract, the Univer
sity is supposed to notify the USW
of any job openings that fall under
union protection, as well as list

them in Campus Report.
However, Campus Report did
print a notice of Quach's employ
ment when he officially became a
permanent worker in December.
"I don't know how they can say
they didn't know about Quach's
hiring," Vartain said.
Quach said he was hired in
March 1987 as a permanent
worker, but was informed two
weeks later he was only tempo
rary.
Barnett said the position Quach
thought he was hired for is a per
manent position protected by the
USW and defined under the
University-USW contract rules.
However, Quach was never told
about the union and the union
was not notified of Quach's em
ployment until this January,
when his name appeared on a
1,300-name computer print-out.
"Nobody told Quach what his

rights were, which is usually the
responsibility of the department,"
Barnett said. Now the union
hopes to restore Quach to his po
sition on a payscale that is appro
priate for his work.
Barnett said Quach was origi
nally hired in March for 20 hours
per week, although his time card
for his first two weeks on the job
shows he was not paid overtime
for 56 overtime hours, which is
required by law.
Likewise, in the year that
Quach has worked here he has
only taken four hours of sick time,
and has had no paid holidays.
Vartain maintained that the
University had not mistreated
Quach. "I would be very surprised
if Quach wasn't paid the correct
wages and benefits. If not, [the
situation] would be corrected in
a matter of due course," Vartain
said.
