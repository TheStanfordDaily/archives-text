More asbestos was discovered
last week in the kitchen of Tres

Health and Safety, said the as

ranked at a level equal to many
other buildings on campus.
Currently, six buildings in the
Quad are being surveyed for as
bestos, bringing to one-third the
total number of campus buildings

that have been checked out.
All University buildings have
been ranked on the amount of
visible asbestos, the level of as
bestos in the air and other factors.
Tresidder had been ranked in the
high 50s on a scale ranging from

However, Bramlett admitted
the ranking will have to be re
