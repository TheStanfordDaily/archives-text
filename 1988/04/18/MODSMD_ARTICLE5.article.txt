# More Tresidder asbestos found
## Union may plead case for kitchen worker with lung cancer 
### Pia Ali-Salaam Susan McKean 
More asbestos was discovered
last week in the kitchen of Tres
idder Union, raising questions
about the University's handling
of campuswide asbestos inspec
tions.
Meanwhile, the United Stan
ford Workers union moved to help
a non-union Tresidder employee
who has terminal cancer that may
be asbestos-related.
Stanford's Department of
Health and Safety has been eval
uating all University buildings as

part of a campuswide asbestos
abatement program. Tresidder
had been considered a low as
bestos hazard until the recent dis
covery of more asbestos in the
main kitchen, where the ter
minally ill employee, Frank
Kutch, worked.
Alain Decleve, the director of
Health and Safety, said the as
bestos hazard at Tresidder was
ranked at a level equal to many
other buildings on campus.
Currently, six buildings in the
Quad are being surveyed for as
bestos, bringing to one-third the
total number of campus buildings

that have been checked out.
All University buildings have
been ranked on the amount of
visible asbestos, the level of as
bestos in the air and other factors.
Tresidder had been ranked in the
high 50s on a scale ranging from
0 to 171, according to Jeffrey
Bramlett, the health and safety
specialist directing the asbestos
clean-up.
Decleve characterized this as a
relatively low hazard.
However, Bramlett admitted
the ranking will have to be re
evaluated this week in light of
the new discoveries.
Kutch, a baker who worked in
Tresidder for 11 years, was
diagnosed as having severe lung
cancer that he said may have been
exacerbated by his prolonged ex
posure to an asbestos-covered pipe
in the Tresidder bakery kitchen.
According to Kutch's doctor,
the cause of his cancer is unclear,
but both heavy smoking and as
bestos exposure are known causes
of lung cancer. Kutch has been a
heavy smoker for years. However,
according to Kutch, his doctor
said cigarettes alone were not
likely to cause the sudden appear
ance of his tumors.
Linda Crouse, chief steward of
the USW, said Friday the union
may involve itself in Kutch's case
even though he is not a union
member. Kutch, like many
workers at Tresidder, is an inde
pendent laborer contracted with
Marriott Corp., the company that
operates Tresidder food services.
Crouse said Kutch does not yet
have an attorney and has had no
legal advice. Kutch said he will
"look into" filing a claim, but was
hesitant because of the com
plexities, money and time in
volved.

Crouse said she will try to
engage an attorney this week who
will donate legal work on Kutch's
behalf perhaps from a non-profit
organization such as the Toxics
Coalition, a San Jose citizens' ad
vocacy group. This attorney,
Crouse hopes, would explore the
possibility of attaining "some
compensation for the time and
money" Kutch's asbestos expo
sure may have cost him.
If no such attorney volunteers
to represent Kutch, the USW will
ask its members to contribute
money in order to hire a lawyer,
Crouse said.
Crouse said that if a claim was
filed, another non-union Tresid
der employee, A.K. Lee, would
also join Kutch in his complaints
about Tresidder's asbestos.
Crouse said Lee, former head of
maintenance, used to work
around asbestos frequently, par
ticularly in the basement and me
chanics room. Although Lee had
a malignant tumor removed last
year, no direct link has been es
tablished between his cancer and
exposure to asbestos.
Crouse said the union would
also be looking into Marriott's
treatment of Kutch since he was
diagnosed. She said after speaking
with Kutch on Saturday that he
had not retired officially but that
Marriott had cut him off of the
payroll.
