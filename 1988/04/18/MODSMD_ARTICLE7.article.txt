The Stanford Bookstore is considering a $5 million
expansion, but the project is contingent on the
signing of a long-term lease with the University,
according to the president of the Bookstore's board
of directors.
The expansion plan calls for housing textbooks
in the basement, academic books on the first floor
and clothing and merchandise on the upper level.
The Bookstore, which currently carries 125,000
titles, would double its capacity to 250,000 titles.
This increased capacity would be accomplished
by moving the Bookstore's shipping and receiving
departments from its basement to an off-campus
location across the San Francisco Bay in Newark,
according to Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, president
of the Bookstore's board.
But Friedenthal said the time frame for the proj
ect's completion "depends on whether or not there
is cooperation with the University" regarding a
lease. He said it would be hard for the Bookstore
to justify such a large expenditure
without the guarantee of a long
term lease.
"We may have to put [the
project] on hold" if the Bookstore
can't sign such a lease, Frieden
thal said.
The Bookstore, an independent
corporation with a board com

posed of faculty and professionals,
is currently negotiating its lease
with a provost committee headed
by William Massy, who is vice
president of business and finance.
The University owns the land oc
cupied by the Bookstore, but not
the store itself.
According to Friedenthal, the
Bookstore is especially concerned
about getting a long-term lease
because of its past financial prob
lems. He explained that last year
the Bookstore was "in deep

trouble and losing money," but
that recently it has "turned
around" and has managed to
make a profit.
He noted, however, that the
cost of the expansion may force
the Bookstore to decrease its
textbook rebates to students.
The store's renewed financial
vigor has allowed Bookstore offi
cials to be optimistic about the
store's future here. Speaking of
the Bookstore's negotiations with
the University, Friedenthal said,

"I think we'll work something
out."
Friedenthal said the $5 million
estimate for the project does not
include "hidden costs" such as the
maintenance of a larger inventory
of books and the salaries for the
extra staff needed to run the ex
panded store.
Praising the plan, Friedenthal
said the expanded Bookstore will
be "a damned good one; I'll tell
you that. . . . It'll be really some
thing else."
