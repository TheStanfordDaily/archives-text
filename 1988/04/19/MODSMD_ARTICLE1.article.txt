# Election tallies final
## 
### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
The People's Platform, a polit
ical coalition of student ethnic and
progressive groups, scored consid
erable gains in last week's ASSU
election by placing nine of 10 Plat
form candidates in the ASSU Sen
ate and by filling the office of
Council of Presidents with its own
slate, A New Slate of Mind.
Although the opponent COP
slate, The Energizers, picked up
33 votes in the count of write-in
ballots, A New Slate of Mind
retained the lead with over 200
votes. All totaled, 5,017 students
voted in this year's election, 400
more than last spring.
Of the nine Platform candidates
elected, five will serve as voting
undergraduate senators while the
remaining four will fill slots as
alternate senators.
The senate is comprised of 10
voting undergraduate senators,
10 voting graduates, 10 under
graduate alternates and 10 grad
uate alternates.
Junior Miguel Marquez, mem
ber of A New Slate of Mind, said
he was satisfied with the success
of the Platform. Marquez said the
existence of an organized party
made the campaign and elections
more "issue-oriented" than in
past years when he said "name
recognition" played the major fac
tor.
Marquez said the party "puts
out a real platform" that improves
the election so "people know what
they're voting for."
Although Marquez acknowl
edged that the Platform has
received criticism because of its
progressive agenda, he said he
hopes such "petty politics" do not
interfere with ASSU projects in
the future. "If you have that
polarization, the ASSU gets noth
ing done," he said.
For the second year in a row,
the top vote-getter for undergrad
uate senator was a Platform can
didate. Junior Julie Martinez gar
nered 799 votes, 30 more than
her closest competitor, Amol
Doshi.
Because the COP race was so
close, the ASSU Elections Com
mission yesterday ordered a
recount of votes because of re
quests from the Energizers. The
BSU, which unexpectedly lost its
fee request by a mere 10-vote
margin, also asked for a recount
of its votes.
Energizers slate member
Leonard Adler, a junior, said
results would "probably not
change," but added that his slate
asked for the recount "just to
make sure, especially since this is
a new voting process."
The Santa Clara County
Registrar of Voters will recount
the ballots tomorrow before cer
tifying the election results, ac
cording to ASSU elections com
missioner Steve Baer. He
predicted that the elections
results are unlikely to change
after the recount because ballots
have been "shot through the ma
chine twice already."
COP member-elect Marquez
said the recount was only signif
icant because it would force his
slate to "wait to celebrate."
Marquez said the explanation
for his slate's victory was simple.
"People are looking for a change,"
he explained. "Both slates were
capable of running the COP â€”
we just offered a different ap
proach," he said.
The new COP members are
sophomore David Brown, sopho
more Canetta Ivy, senior Stacey
Leyton and Marquez.
Although voters approved most
of the student group fee requests

on the ballot, five groups were
denied funding this year. In an
unprecedented fee request vote,
the BSU lost its request for
$24,419. The Chaparral, Release
Magazine, X-TV and Public
Access Television also lost their
fee requests.
A second referendum asked
voters to participate in a mock
presidential election. On a ballot
of both Democrats and Republi
cans, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis won with 31 percent,
compared to the Rev. Jesse Jack
son's 25 percent and Vice Presi
dent George Bush at 19 percent.
Five percent selected the "none"
choice, more than voted for Jack
Kemp and Pat Robertson com
bined.
Mac Slate won the senior class
presidents race with 57 percent
of the vote, beating out write-ins
The Pleasure Principle and Elvis
Costello & The Attractions. The
Choi, Hauck, McMahon and Pack
ard slate withdrew before the elec
tion. The members of Mac Slate
are juniors Preston Hammer,
Catherine Jovicich, Julie Lythcott
and Dinesh Vazirani.
Four parts of last week's ballot
dealt with possible increases or

decreases in ASSU general fees.
Students voted down a 20 percent
increase in the base funds of the
Program Board. Although stu
dents supported a 10 percent in
crease in the community service

general fee, they voted for a main
tenance of the current Publica
tions Board and Program Board
allotments. The community serv
ice general fee will increase from
$80,000 to $88,000.
