### Tim Marklein Staff writer 
The People's Platform, a polit
ical coalition of student ethnic and
progressive groups, scored consid
erable gains in last week's ASSU
election by placing nine of 10 Plat
form candidates in the ASSU Sen
ate and by filling the office of
Council of Presidents with its own
slate, A New Slate of Mind.
Although the opponent COP
slate, The Energizers, picked up
33 votes in the count of write-in
ballots, A New Slate of Mind
retained the lead with over 200
votes. All totaled, 5,017 students
voted in this year's election, 400
more than last spring.
Of the nine Platform candidates

remaining four will fill slots as
alternate senators.
The senate is comprised of 10
voting undergraduate senators,
10 voting graduates, 10 under

existence of an organized party
made the campaign and elections
more "issue-oriented" than in
past years when he said "name

Marquez said the party "puts
out a real platform" that improves
the election so "people know what
they're voting for."
Although Marquez acknowl
edged that the Platform has
received criticism because of its
progressive agenda, he said he
hopes such "petty politics" do not
interfere with ASSU projects in
the future. "If you have that
polarization, the ASSU gets noth
ing done," he said.
For the second year in a row,
the top vote-getter for undergrad
uate senator was a Platform can
didate. Junior Julie Martinez gar
nered 799 votes, 30 more than
her closest competitor, Amol
Doshi.
Because the COP race was so
close, the ASSU Elections Com
mission yesterday ordered a
recount of votes because of re
quests from the Energizers. The
BSU, which unexpectedly lost its
fee request by a mere 10-vote
margin, also asked for a recount
of its votes.
Energizers slate member
Leonard Adler, a junior, said
results would "probably not
change," but added that his slate
asked for the recount "just to
