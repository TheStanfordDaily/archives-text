# Branner leftovers to feed the needy
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
University Food Service is fi
nally forking up.
After two months of discussion,
Food Service has agreed to donate
all unused leftovers from Branner
Hall Food Service to the Stanford
Project on Nutrition. Members of
SPOON will deliver these lef
tovers, which otherwise would
have gone to the garbage, to
various Palo Alto hunger relief
programs.
SPOON got off the ground last
fall by recruiting student volun
teers from 20 different self-ops,
fraternities and eating clubs. The
volunteers save all unused food
for SPOON deliveries that feed
an estimated 60 people a week.
For the last two quarters Food
Service had refused to participate
in the project, fearing that it could
be held liable if the donations
caused food poisoning or other

related problems.
But last week the University
Legal Office determined that Food
Service is released from any
liability under the "Good
Samaritan Act," a current state
law that protects organizations
making charitable donations.
Starting yesterday, Food Service
took up SPOON's cause, and
Branner became the first dorm
on campus to participate in the
project.
"There is not a single university
that has implemented a program
like this," said junior Amira
Leifer, founder of SPOON. "Stan
ford could act as a model for
others."
Food Service has implemented
the program in Branner on a one
quarter trial basis. However,
SPOON "could surely" spread to
all University dorms within the
next few years, according to Lois
