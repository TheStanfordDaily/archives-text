Iraq may have taken peninsula
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An Iraqi
assault force yesterday claimed victory in
retaking its strategic southern peninsula at
Faw, overrunning Iranian positions in what
appeared to be a significant military develop
ment in the seven-year-old Gulf war.
In a communique read on Iraqi television
over film clips allegedly showing Iraqi troops
occupying the once bustling oil port, the mil
itary command said, "Your sons have entered
the dear town of Faw, liberating its soil from
the filth of the invaders."
The apparent dramatic reversal for Iran
came as Iran also suffered a naval artillery
assault on two of its key offshore oil fields by
American warships retaliating for a mine at
tack last week on the frigate USS Samuel
Roberts.
Iran indirectly acknowledged a setback at
Faw. Tehran Radio reported late in the day
that "combatants of Islam, faced with simul
taneous attacks by American and Iraqi forces
from the land, sea and air, redeployed to new
defensive positions."
In Washington, government sources said
they were unable to confirm Iraqi claims of
a "victory" but that it was clear Iraqi forces
have made important gains in pushing Iranian
troops out of positions on Faw.
Iran accused the United States and Kuwait
of aiding the surprise offensive on the marshy
territory occupied by Iran two years ago.
Peace talks make no progress
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Contra leaders
ended their first visit to Managua yesterday
without progress toward a settlement of the
Nicaraguan conflict. But they agreed to free
all Sandinista war prisoners and return next
week for further peace talks.
A joint communique issued after the three
day session said only that government and
rebel leaders held "frank and direct conversa
tions" about differing interpretations of the
preliminary peace accord that they signed a
month ago.
It said that they agreed to keep their sep
arate negotiating teams in "permanent ses
sion" and to meet again here April 28-30.
Meanwhile, rebel leaders said that they will
rq,lease their last 45 to 50 Sandinista war
prisoners, in response to an appeal by Nica
ragua's Roman Catholic bishops.
The return of the exiled Contra leaders to
negotiate in Managua was a mqjor concession
by the Sandinista government.
The talks here reached an impasse Sunday
after the government proposed to disarm the
U.S.-backed rebels by July 1. The proposal
said that until they committed themselves to
a disarmament deadline, the rebels could not
take part in talks on political changes in Nic
aragua, receive non-lethal U.S. aid for their
troops or gain freedom for their prisoners.
Rebel leaders rejected the proposal and in
sisted on a two-step negotiating process: First,
to separate the two armies for a temporary
cease-fire that would include prisoner ex
changes and delivery of U.S. aid, then to seek
political changes in return for disarming their
troops.
