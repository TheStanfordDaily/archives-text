# U.S.-Iran conflict in Gulf escalates
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - U.S. warships
and aircraft sank or heavily damaged
six Iranian Navy vessels yesterday as
a major confrontation erupted in the
Persian Gulf in the wake of the United
States' early-morning strike against
two Iranian oil platforms, the Reagan
administration said.
U.S. and Iranian forces fired on each
other in the broadest and most direct
conflict yet, suddenly escalating what
for months had been a war of nerves
in the volatile waterway.
After ordering the U.S. naval units
to destroy the oil platforms in the
southern gulf, in what he described
as a "measured response" to the
renewed Iranian mining of the gulf
that crippled a U.S. frigate last week,
President Reagan declared:
"We've taken this action to make
certain the Iranians have no illusions
about the cost of irresponsible behav
ior. We aim to deter further Iranian
aggression, not provoke it.
"They must know that we will
protect our ships; and if they threaten
us, they'll pay a price," he said.
No American fatalities or injuries
were reported, but Secretary of
Defense Frank Carlucci said yesterday

afternoon that a Cobra attack helicop
ter, carrying two crewmen, was late
returning to a Navy cruiser and that
a search was under way. Iran claimed
that one of its warships had shot down
an American helicopter.
There was no U.S. report of Iranian
casualties, but crewmen were seen
abandoning the oil platforms just
before the facilities were destroyed.
The gulf clashes represented the
most serious fighting between the
United States and Iran since the
stepped-up deployment of U.S. units
began nine months ago to protect
Kuwaiti oil tankers threatened in the
Iran-Iraq war.
The fighting left an Iranian frigate
crippled and ablaze, another frigate
heavily damaged and under tow and
a patrol boat sunk. In addition, three
small speedboats, typically used by the
Iranian Revolutionary Guard to
launch rocket attacks on gulf shipping
and known as "Boghammars,"were at
tacked by the U.S. forces, with one
sunk and two others heavily damaged.
The overall Iranian force is badly
outgunned by the 25 to 30 warships
that the U.S. Navy has been deploying
in and around the gulf, Pentagon of

ficials said.
But the fighting intensified after
Iranian gunboats attacked the Willi
Tide, a U.S.-owned commercial oil
field supply ship, which returned,
damaged, to port in Dubai; two Iranian
speedboats fired rockets and machine
guns at a Panamanian-flagged vessel,
the Scan Bay, in the Mubarak oil field
off the emirate of Sharjah, and a
British oil tanker was attacked and
set ablaze.
Small craft near the Mubarak oil
field also were fired on by three
Iranian speedboats.
Congressional leaders, some of
whom were summoned to the White
House Sunday evening for a secret
briefing on the planned mission, ex
pressed fears yesterday that the con
flict could escalate. Although they
raised some concerns during the White
House meeting, according to White
House press representative Marlin
Fitzwater, they closed ranks yesterday
to support Reagan's decision to strike
the oil platforms.
At the same time, Democratic and
Republican presidential candidates
generally supported the U.S. attack,
although the Rev. Jesse Jackson said

that the growing crisis raised new
questions about U.S. policy in the
region.
Although the administration was
prepared for an Iranian military reply
to the strike on the oil platforms, the
magnitude caught U.S. officials by
surprise, and one remarked that "they
were a bit more brazen and foolish in
their response this time," compared
with previous incidents in which U.S.
retaliatory strikes brought no direct
Iranian responses.
"We were prepared to do more, and
when they obliged us, we did more.
The Iranians obliged by doing some
pretty foolish things today, which we
were aching for them to do," said an
other aide, a senior official at the Pen
tagon.
Carlucci, asked to explain why Iran
ignored U.S. warnings not to respond
to the initial retaliatory attacks on the
oil platforms, said at a news confer
ence:
"I'm not sure that it's explainable
in terms of Western logic at this point.
I have only to assume that it's some
kind of a fanatical reaction or slavish
obedience to a contingency plan."
