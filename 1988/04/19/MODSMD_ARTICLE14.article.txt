# Commission calls for new air safety agency
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A presidential com
mission, pushing for a "major overhaul"
in the way the federal government oversees
air safety, urged yesterday that the Federal
Aviation Administration be replaced by an
independent agency, outside the Depart
ment of Transportation.
"The present safety regulatory structure
is simply inadequate to deal with future
growth and technological change (in the
air transport system) . . . (and) is not
working effectively enough to ensure
safety," said Aviation Safety Commission
Chairman John Alhertine, vice chairman
of Farley Industries in Chicago.
The panel's proposed new "Federal Avi
ation Authority" would be headed by an
administrator, who would oversee the op
eration of the air traffic control system
and regulate the airline industry, as well
as by a director of aviation safety. The
latter would function as a so-called "safety
czar," who cotfld veto any safety-related
action by the administrator. Roth positions
would be filled by the president for terms
of seven years. A nine-member Board of
Governors also would be appointed. The
entire operation would be financed by user
fees rather than through federal budget
appropriations.
Elsewhere in its report, which was
adopted unanimously after 10 months of
research, the commission:
• Called for a beefed-up staff of inspec
tors to undertake expanded, surprise plane
inspections to uncover problems commonly
missed in scheduled, routine airline inspec
tions and to combat what Albertine called
"the potential complacency of the inspector
workforce";
• Opposed tighter regulatory controls on
the airline industry, asserting that "the

safety record has continued to be excellent
following deregulation" a decade ago;
• And urged that all planes — not just
those operated by the airlines — be re
quired to use "Mode C Transponders,"
which allow air traffic controllers to track
altitudes. Many general aviation aircraft
do not have the transponders, raising the
risk of mid-air collisions, such as the one
over Cerritos, Calif., in 1986 involving an
airliner and a private plane.
The commission's endorsement of a
single, autonomous agency to oversee tl\p
aviation industry — on the heels of similar
proposals from congressional leaders —
marks a setback for the Reagan adminis
tration's secretary of transportation, James
Burnley IV.
In a tempered statement, Burnley hinted
at his disapproval of the commission's
major conclusion: "Safety regulation and
enforcement must remain subject to strict
control and oversight by the federal gov
ernment. We cannot 'privatize' or give 'in
dependence' to these critical responsibili
ties."
A House aide said Monday that Congress
would look closely at the accountability
issue and the potential problems raised by
the proposed independent agency, when it
opens hearings on the proposed restruc
turing, probably in May.
