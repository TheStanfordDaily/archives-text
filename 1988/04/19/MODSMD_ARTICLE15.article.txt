# Demjanjuk guilty
## 'Ivan the Terrible' committed atrocities 
### 
JERUSALEM - An Israeli
court last night pronounced
retired Cleveland autoworker
John Demjanjuk guilty of
World War II crimes that gov
ernment prosecutors described
as "amongst the most serious
and awful in human history."
In only the second war
crimes trial ever conducted
here, a three-judge panel ruled
that the 68-year-old defendant
was the same man whose
cruelty as a guard in the
Treblinka death camp in
Poland during World War II
earned him the nickname
"Ivan the Terrible."
"We have concluded un
equivocally, without the
slightest doubt, that Ivan John
Demjanjuk is the Ivan who
operated the gas chambers at
Treblinka and who perpetrated
the gruesome deeds described
above," presiding Judge Dov
Levine said.
The crimes for which Dem
janjuk was found guilty are
among the handful that carry
a possible death penalty under
Israeli law, but his sentence
will be pronounced only after
a separate hearing Monday.
The defense will have 45 days
from the date of sentencing to
launch its expected appeal.
Yesterday's verdict, greeted
by applause from the standing
room-only crowd in a converted
theater here, came near the
end of a marathon, 12-hour

session in which the three
judges took turns reading ex
cerpts from their 444-page op
inion. It was the 107 th session
of a trial that stretched out,
with frequent delays, more
than 14 months.
"I am very good — don't wor
ry," the handcuffed defendant
told reporters as he was led
away from the court Monday
night, surrounded by guards.
"I am an innocent man. I'll
appeal, and I'm sure that I will
win."
Demjanjuk's attorneys
argued that he was the victim
of mistaken identity and their
defense concentrated largely on
challenging the memory of five
Treblinka survivors who iden
tified their client as Ivan dur
ing the trial.
But the court's opinio a made
it clear that the judges consid
ered the survivor testimony to
be persuasive. "Anyone who ex
perienced these shocks, these
terrible experiences at the
death camp Treblinka, can
never forget what they've
seen," the judges stated. "We
accept fully that which they
told us."
The jurists also accepted as
genuine the other key element
of the prosecution's case — an
identification card issued in
Demjanjuk's name at a Nazi
training facility for death camp
guards in wartime Poland.
