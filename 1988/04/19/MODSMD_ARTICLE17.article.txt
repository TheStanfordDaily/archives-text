## Bennett is off base 
### 
AT LONG LAST U.S. Secre
tary of Education William
Bennett has come to address
the Cultures, Ideas and Values pro
gram at Stanford, with Stanford,
face-to-face.
Bennett has shown the good
judgment and responsibility re
quired by his position. He should
be thanked for waiting until after
the Faculty Senate vote to speak.
He should be thanked again for
coming here to comment on an
important educational issue he has
been addressing from afar.
However, Bennett is still far
from understanding the complex
ity of the last two-year stage of
the eight-year Western Culture
debate.
In his speech last night, Bennett
assailed the Western Culture
debate here as entirely political in
nature, with the supporters win
ning "not through force of argu
ment, but through bullying,
threatening and name-calling."
Then he proceeded to support the
West as the basis for all that is
good and valuable in the world.
Bennett still questions whether
there was an enlightened debate
over the entire issue, ignoring the
intense intellectual debate that
raged from the various faculty de
partments to student forums to
the pages of student publications.
Yes, politics were involved in the
CIV debate. One of the traditional
cornerstones of "Western" thought
is the dialectic relationship be
tween politics and academics. In
this relationship political action in
itiates intellectual debate. The
fruits of this intellectual debate
must be made real and then
guaranteed by political measures.
To say that the CIV decision was
politically rushed and intellectually
shallow is a very serious charge.
Bennett will not be able to defend
his characterization of the Stan

ford faculty as cowards who bowed
to "the politics of intimidation."
One must ask how someone can
be so simple as to believe the CIV
decision was made by a group of
old men and arm-twisting student
radicals? Please give the Stanford
faculty some credit for integrity.
Bennett and many other "intel
lectuals" across the country see the
CIV decision as a low moment in
American academia. Stanford is
seen as having killed Western Cul
ture and slashed its own intellec
tual wrists.
Neither Bennett nor anyone else
watching the CIV issue is posessed
with oracular vision. It is simply
rhetoric to say Stanford will be
harmed. The spirit of the CIV pro
posal affirms that how material is
taught and not what material is
taught is most important. The CIV
proposal is dynamic and alive â€”
not static and monolithic.
What we teach and how we teach
it is undeniably a strong statement
of what we value.
As for being the assassin of
Western Culture, Stanford pleads
accidental homicide. No one ever
denied that we are in the "West
ern" sphere of thought. But, if in
acknowledging the contributions of
other cultures one removes the
West and Western Culture from
its venerated pedestal, so be it. It
is very much in the "Western" tra
dition to discuss, challenge and
change.
Mr. Secretary: Please remember
that all educational changes have
political motivations. The founda
tion of CIV lies in acknowleging
the contributions of those tradi
tionally ignored in America's po
litical system. In changing the
focus of education, the poor, mi
norities and women will be able to
empower themselves and rightfully
claim their place in American so
ciety as true equals.
