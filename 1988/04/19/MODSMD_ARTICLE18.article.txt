## Flaws in medical industry cause animal suffering 
### 
LAST AUGUST at a hearing
before the Santa Clara Board of
Supervisors, a speaker testified:
"Our animals are precious to us." No,
he was not a representative of the
animal protection community, but an
eminent biomedical researcher.
We use the same words, but the
meanings are different. For research
ers, animals are precious not because
they are joyful, thinking, feeling
beings, but because they are the tech
nological "wetware," as the protocols
say, on which to take measurements
and compile test results. Without
measurements there are no findings;
without findings no papers; without
papers no grants.
The well-being of the animals is not
an issue for researchers — not cage
size, sunshine, exercise or more

humane euthanasia. The animals must
simply be kept healthy enough long
enough to serve the purposes chosen
for them, and then they are destroyed.
Animals are the expendables in the
gigantic game of Trivial Pursuit that
the biomedical system plays.
Stanford holds about 90,000 animals
for research — dogs from the Hollister
pound, cats, mice, barn owls, turtles,
squirrel monkeys, Olive Baboons and
others. Much of the research done on
these animals is repetitive and brutal.
Consider experiments where tubes
are forced down the throats of mice to
addict them to Valium. When they are
addicted the drug is withdrawn so that
researchers can observe the symptoms
that result, including self-mutilation
and cannibalism. Surely there are
enough human addicts serious re-

searchers could study, and yet from
1980 to 1987 there were at least 3,216
animal studies in the United States on
valium and other anti-anxiety drugs.
And why prescribe drugs for anxiety
and not mediation, bio-feedback and
social support? It seems that what is
not invasive is not medicine. Who is
really served by many such drugs with
their all too frequent side-effects but
the researchers, the grant administra
tors and the pharmaceutical compan
ies?
Biomedical researchers have perhaps
become grant junkies. They have been
conditioned to keep pushing that lever
as fast as they can to get their
rewards — more money and more
prestige. They are so caught in the
measurement mind-set, they cannnot
discriminate trivial studies from impor
tant work. Millions of animals suffer

so they can amass mountains of infor
mation. Journals proliferate beyond
readability at the same time the es
tablishment refuses to set up a data
bank where previous research can be
checked before yet another protocol is
funded.
We taxpayers, too awed to ask ques
tions, are enablers who likewise perpet
uate the system. Suffering is not cured
by causing more suffering. Such ex
periments demean the researchers who
perform them, the institutions that
sponsor them and all humankind. They
poison our spirit.
To quote T.S. Eliot: "Where is the
wisdom we have lost in knowledge?
Where is the knowledge we have lost
in information?"
