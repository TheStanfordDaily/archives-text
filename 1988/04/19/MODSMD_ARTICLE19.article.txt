# Demographics affect Israel's existence
## 
### 
In his April 5 Viewpoint, Rabbi Ari
Cartun does an excellent job of dispell
ing many rumours about Israel. How
ever, when he mentions the idea
equating the Israeli and South African
governments, he considers the compari
son involves Israel as it presently
exists.
Rather, a more interesting compari
son is the Israeli government in 10 to
20 years to the South African govern
ment now. At the present population
growth rates of Israeli Arabs and Is
raeli Jews, the Arabs will form a
mfyority of Israel's population by the
year 2010.
For the present, these Arabs can
vote, do have members in the Knesset
and even fight in the army. But, Is
raeli Arabs live in the dirtiest parts of
the cities, have the lowest paying jobs

and are discriminated against.
When I studied in Israel one-and-a
half years ago, my Druze roommate
stormed into our room one day with
out his usual smile. He threw his
books down and said, "I'm sick of
having to fight for everything I want
because I'm not a Jew." He had
wanted to transfer from the University
of Haifa to Hebrew University to com
plete his degree, only he couldn't get
housing there.
When the Arab population becomes a
mcyority, this kind of hidden suppres
sion will be extremely difficult. Because
it is fundamentally a Jewish state,
Israel must keep power out of Arab
hands. This means no economic power
that the Jews cannot effectively control
and no political power that can hinder
the Jews' control. It is absurd to ex
pect an Arab-controlled Knesset or an
Arab-controlled economy to run Israel
as a Jewish state. It is a problem that
only mutual trust can solve.
I only hope that both Israeli Arabs

and Israeli Jews solve this, but they
are far from it. A few Israeli students
warned me when I was in Israel to
never turn my back on an Arab be
cause I wouldn't know when he'd stab
me in the back.
