# BSU deprived of fee
## 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
In a dramatic cliffhanger after
preliminary results were counted,
the Black Student Union failed to
get its ASSU fee assessment by
a mere 10 votes in the Spring
Election as the final results were
tallied yesterday.
According to the preliminary
vote count taken on Friday, the
BSU had maintained a tenuous
1 percent lead in the balloting
with 500 write-in ballots remain

ing to be counted by hand.
The results marked the first
time that the BSU was denied its
fee assessment in the six years it
has requested one. Exact records
of the BSU's winning margin in
past elections are not available,
but most estimates place the ap
proval rate at 60 to 70 percent.
Many students avoided voting
on the BSU, as 888 voters
abstained from voting on the fee
request.

The BSU submitted a formal
request yesterday for a recount
of the vote. Elections Commis
sioner Steve Baer, a senior,
granted the request and said new
totals would be posted this after
noon at the ASSU office.
The BSU had asked for $24,419
for operational and program ex
penses in its request, up $1,700
from last year.
BSU Chair Bill King was
subdued and upset by the loss,
but remained confident yesterday
that the black community's main
advocacy group would continue to
operate on sound financial
grounds.
"One minor setback is not going
to stop the mission of the BSU,"
King said.
King said voters had probably
lost sight of the positive ac
complishments of the BSU this
year — including the Area One
reform and sponsorship of a Mar
tin Luther King Jr. commemora
tive rally — and focused instead
on recent negative publicity the
group had received.

as wrong with the BSU."
Funding options available to
the BSU include:
• Obtaining discretionary funding
six times per school year from the
ASSU Program Board;
• Petitioning University depart
ments for aid; and
• Locating contingency funding
from the Program Board of up to
$6,000.
The voters' rejection of the BSU
fee request reflected a trend away
from rubber-stamp endorsement
of progressive and ethnic minority
student groups.
The Stanford Latino Student
Alliance, which serves as the
umbrella organization and chief
financial support for all Latino
groups on campus, passed by only
5.6 percent.
In addition, Chicanos in Public
Service, which organizes tutoring
for East Palo Alto students,
passed by 9.4 percent.
The BSU has a leadership role
among the minority groups on
campus, King said, making it the
"lightening rod" of negative reac
tions to minority advocacy. King
said The Daily, in particular, "has
served as a negative forum for
the BSU; it hasn't tried to present
our views with half the amount
of energy as the things it has seen
