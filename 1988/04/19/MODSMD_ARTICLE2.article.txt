# BSU deprived of fee
## 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
In a dramatic cliffhanger after
preliminary results were counted,
the Black Student Union failed to
get its ASSU fee assessment by
a mere 10 votes in the Spring
Election as the final results were
tallied yesterday.
According to the preliminary
vote count taken on Friday, the
BSU had maintained a tenuous
1 percent lead in the balloting
with 500 write-in ballots remain

ing to be counted by hand.
The results marked the first
time that the BSU was denied its
fee assessment in the six years it
has requested one. Exact records
of the BSU's winning margin in
past elections are not available,
but most estimates place the ap
proval rate at 60 to 70 percent.
Many students avoided voting
on the BSU, as 888 voters
abstained from voting on the fee
request.
