# Election procedures unfair to candidate
## 
### 
Despite new voting equipment, this
year's ASSU elections were more inef
ficient and unfair than last year's.
Some students had to wait over half
an hour just to vote. In addition, stu
dents running for undergraduate sen
ate on the first page of the ballot got
more votes than those listed on the
second page â€” perhaps because voters
thought there was only one page of
candidates, and when they realized
there were two pages, they had already
punched in 10 candidates.

These are problems which many
candidates faced and could perhaps be
explained by the new election equip
ment and procedures. An issue not due
to the new equipment is that my odds
of being elected senator were signifi
cantly reduced when my name was
misspelled on the ballot. Granted
"Kevin Wong" is very similar to "Kel
vin Wong," but I campaigned heavily
using my first name and in a field of
almost 50 candidates, name recognition
is crucial to being elected.
The mistake is unexcusable because
my name was spelled correctly in both
the election handbook and preliminary
candidate list.
When I brought the issue up to the
Election Commissioner, Steve Baer,
last Wednesday afternoon, he
apologized for the mistake but said
nothing could be done. Unfortunately,
his apologies won't replace the number
of votes I lost due to this mistake.
