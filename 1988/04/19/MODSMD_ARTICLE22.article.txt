## An apolitical ASSU 
### 
IN A MOMENT amid last week's
ASSU election fervor, a senior friend
made an astute observation about the
goings on. "Each year," he said to me,
"we go through the spring ritual of ASSU
elections, but with four years experience
here, I can say with confidence that the
ASSU is a bunch of self-serious petty
bureaucrats whose measure of them
selves is in inverse proportion to the stu
dents' esteem for them."
That sentiment, shared by many a
Stanford student, isn't far from the mark.
Despite the myriad and repetitive cam
paign promises promulgated by candi
dates in the elections each year, it is
hard to point to where the progress has
been made. There still aren't lights on
the tennis courts; our I.D. cards aren't
laminated and don't work at the Book
store, library, and food service and we
still have no real student pub.
But don't misunderstand me, I don't
disdain our past senators and the Council
of Presidents for failing to accomplish
these tasks — or the current and future
candidates for making attempts where
their predecessors failed. In fact, quite
the opposite, those candidates who run
on platforms clearly related to student
needs, no matter how mundane, are the
most respectable members of the ASSU.
Moreover, I don't even mind voting for
students who run with only their name
and a hackneyed slogan on their fliers.
At least these students demonstrate that
they have a sense of perspective on the
minor role of the ASSU and student gov
ernment at Stanford. They aren't run
ning to realize some grandiose (and

certainly inappropriate) political agenda.
The ASSU is is a necessary body in
that it fulfills many of the bureaucratic
needs of the student body. Our elected
officers have the responsibility of doling
out money received through student fees,
of choosing other officers to run various
student services — Speakers Bureau,
Flicks, etc. — and of course, of perpetuat
ing the ASSU institution itself by run
ning yearly elections. And, with
occasional mishaps excepted, the ASSU
gets their job done.
Where the ASSU goes wrong is when
it streches beyond these basic functions,
and self-importantly expands its role to
include political functionary for the
campus. This aggrandized view of itself
has led the ASSU to commit two Cardinal
sins.
The first sin is that of pork-barrel al
locations. The ASSU spends more on it
self then it is worth: Witness the huge
expense to renovate their own office space
and more unbelievably the $8,000 the
senate spent on equipment so that they
could televise themselves on SuNet. (The
latter is a particulary preposterous ex
pense because senate meetings are so
boring that most senators don't bother
to attend them reglarly. Whom do they
expect will watch them on T.V.?)
More worrisome than piggy use of
money is that our elected officers use
the senate to further political goals not
shared by the student body at large. Take
for example the issue of whether Stanford
should support a grape boycott. Last
spring the senate passed a resolution sup
porting the boycott. Claiming this deci
sion represented the views of the student

body, senators joined MEChA, a Chicano
student organization, in lobbying Univer
sity Food Service to stop buying grapes
for the rest of the year.
This year, in contrast, when the deci
sion was given to students to make on
a dorm by dorm basis, resistance to the
institution of the boycott suggests that
the ASSU hadn't accurately represented
student views.
Moreover, this story illustrates the pos
sible liabilities of having the ASSU act
as a political organization. What is to
stop the ASSU from giving student
money to causes it supports in the name*
of the student body. If the ASSU lets its*
political wishes bias its allocation of *
funds, Stanford undergraduates could
end up funding the pet causes of senators
from their own pockets.
So a cynical word to the wise for our
incoming officers: The next time you
want to insist that your body legitimately
represents the political views of Stanford
students, remember that you were elected
by no more than a third of our population
— and most of those lured to the polls
only by the prospect of a $60 fee refund
— so give it up, and go back to the
paperwork.
