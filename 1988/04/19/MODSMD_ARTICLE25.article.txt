## The 						Bug sorts out international mail inquiry 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
On Tuesday, November 10,
1987, I wrote in Bug Me: "My
biggest concern is that Counter
point has yet to come sing 'Be
My Baby' while giving me a
private Swedish massage." Last
Wednesday, in the privacy of a
house meeting attended by 30 of
my closest (most physically prox
imate) friends, Counterpoint, led
by the sexy Pam Simpson, came
through harmoniously. Words
alone cannot adequately describe
the experience — at least, not
words that my editors will let me
use. Thanks, ladies!

Okay Bug, I got one for your
investigative skills to get some ex
cercise with. I was affixing one of
those new 45-cent overseas
postage stamps to a letter, and I
started wonderin' about overseas
mail. Are U.S. stamps valid in
France, Italy and Somalia? Is
there some sort of exchange pro
gram between countries like, "You
ship our mail, we'll ship yours,"
or does the U.S. Postal Service
pay foreign countries to send our
letters around? Is there some sort
of crisis when we send a lot more
letters to Ethiopia than they send
us? Who's in control here?
— Mortal Coil
Maybe a tough one for someone
else's investigative skills, pal, but
you aren't dealing with any old
idiot here, you're dealing with this
idiot. And, as a matter of fact, in

your wild spasms of random
guessing you happen to have hit
the nail more or less on the head.
But first a little history lesson.
Prior to 1875, mail delivery be
tween nations was handled by a
plethora of bilateral treaties.
Various countries had different
agreements with one another,
which resulted in a sort of postal
anarchy. If your country didn't
have a postal agreement with a
country to which you wished to
send mail then you were fiat out
of luck.
So in 1875 a bunch of nations
got together (one wonders
whether invitations were issued
by mail) and established the Gen
eral Postal Union in order to stan
dardize procedures for sending
mail between countries. Weight,
size limits and other general
provisions were made by the
GPU.
These rules established by the
GPU were extremely helpful in
regulating international mail
service, and by 1948 had allowed
the countries of the world to suc
cesfully declare war on each other
twice.
In 1948 the GPU became a spe
cialized agency of the United Na
tions and changed its name to the
Universal Postal Union. Besides
deciding on the international pos
tal rules, usually done every five
years at the Universal Postal
Congress, the UPU is also man
dated to increase the efficiency of
postal systems in developing na
tions.
Among the rules made by the
UPU was that all member
countries formed a single postal
territory. In other words, it cost
the same to send a letter to Nic
aragua, Nairobi or Nepal.
Also, it was decided that the
country a letter is mailed from
retains the postage collected on
that letter, meaning that when
you mail a letter in the United
States, the U.S. Postal Service
gets the whole 45 cents. This rule
was made so there would be no
need for complex international ac
counts, and on the theory that a
letter normally generates a reply.

In reality, however, this put some
developing nations at a big disad
vantage because they were receiv
ing — and thus having to dis
tribute without getting paid —
many more letters than they were
sending. So in 1969 the UPU
changed the rules to establish
redress payments between
countries with a mail imbalance.
As part of the UPU, members
agree to treat incoming foreign
mail the same way they treat their
own mail, or, as you so eloquently
put it, "You ship our mail, we'll
ship yours."
Obviously, then, U.S. stamps
aren't valid in foreign countries.
U.S. stamps are only needed to
get the mail out of the United
States. Once the postage is can
celed and the letter lands in the
foreign country it becomes the
property of that country. They
don't care about the postage be
cause it all goes to the United
States anyway.
In case you're wondering, all
the countries in the United Na
tions are part of the UPU, and
other countries outside the U.N.
apparently follow the conventions
of the UPU anyway. All this in
formation and much more can be
gleaned from the Postal Service
publication "International Mail,"

which should not be confused
with the catalog "International
Male." The former of those pub
lications bulges with information,
the latter just bulges.
Dear Bug,
Why don't we have any black
cadavers in our anatomy lab?
— Leonardo
Thanks for the question, Len
ny. You prove once again the old
adage that if you work hard
enough it isn't necessary to be
smart to get into medical school.
The Anatomy department of
the medical school really doesn't
care what race its cadavers hap
pen to be. As we are so often
reminded these days, we're all the
same — and in the case of my
ex-girlfriend, more attractive —
on the inside.
I don't know exactly where you
imagined the corpses come from,
but it isn't like your Anatomy
professor goes over to the Contra
Costa Cadaver Clearinghouse and
asks the clerk where the white
meat section is. In fact, all
cadavers used by the Stanford
Medical School are received
strictly on a donation basis.
Weirdos . . . uh, I mean . . .
citizens who contact the medical

Debbie Gibson is
pretty much a wimp,
while Tiffany is one
mean booger. Thus, I
predict that in a mud
wrestling match be
tween these two radio
queens...

school and say they wish to make
a (euphemism coming) corporeal
donation to the Centennial Fund
are furnished with the appropri
ate donor forms by the medical
school. These forms are similar
to your basic organ donor card,
in which you donate anything
from specific organs to, as my
father so delicately put it on his
card, "anything that's left."
The medical school does not so
licit people for their corpses, the
most likely reason being that it
would be difficult to find a large
enough return envelope.
You'll also be relieved to hear
that you are the only one who
can donate your corpse. There's
no way your twisted sister can
get revenge on you after your
departure by volunteering your
spleen for Gross Autopsy Pathol
ogy Laboratory (winter, Tues
days, 12:30-2:30, check it out!)
And they don't pay for your body
either, so forget trying to score
an advance on your major organs.
The medical school is donated
at least a hundred corpses a year,
and currently has four file
drawers full of the names of
Cadaver Wannabes. The woman
I spoke with didn't have any idea
how many of those Future Stan
ford Cadavers were black, Asian,
Eskimo, Aborigine, etc., nor did
she seem to care. They dissect
without regards to sex, race, color,
religion, sexual orientation, na
tional and ethnic origin, or polit
ical affiliation — except Republi
cans. In 1974 they began the prac

tice of not using the corpses of
lawyers. Lawyers, it seems, have
no guts.
Dear Bug Me,
Who do you think would win
in a mud-wrestling contest, Tif
fany or Debbie Gibson?
— Would Give Much To Know
First of all I would like to stip
ulate for the record that I abso
lutely did not make this question
up. It came, thanks to the
wonders of the international mail
system (see above), on a Madonna
postcard from West Berlin. I think
I have proven that I am above
cheap sensationalism, and
proudly mold my journalistic eth
ics after my hero, Geraldo Rivera.
Now for those of you who have
not been carefully following the
parallel careers of Tiff and Deb,
let's review what each of these
bubble-gum pop princesses have
been up to since we last made
mention of them on these pages.
Tiffany:
• Covered the Beatles' "I Saw
Her Standing There" and charted
higher than they did with the
song.
• Sued her own mother for
emancipation and the right to
keep her own earnings, and won.
• Opened a restaurant in New
York City which serves only
breakfast food. (Special joke hint
for the non-cultured: Guess the
name of this restaurant.)
Debbie Gibson:
• Diddly-squat.
So you can see from these data
that Debbie Gibson is pretty much
a wimp, while Tiffany is one mean
booger. (Actually, I was just
looking for an excuse to use the
word "booger.") Thus, I predict
that in a mud-wrestling match
between these two radio queens
— and this is not beyond the
realm of possibility considering
that MTV has brought us many
equally sleazy promotions — Tif
fany would win.

Bug Me appears every Tuesday,
barring interference from a Stan
ford singing group.
