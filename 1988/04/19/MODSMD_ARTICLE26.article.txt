## Stanford battery charges 10-inning win Plemel and Robbins are the heroes as the Cardinal moves to within a game of first 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - The
Stanford baseball team ran
on battery power yesterday.
Senior pitcher Lee Plemel
threw a splendid 10-inning
complete game and his bat
tery mate, senior catcher

Doug Robbins, knocked in two runs and
threw out two runners as the Cardinal
beat USC 5-3 in extra innings at Rod
Dedeaux Field.
The game was a makeup of a game that
was rained out earlier this season.
With the victory, Stanford's series with
Arizona State this weekend at Sunken Dia
mond becomes a showdown for first place
in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Di
vision. The Cardinal, now 29-14 overall
and 13-8 in the Six-Pac, is a game behind
the league-leading Sun Devils (14-7), who
have won 23 games in a row.
"This was a huge game," Robbins said.
"If we lose it, we're two games back and
our backs are to the wall. Now we're a
game back and if we take two out of three
next weekend we're tied for first."
Plemel's performance was the key to the
game for the Cardinal. The senior
righthander kept the Trojans off-balance
the entire game with his repertoire of nasty
off-speed pitches mixed in with some stra
tegic fastballs, and looked strong for all 10
innings.
He gave up eight hits and two earned
runs, walked none and struck out seven
en route to his sixth win of the season to
go with six losses.
"1 had all my good stuff today — I had
my two good breakers (curveball and
slider)," Plemel said. "I don't sneak up on
anybody — they know I'm going to come
with the curveball, so I have to be able to
put the fastball in there, too."
This was the Dr. Jekyll Plemel. His Mr.
Hyde incarnation had started last Friday's
game at UCLA and lasted only five batters,
giving up three singles, a walk and a grand
slam home run as the Bruins squashed
Stanford 9-5. The erratic Plemel had also
been bombed in his last start before that,
a gruesome 20-5 loss at Arizona two weeks

ago.
"I don't know what's happened the last
couple starts," Plemel said. "I don't know
and the coaches don't know."
Robbins doesn't know, either, but said
it's probably a mechanical problem. He
said that sometimes Plemel drops his elbow
down as he is delivering the ball.
When that happens, Plemel's breaking
balls flatten out, all his pitches move up
in the strike zone, and hungry hitters start
to lick their chops.
"The coach (Stanford Pitching Coach
Tom Dunton) and I were trying to remind
him of that today," Robbins said. "He
looked great. ... He probably threw 70 per
cent breaking balls."
The problem was Trojan starter Phil
Kendall was throwing every bit as well as
Plemel. Neither team scored an earned run
until the eighth.
But before that, both teams scored on
the other's errors.
USC took advantage of two Cardinal
fielding gaffes in the second inning to score
the game's first run.
With one out, Greg Hokuf s liner glanced
off Plemel's glove. Sophomore shortstop
Troy Paulsen gloved the ball but his throw
pulled junior Ron Witmeyer off the bag at
first. Hokuf stole second and went to third
on John Jackson's groundout to first.
Murph Proctor then hit a slicing fly to
left, where sophomore Tim Griffin tracked
the ball but dropped it, allowing Hokuf to
score and give USC a 1-0 lead.
In the fourth, it was the Trojans' turn
to exercise some generosity. Kendall walked
sophomore Paul Carey to start the inning,
and Carey moved around to third on groun
douts by Robbins and senior Jeff Saenger.
Carey then scored when USC shortstop
Bret Barberie booted Griffin's grounder.
In the fifth, John Jackson led off for the
Trojans with a single, but was immediately
cut down trying to steal by Robbins.
An inning later, Barberie led off with a
single, then with one out, broke for second.
When he got there, Stanford junior second
baseman Frank Carey greeted him with
the ball, and that was all for another Trojan
threat.

Junior third baseman Ed Sprague drove in the game-winning run with a single in Stanford's three-run 10th inning,
lifting Stanford to within a game of first-place Arizona State in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.

Robbins, who also threw out
two UCLA base runners last Fri
day and one on Sunday, credited
the pitchcrs for his success
against base stealers. "It makes
it easier when you have guys like
Lee and Mike (Mussina) — guys
who throw the ball to the plate
quickly," he said. "It's more them
than me."
So the score stayed at 1-1
through seven. In the eighth, Wit
meyer singled with one out to get
things started for Stanford.
Junior Ed Sprague doubled to the
wall in right to move Witmeyer
to third, then Paul Carey brought

him home with a line single to
right. Sprague came in on Rob
bins' single into left to put Stan
ford up 3-1.
Things stayed that way until
the bottom of the ninth, when
Plemel made his only serious mis
take of the day. With Trojan third
baseman Rodney Peete on first
and one out, Plemel put a slider
up in the strike zone to Bret
Boone.
Boone, the son of California An
gels catcher and former Stanford
player Bob Boone, made Plemel
pay, cranking a two-run home run
to left-center to send the game
into extra innings.
"That pitch was really up,"
Plemel said. "I didn't know where
I was throwing that — I just
threw the ball up there. ... It was

really disappointing that had to
happen in the ninth, but I still
felt strong."
It didn't take long for the Car
dinal to take the game in hand
in extra innings. Paulsen led off
the 10th with a triple off the
right-field wall (Paulsen also had
a single in the fifth to extend his
hitting streak to 22 games), and
Witmeyer drew his third walk of
the day to make it first and third
with no outs. Sprague singled up
the middle to bring in Paulsen
and move Witmeyer to third.
After an intentional walk to Paul
Carey, Robbins singled sharply to
right-center to make the score 5-3.
Plemel retired the Trojans in
order in the bottom of the 10th
to secure the win.
Card notes

Stanford plays St. Mary's today at
2:30 p.m. at Moraga, the last game
of an eight-game road trip.
The Pac-10 yesterday named Paul
Carey the Six-Pac Player of the Week
for his performance against UCLA.
In three games against the Bruins,
Carey was six-for-10 with seven RBI,
a double and two home runs, includ
ing a game-winning three-run shot in
the 12th inning on Sunday.
Witmeyer's three walks yesterday
give him 27 for the year — tops on
the team.
Yesterday's win raises the Cardi
nal's record in extra-inning games
this year to 2-3.
Plemel struck out Trojan cleanup
hitter Jim Campania three times in
four at-bats yesterday. Campanis is
the grandson of deposed Los Angeles
Dodgers vice president A 1 Campanis.

en route to his sixth win of the season to
go with six losses.
"1 had all my good stuff today — I had
my two good breakers (curveball and
slider)," Plemel said. "I don't sneak up on
anybody — they know I'm going to come
with the curveball, so I have to be able to
put the fastball in there, too."
This was the Dr. Jekyll Plemel. His Mr.
Hyde incarnation had started last Friday's
game at UCLA and lasted only five batters,
giving up three singles, a walk and a grand
slam home run as the Bruins squashed
Stanford 9-5. The erratic Plemel had also
been bombed in his last start before that,
a gruesome 20-5 loss at Arizona two weeks

ago.
"I don't know what's happened the last
couple starts," Plemel said. "I don't know
and the coaches don't know."
Robbins doesn't know, either, but said
it's probably a mechanical problem. He
said that sometimes Plemel drops his elbow
down as he is delivering the ball.
When that happens, Plemel's breaking
balls flatten out, all his pitches move up
in the strike zone, and hungry hitters start
to lick their chops.
"The coach (Stanford Pitching Coach
Tom Dunton) and I were trying to remind
him of that today," Robbins said. "He
looked great. ... He probably threw 70 per
cent breaking balls."
The problem was Trojan starter Phil
Kendall was throwing every bit as well as
Plemel. Neither team scored an earned run
until the eighth.
But before that, both teams scored on
the other's errors.
USC took advantage of two Cardinal
fielding gaffes in the second inning to score
the game's first run.
With one out, Greg Hokuf s liner glanced
off Plemel's glove. Sophomore shortstop
Troy Paulsen gloved the ball but his throw
pulled junior Ron Witmeyer off the bag at
first. Hokuf stole second and went to third
on John Jackson's groundout to first.
Murph Proctor then hit a slicing fly to
left, where sophomore Tim Griffin tracked
the ball but dropped it, allowing Hokuf to
score and give USC a 1-0 lead.
In the fourth, it was the Trojans' turn
to exercise some generosity. Kendall walked
sophomore Paul Carey to start the inning,
and Carey moved around to third on groun
douts by Robbins and senior Jeff Saenger.
Carey then scored when USC shortstop
Bret Barberie booted Griffin's grounder.
In the fifth, John Jackson led off for the
Trojans with a single, but was immediately
cut down trying to steal by Robbins.
An inning later, Barberie led off with a
single, then with one out, broke for second.
When he got there, Stanford junior second
baseman Frank Carey greeted him with
the ball, and that was all for another Trojan
threat.


James Rucker — Daily file
Junior third baseman Ed Sprague drove in the game-winning run with a single in Stanford's three-run 10th inning,
lifting Stanford to within a game of first-place Arizona State in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division.

Robbins, who also threw out
two UCLA base runners last Fri
day and one on Sunday, credited
the pitchcrs for his success
against base stealers. "It makes
it easier when you have guys like
Lee and Mike (Mussina) — guys
who throw the ball to the plate
quickly," he said. "It's more them
than me."
So the score stayed at 1-1
through seven. In the eighth, Wit
meyer singled with one out to get
things started for Stanford.
Junior Ed Sprague doubled to the
wall in right to move Witmeyer
to third, then Paul Carey brought

him home with a line single to
right. Sprague came in on Rob
bins' single into left to put Stan
ford up 3-1.
Things stayed that way until
the bottom of the ninth, when
Plemel made his only serious mis
take of the day. With Trojan third
baseman Rodney Peete on first
and one out, Plemel put a slider
up in the strike zone to Bret
Boone.
Boone, the son of California An
gels catcher and former Stanford
player Bob Boone, made Plemel
pay, cranking a two-run home run
to left-center to send the game
into extra innings.
"That pitch was really up,"
Plemel said. "I didn't know where
I was throwing that — I just
threw the ball up there. ... It was

really disappointing that had to
happen in the ninth, but I still
felt strong."
It didn't take long for the Car
dinal to take the game in hand
in extra innings. Paulsen led off
the 10th with a triple off the
right-field wall (Paulsen also had
a single in the fifth to extend his
hitting streak to 22 games), and
Witmeyer drew his third walk of
the day to make it first and third
with no outs. Sprague singled up
the middle to bring in Paulsen
and move Witmeyer to third.
After an intentional walk to Paul
Carey, Robbins singled sharply to
right-center to make the score 5-3.
Plemel retired the Trojans in
order in the bottom of the 10th
to secure the win.
Card notes

Stanford plays St. Mary's today at
2:30 p.m. at Moraga, the last game
of an eight-game road trip.
The Pac-10 yesterday named Paul
Carey the Six-Pac Player of the Week
for his performance against UCLA.
In three games against the Bruins,
Carey was six-for-10 with seven RBI,
a double and two home runs, includ
ing a game-winning three-run shot in
the 12th inning on Sunday.
Witmeyer's three walks yesterday
give him 27 for the year — tops on
the team.
Yesterday's win raises the Cardi
nal's record in extra-inning games
this year to 2-3.
Plemel struck out Trojan cleanup
hitter Jim Campania three times in
four at-bats yesterday. Campanis is
the grandson of deposed Los Angeles
Dodgers vice president A 1 Campanis.
LOS ANGELES - The
Stanford baseball team ran
on battery power yesterday.
Senior pitcher Lee Plemel
threw a splendid 10-inning
complete game and his bat
tery mate, senior catcher

Doug Robbins, knocked in two runs and
threw out two runners as the Cardinal
beat USC 5-3 in extra innings at Rod
Dedeaux Field.
The game was a makeup of a game that
was rained out earlier this season.
With the victory, Stanford's series with
Arizona State this weekend at Sunken Dia
mond becomes a showdown for first place
in the Pacific 10 Conference Southern Di
vision. The Cardinal, now 29-14 overall
and 13-8 in the Six-Pac, is a game behind
the league-leading Sun Devils (14-7), who
have won 23 games in a row.
"This was a huge game," Robbins said.
"If we lose it, we're two games back and
our backs are to the wall. Now we're a
game back and if we take two out of three
next weekend we're tied for first."
Plemel's performance was the key to the
game for the Cardinal. The senior
righthander kept the Trojans off-balance
the entire game with his repertoire of nasty
off-speed pitches mixed in with some stra
tegic fastballs, and looked strong for all 10
innings.
He gave up eight hits and two earned
runs, walked none and struck out seven
en route to his sixth win of the season to
go with six losses.
"1 had all my good stuff today — I had
