# Stanford on the NFL draft Card
## 
### 
Brad Muster could turn into
a Bear, Lion or Ram when he
goes through the annual circus
known as the NFL draft Sun
day.
While it is not yet known
who will choose Muster, he will
almost definitely be a first
round choice, probably taken
somewhere between No. 10 and
20. Several other Stanford
players should be tabbed as
well in the two-day affair.
Pro teams love the 6-foot-3,

226-pound Muster's size and
versatility, and he is considered
the top fullback in the draft.
Deceptively fast, Muster
gobbles up ground with his
long strides and is almost im
possible for one man to tackle.
He has also recovered from the
injuries that plagued his senior
year.
While pro scouts are seques
tered in last-minute meetings
and unavailable for comment,
Stanford Asst. Coach Larry
Kerr, who often deals with the
scouts, reported that there has
been extensive interest in
Muster.
"I'd be very surprised if he
wasn't drafted in the first
round," Kerr said. "Everybody
has contacted us about him."
The pros like not only his
physical talent but also his in
telligence. An Academic Ail-
American, Muster can think on
his feet, and this may give him
an edge over Craig Heyward,
the next highly rated fullback
on the board.
Though Muster played tail
back at Stanford, he will prob
ably play fullback in the NFL,
and there has even been some
talk of converting him to tight
end. Muster has excellent
hands and is a strong blocker,
which has led Miami and
several other teams to see him
as a tight end in the mold of
Los Angeles Raider All-Pro
Todd Christenson.
"He'd prefer to be a running
back," Kerr said. "He's such a
talented guy you can't get the

ball in his hands enough at
tight end."
If Muster has a weakness,
it's that his upright running
style leaves him vulnerable to
injuries. Muster was dogged by
injuries throughout his Stan
ford career, but when healthy
he's simply dynamite.
While pro scouts have prob
ably watched more film of
Muster than they have seen
their wives and kids over the
past few months, Jeff James
has also been drawing a lot of
interest.
James is an outstanding pos
session receiver who runs
precise routes and has good
hands and decent speed, but,
according to Kerr, he will prob
ably go somewhere between the
third and fifth rounds. James'
draft position has been hurt by
the fact that receivers are prob
ably the deepest and strongest
position in the draft.
The headliner is Heisman
Trophy winner Tim Brown
from Notre Dame, but South
Carolina's Sterling Sharpe and
Miami's Michael Irvin are
nearly as highly regarded.
Other top receivers include
Tennessee's Anthony Miller,
Indiana's Ernie Jones, LSU's
Wendell Davis and Arizona
State's Aaron Cox.
What distinguishes these
wideouts is that they are nearly
all extremely fast, and the pros
are in love with speed because
it can be quantitatively mea
sured. This wealth of speed will
probably keep James from
being one of the top dozen
receivers picked even though
he had a better college career
than many of the wideouts who
will be chosen before him.
"A lot of guys are looking
for a burner that can really
stretch a defense," Kerr said.
"He (James) is very highly
thought of. It's just a matter
of what teams are looking for."
Teams are seldom looking for
punters in the draft, and this
will hurt Doug Robison.
Despite averaging nearly 46
yards per punt, Robison will
probahly go no higher than the
eighth round and may not be
drafted at all.
Like James, Robison is hurt
by a plethora of strong seniors
at his position. Ohio State's
Tommy Tupa will be the top
punter picked, not only because


BRENDAN HEALEY
he can punt the ball into orbit
but also because he plays quar
terback and could pull double
duty for a pro team. Michigan

State's Greg Montgomery and
California's Scott Tabor are also
top punters, but Kerr said
Robison should be the No. 2
punter taken.
Safety Brad Humphreys prob
ably played his way into the draft
with a fine senior season but prob
ably won't be taken in the first

six to eight rounds. Humphreys
picked off six passes en route to
an All-Pacific 10 Conference
season, but he too will be hurt
by having only adequate speed at
a position where flying feet are
prized.
Two other Stanford players who
might be picked are defensive

back Bruce Richardson and tight
end Eric Snelson. Snelson is a
strong blocker, and Kerr called
Richardson "the one guy who
could sneak in ... . because of his
outstanding special teams play."
If the draft is anything, though,
it's unpredictable and how it will
all shake out remains to be seen.

telligence. An Academic Ail-
American, Muster can think on
his feet, and this may give him
an edge over Craig Heyward,
the next highly rated fullback
on the board.
Though Muster played tail
back at Stanford, he will prob
ably play fullback in the NFL,
and there has even been some
talk of converting him to tight
end. Muster has excellent
hands and is a strong blocker,
which has led Miami and
several other teams to see him
as a tight end in the mold of
Los Angeles Raider All-Pro
Todd Christenson.
"He'd prefer to be a running
back," Kerr said. "He's such a
talented guy you can't get the

ball in his hands enough at
tight end."
If Muster has a weakness,
it's that his upright running
style leaves him vulnerable to
injuries. Muster was dogged by
injuries throughout his Stan
ford career, but when healthy
he's simply dynamite.
While pro scouts have prob
ably watched more film of
Muster than they have seen
their wives and kids over the
past few months, Jeff James
has also been drawing a lot of
interest.
James is an outstanding pos
session receiver who runs
precise routes and has good
hands and decent speed, but,
according to Kerr, he will prob
ably go somewhere between the
third and fifth rounds. James'
draft position has been hurt by
the fact that receivers are prob
ably the deepest and strongest
position in the draft.
The headliner is Heisman
Trophy winner Tim Brown
from Notre Dame, but South
Carolina's Sterling Sharpe and
Miami's Michael Irvin are
nearly as highly regarded.
Other top receivers include
Tennessee's Anthony Miller,
Indiana's Ernie Jones, LSU's
Wendell Davis and Arizona
State's Aaron Cox.
What distinguishes these
wideouts is that they are nearly
all extremely fast, and the pros
are in love with speed because
it can be quantitatively mea
sured. This wealth of speed will
probably keep James from
being one of the top dozen
receivers picked even though
he had a better college career
than many of the wideouts who
will be chosen before him.
"A lot of guys are looking
for a burner that can really
stretch a defense," Kerr said.
"He (James) is very highly
thought of. It's just a matter
of what teams are looking for."
Teams are seldom looking for
punters in the draft, and this
will hurt Doug Robison.
Despite averaging nearly 46
yards per punt, Robison will
probahly go no higher than the
eighth round and may not be
drafted at all.
Like James, Robison is hurt
by a plethora of strong seniors
at his position. Ohio State's
Tommy Tupa will be the top
punter picked, not only because

he can punt the ball into orbit
but also because he plays quar
terback and could pull double
duty for a pro team. Michigan

State's Greg Montgomery and
California's Scott Tabor are also
top punters, but Kerr said
Robison should be the No. 2
punter taken.
Safety Brad Humphreys prob
ably played his way into the draft
with a fine senior season but prob
ably won't be taken in the first

six to eight rounds. Humphreys
picked off six passes en route to
an All-Pacific 10 Conference
season, but he too will be hurt
by having only adequate speed at
a position where flying feet are
prized.
Two other Stanford players who
might be picked are defensive

back Bruce Richardson and tight
end Eric Snelson. Snelson is a
strong blocker, and Kerr called
Richardson "the one guy who
could sneak in ... . because of his
outstanding special teams play."
If the draft is anything, though,
it's unpredictable and how it will
all shake out remains to be seen.
