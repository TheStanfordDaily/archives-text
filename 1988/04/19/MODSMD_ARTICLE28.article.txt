# Nelson makes unexpected contributions

Stanford men's volleyball cap
tain Brad Nelson didn't start Sat
urday night against Pepperdine.
He also stands only six feet tall
— short for a volleyball player.
But Nelson, a senior and one
of only five returning lettermen
on a young Cardinal team, may
be the most valuable member of
the squad.
For such an important player,
Nelson's beginnings are rather
unlikely. He attended the Amer
ican School in London before com
ing to Stanford. There, he was
captain and most valuable player
of the volleyball team.
At Stanford, it was a slightly
different story. As a non
scholarship athlete, Nelson
started out as a back-row special
ist, where he got very little time
as a freshman.
"Brad had the disadvantage of
not growing up in the volleyball
rich areas of California and
Hawaii," junior teammate Dave
Johnson said. "He had to work
extra hard."
Nelson agreed. "I had to adjust
to the higher caliber of play in
the United States," he said.
Every summer, Nelson has put
in time on his game and come
back vastly improved. By junior
year, he was playing outside hit
ter, his current position. Still, his
contribtions were mainly as a
team leader during practices.
This year, however, he is
making his presence felt during
the games themselves.
"He has payed his dues," Stan
ford Coach Fred Sturm said of
Nelson, who has ccme on to start
half of Stanford's games this
season. "His progress has been
phenomenal."
According to Sturm, Nelson's
strengths on the court are his
defense and passing ability — he
is probably the best passer on the
team.
"His skills are very good all
around," sophomore teammate
Parker Blackman said. "He is very
consistent, and always enthusias
tic."
"Brad is always ready to work,"
sophomore teammate Dan Hanan
said. "He just doesn't get discour
aged."
Though he doesn't have classic
volleyball player's height, at 178
pounds, Nelson is still a physically
strong player.
"I have to make up for my
height with intensity and aggres
siveness," Nelson said. It doesn't
hurt that he can also jump — he
possesses a 36-inch vertical leap.
On the court, Nelson always ap
pears confident. He has good
"court sense." "Brad is alwavs

calm and collected," Johnson said.
"He never shows too much emo
tion."
But Nelson has been frustrated
much of this year. He had hoped
for Stanford to make the Western
Regional Championships this
year, but that goal is now out of
reach. The Cardinal is currently
4-12 in the Western Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association,
without a doubt the toughest con
ference in the nation.
"I've been disappointed in my
play, especially because we've
been playing bad," Nelson said.
"I sometimes feel like I've let the
team down."
Senior Darryl Rouse disagreed,
indicating that Nelson has given
support and stability to the team.
"He has kept the team together
emotionally, and kept our per
formance high, even in hard
times," Rouse said. "Brad is solid.
He always gives his all."

Nelson was voted by
the team to be 'best
roommate to have on
a road trip, because
of his organization
and his access to the
rental car/

So if Nelson's statistics don't
stand out, his personality and
leadership do. "Brad exemplifies
everything I could ask for in a
Stanford volleyball player,"
Sturm said. "We certainly will
miss him next year."
Sturm holds great respect for
Nelson, to such an extent that
Nelson serves as a relay between
him and the team. Nelson is the
force that pulls the squad to
gether, making a lot of key deci
sions on behalf of the team.
"(Nelson) is simply a great
leader by example," Sturm said.
"He has the respect of the players
and coaches."
Sturm said that the team is
Nelson's top priority, whether on
the court or in practice.
"I think 1 provide game exper
ience when 1 come in," Nelson
said. "Sometimes we're just six
individuals out there. I can make
us gel."
Hanan added that Nelson goes
out of his way to get to know his
teammates, so that everyone on
the squad considers him to be a
best friend.
In fact, Nelson was voted by
the team to be "best roommate
to have on a road trip, because
of his organization and his access
to the rental car," Johnson said.

Almost invariably, the first
thing that comes to mind when
his name is mentioned to his
teammates is his good nature.
"Brad is a fantastic guy," Rouse
said. "He cares about how well
he plays and about how well the
team plays."
Coming first to mind for Nelson
are his academics, as he realizes
that volleyball cannot be a career
for him. "I'm not like Scott For
tune," Nelson said. "I won't have

a future in volleyball. I have to
keep academics as my top
priority." (Fortune is a senior who
has stopped out to train with the
national team for the Olympics
this summer. He will return to
the team next year.)
Nelson is looking for a job in
consulting right now, to put to
use his degree in Industrial En
gineering. He'll be finished with
competitive volleyball, he said, ex
cept for an occasional beach game.


Outside hitter Brad Nelson started his volleyball hitting from way
outside — In London. The senior has come on this year to be a
valuable cog for the Stanford machine.
