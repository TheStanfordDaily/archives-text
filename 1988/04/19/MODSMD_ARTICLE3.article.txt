# Bennett blasts Fac Sen
## CIV is 'closing of Stanford mind' 
### John Pollack Senior staff writer 
Sharply criticizing Stanford's
recent overhaul of its Western
Culture program, U.S. Secretary
of Education William Bennett last
night accused the University of
capitulating to a student cam
paign of "pressure politics and in
timidation."
Speaking to a packed Cubberley
Auditorium, Bennett said that the
Faculty Senate's debate over pro
posed changes in the Western Cul
ture requirement was distorted by
politically motivated student
protest.
Bennett said the students' "tac
tics of intimidation" rain contrary
to the West's intellectual tradition
of rational discourse. He accused
supporters of the University's

newly adopted Cultures, Ideas
and Values program of discourag
ing free and open debate on the
issue.
"In the end, CIV stands as a
political product of a political
process," he said.
Bennett said that Stanford will
ultimately be harmed — though
not visibly — by the decision."For
a moment," Bennett said,"a great
university was brought low by the
very forces which modern univer
sities came into being to oppose
— ignorance, irrationality and in
timidation."
University President Donald
Kennedy — in New York last
night on a fund-raising trip —
released a sharp written rebuttal
to Bennett's remarks.
Kennedy attacked Bennett's as
sertion that the Faculty Senate
was pressured into adopting the
CIV proposal and accused the sec
retary of being either "ill in
formed or irresponsible."
"Those violations which the sec
retary decries most — ignorance,
bullyism, name calling and polit
ical intimidation — have been
practiced more by those outside
the debate than those who have
been more meaningfully engaged
in it," Kennedy wrote.
"Stanford advocates on all sides
have indeed been active and vocal,
but they have always been
respectful and often eloquent,"
Kennedy added. "No vocal minor
ity has domineered; rather, the
debate has been marked by ex
haustive process and public
airing."
Senate Chair Gerald Lieber
man, professor of operations re
search, also denied that intimida
tion was a factor in the senate's
final decision. "I did not sense
any coercion or intimidation

whatsoever," Lieberman wrote in
a prepared statement. "The
record-breaking attendance [at
the meeting] indicated every rep
resentative who took the issues
seriously. When the debate ended,
individual senators voted their
consciences," Lieberman stated.
Bennett cited four reasons why
students should study Western
culture.
• Because it is the West'a heri
tage;
• because this heritage is —
though blotted by certain injus
tices — essentially "good;"
• because it is "a source of incom
parable intellectual complexity
and diversity and depth" and;
• because "the West is under at
tack," both from within and with
out.
At an airport press conference
yesterday afternoon, Bennett said
the political motivation behind
the student protest was a "stand
ard left-wing agenda found at
many universities." He character
ized this agenda as a "combina
tion of Marxism and feminism."
Although he did say students
should study non-Western cul
tures, Bennett emphasized that
this study should not come at the
expense of time spent studying
Western culture.
Surprisingly, members of the
three student groups that had
demonstrated most actively for
ClV's passage — the Black Stu
dent Union, MEChA and Stu
dents United for a Democratic Ed
ucation — did not protest at last
night's event.
SUDE member Kathy Coll said
these groups felt the CIV battle
was already won and that Bennett
"does not deserve that much ef
fort or energy."
Several times during his speech,
Bennett was interrupted by ap
plause, as well as hisses of disap
proval. After his address, the sec
retary fielded questions — many

of them hostile — from the au
dience.
Black Student Union Chair Bill
King asked Bennett why he
postponed his visit to Stanford
until after the senate had ruled
on Western Culture. "Why are
you coming today to try to undo
what we have worked for for eight
years?" King asked, referring to
campus debate over the Western
Culture program, which was in
stituted in 1980.
Bennett responded that he did
not come earlier because he was
not aware of the Stanford debate

until it appeared in the national
press.
Speaking on the same subject
at the press conference, Bennett
said he stayed away because he
did not want to unfairly pressure
the senate.
"I thought it was important to
give the faculty the opportunity
to discuss the issue," Bennett
said.
A few students accused Bennett
of being uninformed about the
debate here. Responding, he chal
lenged his accusers to cite inac
curacies in his statements.

At the afternoon press confer
ence, Bennett acknowledged that
he had not spoken directly with
any Stanford faculty members
concerning the CIV debate. He
did say he had received corre
spondence from several professors
on the matter, but declined to
disclose their names.
Bennett originally spoke out on
the CIV issue in January, when
he was quoted in a New York
Times article as saying Stanford's
academic leadership was "readily
intimidated by the noisiest of its
students and faculty."
