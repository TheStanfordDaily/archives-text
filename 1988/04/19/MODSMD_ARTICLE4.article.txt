# Researcher suspended
## Humane Society charge sparks revelation 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
The University in December
revoked a Stanford researcher's
right to use laboratory animals
because he mistreated a cat in an
experiment, Medical School Dean
David Korn revealed Friday.
Responding to criticism by the
Palo Alto Humane Society, on
Dec. 17 the Stanford Administra
tive Panel on Laboratory Animal
Care suspended the researcher,
whom Korn would not name, be
cause he failed to follow approved
protocols in animal research and
because his attitude toward inves
tigators was "hostile (and) un
cooperative," Korn said.
The researcher used only one
of two anaesthetics required by
protocol while inserting a tube
down the throat of a cat on Nov.
20, Korn said in a press release.
The researcher acknowledged
having done the same thing to

the same cat on an earlier occa
sion, Korn said.
Attempts to ascertain the re
searcher's identity have been un
successful and officials at the
Medical School have refused to
identify the man because of re
search protocols protecting his
anonymity. Korn was not avail
able for comment last night.
Stanford librarian Lise Giraud,
a member of the Humane Society
Advisory Board, sparked the rev
elation with a March 22 letter to
Korn, charging that the Univer
sity "is guilty of conspiracy and
cover-up" of a criminal offense.
To answer Giraud's charges,
Korn responded Friday by releas
ing the information that a re
searcher's right to use animals
had been suspended, but he said
the name could not be revealed.
Korn also denied that violation of
this research protocol could be
characterized as a crime.
Donald Stanski, chair of the

committee that suspended the re
searcher, said yesterday that the
Humane Society was using the
suspended research to publicize
this week's "World Week for Lab
oratory Animals." Events for the
week, which was organized by the
Humane Society and other animal
rights groups, include a march
and protest here tomorrow and a
"day of mourning" for lab animals
Saturday in Palo Alto.
"It was not something we
wanted to advertise, but we were
perfectly willing to reveal the in
formation," Stanski said when
asked about the cover-up charge.
"We reported it to the proper au
thority, and we had it very care
fully documented."
Joanne Blum, associate director
of the Division of Laboratory
Animal Medicine, reported the
violation on Nov. 24 to the Ad
ministrative Panel on Laboratory
Animal Care. The panel regularly
monitors animal research to en
sure that all experimentation
complies with University protocol
and general guidelines established
by the National Institutes of
Health.
Blum subsequently met with
the researcher and found him to
be "confrontational and hostile,"
Korn said in the release.
Stanski said the researcher,
who has been at Stanford for a
number of years, was asked to
follow protocol but responded

with the attitude that he was
going "to do his own thing."
The researcher is continuing re
search at Stanford but will not
be doing any "active animal ex
periments" until the panel rules
that he can continue with such
research, Stanski said.
"It is a question of him deciding
that he wants to continue and
then getting the proper working
relationship with (the commit
tee)," Stanski said. He added that
the panel needs to be assured that
the researcher's attitude toward
animal protection guidelines had
changed before it would restore
the researcher's priviliges.
Giraud said she is not satisfied
with the suspension.
