WASHINGTON — A Hoover Institu
tion official who was Attorney General
Edwin Meese Ill's choice for the Justice
Department's second-ranking position
has decided to drop out of consideration
for the post.
Justice Department and other admin
istration sources said yesterday they ex
pect John Shepherd, chair of the Hoover
Board of Overseers, a St. Louis lawyer
and former president of the American
Bar Association, to announce this week

that he is withdrawing from considera
tion to become deputy attorney general.
Shepherd said in an interview with
The Washington Post Friday night that
he was "giving very serious considera
tion" to withdrawing because of the "tre
mendous pressure that this whole ordeal
has been on me and my wife."
Shepherd was to have replaced Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns, who is
leaving at the end of this week because
of what sources have described as a belief
that Meese, under investigation by an
independent counsel, has lost the "moral
authority" to head the Justice Depart
ment.

Shepherd, whom Meese selected after
retired federal judge Arlin Adams said
he could not leave his Philadelphia law
firm to accept the post, has come under
fire because of his membership in an
all-white country club and an all-male
social club in St. Louis.
In addition, Justice Department
sources said Shepherd and his wife have
been upset about recent news reports on
a trial earlier this year in which a former
bookkeeper from Shepherd's law firm
was convicted of embezzling $147,000.
The bookkeeper, Denise Sinner, pre
sented as her defense the claim that she
was having an affair with Shepherd and

that he authorized her to write checks
to herself to pay overdue bills and buy
luxury items. Shepherd took the witness
stand and denied having the affair.
In addition to convicting her of em
bezzlement, the jury found Sinner guilty
of making a false statement to the gov
ernment when she told prosecutors a doc
tor had diagnosed her as having terminal
cancer.
The move represented a new setback
for Meese, who has been striving to show
— by moving swiftly to fill the vacancies
— that the Justice Department can con
tinue to function normally despite his
continuing legal problems. "I don't know

when, or if, we're going to be able to fill
these jobs," one administration source
knowledgeable about the selection proc
ess said Monday.
The sources said Meese had also ex
pected Francis Keating 11, assistant trea
sury secretary for enforcement, to start
work at the Justice Department this week
as acting associate attorney general, but
that White House officials advised
Keating not to join the department betep
being nominated by the president, w
Meese testified yesterday for the fifth
time before the federal grand jury inves
tigating the attorney general's role in the
Wedtech scandal and other dealings.
