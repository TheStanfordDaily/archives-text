Greeting card writing, you ask? It's not as crazy as
it sounds. If you have a good sense of humor and
the ability to write messages people want to send,
then we want to hear from you regardless of your
field of study.
Just show us what you can do by sending some
recent samples of your work or mock -up a dozen or
so card ideas on folded paper. Use the photos in

successfully on Contemporary Cards.) Send them
