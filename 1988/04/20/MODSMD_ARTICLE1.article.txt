WASHINGTON - University
President Donald Kennedy and
U.S. Secretary of Education
William Bennett brought Stan
ford's Western Culture debate to
the nation's capital last night.
The pair — both of whom hold
strong and opposing opinions
about the Faculty Senate's recent
decision to replace Stanford's
Western Culture requirement
with a track called Cultures, Ideas
and Values — sparred for about
15 minutes on PBS's Mac-
Neil/Lehrer News Hour, which is
broadcast from New York and
Washington. Kennedy stopped in
Washington after a New York
fund-raising trip, and Bennett
returned here yesterday morning
after speaking at Stanford.
Echoing his Monday speech at
Stanford, Bennett said the Fac
ulty Senate's decision to adopt the
CIV proposal was "not a product
of enlightened debate."
Kennedy disagreed with this
characterization, arguing that the
decision was the product of an
intellectual process that ended

with "the Stanford faculty decid
ing how it best could teach."
While Bennett accused Stanford
of "trashing Western culture,"
Kennedy said he "believe(s) that
the study of Western culture will
be made more valuable by the
introduction" of works from other
cultures.
When moderator Robert Mac-
Neil asked if the senate's decision
was "just and right," Kennedy
replied without hesitation: "Plain
ly."
In an exclusive interview with
The Daily just prior to the pro
gram, Bennett said his concern
about the decision prompted him
to speak out publicly. "I care
about the content of college
courses, and I care about what
goes on on college campuses," he
said.
Stanford has a big impact on
the national collegiate scene, Ben
nett said. "What Stanford does
matters."
Bennett portrayed himself as a
voice for what he thinks is an
unheard meyority on the Stanford
campus. "I was confident that
there were students at Stanford
who thought that this was an ill
conceived and ill-executed plan,"

he said.
Answering that charge after the
program, Kennedy said Bennett's
position "did not come from a
cross-section of the academic com
munity."
Both in the interview and on
the show, Bennett described the
campaign to change the Area One
requirement as one of intimida
tion and coercion. Those who op
posed the decision were automat

ically deemed "racist," he said.
But Kennedy questioned Ben
nett's facts. "He has not repre
sented the situation accurately,"
Kennedy said. Specifically, Ken
nedy attacked Bennett's charges
that the senate felt intimidated
by student activities in favor of
the CIV proposal.
On the whole, however, Ken
