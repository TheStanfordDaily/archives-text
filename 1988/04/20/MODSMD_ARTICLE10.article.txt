# Stanford expert testifies on SDI

### Amy liosenfeld Staff writer 
Besides proving insufficient to
protect the nation against ac
cidental nuclear launches, a pro
posed $5 billion to $10 billion
defense system could unintention
ally prompt a full Soviet response,
a Stanford arms control expert
told Congress this morning.
Ted Postol, a senior research
assistant at the Stanford Center
for International Security and
Arms Control, testified on the
heels of six potential arms con
tractors as an expert witness
before the House Armed Services
Committee in Washington.
Postol's advice will be impor
tant if it "alerts Congress to the
fact that the USSR can interpret
such a system" as a security
threat, according to Jerry
Sanders, academic coordinator for
the Department of Peace and Con
flict Studies at UC-Berkeley.
An accidental launch protection
system "would only be able to
protect the United States from a
very small subset of accidental
launches," Postol said.
Sanders said the full impact of
Postol's admonition will be un
known until the United States
begins proceedings at next
month's Moscow summit.
According to Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of the Stanford

Linear Accelerator Center, Pos
tol's testimony was partially in
response to questions raised by
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., on the
dangers of implementing such a
system.
Postol recently did an in-depth
analysis of Lockheed's initial plan
for the system. The system would
be located in Grand Forks, N.D.,
and would use interceptive mis
siles to "catch" nuclear weapons
launched accidentally.
Postol told the committee the
proposed system would be inef
fective in defending the entire
United States from all but the
smallest, least advanced missiles
because it assumes only a few in
tercontinental ballistic missiles
would be launched. According to
Postol, "a boatload is more likely."
In addition, once the ALPS sys
tem's non-nuclear missiles are
launched, Soviets could on radar
detect a number of rapidly moving
objects that could be misidentided
as ICBMs, Postol said.
"If such a launch happens to
occur during a period of nigh ten
sion, it might precipitate a Soviet
decision to launch forces that
might mistakenly be seen as un
der attack," he told the commit
tee.
Sanders agreed with Postol's
conclusions and said he worried
the Soviets might interpret the
system as a threat to their secu
t

rity, becau°c protective weapons
could then be used against them.
According to Panofsky. a "much
more promising alternative to
trying to catch" accidentally
launched missiles would be to
agree with the Soviet Union to
install range-safety instrumenta
tion on missiles, enabling the
country that launched the weap
ons to destroy them on command.
"If the United States goes
ahead with ALPS, the Soviets will
begin to develop systems of their
own," Sanders said. "It will look
like the U.S. is trying to gain an
advantage. *
