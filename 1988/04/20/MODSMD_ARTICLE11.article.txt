# Former Panther roars again
## Activist Eldridge Cleaver, reborn Republican 
### Pia Ali-Salaam 
A former leader of the
militant Black Panthers organ
ization urged students last night
in Ujamaa to do everything in
their power to "sabotage" the
Republican party in this year's
election.
While it may sound as though
little has changed since Eldridge
Cleaver's Panther days, Cleaver
is now a Republican himself and
believes the public should work
within the system to effect such
drastic change.
Although the two-party sys
tem is "natural to the United
States," Cleaver said the U.S.
public must "bury present (re
publican) leaders" such as Pres
ident Reagan.
He also said it was a "mistake
of blacks to reject the Republi

can party as a whole since it
[represents] 50 percent of the
political process."
Cleaver, who formerly sought
change by "patroling the streets
with guns," now said he feels
change can best be brought
about if blacks support both po
litical parties and enter the eco
nomic arena in a "systematic
manner."
He encouraged young blacks
to acquire land and use their
abilities to create cities that ex
press black themes. Private
ownership among black people
would give them power and al
low them to shrug off their de
pendence on the Democratic
party, Cleaver said.
Although he is a Republican,
Cleaver said he feels the success
of democratic presidential can
didate Jesse Jackson is the sign

of a new era. The 1970s and
early 1980s were a period of
"quiet and reorganization," he
said.
According to Cleaver, Jackson
is causing the "forces of change
to coalesce." He predicted Jack
son would win in 1988 and if
not "would inevitably win in
1992."
Cleaver encouraged students
to become leaders in the private
sector and both political parties,
deal with health-care problems,
legalize drugs and get rid of the
government's "policing of our
bodies."
According to Cleaver, the gov
ernment is trying to "monitor
our bodily fluids through drug
testing on the job and in sports
under the guise of trying to save
America from crack."
