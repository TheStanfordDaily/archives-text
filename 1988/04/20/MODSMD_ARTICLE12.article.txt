World-renowned Mexican poet
and critic Octavio Paz read selec
tions from his works Monday
night to an enthusiastic, standing
room only crowd in Kresge
Auditorium.
Paz said he chose "some
(poems) about humor, others
about love, about nature, about
the city," and read selections that
were "not too long" because of
the large audience.
Paz read his works in their
original Spanish, while English
Prof. Kenneth Fields read them
in translation.
Paz, who writes often about his
native Mexico, creates works that
teem with natural imagery.
Among the poems he read Monday
were some "about time and the
surf," and others dedicated to his
torical figures whom he admires.
He also read selections which
he said define "identity," and a
number of poems which talked of
poetry itself: "Poetry speaks and
listens," reads one of his poems.
"It is real."
Paz said he has always been
"interested in humans and ideas,"
and that this interest has influ
enced his work. His study of an
thropology and history often sur

listens. It is real.'

faces in his poetry.
Poetry can help us better un
derstand history, Paz said. "At
this moment ... nobody knows
exactly what is history," he said.
But "in some ways poetry ex
presses history" — which in part
explains humanity's fascination
with it.
Yet, Paz explained, "in some
ways poetry transcends history,
goes beyond it." For Paz, this is
what makes poetry so vital to so
ciety, and so timeless.
Paz was born in Mexico City in
1914. He published his first poem
at age 17 and continues to write
poetry as well as philosophical,
literary and political essays.
Paz worked for 22 years in
Mexico's foreign service, where he
gained knowledge in how "to deal
with human affairs," he said.
During part of this period, Paz
was Mexico's ambassador to In

dia. He resigned this post in
protest of his government's mas
sacre of student demonstrators at
the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.
According to Paz, there comes a
point where "one cannot repre
sent one's government in all
honesty."
After resigning, Paz went on to
teach at Cambridge University,
the University of Texas and Har
vard.
Published in 1987, Paz' latest
collection of poetry is titled "A
Tree Within." Along with his writ
ing and lecturing, Paz edits
"Return," a Latin American in
tellectual magazine.
After leaving Stanford, Paz will
return to Mexico for a short stay,
and then continue on to Europe.
Paz visited Stanford as a part
of the Jean and Bill Lane Lecture
Series. Sponsored by the Creative
Writing Department, this series
brings to Stanford one writer each
quarter. Recent readings were
given by Ved Mehta, Toni Mor
rison, Raymond Carver and
Nadine Gordimer.
According to Kathy Ganas of
the Creative Writing Department,
the program seeks to find well
known writers "who are poets and
creative writers" while also being
interested in other areas.
