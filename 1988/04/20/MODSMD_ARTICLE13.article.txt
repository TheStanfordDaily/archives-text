# Stanford team seeks vaccine breakthrough
## AIDS researchers win NIH grant 
### Camilla Cavendish 
Two Stanford scientists will
today be awarded substantial
federal funding for a new line of
research into AIDS vaccinations.
Edward Mocarski, assistant
professor of medical microbiology
at Stanford Medical School, and
Harry Greenberg, chief of the di
vision of gastroenterology, will
receive about $330,000 for the
first year of their work. The grant
is sponsored by the National In
stitutes of Health.
The Stanford doctors form one
of six designated teams doing re
search into acquired immune de
ficiency syndrome. Between them,
the teams will receive a total of
$4 million.
Mocarski said he is "very hap

py" about the grant. "It has given
us the opportunity to pursue
novel ideas. . .. We should have
concrete indications within the
year as to whether these can
work."
However, financial security
does not mean a vaccine is within
easy reach. "No one is at all clear
yet what the best approach is:
That's what we are testing for,"
he said.
The award comes on the heels
of a breakthrough by another
Stanford scientist, Mike McCune,
who recently discovered that en
zymes make the human im
munodeficiency virus infectious.
McCune receives no NIH funding.
While McCune is investigating
the effect of enzymes on proteins,
Mocarski and Greenberg are

pursuing different lines of in
quiry. Mocarski is seeking to
restrain the virus by injecting
small amounts of altered HIV
proteins: "We hope to be able to
mimic the natural infection,
which will then trigger the im
mune response system."
Greenberg is working to develop
antibodies which would attach
themselves to the AIDS virus and
kill it.
He said the grant will help solve
a vexing dilemma for many sci
entists involved in AIDS research:
Whether to concentrate on vacci
nations as a way to prevent AIDS,
or to vaccinate those already in
fected. With the new grant,
Greenberg said, "both these ap
proaches will be investigated in
the next five years."
