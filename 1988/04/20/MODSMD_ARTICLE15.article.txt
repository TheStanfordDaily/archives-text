Lobbying limits pass Senate
WASHINGTON — The Senate, reacting to
scandals involving Reagan administration ap
pointees, shouted approval yesterday of a bill
that would strengthen restrictions against lob
bying by former government officials and for
the first time extend the limits to former
members of Congress.
Conservative Republicans and liberal Dem
ocrats united in support of the landmark bill,
which would make it a crime for former
senators, House members and senior executive
branch officials to engage in many kinds of
paid lobbying for a year after leaving govern
ment service.
"For once, Congress is doing the right
thing," said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-
Ohio, a member of the Judiciary Committee.
"Day after day, we find former members of
Congress are getting unbelievably high fees
for influencing their former colleagues. Lob
byists should be paid for what they know, not
who they know."
Sponsors of the Senate bill included conser
vative Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who en
listed the support of Metzenbaum, his ideo
logical opposite. The measure, approved on a
voice vote with no dissent, now goes to the
House, where its prospects are uncertain. A
House Judiciary subcommittee plans hearings
tomorrow on similar legislation.
"In general we want to move in the same
direction as the Senate," said subcommittee
Chair Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
Court reduces religious rights
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
backing away from its once staunch protection
of rights of religious minorities, ruled yester
day that the government need not bend its
rules or alter its plans to accommodate a cit
izen's practice of his religion.
On a 5-3 vote, a conservative court majority
overturned a lower-court ruling from San
Francisco and said that the federal government
could build a logging road through a Northern
California forest that was considered sacred
land by Native Americans.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor conceded that
the road "could have devastating effect on
traditional Native American religious prac
tices" because tribal burial sites would be dis
turbed. But that harm to religious practice
need not deter the government, she said.
"However much we might wish it were
otherwise, government simply could not oper
ate if it were required to satisfy every citizen's
religious needs and desires," O'Connor wrote
for the Supreme Court."The First Amend
ment must apply to all citizens alike, and it
can give to none of them a veto over public
programs that do not prohibit the free exercise
of religion."
Although it was not clear whether the road
could be built under current environmental
law, the court's opinion represented a sharp
break from rulings dating back to 1962 in
which the justices have gone to great lengths
to protect claims of the "free exercise of reli
gion" against the needs of government.
Hamadi convicted in kidnap case
BONN, West Germany — A West German
court yesterday convicted Abbas Ali Hamadi,
a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, of assisting in the
kidnappings of two West German citizens in
Beirut and gave him an unexpectedly severe
sentence of 13 years in prison.
Abbas Hamadi, 29, is the older brother of
Mohammed Ali Hamadi, who is expected to
go on trial this summer on charges of helping
to stage the 1985 TWA airliner hijacking in
which a U.S. Navy diver was killed.
A five-judge state court in Duesseldorf found
Abbas Hamadi guilty of complicity in kidnap
ping two West German businessmen in
Lebanon in January 1987 to pressure the Bonn
government not to extradite his brother to
the United States to face trial.
The court found that Abbas Hamadi did not
participate in the physical abduction of the
hostages, but that he played an important role
in planning and carrying out the kidnappings.
He acted as the German-Arabic interpreter in
the abductors' dealings with the hostages, the
court ruled.
Hamadi also was found guilty of seeking to
coerce the West German government, and of
illegal possession of explosives. The defense
immediately appealed.
Arafat doesn't go to Wazir burial
TUNIS, Tunisia — Palestine Liberation Or
ganization Chairman Yasser Ararat balked yes
terday at flying to Syria to bury his assas
sinated military chieftain Khalil Wazir until
he has guarantees that Syrian President Hafez
Assad is serious about ending his six-year feud
with the PLO.
The burial of Wazir in Damascus yesterday
had been agreed to by the PLO on Monday,
after Assad proposed the idea to the widow
of Wazir, who was assassinated in his home
here Saturday by a commando force believed
to be Israeli.
Yesterday, Arafat paid a final tribute to his
close comrade-in-arms, also known as Abu
Jihad, in an emotional eulogy over his flower
draped coffin. He vowed revenge and promised
to see Wazir's body laid in Jerusalem "soon,
real soon."
But when the plane that took Wazir's bullet
riddled body to Damascus left Tunis on yes
terday morning, Yasser Arafat was unexpec
tedly not on board.
"A decision was made last night by the
political leadership (of the PLO) that Arafat
should not go to Damascus," said Arafat's
spokesman, Bassam Abu Sherif.
