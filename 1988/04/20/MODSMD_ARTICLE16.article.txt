# Hijackers release hostages

### 
ALGIERS, Algeria — The hijackers
of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet freed their
remaining 31 hostages early today and
surrendered to Algerian authorities in
return for what was believed to be a
promise of safe passage to another
country.
Looking haggard and dazed, the
hostages began filing off the jetliner
shortly after 6 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT), 16
days almost to the hour since their
ordeal began.
"I can't describe how I feel to be
free," said Mubarek Abdelazziz El-
Zeherran, 23, a Saudi student. "We
lived through a 16-day nightmare. It's
incredible that it's over."
It was not immediately clear why

the hijackers agreed to surrender, but
they apparently slipped off the plane
by the rear exit before the passengers
were released and Algerian officials
refused to disclose their whereabouts.
"This is a question for Algeria to
decide," Interior Minister Hadi
Khediri replied when asked what
would happen to the hijackers.
However, it was understood that the
terrorists, Shia Moslem militants be
lieve to be closely affiliated with Iran,
would be flown out of Algeria shortly
to an undisclosed destination.
"They will just disappear, what else
do you think?" an Algerian security
official said.
While the terms of the hijackers'

surrender, mediated over the past
week by Algerian officials, were not
disclosed, there was no indication that
Kuwait had agreed to free any of the
17 imprisoned terrorists whose release
the hijackers demanded when they
seized the airliner on a Kuwait-bound
flight from Bangkok April 5.
They diverted the plane first to a
northeastern Iranian city of Mashhad,
where at least one of the terrorists
reportedly joined the flight, bringing
machine guns and other heavy weap
ons aboard with him.
They flew next to Beirut, but denied
permission to land, touched down in
Larnaca, Cyprus, where the hijackers
killed two of their hostages before

flying on to Algeria one week ago.
The break in the crisis came shortly
before 4 a.m., when the hijackers an
nounced in a statement read from the
darkened cockpit that they were end
ing the hyacking.
Two hours later the first of the
hostages appeared at the top of the
mobile staircase positioned in front of
the main exit door and began descend
ing in single file to waiting cars and
buses.
A doctor who examined the pas
sengers briefly after they left the plane
said that they all appeared to be in
good physical health, although several
were suffering from severe emotional
distress. Loa Angeles Times
