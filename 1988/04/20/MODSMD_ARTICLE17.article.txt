# Dukakis takes N.Y.; Gore may quit race

NEW YORK — Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis handily won the bit
terly contested New York primary yes
terday, capturing most of the second
largest delegation to the Democratic
convention and taking a giant step
toward his party's presidential nomi
nation.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, though he
carried the city of New York by a
narrow margin and won about 90 per
cent of the black vote statewide,
finished second. Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. was a distant third and was
said to be on the verge of abandoning
his active pursuit of the nomination,
which would make the Democratic
competition a contest between Duka
kis and Jackson.
With returns from 97 percent of the
state's precincts reporting, Dukakis
had 51 percent of the vote, Jackson
37 percent and Gore 10 percent.
Vice President George Bush easily
won the Republican primary, running
basically unopposed. His New York
win brought him within a handful of
delegates needed to officially secure
the nomination.
Jackson's candidacy appeared to be
the dominant issue in the Democratic
campaign, according to a Los Angeles
Times survey of voters as they left
their polling places.
Jackson, whose success in New York
came despite personal attacks on him
by the city's Mayor Edward Koch, was
viewed favorably by 52 percent of the
voters interviewed and unfavorably by
34 percent. But Jackson fell short of
victory because he was able to get only
about 15 percent of the white vote
and because Gore, in a notably dismal
performance, was unable to deny Du
kakis a significant share of the white
vote.
Dukakis claimed victory at a rally
of supporters here by borrowing a line
from the song "New York, New York,"

declaring "Friends, if we can make it
here, we can make it anywhere."
While the crowd chanted "Duke,
Beat Bush," Dukakis pledged to carry
on the drive for the nomination to all
the remaining primary states. "And
after that," he said, "We will take our
message — the Democratic message
— to every part of this country."
Even before the polls closed at 9
p.m. EDT, Dukakis' campaign chair
man and close friend, Paul Brountas,
was already looking ahead to future
contests. "We want to wrap this (nom

ination) up," he told a reporter. "We
want to win."
But Brountas cautioned against
overconfidence in the remaining con
tests that include the Pennsylvania
primary next Tuesday, primaries in
Ohio and Indiana on May 3 and Cal
ifornia and New Jersey June 7. "I
think it would be a mistake to say
after we win New York that it will be
all downhill," he said.
Dukakis' victory here had important
practical and symbolic implications for

his candidacy. Winning most of the
state's 255-member convention dele
gation, second in size only to Califor
nia's, extended his delegate lead over
Jackson, giving him 1,032 delegates
to 833 for Jackson. The nominee must
secure at least 2,081 delegates.
And his success here provides an
important psychological boost to his
chances of gaining the backing of Dem
ocratic "super delegates," elected party
officials free to back whichever candi
date they choose.
