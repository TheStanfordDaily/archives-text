# Israel expels 8 agitators as crackdown continues
## 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” Israel yester
day expelled to Lebanon eight
more accused Palestinian activists
as the army continued its crack
down on the Arab uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
Meanwhile, Cabinet Minister
Ezer Weizman became the first
senior Israeli official to denounce
last weekend's assassination of
prominent Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Khalid Wazir
in Tunis. Weizman did not con
firm Israel's alleged role in the
killing, but he said Wazir's death
would harm the Middle East peace
process.
The expulsions raised to 20 the
number of Palestinians deported
since the uprising began Dec. 9.
Four more are appealing expul
sion orders issued last week in
the wake of the death of a young
Jewish settler in a West Bank
village, the first Israeli civilian to
be killed since the violence began.
Tirzah Porat, 15, died two
weeks ago in a clash between Arab
stone throwers and armed guards
who accompanied 16 young Is
raelis on a nature hike outside
the village of Beita. At first, army
investigators said Porat had been
stoned to death by the villagers.
But later they said she had been
shot with the gun of one of the
guards. The army is withholding
a final police report into the shoot
ing that reportedly was delivered
to army officials last week.
Six of those expelled yesterday
were residents of Beita whom the
army accused of participating in
the incident, and two others were
allegedly longtime West Bank ac
tivists. None were tried or con
victed before their expulsions,
which were ordered by the army.
All eight had filed appeals
against the expulsions but
withdrew them Monday, saying
they had no faith in the legal
process. Israel's High Court has
never overturned an expulsion or
der since the military occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza began
21 years ago.
A State Department press rep

resentative condemned the expul
sions, repeating the U.S. position
that such measures violate the
Fourth Geneva Convention and
due process of law. Israel has de
fended the measures as necessary
for the maintenance of order and
security that it claims is its chief
obligation as an occupier under
international law.
Large chunks of the West Bank
and Gaza were sealed off again
yesterday by the army, which also
clamped a curfew on 17 towns
and refugee camps for a third
straight day to quell rioting.
Nineteen Palestinians have been
killed since the Saturday slaying
of Wazir, bringing to at least 157
the number of Arabs killed since
the uprising began. Besides Porat,
one other Israeli haa been killed.
Large contingents of army and
police have been put on alert for
Wednesday, when Wazir is to be
buried in Damascus while Israelis
hold memorial day remembrances
for those who have died during
40 years of Arab-Israeli conflicts.
Until yesterday, the assassina
tion of PLO commander Wazir,
known as Abu Jihad, received
widespread applause from Is
raelis, ranging from the liberal
left to the far right. The popular
view has been that Israel is jus
tified in assassinating those like
Wazir who have planned and con
ducted terrorist attacks on Israeli
civilians.
But Weizman, a former defense
minister who sits in the policy
making inner cabinet, warned
that the move could harm Israeli
interests and further damage re
lations with Egypt, the only Arab
state to sign a peace treaty with
Jerusalem.
"It doesn't contribute to the
fight against terrorism; in princi
ple it creates more," Weizman told
Israeli army radio in an interview.
"It distances the peace process
and will bring greater hostility
and make us more vulnerable
around the world."
