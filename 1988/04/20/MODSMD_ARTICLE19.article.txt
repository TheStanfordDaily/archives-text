# Iran vows revenge on U.S.

### 
MANAMA, Bahrain — As Iranian
leaders vowed yesterday to avenge their
losses in the previous day's clashes with
American forces in the Persian Gulf,
regional analysts viewed the fighting as
part of a new chapter that will alter the
course of the seemingly endless Iran-
Iraq War.
Some used the term "watershed" to
describe recent developments, although
they admitted that it is not clear exactly
where events were heading.
They noted that Monday's attack
marked the first time that Iran's nine
year-old revolutionary government has
been humiliated by American military
strength.
"The Americans have shown the ex
tent of their firepower for all to see,"
noted Heino Kopietz, who monitors
developments in the Persian Gulf War
for the International Institute for Stra
tegic Studies in London. "It's bigger
than any previous U.S. action against
Iran. It's a watershed."
Iran's government-run radio said yes
terday that the attacks cost more than
40 Iranian lives in addition to the two
oil platforms, a patrol boat and a speed
boat. In addition, two frigates and two
other speedboats were severely dam
aged.
The commander of the Iranian navy,
Commodore Mohammed Hussein
Malekzadegan, said 15 sailors aboard
the patrol boat Joshan were killed and
20 others wounded when it was hit by
fire from the U.S. Navy cruiser Wain
wright.
He said others aboard the frigates
Sahand and Sabalan also lost their lives
after the vessels were hit by laser-guided
bombs and Harpoon missiles during ex
changes with U.S. warships.
Earlier reports indicated that workers
on the two oil platforms had also been
killed.
Monday's setback came as Iran ap
peared to have suffered a mtyor setback
in its land war with Iraq. The Baghdad
government reported that its forces, in
a 36-hour blitz launched Sunday, had
recaptured the Faw Peninsula, a bitterly
contested area at the very top of the
Gulf that has been held by Iran for
more than two years.
The U.S. government said that Iraq
had clearly "made advances" on the pen
insula but added that reports of fighting

continued and that there was still a
large Iranian presence in the area.
Together, the events on land and at
sea are viewed here as a significant psy
chological and military reverse for Iran,
effectively placing it on the defensive in
the Gulf conflict for the first time in
several years.
"Time is not on our side any more,"
declared the powerful Speaker of the
Iranian Parliament, Hashemi Rafsan
jani, in a television interview later broad
cast by Tehran Radio.
During the interview, Rafsanjani, who
is also press representative for Iran's
Supreme Defense Council, called on vol
unteers to "rush to the battlefields as
soon as possible."
He and other Iranian leaders de
scribed Monday's attack as part of an
international plot to support Iraq in its
war with Iran. The previous day, Tehran
Radio had contended that U.S. helicop
ters were supporting the Iraqis in the
Faw Peninsula fighting.
"We declare that we will forcefully
respond to America's bullying in attack
ing oil platforms and killing innocent
people, the official radio quoted Iranian
President Ali Khamenei as saying yes
terday.
While statements of revenge against
the United States, Iraq and Kuwait —
a country that has supported Iraq in
the conflict — were repeated frequently
on Tehran Radio during the course of
the day, it remained unclear exactly how
Iranian rhetoric might be matched by
action.
Further direct confrontations with the
superior firepower of U.S. warships in
the Gulf would appear to offer little for
Iran other than more losses.
However, there is also concern among
officials in the small, relatively vulner
able Arab states of the Gulf that Iran
will respond indirectly by stepping up
its marauding attacks on unprotected
commercial targets.
Initial indications pointed in this di
rection as Iranian gunboats hit two
tankers in the Strait of Hormuz yester
day. Iran's leaders may also be consid
ering raids against Kuwait or other
states sympathetic to Iraq in the war,
according to some of the sources.
