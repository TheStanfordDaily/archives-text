### Eric Young Staff writer 
Observers on campus dis
agreed yesterday about who
came out on top in last night's
televised debate between Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy and U.S. Secretary of Ed
ucation William Bennett.
"Don (Kennedy) was the
winner," said Biology Prof.
Craig Heller following the face
off between Kennedy and Ben
nett over Stanford's Area One
requirement. Heller chairs the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which helped to
redefine the requirement.
"Bennett continues to show
his lack of understanding of
what happened here," said Hel
ler, arguing that the secretary
is uninformed about Stanford's

reasons for dropping its West
ern Culture requirement in fa
vor of a program called Cul
tures, Ideas and Values.
However, College Republican
member Ken Rivera defended
Bennett's position. "I think
Bennett clearly [came out on
top]," said Rivera, a sopho
more. He faulted Kennedy for
"never [responding] to Ben
nett's argument that those
nine books were cut," referring
to the faculty decision to shrink
the Area One reading list next
year from 15 to six traditional
texts.
Heller said Kennedy's ap
pearance on the program was
necessary because the secre
tary "went out of his way" to
speak against the University's
decision.
