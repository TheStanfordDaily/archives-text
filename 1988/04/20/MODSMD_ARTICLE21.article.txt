## Let's take action 
### 
DON'T LET this good idea
die.
In an April 13 letter,
former Roble Resident Fellows
Evan and Ann Porteus reiterated
their proposal that every under
graduate "be required to partici
pate in at least one individual or
small group faculty-directed exper
ience while at Stanford."
The requirement would allow for
increased contact between under
graduates and faculty members.
Students could become involved in
anything from a thesis or a sem
inar to a faculty-directed research
project.
This would bring several
benefits to students and profes
sors. Students' education would
extend beyond the classroom and
in the process they would gain a
"faculty friend" who could write a
truly informed letter of recommen
dation. Faculty members would be
able to combine teaching, research
and advising and could encourage
undergraduates to pursue gradu
ate work in their disciplines.
The proposal is a great idea. But
that alone will not guarantee its
implementation. Passive support
for this well-intentioned proposal
is not enough to ensure its success.
The Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies first began considering
the Porteus' proposal in the fall
of 1986, but when the Area One
debate stole the spotlight last
spring the proposal was set aside.
Roble academic advisers have
been planning how the proposal

could be initiated for two years.
But once Roble Hall closed last
December, the central location for
finalizing the plan was lost. The
entire student body should pick up
the ball.
It won't be easy to convince al
ready overloaded faculty members
that this time-consuming require
ment would really be worth the
trouble. Incentive programs and
money for more professors will be
needed so that the faculty will have
the time to work with undergrad
uates.
It also won't be easy to convince
every student that this is a good
idea, either. Many students get
caught up on the large-class
syndrome and don't know or
bother to investigate the benefits
of a seminar or independent re
search project. Some find the
smaller classes more intimidating
because students are held more ac
countable for their work.
At Princeton University, all stu
dents are required to do a senior
thesis. This allows every graduat
ing senior the opportunity to get
to know a faculty member. Some
majors here, like English, require
students to take a seminar or
tutorial.
An increased number of innova
tive programs like these would en
courage more individualized and
rewarding education at Stanford.
An effort must be made by both
students and faculty for this ideal
to be reached and for the require
ment to work.
