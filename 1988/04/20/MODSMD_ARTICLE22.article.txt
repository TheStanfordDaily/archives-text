## Don't underrate those who criticize Israeli actions 
### 
IT WAS with a great deal of dismay
that I opened The Daily April 12
and saw Leslie Kaufman's column
attempt to justify the Israeli actions
within the occupied territories.
I disagree both with her description
of those who would question Israeli
policy as "often members of America's
affluent left grown impossibly spoiled
.. ." and with her trivialization of
Palestinian grievances.
I'm not sure how she came to the
conclusion that those who criticize
Israel are often spoiled, rich, American
leftists. As one who is not rich and
has never lived in Palo Alto or atten
ded Stanford (upon whose residents I
assume she based her opinion) I find
her statement naive and a bit insult
ing.
It reflects what I can only call the
ignorance and arrogance of youth and
it is completely irrelevent to her dis
cussion of Israel.
But I'm even more disturbed by a
deeper and darker implication of her
statement, for in her attempt to rebut

criticism of Israel by belittling its
critics, she mirrors a broader underly
ing policy of belittling Palestinian
concerns by stereotyping the Palestini
ans in particular and the Arabs in
general as a people uneducated, un
principled and uncivilized.
A perfect example of this is the
current "disturbances" in the occupied
territories that have claimed the lives
of about 137 Palestinians and two
Israelis. When 15-year-old Tirza Purat
was tragically killed (apparently by
another Israeli), little was said of the
two Palestinians who also died. In
stead, Palestinian homes were
destroyed, orchards bulldozed into the
ground and Israeli cries for revenge
still continue.
I'm also not quite sure how to inter
pret her statement: "If the Arab
countries had simply accepted Israel's
right to exist 20 years ago, there
would not have been a '67 war." Aside
from an obvious math error (20 years
ago was '68. I assume she meant 40

years), I have trouble accepting her
phrase "simply accept" given the actual
terms of the original United Nations
partition plan.
The partition plan that the UN
adopted was a plan to divide Palestine
between 1,300,000 Arabs and 650,000
Jews living there without the consent
of those Arabs (who were the msgority
of people).
In this plan the Jews, who actually
owned less than six percent of the land
and were a minority of the population,
were granted 56.4 percent of the coun
try. Would you, had you been an Arab,
"simply" accepted the "right" of this
partition, given that its whole founda
tion was both an insult and an ii\jus
tice to the indigenous Arab population?
The right of Israel to come into
existance in the form and manner that
it did may be questioned. Of Israel's
existance there is no doubt. Of the
Palestinian's right to their own state
there is also, to me, no doubt.
Israel refuses to acknowledge such a
right, one argument being the appar-

ent danger of having an independent
Palestinian state on its border. Given
the massive supremecy of the Israeli
armed forces, their nuclear arsenal,
and the fact that the Palestinians are
already on their border, I find this
argument hard to accept.
To me a more likely explanation is
that Israel, now that it has the land,
simply does not want to give it up. I
hope I'm wrong.
Finally, concerning all the fine
things that Israel has done for the
Palestinians in the land that it occu
pies, they are indeed quite laudable
(although I'm sure that there is also a
measure of "not so fine" things which
Kaufman failed to mention).
As she listed them I couldn't help
hearing echoes of the British who were
probably saying as they were being
thrown out of colony after colony,
baffled and bewildered, "we gave them
education, civilization, and trains that
run on time. Why do they hate us so?"
