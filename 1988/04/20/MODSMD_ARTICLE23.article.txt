# Whole campus hurt by BSU's fee loss
## 
### 
Elections have finished and the stu
dents have, ideally, had their say. A
new group of senators has been chosen
along with a new Council of Presi
dents. These people, we hope, will
bring innovations in the Stanford edu
cation.
However, this year's special fees
election left a frightening message
about change. In the wake of the new
Cultures, Ideas and Values proposal,
which was a combined effort of stu
dent groups, administration and facul
ty, the campus has sent a message to
student groups not to demand a

change by voting down the Black Stu
dent Union's fee request — an un
precedented action.
The BSU has been a continual vic
tim of false statements and bad press.
Efforts such as the Rainbow Coalition
have been labeled as radical ECU
movements. Membership controversies
have obscured the good works BSU
does for the Stanford community.
The BSU serves many functions. It
aids community service projects, brings
important speakers to campus and
runs cultural programs. How many
people have actually gone to these?
Clearly, if we are to learn anything
cross-culturallv as students, we need
groups such as the BSU and SaLSA.
In addition, as members of the Stan
ford community, these groups have the

right to funds to help their communi
ties and express their identities.
Looking at who won and lost in the
election, and not denying any group a
right to funding, I see a disturbing
sense of priorities.
After a debate on what a broad edu
cation means, the voters have made
decisions on their education outside
the classroom. Not enough seem to see
the merits of student groups working
to further their own sense of identity
and to educate the campus culturally
and politically.
Student minority groups are expected
to inform a student body that does not
want to be informed about their goals
and purposes. When a group stands up
in opposition to the status quo they
are sent a message: If you speak up,

we will try to shut you up. That will
not work.
The BSU and future victims have
fought long and hard and have too
important a purpose to be undone in
any way by such election results. While
I worry about the effect of an organi
zation that serves the black community
and the Stanford community at large
for 20 years, I worry even more about
what it says about us as students.
Clearly we need to learn more about
each other and to understand that
nothing is gained when we attempt to
silence individuals or groups for speak
ing up, except a narrower education.
And in that instance, who really pays?
