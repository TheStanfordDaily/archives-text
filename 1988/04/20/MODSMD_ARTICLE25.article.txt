## Ban housing priorities 
### 
GANG, LET'S DISCUSS The Draw,
and let's be candid. This inher
ently unfair system of allocating
student housing has got to be overhauled
as soon as possible, and the reasons are
clear (I can hear you now "Keith, tell
me more!").
Let's talk about unfairness. Let's talk
about returning residence priorities.
Oops, I'm sorry, I'm being redundant.
Seriously, the logic behind returning res
idence is faulty at best, and students who
draw poorly once are victims in the ul
timate case of double jeopardy.
In this year's Draw Book, the Stanford
Housing Office gives two reasons why
returning residence priority exists. First,
students who have been residents of a
house previously "can help carry on tradi
tions and provide program continuity and
support."
Sure. And secondly, "Students who feel
comfortable and like a particular resi
dence ... should be able to live in one
house for more than one year." Excuse
me?
What's this crap about "program con
tinuity"? Last time I checked, Whitman
House wasn't holding any multi-year
workshops or speakers' series, and 558
Mayfield wasn't carrying on any incred
ible "traditions."
(Wait, I was wrong. 558 Mayfield was
carrying on a tradition: one of superb
housing for a very lucky few.)
Give returning residence priority some
serious thought (if you can stomach it).

Basically, if you're a freshman now, this
Draw is the most important of your Stan
ford life. Draw well and pick your spot.
You did it. You can live wherever you
want for not one, but two years.
Guaranteed.
You can only move up to an even better
house if you draw lower next time. Draw
poorly next time you're guaranteed, and
back you go to your original, great house.
Gee, I feel for you. Pass the hankie.
Draw poorly as a freshman, however,
and life sucks. Ei\joy Stern. Now double
your pleasure, because (guess what?) you
get returning residence priority! Get
psyched! You get to carry on some won
derful traditions — like Eggplant Stack
up! Draw well next time and I congrat
ulate you. Now think of your friend who's
in Storey House. He's worried about The
Draw. No, really, he's sweating it out.
As a student, I'm forced to ask the
obvious question: Why should someone
who draws well one year be given a two
year gift of wonderful housing while those
who draw poorly are forced to compete
once again for better housing made even
more scarce by the ridiculous returning
residence priority?
In essence, returning residence priority
works only for those who draw well. In
a university (indeed in a society) where
equality of opportunity is the goal of all
programs, why should the doors of 558
and Storey remain open for two years to
those who draw well as frosh, while
remaining ever elusive and closed to far
too many?

Housing Office, wake up! The Draw is
patently unfair as long as returning res
idence priority exists. We all know that
the real traditions of a dorm are kept by
resident fellows and resident assistants,
and most of the traditions are in all-frosh
houses anyway.
Folks, there should be two guaranteed
draw pools, one with the numbers 1-1,500
and one with the numbers 1,501-3,000.
You pick which guaranteed year you .want
to draw from which pool, and good luck.
Next time you're guaranteed, you choose
from the other pool.
I'm sorry, but when the rich stay rich
(or can only get richer) and the poor
must prove themselves twice, some
thing's very wrong.
How ironic that this year's Draw theme
is Disneyland. In that enchanted land,
all is fair. Here at Stanford, things
couldn't be more unfair. The housing
system must be overhauled and returning
residence priority must be abolished.
And while you're at it, guys, tear down
those ugly trailers!
