## Cartoon gave wrong portrayal of Islam 
### 
The April 15 editorial cartoon depict
ing terrorism as the "Islamic Bomb" is
not only insulting to those of the Mus
lim faith, but perpetuates stereotypes
about a religion whose global influence
in ever increasing.
Edward Said, professor of English
and comparative literature at Columbia
University, addressing a conference on
terrorism held here in February,
pointed out that "terrorism is by now
subliminally associated in the first
instance with Islam, a notion no less
overused and vague than terrorism
itself. ... To my knowledge, of no
other country, no religion, culture or
ethnic group, except Islam and its
societies, has it been said that terror
ism is, after a fashion, endemic."
The cartoon is a case in point. Its
author did not choose to associate a
country with terrorist activities or even
a political group. The author specifi
cally chose Islam, and it is this linkage
which goes beyond pure political com
mentary or humor. It is religious in
tolerance and bigotry!
I have to wonder whether a political
cartoon depicting Jackson's run for the
presidency in an overtly racist manner,
or a cartoon showing Israeli troops
demolishing Arab villages as a "Jewish
Bomb" would find a place in The Dai
ly-
I hope not. However, I also hope
that if fears of censorship or abridging
freedom of speech ensured the publica
tion of these cartoons, The Daily

would choose to disassociate itself from
their underlying racist tones. Other
wise, it would leave a stamp of en
dorsement of racism and intolerance.
Perhaps the ability to disassociate
oneself from racist actions or remarks
presupposes an ability to realize that
they are racist to begin with. Perhaps
to The Daily the cartoon was only an
example of biting yet precise political
commentary.
Said believes that "in education,
politics, history and culture there is a
role to be played by secular opposition
intellectuals ... who compassionately
press the interests of the unheard, the
unconnected people of our world .. .
with a tone of personal restraint, his
torical skepticism and informed intel
lect.
"And it must remain the purpose of
such oppositional critics to cross the
lines that partition existence into so
many small fiefdoms, ruled and sus
tained by provincial exclusions, by ig
norance and by fear."
