# Minority groups are hypocritical
## 
### 
Minority groups on campus
tend to stifle debate and are
self-righteous. I say this not as
a reaction to any specific instance, but
rather to attempt to point out some
real needs in the minority and main
stream communities for more tolerance
and true openness to diversity.
The purpose of this letter is to
illuminate the need for better student
student relations. Let me differentiate
between policy goals and interpersonal
methods. I am more concerned with
the overarching way in which dialogue
on this campus takes place than any
specific policy.
Four years ago, when I lived in
Ujamaa, I was told that if I didn't
sleep out in the Quad to support
Stanford Out of South Africa, I was
supporting apartheid. What a leap of
logic! As far as I can tell, there is no
direct correlation between sleeping in
the Quad and apartheid.
Why does the word "racist" flow
with such easy freedom — generally
when the other person merely doesn't
agree with your (morally superior, of
course) opinion? Why, in an institution
with such a reputation as Stanford's,
must the discussion over the Rainbow
Coalition's demands last year dissolve
instantly into vitriolic rhetoric on both
sides?
And finally, why must I defend
myself from other minorities who tell
me that because I fit into the main
stream I am not a minority, and that
my experience is obviously invalid?

It is with these concerns, after four
years, that I write. Room for dissent
ing opinion must be allowed, without it
being regarded as anathema. If some
one has a suggestion for the improve
ment of a certain aspect of the Univer
sity, he must not be dismissed as
narrow-minded.
Is not the ultimate goal of all this
agitation to promote an atmosphere
where we can all get along? If the goal
is eradicating racism and being open to
differences, then the minority groups
prevent the very formation of true
diversity that they claim to promote.
Let me explain. I am a Korean-
American, by definition a minority. Yet
because I function well in mainstream
society, my experience as a minority is
devalued or considered not as
legitimate as one who feels intense
racism.
I am told that because I had advan
tages others did not have because I
was fortunate to have a better home
life, so I did not truly grow up as a
"minority." Thus we end up with a
situation where the only minorities
whose opinions count are those who
directly feel racism.
I have also been told more than once
that because I do not have the same
opinions that the more radical mem
bers of AASA have, I am rejecting my
ethnicity, cultural heritage, yak yak
yak.
As far as I knew, minority groups
were fighting in an attempt to allow
diversity. Thus, it seems fair to allow

me my opinion about my background.
As a matter of fact, I have done a
tremendous amount of learning about
my ethnicity, albeit from a
political/economic, a more (gasp!) aca
demic viewpoint.
The inevitable charge of self
segregation must occur here. But what
I wish to point out is that I have no
problem with the AASA — I just wish
the group would validate my opinions
and allow me the opportunity to have
my own agenda without calling me a
"twinkie" ("oreo," etc.) or anything
else.
The general reaction from people
with my opinions tends to be disaffec
tion — not wishing the struggle to be
accepted, one chooses not to fight.
Thus many minorities on this campus
who do not agree with some of the
rhetoric on campus keep their mouths
shut, for fear of stirring up a hornet's
nest.
The whole point of this letter is to
point out that there are valid alterna
tives for minorities to have, and that if
one does not necessarily have the same
agenda as AASA or the BSU, he/she
should not be subjected to exclusion or
need to go elsewhere.
The goal is diversity. The goal is
openness to differences. Well, why
don't the minority groups begin with
themselves?
