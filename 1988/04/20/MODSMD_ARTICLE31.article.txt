## Orchestra ventures to orient on summer tour 
### Maryellen Driscoll 
Making music is not the only task
for members of the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra — they also want to make a
name for themselves.
In a three-week performance tour
that will take them through Japan, Sin
gapore and South Korea this June and
July, orchestra members hope to strike
a chord with aspiring student musicians
from both the United States and other
countries.
"We're going on tour to build an or
chestra," explained Tour Manager Jock
Friedly, a junior. For Friedly, a French
horn player, his commitment to the first
student tour in the history of the or
chestra has meant stopping out for the
quarter.
"No (registered) student could ever
do this job," Friedly said, explaining
that he and other orchestra members
are responsible for raising the $160,000
needed for the tour.
The first leg in the trip will be a stop
in Japan where the 99 musicians will
perform at Kyoto University.
They will then visit Singapore and
play in the Singapore International Fes
tival at the country's month-long cere
mony.
The final stop will be South Korea.
The orchestra will play at Seoul's Yonsei
University for the school's centennial
celebration.
The musicians have already raised
more than $18,000 for the tour by of
fering to perform at a variety of en
gagements outside of the University.
Student ensembles have played at wed
dings, parties and dinners in exchange
for donations.
The orchestra will play for royalty as
well. Last month a quartet performed
for the King and Prince of Malaysia.
Known as the"the music man" by
fellow musicians, violinist Mike Jones
has raised more money for the trip than
any other symphony member, perform
ing more than 14 times in the last five
months.
In addition to the students' efforts,

Japanese companies including Yamaha
and Hewlett-Packard of Singapore have
donated $22,000 for the tour group. In
exchange for the donations, the or
chestra plans to play at company func
tions.
The Stanford Centennial Committee
has also allocated $27,000 to the trip,
hoping to promote "Stanford's image
in the Fine Arts and Humanites,"
Friedly said. The donation was espe
cially noteworthy because the Centen
nial Committee awarded the musicians
with an amount 10 times greater than
any other received by a student group,
according to Friedly.
Violinist Chuck Seiber, a junior, is
one of few orchestra members who has
toured before — performing in Vienna
at the International Youth and Music
Festival in 1983. He said that orchestra
members have been extremely busy pre
paring for the tour but are "not
stressed." The winner of this year's
Stanford student soloist competition,
Seiber will give solo perfomances on the
tour.
Seiber transfered to Stanford two
years ago from a New York musical
school where, he said, practicing became
"tedious." He praised Stanford for of
fering "a really ... good balance" be
tween academics and music.

Throughout this week Seiber and
other orchestra members will be hosting
special events for prospective freshmen,
hoping to coax pro-fros into coming to
Stanford and joining the orchestra.
A major fund-raiser for the trip,
scheduled for June 20, is a jazz concert
with Stan Getz, a famous sax player.
The concert is an official commence
ment activity that should attract jazz
fans from throughout the Bay Area.
Dorm contributions have also helped
out the musicians, raising over $1,200
for the tour. In exchange for the dona
tions, the orchestra has provided the
dorms with half-price tickets for their
performances.
Interaction with the dorms has
sparked student interest in the or
chestra and contributed to rising stu
dent turnouts at concerts. According to
Friedly, "Two hundred people were
turned down at the door" at the or
chestra's most recent concert. "That's
never happened before," he boasted.
Although fund raising, recruiting and
performing has kept the musicians es
pecially busy this quarter, trombone
player Chris Jones said that symphony
members are still most tuned into "get
ting this orchestra to be the best it can
be."
