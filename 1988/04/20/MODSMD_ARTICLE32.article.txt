Mia's Weekend Escape:
Ah . . . the great outdoors. Just got back
from a fun (and freezing!) weekend of camping
in Yosemite. No, I didn't scale Half Dome,
but my friends and I did a fair share of hiking.
For a fantastic way to put Stanford (and
midterms) in perspective, Yosemite is an ac
cessible and inexpensive getaway. Rent equip
ment from SOAR, grab some friends and lots
of warm clothing and explore!
An Art Lover's Delight:
Bored with your books? Don't miss the
chance to see the Henri Matisse print exhibit
at the Stanford Museum. The prints are lo
cated along the upper balcony and the exhibit
features his lively Jazz collection color prints
accompanied by handwritten French narrative.
I highly recommend a visit to the museum
before the end of the quarter, when the exhibit
ends.
What a lineup!
If you happened to be at Tresidder Monday
at noon, you couldn't help but notice the rather
long line extending from the Ticket Office to
the back patio. Well, the Grateful Dead are
coming to Frost (April 30 and May 1) and
Stanford students were out in great numbers
to buy ticfcets. I guess that sudden proliferation
of tie-dyed shirts is just around the corner . . .
I've got your number:
Every time I'm near the windows of the
Old Union Clubhouse, I keep hearing those
screams of delight or groans of despair that
remind me The Draw is once again upon us.
As you gather your good luck charms in hand,
allow me to make a brief plug for Serra. (Yes,
I do live there and yes, for the second time!)
Good parties, lots of fun people, and an
unbeatable location makes Serra a logical
choice for the socially inclined. Besides, the
highest draw number will earn you a free
breakfast at Hobee's.
