## 'Naked' truth: Heads' best in years 
### Frank Lester 
Talking Heads — "Naked"
The Talking Heads' eighth studio
excursion finds the group romping
over familiar territory — or so some
would say, longing for the old days
when each new Heads album was a
bona fide rock music event. Some are
convinced that the new album is a
rehash of themes and musical styles
found in much better form on 1980's
"Remain in Light" (still the group's
best album to date).
The album, granted, is replete with
African and Caribbean polyrhythms,
and it has the same kind of ethnic
flavor that leaves fans of the '70s al
bums cold. The message isn't exactly
thrillingly new, either — it's more of
the patented neurosis that made David
Byrne a media darling these past two
years and left his three partners, in
interviews, tossing out the occasional
envious "we might break up" trump
card (the only one they really have up
their sleeves, judging by the pedestrian
quality of the Tom Tom club and Jerry
Harrison outings).
Some especiallly nasty reviewers are
even saying that David Byrne is just
hopping on the bandwagon of musical
imperialism that Paul Simon started
with his "Graceland" album, bringing
in talented African musicians to ride
the crest of a trend. That charge, if
you've paid any attention at all to
"Remain in Light," is baseless.
These caveats aside, though, it's
good (after years of albums that al
legedly "broke new ground" but did
little in the way of advancing the
Head's reputation as an artistic force)
to see the Heads back in true form.
"Naked" is easily the best album the
Heads have released in seven years.
That's saying a lot. Some would
bristle and say "Little Creatures"
deserves more credit than that. But
even overlooking the fact that it
rapidly became the most overplayed
album on campus upon its release
three years ago, the album just didn't
have much tension in its grooves. It
is a fun record, and it says something
about the group's artistry when you
can say that after having played the
record 500 times. But compared to the

new release, "Little Creatures" begins
to look not ingenious but ingenuous.
The new album takes a good dea
of getting used to, which, in these days
of anesthetized neo-disco pap, is more
of a blessing than it seems. "(Nothing
but) Flowers," the first single, sounds
lousy on the radio. But once you've
bought the record and listened to the
single in the rich context of the sur
rounding songs, you begin to appreci
ate the single's feel.
David Byrne is back in a brooding
mood, which means he's back to writ
ing songs that have almost the
nightmarish texture of the "Fear of
Music" period. The album is heavy on
meditations about the contradictions
of the modern world — it's technolog
ical drive, paired with an equally pas
sionate drive to return to nature.
Byrne doesn't just leap on the
merry-go-round, though — he stands
back and gazes at it with his eerie
eye, and finds something amiss both
in progress ("Blind" is a horn-filled
number that speaks to the way we
turn our heads when a murder is
taking place before our eyes) and
atavism ("Facts of Life" finds him in
his "isn't pubic hair repulsive?" mode,
which, now that the orgasmic groan
is an obligatory part of every top-10
urban-format dance mix, is something
of a refreshment).
Most of all, Byrne is trying to dis
abuse the listener of a subconscious
yearning for Utopia. "Flowers" is
about how a meadow-infested Paradise
that has supplanted all the Dairy
Queens and 7-Elevens. When Byrne
groans, "I wish I had a lawnmower,"
you can just picture him sitting for
lornly in the weeds, scratching his
neck and thirsting for a Coke.
The lyrics and the music actuallly
do justice to one another on this al
bum, which is something you couldn't
consistently say about the Heads' last
effort, "True Stories." When the
Heads start bringing in African
musicians like Abdou M'Boup and
Yves N'Djock, not to mention Johnny
Marr (formerly of The Smiths), you
know the music is going to start get
ting intense — Tina Weymouth's bass
will sound witchier, Jerry Harrison
will be more than ornamentation,

Chris Frantz will stop sounding like
Ringo Starr. Unfortunately (to some),
that means a proportional decline in
the decipherability of Byrne's lyrics,
but a thoughtfully provided lyric sheet
remedies that glitch in a jiffy.
As has been said, this album will
take a couple of listens before it hooks
you. The thought of David Byrne doing
salsa and mambo tunes may make
some cringe, whereas, given the wicked
spins he puts on those sounds, it may
make others leap to their feet and
dance till they drop. As has also been
said, this album has engendered un
favorable comparisons to "Remain in

Light," which also used jangly polyr
hythms to make its point.
The Heads may not be breaking new
ground anymore — one of those ear
nest dorm dinner-table debates that
occur in the fantasies of every Stanford
student could possibly settle that
point. But they are consolidating their
sound, which is something they never
had time to do before. Seeing as how
Byrne is now referring apprehensively
in interviews to a younger cadre of
"frantic-hormoned" rockers he sees
coming down from the pike, it may
be beside the point to expect the Heads
to keep breaking new ground, anyway.

Queens and 7-Elevens. When Byrne
groans, "I wish I had a lawnmower,"
you can just picture him sitting for
lornly in the weeds, scratching his
neck and thirsting for a Coke.
The lyrics and the music actuallly
do justice to one another on this al
bum, which is something you couldn't
consistently say about the Heads' last
effort, "True Stories." When the
Heads start bringing in African
musicians like Abdou M'Boup and
Yves N'Djock, not to mention Johnny
Marr (formerly of The Smiths), you
know the music is going to start get
ting intense — Tina Weymouth's bass
will sound witchier, Jerry Harrison
will be more than ornamentation,

Chris Frantz will stop sounding like
Ringo Starr. Unfortunately (to some),
that means a proportional decline in
the decipherability of Byrne's lyrics,
but a thoughtfully provided lyric sheet
remedies that glitch in a jiffy.
As has been said, this album will
take a couple of listens before it hooks
you. The thought of David Byrne doing
salsa and mambo tunes may make
some cringe, whereas, given the wicked
spins he puts on those sounds, it may
make others leap to their feet and
dance till they drop. As has also been
said, this album has engendered un
favorable comparisons to "Remain in

Light," which also used jangly polyr
hythms to make its point.
The Heads may not be breaking new
ground anymore — one of those ear
nest dorm dinner-table debates that
occur in the fantasies of every Stanford
student could possibly settle that
point. But they are consolidating their
sound, which is something they never
had time to do before. Seeing as how
Byrne is now referring apprehensively
in interviews to a younger cadre of
"frantic-hormoned" rockers he sees
coming down from the pike, it may
be beside the point to expect the Heads
to keep breaking new ground, anyway.

Talking Heads — "Naked"
The Talking Heads' eighth studio
excursion finds the group romping
over familiar territory — or so some
would say, longing for the old days
when each new Heads album was a
bona fide rock music event. Some are
convinced that the new album is a
rehash of themes and musical styles
found in much better form on 1980's
"Remain in Light" (still the group's
best album to date).
The album, granted, is replete with
African and Caribbean polyrhythms,
and it has the same kind of ethnic
flavor that leaves fans of the '70s al
bums cold. The message isn't exactly
thrillingly new, either — it's more of
the patented neurosis that made David
Byrne a media darling these past two
years and left his three partners, in
interviews, tossing out the occasional
envious "we might break up" trump
card (the only one they really have up
their sleeves, judging by the pedestrian
quality of the Tom Tom club and Jerry
Harrison outings).
Some especiallly nasty reviewers are
even saying that David Byrne is just
hopping on the bandwagon of musical
imperialism that Paul Simon started
with his "Graceland" album, bringing
in talented African musicians to ride
the crest of a trend. That charge, if
you've paid any attention at all to
"Remain in Light," is baseless.
These caveats aside, though, it's
good (after years of albums that al
legedly "broke new ground" but did
little in the way of advancing the
Head's reputation as an artistic force)
to see the Heads back in true form.
"Naked" is easily the best album the
Heads have released in seven years.
That's saying a lot. Some would
bristle and say "Little Creatures"
deserves more credit than that. But
even overlooking the fact that it
rapidly became the most overplayed
album on campus upon its release
three years ago, the album just didn't
have much tension in its grooves. It
is a fun record, and it says something
about the group's artistry when you
can say that after having played the
record 500 times. But compared to the

new release, "Little Creatures" begins
to look not ingenious but ingenuous.
The new album takes a good dea
of getting used to, which, in these days
of anesthetized neo-disco pap, is more
of a blessing than it seems. "(Nothing
but) Flowers," the first single, sounds
lousy on the radio. But once you've
bought the record and listened to the
single in the rich context of the sur
rounding songs, you begin to appreci
ate the single's feel.
David Byrne is back in a brooding
mood, which means he's back to writ
ing songs that have almost the
nightmarish texture of the "Fear of
Music" period. The album is heavy on
meditations about the contradictions
of the modern world — it's technolog
ical drive, paired with an equally pas
sionate drive to return to nature.
Byrne doesn't just leap on the
merry-go-round, though — he stands
back and gazes at it with his eerie
eye, and finds something amiss both
in progress ("Blind" is a horn-filled
number that speaks to the way we
turn our heads when a murder is
taking place before our eyes) and
atavism ("Facts of Life" finds him in
his "isn't pubic hair repulsive?" mode,
which, now that the orgasmic groan
is an obligatory part of every top-10
urban-format dance mix, is something
of a refreshment).
Most of all, Byrne is trying to dis
abuse the listener of a subconscious
yearning for Utopia. "Flowers" is
about how a meadow-infested Paradise
that has supplanted all the Dairy
Queens and 7-Elevens. When Byrne
groans, "I wish I had a lawnmower,"
you can just picture him sitting for
lornly in the weeds, scratching his
neck and thirsting for a Coke.
