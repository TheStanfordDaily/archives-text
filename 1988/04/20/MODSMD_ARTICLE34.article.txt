## Ram's Head presents entertaining 'Jesus Christ' 
### Frank Lester 
Whether or not you have a chip
on your shoulder about Andrew
Lloyd Webber musicals, go see the
Ram's Head production of 1971's
"Jesus Christ Superstar," which
is ending a two-week run in
Memorial Auditorium Friday and
Saturday.
Webber, who after the block
buster success of this first "opera"
went on to even higher echelons
of glitz glory with "Cats," "Star
light Express" and "Phantom of
the Opera," can be hopeless in
the wrong hands. Many people
refuse outright to pay good money
to see his material because they
have heard tales of the excesses
to which certain directors will
subject audiences to get the Web
ber message across.
But under the insistent hands
of director Allen Blue and pro
ducer Michelle Stewart, this pro
duction steers clear of the temp
tation to sprawl decadently across
its audience's lap. It is, as Blue
makes clear in the program, a
show of the '80s. For the most
part, the transplant is an auspi
cious one.
You can, after all, tone down
Webber only so much. There is
still the topsy-turvy theme that
turns Judas into the resurrected
hero and Jesus into the addle
pated cult celebrity, a theme
which played astonishingly well
the night I was there — and the
audience was not filled merely
with smug atheists.
The opera, possibly because of
its coy whiff of subversion — sub
version being one of the first
tenets of proselytizing — has,
along with the similarly playful
"Godspell," a good deal of cur

rency among campus evangelicals.
There are still Tim Rice's lyrics,
full of easily digestible rants
against mass-media culture (the
apostles sing about dying and
going to the heaven of post-Gospel
best-seller renown) and celebrity
worship (the question in the
show's big number is "Jesus
Christ, Jesus Christ, who are you,
what did you sacrifice?").
And there is still a lot of smoke,
a lot of moaning, a lot of flailing
limbs in varying states of undress,
and most of all, a lot of joyfully
bombastic music, the likes of
which you will encounter nowhere
else, and the likes of which are
enough to put a smile on the face
of even the most vehement
Webber-basher.
There is a lot to praise in the
updating of the show's look. Julia
Cosma's costumes seem a hybrid
of virtually every fashion state
ment this decade. The fabulously
banshee-like choral mob (which
is composed in turn of disciples,
then angry Jews, then micro
phone-thrusting reporters eager
to get the angle on the betrayed
Christ) is attired in bright-colored
sweats, leotards, minis, tank-tops,
bedecking sashes and similar min
imalist throw-ons for an effect
that is lissome (and impressively
skimpy) without being cluttering.
Irene Stapleford's set shuns the
original show's stagey excesses
(Christ does not, in this show,
emerge from any 15-foot-high
cocoon, for instance). Keith
Cross's lighting and David San
derman's sound are not only ef
fective but bold.
Critics get anxious, it is said,
when there is too little in a piece
of art to discredit. So here I am

casting about for bad things to
say about the show and finding
all too few. Most of the flaws were
unavoidable, either because of in
herent snags in the opera itself,
or because of inexorable acts of
nature.
I am speaking in the first case
of the confusion any first-timer
in the audience must have felt as
Josh Rowland struggled valiantly
to bring something more than
petu lance to the role of Christ.
The Messiah, in Webber and
Rice's vision, is supposed to be
weary, confused, and indecisive.
But if Webber v/ere ever to bring
a rendition of the Hamlet tale to
the musical stage ("Whatta Hap
less Ham"?), what would he have
the lead do? Shamble around like
an old schmuck and scratch his
head in tune with the piccolos?
I am speaking in the second
case of the time it took for the
show (at least vocally) to take off.
The singing of Rowland, Lisa Lar
ragoite as Mary Magdalen, and
Van Laborde as Judas — at least
through the first half of Act One
— brought unfavorable attention
to the greenness of their vocal
chords. By the time Martin
Puryear's Pilate finished his first
number, though, his honeyed
tones seemed to have had some
sort of theophanic effect on his
fellow players, all of whom with
out exception stopped croaking
and screeching, and sang wonder
fully the rest of the time. (Lar
ragoite's voice, in particular,
proved stunning.)
If Blue wanted to avoid the
garishness of Tom O'Horgan's
original production, he did so with
a vengeance. I imagine that
O'Horgan's demands of his cast
(such as that they get together in

"group encounter" sessions and
blindfold themselves and lick
avocado honey off the body of the
man, stripped to his underwear,
playing Christ) went decorously
unregarded in the Ram's Head
rehearsals.
Nor, on the other end of the
spectrum, did Judas even perform
the act of betrayal, though he
came as close as the directorial
strictures (or, more likely, the
self-imposed ones) seem to allow.
Fortunately, such asceticism

does nothing to get in the way of
the production; it enhances its ef
fect. Ram's Head offers the opera
not so much as a flower-child orgy
as an elegy to that period's spirit.
It is, in that sense, unrepentantly
nostalgic. The contrast between
the unreconstructed music and
lyrics and the revamped appear
ance is startling, and also, in its
way, quite moving.
The question gets turned
around: Who are we? What have
we sacrificed? Among the kitsch

and the camp, the Herodian aban
don and the clamorous orchestra
tion, the production aims a silent
barb at the passionless, vacillating
yuppie — a role we all forswear
but actually act out more often
than we would wish.

"Jesus Christ Superstar" will be
performed Friday and Saturday,
April 22 and 23, at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium. Tickets are
available at the Tresidder Ticket
Office.


James Rucker — Daily
Christ (Josh Rowland) screams at people who have sold merchandise and gambled In God's temple
to leave and not disgrace It anymore in Ram's Head's entertaining production of "Jesus Christ
Superstar."
