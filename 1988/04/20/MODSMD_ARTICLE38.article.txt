## Unorthodox Green just wins 
### Cameron Macky Staff writer 
There's something different
about Lisa Green. Watch the
Stanford sophomore play tennis
sometime and you might notice
it: There are no rainbows coming
from Green's end of the court.
As a matter of fact, in this ten
nis age of topspin, Green is one
of the few players who just goes
out and hits the ball. No spins,
no fancy stuff, just a lot of
straight, down-your-throat shots.
Of course, this causes problems
at times. Whereas topspin practi
tioners can afford to hit the ball
several feet above the net and still
expect it to land in the court,
players like Green have to hit the
ball low to keep it in. With the
target area reduced, the odds of
something going wrong go up.
However, when mastered, the
unorthodox style can be one hell
of a weapon against players not
used to seeing it.
"Lisa's got a different style of
play, which throws people off,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Caryn
Copeland said. "She doesn't use
a lot of topspin. It's hard to get
into any kind of rhythm against
Lisa.
"Actually, she's scary to watch,
for me," Copeland laughs. "She
makes me nervous."
So why doesn't anyone try to
get Green to change her ways?
Let's just say the move would be
slightly akin to taking the engine
from a Rolls Royce and putting
it into a Ferrari. What's best for

one doesn't exactly work for the
other.
"That's just the way I've always
played," Green says. "People want
me to hit it with more topspin
... (but) that's just the way I
play. You can't really change that,
and I don't want to."
Actually, Green could probably
kick the ball over the net and her
coaches wouldn't mind, as long
as she keeps piling up the wins
she's been accumulating in her
first two seasons on the Farm.
Playing at the No. 2 singles spot
this season for the second-ranked
Cardinal, Green has compiled a
29-9 overall record (18-5 in dual
matches), is ranked 12th in the
latest ITCA-Volvo national tennis
rankings, and last weekend helped
Stanford capture its first-ever
Pacific 10 Conference champion
ship.
Not bad, but not at all surpris
ing, considering her fantastic per
formance at the end of her fresh
man year. Green, who had started
at No. 3 singles for the team all
season, put together a string of
impressive victories at the NCAA
Championships and advanced all
the way to the semifinals of the
singles competition before bowing
out.
"We knew she was capable
going in," Copeland said, "but to
play that consistently well over a
stretch of several days — that's
pretty amazing."
Green is modest about her per
formance. "I played well, but I
didn't play unreal," she says."I
just played consistently."

'I'd like to do well in
the NCAA individuals,
but I just want to get
better every year.

All things considered, "consis
tently" is apparently a great way
to play. For her efforts through
out the season, Green was named
Outstanding Female Athlete of
her freshman class. Pretty im
pressive for someone who at one
point was undecided about
whether she wanted to devote her
time to tennis.
"There were three months in a
row . .. (my) senior year in high
school when I lost to a lot of good
players I hadn't lost to before,"
said Green, who was the top
ranked junior in Northern Cali
fornia before coming to Stanford.
"I wasn't really sure if I wanted
to work in tennis or what I wanted
to do."
Green's parents, who had en
couraged her to begin playing the
game at age 10, left the decision
up to her. "My parents said, 'If
you want to quit tennis, go ahead
and quit,' " Green said. 'But if
you're going to play, play all out.'
"I decided that I wanted to play
tennis, and to still improve, and
so the path straightened out."
"Improve" is one word that is
repeated many times over when
Green talks. Improving her game
is the most important goal she
has set for herself. Unfortunately,

she says her temperament some
times gets in the way. "Sometimes
I get too mad when I'm playing,
and then I lose control," Green
said. "I'm getting better at staying
calm, but sometimes I get too ...
I just start yelling and I lose my
concentration. It's getting better,
though."
"Lisa's learned a lot," Copeland
said. "She's aJways been willing
to learn; she's very receptive of
advice."
Much of that advice has come
on the subject of Green's serve,
which Copeland says "comes and
goes." Green agrees, calling it the
weakest aspect of her game.
After her primary goal of im
proving comes the goal of winning
several more team champion
ships. Even with all her individual
accomplishments while on the
junior circuit and at Stanford,
Green says taking the 1987 team
title was the highlight of her
career. "In tennis you rarely get
to play on a team, so that was
great," she said.
She may also have a shot at
the NCAA individual title one
year, although she doesn't worry
about it as much. "I think this
year there are so many good
players, and there's not really any
one player that I would say is
going to win it," Green said. "I
think on a given day I could beat
almost anyone; it just depends on
how everyone's playing.
"I'd like to do well in the NCAA
individuals, but I just want to get
better every year. That's more im
portant."

Copeland said. "She doesn't use
a lot of topspin. It's hard to get
into any kind of rhythm against
Lisa.
"Actually, she's scary to watch,
for me," Copeland laughs. "She
makes me nervous."
So why doesn't anyone try to
get Green to change her ways?
Let's just say the move would be
slightly akin to taking the engine
from a Rolls Royce and putting
it into a Ferrari. What's best for

one doesn't exactly work for the
other.
"That's just the way I've always
played," Green says. "People want
me to hit it with more topspin
... (but) that's just the way I
play. You can't really change that,
and I don't want to."
Actually, Green could probably
kick the ball over the net and her
coaches wouldn't mind, as long
as she keeps piling up the wins
she's been accumulating in her
first two seasons on the Farm.
Playing at the No. 2 singles spot
this season for the second-ranked
Cardinal, Green has compiled a
29-9 overall record (18-5 in dual
matches), is ranked 12th in the
latest ITCA-Volvo national tennis
rankings, and last weekend helped
Stanford capture its first-ever
Pacific 10 Conference champion
ship.
Not bad, but not at all surpris
ing, considering her fantastic per
formance at the end of her fresh
man year. Green, who had started
at No. 3 singles for the team all
season, put together a string of
impressive victories at the NCAA
Championships and advanced all
the way to the semifinals of the
singles competition before bowing
out.
"We knew she was capable
going in," Copeland said, "but to
play that consistently well over a
stretch of several days — that's
pretty amazing."
Green is modest about her per
formance. "I played well, but I
didn't play unreal," she says."I
just played consistently."

'I'd like to do well in
the NCAA individuals,
but I just want to get
better every year.

All things considered, "consis
tently" is apparently a great way
to play. For her efforts through
out the season, Green was named
Outstanding Female Athlete of
her freshman class. Pretty im
pressive for someone who at one
point was undecided about
whether she wanted to devote her
time to tennis.
"There were three months in a
row . .. (my) senior year in high
school when I lost to a lot of good
players I hadn't lost to before,"
said Green, who was the top
ranked junior in Northern Cali
fornia before coming to Stanford.
"I wasn't really sure if I wanted
to work in tennis or what I wanted
to do."
Green's parents, who had en
couraged her to begin playing the
game at age 10, left the decision
up to her. "My parents said, 'If
you want to quit tennis, go ahead
and quit,' " Green said. 'But if
you're going to play, play all out.'
"I decided that I wanted to play
tennis, and to still improve, and
so the path straightened out."
"Improve" is one word that is
repeated many times over when
Green talks. Improving her game
is the most important goal she
has set for herself. Unfortunately,

she says her temperament some
times gets in the way. "Sometimes
I get too mad when I'm playing,
and then I lose control," Green
said. "I'm getting better at staying
calm, but sometimes I get too ...
I just start yelling and I lose my
concentration. It's getting better,
though."
"Lisa's learned a lot," Copeland
said. "She's aJways been willing
to learn; she's very receptive of
advice."
Much of that advice has come
on the subject of Green's serve,
which Copeland says "comes and
goes." Green agrees, calling it the
weakest aspect of her game.
After her primary goal of im
proving comes the goal of winning
several more team champion
ships. Even with all her individual
accomplishments while on the
junior circuit and at Stanford,
Green says taking the 1987 team
title was the highlight of her
career. "In tennis you rarely get
to play on a team, so that was
great," she said.
She may also have a shot at
the NCAA individual title one
year, although she doesn't worry
about it as much. "I think this
year there are so many good
players, and there's not really any
one player that I would say is
going to win it," Green said. "I
think on a given day I could beat
almost anyone; it just depends on
how everyone's playing.
"I'd like to do well in the NCAA
individuals, but I just want to get
better every year. That's more im
portant."

Sophomore Lisa Green has rapidly risen to the top of the collegiate
tennis scene. An NCAA singles semifinalist last year, Green is 29-9
this season.
There's something different
about Lisa Green. Watch the
Stanford sophomore play tennis
sometime and you might notice
it: There are no rainbows coming
from Green's end of the court.
As a matter of fact, in this ten
nis age of topspin, Green is one
of the few players who just goes
out and hits the ball. No spins,
no fancy stuff, just a lot of
straight, down-your-throat shots.
Of course, this causes problems
at times. Whereas topspin practi
tioners can afford to hit the ball
several feet above the net and still
expect it to land in the court,
players like Green have to hit the
ball low to keep it in. With the
target area reduced, the odds of
something going wrong go up.
However, when mastered, the
unorthodox style can be one hell
of a weapon against players not
used to seeing it.
"Lisa's got a different style of
play, which throws people off,"
Stanford Asst. Coach Caryn
Copeland said. "She doesn't use
a lot of topspin. It's hard to get
