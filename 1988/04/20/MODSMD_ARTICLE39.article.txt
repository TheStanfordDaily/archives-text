# The 						woes of the O's just continue to grow
## 
### 
Baseball, for whatever reason, is a
game that lends itself to streaks of
various kinds to a greater extent than
other sports.

The finest example is, of course, Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. There
is nothing comparable to the Yankee Clip
per's feat — except in college baseball,

where Oklahoma State third baseman
Robin Ventura last year surpassed
DiMaggio's "unbreakable" record with a
58-game tear of his own (which, inciden
tally, was stopped by Stanford ace Jack
McDowell during the College World Se
ries).
Once again this season, streaks are
proliferating in the professional and col
lege ranks.
First of all, there are the hapless Bal
timore Orioles, losers of their first 13
straight games, which ties a league
record for losses at the start of a season.
This is not an auspicious way to begin
the year. In fact, it cost Baltimore
manager Cal Ripkin Sr. his job after just
six losses, which doesn't seem so bad
looking back now.
Successor Frank Robinson has pro

ceeded to lose seven games in a row, but
I guess the Orioles are giving him a bit
longer to prove himself.
All of this manager-switching really in
dicates two things. One, Baltimore just
doesn't have a very good ballclub, and
two, the team administration is lousy. If
the Orioles were so ready to get rid of
Ripkin, they should have made the move
in the off-season, so the new manager
and the team could get accustomed to
each other before the start of the season.
As it was, Robinson (who was already
with the organization) was thrown into
a tough, tense situation, with a lot of
pressure on him to win games right away.
Predicatably, things just got worse.
The abrupt way that the club handled
the move after just six games was also
an insult to Ripkin, who has been with

the organization for over 30 years.
Granted, he was no great manager, but
the Orioles should have had the class —
and the sense — to fire Cal Sr. either
before the season or after a reasonable
number of games.
The sense part comes in because Rip
kin's two sons, Cal Jr. and Billy, make
up the Baltimore middle infield. Dad's
sudden firing certainly hasn't helped Cal
Jr., the Oriole shortstop. Before his
homer in last night's loss to the Brewers,
he had gone 0-for-29 since his father got
the ax.
The only good that has come out of
all this has gone Cleveland's way. The
Indians have been on the other side of
seven Baltimore losses and are leading
the division with an 11-3 record.
Meanwhile, the Arizona State baseball

team has put together the opposite kind
of streak. The Sun Devils could have
identified with Baltimore at the begin
ning of the Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division schedule, getting off to a
1-7 league start, but since then ASU has
won 23 straight and leads the Six-Pac
by a game over Stanford.
Clearly, this must be stopped, and it
looks like the Cardinal will have to be
the team to do it. The Devils roll into
town on Friday, and this weekend's series
at Sunken Diamond could well determine
the Six-Pac champion.
ASU made the Cardinal streak victims
by sweeping the series at Tempe earlier
in the season, and the least we could do
is return the favor. After all, Stanford
is the streak-breaking team. Just ask
Robin Ventura.
