# Re-vote avoided; BSU gets 2nd chance
## ASSU forgets overseas voting, is nearly forced to hold new election 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
It ain't over 'til it's over — especially
when it comes to ASSU elections.
The ASSU Senate last night was
nearly forced to hold an entirely new
election because no absentee ballots
were sent to any of Stanford's 225 over
seas students.
The only results that may change are
the senate elections and two groups'
fee assessments that will gain a second
chance of approval.
The Black Student Union, which un
expectedly lost its fee request by only
eight votes, will be "one group which
will definitely be affected" by the over
seas ballots, BSU Chair Bill King said.
X-TV may also be affected, since it lost
its fee request by only 142 votes
Elections officials usually send ballots

overseas to be completed in the same
manner as on-campus ballots. However,
the new process of using voting mac
hines this year caused confusion, and
no contact was made between elections
officials and overseas campuses.
Instead of rejecting last week's results
— an action which would have forced
a repeat election, according to ASSU
by-laws — the senate decided to validate
election results pending receipt of all
overseas ballots. Those ballots will be
sent by express mail to those campuses,
and then returned and counted in the
next two weeks. Final election results
will be certified at the next senate
meeting May 2.
In other business, the senate finally
decided who would become the director
of Public Affairs.
Rachel Wiesen, a black junior, was
nominated and approved for the posi

tion after she was interviewed by the
full senate. Terzian, a white sophomore,
will be offered the other available po
sition in the office, that of the adver
tising manager.
The selection process for the Office
of Public Affairs came under fire two
weeks ago when the BSU charged that
"institutional racism" may have entered
the process. After a second interview
process and a second senate rejection
of committee recommendations, the
Senate Chair's Task Force on ASSU
Staff Hiring ordered that filling the po
sitions should be determined by the full
senate.
Senate Chair David Smolen said "no
questions" were brought up about last
night's interviewing process. Because 13
voting senate members and other ASSU
officials were present, Smolen
said the fairness of the process
was ensured. The final vote break
down was not announced because
the interviews occurred during
closed session, but Smolen said
there was "no unanimous deci
sion."
Wiesen concurred that last
night's selection process was more
fair than previous interviews. Be
cause the interviews were con
ducted by a "totally different
group of people," Wiesen said
"resumes and interviews" were
the focus instead of relying on
"previous biases."
Terzian was not available for
comment last night.
The confusion over overseas
balloting arose because of what
senator Peter Thiel called "an am
biguity in the bylaws." Elections
Commissioner Steve Baer ex
plained his interpretation was
that elections officials were al
lowed the "flexibility to determine
polling sites." In order to avoid
the "hassle and extra expense" of
overseas polling places, officials
only established sites on campus.
Baer said he understood absen
tee balloting to be "the responsi
bility of overseas campuses," not
elections officials. Since "no re
quests were made" by those cam
puses, Baer said no ballots were
delivered to them for voting.
Because the ASSU bylaws re
quire opportunities for overseas
balloting, and because the bylaws
also state that election results

must be validated in the first sen
ate meeting following the election,
the senate was almost caught in
a bind that would have forced a
second election.
Before election results become
official, the senate must take two
separate actions — validate and
confirm the results. Validation
must occur at the first meeting
after the elections, but confirma
tion may occur anytime after
validation.
In order to avoid a second elec
tion, graduate senator Don
Gagliardi proposed an amend
ment to the validation bill. The
amendment makes the validation
"effective 72 hours after the last
overseas ballot is counted."
Gagliardi said such an amend
ment was "the only way to get
around the bylaws without hold
ing a new election."
In other business, the senate
set a limit on how much groups
can spend campaigning for special
fee requests. Although the
original bill proposed a cap of
$100, an amendment raised the
limit to $250 after moderate
debate. The $250 limit was deter
mined because the same limit is
used for Council of Presidents
slates.
The senate unanimously passed
a bill to allocate up to $1,000 of
Publications Board reserves for
use in ASSU projects.
The Publications Board's
spring quarter allocations were
also unanimously approved.
Campus periodicals receiving
funds are Aurora, El Aguila,
Glosses, the Organ, Reasonable
Doubt, the Stanford Review and
Women's Issues '88. A total of
$3,322 was allocated.
