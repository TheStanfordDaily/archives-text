# Re-vote avoided; BSU gets 2nd chance
## ASSU forgets overseas voting, is nearly forced to hold new election 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
It ain't over 'til it's over — especially
when it comes to ASSU elections.
The ASSU Senate last night was
nearly forced to hold an entirely new
election because no absentee ballots
were sent to any of Stanford's 225 over
seas students.
The only results that may change are
the senate elections and two groups'
fee assessments that will gain a second
chance of approval.
The Black Student Union, which un
expectedly lost its fee request by only
eight votes, will be "one group which
will definitely be affected" by the over
seas ballots, BSU Chair Bill King said.
X-TV may also be affected, since it lost
its fee request by only 142 votes
Elections officials usually send ballots

overseas to be completed in the same
manner as on-campus ballots. However,
the new process of using voting mac
hines this year caused confusion, and
no contact was made between elections
officials and overseas campuses.
Instead of rejecting last week's results
— an action which would have forced
a repeat election, according to ASSU
by-laws — the senate decided to validate
election results pending receipt of all
overseas ballots. Those ballots will be
sent by express mail to those campuses,
and then returned and counted in the
next two weeks. Final election results
will be certified at the next senate
meeting May 2.
In other business, the senate finally
decided who would become the director
of Public Affairs.
Rachel Wiesen, a black junior, was
nominated and approved for the posi

tion after she was interviewed by the
full senate. Terzian, a white sophomore,
will be offered the other available po
sition in the office, that of the adver
tising manager.
The selection process for the Office
of Public Affairs came under fire two
weeks ago when the BSU charged that
"institutional racism" may have entered
the process. After a second interview
process and a second senate rejection
of committee recommendations, the
Senate Chair's Task Force on ASSU
Staff Hiring ordered that filling the po
sitions should be determined by the full
senate.
Senate Chair David Smolen said "no
questions" were brought up about last
night's interviewing process. Because 13
