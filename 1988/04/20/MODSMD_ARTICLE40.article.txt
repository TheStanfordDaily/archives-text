# Cornelius driving for the pro tour
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
Success in wom
en's golf has been
the standard in the
Cornelius family
since the 19505,
and Stanford
senior Kay Cor-

nelius has been no exception.
She developed most of her golf
skills at a very young age, with
help from her mother, then a pro
fessional, and her father, a teach
ing pro. "I grew up traveling on
the tour with mom," Cornelius
said.
Her mother, Kathy, won the
U.S. Open in 1956.
"I took my schoolwork with me
on the road," she added. "I didn't
really go to school until fourth
grade."
At age 12 she entered her first
national tournament, the U.S.
Public Links Amateur. The next
year, at age 13, she won the World
Junior title in the 13- to 14-year
old flight. Then, at the very young
age of 14, she won the U.S. Junior
Championship against the best
17-and-under players in the coun
try.
Coming out of high school Cor
nelius was the top recruit in the
country along with USC's Kim
Saiki. Originally Cornelius was
tending toward Arizona State or
Arizona. Her recruiting trip to
Stanford was in February, a very
late time for such a highly
regarded recruit. "As soon as I
got here, however, I knew this
was where I wanted to go," she
said. "I knew the players well and
felt very comfortable with them."
Once on the Farm, though, she
fell victim to the pressure that
many top recruits feel. "I think
a lot of that pressure was self
inflicted," she said. "I had trouble
adjusting to traveling and study
ing, and I ended up worrying
about it too much and not getting
anything done."
After some acjjustments, how
ever, Cornelius became more com
fortable with the lifestyle of
collegiate golf and her game im-
E roved. In her junior year she
egan with a bang, finishing sec
ond at the Dick McGuire In vita

tional at the University of New
Mexico. Her improved play con
tinued throughout the year and
earned her a preseason All-
America selection this year.
From there, however, things
went sour. After playing in the
U.S. Public Links Amateur in late
June last summer, Cornelius
realized that she was making no
improvement in her swing. "I was
very down on golf at that time,"
she said. "I knew something was
wrong, but everyone around me
saw me hit every day and couldn't
figure it out. I needed a new per
spective."
She got considerable help from
Phil Rodgers, a well-known teach
ing pro. He made some dramatic
changes to her swing which, she
feels, will enable her to play pro
fessional golf in the future.
The results are self-evident.
Early in the season, while she was
still not fully confident in her
revamped swing, Cornelius
struggled.
With winter quarter over, the
women's team headed off to
Hawaii for the Rainbow Intercol
legiate over spring break. There
Cornelius defeated freshman
teammate Jodi Figley on the first
hole of sudden death for the in
dividual title, her first.
Her renewed confidence spilled
over into last week's Lady Sun
Devil, where she opened with a
blistering 68 and finished tied for
third, one stroke off the winning
score.
"After three good years, her
senior year has been and will con
tinue to be a great one," Stanford
Coach Tim Baldwin said.
Cornelius, the lone senior on a
very young and inexperienced
team, also contributes in other
ways. She is the leader of the
team and serves as a role model
for her teammates.
"I think she's a great team
player," said freshman Michele
Lyford. "She's very supportive of
all of us. Everything about her is
positive."
"I look up to Kay," Figley said.
According to Figley, Cornelius*
desire to become a professional
golfer makes her a role model.
"That's something I want to do,
too," she said.
