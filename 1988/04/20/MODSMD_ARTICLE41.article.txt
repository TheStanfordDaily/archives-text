# Card nine gets a rest
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Stanford lost a game to rain
yesterday, and now prepares for
the Sun Devils.
The Cardinal's regularly
scheduled game against St.
Mary's was canceled due to rain
yesterday, and will not be made

up. The rain-out provides an opportunity to
look back on last weekend's road trip to Los
Angeles, a crucial four-game stretch for Stan
ford.
The Cardinal won three out of four over
the weekend, beating UCLA twice and USC
once. Now 29-14 on the season and 13-8 in
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division play,
Stanford trails first-place Arizona State (14-7
in the Six-Pac) by a game going into a three
game series with the Sun Devils at Sunken
Diamond this weekend. California is in third
place at 11-10, two games behind the Cardinal,
and USC is another game back at 10-11.
Despite its successful weekend, the Cardinal
climbed only one place in both national polls,
moving to ninth in the Baseball America poll
and 13th in the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball poll.
The red-hot Sun Devils have won 23 games
in a row, including series sweeps of conference
opponents Stanford, Arizona, USC and Cali
fornia. They are ranked third nationally in
both polls, behind No. 1 Oklahoma State and
No. 2 Fresno State.
Last weekend's road series in Los Angeles
was encouraging for a number of reasons:
• The Cardinal won three out of four on the
road, after having lost eight of its last nine
Six-Pac road games through Friday.
• Stanford got three outstanding starting
pitching performances.
• After losing games in the late innings twice
against Arizona State in Tempe three weeks
ago, once against Cal in Berkeley two weeks
ago and once against Arizona in Tucson last
week, the Cardinal came from behind to win
three times over the weekend. Twice Stanford
won in extra inningß — beating UCLA 5-2 in
12 innings on Sunday, and USC 5-3 in 10 on
Monday. The Cardinal had lost all three of
its extra-inning games this year before last
weekend. "These two games were just what
we needed," sophomore shortstop Troy Paul
sen said of Saturday and Sunday's games. "We
got a lead and held it."
