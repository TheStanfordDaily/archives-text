# Bay Meadows Excitement Contagious
## Aaannnd They're Offf! 
### 
The anouncer's voicc resounds
over the massive speaker sys
tem at Northern California's
largest horse racing track.
Hay Meadows opened in San
Mateo — less than one year after
California legalized para-mutuel
gambling — on November 3, 1934.
Since then, the track has been host
to the likes of superstar jockey Hill
Shoemaker and triple-crown winner
Citation.
There are several ways to "exper
ience" Hay Meadows. For $3, the most
sturdy race-watchers are admitted
into the milling throngs of the
Grandstand.
The crowded Grandstand area
evokes images of the less-favorable
stereotypes associated with racing.
The area seems full of middle-aged,
half-shaven men clutching racing
forms with the determination of ex
perienced losers.
Oddly enough, the same fee allows

Every half hour the
trumpets sound the call
and the horses are led to
the starting eate.

admission into the Infield Park, one
of the most interesting and enjoyable
areas at Bay Meadows.
I he Infield Park, accessed by a
pedestrian tunnel beneath the course,
includes betting windows and an ex
cellent view of the surrounding track,
but several interesting extras have
also been included.
Not far from the Infield snack bars
arc picnic tables, complete with
closed-circuit coverage of the races.
Also hidden in the Infield Park is a
nine-hole, par-28 golf course with pro
shop and putting green, and a play

ground fur the youngsters who
haven't quite picked up the fever for
the races yet.
The rolling hills and green grass
of the Infield area compose an ex
cellent setting for a picnic and, at
the very least, provide a more favor
able backdrop for a relaxing day at
the races.
If you are more interested in con
centrating on the races than on the
crowd or the scenery, the Club House
is the ideal setting. A $6 admission
fee provides entry into a pleasant,
busy area, neither as chaotic as the
Grandstands nor as peaceful as the
Infield Park.
The Club House is designed for
the avid fan. For those who wish to
watch and bet, and wish to do both
easily and comfortably. There is even
The Hof Brau Dining Room, a spa
cious restaurant with plenty of ex
cellent viewing area for those who
do not want to miss a moment of

the action while enjoying lunch or
an early supper.
Ihe Club House also provides a
higher ratio of betting windows to
spectators, reducing the amount of
time spent waiting in line and in
creasing the spectators' enjoyment
immensely.

If you would like to
watch the people at the
races as much as the horses,
then the Turf Club, at $12
per person, is for you.
The Turf Club, with its
dress code and gourmet fare
in the Coach Room and Ter
race dining areas, seems
miles away fro m the

teeming Grandstands.
I he Terrace area features tiered
tables inside a glass enclosure. The
view of the racecourse is incredible,
as are the four bars and exclusive
wagering area, which prevents pa
trons from having to ever worry
about waiting in line at something
as gauche as a betting window.
Should you chose not to view the
races from the Turf Club, reserved
seats will cost you an additional $2.50
in either the Club House or
Grandstand areas, but there are
plenty of free, unreserved seats in

both areas.
Between the bars, betting windows
and restaraunts is an excellent
racecourse. Stretching over a one
mile oval, the fir bark, loam and sand
course is for both thoroughbred and

quarter-horse racing.
The smaller turf course, 4,652 feet
long, consists of a mix of several
breeds of blue and rye grasses. The
turf course is reserved for only the
most prestigious races.

Approximately every half hour,
the trumpets sound the call,
and the horses are led to the
starting gates.
Minutes later, a bell sounds, the
crowd gasps collectively, and the
horses bound out of the starting gate.

Slowly at first, but then
more confidently, specta
tors cheer on their respec
tive horses. Cries of support
or derision rise above the
din. Suddenly, the cries end
with the race.
It is hard to believe, even
after experiencing several,
that very few of the races

J last longer than 20 seconds.
A day at the races is something
quite unusual, a reminder of bygone
days, and a chance to experience a
tradition-filled way of life that is
years away from the Stanford
campus. All of the elements of track,
spectators and setting work together
to create an incredible assault on the
senses.
It is exciting, interesting, and if
you're lucky, profitable. Give it a try.
Races start at 7:30 p.m. on Fridays
and Saturdays and at 1 p.m. on Sun
days and Mondays.

If you are more interested in con
centrating on the races than on the
crowd or the scenery, the Club House
is the ideal setting. A $6 admission
fee provides entry into a pleasant,
busy area, neither as chaotic as the
Grandstands nor as peaceful as the
Infield Park.
The Club House is designed for
the avid fan. For those who wish to
watch and bet, and wish to do both
easily and comfortably. There is even
The Hof Brau Dining Room, a spa
cious restaurant with plenty of ex
cellent viewing area for those who
do not want to miss a moment of

the action while enjoying lunch or
an early supper.
Ihe Club House also provides a
higher ratio of betting windows to
spectators, reducing the amount of
time spent waiting in line and in
creasing the spectators' enjoyment
immensely.

If you would like to
watch the people at the
races as much as the horses,
then the Turf Club, at $12
per person, is for you.
The Turf Club, with its
dress code and gourmet fare
in the Coach Room and Ter
race dining areas, seems
miles away fro m the

teeming Grandstands.
I he Terrace area features tiered
tables inside a glass enclosure. The
view of the racecourse is incredible,
as are the four bars and exclusive
wagering area, which prevents pa
trons from having to ever worry
about waiting in line at something
as gauche as a betting window.
Should you chose not to view the
races from the Turf Club, reserved
seats will cost you an additional $2.50
in either the Club House or
Grandstand areas, but there are
plenty of free, unreserved seats in

both areas.
Between the bars, betting windows
and restaraunts is an excellent
racecourse. Stretching over a one
mile oval, the fir bark, loam and sand
course is for both thoroughbred and

quarter-horse racing.
The smaller turf course, 4,652 feet
long, consists of a mix of several
breeds of blue and rye grasses. The
turf course is reserved for only the
most prestigious races.

Approximately every half hour,
the trumpets sound the call,
and the horses are led to the
starting gates.
Minutes later, a bell sounds, the
crowd gasps collectively, and the
horses bound out of the starting gate.

Slowly at first, but then
more confidently, specta
tors cheer on their respec
tive horses. Cries of support
or derision rise above the
din. Suddenly, the cries end
with the race.
It is hard to believe, even
after experiencing several,
that very few of the races

J last longer than 20 seconds.
A day at the races is something
quite unusual, a reminder of bygone
days, and a chance to experience a
tradition-filled way of life that is
years away from the Stanford
campus. All of the elements of track,
spectators and setting work together
to create an incredible assault on the
senses.
It is exciting, interesting, and if
you're lucky, profitable. Give it a try.
Races start at 7:30 p.m. on Fridays
and Saturdays and at 1 p.m. on Sun
days and Mondays.
