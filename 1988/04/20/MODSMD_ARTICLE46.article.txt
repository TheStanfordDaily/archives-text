# Fun, Food and Fast Cars
## 
### 
Malibu Fun Center greets visitors with a variety of
sights and sounds housed in two facilities located
next door to each other, the Malibu Grand Prix
and the Malibu Castle.
Malibu Grand Prix is known primarily for its Formula
I, "Virage" race cars and its "mini-Virage" cars. This section
of Malibu Fun Center also serves food, has a video game
area and hosts group parties. To drive the Virage Formula
I cars, one must have a valid driver's license and be 18
years of age.
The Formula I cars can go up to 60 miles per hour.
Once you're in the starting block, get ready to face fast
straightaways, hairpin turns and screeching stops. The time
to beat is 48.14 seconds. Sixty seconds is a good time and
you can get into the 51 Second Club by beating that time.
Members of the 51 Second Club are allowed to drive the
faster club cars.

Malibu Castle has many recreations. Literally situated
in a "castle," this part of Malibu Fun Center offers miniature
golf, batting cages, a large amusement arcade, birthday
party packages and a sprint track.
There are three 18-hole miniature golf courses. They all
have similar obstacles, except for course number three
which is situated on a slight grade.
Some interesting holes include a windmill that rewards
a hole-in-one for an accurate putt in the specified slot and
a water wheel where the golfer has to cross a rustic footbridge
between the tee and the green.
The batting cages are next to the miniature golf and ofTer
different pitching speeds for all skill levels. There are both
baseball and Softball cages to accommodate all tastes.
The amusement arcade includes skeeball, a plethora of
the latest video games, and even a United States vs. Soviet
Union ice hockey game. One can also redeem tickets won
while playing skeeball for prizes.
Inside the arcade there is also an area for birthday parties.
The birthday party package includes miniature golf, popcorn,
pizza, soft drinks, ice cream, several game tokens and a
free gift for the birthday person.
Malibu Fun Center is great weekend amusement. For
more information call Malibu Castle at (415) 367-1906 or
Malibu Grand Prix at (415) 366-6463.
