# More Than A Bath House
## Massages and Hot Tubs In Palo Alto 
### 
I started the day with a
massage session.
A massage is great for
relieving stress. Around
finals time the number of
Stanford students getting
massages takes a marked
jump.
I was modest and wore
my shorts. If I had it to do
over I probably would have
skipped them. There are
long strokes that run from
your heel to your shoulder.
During this rub I became
very aware of the fact I still
had anything on. The stroke
started, a long rippling up
my body then it sort of took
a jump and restarted at my
waist and then continued up
my back. The jump kind of
ruined the stroke.
After an hour I felt
relaxed and very calm.
I was told that many
people have very emotional
experiences during a mas
sage. The tensions stored in
the muscle are released and
the underlying emotional
reason for the stress is
brought forward.

I didn't feel any release, just relaxed, but over the next
couple of days I became very aware of which muscles were
becoming tense again and more aware of how to prevent
the muscles from turning into knots.
After the massage I had a one-and-a-half-hour float in
the flotation tank.
The room where the tank was located was carpeted floor
to ceiling to deaden the surrounding sounds. It had a music
system for any tapes you would like to bring with you, it
had a shower, a resting area, and the tank.
The tank was filled with a highly salty water, more dense
then any normal water. This makes your body buoyant.
To make the salt water, about 800 pounds of epsom
salts are dissolved in about 100 gallons of water. I got some
water on my mouth and tasted it. It is the saltiest anything
you're likely to come across anywhere.
There was about eight inches of water in the tank. Hardly
diving depth, but more than deep enough for floating. The
only time I touched the bottom was when I was crawling
into and out of the tank.

I turned out all the lights
and closed the door to the
tank. I had been told that
some people have problems
with claustrophobia while in
the tank.
Fortunately my mild
claustrophobia didn't sur
face. The tank was roomy
and the door opened very
easily.
Relaxing in the tank took
some time. For awhile I
kept bouncing ofT of the
sides of the tank. I didn't
want to be touching any
thing, so when I came into
contact with a wall I would
nudge away and I would
slowly drift to the opposite
wall. Finally I got centered
and learned how to avoid
bouncing around.
The water in the tank is
regulated to 94 degrees and
after a little while it was
difficult to tell where the
water level was. It all felt
the same. I was floating but
I wasn't sure if I was float
ing in air or water.
The tank wasn't com
pletely quiet, which was a

little disappointing. I could hear some noise from the outside
world. I could hear — maybe feel — the distant rumbling
of an air conditioner or something, and occasionally I could
hear a loud voice.
The loudest noise by far, though, was my stomach. At
one point after what seemed to be about an hour and a
half I thought I heard a knock on the door telling me that
my time was up. It turned out to be my stomach grumbling.
After fading in and out of light dreams the knock finally
came. It was time to return to the real world.
I showered the salt off and dressed and slowly, casually,
wandered downstairs. I then went to the hot tubs to relax
a little more.
I knew I had made a mistake after just a few minutes.
I was too relaxed. If I stayed in the hot tub I would slither
to the bottom of the tub, and I wouldn't care. It was an
effort to move, but there were two other toys to play with
— the steam room and the cold plunge.
