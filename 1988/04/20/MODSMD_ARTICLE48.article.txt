# It Can 't Be Beat

Looking for something different to
do? Looking to relax and become
more aware of your body 9
Welcome to Watercourse Way.
Watercourse Way, located at 165
Charming St in Palo Alto, is a nice
warm place to relax and get away from
it all Watercourse Way is a bath house.
I call it a bath house simply because
that is what it is listed under in the
yellow pages. But it is far more then
just a bath house, more even than just
a full featured bath house.
Watercourse Way offers hot tubs,
saunas, steam rooms, cold plunges,
massages and a flotation tank.
There is even a sushi bar.
Most people know Watercourse Way
as the place with the hot tubs. There
are nine rooms with different types of
hot tubs and combinations of hot tubs
and saunas. Most often it is couples
that rent rooms for an hour or so, but
groups of up to eight can be accom
modated by the larger rooms.
The regulars come m with small bags
with bathing suits, shampoo, brushes
and other clothes.
Alcohol and drugs are not permitted
at Watercourse Way, and the manage
merit reserves the right to refuse ser
vice, so loud raucous parties are a
no no.

But for romance and relaxation it can't
be beat.
If you're looking for more then just
a soak in a hot tub, Watercourse Way
offers yoga courses, massage, and her
bal skin treatments.
For massage, Watercourse Way has
a staff of 15 massage practitioners Four
massage rooms and a variety of differ
ing styles of massage are available
The styles available from Water
course Way's practitioners are:
Swedish, Esalen, Shiatsu, Trager, Lomi,
Polarity, Accupressure, Reflexology,
Deep Tissue, Sports, Jin Shin Do and
a special massage for pregnant women
The "House Brand" is a combination
of Swedish and Esalen. This style of
massage is popular here and is the
standard at other massage places
The Esalen style of massage is bas
ically the same as Swedish but is a
more free and intuitive form of massage.
Swedish massage has a more regi
mented form that requires balance —
if the nght shoulder is given five rubs
then the left shoulder must be given
five nibs.
Both Esalen and Swedish are relaxing

types of massage. They use long rub
bing strokes of moderate pressure. This
works all of the surface muscles and
loosens them up, allowing the blood to
circulate better and to relieve the ten
sions the muscles have built up. It does
loosen some of the deeper muscles a
little.
Most of the massages combine
aspects of many diffenng styles.
Massages at Watercourse Way are
one hour long. The massages start at
9 30 a.m., 11 am, 12:30 p.m., 2 p.m.
3 30 p.m , 5 p.m., 6:30 p.m , 8 p.m. and
9:30 p.m As with all of Watercourse
Way's services, it is best to call ahead
for an appointment.
A unique facet of Watercourse Way
is it's flotation tank-
Flotation tanks, also known as isola
tion and sensory deprivation tanks, are
becoming more popular as their
benefits become more widely known.
The realities of flotation tanks are
much calmer than the images portrayed
in the movie "Altered States," but to
some they bring about increased
creativity, the ability to concentrate,
relief from stress and a light feeling of
euphona.
The pnces for the massage and all
of the facilities are very reasonable.
Even the sushi is reasonably pnced.
