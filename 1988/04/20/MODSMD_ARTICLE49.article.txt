## Education & Entertainment at Marine World Africa USA 
### 
A little more than an
hour's drive toward
wine country lies
Marine World Africa USA
— the official name for
what the resident lions,
tigers and dolphins call
home. It is a place of
animal magic, allowing
visitors to enter into the
wonder-filled world of live
animals.
With its recent move to
Vallejo from the nearby
Redwood Shores site,
Marine World has at
tempted to transform itself
from an entertainment
dominated animal park to
a non-profit foundation.
Officials say they are
dedicated to making the
park an educational
resource for the Bay Area.
According to animal
trainer Cecilia Plashadov,
"You can see all the films,
all the photo portfolios and
read all the books, but until
you see (the animals) in
the fur — that's when real
education begins to take
place."
Considering the prob
lems that accompany es
tablishing a new organiza
tion at new site, Marine
world has been surpris
ingly successful at balanc
ing the all-too-often com
peting goals of entertain
ment and education.
"We try to sneak educa
tion into the entertain
ment, at times even trick
people into learning," said
Pleshakov with a laugh.
The formal shows all
have entertainment value,
but with differing levels of
sophistication. All will ap
peal to children, but older
audiences will find some
superior to others.

I found the dolphin and
killer whale show to be
the most satisfying.
Each act included consid
erable detail of the physical
adaptations these mam
mals have made to the
marine environment. For
example, an orca can com
municate with friends 500
miles away through use of
its powerful tail.
The most informative
part of the whale act oc
curred accidentally.
The star, 20-year-old
Yakka, repeatedly balked
at initiating her "program."
During this time, the au
dience received an im
promptu discussion and
demonstration of the use
of visual cues and positive
reinforcement.
Yakka's individuality of
behavior underscored the

non-triviality of the animal
tricks we were so casually
enjoying, and gave a hint
to the tremendous efforts
devoted to the upbringing
and training of the animal
stars.
On the other hand, the
primate show was a disap
pointment.
The chimps were all too
cute and adorable in their
designer safari-wear. One
baby wore trendy diapers.
The entire act was at the
level of circus entertain
ment, with no more than
a few lines of actual infor
mation included.
There is much more at
Marine World than
just the shows. There
are animals to watch in
their various homes, and
sometimes to actually play

with. Newly born animals,
such as Bengal tigers from
Marine World's highly suc
cessful breeding program,
can be observed in their
nursery.
Also, special programs
during the year allow a
private backstage tour of
the animals for small
groups of children and
adults. In addition, a num
ber of special educational
opportunities are available
during a general visit.
For example, Marine
World offers a special "dis
covery room." This is an
educational laboratory
concentrating on the
adaptations animals make
to their environments.
Besides this room, Direc
tor of Education Pat Foster-
Turley has designed a
number of interactive ed

ucational kiosks.
These range from a game
of "Endangered Animal
Trivia" to a sophisticated
dolphin display introduc
ing the ideas of compara
tive anatomy between
humans and their salt
water cousins.
The staff is even more
dedicated to caring
for the animals than
they are to the education
of the visitors. Marine
World employees have
been in the news as they
led the fight to save a
beached 2-day-old por
poise. This activity is typ
ical of the extent to which
the staff's commitment to
wildlife extends beyond
the daily duties required
to maintain an animal
park.
All visitors are strongly
encouraged to talk as
much as they can with the
trainers. "We want the
trainers and handlers to be
a source of information for
you to walk up to. If you
go through the park pas
sively you won't get as
much out of it," said Jim
Bond, Marine World's
public relations represen

tative.
Ceci Hugo, director of
the Marine World Founda
tion, agreed. "Just ask the
trainers, that's what they
are there for, that's what
helps make us different,"
she said.
Potential visitors should
be aware of the problems
inherent in any animal
park: the potential crowds,
the jarring tributes to
Marine World's corporate
sponsors and the some
times unsophisticated level
of the entertainment.
However, looking be
yond these superficial ir
ritations, Marine World of
fers to introduce children
and reintroduce adults to
the magic kingdom of
animals.

A little more than an
hour's drive toward
wine country lies
Marine World Africa USA
— the official name for
what the resident lions,
tigers and dolphins call
home. It is a place of
animal magic, allowing
visitors to enter into the
wonder-filled world of live
animals.
With its recent move to
Vallejo from the nearby
Redwood Shores site,
Marine World has at
tempted to transform itself
from an entertainment
dominated animal park to
a non-profit foundation.
Officials say they are
dedicated to making the
park an educational
resource for the Bay Area.
According to animal
trainer Cecilia Plashadov,
"You can see all the films,
all the photo portfolios and
read all the books, but until
you see (the animals) in
the fur — that's when real
education begins to take
place."
Considering the prob
lems that accompany es
tablishing a new organiza
tion at new site, Marine
world has been surpris
ingly successful at balanc
ing the all-too-often com
peting goals of entertain
ment and education.
"We try to sneak educa
tion into the entertain
ment, at times even trick
people into learning," said
Pleshakov with a laugh.
The formal shows all
have entertainment value,
but with differing levels of
sophistication. All will ap
peal to children, but older
audiences will find some
superior to others.

I found the dolphin and
killer whale show to be
the most satisfying.
Each act included consid
erable detail of the physical
adaptations these mam
mals have made to the
marine environment. For
example, an orca can com
municate with friends 500
miles away through use of
its powerful tail.
The most informative
part of the whale act oc
curred accidentally.
The star, 20-year-old
Yakka, repeatedly balked
at initiating her "program."
During this time, the au
dience received an im
promptu discussion and
demonstration of the use
of visual cues and positive
reinforcement.
Yakka's individuality of
behavior underscored the

non-triviality of the animal
tricks we were so casually
enjoying, and gave a hint
to the tremendous efforts
devoted to the upbringing
and training of the animal
stars.
On the other hand, the
primate show was a disap
pointment.
The chimps were all too
cute and adorable in their
designer safari-wear. One
baby wore trendy diapers.
The entire act was at the
level of circus entertain
ment, with no more than
a few lines of actual infor
mation included.
There is much more at
Marine World than
just the shows. There
are animals to watch in
their various homes, and
sometimes to actually play

with. Newly born animals,
such as Bengal tigers from
Marine World's highly suc
cessful breeding program,
can be observed in their
nursery.
Also, special programs
during the year allow a
private backstage tour of
the animals for small
groups of children and
adults. In addition, a num
ber of special educational
opportunities are available
during a general visit.
For example, Marine
World offers a special "dis
covery room." This is an
educational laboratory
concentrating on the
adaptations animals make
to their environments.
Besides this room, Direc
tor of Education Pat Foster-
Turley has designed a
number of interactive ed

ucational kiosks.
These range from a game
of "Endangered Animal
Trivia" to a sophisticated
dolphin display introduc
ing the ideas of compara
tive anatomy between
humans and their salt
water cousins.
The staff is even more
dedicated to caring
for the animals than
they are to the education
of the visitors. Marine
World employees have
been in the news as they
led the fight to save a
beached 2-day-old por
poise. This activity is typ
ical of the extent to which
the staff's commitment to
wildlife extends beyond
the daily duties required
to maintain an animal
park.
