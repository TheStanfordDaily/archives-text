# Radio waves: Animal rights debated
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
In a fiery exchange on KZSU last
night, Stanford officials defended the
University's use of animals for research
and contested charges from telephone
callers that animal research is being
performed excessively and often to in
crease individual researchers' grants
from the National Institutes of Health.
Psychology Prof. Jeffrey Wine, in an
interview taped earlier, said only people
who are "abysmally ignorant of the way
animal research is done around here"
believe all animal research must end.
"It is just not possible to have any
kind of medical research without
animals," Wine said.
One caller said animal-rights activists
and scientists who conduct research

fight each other instead of working to
gether.
In fact, the debate itself reflected the
polarization of the issue. Almost all of
the phone calls came from animal rights
supporters.
The debate, which ran 20 minutes
over its 30-minute time limit, was
punctuated by pointed disagreement
over how Stanford treats its animals
and how animals contribute to research
at Stanford.
Several callers criticized the radio pro
gram for only representing the Univer
sity perspective, and voiced disappoint
ment in the "pat" responses and "in
complete" answers University officials
provided.
Law Prof. John Kaplan said animal
rights supporters see researchers as
"mad scientists who get their jollies tor-

Turing animals."
In response to a question concerning
a researcher who violated standard pro
cedures for animal treatment last fall
by incompletely anesthizing a cat, Wine
called the incidence "regrettable." Yet,
he voiced confidence that such incidents
are "rare" and "not tolerated by the
research community."
Stereotyping researchers as cruel and
disinterested about animal welfare is a
practice that must be discredited, ac
cording to Wine. "We don't enjoy
causing pain, and we go to great lengths
to avoid it. Our jobs are to ameliorate
suffering," he said.
Another topic discussed was the ques
tion of unnecessary animal use when
alternative methods of research could
be employed. Contrary to animal
rights groups' claims, Tom
Hamm, director of the Division
of Laboratory Animal Medicine,
said researchers actually try to
use animals only when "abso
lutely necessary." The expense of
using animals creates an "eco
nomic incentive" to avoid their
use, he said.
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for Public Affairs, called
animal research the "state of the
art," and said researchers must
continue to perform the same ex
periments on animals several
times.
He contested charges that
repeating experiments is only an
excuse to justify more funding.
According to Horton, researchers
must strive to verify the data they
find.
However, researchers "will not
repeat experiments for which they
are sure of the answer they are

going to get," he said.
Hamm added that nothing is to
be gained by duplicating experi
ments unnecessarily because repl
icated information can not be pub
lished and no grants are given for
projects in which animals are used
in lieu of alternative methods.
According to Hamm, animal use
accounts for only a small portion
of all funding for medical research
at Stanford, and only a small frac
tion of most researchers' work.
Stanford receives no financial
benefit from using animals in re
search, according to Hamm, who
added that "some costs of re
search are not covered by the gov
ernment and we have to bear
them ourselves."
"Everyone in the Medical
School could make more money
in private practice. We're not in
it for the money," he said.
According to Horton, animal re
search is crucial because every
successful medical treatment has
been thoroughly tested on
animals at some point in its de
velopment.
Likewise, the officials refuted
callers' charges that evaluation

procedures for research proposals
are too lenient, allowing excessive
animal testing. One caller sugges
ted that this is because proposals
are reviewed by a jury of peers,
made up of other scientists who
also apply for funding.
However, Hamm countered
that between 50 and 150 research
proposals are submitted monthly,
and only one in three projects ac
tually receive funding.
Horton said the charges of bias
in the review process are "simply
not true."
One caller, Lise Giraud, an
animal-rights activist from the
Palo Alto Humane Society, voiced
skepticism that sufficient atten
tion is paid to the details of re
search proposals, including
animal use, considering the large
number of proposals reviewed
each month.
Horton responded that all pro
posals must state whether the ex
periment can be done without
animals, and "if it can, it should
be." He characterized this appli
cation procedure as a "very
deliberate process, with lots of
checking."
