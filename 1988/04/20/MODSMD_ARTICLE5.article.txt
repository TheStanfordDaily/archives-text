# Radio waves: Animal rights debated
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
In a fiery exchange on KZSU last
night, Stanford officials defended the
University's use of animals for research
and contested charges from telephone
callers that animal research is being
performed excessively and often to in
crease individual researchers' grants
from the National Institutes of Health.
Psychology Prof. Jeffrey Wine, in an
interview taped earlier, said only people
who are "abysmally ignorant of the way
animal research is done around here"
believe all animal research must end.
"It is just not possible to have any
kind of medical research without
animals," Wine said.
One caller said animal-rights activists
and scientists who conduct research

fight each other instead of working to
gether.
In fact, the debate itself reflected the
polarization of the issue. Almost all of
the phone calls came from animal rights
supporters.
The debate, which ran 20 minutes
over its 30-minute time limit, was
punctuated by pointed disagreement
over how Stanford treats its animals
and how animals contribute to research
at Stanford.
Several callers criticized the radio pro
gram for only representing the Univer
sity perspective, and voiced disappoint
ment in the "pat" responses and "in
complete" answers University officials
provided.
Law Prof. John Kaplan said animal
rights supporters see researchers as
"mad scientists who get their jollies tor-

Turing animals."
In response to a question concerning
a researcher who violated standard pro
cedures for animal treatment last fall
by incompletely anesthizing a cat, Wine
called the incidence "regrettable." Yet,
he voiced confidence that such incidents
are "rare" and "not tolerated by the
research community."
Stereotyping researchers as cruel and
disinterested about animal welfare is a
practice that must be discredited, ac
cording to Wine. "We don't enjoy
causing pain, and we go to great lengths
to avoid it. Our jobs are to ameliorate
suffering," he said.
Another topic discussed was the ques
tion of unnecessary animal use when
alternative methods of research could
