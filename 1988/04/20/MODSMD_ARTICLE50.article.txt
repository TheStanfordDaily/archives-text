# Wine Tasting
## The 						Best of Napa Valley 
### 
Those looking for a real California
experience ought to consider
wine tasting tours in Napa Val
ley. Beyond providing a slice of Cali
fornia life, the tours are easily acces
sible and can be very informative.
Maps of Napa, which are helpful in
planning visits to the major wineries,
are available in most markets and liq
uor stores.
There are over 140 wineries in
Napa, most of which are open to the
public. So even without a map, no one
should have trouble finding them.
Many wineries offer tours that show
each step in the production of wine.
Most have a guide, but some tours
are self-guided, which can be more
interesting because the signs in each
room tend to give more detailed infor
mation than guides have time to.
Each tour explains how grapes can
be made into either red or white wine.
The process of fermentation and the
importance of when to stop the process
is outlined.
Just the experience of smelling the
aroma of the wine that has permeated
the walls and standing next to a barrel
of wine that's larger than most dorm
rooms makes each tour a treat.
While just about all tours are op
tional, occasionally a winery will re
quire that guests take the tour before
drinking the wine. These tours tend
to be shorter (about 10 minutes instead
of 30) and go into signficantly less
depth about the wine-making proc
esses.
The wine-tasting mystique should
not be allowed to frighten anyone away
from Napa Valley. One day of tasting
is guaranteed to teach each visitor the
complete list of catch phrases as well
as some true pointers on how to dis
tinguish fine (or not-so-fine) wines.
In every winery's tasting room there
is a list of wines they are serving that
day. The list is in the order that the
wines are served. Whites are served
before red, and dry wines with very
little residual sugar are served before

sweet wines. This way an earlier bou
quet will not cloud the flavor of the
next wine.
There are four ways to evaluate the
wines. Each is very subjective and the
value given each criterion is up to the
person judging.
The first point is appearance. Does
the wine look good? Personally, I'm
not very picky in this category; I just
like a white wine to look different from
water and a red wine to be very dark.
The smell of the wine is referred to
as its "nose" and is the next step in
evaluating a wine. Some whites have
very little smell, while others smell
like a bed of roses. I like mine some
where in between. Reds typically have
a strong, musty odor.
The entire process so far — evalu
ating the appearance and nose — takes
about 30 seconds. The next step is to
taste the wine. Everyone knows what
they like, so there are no tips I can
ofTer for this stage.
After drinking the wine, one should
consder the aftertaste. Does a pleasant
flavor linger or is there the irresistible
urge to pucker? The meaning of each
should be clear.
Almost all wineries offer free wine
tasting. Only a few require the pur
chase of a glass, usually at a cost of
$1 to $3.
Probably the best approach to an
afternoon of tasting is to find one or
two wines that seem pleasing and con
sistently try those types at each winery.
Even if a winery isn't serving those
wines, ask for them anyway — it is
my experience that they will probably
serve them to you. This way you can,
by the end of a day, be able to dis
tinguish differences in each winery's
creation.
As might be expected, food and
lodging in Napa Valley are both plenti
ful and expensive. For those on a
budget, taking bread, cheese and cold
cuts to the picnic grounds at most
wineries is a good idea.
