# Where to go in Napa
## 
### 
With over 100 wineries in Napa
Valley open to the public, the
greatest dilemma faced by po
tential wine tasters is which wineries
to visit.
Too often people try to stop at every
winery they see. However, if you try
this, by the end of the day you will be
too tired to distinguish the vanous wines
that you have tasted.
At most, a person can visit four to
five wineries per day. Tourists hoping
to make the most of their time should
plan well in advance Here is a list of
unique wineries that may provide some
ideas.
Near the sourthem end of the valley
is the Robert Mondavi Winery. This is
one of the largest wineries in the valley
and their excellent tour explains state
of-the-art wane production One must
take the tour in order to taste their
wines, which are quire good.

Tourists hoping to make the
most of their time should plan
well in advance.

Farther north on Highway 29 (the
main Napa thoroughfare) is Beaulieu
Vineyard. Beaulieu offers an exception
ally classy wine tasting expenence.
Upon entering the winery, guests are
presented wine glasses and encour
aged to stroll around the hospitality
room while enjoying the wine. The room
itself is decorated with photographcs
of the winery and antique wine para
phernalia
Along with the informative tour,
Beaulieu provides an interesting 15 nun
ute multi-media presentation every half
hour. The tours and presentation are
optional.
A great place to stop for lunch is
the V. Sattin Winery This winery has
a complete delicatessen and an outdoor
picnic area
In addition, V. Sattui makes some
excellent wines particularly their
Rieslings and Madeira. Thei wines are
sold only at the winery, so the selection
offered for tasting is more generous
than at most places Tours are by ap
pointment only.
Almost directly across the street is
the Sutter Home Winery, offering some

very inexpensive wines. These wines
should be a staple for those on a stu
dent's budget. Unfortunately, Sutter
Home is often crowded and offers no
tours.
Quite a bit further north is Sterling
Vineyards. Sterling has a large Spanish
style building, set on the top of a hill,
that is accessible only by tram Once
at the top, though, the view is stunning.
Though the tram costs $5 per person,
the ticket stub entitles the bearer to a
$2 discount on any purchase of wine
Amve fairly early, since the last tram
leaves the base of the mountain at 4:30
p.m. and there is often a line.
Sterling offers a self-guided tour. If
one takes the time to read the posted
signs, this tour will provide more infor
mation than other tours.
At the end of the tour is the wine
tasting room where visitors can relax
while wines are served to each table.
At the base of Sterling is Clos
Pegase, which opened only last year.
Pegase's building was constructed ac
cording to a design by well known ar
chitect Michael Graves. The design
won a San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art competition in which over
90 architects completed to create a
winery that would combine the best of
art and function.
Pegase is owned by art collector Jan
Shrem, who has filled the winery with
replicas of pieces of abstract and sur
realistic art from his collection. The tour
is fun and exciting thanks both to the
building and the flamboyant guides.
Because the winery is new, it makes
only two wines, both of which are avail
able for tasting. Visitors must buy an
exceptionally nice wine glass (at a cost
of $3) in order to taste the wines. The
tour is free.
To get to Napa, take Highway 101
to the Dumbarton Bridge and head
north on Interstate 880, which becomes
Interstate 80 180 intersects Highway
29, the main Napa thoroughfare. All of
the winenes above are located on or
next to Highway 29 and are easily ac
cessible.
There are a lot of winenes worth
visiting right on Highway 29 north of
Oakville. The beauty of the drive
through Napa Valley and the free wine
tasting will make the trip well worth
the effort

In this era of ultramodern hotels,
motels and executive airport suites,
a true country inn is a refreshing
ranty. The Villa St. Helena in the Napa
Valley is a postcard-perfect model of
a country inn. The Villa sits high atop
20 acres of peaceful woodland over
looking the Napa Valley.
This bed and-breakfast has countless
bedrooms, each with a distinctly unique
decor. One room is decorated in the
soft whites and lace of the Victorian
penod, while the adjacent room is nch
with heavy, dark redwood turn of the
century antiques.
Each room has a private bath.
Despite its countless bedrooms, the
Villa St. Helena caters to only three
fortunate couples on any given night.
Guests can enjoy the spacious common
rooms. There is a beamed ceiling living
room that forms the gathering place of
this 12,000 square-foot, three level es
tate. The television show "Falcon Crest"
recently chose this room to film several
scenes.

Off the living room is a cozy library
with a fireplace and enough literature
to keep guests in reading material for
decades. On the other side of the living
room is a breakfast alcove overlooking
a large courtyard and swimming pool.
Here, guests gather each morning for
a complimentary feast.
This beautiful estate served as a
luxury chateau for the rich and famous
dunng the 1940s and '50s. It later fell
into a state of disrepair and only now,
after years of tender loving care by
innkeeper Ralph Cotton, has it once
again captured its histonc grandeur.
Cotton's concern for his guests is
evident everywhere. He appears per
sonally each morning to supervise
breakfast and linger with guests. He is
more than willing to offer free, expert
advice on where to go for the best
wine tasting, dining and touring in the
valley.
The Villa St. Helena protects its ex
elusive romantic ambience by means
of a three quarter-mile-long private

driveway. This bed and-breakfast inn is
not for everyone. There are no televi
sions here. Instead, guests are supplied
with a complimentary bottle of wine
with which to entertain themselves This
is a quiet, romantic place to enjoy with
someone special. The numerous paths
around the inn's grounds are ideal for
secluded walks, and each group of
rooms has its own pnvate entrance.
