# Dining On Deck
## An Evening of Enchantment on the Bay 
### 
The age of elegant dining and
luxurious travel is alive and
well on San Francisco Bay.
The Hornblovver Yachts Co.
presents the Peninsula's only dinner
and dancing cruises in the best of
riverboat traditions. Its vessel, "City
of San Francisco," is a floating
nightclub and restaurant in one.
On the night of our visit, the staff
quickly set the tone for the evening
with its courtesy and efficiency. The
full nautical dress of the stewards
and the captain gave us the feeling
we were embarking on a true adven
ture.
As the last of the guests were
seated, the crew smoothly and
silently nudged the ship out of its
berth and the journey began.
The guests were treated to candlelit
settings on each of the yacht's three
decks. Each level was unique in its
presentation of space and entertain
ment, offering a variety for the ad
venturous passenger.
The lower-deck passengers en
joyed the most spacious of the three
decks, with a band that did justice
to songs by artists ranging from from
Huey Lewis to Glenn Miller, a dance
floor and a cabaret show by the trio
of Nicholas, Glover and Wray.
The cabaret was a pleasant accom
paniment to dinner, with the three

young ladies mixing beautiful har
monies with interesting arrange
ments of Duke Ellington and Cab
Calloway tunes.
The hum of the diesels in the back
ground and the view of the Bay out
side the picture windows were the
only reminders that we were in fact
at sea while our steward served the
hors d'oeuvres and cocktails.

We were offered our choice of
several entrees for dinner — my
guest and I chose filet mignon and
poached prawns. Both meals,
prepared on board by the ship's
several chefs, were quite satisfactory.
The Napa Valley jewel, ZD's '80
Cabernet Sauvignon, was an excel
lent complement to the entrees and
assured continued enjoyment of the
meal.
Between courses, we toured the

decks and enjoyed the sights of the
Bay. The middle deck was adorned
with mahogany accents and boasted
an excellent jazz band.
As the smallest of the decks, the
upper deck was the only one without
a band, and it provided a quiet, in
timate atmosphere, perfect for more
relaxed conversation.
In the highest point on the ship,
the pilot cabin, Captain Bell proudly
discussed his relationship with the
unusual firm. "This is the most re
warding of careers," he said. "The
captain has the pleasure of seeing
the fruits of his labor immediately."
"On these cruises most of the
guests have very little experience at
sea," Bell explained. "Therefore my
job is tii be sure to avoid or minimize
the impact of the slightest of swells."
We returned to find a delightful
dessert of chocolate mousse covered
with strawberry sauce awaiting us.
The mousse was light and fluffy and
a delicious topper to what was
proving to be an excellent evening.
The guests were all quite friendly
and sociable, as if the cruise were as
much a social event as an interesting
way to spend an evening on the Bay.
The company offers both dinner
and brunch cruises, which leave from
Pier 33 in San Francisco.
