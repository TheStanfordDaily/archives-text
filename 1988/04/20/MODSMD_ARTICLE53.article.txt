An early morning trip up to Coit
Tower is unrivaled in splendor.
The tower, perched on San
Francisco's Telegraph Hill, offers a
splendid view of the San Francisco
Bay. From the observation area sur
rounding the base of the tower you
can see the city's Italian quarter, fan
ning out around Washington Square
and the Church of Saints Peter and
Paul.
A quick dash across the Golden
Gate Bridge puts it all into per
spective. From the hills at the
mouth of the Bay you can see the
distant skyscrapers of the city bathed
in sunlight as seemingly perpetual fog
enshrouds the bay.
As the day progresses the fog burns
ofT in the city, but hovers waiting for
the night just ofT shore. At times the
thick fog settles just below the bridge.
The drive across the bridge seems al
most heavenly with nothing but fluffy
white clouds below.
