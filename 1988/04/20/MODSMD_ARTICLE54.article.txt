Hunger strikes everyone, and
what better place to eat a quick
lunch then Fisherman's
Wharf. Fresh seafood is one of the
many things that makes San Francisco
internationally famous. The rows of
crab boats and trawlers just back from
the morning's catch attest to the fresh
ness of the fish available here.
How about a trip across the
world by cable car? Home to
more then 75,000 Chinese,
Chinatown is the largest settlement
outside of mainland China. A different
world can be found here, where even
the street signs are in Chinese.
A stop into one of the many Dim
Sum restaraunts where the food is
brought on carts yields a rare pleasure.
You've got to be fast because the cart
comes around every few minutes but
some foods disappear quickly. He who
hesitates is lost.
