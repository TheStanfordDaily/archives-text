# Monterey
## The 						Sights & Sounds of the California Seacoast 
### 
Monterey, the closer of the
twin cities of Monterey and
Carmel, is a truly unique
tourist experience. Between Cannery
Row, the Monterey Aquarium, Fort
Ord and the numerous shops and
beaches, there is always something
for the pleasure-seeker.
No one visiting Monterey should
miss Fisherman's Wharf. Wandering
along the wharf, though it is not as
large as San Francisco's, is a truly
pleasant way to spend an afternoon.
The wharf has several attractions,
inlcuding bay cruises — even one
featuring a glass-bottomed boat —
boat charters, a theater, and sourvenir
shops with enough shot glasses and
sea shells to choke a horse.
To take advantage of Monterey's
excellent opportunities, there are
several good hotels near the tourist
stops. Among the best known are the

Monterey Beach Hotel (right on the
waterfront), the Sheraton and
Doubletree hotels (next to the wharf),
and Monterey Placa and Spindrift
Inn on Cannery Row.
My guest and I stayed at Hilton's
Monterey Resort Hotel. Located just
off Highway 1 and five minutes from
the wharf and Cannery Row, the Hil
ton is quite conveniently placed.
With 200 rooms, the Hilton has
something for everyone. Our room
was comfortable, with a king-size bed
and sitting area. Also available arc
suites with catchy names like "The
Nancy Lopez Suite" or "The Jack
Nicklaus Suite" — one gets the idea.
The balcony, overlooking the size
able pool, had patio chairs and a
table, which made it perfect for
lounging with a drink or book.
All the amenities are provided, in
true Hilton fashion. The jacuzzi that

easily holds 20 people, the men's and
women's saunas, the tennis courts
and other facilities serve to provide
vacationers with every possible di
version.
In addition to a nice but expensive
restaurant, the hotel has a pleasant
bar and lounge that features live
music Thursday through Sunday.
The staff is efficient and courteous
and as businesslike as one would ex
pect at "America's Business Address."
In fact, the professional atmosphere
could be the only major drawback
to the hotel. This is no bed-and
breakfast inn — it is an establishment
run by a major hotel chain. Accord
ingly, room and maid service were
both timely and pleasant, as one
would expect at $90 or more per
room.
