# A
						Romantic Getaway Built For Two

### 
If a romantic weekend at one of
Northern California's oldest and
most beautiful bcd-and-breakfast
inns sounds nice, pack your bags for
Santa Cruz.
Everything about the Babbling
Brook Inn is perfectly orchestrated
to provide the most relaxing, cordial
atmosphere possible.
The main building, situated on the
foundation of an 1870s tannery, is a
nostalgic log structure once owned
by a self-proclaimed Austrian
countess.
Most of the inn's 12 rooms are
spread around an acre of garden
through which Laurel Creek runs,
giving the Babbling Brook Inn its
name.
Every day from 5:30 p.m. on, the
Kings invite their guests to the inn's
lovely sitting room to enjoy a blazine

fire and partake in a sherry hour,
during which wine, beer and soda
are also served.
The Kings also encourage guests
to look through the "review books"
the inn maintains. These helpful
notebooks consist of entries from past
Babbling Brook guests. Each entry
includes a description of at least one
restaurant the guests had visited and
their recommendations concerning
those establishments.
In addition, most of the entries are
full of lavish praise of the King's
hospitality. Our own experience was

Countess Room, named in honor of
the inn's former owner). Like all of
the rooms named after Impres
sionists, the room was decorated with
prints by the artist and in the colors
most prevalent in his works.
Most of the inn's rooms have
fireplaces, and the two that do not
have them have whirlpool baths —
a reasonable trade-off considering the
sitting room's review books indicate
that the baths are large enough to
fit two (snugly, at any rate).
When Tom King showed us to our
room, he pointed out the television
a portable black-and-white kept
in the closet — explaining, "The
guests do not come here for our TV."
What the guests do come for —
and what they get — a wonderfully
relaxing break from the rules and
rituals of daily life. The Kings en-
