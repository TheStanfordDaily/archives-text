# Dining Out In Monterey
## 
### 
At the end of the Fisherman's
Wharf in Monterey is Kappa's
Seafood. The view from the
dining room windows alone is worth
the price of the dinner, and the res
taurant bears more than a passing
resemblance to Catagnola's and
Alioto's on San Francisco's wharf.
I he pleasant decor is red and
white, displaying the restaurant's Ital
ian influence as clearly as does the
eggplant parmegiana on the menu.
One of the dozens of waterfront
restaurants in Monterey, Rappa's is
set apart by its reasonable prices and
excellent service.
The dinner selection is generous,
with choices including Italian foods
and pasta, seafood and steaks.
Prices range from $6 to $15 a la
carte, with clam chowder and salad
costing an additional $2.
The clam chowder is delicious,
though unusual. It is not the thick,
chalky white chowder New England
is so famous for, but rather a well
spiced mix of fresh clams in a slightly
thinner sauce.
My selection of the Crab a la New

berg was well rewarded. The tasty
slices of crab meat were quite fresh
and anything but rubbery. The
cheese sauce was delicious, and with
the rice, made for a pleasant dinner
combination.
My guest's broiled salmon was as
juicy and flaky as anyone could wish,
and iike the Crab Newberg, it was
served in just the right portions.

Rappy's features a satisfactory, in
expensive wine list, in addition to
the house wine, which we chose. The
white was fruity and not too dry, a
nice complement to the meal.
In all, Kappa's provides a pleasant,
moderately priced meal with excel
lent service and a picturesque view.
Reservations are accepted.
