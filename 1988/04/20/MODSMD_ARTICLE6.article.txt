# 24-hour health folio finds success on LOTS

### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
After a large-scale evaluation of
a computerized health promotion
program, the developers of Stan
ford Health-Net say they are
ready to begin encouraging stu
dents to use their LOTS accounts
to access health information 24
hours a day.
Headed by Tom Robinson, di
rector of Health-Net, and Paul
Walters, director of Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, the recently
concluded evaluation revealed
that a random sampling of 500
students with access to Health-
Net reduced their visits to Cowell
by 23 percent as compared to an
other sampling of 500 students
who did not have access to the
program.
Available to all students with
LOTS accounts since last fall,
Stanford Health-Net aims to
promote healthful behaviors and
effective use of health care serv
ices "through education about ap
propriate self-care," said Robin
son, a student in the School of
Medicine.
"The response from the study
was very positive," Robinson said.
"Overall, the students (who tried
the program) really liked it."
Self-Help-Info, the component

of Health-Net that the evaluation
participants used the most, con
sists of information on over 90
health topics. The self-help pro
gram can also interview users
about specific symptoms they may
be feeling and synthesize their re
sponses to provide a recommen
dation about either seeing a
physician at Cowell or trying a
home treatment.
Robinson said he expected par
ticipants of the study who had
access to Self-Help-Info to visit
Cowell less frequently because
they would form a "better
educated community" on health
issues through information on the
network.
Alejandro Martinez, director of
the Health Promotion Program
at Cowell, said Self-Help has the
"major advantage" of allowing
people to obtain information
quickly and confidentially.
However, Robinson cautioned
that "no one can really use Self-
Help in the place of a physician."
"The program is not that so
phisticated (and) does not make
a diagnosis," he said.
Instead, Self-Help-Info "en
courages people to use Cowell"
but also "saves people a trip to
Cowell" with relevant informa
