If only I had a
LaserWriter...
Think of all the wonderful things
you could do if only you had a
LaserWriter** printer.
Okay, now come into Kinkos and
use ours.
Use our Macintoshand
LaserWriter® system to produce
near-typeset quality documents
without the high cost of
conventional typesetters or
expensive equipment.
