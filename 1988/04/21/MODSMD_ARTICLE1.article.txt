# Rival factions protest
## Animal research battle lines drawn on campus 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Animal rights demonstrators peacefully
marched to three sites on campus yester
day, depositing black wreaths to com
memorate the deaths of animals used in
what they call "needless" research.
Meanwhile, members of a national
group organized in 1985 to support the
use of animals in research demonstrated
in White Plaza and at President Donald
Kennedy's office to show support for sci
entists who conduct research on animals.
Carrying placards stating "Mengele was
a researcher too" and wearing shirts pic
turing bloody animals and logos charging

"Stanford has scalpels for hire," 50
animal rights activists picketed the re
search facility of Psychiatry Prof.
Seymour Levine, the Research Animal Fa
cility and the Environmental Safety Fa
cility.
The procession was shadowed by at
least three different police cars as it
threaded its way across campus. Accord
ing to Stanford Police Sgt. Rick En berg,
the unusually high police presence was
intended to "gather intelligence," includ
ing the identity of march leaders who
could be contacted to ensure the protest's
peaceful nature.

Supporters of both sides of the animal research debate held
demonstrations on campus yesterday, though the groups never
met. Members of Incurably 111 for Animal Research, above, march
down Lausen Mall on their way to President Kennedy's office.
Simultaneously, animal research protesters, right, chant outside
of the Environmental Safety Facility.


Ken Beer — Dally
which lasted about two hours —
as "orderly and peaceful."
Former Stanford librarian
Lise Giraud, one of the organi
zers of the march, described the
event — and the placing of
wreaths in particular — as a
"symbolic commemoration of
animals whose lives were taken
from them."
Levine was unaware of any
visit by the demonstrators, who
didn't get past a locked gate.
Levine said he was tired of
animal rights demonstrators
harassing him about research
completed 10 years ago. "We
don't do anything horrible," said
Levine of his research.
When the group reached the
ESF, they tried to enter. But
the door was locked and security
guards kept the marchers from
entering the facility. After half
an hour of waiting, the marchers
barricaded the truck entrance to
the facility and then dispersed.
Alain Decleve, director of
health and safety, said the peace
ful demonstration disrupted
some of the work at the facility.
Demonstrators prevented trucks
that gather waste at sites on
campus from leaving the facility.
Decleve said he was unsure
why the facility was chosen as
a protest site. "I have always
felt the building of the ESF was
a fantastic achievement," he
said. According to Decleve, the
work done in the building has

no bearing on the nature of re
search done with animals, but
disposes of the byproducts of
such investigations.
The issue of safety is used as
a political tool by a lot of political
movements, according to
Decleve, who acknowledged that
recent health and safety difficul
ties at Stanford "makes us
visible and a target" for protest.
The opponents of the animal
rights activists congregated in
White Plaza before carrying a
banner reading "Lab animals
save lives" to the President's of
fice.
The supporters of animal re
search, a dozen members of
Citizens for Life, Education and
Research, or CLEAR, and In
curably 111 for Animal Research
charged that the delay in con
struction of a new animal re
search facility at Stanford
caused by animal rights activists
in fact delayed moving animals
to better quarters on campus.
Construction of a new animal
research building has been
delayed for more than six
months since animal rights adv
ocates, in an attempt to block
construction, insisted that an
environmental impact report be
conducted.
Laura Esserman, a member of
CLEAR, said the motivation for
her support of reseachers is that
"almost all important cures
came from research using
animals."
Animal research supporter
Karin Vagshenian said simply:
"I have cancer and my life
depends on this kind of re
