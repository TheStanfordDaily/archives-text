# Rival factions protest
## Animal research battle lines drawn on campus 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Animal rights demonstrators peacefully
marched to three sites on campus yester
day, depositing black wreaths to com
memorate the deaths of animals used in
what they call "needless" research.
Meanwhile, members of a national
group organized in 1985 to support the
use of animals in research demonstrated
in White Plaza and at President Donald
Kennedy's office to show support for sci
entists who conduct research on animals.
Carrying placards stating "Mengele was
a researcher too" and wearing shirts pic
turing bloody animals and logos charging

"Stanford has scalpels for hire," 50
animal rights activists picketed the re
search facility of Psychiatry Prof.
Seymour Levine, the Research Animal Fa
cility and the Environmental Safety Fa
cility.
The procession was shadowed by at
least three different police cars as it
threaded its way across campus. Accord
ing to Stanford Police Sgt. Rick En berg,
the unusually high police presence was
intended to "gather intelligence," includ
ing the identity of march leaders who
could be contacted to ensure the protest's
peaceful nature.
Enberg characterized the protest —

Supporters of both sides of the animal research debate held
demonstrations on campus yesterday, though the groups never
met. Members of Incurably 111 for Animal Research, above, march
down Lausen Mall on their way to President Kennedy's office.
Simultaneously, animal research protesters, right, chant outside
of the Environmental Safety Facility.
