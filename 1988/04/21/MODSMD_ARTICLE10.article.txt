# Japanese-American internees
## U.S. Senate makes amends 
### Erin Martin Editorial Staff with wire reports 
The U.S. Senate, moving to
close a controversial chapter in
American history, overwhelm
ingly passed legislation yesterday
that would pay $20,000 each to
about 60,000 Japanese-Americans
who were ordered from homes in
West Coast states during World
War II and put in detention
camps.
Under the historic bill, which
was approved 69-27, the federal
government also would issue a
formal apology. Most of internees
were American citizens at the
time of their incarceration. The
estimated $1.3 billion in payments
would be spread out over five
years.
House members, who already
have passed the legislation, are
expected to give quick approval
to some minor char ges in the Sen
ate version before sending it on
to the White House, possibly next
week. Sponsors are hopeful that
President Reagan will sign the
bill.
Ed Sasaki, a first-year Stanford
law student who orchestrated a
campus-wide letter writing cam

paign that urged passage of the
bill, said last night that he is "ec
static."
"So many people have been
working for this for so long, and
it is something Japanese-
Americans have been waiting for
40 years," Sasaki said.
Over 40 percent of Stanford law
school students and a number of
professors and students from
other disciplines joined 10,000
supporters in writing letters to
Reagan.
Sasaki was not as optimistic as
government officials about
Reagan signing the bill. "Given
Reagan's record on civil rights
and minority issues, there prob
ably will be a veto."
Several Japanese-Americans
who spent time in the detention
camps expressed relief that the
bill had passed, saying their war
time experience had been a psy
chological burden for years.
"Our name has finally been
cleared," said Grace Uyehara, ex
ecutive director of the Japanese-
American Citizens League, who
was uprooted from her home in
Stockton, Calif., and sent to a
camp in Arkansas during the war.
"We are Americans."
The detention policy began in

1942, when the nation experi
enced a wave of anti-Japanese
sentiment after the attack on
Pearl Harbor. Amid mounting
fears of an invasion on the West
Coast, the federal government re
quired the mandatory evacuation
from the area of all individuals
of Japanese ancestry, saying they
might be security risks.
Eventually, more than 120,000
people were sent from their
homes, mostly in California.
Many had to sell all of their
belongings, often on 72 hours
notice. More than 77,000 of the
evacuees were American citizens,
according to a U.S. Senate report.
Under the bill, reparations of
$12,000 would also be paid to
about 450 Aleut Indians who were
uprooted from their Aleutian Is
land homes by the U.S. Army and
sent to detention camps for the
duration of the war.
"The first call upon a nation is
that it honor its obligations, and
this is a just obligation," said Sen.
Pete Wilson, R-Calif. "The
$20,000 award is in no way an
exaggeration of what was lost. In
most cases where property loss
occurred, $20,000 is a small frac
tion of what occurred."
