# New whooping cough vaccine
## Improved serum promises to cut out side effects, researchers say 
### Heather Woodcock 
A new and improved whoop
ing cough vaccine may be hitting
the market within the next five
years, thanks to the efforts of
researchers at the Stanford
Medical Center.
The Medical Center's
pediatrics division, working in
conjunction with Japanese sci
entists who first hatched the
idea in 1981, is about to inoc
ulate 90 babies aged two months
with the new serum, which will
replace an older version that
produces unsettling side effects.
According to Dr. Charles
Prober, associate professor of
pediatrics and head the five-year
testing program, the test will
involve injecting the infants
with the new vaccine every few
months.
The old vaccine has lingered
here in the United States since
the 19405, producing: ide effects
such as high fever, swelling,
drowsiness, and in ra/e cases —
one out of every 300,000 — se
vere neurological damage.
Prober said the old vaccine
consisted of taking the whoop

ing cough bacteria — known as
pertussis — "and modifying it
with heat and then injecting the
vaccine into the infant's muscles
in small doses to build up im
munity."
While the old process fed the
child with a large amount of
bacterial products, the new vac
cine that Prober is testing is a
purified vaccine which has fewer
and less severe side effects.
When we hear the term
"whooping cough" it sounds
harmless enough, yet it has
resulted in numerous fatalities,
Prober said.
"Whooping cough," Prober
said, "is a bacterial infection. It
actually affects all age groups,
but the younger we are the more
prone to infection we are. The
clear sign of whooping cough is
a 'cough, cough, cough, whoop'
sound.
"In Britain, when protests
ran rampant a few years ago in
response to the old vaccine's
side effects, outbreaks of whoop
ing cough cases and deaths oc
curred as more parents refused
to let their children take the

risks involved in the old vac
cination."
The newer and more purified
vaccine that Prober and his staff
are testing has so far proven
effective in the U.S. for more
than 500 children age two
months and older who received
the new vaccine.
"No serious problems occured
in the recent tests," Prober said.
"The children have had fewer
minor symptomatic reactions
than children who had previ
ously received the old vaccine."
