Meese nominee withdraws name
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin
Meese Ill's second choice for deputy attorney
general, John Shepherd, formally withdrew
his name from consideration yesterday on the
grounds that he was unprepared for the pres
sures he encountered, a move that Meese im
mediately blamed on "intense media atten
tion."
Sources in the Justice Department said Mon
day that Shepherd, who heads the Hoover
Institution's Board of Overseers, would with
draw from the nomination this week.
Shepherd's withdrawal was disclosed at an
extraordinary Senate Appropriations subcom
mittee hearing at which Meese's ethical judg
ment was repeatedly questioned.
Nevertheless, Meese insisted that "even an
unduly sensitive" person would not have
spotted potential hazards in the actions he
took that have led to an independent counsel's
investigation of him.
Under questioning by Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., — who at one point noted "God save
us from our friends" — Meese refused to
criticize his longtime friend E. Robert Wallach,
who is under federal indictment and is at the
center of most incidents for which Meese is
being investigated.
Senate panel overhauls welfare
WASHINGTON - The Senate Finance
Committee, traditional graveyard of welfare
overhaul proposals, yesterday approved a dra
matic restructuring of the nation's welfare
system, stressing education and training for
welfare mothers to help them get jobs. The
vote was 17 to 3.
The House passed its welfare measure Dec.
16 by a 36-vote margin, and Finance Com
mittee Chair Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who
tailored compromises to allay Republican
suspicions and ease the bill through the panel,
said he will seek rapid floor action in the hope
that the bill can "become law in 1988," despite
White House veto threats.
In addition to the education and training
provisions, the bill would beef up laws com
pelling parents who are absent from the home
to support their children. Most notably, it
would require in many cases that employers
automatically deduct legally due child-support
payments from the paycheck of such a parent,
even if not in arrears.
"We are bringing a generation of American
women back into the mainstream of American
life. ... We've been fighting and struggling for
this for a quarter century," said a jubilant
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the
bill's chief sponsor.
Court approves additional taxes
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
sending a shock wave through communities
of investors and state and local officials, over
turned a century-old precedent yesterday and
declared that Congress may tax income from
municipal bonds.
But congressional leaders quickly said that
they had no plans to impose federal taxes on
bonds issued by state and local governments.
House Ways and Means Committee Chair
Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., insisting that
Congress has presumed for 20 years that it
had the power to tax municipal bond income,
said that the ruling would neither "prompt
nor deter future congressional action."
Nevertheless, the Supreme Court's 7-1
ruling called into question the long tradition
of allowing state and local agencies to use
tax-free bonds to finance roads, hospitals,
schools and the other capital projects.
States and municipalities have long under
stood that the 10th Amendment, which
reserves to the states and the people "the
powers not delegated to the United States by
the Constitution," made income from their
bonds off limits to federal taxation. The Su
preme Court confirmed that view in 1895 by
ruling that the federal government may not
intrude on the state's power to issue tax-free
bonds.
The high court changed that rule yesterday.
"States must find their protection for con
gressional regulation through the national po
litical process, not through judicially defined
spheres of unregulable state activity," said
Justice William Brennan Jr. for the court.
Boesky wants out of jail early
Ivan Boesky, the former stock speculator
who four weeks ago began serving a three-year
sentence at a minimum security prison in
southern California, now wants to get out of
jail early.
In a memo to the sentencing judge request
ing a reduction in Boesky's sentence, Boesky's
lawyers cited his continuing cooperation,
threats on his life and the much lower sen
tences recently given to other white-collar
criminals. But, in a twist, the lawyers also
asked U.S. District Judge Morris Lasker to
put off a decision for about six months.
By October, they said, the "extraordinary
extent and value" of Boesky's help to the
government will be clear as pending cases
against Wall Street executives "mature into
criminal and civil charges."
The government's massive probe of Wall
Street has spanned more than a year and half,
leading some legal experts to wonder whether
it is faltering. But, though the memo indicates
that much of the investigation will be com
pleted by October, Leon Silverman, a Boesky
attorney, insisted that "there is no magic to
the date. . .. We put down a date we thought
was reasonable."
