# Hijackers on the run
## Algerian authorities keep quiet about deal 
### 
ALGIERS â€” Algerian authorities drew
a veil of secrecy around the whereabouts
of the hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner who
surrendered early yesterday after freeing
their remaining hostages at the Algiers
airport.
However, it was clear from information
provided by a number of sources that a
secret deal had been arranged to give the
hijackers safe passage out of Algeria, and
some reports said they had already left.
Kuwaiti sources said that the hijackers,
who are now said to have numbered as
many as nine, were expected to be flown
either to Beirut or Tehran as part of the
deal under which they agreed to free their
31 hostages.
Looking haggard and exhausted, the
hostages filed off the Kuwait Airways
jumbo jet shortly after dawn yesterday, 16
days after their homeward-bound flight
from Bangkok turned into an odyssey of
terror that took them to Iran, Cyprus and
finally Algeria.
"We never knew where we were," said
Mubarak Khaled, a 33-year-old Kuwaiti
meteorologist, who told reporters that the
hijackers kept the window shades of the
plane drawn throughout the ordeal. "We
could only guess where we were by the
food" sent on board at the various
stopovers, he added.
The plane's purser, Abdel Monem Mah
moud, said after his release that the worst
time was "when they put a gun to the
head of one of the passengers. Their eyes
behind their masks were sharp and expres
sionless, like those of a shark."
Algerian officials refused to discuss the

location of the hijackers, who are believed
to be Shia Moslem militants closely affili
ated with Iran. However, diplomats noted
that Algeria was not expected to want the
terrorists to remain on its soil any longer
than necessary.
Speculation that they may have already
left was fueled when an Algerian Air Force
transport plane was seen taking off from
Houari Boumedienne Airport shortly after
the terrorists were believed to have
debarked from the plane, getting into
several waiting cars hidden from reporters
on the far side of the aircraft.
Algerian officials refused to comment on
either the transport plane's occupants or
its destination, but other Algerian sources
said it was "extremely unusual" for a mil
itary airplane to be using Algiers' civilian
airport.
In Helsinki, Finland, Secretary of State
George Shultz complained that the hijack
ers appear to be going free, even though
they murdered two hostages. He added that
he did not intend to "second-guess" the
Algerian negotiator over the outcome.
It was still not clear why the hijackers
agreed to surrender on terms that appeared
to fall far short of their demand that
Kuwait release 17 Shia Moslem militants
convicted of bomb attacks on the U.S. and
French embassies in Kuwait in 1983.
However, the breakthrough in the nego
tiations that Algerian mediators have been
conducting ever since the plane landed here
last Wednesday appeared to come during
the night, when the negotiators secretly
visited the plane.
