# Soviet No. 2 man may be on his way out

MOSCOW — Speculation is growing
here in the Soviet capital that Yegor
Ligachev, the ruling Politburo's
second-ranking figure, could be in dan
ger of losing much of his power fol
lowing a recent ideological battle with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
Although it could not be confirmed
by government or Communist Party
officials, knowledgeable Soviets and
western diplomats here say that Liga
chev, who opposes many of Gorba
chev's plans for radical reform, may
soon be "promoted" to the largely
ceremonial post of president, now held
by former foreign minister Andrei
Gromyko.
In this scenario, the sources said,
Gromyko, 79, would retire. Such
rumors about the top leadership in
tensified this month after Ligachev re
portedly engineered the publication
March 13 of an anti-reform article in
the newspaper Sovyetskaya Rossiya.

Two weeks ago that article was an
swered in devastating fashion in the
official Communist Party daily Pravda
with an editorial that reportedly was
approved by Gorbachev and was the
work of high party officials, including
the Politburo's propaganda chief, Al
exander Yakovlev.
Despite a transformed atmosphere
under Gorbachev in which Soviet of
ficials talk more freely with jour
nalists, accounts of possible shifts in
the leadership are still difficult to con
firm. Politburo members keep their
own differences well concealed.
But ever since Yakovlev joined the
Politburo last year, there has been
speculation that he and Ligachev were
at odds over critical ideological ques
tions, including the pace and breadth
of reform.
The rivalry may well be intensifying
since reports are now widespread
among Soviet officials that many of

Gorbachev's reforms do not seem to
be working and that resistance to them
is widespread among bureaucrats
around the country who fear the im
pact on their own positions.
Gorbachev appointed both men to
the Politburo, yet he is considered
much closer, ideologically and person
ally, to Yakovlev.
It is widely believed by Soviet intel
lectuals that Yakovlev, who spent
many years as a student and ambas
sador in the West, has superior train
ing as an ideologist, while Ligachev is
seen as an incorruptible, if unimagi
native, party politician. If Ligachev is
moved to the presidency, the man he
would replace would no doubt find the
scenario quite familiar.
Gromyko, an ex-ambassador to
Washington who began his career with
the Foreign Ministry during the era
of Joseph Stalin, was "promoted" to
his present job when Gorbachev came

to office three years ago and appointed
younger, more progressive Eduard
Shevardnadze, to handle foreign af
fairs.
Analysts said they would consider
it an important development if Yakov
lev were asked to deliver the important
keynote speech to the 300-member
Central Committee Friday on the oc
casion of Lenin's birthday. "That
would show his status has shot way
up," a diplomat said.
Ever since Gorbachev took power in
1985, Ligachev has been the guardian
of a more moderate approach to
change, one resembling that of his
mentor, the late leader Yuri Andropov.
While Gorbachev has spoken out for
radical change in nearly every aspect
of Soviet life, Ligachev has favored
moderate reform of the economy and
adopted a more cautious approach to
democratization.
