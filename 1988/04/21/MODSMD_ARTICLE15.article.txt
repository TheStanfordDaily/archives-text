# Prototype AIDS vaccine shows promise
## 
### 
In a major advance, a French scien
tist who has repeatedly injected him
self with a prototype AIDS vaccine has
developed what appears to be the
strongest immunity yet achieved in
the search for the AIDS vaccine, it
was reported today.
The development does not prove
that the researcher, Dr. Daniel Zagury,
a professor of immunology at the
Pierre and Marie Curie University in
Paris, is actually protected against the
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome virus, because he has never
been exposed to it.
Nevertheless, the researchers said,
"Our results show for the first time
that an immune state against the
(human immunodeficiency virus) can
be obtained in man."
The report by Zagury and 16 co
authors is being published in Nature,
a British scientific journal. Among the

co-authors is Dr. Robert Gallo, the
U.S. National Cancer Institute re
searcher who is a co-discoverer of the
AIDS virus.
So far, the researchers said that
Zagury has suffered no ill effects from
the series of four self-injections that
began in November 1986 and contin
ued through the fall of 1987. The tests
also show that he developed a strong
immune response, which has persisted
for more than a year, against divergent
strains of the AIDS virus.
But the report cautions that the im
munization procedures used on Zagury
are too cumbersome to be tested on
large numbers of people. In addition,
crucial experiments to see if the test
vaccine protects exposed chimpanzees
against AIDS virus infection have yet
to be completed. A vaccine suitable for
widespread human use may not be

produced for many years, if ever.
"We have overcome some pitfalls on
the route toward a vaccine," Zagury
said in a telephone interview. "We by
no means have yet a vaccine."
He added: "The protective effects of
a candidate vaccine can only be tested
in large scale clinical trials (involving
individuals at high risk of AIDS virus
infection). What remains to be done
is to find a preparation that mimics
the same immune reaction as the
prototype and that can be adminis
tered to thousands of people." This
would involve drastically simplifying
the approach he has tested on himself.
Zagury's report appears to go far
beyond the accomplishments to date
of the two American groups also con
ducting preliminary AIDS vaccine tri
als in humans, at the National Insti
tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

in Bethesda, Md. and the University
of Washington School of Medicine in
Seattle. And despite his image as a
mavehck figure, it places his labora
tory at the forefront of mainstream
AIDS research.
"He is the only researcher who has
this kind of data in man at this point,"
said Dani Bolognesi, a professor of
surgery at Duke University who is col
laborating with Gallo on AIDS vaccine
research.
Dr. Bernard Moss of the National
Institutes of Health said that Zagury
has "shown that you get the expected
types of immunity for a vaccine. The
only thing that hasn't been shown is
that it protects (against the AIDS
virus)." Moss provided the viral ma
terials that Zagury has used in his
research.
