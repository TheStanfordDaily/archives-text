# Court rules alcoholics may be denied benefits
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Su
preme Court, ignoring arguments
that alcoholism is a disease re
quiring special treatment rather
thdn a voluntary condition, ruled
yesterday that the government
may routinely exclude alcoholics
from some of its benefit programs.
On a 4-3 vote, the justices up
held a Veterans Administration
rule classifying alcoholism as
"willful misconduct" disqualifying
veterans from education benefits
and disability payments.
In a narrowly worded opinion,
the justices tried to sidestep the
debate over whether alcoholism
is a disease with physical and pos
sbily genetic origins. "It is not
our role to resolve this medical
issue on which authorities remain
sharply divided," wrote Justice
Byron White for the court.
Instead, White concluded that
the VA's policy did not conflict
with a federal law prohibiting dis
crimination against handicapped
persons, including alcoholics.
About 10 million Americans are
alcoholics, and the American Med
ical Association told the court that

for nearly 30 years, "there has
been a consensus in the medical
profession . . . that such pat
hological use of alcohol is a dis
ease."
But other organizations, includ
ing Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, urged the court not to
absolve drunks of responsibility
for their actions.
Lawyers representing veterans
said that the court's ruling, while
narrowly focused, could lead other
federal agencies to deny special
treatment to alcoholics.
In the case at issue, the court
refused to require the VA to pro
vide special education benefits to
former alcoholics. And as White
pointed out in a footnote, the de
cision also shelters the VA from
the potentially staggering cost of
awarding disability benefits to al
coholic veterans.
But it has no impact on the
huge VA hospital system, which
was described in court records as
the largest treatment facility for
persons suffering from al
coholism.
