# House OKs amnesty bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The House yester
day narrowly approved a bill to extend
by almost seven months the May 4 dead
line for illegal aliens to apply for am
nesty, but the legislation still faces major
obstacles in the Senate and the threat
of a presidential veto.
The measure, passed by a vote of 213-
201, kept alive the hopes of immigration
rights groups for additional time to en
courage more illegal aliens to apply for
legal permission to reside in the United
States.
Less than 1.2 million persons have
applied for amnesty so far under the
one-year program, more than a million
short of some early projections of the
expected turnout. The House bill would
extend the application period to Nov. 30.
Some advocates acknowledged that it
will be difficult to persuade the Senate
to follow suit in view of the continued
opposition by Senate Republican Whip
Alan Simpson of Wyoming, a key spon
sor of last year's massive immigration
reform legislation.
"It looks grim in the Senate," said
one lobbyist pushing for the extension.
"It's such an emotional issue."
But Charles Kamasaki, spokesman for
the National Council of La Raza, a
Latino organization in the forefront of
the extension drive, said that he was

encouraged by the outcome in the
House.
"A number of people said this (victory)
was politically impossible," he said after
the vote. "I am reasonably confident the
Senate will go along with the House."
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., act
ing chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and an outspoken supporter
of the extension, said that he plans to
bypass committee consideration of the
House-approved bill in hopes of getting
immediate Senate action, an aide said.
The House also defied White House
warnings that President Reagan would
veto legislation providing additional time
for the aliens who are eligible for legal
status — those who were in this country
illegally before 1982.
In the meantime, organizations sup
porting the extension urged aliens who
qualify for amnesty to apply before the
current May 4 deadline to make sure
their cases would be considered if the
extension effort fails.
Rep. Peter Rodino, D-N.J., chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, es
timated that another 2 million persons
might "come out of the shadows" and
apply for legal status if the deadline for
applications was extended until the fall.
