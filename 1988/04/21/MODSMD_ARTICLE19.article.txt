## An unfair honor 
### 
STOP discriminating against
honors candidates.
Although Stanford actively
pitches honors work to its under
graduates, the University admin
istration nevertheless pursues a
ludicrous housing policy that traps
honors students in a financial
Catch-22.
Many seniors doing honors try
to finish all of their classes before
spring quarter so that they can
focus on their theses.
But even though they're not
taking classes, University rules re
quire that they each pay a $950
"auditing fee" for "use of Univer
sity resources," which includes li
braries and academic advisers. But
typically, only on-campus students
get charged.
Honors students who live off
campus save $950 — simply be
cause the University has no way
of knowing about them. Students
who live on campus, however, are
out of luck. If they don't pay the
auditing fee, they lose their
housing.
Another inequity is that on
campus seniors who graduate after
winter quarter can remain in Uni
versity housing and enjoy these
services free of charge as a
"courtesy to Stanford alumni," ac
cording to Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney.
The policy, therefore, encour
ages students to take their degrees
early, skipping honors work and
saving $950.
And many students who cannot
afford this fee avoid paying it by

lying about the fact that they are
doing honors work.
One student made a good point
in a recent letter to Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies Thomas
Wasow: "If students . . . become
academically aggressive, should
they expect to pay for it?"
The answer should be: "No."
A University committee of un
dergraduate deans deserves praise
for recognizing that the policy
must be reviewed. But its investi
gation must be swift and compre
hensive to correct injustices that
have already affected students this
spring.
This quarter at least two stu
dents were forced out of University
housing because they could not af
ford to pay the fee. The struggle
to find off-campus housing, begin
cooking meals and find transpor
tation to and from campus without
a car has thrown a stubborn
wrench into each of these students'
efforts to complete their work.
If the University truly values
honors work, it should realize that
many students drop their honors
theses mid-course for good
reasons: Writing a thesis demands
an exceptional time commitment.
Instead of thwarting the efforts
of students who attempt it, Stan
ford should provide support.
Instead of fueling impressions
that Stanford is not intellectually
rigorous, the University should
prove its critics wrong by encour
aging independent study — not de
feating it.
