# CIR makes 2 investment exceptions
## 'Can't vote in conscience' to oust firms from S. Africa 
### Erik Johnson 
In a cautious departure from its normally pro
disinvestment position, Stanford's Committee on
Investment Responsibilty has urged the Board of
Trustees to abstain from voting in two shareholder
resolutions requesting companies to sever all eco
nomic ties in South Africa.
The trustees' Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility is expected to decide today whether
the University will vote for Merck Co. and General
Electric Co. shareholder resolutions urging these
companies to cut their economic ties with companies
that still sell and use their products in South Africa.
The CIR, a 12-member advisory group of students,
faculty and alumni, also recommended that the
SCIR vote "yes" on Whirlpool and Westinghouse
Electric shareholder resolutions asking for disin
vestment from South Africa.
CIR co-Chair Frederick Hillier predicted that the
SCIR will approve the CIR recommendations.
The University owns $5.5 million of General
Electric stock, $3.6 of Merck stock, $4.6 of West
inghouse stock and $2 million of Whirlpool stock,
representing a total 9 percent of University holdings
in companies with ties to South Africa.
The ClR's recommendation that the University
abstain from voting in disinvestment resolutions at
General Electric and Merck are exceptions to a
policy that has otherwise consistently advised the
University to encourage disinvestment by companies
in which it owns stock.
According to Hillier, the CIR made the two ex-
ceptions because the CIR believes
disinvestment by Merck and Gen
eral Electric would hurt non
whites in South Africa.
The CIR judged that Merck may
be licensing companies in South
Africa to sell "unique, life-saving
drugs" that are the "sole effective
treatments" for potentially deadly
diseases, the CIR said in a state
ment last Thursday.
CIR co-Chair Kirk Hanson said
the CIR "couldn't vote in con
science" to force Merck to sever
a tie that might provide life-saving

products. In General Electric's
case, the CIR found that NBC
television, a subsidiary of General
Electric, could be a strong force
against apartheid, Hanson said.
"Just as the South African gov
ernment is fighting the news, "
Hanson said, "we found that sup
porting the news will maintain
pressure on the South Africans
to end apartheid."
The ClR's decision to urge
abstention in the General Electric
resolution contradicts a Jan. 29
CIR recommendation that the
trustees adopt a blanket policy of
disinvestment toward all compan
ies with remaining economic in
terests in South Africa.

The SCIR rejected the blanket
policy.
The CIR resolution would have
exempted Merck because that
company provides potentially life
saving products to South Africa.
The CIR resolution would have
made no exception for news agen
cies, such as NBC.
"The CIR still feels it is impor
tant to withdraw from South
Africa as completely as possible,"
Hillier said. "In general, there are
no exceptions, unless life-saving
products are involved. But there
are circumstances in which we
have to consider whether a rec
ommendation of complete disin
vestment is wise," he said.
Disinvestment is a policy in

which a company severs all eco
nomic ties with any businesses in
South Africa. Divestment is a
policy in which an institution,
such as a university, sells all its
holdings in a company that
remains in South Africa.
"We don't view (abstaining
from the vote) as a weakening of
our position against apartheid,"
Hillier said. "The most important
thing is what we have to say to
management."
"We try to elicit information
from [the companies] to deter
mine what the best action for us
is," Hillier said. "Sometimes, dis
investment is not the best policy
for the non-whites of the coun
try."
