## Use War Powers Act 
### 
THERE HAS been suprisingly little
criticism of the Reagan adminis
tration's decision to take retali
atory actions against Iran. It is unfortu
nate that in spite of the past few months
of increasing hostilities and the admin
istration's decision to engage in a military
attack on Iranian oil rigs and naval ves
sels, there has been virtually no insis
tence on Capitol Hill that the President
stop avoiding the controversial War
Powers Act of 1973.
Allowing U.S. troops to remain in the
Gulf without invoking the War Powers
Act is both a risky and unwise situation
for the United States. By summoning
and informing congressional leaders at
the White House in advance of the at
tacks, the President succeeded in curbing
much of the criticisms that would have
been directed at his decision. But avoiding
the complaints of the legislature does not
ensure a trouble-free U.S. presence in
the Gulf.
Reagan, still licking his wounds from
the scars of the Iran-Contra scandal,
would like to end his presidential term
without having a major conflict in the
Gulf associated with his administration.
But avoiding the invocation of the War
Powers Act to keep the American public
complacent and the Republican party
favored is an action that has conse
quences beyond keeping of the peace
within the legions of our government and
nation.
To many observers, it is clear that
conditions for the act are ripe, if not

overdue. In its most important aspect,
the War Powers Act declares that the
president "report to Congress when U.S.
troops are introduced into hostilities or
into situations where imminent involve
ment in hostilities is clearly indicated."
There is no doubt in my mind that
the U.S. troops abroad have been ex
posed, in fact repeatedly exposed, to hos
tilities. The damage to the U.S. Navy
frigate Samuel Roberts, the mining of
the Gulf, the United States' attack on
Iranian oil drilling platforms, the recent
crippling or sinking of six Iranian vessels
and the multiple casualties and injuries
on all sides — all of these events plainly
indicate that there are hostilities in the
Gulf. They demonstrate that American
troops are being exposed to dangers at
the whims of the administration.
Without the consent of Congress, with
out the backing and understanding of
the American people, Reagan continues
to employ some sort of invisible plan of
action in an area where it is crucial to
have a highly visible objective.
Reagan claims that any attacks on our
part are retaliatory actions intended to
warn the Iranians that unprovoked at
tacks on flagged American vessels will
not be taken lightly. But such retaliation
reduces the U.S. to the level of the people
it is protesting, and such a policy of "tit
for-tat" will simply lead us to the inev
itable escalation of tension and violence.
We are at a stage now where decisive
action is necessary. If Reagan seeks to
continue U.S. military actions and
retaliations in the Gulf, then he must

invoke the War Powers Act. It is simply
too easy for fighting and retaliation to
escalate into a full scale war if the Pres
ident has no formally declared policy to
adhere to.
Already, according to The New York
Times, one Western diplomat character
ized reactions at the Pentagon and State
Department as "absolute surprise and
total disarray" over the speed and force
of Iran's response to the American attack.
Because there is no way to predict Iran's
responses with what Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci calls "Western logic", it
is especially compelling that the president
abandon his quarrels with the con
stitutionality of the War Powers Act and
alert the nation and the world to his
intentions.
If Reagan proceeds to act in a
retaliatory manner without making his
intentions known, and if the Iranians
continue to respond with violence to our
retaliations, then what was once a matter
of protecting oil resources and interna
tional waters will progress into a matter
of violence and war.
