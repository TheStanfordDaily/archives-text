## Prevent atrocities by recalling Armenian genocide 
### 
ARMENIANS all over the world
observe April 24 as a day of
remembrance for the 1.5 million
Armenian men, women and children
slaughtered at the hands of the Young
Turk government. On that day in
1915, the "final solution" of the Ar
menian case began: the extermination
of the Armenian race living in the
Ottoman empire, the seizing of their
homes and property, the merciless
driving of any survivor into the Syrian
deserts and an attempt to make the
world forget that the Armenians ever
existed.
The Turks were very thorough in
their grisly task. The adult males were
spared the agony of inhumane
marches. They were separated from

their families and immediately killed
with rifle fire, bayonets and axes. The
women and children were forced to
march in the scorching heat into the
barren deserts. All along the way, the
Turks treated them like animals.
Deprived of food, water and clothing,
the very young and very old did not
survive long.
To make the historical fact of the
Armenian genocide a debatable issue is
to give credence to its continued denial
by the Turkish government. Eyewit
ness accounts by such Western states
men as Henry Morgenthau, U.S. am
bassador to Turkey, as well as daily
accounts of the death and destruction
in The New York Times, failed to

bring any action to halt the killings.
Despite Woodrow Wilson's pleas,
isolationist sentiment in the United
States was too high.
As the philosopher Santyana said,
"those who do not remember the past
are condemned to relive it." Thirty
years after the Armenian genocide, the
world was shocked to learn of the Nazi
death camp horrors. Hitler felt he
could get away with his attempt to
eliminate the Jews. "After all," he said
in 1939, "who remembers the exter
mination of the Armenians?" Thirty
years later, in 1975, a reign of terror
began in Cambodia that resulted in the
elimination of one-fourth of the Cam
bodian people.

We remain concerned about the
Armenian genocide not only because it
attempted to eradicate our ancestors,
but because of the broad historical
ramifications of its continued denial.
There was no Nuremburg for the
Turks in 1923, when the killings fi
nally subsided, and the current
Turkish government still denies that
the genocide ever occurred.
We want to see the Turkish crime
against humanity recognized by all the
people of the world. Even though 70
years have passed, recognition of the
tragedy is important for all humanity.
