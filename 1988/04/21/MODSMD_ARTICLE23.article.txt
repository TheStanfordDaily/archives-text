# Dollie auditions show Band's sexism
## 
### 
In her April 14 letter, Heather
McClure ties Fishbone's comments and
the discouraging reaction of the Stan
ford crowd to "a deep-rooted lack of
respect for women" which is "but one
manifestation of sexist attitudes that
harm both women and men." Another
fine example is The Band's reaction
(April 7) to the almost too-obvious
charge by R. Suzanne Swann that the
name and current position of the
Dollies is degrading to women (April
5). The Band responded not by
answering the charge in any meaning
ful fashion but instead by trivializing
the point, ridiculing it and mocking
Swann's "concern".
This brings up two points. First,
there is a common tendency for both
men and women to dismiss objections
to sexist practices as the nitpicking
criticisms of oversensitive, overzealous
feminists.

However, it needs to be recognized
that sexism is a pervasive, systematic
and, given our cultural upbringing,
frequently a subtle phenomenon. As
such, the many examples of sexism in
our lives should be pointed out so we
may make conscious decisions as to
what we should support or change
based on our personal beliefs.
The second and perhaps more imme
diate point is the example provided by
The Band. They dismissed charges of
sexism as trivial instead of taking
them seriously and examining their
organization. A cursory self
examination immediately opens a nasty
can of worms — the Dollie selection
process.
Here's how it works. After a first
round of cuts, 20 to 30 hopefuls strut
their stuff at the Dollie tryouts. Here
they dance to Band tunes in front of a
beer-guzzling audience of mostly male
Band members shouting such tried and
true expressions as "Show us your
tits!**
From this display, roughly 12 lovely
ladies are selected. These go to a meet-

The-Band party, the purpose of which
is to allow the selection of the five
women who, having shown their danc
ing abilities, are most compatible with
The Band's personality. Thus the
women selected are able to easily
respond with humor and good fun to
the nearly constant barrage of "show
us your tits" that will follow in spring
quarter as the new Dollies are broken
in. They have to be "good sports."
Thus, here at Stanford we have an
example of ritualized objectification and
sexual degradation of women by a
highly public organization entirely
funded by the Stanford student body.
If The Band staff would have taken
the time used to compose its droll
witticisms to recognize and address
Swann's objections, perhaps they would
have struck upon some constructive
changes, perhaps they would have
talked to female Band members (the
Band staff is traditionally male, espe
cially in the highest positions). They
would have found that a fair number
of the women are somewhat bothered
by the Dollie selection process.

My suggestion: Simply make the
Dollies equivalent to any other section
in The Band. New Dollies would be
selected only by the current Dollies,
just as a new clar/pic is selected by the
clar/pic section leader. It is certainly
not necessary to make the prospectives
dance for the pleasures of The Band.
I can't help but think that this
would bring about several improve
ments. The Dollies and the women in
The Band could feel more comfortable
as members of The Band (indeed it is
difficult to understand how the highly
educated, intelligent women at Stan
ford can put up with the disgusting
Dollie ritual), and the Band could be
come less of a sexist, "fratish" organi
zation and more of an organization
dedicated to offending conservatives,
parodying people who seriously wear
polyester, making a mockery of the
modern political situation and of
course playing some of the best rock
'n' roll ever written.
