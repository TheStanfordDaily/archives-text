Allan Bloom's controversial
new book, "The Closing of the
American Mind" has largely
provoked two types of reaction.
Some have called it shockingly
true; others have called it out
rageously false. I find it neither.
Much of what Bloom says about
the current state of American
youth and education is true, and
most of that truth (and most of
the book) is obviously and banally
true.
Though most liberals I know
have denounced the book, few of
them would rise with much en
thusiasm to defend American col
lege students or American under
graduate education from Bloom's
charge that what is lacking is
gravity of thought and commit
ment. Indeed, as many reviewers
have already noted, Bloom's cul
tural critique of the shallow,
sumptuary individualism of
American youth is perfectly con
sistent with standard sociological
analysis (i.e., David Riesman) or
somewhat dated left-wing
critiques (e.g., Paul Goodman).
Reviewers have also noted, of
course, that the book is substan
tially derivative of the thought of
Leo Strauss and others of the
Chicago Great Books circle. When
I first skimmed the book, I also
found it to be amazingly reminis
cent of one particular writer —
Philip Rieff. In the late 1960s and
early 1970s, many academics be
came intrigued by, and had their
consciences pricked by, the
writings of Rieff, the notable Uni
versity of Pennsylvania sociologist
and scholar of Freud and Weber.
Rieff s great book, "The Triumph
of the Therapeutic," was a fasci
nating historical taxonomy of
Western human types, ranging
from the "political" man of

Greece, to the "religious" man of
the Middle Ages, to the "eco
nomic" man of the Renaissance
and Enlightenment, to the
modern "psychological" man.
This latter type, the focus of
Rieff s work, is the inner-directed
self-explorer whose belief in the
necessity of being well rather than
doing good seemed to inevitably
degenerate into the type of the
corrupt, groundless sensualist in
capable of bond, authority, belief
or fealty. Rieff read Freud to be
as much lamenting as celebrating
the release of psychological man
from the superego. Rieff virtually
argued for the renaissance of
totem and taboo to rehabilitate
Western humanity. Rieffs book,
a kind of antidote to Norman
Brown's "Life Against Death,"
was followed by a short, brilliantly
acerbic polemic called "Fellow
Teachers," in which he posed an
ominous warning to the academic
priesthood that its duty was to
uphold moral and intellectual au
thority in the face of the decom
pensation of the therapeutic type.
This was all great stuff 15 years
ago (not to suggest that at least
the first Rieff book does not have
great lasting value). However, I
find little in Bloom that was not
said, and often said better, in
Rieff. So I am curious why Bloom
wrote this book now. Rieff was
writing in relatively immediate re
action to his own horror at the
actions of a barbarian left attack
ing the authority of his podium
at the University of Pennsylvania.
To some extent, Bloom is
demonstrating the same reaction.
He was clearly traumatized by the
student revolts at Cornell, where
he was teaching in 1967, so
traumatized that in (perhaps
legitimately) attacking the cowar
dice of the Cornell administration,
he seems incapable of restraining
himself from gratuitous racial
denunciations of the student
enemy. But that was a long time
ago, so Bloom's message is a very
delayed reaction.
If we look at the time-lag from
Bloom's angle, perhaps he feels

that the prophecies of early
oracles like Rieff needed to be
tested over time, and that they
have been especially well borne
out by the very subtlety with
which barbarian forces have
manifested themselves: American
youth do not storm, burn or rebel
anymore. Indeed, Bloom may be
saying, they have demonstrated
the shallowness of their former
protestations of political belief by
turning their spiritual energy into
narcissistic economic and sensual
fulfillment, and their radical egal
itarian beliefs into a tame, mind
less cultural relativism.
The real problems with the
book, for me at least, tend to in
volve matters of tone and expla
nation, not description and diag
nosis. The tone problem is pretty
self-evident, and ultimately less
important. At his worst, Bloom
writes in a mode of self
congratulatory revelation, com
bined with a rather unpleasant
veneer of superiority. All too of
ten, Bloom sounds more like
William F. Buckley or James Kil
patrick than like a philosopher.
He purports to suffer the
awesome, weighty burdens of the
Olympian mind whose grim duty
it is to uphold civilization, and
whose fastidious sensitivities can
barely tolerate the intellectual
degeneration he is forced by his
position to encounter.
At his not-so-worst, Bloom
writes in the sincerely plantive
tone of the thoughtful mind that
simply cannot accept modernism,
that strives to identify some
source of absolute value, some
revelation. Put another way,
Bloom's is essentially a religious
psyche, and it does not fare well
in an agnostic or secular world.
This has been a problem for many
of the great modernist writers,
who sought their grounding in
some well-established source like
Anglo-Catholicism (Eliot) or
mystical mythic nationalism
(Yeats), both of which were vul
nerable to dissolving into simple
fascism (Pound). Bloom is left to
find his own grounding in the less

dangerous but ultimately less sat
isfying (because more abstracted)
world of the Great Books. Bloom
needs to be able to read these as
revelation, but he runs entirely
out of steam at the end of the
book when he ought to be clari
fying how we can use the Great
Books to rehabilitate American
education.
Since Bloom's great enemies
are relativism, interpretation, his
torical dialectics and deconstruc
tion, he fears that merely ensur
ing that the Great Books are
taught will not do, because these
modernist intellectual maneuvers
will just grind up and distort the
Great Books as they do all else.
So he is left, somewhat haplessly,
with the notion that we must let
the great texts "dictate what the
questions are and the method of
approaching them — not forcing
them into categories we make up,
not treating them as historical
products, but trying to read them
as their authors wished them to
be read."
One can concede that much
deconstructionist theory is
pretentious Gallic babble, and
that it is often mindless and
reductionist to assert that all texts
are "historical products," and yet
still feel embarrassed at a state
ment like this. At the very least,
exposure to modernist critical the
ory should make one uncomfort
able with the naivete of "letting
the authors tell us how their
books are to be read," especially
when this statement comes from
someone who is quite clear that
he is reading them corectly and
others are not.
Another problem is that as I
read Bloom, even were I to agree
that we have seen a disastrous
decay in the young American in
tellect, I don't learn why this dis
aster happened. Bloom essentially
just suggests that the American
professoriate, having been en
riched by Good German ideas in
the '40s and '50s, switched to Bad
German ideas and lost its nerve
in 1967. (This was Munich on the
