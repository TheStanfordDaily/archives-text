# ... draws fire from Stanford student, profs
## Bloom displays a closed mind 
### Barry Katz 
In an intemperate blast against
"The Closing of the American
Mind," I recently suggested that
the most interesting thing about
Bloom's book is the fact that the
author has made about a million
dollars off it. Upon further reflec
tion, I find myself even more per
plexed by this paradox than
before: Across the nation the
Swinish Multitude has flocked to
its local bookstores to flagellate
itself with the rhetoric of this
latter-day Edmund Burke. What
explains the phenomenal success
of this war cry parading as phi
losophy? What accounts for its
deep resonance within the same
American public for which the au
thor has such boundless con
tempt?
Bloom's thesis is that democ
racy is best served by the un
democratic nurturing of a race of
philosopher-kings who have been
trained to ask the hard questions
thrown up again and again by the
Great Books. Of late, however, in
stages signalled by the dilemmas
of Rousseau, Nietsche, and
Heidegger, a growing portion of
this elect has deserted the com
munity of pure reason to consort
with the unlettered masses on
their own terms. Symptomatic of
this decline is the growing fas
cination of university teachers
with works of popular culture, of
marginal classes, of Third World
authors and of women, all at the
expense of the classics.
This is the betrayal, Bloom
asserts, because the life of the
mind is inherently aristocratic,
aloof, disdainful of the simple
pleasures of the common folk who

sustain it in faculty clubs across
the land. The transcendent, uni
versal truths formulated by
philosophers from Plato onward
should give them enough to keep
busy and there should be no need,
he insists, to "impoverish the
souls of today's students" by
slumming around in history or
anthropology in search of cheap
thrills and intellectual kicks.
Herein lies the relevance of
Bloom — and his private G-man,
Secretary of Education William
Bennett — for the controversy
that recently culminated in that
ominous headline in the San
Francisco Chronicle: "Stanford
Puts an End to Western Culture."
Bloom and Bennett take this
charge literally: By adulterating
or contextualizing the cherished
canon of Great Books, they allege,
we are undermining the moral
core of our very civilization. To
Bloom, who writes in the Natural
Right tradition of his mentor, Leo
Strauss, there is a natural order
to the universe and it is entirely
reflected in that small shelf of
books whose survival testifies to
their absolute truth.
The truth of an idea, our phi
losopher insists, has nothing to
do with its age, its author, or its
social context — a lesson he ex
tracts from a peculiarly Straus
sian interpretation of the Platonic
theory of Ideal Forms. To assert
otherwise, Bloom warns, is to
plant the germs of relativism that
infect today's students.
Those of us who have dared to
tamper with the canon in which
these truths are transmitted have
questioned this claim, however.
Why, we have asked, is it illegit

imate to inquire into the condi
tions of intellectual production
even as we interrogate its prod
ucts? Why is it a closing rather
than an opening of the American
mind to ponder the ways in which
these ideas have been reflected
and refracted in people's lives?
"Seek first for food and shel
ter," the philosopher Hegel in
structs. "The realm of spirit will
follow." If we are to be citizens
as well as students and scholars,
we owe it to ourselves to insist
upon the embeddedness of ideas
in the world that sustains them,
acts upon them, and frequently
betrays them, for that will impart
to us the fullest understanding of
ourselves and of the totality of
the culture of which we are a
part. We redeem our intellectual
heritage only by grasping it in its
full and often contradictory com
plexity.
