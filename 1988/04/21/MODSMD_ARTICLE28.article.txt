# Stereotyping of students unfair
## 
### Mark Weiner 
In Allan Bloom, students face
a critic who is slanderous and
(more importantly) has become a
sort of minor cult figure, and it
is on these two, troubling ac
counts that we are forced to eval
uate Bloom and the phenomenon
that he represents. When we do
so, though, we must be guided by
the consciousness of ourselves as
a generation distinctly and origi
nally contextualized in history.
Also, and surely more important
ly, in our evaluation of Bloom, we
should be guided by honesty and
reflection and not by polemic, for
at least some of what Bloom says
deserves serious consideration.
But although we must take
Bloom seriously, it seems to me
that Bloom simply smears today's
students through what can only
euphemistically be called an un
sympathetic reading of our behav
ior, concerns, and cultural in
heritance. When we as students
read "The Closing of the Ameri
can Mind" this criticism is all too
apparent. We are not the uncon
cerned, selfish, moral and high
cultural illiterates that Bloom un
justly caricatures. Nor are we,
even our associates in the social
sciences, fearful of making value
laden choice. On the contrary,
much contemporary and histori
cal student political involvement
attests to our potential and desire
to identify with the lives of others,
what Charles Junkerman aptly
describes as "the noblest exercise
of the human sensibility."
Bloom is guilty of not giving
students the benefit of the doubt,
and his conclusions seem far more
willed, hostile from the outset,
and "scarred" by the 1960s than
based on true understanding.
Among the many embarrassing
examples to which we might point
is the anecdote in which in
credulously asks stuents if they
are frightened by the possibility
of nuclear war. "The response,"
he writes, "was a universal, some
what embarrassed giggle. They
knew what their daily thoughts
were about, and those thoughts
had hardly anything to do with

public questions. And they also
knew that there are a great many
right-thinking adults who . . .
want to poduce their maimed
souls in evidence against our
politicians' mad pursuit of the
'arms race.' "
This type of misunderstanding
— the failure to perceive and
humanly sympathize with the his
torical and cultural post-war in
heritance into which we are all
conscious of being born — runs
throughout Bloom's book, and its
unhappy influence can be felt in
his discussion of the new left,
feminism, and black protest.
Bloom simply does not concep
tualize politics in cultural terms
and so fails to meaningfully un
derstand any student discontent
that might lead to a cultural (and
thus political) rebellion. Instead,
he damns student consciousness
and even student action with the
far too maligned and misun
derstood concept of "relativism."
And yet it seems to me that
this type of dismissal is too easily
given by Bloom's critics and that,
all faults aside, Bloom's book,
even if only for its lively writing,
can serve as a valuable spring
board for useful discussion and
even ideological clarity. Namely,
we too often encounter Bloom's
incomprehension of our very
peculiar historical and cultural
circumstances and then immedi
ately consider the entirety of
Bloom's analysis equally invalid.
Instead, we should realize that
Bloom's discussion, for instance,
of rock music, has enough in com
mon with other, leftist critiques
of pop culture to require a second,
serious look. And Bloom's nega
tive reaction to particular trends
in humanistic study resonates
with the often theoretically
rarified (and thus politically non
influential) tenor of much other
contemporary criticism.
But the most important aspect
of Bloom's book is that it has
been read (or at least discussed)
so widely and indeed is only a
part of a constellation of works
that includes Hirsch's "Cultural
Literacy" and Jacoby's "The Last
Intellectuals." The reasons for
this popularity, it seems to me,

will be the lasting question that
Bloom's book will leave in its
wake, and in response I can only
answer that "The Closing of the
American Mind" continues a tra
dition of literature in America
that might be said to begin with
"The Education of Henry Adams"
— the literature of the powerless
intellectual in an age of perceived
domestic and international
decline. American intellectuals in
the 20th century have often vis
cerally known the schism between
their thought and the bureau
cratic, increasingly mechanized,
one-dimensional society in which
they exist. Bloom, I suggest, fits
into this tradition quite closely.
Ultimately, then, as students,
our revulsion from Bloom's book
should not cause us to retreat
from discussion of the book as a
cultural phenomenon itself, for its
existence (and public reaction to
its existence) tells us much about
the intellectual waters we must
navigate in order to assume the
public significance that Bloom
desires we should have. Whether
for its ire-raising discussion of
contemporary student culture, its
simply fallacious view of many of
the political and cultural legacies
of the 19605, or its existence as
an historical phenomenon, stu
dents must read and evaluate this
book if only to understand one of
our many and more public critics.
