## Sci-fi microchip: the future of nerve repair 
### Eric Ly Staff writer 
Imagine a future when humans,
eager to learn, will be able to visit
the local book store, buy a micro
chip containing the knowledge of
geometry and install it into their
brains.
This may sound like science fic
tion, and it is . . . for now. But it
is the inspiration for a group of
Stanford researchers currently
working on ways to enable nerve
cells to communicate directly to
electronic machines.

Stanford researchers are devel
oping a silicon chip that will
enable a computer to process in
formation and act directly on the
electrical impulses generated by
nerve cells. The chip will be placed
so that peripheral nerve fibers,
which are capable of regeneration,
can grow through it.
"This is fascinating research be
cause the possibilities with man
machine interfaces are vast," said
Greg Kovacs, a medical student
and a doctoral candidate in elec
trical engineering at Stanford.
Though applications for human
beings are at least a decade away,
the potential of the research being
done may have far-reaching im
plications.
This research may ultimately
help improve the recovery of
patients with peripheral nerve in
juries and perhaps even help re
store functions to paraplegics by

installing microchips in their
arms and legs.
By the simple movement of a
finger, which still has functioning
nerves, the paraplegic could con
ceivably send signals to the chips
in the leg and activate the muscles
there.
In the case of a person with a
severed hand, the chips could also
be used to hook the nerves up
directly to a prosthetic device, like
a bionic or an artificial limb, said
Dr. Joseph Rosen, assistant pro
fessor of surgery at the Medical
Center and chief of plastic and
reconstructive surgery at the Palo
Alto Veterans Administration
Medical Center.
Kovacs, the designer of the chip,
cautioned that such applications
of the nerve chip are still far off
in the future. "I don't want to
raise any false hopes. It may be
a long time before you see any
thing," Kovacs said.
Already researchers have
succeeded in using implanted
microchips, with an intricate grid
of holes, to prove that nerve fibers
would grow through them. When
the nerve is electrically stimulated
at one end, the impulse is re
corded on the other side of the
chip, indicating that the once
damaged nerve is functioning.
This method is likely to be used
in many other areas of neurosci
ence, such as research into mul
tiple sclerosis. Researchers have
also been involved in studying
ways of making nerves grow
faster.
For humans, however, the most
immediate uses for this device in
clude the reconnecting of
damaged nerve fibers of an arm
or leg as a result of traumatic
injury, Kovacs said.
Peripheral nerve injuries,
which occur in approximately 30
percent of all traumatic cases, ac
count for an estimated $10 billion
in costs to the economy each year
in lost work time and medical
care.
The reconnections could restore
sensation and use to limbs

paralyzed by nerve damage, which
has long been one of medicine's
greatest challenges.
Although physicians can reat
tach severed nerves through
microsurgery techniques, the
damaged limb rarely recovers ful
ly. Scar tissue often blocks the
path of the nerve sensations.

During microsurgery, the phy
sicians works under a microscope
to reattach a severed body part,
such as a finger or hand, by del
icately reconnecting tiny blood
vessels and nerves.
Within each nerve there are
2,000 to 3,000 nerve fibers, called
axons, that are so small they sim

ply cannot be manipulated by cur
rently available surgical tools.
The severed axons regenerate
after surgery, but they do not nec
essarily connect to the correct
endings. The result is that the
nerve signals that control feeling
and movement get scrambled, and
the reattached limb often func
tions poorly.
With the thousands of tiny
nerve fibers in each nerve fascicle
— a bundle of functionally related
axons — the current practice of
suturing a severed nerve fiber is
like "taking a 2,000-subscriber
telephone trunk line that has been
cut in half with a chainsaw and
pushing it back together," Kovacs
said.
This is where the chip comes
in. In theory, the microchip will
redirect the impulses it receives
on one end and determine the
correct signals to send to nerve
cells connected to the other end
of the microchip.
The microchip will not directly
reroute the signals of one axon
to another, Kovacs said. Instead,
the nerve chip will recognize the
electrical patterns generated by
thousands of nerves all at once
and, based on an electronic
memory of the myriad of patterns,
the chip will fire the appropriate
pattern of signals to nerve cells
on the other end.
"The chip will be acting like a
foreign language translator — you
give me a complete sentence in
English, and I'll give you the
equivalent in French ... as well
as I can," Kovacs said.
"It's science fiction, but it's
happening now," said Rosen, who,
along with private consultant
Morton Grosser, conceived the
original use for such a chip three
years ago.
A major challenge will be to
design circuitry for the chips that
will hook up to the nerves, ac
cording to the Stanford team.
The scientists will have to con
sider potential problems such as
the effect of the heat produced

by the chip while operating inside
the body and the best method for
sealing the chip in order to guar
antee its reliability, Kovacs said.
"These are issues of biocom
patilibity that doctors doing any
type of implants would face,"
Kovacs said.
Kovacs is expecting the chip to
last 25 years without causing any
adverse reactions to body tissues
or suffering any damage by body
fluids.
"Our technique for protecting
silicon devices is novel and should
meet our design goals," said Chris
Storment, a member of the proj
ect.
Another novel technique the re
searcher team has developed is
the ability to drill thousands of
holes, each the size of one-tenth
the diameter of a human hair,
into a thin silicon chip.
Even the holes made by a
precise laser were too inaccurate
and damaged the smooth silicon
surface, Kovacs said. The re
searchers wanted to make the
holes exactly the right size so that
only one axon could pass through.
They developed a new tech
nique, using a combination of
photographic and chemical meth
ods to enable the drilling of such
holes.
The new techniques have al
lowed the researchers to produce
the silicon chips easily, enabling
them to run many experiments
at once. So far they have only
implanted the chips, which did
not contain any kind of functional
circuitry, in laboratory animals.
The next step in design will in
clude the necessary circuits to
enable researchers to better un
derstand the signals carried
within nerves.
The newly developed chip may
ultimately tell researchers
whether their goals of functional
circuitry within the human body
will be attainable, Kovacs said.

damaged nerve fibers of an arm
or leg as a result of traumatic
injury, Kovacs said.
Peripheral nerve injuries,
which occur in approximately 30
percent of all traumatic cases, ac
count for an estimated $10 billion
in costs to the economy each year
in lost work time and medical
care.
The reconnections could restore
sensation and use to limbs

paralyzed by nerve damage, which
has long been one of medicine's
greatest challenges.
Although physicians can reat
tach severed nerves through
microsurgery techniques, the
damaged limb rarely recovers ful
ly. Scar tissue often blocks the
path of the nerve sensations.

During microsurgery, the phy
sicians works under a microscope
to reattach a severed body part,
such as a finger or hand, by del
icately reconnecting tiny blood
vessels and nerves.
Within each nerve there are
2,000 to 3,000 nerve fibers, called
axons, that are so small they sim

ply cannot be manipulated by cur
rently available surgical tools.
The severed axons regenerate
after surgery, but they do not nec
essarily connect to the correct
endings. The result is that the
nerve signals that control feeling
and movement get scrambled, and
the reattached limb often func
tions poorly.
With the thousands of tiny
nerve fibers in each nerve fascicle
— a bundle of functionally related
axons — the current practice of
suturing a severed nerve fiber is
like "taking a 2,000-subscriber
telephone trunk line that has been
cut in half with a chainsaw and
pushing it back together," Kovacs
said.
This is where the chip comes
in. In theory, the microchip will
redirect the impulses it receives
on one end and determine the
correct signals to send to nerve
cells connected to the other end
of the microchip.
The microchip will not directly
reroute the signals of one axon
to another, Kovacs said. Instead,
the nerve chip will recognize the
electrical patterns generated by
thousands of nerves all at once
and, based on an electronic
memory of the myriad of patterns,
the chip will fire the appropriate
pattern of signals to nerve cells
on the other end.
"The chip will be acting like a
foreign language translator — you
give me a complete sentence in
English, and I'll give you the
equivalent in French ... as well
as I can," Kovacs said.
"It's science fiction, but it's
happening now," said Rosen, who,
along with private consultant
Morton Grosser, conceived the
original use for such a chip three
years ago.
A major challenge will be to
design circuitry for the chips that
will hook up to the nerves, ac
cording to the Stanford team.
The scientists will have to con
sider potential problems such as
the effect of the heat produced

by the chip while operating inside
the body and the best method for
sealing the chip in order to guar
antee its reliability, Kovacs said.
"These are issues of biocom
patilibity that doctors doing any
type of implants would face,"
Kovacs said.
Kovacs is expecting the chip to
last 25 years without causing any
adverse reactions to body tissues
or suffering any damage by body
fluids.
"Our technique for protecting
silicon devices is novel and should
meet our design goals," said Chris
Storment, a member of the proj
ect.
Another novel technique the re
searcher team has developed is
the ability to drill thousands of
holes, each the size of one-tenth
the diameter of a human hair,
into a thin silicon chip.
Even the holes made by a
precise laser were too inaccurate
and damaged the smooth silicon
surface, Kovacs said. The re
searchers wanted to make the
holes exactly the right size so that
only one axon could pass through.
They developed a new tech
nique, using a combination of
photographic and chemical meth
ods to enable the drilling of such
holes.
The new techniques have al
lowed the researchers to produce
the silicon chips easily, enabling
them to run many experiments
at once. So far they have only
implanted the chips, which did
not contain any kind of functional
circuitry, in laboratory animals.
The next step in design will in
clude the necessary circuits to
enable researchers to better un
derstand the signals carried
within nerves.
The newly developed chip may
ultimately tell researchers
whether their goals of functional
circuitry within the human body
will be attainable, Kovacs said.

Greg Kovacs is a member of the research team that is exploring
the possible uses of microchips In nerve medicine.
Imagine a future when humans,
eager to learn, will be able to visit
the local book store, buy a micro
chip containing the knowledge of
geometry and install it into their
brains.
This may sound like science fic
tion, and it is . . . for now. But it
is the inspiration for a group of
Stanford researchers currently
working on ways to enable nerve
cells to communicate directly to
electronic machines.

Stanford researchers are devel
oping a silicon chip that will
enable a computer to process in
formation and act directly on the
electrical impulses generated by
nerve cells. The chip will be placed
so that peripheral nerve fibers,
which are capable of regeneration,
can grow through it.
"This is fascinating research be
cause the possibilities with man
machine interfaces are vast," said
Greg Kovacs, a medical student
and a doctoral candidate in elec
trical engineering at Stanford.
Though applications for human
beings are at least a decade away,
the potential of the research being
done may have far-reaching im
plications.
This research may ultimately
help improve the recovery of
patients with peripheral nerve in
juries and perhaps even help re
store functions to paraplegics by

installing microchips in their
arms and legs.
By the simple movement of a
finger, which still has functioning
nerves, the paraplegic could con
ceivably send signals to the chips
in the leg and activate the muscles
there.
In the case of a person with a
severed hand, the chips could also
be used to hook the nerves up
directly to a prosthetic device, like
a bionic or an artificial limb, said
Dr. Joseph Rosen, assistant pro
fessor of surgery at the Medical
Center and chief of plastic and
reconstructive surgery at the Palo
Alto Veterans Administration
Medical Center.
Kovacs, the designer of the chip,
cautioned that such applications
of the nerve chip are still far off
in the future. "I don't want to
raise any false hopes. It may be
a long time before you see any
thing," Kovacs said.
Already researchers have
succeeded in using implanted
microchips, with an intricate grid
of holes, to prove that nerve fibers
would grow through them. When
the nerve is electrically stimulated
at one end, the impulse is re
corded on the other side of the
chip, indicating that the once
damaged nerve is functioning.
This method is likely to be used
in many other areas of neurosci
ence, such as research into mul
tiple sclerosis. Researchers have
also been involved in studying
ways of making nerves grow
faster.
For humans, however, the most
immediate uses for this device in
clude the reconnecting of
damaged nerve fibers of an arm
or leg as a result of traumatic
injury, Kovacs said.
