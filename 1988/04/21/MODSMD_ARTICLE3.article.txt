Prof. John Manley submitted a
petition to the Faculty Senate ur
ging that the University separate
from Hoover.
Asked to comment on Camp
bell's remarks, Manley responded
that the truth or falsity of the
petition's claims depend on the
facts, not on the number of people
who support him. Manley pointed
out, however, that a previous pe
tition circulated to faculty mem
bers collected 101 signatures.
Hoover's relationship with the
University has "fluctuated" over
the years, Campbell said. "In
spring of 1960, the relations were
just as bad as they are today, with
a small group in the faculty in
full pursuit" of the Hoover direc
tor, he said.
Campbell said that the Univer
sity's recent decision to limit the
growth of his salary may have
been an attempt to force him to

In a rare public appearance last
night, Hoover Institution Director
W. Glenn Campbell dismissed
Hoover critics on the Stanford fac
ulty as "very left-wing and very
undistinguished" and expressed
hope that Stanford and Hoover
can work more closely together.
Although he insisted that a split
"wouldn't hurt Hoover a bit," he
said that he stood ready to
cooperate and felt that by working
together, Hoover and Stanford
could have "a great future," build
ing, for example, an unequaled
international relations school.
"After 28 years here, I've come
to love Stanford University . . .
warts and all," he said.
Campbell said that only a
"small group of professors" op
poses Stanford's ties to Hoover.

leave. The University "mistakenly
thought I might get another job,"
he said.
According to Campbell, the last
time a group tried to get him to
retire, that opposition only
"succeeded in unifying the senior
fellows in support of the lovable,
cuddly director."
Manley said Hoover is currently
conducting a "campaign of vil
lification" toward Stanford. He
said that newspaper stories across
the country negatively publicizing
Stanford's Western Culture
debate were based on material
provided by Hoover.

"It's very hard for people to
face the facts" about Hoover's po
litical endeavors, Manley said.
He disagreed with Campbell's
assertion that Hoover would not
be seriously affected by a split
with Stanford. "The reason many
conservative donors poured
money into Hoover is because it's
valuable to them to have such an
institution with a university like
Stanford," Manley said.
Hoover is linked to the Univer
sity through the Board of Trus
tees' controls on the Hoover en
dowment.


Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn Campbell addressed the Stan
ford College Republicans yesterday. Campbell attacked the proposal
to sever ties between Stanford and Hoover.
