## Women hope to divide and conquer in Ojai Whitlingers, Green favored at Pac-10s 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Although the
Stanford women's
tennis team
clinched the Pa
cific 10 Conference
team title last
weekend, the real

Pac-10 championships will be
decided this weekend in Ojai, be
ginning with today's first- and
second-round singles action.
The Cardinal captured the con
ference crown with a 5-1 victory
over USC last Saturday at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium. But the
league title holds little signifi
cance, because it has no bearing
on seedings at the NCAA team
tournament.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
doesn't get too worked up over
the Pac-10 individual tournament
either. "It's a good chance to get
some matches in and relax," he
said.
However, this weekend's pro
ceedings mean more to the Car
dinal players, because Ojai marks

one of their few chances during
the season to play in an individual
tournament.
In addition, any players strad
dling the NCAA qualifying fence
could sneak into the nationals
with a strong performance in Ojai.
Stanford senior Kay Tittle may
be one such person. Tittle played
in the NCAA singles tournament
last year and has a near-perfect
record this season. But she plays
at No. 5 singles, and it is rare
that five players from the same
team qualify for nationals.
Tittle will get a chance to boost
her credentials this morning, as
she opens against Susan Russo,
Arizona's top singles performer.
The Cardinal was shut out of
the title picture last year at Ojai,
but it has a good chance of re
turning to the winner's circle this
weekend. Stanford has three of
the eight singles seeds: freshman
Tami Whitlinger (No. 2), sopho
more Lisa Green (No. 4) and
freshman Teri Whitlinger (No. 5).
USC's Trisha Laux, who has
beaten Tami Whitlinger twice this
season, is the top seed.

'It's a good chance to
get some matches in
and relax.'

Stanford's other singles entries
are junior Cindy Buchsbaum and
freshman Sandra Birch.
The wake-up call will be an
early one this morning, as the
first-round matches are at 7:30
a.m. and 9 a.m.
The Cardinal will also field
three doubles teams. Senior Cari
Hagey, who has been out of action
for two weeks with an injured
shoulder, is scheduled to return
at Ojai and play with Birch. In
addition, the Whitlingers and
Tittle-Green will be in the doubles
draw.
The Cardinal finishes its regu
lar season with a match against
California at Berkeley April 30.
The fifth-ranked Bears beat Stan
ford twice last season but Stan
ford had the upper hand in the
team's earlier meeting at Stanford
this year.
