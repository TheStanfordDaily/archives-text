Mark the day: Wednesday, April 20 —
The San Diego Padres call second
baseman Roberto Alomar up from the
minors, and I pee in my shorts with glee.
Fear not — I am not a Padres fan.
But when you play Rotisserie League
baseball, loyalties seem to fade. Rotisserie

baseball is a not-so-new craze in which
eight people conduct an auction for Na
tional League baseball players, and then
the team with the best statistics at year's
end wins the dough. (It's not as simple
as that, but it's close.)
Anyway, if you are not in a league yet
you should be, and if you are in a league,
you're probably too busy re-reading the
USA Today sports page to bother reading
this. (Does any of this make any sense?)
Back to Roberto Alomar. The arrival
of the 20-year-old second sacker sensa
tion in the big leagues will rejuvenate
the Del Lords. (The Del Lords is the
name of my rotisserie team.)
Before we go any further, however, let
me tell you a story. On a fine day in
L.A. over spring break, my friend David
Huffaker began a trek to Yuma, Ariz.
He was going to see the Chicago Cubs
play the Padres in a spring training game.
He and his buddy arrived the night

before the game and went to watch the
greyhounds race, because there ain't
nothing better to do there. And Dave
said it was easy to win money betting at
the track because the only other people
there were those of the geriatric genre.
On the day of the game there turned
out to be no day game. The game was
at night. So Dave and his buddy bought
some beer and drank it in a park in Yuma.
Finally, the game started. And here's
the important part. Dave saw Roberto
Alomar smack an opposite field home
run off of Cy Young Award winner Rick
Sutcliffe. Alomar made some dashing
plays in the field. Dave says, with awe
in his voice, "Roberto Alomar is a stud."
This is why I'm happy.
Not only will the promotion of Alomar
allow me to cast off a dead-weight Del
Lord, but the youngster will become the
Reggie Jackson, the straw that stirs the
drink of the Del Lords. The Padres sent

So, why should you care
about Roberto Alomar and
the Del Lords? Well, it
says here that Alomar will
be the National League
Rookie of the Year.

centerfielder Stanley Jefferson down to
the minors to make room for Alomar.
And guess who has Shawn Abner, the
player who may take Jefferson's place in
the outfield? Yup, you're looking at him.
Boy, Wednesday was a veritable bonanza.
(By the way, Alomar is the son of former
big league Sandy Alomar, and besides,
there hasn't been a parenthetical sen
tence in a while.)

So, why should you care about Roberto
Alomar and the Del Lords? Well, it says

wanted to use that phrase, "It says here."
Gosh, do I feel important.)
Geez, I've still got a few inches to fill.
Hey, did you see Eric Davis score from
first base on a single to center against
the Giants. Good stuff.
If there are any other Rotisserie
Leagues out there in Stanford-land, give
me a call at The Daily, 725-2105. (We'll
compare stats, although you better be
ready — our league is now computerized.
Oooh, aaah.)
In real life, the first-place Arizona State
Sun Devils visit Sunken Diamond this
weekend for a showdown of mammoth
proportions with the second-place Cardi
nal. Be there, aloha.
Who knows, you may see the next
Roberto Alomar.
