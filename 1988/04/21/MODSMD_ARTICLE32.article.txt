Three of the nation's top six singles
players and two of the top three dou
bles tandems head a talent-laden field
today through Sunday at the men's
tennis Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships in Ojai, Calif.
Stanford freshman David Whea-

ton, ranked second, is playing in his first singles
tournament since he reached the finals of the Vol
vo/All America Championships at UCLA in Novem
ber. He is 14-2 on the season.
USC senior Scott Melville, currently ranked
fourth, beat Wheaton in the Volvo tournament to
capture the title and the No. 1 preseason singles
ranking. Melville has also notched three wins this
season over Cardinal sophomore Jeff Tarango and
a victory over Stanford senior Patrick McEnroe.
Tarango, rated sixth, made the semifinals in both
the Volvo tournament and the All-American Indoor
Championships in February. He is 27-12 on the
season.

This is another opportunity for
us to work on our games. The
competition is good. We want to
continue to improve as we move
closer to the NCAAs. 112

The tournament, a chance for Stanford players
to compete against the best in the Pac-10, is valuable
experience for the stretch drive to the NCAA Cham
pionships May 20-28 in Athens, Ga. It also offers
a shot at some personal glory.
"This is another opportunity for us to work on
our games," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "The
competition is good. We want to continue to improve
as we move closer to the NCAAs."
The Cardinal, which has clinched the Pac-10 team
title with a 9-0 record, will also enter freshman
Martin Blackman, sophomore JefT Cathrall, fresh
man Glenn Solomon and sophomore Eric Peus in
the singles draw.
Defending Pac-10 singles champion McEnroe,
rated 10th in the nation, will not make the trip.
Sophomore Barry Richards and junior Curtis
Dunn will compete in the open division.
In doubles play, the tournament crown could boil
down to a match between USC's Melville and Eric
Amend, ranked No. 1 in the nation, and Stanford's
Wheaton and Tarango, rated third.
A heated rivalry has developed between the two
doubles teams. Wheaton and Tarango have beaten
the Trojan pair twice, but Melville and Amend out
lasted the Cardinal tandem 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 last week
end in Los Angeles.
Cathrall-Peus and Blackman-Solomon are the
other Stanford doubles entries.
Richards and Dunn will compete in the open
doubles division.
Stanford has one dual match remaining on its
schedule after the tournament as the team faces
California in Berkeley April 29. The team will also
compete against the Bears in the annual mixed
match in Maples Pavilion May 7.
