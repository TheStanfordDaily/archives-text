Cycling
So close and yet so far: That
was how the Stanford cycling
team felt after last weekend's
racing at UC-Santa Cruz.
Saturday's long yet flat road
race at San Ardo seemed par
ticularly suited to the Stanford
team. But after a rewarding
day of high placings, the Car
dinal found itself in second
place overall, two points behind
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, its
perennial road race rival.
The "A" race went spec
tacularly well for Stanford,
which took four of the top five
placings. Graduate student
Brock LaPorte, freshman Coul
ter Richardson, sophomore
John Coyle and junior Steve
Miller finished 2-3-4-5 respec
tively in the final sprint.
The Cardinal women's team
turned in two particularly high
placings: Alumnus Pam Ste
venson sprinted to second,
while grad student Kaye Wag
ner hammered to sixth.
Stanford's "B" team worked
cohesively to pull off a strong
showing. Fifth-year senior
Dave Louden, junior Hank
Dart and sophomore Vit Henisz
placed second, seventh and
ninth at the finish.
The Stanford "C" men also
did well, with Jon Kaplan
proving his recovery from a
previous crash by finishing
seventh. Sophomore James
Couture also placed, taking

12th.
Sunday's mountainous and
long road race proved treach
erous in more ways than one.
The hills, combined with the
misdirections by course mar
shals, were more than the Car
dinal could handle.
In the "A" race, Laporte
again finished a commanding
second, with Miller not far be
hind in fifth place.
The usual order of finish for
the Stanford women was
reversed Sunday as Wagner
crossed the line in fourth and
Stevenson secured a seventh.
In the "B" race, the lead pack
of cyclists was sent off course,
leaving the way open for riders
who had been dropped to win
the race. Although one Stan
ford rider in the lead pack was
thus prevented from scoring,
senior Bob Borchers plugged
along to sixth place.
The "C" race also suffered
from misdirection. Again, a
Stanford rider with the lead
pack took a wrong turn and
thus didn't place, but Couture
pulled off his first collegiate
victory.
These two races left the
Stanford team hungry to show
that it can beat close compet
itors Cal Poly-SLO and UC-
Santa Barbara. This weekend
the Stanford team hosts a
multiple-lap race, or criterium,
all day Saturday on the streets
circling Encina Gym and a road
race in Pescadero Sunday. The
Stanford cyclists will be aiming
for victory.
Cricket
The Stanford cricket club won
again on Saturday, upping its
season's record to 2-0. Stanford's
first match of the season was
against the Redwood Cricket Club
at Redwood. The hosts batted
first, and their top order batsman
punished the Stanford bowling at
tack. After 15 overs (one over is
six balls), Redwood had scored 85
runs, and after 30 overs they had
scored 185. Redwood's star No. 3
batsman Ozair Nana did the most
damage with a strong 80.
Despite the blistering heat and
the seemingly hopeless situation,
Stanford remained very enthusi
astic. A magnificent diving catch
by player/coach Rakesh Suri sent
Nana back to the pavilion. Stan
ford then brought leg spinner
Nish Bhutani into the attack and
he dismissed three of the remain
ing batsmen in one devastating
over to leave Redwood all out for
198.
The task ahead for Stanford
still looked grim as the Cardinal
did not score 200 runs in any
game all last season. Stanford
started badly, losing two quick
wickets to be 2/14 after 10 overs.
However, incoming batsman Rabi
Mehta soon remedied the situa

tion with powerful shots to all
parts of the ground.
Mehta and opener Errol Fried
burg put on a match-winning
partnership of 77 in very quick
time to bring Stanford to 3/91
before Friedburg was out for 36.
There were still a lot of runs to
make, but Mehta batted on well
to guide the Stanford team to vic
tory and score his first century
of 103 not out.
Last Sunday Stanford played
the Golden Gate Cricket Club. As
the club contains many California
students, a Stanford victory be
came that much more important.
After a steady opening partner
ship of 20 against some good
bowling, Stanford had a collapse
and lost five wickets for only 14
runs. However, a superb middle
order partnership of 57 by Nigel
Sui-Toung and Sunil Khanna, fol
lowed hy a quick 15 from hard
hitting Jamshed Syed saw the
team reach the respectable score
of 133 all out.
Golden Gate began its innings
quickly with one hitter scoring 15
in just 12 minutes before Bhutani
made a great running catch in
the outfield to dismiss him.
However all-rounder Mehta
grabbed back a couple of quick
wickets for Stanford to give the
team some hope at 6/102. Leg
spinner Bhutani again saved the
day when he bowled Golden
Gate's premier batsman with a
googly. Bhutani then cleaned up
the remaining batsmen for ten
runs and Golden Gate were all
out for 112 — another Stanford
victory.
