So close and yet so far: That
was how the Stanford cycling
team felt after last weekend's
racing at UC-Santa Cruz.
Saturday's long yet flat road
race at San Ardo seemed par
ticularly suited to the Stanford
team. But after a rewarding
day of high placings, the Car
dinal found itself in second
place overall, two points behind
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo, its
perennial road race rival.
The "A" race went spec
tacularly well for Stanford,
which took four of the top five
placings. Graduate student
Brock LaPorte, freshman Coul
ter Richardson, sophomore
John Coyle and junior Steve
Miller finished 2-3-4-5 respec
tively in the final sprint.
The Cardinal women's team
turned in two particularly high
placings: Alumnus Pam Ste
venson sprinted to second,
while grad student Kaye Wag
ner hammered to sixth.
Stanford's "B" team worked
cohesively to pull off a strong
showing. Fifth-year senior
Dave Louden, junior Hank
Dart and sophomore Vit Henisz
placed second, seventh and
ninth at the finish.
The Stanford "C" men also
did well, with Jon Kaplan
proving his recovery from a
previous crash by finishing
seventh. Sophomore James
Couture also placed, taking

12th.
Sunday's mountainous and
long road race proved treach
erous in more ways than one.
The hills, combined with the
misdirections by course mar
shals, were more than the Car
dinal could handle.
In the "A" race, Laporte
again finished a commanding
second, with Miller not far be
hind in fifth place.
The usual order of finish for
the Stanford women was
reversed Sunday as Wagner
crossed the line in fourth and
Stevenson secured a seventh.
In the "B" race, the lead pack
of cyclists was sent off course,
leaving the way open for riders
who had been dropped to win
the race. Although one Stan
ford rider in the lead pack was
thus prevented from scoring,
senior Bob Borchers plugged
along to sixth place.
The "C" race also suffered
from misdirection. Again, a
Stanford rider with the lead
pack took a wrong turn and
thus didn't place, but Couture
pulled off his first collegiate
victory.
These two races left the
Stanford team hungry to show
that it can beat close compet
itors Cal Poly-SLO and UC-
Santa Barbara. This weekend
the Stanford team hosts a
multiple-lap race, or criterium,
