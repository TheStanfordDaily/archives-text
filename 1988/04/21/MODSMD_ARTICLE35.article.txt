# Robbins hoping to catch on with the pros
## 
### Linda Dodge 
Doug Robbins wasn't the hero
of last year's College World Series
and he didn't turn professional
with the lure of first-round money
after his junior year. He has never
led the baseball team in batting

average and he doesn't hit a lot
of home runs or steal many bases.
Yet Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess calls Robbins "the best
catcher I have ever coached," and,
make no mistake, Robbins has
earned the praise and the respon
sibilities that go with being the

baseball team's only senior field
player: the starting catching job
for the second straight season, a
middle-of-the-order spot in the
lineup, and the respect of his
teammates and coaches.
His .447 on-base percentage
leads the team, and is indicative
of the fact that although his num
bers in the "flashy" categories
don't lead the country or even
the conference, he gets the job
done. Robbins' .345 batting
average well into the Pacific 10
Conference season is a big jump
from his .265 mark last season,
his first as a full-time starter after
playing first base and backing up
John Ramos, now with the New
York Yankees farm system, at
catcher his sophomore year.
A player possessing solid fun
damentals and durability behind
the plate, Robbins, or "Hoss" as
he is better known to the team,
said that his offensive improve
ments have been due to "a better
mental approach. Last year, I was
practically in a half-season slump,
and when that happens, you lose
your confidence. You think to
yourself, 'I have to get a hit, I
have to get a hit.' This year, if I
have an '0-for' day, I'll just say
to myself that I will do it tomor
row."
And apparently, Robbins has
been listening to what he has been
telling himself. He has gone back
to-back days without a hit only
once this season, at Arizona State,

and in those two games he walked
four times. He has reached base
in 39 of the 41 games he has
started in 1988, and he is cur
rently on a nine-game hitting
streak (eight for his last 18).
Robbins' defense, though, has
been his strong point throughout
his career (besides, of course, his
ability to out-eat anyone on the
team). The fact that he can block
pitches in the dirt saves runs, and
his quick release and rifle arm to
second base has made the strike
em-out, throw-em-out double play
not uncommon this season. These
plays don't show up in the sta
tistics, but they are an intangible,
along with Robbins' quiet leader
ship, that allows his coaches to
be extremely confident in him.
Marquess turns to Robbins for
the small things and the big ones,
like pitching changes during a
game. "I have caught guys like
Lee (Plemel) and Chit (Steve
Chitren) at least 40 times, so I
know when they have their good
stuff," Robbins said.
Theoretically, at least, this
could cause conflict if Robbins and
the pitcher weren't in full agree
ment. "It could be an awkward
situation," Robbins said with a
shrug. "Especially because all of
the guys on the team are confi
dent in their ability. The confi
dence is one of the reasons why
we have such a good team."
All in all, though, both pitchers
and coaches listen when Robbins

has something to say, because
they respect what he can do. Rob
bins' work ethic imitates the
Mark Marquess work ethic: run
ning out grounders, being there
every day and staying in the game
mentally, and executing whenever
needed.
Robbins is even like Marquess
in his effect on umpires. When
Robbins was tossed out of Fri
day's game at UCLA for arguing
balls and strikes, Marquess came
out of the dugout to inquire about
what had happened. He was
ejected too.
"I play the way Coach Marquess
wants his players to play," Rob
bins said. "And in that way I lead
by example. Guys that have grad
uated, like Ruben Amaro, Pete
Stanicek and John Verducci, did
the same for me. They played the
way Coach Marquess played him
self. I guess it helps the younger
players to get an idea of what he
wants."
Robbins guessed right. His
younger brother, Rob, a freshamn
on the team and a victim of "Doug
Robbins' little brother"
syndrome, said that "everybody
has respect for Doug. ... He's a
quiet-type leader, not a rah-rah
guy. But when it is a big game,
he gets everyone fired up. He does
everything. He doesn't just look
for home runs and things that
look good on paper."
Robbins' single in last Satur
day's game at UCLA proved to

be the game-winning hit, and his
home run the next day got things
going for the Cardinal as it took
two of three from the Bruins.
Either way he contributes, Rob
bins has filled his role as a leader.
Next year, though, he will be a
freshman all over again as he will
take his chances with professional
baseball. With his Stanford base
ball background, he is a sure thing
to get drafted, and his hopes lie
with a California team. "I've
played in Alaska and Cape Cod
summer leagues," Robbins said.
"And I have traveled a lot with
my parents. I have seen a lot and
I know that I want to stay here."
Like every college player, he
wants his shot at the Major
Leagues, but, he said, "I'm no
Jack McDowell [Stanford's ace
last season now with the Chicago
White Soxl. I just want to make
steady progress, and I'm going to
evaluate where I am going each
year."
Robbins' work at Stanford
should pay off in the professional
ranks and meanwhile, he is both
helping his team and serving as
an example for others — not by
telling people what to do, but by
doing it himself.
"I don't know anybody on our
team who doesn't like Doug," said
his brother, Rob. "Guys on other
teams don't like him though, be
cause he is such a competitor.
"He treats everybody with
respect. And he gets it back."
