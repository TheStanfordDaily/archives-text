# Orioles lose (again)
## 
### 
MILWAUKEE (AP) - The
Baltimore Orioles set a major
league record with their 14th
straight defeat at the start of
the season, losing to the Mil
waukee Brewers 8-6 Wednes
day night as Jim Gantner's
bases-loaded single sparked a
four-run fifth inning.
Baltimore passed the 1904
Washington Senators and the
1920 Detroit Tigers, who lost
their first 13 games, for early
season futility.
The Orioles' 14th straight
loss also tied a franchise record
last suffered by Baltimore's
1954 team.

Baltimore, which led 5-3 in
the fifth inning, lost despite its
highest-scoring game of the
season.
Bill Wegman, 1-2, got the vic
tory despite allowing five runs
on eight hits in five innings.
Plesac, who balked home a run
in the eighth, pitched 1-2/3 in
nings for his second save as
Milwaukee won its fourth
straight.
Glenn Braggs' three-run
homer put Milwaukee ahead 3-
0 in the second. Baltimore tied
it in the third on singles.
