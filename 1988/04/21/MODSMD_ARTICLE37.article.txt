# Men driving to finish year strong
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The Stanford men's golf team has
really begun to come together in the
past two weeks. Unfortunately, it
could be a case of too little, too late.
With only two tournaments left to
play this season, the golfers have al
ready conceded that they will not

play in the NCAA championships, but are looking
for a good finish this season to carry momentum
into next year. They have their work cut out for
them.
This week, the Cardinal travels to Arizona to
play in the Sun Devil/Thunderbird Invitational in
Phoenix. The tournament, which will be played at
the par-72, 6,900 yard McCormick Ranch Golf Club,
is billed as the "Phoenix Open of Collegiate Golf,"
in reference to a professional tournament played in
the same city. With the field that will compete at
the Sun Devil, the quality of golf might be up to
the professional level.
"This is definitely the toughest field we've been
in all year," Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin said.
Six of the nation's top 20 teams will compete in
the field of 15, including the top three: Oklahoma
State, Arizona State and Arizona, respectively.
"If we finish in the middle of the pack, we will
have done a better job than in our own tournament,"
Goodwin said, referring to the Stanford/U.S. Inter
collegiate Tournament played two weeks ago at the
Stanford Golf Course. In that contest, Stanford's
golfers averaged 74.5 strokes per round, their best
all year, to finish seventh in a field that included
Arizona.
Most of the players are looking forward to the
opportunity to play at a tournament as prestigious
as the Sun Devil. The young team has practiced
extensively in the past week in preparation, but
sophomores Mark Funseth, Brad Joondeph, Brad
Benbrook, Josh Zander and Don Christensen, and
junior John Mahon will have to be at the top of
their games in order to do well in Phoenix.
Stanford's young players will get the initial op
portunity to prove themselves in the first round,
when they will be paired with players from Arizona
and Fresno State. If the Cardinal can stand the
heat of competition from those top teams, it can
finish well in the tournament.
Funseth could very well be the key to Stanford's
performance. In his last competitive round, he tore
up the Orinda Golf Club course with a three-under
par 69. The rest of the players have been consistently
scoring in the mid-70's, and if they can back up
Funseth, Goodwin's team could enjoy a good finish.
The Sun Devil will help Stanford gear up for the
Pacific 10 Conference tournament in early May.
Most of the Pac-10 will be in Phoenix, and playing
in the blistering Arizona heat with such competitive
teams will help make the Cardinal "tournament
tough," according to Goodwin.
While most players have conceded that they will
not go to the NCAA championship tournament,
they view their final two tournaments as a good
chance to build on this year's progress and carry
it into next season. "It's like the beginning of the
year for us," Zander said.
