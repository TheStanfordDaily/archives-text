# Kennedy remarks in televised debate rile Republicans
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy's critical
response to an address here Monday by Secretary
of Education William Bennett has provoked an
uproar among campus conservatives.
The conservatives are particularly upset at one
comment Kennedy made last night on the MacNeil-
Lehrer News Hour about audience response to Ben
nett's speech. Bennett, who appeared on the news
program with Kennedy, said that at one point in
his talk at Stanford Monday he asked the audience
whether they thought student groups had "in
timidated" the Faculty Senate into supporting the
new Cultures, Ideas and Values program. According
to Bennett, several students then raised their hands.
Kennedy responded by saying that because Ben
nett's speech had been co-sponsored by the Stanford
College Republicans, conservative students made up
a disproportionate part of the audience. Kennedy
added that he thought these students had clapped
at Bennett's remark to "please" the secretary.
"My phone has been ringing off the hook for me
to put together a response to Kennedy, said junior
Ken Rivera, former president of the Stanford College
Republicans. Rivera said the College Republicans
plan to "very diplomatically approach him with a
ietter asking for a formal apology.
Rivera said he found Kennedy's remarks "frankly
appalling and totally unsubstantiated." He said he
thought the audience at Bennett's speech Monday
"clearly was not conservative."
Rivera complained that Kennedy's statements
"put to waste" the efforts of the College Republicans
and the event's other sponsors, the ASSU Speakers
Bureau and The Stanford Review, a conservative
student quarterly. "Kennedy was not even at the
debate," Rivera said.
History Prof. Paul Seaver, a leading player in
efforts to reform the University's Area One require
ment, disagreed with Rivera's recollection of audi
ence response to Bennett's "intimidation" question.
Seaver, who attended the speech, said that although
some students, including conser
vative "party loyalists," did ap
plaud in agreement with Bennett,
others cried "no."
Peter Thiel, editor of the Stan
ford Review, said that the issue
of whether or not the College Re
publicans were the only ones who
responded affirmatively to Ben
nett's question was irrelevant.

"Does it make [Bennett's ques
tion] even less a charge?" he
asked.
Thiel said the University should
treat the opinions of the College
Republicans with as much respect
as it does other group's views.
Kennedy's remark "made us feel
as if we didn't count," Thiel said.
Calling Bennett "fundamen
tally uninformed" about the West
ern Culture issue at Stanford,
VTSS Lecturer Barry Katz denied
the secretary's charge that "in
timidation" had played a decisive
role in the Faculty Senate debate.

Katz said that although there
were a "few incidents of under
graduate intemperance and fac
ulty high-handedness" during the
debate, the Faculty Senate han
dled the issue with "astonishing
openness."
Freshman Nomi Martin, a
member of the Black Student Un
ion, said she thought Bennett's
charge that the BSU had used
"intimidation" tactics against the
Faculty Senate were unfair.
Martin explained that the BSU
had tried unsuccessfully for eight

years to effect change in the West
ern Culture program from within
the system. The BSU's stepped-up
protests in recent months were a
"last resort," Martin said, and
weren't intended to suppress
other opinions.
"It's sad people feel this way,"
she said.
Seaver said he thought Mon
day's speech had an excessively
"Republican event atmosphere."
Saying he thought Bennett's
speech was too political, Seaver
added, "I thought he'd lambaste
us without the party cast."
