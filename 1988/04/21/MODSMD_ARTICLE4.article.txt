University President Donald Kennedy's critical
response to an address here Monday by Secretary
of Education William Bennett has provoked an
uproar among campus conservatives.
The conservatives are particularly upset at one
comment Kennedy made last night on the MacNeil-

Rivera said he found Kennedy's remarks "frankly
