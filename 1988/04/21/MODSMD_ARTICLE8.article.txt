# Campbell's coffers double Konnyu's

Campbell has raised more than twice
as much money as incumbent Congress
man Ernie Konnyu since January in
their contest to win the Republican
nomination to run for the 12th Con
gressional district seat, according to the
most recent Federal Election Commis
sion reports.
This is the second consecutive time

period that Campbell exceeded Konnyu
in fund raising.
Campbell, in a press conference yes
terday, berated Konnyu for what he
sees as an abuse of congressional frank
ing privileges. Franking is a privilege
that allows congressmen to mail
newsletters to their constituents at the
government's expense rather than at
their own.
Campbell claimed Konnyu increased
his mailings after Campbell announced

his candidacy. The mailings were "care
fully orchestrated to get free mailings
to the voters"and were timed to coin
cide with the campaign, according to
Karin Miranda, Campbell's campaign
manager.
Though the purpose of the franking
privilege is to inform constituents of
congressional developments, Miranda
said Konnyu used it merely for "prop-
aganda."
"While he may not have broken
the letter of the law, it is clear
this is in violation of the spirit of
the law," Miranda said.
Sara Boney, Konnyu's chief of
staff in Washington, denied that
the privilege had been violated.
"It's impossible to abuse the
franking privilege," Boney said,
claiming that "the allegation is

completely false. We are held to
rigorous standards on frankings,
and all mailings must be cleared
by the Democratic-controlled Con
gressional Franking Commis
sion."
Boney called Campbell's com
plaint "a flimsy excuse for a press
conference."
In preparation for the June 7
primary, Campbell raised
$151,415 from January 1 to
March 31, according to the report.
Konnyu raised $75,466 during the
same period.
In the last three months of

1987, Campbell raised $126,000
compared to Konnyu's $111,000.
The Campbell campaign antic
ipates raising $500,000 before the
June 7 primary, according to
Miranda, who added that contri
butions were "coming in particu
larly heavy right now."
Konnyu's campaign manager
seemed unconcerned with the dis
parity in amounts of money
raised. "We're not surprised," said
Pat Salsman said, explaining that
challengers usually need to raise
more than incumbents if they
hope to wage a successful cam

paign.
"We're just continuing to do
what we need to do in order to
win," Salsman added.
Miranda conceded that Camp
bell's campaign will be expensive,
saying "We anticipate spending
every single dollar." According to
Miranda, 82 percent of Campbell's
funds came from industrial do
nors while only 2 percent came
from political action committees,
or PACs. Candidates' acceptance
of PAC money has been an issue
raised in the current presidential
campaign.
