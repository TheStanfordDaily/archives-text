I Wanted 1
Creative, highly motivated software engineers sought to work on
new products in a small, high-growth software company. New
engineers will immediately begin work in small design teams on
major new, marketable products.
Intuit is a small (22 employees) software company located on
University Avenue in downtown Palo Alto. Our product, Quicken,
is the #1 best-selling financial software for personal computers
(IBM PC's, Apple H's, and Macintosh computers). We have many
more projects planned than people to work on them and are
looking for more outstanding designers and programmers to add
to our development team. The company is less than four years old
with an entrepreneurial, team-oriented spirit, and we offer
significant equity to new employees.
Qualifications: Candidates must have excellent programming and
design skills and should have taken coursework at least through
CSIOB series (or equivalent). Either B.S. or M.S. degree is
acceptable. Experience programming on micros (especially IBM's
and Mac's) is a plus. Familiarity with C and assembler preferable
but not essential.
Salary and stock commensurate with experience.
