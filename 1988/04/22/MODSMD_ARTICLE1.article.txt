# Student nabbed for Bookstore computer heists
## 
### Erin Martin Editorial staff 
A student employee was ar
rested last week for stealing close
to $60,000 worth of merchandise
from the Stanford Bookstore —
the largest heist in the store's
history.
Senior Jose Fernandez, last
year's president of the Theta Xi
fraternity, was charged on one
count of burglary and two counts
of grand larceny. He allegedly
stole computers from the Book
store and resold them to "un

suspecting" buyers.
Because he allegedly used
forged Bookstore purchase orders
as proof to buyers that he owned
the equipment, Fernandez will
also be charged with several
counts of forgery, police said.
Bookstore security nabbed Fer
nandez late last Thursday night
as he wheeled an Apple Macintosh
computer — concealed beneath
trash in a garbage bin — to the
Bookstore's loading dock and put
it into his car, said Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer of the Stanford Police.
He was released last weekend on

a $15,000 bond.
Fernandez is accused of stealing
more than 20 computer systems,
numerous computer accessories
and a large amount of other stock
including textbooks, expensive
pens and clothing.
Most of the computers were
sold for about $3,000, less than
the retail value of the merchan
dise but more than the special
discounted rate available to stu
dents and faculty through the
Bookstore.
Both Bookstore management
and the police suspect that Fer

nandez has been pilfering mer
chandise buried in trash since last
November.
Fernandez, a double major in
economics and sociology, initially
admitted to security that he had
unlawfully taken one computer in
addition to others, but when
police arrived, he refused to give
further information.
The burglary — also the first
computer robbery at the Book
store, according to a Bookstore
press representative — appears to
be unrelated to a string of com
puter thefts that have taken place

this year at other locations on
campus. Niemeyer said Fernan
dez probably orchestrated the
thefts on his own.
Fernandez declined to comment
last night.
Bookstore security guards ini
tiated surveillance of Fernandez
on closed circuit television after
having detected "suspicious" be
havior on a previously recorded
videotape approximately three
weeks prior to the arrest.
Police last week searched Fer
nandez's room in the Theta Xi
house, known as "the Taxi." and

a storage locker in Redwood City.
They found five new computer
systems, valued at over $16,000,
and very detailed computer
records of Fernandez's apparent
robberies and subsequent sales.
With the information contained
on the computer disks, police have
located five of the buyers and ex
pect to find up to 12 more in
what Niemeyer described as a "big
round-up."
However, authorities are grant
ing a temporary amnesty period
