# A 						Draw and a prayer
## Priest's touch is heavenly for students 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Their prayers were answered.
Many Stanford students find
themselves looking for help from
on high during this tension-filled
week of the Draw, but three un
dergraduates took a more direct
approach Wednesday â€” by having
a Catholic priest draw for them.
Apparently someone heeded their
pleas, and their creativity paid off
in a big way.
Freshmen Michael Canul, Zac
hary Hernandez and Miguel
Canales, who all currently live in
Casa Zapata, approached Father
Tom Finsterbach of the Newman
Center on Tuesday with their un
usual request, and at 3:30 p.m.
on Wednesday, he pulled out
number 0042, which should put
the three in either the Suites or
Yost House next year.
"They were a lot more confident
than I was," Finsterbach said yes
terday. "They snatched the en
velope out of my hand before I
could open it."

Canul was full of advice after
the coup. "I recommend [having
a priest draw] highly," he said.
"We knew there was no way we
wouldn't get above 100."
The idea to have Finsterbach
draw originally came from Her
nandez, but was not primarily
based on Finsterbach's profes
sion. The three were more con
cerned with finding a neutral
party to draw so that in the event
of a bad draw, "we wouldn't blame
the guy who drew," Canul said.
All three regularly help set up
for Sunday masses and knew
Finsterbach before approaching
him. They plan to have him draw
for them again next year.
Canul added that they did not
bother praying at the critical mo
ment because "the priest was
enough."
Although divine intervention
seems to have helped the three,
Finsterbach said he doesn't want
"a reputation as 'lucky fingers.' "
"It could be a flip-flop next year,
from hot to cold." he said.
