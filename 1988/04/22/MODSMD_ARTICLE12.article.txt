# Tree costume disappears
## Culprit still at large, but Cal students are suspected 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
What if somebody stole a tree
and nobody cared? That's the
dillema facing the thieves who
heisted the Stanford Tree from
the Band's bus at UC-Davis dur
ing last Saturday's "Battle of
the Bands."
According to Band publicity
director Eric Black, the Tree
costume was taken from an un
locked luggage compartment
underneath the bus while the
Band was performing. The
event also featured bands from
UC-Davis, Humboldt State and
UC-Berkeley.
Shortly after the costume was
stolen, Stanford Axe Committee
Chair Tom Smegal received a
telephone call from an uniden
tified member of the UC-
Berkeley Rally Committee. The

Rally Committee member told
Smegal that she had been con
tacted by an anonymous party
claiming to have the costume.
The stolen costume, used for
the past year by former Tree
Brendan Kelly, was being used
by new Tree William Thomas
until he finishes designing a
new costume. Thomas said he
will probably use the tree cos
tume from two years ago until
he is finished making the new
costume.
Nobody has yet come forth
claiming to have the costume,
although speculation as to the
identity of the perpetrators has
run rampant. According to
Smegal, shortly before the cos
tume was stolen, the Berkeley
band's bus was moved "for se
curity reasons."
Andy Shih, assistant public
relations director for the UC-

Berkeley band, said he hadn't
heard that the costume had
been stolen. "Nobody here
knows anything," he said after
asking several Berkeley band
members, "but they're all rather
elated."
Smegal said it is rumored that
the tree-nappers were trying to
swap the costume for UC-
Berkeley's long-lost mascot,
Oski. The giant stuffed bear was
stolen from the UC-Berkeley
student center in 1986, and
some suspect the Stanford Band
as the culprit.
Black dismisses that notion.
"We have no idea where Oski
is," he said. "We can make an
other costume and they can go
out and shoot another bear."
Smegal echoed those senti
ments. "As far as we're con
cerned, they can have it,"he
said.
