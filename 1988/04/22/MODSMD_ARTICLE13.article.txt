# Dorms voting on condom machines
## 
### Matt Poppe Staff writer 
Sex is on Stanford students'
minds this week as they vote on
whether to place condom dis
pensers in their residences.
The University Housing Oper
ations Advisory Committee
(HOAC) in January approved
Council of Presidents member
Leonard Adler's plan to install the
dispensers campus-wide, but each
dorm's residents must give final
approval for installation in their
dorm.
In a survey of 26 resident as
sistants yesterday, 17 said that
their dorm had voted for the dis
pensers, while eight dorms had
not yet voted. One dorm decided
against advertising condoms by
installing the dispensers and
chose instead to make condoms
available to its residents by
keeping them in a shoebox.
Results of the dorm votes
ranged from 21 votes for to 16
against in Hurlburt House, to
unanimous favorable decisions in

Crothers Memorial Hall, the two
Grove houses and Granada
House, according to the RAs in
those dorms.
Although many dorms approved
the dispensers with little debate,
law student Patricia Plumer, an
RAin Potter, said the issue at
tracted Potter's "biggest house
meeting yet."
RAs in several dorms said the
condom dispensers posed both
moral and religious problems for
some residents.
According to Faisan RA Lilly
Chen, a junior, several residents
were worried the dispensers
"would make sex easier."
Senior Metin Gokcen, an RAin
Alondra, said some residents were
unhappy that "abstention (from
having sex) was not being pre
sented as an issue" in the debate.
Chen also said there were aes
thetic objections to the machines,
explaining that people "don't
want their parents going into our
bathrooms and seeing [the con
dom dispensers]."
According to Plumer, one Pot

ter resident was afraid the dis
pensers might attract unwanted
intruders.
Several RAs said the megor ar
gument made in favor of installing
the dispensers was that condoms
help provide protection against
AIDS, venereal disease and un
wanted pregnancy.
In many dorms, the debate was
not over whether to have dis
pensers, but where to put them.
The plan approved by HOAC
stipulates that when possible, the
condom machines should be
placed in coed bathrooms.
In Otero House, the dorm's
only coed bathroom is located in
its computer room. Senior Jessica
Gregg, an Otero RA, said "you
can hear everything that goes on
in that bathroom, so every time
someone heard a 'chink, kac
hunk,' they'd know what was
going on."
Otero approved the dispensers
on the condition that it would
receive two dispensers to be
placed in single-sex bathrooms.
