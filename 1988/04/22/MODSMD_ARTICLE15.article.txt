Honduras halts anti-U.S. march
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — Using tear
gas and firing in the air, Honduran police
broke up a group of about 1,000 anti-U.S.
demonstrators yesterday as they neared the
U.S. Embassy. No injuries were reported.
Two weeks ago, a crowd of similar size
sacked and burned part of an annex of the
embassy, killing two persons. U.S. officials
estimated the damage at $6 million.
Yesterday's demonstration was the first
major public display of anti-U.S. feeling since
then. The marchers were protesting U.S. policy
in Honduras and their government's compli
ance with that policy.
The surge of anti-Americanism was sparked
April 5 by the arrest and ouster into U.S.
hands of alleged Honduran drug smuggler
Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros. He was wanted
by U.S. authorities for questioning about his
role in the killing of a U.S. drug agent in
Mexico in 1985 and is now in federal prison
in Marion, 111.
Dukakis signs state health plan
BOSTON — In a festive outdoor ceremony,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, leading
contender for the Democratic presidential
nomination, yesterday signed into law the na
tion's first legislation providing basic health
insurance for all residents of a state.
"We have good reason to rejoice today,"
Dukakis told a lunchtime crowd of several
hundred people jammed onto the statehouse
steps, "as we once again become the nation's
laboratory, the nation's pathfinder — blazing
a trail that leads to affordable, quality health
care for every man, woman and child in this
commonwealth."
The law, which will be phased into full effect
by 1992, is aimed at the 600,000 uninsured
people among the 6 million residents of the
state. But in this election year, its impact
extends well beyond the state borders, becom
ing a yardstick for measuring a potential Du
kakis presidency.
Botha plans new government
JOHANNESBURG — President Pieter
Botha yesterday announced plans for a new
form of multiracial government in which
blacks would participate in the white
controlled electoral college that chooses the
president and possibly would be given a role
at the Cabinet level.
Botha stopped far short of proposing full
political rights for South Africa's black
majority or even a voice in the legislative
process, from which they are excluded.
But his proposals for the first time offered
blacks a limited role in the executive branch
of national government, similar to that already
accorded to Indians and mixed-race
"Coloreds."
