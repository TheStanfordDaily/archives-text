# U.S. to step up military activity in Gulf
## Aircraft carrier and 12 other ships sent as show of force against Iran 
### 
WASHINGTON - The United
States will dispatch 13 warships to the
Persian Gulf region next week, the
Pentagon announced yesterday , as the
administration pondered whether to
extend U.S. naval protection there to
ships that do not fly the American flag.
Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard
described the deployment as a "long
planned rotation, a changing of the
guard" designed to relieve some of the
29 ships on duty in the region. But
defense officials said privately that the
new deployments provide the possibil
ity that a beefed-up, overlapping force
will be there at least temporarily —
potentially for greater protection ef
forts and as a show of force against
any Iranian retaliation.
The deployment will begin with the
departure of the aircraft carrier For
restal and seven escorts Monday, a
week after U.S. and Iranian forces en
gaged in one of the largest naval
encounters since World War 11. In the
wake of the clash, the Reagan admin
istration, responding partly to urgings
from some lawmakers, is reassessing

the policy that has limited U.S. naval
protection in the gulf to 11 U.S.-
flagged Kuwaiti oil tankers.
The administration is considering
whether to give protection to other
nations' ships that have been attacked
in the Tehran government's effort to
disrupt commerce with Iraq.
Meanwhile, in Congress, Sen. Brock
Adams, D-Wash., declared that he will
seek a new vote on invoking the War
Powers Resolution to give Congress
greater control over the U.S. gulf mis
sion.
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the House Armed Services Commit
tee, also accused the administration
of overreacting in moving to destroy
two Iranian oil platforms in the gulf
in retribution tor renewed Iranian
mining of the waterway. Aspin's
criticism was among the first voiced
in Congress about the administration's
retaliatory action, which led to the
naval battle that crippled six Iranian
vessels and reportedly killed 40 sailors.
"We will not forget the pure blood
of the Iranians shed by the U.S. mer

cenaries in the Persian Gulf," Iranian
Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi said
after a Cabinet meeting in Tehran,
according to the state-run Iranian
news agency IRNA. "The U.S. should
know that the Persian Gulf will not
tolerate the presence of filthy
Americans."
The Pentagon's new naval deploy
ment is to include a destroyer and
four missile frigates, scheduled to
leave their home ports on the East
Coast Wednesday. The ships are ex
pected to take roughly three weeks to
reach their stations in the gulf, a
senior defense official said.
"If circumstances should dictate,
you'll have two (aircraft carrier battle
groups) in the area, and if need be,
you can keep them there at the time,"
the official said. The administration
employed a similar strategy in March
1986 as tensions heightened with
Libya, rotating more ships to the
Mediterranean shortly before U.S.
planes bombed Tripoli and Benghazi.
In announcing the ship movement,

Howard also revealed new details of
Monday's U.S. strike against Iranian
targets, including the original extent
of the planned retaliation and the
degree to which leaders in Washington
held a tight rein over the operations.
The original blueprint included a
plan to strike an Iranian frigate, the
Sabalan, because of what Howard de
scribed as that ship's "propensity to
use their guns to fire on the crew
quarters of the tankers and other mer
chant vessels that it attacked." The
planned targets also included three oil
platforms used by Iran in its attacks
against ships in the gulf, Howard said.
After dropping one of the oil plat
forms from the plan, U.S. forces struck
the other two. Before they could attack
the Sabalan, Howard said, a smaller
Iranian ship, the Joshan, challenged
U.S. forces and was sunk. A second
Iranian frigate, the Sahand, then made
a dash for U.S. forces at high speed
and was set ablaze by U.S. Harpoon
missiles.
