# House passes trade bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The House,
despite President Reagan's veto
threat, voted overwhelmingly yes
terday to approve an omnibus
trade bill after beating back a Re
publican attempt to strip the bill
of a controversial provision re
quiring most manufacturers to
give 60 days' notice of plant
closings and major layoffs.
The bill, which would toughen
and streamline U.S. curbs on im
ports, now goes to the Senate,
which plans to begin debate today
and vote next week. If the Senate
passes the bill, as expected, it will
go to Reagan, who said yesterday
he would veto it if it still contained
the plant-closing provision.
The final vote for the bill was
312 to 107, more than the two
thirds majority that would be ne
cessary to override a veto. The
voting fell largely along party
lines, with most Democrats in fa
vor and most Republicans op
posed.
Substantially closer was the
vote against the Republican at
tempt to eliminate the plant
closing section. The tally was 253
to 167, short of a two-thirds
majority, with 23 Democrats
breaking ranks.
House Ways and Means Com
mittee Chairman Dan Ros
tenkowski, D-111., said the bill "es
tablishes a policy that will make
America a winner in international
competitive markets." Last year

the United States imported $173
billion more in merchandise than
it exported.
As finally approved by the
House after three years of legisla
tive maneuvering, the bill is sub
stantially less protectionist than
it had been in some of its earlier
versions.
Removed, for example, was the
Gephardt amendment, once
passed by the House, which would
have mandated retaliation against
Japan and other countries with
large and persistent trade
surpluses with the United States.
In its final form, the bill would
tighten existing sanctions against
trading partners that "dump"
their goods in the United States
— sell them here at below cost
— and it would streamline pro
cedures for imposing tariffs and
quotas to protect American indus
tries from surges in foreign com
petition.
Federal unemployment benefits
and retraining programs would be
expanded for workers left jobless
by competition from abroad.
Among the non-trade provi
sions, in addition to the plant
closing section, are recently
watered-down sanctions against
Japan's Toshiba Corp. for selling
militarily useful technology to the
Soviet Union, and repeal of the
windfall-profits tax on oil.
