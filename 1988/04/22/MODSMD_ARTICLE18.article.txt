# Gore quits; keeps delegates

WASHINGTON - Sen. Albert Gore
Jr., predicting "there will be other days
for me and the causes that matter to
us," suspended his presidential cam
paign yesterday and promised to work
vigorously for his party's ultimate nom
inee.
"The nominee is going to be Michael
Dukakis or Jesse Jackson," he said. "I'm
going to do everything I can to help
them do what I set out to do, and that
is to put a Democrat in the White
House."
Gore said his decision to suspend
rather than end his campaign will not

affect the balance of the race. All but
78 of his 423 delegates, he explained,
could have gone to the convention under
either circumstance and voted for
whomever they chose. However, if he
had officially withdrawn from the race,
the remainder would have been blocked
from attending and their spots would
have been allocated roughly evenly be
tween Jackson and Dukakis.
Gore's announcement came as no
surprise after his distant third-place
finish in Tuesday's New York primary,
the latest in a string of defeats.
