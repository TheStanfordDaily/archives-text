# Hillel fears rally was target
## Campus bomb scare 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
An anonymous caller, who warned Stan
ford Police officers yesterday that a bomb
was set to explode in White Plaza around
noon, may have sought to protest a celebra
tion of Israel's 40th anniversary taking
place there, a leader of Stanford's Jewish
community charged yesterday.
Officers received the bomb threat, which
was apparently a prank, at 12:29 p.m. dur
ing the middle of a Hillel-sponsored party
for Israel.
"1 would say (the threat came from)
someone who was unhappy with Israel,"
said Rabbi Ari Cartun, who is associated
with Hillel, Stanford's Jewish student or
ganization.
The caller, who said only that a bomb
was set to go off in White Plaza in 10

minutes, made no mention of the Jewish
celebration in progress, according to Sgt.
Del Bandy of the Stanford Police Depart
ment.
Bandy said Hillel members, and other
people in the area, were not warned of the
threat because the plain clothes officers
who were sent to White Plaza arrived six
to eight minutes after the time the bomb
was supposed to explode.
"At that time it was rather unnecessary
to contact those involved ... it would have
taken a half-hour to contact all (of them),"
he said.
The police may catch the prankster be
cause he called the department's emer
gency 911 number which immediately
traces every call it receives.
Bandy added, however, that he would
not be able to disclose any information
about the origin of the call until later today.
