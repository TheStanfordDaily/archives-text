## Anonymity, please

CONFIDENTIALITY is not
enough. Cowell Student
Health Center should
change its policy on AIDS antibody
testing and provide testing on an
anonymous basis.
Anonymous testing guarantees
that the results will never be avail
able to anyone but the person
tested. Identifying information is
kept under confidential testing
programs, and that information
could someday be accessed if AIDS
hysteria continues to build.
While free anonymous testing is
available at the authorized testing
centers of the San Mateo and Santa
Clara County health departments,
that option is out of reach for stu
dents without cars.
Those students should be able
to be tested without fear of adverse
repercussions.
Cowell's reason for having con
fidential testing is to ensure that
those who test positive receive ad
equate medical attention. This is
not a bad goal, and doctors can
largely be trusted not to violate
confidentiality.
However, much of society has
not been as rational as the medical
profession in dealing with the
AIDS crisis. Many people persist
in discriminating against people
with AIDS and AIDS-related com
plex, and even against those who
test positive but are not sick.
The confidentiality that Cowell
provides could be endangered by
bills pending in the state legisla

ture and by the second La Rouche
initiative, which is on the Califor
nia ballot in June.
Students testing positive should
be advised of the need to seek med
ical care without having to reveal
their identity. Many of those who
test positive for antibodies to the
human immunodeficiency virus
are not in need of urgent medical
care and may remain outwardly
healthy for years.
Other objections to providing
anonymous testing are that stu
dents would risk running into
aquaintances in Cowell or that it
would be difficult to verify student
affiliation.
However, Cowell Director Dr.
Paul Walters said he believes that
these are minor problems and is
willing to change the policy if there
is a student consensus for such a
move.
The students who are likely to
be tested at Cowell may be less
informed than those who are will
ing to go elsewhere, and their civil
rights should therefore be all the
more diligently protected.
Recent articles have pointed out
previous deficiencies in the Cowell
testing process that have now been
reformed. As part of this continu
ing effort to upgrade its services
to students, Cowell should insti
tute anonymous testing procedures
with all possible speed, while also
maintaining its impressive com
mitment to AIDS education ef
forts.
