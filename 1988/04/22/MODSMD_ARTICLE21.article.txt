## ASSU never spent money on television equipment 
### 
COLUMNIST Leslie Kaufman and
The Daily owe the ASSU Senate
an apology. Kaufman's April 19
column, "An apolitical ASSU," contains
inaccuracies that are far too gross not
to be retracted by the author and her
editors.
Kaufman writes: "Witness ... more
unbelievably the $8,000 the senate
spent on equipment so that they could
televise themselves on SuNet." She
goes on to say that because the meet
ings are so boring, most senators don't
bother to attend them regularly
anyway.
Both of these statements are not
true. The senate has not spent any
money whatsoever to purchase equip
ment to televise itself. Furthermore,

most senators do attend senate meet
ings regularly.
The reason these comments are
particularly disturbing is not that they
are critical of the senate, but rather
because they are so far from being
true.
We at the ASSU welcome criticism
of our work. It is the nature of any
government that not everyone can be
happy with all its decisions. On top of
that, we are all students — not profes
sionals — and are bound to make
mistakes. ,
Student phone calls, letters and
personal visits to the ASSU offices are
very helpful in letting us know how we
are doing and where we need to
change things.

It is here that The Daily plays an
important role as well. The student
press is influential in helping to shape
the agenda of the senate and to point
out areas that need extra attention.
When done correctly, the system is
very effective in rectifying problems
and furthering the educational mission
of this university.
When columnists, reporters and their
editors allow glaring inaccuracies to be
printed, however, everyone loses. Ir
reparable damage is done to the stu
dent group, the credibility of The Daily
is called into question, and all are left
in an atmosphere that makes progress
and cooperation difficult.
The senate has enough real problems
to solve without having to handle false

allegations from the student press.
So to The Daily, I suggest you act
with a little more circumspection in
the future. The power of the press is
tremendous, but with this power comes
a corresponding responsibility to pres
ent the news honestly and fairly.
To Kaufman, I suggest you no
longer listen to your senior friend who
seems to know so much about the
ASSU. It is obvious that she or he will
only continue to feed you inaccurate
information.
Instead, come by our offices or to a
senate meeting and find out what we
are really about. You can apologize to
us then.
David Smolen
Chair, ASSU Senate
