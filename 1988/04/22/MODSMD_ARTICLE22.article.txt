# Interest in RA jobs remains consistent
## 
### 
An April 13 article reported that
overall resident assistant applications
are down. While there are fewer RA
positions, the ratio of applicants to
positions is comparable.
There are two reasons for the
decrease in the number of RA posi
tions. First, the closure of Roble Hall
resulted in the loss of 12 positions.
Second, a reconceptualization of several
staff positions resulted in the loss of
16 positions; coordinator positions in
graduate residences will fulfill many
former RA responsibilities.
Understandably graduate students
may be more interested in working in
the new coordinator positions, but we
would be concerned if only a handful
of graduate students were interested in
being RAs in undergraduate houses.
Graduate student RAs bring maturity,
experience as undergraduates and their
involvement as committed scholars into

their work with undergraduates.
Despite concerted efforts to improve
the experience of students of color in
Stanford residences, it is still the case
that some students of color feel iso
lated, unsupported and the targets of
racism in our dorms and houses.
This year Roble RA Des Bracey or
ganized a workshop for RA applicants
of color. Twelve current RAs of color
shared their experiences.
Many said they were in the position
of educating their fellow staff members
as well as students in their houses
about basic issues of equality and non
discriminatory treatment as well as
about the history, culture and contem
porary concerns of their own ethnic
community.
They were put on the spot to
respond to racist remarks and be
haviors. They had to spend hours ex
plaining affirmative action, theme
houses, the Western Culture debate,
the BSU membership issue and similar
topics. They were often one of a very
few persons of their ethnicity in their
house. They felt isolated.

Just as important, however, is the
fact that they felt that being an RA
had been a significant and gratifying
experience in terms of their own
growth at Stanford. They felt they had
been helpful to students of color and
other students in their houses and
instrumental in educating all students
in the house about race relations as
well as many other concerns.
On the one hand, being an RA is
incredibly rewarding, because of the
personal relationships and educational
impact an RA can have on others. On
the other hand, being an RA can be
exhausting, humiliating, painful and
isolating.
There is a drop in black applicants
for RA positions from 10 percent of
the applicant pool in 1987 to 7 percent
in 1988.
Many black applicants are applying
to those houses with black resident
fellows and larger populations of black
students. It would seem that for some
black applicants the challenge of being
an RA is more appealing in an envi
ronment which has a strong black

student presence or where the resident
fellow is known to be sensitive to stu
dents of color.
Our challenge is to make all residen
ces equally attractive options for stu
dents of color who are interested in
serving on the residence staff.
The headline "RA applications plum
met: Fewer blacks, grad students" sug
gests less interest in RA positions this
year. This is not the case. Interest
seems consistent with the number of
available positions.
The Office of Residential Education
is committed to increasing the number
of persons of color across the residence
system. By increasing the numbers of
RFs and RAs of color and improving
staff training for everyone the resi
dence environments will become more
supportive to students of color.
Our goal is to enable all students in
the residences to have positive educa
tional experiences on matters of race,
class and culture.
