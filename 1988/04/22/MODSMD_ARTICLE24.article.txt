## Who will help Bush ? 
### 
WITH APOLOGIES to Rev. Jesse
Jackson, it's now pretty safe to
assume that the November con
testants for the White House will be Mas
sachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and in
cumbent Vice President George Bush.
But whom will they choose for the vice
president spots?
Because Jackson holds virtual veto (or
self-appointment) power in the Demo
cratic race for waterboy, the Republican
side may be a bit easier to call. For
starters, Bush is in too commanding a
position to stoop to brokering and bar
gaining for his second-slotter. Whomever
Bush wants — who's willing — he'll get.
That unfortunate for Mr. or Ms.
Whomever.
In February, when I predicted that
Bush would win his party's nomination,
I also said his choice for official funeral
attender would be Rep. Jack Kemp, R-
N.Y. Kemp, I had reasoned, would attract
disillusioned hard-liners and help unify
a fractured GOP in time for November.
On that score I guessed wrong.
Kemp would indeed, as I'd said, draw
in the GOP right wing. But most of these
Republicans are already aboard the Bush
bandwagon, however begrudgingly. Kemp
proved a flop in every single primary and
would repeat that performance as a can
didate for vice president.
So whom else might Georgie tap? My
oddsmakers have staked out the following
potential victims:
Sen. Bob Dole, R.-Kan.: 500-1. Bob Dole
is clearly the best pick for political pur
poses, but Republicans can forget this
"dream ticket." Problem: While it's true
that the Senate minority leader last week
held a kiss-and-make-up party for Bush,
it's also true that these two contempo
raries hate each other's guts.

Elizabeth Dole: 100-1. In more ways than
one, Liddy is a more attractive choice
than her husband. She's no lightweight
or token, either; she has studied at Duke,
Oxford and Harvard and has served ably
in the Nixon and Reagan administrations.
Problem: The divorce proceedings that
would ensue after her acceptance of the
No. 2 slot just might crash the Grand
Old Party.
Calif. Gov. George Deukmejian: 40-1.
The Bush band drools at the prospect of
Duke joining up. Based on his approval
ratings in this state, his squeaky-clean
and effective record, and, yes, his ethnic
name, Deukmejian could make the GOP
ticket a sure winner.
Problem: Duke simply can't leave. If
he became VP — a probable result if he
runs — he'd abandon the governor's of
fice to the lieutenant governor, liberal
Democrat Leo McCarthy.
So. Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell: 8-1.
Campbell has a big Bush lOU to cash in
and will probably be in a Bush cabinet
regardless. Why the IOU? The governor
endorsed Bush very early and worked
hard to hand Bush a win in the pivotal
South Carolina primary, held just three
days before Super Tuesday.
Problems: Campbell's a relatively un
known white conservative from a very
Southern state — all of which may repel
November's swing voters. Plus, Campbell
says he isn't terribly interested in VP-ine.
Who is?
Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexan
der: 3-1. Like Campbell, Alexander is a
politically attractive choice, if for no bet
ter reason than geography.
Since he's Southerner, he could cancel
out the benefits to Democrats of picking

Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., or Sen. A 1 Gore, D.-
Tenn., as Dukakis' running mate. Alex
ander is also a top prospect because he's
worked well with Democrats and has
made few enemies.
Problem: "Lamar who?"
New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean: 5-3. Kean
hails from that group of go-getter, non
ideological and highly successful gover
nors, described by Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt as "radical centrists."
Here's a Republican who supported and
signed a law divesting the state pension
fund of all stock in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa. Here's a Republican
who infuriates right-wingers and pro
lifers with his moderate state court ap
pointments.
If the Bushies decide to dub Kean as
No. 2 man, they will attract millions of
independents and rogue Democrats come
November.
Problem: Kean may be just too darn
liberal. For every swing vote he reels in,
one or two conservatives may be staying
home in disgust on election day.
Other names come to mind, of course,
but only one thing looks certain for No
vember: I'll probably like George Bush's
choice for VP a lot better than I liked
Ronald Reagan's.

No. 2 slot just might crash the Grand
Old Party.
Calif. Gov. George Deukmejian: 40-1.
The Bush band drools at the prospect of
Duke joining up. Based on his approval
ratings in this state, his squeaky-clean
and effective record, and, yes, his ethnic
name, Deukmejian could make the GOP
ticket a sure winner.
Problem: Duke simply can't leave. If
he became VP — a probable result if he
runs — he'd abandon the governor's of
fice to the lieutenant governor, liberal
Democrat Leo McCarthy.
So. Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell: 8-1.
Campbell has a big Bush lOU to cash in
and will probably be in a Bush cabinet
regardless. Why the IOU? The governor
endorsed Bush very early and worked
hard to hand Bush a win in the pivotal
South Carolina primary, held just three
days before Super Tuesday.
Problems: Campbell's a relatively un
known white conservative from a very
Southern state — all of which may repel
November's swing voters. Plus, Campbell
says he isn't terribly interested in VP-ine.
Who is?
Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexan
der: 3-1. Like Campbell, Alexander is a
politically attractive choice, if for no bet
ter reason than geography.
Since he's Southerner, he could cancel
out the benefits to Democrats of picking

Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., or Sen. A 1 Gore, D.-
Tenn., as Dukakis' running mate. Alex
ander is also a top prospect because he's
worked well with Democrats and has
made few enemies.
Problem: "Lamar who?"
New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean: 5-3. Kean
hails from that group of go-getter, non
ideological and highly successful gover
nors, described by Arizona Gov. Bruce
Babbitt as "radical centrists."
Here's a Republican who supported and
signed a law divesting the state pension
fund of all stock in companies doing busi
ness in South Africa. Here's a Republican
who infuriates right-wingers and pro
lifers with his moderate state court ap
pointments.
If the Bushies decide to dub Kean as
No. 2 man, they will attract millions of
independents and rogue Democrats come
November.
Problem: Kean may be just too darn
liberal. For every swing vote he reels in,
one or two conservatives may be staying
home in disgust on election day.
Other names come to mind, of course,
but only one thing looks certain for No
vember: I'll probably like George Bush's
choice for VP a lot better than I liked
Ronald Reagan's.
