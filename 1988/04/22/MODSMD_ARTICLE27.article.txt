## Bridging the language barrier 
### Grace Kim 
Hidden in the kitchens of Uni
versity Food Service are a deter
mined group of workers con
fronting their most difficult bar
rier at Stanford — English.
"I need this language to work
better, to know my rights, to be
able to obtain what I want —
to be someone more than I am,"
Food Service employee Sebas
tian Flores said.
Now Flores and 80 other Uni
versity employees are gaining
proficiency in English, thanks to
the Stanford Literacy Project.
Initiated two years ago, the proj
ect involved recruiting student
volunteers to teach Food Service
employees English while their
managers learned Spanish.
The nationally recognized
project has spearheaded the Uni
versity's campaign against il
literacy among its employees.
And as the second largest em
ployer in the Bay Area, Stanford
has the potential to help hun
dreds of its workers.
The project has grown from
working with 10 to now helping
81 employees overcome il
literacy. The number of volun
teer tutors has grown as well —
from 10 to a current staff of 76.
In two one-hour sessions per
week, employees and managers
"attend school" at Stanford in
dining halls and at the El Centro
Chicano. There they are tutored
on a one-to-one basis according
to their differing language abil
ities and needs.
Project Literacy is a "multi
cultural" experience where both
the University's students and
employees benefit, explained
Project Director Pedro Cas
tenada, a graduate student.
The advantages of the pro
gram are already more than ev
ident to Food Service Manager
Jolene McQuillen who said that
morale and efficiency had in
creased by "1,000 percent"
among both employees and man
agers who have participated in

the project.
Furthermore, Food Service
supervisors credited recent em
ployee promotions, in part, to
their increased fluency. Already,
Project Literacy participants
who work at Tresidder Union
and at Florence Moore Hall have
received promotions, the super
visors said.
Besides the occupational
benefits, Castenada said that
learning English has helped em
ployees feel more comfortable
with Stanford's environment.
Before Project Literacy got off
the ground, employees would
"do their job, get paid and leave,"
he said.
"Now they are interested in
Stanford because they have be
come friends with the student
tutors.. . . They feel more a part
of Stanford."
The language skills and needs
among employees vary, Project
Assistant Stephen Corder said,
explaining that some need to
learn the basics of English while

The project has
grown from working
with 10 to now help
ing 81 employees
overcome illiteracy.

"one employee wanted to know
the scientific names of the
thousands of trees on campus."
Tutors are learning from the
employees as well. Corder ex
plained that while teaching Eng
lish to a Hungarian woman, one
student volunteer learned about
his own Eastern European her
itage.
Because the tutoring program
takes place on campus, students
are also learning how easily they
can become involved with com
munity service. "The project
helps convey the message to stu
dents that community service

begins in one's own front yard,"
said Juan Yniguez, assistant
dean of student affairs.
Castenada recruits student
tutors, employees and managers
for the project at the beginning
of each quarter. Prospective
tutors fill out an information
sheet and are placed with a vol
unteer according to their time
schedules. Castenada encour
aged "anyone who wants to
tutor" to volunteer for the pro
gram.
Student volunteers can obtain
academic credit offered by the
undergraduate program for The
School of Education or monetary
compensation for their efforts.
Only half have chosen either op
tion.
But the pay-off for tutor
Caroline Glathe is a personal
one. "I have had all the advan
tages of an extensive educa
tion. ... I want to give back
some of what I have been for
tunate enough to receive," she
said.
