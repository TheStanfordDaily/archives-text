The Nobel Prize, named after
Alfred Bernard Nobel, is awarded
each year to individuals of out
standing achievement in the fields
of medicine and physiology,
physics, chemistry, literature,
peace, and economics. The
recipients of the prize are awarded
the interest on the $9,000,000 —
in 1986 about $290,000 — that
Alfred Nobel bequeathed in his
will for the establishment of the
Prize.

Alfred Nobel was born in 1833
in Sweden. He spent his youth in
Russia working in his father's fac
tory producing mines and tor
pedos. He later set up his own
plant for the manufacture of ex
plosives, where he researched
ways of making them less dan
gerous to use. In 1867, at age 34,
Nobel patented dynamite.
His new explosive was relatively
safe because it encased the dan
gerous nitroglycerin in an inert
substance. Because dynamite had
both military and commercial
uses — for example, in the mining
industry — Nobel soon became a
rich man.
Nobel died on Dec. 10, 1896,
leaving in his will money to be
used for the establishment of the
Nobel Prize.
The first Nobel Prizes were
given in 1901 in the fields of
chemistry, peace, literature,
physics, medicine, and chemistry.
Economics was added in 1969.
Not all who have been awarded
the prize have accepted it. The
Nobel Prize in Literature has
been turned down twice. In 1958,
Boris Pasternak turned down the
award due to coercion from the
Soviet government. Jean Paul
Sartre turned down the prize in

1964 because he did not want it
to affect his reader's appreciation
of his printed words.
