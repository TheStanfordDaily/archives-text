## Stanford filmmakers showcase their work in 'Filmworks '88' 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
Documentary film Prof. Ron
Alexander, who is retiring at the
end of spring quarter, has en
joyed his stay at Stanford even
though facilities here may not
have always been conducive to
the teaching of his craft.
"I have always felt that the
film program here has been
treated like a poor relative," Al
exander said. "I say that be
cause one of the biggest prob
lems I've had to cope with is
equipment which is outdated,
equipment which doesn't work.
It would have been better if I'd
had more financial support."
But the lack of University
support hasn't dampened Alex
ander's commitment to teach
ing, nor has it dimmed the cre
ative spirit of the students in
Stanford's graduate film pro
gram.
Tonight, Stanford's under
recognized, underloved Depart
ment of Communication gets to
toot its own horn as it presents
"Stanford Filmworks '88," a
second annual showing of films
by students, alumni and faculty
of the film program.
Stanford's graduate film pro
gram may not be as well-known
or have as big a name as UCLA
or USC, but that doesn't mean
that it goes unnoticed. One film
on tonight's two-hour screen
ing, "The Red Wagon," won the
1987 Student Emmy award for
Best Dramatic Film. Another,
"Wrong Place, Wrong Time,"
was the 1988 winner in the Best
of Category for Documentary
Short Subjects at the Golden
Gate Awards.

"This screening is a good rep
resentation of what the depart
ment is about and what it is
able to achieve," said Alexander.
Camilla Calamendrei, one of
the organizers of the screening,
said that tonight's program is
really a tribute to Alexander.
"For us, Ron is really the quin
tessential model of profes
sionalism, just of the attitude
it takes to be a really successful
and good filmmaker," Cala
mendrei said. "This small bit of
work is representative of what
he does."

The screening features two
award-winning films, "Pas de
Deux" and"Day After Day," for
which Alexander did the sound
re-recording when he worked
for the National Film Board of
Canada.
Also included on the program
are recent short films by grad
uate students in the film pro
gram.

"Filmworks '88" will be pre
sented today at 8 p.m. in Cub
berley Auditorium. Admission is
free.
