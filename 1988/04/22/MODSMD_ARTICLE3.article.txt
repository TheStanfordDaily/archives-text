# Jackson confirms visit
## Dukakis may join him at conference here in May 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse
Jackson will visit Stanford next month for
a one-day educational rights conference
that may also be attended by Massachu
setts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
Jackson "has definitely confirmed" that
he will appear at the May 14 conference,
said sophomore Cheryl Taylor, a member
of Stanford Students for Jackson and one
of the conference organizers. She said Du
kakis has been invited and has expressed
interest in attending.
Taylor said she hoped to hear from the
Dukakis campaign by the end of next week.
Jackson's visit will mark the second time
he has appeared at Stanford in little over

a year. He came to Stanford last year to
celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and
had planned to celebrate the same holiday
at Stanford again this year before sched
uling conflicts forced him to cancel his
appearance.
According to Taylor, the conference will
be sponsored by a coalition of ethnic mi
nority student groups, including the BSU,
the Asian-American Student Association,
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion and MEChA (a Chicano/Latino student
group).
The conference is designed to focus at
tention on educational issues, and Taylor
said the sponsor groups hoped to influence
the Democratic presidential candidates to
make education a larger campaign
issue.
Jackson, and Dukakis if he
decides to attend, will give
keynote addresses at the confer
ence. Conference organizers said
they will submit an "educational
agenda" to the candidates in the
hope that they will ''address the
concerns" of the sponsor groups,
Taylor said.
Graduate student David Drum
mond, chair of Stanford Students
for Jackson, said his group is "just
glad" Jackson is attending the
conference. If students are given
a chance to hear Jackson in per
son, they are likely to support
him, he said.
Although Drummond would not
rule out a last-minute cancellation
by Jackson, he did say that Jack
son is as "confirmed as he can

get."
Freshmen Sarah Gannett, co
chair of Students for Dukakis,
said she would be calling the Du
kakis campaign headquarters
today to ask if a decision had been
made about the planned visit.
Dukakis is "definitely going to
campaign in California," but it
has not been determined yet
whether he will visit Stanford,
Gannett said.
Students for Dukakis has been
trying to bring Dukakis to campus
for a rally, and Gannett said the
group would probably sponsor a
rally separate from the educa
tional conference if he attends.
Both Students for Dukakis and
Students for Jackson are trying
to round up support for the can
didates on campus, register voters
and sponsor informational meet
ings. The Dukakis group has
about 80 active members and the
Jackson group about 35, accord
ing to Gannett and Maria Laxo,
co-chair of the Jackson group.
