## 'Colors' told in black and white 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
I really wanted to like "Colors."
At first glance, it seems to have
all the ingredients of a great
movie: a path-breaking maverick
director like Dennis Hopper, who
has made his bread and butter
on refreshingly different films
such as "Easy Rider" and "Blue
Velvet"; an equally talented pro
ducer in Robert Solo (of "Bad
Boys" fame); and last — and most
important — a timely and com
pelling focus: the problem that
drugs pose to our society.
Like a trace-out drawing, the
film sketches out with a night
marish realism the brutality and
waste of human life so character
istic of gang wars.
Hopper introduces us to the ter
rifying world of the slums and
barrios of inner Los Angeles
through the battle between the
Crisps and the Bloods, two rival
gangs whose blue or red colors
identify them. The battlefields
and the gangland trenches are
etched in our minds by the scenes
of violent drive-bys and children
dealing crack in the schools.
Perhaps the best way of sum
ming up the problem with
"Colors" is that it is all style and
no substance. Hopper and Solo
painstakingly construct the hope
less, seedy atmosphere of the in
ner city slums, capturing the look,
the music and the street jargon.
Haskell Wexler's cinematography
is brilliant in capturing the ugly
reality of the barrio, with its
weed-choked hills. But the singu
lar flash of creativity comes from
his shots of the climactic action
scene, where a nighttime police
raid is seen from the perspective
of police helicopter.
However, despite its bitter aut
henticity, "Colors" is made disap

pointingly superficial by an ut
terly atrocious script. While the
continual orgy of violence ham
mers home the shocking impact
of drugs in the streets, Michael
Schiffer's screenplay fails to flesh
out the social and economic pres
sures that lead kids to see gangs
as the protection against a bleak
and otherwise hopeless world.
Schiffer builds this story of war
ring gangs on that most original
of devices, the old cop/young
rookie combo, Bob Hodges (Rob
ert Duvall) and Danny McGavin
(Sean Penn), who are part of the
Los Angleles Police Department's
CRASH (Community Resources
Against Hoodlums) unit. Hodges
(Duvall) and McGavin (Penn) are
polar opposites, and they enjoy a
trite pseudo-father/son relation
ship.

The primary flaw with the
film's writing is that it encourages
an "us vs. them" mentality.
Yet, oddly enough, the victims
who live in the shadow of the
violence aren't the "us." It's al
most as if they are somehow de
humanized in the film, lumped in
with the criminals. Rather, the
two policemen, Hodges and
McGavin, are the "us."
Without sufficient depth or
complexity in his characters, with
no sense of the personal or com
munity issues involved with the
drug problem, the movie is
reduced to soap opera dimensions.
Despite the promising talent put
together to make it, "Colors" be
comes nothing but an artistically
violent melodrama packaged in re
alistic clothing.
