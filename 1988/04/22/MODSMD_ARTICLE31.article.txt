"Above the Law"
Century Cinema 10
1500 Stielin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
"Above the Law" may be above
belief, but not above reproach.
Not to say that it is a bad movie,
it just wasn't what I was hoping
for. I would have enjoyed it more
in a differant frame of mind.
The gimmick of this film is that
the star, Steven Seagal, was
everything that his character is.
Well, almost. Seagal was never a
cop or a CIA agent, but he is a
master of Akido, was a body guard
for heads of state and was in
volved in the world of interna
tional security.
The movie's plot is minimal. It
has flaws, but it isn't a thin pas
tiche of action scenes. It lives in
a world of its own where family
and the church are sacred and
the patriarch rules with a large
gun.
Seagal plays the ex-CLA agent
turned cop believably. He seems
cold and hardened to the street.
What I had problems with was
when he tried to be a kind sensi
tive father, husband or confidant.
Maybe this was intentional,
maybe Seagal just can't seem like
a warm human being. These
sensitive scenes should have been
chopped.
This leaves the violence. Believ
able, tough, nitty gritty violence
is OK, but I couldn't like the char
acter of Toscani no matter how
much on the side of good his deeds
were.

"Appointment with Death"
AMC Sunnyvale Six
2604 Town Center Lane
Sunnyvale
"Appointment with Death" was
one of Agatha Christie's most
chilling and bizarre books. A story
about an evil manipulative
woman and her psychologically
dependent children, it was
promising material for a film. But
the film has been made with none
of the artistry, creepiness or
suspense of the novel. "Appoint
ment with Death" is an
amateurish, clumsy film, which
may account for the fact that 1
shared the theater with only two
other people.
The movie has all the right
pieces: a cast of stars, some spec

tacular desert landscapes, sensa
tional material to work from. But
it comes out like a long and es
pecially bad episode of the "Love
Boat" with a little murder thrown
in for spice. The scenes are all
short and nonsensical, the acting
is campy and exaggerated.
We have Piper Laurie (who
barks instead of speaking) as the
cruel (and doomed) stepmother.
We have several vapid male-model
types as her emasculated step
sons. We have Lauren Bacall as
a domineering noblewoman.
Bacall's performance is so grossly
overdone it's hard not to laugh
at her and wonder why she has
sunk so low. Or is this how she
has fun?
It's impossible to take this
movie seriously, and it's also im

possible to find it funny. The mys
tery never heats up, never grabs
us, and none of the characters
matter. The ship they sail on
could have sunk and I would not
have cared, and nor, I suspect,
would the actors who all seem to
be waiting for their next coffee
break. I can fairly say that the
"Love Boat" is more profound and
more fun to watch.

"Bad Dreams"
Meridian Quad
4400 Stevens Creek Blvd.
San Jose
To say "Bad Dreams" was a
nightmare would be charitable
and wrong. It was more like a
bad case of sleepwalking.
Cynthia wakes from a 13-year
coma brought on by a mass
suicide attempt by her com
mune/cult group. The leader of
the cult, Harris (Richard Lynch),
pours a bucket of gasoline (Jones
town overtures?) over the heads
of each disciple. He later lights
the gasoline and they all burn.
All die except Cynthia, who is
hesitant from the start about
burning with her friends and
going beyond. As the fire burns,
she is the only one to try to run.
Now she is awake and has to
undergo treatment to find out
why she and her friends wanted
to die. She has to face her personal
demons. Harris is one of those
demons and he doesn't want to
leave his "love child" behind.
This horror flick never builds
suspense. As each character trots

off followed by the evil Harris,
you know they are dead. Morbid
curiosity takes over as to how they
die, but there isn't any real ten
sion.

"The Manchurian Candidate"
Varsity
456 Univeristy Ave.
Palo Alto
A conspiracy to kill a national
leader? In case you haven't heard,
many researchers suspect that
John Kennedy, Martin Luther
King Jr. and others were victims
of right-wing conspiracies. And in
"The Manchurian Candidate," a
1962 film re-released this year,
fiction is as strange as truth.
It would be unfair to future
viewers to give away much of the
plot. Enough to say that it takes
off when American war hero
Raymond Shaw (Laurence Har
vey) returns from Korea. Bennet
Marco (Frank Sinatra) is Shaw's
commanding officer whose bizarre
nightmares involve Shaw and
other members of their patrol.
Marcos is driven by his dreams
to visit Shaw. From there twist
after suspenseful twist leads
through a web of brainwashing
and villainy to the exciting con
clusion.
The black-and-white film has
fine acting. Sinatra balances cool
ness with concern, and Harvey is
touching as the hopeless pawn.
Angela Lansbury's performance
as Raymond Shaw's right-wing
mother puts great drama into a
potentially melodramatic role.
But enough on the good points.

Recent reviews in other publica
tions play up the film's merits,
but no other review mentions the
film's implicit sexism and racism.
They all ignore the primping
submissiveness of Marco's and
Shaw's female companions.
Shaw's order to his new bride to
"make like a housewife," and her
smiling obedience, drew some
jeers from the audience when I
saw the movie, but none from the
press. Caricatures of East Asian
people as fiends and fools have
also escaped notice in print.
And there's political stereotyp
ing too. Although McCarthyist
tactics are attacked as dangerous
fanaticism, the film endorses fa
natical, McCarthy-esque ideas of
monolithic communism. The as
sassination conspiracy is the work
of evil-nasty-wicked Chinese and
Soviet communists. If JFK was
indeed killed by a rightist conspir
acy a year after the film's release,
the irony is sickening.
If you think my complaints are
irrelevant, that those prejudices
are bygones in U.S. art and life,
think again. Think of Fishbone
singing, "Lying-Ass Bitch" in
White Plaza, think of a Midwes
tern fraternity's recent "black
face" party, think of cinematic
propaganda like "Red Dawn" and
"Amerika," and you will remem
ber that prejudice lives on. Press
silence and personal silence feed
the disease.
Fantasy works best when it il
luminates the real world as it en
tertains. In its suspenseful way,
"The Manchurian Candidate" can
work fantastically.
