### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
OJAI, Calif. — Five out of six Stan
ford singles entries were eliminated
yesterday at the men's tennis Pacific
10 Conference Singles Champion
ships.
Sophomore Jeff Tarango, seeded
second, is the only Cardinal to sur-

vive into the quarterfinal round. Serving consis
tently well throughout, Tarango beat USC's Murphy
Jensen 6-4, 7-5 in the first round and overwhelmed
Arizona's John Schmidt 6-3, 6-2 in the second
round.
Tarango meets USC's Scott Brownsberger today
at 9 a.m.
An injury and close calls marked Stanford's five
losses in the Pac-10 division. David Wheaton, ranked
No. 2 in the nation, strained a hip flexor muscle
on his right side while lunging for a ball against
Brian Garrow. The Stanford freshman was forced
to default the second round match.
Wheaton, who also won't compete in the doubles
competition which starts today, was leading Garrow
6-1, 3-3. Wheaton whipped Arizona's Paul Landry
6-3, 7-5 in the first round.
"The injury isn't serious at all," Wheaton said.
"I'll take a few days off and play again pretty soon.
It's too bad because I was playing well and probably
would have done well in this tournament."
Trojan freshman Byron Black edged Stanfotrd
sophomore Jeff Cathrall in the first round 1-6, 7-6,
7-6. Cathrall rebounded from six match points and
a 5-1 third-set deficit before bowing to Black 8-6
in the final tiebreaker.
Freshman Martin Blackman also lost a squeaker,
falling to UCLA's Buff Farrow 7-5, 7-6 in the second
round. Blackman defeated California's Kurt Streeter
6-2, 6-1 in the first round.

bested Stanford freshman Glenn Solomon 6-3, 6-4
in the first round.
