# Three in quarterfinals

### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
"I OJAI, Calif. - The
way the Stanford
women's tennis
team has stock
piled injuries the
past couple of
J years, it's hard to

believe that tennis is a non
contact sport.
The Cardinal's latest victim is
freshman star Tami Whitlinger,
who was forced to withdraw here
yesterday from the Pacific 10 Con
ference Tennis Championships.
Whitlinger beat Arizona's
Nancy Breen 6-3, 6-2 in the first
round of the Pac-10 singles tour
nament yesterday afternoon, but
in the process she reaggravated a
muscle pull in her right groin and
decided to default her second
round match against UCLA's
Stella Sampras.
Even with Whitlinger's depar
ture, the Cardinal still managed
to place three players — Lisa
Green, Kay Title and Teri Whit
linger — in this morning's quar
terfinal matches.
Tami Whitlinger initially suf
fered a groin injury a week ago,
but she was able to play last week
end against UCLA and USC. "It
was really sore after the week
end," she said. "I played Monday
and it was bothering me again,
so I didn't practice Tuesday or
Wednesday."
Whitlinger said she didn't move
as quickly as usual in her victory
over Breen. In addition, the cool
and windy conditions here yester
day made it difficult for her to
get loose.
"I kept thinking of Eleni," said
Whitlinger, referring to teamate
Eleni Rossides, who suffered a

season, every little
injury is annoying.'

Frank Brennan

similar injury in similar weather
conditions over two months ago
and has not played since.
"She's been out for so long, it
just scares me."
With the NCAA Tournament
less than a month away, there's
no sense in taking any risks with
Whitlinger, Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. "At this point in
the season, every little injury is
annoying," he said.
Stanford's hopes for a Pac-10
singles title now rest with Green,
Tittle and Teri Whitlinger.
Tittle won with surprising ease
against Arizona's Susan Russo, 6-
2, 6-0, in the first round. But her
second round match against Cal
ifornia's Sharon Fletcher turned
into a three-hour, three-set mar
athon that her ailing right knee
barely survived.
All three sets went to tie
breakers, with Tittle winning the
first and Fletcher capturing the
second.
Throughout the final tie
breaker, Tittle hobbled on her
right knee, but she persevered for
a 7-6 (8-6), 6-7 (4-7), 7-6(7-4) vic
tory.
Tittle is pitted in a 9 a.m. quar
terfinal match today against
USC's Lupita Novello, whom she
beat 7-5, 6-1 last weekend at Stan
ford.

Teri Whitlinger took the opposite road to the
quarterfinals, playing a tight first round match and
then winning in straight sets in her afternoon
match. The Cardinal freshman first outlasted USC's
Stephanie Harges 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, and then beat
UCLA's Maria LaFranchi 6-3, 6-2.
Whitlinger had been flawless (20-0 in dual
matches) prior to a trying pair of matches last
weekend against UCLA and USC, when she lost
6-0, 6-0 to the Bruins' Kirsten Dreyer and won a
sloppy 3-set match against the Trojans' Anya Koc
hofT.'
"After my loss to UCLA, I think I was pretty
shaken," Whitlinger said. "This morning 1 was kind
of shaky, my confidence was kind of low. ... I felt
a lot better this afternoon. I'm going into tomorrow
feeling good."
Whitlinger will not only have to feel good but
she will have to play very well to win her quarterfinal
match today against USC's Trisha Laux, the top
seed. "It (a win) would be great for my ranking,
so I'll just have to get pumped up," Whitlinger said.
Green battles UCLA's Dreyer in the quarterfinals
today, following straight-set victories yesterday over
Cal's Kay Louthian and USC's Stephanie London.
London knocked out Stanford's Cindy Buchsbaum
6-1, 6-1, in the first round.
The Cardinal's other entry in the Pac-10 singles,
Sandra Birch, beat Arizona's Jackie Ranger 6-0,
6-0, before succumbing in a well-played match
against UCLA's Jessica Emmons, 6-4, 6-3.
In the Women's Collegiate Invitational Singles,
Can Hagey and Valerie Wilson advanced to today's
quarterfinals.
Doubles action begins this morning. Whitlinger-
Whitlinger have been scratched, leaving Hagey-
Birch and Tittle-Green as the Cardinal's two entries.


Freshman Taml Whitlinger, Stanford's top contender for the Pacific
10 Conference singles crown, withdrew from the competition yes
terday due to Injury.

ture, the Cardinal still managed
to place three players — Lisa
Green, Kay Title and Teri Whit
linger — in this morning's quar
terfinal matches.
Tami Whitlinger initially suf
fered a groin injury a week ago,
but she was able to play last week
end against UCLA and USC. "It
was really sore after the week
end," she said. "I played Monday
and it was bothering me again,
so I didn't practice Tuesday or
Wednesday."
Whitlinger said she didn't move
as quickly as usual in her victory
over Breen. In addition, the cool
and windy conditions here yester
day made it difficult for her to
get loose.
"I kept thinking of Eleni," said
Whitlinger, referring to teamate
Eleni Rossides, who suffered a

similar injury in similar weather
conditions over two months ago
and has not played since.
"She's been out for so long, it
just scares me."
With the NCAA Tournament
less than a month away, there's
no sense in taking any risks with
Whitlinger, Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan said. "At this point in
the season, every little injury is
annoying," he said.
Stanford's hopes for a Pac-10
singles title now rest with Green,
Tittle and Teri Whitlinger.
Tittle won with surprising ease
against Arizona's Susan Russo, 6-
2, 6-0, in the first round. But her
second round match against Cal
ifornia's Sharon Fletcher turned
into a three-hour, three-set mar
athon that her ailing right knee
barely survived.
All three sets went to tie
breakers, with Tittle winning the
first and Fletcher capturing the
second.
Throughout the final tie
breaker, Tittle hobbled on her
right knee, but she persevered for
a 7-6 (8-6), 6-7 (4-7), 7-6(7-4) vic
tory.
Tittle is pitted in a 9 a.m. quar
terfinal match today against
USC's Lupita Novello, whom she
beat 7-5, 6-1 last weekend at Stan
ford.

Teri Whitlinger took the opposite road to the
quarterfinals, playing a tight first round match and
then winning in straight sets in her afternoon
match. The Cardinal freshman first outlasted USC's
Stephanie Harges 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, and then beat
UCLA's Maria LaFranchi 6-3, 6-2.
Whitlinger had been flawless (20-0 in dual
matches) prior to a trying pair of matches last
weekend against UCLA and USC, when she lost
6-0, 6-0 to the Bruins' Kirsten Dreyer and won a
sloppy 3-set match against the Trojans' Anya Koc
hofT.'
"After my loss to UCLA, I think I was pretty
shaken," Whitlinger said. "This morning 1 was kind
of shaky, my confidence was kind of low. ... I felt
a lot better this afternoon. I'm going into tomorrow
feeling good."
Whitlinger will not only have to feel good but
she will have to play very well to win her quarterfinal
match today against USC's Trisha Laux, the top
seed. "It (a win) would be great for my ranking,
so I'll just have to get pumped up," Whitlinger said.
Green battles UCLA's Dreyer in the quarterfinals
today, following straight-set victories yesterday over
Cal's Kay Louthian and USC's Stephanie London.
London knocked out Stanford's Cindy Buchsbaum
6-1, 6-1, in the first round.
The Cardinal's other entry in the Pac-10 singles,
Sandra Birch, beat Arizona's Jackie Ranger 6-0,
6-0, before succumbing in a well-played match
against UCLA's Jessica Emmons, 6-4, 6-3.
In the Women's Collegiate Invitational Singles,
Can Hagey and Valerie Wilson advanced to today's
quarterfinals.
Doubles action begins this morning. Whitlinger-
Whitlinger have been scratched, leaving Hagey-
Birch and Tittle-Green as the Cardinal's two entries.


Freshman Taml Whitlinger, Stanford's top contender for the Pacific
10 Conference singles crown, withdrew from the competition yes
terday due to Injury.
