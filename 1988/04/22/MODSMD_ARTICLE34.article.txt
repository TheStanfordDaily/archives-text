# Johnson wears two hats going into critical series
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
One day early this week,
t Brian Johnson was stand
ing in line for lunch in the
Sterling Quad dining hall.
On his head was a Stan
ford baseball cap; sticking
out of the bag in his left

hand was a football.
It was a telling scene, because Johnson
is living an athletic double life these days.
Every afternoon, he heads to Sunken
Diamond to practice baseball for an hour
and a half, then goes to spring football
practice for about three-and-a-half hours.
It's a tiring schedule, but Johnson, a
sophomore from Oakland, says he
wouldn't have it any other way. "I really

just enjoy playing both," he said. "It's a
challenge to play both. There's so much
teaching when you're younger to play
one sport and be the best at that one
sport. I don't necessarily think that's
true — I'm not ready to go to one sport."
Spring football began last week and
lasts five weeks. This is the second
straight spring that Johnson has played
baseball and practiced football at the
same time.
This time around, however, the stakes
are a bit higher. On the baseball Held,
the Cardinal, with Johnson starting in
left field most of the season, is locked in
a free-for-all for the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division title (a battle which
hinges on this weekend's series with
league-leading Arizona State at Sunken
Diamond); on the football field, Johnson

is fighting to keep the starting quarter
hack position he earned midway through
last season.
He can't afford to sacrifice one sport
for the other.
Johnson is easy-going and friendly, but
he doesn't quibble about this point.
"There's a battle for my position (in foot
ball)," he said. "I want it. Right now, I
have it, and it's something I don't want
to lose. Three guys are competing with
me and I don't want to give up.
"With (Jason) Palumbis, (Scott) Stark
and (Greg) Ennis, the talent we have at
quarterback is very good — if I'm not
there, I might lose [the position]."
Stanford baseball Coach Mark
Marquess understands Johnson's situa
tion. Marquess was a two-sport athlete
himself as a Stanford undergraduate —

earning All-America honors as a first
baseman and playing three years of foot
hall as a quarterback, split end, defensive
back and punt returner — and several
of his baseball players (including John
Elway, Toi Cook and Walt Harris) have
crossed over from the gridiron.
"It's fine," Marquess said of Johnson's
double duty. "I'm different — most base
ball coaches probably wouldn't feel this
way . . . but I don't think that [practicing
football] has affected the way he's playing
. . . especially as a quarterback, where
he's not getting pounded like an interior
lineman might."
If anything, Marquess said, playing
both sports probably helps Johnson.
" This is the time of year when players
might start feeling some pressure,"
Marquess said. "Brian doesn't have the

time to do that."
Johnson wouldn't be at Stanford if
Marquess and football Coach Jack Elway
weren't willing to cooperate and allow
him to split time between the two sports.
In his senior year at Oakland's Skyline
High School, Johnson was one of the
most hotly recruited athletes in the na
tion. He was named the California High
School Athlete of the Year his sophomore,
junior and senior years, and was named
the state's baseball Player of the Year
his last two years in high school.
He was Skyline's starting quarterback
for three years, and threw for 1,207 yards
and 20 touchdowns in his senior year.
On the diamond, he batted .544 over his
last three years and set state records for
