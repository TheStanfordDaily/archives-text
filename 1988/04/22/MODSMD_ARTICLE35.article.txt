What a differ
ence a year
makes.
The annual
Sun Devil/
Thunderbird
Invitational

tournament in Phoenix, Ariz.,
usually draws some of the
finest men's golf teams in the
country. This year is no excep
tion, with all three of the top
ranked teams competing.
Last year, Stanford finished
last, and was nearly not invited
to compete again in this year's
contest. With another year's
worth of experience under its
belt in 1988, however, the team
has shown that it can compete
with the best of them. They
stand tied with Oklahoma for
sixth place after the first round
of the 54-hole tournament.
"The difference between this
year and last is encouraging.
It shows what a difference a
year'B experience can make,"
said sophomore Brad
Benbrook, who led the Cardi
nal with a one-over-par 73.
Fellow sophomore Josh
Zander also shot 73, and helped
Stanford get a team score of
375 for the day. Zander's round
was marked by its ups and
downs. He scored well on the
first nine, but was beginning
to falter until the 14th hole.
On the par-4, 385 yard 14th,
he holed a 130-yard approach
shot for an eagle. After that,
his confidence was restored and

he scored even par on the
remaining four holes.
Defending national cham
pion and top-ranked Oklahoma
State humbled the 6,900 yard,
par-72 McCormick Ranch Golf
Club, with an incredible team
score of nine-under par 351.
Its nearest competitors, Ari
zona and Arizona State, are 13
and 14 shots back, respectively.
Four golfers are tied for the
individual lead at three-under
par 69: Arizona's Mike
Springer, Oklahoma State's
Kevin Wentworth, UCLA's
Kevin Leach and Oklahoma's
Tom Stankowski.
All the Stanford golfers man
aged solid scores inthe first
round, despite "miserable con
ditions on the front nine," ac
cording to Benbrook. Sopho
more Brad Joondeph, who led
Stanford to seventh place in
its own tournament two weeks
ago, shot 74. Sophomore Mark
Funseth fired a 77, while junior
teammate John Mahon carded
a 78.
The golfers were happy with
their performances today, but
the feel that they can definitely
improve in the next two
rounds. "We should do better
because the conditions couldn't
be any worse tomorrow,"
Benbrook said.
Joondeph echoed his fellow
sophomore's sentiments, but
added a note of caution. "We
don't want to press, but if we
hold our position it will be a
great finish for us," he said.
