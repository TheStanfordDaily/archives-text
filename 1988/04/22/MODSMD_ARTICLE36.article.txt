# Olesen wishes the Farm farewell

### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Marc Olesen is hoping to leave his
mark in the track and field record
books this Saturday at the Stanford
Twilight meet. In what would other
wise be a rather inconspicuous meet,
the fifth-year senior will take aim at
both Jim Beattie's 26-year-old Stan-

ford Stadium 1,500-meter record and the Canadian
Olympic qualifying standard.
The Twilight meet, which was moved up to an
11 a.m. start, will be the team's last home meet of
the season and Olesen's final shot at the stadium
record. The fifth-year senior broke Jeff Atkinson's
school record with a run of 3 minutes, 40.82 seconds,
last weekend, but missed his Olympic mark of
3:37.92 and Beattie's record of 3:39.9. As he will
be doubling in the 1,500 and 5,000 meters against
California next week and probably also at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships, this is likely to be
his best shot at the Olympic mark. "I'm rested this
week, so hopefully that will make the difference,"
he said.
Olesen will not be the only one shooting for Seoul,
as the 1,500 will feature a special seeded heat.
Stanford graduate Atkinson will return for the race
in an attempt to qualify for the U.S. Olympic trials
and senior Steve Schadler will be racing to beat
the NCAA Championship qualifying time of 3:42.20.
Converted to a mile time, the target for this race
will be an amazing 3:53.
In Lisa Bernhagen and Brian Marshall, Stanford
also has a pair of Olympic-caliber high jumpers
competing this weekend. Both are competing in
their final home meet.
Bernhagen set the NCAA indoor record last year
at six feet, five-and-a-half inches, but sprained her
ankle early this season and has spent much of this
year trying to regain that form. According to Stan
ford Coach Brooks Johnson, she will be invited to
the U.S. Olympic trials due to a leap of 6-IV4 during
the indoor season.
Marshall, like Olesen, is Canadian and will be
jumping for an Olympic bid as well as preparing
to meet Cal's Mike Harris and Jeff Rogers next
week in Berkeley.
This meet will be the last of a series of home
meets that included the Stanford Holiday Inn Track
and Field meet and three low-key events.
