Four Toyon residents drank
themselves silly last night.
The drinkers — carefully su
pervised by Stanford Police of
ficers and Cowell Student
Health Center officials — were
watched by a roomful of stu
dents as they participated in a
demonstration of the short-term
effects of alcohol.
The program was created by
senior Bret Lizundia, a Toyon
resident assistant, in an attempt
to "do something in the dorms
that could both give the police
and Cowell a chance to give in
formation on health and legal
implications of being drunk, as
well as displaying the decline in
performance of cognitive and
motor skills as a result of pro

gressive intoxication," he said.
The four participants, seniors
Gordon Craig and Rosemarie
Day and juniors Mark Hat
zilambrou and Karen Jacobson
— all of legal drinking age —
imbibed drinks ranging from
White Russians to shots of rum.
They were then led through a
series of sobriety tests, includ
ing the standard tests used by
Stanford Police officers when
they suspect drunk driving.
Aside from the police
administered tests, the partici
pants were subjected to multi
plication tests, divided attention
tests, Simon (an electronic
memory game) and Pole Posi
tion (a video driving game).
Cowell representatives were
on hand to discuss both the
long-term effects of alcohol and
its prevalence in society, espe

cially at colleges.
"The Pole Position scores in
creased slightly, but all of the
participants said they were
going faster and more likely to
take risks," said sophomore
G.G. Ross, who was monitoring
the game. "They were off the
road more, weaved more, and
crashed more."
The police demonstrated tests
ranging from checks for a nys
tagmus — a rapid, jerking mo
tion of the eye — to the classic
straight line test.
The officers explained, to the
surprise of many students, that
California's 0.1 legal limit is not
the only guideline for a drunk
driving charge. A driver who has
a .05 blood alcohol level or
higher and who appears obvi
ously drunk can also be ar
rested.
