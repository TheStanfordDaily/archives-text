# Spikers cap off season
## No. 13 Cardinal hosts WIVA rivals 49ers, Aztecs 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
All good things
must come to an
end. And, as the
Stanford men's
volleyball team
hopes, so must
everything else.

The Cardinal — which saw six
of the eight players with starting
experience on last year's team
graduate, transfer or defect to the
Olympic team — has struggled
this season. Although the team
has been ranked 12th or 13th na
tionally all year, that is just not
good enough in a league with six
of the country's top seven teams.
Stanford now brings its 10-18
record (4-12 in the Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion) into the season's final week
end. Stanford hosts Long Beach
State tonight and San Diego State
tomorrow night at Maples Pavil
ion. Both matches begin at 7:30
p.m.
The Cardinal is currently in
eighth place in WIVA, one-and-a
half games ahead of San Diego
State, and needs one victory to
clinch sole position of that spot.
Long Beach saw its hopes of post
season play go out the window
Wednesday when the 49ers lost a
five-game match to fifth-ranked
UCLA.
Long Beach defeated Stanford
four weeks ago in a very hard
fought four-game match in Long
Beach, but Stanford Asst. Coach
Ruben Nieves feels the Cardinal
is prepared for the rematch.

'I know we're a bet
ter team now than
we were when we
played San Diego
State than when we
played Long Beach
State.'
— Ruben Nieves

"I know we've improved
steadily throughout the season,"
he said. "I know we're a better
team now than we were when we
played San Diego State, than
when we played Long Beach
State."
The 49ers are still a very good
team, however. "Long Beach has
been playing a lot of teams very
tough," Nieves continued. "They
have a real solid lineup. They put
six very strong players on the
court."
The top players for "The
Beach" are middle blocker Brett
Winslow and outside hitters John
Brajevic and Mark Kerins.
Winslow is among the league
leaders in many statistical
categories, and Brajevic and
Kerins are "two outside hitters
who are one of the strongest pairs

in the conference," according to
Nieves.
"They both go up and hit the
ball very hard," he added. "One
of our goals is to slow those two
down."
Sophomore Craig Forsyth
thinks Stanford can shut them
down. "We put a lot of emphasis
on their middle attack (in the first
match)," he said. "I think that
left them a lot of opportunities
outside. They had some big bangs
down there,
"This time we'll try to put more
emphasis on their outside guys,
their big guns. Their middle is
pretty good, too, though."
Tomorrow's match will likely
be more of the same. The Aztecs
are led by freshman Hugh Foster,
who was perhaps the top fresh
man in WIVA. "I think Hugh
Foster is a very good player,"
Nieves said, "but I haven't seen
him get to the point where he
can dominate a WIVA match. He
can't win and lose matches by
himself."
Stanford edged the Aztecs in
San Diego early in the season,
but, again, it appears to be an
almost even matchup. "They're
capable of playing really well,"
Nieves said. "It was a close four
game match down there."
Leading the way for Stanford
are middle blockers Forsyth and
Dan Hanan, another sophomore.
Hanan has exceeded his billing as
a third-team preseason Ail-
American and Forsyth has ad
justed very well to a new position.

Forsyth began the year as the
team's starting right-side hitter,
but Coach Fred Sturm moved him
to a middle blocker position five
matches ago.
Forsyth, who will go along with
"whatever's best for the team,"
has upped his level of play since
the switch.

"Craig has done a really good
job in the middle for us," Nieves
said. "He's been one of our
steadiest players since then."
Forsyth is currently eighth in
WIVA in hitting percentage,
thanks mainly to his last few
matches. "It's hard because I ha
ven't been doing it (playing in the

middle) for a while," he said, .
but Fred (Sturm) thinks it gives
us a better rotation out there. It's
all right with me.
"They're both good teams,"
Forsyth said. "They're both kind
of young but have a lot of talent,
[they're] pretty big ... [but] I
think we should win both games."
