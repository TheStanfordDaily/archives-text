# Gymnast enters with nothing to lose
## Amoroso off to NCAAs 
### Karen Gryler Staff writer 
Cyndi Lauper expressed
it best — "Some girls just
want to have fun!" That's
the attitude of gymnast
Dina Amoroso entering
tonight's NCAA Champi
onships in Salt Lake City.

Amoroso realizes she has nothing to
lose at this competition. Having ad
vanced to the NCAA meet is itself a
high honor for the sophomore, and
Amoroso's No. 4 ranking in the individ
ual all-around is an unprecedented
achievement for a Stanford gymnast.
Amoroso has been looking forward to
tonight for a long time — competing at
NCAAs has been a personal goal for her
collegiate career. Consequently, she has
no expectations for the meet, only to
have a "good experience." For Amoroso,
that means enjoying herself and "hitting
four sets out of four."
Those four sets Amoroso speaks about
— her vault, bars, beam and floor
routines — will contain some of the
most difficult tricks of the entire meet.
Her full Tsukahara vault is the most
daring trick performed on this event in
collegiate competition. Additionally,
Amoroso's power-packed floor routine,
in which she uses a double-full twist as

her final tumbling pass (most gymnasts
can muster up this difficult trick on
only their first or second tumbling run),
will help Amoroso in her bid for a top
finish.
The format of the meet will also be
favorable to Amoroso, unlike the pro
gram that led to the Cardinal's difficul
ties two weeks ago at the regional meet.
Because of her high ranking, Amoroso
will be able to compete in the later ses
sion of the meet as opposed to an earlier
one. This becomes a positive factor be
cause the scores generally rise through
out the day.
Now Amoroso's worst enemy may be
a lack of confidence. Even though she
won't have the pressure of having to
hit a routine for the team, Amoroso
concedes she'll "probably still be nervous
because it's nationals."
To ease her trepidation, she has been
discussing what an NCAA meet is really
like with Stanford gymnasts that have
been in that situation before, including
sophomore transfer Mamie Rader and
the entire men's team. With their en
couraging words and the support of the
entire women's team and her coaches,
Amoroso feels mentally prepared to
make her debut as a national champi
onship competitor. Now all that's left
is for her to go out and do it.
