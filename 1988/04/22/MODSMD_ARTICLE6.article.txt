# ASSU debates overseas balloting
## BSU fee loss triggered 'unfair' post-election voting, commissioner says 
### Michael Lenz 
After discovering earlier this week
that absentee ballots were not collected
from students overseas for last week's
ASSU election, some members of the
ASSU are now accusing the senate of
deciding to send those ballots only be
cause of their possible effect on the
BSU's fee assessment request, which

narrowly failed in the election.
"If [the BSU] had lost by a larger
margin or had won [its] fee assess
ment," the senate would not have in
sisted on sending the overseas ballots,
said Election Commissioner Steve Baer.
Although the BSU's fee assessment
request was rejected by eight votes in
regular voting, shortly after the polls
closed election officials realized thev had

failed to send any ballots to students
overseas.
At its meeting Tuesday night, the
senate decided not to validate the elec
tion results until it receives the overseas
ballots, which Baer said he will send
out Monday. Students at the overseas
campuses will have two days to fill out
the ballots once they receive them.
The ballots must be returned
in time to be counted on May 2,
when election results are sched
uled to be certified at the next
regularly scheduled senate meet
ing.
BSU members are now lobbying
the roughly 225 Stanford stu
dents abroad in order to raise the
extra votes needed to pass their
fee request, BSU member Canetta
Ivy said.
Council of Presidents member
Leonard Adler charged that cam
paigning overseas is against ASSU
rules and "grounds for dis
qualification" from consideration
of fee requests.
Adler said he sees the senate's
decision to send the ballots as no
more than "a way for the BSU

to get its fee."
"Whoever has lost [the election]
should take that loss," said Adler,
who was running for re-election
as a member of the COP slate
the Energizers, which lost in last
week's voting.
The senate is "bending rules so
people can get what they want,"
Adler said, adding that pressure
was "probably" put on senators
by the BSU to find a "loophole"
to gain another chance to secure
passage of their fee request.
However, COP member-elect
Stacey Leyton disputed Adler's
claim and said the BSU's actions
are legal.
Ivy, who along with Leyton is
also a member of the new COP
slate A New Slate of Mind, denied
that the senate was influenced by
the BSU in making its decision.
The ASSU "sent the ballots .. .
because it was the constitutional
thing to do."

If they had decided not to collect
ballots abroad, the senate's only
other option would have been to
invalidate the election results and
hold a new election, said graduate
senator Don Gagliardi, who said
this choice would have been
"highly inefficient."
Gagliardi initially proposed the
amendment that postpones
validation of election results until
the overseas ballots are received.
"We had to say, 'We made a mis
take,' and correct that mistake
with a minimal amount of effort
and cost," Gagliardi said.
Although Baer said he is "com
pletely against" the senate's de
cision, Baer said he is forced to
to accept it because he sees no
alternative.
If a new election was held be
cause overseas ballots were not
collected, "I think the student
body would be fed up. No one
would vote and it would be a
travesty," Baer said.
