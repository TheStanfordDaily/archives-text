## BSU fee loss triggered 'unfair' post-election voting, commissioner says

After discovering earlier this week
that absentee ballots were not collected
from students overseas for last week's
ASSU election, some members of the
ASSU are now accusing the senate of
deciding to send those ballots only be
cause of their possible effect on the
BSU's fee assessment request, which

narrowly failed in the election.
"If [the BSU] had lost by a larger
margin or had won [its] fee assess
ment," the senate would not have in
sisted on sending the overseas ballots,
said Election Commissioner Steve Baer.
Although the BSU's fee assessment
request was rejected by eight votes in
regular voting, shortly after the polls
closed election officials realized thev had

failed to send any ballots to students
overseas.
At its meeting Tuesday night, the
senate decided not to validate the elec
tion results until it receives the overseas
ballots, which Baer said he will send
out Monday. Students at the overseas
campuses will have two days to fill out
