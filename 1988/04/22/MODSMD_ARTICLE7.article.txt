# Latino community struggles to restructure its top leadership
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Latino commu
nity wrestled with an identity
crisis last night.
At issue in a three-hour discus
sion among various Latino groups
at Casa Zapata was a fundamental
question of organizational struc
ture: Should campus Latinos have
an overarching leadership, one
voice that will attempt to speak
for the community as a whole?
Currently, various wings in the
community address particular
concerns. Two groups are at the
heart of the organizational

debate:
• MEChA, a Chicano/Latino
group that is one of the "big four"
politically progressive ethnic
orgnizations on campus, along
with the Black Student Union,
the Asian-American Student As
sociation and the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization. MEChA
does not claim to represent the
entire community.
• The Stanford Latino Student
Alliance Committee, a group that
is seeking to establish itself as an
umbrella organization for the en
tire community. The SaLSA Com
mittee is not related to SaLSA, a
two-year-old service that acts

solely as a banker, distributing
funds to several small Latino
groups without acting as an ide
ological voice for the community.
Some Latino leaders prefer that
there be no locus of power in the
community in order to accomo
date a wide range of viewpoints.
Others, however, believe that the
Latino community can only effect
change through a unified voice —
similar to that of the BSU in the
black community.
At a fiery meeting early in Jan
uary, MEChA and the SaLSA
Committee split over the unified
leadership question. MEChA has
in the past opposed unification,
while the SaLSA Committee has
pushed for it.
However, most now agree that
better administration is needed to
link the various Latino groups
here.
In last night's meeting, the
several groups present received
two proposals — one from mem
bers of the SaLSA Committee and
one from a representative of
MEChA — that will be voted on

by the Latino community at a
meeting May 16.
The SaLSA Committee proposal
would, in effect, create a Latino
community representative — a
chair of an elected board similar
to the position of BSU chair.
The MEChA proposal, on the
other hand, would not concen
trate the force of the Latino com
munity in the voice of a single
person, but would set up a body
to provide administrative support
for the various Latino groups.
Last night, the restructuring
issue was not on the official
Latino community meeting
agenda, but was raised by senior

Rudy Fuentes, a member of the
SaLSA Committee. Fuentes once
chaired MEChA and was a leader
in the January split.
The SaLSA Committee proposal
contends that the Stanford Latino
community needs a "structure
with a diverse perspective" that
is "elected by all Stanford Latino
students" to "assure a compara
tively better voice for the commu
nity."
The proposal points to the
recent growth of the Latino com
munity and a need for "continuity
and accountability" as the pri
mary factors behind the proposed
establishment of a community
leadership structure.
The SaLSA Committee proposal
calls for an eight-member board
of "organizational, service and ad
ministrative representatives" to
be elected by the Latino commu
nity. It also seeks to establish an
umbrella committee of Latino
group leaders to "allow direct in
put by the active Latino student
community through Latino or
ganization representatives."

Representatives of MEChA
have also submitted a proposal to
members of the Latino communi
ty. The MEChA proposal calls for
an umbrella committee similar to
the SaLSA Committee format but
does not establish a separate
board of elected officials. Instead,
it would establish four positions
— two treasurers, a secretary and
a publicity commissioner — to
handle the administrative
needs of the Latino community.
Both the SaLSA Committee and
MEChA proposals stress the need
for regular Latino community
meetings to serve as forums for
different views and as links be
tween the numerous Latino com
munity groups on campus.
Senior Lucky Gutierrez, co
coordinator of MEChA, said his
group's proposed administrative
structure would not serve as a
power structure for the Latino
community. Instead, it would es
tablish a "way to coordinate ac
tivities, facilitate discussion of is
sues and allocate resources," he
said.
