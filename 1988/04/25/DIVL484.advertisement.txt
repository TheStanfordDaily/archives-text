The way some banks treat you, it's hard
to work up any interest in your checking
account.
Minimum balances are absurdly high.
• Interest rates are miserably small. Or
worse, nonexistent.
Home Federal will treat you better. With
our interest-earning SelectChecking SM
account. There's no minimum balance.
And no per check charges. Just a low,
flat monthly fee.
We also give you a free safe deposit
box. Free checks.
Movie discounts.
