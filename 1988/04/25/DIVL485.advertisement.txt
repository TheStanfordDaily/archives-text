"DU" is not Delta Upsilon
The chartcr of the Stanford Chapter of Delta Upsilon
Fraternity was suspended last year, because of intolerable
behavior by the chapter. Thus ended -- for the moment -- 90
years of Delta Upsilon history at Stanford University.
There is a group on your campus that calls itself "DU". It
has no connection with Delta Upsilon Fraternity. None of the
men who are pledge or join "DU" will ever be members of
Delta Upsilon Fraternity, nor will they ever benefit from the
advice of more than 60,(XX) Delta Upsilon alumni.
Members of the Stanford Chapter of Delta Upsilon -- all
of them alumni - have also made it clear that they will in no
way assist men who involve themselves with "DU".
If you are interested in joining a fraternity chapter with
lies to an international fraternity, "DU" is not it. Its members
and no one else are responsible for the actions of "DU". Delta
Upsilon hopes to be represented in the future at Stanford, but
in no way will a revived Delta Upsilon chapter resemble what
you may know as "DU".
Freshmen men, associate with "DU" at your own risk.
