# Stanford's South African options
## Divestment, disinvestment and decision-making in University policy 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
At the peak of nationwide ac
tivism protesting South Africa's
racist apartheid regime, 1,000
Stanford students in April 1985
rallied outside the office of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy, urging Stanford's total di
vestment from companies with
business interests in South Africa.
Since then, activism has waned
and, with the University Board
of Trustees' decision against total
divestment, other approaches to
hasten the end of apartheid have
been discussed. Without one easy
solution, the South Africa issue
has evolved into a complex sub
ject, complicated by the array of
players, terms and policy alterna

tives.
Two primary bodies determine
Stanford's stance against apart
heid.
The first of the two, the Com
mission on Investment Responsi
bility, reviews shareholder resolu
tions and then presents its rec
ommendations to the second, the
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility, a sub-group of the
Stanford Board of Trustees. The
SCIR then votes on each resolu
tion, bearing in mind the CIR rec
ommendations.
The CIR, co-chaired by Freder
ick Hillier, a professor in Opera
tions Research, and Kirk Hanson,
a lecturer in the Graduate School
of Business, was formed by former
University President Richard
Lvman in 1977. The CIR consists

of 12 students, alumni and faculty
members.
In the past, the CIR has advised
the trustees on various invest
ment decisions concerning com
panies engaging in nuclear arms
sales, slave labor and drug sales.
Since 1985, however, the CIR has
only advised the trustees on in
vestments in South Africa.
The SCIR plays the key role in
shaping the University's relations
with corporations having eco
nomic ties with South Africa.
Chaired by Ted Mitchell, a Uni
versity trustee and a professor of
education at Dartmouth College,
the six-member SCIR uses the
CIR recommendations as guide
lines in making investment policy
