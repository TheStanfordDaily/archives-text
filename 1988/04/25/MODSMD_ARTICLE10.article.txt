# Stanford's South African options
## Divestment, disinvestment and decision-making in University policy 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
At the peak of nationwide ac
tivism protesting South Africa's
racist apartheid regime, 1,000
Stanford students in April 1985
rallied outside the office of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy, urging Stanford's total di
vestment from companies with
business interests in South Africa.
Since then, activism has waned
and, with the University Board
of Trustees' decision against total
divestment, other approaches to
hasten the end of apartheid have
been discussed. Without one easy
solution, the South Africa issue
has evolved into a complex sub
ject, complicated by the array of
players, terms and policy alterna

tives.
Two primary bodies determine
Stanford's stance against apart
heid.
The first of the two, the Com
mission on Investment Responsi
bility, reviews shareholder resolu
tions and then presents its rec
ommendations to the second, the
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility, a sub-group of the
Stanford Board of Trustees. The
SCIR then votes on each resolu
tion, bearing in mind the CIR rec
ommendations.
The CIR, co-chaired by Freder
ick Hillier, a professor in Opera
tions Research, and Kirk Hanson,
a lecturer in the Graduate School
of Business, was formed by former
University President Richard
Lvman in 1977. The CIR consists

of 12 students, alumni and faculty
members.
In the past, the CIR has advised
the trustees on various invest
ment decisions concerning com
panies engaging in nuclear arms
sales, slave labor and drug sales.
Since 1985, however, the CIR has
only advised the trustees on in
vestments in South Africa.
The SCIR plays the key role in
shaping the University's relations
with corporations having eco
nomic ties with South Africa.
Chaired by Ted Mitchell, a Uni
versity trustee and a professor of
education at Dartmouth College,
the six-member SCIR uses the
CIR recommendations as guide
lines in making investment policy
decisions.
The SCIR makes the Universi
ty's final investment decisions
dealing with South Africa-related
companies.
Confused terms often are bar
riers to the public in understand
ing the decision-making process.
The two most common actions
related to stocks and South Africa
are "disinvestment" and "divest
ment."
Disinvestment from South
Africa calls for a company to sell
all its ownership interests — such
as a corporate subsidiary or main
branch — to the local company
management or workers, or to the
government. Thus the company
"withdraws" from South Africa.
Divestment calls for an institu
tion like Stanford to sell all its
holdings in a corporation with
economic ties in South Africa in
a symbolic gesture of "washing
one's hands clean" of a company
that in some way "supports" the
apartheid regime.
In this decade, CIR and SCIR
members have agreed that total
divestment would result in a loss
of leverage over companies in
South Africa.
"If we sell our stock, we have
no more influence," Hanson said.

Under a selective divestment
policy, the University has divested
from only eight to 10 corporations
with records of social irrespon
sibility, as measured by the Sul
livan Principles, in conducting
business in South Africa.
The Sullivan Principles are
criteria established in 1984 by the
Rev. Leon Sullivan that are used
to rate a company's actions in
working for change of the apart
heid system.
Though Sullivan has since
denounced the policy for its case
by-case approach, several institu
tions — including Stanford — still
adhere to his guidelines.
Instead of accepting divestment
as its chief policy, the SCIR has
endorsed selective disinvestment.
Under this policy, the trustees
evaluate on a case-by-case basis
whether or not a company's con
tinued presence in South Africa
can effect positive change. When
the net effect of a company's pres
ence is negative, the University
urges the corporation to disinvest
by voting "yes" on shareholder
withdrawal resolutions.
If a company ignores repeated
requests for disinvestment from
shareholders, the University then
considers divestment, Hanson
said.
Shareholder resolutions, or so
cial proxy resolutions, are initi
ated by stockholders to encourage
change in their corporation's so

cial or economic policies, and all
shareholders may vote on such
resolutions. However, the compa
ny's board of directors is not
obliged to abide by the mgyority
opinion of the shareholders.
In February, the CIR recom
mended a significant policy shift.
Pushing for a blanket disinvest
ment policy, the CIR concluded
that the net effect of any corpo
ration's presence in South Africa
can only be negative.
The CIR acknowledged that
some corporations do provide
benefits for non-whites, such as
anti-discriminatory employment
and funding for social programs.
Nevertheless, it argued that cor
porate investments in South
Africa legitimize the apartheid
regime.
The CIR encouraged the trus
tees to support all shareholder
resolutions calling for withdrawal
from South Africa.
In March, the SCIR nonetheless
decided that the University will
continue to evaluate each with
drawal resolution individually.
But the trustees also decided that
Stanford will either vote "yes" or
abstain from voting on the resolu
tions; the University now may not
reject a withdrawal resolution.
With this policy, the University
"allows companies to make their
case" for their presence in South
Africa while telling companies,
"We think it's time for all com

panies to rethink their position
on South Africa," Mitchell said.
While the CIR did not succeed
in securing a blanket disinvest
ment policy, Hanson said the CIR
will continue to urge the SCIR
"to take a stronger stance" on
apartheid by adopting the blanket
policy of approving all withdrawal
resolutions.
Shareholder resolutions this
spring have included not only de
mands for corporate withdrawal
but also calls for "severing all eco
nomic ties" with South Africa.
Companies like IBM, which dis
invested from South Africa last
year, often continue to distribute
their products through locally
owned subsidiaries. Hanson char
acterized such corporate disin
vestments as "sham with
drawals."
Earlier this month the trustees
decided that IBM should sever all
economic ties with South Africa.
But decisions on how the Uni
versity should act on resolutions
asking for "no economic ties" can
vary, as recent examples prove.
General Electric sold its three
South African subsidiaries to its
South African managers in 1986,
but it continues to distribute
"light industrial products"
through Genwest Industries, the
new locally owned company.
GE also provides news coverage
of events in South Africa through
NBC television, which it owns.

The CIR recommended last
week that GE "cease all activities
in South Africa that are not di
rectly related to the company's
network news services."
In this case, the CIR decided
to encourage the SCIR to "not
vote" on the shareholder resolu
tion calling for "no economic ties"
because NBC news coverage pro

vides white South Africans and
the international community in
formation about the "daily
atrocities committed under the
apartheid regime."
The SCIR is expected to vote
on the resolution this week. Han
son predicted the SCIR would vote
according to the CIR recommen
dation.

dealing with South Africa-related
companies.
Confused terms often are bar
riers to the public in understand
ing the decision-making process.
The two most common actions
related to stocks and South Africa
are "disinvestment" and "divest
ment."
Disinvestment from South
Africa calls for a company to sell
all its ownership interests — such
as a corporate subsidiary or main
branch — to the local company
management or workers, or to the
government. Thus the company
"withdraws" from South Africa.
Divestment calls for an institu
tion like Stanford to sell all its
holdings in a corporation with
economic ties in South Africa in
a symbolic gesture of "washing
one's hands clean" of a company
that in some way "supports" the
apartheid regime.
In this decade, CIR and SCIR
members have agreed that total
divestment would result in a loss
of leverage over companies in
South Africa.
"If we sell our stock, we have
no more influence," Hanson said.

Under a selective divestment
policy, the University has divested
from only eight to 10 corporations
with records of social irrespon
sibility, as measured by the Sul
livan Principles, in conducting
business in South Africa.
The Sullivan Principles are
criteria established in 1984 by the
Rev. Leon Sullivan that are used
to rate a company's actions in
working for change of the apart
heid system.
Though Sullivan has since
denounced the policy for its case
by-case approach, several institu
tions — including Stanford — still
adhere to his guidelines.
Instead of accepting divestment
as its chief policy, the SCIR has
endorsed selective disinvestment.
Under this policy, the trustees
evaluate on a case-by-case basis
whether or not a company's con
tinued presence in South Africa
can effect positive change. When
the net effect of a company's pres
ence is negative, the University
urges the corporation to disinvest
by voting "yes" on shareholder
withdrawal resolutions.
If a company ignores repeated
requests for disinvestment from
shareholders, the University then
considers divestment, Hanson
said.
Shareholder resolutions, or so
cial proxy resolutions, are initi
ated by stockholders to encourage
change in their corporation's so

cial or economic policies, and all
shareholders may vote on such
resolutions. However, the compa
ny's board of directors is not
obliged to abide by the mgyority
opinion of the shareholders.
In February, the CIR recom
mended a significant policy shift.
Pushing for a blanket disinvest
ment policy, the CIR concluded
that the net effect of any corpo
ration's presence in South Africa
can only be negative.
The CIR acknowledged that
some corporations do provide
benefits for non-whites, such as
anti-discriminatory employment
and funding for social programs.
Nevertheless, it argued that cor
porate investments in South
Africa legitimize the apartheid
regime.
The CIR encouraged the trus
tees to support all shareholder
resolutions calling for withdrawal
from South Africa.
In March, the SCIR nonetheless
decided that the University will
continue to evaluate each with
drawal resolution individually.
But the trustees also decided that
Stanford will either vote "yes" or
abstain from voting on the resolu
tions; the University now may not
reject a withdrawal resolution.
With this policy, the University
"allows companies to make their
case" for their presence in South
Africa while telling companies,
"We think it's time for all com

panies to rethink their position
on South Africa," Mitchell said.
While the CIR did not succeed
in securing a blanket disinvest
ment policy, Hanson said the CIR
will continue to urge the SCIR
"to take a stronger stance" on
apartheid by adopting the blanket
policy of approving all withdrawal
resolutions.
Shareholder resolutions this
spring have included not only de
mands for corporate withdrawal
but also calls for "severing all eco
nomic ties" with South Africa.
Companies like IBM, which dis
invested from South Africa last
year, often continue to distribute
their products through locally
owned subsidiaries. Hanson char
acterized such corporate disin
vestments as "sham with
drawals."
Earlier this month the trustees
decided that IBM should sever all
economic ties with South Africa.
But decisions on how the Uni
versity should act on resolutions
asking for "no economic ties" can
vary, as recent examples prove.
General Electric sold its three
South African subsidiaries to its
South African managers in 1986,
but it continues to distribute
"light industrial products"
through Genwest Industries, the
new locally owned company.
GE also provides news coverage
of events in South Africa through
NBC television, which it owns.

The CIR recommended last
week that GE "cease all activities
in South Africa that are not di
rectly related to the company's
network news services."
In this case, the CIR decided
to encourage the SCIR to "not
vote" on the shareholder resolu
tion calling for "no economic ties"
because NBC news coverage pro

vides white South Africans and
the international community in
formation about the "daily
atrocities committed under the
apartheid regime."
The SCIR is expected to vote
on the resolution this week. Han
son predicted the SCIR would vote
according to the CIR recommen
dation.
At the peak of nationwide ac
tivism protesting South Africa's
racist apartheid regime, 1,000
Stanford students in April 1985
rallied outside the office of Uni
versity President Donald Ken
nedy, urging Stanford's total di
vestment from companies with
business interests in South Africa.
Since then, activism has waned
and, with the University Board
of Trustees' decision against total
divestment, other approaches to
hasten the end of apartheid have
been discussed. Without one easy
solution, the South Africa issue
has evolved into a complex sub
ject, complicated by the array of
players, terms and policy alterna

tives.
Two primary bodies determine
Stanford's stance against apart
heid.
The first of the two, the Com
mission on Investment Responsi
bility, reviews shareholder resolu
tions and then presents its rec
ommendations to the second, the
Special Committee on Investment
Responsibility, a sub-group of the
Stanford Board of Trustees. The
SCIR then votes on each resolu
tion, bearing in mind the CIR rec
ommendations.
The CIR, co-chaired by Freder
ick Hillier, a professor in Opera
tions Research, and Kirk Hanson,
a lecturer in the Graduate School
of Business, was formed by former
University President Richard
Lvman in 1977. The CIR consists

of 12 students, alumni and faculty
members.
In the past, the CIR has advised
the trustees on various invest
ment decisions concerning com
panies engaging in nuclear arms
sales, slave labor and drug sales.
Since 1985, however, the CIR has
only advised the trustees on in
vestments in South Africa.
The SCIR plays the key role in
shaping the University's relations
with corporations having eco
nomic ties with South Africa.
Chaired by Ted Mitchell, a Uni
versity trustee and a professor of
education at Dartmouth College,
the six-member SCIR uses the
CIR recommendations as guide
