# Fraternity Rush goes smoothly
## IFC cites a few minor alcohol-related infractions this year 
### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
Fraternities concluded their
annual recruitment process yes
terday, closing out their much
scrutinized three-week Rush
without mishap.
As invitations to join fraternal
organizations, known as bids,
are distributed today, fraternity
leaders and University officials
say they are pleased with the
conduct of this year's Rush.
Only a few infractions of In
terfraternity Council regula
tions marred what Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons
deemed a "good omen for the
IFC." Lyons has been highly cri
tical of fraternity Rush in recent
months because of the IFC's
refusal to adopt a completely
dry Rush.
The Feb. 16 release of the
Report of the Task Force on
Fraternities and Sororities and
the March 2 Interfraternity
Council decision to allow the
serving of alcohol at Rush func
tions brought more attention
than ever to the process.
Also, the death of Zeta Psi
member David Dunshee during
last year's Rush had the Uni
versity on the lookout for Rush
problems, especially those re
sulting from alcohol abuse.
But Fraternal Affairs Adviser
Joe Pisano said Rush this year

was void of serious flaws. "I'm
not aware of any prob
lems," Pisano said. "Overall, it
went well."
Pisano added that police were
not called in to control any party
due to noise complaints or
rowdiness. "It was less disrup
tive to the community in gen
eral."
All weekday Rush functions
were closely monitored by the
IFC Executive Committee for
adherence to IFC regulations.
Sigma Chi President Charlie
Ahern described the monitoring
as "excellent and consistent."
Lyons agreed, saying the "IFC
took its policy very seriously this
year."
Although no msyor problems
occured, the IFC fined four fra
ternities for breaking IFC reg
ulations, according to IFC Vice
President Stuart Levy. The Al
pha Delta Phi, Phi Delta Theta,
Theta Delta Chi and Theta Xi
fraternal chapters were fined
amounts between $100 and
$150 each for rule infractions
such as serving alcohol past
11:30 p.m., serving beer during
the designated dry week and
having a party on an undesig
nated night.
Levy said these infractions
were not of a very serious na
ture, but the IFC "wanted to
make a point."

Ahern said this year's Rush
went more smoothly than any
he has experienced in his four
years of fraternal involvement.
He added that his fraternity had
"no problems with alcohol."
"[ Lyons! had a lot of fears
about this Rush, and I don't
think they were realized," said
Ahern, a junior.
Students were required to
show current Stanford identifi
cation to be admitted to Rush
parties, similar to other Stan
ford parties, but were also re
quired to sign a guest book at
the door.
Once inside, rushees were not
served alcohol after 11:30 p.m.
This rule was enacted last year
so students who were rushing
would not disturb other resi
dents in their dorms by return
ing loudly after dorm quiet
hours.
Lyons said he received fewer
complaints from resident fel
lows concerning the "drunken
ness and loudness of students"
this year than in the past.
Also, fraternities followed the
partially dry alcohol policy
adopted a year ago.
Only beer and wine were
served the first week. No alcohol
was served during the second
week. Any beverage could be
served during the third and final
week of Rush.
