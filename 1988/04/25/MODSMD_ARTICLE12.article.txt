U.S. to reduce support in Korea
SEOUL, South Korea — The Reagan ad
ministration plans to ask South Korea to raise
its monetary support for U.S. military forces
based on the Korean peninsula, according to
U.S. and South Korean sources.
The move comes as new political and mili
tary factors are prompting Washington and
Seoul to begin weighing key changes in their
security relationship. In the past year, officials
in both capitals have started speaking publicly
about eventually reducing the number of U.S.
troops in South Korea while giving Seoul full
operational control over its own forces in war
time.
There are currently about 43,000 U.S. troops
in South Korea. A U.S. general has operational
control over the South's forces in wartime. At
a time of greater Korean nationalism, these
high-profile symbols of America's presence
here have drawn criticism from varying quar
ters.
But the evolution in Seoul's military rela
tionship with Washington stems mainly from
several other developments, officials here say.
Unlike Washington's NATO allies, who face
low economic growth and are unable or un
willing to pick up more of the defense tab,
South Korea's economy is booming.
U.S. may use Coast Guard in Gulf
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion is considering assigning Coast Guard pa
trol boats to help U.S. naval forces protect
shipping in the Persian Gulf, Adm. William
Crowe, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
yesterday.
Crowe told an interviewer that the Pentagon
may use the boats to guard against future
aggression in the gulf by the badly damaged
Iranian fleet, which he said is now reduced
to carrying out speedboat attacks, such as one
it launched against a Saudi Arabian-owned
tanker earlier yesterday. That attack slightly
damaged the 37,011-ton Sea Trader but caused
no injuries to the crew, the tanker's skipper
reported.
"The Coast Guard has a patrol boat that is
particularly appropriate for (defending
against) those types of operations," Crowe said
during an appearance on the CBS television
program "Face the Nation."
Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci, ap
pearing on ABC's "This Week With David
Brinkley," said that use of Coast Guard vessels
would free the Navy's larger ships for other
missions, but he confirmed Crowe's statement
that no decision had yet been made on their
use.
Arafat visits Syria to see Assad
DAMASCUS, Syria — Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat returned to
Damascus for the first time since he was
humiliatingly deported in 1983 and yesterday
received a rousing welcome from delighted res
idents of Syria's biggest Palestinian refugee
camp.
In brief remarks last night outside his of
ficial guest house, Arafat said that, "God will
ing," he would meet President Hafez Assad
and he made clear that his return was due to
the prestige of the Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Assad and Arafat broke relations five years
ago, when the PLO leader was bundled un
ceremoniously aboard a Tunis-bound airliner
from Damascus. Arafat's remarks after arriv
ing here appeared to suggest that Assad had
little choice in accepting reconciliation.
Arafat told newsmen: "Together we shall
march forward until the flags of the Arab
nations fly over every Palestinian house,
mosque and church."
