# Soviet economy slumped badly last year
## Annual report to Congress ties downturn to increased Soviet arms control efforts 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Soviet eco
nomy slumped badly last year and the
short-term prospects for resumed
growth are not favorable, apparently
dooming consumers to continued aus
terity and perhaps even retarding the
development of new weapons, U.S. in
telligence agencies reported yesterday.
The CIA and the Pentagon's Defense
Intelligence Agency, in their annual
report to Congress, said that the eco
nomic squeeze could explain Moscow's
interest in negotiating an arms control
treaty with the United States, which
could reduce the cost of the arms race.
The report said that the economic
reforms instituted by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev had failed to
produce their intended results. In
many cases, the report said, the re
forms may have damaged economic
production by introducing changes
that the economy was not ready to

absorb.
"Almost all sectors of the economy
(in 1987) failed to match the gains
achieved in 1986," the report said.
"After registering a modest increase
in 1986, industrial growth dipped to
1.5 percent .. . (and) agricultural out
put was down 3 percent from 1986's
record level."
"The short-term outlook for growth
certainly is not good," the CIA and
DIA added. "Meeting the targets es
tablished for the 1988 plan, for exam
ple, would require Soviet GNP (gross
national product) growth of nearly 8
percent. This seems clearly beyond
reach. Given the disruptions that Gor
bachev's programs are causing and are
likely to continue causing for the next
few years, we project average annual
growth of 2 percent or less for the
rest of this five-year plan" which runs
through 1990.

For the time being, at least, the
report predicted that Gorbachev would
try to maintain Soviet defense spend
ing, which currently claims between
15 percent and 17 percent of GNP, a
much higher share than that in other
industrialized nations.
"National security is a particularly
sensitive area for the leadership, and
Gorbachev probably would be reluc
tant to leave himself open to charges
of weakening Soviet defenses by push
ing reforms or resource shifts that
many in the military leadership op
pose," the CIA and DIA said.
Nevertheless, the report said, Gor
bachev's goals for civilian industrial
growth almost certainly would require
diverting some resources from the
defense sector.
"Any investment forgone in weapons
plants to supply tooling for civilian
production could delay the introduc

tion of future weapons programs but
would not be likely to slow current
output," the report said.
It added that "defense industrial
participation in the civil modernization
program is unlikely to affect weapons
production capabilities, at least for the
next few years."
Nevertheless, the intelligence agen
cies said that Moscow appeared to be
seeking arms control accords that
would restrain Soviet defense spending
and provide compensating cuts in U.S.
weapons programs.
"The Soviets could reap some eco
nomic benefits from arms control,
given the provisions of the recently
signed INF (Intermediate Nuclear
Forces) treaty and the type of reduc
tions envisioned from a START (Stra
tegic Arms Reduction Treaty) accord,"
the report said.
