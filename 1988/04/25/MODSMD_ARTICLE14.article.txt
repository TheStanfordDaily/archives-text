# Carlucci studies proposal to scale back SDI program
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci is re
viewing a recommendation that
he sharply cut the proposed initial
deployment of "Star Wars" anti
missile defenses from a system of
space-based weaponry to a less
costly and much less effective sys
tem of ground-based rockets, ac
cording to senior Pentagon offi
cials.
A high-level panel directed by
Robert Everett, chair of the Pen
tagon's senior scientific advisory
group, has told Carlucci that such
a limited, ground-based defense
is worth pursuing as an initial
step toward the more elaborate,
space-based system being
developed by the Strategic
Defense Initiative Organization.
Carlucci said yesterday the
panel of "technicians and en
gineers . . . has told me that the
(SDI) program is fundamentally
sound and that we can build a
militarily effective SDI pro
gram. . . . That is a goal." His
remarks on ABC News' "This
Week With David Brinkley" fol
lowed a Washington Post report
yesterday on a congressional
study's assessment that space
based defenses could "suffer a cat
astrophic failure" the first time
they were used.
Carlucci declined to comment
directly on the study by Congress'

Office of Technology Assessment,
which has not been publicly re
leased. But he said calling the SDI
program unworkable now is "like
saying that helicopters were
doomed to failure ... 10 years
before we had helicopters."
Should Carlucci adopt the
private recommendation of his ex
pert panel, it could mark another
scaling back of SDl's immediate
goal, which has already been
reduced from President Reagan's
1983 vision of a "space security
shield" for U.S. cities to a system
capable of momentarily protecting
vital military installations against
an attack by a fraction of the
existing Soviet nuclear arsenal.
The panel report, completed a
week ago after an intensive study
ordered by Carlucci last Decem
ber, said a system of ground-based
anti-missile rockets could be
deployed sooner and easier than
the more ambitious system of
hundreds of space- and ground
based weapons now planned for
SDl's initial phase.
The panel also said such a
deployment, probably costing less
than $15 billion, would give the
military valuable know-how
before it tackled the more ambi
tious, space-based scheme at a
likely cost of $150 billion.
