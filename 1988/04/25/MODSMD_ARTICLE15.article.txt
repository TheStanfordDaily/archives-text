# Mitterrand leads Chirac
## Finishes ahead in 1st round of French election 
### 
PARIS — President Francois Mitter
rand finished far in front in the first
round of the French presidential election
yesterday and called on all voters to
help him defeat Premier Jacques Chirac,
the battered and distant runner-up, in
the final round in two weeks.
The mathematics of the first round
results appeared to favor Mitterrand, a
Socialist, in the May 8 runoff. But most
of the attention of French political com
mentators on national television focused
less on the possible future victory of
Mitterrand than on the surprising total
of votes amassed in the first round by
extreme right candidate Jean Marie Le
Pen.
Le Pen, who exploited a wave of
French resentment against North
African immigrants in his histrionic
campaign, finished in fourth place with
14 percent of the vote, just a few per
centage points behind the two main con
servative candidates, Chirac and former
Premier Raymond Barre.
With 75 percent of the 31 million
votes counted at midnight, Paris time,
the returns showed: Mitterrand 34.5
percent; Chirac, 19.43 percent; Barre,
16.82 percent; Le Pen, 14.21 percent;
Communist Andre Lajoinie, 6.72 per
cent; and one environmental and three
leftist candidates, 8.33 percent.
A few minutes after television projec
tions predicted that Mitterrand and
Chirac would face each other in the
runoff, Barre, in a joint television ap

pearance with Chirac, pledged his full
support to the latter and called on his
backers to switch their vote to the pre
mier in the second round.
But neither the 55-year-old Chirac nor
his main backers could hide their dis
appointment that he had taken no more
than perhaps 20 percent of the vote and
would need far more than Barre's sup
port to overtake the 71-year-old Mitter
rand in the second round.
Le Pen, who called his score a "true
political earthquake and a radical trans
formation of the national landscape,"
said that he would tell his supporters
at a massive May 1 rally in Paris ded
icated to the memory of Joan of Arc
what he wanted them to do in the runoff.
But much of the Le Pen vote is re
garded as a protest vote coming from
all over the political spectrum, and most
French political anaJysts believe that
half of these voters, no matter what Le
Pen says, will either abstain or vote for
Mitterrand May 8.
It was not clear whether an outburst
of violence in the French South Pacific
territory of New Caledonia on the eve
of the election had helped swell the total
of Le Pen's votes. Some television com
mentators speculated that voters, an
gered by the killing of three French
gendarmes Friday by Melanesian
separatists in the territory, might have
switched to Le Pen, but this was difficult
to assess.
