# Aliens flood INS offices as amnesty deadline nears
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES - Hundreds of
thousands of undocumented aliens,
galvanized by a May 4 deadline for
applications for legalized status under
a one-year amnesty program, have
begun to flood federal legalization of
fices as policy-makers argue over ex
tending the deadline.
Figures compiled by the U.S. Immi
gration and Naturalization Service
show that 165,813 applications, a 69
percent increase from the previous
month, were filed in March, and that
April applications are being submitted
at an even faster pace.
The March applications for amnesty
for regular immigrants and agricul
tural workers were the most since Sep
tember and confirmed INS expecta
tions that it will face a deluge of ap
plications in the final days of the am
nesty period. "The last day is going

to be like income-lax time at the post
office," said Herbert Ebaugh, a
legalization officer at the amnesty of
fice in Arlington, Va., that serves
Washington-area immigrants.
According to INS press representa
tive Jerry Ficklin, 1,634,737 illegal
aliens had filed for amnesty through
Wednesday. Estimates of the total
number of eligible aliens differ widely,
and critics of the one-year amnesty
program have argued that the May 4
deadline will cut off many who could
have applied.
The House has passed a seven
month extension of the deadline, but
Senate approval of the extension is
considered doubtful since the original
amnesty bill's chief Senate sponsor,
Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., opposes
it. A press representative for Simpson

said the number of amnesty applicants
was surpassing estimates furnished by
the Congressional Budget Office and
Latino groups when the bill was first
drafted, an indication to Simpson that
the new law is a success.
Patrick Burns, assistant director of
the Federation for American Immigra
tion Reform (FAIR), called the effort
to extend the deadline "a cruel joke"
that will only confuse aliens who
should be submitting their applica
tions. "I think every newspaper in the
country should run a box every day
that says, 'so many days until the
amnesty deadline,' as they do with 'so
many days until Christmas,'" he said.
INS officials have announced plans
to leave legalization offices open until
midnight May 4. A representative of
the INS Western regional office said

all applicants in line at midnight will
be taken care of.
Magdalena Watkins, chief legaliza
tion officer for the INS office on Hol
lywood's Wilshire Boulevard, said the
number of applicants has increased 30
to 40 percent in recent weeks. Some
indicate they delayed because of diffi
culty collecting the proper proof that
they have lived in the United States
since before Jan. 1, 1982, as required
by the Immigration Reform and Con
trol Act of 1986. Others said they
needed time to save money for the
application fee, which is $185 per per
son or $420 per family.
INS has announced that applicants
who submit an application and fee
before the deadline will be allowed a
minimum of two more months to pres
ent supporting documents.
