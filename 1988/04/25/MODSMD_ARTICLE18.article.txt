A HEARTY WELCOME to
Igor, Sergei, Volodya and all
the Soviet students visiting
Stanford this week. Your visit pro
vides an invaluable opportunity for
students here to learn about the
Soviet Union in a way never before
possible.
The 12-student contingent ar
rived here Thursday night for an
eight-day stint, one of the first
times the Soviet Union has allowed
its students to visit a university
in the United States.
The visit closes what has been
a very successful first year for the
Stanford-Soviet Exchange Project.
In order to coordinate the ex
change, organizers had to over
come obstacles from conflicting
school schedules to the tenuous
international climate. But with a
lot of effort (and, arguably, luck),
12 Stanford students were able to
travel to the Siberian tundra this
March and 12 Novosibirsk stu
dents were able to see the Flicks.
The dozen Stanford students
represented a broad range of in
terests, majors and class levels.
Before the trip, they studied Soviet
culture and society so that during
their stay they could absorb as
much about everyday Soviet life
as they could.
The Soviet contingent, however,
consists solely of students inter
ested in technical fields such as
mathematics, chemistry and biol
ogy. Their trip, in contrast to the
American aim of learning and un
derstanding Soviet culture and so
ciety, focuses more on comparing
Soviet and American approaches
to higher education.
But despite the different make
up and apparently dissimilar goals
of the American and Soviet groups,
the same gains of mutual under
standing can only result on both
sides.
The Soviets are learning about

the academic aspects of this Uni
versity by attending lectures and
classes, but the bulk of their time
has been scheduled for social and
cultural programs.
So far, they have visited San
Francisco, attended the musical
"Jesus Christ Superstar," gone to
several campus parties and toured
several dorms. In addition, they
plan to attend more dorms and
participate in an all-campus pre
sentation tomorrow night.
All of these activities have been
planned so that the general Stan
ford community — not just those
associated with SSEP — can be
come involved. For instance, on
Saturday morning students in
Florence Moore Hall took the
Soviets to Safeway to buy food for
brunch. These activities have al
lowed Soviet and Stanford stu
dents to learn things about each
other that no textbook can teach.
Other programs in the dorms
are planned for this week, provid
ing more opportunities for stu
dents to come into close contact
with the Soviets and understand
their perspective on a gamut of
issues, whether it be arms control
or the latest fashions.
The point is that no topic of
discussion is really more important
than the other; the real benefits
will come from the face-to-face
encounters that most students will
likely never have the opportunity
to experience again.
With the international scene as
unpredictable as it is, exchanges
such as this should not pass un
noticed, because they are so subject
to the diplomatic whims of the su
perpowers.
Take time to visit with the
Soviets. Ask about their lives as
students and share some of your
experiences. Don't miss this
unique opportunity.
