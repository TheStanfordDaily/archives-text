## Kennedy's remarks unfair to College Republicans 
### 
IN RESPONSE to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's April 19
remarks during his debate with
U.S. Secretary of Education William
Bennett on the McNeil-Lehrer News
Hour, we wish to express our discord
with and disapproval of their implica
tions.
At one point, McNeil addressed
Bennett's allegation that intimidation
had been a determinant in the Faculty
Senate's decision to adopt the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values curriculum.
President Kennedy flatly rejected the
secretary's claim.
Bennett countered by stating, "I
asked, 'Did anyone sense any intimida
tion?' And voices started coming out
from the audience, 'I did. I did. I did,'
until there was a very loud chorus."
Kennedy responded, "I'm not sur-

prised. . . . The occasion was con
structed by the Young Republican
Club. Those who were assenting to
that view, I think, wanted very much
to please [Secretary Bennettl."
His implication that the Stanford
College Republicans stacked the audi
ence or that the program was or
chestrated by the College Republicans
had no basis. The College Republicans
had a minimal role in the planning
and execution of the program.
Although the College Republicans
were a co-sponsor of the event, the
club was not even mentioned in either
the Daily advertisement for the pro
gram or the fliers publicizing the event
to all members of the Stanford com
munity.
The Stanford College Republicans
has 300 members. Perhaps 100 of

these members were present — but
this is a generous estimate. This
clearly would not, and did not, con
stitute a minority or even a dominant
voice in the crowd of over 800 that
attended the program.
The majority of the questions asked
following Bennett's speech were di
rected in criticism of Bennett's
remarks — certainly representing a
variety of views.
The moderator did not field ques
tions exclusively from conservative
members of the audience. He welcomed
a variety of questions. Kennedy did not
attend the program. It seems doubtful
that he was qualified to fairly judge
the composition of the crowd.
Most importantly, the positive
response to Bennett's question "Did

anyone sense any intimidation?" should
not be discounted in spite of Ken
nedy's remarks and those of History
Prof. Paul Seaver, who felt his speech
Monday had an excessively "Republican
event atmosphere."
The reality is that there are College
Republicans who oppose the views
expressed by Bennett. We simply object
to being caught in the cross fire and
being used as a scapegoat by the presi
dent of the University.
We respect President Kennedy.
However, we do feel that an apology is
in order.
