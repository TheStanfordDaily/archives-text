# Renegade DUs defy University

Two years after the Delta Up

from campus, the DUs continue
to hold rush and are thriving
despite continual University dis

Even though they are no longer
recognized by either the Univer

Delta Upsilon fraternity in In
dianapolis, an estimated 65 DU

DU member threw a burning
couch out the third-story window
of the fraternity's house.

punishment once again after the
terms of the suspension were bro

University policy, according to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano.

in continuity" of the fraternity,
Pisano said. "(But) they have per
sisted in organizing."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last night that if cur
