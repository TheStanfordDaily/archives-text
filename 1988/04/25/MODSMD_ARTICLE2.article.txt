# Renegade DUs defy University
## 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
Two years after the Delta Up
silon fraternity was suspended
from campus, the DUs continue
to hold rush and are thriving
despite continual University dis
ciplinary actions against them.
Even though they are no longer
recognized by either the Univer
sity or the national chapter of
Delta Upsilon fraternity in In
dianapolis, an estimated 65 DU
members will be offering about
15 bids to freshmen today.
University officials admit that
they have no jurisdiction over the
group as long as it conducts ac
tivities off-campus and does not
use University resources.
DU rush events this year have
included both on- and off-campus
parties, outings to baseball games,
a bar night and a dance at Club
Afrique in East Palo Alto. The
group has a president and rush
chairmen, and charges dues of be
tween $100 and $150.

A five-year suspension was im
posed on the fraternity two years
ago after an accumulation of dis
ciplinary problems over a four
year period, culminating when a
DU member threw a burning
couch out the third-story window
of the fraternity's house.
University officials effectively
extended the suspension an addi
tional two years by beginning the
punishment once again after the
terms of the suspension were bro
ken this year. The DUs held and
advertised a rush, which is against
University policy, according to
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano.
"The terms of the suspension
stated that there would be a break
in continuity" of the fraternity,
Pisano said. "(But) they have per
sisted in organizing."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said last night that if cur
rent problems continue, it "raises
questions about the fraternity
ever returning" to campus.
An advertisement appearing in
Friday's Daily titled "Attention
Freshmen Men: 'DU' is not Delta
Upsilon" dissociated the national
organization from any connection
with the DUs.
Reacting to the ad, Pisano said:
"It seems the national organiza
tion wants no part of being asso
ciated with them. They are as
eager as the Universfty (to be dis
sociated)."
A DU member who requested
anonymity said the DUs in fact
would "rather not be recognized"
because that would give the Uni
versity license to punish them as

a group. "We are the ones they
love to hate," he said, saying that
they have been used as scape
goats. "We are not doing stuff
that warrants all this negative re
action," he said.
Pisano agreed that they could
not be punished as a group. "Since
we don't recognize them as a fra
ternity, we don't punish them as
a fraternity." He said the Univer
sity instead holds individual stu
dents responsible.
A DU rush party at the Suites
two weeks ago was broken up by
police, and resulted in the expul
sion of six students from the res
idence. The DU member admitted
that at the party, they got "too
many people in one room, and
limited damage was done."
A DU rush party in an inner

quad at the Suites was broken up
by police only 30 minutes after it
started, reportedly because ad
ministration officials alerted
police beforehand.
The DU member estimated that
less than one-fourth of an original
group of 80 rushees would be of
fered a bid. Last year, he said, 25
bids were issued, and 23 accepted.
This year's pledge class will be
"smaller than that by our choice."
Freshman Hisham Amin, a DU
rushee, called the past four weeks
of rushing the "highlight of my
time at Stanford."
"They are no different than any
other fraternity, except they are
more outgoing. They make it clear
that if you join, you must be loyal
to the DUs, and that they are not
in any way University-affiliated,"
he said.
