# Late overseas vote mars ASSU election
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate's decision to
reopen last week's ASSU elections to
allow for overseas voting is
procedurally intolerable and borders on
the unethical.
The Daily claimed April 20 that the
ASSU "forgot" about overseas voting.
Apparently it took a few election tallies
that were probably unsatisfactory to
most ASSU senators (namely the rejec
tion of the Black Student Union's fee
request) to jog the senate's memory.
Yes, students at Stanford's overseas
campuses have a right to vote in
ASSU elections. But extending this
right to a small, exclusive group after
all other votes have been tallied and
made public does not constitute proper
democratic procedure.
Why? Because the publication of
such information, before voting is com

pleted, affects election results.
Television networks have long been
urged not to project national election
winners based on East Coast returns
until polls have closed in Western
states for the same reason: Premature
results affect voter behavior.
Students overseas now know that
their votes will decide outcomes on
several issues.
The "value" of these votes will be
greatly inflated. A mere eight votes of
approval, for example, is worth more
than $24,000 to the BSU.
Being endowed with such power,
overseas voters will undoubtedly be
come targets for strong lobbying by
the groups whose fate they control.
On other issues and candidates, how
ever, they will realize that their votes
do not matter, as the decisions have
already been made. Such conditions
hardly make for democratic elections.
ASSU election guidelines would have
prevented the senate from taking such

actions but the senators took it upon
themselves to amend the guidelines so
that balloting could be extended.
Such an amendment is procedurally
incorrect in itself, I'm told by at least
one Council of Presidents member.
If the senate wants to reopen the
elections it should reopen them to all
students. And if the senate wishes to
be taken seriously, it should stop
making a mockery out of democracy.
