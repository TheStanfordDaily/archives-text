# Theta Xi not a part of Bookstore theft
## 
### 
In response to the April 22 article
about recent Bookstore thefts, we wish
to clarify the position of Theta Xi fra
ternity on three points:
• No house member had any knowl
edge of Jose Fernandez's alleged crimi

nal actions. We know no more than
that which was printed in The Daily.
• We realize that one member's actions
inevitably reflect upon the entire or
ganization. However, we wish to stress
that Theta Xi fraternity was in no way
involved with Jose's alleged miscon
duct.
• We sincerely hope that the allega
tions described in The Daily are not
true. We are Jose's friends and will
continue to offer him moral support
regardless of the outcome.

President, Theta Xi
