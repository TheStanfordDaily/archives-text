## Cheaters always win 
### 
I CHEATED. I cheat. I will cheat.
Who doesn't? Everyone cheats and
those who say they don't are liars.
Our society not only condones cheating
but exalts it above honesty and truthful
ness.
Honesty is a sign of immaturity, of
naivete about the way the game is played.
Rutgers University students recently
demonstrated their insight when two
thirds of a sampling of them noted that
a student would be a fool not to cheat.
In this person-eat-person world of ours,
it's survival of the fittest (that is, the
ones with the right answers on tests).
The honest are dinosaurs slowly awaiting
their extinction in a world of dishonesty.
If the honest are so smart, then they
should be smart enough to figure the
easy way out. They can deal with their
consciences by telling themselves that
they were not cheating, just comparing
notes.
They can lift a sentence or two, a par
agraph or three, without attribution.
That isn't plagarism; it's just poor foot
noting. They can watch their friends copy
their papers without turning these class
mates in; that is just good friendship.
Aristotle would argue that moral
choices are the true test of character.
Machiavelli would counter that the ends
justify the means. I would combine the
two to form the 1980s Nietzschean equa
tion: The true test of character is being
able to find moral choices that will get
you to your ends.
By this standard, President Reagan
was correct in proclaiming Oliver North
a "national hero." Ollie lied to Congress
and broke the country's laws but achieved

his ends of financing for the Contras,
the moral equivalents of the Founding
Fathers.
Reagan's only misstatement is that he
did not mention that Ollie was only one
of many current national heroes. Michael
Deaver and Lyn Nofziger have both
evinced the correct amount of cheating
and deception to qualify for this status.
The most recent addition to this crowd,
Larry Speakes, baldly confronts the na
tion in his book with his fabrications and
cheating as White House press secretary.
National heroes are not limited to
politics but operate in business and re
ligion as well. Ivan Boesky represents
the business community's "Greed is good,
so do as you will" entry, while the
sexploits of Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swag
gart legitimize their candidacy into the
National Hero Hall of Fame.
But why only limit the title of cheater
to those who have been caught or those
whose actions society disapproves of?
While the national media persecuted Joe
Biden for his vile plagiarisms, scores of
politicians from George Washington to
Ronald Reagan have had their speeches,
political programs and press statements
written for them without giving proper
acknowledgement to the real authors.
In the legal arena, even Supreme Court
justices rely on their law clerks to draft
most of their opinions. And just about
everyone who's anyone today has a
ghostwriter to capture on paper what
they would have said and felt if they had
said it and felt it.
With this type of cheating ethos per
vading the country, I must laugh at the

suggestion of Harvard University Presi
dent Derek Bok that universities need to
pay more attention to teaching ethics to
their students.
Teaching ethics really translates into
teaching the "right answers"; and we all
know from our secular humanist back
grounds that there are no right answers,
only choices. We are fully able to distin
guish right choices from wrong ones. The
fact is just that the "wrong" choices have
become the "right" selections to make in
order to survive in America, 1988.
Thus, the next time you sign your
name to Stanford's Honor Code on a
midterm or a final, exchange a little
chuckle with the person next to you. The
Honor Code is merely a screen to filter
out the successes from the failures.
The University will occasionally catch
a few cheaters, as it did a few years ago
in Prof. Philip Zimbardo's Psych 1 class
â€” but they are only the unlucky ones,
the ones not smart enough to cheat well.
Sometimes the best form of cheating
is believing in one principle but espousing
the opposite. In columns, for example. . . .
