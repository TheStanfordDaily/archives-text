## Blacks in largely white frats feel at home 
### Marcus Mabry Staff writer 
"People who adamantly look at
blacks in housed fraternities as
not knowing themselves or lack
ing identity are wrong," senior
Steven Irvin said. "I know who J
am. I am very aware of my black
ness. I'm just doing what I feel
is right for me — what I am com
fortable with."
And he was comfortable joining
Phi Delta Theta — a predomi
nantly white fraternity.
Irvin is a member of a minority
within a minority — he is a black
man belonging to a housed, tradi
tionally white fraternity. While
less than 20 percent of Stanford
men are members of fraternities,
far less than 20 percent of the
men living in fraternities are
black.
But for Irvin and other black
men living in Stanford fraterni
ties, joining a predominantly
white fraternity has not threat
ened his racial identity.
Black fraternity members said
they joined housed fraternities for
the same reasons white members
do. "What I like most about the
experience is being able to live
with a close group of people who
become your best friends, people
with common bonds despite their
race, hometown or whatever,"
said Kappa Sigma member
Patrick Stewart, a junior.
Junior Jonathan Holloway, also
a black member of a housed fra
ternity, praised the "comradery"
of Delta Tau Delta. "There are
... guys here that are very dear
to me," he said.
Traditionally black fraternities
While joining a predominantly
white fraternity might strengthen
his tie to other University men,
the black member risks distancing
himself from the black commu
nity at Stanford.
As a member of one of Stan
ford's housed fraternities, a black
man cannot join one of Stanford's
traditionally black fraternities.

The black in the (housed) fraternity may not
be representative of the Stanford black exper

moves them from that experience, from so
cializing with the black groups on campus.'

black fraternities and two black
sororities focus on public service
to the black community.
BGLC Pres. Mark Garner en
couraged black men to join the
organization: "I always hope
blacks will be a part of the Black
Greeks because we go back to the
black community and give back
to them what we have taken."
According to the blacks who
joined predominantly white fra
ternities, their separation from
the larger black community is
very real.
"Being a black in a pre
dominantly white fraternity
means not having that much ex
perience with the black side of
the Stanford community," Irvin
explained. "I prefer being where
I am, but I think I could have
gotten more out of the black ex
perience."
Stewart said that he also feels
isolated from the happenings of
the black community, explaining
that he is "not really informed"
about black campus activities be
cause they are usually only
publicized by word of mouth.
Senior Henry Shead, a black
member of the Phi Delts, said he
cannot help but "wonder" how
members of the black community
judge him when they learn which
fraternity he joined. "You're
aware they're making a judge
ment," Shead said.
Life in the house
Despite this separation from
the black community, of the six
black members interviewed, all
said they are happy they chose to
join housed fraternities.
Stewart speculated that he is

more comfortable in the housed
fraternity because he comes from
a predominantly white back
ground. "Given where I come
from, I felt a lot easier being
around a predominantly white
community," said the Kansas na
tive. "Whatever kind of commu
nity you've been around is the
kind you'll seek."
All of the blacks interviewed
said that they find racism in the
fraternity is no more prevalent
than in the University at large.
According to Holloway, race "is
just not a factor" with his frater
nity. "I don't consider myself any
different from the people I live
with," he said. Holloway, a Stan
ford football player, speculated
that his fraternity brothers' in
teraction with blacks on athletic
teams has made them more open
to racial differences.
"Maybe I'm optimistic or just
dumb, but maybe being on a team
allows less racism to foster," Hol
loway said.
Stewart said that he had not
experienced any racism in Kappa
Sigma but had seen "racism and
discrimination" at other fraterni
ties on campus, including the now
unrecognized Delta Upsilon fra
ternity.
He went on to admit, however,
that when he first pledged Kappa
Sigma he wrongly believed that
some of the fraternity's pledging
rituals were "racist."
"I initially thought that because
there were not as many black
people they were racist, and that's
not true," Stewart explained.
Fellow Kappa Sigma Don Bur
dette praised his fraternity as
"one of the most diverse houses"

at Stanford.
"When I was approaching the
fraternity I wasn't really con
scious of myself as a minority but
I was part of a very diverse pledge
class."
Broadening perspectives
In fact, all of the black men
interviewed agreed that a black's
presence in the house helped
other members understand a mi
nority viewpoint.
According to Shead, the pres
ence of blacks in housed frater
nities has a "definite" effect on
the other members. "In [Phi
Delts] ... we [the black members]
still go out to things, to the black
functions on campus. It makes

people aware," Shead said.
"I think it's good there is mi
nority representation in the
houses because people forget if
they're not reminded," he said.
Stewart agreed that his pres
ence in the house has broadened
house members' perspective. "I
give a different perspective on
things that happen in the house.
I think it's good for the house,"
he said.
Holloway, however, was more
skeptical about the impact black
men have in their houses. "The
black in the (housed) fraternity
may not be representative of the
Stanford black experience because
living in the . . . houses removes
them from that experience, from

socializing with the black groups
on campus," he explained.
But Holloway went on to admit
that "in some obscure way" a
black's presence in the house in
creases fraternity members' sen
sitivity. He pointed out that if
there were females living in the
house "language might be tem
pered" and minorities prevent
"racist" language.
"Any exposure to any different
group has to have some impact
on the members of the house,"
he said.
Despite the fraternities'
growing sensitivity to black is
