# Chemistry class is a real blast

### Chris Owen 
This Friday the Chemistry Department
will give its students a blast.
During a lecture at Memorial Auditorium,
Chemistry Prof. Brian Shaw will display
one of chemistry's more riveting applica
tions: explosions. Shaw, a world-renowned
chemist, is visiting the University for this
one lecture.
Attending the program is a requirement
for students in Chemistry 1, a course de
signed to introduce non-science majors to
the world of science. Following the design
of the course, the lecture will emphasize
the practical applications of chemistry in an
attempt to convince students that chemistry
is fun.
Shaw has lectured on explosives more
than a thousand times in the past 60 years,
and has spoken to distinguished audiences
that have included the Queen of England
and her royal family.
Shaw's lecture will explore the differences
between mechanical and chemical explo
sions. Some of his dramatic effects will in
clude shooting wax candles through several
layers of plywood and impregnating cellulose
with liquid oxygen.
Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare, who de
signed and initiated the Chem 1 course, said
his goal for the demonstration and for the
class is to "acquaint people with the world
around them — which is full of chemistry."
Zare designed the course with the help
of his wife, who has no background in sci
ence. He said he wants to create a course

that would cater to those who possess
"chemophobia" and those who see chemists
as either "nerds or authority figures."
Through the course, Zare said he hopes
"to break down" those preconceptions and
make chemistry "every bit as exciting as
creating fiction."
Zare compared chemistry to art, explain
ing that both involve "highly individualistic
creativity" and substantial experimentation.
The course will examine researchers' roles
in making scientific breakthroughs, like the
development of the Strategic Defense Initi
ative and the discovery of the structure of
DNA.
Chem 1 does not involve the memorization
of large amounts of written material.
Rather, according to Zare, it challenges stu
dents to understand the general principles
and driving forces of scientific endeavor. All
of the required labs involve experiments
simple enough "to be carried out away from
class."
Zare estimates that 20 students enroll in
the course each time it is offered. He would
like the class to be approximately twice that
number, but speculates that introductory
human biology and oceanography classes at
tract students who might otherwise take
Chem 1 to fulfill the natural science distri
bution requirement. Still, Zare acknowl
edges, "If it weren't for this DR, my small
class would be even smaller."
He has changed the course's designation
from Chemistry 123, which he had hoped
would convey its fundamental nature — as

simple as counting from one to three — to
Chemistry 1 so that prospective students
would not misconstrue its difficulty. He
hopes that this change will attract more
students to the course.
In spite of his regrets over Chem l's size,
Zare finds teaching the course "particularly
gratifying" and has been "very pleased with
people's reaction" to it in the past.
Current Chem 1 students sense their pro
fessor's enthusiasm and appreciate the con
tent of the course.
Freshman Jay Lopez enjoys the course
for its practicality. "It teaches you a lot of
the things you've always wanted to
know. ... I look forward to coming to this
[class]," Lopez said. Similarly, Mia Zamora,
a sophomore in English, likes the experi
ments because they deal with "things that
are really practical to know."
Organizers of Chem l's most explosive
experiment hope it will shake students in
their seats and foster greater student inter
est in chemistry. Zare hopes the demonstra
tion and class will "teach Stanford students
who choose to major [in something other
than chemistry] what is going on in science."
Of the explosion demonstration, Zare said:
"I promise you it will be an event to re
member."

The lecture is open to all Stanford students,
and tickets can be obtained through the Res
idential Education office or at the door before
the demonstration. A $5 admission fee will
be charged for the general public.
