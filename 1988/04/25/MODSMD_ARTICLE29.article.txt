## Card splits, first place on the line today ASU goes one game ahead of Stanford in Six-Pac 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The Stanford baseball
team broke Arizona
State's 23-game winning
streak on Saturday, but
the Sun Devils returned
to mid-streak form yes
terday, backing out-

standing pitching with relentless hitting
to shellack the Cardinal 15-6 and take
back first place in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division.
Stanford won 5-3 on Saturday behind
a sparkling combined pitching perform
ance from Mike Mussina and Steve
Chitren and Doug Robbins' game
winning, eighth-inning home run.
Arizona State (44-9 overall, 15-8 in
the Six-Pac) now holds a one-game lead
over the second-place Cardinal (30-15,
14-9) going into the third and final game
of the series at 1 p.m. today at Sunken
Diamond. Today's game is a make-up
of Friday's game, which was rained out.
The Cardinal, which travels to Miami
next weekend for a three-game, non
league series with the Hurricanes, has
two Six-Pac series left after this one.
The conference champion will likely be
selected to host an NCAA regional tour
nament, while the second-place team
will most likely have to travel elsewhere
for regional play.
Yesterday's game was over almost
before it began. Stanford starter Lee
Plemel looked sharp in the first inning,
retiring the side in order, but in the
second inning, the Sun Devils exorcised
any frustrations they may have had left
over from Saturday. Steve Willis sin
gled, Dan Rumsey walked, Tim Spehr
singled home Willis, and Ricky Can
delari took Plemel deep to center for a
three-run home run that made the score
4-0 in a hurry.
Arizona State pummeled Plemel some
more in the second. With one out, Kevin
Higgins tripled into the left-field corner,
then Willis and Dan Rumsey nailed
back-to-back home runs to give the Sun
Devils a 7-0 lead.
Plemel was at something of a loss to
explain what happened. "I came out in
the first and felt pretty good," he said.
"I still felt good in the second — but
I lost a little concentration. I don't think
it was anything specifically. Both of the
first two home runs (by Candelari and
Willis) were on good pitches. . . . They
came out looking to hit the ball, to take
the breakers (breaking balls) away and
challenge me to go inside."

Stanford made it 7-2 in the bottom
of the third on a two-run home run by
Troy Paulsen, who extended his hitting
streak to 24 games. That was as close
as the Cardinal would get, however.
Sun Devil starter Linty Ingram was
in control most of the way, throwing
his ninth complete game of the season
to improve his record to 14-2. His 14
wins are equal to the best in the nation.
Ingram gave up 11 hits, struck out 11
and walked only two.
"He was probably the best pitcher
we've faced this year," Paulsen said,
"He was throwing pretty well — he had
good velocity on his fastball.
"I used my overhand curveball more
today," Ingram said. "I usually use my
slider more. I had better location with
my fastball."

Ingram threw a lot of pitches, but
ASU Coach Jim Brock wasn't about to
take him out. "I threw 175 pitches . . .
my legs were dead," Ingram said. "But
Coach said, 'You're gonna have to suck
it up, because we don't want to have
to use any more pitchers,' so I just said,
'I guess I just won't walk anybody.' "
The Sun Devil batters, meanwhile,
continued to apply pressure, adding
three runs in the sixth inning off Car
dinal reliever Brian Keyser, and getting
three more in the eighth off Scott Weiss
and two in the ninth off Mark Carper.
The Cardinal scored once in the fifth
inning and twice in the eighth on a
two-run home run by Paul Carey, but
never mustered a real assault.
"We couldn't put together any real
big inning," Paulsen said.
On Saturday, neither team could put
together a big inning. The Sun Devils
scored once in the first on a single and
a bit of fielding follies by the Cardinal.
John Finn singled, and took off to steal
second. Mussina threw a wild pitch on
the play, and Finn scooted around to
third. Stanford catcher Doug Robbins

tried to peg Finn at third, but threw
the ball past third baseman Ed Sprague,
and Finn came home.
Stanford answered in its half of the
first, roughing up ASU starter Bias
Minor for four hits, but scoring only
once when Minor stabbed Ron Wit
meyer's line drive through the box and
turned it into a double play.
The score stayed 1-1 until the fourth,
when Sun Devil designated hitter Mar
tin Peralta ripped a two-run homer to
left — his fifth homer of the season —
to make it 3-1.
Stanford tied it in the fifth. Cardinal
center fielder Eric DeGraw, who had
made a tremendous belly-flopping catch
to end the top of the fifth, led off the
bottom of the inning with his first col
legiate home run to bring the Cardinal
within one nin.
"I didn't think I had it in me,"
DeGraw said. "I'm a slap hitter — I
guess I slapped it pretty good."
One out after DeGraw's homer, Paul
sen doubled down the left-field line. He
went to third on Witmeyer's long fly
to right. Rusty Kilgo came on in relief
of Minor, and Sprague greeted him with
a run-scoring single up the middle to
tie the game, 3-3.
Mussina continued to shut down the
Sun Devils until the eighth. After sur
rendering a lead-off single to Finn, Mus
sina gave way to Chitren.
Chitren got two quick outs before
walking Rumsey, then induced Peralta
to fly out to right.
In the bottom of the eighth, Paul
Carey led off for the Cardinal with a
single to right. The next batter, Rob
bins, was looking to bunt, until Kilgo
tossed a pick-off throw past Willis at
first, allowing Carey to motor around
to third. That gave Robbins the freedom
to swing away.
"I was kinda happy when I saw that
throw get away," Robbins said. "I
thought, 'All right, now I get to swing
the bat, maybe get an RBI.' I was glad,
because it's a lot easier for me to hit
the ball than to bunt."
Robbins did hit the ball, depositing
his seventh homer of the year over the
left-field fence to give the Cardinal a
5-3 lead.
Then Chitren retired the Sun Devils
in order in the ninth, striking out Mike
Burrola to end the game and notch the
victory, his fifth of the year against
four losses.
It was the second straight excellent


n Beer — baily
Freshman Mike Mussina pitched seven strong innings Saturday to lead Stanford to
a 5-3 win over Arizona State at Sunken Diamond. Stanford ended a 23-game winning
streak for the Sun Devils.
