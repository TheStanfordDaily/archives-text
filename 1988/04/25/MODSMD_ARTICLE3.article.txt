# Searching for answers to Palo Alto's homeless problem
## 
### Jeff Album Marshall Wilson 
Palo Alto's answer to the plight of the
homeless is a Winnebago parked in a
church lot on Webster Street, between
University and Hamilton Avenues. It is
here, not city hall, where those without
shelter come for everything from food
and clothing to job referrals and a sym
pathetic ear.
But momentum is building for more
wide-ranging solutions to the nagging
problem of the homeless in affluent Palo
Alto. A coalition of concerned citizens,
city representatives, Stanford students
and advocates for the homeless is banding
together to organize a comprehensive
community response.
Junior Nina Houghton and senior Lisa
Beattie of the Stanford Homeless Project
were among five panelists who spoke last
Wednesday to more than 130 other par
ticipants in a forum co-sponsored by the
Palo Alto Human Relations Commission
and Stanford's Public Service Center.
Houghton and Beattie were invited by

the Human Relations Commission to of
fer policy and research perspectives on
homelessness.
"Palo Alto is just now taking respon
sibility as a community for the problem
of homelessness," said Beattie, who has
been studying the issue since last March,
when the the Stanford Homeless Project
was formed. She called the recently
formed Committee on Homelessness a
"first step" toward addressing the prob
lem.
The forum, the first of several to be
held in the coming months, sought to
identify who the homeless are, what their
current situation is and how the com
munity can help.
Stanford's Public Service Center be
came involved after conducting forums
on transportation problems and recog
nizing a need for community education.
"We decided we needed to broaden our
work to educate people on issues of public
concern," said Tim Stanton, associate di
rector at the center. "We want to put
the issue of homelessness out in the
open."

Stanton said there is a common mis
conception that homelessness is not a
Palo Alto or a Stanford problem â€” that
the homeless only exist elsewhere.
To date, Palo Alto has dealt with its
homeless problem by referring most ques
tions to Jim Burklo, head of the Urban
Ministry. The ministry, which owns the
wayward Winnebago, is funded by a co
alition of local churches, private dona
tions and federal grants.
Palo Alto lets Burklo keep tabs on the
number of homeless in the city, which
he estimates to be 80 to 100. No official
figures have been compiled.
Although Palo Alto's general fund
exceeds $80 million, the only city money
that finds its way into the ministry's
coffers is $25,000 of federal funds that
the city administers.
Nevertheless, there is a growing real
ization in city hall that more must be
done on the local government level.
Lynn Torin, chair of the Human Re
lations Commission, said the forum took
the first steps toward defining the issues
that must be addressed before specific

recommendations can be made to the city.
Stereotypical images of homelessness
no longer apply, according to Torin.
Bums, alcoholics and dropouts may be
part of the homeless picture, but families
and the recently unemployed make up
the fastest growing segment of the home
less population.
"Normally, you think of single men,"
Torin said. "But one thing we learned
today is that [the homeless] are families
just like yours or mine."
Houghton said that identifying the
homeless is important, but the real prob
lems stem from Palo Alto's lack of low
income housing and coordinated commu
nity support.
"There needs to be an emphasis on
community-based strategy rather than
just relying on government money," she
said.
Teri Bressler, consultant to the state
Senate Housing and Urban Affairs Com
mittee, agrees that local government
needs to act. "Telling churches and
private charities to solve the homeless
problem is like telling Mother Teresa to

work harder," Bressler said. "They al
ready are doing all they can."
Burklo and Torin are optimistic about
prospects for Palo Alto taking a more
active role with the homeless. They be
lieve the forum is helping to generate
interest and energy within the commu
nity.
"The city has been extremely helpful
and has bent over backwards to help us,
but they need to go a step beyond that,"
Burklo said. "They need to be supportive,
not just in a reactive way, but in an
active way."
