OJAI, Calif. - Fol
lowing her per
formance in this
weekend's Pacific
.10 Conference
Championships,
Stanford sopho-

more Lisa Green appears ready
to make her second consecutive
run at the national singles title.
Green, an NCAA singles semi
finalist last year, captured the
Pac-10 singles crown yesterday
with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over
UCLA's Stella Sampras.
If grades were given for
performances at Ojai, the Cardi
nal certainly would have been at
the top of the class. After default
ing its No. 1 singles player and
its top two doubles teams, Stan
ford still garnered the Anson S.
Thacher Team Trophy, given to
the Pac-10 team with the most
wins over the four days of the
tournament.
"I thought it was a very, very
good showing for us," Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan said.
The Cardinal placed three
players — Green, freshman Teri
Whitlinger and senior Kay Tittle
— in the singles semifinals, and
one doubles team — Tittle and
Green — in the doubles semi
finals.
The semifinals were scheduled
for Saturday, but a heavy
rainstorm early in the afternoon
forced the cancellation of those
matches. They were made up
early yesterday morning..
Green beat Whitlinger 6-3, 4-6,
6-3 in a match that, in Green's
words, "could have gone the other
way."
Whitlinger led 2-0 in the second
set and was ahead 3-1 on her
serve in the third game. But she
double-faulted on the final two
points of the game, and the mo
mentum shifted to Green, who
won six of the final seven games.
Despite the semifinal loss,
Whitlinger left Ojai with a big
victory to her name. In a quar
terfinal match Friday, she upset
top-seeded Trisha Laux of USC
7-5, 3-6, 6-4. Laux is ranked fifth
in the nation.

In yesterday's other semifinal,
Sampras overwhelmed Tittle 6-0,
6-1. Nevertheless, Tittle earned
the admiration of her coach for
her performance in the tourna
ment.
"She had a great tournament,"
Brennan said of Tittle, who played
on two very sore knees. "What a
great way to finish off her (Ojai)
career."
Sampras was nearly perfect
with her groundstrokes against
Tittle, but she was plagued by
unforced errors against Green in
the final.
Sampras attributed her prob
lems to the confusion that Green
causes her opponents. "It's hard
to tell where she's hitting the
ball," Sampras said.
Green said she wasn't at her
best against Sampras, but she was
pleased with her play throughout
the tournament. "I'm definitely
playing much better than I was
last year (at this time)," Green
said.
The most promising result from
the weekend was the success of
Tittle and Green in the doubles
draw. The Cardinal tandem upset
UCLA's Sampras and Allyson
Cooper, the No. 1 seed, in Friday's
quarterfinals, 5-7, 6-2, 6-2.
Yesterday, with Green already
having played two singles
matches, the Cardinal pair ran
out of gas and ran up against a
hot team in the semifinals. Cali
fornia's Alissa Finerman and Tif
fany Silveria, the eventual
champions, prevailed 7-5, 6-2.
The strong showing of Tittle
and Green, Stanford's No. 3 dou
bles squad, bodes well for the up
coming NCAA championships.
"I'm very encouraged," Brennan
said.
The Cardinal's top two doubles
teams were scratched from the
tournament because of injuries.
Senior Cari Hagey's sore shoulder
forced her and freshman Sandra
Birch out of the competition, and
freshman Tami Whitlinger's
pulled muscle took her and sister
Teri out of the doubles.
Also yesterday, in the semi
finals of the Women's Collegiate
Invitational Singles, Stanford's
Valerie Wilson was upended by
USC's Janice Lum 6-1, 6-3.



The Stanford women's tennis team dominated the Pac-10 Individual championships as three Cardinal
reached the semifinals, including sophomore Lisa Green who went on to win the title.
