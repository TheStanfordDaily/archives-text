OJAI, Calif. - Jeff
Tarango couldn't
continue the ten
nis that got him to
the final of the
Pacific 10 Confer
ence singles cham-

pionship, slipping yesterday to
unranked Brian Garrow of UCLA
6-2, 6-3.
Tarango, playing his best ten
nis, used a powerful serve and
punishing groundstrokes to crush
Robert Beirens of UCLA 6-1, 6-4
in the quarterfinals and Califor
nia's Carl Chang 6-0, 6-3 in the
semis.
But the finals were a different
story altogether.
Tarango, a sophomore ranked
sixth in the nation, never got any
rhythm going and had the two
weapons that served him so well
in the earlier rounds — his serve
and his groundstrokes — failing
him when he needed them most.
"Jeff is a very outstanding
player when he controls the tempo
of a match," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "But he wasn't pa
tient today. He was rushing
things out there."
Up a break 2-1 in the second
set after Garrow had out-steadied
him in the first set, Tarango
double faulted at 3-3 to let Garrow
right back into the set.
Then at 3-4 on another 3-3
point on Tarango's serve, Garrow
outdueled Tarango at his own
game, popping a forehand winner
from the baseline to jump up 5-3.
"It just takes a little bit to
throw you out of that grove that
you have built up during a tour
nament," Tarango said. "I just
lost it mentally out there."
Garrow, who defeated USC'a
Byron Black and teammate Buff
Farrow on his way to the finals
despite tendinitis problems in his
left knee, follows past titleholders
such as Tim Mavotte, Dan Goldie,
Brad Pearce and Patrick McEnroe
as Pac-10 singles champion.
"Winning the title was my only

shot at making the NCAAs," Gar
row said. "I've always believed I
could beat the best players."
Garrow's win lifted UCLA into
a first-place tie with USC for the
team trophy, the Thacher Cup.
In doubles play, sophomore
Barry Richards substituted for in
jured freshman David Wheaton to
team with Tarango.
Richards, coming up with some
big serves on key points, spurred
the tandem into the Pac-10 final
match.
Richards and Tarango beat Ar
izona's Paul Landry and Kevin
Kredel 4-6, 7-6, 6-1, Cal's Woody
Hunt and Eddie Marcum 7-5, 6-2
and USC's Murphy Jensen and
Scott Brownsberger 2-6, 7-5, 6-3
in the semifinals.
Jensen and Bounsberger are
the nation's No. 15 doubles team.
USC's Scott Melville and Eric
Amend, the nation's No. 1 pair,
ended the Cardinal team's sur
prising doubles run by a 6-1, 7-5
score.
Richards and Tarango broke
serve to move ahead 4-2 in the
second set, but Melville and
Amend broke Tarango to even the
match at 4-4, then broke him
again to close out the match.
"We should have won the sec
ond set," Richards said. "We just
didn't have anything on our serve.
We definitely had a shot to win
the match."
Friday, in the first round, fresh
men Glenn Solomon and Martin
Blackman bowed to USC's Byron
Black and Jonas Wallgard in
straight sets.
Also on Friday, sophomore Eric
Peus and Jeff Cathrall lost to Jen
sen and Brownsberger in the first
round.
