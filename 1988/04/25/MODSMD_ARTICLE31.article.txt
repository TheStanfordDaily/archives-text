OJAI, Calif. - Jeff
Tarango couldn't
continue the ten
nis that got him to
the final of the
Pacific 10 Confer
ence singles cham-

pionship, slipping yesterday to
unranked Brian Garrow of UCLA
6-2, 6-3.
Tarango, playing his best ten
nis, used a powerful serve and
punishing groundstrokes to crush
Robert Beirens of UCLA 6-1, 6-4
in the quarterfinals and Califor
nia's Carl Chang 6-0, 6-3 in the
semis.
But the finals were a different
story altogether.
Tarango, a sophomore ranked
sixth in the nation, never got any

"Jeff is a very outstanding
player when he controls the tempo
of a match," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "But he wasn't pa

things out there."
Up a break 2-1 in the second
set after Garrow had out-steadied
him in the first set, Tarango
double faulted at 3-3 to let Garrow
right back into the set.
Then at 3-4 on another 3-3
point on Tarango's serve, Garrow
outdueled Tarango at his own
game, popping a forehand winner
from the baseline to jump up 5-3.
"It just takes a little bit to
throw you out of that grove that
you have built up during a tour
nament," Tarango said. "I just
lost it mentally out there."
Garrow, who defeated USC'a
Byron Black and teammate Buff
Farrow on his way to the finals
despite tendinitis problems in his
left knee, follows past titleholders
such as Tim Mavotte, Dan Goldie,
Brad Pearce and Patrick McEnroe
as Pac-10 singles champion.
