# Volleyball beats San Diego State to end season
## Squad rebounds from Friday loss to Long Beach State 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
All's well that ends well.
That could very well
be the motto of the Stan
ford men's volleyball
team, which ended its
season Saturday night.
The Cardinal rebounded

from a 15-6, 15-9, 15-11 loss to Long
Beach State at Maples Pavilion Friday
night to defeat San Diego State Satur
day. The 13th-ranked Cardinal posted
an 11-15, 15-13, 15-11, 15-6 triumph
over the No. 14 Aztecs to finish with
an 11-19 record. Stanford placed eighth
in the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association with a 5-13 league mark,
two games ahead of ninth-place SDSU.
"I think winning the last game of the
year was a very positive step for next
year," sophomore Dan Hanan said.
Coming in, Stanford hoped to upset
the 49ers, ranked seventh in the nation.
But fine play from Long Beach and
some defensive problems Irom the Car
dinal led to the somewhat one-sided
match. "Friday's game we weren't
psyched to lip them off the court,"
Hanan said. "We weren't reading their
hitters well. We left a lot of holes in
our block. Our defense was just sloppy.
We were bumming."
Senior outside hitter Mark Amstutz
felt Long Beach won on defense. "They
played terrific defense. That, as (Stan
ford Coach) Fred (Sturm) would say,
can be the key to the game because it'll
give you the opportunity to score
points," he said.
"You get a great hit but you're dug,"
he continued. "When they dig you,
that's the killer."
Most of the damage was done by out
side hitters John Brgyevic and Mark
Kerins, who had 19 kills apiece. Fresh
man middle blocker Brett Winslow
added 16.
For Stanford, Hanan and Amstutz
each had 17 kills and seven digs while
freshman outside hitter John Alstrom
added 15 kills and eight digs.
Throughout the match Stanford was
able to side-out well, but the Cardinal
had a real problem scoring. Long Beach

setter Kevin Freymond was the bene
ficiary of good passing and was often
able to isolate his hitters one-on-one
against the Stanford block. Coupled
with the performance of his hitters
(Kerins, in particular, has one of the
most powerful swings in WIVA), the
49ers were able to side-out almost at
will throughout the match.
"Against Long Beach we didn't play
any defense at all," Hanan said. "We
brought that to a halt the second match.
We played well enough to win (Satur
day). I think we turned it on when we
needed to."
Stanford did "turn it on" at key mo
ments Saturday night. In the third
game, Stanford turned a 9-7 deficit into
a 14-9 lead when sophomore setter
Parker Blackman served seven straight
points, including an ace, before the Az
tecs sided-out. SDSU freshman Hugh
Foster scored two points on kills, but
on the third game point, Amstutz tooled
the block for the game.
The fourth game went the same way,
as Stanford scored nine of the match's
final 10 points.
Leading the way defensively for the
Cardinal Saturday were Hanan and
senior captain Brad Nelson, who had
13 digs each. Hanan also added 20 kills
to go along with 21 from Alstrom. In
addition to his match-high kill figure,
Alstrom also had 13 digs and a .556
hitting percentage.
"Allie careered (Saturday night),"
Hanan said.
"Overall, we ended up on top of
things," Amstutz said. "We lasted
through their strong sessions then came
at it with our own. We had some good
passing tonight; Allie passed well
tonight. We just played our game."
"Jay Ogas came off the bench and
helped us out a lot," Amstutz continued.
"I just look at it as everyone contributed
as they usually do."
Ogas, a freshman middle blocker from
Clovis, Calif., came in early in the sec
ond game to help turn things around
for Stanford. He had four blocks, five
digs, 11 kills, a .400 hitting percentage
and also served tough for the Cardinal.
In addition to these high points, the
match also had a few low points. Aztec

'It was a great year.
[The team has a] one
game winning streak for
next year.'
— Dan Hanan

Coach Rudy Suwara spent most of the
match complaining to the officials about
a few vociferous fans who were getting
on his players (rather ironic, as the San
Diego State bench spent much of the
match heckling Stanford outside hitter
Nelson).
Finally, Aztec co-captain Bill Boul
lianne went back to serve with his team
trailing 6-5 in the fourth game and
decided to wait the fans out. He waited,
then before he was called for a delay
(a server is allowed only five seconds),
he tossed the ball in the air and let it
fall. This action gained him a new five
second count, during which he did the
same thing.
The referee had had enough at this
point and awarded Stanford a side-out,
then Boullianne got so frustrated he
kicked the ball off the Maples catwalk,
about 50 feet above the court.
He was immediately given a red card,
an automatic point for Stanford. On his
way to the bench, Boullianne pointed
a particular finger at the official to draw
an ejection.
"Against this team, I don't see any
problem with [the crowd's behavior],"
Hanan said. "We got that much, if not
more » . . at their place."
The Cardinal is now looking forward
to next season when most top players
will return and be joined by a fine
recruiting class. Stanford also will have
senior-to-be Scott Fortune return to the
team after spending this year with the
U.S. Olympic team.
"It was a great year," Hanan con
cluded. "[The team has a] one-game
winning streak for next year. Overall
the year was a learning experience that
will come in handy next year: how to
get through the rough times. Now we're
ready to let the good times roll."

about 50 feet above the court.
He was immediately given a red card,
an automatic point for Stanford. On his
way to the bench, Boullianne pointed
a particular finger at the official to draw
an ejection.
"Against this team, I don't see any
problem with [the crowd's behavior],"
Hanan said. "We got that much, if not
more » . . at their place."
The Cardinal is now looking forward
to next season when most top players
will return and be joined by a fine
recruiting class. Stanford also will have
senior-to-be Scott Fortune return to the
team after spending this year with the
U.S. Olympic team.
"It was a great year," Hanan con
cluded. "[The team has a] one-game
winning streak for next year. Overall
the year was a learning experience that
will come in handy next year: how to
get through the rough times. Now we're
ready to let the good times roll."

Freshman Jay Ogas and sophomore Parker Blackman, 31, connected often Saturday
night to lead the Cardinal to a four-game victory over San Diego State.

All's well that ends well.
That could very well
be the motto of the Stan
ford men's volleyball
team, which ended its
season Saturday night.
The Cardinal rebounded

from a 15-6, 15-9, 15-11 loss to Long
Beach State at Maples Pavilion Friday
night to defeat San Diego State Satur
day. The 13th-ranked Cardinal posted
an 11-15, 15-13, 15-11, 15-6 triumph
over the No. 14 Aztecs to finish with
an 11-19 record. Stanford placed eighth
in the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association with a 5-13 league mark,
two games ahead of ninth-place SDSU.
"I think winning the last game of the
year was a very positive step for next
year," sophomore Dan Hanan said.
Coming in, Stanford hoped to upset
the 49ers, ranked seventh in the nation.
But fine play from Long Beach and
some defensive problems Irom the Car
dinal led to the somewhat one-sided
match. "Friday's game we weren't
psyched to lip them off the court,"
Hanan said. "We weren't reading their
hitters well. We left a lot of holes in
our block. Our defense was just sloppy.
We were bumming."
Senior outside hitter Mark Amstutz
felt Long Beach won on defense. "They
played terrific defense. That, as (Stan
ford Coach) Fred (Sturm) would say,
can be the key to the game because it'll
give you the opportunity to score
points," he said.
"You get a great hit but you're dug,"
he continued. "When they dig you,
that's the killer."
Most of the damage was done by out
side hitters John Brgyevic and Mark
Kerins, who had 19 kills apiece. Fresh
man middle blocker Brett Winslow
added 16.
For Stanford, Hanan and Amstutz
each had 17 kills and seven digs while
freshman outside hitter John Alstrom
added 15 kills and eight digs.
Throughout the match Stanford was
able to side-out well, but the Cardinal
had a real problem scoring. Long Beach

setter Kevin Freymond was the bene
ficiary of good passing and was often
able to isolate his hitters one-on-one
against the Stanford block. Coupled
with the performance of his hitters
(Kerins, in particular, has one of the
most powerful swings in WIVA), the
49ers were able to side-out almost at
will throughout the match.
"Against Long Beach we didn't play
any defense at all," Hanan said. "We
brought that to a halt the second match.
We played well enough to win (Satur
day). I think we turned it on when we
needed to."
Stanford did "turn it on" at key mo
ments Saturday night. In the third
game, Stanford turned a 9-7 deficit into
a 14-9 lead when sophomore setter
Parker Blackman served seven straight
points, including an ace, before the Az
tecs sided-out. SDSU freshman Hugh
Foster scored two points on kills, but
on the third game point, Amstutz tooled
the block for the game.
The fourth game went the same way,
as Stanford scored nine of the match's
final 10 points.
Leading the way defensively for the
Cardinal Saturday were Hanan and
senior captain Brad Nelson, who had
13 digs each. Hanan also added 20 kills
to go along with 21 from Alstrom. In
addition to his match-high kill figure,
Alstrom also had 13 digs and a .556
hitting percentage.
"Allie careered (Saturday night),"
Hanan said.
"Overall, we ended up on top of
things," Amstutz said. "We lasted
through their strong sessions then came
at it with our own. We had some good
passing tonight; Allie passed well
tonight. We just played our game."
"Jay Ogas came off the bench and
helped us out a lot," Amstutz continued.
"I just look at it as everyone contributed
as they usually do."
Ogas, a freshman middle blocker from
Clovis, Calif., came in early in the sec
ond game to help turn things around
for Stanford. He had four blocks, five
digs, 11 kills, a .400 hitting percentage
and also served tough for the Cardinal.
In addition to these high points, the
match also had a few low points. Aztec

'It was a great year.
[The team has a] one
game winning streak for
next year.'

Coach Rudy Suwara spent most of the
match complaining to the officials about
a few vociferous fans who were getting
on his players (rather ironic, as the San
Diego State bench spent much of the
match heckling Stanford outside hitter
Nelson).
Finally, Aztec co-captain Bill Boul
lianne went back to serve with his team
trailing 6-5 in the fourth game and
decided to wait the fans out. He waited,
then before he was called for a delay
(a server is allowed only five seconds),
he tossed the ball in the air and let it
fall. This action gained him a new five
second count, during which he did the
same thing.
The referee had had enough at this
point and awarded Stanford a side-out,
then Boullianne got so frustrated he
kicked the ball off the Maples catwalk,
about 50 feet above the court.
He was immediately given a red card,
an automatic point for Stanford. On his
