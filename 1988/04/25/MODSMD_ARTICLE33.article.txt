# Oleson establishes new stadium mark

### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Marc Oleson broke one
of Stanford Stadium's
oldest records Saturday
in the Stanford Twilight
Track and Field meet,
breaking Jim Beattie's
1962 1,500-meter run

record by running 3 minutes, 39.26
seconds.
According to Oleson, instead of a con
stant pace of 58 seconds per lap, "the
pace was real up and down for the first
three laps," when Oleson pulled ahead
of former teammate and school
recordholder Jeff Atkinson and "felt
great until the last 50 meters." Oleson,
a fifth-year senior, had been gunning
for the Canadian Olympic standard of
3:37.92 but was satisfied with a new
personal record. "It was my first [per
sonal record] in five years," Oleson said.
Roommate Steve Schadler, also a senior,
finished in third in 3:43.43, a second
and-a-half from the NCAA Champion
ship qualifying time.
It was the final home meet for Stan
ford's seniors and the end of Stanford's
home racing series, as Chico State,
Hayward State, Sacramento State and
San Francisco State provided competi
tion. Several other athletes had out
standing performances in the Cardinal's
final tune-up before a tough meet at
California this Saturday, while other
events remain uncertain.
Stanford will be especially strong in
throwing events and men's distance
events, as evidenced by Glenn
Schneider's new school record in the
discus and the distance team's strong

showing.
Schneider, a junior, was planning to
throw the hammer and the shot until
he hurt his back in a third-place showing
in the hammer throw. Instead of enter
ing the shot put as originally planned,
he threw the discus to a new personal
best and a school record of 196 feet,
one inch, with each of his last three
marks over his previous season best.
Patty Purpur, a junior, made a sig
nificant improvement in her throwing,
adding a foot to her shot put at 51-8
1/4. Purpur holds a clear advantage over
Cal in the Pacific 10 Conference
rankings going into this weekend in both
the shot put and discus and junior Erica
Wheeler will dominate the javelin.
The Cardinal picked up another
NCAA qualifier in freshman David
Strang. Strang ran 1:47.4 in the 800
meters to pull ahead of TAC indoor 800-
meter champion Ray Brown and qualify
for the NCAA Championship meet, while
teammate Christian Skoog, a senior,
took third in 1:48.9.
The closest battle of the day was be
tween sophomore Peter Kolotouros and
the Pac-10 qualifying standard in the
110-meter hurdles. Kolotouros won the
event and beat the standard by one
hundredth of a second. Kolotouros will
be one of the few threats Stanford has
in the sprints at Cal.
The team has been focusing on Cal
for several weeks. According to Asst.
Coach Scott Chisam, for the women,
Cal is "strong in the sprints. It's a tos
sup in the middle distances, and we're
strong in the throws." The men's match
up, he added, "probably boils down to
the mile relay," the final event.
