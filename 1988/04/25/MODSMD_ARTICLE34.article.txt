# Amoroso loses chance at NCAAs
## Sophomore gymnast sprains ankle on meet's first event 
### Karen Gryler Staff writer 
Everyone's been a victim of
"just one of those days." But
not many can say they've had
it as rough as Stanford soph
omore gymnast Dina Amoroso
did Friday.
After working for two

seasons to reach her collegiate competitive
goal — competing at the NCAA Champion
ships — Amoroso lay on the floor in agony.
"I was over-anxious to hit my double back
flip on floor," Amoroso explained, "so I opened
out (of her tuck position) too early."
Amoroso's right ankle bore the brunt of her
mistake.
At the hospital, she learned she had severely
sprained her ankle. The floor exercise had
become Amoroso's first and last event at 1988
nationals.

It was all going so well in
warm-ups and Georgia was
being really supportive.'

Amoroso's feelings were a mixture of anger
and sadness. "It was all going so well in
warm-ups, and Georgia (the team Amoroso
rotated with from event to event) was being
really supportive," she said. Amoroso had also
been inspired by the energetic crowd.
However, instead of being able to compete,
Amoroso ended up on the sidelines at Saturday
night's finals. She consoled herself by watch
ing an amazing display of gymnastics talent.
"It was really awesome watching the best
collegiate gymnasts in the country. The level

of difficulty is incredible," she said. Alabama,
the favorite entering the meet, won the team
competition with 190.05, followed closely by
the home team, Utah, with a 189.50. UCLA
came up with a 188.80 for third.
In the individual all-around, where Amoroso
had hoped to make her mark, Kelly Garrison-
Steves of Oklahoma, also the favorite, won
the meet with a score of 38.90. UCLA gym
nasts Jill Andrews and Kim Hamilton placed
second and third, respectively, with marks of
38.20 and 38.15. One can only conjecture
where Amoroso, whose best all-around score
of the year was 38.20, would have placed.
Now Amoroso will have to play the waiting
game while her ankle heals. Diagnosis of her
injury gives her one to two weeks on crutches
and six to eight weeks before full recovery.
Though Amoroso does not relish the prospect
of this inactivity, she is looking on the bright
side: what a great opportunity to catch up on
all the schoolwork she missed while training.
