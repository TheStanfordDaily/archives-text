# Golfers 7th in Arizona
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
Seven seems to
be the lucky
number for the
Stanford men's
golf team lately.
In a storm
shortened Sun

Devil/Thunderbird Invitational
Tournament in Scottsdale,
Ariz., the Cardinal hung on for
a seventh place finish Saturday
two weeks after finishing
seventh in its own Stanford/U.S.
Intercollegiate tournament at
the Stanford Golf Course.
In the second and final round
Saturday, the Cardinal shot 376
as a team, three surprising
strokes better than third
ranked Arizona State. That gave
Stanford a 36-hole total of 748,
a score good enough to beat such
national powers as BYU and
San Jose State.
Oklahoma State, the nation's
No. 1 team, outdistanced the
rest of the field by a wide mar
gin, besting second-place Ari
zona by 16 shots, 714 to 730.
An Oklahoma State player
also took the individual title, as

Michael Bradley fired a two
round score of 141 on the 6,900-
yard McCormick Ranch Golf
Course. He was tied with Ari
zona's Mike Springer, who also
shot 3-under-par 141, at the end
of regulation, but Bradley took
the playoff on the first extra
hole".
Stanford sophomore Brad
Benbrook continued to show his
talent after sitting out the
middle of the season with an
illness. He led the team with a
36-hole total of 149 (73-76).
Sophomore Josh Zander was ill
for most of Saturday's round,
but managed to hang on for a
final round 78 and a total of 151.
Fellow sophomores Brad
Joondeph and Mark Funseth
followed close on his heels with
two-round totals of 152 (74-78
and 77-75, respectively). Junior
John Mahon and sophomore
Don Christensen both finished
at 154. Christensen was the low
man for Stanford on Saturday,
coming back with a 72 after a
horrendous first-round 82.
The team's situation has
definitely improved since last
season. At last year's Sun Devil,
Stanford struggled to a last

place finish. This year, however,
the team has not been in
timidated by playing the na
tion's top teams, as evidenced
by its fine performance when
paired with Arizona, UCLA,
Fresno State and BYU this
weekend.
According to Stanford coach
Wally Goodwin, this weekend
the team showed a remarkable
"change in (its) overall attitude.
Instead of being nervous about
where they'll place, everyone
wants to compete."
This week's medalist,
Benbrook, seems to reflect this
new attitude. "I was proud of
how far we've come since last
year," he said.
He added that he was very
eager to compete again because
"when you're playing well,
you've got to play it out."
He may get his wish. Appar
ently, BYU's coach was so im
pressed with the Stanford squad
this weekend that he invited the
team to play in BYU's invita
tional tournament next week
end, just two days before the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onship in Orinda, Calif.
