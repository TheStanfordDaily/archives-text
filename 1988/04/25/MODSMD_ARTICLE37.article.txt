SOUTH BEND, Ind. - An ec
static Tim Brown celebrated with
former Notre Dame teammates
after the Los Angeles Raiders
picked the Heisman Trophy win
ner Sunday as the No. 6 choice
in the NFL draft.
"I think things couldn't have
turned out any better for me. I
felt L.A. was a place where I could
play a long time and have a good
career," Brown said.
Brown wouldn't disclose an ask
ing price but said he and agent
Marvin Demoff anticipate no
trouble in reaching a contract
agreement with Raiders owner A 1
Davis.
"(Demoff) told A 1 we had given
other teams a really high figure,
and A 1 said, 'Well, maybe I can't
sign him either,' and he just told
Al, 'You'll have no problems,"'
Brown said. "It won't be peanuts,
but it'll be all right."
Brown, a wide receiver and
punt return specialist, caught 39
receptions for 846 yards last
season despite the lack of a pass
ing quarterback. He said the
Raiders have a potential for a
strong comeback under new head
coach Mike Shanahan after a dis
appointing 1987 season.
"That's one thing that's really
important for me — to get on a

'It [his salary]
won't be peanuts,
but it'll be all
right.'

team that's got an opportunity to
come back," he said. "I think this
year's going to be a lot different
because they have a different sys
tem and a new coach. It's going
to be hard to tell what they're
going to do.
"From what I hear of Mike
Shanahan, he's pretty wide open,
so I'm looking forward to that
because I think I can fit tinto
that kind of offense," Brown said.
Brown watched the draft on
television with former teammates
Joel Williams of the Atlanta Fal
cons and Alvin Miller.
He waited anxiously before the
Cincinnati Bengals picked fifth
and chose defensive back Rodney
Dixon, hoping to remain until the
Raiders, who play on natural turf
in a warm climate.
"You've good weather and
you've got grass fields out there
and that makes all the difference
in the world," he said. "I'm not

saying you couldn't get hurt in
California — anything can hap
pen. Playing on that turf up in
Cincinnati, in cold weather, it can
wear and tear on you. Knees can
only last so long."
Brown, 6 feet and 191 pounds,
averaged 167.9 all-purpose yards
per game last season, sixth best
nationally, although opposing
defenses consistently double- and
triple-teamed him as a receiver
and kicked away from him.
He set a Notre Dame single
season all-purpose mark of 1,937
yards in 1986.and finished his
career as the school's all-time
leader with 2,493 reception yards
and 1,613 kickoff return yards.
He was virtually assured of the
Heisman after he returned suc
cessive punts for touchdowns of
71 and 66 yards against eventual
Big Ten champion Michigan
State.
Brown was used on occasion as
a running back during his career
and carried the ball 98 times for
442 yards. In 1986, he was the
only player in the country to
return two kickoffs for touch
downs, and he had a 97-yarder
against Penn State called back be
cause of a penalty.
Brown said he will report to
the Raiders May 9 for minicamp.
