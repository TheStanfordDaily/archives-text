# Bears get Muster in first round
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff With wire reports 
Stanford tailback Brad Muster took
his first step into the world of profes
sional football yesterday when he was
drafted by the Chicago Bears. Muster
became the fourth running back se
lected in the draft when the Bears
drafted him in the first round, the
23rd player selected overall.
The Novato, Calif., native, who is
among Stanford's career leaders in nu
merous statistical categories, was ex
pected to go higher, but a few unex
pected happenings are the rule in the
NFL draft. Although he played tail
back on the Farm, Muster has been
forcast as a fullback or perhaps even
a tight end in the pros. Muster was
the first fullback drafted yesterday,
being chosen one pick before Pitts
burgh junior Craig "Ironhead"
Heyward.
Heyward, a 280-plus pound be
hemoth, is forgoing his final year of
eligibility after some talk of his signing
with an agent against the NCAA's
amatuer athlete policy.
Muster's low position in the draft
was likely because of scout's concerns
over his health. After coming into his
senior season as a Heisman Trophy
candidate, an ankle injury forced him
to miss at least some playing time in

more than half of Stanford's games.
When healthy, however, Muster was
one of the top collegiate backs.
His junior season Muster gained 190
yards in 37 carries against Washington
State, then came back the following
weekend to gain 183 yards on 38
carries in Stanford's upset of UCLA
at the Rose Bowl. This victory was
considered the biggest factor in the
Cardinal's receiving a bowl bid, the
first for the University since 1978.
Muster scored all three Stanford
touchdowns in that season's Gator
Howl.
Muster was unavailable for com
ment last night.
Perhaps the theme was that teams
went for needs in the annual draft
Sunday, picking players to fill gaping
holes rather than merely taking the
best available athlete.
The first eight picks went about as
expected, save for the choice of Wis
consin tackle Paul Gruber by Tampa
Hay with the fourth pick of the round.
The Hues, who had said last week
they wouldn't take an offensive
lineman, were expected to go for a
wide receiver — either Heisman
Trophy winner Tim Brown of Notre
Dame or Sterling Sharpe of South
Carolina.
"He's one of the best big athletes
I've ever seen," Bucs coach and general
manager Ray Perkins said of the 6-

foot-6, 290-pound Gruber, despite
being philosophically opposed to taking
offensive lineman high in the draft.
This year was no different — six
wide receivers were taken in the first
round, breaking the record of five in
1973.
But they may not have anyone to
throw them the ball. For the first time
since 1985, no quarterbacks were
taken in the first round, limited to 27
picks because Seattle forfeited its
choice by taking Brian Bosworth in
last year's supplemental draft.
But there were lots of surprises, par
ticularly after the top eight blue
chippers were gone.
In a draft deep in running backs,
for example, none was chosen until
the Los Angeles Rams took UCLA's
Gaston Green with the 14th pick.
The Los Angeles Raiders, who took
Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown
of Notre Dame with their first pick,
sixth overall, went for cornerback Ter
rence McDaniel of Tennessee, who has
a history of shoulder problems.
McDaniel was taken as a potential re
placement for the aging Mike Haynes
and Lester Hayes.
Then the New York Giants, who
normally go for the best available ath
lete, took tackle Eric Moore of Indiana,
another player expected to go lower,
with the 10th pick of the draft. Injury
and illness on the offensive line was

one reason New York fell to 6-9 last
year after its 1986 Super Bowl season.
As expected, Dallas picked Miami
wide receiver Michael Irvin.
But the Phoenix Cardinals, trans
planted from St. Louis, continued their
offbeat drafting history by taking line
backer Ken Harvey of California, ear
lier considered a marginal first
rounder.
And Miami, picking 16th, took 6-7,
257-pound Eric Kumerow, a defensive
end from Ohio State who almost no
one projected as a first-rounder.
Nor did any of the expected trades
develop early. The Raiders used both
their picks rather than trade them to
Washington for quarterback Jay
Schroeder. Green Bay, the Giants,
Rams and Minnesota, all of whom
were thought to be looking to trade
up or down, stayed where they were.
The only trade of the first round
was made by the San Francisco 49ers,
who more often than not make a deal.
They dealt their pick, the 26th of the
round, to the Raiders, for wide receiver
Dokie Williams and second- and
fourth-round picks.
The Raiders then took Illinois de
fensive end Scott Davis, considered to
be talented but erratic.
The first pick, of course, was no
surprise — linebacker Aundray Bruce
of Auburn, already signed by the At
lanta Falcons.
