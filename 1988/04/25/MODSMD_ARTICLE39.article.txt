lhe second time
you play a golf
course is usually
better. At least
the Stanford
women's golf
team hopes so.

The Cardinal women pay their
second visit of the season to the
Sahalee Country Club in Red
mond, Washington this week.
This time, however, the stakes
are much higher.
Last October the women took
fourth at the Washington Inter
collegiate, their first tournament
of the season. At that time the
team was just beginning what
looked like a very promising
season.
This time, it's the Second An
nual Pacific-10 Conference
Championships, and the women,
with only one tournament
remaining after Pac-lOs, have
their backs to the wall. They are
fighting for one of the final in
vitations to next month's NCAA
Championships.
The tournament will be held
today, tomorrow, and Wednes

day, with the players playing 36
holes today and 18 the other
two days.
According to Stanford Coach
Tim Baldwin, third-ranked and
defending champion Arizona
State is the team to beat this
week. The Sun Devils solidified
their ranking two weeks ago,
coming from seven strokes be
hind No. 2 Tulsa to win their
own tournament.
The other two schools that fig
ure to challenge for the title are
fifth-ranked USC and No. 7 Ar
izona. Baldwin feels, however,
that No. 11 UCLA and Stanford
could challenge as well. "We
could win it with a solid per
formance from all five players,"
he said. "I look for our team to
challenge [for the title]."
Baldwin will look for senior
Kay Cornelius and freshman
sensation Jodi Figley to set the
pace for the Cardinal this week
and will expect up-and-coming
freshman Kristin Ryan to pro
vide some additional firepower.
He is also hoping that either
freshman Michele Lyford or
sophomore Stephanie Parel can
find a groove and provide a solid
fourth score, something which

has evaded the Cardinal women
for most of the year.
Baldwin thinks that Cornelius
and Figley will be in the hunt
for the individual title as well.
Cornelius is currently ranked
12th in the nation, while Figley
is right behind her at 13th.
Other players that Baldwin
believes will be in the hunt are
Martina Koch and Kathryn
Imrie of Arizona; Pearl Sinn,
Pam Wright and Amy Fruhwirth
of ASU; Tracy Nakamura and
Kim Saiki of USC; Jean Zedlitz
of UCLA; and Nancy Kessler and
Peggy Lund of host Washington.
All of these players are
straight hitters and good put
ters: Driving accuracy and solid
putting will be crucial this week.
The course, while only 6,017
yards long and par-72, is, ac
cording to Baldwin, soaking wet.
"The players were getting no roll
off the tee Lin yesterday's prac
tice round]," he said. "It's
playing very long. It will be the
toughest course we've played all
year."
In addition to playing long,
the course is a tight course un
der any circumstances. Trees
line both sides of nearly every

hole, and according to Baldwin,
all of the par-4s and par-5s are
dog-legged. Many of the holes
also have water hazards, and the
greens are large and heavily un
dulated. Fairways can be as nar
row as 15 yards across, and
three-inch-high rough will make
ball-placement off the tee ex
tremely important. "Whoever
drives it well and putts well will
win," he said.
In addition, according to Cor
nelius, each hole is playing 30
to 40 yards longer than it did
last fall. "Holes where I hit 8-
iron in the past I was hitting
5-iron," she said. "Driving, long
irons and putting will be the
keys to scoring."
With rain and temperatures
in the 40s and 50s forecast for
the week, Baldwin believes that
scores will be very high. "A team
score of 310 will be a very good
score," he said.
The inclement weather will
also test the golfers' mental
strength. "We're all going to
have to be patient with our
selves," Cornelius said. "We just
have to keep thinking that every
one else is fighting the same con
ditions we are."
