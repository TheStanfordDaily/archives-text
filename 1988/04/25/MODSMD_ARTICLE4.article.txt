# Soviet students visit Stanford
## 
### Pia Ali-Salaam 
After hosting a group of Stan
ford students at their Siberian
university over spring break, 12
students from the Soviet Union
arrived on the Farm Thursday to
spend a week learning about U.S.
college life.
Completing an exchange be
tween Stanford and Novosibirsk
University, the 10 men and two
women are being housed this
week with students in dorms
around the campus.
According to Dave Kang, a
senior and chair of the Stanford-
Soviet Exchange Project, which
organized the program, most
Soviets who come to Stanford are
older academics. But this ex
change is different because the
group is composed of "young un
dergraduate Soviets," he said.
In fact, the youthful energy of
the Soviet group is being tested
with a hectic schedule.
So far, the Soviet students have

been entertained with a welcome
dinner given by University
Provost James Rosse, a Ham's
Head production of "Jesus Christ
Superstar," the movie "Three
Men and a Baby" at a late showing
of Sunday Flicks, a San Francisco
visit and a tour of the campus.
As a highlight of their sightsee
ing, the group visited Saturday
the Safeway supermarket on El
Camino Real. The abundance of
goods in U.S. supermarkets con
trasts sharply with comparable
Soviet stores, where shortages of
ten force people to wait in long

lines for goods that are readily
available in the United States.
The Soviets will also have the
chance to meet Stanford students.
The exchange program committee
has planned activities enabling
the students to "meet many
Americans (and) have many con
versations," Kang said.
Tomorrow night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, for example, both
Stanford and Soviet members of
the exchange program will give a
presentation called "Images of the
Enemy," in which both groups
plan to discuss how they perceived
each other before and after meet
ing. The entire student body is
invited to attend and participate
in the discussion.
Coming from a state university
that specializes in the sciences,
the Soviet group is composed of
top math and science students
who are interested in "seeing how
Stanford works," Kang said.
"They are very interested in the
Silicon Valley and SIAC."
