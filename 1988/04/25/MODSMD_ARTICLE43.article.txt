# Squeezing South Africa: Investment Policy Options
## 
### 
• Disinvestment
When a company sells all its ownership interests — such
as a corporate subsidiary or main branch — to the local
company management or workers, or to the government.
• Divestment
When an institution like Stanford sells all its holdings in
a corporation in a symbolic gesture of "washing one's
hands clean" of a company that in some way "supports"
the apartheid regime.
• Severing all economic ties
The complete financial disassociation of a company,
including locally owned or foreign-based subsidiaries or
distributors.
