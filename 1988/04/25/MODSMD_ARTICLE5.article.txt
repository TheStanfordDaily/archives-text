Complications in this spring's
ASSU general elections are al
ready being remedied for next
year's elections, according to next
year's elections commissioner.
Steve Krauss, a freshman who
served as pollmaster this year and
will take over as elections com
missioner fall quarter, has been
investigating the viability and cost
efficiency of voting machines in
ASSU elections. This year marked
the first time the ASSU used the
machines, which were rented
from Santa Clara County.
Krauss said he has also been
identifying solutions to alleviate
long voter lines and possible prob
lems resulting from two separate
pages of senate candidates appear
ing on the ballot.
Although Krauss cannot com
plete cost efficiency studies until
the election is finally over, he said
"preliminary indications" show

the elections "coming in way un
der budget."
Senior Steve Baer, the current
elections commissioner, said this
year's elections budget was
$21,000, of which $7,000 was
spent on fall elections.
Because money is still being
spent on overseas balloting for the
Spring Election, which Baer said
will cost about $1,000, the total
cost remains unknown.
Many students and ASSU
senators complained voters were
confused because this year's ballot
contained two separate pages of
senate candidates.
Because some voters were un
aware of a second page of candi
dates, some senators said stu
dents expended all 10 of their
votes only for candidates listed on
the first page.
Aside from complaints about
the second page of senate candi
dates, Krauss said "the only
problem that we had was long
voting lines."
