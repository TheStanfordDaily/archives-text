# SLAC isolates elusive particle

Outpacing their European
counterparts, physicists at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center completed a series of
successful tests last week on an
experimental linear collider that
promises to provide new insight
into the fundamental forces of
matter.
The tests resulted in the pro
duction of neutral "Z" particles
that are partially responsible for
binding matter.
Scientists have onlv known of

the existence of Z particles for
four to five years, according to
Charles Prescott, associate di
rector of the SLAC Research Di
vision.
The new collider was inexpen
sive, Prescott said, costing only
$10 million. Additional costs for
the entire project will total $105
million.
Stanford scientists hope this
project will be the prototype for
a line of similar accelerators
that operate less expensively
than the older, larger models
currently being used in Europe.

Another two years will be re
quired to produce the Z particles
with the more expensive Euro
pean devices.
SLAC physicists expect to
begin collecting data within the
next month, and by 1989 they
hope to produce tens of
thousands of Z particles for
study.
However, the production of
the particles is somewhat
governed by chance. Z particles

Physicists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center have developed a new method to isolate
the "Z" particle, which is believed to be associated with the "weak" force, a fundamental force
binding matter. Electrons and positrons travel the length of the two-mile-long track, separate
and collide after a half-mile loop to generate the mysterious Z particle.
are only created when positrons
and electrons collide, and there is
no guarantee that a collision will
occur.
The entire operation takes place
underground in tunnels that
resemble what Prescott described
as a doctor's stethoscope. Posi
trons and electrons are fired from
the linear accelerator, which is
analogous to the "microphone" of
the stethoscope. The particles
travel about two miles, accelerat
ing from a low to a high energy
level.
The tunnel eventually splits
and the positrons go to the right

and the electrons go to the left.
The two beams are guided by
magnets through half-mile-long
tunnels that curve so that the
beams collide in a hall half the
size of a football field.
The accelerator generates 120
pulses per second, yet only
produces "a few Z particles per
second," Prescott said.
After the collision, the unused
positrons and electrons are
dumped in a container usually
filled with aluminum and water.
Although a small amount of ra
dioactivity is produced during the
cooling process, Prescott said
there was no danger.
"The dump operates like a TV,"
he said. "A small amount of elec
trons is present when the TV is
on, but as soon as you turn it off,

they're gone. It isn't like a nuclear
reactor with a radioactive core."
According to Prescott, a num
ber of stringent safety measures
are also instituted to protect em
ployees. For example, the gates
leading into the area are locked
when the accelerator is on, re
stricting access to the test area.
"We're not sure where we're
going," Prescott said. "It's a puz
zle. We have ambitions, but it's
up to future generations to put
our discoveries into use."
