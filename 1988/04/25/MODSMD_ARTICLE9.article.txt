# SLAC isolates elusive particle

Outpacing their European
counterparts, physicists at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center completed a series of
successful tests last week on an
experimental linear collider that
promises to provide new insight
into the fundamental forces of
matter.
The tests resulted in the pro
duction of neutral "Z" particles
that are partially responsible for
binding matter.
Scientists have onlv known of

the existence of Z particles for
four to five years, according to
Charles Prescott, associate di
rector of the SLAC Research Di
vision.
The new collider was inexpen
sive, Prescott said, costing only
$10 million. Additional costs for
the entire project will total $105
million.
Stanford scientists hope this
project will be the prototype for
a line of similar accelerators
that operate less expensively
than the older, larger models
currently being used in Europe.

Another two years will be re
quired to produce the Z particles
with the more expensive Euro
pean devices.
SLAC physicists expect to
begin collecting data within the
next month, and by 1989 they
hope to produce tens of
thousands of Z particles for
study.
However, the production of
the particles is somewhat
governed by chance. Z particles

Physicists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center have developed a new method to isolate
the "Z" particle, which is believed to be associated with the "weak" force, a fundamental force
binding matter. Electrons and positrons travel the length of the two-mile-long track, separate
and collide after a half-mile loop to generate the mysterious Z particle.
