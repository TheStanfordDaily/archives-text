# Pro fros are gone but not forgotten

### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Last week's experimental pro
gram for prospective freshman
was successsful despite cold and
rainy weather, program organi
zers said.
About 500 prospective fresh
men, or "pro fros" — high school
seniors who have been accepted
to Stanford but are still deciding
whether they will attend the Uni
versity — were hosted by students
during Pro Fro Week, which
began April 18 and ended yester
day.
The one-week structure of the
program was a change from last
year, when pro fros could visit
and be hosted anytime in April.
"That's probably why there
seemed to be such an abundance
of pro fros on campus this year,"
said junior Karen Murphy,
housing co-coordinator for the
hosting program.
Murphy said that last year
there were actually about 100
more pro fros, but this year the
guests were just "more concen
trated."

The hosting program
was streamlined this
year by using a com
puter program to
match guests with
hosts.

The would-be Stanford stu
dents were able to attend various
University-sponsored events, in
cluding special campus tours, an
informational ASSU presentation,
and The Mjyors Event, an aca
demic fair designed to provide in
formation about the wide range
of mtyors available at Stanford.
Murphy said that the hosting
program was streamlined this
year by using a computer program
to match guests with hosts.

Packard, a junior, designed a pro
gram to match prospective fresh
men with student hosts according
to academic interests and geo
graphic fc*gions. year pro fros

and hosts were matched by hand.
Murphy also said that this year
there were more student hosts
than pro fros, a situation she at
tributed to effective outreach at
dorm meetings during winter
quarter. Last year there were only
about 250 volunteer student
hosts, she said, and the organizers
"were really scrambling to find
hosts for the whole month."
Programming coordinator
Charles Hauck, a junior who
helped design a calendar of events
for prospective freshman visting
campus, said his main objective
in setting up programming was
"to find everything available on
campus during the week, and let
the pro fros know about it."
Senior Doug Barron, who along
with his roommate hosted two pro
fros, said he thought the experi
ence of being a pro fro would en
courage students to attend Stan
ford because "Stanford sells it
self"
Barron also said he didn't think
the bad weather made much of a
difference on students' percep
tions of the campus, an opinion
that was echoed by other hosts
