General to pay torture damages
SAN FRANCISCO â€” A federal judge yes
terday ordered a powerful genend in Argen
tina's deposed military regime to pay $21.17
million in damages to a torture victim of the
junta's so-called Dirty War against suspected
subversives.
U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti said that
retired Gen. Carlos Suarez Mason directed an
"enterprise of terror" and ordered him to pay
the largest judgment ever in a case of its type
to Horacio Martinez-Baca, an Argentine lawyer
who was imprisoned without charges and tor
tured for four years in Buenos Aires-area pris
ons.
Suarez Mason, 64, commanded the First
Army Corps in the Buenos Aires region from
1976 to 1979, during the height of the military
rule, and at a time when soldiers abducted,
imprisoned, tortured and murdered thousands
of people they suspected of being subversives.
Conti said that although Suarez Mason did
not "personally apply the electric prods" used
to torture Martinez-Baca, the lawyer's inter
rogators "were acting under defendant's direct
supervision and control."
"The evidence shows that defendant was
aware of all that went on below him," Conti
said in the eight-page ruling dated Friday and
released yesterday.
Arms sale to Saudi Arabia stalled
WASHINGTON - The Reagan administra
tion, reacting to congressional concern about
Saudi Arabia's secret purchase of Chinese,
medium-range ballistic missiles, has postponed
formal notification to Congress of a proposed
$450 million Saudi arms sale to allow more
time for consultations, State Department of
ficials said yesterday.
The officials announced the delay after a
bipartisan group of 187 House members sent
a letter to Secretary of State George Shultz
opposing the sale of ground support equipment
for the Airborne Warning and Control Systems
(AWACS) radar planes sold by the United
States to Saudi Arabia in 1981. Earlier this
month, a similar appeal was sent to Shultz
by 58 senators, who called the missiles "a
threat to the entire region."
The officials said that while no decisions
have been made, the administration's inclina
tion is to try to go ahead with the sale because,
as one official said, "effective functioning of
the AWACS planes is in the U.S. interest."
Data collected by the planes' surveillance
flights is shared with U.S. warships operating
to keep the Persian Gulf open to oil tanker
shipping amid the violence of the Iran-Iraq
war.
However, the U.S.-Saudi arms supply rela
tionship was subjected to new strains last
month by the revelation that the kingdom was
importing Chinese CSS2-class missiles whose
range of about 1,600 miles makes them capable
of striking almost any point in the Middle
East and parts of the Soviet Union.
