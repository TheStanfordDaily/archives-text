# 'Ivan' sentenced
## Demjanjuk to be hanged in Israel 
### 
JERUSALEM — Declaring that
certain deeds "can never be for
given in law or in the hearts of
men," a Jerusalem court yester
day sentenced retired Cleveland
auto worker John Demjanjuk to
death by hanging for World War
II crimes at the Treblinka exter
mination camp in Poland.
The sentence, only the second
death penalty pronounced in Is
rael's 40-year history, was greeted
by prolonged applause, dancing,
and singing in the converted
theater that has served for the
last 14 months as Demjanjuk's
courtroom.
"The nation of Israel lives!" the
joyous spectators sang while three
Treblinka survivors, who had
identified Demjanjuk as the cruel
camp guard known as "Ivan the
Terrible," wept in the front row.
The condemned man reacted to
the decision with an almost im
perceptible shake of his head, but
was otherwise expressionless.
"I am innocent!" he shouted in
Hebrew as he was wheeled into
the courtroom early yesterday af
ternoon to hear Judge Zvi Tal
pronounce sentence.
The sentence means that the
verdict will now go automatically
before the country's High Court
of Appeals under an Israeli law

that provides for such a review
in any case involving capital pun
ishment.
The condemned man's son,
John Demjanjuk Jr., termed the
decision an "injustice" that; will
"shame the Israeli government,
the Israeli Justice Department,
the U.S. Justice Department, and
most unfortunately, the (> million
murdered in the Holocaust."
The three-judge pane, that
heard Demjanjuk's case
deliberated the sentence for more
than three hours. Reading their
decision, Judge Tal acknowledged
that "almost 50 years have
elapsed since Treblinka. We have
established a new life, and we ask
ourselves if time alleviates the
crime; if time dulls the pain, and
a person who has changed his
course in life need not be punished
as harshly.
"This holds true for some
crimes," Tal said, "but not for
those listed in the verdict. . . .
These crimes can never be for
given in law or in the hearts of
men. These crimes can never be
obliterated from memory. It is as
though Treblinka continues to ex
ist, as though the blood of the
victims still cries out to us."
