# Court to reconsider civil rights decision
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Supreme
Court, signaling that a new conservative
majority may have taken control, an
nounced yesterday that it would recon
sider whether an 1866 civil rights law
prohibits private racial discrimination.
In a highly unusual step, the court
voted 5-4 to reopen a 1976 ruling that
outlawed racist white academies. Cas
ting the key vote was Anthony Kennedy,
the newest justice, who joined the court
in February.
The surprise action angered the
court's liberals and left civil rights adv
ocates fearing a sweeping attack on civil
rights rulings from the past three
decades. Legal experts said that yester
day's announcement suggested a will
ingness by a five-member conservative
majority to reopen and possibly roll back
well-established court precedents.
"I am at a loss to understand the
motivation of five members of this court
to reconsider an interpretation of a civil
rights statute that so clearly reflects our
society's earnest commitment to ending
racial discrimination and in which
Congress has so evidently acquiesced,"
wrote Justice Harry Blackmun.
"I can find no justification for the
bare majority's apparent eagerness to

consider rewriting well-established law,"
Blackmun said.
Arthur Spitzer, legal director of the
American Civil Liberties Union in Wash
ington, said: "Basic civil rights decisions
now may considered open for attack."
Because past rulings upholding affirm
ative action were often decided by 5-4
votes, he said "the whole affirmative
action area" may be reconsidered.
It was just this fear of an activist
conservative court that prompted civil
rights groups to undertake a successful
attack against Senate confirmation of
Robert Bork, President Reagan's first
choice to fill the seat vacated last year
by retiring Justice Lewis Powell.
Kennedy, while a conservative, was
believed to share Powell's reluctance to
overturn settled legal doctrines, and he
gained easy Senate confirmation.
At immediate issue is an interpreta
tion of the 1866 Civil Rights Act that
gave blacks equal rights to whites in
the ability "to make and enforce con
tracts." In rulings in 1968 and 1976,
the high court said this meant that
blacks could sue whites for damages if
the whites refused to deal with them.
