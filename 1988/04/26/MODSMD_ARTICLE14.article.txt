# Reagan rebuffs Gorbachev
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — One month before
President Reagan's summit in Moscow,
his spokesman yesterday castigated the
Kremlin's "needlessly inflammatory"
response to Reagan's speech last week
criticizing Soviet policy in Afghanistan.
"The very harsh rhetoric ... to
describe the president's speech is most
unfortunate," said Marlin Fitzwater, the
spokesman. "We trust it does not signal
a move away from the steadily improving
relations that the Soviet Union has
espoused in its recent past."
Another administration official,
speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said the Soviets were engaging in pre
summit posturing — "the old cat and
mouse type of thing" — prompted to
some extent by Gorbachev's own domes
tic concerns stemming from a senior
colleague's challenge and a stagnant eco
nomy.
Gorbachev, at the end of two days of
meetings with Secretary of State George
Shultz, launched a bitter verbal attack
last Friday on Reagan's "confrontation
al" approach to U.S.-Soviet relations,
according to an account by Tass, the
Soviet press agency.
"We have so far been showing

restraint," Gorbachev was quoted as say
ing. "But if we do reciprocate — and
we can do so over a very wide range of
issues — the atmosphere in Soviet-
American relations can become such as
to make it no longer possible to solve
any further issues."
The verbal volleys between Washing
ton and Moscow come at a time when
officials here are conceding that the two
sides will be unable to reach agreement
on a treaty cutting by half the super
powers' arsenals of long-range nuclear
weapons, the goal of ongoing negotia
tions in Geneva.
Moreover, Gorbachev's leadership ap
pears to be coming under increasing
challenge at home.
There were indications in Moscow last
week that he had moved against Com
munist Party ideology chief Yegor Ligac
hev, considered the No. 2 man in the
Soviet hierarchy, after repeated reports
of clashes between the two. And on Sun
day, U.S. intelligence agencies reported
that the Soviet economy went into a
slump last year and that the short-term
prospects for renewed growth were not
favorable.
