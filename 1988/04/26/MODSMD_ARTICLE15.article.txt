# Marine Corps rejects wider women's role
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The com
mandant of the Marine Corps has
rejected or narrowed many of the
recommendations of a task force
that urged sweeping efforts to
open new jobs to women and
equalize recruiting standards for
both sexes.
Some top Pentagon officials
have rebuked Marine Corps Com
mandant Gen. Alfred Gray for his
actions and even before the
report's release yesterday Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci over
ruled Gray on one issue â€”
whether women can serve as se
curity guards in U.S. embassies.
Carlucci has ordered a review
of at least one other Gray deci
sion. The commandant rejected
some of his task force's key efforts
to broaden career fields for
women and abolish Marine rules
that require higher educational
and intelligence levels for women
than men recruits.
At the same time, Gray ac
knowledged that sexual harass
ment is a serious problem in the

Marine Corps and has issued new
orders to all of its officers declar
ing that "sexual harassment, even
in its most subtle form, will not
be condoned."
The Marine Corps chief also
said that although the service's
policies toward women are not
discriminatory, the anti-woman
attitudes of many commanders
have become "unwritten policy,"
thwarting the careers of women
members.
While approving some recom
mendations aimed at improvifig
women's rights in the Marine
Corps, Gray rejected other con
troversial proposals, including al
lowing women in pilot, security
force and embassy-security guard
units and permitting women to
participate in offensive combat
training.
Gray and top Pentagon civilian
officials have been battling
privately for months over the
Marine report on women in the
service.
