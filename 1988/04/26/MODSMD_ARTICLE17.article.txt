## The 						ASSU follies 
### 
SOME THINGS ripen with
age, but ASSU elections rot.
The ASSU Spring Election,
which should have been over two
weeks ago, will not be complete
until next Monday, when the final
late overseas ballots are scheduled
to trickle in.
Establishing polls for students
at overseas campuses is a fine idea.
It says so right in the ASSU
bylaws: "All overseas campuses
with more than 10 [students] in
residence shall be provided appro
priate polling facilities for all gen
eral elections."
This year, however, overseas
campuses did not receive those
polling facilities, forcing the ASSU
Senate into a quandary after it
was discovered that the approxi
mately 200 students at those cam
puses had been disenfranchised in
the election.
Should an election be validated
when so many students have been
silenced? Can an election be con
sidered fair if students submit bal
lots after the election day?
The senate's decision to send the
late ballots was correct. But it was
nonetheless a necessary evil.
Elections Commissioner Steve
Baer, who decided in January not
to bother with overseas polling
sites in order to save time and
make the new computerized voting
system run smoothly, says that
those 200 votes don't really matter
because they were only a small
part of the electorate.
But this election was marked by
several close margins of defeat and
victory — including the Black Stu

dent Union's fee request loss by
eight votes. Two hundred votes
may as well have been a million.
Baer says that overseas students
had every chance to vote. To be
sure, the bylaws allow students to
request ballots themselves up to
two working days before the
opening of the polls.
Baer assumed that this clause
would compensate for his decision
to ax the institutionalized polling
sites. So ironically, the bylaws both
support and refute Baer.
But Baer's action, and the com
plicity of the Council of Presidents
and senate in the matter by not
discovering and objecting to the
decision when Baer brought it to
them for approval, is irresponsible
at best and grossly undemocratic
at worst.
Baer's assumption that overseas
students don't care about the elec
tion sets him about as far apart
from the job description of Elec
tions Commissioner as one could
get.
The BSU didn't force this chain
of events, contrary to Baer's claims
that it lobbied hard for the senate
to send the ballots overseas. Lousy
supervision of the elections did.
Everyone loses in this situation.
But then again, this isn't the
first instance of screwed-up elec
tions or of confusion over the
bylaws' meanings. Until the
bylaws are rewritten, the garbled
rules will continue to be misin
terpreted. And the elections will
continue to suffer. Tune in next
year for more thrills, chills and
spills.
