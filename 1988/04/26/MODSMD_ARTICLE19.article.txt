## Vanna a sign of times 
### 
AT A RECENT White House party
for the press corps, entertainment
stars Vanna White and Sylvester
Stallone stole the show — don't ask me
what they were doing at the dinner, but
rumor has it that Vanna entertains ambi
tions of becoming a "commentator." God
help us.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported
that their presence at this gathering at
tracted much attention. Amid popping
flashbulbs and general hullabaloo, one
reporter even asked Vanna what she
thought of the candidates in the upcom
ing presidential race. Showing the kind
of complexity of thought that has become
her trademark, the sex symbol tossed
back her freshly pressed and curled head
and said, "May the best man win."
It is an otiose exercise to register com
plaints when this woman gets front-page
press. The slightly sneering, leering tone
of the occasional commentary excepted,
the press generally has been very kind
to Vanna. Of course, it seems almost
mean spirited to pick on such an easy
target.
However, as the closest thing America
has to the sex symbol of the '80s, dis
missal does not give Vanna her fair due.
Wheel of Fortune's co-host may not have
reached the distinct cultural plateau of
"the sex symbol" for this decade, as Far
rah, Raquel and Marilyn did in the ones
preceding her, but with posters of her
selling over 100,000 copies each, her book
"Vanna Speaks" sold to Warner Publish
ers at an advance of $250,000 and re
ceiving, according to Newsweek, up to

three product-endorsement offers a week,
Vanna has distinguished herself as a cul
tural phenomenon, above and beyond or
dinary bimbohood, worthy of evaluation.
Why has Vanna made it? 0.K., she is
good looking, stacked and willing, basic
qualities for a sex symbol, but so what!
There are tens of thousands of women
in Hollywood who fill this description.
Well, she has more exposure than these
other women; she turns letters on
America's most popular game show. This
explains part of Vanna's popularity, but
it still won't explain what distinguished
her from other women with similar
prime-time exposure — like Charlene and
Victoria from "Dallas," Joan and Linda
from "Dynasty" and Janet from"The
Price is Right."
The real secret to Vanna's success is
clearly her vacuity. Decode the message
behind Merv Griffin's words (he started
Wheel of Fortune and gave Vanna the
letter-turning job), "She has a wonderful
vulnerability and helplessness."
Translate: because she is not very
bright people don't feel threatened by
her; they even feel sympathy for her.
"Stupidity equals sexiness" is the mes
sage Vanna and her admirers send out.
(Actually, stupid is a bit harsh. Pleasantly
vapid more accurately describes the
woman who blithely uttered the most
anti-feminist line of all time, "I enjoy
getting dressed up as a Barbie Doll.")
So before we pass this lady by, dis
missing her sexual stature as an anomaly,
remember Vanna is a type of cultural

barometer, her popularity is a spontane
ous public reaction.
Now compare her to Marilyn Monroe,
perhaps the ultimate female sex symbol,
a product of '50s, a pre-feminized era.
The similarities between the two are not
hard to discern, i.e. big-breasted and
brainless. It should give pause to wonder
among women who think they are living
after the feminist revolution. Have we
really come a long way, baby?

In last week's column I reported the
ASSU had allocated $8,000 in funds to
televise themselves. I was wrong. In fact
the ASSU considered such a plan but
trashed it and passed instead a much
smaller allocation as an experiment. Cer
tainly with all the ASSU does do wrong,
it is unfair that it got bad press when
it made a cautious decision. I apologize
to the ASSU for any harm I may have
caused its reputation on this account.
However, despite protests from the ASSU
Senate Chair Dave Smolen to the con
trary, I stand by my original assertion
that Senate meetings are painfully
boring.
