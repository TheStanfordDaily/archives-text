# COP veto halts attempts to fill public affairs post

### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Nominating students for ASSU
director of public affairs has ap
parently become as difficult as
nominating U.S. Supreme Court
justices.
Despite the fact that the nom
ination process has been used
three times in an attempt to fill
the position, the Council of Presi
dents vetoed the nomination of
junior Rachel Wiesen last week
end. COP member Leonard Adler
said the COP action was because
of an unresolved question related
to a reference named on Wiesen's
resume.
The COP also resorted to the
veto because the group was dis
satisfied with the interviewing
process that led up to the nomi
nation, at which only three out
of 10 graduate senators were pres
ent, Adler said.
Though the number of senators
present was still high enough to

constitute a quorum, the COP
wanted to be sure that a large
majority of the senate was present
to make a decision about the of
fice, according to Adler.
COP member Jim Durkin said
that because of the "nature" of
the concerns about Wiesen's nom
ination, the precise reasons for
the veto will be kept confidential
until they are investigated.
Wiesen did not want to make
a full statement until the reasons
for the veto are known, explaining
that any comments she made
might be "more detrimental than
helpful" to the review process.
She added that since the COP did
not contact her, she could not de
termine "who the battle is be
tween" or what reasons exist for
the veto.
Despite the veto, the ASSU Sen
ate will have another chance to
fill the position by overturning
the veto at its next meeting on
May 2. If the senate does not
muster the two-thirds vote needed

to override the veto, the Senate
Chair's Task Force on ASSU Staff
Hiring would probably be charged
with identifying a solution to the
nomination problem, according to
Senate Chair Dave Smolen, a
senior.
The director of public affairs
nominations came under fire
three weeks ago when the Black
Student Union charged that "in
stitutional racism" may have been
involved in a committee's selec
tion of sophomore Deanna Ter
zian, a white student, over
Wiesen, a black student.
The senate sent the nomination
to a second committee that re
interviewed candidates and rec
ommended Wiesen instead of Ter
zian. But a senate oversight al
lowed a member of the original
selection committee to sit on the
second committee, so the senate
again rejected the nomination.
The task force decided that the
