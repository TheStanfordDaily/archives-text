# COP veto halts attempts to fill public affairs post
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Nominating students for ASSU
director of public affairs has ap
parently become as difficult as
nominating U.S. Supreme Court
justices.
Despite the fact that the nom
ination process has been used
three times in an attempt to fill
the position, the Council of Presi
dents vetoed the nomination of
junior Rachel Wiesen last week
end. COP member Leonard Adler
said the COP action was because
of an unresolved question related
to a reference named on Wiesen's
resume.
The COP also resorted to the
veto because the group was dis
satisfied with the interviewing
process that led up to the nomi
nation, at which only three out
of 10 graduate senators were pres
ent, Adler said.
Though the number of senators
present was still high enough to

constitute a quorum, the COP
wanted to be sure that a large
majority of the senate was present
to make a decision about the of
fice, according to Adler.
COP member Jim Durkin said
that because of the "nature" of
the concerns about Wiesen's nom
ination, the precise reasons for
the veto will be kept confidential
until they are investigated.
Wiesen did not want to make
a full statement until the reasons
for the veto are known, explaining
that any comments she made
might be "more detrimental than
helpful" to the review process.
She added that since the COP did
not contact her, she could not de
termine "who the battle is be
tween" or what reasons exist for
the veto.
Despite the veto, the ASSU Sen
ate will have another chance to
fill the position by overturning
the veto at its next meeting on
May 2. If the senate does not
muster the two-thirds vote needed

to override the veto, the Senate
Chair's Task Force on ASSU Staff
Hiring would probably be charged
with identifying a solution to the
nomination problem, according to
Senate Chair Dave Smolen, a
senior.
The director of public affairs
nominations came under fire
three weeks ago when the Black
Student Union charged that "in
stitutional racism" may have been
involved in a committee's selec
tion of sophomore Deanna Ter
zian, a white student, over
Wiesen, a black student.
The senate sent the nomination
to a second committee that re
interviewed candidates and rec
ommended Wiesen instead of Ter
zian. But a senate oversight al
lowed a member of the original
selection committee to sit on the
second committee, so the senate
again rejected the nomination.
The task force decided that the
best way to get a nomination con
firmed would be to hold an en
tirely new set of interviews in
front of the full senate. The sen
ate nominated and confirmed
Wiesen for the position one week
ago.
Terzian said yesterday that she
is no longer interested in regain
ing the position, which she held
this year. "This whole selection
process has gone on a long time.
I don't know if anyone can handle
(this type of pressure)," she said.
Terzian also said she did not
know the COPs' reasoning behind
the veto of Wiesen's nomination,
but said she believes the COP has
"other reasons that don't involve
me directly."
Graduate senator David Teich
also was at a loss to explain the
COP's veto of the Wiesen nomi
nation, but said he believes the
veto will be overturned by the
senate. "No matter how people
voted, unless there is something
really major that went wrong, I'm

sure senators will support the sen
ate decision," he said.
Teich said that after the full
senate determined the nomina
tion last Tuesday, he and most
senators "thought we were done.
We had a quorum, we held the
interviews and we chose some
body," he explained. Teich said
he was surprised by the veto, add
ing that "when the ASSU starts
working like real politics, it's
scary."
Senior Stacey Leyton, deputy

senate chair and member of the
COP-elect, said she was not sur
prised by the veto. "The present
COP has been against Rachel
(Wiesen) all along," she said. "The
veto is just a continuation of
that."
Terzian said the senate vote will
"depend on the COP's reason" for
the veto, but said senate fatigue
over the nomination may play a
role. "If I'm tired of the process,
and I have a vested interest in
the office, I can imagine how the
senate feels," she said.
Terzian said she "fought for the
principle at first," but said "too
many politics are involved" for
her to continue. "I'd have to be
lieve in the institution to go
around publicly supporting it,"
she said, concluding that she
"tends to question the integrity
of the ASSU for not resolving the
issue."
Wiesen said Terzian's decision
not to continue pursuing the po
sition shows that the selection
process has become "uglier than
necessary."
"It's a shame that they (ASSU
officials) scared away Deanna,"
she said.
