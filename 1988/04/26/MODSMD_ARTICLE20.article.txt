## Humane animal research brings medical progress 
### 
THE ASTOUNDING level of
misinformation and illogical
conclusions in Patricia Elsen's
April 19 letter serves to derail a noble
minded cause. Concern over the misuse
and inhumane treatment of animals in
biomedical research is a daily struggle
for humanitarian doctors and scientists
such as ourselves.
We applaud efforts that would make
animal research less brutal, more
rational and limited to only those
studies where it is absolutely neces
sary. (The latter, incidentally, is one of
the primary considerations for approval
of animal protocols at Stanford). How
ever, several points need clarification.
Elsen, after reviewing the number of
animal studies done on valium, asks,
"Why prescribe drugs for anxiety and

not meditation, bio-feedback and social
support . . . who is really served by
many such drugs?" Obviously, she has
never witnessed the dramatic and
positive effects of psychoactive drugs
such as valium and lithium for people
with seizure disorders or serious psy
chiatric problems; or the life-saving
effects of nitroglycerine for heart
patients; or insulin for diabetics; not to
mention antibiotics and vaccines for
polio, measles, smallpox, rubella and
diphtheria. Has she never been given
any of these drugs?
Elsen claims that scientists "cannot
discriminate trivial studies from impor
tant work." Perhaps she, as a Palo
Alto resident, is qualified to review
these protocols rather than the Na
tional Institutes of Health, where, after
highly competitive peer review, less

than 10 percent of grant proposals are
funded.
And, perhaps she can differentiate
the trivial from important work. Would
she have had the insight to fund the
seemingly repetitive research on dogs
which led to the discovery that the
pancreas secretes insulin? Or the
animal work on cyclosporin which has
made modern organ transplantation
possible? Or the many other seren
dipitous discoveries that have led to
major scientific and medical
breakthroughs?
Finally, Elsen claims that "the es
tablishment refuses to set up a data
bank where previous research can be
checked. ..." This last statement
makes it clear that she has never set
foot in a science library or she would

know of such resources as the Science
Citation Index and Med-Line, a com
puter literature search service.
We and other scientists use these
services all the time or else our field
would be impossible to follow, and you
can rest assured that the National
Institutes of Health and the National
Science Foundation use them too, as
they have not been known to fund
many proposals that needlessly repeat
previous work.
In conclusion, may we suggest that
there may be "wisdom we have lost in
knowledge", but that knowledge and
accurate information is a prerequisite
for any conclusion, let alone for the
gaining of wisdom.
