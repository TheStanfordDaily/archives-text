# AASA works for the entire campus

The April 20 letter by David Kang
claiming that "minority groups are
hypocritical" made several statements
showing a disconcerting lack of knowl
edge and respect for the Asian-
American Students Association and
what it stands for. I would like to
clarify the purpose and goals of the
AASA.
Our organization serves the entire
Stanford community and provides an
opportunity for Asian-Americans and
oth interested students to learn
abon 1 and come to grips with their
iden -i and abilities.
1 \ASA also functions as a
resoujoe and supj wt organization with
the goal of strengthening the Asian-
Amorican community at Stanford by
j in< tin' awareness of the social,
cult'i 'I 'Cid political issues facing

Asian-Americans today.
The AASA most certainly encourages
the presentation of diverse opinions
and incidentally, no political stands are
taken without a democratic process.
It is ironic that Kang feels excluded
from the AASA since we have never
had the pleasure of his presence at a
meeting this year. If he had attended
he would find it surprisingly easy to
share his opinions and perhaps even
find support for them.
Furthermore, I find it an insult to
the members of the AASA to claim
without basis that the group would
resort to the use of racist, derogatory
labels mentioned by Kang.
The AASA provides a service to the
Stanford community, meaning there is
no requirement or pressure on anyone
to join. Whether or not you feel you
are a minority is a personal opinion.
The AASA does attempt to increase
sensitivity to minority issues, but its
activities are open to minorities and
non-minorities alike.

The AASA will always have its ears
and its mind open, so try talking with
us.
