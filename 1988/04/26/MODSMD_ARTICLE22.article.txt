# Students were rude at Bennett's speech
## 
### 
1 was extremely embarrassed at the
behavior of fellow students during the
question and answer period that fol
lowed U.S. Secretary of Education
William Bennett's speech last Monday.
Granted, some of Bennett's com
ments were inflammatory, but this in
no way justified the display that fol
lowed. One would hope that Stanford
students could subdue their passions
long enough to state their questions
civilly and to muster the patience to
listen to the Secretary's complete re
sponses.
Bennett, like any other invited

speaker, deserves at least that much
respect.
Many of those recognized during the
question and answer period substituted
opinions for questions. Some of these
statements were marked by fawning
praise, others by insult and condescen
sion and virtually all by incoherence.
The statements became a source of
humiliation for all members of the
audience. Supporters of Bennett should
be reminded that sycophantic com
ments such as "We are so glad you are
finally here" are best left to fan mail.
Critics of Bennett should recall that
pompous monologues and rude inter
ruptions are inappropriate in any set
ting, especially in one attempting to
encourage open debate.
The bottom line is that Bennett's
speech was to be followed by a ques
tion and answer period, not a barrage
of praise and blame.
