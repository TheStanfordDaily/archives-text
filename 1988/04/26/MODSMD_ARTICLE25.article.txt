## Bug biology: an examination of the whale phallus

Dear Bug,
When is the long awaited "Men
of LOTS" pinup calendar ex
pected to arrive?
— Robin
Just as soon as the men do.
And speaking of LOTS, don't
forget to keep sending those
bizarre, obscene or just plain use
less questions to The Bug at Bug-
Me (not B.Bug-Me) at the
tragedies on LOTS. Or send them
to Bug Me, The Stanford Daily,

Dear Hug,
During a heated discussion, my
friend and 1 made a bet regarding

the anatomy of various large
mammals. Naturally, to settle. it
we decided to turn to the most
respected authority on campus,
The Bug. How large is the
reproductive organ of a male blue
whale? A respectable sum rides
upon the answer.
—- Moby Dick
Now then, can we please dis
pense with this "male reproduc
tive organ" nonsense and refer
hereafter to the whale's member
by its scientific name: the
"schlong."
Surprising as it may seem,
Moby, there isn't a whole lot of
literature out there dealing with
the private member of the blue
whale — Balaenoptera Musculus
to you scientific types. There are
a couple reasons for the dearth
of research in this area, not the
least of which is that the whale's
privates don't hang out there
where everybody can see them,
but rather are neatly tucked in
side the body, ready to emerge
for mating or at whale fraternity
parties.
When not being used, the
cetacean penis is curled up inside
the body in an S-shape, attached
to the pelvic bone by two rigid
muscles. When these muscles
slacken and the body of the organ
fills with blood, the penis is

pushed out of a slit in the whale's
body and is ready for action.
Having dealt scientifically with
the anatomical specifications, it's
time to dive into the more
prurient vital statistics. I'd
strongly recommend at this point
that you sit down, pour yourself
a stiff drink and ask the children
to leave the room. Remember, this
data is being given for informa
tional purposes only and should
not be used in an imprudent man
ner — such as to gross people out.
Assuming your large male blue
whale is rougly 90 to 100 feet
long and weighs 130 tons, you
can expect the sucker to have a
penis which is roughly 10 feet
long and a foot in diameter.
This is not a typo — 10 feet.
(Don't think I can't hear you
snickering!)
To put this into perspective, the
average 5-foot-10 human would
need a seven-inch span, erect, to
have the same body length to

penis length ratio as the blue
whale. The blue whale's testes,
which are on the inside of the
body, behind the kidneys, can be
up to two-and-a-half feet long and
weigh 100 pounds. I refuse to try
to put this into a human perspec
tive, as I am not about to try to
weigh my . . . oh, never mind.
So what does a blue whale do
with a 10-foot wiener? As it turns
out, not a whole heck of a lot.
Blue whales, it seems, are only
privileged to mate during one
short period of the year, unlike
some higher order creatures
which mate, say, every Thursday
night. In fact, there is a great
deal of speculation about exactly
how whales even go about mating,
because: (a) they do it under
water, and (b) it lasts less than
30 seconds. It is generally ac
knowledged that whales mate side
by side near the surface of the
water, or belly to belly while
poking vertically out of the ocean.

In any event, whales are known
to be very gentle and tender dur
ing courtship and copulation, dur
ing which they make those mys
terious whale sounds that are
known to arouse scientists. An
English translation of those
sounds might be as follows:
Male whale: "Hey babe, I've got
a 10-foot male reproductive or
gan."
Female whale: "Oh yeah?
(Snicker, snicker.) I've got 30
seconds to kill."
Interestingly, in big whales the
only skin that is smooth enough
for human use is that which
covers the penis. Although it had
no commercial value, whalers of
ten used to turn the skin of the
blue whale penis into useful do
mestic articles. Such as a sofa.
Dear Bug,
Why on a baseball do you have
the laces in this continuous line
that curves around the ball and
eventually comes back on itself?
Why didn't they do it in hemi
spheres or stuff?
- JWL
Or stuff? OK, pal, it's time for
a basic lesson in geometry. Go get
a piece of paper and cut out a
circle with a diameter of about
four-and-a-half inches. Got it?
Now, pretending that the piece of

paper is a piece of leather, try to
fit it over one-half of the baseball.
No problem, right?
Wrong!
You should be aware from high
school math that it is impossible
to flatten out a hemisphere, and,
conversely, it is impossible to turn
a flat surface into a hemisphere.
If you look at your baseball you
will notice that it is constructed
of two pieces of leather, each
shaped something like a
dumbbell.
Although these two pieces can't
actually lie flatly against the sur
face of the ball, they are shaped
in such a way that they minimize
the distortion that occurs when
you try to jam a flat surface onto
a spherical one. This process also
makes the stiches uniform with
respect to both axes.
This has important implications
in pitching the darned thing, be
cause the wind-resistance caused
by the stiches is what allows the
curveball, the knuckleball and
other "moving" pitches to move.
A baseball with one straight
stitching down the middle would
probably act like a frisbee if
thrown correctly, an instrument
of death if thrown incorrectly.
