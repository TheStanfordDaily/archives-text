## Arizona State rolls through and over Card Stanford's hopes of winning Six-Pac and hosting regional are slim after 13-5 loss 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Stanford's hopes
for a Six-Pac title
may have rolled
through Cardinal
third baseman Ed
Sprague's legs yes
terday afternoon.

With the score tied 4-4 in the
fifth inning and the Cardinal
having just staged a stirring come
back against the Sun Devils,
Sprague, a junior, misplayed a
two-out bases-loaded grounder off
the bat of Mike Burrola. Two runs
scored on the play, and the Sun
Devils went on to chalk up three
more unearned runs in the in
ning, breaking the game open and
going on to a 13-5 victory at
Sunken Diamond.
The win gives the Sun Devils
(45-9 overall, 16-8 in the confer
ence) an imposing two-game lead
over the second-place Cardinal
(30-16, 14-10) in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
with six conference games left to
play. At least three teams from
the Six-Pac probably will be in
vited to NCAA postseason play,
but it's likely that only the con
ference champion will be selected
to host a regional tournament.
The Cardinal plays at San Jose
State at 2:30 p.m. today and at
Fresno State at 7 p.m. tomorrow,
then travels to Miami for a non
league series this weekend. Stan
ford returns to league action next
weekend with a series against Cal
ifornia, playing one game at
Sunken Diamond, two in Berkeley

and closes the conference season
at home against USC three weeks
from now.
Arizona State, meanwhile,
takes on the conference's fifth
place team, UCLA, in Tempe,
Ariz., this weekend, has a bye next
weekend and then closes against
cellar-dwelling Arizona in Tucson,
Ariz.
"This puts us behind the eight
ball," Sprague said. "We have to
go out and try to win six of six,
or five of six, which isn't easy
against teams like Cal and USC.
But we can only worry about our
selves. ... [ASU's] destiny is in
its own hands."
Sun Devil Coach Jim Brock,
however, isn't counting his con
ference title before it's won. "We
don't have a lock on it (the Six-Pac
title) at all," he said. "You just
have to be hoping that everybody
beats everybody else so things
stay the way they are."
If the Sun Devils continue to
hit the ball the way they did yes
terday and Sunday against the
Cardinal, any team will be hard
pressed to beat them. ASU, which
scored 15 runs on 16 hits (includ
ing four homers) on Saturday,
piled up 13 runs on 14 hits (in
cluding five doubles and two home
runs) yesterday.
"This is the best we've hit the
ball," Brock said. "Hitting is kind
of like gymnastics or diving —
there's a difficulty factor. And
going against their (Stanford's)
pitchers in their home park, the
difficulty factor is very high, so
that's by far the best we've done
this year."

The Sun Devil onslaught began
early yesterday. Pat Listach led
off the game with a single off
Stanford starter Stan Spencer, a
freshman. John Finn followed
with a double into the left-field
corner, moving Listach to third,
and Kevin Higgins brought both
runners in with a single up the
middle. With one out, Dan Rum
sey homered to right, and the
score was 4-0.
It stayed that way until the bot
tom of the fourth, when the Car
dinal, which had run itself out of
a rally in the second inning, fi
nally got to Sun Devil starter
Gordy Farmer. Sophomore Paul
Carey led off the fourth with an
opposite-field homer to left — his
fifth home run of the year — to
make the score 4-1.
Senior Doug Robbins walked,

losing their second straight to Arizona State.
and then sophomore Brian
Johnson ripped a long fly into the
left-center gap. ASU left-fielder
Ricky Candelari appeared to make
the catch, but the ball actually
glanced off his glove and bounced
off the warning track right back
into his glove. Johnson ended up
with a double, and Robbins
stopped at third. Freshman Mike
Eicher punched a single into left
to score Robbins, and that was
all for Farmer.
Left-hander Rusty Kilgo came
on in relief and struck out junior
Eric DeGraw to get the first out
of the inning. The next batter,
junior Frank Carey, bounced to
second baseman Kevin Higgins
for what looked to be an inning
ending double play. But Higgins
missed Eicher with an attempted
tag, and got only Carey at first.
Johnson scored from third on the
play to make the score 4-3.
Sophomore Troy Paulsen then
singled up the middle to bring
Eicher in from second with the
tying run. The single — Paulsen's
only hit of the day — extended
his hitting streak to 25 games.
The 4-4 tie didn't stand for
long. Chitren had inherited a
bases-loaded mess from Spencer
in the fourth and struck out Bur

rola to escape without any harm
done, but he created his own prob
lems in the fifth.
Steve Willis blooped a single to
right to open the inning, and
Chitren walked Rumsey. Both
runners advanced on Martin
Peralta's groundout to put run
ners on second and third with one
out. Chitren issued an intentional
walk to Tim Spehr to set up a
double play and a force at all
bases.
The strategy seemed to be
paying off when Chitren sawed
off Candelari and induced him to
pop up for the second out of the
inning. When Burrola grounded
a ball down to third, it looked as
though Stanford would get out of
the inning unscathed.
But the ball scooted under
Sprague's glove into right field,
Willis and Rumsey scored, and the
next batter, Listach, ripped a
three-run homer over the left
field fence to give ASU a 9-4 lead.
It looked as though Burrola's
grounder might have taken an un
expected hop on Sprague, but he
said that wasn't the problem. "It
didn't take a bad hop at all," he
said. "I just read the ball wrong
off the bat. ... I should've stayed
back and tagged the bag (for the
force-out at third), but I thought
it was a lot slower than it was —
I thought I needed to come up
on it."
Kilgo shut down the Cardinal

bats the rest of the way, recording
the win to move his record to 6-2,
and the Sun Devils added four in
the ninth to make it a rout. So
maybe Sprague's error didn't
matter that much after all; maybe
the Sun Devils were going to erupt
eventually, anyway.
Sprague doesn't think so. "Ob
viously, [the error] was the turn
ing point of the game," he said.
"We had just come back and tied
the game — we had the momen
tum. I definitely think that if I
catch the ball and make the play,
then we turn around and win the
game. .. .
"I might've cost us the Pac-10
title."
Card notes
The Sunken Diamond faithful were
entertained all weekend by a silver
haired ASU fan who belted out the
National Anthem along with the re
corded version played over the P.A.
system before every game, and who
also warbled a booming "Go, Devils,
go" cheer every other inning.
The man is Ernie Stewart, a retired
musical comedy performer from
Phoenix who was celebrating his 64th
birthday yesterday. Stewart was a
member of the Phoenix Musical
Theater company for 10 years.
He sings his "Go, Devils, go" chorus
before the Sun Devils bat in the first,
third, fifth, seventh and ninth innings
of every game and also delivers the
cheer on "third-down-and-long" situ
ations during Sun Devil football
games.

over the second-place Cardinal
(30-16, 14-10) in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
with six conference games left to
play. At least three teams from
the Six-Pac probably will be in
vited to NCAA postseason play,
but it's likely that only the con
ference champion will be selected
to host a regional tournament.
The Cardinal plays at San Jose
State at 2:30 p.m. today and at
Fresno State at 7 p.m. tomorrow,
then travels to Miami for a non
league series this weekend. Stan
ford returns to league action next
weekend with a series against Cal
ifornia, playing one game at
Sunken Diamond, two in Berkeley

and closes the conference season
at home against USC three weeks
from now.
Arizona State, meanwhile,
takes on the conference's fifth
place team, UCLA, in Tempe,
Ariz., this weekend, has a bye next
weekend and then closes against
cellar-dwelling Arizona in Tucson,
Ariz.
"This puts us behind the eight
ball," Sprague said. "We have to
go out and try to win six of six,
or five of six, which isn't easy
against teams like Cal and USC.
But we can only worry about our
selves. ... [ASU's] destiny is in
its own hands."
Sun Devil Coach Jim Brock,
however, isn't counting his con
ference title before it's won. "We
don't have a lock on it (the Six-Pac
title) at all," he said. "You just
have to be hoping that everybody
beats everybody else so things
stay the way they are."
If the Sun Devils continue to
hit the ball the way they did yes
terday and Sunday against the
Cardinal, any team will be hard
pressed to beat them. ASU, which
scored 15 runs on 16 hits (includ
ing four homers) on Saturday,
piled up 13 runs on 14 hits (in
cluding five doubles and two home
runs) yesterday.
"This is the best we've hit the
ball," Brock said. "Hitting is kind
of like gymnastics or diving —
there's a difficulty factor. And
going against their (Stanford's)
pitchers in their home park, the
difficulty factor is very high, so
that's by far the best we've done
this year."

The Sun Devil onslaught began
early yesterday. Pat Listach led
off the game with a single off
Stanford starter Stan Spencer, a
freshman. John Finn followed
with a double into the left-field
corner, moving Listach to third,
and Kevin Higgins brought both
runners in with a single up the
middle. With one out, Dan Rum
sey homered to right, and the
score was 4-0.
It stayed that way until the bot
tom of the fourth, when the Car
dinal, which had run itself out of
a rally in the second inning, fi
nally got to Sun Devil starter
Gordy Farmer. Sophomore Paul
Carey led off the fourth with an
opposite-field homer to left — his
fifth home run of the year — to
make the score 4-1.
Senior Doug Robbins walked,

Stanford senior Doug Robbins and the rest of the Cardinal nine have that rundown feeling after
losing their second straight to Arizona State.
and then sophomore Brian
Johnson ripped a long fly into the
left-center gap. ASU left-fielder
Ricky Candelari appeared to make
the catch, but the ball actually
glanced off his glove and bounced
off the warning track right back
into his glove. Johnson ended up
with a double, and Robbins
stopped at third. Freshman Mike
Eicher punched a single into left
to score Robbins, and that was
all for Farmer.
Left-hander Rusty Kilgo came
on in relief and struck out junior
Eric DeGraw to get the first out
of the inning. The next batter,
junior Frank Carey, bounced to
second baseman Kevin Higgins
for what looked to be an inning
ending double play. But Higgins
missed Eicher with an attempted
tag, and got only Carey at first.
Johnson scored from third on the
play to make the score 4-3.
Sophomore Troy Paulsen then
singled up the middle to bring
Eicher in from second with the
tying run. The single — Paulsen's
only hit of the day — extended
his hitting streak to 25 games.
The 4-4 tie didn't stand for
long. Chitren had inherited a
bases-loaded mess from Spencer
in the fourth and struck out Bur

rola to escape without any harm
done, but he created his own prob
lems in the fifth.
Steve Willis blooped a single to
right to open the inning, and
Chitren walked Rumsey. Both
runners advanced on Martin
Peralta's groundout to put run
ners on second and third with one
out. Chitren issued an intentional
walk to Tim Spehr to set up a
double play and a force at all
bases.
The strategy seemed to be
paying off when Chitren sawed
off Candelari and induced him to
pop up for the second out of the
inning. When Burrola grounded
a ball down to third, it looked as
though Stanford would get out of
the inning unscathed.
But the ball scooted under
Sprague's glove into right field,
Willis and Rumsey scored, and the
next batter, Listach, ripped a
three-run homer over the left
field fence to give ASU a 9-4 lead.
It looked as though Burrola's
grounder might have taken an un
expected hop on Sprague, but he
said that wasn't the problem. "It
didn't take a bad hop at all," he
said. "I just read the ball wrong
off the bat. ... I should've stayed
back and tagged the bag (for the
force-out at third), but I thought
it was a lot slower than it was —
I thought I needed to come up
on it."
Kilgo shut down the Cardinal

bats the rest of the way, recording
the win to move his record to 6-2,
and the Sun Devils added four in
the ninth to make it a rout. So
maybe Sprague's error didn't
matter that much after all; maybe
the Sun Devils were going to erupt
eventually, anyway.
Sprague doesn't think so. "Ob
viously, [the error] was the turn
ing point of the game," he said.
"We had just come back and tied
the game — we had the momen
tum. I definitely think that if I
catch the ball and make the play,
then we turn around and win the
game. .. .
"I might've cost us the Pac-10
title."
Card notes
The Sunken Diamond faithful were
entertained all weekend by a silver
haired ASU fan who belted out the
National Anthem along with the re
corded version played over the P.A.
system before every game, and who
also warbled a booming "Go, Devils,
go" cheer every other inning.
The man is Ernie Stewart, a retired
musical comedy performer from
Phoenix who was celebrating his 64th
birthday yesterday. Stewart was a
member of the Phoenix Musical
Theater company for 10 years.
He sings his "Go, Devils, go" chorus
before the Sun Devils bat in the first,
third, fifth, seventh and ninth innings
of every game and also delivers the
cheer on "third-down-and-long" situ
ations during Sun Devil football
games.
Stanford's hopes
for a Six-Pac title
may have rolled
through Cardinal
third baseman Ed
Sprague's legs yes
terday afternoon.

With the score tied 4-4 in the
fifth inning and the Cardinal
having just staged a stirring come
back against the Sun Devils,
Sprague, a junior, misplayed a
two-out bases-loaded grounder off
the bat of Mike Burrola. Two runs
scored on the play, and the Sun
Devils went on to chalk up three
more unearned runs in the in
ning, breaking the game open and
going on to a 13-5 victory at
Sunken Diamond.
The win gives the Sun Devils
(45-9 overall, 16-8 in the confer

takes on the conference's fifth
place team, UCLA, in Tempe,
Ariz., this weekend, has a bye next
weekend and then closes against
cellar-dwelling Arizona in Tucson,
Ariz.
"This puts us behind the eight
ball," Sprague said. "We have to
go out and try to win six of six,
or five of six, which isn't easy
against teams like Cal and USC.
But we can only worry about our
selves. ... [ASU's] destiny is in
its own hands."
Sun Devil Coach Jim Brock,
however, isn't counting his con
ference title before it's won. "We
don't have a lock on it (the Six-Pac
title) at all," he said. "You just
have to be hoping that everybody
beats everybody else so things
stay the way they are."
If the Sun Devils continue to
hit the ball the way they did yes
terday and Sunday against the
Cardinal, any team will be hard
pressed to beat them. ASU, which
scored 15 runs on 16 hits (includ
ing four homers) on Saturday,
piled up 13 runs on 14 hits (in
cluding five doubles and two home
runs) yesterday.
"This is the best we've hit the
ball," Brock said. "Hitting is kind
of like gymnastics or diving —
there's a difficulty factor. And
going against their (Stanford's)
pitchers in their home park, the
difficulty factor is very high, so
that's by far the best we've done
this year."

The Sun Devil onslaught began
early yesterday. Pat Listach led
off the game with a single off
Stanford starter Stan Spencer, a
freshman. John Finn followed
with a double into the left-field
corner, moving Listach to third,
and Kevin Higgins brought both
runners in with a single up the
middle. With one out, Dan Rum
sey homered to right, and the
score was 4-0.
It stayed that way until the bot
tom of the fourth, when the Car
dinal, which had run itself out of
a rally in the second inning, fi
nally got to Sun Devil starter
Gordy Farmer. Sophomore Paul
Carey led off the fourth with an
opposite-field homer to left — his
fifth home run of the year — to
make the score 4-1.
Senior Doug Robbins walked,

losing their second straight to Arizona State.
and then sophomore Brian
Johnson ripped a long fly into the
left-center gap. ASU left-fielder
Ricky Candelari appeared to make
the catch, but the ball actually
glanced off his glove and bounced
off the warning track right back
into his glove. Johnson ended up
with a double, and Robbins
stopped at third. Freshman Mike
Eicher punched a single into left
to score Robbins, and that was
all for Farmer.
Left-hander Rusty Kilgo came
on in relief and struck out junior
Eric DeGraw to get the first out
of the inning. The next batter,
junior Frank Carey, bounced to
second baseman Kevin Higgins
for what looked to be an inning
ending double play. But Higgins
missed Eicher with an attempted
tag, and got only Carey at first.
Johnson scored from third on the
play to make the score 4-3.
Sophomore Troy Paulsen then
singled up the middle to bring
Eicher in from second with the
tying run. The single — Paulsen's
only hit of the day — extended
his hitting streak to 25 games.
The 4-4 tie didn't stand for
long. Chitren had inherited a
bases-loaded mess from Spencer
in the fourth and struck out Bur

rola to escape without any harm
done, but he created his own prob
lems in the fifth.
Steve Willis blooped a single to
right to open the inning, and
Chitren walked Rumsey. Both
runners advanced on Martin
Peralta's groundout to put run
ners on second and third with one
out. Chitren issued an intentional
walk to Tim Spehr to set up a
double play and a force at all
bases.
The strategy seemed to be
paying off when Chitren sawed
off Candelari and induced him to
pop up for the second out of the
inning. When Burrola grounded
a ball down to third, it looked as
though Stanford would get out of
the inning unscathed.
But the ball scooted under
Sprague's glove into right field,
Willis and Rumsey scored, and the
next batter, Listach, ripped a
three-run homer over the left
field fence to give ASU a 9-4 lead.
It looked as though Burrola's
grounder might have taken an un
expected hop on Sprague, but he
said that wasn't the problem. "It
didn't take a bad hop at all," he
said. "I just read the ball wrong
off the bat. ... I should've stayed
back and tagged the bag (for the
force-out at third), but I thought
it was a lot slower than it was —
I thought I needed to come up
on it."
Kilgo shut down the Cardinal

bats the rest of the way, recording
the win to move his record to 6-2,
and the Sun Devils added four in
the ninth to make it a rout. So
maybe Sprague's error didn't
matter that much after all; maybe
the Sun Devils were going to erupt
eventually, anyway.
Sprague doesn't think so. "Ob
viously, [the error] was the turn
ing point of the game," he said.
"We had just come back and tied
the game — we had the momen
tum. I definitely think that if I
catch the ball and make the play,
then we turn around and win the
game. .. .
"I might've cost us the Pac-10
title."
Card notes
The Sunken Diamond faithful were
entertained all weekend by a silver
haired ASU fan who belted out the
National Anthem along with the re
corded version played over the P.A.
system before every game, and who
also warbled a booming "Go, Devils,
go" cheer every other inning.
The man is Ernie Stewart, a retired
musical comedy performer from
Phoenix who was celebrating his 64th
birthday yesterday. Stewart was a
member of the Phoenix Musical
Theater company for 10 years.
He sings his "Go, Devils, go" chorus
before the Sun Devils bat in the first,
third, fifth, seventh and ninth innings
of every game and also delivers the
cheer on "third-down-and-long" situ
ations during Sun Devil football
games.
