## Arizona State rolls through and over Card Stanford's hopes of winning Six-Pac and hosting regional are slim after 13-5 loss 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Stanford's hopes
for a Six-Pac title
may have rolled
through Cardinal
third baseman Ed
Sprague's legs yes
terday afternoon.

With the score tied 4-4 in the
fifth inning and the Cardinal
having just staged a stirring come
back against the Sun Devils,
Sprague, a junior, misplayed a
two-out bases-loaded grounder off
the bat of Mike Burrola. Two runs
scored on the play, and the Sun
Devils went on to chalk up three
more unearned runs in the in
ning, breaking the game open and
going on to a 13-5 victory at
Sunken Diamond.
The win gives the Sun Devils
(45-9 overall, 16-8 in the confer
ence) an imposing two-game lead
over the second-place Cardinal
(30-16, 14-10) in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division
with six conference games left to
play. At least three teams from
the Six-Pac probably will be in
vited to NCAA postseason play,
but it's likely that only the con
ference champion will be selected
to host a regional tournament.
The Cardinal plays at San Jose
State at 2:30 p.m. today and at
Fresno State at 7 p.m. tomorrow,
then travels to Miami for a non
league series this weekend. Stan
ford returns to league action next
weekend with a series against Cal
ifornia, playing one game at
Sunken Diamond, two in Berkeley

and closes the conference season
at home against USC three weeks
from now.
Arizona State, meanwhile,
takes on the conference's fifth
place team, UCLA, in Tempe,
Ariz., this weekend, has a bye next
weekend and then closes against
cellar-dwelling Arizona in Tucson,
Ariz.
"This puts us behind the eight
ball," Sprague said. "We have to
go out and try to win six of six,
or five of six, which isn't easy
against teams like Cal and USC.
But we can only worry about our
selves. ... [ASU's] destiny is in
its own hands."
Sun Devil Coach Jim Brock,
however, isn't counting his con
ference title before it's won. "We
don't have a lock on it (the Six-Pac
title) at all," he said. "You just
have to be hoping that everybody
beats everybody else so things
stay the way they are."
If the Sun Devils continue to
hit the ball the way they did yes
terday and Sunday against the
Cardinal, any team will be hard
pressed to beat them. ASU, which
scored 15 runs on 16 hits (includ
ing four homers) on Saturday,
piled up 13 runs on 14 hits (in
cluding five doubles and two home
runs) yesterday.
"This is the best we've hit the
ball," Brock said. "Hitting is kind
of like gymnastics or diving —
there's a difficulty factor. And
going against their (Stanford's)
pitchers in their home park, the
difficulty factor is very high, so
that's by far the best we've done
this year."

The Sun Devil onslaught began
early yesterday. Pat Listach led
off the game with a single off
Stanford starter Stan Spencer, a
freshman. John Finn followed
with a double into the left-field
corner, moving Listach to third,
and Kevin Higgins brought both
runners in with a single up the
middle. With one out, Dan Rum
sey homered to right, and the
score was 4-0.
It stayed that way until the bot
tom of the fourth, when the Car
dinal, which had run itself out of
a rally in the second inning, fi
nally got to Sun Devil starter
Gordy Farmer. Sophomore Paul
Carey led off the fourth with an
opposite-field homer to left — his
fifth home run of the year — to
make the score 4-1.

Stanford senior Doug Robbins and the rest of the Cardinal nine have that rundown feeling after
losing their second straight to Arizona State.
