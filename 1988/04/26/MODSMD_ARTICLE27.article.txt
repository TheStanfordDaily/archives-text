# Crew coach Dreyfuss is Stanford's engine that can
## 
### 
Ken Dreyfuss is like the little
engine that could. A for mer Olym
pic coxswain and Navy freshman
coach, Dreyfuss was no stranger
to successful crew programs when
he came to Stanford five years
ago with the goal of putting the
fledgling varsity crew among the
nation's elite.

Since then, the route to prog
ress has been all uphill as
Dreyfuss has strived to elevate
the Cardinal to the level of the
Harvards and Washingtons of the

crew world, but he keeps telling
himself he can do it.
"The first race I ever was in at
Stanford was a two-mile race
against Berkeley, and the Cal sec
ond boat beat our varsity,"
Dreyfuss said. "In crew you can't
fool anybody. We had to start to
believe in ourselves. We can be a
good crew now. I think we've
reached the point where we go
into every race with a chance to
win."
The Cardinal proved Dreyfuss
right a few weeks ago at the Red
wood Shores-Stanford Classic
when it salvaged an otherwise dis
appointing meet by beating the
varsity eight from traditional
West Coast powerhouse Washing
ton for the first time ever in dual
competition.
Yet if the Redwood Shores meet
indicated how far the Cardinal
program has come in being able
to host and compete in a national

caliber competition, losses to
Pennsylvania and California
showed how stratified the top ech
elon of crew remains.
A strong crew program resem
bles a pyramid in that it rests on
a large base of freshmen begin
ners who eventually turn into
junior varsity oarsmen and finally
varsity boatmen. Dreyfuss has
spent the last several years put
ting the pieces of this pyramid in
place.
"What we had to do was elim
inate the disadvantages as much
as possible," he said. "When they
made the decision in 1984 to be
come a varsity sport, I could see
the things that were holding us
back from having a fair chance
in every race. You looked at the
program and there was no office.
There wasn't a focal point on
campus for the sport. That was
the first big step."
The crew coaches are now

housed in Encina Gym where they
have also added rowing machines
and a rowing tank in the court
yard. Four ergometers have been
placed in Stanford Stadium, and
the squad bought a bus for the
trip to their boathouse in Red
wood City.
Dreyfuss also added a freshman
coach and hired a boatrigger to
keep the shells in racing condi
tion. All these elements are as
basic to having a competitive crew
as blocking sleds and assistant
coaches are to a football team,
but they weren't here when
Dreyfuss arrived.
Since Stanford only provides
roughly a fifth of crew's budget,
Dreyfuss went to the alumni and
their support group, the Tiller
Club, for the necessary funds.
"For my first year and a half
here over half of my job was
thank-you notes and mailing
lists," Dreyfuss said.

Dreyfuss eventually added a di
rector of development to his staff,
and finally the basic apparatus of
a successful crew program was
largely in place. Now the athletes
are on a roughly equal footing
with their competition, but crew
still requires an enormous
amount of dedication both in and
out of the boat.
Each member of the team pays
dues of $37 a quarter, and the
oarsmen also take tickets at foot
ball games, sell crew parapherna
lia and conduct a row-a-thon to
raise funds.
That's before they even get on
the water, and there the work is
even harder. Dreyfuss estimated
that his oarsmen practice 900
minutes for every one minute of
competition. As he said of poten
tial crew members, "the people
who are looking for instant
gratification, stop."

The team is currently in the
midst of 6 a.m. workouts in prep
aration for the Big Row with Cal
ifornia this Saturday, but crew is
a year-round sport. During fall
and winter quarters the squad
practices every afternoon at 3:15,
and Dreyfuss finds that one of
his toughest tasks is effectively
using the two-and-a-half hours he
has with his crew members every
day.
"We've made an effort to
simplify what we ask of the stu
dents in terms of practice
schedules," Dreyfuss said. "We're
always making a value judgment
as to what we want to do at what
time of the year."
Dreyfuss has had to overcome
numerous obstacles in order to
build a competitive crew, and
there are numerous other hurdles
still to be conquered, but as he
said, "We've eliminated the ex
cuses."
