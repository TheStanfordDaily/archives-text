# Women's golf starts off sixth at Pac-10s
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
The Stanford
women's golf
team, hoping to
demonstrate its
ability to play with
the country's top
teams, fell short of

its goal yesterday and is in sixth
place midway through the Pacific
-10 Conference Championships at
the 6,017-yard, par-72 Sahalee
Country Club in Redmond, Wash.
The team, which shot 313-320
for a total of 633 over the 36
holes played today, is nine strokes
back of fifth-place Arizona (313-
311).
Rain and 40- to 50-degree
weather was forecast for all three
days, but yesterday was sunny,
and as the day wore on temper
atures rose into the 60s. Although
the course was still wet, limiting
distance off the tee, "the course
was in beautiful shape," according
to Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin.
Rain is not expected today but
is likely to fall on tomorrow's final
round.
Although Arizona State was ex
pected to win the tournament, no
one anticipated that the team
would run away from the field as
it has done. The Sun Devils
opened with 295 in the morning
round and exploded in the after
noon, shooting an amazing 287,
the lowest team total in any tour
nament in which the Cardinal has
played this year.
"ASU came here really mentally
and physically well-prepared,"
Baldwin said.
UCLA (303-308) is a distant
second at 611, followed by USC
at 616 (307-309) and host Wash
ington at 618 (315-303).
"Basically," said Baldwin, "we
were flat except for Kay (Cor
nelius). She managed the course
very well today."

Senior Cornelius' fourth-place
149 (72-77) was the main high
light for the Cardinal yesterday.
Cornelius is six shots behind
leader Amy Fruhwirth of ASU
(75-68) and trails Fruhwirth's
teammates Pam Wright (71-74)
and Eve-Lyne Biron (75-70) by
four.
"I had a little trouble on the
front nine on both rounds," Cor
nelius said of her performance.
She had particular trouble on
the front nine of the afternoon
round, making a double bogey and
"letting a couple of drives slip
away," she said.
Tied with Cornelius at 149 are
Pearl Sinn of ASU (74-75) and
Debbie Koyama of UCLA (74-75).
Freshman Kristin Ryan was the
second-lowest scorer for the Car
dinal, turning in a solid 81-79.
"Kristin played about as well as
she can play," Baldwin said.
"I could've done better, but I'm
happy," said Ryan. "I was worried
about whether or not I could con
centrate for that long (36 holes).
I haven't played that many holes
in a while."
Freshman Jodi Figley "lost
some concentration" and shot 163
(82-81). According to Baldwin, it
was the first reappearance of the
slice Figley had at the start of
the year. "My whole game went
down the drain for a day," said
Figley of her uncharacteristic day.
"But it'll be back tomorrow."
Sophomore Stephanie Parel
looked like she was going to break
out and provide strength at the
No. 4 position, shooting 78 on the
morning round, but fell victim to
mental fatigue and shot 85 in the
afternoon.
Although the players are some
what disappointed with their cur
rent standing, Baldwin is confi
dent that his team can rebound
and improve its standing over the
next two days. *
