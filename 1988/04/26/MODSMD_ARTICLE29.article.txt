# Sailors grab North Series
## 
### Hugh Bethell Staff writer 
When the champagne was un
corked Sunday night, everyone
on the Stanford sailing team
had a reason to celebrate.
For the team's soon
departing seniors, the occasion
was a dramatic victory at their

final North Series regatta.
For the team's still-green freshmen, there
was the equal excitement of victories over the
best sailors in California.
For everyone, the time was right to celebrate
the Cardinal's capture of the Northern Cali
fornia Series Perpetual Trophy, which Stan
ford earned by building a five-place lead over
California during nine regattas spread out over
the last three months.
From any angle, the regatta sailed on Lake
Merced this past weekend was a success for
the Cardinal, which sent 24 competitors to
the event that brought the regular sailing
season to a close. From now on, the team will
be concentrating on the regional eliminations
through which they hope to earn a berth at
the national championships, which Stanford
will host in June.
If this weekend is any indication, the Car
dinal stands a good chance of doing just that.
The team scored wins at both of the one-day
regattas hosted by the University of San Fran
cisco.
In Saturday's racing, Stanford's top boat
dominated the course and ended up with a
seven-point winning margin even after having
to accept a disappointing 30-point penalty for
starting prematurely in one of the day's races.
Sunday's racing was even more dramatic,
as trouble in the light and variable winds left
the Cardinal 13 points behind Cal as the teams
entered the final three races of the regatta.
In a stunning comeback, Stanford scored one
second- and two first-place finishes in those
races to surge ahead to a one-point victory
over their rivals
