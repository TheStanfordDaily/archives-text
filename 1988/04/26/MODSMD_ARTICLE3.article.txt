# USW pursues grievance procedure for fired technician
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Two weeks after the United Stanford
Workers officially charged Stanford with
violations of the labor contract in the
case of a mechanical engineering employ
ee, the union continues to call for the
University to resolve the conflict while
the Asian-American Students Association
has circulated a petition in support of
the worker.
The University legal counsel, mean
while, maintains that the situation will
be worked out in the course of the stand
ard grievance procedure, which could

take anywhere from six months to two
years.
The union is charging the University
with mistreating and unfairly firing Long
Quach, a Vietnamese immigrant who had
worked as a lab technician at Stanford
since March, 1987. The union filed a
formal grievance Friday, seeking Quach's
reinstatement, reimbursement for un
paid overtime work and compensation
for wages below contract standards.
Quach was fired April 12.
AASA has joined the union in its
defense of Quach, and has asked the Uni
versity to act "quickly in resolving this
matter and demonstrate its respect for

workers and for Asian people."
"We will wait to see what the Univer
sity has to say before we take any strong
action," said AASA Chair Fidelia Butt.
She added that AASA members were
seeking a meeting with employee rela
tions.
Elsa Tsutaoka, a graduate staff worker
at the AASA Activities Center, said the
petition was also distributed at a
statewide Asian student conference at
UC-Berkeley Saturday. She said AASA
may also ask other student groups on
campus to act in Quach's support.
Student action, however, has no legal
influence on the grievance procedure, ac

cording to Michael Vartain, University
staff counsel.
He said that he did not know why the
union had turned Quach's case into a
public debate, and said that if the griev
ance is not settled directly between the
University and the union, an impartial
arbitrator will be empowered to remedy
"any violation of the collective bargaining
agreement," if one is found.
The union claims that Quach should
have been treated to the benefits and
salary scale of regular employees several
months prior to his official regular ap
pointment. Vartain, however, argued that
this was unsubstantiated and not pro

vided for in the union contract.
However, even as a temporary worker,
Quach was due overtime pay at a rate
of time-and-a-half as required by Califor
nia law, Vartain said.
"If he was entitled to time-and-a-half,
and upon review by arbitration, it is
found he didn't get it, of course he will
be reimbursed," Vartain said.
Charges that Quach's supervisor mali
ciously set up Quach to be fired are false,
according to Vartain. He said he has
learned that Quach was a likeable, de
sirable employee, and thus was kept on
