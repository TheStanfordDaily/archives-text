The substance of a story in
yesterday's Daily on research
at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center was inac
curate. The article presented a
number of the goals of the proj
ect as final results. Scientists
there have conducted success
ful tests of a new linear col
lider, but have not yet isolated
the Z particle associated with
binding matter. The ac
celerator generates 20 pulses
per second, not 120. Also,
Charles Prescott, associate di

rector of SLAC research, was
misquoted as saying that the
project, which cost $115 mil
lion, was inexpensive.
An article in Friday's Daily
on the arrest of senior Jose
Fernandez said Fernandez was
arrested when he attempted to
take a computer from the Stan
ford Bookstore. Fernandez ac
tually was arrested for taking
textbooks and was spotted on
closed circuit television al
legedly stealing a computer the
week before his arrest.
