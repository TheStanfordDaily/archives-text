## New steam plant makes money

University officials last week helped dedicate Car
dinal Cogen, a steam and electricity cogeneration
plant which will save Stanford over a million dollars
a year on its energy bill and provide its commercial
operators with a tidy but controversial profit.
Located along Campus Drive, near the Medical
Center on the west side of campus, Cardinal Cogen
is the largest cogeneration facility on a California
university campus and the largest facility of its
kind anywhere on the Peninsula. Its 49.9-megawatt
capacity is as large as the California Energy Com
mission permits without special permission.
Yet this mighty plant is not operated by the
University. Cardinal Operating Personnel Inc., a
subsidiary of General Electric Co., operates the 22-
employee plant, producing steam heat, chilled water
and turbine-generated electricity for Stanford.
The commercial operator turns a profit by selling
excess electricity back to the local utility company,
according to Art Brush, the Cardinal Cogen facility
manager. Cardinal Cogen profits from the sale be
cause its electricity production is 15 percent more
efficient than that of ordinary power generators,
Brush said.
Federal law requires local utility companies to
buy excess electricity from qualified independent
producers. In Stanford's case, Cardinal Cogen will
produce almost 30 megawatts more than the entire
campus currently requires.
Here controversy surfaces. According to Stan
ford's director of facilities project management Curt
Williams, utilities are opposing cogeneration efforts
because the pricing structure between plants like
