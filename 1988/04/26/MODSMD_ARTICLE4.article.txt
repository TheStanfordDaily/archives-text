## New steam plant makes money 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
University officials last week helped dedicate Car
dinal Cogen, a steam and electricity cogeneration
plant which will save Stanford over a million dollars
a year on its energy bill and provide its commercial
operators with a tidy but controversial profit.
Located along Campus Drive, near the Medical
Center on the west side of campus, Cardinal Cogen
is the largest cogeneration facility on a California
university campus and the largest facility of its
kind anywhere on the Peninsula. Its 49.9-megawatt
capacity is as large as the California Energy Com
mission permits without special permission.
Yet this mighty plant is not operated by the
University. Cardinal Operating Personnel Inc., a
subsidiary of General Electric Co., operates the 22-
employee plant, producing steam heat, chilled water
and turbine-generated electricity for Stanford.
The commercial operator turns a profit by selling
excess electricity back to the local utility company,
according to Art Brush, the Cardinal Cogen facility
manager. Cardinal Cogen profits from the sale be
cause its electricity production is 15 percent more
efficient than that of ordinary power generators,
Brush said.
Federal law requires local utility companies to
buy excess electricity from qualified independent
producers. In Stanford's case, Cardinal Cogen will
produce almost 30 megawatts more than the entire
campus currently requires.
Here controversy surfaces. According to Stan
ford's director of facilities project management Curt
Williams, utilities are opposing cogeneration efforts
because the pricing structure between plants like
Cardinal Cogen and the utility
favors the cogeneration plant.
Stew Tartaglia, account repre
sentative for Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., said the arrangement
between Cardinal Cogen and
PG&E is revenue-neutral. But he
admitted that the plant hurts the
utility in some ways.
"We used to provide electricity
for Stanford, a large campus. The
impact of Cardinal Cogen on
PG&E is that we have lost a large
electric customer," he said. "But
we have also gained a large cus
tomer for natural gas (the fuel
which burns in Cardinal Cogen's
turbines)."
Stanford profits from the plant
through a leasing arrangement
with General Electric and Kaiser
Engineering Inc., a company that
helped build the facility. Stanford
will collect approximately $100
million in rent over the course of
the 15-year lease, in addition to
collecting a portion of the energy
profits which the plant earns,

Brush said.
Under the agreement, Stanford
purchases its energy from the
commercial operators, much as it
would under arrangements with
PG&E But the new plant will save
Stanford over $1 million per year
in energy costs, Williams said.
A cogenerational plant genera
tes energy in two ways. First, it
burns natural gas to produce
steam. That steam then serves

two functions: It is propelled
through a turbine to produce elec
tricity, and it can be used for
steam heat.
Before Cardinal Cogen began
full operation last December,
Stanford produced some of its
own power from a smaller plant
on the same site. That plant now
serves as a back-up in case of
problems at Cardinal Cogen, Wil
liams said.
