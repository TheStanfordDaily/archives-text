Deflecting claims that they
don't appreciate the signifi
cance of George Segal's Gay
Liberation statue, University
officials said yesterday that the
sculpture will be returned to
its former site on campus as
soon as construction in that
area is completed.
The statue, which depicts
two men standing together and
two women sitting side by side
on a park bench, was removed
for repair last summer after
vandals spray-painted the
acronym "AIDS" on it. The re
pairs have been completed, but
the statue cannot be returned

to its former location — in the
Lomita Mall west of the Math
Corner of the Quad — until
construction there is finished,
according to Art Prof. Albert
Elsen, a member of the Uni
versity Panel on Outdoor Art.
Members of the Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford re
cently increased efforts to
bring the statue back in time
for next week's Gay and Les
bian Awareness Week. A cen
tral event of the week will be
a rally at the former site of
the statue featuring a speech
by Cleve Jones, San Francisco
activist and director of the
Names Project, which has

by a hammer-wielding vandal four years ago, right. The statue was repaired in less
than a month after the March 1984 Incident.
