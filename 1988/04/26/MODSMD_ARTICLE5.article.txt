# 'Gay Liberation' statue will not return this quarter
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
Deflecting claims that they
don't appreciate the signifi
cance of George Segal's Gay
Liberation statue, University
officials said yesterday that the
sculpture will be returned to
its former site on campus as
soon as construction in that
area is completed.
The statue, which depicts
two men standing together and
two women sitting side by side
on a park bench, was removed
for repair last summer after
vandals spray-painted the
acronym "AIDS" on it. The re
pairs have been completed, but
the statue cannot be returned

to its former location — in the
Lomita Mall west of the Math
Corner of the Quad — until
construction there is finished,
according to Art Prof. Albert
Elsen, a member of the Uni
versity Panel on Outdoor Art.
Members of the Gay and Les
bian Alliance at Stanford re
cently increased efforts to
bring the statue back in time
for next week's Gay and Les
bian Awareness Week. A cen
tral event of the week will be
a rally at the former site of
the statue featuring a speech
by Cleve Jones, San Francisco
activist and director of the
Names Project, which has

"Gay Liberation" in its unmarred state, above, and immediately after It was smashed
by a hammer-wielding vandal four years ago, right. The statue was repaired in less
than a month after the March 1984 Incident.

created a quilt containing the
names of many acquired immune
deficiency syndrome victims.
"The rally will either be to cel
ebrate the statue's return or
protest its lack of return," said
Phil Fernandez, manager of com
puting and networking for the
medical school and a member of
the GLAS Steering Committee.
However, it is likely that the
rally will take place without the
statue, which is currently in
storage.
Philip Williams, director of Uni
versity Planning and a member
of the panel, does not see even
the temporary return of the
statue as a feasible alternative. A
piece of art that size is not easy

to move and would "involve a con
siderable expense," he said.
Williams said construction on
the Lomita Mall utility line —
which runs directly under the
statue's former location — is
scheduled to begin June 13, the
day after Commencement.
But some members of Stan
ford's gay community say that the
University doesn't understand
the importance of the statue or
its significance to the gay com
munity.
"I don't get the feeling that the
University is treating it as an im
portant issue apart from it being
a piece of outdoor art," said Daniel
Sternbergh, a graduate student
and member of GLAS. "None of
the other pieces of outdoor art
are subject to vandalism; to treat
it as just another piece of outdoor
art is to not understand the im

portanpe of it and its impact."
Williams said the University
does understand and added that
"members of GLAS don't under
stand that it's a University wide
sculpture, not just their sculp
ture."
According to Williams, the
Panel on Outdoor Art has known
about the intended construction
for two to three months. However,
the panel just informed GLAS of
the construction last week, ac
cording to sophomore Steve Sas
saman, a GLAS steering commit
tee member.
"The University has every in
tention to get [the statue] put out
as soon as it can be," Williams
said. He added that accusations
that the University is stalling for
fear of future trouble with van
dalism are unfounded.
