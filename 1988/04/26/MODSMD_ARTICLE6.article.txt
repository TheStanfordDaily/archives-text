Three Stanford students will be

of a program designed to give
graduating seniors a chance to
work in a non-profit or govern
ment agency.
Seniors Amanda Kemp, Gary
Rosen and Rudy Fuentes will each
receive $12,000 stipends next fall
in the highly competitive pro
gram, which has been a joint op
eration of Stanford and UC-
Berkeley for four years. Selection
committees at Stanford and UC-
Berkeley each choose three stu
dents annually.
Fellowship winners are selected
from a large pool of applicants,
with selections made on the basis
of academic accomplishment,
public service commitment and
leadership potential.
"The point of the fellowships is
to give them (the students) some
experience," said Catherine Mil
ton, director of the Public Service

the program, students with great
potential would encounter diffi

culty in locating "meaningful
jobs" after graduation, she said.

the Gardner Fellowship Program
at Stanford, assists new fellows
in their search for employment
opportunities.

urgent social problems concerning
urban development. He said he is
particularly interested in the cor
porate funding of projects to revi
talize public areas.
"Right now [Halleck and I havel
got feelers out more than any
thing else," said Rosen, who is
chair of Stanford in Government
and is a former Truman Scholar.
Kemp said she is still consider
ing a "whole range of possibili
ties" and was not directing her
search in any particular direction.
She said that upon completion of
the 11-month fellowship she
would like to maintain her in
volvement in politics by either
seeking elected office or assuming
an advocacy role, such as a lob
byist.
Kemp has a double msyor in
history and African and Afro-
American studies. She is a resi
dent assistant in Ujamaa House,
was the chair of the Black Student
Union during 1986-87.

foreign and domestic arenas in
