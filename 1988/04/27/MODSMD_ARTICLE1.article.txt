# Segal sculpture not yet repaired
## Photos contradict official statement 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Contrary to the University's
claims, George Segal's "Gay Lib
eration" statue — vandalized with
spray paint last summer — has
not yet been repaired, a campus
gay and lesbian group said yes
terday.
Photographs obtained by the
Stanford Organization for Les
bian and Gay Equality yesterday
show the sculpture is still
damaged. The photos — which
were taken and developed yester
day — directly contradict Univer
sity officials' statements that re
pairs had been completed and that
the statue would be returned to
its site.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, a mem
ber of the University Panel on
Outdoor Art and the overseer for
the sculpture's repair, told The
Daily Monday the repairs had
been completed.
Campus gay and lesbian ac
tivists have recently intensified

their efforts to bring the work
back to its former location near
Math Corner in time for Gay and
Lesbian Awareness Week, which
begins Monday. Activists plan to
hold a rally to celebrate the return
of the work — or to protest its
absence.
Contacted yesterday, Elsen said
he did not recall making state
ments about the statue's repair.
He had no comment on the pho
tographs.
Seven color photographs of the
sculpture, taken yesterday at 11
a.m., show that the spray-painted
acronym "AIDS" had not been
removed from one of the figures.
According to SOLGE, the photo
graphs were taken in the base
ment of the University Art
Museum, where the statue is cur
rently being stored.
SOLGE received the photos
from a photographer who asked
to remain anonymous.
