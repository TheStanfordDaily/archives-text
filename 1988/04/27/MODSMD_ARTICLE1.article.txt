# Segal sculpture not yet repaired
## Photos contradict official statement 
### Eric Young Staff writer 
Contrary to the University's
claims, George Segal's "Gay Lib
eration" statue — vandalized with
spray paint last summer — has
not yet been repaired, a campus
gay and lesbian group said yes
terday.
Photographs obtained by the
Stanford Organization for Les
bian and Gay Equality yesterday
show the sculpture is still
damaged. The photos — which
were taken and developed yester
day — directly contradict Univer
sity officials' statements that re
pairs had been completed and that
the statue would be returned to
its site.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, a mem
ber of the University Panel on
Outdoor Art and the overseer for
the sculpture's repair, told The
Daily Monday the repairs had
been completed.
Campus gay and lesbian ac
tivists have recently intensified

their efforts to bring the work
back to its former location near
Math Corner in time for Gay and
Lesbian Awareness Week, which
begins Monday. Activists plan to
hold a rally to celebrate the return
of the work — or to protest its
absence.
Contacted yesterday, Elsen said
he did not recall making state
ments about the statue's repair.
He had no comment on the pho
tographs.
Seven color photographs of the
sculpture, taken yesterday at 11
a.m., show that the spray-painted
acronym "AIDS" had not been
removed from one of the figures.
According to SOLGE, the photo
graphs were taken in the base
ment of the University Art
Museum, where the statue is cur
rently being stored.
SOLGE received the photos
from a photographer who asked
to remain anonymous.

SOLGE members Barbara Voss and Attlcus Tysen, both seniors, discuss the ramifica
tions of photographs taken yesterday morning which reveal that the Gay Liberation'
statue has still not been repaired. The photograph to the left was one of several

(Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford) doing going into storage
areas where they have no busi
ness?" Elsen asked, making the
assumption that the group was
involved. He said the location of
the statue had not previously been
disclosed in order to protect the
work from further vandalism.
However, the photographer said
no museum regulations were bro
ken when the photographs were
taken and claimed to have been
accompanied at all times by a

museum official with legal access
to the storage area.
According to Carol Osborne, as
sociate museum directer and
curator, students can only enter
the painting storage area under
special circumstances or if they
are taking an art class. It would
be impossible for someone to en
ter the area without first inform
ing an employee in the museum
office, Osborne said.
In statements issued by SOLGE
and GLAS, members of both
groups said they were left "sad
dened and angered" by what they
saw in the photographs.
"The misinformation (that the
statue had been repaired) is of

serious enough proportion that
we want a response clarifying the
situation," said sophomore Barb
Voss, a member of SOLGE and
G LAS.
Voss said the current situation
constituted "a violation of public
trust" because the University
should be responsible for protec
ting the work.
According to many SOLGE and
GLAS members, the statue — for
merly located in the Lomita Mall,
west of the Math Corner — has
personal and artistic importance
to many members of the campus
gay community.
Along with its statement,
SOLGE released a list of requests

to the University about how it
should proceed in repairing and
reinstalling the statue. While the
statue is being repaired, the group
wants updates on its progress, a
temporary marker commemorat
ing the sculpture and an appro
priate event celebrating its
return.
Last summer marked the sec
ond time vandals seriously
damaged the statue, which depicts
two men standing together and
two women sitting side by side
The work was first damaged in
March 1984 when a vandal
smashed the figures with a ham
mer, denting it in more than 40
places.
