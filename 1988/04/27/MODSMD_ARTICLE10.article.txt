U.S. to cut Kabul embassy staff
KABUL, Afghanistan — The U.S. Embassy
here is cutting in half its diplomatic mission
following intelligence reports that Iran plans
to retaliate against it for the recent U.S. at
tacks on Iranian naval ships in the Persian
Gulf, according to Western sources here.
The mission's 12-man diplomatic staff is
being reduced by six, leaving six other
diplomats and six Marine guards. Security
measures also have been taken to protect the
remaining American diplomats, some of whom
are sleeping at the embassy.
The sources said U.S. intelligence had
received information about a specific Iranian
threat to the mission.
Following the U.S. attacks April 18 on
Iranian oil facilities and warships, taken in
retaliation for Iranian mine-laying operations
in gulf waters, Tehran threatened to carry out
attacks on "U.S. interests around the world."
The first of the six diplomats left earlier
this week.
The United States maintains an embassy
here even though it does not recognize the
Soviet-backed government of President
and American diplomats here have
no contact with it.
The embassy has taken the Iranian threat
seriously both because of the kidnaping and
killing here of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs
in February 1979 and the recent emergence
in the city of an Iranian-backed, underground
urban guerrilla group, the Afghanistan Islamic
Resistance Organization, which has taken
credit for some of the recent bombings in the
capital.
Economy grows by 2.3 percent
WASHINGTON - The U.S. economy, dis
playing almost no ill effects from last October's
stock market crash, grew at a moderate 2.3
percent rate during the first three months of
1988 and laid a solid foundation for continued
expansion for the rest of this year, the De
partment of Commerce estimated yesterday.
"These numbers are uncommonly good,"
said Jerry Jasinowski, senior economist at the
National Association of Manufacturers. "The
domestic economy is substantially stronger
than expected, and there are no signs of a
recession."
On the surface, the first-quarter growth rate
in the gross national product suggested that
the economy was losing steam after its rapid
4.8 percent pace of the last three months of
1987.
But in reality, analysts said, the underlying
figures indicated that the nation's total output
of goods and services was in much better bal
ance at the beginning of 1988, propelled for
ward by a rebound in consumer spending and
business investment rather than the ac
cumulation of unsold goods that propped up
the economy at the end of 1987.
The economic news cheered Republican of
ficials, who are counting on a healthy economy
this year to help Vice President George Bush
defeat his expected Democratic rival, Massa
chusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, in the battle
to succeed President Reagan.
Reagan to push arms to Saudis
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion, buoyed by Saudi Arabia's agreement to
sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty,
vowed yesterday to wage a no-holds-barred
battle to overcome determined opposition on
Capitol Hill to a $450 million sale of military
hardware to the Persian Gulf kingdom.
The Saudi Council of Ministers voted Mon
day night to sign the treaty and to break
diplomatic relations with Iran. State-run Saudi
television said yesterday that Iranian Embassy
officials were told to leave the kingdom within
a week.
A State Department official would not com
ment on the break in relations, which he said
was "a purely Saudi matter." Nevertheless,
the decision was expected to play well in
Congress where Iran is less popular than Saudi
Arabia.
State Department spokesman Charles Red
man said that the proposed sale of ground
support equipment for Saudi radar planes was
"critical to our policy" in the gulf because the
U.S. Navy relied on intelligence relayed from
the Saudi planes. Non-government experts said
that congressional rejection of the transaction
could inflict severe damage on the Washington-
Riyadh relationship.
Nine killed by Bangladesh rebels
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Nine people were
killed and 12 injured when separatist guerrillas
burned down a Moslem settlement and shot
at fleeing villagers in the Chittagong Hill
Tracts province of southeastern Bangladesh,
police said yesterday.
Officials said the massacre occurred over
night in the village of Comillatila, about one
and one-half miles from the district town of
Khagrachari.
Police said members of the separatist tribal
army Shanti Bahini attacked the Bengali
settlement with automatic rifles and hand
grenades. Security forces in the area returned
fire and four of the attackers were injured
before they escaped in the dark.
Survivors said that about 40 guerrillas
doused the huts with kerosene and then set
them on fire. They sprayed bullets as villagers
tried to escape the blaze.
The rebels are campaigning for a separate
homeland for an estimated 500,000 Buddhist
Chakma and Marma tribesmen in the hill
province bordering Burma and the Indian state
of Tripura.
