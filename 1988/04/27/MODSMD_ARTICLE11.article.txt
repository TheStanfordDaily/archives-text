# Dukakis beats Jackson in Pennsylvania
## Landslide victory puts Massachusetts governor a step closer to nomination 
### 
PHILADELPHIA â€” Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis won a smashing
victory over the Rev. Jesse Jackson in
yesterday's Pennsylvania primary, mov
ing significantly closer to his goal of
gaining the delegate minority needed
for the Democratic presidential nomi
nation.
With 78 percent of the precincts
reporting, Dukakis had 65 percent of
the votes, compared to Jackson's 30
percent. Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who have
both suspended their campaigns,
received 3 percent and 1 percent respec
tively.
Dukakis' lead in the competition for
the Keystone State's 178 pledged
delegates to the national convention was
even greater than the more than 2-1
margin he enjoyed in the popular vottf,
a so-called beauty contest that had no
bearing on the award of the delegates.
In the delegate count, with 20 percent

of the vote counted, Dukakis was win
ning 159 delegates to 12 for Jackson in
Pennsylvania. Associated Press calcula
tions showed the governor entered yes
terday's primary with 1,075 delegates
compared to 836 for Jackson. To gain
a majority at the Democratic conven
tion, 2,081 delegates are needed.
Pennsylvania's convention delegates
were chosen on the basis of separate
elections in the state's 23 congressional
districts. Jackson was at a disadvantage
in those contests because his support
was concentrated in a few districts and
because he did not have full slates of
delegates running in most districts.
In Boston, where he had spent the
day at the Massachusetts State House
tending to his gubernatorial duties, Du
kakis called the results "a very big
boost" for his candidacy, "particularly
in a state that has been a bellwether
state in the general election. It's going
to be very helpful."

Asked if he considered his nomination
inevitable now, as many of his support
ers have begun to claim, Dukakis was
cautious, referring to Democratic nom
inee Walter Mondale's problems in
1984.
"I reminded you several times that
Fritz Mondale won New York and Penn
sylvania and then lost a string of pri
maries," he said.
The next round of contests comes
next Tuesday, in Ohio, Indiana and the
District of Columbia.
"It's not over until it's over," said
Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode,
a top Jackson supporter, when con
fronted with yesterday's results. Asked
about the possibility of Jackson drop
ping out before the June California pri
mary, Goode said: "At this point we
ought to just play out the string and
see what happens."
