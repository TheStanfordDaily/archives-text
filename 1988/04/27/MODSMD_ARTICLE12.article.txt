# Bush locks up nomination in Pennsylvania

EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Vice President Bush locked
up the Republican presidential nomination yester
day with a Pennsylvania primary victory and im
mediately turned his attention to battling the likely
Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
In an interview with The Washington Post, and
in a campaign swing across Ohio and Indiana, Bush
said he intends to fight Dukakis by recalling the
failings of Jimmy Carter, drawing sharp distinctions
on defense and foreign policy issues in particular,
and making a case that Dukakis is a "traditional
Massachusetts liberal."
With a victory last night in Pennsylvania officially
giving him enough delegates to claim the nomina
tion, Bush took time out yesterday for self
deprecating jokes about a political style that many
have described as uninspired.
"One, I think I'm a charismatic son of a gun,"
Bush said in the interview. "Secondly, I'm not going
to depend entirely on that to win." Earlier, speaking
to a group of reporters yesterday afternoon, Bush
responded to a question about his style by saying:
"What's wrong with being a boring kind of a guy?
Is that what you mean and are too polite to say

it? My wife doesn't think that. I don't know about
Mrs. Dukakis, what she thinks, Mrs. Jesse Jackson.
People aren't looking for a lot of pizazz out there.
They're looking for someone who's stable. Someone
who's had some experience, a lot of conviction, a
record of achievement, values they can identify with,
hopefully the stability and strength to lead this
country.
"So I think to kind of suddenly get my hair
colored, and dance up and down in a miniskirt or
do something — show I've got a lot of jazz out
there — drop a bunch of one-liners — we're talking
about running for president of the United States.
It's a serious business. And a lot of complexity is
involved in it. I've got a record ... let that stand
out there rather than some of these labels that
people try to attach to people. I kind of think I'm
a scintillating kind of fellow. We'll let the American
people decide that."
Bush, who has wrapped up the nomination earlier
than any non-incumbent Republican in more than
50 years, offered GOP audiences and reporters a
taste yesterday of the fall campaign he intends to
run against the Democratic nominee.
