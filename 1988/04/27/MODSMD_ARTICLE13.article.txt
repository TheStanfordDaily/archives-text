# Opposition wins big in S. Korean election
## 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea, —
South Korean President Roh
Tae Woo suffered a surprising
setback yesterday when his
ruling party failed to win an
outright majority in the Na
tional Assembly.
Roh will thus become the
first president in South Korean
history to have to govern with
out enjoying absolute control
of the legislature. Based on
nearly complete returns, the
ruling Democratic Justice
Party seems likely to win only
124 seats, while three opposi
tion parties and a handful of
independents will share the
remaining 175 seats.
The government's defeat,
despite the advantages of in
cumbency and a fractured op
position, appear to reflect
voters' continuing doubts
about Roh's promises of de
mocratization and the desire,
even among Roh supporters,
for a strong counterbalance to
his regime.
While Roh remains the un
challenged leader, he will have
to bargain and form coalitions
to pass any legislation, a
marked departure from the na
tion's tradition of author
itarian rule.
The mood was somber this
morning at the headquarters
of the party, many of whose
top leaders were defeated. The
results were so unthinkable in
Korean politics that early edi
tions of Seoul newspapers
proclaimed, inaccurately, the
expected government victory.
With 97 percent of the vote
counted, the Democratic Jus
tice Party remained the largest

single political force in the
legislature, winning 33.6 per
cent of the popular vote against
a fractured opposition. But
strong showings by Kim Dae
Jung and other opposition
leaders in their home bases,
and the ruling party's weak
performance in the capital, led
to the reversal for the govern
ment.
Roh's setback comes at the
start of a year full of challeng
es, including expected labor
strife and the Olympic Games
in September.
The 299-member National
Assembly was strengthened
and given investigative powers
under South Korea's new con
stitution, and many of its new
leaders will be former dissi
dents jailed and harassed by
past governments.
Roh, a retired army general,
was elected in December after
a year of street protests and
political upheaval. In February,
he became the first president
to take power in a peaceful
transition. He appealed to
voters this week to show faith
in his promise to gradually
democratize the government
after decades of authoritarian,
military-installed rule.
But the election results ap
peared to show an enduring
skepticism about the ruling
party among Korean voters.
Party strategists, who had
hoped for 40 percent of the
popular vote, instead won less
than Roh's 36.7 percent plu
rality in December's presiden
tial contest.
