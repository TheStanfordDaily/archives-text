# 5 die in Israeli border clash
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — In one of the most
costly In a recent series of stepped-up Arab
probes of Israel's northern border defenses,
a battalion commander and one other sol
dier from an elite Israeli army unit were
killed and two other troops wounded during
a predawn clash with guerrillas yesterday.
Three Arab infiltrators also died in a
short but fierce battle on the western slopes
of Mt. Hermon, near the point where the
Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese borders meet.
Israel Radio reported that the fighting at
one point took place at a distance of only
about 6 feet.
The death toll brought to at least 11 the
number of Israeli soldiers who have been
killed along the northern border in the last
five months. Dozens of Arabs — most of
them Palestinians — have also died in at
least 11 attempted infiltrations dating back
to Nov. 25, when a guerrilla used a hang
glider to cross the border and attack an
army base, killing six Israeli soldiers before
being shot to death himself.
Western diplomatic sources attributed
the stepped-up border activity to the desire
by Palestinians outside Israel to show sup
port for the nearly five-month-old Arab
uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
"They seem too idle doing nothing out
side when the guys are getting killed in
side," said one source who monitors activ
ities in southern Lebanon. "There are a
lot of red faces around."
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
said last weekend that 165 Palestinians
had died in the recent violence in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and 5,000 more were
in prison. Official Israeli figures showed
that about 1,300 Palestinians had been
wounded, mostly by army gunfire.
Thousands more have been hospitalized
for beating and other injuries.
One Israeli soldier and one teen-age
Jewish civilian have also been killed in the
unrest, and 450 Israeli soldiers and
civilians injured.
The Western diplomatic source said that
the rate of northern border probes had
accelerated this month, and that some in
filtration attempts had not reported by the
Israeli authorities. These probes were

militia units stationed in southern
Lebanon.
In Beirut, the Lebanese National Resis
tance Front claimed responsibility for yes
terday's infiltration, saying that it was a
joint Lebanese-Palestinian operation. How
ever, diplomatic sources were skeptical and
said it was probably a purely Palestinian
action. Mgy. Gen. Yossi Peled, Israeli troop
commander in the north, said that the
three dead guerrillas were all Palestinians.
According to an Israeli army press rep
resentative, a patrol operating inside Isra
el's self-proclaimed "security zone" in
southern Lebanon found the tracks of a
guerrilla squad in an area called Har Dov,
on the western slopes of Mt. Hermon, and
pursued the group with the aid of helicop
ters.
A Lebanese police press representative
Western sources in Lebanon said that Is
raeli air and ground forces used hundreds
of flares to light up the night sky, starting
about 3 a.m.
About 7 a.m., according to the Israeli
army account, one of its units "encountered
a terrorist squad that had hidden in our
territory in thick vegetation some 200
meters (220 yards) from the border. The
force attacked the terrorists, and in a short
battle, during which the terrorists threw
hand grenades and shot (anti-tank) mis
siles, the three terrorists were eliminated.
Also ... two IDF (Israel Defense Forces)
soldiers were killed and two others
wounded."
Israel Radio identified one of those killed
as Lt. Col. Shmuel Adiv, 29, a battalion
commander of the elite Givati Brigade.
