# Meese proposes drug tests for everyone arrested

WASHINGTON — Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111, signaling the admin
istration's increasing frustration over
its inability to solve the drug crisis by
keeping illicit narcotics out of the coun
try, yesterday proposed mandatory drug
testing for all who are arrested for any
crime.
"I would like to see the day where
every person arrested is subjected to a
urine test," Meese told the police policy
board of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
Meese later told reporters that the
testing for arrested persons "is part of
our user accountability strategy that is
being developed at the present time."
The National Drug Policy Board, an
interagency coordinating group that
Meese heads, is emphasizing "user ac
countability" in a national anti-drug
strategy it is developing for the federal
government. The board's report is ex

pected to be issued shortly.
Although someone testing positive
would not automatically be charged
with a drug offense, he could be denied
bail in the case against him or forced
to receive anti-drug treatment.
Subjecting those arrested to manda
tory drug tests would recognize that
"the user is not a victim, as some would
suggest, but rather ... is a vital par
ticipant in drug trafficking," Meese said.
The attorney general said "no" when
asked if he thought that the testing
would raise any constitutional prob
lems.
Actually, constitutional issues raised
by pretrial drug testing are currently
under review by a federal judge at the
direction of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Legal analysts have questioned
whether mandatory drug tests violate

the Fourth Amendment's prohibition
against "unreasonable" searches. But
the appeals panel noted that the court
record was "virtually barren" on the
issue of whether the tests would be a
violation.
Meese cited evidence showing the link
between drug use and crime. A study
sponsored by the National Institute of
Justice, the Department of Justice's re
search arm, employed voluntary testing
of arrested persons and produced
"amazing results," he said.
The program, conducted in 12 cities,
found that from 53 percent to 79 per
cent of men arrested for serious offenses
tested positive for illicit drugs. Under
the program more than 2,000 persons
arrested between last June and Novem
ber were given urine testa.
