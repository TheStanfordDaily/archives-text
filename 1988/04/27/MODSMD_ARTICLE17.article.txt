## Hype and hysteria 
### 
The animal rights
protesters at Stanford are
undermining their own
cause through their use of inflam
matory charges and publicity
stunts. The humane treatment of
animals is a serious issue that
deserves and receives careful at
tention at Stanford, and the animal
rights activists should refrain from
immature tactics and unfounded
allegations.
Last week, responding to charges
by members of the Palo Alto
Humane Society of a "cover-up,"
the Medical School confirmed that
it had suspended a researcher in
December for violating internal re
search protocols regarding im
proper anesthetization of a cat.
Stanford's research protocols
meet or exceed California state
standards. Research is an integral
function of a university, and re
search on animals serves an im
portant medical function.
The case was an internal matter;
it was discovered by a veterinary
nurse, reported to the proper au
thorities, and action was taken to
prevent the researcher from
repeating the infraction.
It would not be rational to expect
the Medical School to publicize
such an incident. It was handled
properly; the researcher has been
barred from experimenting on
animals until he agrees to follow
protocols and has his privileges
reinstated by the Administrative
Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.

Perhaps not coincidentally, last
week was "World Week for Labo
ratory Animals," which animal
rights activists marked with dem
onstrations on campus. Did the ac
tivists make the cover-up charge
regarding the researcher's suspen
sion in order to draw attention to
their protests?
At the demonstrations, the
animal rights advocates displayed
further irresponsibility in their
tactics. They drove hearses
through Palo Alto and carried
signs equating Stanford research
ers with Nazi criminal Josef Men
gele.
In the past the animal rights
activists have capitalized on other
unrelated issues such as the envi
ronmental impact of new buildings
connected to animal research and
health and safety violations in di
verse areas of the University. Last
week's demonstrations continued
that trend: Activists picketed the
Environmental Safety Facility in
addition to two labs where animal
research is actually carried out.
Overly broad charges and scath
ing hyperbole discredit the cause
the activists claim to be advancing:
better conditions for laboratory
animals. They should stop
stereotyping Stanford and its re
searchers as vicious animal
abusers and note that in the re
cently disclosed December case, the
internal system worked to curb
poor treatment of animals.
