## Bush-Reagan in '88 
### 
LEND ME your ears, Republicans,
because I've discovered a plan that
will win George Bush at least 49
states in the November election, a
landslide the likes of which we haven't
seen in, oh, about four years!
Democrats, you may not like this
column, so why not just turn to the
crossword puzzle right now. While you're
at it, how about a seven-letter word for
"the dullest man on Earth." Here's a
hint: He's your party's likely nominee
for president.
OK, Republicans, here's the plan: We
make Ronald Reagan George Bush's run
ning mate! Think about it! Wouldn't you
wear with pride a pin that said "Bush-
Reagan in '88"? Liberals will scream!
They think Reagan is California-bound
after he leaves office in January. Imagine
how they'll feel when they find out that
Ronnie's staying around for four (or
eight) more years! They'll be livid — we
can only hope.
(I can hear John Manley now: "Excuse
me? What kind of sick joke is this?")
What an idea. Ronald Reagan as vice
president. (Here's the campaign commer
cial: "You loved him as president, but
you couldn't elect him more than twice
to that office. So what can you as an
American do? Bush-Reagan in '88!" Fade
to black — much like the Democratic
party will!)
Liberals have been screaming about
George Bush for years now, saying that
the vice president doesn't have much to

do. We Republicans concede the argu
ment, and all the better for Reagan! He
won't want to do much, right? For God's
sake, the guy's 77 years old. He shouldn't
be overburdened, now should he?
Here's what Reagan can do, though.
Like all vice presidents, he can travel to
funerals. What fun! At his age, you can
be sure he'll be attending quite a few
anyway (for all the Hollywood fossils),
so why not a few more? At these and
other functions, Ron and Nancy can stay
in the public eye, mingle and chat with
other foreign leaders and otherwise rep
resent the United States well — what a
vice president!
As vice president, Reagan can also
preside over the Senate — when he wants,
to! Stanford students of course know that
the vice president breaks ties in the Sen
ate, and imagine how Reagan would
relish that!
Here's a senario: "Mr. Reagan, it's 50
big-spending, knee-jerk liberal senators
in favor of the huge appropriations bill,
50 fiscally responsible, morally sound
conservatives against it. Please break the
tie." Reagan will step up to the podium,
look at Ted Kennedy with disdain and
like the great Julius Caesar, give the
dramatic "thumbs down" sign. Victory
for the conservatives! Reagan does it
again. Liberals you can't escape him!
ThatV the whole point of a Bush-
Reagan ticket: Victory for the conserva
tives and a continuing voice for Ronald
Reagan.

Some will quibble with my advice, say
ing that no man near 80 years of age
should be "a heartbeat away" from the
presidency. Yet, let's think of a tragic
hypothetical: Bush, the president, dies.
Who is the most reassuring person you
know, and who could step in and assume
power while calming the country at the
same time? Ronald Reagan. He's the ideal
vice president, simply put.
No, I take that back. Ronald Reagan
is the ideal president. With that in mind,
here's the best senario of all: The Bush-
Reagan ticket wins (that's a given), and
Bush immediately resigns from office.
Guess who's president for the next four
years?
The 22nd Amendment to the Consti
tution says, "No person shall be elected
to the office of president more than
twice." Well, pardon me, but we elected
Reagan vice president this time. What
22nd Amendment?
If you're a Reagan fan, I hope I've
made your day. If not, take a deep breath
and repeat after me: "Four more years!"
