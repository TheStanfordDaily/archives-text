# Kennedy tackles issues
## Defends Hoover, animal research and CIV 
### Brent Bigler 
Responding to a renewed movement
among faculty members to sever ties
with the Hoover Institution, University
President Donald Kennedy expressed his
hope in a KZSU interview last night
that Stanford will continue to maintain
close relations with the controversial
conservative think tank.
"There's much more to be gained from
maintaining a relationship between
Hoover and the rest of Stanford than
there is from considering any kind of
severance," Kennedy said. He added that
most faculty members and Hoover
scholars believe that the two should con
tinue their relationship.
Political Science Prof. John Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz have
circulated a petition in the Faculty Sen
ate to discontinue all ties with Hoover.
Appearing on the show "Campus Con
ference," Kennedy expressed his views
on a number of other controversial is
sues, including animal rights, his West

ern culture debate last week with U.S.
Secretary of Education William Bennett
and University tenure policy.
Kennedy spoke out against recent ac
tivities by the animal rights activists â€”
activities that he said undermined med
ical research efforts at Stanford. Last
week, members of the Palo Alto Humane
Society marched on campus, charging
that Stanford researchers were treating
animals inhumanely.
"The animal rights movement, aug
mented by other concerns, really has
succeeded in deferring [the construction
of University research facilities]," Ken
nedy said. "That disturbs us" because
of lost time in research, he said.
Kennedy said he was puzzled by a
request of the College Republicans that
he apologize for remarks he made last
Wednesday on a televised debate be
tween him and Bennett. On the Mac-
Neil/Lehrer News Hour, Kennedy had
said that Bennett's supporters at an
April 18 Stanford appearance
were more vocal than the secre
tary's detractors because the Col
lege Republicans had fostered an
advantageous political climate at
the speech.
"They've not made it exactly
clear what it is I'm to apologize

for," Kennedy said. "I said some
thing that I thought was quite
obvious; namely that when you
have a political gathering under
political auspices, and a man who
holds political office (Bennett),
some (of the audience) will be on
his side."
When asked whether the Uni
versity unduly emphasizes re
search over teaching in making

tenure decisions, Kennedy said
that over the past 12 years Stan
ford's policy has "been character
ized by increased weight on teach
ing and the evaluation of teach
ing.
But Kennedy expressed hope
that the tenure appointment proc
ess will improve, as the University
strives to identify teaching excel
lence.
