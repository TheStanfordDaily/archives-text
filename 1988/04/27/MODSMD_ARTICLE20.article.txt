## Political activism is appropriate in ASSU Senate 
### 
I WISH to expand upon ASSU
Senate Chair David Smolen's
criticism of Leslie Kaufman's April
19 column, "An apolitical ASSU." Not
only was the column inaccurate but
extremely damaging to student em
powerment on this campus.
Kaufman suggests that the ASSU
Senate should give up political agendas
and, like the famed powerless ostrich,
just bury its nose in bureaucratic
paperwork. Frankly, the prospect that
such an opinion might be taken
seriously both shocked and disap
pointed me. Why should students risk
losing any influence on Stanford policy
by utterly ignoring their one poten
tially powerful, collective voice?
From my experience, the senate as a
whole has always genuinely sought to
represent student interests. Mistakes
are, unfortunately, a part of democra

cy. However, politicians must also stop
to critically evaluate whether the
convictions or whims of a majority
truly represent wise policy.
If the populace (in this instance
students) still contends the judgement
of its representatives, it always wields
several weapons of recourse — includ
ing the right to vote. Such politically
aware organizations as the Black Stu
dent Union, Students United for a
Democratic Education and MEChA
have long understood this fact and
have fought for positive reform in this
university.
I find it ludicrous to suggest that
the legislative body for 12,000 mem
bers of a powerful, prominent and
influential institution should be any
thing but political. Students at UC-
Berkeley run a highly political student
senate. Their subsequent activism

often leads to successful lobbying for
legitimate student interests and rights.
At Stanford, if we students vote with
concern for legitimate issues and take
our legislators more seriously, we can
produce a genuine and valid represen
tative body that will give the ASSU
the cohesiveness its name implies.
As long as we consider our senate,
and consequently ourselves, a minor
force on campus, we will never get and
never deserve lighted tennis courts,
versatile I.D. cards and the numerous
other amenities previous senate candi
dates have promised. Students should
disdain the lack of progress past
senators may have made on any cam
paign promises. Only by forcefully
expresssing this disdain and justifing
grievances will future senate candidates
get the message that their constituen
cies expect results, or else. . ..

If we students can come to grips
with our own potential power on this
campus, we will necessarily vindicate a
senatorial political agenda.
I realize that many students do vote
only to get their fee refunds, but in
the future I hope these same students
seriously consider who really reaps the
rewards from such political apathy. We
pay too much for this Stanford experi
ence to passively let campus policy
happen to us.
Student activism must be political
activism. Let us cease to regard ASSU
politics as a farce of self
aggrandizement but regard it as a
necessary affirmation of student em
powerment and self-determination on
this campus!
