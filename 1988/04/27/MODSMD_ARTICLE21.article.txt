# Bennett's mind is closed to debate
## 
### 
U.S. Secretary of Education William
Bennett has revealed himself to be an
ideologue. After hearing his speech on
April 18 and seeing him on the
McNeil/Lehrer News Hour April 19, I
am convinced that the only mind that
has closed is his. I am shocked and
disturbed that an educated, intelligent
(though I may be wrong on this point)
and influential person should refuse to
engage in open-minded debate; in his
mind he is right, and there is no other
valid position.
Secretary Bennett believes that the
new Culture, Ideas and Values track
completely eliminates study of Western
culture. This is made clear in his falla
cious analogy of Western culture to
English and "non-Western" culture to
French or other foreign languages; he

says that Stanford has stopped teach
ing English (Western culture) to teach
French ("non-Western" culture). This
is untrue, for CIV remains a study of
Western culture and retains large por
tions of the old track.
The study of American culture is not
the study of a single, uniform heritage.
In terms of Bennett's language anal
ogy, American culture is more like a
patois that, though based on English,
is dependent upon phrases from di
verse sources such as Japanese and
Hindi. For Bennett to say that the
study of English will suffice and will
also show the influence, for instance,
French had on it, is to ignore and
denigrate the substantial influence
from "non-Western" sources.
The attempts to generate change on
the issues surrounding the teaching of
Western culture have been labeled by
Bennett as "anti-West" with the strong
implication of being anti-American or

unpartriotic. This type of innuendo is
far from productive and overlooks the
fact that most of the people involved
in the efforts to get the University to
change are interested in a true demo
cratic eductaion, one that does not
exclude important contributions by
non-whites or non-males.
The acts Bennett claims are in
timidatory are actually efforts to keep
people aware of the issues; these issues
have been raised before and then for
gotten by the University administra
tion. Without student activism, they
might quickly and conveniently (for the
administration) be forgotten again.
In closing, I would like to point out
that the opinions held by Bennett are
indicative of the whole problem of "in
stitutional racism." Bennett is not a
bigot; indeed, I am sure that he would
argue that he judges people only on
their merit.
Unfortunately, he is de facto racist

by his insistence that in the study of
Western culture, there is no room for
any of the other cultures that are a
part of our modern society. He has
stated unequivocally that Western cul
ture is the greatest and most signifi
cant one; to him, the inclusion of
study of anything else detracts from it,
i.e., is not significant. He argues that
it is important that students "know
thyself," in a cultural context, but
what he is urging is selective knowl
edge; minorities and women are
usually referred to as "non-Western,"
implying that they are not a part of
our cultural gestalt.
Bennett is wrong. But he will never
doubt that he is right, and that all
other opinions are mistaken. What
Bennett has called "the closing of the
Stanford mind" is actually the closing,
locking and boarding-up of his own
mind.
