## Pledging non-allegiance to SDI Stanford researchers square off on SDI funding 
### Kelly Brown 
In an attempt to limit congres
sional funding for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, nearly 200
Stanford researchers have signed
a pledge refusing to accept SDI
funds for their work.
Claiming that the SDI program
is "ill-conceived and dangerous,"
the pledge has been signed by
more than 7,000 university re
searchers, including 77 Stanford
graduate students and 119 faculty
members and researchers.
The pledge first began circulat
ing in 1985 at Cornell University
and the University of Illinois. It
reached Stanford last spring
through the efforts of Stanford
Action for Nuclear Disarmament,
STAND, a group consisting
mainly of University students
working for arms control through
education, lobbying and demon
strations.
According to Stanford graduate
Scott Bohning, a member of
STAND who brought the pledge
to the attention of Stanford re
searchers, pledge supporters hope
to "raise awareness of the moral
implications of accepting SDI
funds." They want to make a na
tional statement to Congress that
many University members do not
accept the aims or the methods
of the Star Wars program, Boh
ning said.
According to Bohning, SDI
"makes war more likely" because
it could be used to back an Amer
ican first strike against the Soviet
Union. He said SDI could never
completely dependable for defend
ing the Ajnerica population from
a Soviet first strike because the
effects would be devastating if
even a few warheads reached
American soil.

Claiming that SDI has greatly
improved the U.S. arms-control
negotiating stance with the Soviet
Union, Electrical Engineering
Prof. Thomas Kailath opposes the
pledge.
Kailath, who is currently
researching SDI-related topics,
said that although the current
program is flawed, the INF treaty
and current START negotiations
may be direct or indirect results
of Reagan's pro-SDI position.
However, Kailath said the SDI
program President Reagan sup
ports "could not be effective and
is too expensive." According to
Kailath, the system supported by
Reagan is unworkable because it
is designed to destroy missiles in
the initial boost phase, which lasts
about 90 seconds. Kailath said he
believes that a system designed
to destroy missiles in their post
boost phase could be useful, and
that current research is diverting
resources that could be given to
more practical programs, he said.
Aeronautics Prof. Dean Chap
man, who currently accepts funds
for basic SDI research, said that
SDI is "a very important element
of the defense of this country."
The pledge to stop accepting SDI
funds is "for the birds," according
to Chapmen, who said it is far
too early to judge the technical
feasibility of SDI.
But according to Bohning, even
SDI programs designed to destroy
missiles in their post-boost phase
are "possibly dangerous."
According to STAND figures,
the nearly $28 million in SDI con
tracts awarded to Stanford is used
to help develop computer target
ing software that would control
space weaponry, optical comput
ing hardware and electronics.
Of the $28 million, about $18

million is spent on research for
the free electron laser, an instru
ment considered to be the corner
stone of the SDI program that
was invented at Stanford, accord
ing to STAND.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
John Madey, the laser's inventor,
said he is unsure about the po
litical and philosophical implica
tions of SDI. But Madey went on
to call the present situation of
mutually assured destruction in
the event of a nuclear war "clearly
unacceptable" as a system of
defense.
He pointed out that in an en
vironment where nations have not
been able to control the number
and disposition of nuclear weap
ons, SDI could prove to be very
useful, if not necessary, in pre
venting mishap.
Madey cited a study by Electri
cal Engineering Prof. Martin
Hellman which claims that an ac
cidental launch will occur within
100 years. Madey compared the
current strategic nuclear system
to a "glorified washing machine"
that is bound to have problems.
"We can't afford not to do SDI,"
he said, adding that if used wisely,
SDI could be the cornerstone to
significant reductions of nuclear
forces.
Despite his support for SDI,
Madey said he respects his col
leagues who signed the pledge not
to accept SDI funds and "wel
comes political and philosophical
debate as a vital part of our coun
try."
But Madey said "it would be
bad" if Stanford accepted the
pledge as University policy.
Unlike Madey, Prof. Richard
Pantell, who is also conducting

work on the free electron laser,
said the pledge "is a good idea"
that he would sign if he were not
an electrical engineer.
According to Pantell, his re
search began before SDI was
developed and "cannot object" if
his work is now classified under
SDI research and is supported by
SDI funds.
The SDI program is "not such
a good idea" because offensive
counter-measures are more real
istic and economically feasible
than SDI, Pantell said, adding
that SDI "is not a good idea in
terms of defense of this country."
Pantell emphasized that he is
familiar only with a small portion
of the program. He said he agrees
with the pledge's statement that
SDI was "ill-conceived," but dis
agreed with the claim that the
program is "dangerous."
But one prominent pledge sup
porter, Statistics Prof. Charles
Stein, explained that he signed
the pledge because he opposes
"anything that builds the danger
ous arms race."
Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd, also stands in full sup
port of the pledge and has collec
ted signatures for it."The partic
ipation of the University and in
dustry is being used as a political
means of funding it," Winograd
said.
According to Winograd, "creat
ing a body of people who stand
to make a lot of money ... creates
a constituency out there for [SDI],
regardless of whether it's a good
idea or not."
Calling for "public pressure to
. . . put your money where your
mouth is," Winograd said "it is a
matter of personal responsibility"
to limit SDI funding.

The pledge first began circulat
ing in 1985 at Cornell University
and the University of Illinois. It
reached Stanford last spring
through the efforts of Stanford
Action for Nuclear Disarmament,
STAND, a group consisting
mainly of University students
working for arms control through
education, lobbying and demon
strations.
According to Stanford graduate
Scott Bohning, a member of
STAND who brought the pledge
to the attention of Stanford re
searchers, pledge supporters hope
to "raise awareness of the moral
implications of accepting SDI
funds." They want to make a na
tional statement to Congress that
many University members do not
accept the aims or the methods
of the Star Wars program, Boh
ning said.
According to Bohning, SDI
"makes war more likely" because
it could be used to back an Amer
ican first strike against the Soviet
Union. He said SDI could never
completely dependable for defend
ing the Ajnerica population from
a Soviet first strike because the
effects would be devastating if
even a few warheads reached
American soil.

Claiming that SDI has greatly
improved the U.S. arms-control
negotiating stance with the Soviet
Union, Electrical Engineering
Prof. Thomas Kailath opposes the
pledge.
Kailath, who is currently
researching SDI-related topics,
said that although the current
program is flawed, the INF treaty
and current START negotiations
may be direct or indirect results
of Reagan's pro-SDI position.
However, Kailath said the SDI
program President Reagan sup
ports "could not be effective and
is too expensive." According to
Kailath, the system supported by
Reagan is unworkable because it
is designed to destroy missiles in
the initial boost phase, which lasts
about 90 seconds. Kailath said he
believes that a system designed
to destroy missiles in their post
boost phase could be useful, and
that current research is diverting
resources that could be given to
more practical programs, he said.
Aeronautics Prof. Dean Chap
man, who currently accepts funds
for basic SDI research, said that
SDI is "a very important element
of the defense of this country."
The pledge to stop accepting SDI
funds is "for the birds," according
to Chapmen, who said it is far
too early to judge the technical
feasibility of SDI.
But according to Bohning, even
SDI programs designed to destroy
missiles in their post-boost phase
are "possibly dangerous."
According to STAND figures,
the nearly $28 million in SDI con
tracts awarded to Stanford is used
to help develop computer target
ing software that would control
space weaponry, optical comput
ing hardware and electronics.
Of the $28 million, about $18

million is spent on research for
the free electron laser, an instru
ment considered to be the corner
stone of the SDI program that
was invented at Stanford, accord
ing to STAND.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
John Madey, the laser's inventor,
said he is unsure about the po
litical and philosophical implica
tions of SDI. But Madey went on
to call the present situation of
mutually assured destruction in
the event of a nuclear war "clearly
unacceptable" as a system of
defense.
He pointed out that in an en
vironment where nations have not
been able to control the number
and disposition of nuclear weap
ons, SDI could prove to be very
useful, if not necessary, in pre
venting mishap.
Madey cited a study by Electri
cal Engineering Prof. Martin
Hellman which claims that an ac
cidental launch will occur within
100 years. Madey compared the
current strategic nuclear system
to a "glorified washing machine"
that is bound to have problems.
"We can't afford not to do SDI,"
he said, adding that if used wisely,
SDI could be the cornerstone to
significant reductions of nuclear
forces.
Despite his support for SDI,
Madey said he respects his col
leagues who signed the pledge not
to accept SDI funds and "wel
comes political and philosophical
debate as a vital part of our coun
try."
But Madey said "it would be
bad" if Stanford accepted the
pledge as University policy.
Unlike Madey, Prof. Richard
Pantell, who is also conducting

work on the free electron laser,
said the pledge "is a good idea"
that he would sign if he were not
an electrical engineer.
According to Pantell, his re
search began before SDI was
developed and "cannot object" if
his work is now classified under
SDI research and is supported by
SDI funds.
The SDI program is "not such
a good idea" because offensive
counter-measures are more real
istic and economically feasible
than SDI, Pantell said, adding
that SDI "is not a good idea in
terms of defense of this country."
Pantell emphasized that he is
familiar only with a small portion
of the program. He said he agrees
with the pledge's statement that
SDI was "ill-conceived," but dis
agreed with the claim that the
program is "dangerous."
But one prominent pledge sup
porter, Statistics Prof. Charles
Stein, explained that he signed
the pledge because he opposes
"anything that builds the danger
ous arms race."
Computer Science Prof. Terry
Winograd, also stands in full sup
port of the pledge and has collec
ted signatures for it."The partic
ipation of the University and in
dustry is being used as a political
means of funding it," Winograd
said.
According to Winograd, "creat
ing a body of people who stand
to make a lot of money ... creates
a constituency out there for [SDI],
regardless of whether it's a good
idea or not."
Calling for "public pressure to
. . . put your money where your
mouth is," Winograd said "it is a
matter of personal responsibility"
to limit SDI funding.

In an attempt to limit congres
sional funding for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, nearly 200
Stanford researchers have signed
a pledge refusing to accept SDI
funds for their work.
Claiming that the SDI program
is "ill-conceived and dangerous,"
the pledge has been signed by
more than 7,000 university re
searchers, including 77 Stanford
graduate students and 119 faculty
members and researchers.
The pledge first began circulat
ing in 1985 at Cornell University
and the University of Illinois. It
reached Stanford last spring
through the efforts of Stanford
