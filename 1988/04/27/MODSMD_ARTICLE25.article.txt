Mia's Spring Quarter Splurge:
With the sun finally making an appearance,
my warm-weather craving for ice cream also
surfaces. My choice for this luscious indulgence
is definitely Haagen Dazs — the ice cream
purist's delight. Perhaps too conveniently lo
cated at the Stanford Barn, a coffee ice cream
bar hand-dipped in dark chocolate should cure
you (and me!) of those urges. And peanut
vanilla couldn't hurt either. . . .
Can't Rain on My Parade:
Despite scattered showers and omnipresent
dampness, Rincadelt '88 could not be stopped.
Sure, Frost was a little soggy and yes, the
party started a little late, but the amazing
reggae music of the Babylon Warriors more
than made up for the less than ideal conditions.
Good job, Rinconada!
Final Countdown:
Senior Class President Liz Marks can't be
lieve there are only three Pub Nights left.
With graduation festivities just around the
corner (well, almost) why not participate in
some early celebrating? This week, Senior Pub
Night is Thursday at the always popular Stan
ford Pub.
Manzanita Comes Alive:
I just talked to trailer resident Dan
Schroeder, the coordinator of this year's
"Splendor in the Grass." The annual all-day,
outdoor extravaganza May 7 will be quite an
event, promises Dan.
In addition to our own LSJUMB and the
new Dollies, Almighty Isis, A Little Night
Music, Square Roots, Composition 3 and the
"specially formed" Manzanita Jazz Quartet
will be in action. A Chinese brewery will be
serving its own Baiyun Beer for those over
21, while the rest of us can settle for com
plimentary soft drinks. Sounds like a perfect
chance to grab a spot on the lawn and revel!
