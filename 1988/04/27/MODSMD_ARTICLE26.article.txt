## Morrissey can't save boring 'Hate' 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Morrissey — "Viva Hate"
Without a doubt, Morrissey
belongs in the Lyricist Hall of
Fame that has yet to be erected
but definitely should.
First with the leading depresso
rock group The Smiths, Morrissey
penned some of the most fatally
honest fatalistic tunes to ever
reach vinyl, including classics like
"What Difference Does It Make,"
"How Soon Is Now" and "Please
Please Let Me Get What I Want,"
plus decent smash hits like
"Girlfriend in a Coma" and "Un
happy Birthday."
Just how negative can this man
be? Well, the closing cut on his
solo debut, "Viva Hate," is
benignly titled "Margaret On The

Guillotine" about British Prime
Minister Thatcher's secret hobby
of impersonating Marie An
toinette. . . . Not really, but Mr.
Morrissey isn't much kinder.
If that is not enough, consider
The Smiths' classic "William It
Was Really Nothing," where he
laughs at the institution of mar
riage when he taunts, "How can
you stay with a fat girl who'll say/
'Would you like to marry me/ and
if you like you can buy the ring'/
She doesn't care about anything."
So much for the music history
and the glory of the past. Un
fortunately, without the services
of his former songwriting partner,
The Smiths' melody maker and
lead guitarist Johnny Marr (who,
incidentally, has since hooked up
with The Pretenders), Morrissey's
potent poetry is tragically diluted
by the insufferably dull and

repetitive music of album pro
ducer Stephen Street.
Now, The Smiths were not
noted for great variety in their
music; almost all of the group's
songs shared the same basic struc
ture and sound. However, at least
a listener could sit through an
entire album and at least walk
away satisfied.
Morrissey's solo venture does
not afford this luxury. With the
exception of the singles "Suede
head" and "Hairdresser On Fire"
— where, for some strange rea
son, Street made a creative depar
ture and actually wrote non
somnolent melodies — "Viva
Hate" is possibly the single most
boring album of the year.
"I don't mind if you forget me,"
Morrissey's song of that title
proclaims. Thanks kindly for the
privilege.
