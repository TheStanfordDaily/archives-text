Great things happen beneath the
Coca-Cola sign on Stockton and Broad
way. At Yuet Lee. Chinese cuisine is
raised to a refreshing — yet still in
expensive — standard of excellence.
And for those who thought seafood
and Chinese restaurants were
mutually exclusive, think again: Yuet
Lee is considered by many to serve
the best seafood in the city.
Yuet Lee (externally distinguishable
by the lime-green paint job) appears
at first glance like any other fast
moving, brightly lit Chinese restau
rant. The menu, however, is anything
but standard: seven pages so crammed
with exotica that beef and broccoli
sound boring in comparison. A large
percentage of diners at Yuet Lee are
Asian, so you know the kitchen is
doing something right.
A prime starting choice might be

the chefs special noodles, which are
tossed with delicately sliced carrots
and zucchini. The corn soup with
green onions could constitute a meal
in itself. For a main dish, we recently
enjoyed the ever-popular chicken with
cashews, served with bamboo shoots,
mushrooms, green onions and fresh
cilantro. The chicken in black bean
sauce is another tasty and excellently -
prepared selection.
But it is truly the seafood that sets
Yuet Lee apart. To attest to its fresh
ness, you can take the table next to
the fishtank. And for those who order
lobster, the chef will display the snap
ping beast before dumping it into the
kitchen pot. Makes you think twice, I
admit, but if you're going to eat it,
you might as well meet it.

Another excellent appetizer is the
kanji, a rice soup subtly sweetened
with fresh chicken and abalone. And
even better than the above mentioned
chicken in black bean sauce are the
clams in said bean sauce, again sauteed
with fresh green onions. The Kung
Pao prawns are enormous, served with
kale in a ginger sauce and sauteed to
an unmatchable crispness.
The menu offers so many tempting
options that I have yet to eat the same
thing twice — except for the squid,
the salt-and-pepper roast squid: This
is surely what Yuet Lee does best.
Large chunks of adult squid, and curly
tentacles of the little ones, are fried
to a deliciouBness so unrubbery it vir
tually melts on the tongue. Those of
fended by the mere mention of

calamari will be rendered speechless.
The wait-staff at Yuet Lee is very
efficient, even pushy — an admirable
trait in the eyes of those waiting in
the frequently long lines for a table.
The crowd at the second Yuet Lee ,
on 26th and Valencia in the Mission
district, is equally unpredictable. The
menu is of equal high quality, how
ever, and you can sit next to the fish
tank there, too.
The allure of Yuet Lee is further
enhanced by its reasonable prices. Ap
petizers run $2 to $4, standard entrees
$4 to $6, and seafood dishes are
usually a buck or two extra. A massive
dinner for two (except beer, which is
BYO) easily runs under $20.
Yuet Lee is a dining experience not
to be missed. True, to take advantage
of the best of the menu you have to
be slightly adventurous. You might not
have to go so far as to eat those in
famous black eggs, but even the most
standard dishes are better than what
most restaurants have to offer in the
way of Asian food. Indeed, those squid
are worth a trip for themselves. I hear
them waving for me now . . .
