# Senate may override COP veto
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
In response to the Council of Presi
dents' rejection of the nomination of
junior Rachel Wiesen for ASSU director
of public affairs, many ASSU senators
and officials yesterday questioned the
COP's justification for the action and
predicted that the senate will override
the veto at tonight's meeting.
Two-thirds of the 20-member senate,
or 14 votes, are needed to override a
veto, and senate insiders estimate that
only a few senators support the COP's
move. The most optimistic estimate had
only six votes in the council's favor.
In fact, the veto was put on even
shakier ground yesterday when one
COP member, junior Roechelle Smith,
revealed yesterday that she was never
contacted by the other three COP mem
bers about the veto and said she does
not support their action.
Despite not being in the COP office
the past week because of an illness,
Smith said, "Not one member of the
COP took the time to call me for my
opinion." She said she did not know

about the veto until yesterday after
noon.
Because she also was not informed
of any specific reasons cited for a veto,
she said the action was "extremely ri
diculous" and a "game of dirty politick
ing."
According to ASSU bylaws, only three
of four COP members are needed to
sign a veto into effect, so Smith's ob
jections will technically not block the
veto.
The veto, which was submitted Friday
afternoon, reopened debate over the
nomination, which had apparently been
decided at last Tuesday's senate meet
ing. After two months of a controversial
selection process that included charges
of racial bias and three entirely different
interview processes, the senate decided
to nominate and confirm Wiesen as di
rector of public affairs.
Reasons for the veto remained murky
yesterday. Debate centered around
whether references on Wiesen's appli
cation needed to be checked.
It remains unclear who would be ap
pointed if the veto is sustained.
Wiesen said she is "not particularly

worried" about the veto, which she said
is just a sign that the COP is "cleaning
out the desk of all possible tricks" to
prevent her from taking the position.
"Basically it sounds like they're on
shaky ground," she said.
COP member Leonard Adler, who
said that questions about the references
were one reason why the nomination
is being held up, was roundly criticized
by several ASSU senators and officials
for holding up the process.
Adler said the COP did not want the
nomination to be approved "until ref
erences (on Wiesen's application) are
checked," which was the official reason
stated on the veto form. But Adler
balked when asked to justify checking
references at such a late date, saying
the COP's reasons will remain confiden
tial until the references are investigated.
Wiesen, though, said she has never
been asked to submit recommendations.
"I asked earlier during the selection
process if they wanted recommenda
tions, and they said no," she said.
In addition to the primary rationale
