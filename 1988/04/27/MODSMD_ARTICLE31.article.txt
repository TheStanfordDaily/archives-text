## Looks like L.A.

Start dusting off Jack Nich
olson's courtside seat. Order an
extra case of cigars for Red
Auerbach. It's gonna be the
Lakers and Celtics in the NBA
Championship series again.

Sure, there are the nay
sayers. The Lakers, they say,
who normally put their run
ning game into overdrive right
before the playoffs, played only
.500 ball over the final 20
games of the season. And the
Celtics have no bench and are
becoming a one-man show.
For these and other reasons,
several expert analysts and
commentators have already
proclaimed that the Los
Angeles-Boston grip on the
NBA Championship trophy is
over.
Well, the grip is definitely
weaker than it has been in past
years, but the Lakers and Cel
tics will hold on for at least
another year to meet in their
annual June rendezvous.
Prior to discussing the
Lakers and Celtics, and which
will be the king of the moun
tain this year, let me run down
their main competitors and ex
plain why Los Angeles and Bos
ton will run them over.
First, in the Western Con
ference, the Denver Nuggets
should supposedly be the
Lakers' greatest concern. They
had the second-best conference
record and they finished the
season on a tear, including a
victory over the Lakers in the
Forum at the end of March.
Yet, if the two teams meet
in the conference final, Los An
geles will have the advantage
in one all-important area: self
confidence. Last year when the
Nuggets and Lakers played in
the first round of the playoffs,
Denver Coach Doug Moe
proclaimed in all seriousness
before the series that his team
didn't belong on the same court
as the Lakers. He was right.
This year, the Nuggets are
significantly better and Moe is
not so gloomy in when assess
ing his team. Still, he says the

Lakers cannot be beaten if
Magic Johnson is healthy. Is
Moe right? It almost doesn't
matter. A more pertinent ques
tion would be: Is he creating
a self-fulfilling prophecy? He
certainly is not breeding con
fidence in his players. Chalk
one up for the Lakers.
Portland is the only other
Western Conference team that
I see as a threat to Los Angeles.
The Lakers should be afraid of
the Blazers (they split the
season series), but they don't
seem too concerned. In fact,
Los Angeles Coach Pat Riley
said he would rather play
Portland than Utah (the
Blazers' first round opponent)
in the second round. Riley is
worried about the size of the
Jazz and the thin air in Utah.
In all likelihood, the Lakers
will face Portland, a team
loaded with unheralded talent.
Everybody knows Clyde Drex
ler (that doesn't mean they can
stop him) and Kiki Van
deweghe, but center Kevin
Duckworth, forward Jerome
Kersey and guard Terry Porter
aren't exactly household
names.
Duckworth, who has re
placed the injured Steve
Johnson for much of the
season, may be the most im
proved player in the NBA this
season. Kersey is a fabulous
athlete and, when hot, a
scoring machine. And Porter is
one of the better point guards
in the game.
Still, the Blazers have been
an extremely inconsistent team
this season, and this should
prove fatal in a seven-game se
ries with the defending cham
pions. Look for Portland to
dazzle the Lakers once or twice
but fall in five or six games.
Over in the Eastern Confer
ence, the Celtics will have to
conquer the traditional
bangers (did I hear someone
say Bill Laimbeer?) but should,
in the end, have an easier path
to the final than the Lakers.
Most people looking for the
Laker-Celtic dynasty to
crumble this year expect
Detroit to sip the Dom Perig
non this time around. The Pis
tons seem to have more good
players than they can use, but
they haven't proven that they
can come up with clutch
performances in big games.
Last year, Detroit was better
