Coming off back
to-back defeats at
the hands of the
Arizona State Sun
Devils, losses that
virtually elimi
nated any chance

Stanford had of winning the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division title, the Card nine
headed south to San Jose yester
day just looking for a win.
They got one.
Led by strong pitching perform
ances from sophomore Robbie
Kamerschen, who upped his
record to 5-0, and senior Lee
Plemel, a fixture in the starting
rotation who picked up his first
save of the season, the Cardinal
outdistanced the Spartans by a
score of 7-3.
"It was a big win for us,"
Kamerschen said. He noted that
after the debacle against ASU it
was important for the team to
bounce back and get some mo
mentum heading into the
postseason.
The Cardinal got started early
when sophomore Troy Paulsen
walked with one out in the first.
Junior Ron Witmeyer followed
with a single. Then junior Ed
Sprague walked to load the bases.
Sophomore Paul Carey didn't fol
low with one of his patented grand
slams — instead he struck out.

But senior Doug Robbins singled,
scoring Paulsen and Witmeyer,
and the Cardinal led 2-0.
Stanford added a run in the
third and Paulsen again started
the rally. Paulsen singled and ex
tended his hitting streak to 26
games. Witmeyer hit into a force
play but then stole second. With
two outs Carey singled and Wit
meyer scored increasing the lead
to 3-0.
Both team's bats went silent
until the seventh when freshman
Mike Eicher singled and went to
third on a single by sophomore
Eric Cox. He scored what turned
out to be the decisive run on a
sacrifice fly by junior Frank
Carey.
The run was necessary because
the Spartans came to life in the
bottom of the seventh. After
cruising through six scoreless in
nings, Kamerschen "hit the wall"
as he put it. The Spartans' Brad
Monhinweg drove in the first run
with a single.
Pinch hitter Jon Rattazzi fol
lowed with a Texas-league double
that scored two and San Jose
State had pulled within one —
and there was still only one out.
That was all for Kamerschen,
who had given up but five hits in
his six and one-third innings of
work. Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess brought in Plemel from
the pen to put out the fire.
And, when Plemel struck out
Steve Anderson, it seemed he was

up to the task. But the Spartans
weren't through quite yet.
Palo Alto native Andy Coan
reversed a Plemel pitch into right
field. Darin Davis, who was pinch
running for Rattazzi, rounded
third and headed for home with
the tying run. Meanwhile, Paul
Carey fielded the ball and threw
a strike to Robbins — Davis was
a dead duck and the Cardinal still
led 4-3.
The Cardinal got some insur
ance in the eighth when Witmeyer
doubled and Sprague homered to
increase the cushion to three. The
home run was Sprague's 15th and
tied him for the Six-Pac lead with
ASU's Tim Spehr.
Stanford added one more for
good measure in the ninth. Cox
singled and Marquess sent in
junior Jack Hollis to run for him.
Junior Eric DeGraw followed with
a single. Then Frank Carey
sacrificed both runners over set
ting up Paulsen's sacrifice fly. The
Cardinal led 7-3.
Plemel was never threatened by
SJSU in the late innings. He al
lowed but two hits after replacing
Kamerschen. The win was the sec
ond for Stanford over the Spar
tans this year, and upped the Car
dinal's record to 31-16. Spartan
pitcher A 1 Bacosa took the loss
and San Jose State fell to to 26-28
on the year.

Coming off back
to-back defeats at
the hands of the
Arizona State Sun
Devils, losses that
virtually elimi
nated any chance

Stanford had of winning the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division title, the Card nine
headed south to San Jose yester
day just looking for a win.
They got one.
Led by strong pitching perform
ances from sophomore Robbie
Kamerschen, who upped his
record to 5-0, and senior Lee
Plemel, a fixture in the starting
rotation who picked up his first
save of the season, the Cardinal
outdistanced the Spartans by a
score of 7-3.
"It was a big win for us,"
Kamerschen said. He noted that
after the debacle against ASU it
was important for the team to
bounce back and get some mo
mentum heading into the
postseason.
The Cardinal got started early
when sophomore Troy Paulsen
walked with one out in the first.
Junior Ron Witmeyer followed
with a single. Then junior Ed
Sprague walked to load the bases.
Sophomore Paul Carey didn't fol
low with one of his patented grand
slams — instead he struck out.

But senior Doug Robbins singled,
scoring Paulsen and Witmeyer,
and the Cardinal led 2-0.
Stanford added a run in the
third and Paulsen again started
the rally. Paulsen singled and ex
tended his hitting streak to 26
games. Witmeyer hit into a force
play but then stole second. With
two outs Carey singled and Wit
meyer scored increasing the lead
to 3-0.
Both team's bats went silent
until the seventh when freshman
Mike Eicher singled and went to
third on a single by sophomore
Eric Cox. He scored what turned
out to be the decisive run on a
sacrifice fly by junior Frank
Carey.
The run was necessary because
the Spartans came to life in the
bottom of the seventh. After
cruising through six scoreless in
nings, Kamerschen "hit the wall"
as he put it. The Spartans' Brad
Monhinweg drove in the first run
with a single.
Pinch hitter Jon Rattazzi fol
lowed with a Texas-league double
that scored two and San Jose
State had pulled within one —
and there was still only one out.
That was all for Kamerschen,
who had given up but five hits in
his six and one-third innings of
work. Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess brought in Plemel from
the pen to put out the fire.
And, when Plemel struck out
Steve Anderson, it seemed he was

up to the task. But the Spartans
weren't through quite yet.
Palo Alto native Andy Coan
reversed a Plemel pitch into right
field. Darin Davis, who was pinch
running for Rattazzi, rounded
third and headed for home with
the tying run. Meanwhile, Paul
Carey fielded the ball and threw
a strike to Robbins — Davis was
a dead duck and the Cardinal still
led 4-3.
The Cardinal got some insur
ance in the eighth when Witmeyer
doubled and Sprague homered to
increase the cushion to three. The
home run was Sprague's 15th and
tied him for the Six-Pac lead with
ASU's Tim Spehr.
Stanford added one more for
good measure in the ninth. Cox
singled and Marquess sent in
junior Jack Hollis to run for him.
Junior Eric DeGraw followed with
a single. Then Frank Carey
sacrificed both runners over set
ting up Paulsen's sacrifice fly. The
Cardinal led 7-3.
Plemel was never threatened by
SJSU in the late innings. He al
lowed but two hits after replacing
Kamerschen. The win was the sec
ond for Stanford over the Spar
tans this year, and upped the Car
dinal's record to 31-16. Spartan
pitcher A 1 Bacosa took the loss
and San Jose State fell to to 26-28
on the year.
