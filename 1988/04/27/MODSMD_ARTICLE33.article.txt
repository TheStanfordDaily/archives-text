# Stanford's sights set on Gulls
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Almost one year
ago to the day,
Eleni Rossides
returned to the
singles lineup fol
lowing a year-long
absence as the

Stanford women's tennis team
hosted U.S. International Univer
sity in its last home dual match
of the season. A couple of weeks
later, the Cardinal, with its lineup
bolstered, went on to win the
NCAA team championship.
The scenario will not be the
same this year. The Cardinal may
well win the national champion
ship, but Rossides will not be in
the lineup today when USIU visits
the Stanford Tennis Stadium at
1:30 p.m. for the Cardinal's final
home dual match.
Last year, stress fractures kept
Rossides out of the lineup until
the end of April. This season, a
peculiar groin injury suffered dur
ing the first week of February has
sidelined the Cardinal junior for
the entire dual-match season.
At first, Rossides' injury was
diagnosed as a muscle pull that
would not take too long to heal.
Since that time, however, Ros
sides has learned that the liga
ments and tendons in the groin
area have been injured.
The Cardinal star was off to
her best start in her three years
at Stanford, winning the Women's
Intercollegiate Invitational in
January and finishing second at
the Rolex National Indoor Inter
collegiate Championships in Feb
ruary. But she suffered the injury
at the Rolex tournament and has
been unable to play without pain
ever since.
"I tell people each week it's only
going to be another week, but I've
been saying that for five weeks
now," Rossides said yesterday.
Without Rossides, Stanford will
be the second-favorite behind
Florida at the NCAA champion
ships, which commence in Los An
geles in two weeks. With a healthy
Rossides, the Cardinal would still

be the No. 2 seed, but would prob
ably be considered the favorite.
Stanford should easily win its
first two matches at the nationals,
and would probably beat USC in
the semifinals even without Ros
sides. The Cardinal has already
beaten the Trojans twice this
season, clinching the match both
times in singles.
Top-ranked Florida, however,
beat Stanford earlier in the
season. The match was close (5-4),
and Rossides might be just what
the Cardinal needs to upend the
Gators.
Rossides said she will not play
until her groin is pain-free. "If I
tried to start moving (now), I'd
risk an injury that could keep me
out six months to a year," she
said. "I'm not going to play in
the team (championships) unless
I'm fine."
Does she think the pain will
subside in the next two weeks?
"As far as nationals, I have no
idea, to be honest with you," Ros
sides said.
On the positive side, Rossides
said she believes she will be com
petitive if she is able to play. "I
hit for a half-hour yesterday
(Monday). I was pretty excited,"
she said. "My strokes feel fine.
Everything feels fine."
Rossides estimated that she
would need only a few days of
practice to be able to play No. 6
for the Cardinal in Los Angeles.
With a week to 10 days of practice,
she said she could move up higher
in the lineup.
After hitting Monday, Rossides
did not feel any worse yesterday
morning. "It doesn't feel that
bad," she said. "It's still sore. I
don't think it got worse. It's a
good sign."
So Rossides and her teammates
can only wait to see if the pain
in her groin will go away. Al
though the injury has lasted far
longer than she had expected,
Rossides has been given reason
to be optimistic.
"The guys (doctors) who I trust
really think I'll be able to play,"
she said.

Card notes
USIU comes to Stanford with a 12-
13 record and a No. 23 national
ranking. The Gulls have been plum
meting recently, dropping their last
four dual matches. The Cardinal is
21-2 and ranked No. 2.
Freshman Tami Whltlinger won't
be competing today. Stanford's No. 1

singles player is still recovering from
* pulled groin muscle, an ir\jury suf
fered at last weekend's Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships.
Senior Cari Ha gey will return to
both the singles and doubles line-ups
for the Cardinal. Hagey injured her
shoulder April 7 against Cal and has
not played since.



Lisa Romerein â€” Daily file
Unlike last year, U.S. International University will not have to worry
about facing junior Elenl Rossides in its dual match at Stanford.
Rossides is still recovering from a groin injury and is hoping to
return to action in time for next month's NCAA Championships.
