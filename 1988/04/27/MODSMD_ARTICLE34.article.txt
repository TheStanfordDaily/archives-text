### Win Reis Staff writer 
Despite im
proved rounds
by four of its
five players, the
Stanford wom
en's golf team
failed to im-

prove on its sixth-place stand
ing heading into today's final
round of the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships at the
Sahalee Country Club in Red
mond, Wash.
The Cardinal women shot a
total of 314 for a three-round
total of 947, 11 strokes behind
fifth-place Arizona, which shot
312 yesterday.
"Everyone else played bet
ter," said senior Kay Cornelius,
whose uncharacteristic 82 was
the team's highest score. "I
didn't putt very well at all."
Cornelius, who is usually the
team's low scorer each round,
is feeling a return of the same
sickness that sidelined her two
months ago in Tucson, Ariz.
She said she felt that Monday's
36 holes tired her out for yes
terday, causing some mental
errors. "It (36 holes) wouldn't
normally tire me out," she said.
"But I think [Monday] wiped
me as far as being sick goes."
Cornelius' three-day total is
231, which places her in 11th
place. "If I don't break top 10,
I'll be upset," she said. "I just
wasted some shots today."
On a more positive note, all
four other players improved on
their Monday rounds.
Freshman Jodi Figley
brought her total to 241 yes
terday, after shooting a 78.
Freshman Kristin Ryan con
tinues to provide a needed solid
performance at the No. 3 spot,
shooting 78 yesterday for a
total of 238. Her round was a
bit erratic: She was even-par
after seven holes, but then
went 7-over-par on the next six
and played the final five holes

in 1-under-par.
"I just started having some
negative thoughts," said Ryan
of her mid-round slump. "I
couldn't really think positively
about golf, so I thought about
other positive things in my
life."
"Overall, I played pretty well
today," she added. "I was
swinging and hitting smoothly,
but I didn't putt very well."
Meanwhile, sophomore
Stephanie Parel put together a
solid 77, bringing her three-day
total to 240. It was Parel's sec
ond sub-80 round in as many
days.
In addition, freshman Mi
chele Lyford shot an 81 yes
terday, bringing her three
round total to 252.
The story of the team stand
ings is the race for third place.
Arizona State, which shot 297
yesterday to total 879 over
three rounds, leads UCLA by
an insurmountable 41 strokes.
The Bruins shot 309 and at
920 lead third-place USC by 12
strokes.
Tied with the Trojans is
Washington, which shot 314.
Arizona is only another four
strokes back, having shot 312
Tuesday for a total of 936. Any
one of these three teams could
take over third place with a
strong performance today.
