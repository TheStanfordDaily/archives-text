# SCIR abstains from voting on S. Africa 'disengagement' efforts
## 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
A University Board of Trustees
subcommittee Monday abstained
from voting on resolutions requir
ing four U.S. companies in Stan
ford's stock portfolio to sever all
economic ties with South Africa.
After discussing in a telephone
conference the shareholder
resolutions affecting Merck, Gen
eral Electric, Westinghouse and
Whirlpool, the Special Committee
on Investment Responsibility
found that its decision not to vote
on the resolutions to disengage
from South Africa "raised a ques
tion of policy," SCIR chair Ted

Mitchell said.
Distinct from divestment or dis
investment, disengagement from
South Africa involves severing all
business links with the nation,
including licensing and contract
ing arrangements with locally
owned companies.
While the SCIR operates under
policies of selective disinvestment
and selective divestment, it does
not yet have a policy on disen
gagement.
Recently, members of the SCIR
and the University's Commission
on Investment Responsibility
have debated whether to recom
mend that companies which pro
vide exceptional services — such

as General Electric, which owns
NBC news and sponsors the net
work's coverage of events there
— should disengage from South
rica
The SCIR and the CIR "need
to find where to draw the line
about when we think complete
disengagement is appropriate for
shareholders to demand from the
company," Mitchell said.
In deciding whether to support
shareholder resolutions this
spring, the SCIR has strongly en
couraged corporations that do not
actively combat apartheid to dis
invest, or withdraw their direct
investments.
However, Mitchell said the
Westinghouse, Whirlpool and GE
cases did not fall under the SCIR's
disinvestment policy.
Westinghouse and GE had al
ready disinvested from South
Africa, and Whirlpool had never
made direct investments in the

country.
Nevertheless, the three com
panies sell their products in South
Africa through locally owned dis
tributors.
Although the CIR recom
mended the SCIR abstain from
voting only on the GE resolution,
the SCIR decided not to vote on
all three resolutions calling for
total disengagement because the
trustees lacked information on
the companies' efforts to combat
apartheid.

In the case of Merck, the SCIR
followed the ClR's recommenda
tion that Merck should not sever
all economic ties. Both groups
agreed that because Merck pro
vides South Africa "unique, life
saving drugs," the company's con
tinued presence there is justified.
However, the SCIR said it
remains unclear "what sales of
what products should be permit
ted under Stanford's policies on
a [corporation's] sales to South
Africa."

The University owns shares in
GE, Merck, Westinghouse and
Whirlpool valued at $5.5 million,
$3.6 million, $4.6 million and $2
million, respectively.
Mitchell said he hopes the SCIR
and CIR will establish a written
policy pointing out the "standards
and expectations" for corporate
disengagement from South Africa
in their meeting next month, so
that the SCIR can apply the policy
to other disengagement resolu
tions this year.
