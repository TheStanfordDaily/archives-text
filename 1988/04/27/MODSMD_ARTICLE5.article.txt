# Professors awarded Guggenheim grants

Seven Stanford scholars from a
wide variety of fields will have a
chance to put teaching on the
back burner and concentrate on
research with the aid of the pres
tigious Guggenheim Fellowships.
This year's fellowships, which
were awarded in early April, will
support projects ranging from
composing a piano concerto to im
plementing knowledge-based sys
tems in computer science.
The 1988 Stanford recipients
are Ross Bauer, lecturer in music;
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Robert Dutton; Business Prof.
David Kreps; English Prof.
Dianne Middlebrook; Computer
Science Prof. Jeffrey Ullman;
Laura Volkerding, senior lecturer
in photography; Assoc. Classics
Prof. John Winkler and Patricia
Parker, a visiting professor of
English and comparative litera
ture from the University of
Toronto.
The Guggenheim Foundation,

a philanthropic organization
based in New York, distributes
over $6 million in fellowships
among 262 scholars in the United
States and Canada. Recipients of
the prestigious award were selec
ted from a field of 3,265 applicants
on the basis of "unusually distin
guished achievement in the past
and exceptional promise for fu
ture accomplishment."
The amount of financial sup
port that the fellowships provide
varies depending on the cost of
the research being pursued by
each recipient.
Bauer, who called the award "a
great honor," plans to take a
break from teaching music com
position theory to write a piano
concerto.
Volkerding said she was pleased
because "every creative person
longs for the chance to devote full
time to their own personal re
search." She will be in Europe
most of next year, continuing her
photography of workshops in
France, and teaching at the Stan
ford campus in Tours next Winter
Quarter.
Kreps said he will use his fel
lowship to study how the litera
ture of economics deals with the
absence of rational decision
makers from the area of standard
micro-economic theory.
Ullman will continue his study
of efficient implementation of

relational database systems,
which he said "are hampered by
a limited language." His main re
search goal will be to develop al
gorithms that allow computer
users "to ask questions of the
computer in a richer language."
Dutton will teach a course next
year in integrated circuit design
at the Stanford campus in Kyoto,
Japan, while focusing his research
on how impurities move into
semi-conductors.
Winkler plans to compile an edi
tion of nearly two dozen recently
discovered papyrus fragments of
ancient Greek novels with trans
lation and commentary.
