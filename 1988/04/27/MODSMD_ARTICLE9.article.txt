# Soviet students dispel myths
## Panel discusses misconceptions about Soviet life 
### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
The "Russian Dream" is
nearly identical to the "Ameri
can Dream," a group of visiting
Soviet students said last night
at an all-campus forum.
"I want a wife, healthy child,
nice house and a good job," So
viet student Andrei Chibiriaev
told a crowd of about 200 at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The forum, hosted by the
Stanford-Soviet Exchange Proj
ect, was designed to dispel some
common U.S. stereotypes about
the Soviet Union.
Seventeen students — 12
Soviets and five from Stanford
who visited the Soviet Union
last month — participated in

the discussion and answered
questions from the audience.
The Soviet students are
spending one week on the Farm
after hosting the Stanford stu
dents at their school,
Novosibirsk University in
Siberia.
Education Prof. Martin Hel
lman, whose book "Break
throughs" addresses U.S.-Soviet
relations in the nuclear age,
moderated the event.
Following a slide show depict
ing the similarities of U.S. and
Soviet daily life, Hellman spoke
about the importance of improv
ing the superpower relationship.
"We the people want to bie
friends," he said. "I don't know
why our governments have such
a problem with it."

After Hellman's introduction,
the students answered ques
tions from the audience. An in
terpreter translated the queries
for the Soviet students.
Among the first questions was
whether Soviet views of the
United States had changed, par
ticularly since the U.S.-Soviet
summit last December.
Twenty-three-year-old Sasha
Ikonnikov's answer surprised
the audience. "We never had an
enemy view of this country," he
said. "Even when 1 was in the
army, there was no animosity
felt toward America."
Stanford senior John Pollack
agreed. During his visit, the So
viet people were "positive and

receptive, and, for the most part,
very honest," he said.
The Soviet members of the
panel also discussed their impres
sions of the United States. Asked
if his stay at Stanford had altered
his image of America, 21-year-old
Roman Borisov said that although
he often heard stories of extreme
poverty and wealth here, he found
neither.
"I feel very comfortable here,"
he said, adding that he was "sur

prised no one has tried to commit
a crime against me."
However, the Soviet students
did discuss some areas in which
the two countries are different.
Equality between the sexes, for
example, is less evident in the
Soviet Union than here, said 23-
year-old Elana Sazonova.
"A woman in the Soviet Union
exists in a slightly suppressed
state," said Sazonova, one of two
Soviet women on the panel. She
said most Soviet women get
married before their education is
completed and spend a large por
tion of their time taking care of
their families.
