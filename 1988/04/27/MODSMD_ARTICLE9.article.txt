## Panel discusses misconceptions about Soviet life 
### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
The "Russian Dream" is
nearly identical to the "Ameri

Soviet students said last night
at an all-campus forum.
"I want a wife, healthy child,

Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

summit last December.
Twenty-three-year-old Sasha
Ikonnikov's answer surprised
