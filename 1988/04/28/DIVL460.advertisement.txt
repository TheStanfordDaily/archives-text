On Campus Interviews: Thursday, May 5,1988
• Career Opportunity • State-Of-The-Art Technology
• Small Company Environment • Excellent Growth Potential
• Creativity Required • Chance to Make a Difference
COMDISCO RESOURCES has developed a pioneering SPW product which will be used to
design a broad range of DSP systems for application in communications, robotic control, digital
audio, automotive design and defense electronics. First product was introduced into the
marketplace last June and was ranked among the BEST OF 1987 DESIGN SOFTWARE products
by Electronic Design magazine. Project started by two recent Stanford Ph.D. graduates.
Positions Available: All require UNIX and C experience. Sun, Apollo, VAS and PC experience desirable.
• DSP Engineer - For applications development. MSEE or higher. Two years experience
desired.
• Engineer - For instrumentation applications development. BSEE or higher. Familiarity
with basic test instruments and GPIB desired.
