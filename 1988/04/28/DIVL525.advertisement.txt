5,826,000
people hunger
for Mingfs Villa.
Because Hong Kong has lost
its three best Chinese chefs to
Ming's Villa.
Which means a lot of
people are craving the food
Ming's Villa is serving.
Over 150 dinner entrees of
the best regional cuisines,
including a succulent suckling
pig from our barbeque
pit. And 50 kinds of
Dim Sum
for weekday lunch. But that's
not all. There are over 100
different varieties during
weekends.
And Hong Kong is going
without.
But you don't have to.
Come in and try our new
dinner or lunch and see why
so many people are
yearning f or
Ming's Villa.
