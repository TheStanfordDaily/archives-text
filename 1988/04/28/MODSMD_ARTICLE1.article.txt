### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Senior Hoover Fellow Edward Teller last night
brushed off charges levied in a March Congressional
report that he misrepresented the effectiveness of
a significant component of the Strategic Defence
Initiative to high-level Reagan Administration offi
cials.
Controversy over Teller's reports to government
officials — including President Reagan himself —
arose last fall when charges of exaggeration made
by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
physicist Roy Woodruff were leaked to the Southern
California Federation of Scientists.
The misleading information may have cemented
the Reagan administration's financial and ideolog

important in defense in ways that I cannot tell
you. .. . And it would be highly dangerous to forget
about it."
In the program presented by the International
Relations Society to a large audience in Eucalypto
house, Teller, a consultant to Livermore, said at
the time he presented information on the X-ray
laser to administration officials, Woodruff had
"agreed in writing" with Teller's assessment of X
ray laser research.
According to Teller, Woodruff, the former head
of X-ray laser development at Livermore, made
"even stronger claims" for the research than he
did. However, Woodruff grew "disenchanted and
dissatisfied" with the progress of the research and
raised "irresponsible claims" against Teller's repre
sentation, Teller said. Woodruff resigned in 1985
as a result of the controversy.
The GAO report found Teller and another Liver
more physicist misled the government by giving
"the impression that the nuclear-pumped laser was
