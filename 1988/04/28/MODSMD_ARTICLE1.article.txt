# Teller denies SDI deception
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Senior Hoover Fellow Edward Teller last night
brushed off charges levied in a March Congressional
report that he misrepresented the effectiveness of
a significant component of the Strategic Defence
Initiative to high-level Reagan Administration offi
cials.
Controversy over Teller's reports to government
officials — including President Reagan himself —
arose last fall when charges of exaggeration made
by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
physicist Roy Woodruff were leaked to the Southern
California Federation of Scientists.
The misleading information may have cemented
the Reagan administration's financial and ideolog
ical commitment to SDI, according to Rep. George
Brown, D-Riverside. Brown initiated a General Ac
counting Office investigation last winter that de
termined Teller did mislead the government.
In a statement that surprised many members of
the audience, Teller said he has changed his pre
dictions for the future of strategic defense, seeing
the X-ray laser playing a less crucial role.
"Maybe I have been wrong," he said, but added
"I still think the X-ray laser will be extremely
important in defense in ways that I cannot tell
you. .. . And it would be highly dangerous to forget
about it."
In the program presented by the International
Relations Society to a large audience in Eucalypto
house, Teller, a consultant to Livermore, said at
the time he presented information on the X-ray
laser to administration officials, Woodruff had
"agreed in writing" with Teller's assessment of X
ray laser research.
According to Teller, Woodruff, the former head
of X-ray laser development at Livermore, made
"even stronger claims" for the research than he
did. However, Woodruff grew "disenchanted and
dissatisfied" with the progress of the research and
raised "irresponsible claims" against Teller's repre
sentation, Teller said. Woodruff resigned in 1985
as a result of the controversy.
The GAO report found Teller and another Liver
more physicist misled the government by giving
"the impression that the nuclear-pumped laser was
on schedule for near-term deploy
ment."
However, Teller last night said
he had claimed the laser was "a
big scientific discovery that might
or might not be used in defense."
Teller urged caution in lauding
the recent treaty on intermediate
range nuclear missies and arms
control agreements in general. He
emphasized that a strong strate
gic defense combined with arms
control is the only way to really
reduce the risk of war.
"No treaty can ever be com
pletely enforced," he said, and no
defense will ever be completely
"leak-proof."
Teller suggested that maintain
ing SDI would encourage future
arms agreements. Although So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has
said he would not sign any treaties
while we continued SDI, "We have
not stopped SDI, and Gorbachev
has signed more agreements than
any of his predecessors," he said.
Endorsing strategic defense,
Teller said he did not foresee an
end to the arms race. He defined
the purpose of defense, not to
"make war impossible" but to
make war less rewarding for the
aggressor.
"The arms race brings about

technological developments which
have favorable as well as unfa
vorable consequences."
Teller called for the early
deployment of strategic defense,
in order to solve questions that
"nobody knows the answers to
now," although the early system
would be "obviously insufficient."
Nonetheless, he predicted an ini

tial deployment could take place
within 10 years and voiced confi
dence in a developing technology
called the kinetic kill vehicle
which could be ready in five to
10 years.
He voiced concern for the need
of bipartisan support of SDI. "Un
less we find a solution to which
the great msgority will agree, then

the Soviets will succeed in playing
a divisive role" in the United
States.
Teller said he "dislikes" a cur
rent requirement for SDI, that all
systems must not be entirely
computer-run. Instead, he en
dorses systems that operate inde
pendently of human actions, but
are accessible to intervention.
