## Greenpeace calls itself a 'professional pest' 
### John Griffin Staff writer 
Greenpeace campaigns of non-violent
direct action are, "a system of being a
professional pest," said Amy Halloran,
a speaker from the group's regional of
fice in San Francisco.
Speaking to about 40 people in the
geology building last night, Halloran ex
plained that in the last few years Green
peace has added a more mainstream ap
proach to its direct action by lobbying
for environmental protection laws.
She added that the lobbying arouses
mixed feelings among members, who
recognize the potential benefits of new
laws but fear that lobbying might dull
Greenpeace's edge. "We're getting to be
kind of corporate in structure," Halloran
said.
However, Halloran stressed that the
organization still maintains its practice
of direct physical intervention when it
perceives a potential harm to the envi
ronment.
As the Greenpeace structure has
grown, so have its financial resources.

A 1986 CBS 60 Minutes story reported
a Greenpeace budget of $14 million, paid
for almost exclusively by small personal
donations.
Media coverage has always been a key
part of Greenpeace's success, Halloran
said. "We're media hounds," she admit
ted, calling public pressure on elected
officials an important force for change.
Halloran also commented on her no
tion of the term "civil disobedience."
"Some activists want to call it civil
obedience, because you're obeying your
conscience."
Green peace is perhaps best known for
the Rainbow Warrior incident, which
also involved the French government.
An international court awarded $8.1 mil
lion in damages to Greenpeace for the
1985 bombing of its flagship by two
French agents. One man was killed when
the ship exploded in a New Zealand
harbor.
The 60 Minutes story shown by Hal
loran stood as testament to the group's
success.
Greenpeace actions helped
reduce the number of commer
cially killed whales from 30,000
in 1975 to 7,000 in 1986, accord
ing to the program. It also noted
that Western European nations
no longer dump radioactive waste,
in part because of Greenpeace
pressure.
The program cited the group's
influence in stopping atmospheric
nuclear testing by the French gov
ernment as another of its suc
cesses.
Greenpeace was founded 17
years ago by a few Sierra Club
members who were dissatisfied
because of what they saw as that
group's reluctance to actively in
tervene in practices they consid
ered environmentally harmful.
Halloran said that although
Greenpeace has no religious af
filiation, a strong moral commit
ment is fundamental for many
members.
