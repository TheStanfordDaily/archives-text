## Greenpeace calls itself a 'professional pest' 
### John Griffin Staff writer 
Greenpeace campaigns of non-violent
direct action are, "a system of being a
professional pest," said Amy Halloran,
a speaker from the group's regional of
fice in San Francisco.
Speaking to about 40 people in the
geology building last night, Halloran ex
plained that in the last few years Green
peace has added a more mainstream ap
proach to its direct action by lobbying
for environmental protection laws.
She added that the lobbying arouses
mixed feelings among members, who
recognize the potential benefits of new
laws but fear that lobbying might dull
Greenpeace's edge. "We're getting to be
kind of corporate in structure," Halloran
said.
However, Halloran stressed that the
organization still maintains its practice
of direct physical intervention when it
perceives a potential harm to the envi
ronment.
As the Greenpeace structure has
grown, so have its financial resources.

A 1986 CBS 60 Minutes story reported
a Greenpeace budget of $14 million, paid
for almost exclusively by small personal
donations.
Media coverage has always been a key
part of Greenpeace's success, Halloran
said. "We're media hounds," she admit
ted, calling public pressure on elected
officials an important force for change.
Halloran also commented on her no
tion of the term "civil disobedience."
"Some activists want to call it civil
obedience, because you're obeying your
conscience."
Green peace is perhaps best known for
the Rainbow Warrior incident, which
also involved the French government.
An international court awarded $8.1 mil
lion in damages to Greenpeace for the
1985 bombing of its flagship by two
French agents. One man was killed when
the ship exploded in a New Zealand
harbor.
The 60 Minutes story shown by Hal
loran stood as testament to the group's
success.
