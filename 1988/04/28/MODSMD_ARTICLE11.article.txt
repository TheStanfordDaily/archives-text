## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
In an effort to better ac
quaint talented high school
students with collegiate aca
demic opportunities, national
and state experts will come to
Stanford this weekend to dis
cuss current research on the
education of gifted students.
The purpose of the confer
ence, which will be held April
29 and 30, is to provide "a
closer link between secondary
and post-secondary education"
for the students and to keep
researchers in gifted education
up to date on current findings,
according to conference host
David Fetterman, professor of
education.
In addition, Stanford faculty
members will introduce the
high school students to a gen
eral overview of current re
search and work done in fields
ranging from physics to dance.
"The needs of gifted kids are
often neglected in regular
schools," Fetterman said. The
conference will help them

decide "what things they find
fascinating" and what work
they might find at research
universities, Fetterman said.
The conference "will help
students ... think about their
options for their university
years," said Dean of Humani
ties and Sciences Norman Wes
sels, who will give a speech dur
ing the event.
"This is not by any means a
recruitment effort for Stan
ford," Wessels said.
Fetterman hopes the confer
ence will "bring gifted educa
tion back to Stanford." Ever
since the Terman Study on
gifted research was completed
here over 50 years ago here,
the study of gifted education
has been neglected at Stanford,
he said.
Along with a presentation on
brain research, topics of dis
cussion will center on recent
research in teaching gifted stu
dents and will also offer sug
gestions on what needs to be
done to improve instruction of
precocious students.
