Baker pushing to oust Meese
WASHINGTON — Although Vice President
George Bush and White House chief of staff
Howard Baker Jr. have publicly positioned
themselves above the controversy over Attor
ney General Edwin Meese 111, their aides have
privately been deeply involved in efforts to
force him from office.

Advisers to both officials
have told Republican support
ers in Congress that the em
battled attorney general, by
remaining in office, was
weakening the Reagan
presidency and could jeopar
dize Bush's campaign for the
Oval Office.
In fact, Baker himself
presided over a heretofore un-

disclosed meeting a month ago at which his
advisers discussed two subjects: how to get
rid of Meese and how to force strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega out of Panama.
"The consensus at the meeting," a Baker
adviser told the Los Angeles Times, "was that
Meese was a political liability and something
ought to be done about him. It was strongly
felt that he was jeopardizing the perception
of the quality of justice at the Justice Depart
ment and was creating more problems on the
Hill (Congress) than was generally recog
nized."
North's immunity almost hurt
WASHINGTON — Independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh testified yesterday that a Jus
tice Department official had attempted to pro
vide his office with details from former Na
tional Security Council aide Oliver North's
immunity-protected congressional testimony
that Walsh's investigators were not supposed
to hear.
Walsh said that Judith Hetherton, an asso
ciate counsel on his staff, had to use "forceful"
language to cut off the official, identified later
yesterday as Assistant Attorney General
William Bradford Reynolds, after "he started
to convey information" from testimony North
gave last summer to the House and Senate
Iran-contra committees on condition it never
be used against him in a criminal case.
The identity of the Justice Department of
ficial was not disclosed during yesterday's
daylong pre-trial hearing before U.S. District
Court Judjfe" Gerhard Gesell on the Iran-
Contra conspiracy indictment of Marine Lt.
Col. North and three others, but Reynolds
confirmed through a Justice Department
spokesman that it was he.
"She (Hetherton) stopped him," Walsh said
under questioning by Brendan Sullivan Jr.,
North's attorney. "She really had to be ener
getic to get him to stop," said Walsh, who
testified that he had learned of the incident
from others.
Three nations may lose U.S. aid
WASHINGTON — In an expression of frus
tration over the unabated flow of cocaine into
this country from Latin America, the House
Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday sought
to cut off about $30 million in U.S. aid to
Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru on the grounds
that they have failed to "fully cooperate" in
the war on drugs.
The 26-15 vote — cutting across the political
spectrum — reflected mounting Congressional
impatience over the exporting of illegal drugs
to the United States. But the measure still
faces formidable legislative hurdles.
The ambivalence of Congress on how far to
go in cracking down on countries that produce
drugs was revealed when the committee backed
away from taking similar action against
Mexico, a country that represents a far larger
but politically more sensitive element in the
problem of international drug trafficking.
Indeed, at least one member of the commit
tee, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-111., bluntly suggested
that the punitive moves were politically self
indulgent. "To get confrontational with these
poor little countries is dumb, it's unwise, it's
insensitive. .. . But it makes us feel good.
We've struck a blow," said Hyde, who voted
against the measure.
Reagan must obey ABM treaty
WASHINGTON — Despite a Republican
outcry that Congress should not limit Presi
dent Reagan's bargaining position on arms
control just before next month's Moscow sum
mit, the House voted overwhelmingly yester
day to force Reagan to abide strictly by the
Anti-Ballistic Missile and SALT 2 treaties.
The House voted 252-159 to require the
president for another year to abide by the
traditional interpretation of the 1972 ABM
Treaty, which prohibits testing of components
of the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly
known as "Star Wars."
And by a vote of 240-174, the House passed
a provision that would force the administration
to adhere to the limits imposed by the un
ratified SALT 2 treaty on specific classes of
strategic weapons. Although Reagan observed
those limits during most of his presidency, he
has not done so for more than a year.
The arms control provisions were adopted
as amendments to a $299.5 billion defense
spending measure for fiscal 1989, which begins
Oct. 1.
The amendment requiring Reagan to abide
by the ABM interpretation was written by
House Armed Services Committee chairman
Les Aspin, D-Wis., and is expected to be ap
proved by the Senate and accepted by the
president.
