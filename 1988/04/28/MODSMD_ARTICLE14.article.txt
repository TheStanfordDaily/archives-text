# Senate passes sweeping trade bill
## But Democrats fail to win Republican support necessary to override veto 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Senate yes
terday approved a sweeping revision
of trade laws, 63 to 36, but Democrats
failed to win the Republican support
that would be needed to override a
certain veto by President Reagan.
"I believe this bill is dead," said Sen.
John Danforth, R-Mo., who supported
the measure and had tried to bring
other GOP lawmakers into the fold.
But it was unclear whether the
prospect of successful veto would end
this year's contentious congressional
debate on the trade issue, which has
helped raise economic tensions be
tween the United States and Japan to
new heights.
Danforth and Senate Finance Com
mittee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-
Tex., said there is a chance Congress
could still pass trade legislation this
year if the president and the Demo

cratic congressional leadership can
agree on a bill that eliminates a plant
closing notification provision that
emerged as the prime reason for the
president's veto threat.
"I really have a can-do attitude
about it," said Danforth. But Bentsen
said, "I'm not sure they (administra
tion officials) want a bill."
He suggested that if President
Reagan does desire a trade bill this
year, the veto message should focus
tightly on the plant-closing provision.
"If the administration comes in with
a laundry list, it means they don't
want a bill," Bentsen said.
"President Reagan wants a sound
trade law in 1988, and we are so close
to reaching that objective that it would
be tragic not to pursue it," said U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
Although plant closing was the only

provision he mentioned, he did not
commit the president to focus the veto
message on that issue.
Only 11 Republicans joined 52 Dem
ocrats in voting for the bill. All Dem
ocrats but one supported the measure,
with Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
the lone Democrat voting with 35 Re
publicans in opposition.
The bill — passed by the House last
week by an overwhelming 312-107
margin, enough to override a veto —
is the most sweeping trade bill passed
by Congress since World War 11. It
gives the president the authority to
negotiate a new round of global trade
talks and makes it easier to attack
foreign unfair trade practices.
Bentsen and Danforth, two of the
prime movers behind the legislation,
said it represents Congress' determi

nation to force the White House to
target trade policies to help the U.S.
industries that are most important to
the nation's success in world markets.
But the bill foundered on a provision
forcing companies to give 60 days'
notice of plant closings or large layoffs,
which the Democratic leadership kept
in the bill at the urging of organized
labor despite strong opposition from
business and the president's veto
threat.
Danforth said plant closing measure
was too heavy a burden for the bill
to carry with the White House and
business opposition it attracted. "It's
like swimming the English Channel
and you get two miles from the shore
when someone hands you a 200-pound
barbell," he said.
