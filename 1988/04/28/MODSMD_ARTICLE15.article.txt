# Mulroney fails to get U.S. action on acid rain
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan yesterday all but rejected
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mul
roney's program to reduce the acid
rain that Mulroney says is destroying
the North American environment and
damaging the economies of both na
tions.
In what Canadian officials said was
a last-gasp effort to reach an agree
ment before Reagan leaves office, Mul
roney presented the elements of a draft
accord to cut the emissions of sulfides
and nitrogen oxides and other pollut
ants.
"An accord is inevitable," Mulroney
was quoted by Canadian officials as
telling the president during a private
30-minute White House meeting.
"Therefore, it is not a question of
whether but of when."
But officials from both governments
agreed that Mulroney's program had
almost no chance of being accepted.
"The president gave the predictable
American view," said a resigned
Canadian official.
Reagan told Mulroney, the official
said, that the United States had al
ready reduced emissions and was
making progress toward finding a way
to burn coal — the source of much
acid rain — more cleanly. The presi
dent also reportedly insisted that there
was not sufficient scientific evidence

linking acid rain to the alleged envi
ronmental damage.
"So unless there is a 180-degree
change, we have no expectation that
a door will open and something of
importance will transpire," another
Canadian official said.
A senior American official said that
although Reagan agreed to take an
other look at the Canadian position,
"we have not bridged the gap on dif
ferent views" on acid rain.
"We have difficulty finding a basis
for moving forward," she said. "There

will be no action on acid rain while
President Reagan is in office."
The question of acid rain, the single
greatest irritant in U.S.-Canadian re
lations, has resulted in unprecedented
personal criticism by Mulroney, who
otherwise claims to be Reagan's best
and most consistent foreign friend and
supporter.
But increasing domestic political
pressure, coupled with growing
evidence that airborne pollutants from
American factories are major causes
in the damage to thousands of lakes,
waterways and forests in Canada, has
forced Mulroney to say that Reagan
has "deeply disappointed" him with a
"wholly unacceptable" position.
Although officials said the prime
minister yesterday avoided strident
statements in his meeting with
Reagan, he stuck by a statement he
made to American reporters last week
that the United States was like a
neighbor who was "dumping garbage
in my back yard."
The basic Canadian position is that
at least half of the sulfides and
nitrogen oxides that cause acid rain
originate in the United States and that
acid rain has resultecTTn the environ
mental deaths of 15,000 lakes and
serious damage to 150,000 more.
On the basis of what he thought
was a Reagan commitment made last

year when the two met in Ottawa to
sign an accord that would set out a
timetable with specific emission reduc
tion targets, Mulroney proposed a
step-by-step program in January that
would reduce American emissions by
half by 1994. The Americans rejected
that program on grounds that more
study was necessary to establish a link
between acid rain and the claimed
damage.
Reagan repeated that position yes
terday in his welcoming remarks to
Mulroney, who is in Washington for
a yearly meeting with the president,
saying that "more will be done as sci
ence points the way."
After the rebuff by Reagan, Mul
roney took his pitch to Capitol Hill
where he told a joint session of
Congress that while "the cost of re
ducing acid rain is substantial, . . . the
cost of inaction is greater still."
The damage is not only to Canada,
he added, and it is not limited to the
environment. "It is a rapidly escalating
ecological tragedy in this country as
well."
In other matters, Mulroney asked
for and got assurances from Reagan
that the White House would push for
quick congressional approval of a U.S.-
Canadian free-trade agreement signed
last year.
