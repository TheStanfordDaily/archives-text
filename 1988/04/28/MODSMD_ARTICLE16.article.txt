# Top Contra leaders feuding
## Infighting weakens Contras at peace talks 
### 
TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras — A rift be
tween the top two Contra leaders has
shaken the U.S.-backed rebel movement
and apparently weakened its hand in peace
talks with Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment, U.S. and rebel officials say.
The feuding came to a head last weekend
when Adolfo Calero, the Contra civilian
leader, tried to take control of the rebel
army in what one American official called
"an attempted putsch" against the rebels'
military commander, Enrique Bermudez.
Backed by most rebel field commanders
at a meeting here, Bermudez retained his
overall command and ousted five support
ers of Calero, including two leading nego
tiators, from their military posts.
The one-time allies patched up their dis
pute on paper yesterday. But American
and rebel officials said the divisive issues
remain unsettled.
As a result of the feud, Contra officials
fear they are in a weaker position to win
from the Sandinista regime the democratic
reforms and other concessions that they
say are essential for a permanent peace
agreement.
"We all have the same goal of a demo
cratic Nicaragua, but some of us think we
have to negotiate with a pistol on the table
and others think we have to treat the
Sandinistas with courtesy," said Jaime
Morales Carazo, a Contra negotiator. "But
before we can deal with the enemy, we
have to overcome the rivalries and
jealousies within our own house."
Privately, the Reagan administration ap
peared to back both sides in the power
struggle, rebel officials said. Then, fearing
the rift had undermined the rebel cause,
it pushed them hard to make peace with
each other.
Elliott Abrams, assistant U.S. secretary
of state for Latin American affairs, flew

to Miami Tuesday evening and met with
the entire rebel leadership, including Ber
mudez.
The military high command issued a
statement yesterday supporting the rebel
civilian leaders' conduct of peace negotia
tions, which are to resume in Managua
today. The three days of talks are aimed
at turning a truce accord signed last month
into a formal cease-fire.
Earlier, Calero and the rest of the four
member Contra political directorate issued
their own statement supporting a separa
tion of civilian and military authority.
In a telephone interview from Miami,
Calero denied that he had attempted to
oust Bermudez. "I am not that dumb," he
said. "I have my job and (Bermudez) has
his."
A diplomat with inside knowledge of the
Contras said their truce on paper "has
restored a necessary facade of unity, but
who knows for how long?"
Contra leaders have been feuding openly
since the rise of their insurgency six years
ago, but a reorganization last year gave
the rebels a broad-based civilian directorate
and a degree of political unity.
Until the reorganization, Calero was ci
vilian chief of the Contras' main military
force, which is based in Honduras and com
manded by Bermudez. A conservative po
litical leader, Calero became the dominant
figure on the new directorate, while Ber
mudez, a like-minded former National
Guard officer under the Anastasio Somoza
dictatorship, was confirmed in his military
post.
Bermudez's trust of Calero was under
mined last year as the Iran-Contra hearings
in the United States revealed how Calero
had spent U.S. funds without Bermudez's
knowledge, an American official said.
