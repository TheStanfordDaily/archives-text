# Israeli report:
## Shooting an 'accident' 
### 
JERUSALEM - An Israeli
teen-ager killed in the West
Bank Arab village of Beita
three weeks ago was acciden
tally shot to death by an Israeli
guard who had previously ex
acerbated tensions with the vil
lagers through negligence,
recklessness, and "superfluous
hastiness" in firing his weapon,
according to an official army
report released here yesterday.
The report was also sharply
critical of the organizer of the
outing during which Tirza
Porat, 15, was slain and many
of her 15 teen-age companions
injured. It said he violated
standing orders in the occupied
territories that such outings
must be coordinated with the
army.
Still, according to the report,
the primary blame for the con
troversial incident lies with the
local Arabs who initiated it by
throwing stones at the hikers
and their two armed guards
from the nearby West Bank
Jewish settlement of Elon
Moreh.
In volatile situations such as
existed in and around Beita at
the time of the April 6 killing,
stated deputy army spokes
man, Col. Raanan Gissin, "the
responsibility lies with the one
that puts the match to the
brush." In this case, he added,
that was the Arabs.
A condensed version of the
long-awaited army report,

some of which had already been
selectively leaked to the press,
was distributed at a Jerusalem
press conference yesterday,
within hours of the full report's
submission to senior govern
ment ministers at an "inner
Cabinet" meeting.
Separately, Msy. Gen. Am
ram Mitzna, army commander
of the West Bank, gave copies
of the report to leaders of the
Jewish settlement movement,
who had previously complained
bitterly that the military was
trying to shift blame in the
affair from the Arabs to the
settlers.
Israel Radio reported last
night that the settlement
leaders expressed their satis
faction with the final draft be
cause it placed the primary
blame on "the motivation and
aggression evinced by the local
Arabs and their readiness to
harm a group of Jewish
hikers."
However, a leftist member
of the Israeli Parliament
demanded that the organizer
of the ill-fated hike be indicted,
and the Peace Now movement
advocated a further govern
ment inquiry into the settlers'
culpability.
The army has already
destroyed 14 homes in the vil
lage belonging to Arabs it ac
cuses of playing leading roles
in the April 6 clash.
