KABUL, Afghanistan â€” A truck bomb
exploded in downtown Kabul yesterday, kil
ling six people and wounding 49, according
to the chief of the local security forces.
"This is the result of the acts of enemies
of peace and national reconciliation," said
Brig. Gen. Saifullah, head of the Interior
Ministry police unit in the capital.
The general, who appeared at a press
conference to brief visiting foreign
reporters, said it was the first time a truck
had been used to carry what he described
as a "time bomb" into the city. He blamed
"extremist groups," a term used by the
government to describe the seven U.S.-
backed Afghan resistance factions based in
Peshawar, Pakistan.
Saifullah said security forces had uncov
ered weapons and explosives smuggled into
the city to disrupt celebrations marking

the 10th anniversary of the Marxist revo
lution.
The main ceremony took place Tuesday
without incident and the final festivities
were held in the stadium today, several
miles from the site of the explosion.
The truck exploded shortly after noon,
a busy time in the city. However, it was
parked in a relatively isolated lot. The blast,
heard across the city, destroyed two buses
and two taxis and shattered windows in
buildings 300 yards away.
Western journalists rushed to the scene
but were turned back by soldiers and police,
who sought to prevent picture-taking.
United Press International reporter Jona
than Landay and Japanese freelance pho
tographer Yasusuke Ota were detained for
90 mintes and their film was confiscated.
