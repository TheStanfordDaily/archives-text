## Rush is improving 
### 
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
W!:h Irst tragedy-free
Rush in recent years, Stanford
fraternities- should view this lim
ited success ;stepping stone to
improve Rush even further.
While \ signs indicate that
no se ious mishaps occurred this
spring, memories of Zeta Psi David
Dunshee's de th by drowning last
year and tlv near-death of then
freshman Dave Curry, who was
beaten by two members of the
Delta Upsilons two years ago, still
leave ugly stains on the fraternal
system's reputation here.
» This year' - Rush has the poten
tial to m rk ne beginning of a
new trend.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who ha been a constant
critic of Rush recently, called Rush
this year "a good omen" for the
Interfrate \ ' -nncil. Hopefully,
this spring can be taken as an in
die; 1 .!! # ; n ress is being
made.

been successful, and IFC members
should be acknowledged for their
work.
Compared to last year — when
both the IFC's plan to keep tabs
on rushees by issuing rush cards
and its alcohol education program
were largely ignored — this is a
welcome change.
Strengthening the IFC's power
to enforce its regulations is one
way fraternities can and should
work to ensure a safe Rush.
However, IFC members should
keep in mind that holding onto a
wet Rush policy of serving alcohol
will continue to undermine their
best efforts to prevent future
tragedies from occurring.
Although fraternity members
claim they do not pressure rushees
to drink, this year, as every year,
drinking was encouraged at Rush
parties. And as evidence shows,
this often leads to irresponsible
drinking, especially at large par
ties, resulting in violence — and
sometimes even death.
Fraternities will only convince
the Stanford community that they
are wholeheartedly committed to
changing their reputation and be
coming responsible for their ac
tions when they stop serving alco
hol during Rush. But until this
happens, the fraternal system
must continue to bend over back
wards to prevent a replay of past
events.
So far so good.
