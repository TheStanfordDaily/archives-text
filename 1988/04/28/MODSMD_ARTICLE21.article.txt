- To the contrary, by continuing to op

these companies have tended to reinforce

tJhe determination of white South

• Since only the whites have any political
power, apartheid can end peacefully only
when international pressure against the
whites becomes so intense that the price
t>f continuing apartheid becomes higher
liian its benefits to whites.
■ The Western nations have begun to
respond to thi challenge' by imposing

but much more is needed.
South African whites have a paranoia
about becoming a pariah among the West
ern nations.
Massive corporate withdrawal would be
a powerful weapon to help convey the
message to South African whites that:
1. Apartheid is morally intolerable.
2. Apartheid is so intolerable that the
international community will not par
ticipate within the system of apartheid
in any way.
3. Isolation and economic deprivation
must be a part of the price of continu
ing apartheid.
Despite the South African government
making it a crime to call for sanctions
and disinvestment, most black leaders
are pleading with us to accelerate such
actions regardless of the short-run
hardships they may cause because these
actions provide the only hope of peace
fully ending the nightmare of apartheid
within our lifetimes.
For many of us, corporate withdrawal
from South Africa has become a moral
imperative.

South Africa is one of the
world's worst countries.
Revolution stands round
the corner. The West, es
pecially the United States,
has a moral duty to inter
vene — all the more so

since South Africa constitutes a Western
economic dependency. At the very least,
disinvestment and boycotts will send a
mpral message that Pretoria cannot ig
nore.
Such is the regnant orthodoxy at Stan
ford. But its assumptions are either mis
taken or require modification. South
Africa is indeed a harsh and un
democratic country in need of far
reaching reforms. But South Africa is
not the world's worst country, nor nearly
the worst.
In terms of the number of people who
have been jailed, executed, killed in civil
war or famines, South Africa unfortunat
ley does not stand at the top of the
world's list.
Other African countries such as An
gola, Ethiopia and Uganda have had a
much worse record of misery and
bloodshed — not to speak of non-African
countries such as the Soviet Union, Al
bania, Vietnam and Cambodia. Yet it is
only South Africa that is singled out by
progressive opinion for boycotts and dis
investment campaigns — not the Soviet
Union, not Ethiopia.
Western progressives have all too often
adopted a dual standard regarding South
Africa. One specific example may suffice.
In 1960, 67 Africans died in rioting at
Sharpeville in South Africa. Sharpeville
thereafter became an international word
of horror.
By contrast, something between
100,000 to 200,000 Hutu people were
slain by their Tutsi overlords during the
late 1960s and early 19705. There were
no protests in the West. Not a soul sug
gested boycotts against Burundi — or
against Ethoipia, which in recent years

has done even worse.
South Africa has circumvented U.S.
sanctions in a variety of ways. Japan has
now taken the United States' former
place as one of South Africa's
trading partners. South Africa's African
neighbors, far from cutting down their
trade with South Africa, have expanded
their commerce — no matter what is
said in the U.N.
South Africa, in certain respects, in
vites comparison with the Soviet Union.
Both systems require far-reaching, ruth
less reforms. Since Mikhail Gorbachev
has come to power, he has received praise
on the part of Western progressives.
His call for glasnost is to be welcomed;
however, most of his proposed reforms
remain to be carried out. But what if
Gorbachev were truly to change the So
viet Union? Imagine the Soviet Union
with a legal opposition in parliament, an
oppositional press, oppositional publish
ing houses, oppositional universities,
trade unions that can actually go on
strike!
These rights exist in South Africa. Seen
within the South African context, Botha
did indeed begin as a reformer. Yet the
West began to intensify its boycott cam
paign at the very time when Botha had
begun to effect some systemic changes.
The boycott campaign, in effect, has
helped only to strengthen the South
African right, diminish U.S. influence
and speed the ongoing Afrikanerization
of the South African economy.
Speaking "objectively," in Marxist par
lance, the true beneficiary of the disin
vestment campaign has been the
Afrikaner national bourgeoisie.
The United States should indeed back
reforms in South Africa. But the U.S.
cannot do so, if Americans attempt to
deal with Pretoria as if South Africa were
a U.S. vassal state.
