## Where is all the rain? 
### 
"Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
"I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
"Rainy days and Mondays always get
me down ..."
"It's raining, it's pouring ..."
"Here comes the rain again ..."
"I'm singin' in the rain ..."

HOW MANY RAINY tunes do you
remember?
Well Stanford, clear your
throats and get ready to sing because it's
going to take a campus-wide rain dance
to prevent the impending doom of
drought that Stanford faces this spring.
Why the water shortage? According to
the San Francisco Chronicle, the recent
"spring rains have helped some, but it
is still not epough to prevent a California
water crisis. Unless there is a near-deluge
soon, the spring runoff from the winter
snowpack is expected to be only 30 to
35 percent of normal." That is to say
that we're only getting 30 percent of the
water we need to replenish our sources.
In the most obvious sense, we simply
had too many beautiful days this year.
We have not gotten enough rain or snow
this year to maintain millions of Califor
nians and their food crops that will feed
the rest of the nation.
After suffering the driest February and
March on record, the state water agencies
found that they had allocated too much

water to agricultural interests. Unfortu
nately, this realization came too late to
cut back on agriculture water allocation
— the crops were already planted and
ready to be watered.
So, rather than cut back on the state's
annual $10 billion irrigated crops indus
try — an industry that uses an estimated
85 percent of the state's water — the
water agencies of the Bay area are in
the process of developing water conser
vation policies and water rationing plans
to be enforced as soon as possible.
Los Angeles, San Francisco and the
East Bay communities are all considering
both voluntary and mandatory water con
servation measures. The Bay Area has
to cut its water consumption by 25 per
cent to avoid depleting reserves that may
be needed in case of another dry period
next year.
It seems surprising then that Southern
California only has to reduce its water
consumption by 10 percent — that is a
voluntary reduction of 10 percent for 10
million people. There is a reason, though:
Southern California has multiple water
sources and reservoirs, while the Bay
Area has only a few sources that happen
to be fairly dry this year.
What does all of this mean for us and
for Stanford? It means using our water
wisely. Regardless of whether Stanford
comes under the restrictions and ration
ing of the rest of the area, the only
responsible measures we can take here

(leaving rain dances aside for a moment)
are in the area of water conservation.
When was the last time you thought
about taking a quick shower instead of
a long, relaxed one? What about all the
water it took to fill up Lake Lag? Or
about all the plants and shrubs on
campus that get watered daily? Or even
about the 50 gallons of water that
into every load of laundry you do?
At a time when restaurants in some
areas are being prohibited from giving
out glasses of water and gardens are
watered every other day, I don't think
that using less water is too much of a
task for us to cope with.
So, the next time you see your room
mate taking half-hour showers, or some
bratty little kid singing "rain, rain, go
away .. . do me a favor and swat him
over the head with a rolled-up copy of
The Daily.
Remember: Water conservation is the
key.
