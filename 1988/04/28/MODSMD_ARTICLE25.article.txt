## Return occupied lands 
### 
THE APRIL 5 LETTER by Ari
Cartun comes at a time when
the world has started to learn
about the truth and the ugly side of
Israel, a fact that was long concealed
by the Jewish lobby in the United
States.
Last month former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger was quoted in
the April 11 issue of Time magazine as
telling a group of American Jewish
leaders that the insurrection must be
quelled immediately and the first step
is to throw out television, a la South
Africa.
Following Kissinger's recommenda
tions, Cartun tries to distract the naive
readers by addressing the very impor
tant issue of dissimilarity between
Israel and South Africa!
You often hear the misuse of words
like "Israel's Declaration of Indepen
dence"! According to my understand
ing, independence, in its simplest form,
means to get rid of an outside invader.
Maybe Cartun meant "Israel's Declara
tion of Occupation." That would make
more sense.
For example, we say that Germany,
during the Second World War "occu
pied" France and that France, with the
help of the Allies, expelled the Ger
mans and declared "independence." It
would be stupid to claim that the
German invasion of France is itself a
"Declaration of Independence" of the
Germans! Independence is not a word
to play with and claim it is in the eyes
of the beholder.
Living in a jungle ruled by the
stronger, the British, at the beginning
of this century, unlawfully decided to
divide the region, just like cutting a
cake, and give land that does not
belong to them to people who did not
have the right in it, displacing the
original people, the Palestinians!

Claiming that Israel rules a majority
of Jews is very misleading. Of course,
if we expel and kill the natives, the
Palestinians, they become a minority.
There are about two million Pales
tinians living in the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and inside Israel. They constitute
more than 40 percent of Israel's popu
lation, not 17 percent as claimed by
Cartun! There are also about 3 million
Palestinians living, as refugees all over
the world, waiting to return to their
homeland Palestine.
Since the creation of Israel, the
Israelis have tried their best to wipe
out the Palestinians by all means. The
massacres of 1948 and "Sabra and
Shatilla" in Lebanon in 1981 is only
an example. The West Bank and the
Gaza strip are kept undeveloped and
unhuman to live in, as described by a
British journalist who visited the area
recently.
Despite the low standard of living of
the Palestinians in the occupied ter
ritories, very high taxes are collected
to make things only worse! Trying to
deceive the whole world by saying that
Israel has accomplished much for the
Palestinians, is nothing but a straight
lie!
Also, a few months ago we heard
that four Palestinians were laid with
their face to the ground and buried
alive by bulldozers driven by Israelis in
the West Bank (Of course, this comes
in accordance with the "international
law" and "human rights" as claimed
by Cartun). If this is the same "inter
national law" Cartun meant, I think
we are not speaking English! Commit
ting those horrible crimes is unforgiv
able, but to give them any sort of legal
cover is disgusting!
Even in Central America we call
some groups rebels and others terror
ists according to who is on our side!

The Palestinians, and the Arabs in
general, fighting to restore their seized
lands and dignity are not terrorists!
The U.S. policy in the Middle East
might lead to an explosion, by blindly
supporting Israel and its claims. Some
Americans have dared to speak out,
but unfortunately they were destroyed
by the Jewish lobby. I advise the
reader to read "They Dare to Speak
Out" by Paul Findley.
Claiming that the Palestinians get
fair trials in court in accordance with
the Geneva Convention (note the use
of flashy headings again!) is a joke and
is not worth replying to.
Last but not least, the recent events
in the occupied territories are indeed
very alarming. In the name of
"revenge" the Jewish settlers are
allowed to carry guns and kill as they
wish, but for Palestinians to throw
stones is a crime.
Last week when an Israeli girl was
killed, by mistake, by the Israelis
themselves, the village was stormed by
the Jewish settlers and the army,
killing and wounding tens of Palestini
ans and destroying their houses.
Nobody cares about the hundreds of
Palestinians who died since the begin-.
ning of the uprising, but all the world
has to stop when an Israeli dies! If the
Palestinians are to use any force in
return, they will not be blamed.
