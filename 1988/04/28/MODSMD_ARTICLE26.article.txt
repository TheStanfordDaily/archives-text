# Protest Quach firing
## 
### 
WE ARE WRITING in protest of
the University's treatment of
Long Quach, an Asian im
migrant worker who was recently fired
by the Mechanical Engineering depart
ment. We are disappointed in the way
the University has handled this situa
tion and unsatisfied with the reasons
it has given for the firing of Long
Quach.
How is it possible that Quach, doing
work that is protected under the union
agreement, could be hired at the end
of March 1987 as a temporary (after
first being told it was a permanent
position) and allowed to work until he
was "officially" hired in early Decem
ber?
Doesn't the union agreement regard
ing temporaries limit the time some
body can be kept as a temporary to
four months of continuous work, and
if the person works longer he then
becomes permanent?
Why is it that Quach was able to
work in the Mechanical Engineering
Department for a year without any
complaints and is now found to be
unqualified for his duties? Does it have
anything to do with the grievances the
union filed on his behalf in mid-
March?
Why did the University, in early
March 1988, ask the union to extend
Quach's trial period when he had
already exceeded any trial period by
working at the same job for an entire
year? Why wasn't Long Quach in
formed of his rights as a worker from
the very beginning?
The University has a history of
abusing the rights of workers, particu
larly immigrants who aren't as familiar
with their rights.
Further action taken by the Mechan
ical Engineering Department points to
a set-up: When the union refused the

request for an extension of Long's trial
period he was assigned tasks normally
given to a person several levels above
him to pass a probationary period
(even his supervisor had to consult
with an engineer to complete the
assignment); he was assigned tasks
that violated safety standards, putting
him in physical danger; the standard
procedure of handling charges of poor
work performance was not followed;
and he was verbally harassed on the
job to the point of having to take sick
leave just to escape.
Finally, on April 12, 1988, Quach
was fired for "unsatisfactory work
performance."
We feel that his case exemplifies the
University's fundamental disrespect for
workers. We feel that it is hypocritical
for the University to say it supports
pluralism and multi-culturalism and
then deny the rights of an Asian im
migrant because they think they can
get away with it.
We are seeking the support of the
entire Stanford community on behalf
of Quach for:
• The immediate reinstatement of Long
Quach as a permanent wroker, receiv
ing his rightful wages and benefits;
• an open hearing regarding the com
pensation of back wages and benefits
owed to him;
• protection from further harassment
and violations of his rights.
We hope the University acts quickly
in resolving this matter and demon
strates its respect for workers and for
Asian people.
