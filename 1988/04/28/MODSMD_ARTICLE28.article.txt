## Coming to terms with a complex virus Pitfalls and progress in AIDS research 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Science Editor 
A deadly virus shrouded in a
protein and lipid envelope
searches the body for cells marked
by proteins it recognizes.
When the lethal package of
protein and RNA recognizes a cell,
it splits one of its outer proteins
and fuses with the cell.

Once inside, the virus inte
grates the cell's genetic material
with its own, beginning a process
that produces many more deadly
copies of itself and ultimately kills
the cell.
The preceding story is true, but
changing the names does not
protect the innocent. The virus is
called HIV, for human im
munodeficiency virus; its target
is a human immune cell called
the helper T lymphocyte. If the
virus succeeds, the result is AIDS.
AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, is primarily
a disease of the immune system.
AIDS patients die from infections
that do not produce symptoms in
healthy people whose immune
systems can easily destroy many

pathogenic invaders.
AIDS has confounded the med
ical community since it was first
named — researchers have been
unable to develop a cure, vaccine
or an effective treatment for the
syndrome. But recent break
throughs in the field may lead to
a solution to the puzzle.
Latest developments
Some of the most recent AIDS
research is being done at the lab
oratory of Dr. Irving Weissman,
University professor of pathology.
Postdoctoral scholar Dr. Mike
McCune, a researcher in Weis
sman's lab, discovered the impor
tance of cleaving an envelope
protein to activate the virus for
fusion with human cells.
McCune's discovery was reported
in the April 8 issue of Cell, a
biology journal.
The work that led up to
McCune's finding include that of
University scientists Dr. Jeff Lif
son and Dr. Barry Stein. Lifson
determined that viral envelope
proteins are necessary for infec
tion, and Stein learned that the
virus fuses with the outside
membrane of a human cell, not

with the cell interior.
Dr. Edgar Engleman's labora
tory at the Medical Center was
among the first to discover the
molecule that transports the virus
to infect the immune cell. The
AIDS virus enters and destroys
only those T lymphocytes that
have a special protein molecule
called the T4 or CD4 receptor.
Already, research has "led to
the isolation of the virus, the def
inition of its genetic structure, the
demonstration that it is associ
ated with each of the disease com
plexes occurring in AIDS patients,
and especially that the virus ap
pears to attract and cause the
elimination of a critical subset of
protective cells in the body — the
CD4 T lymphocytes," according
to a 1987 statement of Weissman
before the U.S. House subcom
mittee on Health and the Envi
ronment.
In the last two or three years,
scientists have made a great deal
of progress in determining what
proteins the genes of the AIDS
virus encode and the function of
those proteins, according to
Engleman.
The next steps
Although much has been
learned about the AIDS virus and
its effects on the human immune
system, much more needs to be
known before scientists can find
drugs to treat AIDS patients, to
restore the immune systems of
such patients or to develop AIDS
vaccines to protect uninfected in
dividuals, according to Weis
sman's statement.
McCune's discovery suggests
the possibility of finding a drug
to block the fusion of the AIDS
virus with human cells, but it is

too soon to say whether such
drugs can be developed or if they
would be safe and effective for
clinical use, according to the Med
ical Center.
More knowledge is needed. For
example, preventing the cleavage
of the crucial viral protein would
require blocking the cleaving en
zyme, which has not yet been
identified.
"It is inevitable that we will be
able to come up with effective
therapy (for AIDS patients),"
Engleman said. Engleman expects
to see treatments, although not
necessarily cures, developed
within the next five to 10 years.
These treatments would allow an
AIDS patients to survive longer
and suffer fewer symptoms but
would require continual use.
The only treatment for AIDS
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration is AZT, or azido
thymidine. AZT works by blocking
an important viral enzyme called
reverse transcriptase. Without
reverse transcriptase, the virus
