## Coming to terms with a complex virus Pitfalls and progress in AIDS research 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Science Editor 
A deadly virus shrouded in a
protein and lipid envelope
searches the body for cells marked
by proteins it recognizes.
When the lethal package of
protein and RNA recognizes a cell,
it splits one of its outer proteins
and fuses with the cell.

Once inside, the virus inte
grates the cell's genetic material
with its own, beginning a process
that produces many more deadly
copies of itself and ultimately kills
the cell.
The preceding story is true, but
changing the names does not
protect the innocent. The virus is
called HIV, for human im
munodeficiency virus; its target
is a human immune cell called
the helper T lymphocyte. If the
virus succeeds, the result is AIDS.
AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, is primarily
a disease of the immune system.

that do not produce symptoms in
healthy people whose immune
systems can easily destroy many

pathogenic invaders.
AIDS has confounded the med
ical community since it was first
named — researchers have been
unable to develop a cure, vaccine
or an effective treatment for the
syndrome. But recent break
throughs in the field may lead to
a solution to the puzzle.
Latest developments
Some of the most recent AIDS
research is being done at the lab
oratory of Dr. Irving Weissman,
University professor of pathology.
Postdoctoral scholar Dr. Mike
McCune, a researcher in Weis
sman's lab, discovered the impor
tance of cleaving an envelope
protein to activate the virus for
fusion with human cells.
McCune's discovery was reported
in the April 8 issue of Cell, a
biology journal.
The work that led up to
McCune's finding include that of
University scientists Dr. Jeff Lif
son and Dr. Barry Stein. Lifson
determined that viral envelope
proteins are necessary for infec
tion, and Stein learned that the
virus fuses with the outside
membrane of a human cell, not

with the cell interior.
Dr. Edgar Engleman's labora
tory at the Medical Center was
among the first to discover the
molecule that transports the virus
to infect the immune cell. The
AIDS virus enters and destroys
only those T lymphocytes that
have a special protein molecule
called the T4 or CD4 receptor.
Already, research has "led to
the isolation of the virus, the def
inition of its genetic structure, the
demonstration that it is associ
ated with each of the disease com
plexes occurring in AIDS patients,
and especially that the virus ap
pears to attract and cause the
elimination of a critical subset of
protective cells in the body — the
CD4 T lymphocytes," according
to a 1987 statement of Weissman
before the U.S. House subcom
mittee on Health and the Envi
ronment.
In the last two or three years,
scientists have made a great deal
of progress in determining what
proteins the genes of the AIDS
virus encode and the function of
those proteins, according to
Engleman.
The next steps
Although much has been
learned about the AIDS virus and
its effects on the human immune
system, much more needs to be
known before scientists can find
drugs to treat AIDS patients, to
restore the immune systems of
such patients or to develop AIDS
vaccines to protect uninfected in
dividuals, according to Weis
sman's statement.
McCune's discovery suggests
the possibility of finding a drug
to block the fusion of the AIDS
virus with human cells, but it is

'It is inevitable that
we will be able to
come up with an
effective therapy
(for AIDS patients)'
within the next five
to 10 years.
— Edgar Engleman

too soon to say whether such
drugs can be developed or if they
would be safe and effective for
clinical use, according to the Med
ical Center.
More knowledge is needed. For
example, preventing the cleavage
of the crucial viral protein would
require blocking the cleaving en
zyme, which has not yet been
identified.
"It is inevitable that we will be
able to come up with effective
therapy (for AIDS patients),"
Engleman said. Engleman expects
to see treatments, although not
necessarily cures, developed
within the next five to 10 years.
These treatments would allow an
AIDS patients to survive longer
and suffer fewer symptoms but
would require continual use.
The only treatment for AIDS
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration is AZT, or azido
thymidine. AZT works by blocking
an important viral enzyme called
reverse transcriptase. Without
reverse transcriptase, the virus


%nnot integrate its genetic ma
terial into that of the infected cell.
Although AZT has prolonged
the life of many AIDS sufferers,
it is not a cure for AIDS and
results in some serious side ef
fects.
A vaccine for AIDS will be much
more difficult to develop, accord
ing to Engleman.
~ Vaccines are based on the prin
ciple of "immunological memory,"
Engleman said. In developing vac
cines, scientists try to introduce
.something into the body that
looks like the disease-causing sub
stance and induces a potent im
mune response, but which does
liot cause the disease. Vaccines
"prime" or ready an immune sys
tem for a possible encounter with
pathogenic foreign agent so that
vftien an agent enters the body,
the immune system will easily
eliminate it.
" "The difficulty in developing a
yaccine for AIDS is that the AIDS
Virus itself doesn't induce a very
§trong immune response. Scien
tists are currently using pieces of
the AIDS virus as possible vac
clhes. However, it is unlikely that
a piece of the virus would induce
a strong immune response when
the whole virus fails to do so,
fhigleman said.
'-'The lack of a strong immune
response to a foreign agent is a
pfoblem rarely encountered by
scientists trying to develop other
kinds of vaccines, according to

Engleman.
People do make antibodies,
molecules produced by immune
cells in response to foreign agents,
in response to the AIDS virus.
However, these antibodies, in al
most every case, are not effective
in fighting AIDS.
Another obstacle blocking the
development of an effective AIDS
vaccine is the ease with which the
AIDS virus mutates, or changes
its genetic structure. Therefore,
an individual could be vaccinated
against one form of the AIDS
virus and still be vulnerable to
an AIDS virus with a slightly dif
ferent genetic make-up.
Increased attention
An increasing number of
people, including doctors,
chemists and economists are
focusing their research on prob
lems related to AIDS, according
to Medical Center Chief of Infec
tious Diseases Tom Merigan.
Chemists are directing their ef
forts toward ways to inhibit the
virus, and many immunologists
have put an AIDS slant to ques
tions about the functioning of the
immune system. Economists are
focusing on the financial and so
cial consequences of AIDS.
Stanford is receiving approxi
mately $3.7 million in grants for
AIDS work, and Merigan expects
that amount to increase.
That funding goes to both clini
cal and basic research, which pro
vides background knowledge ne
cessary for more applied studies.
Knowledge gained through basic
research in immunology, virology,

lymphocyte biology, developmen
tal biology and neurobiology will
be important to future advances
in AIDS research, according to
Weissman's statement.
For example, studies of "models
of virus infections; molecular ge
netic research of several related
virus types; the fundamental
aspects of T cell development, in
cluding the origin and life history
of CD4 T lymphocytes" are di
rectly related to AIDS research,
providing important knowledge
on which to base clinical studies,
Weissman told the House subcom
mittee.
In addition, this fundamental
work on AIDS will provide infor
mation relevant to cancer treat
ment, organ transplants and
cures for other immunological dis
eases, Merigan said.
"The real challenge is to trans
late fundamental work into new
applications as rapidly as possi

ble," Merigan said.
Scientists must design weapons
that are well-tailored to both a
complex battlefield, the human
immune system, and an elusive
attacker, the AIDS virus. Thus,
fighting AIDS requires learning
about both the body's immune
system and the lifecycle of the
virus.
%
Various approaches
The main avenue of AIDS re
search and the one most likely to
lead toward the development of
therapeutic agents is studies of
the lifecycle of the virus. Lifecycle
questions include determining
what the virus needs to reproduce
itself, invade a cell and integrate
its genetic information with that
cell, according to Engleman.
"If we can find something a
virus needs and (humans) don't,
we should be able to get rid of
the molecule without affecting

humans," Engleman said. "The
problem is not so much that we
can't kill the virus — we can kill
it with bleach . . . but we have to
find a way of killing the virus
without killing ourselves."
Another approach in AIDS re
search examines the structures of
the molecules on the virus as well
as those attractive molecules on
human T lymphocytes which the
virus attack, according to Weis
sman's statement.
A third approach asks questions
about the course of the disease.
Such questions include how the
virus spreads from one cell tissue
to another and how the virus gets
rid of T lymphocytes that nor
mally protect against infection,
Weissman told the House subcom
mittee.
This third approach would be
greatly facilitated if an appropri
ate animal model could be found.
The HIV virus has only been

found to affect humans. However,
a naturally occuring virus that
causes a disease very similar to
AIDS has been found in the
monkey, the best known animal
model, Engleman said.
Dr. Edward Mocarski, Univer
sity assistant professor of micro
biology, has recently received
federai funding for research di
rected toward developing an AIDS
vaccine.
Engleman, one of the first to
discover the CD4 receptor, was
also the first to screen blood by
the number of T lymphocytes in
it. Low counts indicate infected
blood. Thus, Engleman was able
to screen blood for AIDS two years
before the AIDS antibody test was
developed for screening blood.

pathogenic invaders.
AIDS has confounded the med
ical community since it was first
named — researchers have been
unable to develop a cure, vaccine
or an effective treatment for the
syndrome. But recent break
throughs in the field may lead to
a solution to the puzzle.
Latest developments
Some of the most recent AIDS
research is being done at the lab
oratory of Dr. Irving Weissman,
University professor of pathology.
Postdoctoral scholar Dr. Mike
McCune, a researcher in Weis
sman's lab, discovered the impor
tance of cleaving an envelope
protein to activate the virus for
fusion with human cells.
McCune's discovery was reported
in the April 8 issue of Cell, a
biology journal.
The work that led up to
McCune's finding include that of
University scientists Dr. Jeff Lif
son and Dr. Barry Stein. Lifson
determined that viral envelope
proteins are necessary for infec
tion, and Stein learned that the
virus fuses with the outside
membrane of a human cell, not

with the cell interior.
Dr. Edgar Engleman's labora
tory at the Medical Center was
among the first to discover the
molecule that transports the virus
to infect the immune cell. The
AIDS virus enters and destroys
only those T lymphocytes that
have a special protein molecule
called the T4 or CD4 receptor.
Already, research has "led to
the isolation of the virus, the def
inition of its genetic structure, the
demonstration that it is associ
ated with each of the disease com
plexes occurring in AIDS patients,
and especially that the virus ap
pears to attract and cause the
elimination of a critical subset of
protective cells in the body — the
CD4 T lymphocytes," according
to a 1987 statement of Weissman
before the U.S. House subcom
mittee on Health and the Envi
ronment.
In the last two or three years,
scientists have made a great deal
of progress in determining what
proteins the genes of the AIDS
virus encode and the function of
those proteins, according to
Engleman.
The next steps
Although much has been
learned about the AIDS virus and
its effects on the human immune
system, much more needs to be
known before scientists can find
drugs to treat AIDS patients, to
restore the immune systems of
such patients or to develop AIDS
vaccines to protect uninfected in
dividuals, according to Weis
sman's statement.
McCune's discovery suggests
the possibility of finding a drug
to block the fusion of the AIDS
virus with human cells, but it is

'It is inevitable that
we will be able to
come up with an
effective therapy
(for AIDS patients)'
within the next five
to 10 years.
— Edgar Engleman

too soon to say whether such
drugs can be developed or if they
would be safe and effective for
clinical use, according to the Med
ical Center.
More knowledge is needed. For
example, preventing the cleavage
of the crucial viral protein would
require blocking the cleaving en
zyme, which has not yet been
identified.
"It is inevitable that we will be
able to come up with effective
therapy (for AIDS patients),"
Engleman said. Engleman expects
to see treatments, although not
necessarily cures, developed
within the next five to 10 years.
These treatments would allow an
AIDS patients to survive longer
and suffer fewer symptoms but
would require continual use.
The only treatment for AIDS
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration is AZT, or azido
thymidine. AZT works by blocking
an important viral enzyme called
reverse transcriptase. Without
reverse transcriptase, the virus


%nnot integrate its genetic ma
terial into that of the infected cell.
Although AZT has prolonged
the life of many AIDS sufferers,
it is not a cure for AIDS and
results in some serious side ef
fects.
A vaccine for AIDS will be much
more difficult to develop, accord
ing to Engleman.
~ Vaccines are based on the prin
ciple of "immunological memory,"
Engleman said. In developing vac
cines, scientists try to introduce
.something into the body that
looks like the disease-causing sub
stance and induces a potent im
mune response, but which does
liot cause the disease. Vaccines
"prime" or ready an immune sys
tem for a possible encounter with
pathogenic foreign agent so that
vftien an agent enters the body,
the immune system will easily
eliminate it.
" "The difficulty in developing a
yaccine for AIDS is that the AIDS
Virus itself doesn't induce a very
§trong immune response. Scien
tists are currently using pieces of
the AIDS virus as possible vac
clhes. However, it is unlikely that
a piece of the virus would induce
a strong immune response when
the whole virus fails to do so,
fhigleman said.
'-'The lack of a strong immune
response to a foreign agent is a
pfoblem rarely encountered by
scientists trying to develop other
kinds of vaccines, according to

Engleman.
People do make antibodies,
molecules produced by immune
cells in response to foreign agents,
in response to the AIDS virus.
However, these antibodies, in al
most every case, are not effective
in fighting AIDS.
Another obstacle blocking the
development of an effective AIDS
vaccine is the ease with which the
AIDS virus mutates, or changes
its genetic structure. Therefore,
an individual could be vaccinated
against one form of the AIDS
virus and still be vulnerable to
an AIDS virus with a slightly dif
ferent genetic make-up.
Increased attention
An increasing number of
people, including doctors,
chemists and economists are
focusing their research on prob
lems related to AIDS, according
to Medical Center Chief of Infec
tious Diseases Tom Merigan.
Chemists are directing their ef
forts toward ways to inhibit the
virus, and many immunologists
have put an AIDS slant to ques
tions about the functioning of the
immune system. Economists are
focusing on the financial and so
cial consequences of AIDS.
Stanford is receiving approxi
mately $3.7 million in grants for
AIDS work, and Merigan expects
that amount to increase.
That funding goes to both clini
cal and basic research, which pro
vides background knowledge ne
cessary for more applied studies.
Knowledge gained through basic
research in immunology, virology,

lymphocyte biology, developmen
tal biology and neurobiology will
be important to future advances
in AIDS research, according to
Weissman's statement.
For example, studies of "models
of virus infections; molecular ge
netic research of several related
virus types; the fundamental
aspects of T cell development, in
cluding the origin and life history
of CD4 T lymphocytes" are di
rectly related to AIDS research,
providing important knowledge
on which to base clinical studies,
Weissman told the House subcom
mittee.
In addition, this fundamental
work on AIDS will provide infor
mation relevant to cancer treat
ment, organ transplants and
cures for other immunological dis
eases, Merigan said.
"The real challenge is to trans
late fundamental work into new
applications as rapidly as possi

ble," Merigan said.
Scientists must design weapons
that are well-tailored to both a
complex battlefield, the human
immune system, and an elusive
attacker, the AIDS virus. Thus,
fighting AIDS requires learning
about both the body's immune
system and the lifecycle of the
virus.
%
Various approaches
The main avenue of AIDS re
search and the one most likely to
lead toward the development of
therapeutic agents is studies of
the lifecycle of the virus. Lifecycle
questions include determining
what the virus needs to reproduce
itself, invade a cell and integrate
its genetic information with that
cell, according to Engleman.
"If we can find something a
virus needs and (humans) don't,
we should be able to get rid of
the molecule without affecting

humans," Engleman said. "The
problem is not so much that we
can't kill the virus — we can kill
it with bleach . . . but we have to
find a way of killing the virus
without killing ourselves."
Another approach in AIDS re
search examines the structures of
the molecules on the virus as well
as those attractive molecules on
human T lymphocytes which the
virus attack, according to Weis
sman's statement.
A third approach asks questions
about the course of the disease.
Such questions include how the
virus spreads from one cell tissue
to another and how the virus gets
rid of T lymphocytes that nor
mally protect against infection,
Weissman told the House subcom
mittee.
This third approach would be
greatly facilitated if an appropri
ate animal model could be found.
The HIV virus has only been

found to affect humans. However,
a naturally occuring virus that
causes a disease very similar to
AIDS has been found in the
monkey, the best known animal
model, Engleman said.
Dr. Edward Mocarski, Univer
sity assistant professor of micro
biology, has recently received
federai funding for research di
rected toward developing an AIDS
vaccine.

Engleman, one of the first to

the number of T lymphocytes in
it. Low counts indicate infected
blood. Thus, Engleman was able

1. The AIDS virus attaches itself to CD4 proteins on the outside of the T lyphocyte ce!l; 2. the virus cleaves its own outer protein;
3. the virus fuses with the cell and integrates with the cell's genetic material; 4. the virus makes copies of itself; 5. the cell dies.
A deadly virus shrouded in a
protein and lipid envelope
searches the body for cells marked
by proteins it recognizes.
When the lethal package of
protein and RNA recognizes a cell,
it splits one of its outer proteins
and fuses with the cell.

Once inside, the virus inte
grates the cell's genetic material
with its own, beginning a process
that produces many more deadly
copies of itself and ultimately kills
the cell.
The preceding story is true, but
changing the names does not
protect the innocent. The virus is
called HIV, for human im
munodeficiency virus; its target
is a human immune cell called
the helper T lymphocyte. If the
virus succeeds, the result is AIDS.
AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, is primarily
a disease of the immune system.
AIDS patients die from infections
that do not produce symptoms in
healthy people whose immune
systems can easily destroy many

pathogenic invaders.
AIDS has confounded the med
ical community since it was first
named — researchers have been
unable to develop a cure, vaccine
or an effective treatment for the
syndrome. But recent break
throughs in the field may lead to
a solution to the puzzle.
Latest developments
Some of the most recent AIDS
research is being done at the lab
oratory of Dr. Irving Weissman,
University professor of pathology.
Postdoctoral scholar Dr. Mike
McCune, a researcher in Weis
sman's lab, discovered the impor
tance of cleaving an envelope
protein to activate the virus for
fusion with human cells.
McCune's discovery was reported
in the April 8 issue of Cell, a
biology journal.
The work that led up to
McCune's finding include that of
University scientists Dr. Jeff Lif
son and Dr. Barry Stein. Lifson
determined that viral envelope
proteins are necessary for infec
tion, and Stein learned that the
virus fuses with the outside
membrane of a human cell, not

with the cell interior.
Dr. Edgar Engleman's labora
tory at the Medical Center was
among the first to discover the
molecule that transports the virus
to infect the immune cell. The
AIDS virus enters and destroys
only those T lymphocytes that
have a special protein molecule
called the T4 or CD4 receptor.
Already, research has "led to
the isolation of the virus, the def
inition of its genetic structure, the
demonstration that it is associ
ated with each of the disease com
plexes occurring in AIDS patients,
and especially that the virus ap
pears to attract and cause the
elimination of a critical subset of
protective cells in the body — the
CD4 T lymphocytes," according
to a 1987 statement of Weissman
before the U.S. House subcom
mittee on Health and the Envi
ronment.
In the last two or three years,
scientists have made a great deal
of progress in determining what
proteins the genes of the AIDS
virus encode and the function of
those proteins, according to
Engleman.
The next steps
Although much has been
learned about the AIDS virus and
its effects on the human immune
system, much more needs to be
known before scientists can find
drugs to treat AIDS patients, to
restore the immune systems of
such patients or to develop AIDS
vaccines to protect uninfected in
dividuals, according to Weis
sman's statement.
McCune's discovery suggests
the possibility of finding a drug
to block the fusion of the AIDS
virus with human cells, but it is

too soon to say whether such
drugs can be developed or if they
would be safe and effective for
clinical use, according to the Med
ical Center.
More knowledge is needed. For
example, preventing the cleavage
of the crucial viral protein would
require blocking the cleaving en
zyme, which has not yet been
identified.
"It is inevitable that we will be
able to come up with effective
therapy (for AIDS patients),"
Engleman said. Engleman expects
to see treatments, although not
necessarily cures, developed
within the next five to 10 years.
These treatments would allow an
AIDS patients to survive longer
and suffer fewer symptoms but
would require continual use.
The only treatment for AIDS
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration is AZT, or azido
thymidine. AZT works by blocking
an important viral enzyme called
reverse transcriptase. Without
reverse transcriptase, the virus


%nnot integrate its genetic ma
terial into that of the infected cell.
Although AZT has prolonged
the life of many AIDS sufferers,
it is not a cure for AIDS and
results in some serious side ef
fects.
A vaccine for AIDS will be much
more difficult to develop, accord
ing to Engleman.
~ Vaccines are based on the prin
ciple of "immunological memory,"
Engleman said. In developing vac
cines, scientists try to introduce
.something into the body that
looks like the disease-causing sub
stance and induces a potent im
mune response, but which does
liot cause the disease. Vaccines
"prime" or ready an immune sys
tem for a possible encounter with
pathogenic foreign agent so that
vftien an agent enters the body,
the immune system will easily
eliminate it.
" "The difficulty in developing a
yaccine for AIDS is that the AIDS
Virus itself doesn't induce a very
§trong immune response. Scien
tists are currently using pieces of
the AIDS virus as possible vac
clhes. However, it is unlikely that
a piece of the virus would induce
a strong immune response when
the whole virus fails to do so,
fhigleman said.
'-'The lack of a strong immune
response to a foreign agent is a
pfoblem rarely encountered by
scientists trying to develop other
kinds of vaccines, according to

Engleman.
People do make antibodies,
molecules produced by immune
cells in response to foreign agents,
in response to the AIDS virus.
However, these antibodies, in al
most every case, are not effective
in fighting AIDS.
Another obstacle blocking the
development of an effective AIDS
vaccine is the ease with which the
AIDS virus mutates, or changes
its genetic structure. Therefore,
an individual could be vaccinated
against one form of the AIDS
virus and still be vulnerable to
an AIDS virus with a slightly dif
ferent genetic make-up.
Increased attention
An increasing number of
people, including doctors,
chemists and economists are
focusing their research on prob
lems related to AIDS, according
to Medical Center Chief of Infec
tious Diseases Tom Merigan.
Chemists are directing their ef
forts toward ways to inhibit the
virus, and many immunologists
have put an AIDS slant to ques
tions about the functioning of the
immune system. Economists are
focusing on the financial and so
cial consequences of AIDS.
Stanford is receiving approxi
mately $3.7 million in grants for
AIDS work, and Merigan expects
that amount to increase.
That funding goes to both clini
cal and basic research, which pro
vides background knowledge ne
cessary for more applied studies.
Knowledge gained through basic
research in immunology, virology,

lymphocyte biology, developmen
tal biology and neurobiology will
be important to future advances
in AIDS research, according to
Weissman's statement.
For example, studies of "models
of virus infections; molecular ge
netic research of several related
virus types; the fundamental
aspects of T cell development, in
cluding the origin and life history
of CD4 T lymphocytes" are di
rectly related to AIDS research,
providing important knowledge
on which to base clinical studies,
Weissman told the House subcom
mittee.
In addition, this fundamental
work on AIDS will provide infor
mation relevant to cancer treat
ment, organ transplants and
cures for other immunological dis
eases, Merigan said.
"The real challenge is to trans
late fundamental work into new
applications as rapidly as possi

ble," Merigan said.
Scientists must design weapons
that are well-tailored to both a
complex battlefield, the human
immune system, and an elusive
attacker, the AIDS virus. Thus,
fighting AIDS requires learning
about both the body's immune
system and the lifecycle of the
virus.

Various approaches
The main avenue of AIDS re
search and the one most likely to
lead toward the development of
therapeutic agents is studies of
the lifecycle of the virus. Lifecycle
questions include determining
what the virus needs to reproduce
itself, invade a cell and integrate
its genetic information with that
cell, according to Engleman.
"If we can find something a
virus needs and (humans) don't,
we should be able to get rid of
the molecule without affecting

humans," Engleman said. "The
problem is not so much that we
can't kill the virus — we can kill
it with bleach . . . but we have to
find a way of killing the virus
without killing ourselves."
Another approach in AIDS re
search examines the structures of
the molecules on the virus as well
as those attractive molecules on
human T lymphocytes which the
virus attack, according to Weis
sman's statement.
A third approach asks questions
about the course of the disease.
Such questions include how the
virus spreads from one cell tissue
to another and how the virus gets
rid of T lymphocytes that nor
mally protect against infection,
Weissman told the House subcom
mittee.
This third approach would be
greatly facilitated if an appropri
ate animal model could be found.
