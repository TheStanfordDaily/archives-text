## Merely a regional writer? Updike's flair doesn't do the trick in "S."

John Updike is one of those reliable
writers who just keeps on producing and
producing; this latest novel is his 13th
in 30 years, and his 32nd book overall.
Fortunately, he has next to nothing in
common with other familiar prolific writ
ers like James Michener, Robert Ludlum
and Danielle Steel — unless you want to
call Updike a genre writer, which those
writers all are, their genre being pulp.
I say next to nothing because it seems
Updike is falling into a genre trap of
another type — that of the proverbial
"regional writer." Updike would likely
recoil at the label, but there are many
among his greatest fans, myself included,
who wonder how long the wellspring of
New England fiction, to which he never
tires of returning, can stay fresh. No
matter how ripe the boroughs of Boston
and the hills of Pennsylvania may be for
fictional plowing, the man who has done
more such plowing than any other
modern author sets himself up for accu
sations of moldiness every time he writes
a new book situated in that less and less
compelling nook of the world.
Updike takes on these accusations by
agressively concentrating on a topic
which, to the author's way of thinking,
must be as alien to the furnished souls
of Cambridge as Big Dog T-shirts and
Speedos. In "S." (the title being a not
so-understandable concealment of the
protagonist's name behind a coy initial),
Updike tells the tale of a Massachusetts
housewife who loses herself in Eastern
religion and recklessly flies out West one
night to join a Buddhist sect, leaving her
stuffy bourgeois husband to fix his own
supper for the first time in 20-odd years.
Updike is fond of twists and turns like

"The fact is the Arhat is abso
lutely penniless — everything
goes into the Treasury of En
lightenment and is incorporated
or set up as a trust and he
has no idea of what comes in
and goes out ... his diamonds
are meant to symbolize for his
followers the jewel trees of the
Buddha Realm, the incredible
Land of Bliss that we meditate
upon to break down the logical
mind so nirvana can enter
in. . . ."

this, infinite spins on a single ball. Every
time he finishes one book, it seems, he
runs off and spends a year in the library
researching yet another arcane subject,
be it Barthian theology, modern
witchcraft, or as now, Eastern mysticism,
just so he can dazzle us by demonstrating
the multitude of possibilities for anthro
pological diversity in one tri-state area.
This is all fine and good, but it is also
smug — and rarely fictionally relevant.
Updike writes the novel as a series of
letters (some of them "taped," and
thereby supposedly, but not substantive
ly, different in quality from the written
epistles) by Sarah Worth — the housewife
who exchanges one Brahmin life for an
other. She also changes her name to Kun
dalini. These letters are dashed off in
varying degrees of emotional upheaval to
husband, daughter, best friend and, as
she becomes more intimate with the

sect's leader, to various antagonists
trying to strangle her Arizona desert com
mune.
Updike also plays a game of literary
charades, dropping all sorts of self
satisfied references throughout the novel
(in characters' names and so forth) to
"The Scarlet Letter." This game may
please Hawthorne aficionados, and make
some brown-nosing reviewer yelp in joy
at the author's cleverness, but it ac
complishes nothing else.
Incidentally, Updike — ever coy — in
sists in a note preceding the text that
the Guru Arhat is meant in no way to
bear any resemblance to the Bhagwan
Shree Rajneesh (late of Oregon fame).
But since this novel was probably written
with those reviewers in mind who would
praise the Swiftian wit of his incisive
satire on modern mores, the note be
comes at best a piece of lint — ineffectual

and annoying.
The smugness factor inches forward.
Updike solicitously includes, at the back
of the book, a glossary listing all the
Sanskrit terms he uses in the narrative,
which in fact may drive many readers
away before they even begin the first
paragraph. How many of us, after all,
want to be bothered with running to the
back of the book every time a confusing
term pops up (which, in some cases, is
15 times a page)?
There is the usual thematic culprit,
adultery. Updike won the Pulitzer in
1981 for "Rabbit Is Rich," the last of a
trilogy dealing with the mental contor
tions of a Joe Sixpack-type, in part for
his depiction of adultery, and he never
seems to be able to find any source of
conflict as plentiful as this.
Indeed, Updike's fiction is full of
metaphors steeped in jealousy and mari
tal intrigue, a keen example of which is
the predatory nautilus in his story, "More
Stately Mansions." ("As I diagramed on
the blackboard the spiral, ... I was
remembering how she, to arouse me in
the brightness of the big spare bedroom
at the back of her house, would softly
drag her pale-orange hair and her small
white breasts across my penis." She, of
course, is not the narrator's wife.)
To break up the monotony of this
theme, which is absent in all too few of
his writings, Updike occasionally tries to
tell the story of the teetering marriage
from the point of view of the woman. In
"The Witches of Eastwick" (1984), three
women are disappointed with the men
in their lives, so they form a coven, start
casting spells on the town, and jump in
bed with one another. "S." has a similar
subplot: Sarah plunges into a lesbian re
lationship with a woman at the com
mune.
Updike does not seem to think that it
would occur to women who are the vic
tims of philandering men to do anything
other than emasculate their partners in

revenge, a fact which does not reflect
well on his skills as a male embodier of
the female vision. Suffice it to say there
is no love lost between Updike and
feminists. This book will not ameliorate
the problem.
But some readers will find Updike's
portrayal of Sarah astonishingly sympa
thetic, a perception which will be fueled
in part by the author's stylistic talent.
Updike writes marvelously, and unlike a
majority of today's literary nabobs, he
dishes out full heapings of the smorgas
bord that is the English lexicon.
Many potential Updike addicts are
taken aback by the need to wade through
his crafted prose, however, and still
others are offended by the mannered dic
tion he invariably adopts. It has a distinct
professorial, sometimes even hectoring
tone, and when, as in "5.," he burdens
his protagonist with the same tone —
unreconstructed, without apology — the
excuse of omniscience is lost. The reader
begins to take out on the main character
the feeling that Updike is patronizing
him, what with his absorption of multi
farious philosophies and systems of
thought.
Sarah herself does not survive more
than one reading because she seems a
pointless person to try to get to know.
One begins to care less whether she finds
nirvana in her desert retreat, and one's
sympathies, unless one is something of
a self-pitying windbag, too, drift to the
unsubstantiated people to whom Sarah's
florid letters are addressed.
Perhaps Updike should concentrate on
short stories. His prose, like most
sumptuous foodstuffs, is most delicious
in small portions. Instead of spending
your money on this book, go out and buy
a used two-buck paperback edition of
"Pigeon Feathers" (1962) — and read
"Lifeguard." You'll be glad you did.
