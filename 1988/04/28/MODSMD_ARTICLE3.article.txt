# High overhead cuts into research funds
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This is the first article in a
two-part series examining the problems
posed by Stanford's ballooning research
overhead costs. Today's article outlines the
negative impact of Stanford's high over
head, or indirect, costs on its ability to
compete for federal research funds. Tomor
row's article will look at tensions between
the faculty and administration over the
issue and possible solutions offered by re
search faculty.
Stanford's ability to compete with other
universities for national research funds
may be in jeopardy.
Stanford receives more federal funds for
research and development than any other
university except MIT, according to 1988
projections quoted by University officials.
But Stanford's incredible federal cash
flow may soon be squeezed because federal
agencies are angry that almost half the
money earmarked for research is being si
phoned away by other University interests,
including administration, capital deprecia
tion, operations and maintenance, libraries
and student services.
The University's research overhead,
known as indirect costs, is growing at a
runaway rate and threatens to split the
research faculty and administration.
Direct costs are the funds necessary to
drive individual experiments.
At an April 14 Faculty Senate meeting,
University President Donald Kennedy
called indirect costs "the most arcane, dif
ficult, complex area of science policy."
But the murky costs nevertheless pack
a wallop. Indirect cost rates increased about
50 percent between 1973 and 1986 and
are projected to jump another 18 percent
on top of that over the next 10 years.
Stanford pays all research bills — direct
and indirect — from one general fund.
Then the University seeks reimbursement
for direct and indirect costs from the

federal government, which sponsors most
of the research.
The percentage of money Stanford col
lects for overhead costs is called the indirect
cost recovery rate and is negotiated by the
University and the federal government. In
essence, it is a tax rate on the research
grants the University receives.
Stanford has one of the highest indirect
cost recovery rates in the nation, 73 per
cent. The only university with a higher
projected indirect rate for 1988 than Stan
ford was Columbia by over two percentage
points, according to figures cited by the
deans' report.
As a rule, overhead costs have been
negotiated by the University after direct
costs are granted by the government.
Therefore, the funds used for the actual
research would not decline because of in
creasing indirect costs.
But now, as a consequence of the
skyrocketing indirect cost rates and a com
peting need to reduce most federal research
spending, federal agencies are deciding to
pay for indirect costs and direct research
costs in one lump sum, forcing researchers
to watch helplessly as their research dollars
are gobbled up to pay for indirect costs.
For example, the National Institutes of
Health used to pay Stanford for direct and
indirect costs separately. But this year, the
NIH joined the Department of Defense,
the Department of Energy, the National
Science Foundation and NASA — which
provide most of Stanford's research funds
— in paying for indirect and direct costs
together.
"Faculty researchers feel that they are
working harder and harder to stay in the
same place," said Electrical Engineering
Prof. Anthony Siegman, a faculty member
who has studied the problem closely. "The
system is getting closer to breaking down."
In early March, two groups published
indirect cost reports: a team made up of
deans of research, engineering, medicine
