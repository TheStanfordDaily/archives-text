## Women's golf 6th at Pac-10s 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
Six was the
magic number
for the Stanford
women's golf
team this week.
The team
took a some-

what disappointing sixth in the
Pacific 10 Conference Champi
onships at the Sahalee Country
Club in Redmond, Wash, while
senior Kay Cornelius showed
her true form, rallying on the
final day to tie for sixth indi
vidually.
The women came in with
hopes of showing that they
could play with the country's
top teams, and came away with
those hopes dashed.
Stanford shot a solid 312 yes
terday, finishing with a four
round total of 1259, but with
the rest of the second- through
sixth-place teams shooting
similarly, the Cardinal had no
chance of overcoming the 11-
stroke gap between themselves
and fifth-place Arizona.
As was expected, Arizona
State won the team champion
ship, shooting another sub-300
round (294) to finish with a
total of 1173, a whopping 57
strokes better than second
place UCLA. "It's about as fine
a tournament of golf as I've
ever seen shot in college golf,"
said' Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin.
"I think one of the main
reasons ASU has gotten so
strong with just an average
team is that they have so much
competition to qualify for each
tournament within the team
that they arrive 'tournament
tough,' " he added.
The Bruins shot 310 yester
day to finish at 1230, 14
strokes ahead of the number
three through five teams,
which were in heavy competi
tion yesterday.
Arizona, USC, and host
Washington all began yester

day within four strokes of each
other, with USC and Washing
ton tied for third. The Huskies
edged the Trojans by one swing
of the club for third, while Ar
izona was unable to make a
move, staying in fifth.
Washington shot 312 to
finish at 1244 for the tourna
ment, while USC carded 313
for a total of 1245. Arizona tied
the Huskies on the day, but
finished at 1248.
The individual leader board
changed considerably more
than the team standings did,
with the exception of ASU's
domination of the entire tour
nament. ASU captured the top
three and fifth places, while
the other spots were scattered
among the next five teams.
Sun Devil Pam Wright shot
73, holding on to the five
stroke lead she took into the
final round and winning the
individual title with a total of
288. Teammate Amy Fruh
wirth was unable to gain any
ground, shooting 74 to finish
at 294 and taking second. Pearl
Sinn completed the Sun Devil
triumverate, shooting 75 to
take third, three strokes be
hind Fruhwirth.
Washington's Nancy Kessler,
whose name did not even ap
pear on the leader board until
Tuesday, rallied with the day's
low round (72) to finish in
fourth at an even 300. ASU's
Eve-Lyne Biron faltered
slightly yesterday, shooting 79
and losing fourth place by one
stroke.
Cornelius turned in a mag
nificent 74 to tie Debbie
Koyama (82) and Valerie
Pamard (78) of UCLA for sixth
at 305.
Also rallying in the final
round was freshman Jodi
Figley, who shot 77 for a total
of 318.
Freshman Kristin Ryan and
sophomore Stephanie Parel
played solidly yesterday, shoot
ing 82 and 80, respectively, to
tie at 320.
