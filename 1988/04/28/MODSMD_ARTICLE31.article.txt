# Women's tennis on road to recovery

### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
The match score was im
pressive yesterday at the
Stanford Tennis Stadi
um, but the medical
report was even more en
couraging.
In its final home

match of the season, the Stanford worn

en's tennis team shut out U.S. Inter
national University 6-0. At the same
time, the Cardinal received some posi
tive news on the injury front.
Stanford, ranked No. 2 in the nation,
improved to 22-2. The No. 23 Gulls
dropped to 12-14.
Even with senior Cari Hagey return
ing to the lineup, the Cardinal looked
to be in trouble heading into yesterday's
match. Freshman Tami Whitlinger

(pulled muscle) and junior Eleni Ros
sides (groin injury) were not ready to
play, and freshman Teri Whitlinger was
very doubtful with a spasm in her left
quadricep. In addition, senior Kay Tittle
had taken a painkiller for her knees
and was scheduled to take a couple of
days off.
This left Stanford with five players,
meaning the Cardinal would have had
to forfeit the No. 6 singles and No. 3
doubles. But the spasm in Teri Whit
linger's leg went away overnight, and
she was able to play yesterday."It was
just a miracle that overnight she got it
going," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said.
As yesterday's match progressed, the
outlook got even better for the Cardinal.
"I went from being very depressed and
very pessimistic to picking up my atti
tude," Brennan said.
Cindy Buchsbaum got on the board
first with a 6-0, 6-1 victory in the No.
4 singles over USIU's Carol Curmi. The
win pleased both Buchsbaum and Bren
nan.
"Buchsbaum played a really good
match, which for us is a good sign be
cause we may need her," Brennan said.
If Rossides can't return to the lineup
in the next two weeks, Buchsbaum will
be the No. 6 singles player for the Car
dinal at the NCAA championships.
Buchsbaum said she is trying not to let
the uncertainty of her status bother her.
"Who knows what Eleni's going to
do? What difference does it make if I
sit and worry?" she said.
The Cardinal junior wants to be in
the lineup, but she realizes the value
that a healthy Rossides brings to the
team. "It's a tough position," she said.
"For me, I put the team first. I care
that we win. At the same time, that's
sort of a double-edged sword. If Eleni
plays, I don't."
Buchsbaum has struggled much of
the year returning from a broken col
larbone suffered prior to the dual-match
season. But she said she has improved
considerably over the past few weeks.
"I'm getting used to competing in a
match situation, playing three-all points
when it matters." she said.
Returning from a shoulder injury that
kept her out of the lineup for the better
part of three weeks, Hagey was equally
pleased with her performance yesterday.
Playing her last dual match ever at the
Stanford Tennis Stadium, the senior
swept USIU's Shabnam Siddiqi 6-4, 6-3
in the No. 5 singles, and said afterward
that she was as mentally tough as she
has been all season.
Despite playing with her left quad
ricep heavily taped, Teri Whitlinger was
also an easy winner yesterday, knocking

off Bettina Wieneke 6-1, 6-1 in
the No. 2 contest.
Freshman Sandra Birch and
sophomore Valerie Wilson also
won in straight sets. Birch (No.
3) routed Julie Laßonte 6-1, 6-1,
and Wilson (No. 6) took care of
Jodie Zinn 6-3, 6-4.
Sophomore Lisa Green was the

only Cardinal player extended to
three sets yesterday. The newly
crowned Pacific 10 Conference
singles champion was sluggish at
the beginning of the No. 1 singles
match, but she rallied for a 3-6,
6-1, 6-4 victory over Kefi
Binyamini.
"[Green] doesn't like to play
this girl (Binyamini) — doesn't
like her style, doesn't like her at
titude," Brennan said. "[GreenJ
was cranky the first five games,
but after that she played beauti
fully."
