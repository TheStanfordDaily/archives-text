All streaks are on.
Troy Paulsen ex
tended his consec
utive-game hitting
streak to 27 games
last night with a
two-for-five effort,

but it all went for naught as
No. 2 Fresno State Bulldogs ex
tended their winning streak to 29
games with a gutwrenching $-5,
10-inning victory over the Cardi
nal last night.
Senior pitcher Lee Plemdl's
wild throw past junior thfrd
baseman Ed Sprague in the bot
tom of the 10th inning on a bijnt
by Steve Hosey allowed the win
ning run to score from seccjnd
base. Stanford fell to 31-17 ovier
all.
A record FSU crowd of 5,Q21
watched the Bulldogs take a 1-0
lead against Stanford starter Mike
Mussina when first basemjan
Lance Shevelut launched a $-1
pitch deep over the right-fifeld
fence for his 26th home run of
the year, a new Pacific Coast Ath
letic Association record. It was tjhe
33rd career homer for ShevelUt,
who transfered to FSU from Stan
ford after the 1986 season. He
also had two homers in the Bull
dogs' 13-3 drubbing of the Car
dinal earlier this year.
Stanford staged a rally in tihe
third inning when sophomore des
ignated hitter Tim Griffin singled
sharply up the middle. After tjie
next two Cardinal batters flied
out harmlessly, junior fiijst
baseman Ron Witmeyer fouled Off
several full-count pitches befcjre
finally drawing a walk. Spragjue
then promptly deposited a hang
ing curveball over the wall in right
field for his Pacific 10 ConferenCe
leading 16th home run and a 3-1
Cardinal lead.

hit of the game, a shot to left
field which was trapped by soph
omore Brian Johnson. As Johnson
tried in vain to convince the of
ficials that he had made the catch,
Shevelut alertly scooted into sec
ond base. Shevelut then scored to
tie the contest when catcher Bran
don Mitchell singled up the middle
on a 3-2 count.
Both teams went down in order
in the sixth, but in the seventh
the Bulldogs nicked Keyser for
two runs on three consecutive
hits.
Shortstop Ed Zosky started
things off by singling to right.
This brought up the red-hot
Shevelut, who nailed a double into
the left field corner to score Zosky.
The next batter, Mitchell, then
doubled to left, scoring Shevelut.
Keyser averted futher trouble by
striking out DH Eddie Bus
tamante, and then gave way to
Plemel, who punched out Hosey
to end the inning.
The stubborn Cardinal bounced
buck in the eighth inning when
Johnson got his long-awaited first
home run of the year, a towering
shot past the scoreboard in left
center field. That brought on Bull
dog ace John Salles, who was

rudely greeted by Paul Carey's
sixth homer of the year. It was
only the second home run given
up all season by Salles.
Salles sent down the next three
batters in the order, but, perhaps
bolstered by the Cardinal's back
to-back dingers, Plemel set down
the Bulldog batters with hardly a
whimper in the eighth and ninth.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal
batters could do no better, and in
the bottom of the 10th Bus
tamante doubled into left center.
This brought up Hosey, who had
looked terrible striking out
against Plemel in the seventh. Al
though the Bulldogs hadn't
sacrificed in their last 25 games,
Hosey chopped a bunt down the
third-base line which was pounced
on by Plemel.
Plemel elected to go to third to
try to cut down pinch-runner Ter
rence Frazier, but his throw was
wild and the ball sailed into left
field. Third-baseman Sprague
tried to detain Frazier by lying
on top of him, but the Bulldog
speedster was able to struggle free
and streak home ahead of left
fielder Johnson's throw to the
plate.
Plemel (6-8) took the loss for
the Cardinal, while Eric Bridge,
who pitched the 10th inning for
FSU, got the win. Paulsen
doubled in the seventh and sin
gled in the ninth to extend his
streak.
