# Equine footwear lives
## 
### 
Well, the horseshoes have finally ar
rived, but the Four Vengeful Davids are
still conspicuously missing. Yes, folks,
the spring quarter intramural season is
in full swing.
After brief moments of near mutiny
due to the lack of equine footwear, the
intramural office reports calm on the
ringer front, although the Davids have
apparently chosen not to continue their
quest for vengeance against two-time
shoe champs Lambda Nu. Life will con
tinue.

And after the winter-quarter IM
points were all tallied, Biz 2 continues
to dominate the All-University compe
tition. The second year Bizzers' total of
439 points more than doubles the second
place team, Biz 1 (218 points).
A rag-tag group of 15 off-campus
sports fanatics who call themselves Ep
silon Phi continue to astound the IM
office with their third-place total of 162,
while the not-dead-yet Roble forces are
in fourth with 145. Kappa Sigma rounds
out the top five with 144 points, but
the Kappa Sigs are poised to repeat their
A league softball championship of last

year and vault into third place.
In the All Women division, Soto and
Delta Gamma far outdistance their com
petition, and in Co-ed play, the two Biz
teams and Dirk's Jerks are fighting for
the crown. All this leaves the question,
where are the once mighty Branner
women?
• • •
Alas, all is not feverish competition
this Spring, as the more relaxing games
of foosball, volleyball and even horse
shoes enter the limelight. But there is
a note of sadness in intramural land.
Rumor has it that this is Dirk's Jerks
final quarter of competition at Stanford.
The enthusiastic band of physics
graduates students are apparently
heading off into particle-smashing heav
en.
For folks who were never too keen
on losing to the relative nerds, the dis
banding of the Jerks will be a relief.
But for others, it is a time for nostalgia.
"For the last four years they have
been in the same Saturday (softball)
league with the Chicano Cubs, and we've
had a good rivalry," IM guru Charlie
Montoya said yesterday.
After many a moon in the IM office,
Montoya will also be departing at the
end of this quarter. Over the years, Mon
toya's favorite team name was the foot
ball moniker, Well Hung Jury. But the
most clever may have been the ultimate
frisbee name, You Don't Play To<Jlay.
"Hey, ump, who do we play?"


CHRIS FIALKO
"You Don't Play Today." Bingo,
another forfeit. Along those lines
was a basketball team named
With Ourselves. Take your time
figuring this one out.
Montoya's heir apparent, junior
Dave Shuey, said his favorite team
name is DNAgents. Ah, that bio

logical intrigue.
Montoya is concerned about
Shuey's political intrigues. "I'm
trying to hire a couple of demo
crats, because otherwise the IM
office will have a right-wing
slant," he said.
"Hey, we want to keep in
tramurals in a fun and relaxed
atmosphere."
Are all those biz schoolers
mean-spirited Republicans? Just
kidding.
