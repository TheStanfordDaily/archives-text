The Stanford Criterium, held on a loop
course outside of Encina Gym last Satur
day, lived up to its billing on race fliers of
"Crashes! Mayhem! excitement!" Unexpec
tedly, the Stanford Road Race, held last
Sunday on the coast near Pescadero, did
also. Despite this pandemonium Stanford
pulled off a team victory on Saturday.
Gloomy skies overhead threatened rain
throughout Saturday's criteriums, but the
prayers of the race organizers were an
swered and no rain fell after the races had
begun. However, the dry pavement could
not make up for the tightness of the corners
on the 0.6-mile course and several nasty
crashes were the result.
In the men's A criterium a rare crash
occurred, but no one was seriously injured.
The Cardinal's John Coyle, a sophomore,
missed the spill and went on to contest a

close-field sprint and win a dramatic victoijy
in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Graduate
student Brock LaPorte, who had been
the bottom of the earlier pile-up, scorcjd
an amazing third place. Freshman Coultqr
Richardson captured several prime points
and finished ninth overall. Junior Steve
Miller also contributed points, winning ap
early prime.
Alumna Pam Stevenson awed the crowjd
by scoring an almost perfect 46 out of a
possible 48 points in the women's racf,
the only "crashless" race, and taking thje
final sprint by a commanding margit).
Senior Alex Weiher also did well, finishing
in 10th.
The men's B race also went well for
Stanford. Fifth-year senior Dave Ix>udefi
pulled out his trademark sprint to finis|i
second overall. Senior Bob Borchers scored
handily in several primes and
then chugged across the line in
10th place, an especially impres
sive placing considering that he
had collided with an airborne
bicycle in the final corner of the

race. Junior Hank Dart also did
well for Stanford, grabbing
several points in a prime.
Sunday's challenging, hilly road
race was marred by several vicious
crashes. In the A race the only
Cardinal rider to survive the wipe
outs was graduate student Mike
Fadich, who finished sixth overall.
