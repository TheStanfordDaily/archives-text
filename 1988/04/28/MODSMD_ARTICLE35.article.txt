# Coaches, past Olympian agree
## Gymnasts should take NCAA route to Seoul 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Before last week's NCAA Men's
Gymnastics Championships in
Lincoln, Neb., Nebraska Coach
Francis Allen, who has guided his
program to six championships and
three second-place finishes in the
last 10 years, predicted that at
l6ast five of the eight members
of this summer's U.S. Olympic
Team would be from this season's
NCAA field.
■ That number could easily have
been as high as six, seven, or per
haps even all eight, say some gym
nastics insiders, if it weren't for
ttie misguided idealism of a num
ber of college-age gymnasts who
have chosen to drop out of school
aijcl train full-time for the 1988
Olympic Games in Seoul, South
Kfrrea.
IjWhat's more, according to one
1984 Olympian and two of the
nation's most respected coaches,
by leaving school to concentrate
"Sepuly" on the Olympics, a num
ber of ex-collegians have put
themselves in a double-negative
situation: They have not only

taken a nuyor risk with their fu
ture; they also have not improved
their chances to make the U.S.
team in the process.
"They've lost everything; there
are no guarantees out there," Ar
izona State Coach Don Robinson
said. "They throw away two years
of school, all their NCAA compe
tition with the possibility of great
care and a degree. .. . They put
all their eggs into one basket.. ..
It's a chance they should not have
taken."
Robinson's Sun Devils won the
NCAA title in 1986. Twin broth
ers Dennis and Dan Hayden were
the heart and soul of that team.
Only sophomores, the Haydens
were clearly on their way to
history-making college careers,
but both dropped out of school.
Dan Hayden has been fairly
successful in international com
petition, yet whether he makes
the Olympic team is dependent
on his performance in a single
meet. Neither aggregate excel
lence over the past four years nor
sharpness of focus on the Olym
pics has any direct influence on
who makes the final squad of six

competitors and two alternates.
Brian Ginsberg is another ex
ample. Ginsberg, a sophomore on
UCLA's fourth-place team in
1986, took second to Stanford's
Jon Louis in the individual all
around competition. He, too, left
school. The Bruins were not badly
hurt: They went on to win the
1987 title and they finished third
this year. UCLA Coach Art Shur
lock thinks Ginsberg, though,
made a serious mistake.
"He's losing his college educa
tion, and at the same time he
doesn't have the intensity of
training that the college athlete
gets," Shurlock said. "It was a
really poor move on his part. Kids
get idealistic and they think
they'll go off and train and all
they'll concentrate on is the
Olympics, but you just lose the
intensity of the team situation."
The gymnastics careers of Tim
Daggett, Mitch Gaylord and Peter
Vidmar prove Shurlock's point.
Vidmar won the 1982 and 1983
NCAA all-around titles. Gaylord
won the 1984 title. Daggett won
three event titles in 1984. All were
UCLA Bruins, and all succeeded
in making the 1984 U.S. Olympics
team and in winning gold medals
in Los Angeles.
Daggett is a contender for an
1988 Olympic berth. Under the
auspices of an assistant coaching
job with the Bruins, Daggett is
training ruthlessly for August's
Olympic Trials. Between compe
tition sessions at last week's
NCAAs, Daggett was busy train
ing, but took a couple minutes
out to subtly criticize those who
had quit school for Olympic goals.
Daggett said these goals could be
reached just as effectively within
the NCAA system.
"It makes it a little easier to
train outside of school because
you don't have the pressure (of
classes)," Daggett said. "But to
make the Olympics you just have
to work really hard; there's no
easy way."
Daggett's schedule exemplifies
the hard-work ethic he thinks is
mandatory. He gets up at 6 a.m.
every day for his first training
session, despite the fact that he

has "nothing else to do." To Dag
gett, anybody striving to succeed
in the pressure-filled world of elite
gymnastics should find studying
for exams only a minor annoy
ance.
Certainly, exams are a minor
annoyance compared to how these
gymnasts will feel if they don't
succeed. Saturday at the
McDonald's Cup Soviet-U.S. dual
meet, for example, the Soviets
decimated the Americans. If the
U.S. is to be competitive in Seoul,
it will need more than just deter
mination; it will need some luck.
That's what those who have
dropped out of school are gam
bling on.
For in one short September
week, only the six competing U.S.
gymnasts will have an opportu
nity to live up to their Olympic
dreams. If the international meets
of the past few years are any in
dication, they may well come up
short. And even if they don't, the
inevitable question will be, "What
now?"
Daggett, Robinson and Shur
lock believe that if they haven't
already, those who dropped out
of college to concentrate on having
a chance to be a part of this one
meet will regret the day they
made this decision as soon as the
Olympics are over.
"I think, in retrospect, they will
probably say 'Well, that wasn't
the way to go,' " Shurlock said.
