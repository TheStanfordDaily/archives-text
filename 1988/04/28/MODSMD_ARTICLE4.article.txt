# U.S. Department of Energy renews SLAC contract
## 
### Andrea Kohn 
After a seven-month delay,
Stanford and the U.S. Depart
ment of Energy yesterday signed
a five-year contract renewing
Stanford's complete control of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter.
Although the 26-year-old ac
celerator facility is located on
Stanford land, it is owned and
financed by the government.
Every five years the Energy De
partment decides whether to ex
tend its contract with the Univer
sity or to let outsiders bid for
control of the facility.

Although the old contract ex
pired Sept. 30, 1987, the contract
was only signed yesterday because
Stanford and the Energy Depart
ment had difficulty agreeing on
patent and copyright provisions
in the new contract.
According to SLAC Director
Burton Richter, Stanford sought
to increase its control over
copyrights, patents and other "in
tellectual properties" that arise
from SLAC research. "Stanford
always wants to improve [the con
tract with the government] in the
sense that we want what we feel
belongs to us," Richter said.
After seven months of negotia

tion, the two parties reached a
"compromise" agreement, Richter
said. SLAC officials declined to
comment on the specifics of the
agreement. "They got some of the
things they wanted, and we got
some of the things we wanted,"
Richter said.
In return for complete control
of the facility, Stanford charges
the government $1 per year to
lease the 450-acre Sli\C site.
The continuing agreement be
tween Stanford and the Energy
Department dates back to 1962.
According to Richter, a group of
Stanford faculty members pro
posed the building of SLAC in

order to facilitate research in high
energy physics. "Stanford was the
world's leader in that kind of ma
chinery," Richter said.
The Energy Department con
tinues to invest in SLAC because
the work done there is "consistent
with [the government's! mission
in basic energy research," said
Jim Hirahara, a director of con
tracts for the Energy Department.
Current SLAC research seeks
to better determine the forces that
bind matter, Hirahara said. The
facility, which is funded by the
Energy Department at a cost of
$115 million per year, consists of
a two-mile long linear accelerator

'They got some of the
things they wanted,
and we got some of
the things we wanted.'

and several beam colliders.
Former SLAC director
Wolfgang Panofsky stressed the
long-term importance of the re
search at SLAC. Although he
conceded that the practical uses
of current experiments will not

be known for decades, Panofsky
said the work at SLAC provides
a "knowledge base on which tax
payers can draw."
In part because there is only
one other facility comparable to
SLAC in the United States, Rich
ter said, the accelerator is in al
most constant use. "There is a
great deal of competition for run
ning time," he said.
Over 50 universities would like
to do high energy research in the
United States, Richter said. Cur
rently, 650 scientists from 57 U.S.
universities and eight foreign
countries use the facility, Richter
said.
