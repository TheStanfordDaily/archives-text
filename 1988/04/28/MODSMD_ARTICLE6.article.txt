# SIDO sponsors S. African textbook
## Black education currently limited to 'sewing and janitorial tasks' 
### Sherrell Evans Staff writer 
Despite a U.S. ban on shipment of
books to South Africa, the Stanford In
ternational Development Organization
has begun a drive to sponsor production
of a textbook to promote political aware
ness among black South African school
teachers.
Members of SIDO decided last Tues
day to sponsor the South African Ed
ucational Outreach Project, an effort to

finance the writing and publication of
an instruction manual for black teach
ers' colleges in South Africa.
The textbook project may prove con
troversial because it will violate the ban,
which was imposed on South Africa by
U.S. publishers in the early 19705.
"There are good and bad things about
the book ban," SIDO member Hanna
Rosin said. "It makes a good statement,
but it also leaves the people of South
Africa in the dark."
SIDO is the Stanford branch of the

Overseas Development Network, a na
tional consortium of college groups or
ganized to aid Third World develop
ment. ODN's West Coast headquarters
are located at Stanford.
A total of $10,000 is needed to
produce the textbook, which will ad
dress South African history and culture,
critical education and awareness, ac
cording to Rosin.
Half of the $3,600 in proceeds from
an all-campus fast held by SIDO
last fall will go toward funding
the manual. The remaining
$1,800 will be contributed to Ox
fam America, a national organi
zation which works against the
world hunger problem.
On Monday, SIDO sent out let
ters to several dorms on campus
inviting them to join in fund
raising efforts for the manual.
The group is also planning a free
concert Saturday featuring the
South African band "Zulu
Spears;" proceeds from donations
at the concert will be used to help
fund the project.
The textbook project was orig
inally suggested to ODN by two
South African professors. "It's a
very grass roots project in the
sense in that it comes from the
black South Africans themselves,"
said junior Sarabjit Baveja, a
SIDO member. "It's not any de
velopment agency or us telling
them what they need, but a need

that they have (recognized) them
selves," he said.
Although SIDO will finance the
project, the textbook will be writ
ten by U.S. and South African
scholars around the United States
and in South Africa. American or
ganizers say they hope to com
plete an American draft of the
textbook by the end of this sum
mer. The draft will then be sent
to South Africa for revision.
Rosin said the new textbook is
necessary because the advance
ment of black South Africans is
limited by the inadequacies of
their education system.
The "Bantu" system, imposed
on blacks by the government,
"teaches you that the white people
are your masters," Rosin said. "It
distorts the history of South
Africa."
She criticized the Bantu system
for restricting education of blacks
to subjects such as sewing and
janitorial tasks.
SIDO member Smita Singh said
she is not certain that the
textbook project will have an ef
fect on South Africa's apartheid
system, but she said she believes
empowering black South Africans

through education is crucial to
ending apartheid. SIDO's book
project is meant to aid that edu
cational process, she said.
SI DO hopes to hold a series of
debates in dorms this spring on
whether or not Stanford should
become involved in trying to
reform the South African educa
tion system.
"They (the debaters) will be
debating whether or not showing
teachers how to educate independ
ently of how the government says
will affect the political conscious
ness of the black students," said
SIDO member Caroline Lim. "If
it does, how much will that
change the political structure, and
if it does or does not, should SIDO
be involved in this?" she asked.
