Come on listen to my story of a rabbit named
Blnk, Star of Life In Hell, a strip that makes you
think. Well one day Bink was feelin' kinda low, t
So he came up wth the plan to make some
dough. Merchandising that Is. Fun garb. Comfy
T's Well the first thing you know the shirts
began to sell. Bink's kinfolk said: "This alnt so
bad for Helll" They said: "Hooray for Callfomy
and all Its glam and glossl" So Binky paid his
rent and he stayed right there In Los. Angeles,
that is. Swimming pools. Obscure cartoonists.
