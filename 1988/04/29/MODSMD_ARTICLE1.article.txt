# Equestrians face eviction
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
Although the father of one of
the Stanford Equestrian Team's
members raised close to $50,000
for the construction of a new barn
at the Stanford stables, the team
may be forced to move out of the
barn because it is having trouble
paying the rent.
The team, which operates as a
club sport here and receives min
imal funding from the Athletics
Department, has housed its two
horses in the barn since its con
struction in February.
Barn manager Sara Saxe, who
leases the stables from the Uni
versity and operates them private
ly, was given a lease for the new
barn and runs it as her own. If
the team were forced to leave,
Saxe would retain the use of these
stables.
Although, the team has four
stables reserved for its use, it
must continue to pay rent to
remain there.
Saxe said she offers the
monthly $295-per-horse board
rates to the team at only a few

dollars above what it costs her to
maintain those stables.
Saxe said she doesn't make
much money from the other 11
boarders at the barn, each of
whom pay about $310 per month
per horse. Saxe added that the
cost of maintaining the new barn
is so high that she makes little
money at all managing it.
Team Vice President and junior
Sharon Larson said if the team
is unable to raise enough money
to pay for its rents, it may have
to move its horses to locations off
campus.
Team President Gwyn Gordon
said that, as "a last resort" the
team may even consider selling
them.
Currently, the team leases and
rides horses at a ranch in Portola
Valley in addition to using its own
horses at Stanford.
Gordon, who said the team
plans to work with Saxe in order
to raise additional funds for the
rent, added that it was "unfortu
nate" that the board rates can't
be reduced. With rents as they
are, staying at Stanford would "be
difficult to do," Gordon said, add

ing that the team's "main chal
lenge is to stay solvent."
However, the team's fund
raising efforts have drawn
criticism from Asst. Athletic Di
rector Shirley Schoof, who is also
the director of Club Sports here.
"The team is not working as
hard" as it should be to raise
funds, she said.
Schoof said the Athletic Depart
ment's policy is to allocate a cer
tain amount of funds for each
club sport. Beyond that, each club
must raise its own money.
Although Gordon said the team
has been trying to raise funds,
she added that the team plans to
increase its fund-raising activities.
"I hope that Shirley doesn't think
we're trying to get more funds
from Club Sports," Gordon said.
Saxe said she has already of
fered the team several ways in
which it could work to reduce the
fees. For example, the team leases
one of its horses for Saxe's riding
school in order to reduce its rents.

because Saxe has the lease on the
barn and the right to run her
business as she likes as long as
she doesn't violate the terms of
