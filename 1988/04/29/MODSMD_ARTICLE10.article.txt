WASHINGTON â€” The Senate yesterday
virtually wiped out any chance that the
May 4 amnesty deadline for illegal aliens
will be extended.
In a procedural vote, senators voted 56-
40 against limiting debate by opponents of
a House-passed bill to extend until Nov.
30 the deadline for applying for legal
residency. The vote was viewed as a test,
with the majority opposing the extension.
Some opponents of the extension likely
would have filibustered the measure.
Following the vote, Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., co-author of the 1986 immigration
law containing the amnesty program, said
the Senate had just "sent a signal" that
the one-year legalization program will end
at midnight on Wednesday, as scheduled.
I he Senate will be in recess next week,
so there seems no chance to get an exten
sion approved before the program expires.
Indeed, after the lopsided vote, Charles
Kamasaki of the National Council of La
Raza, leader of the battle for an extension,
said: "We just went down. The bill is dead.
There will be no attempt to revive it."
Kamasaki blamed the bill's defeat on

Senate leaders, saying they had not been
aggressive in pushing the legislation.
The legalization program is open to
people who have lived illegally in this coun
try since before 1982, except for brief ab
sences.
Supporters of an extension have argued
that the INS had failed until recently to
fully inform the public about the program,
resulting in a shortfall of applicants. INS
denied this and opposed the extension as
simply an encouragement to procras
tinators.
In debate before the procedural vote,
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., arguing
for the extension, said: "Congress enacted
the amnesty program in good faith, and
we should not implement it in bad faith.
The simple truth is the May 4 deadline
has turned out to be too short and too
harsh."
But Simpson said, "This is it. And if you
want to live the dream, here's your chance.
And you do it by midnight May 4, and
that's it. And it will never come again, and
you know it will never come again."
