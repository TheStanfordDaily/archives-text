# Noriega, U.S. make agreement on ouster
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The
Reagan administration and
Panamanian General Manuel
Noriega have agreed on "the
outlines of a deal" under which
Noriega would give up power,
but stay in Panama for a face
saving interval and escape ex
tradition to the United States,
senior administration officials
said yesterday.
The compromise, negotiated
after months of U.S. economic
pressure on Noriega's regime,
would allow Noriega to make
what one official called "a dig
nified exit" while achieving the
administration's aim of ousting
the military chief from power.
It would also represent a sig
nificant retreat for the admin
istration from its initial
demand that Noriega leave of
fice immediately. The Panama
nian dictator lias been indicted
on drug trafficking charges by
two federal grand juries.
A senior U.S. official warned,
however, that the deal has not
yet been sealed.

"There are the outlines of a
deal, but only if each side
makes some decisions that
would be a part of it,"the of
ficial said.
"There is not yet an agree
ment in principle. There are
some significant decisions that
the president and (Secretary of
State George Shultz) need to
make.
He said reports that Noriega
has already agreed to go into
exile in the Dominican Repub
lic were premature.
"The question of where he
would go is completely un
settled," the official said.
The proposed deal also calls
for the United States to forgo
pursuing the outstanding drug
trafficking charges, officials
said. Shultz has suggested that
Reagan consider dropping the
indictments against Noriega —
or, at least, making a pledge
not to pursue his extradition
— as the price of the dictator's
exit from Panama.
