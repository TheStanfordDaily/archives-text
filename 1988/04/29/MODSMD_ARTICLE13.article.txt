# Iran-Contra trial postponed
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” New guidelines laid
down yesterday in response to complaints
by defense lawyers seeking access to
300,000 classified documents made it
doubtful that the Iran-Contra arms trial
will start before the November presidential
election.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell
issued the guidelines after hearing a
lengthy report by independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh, who said that many of
the secret documents were irrelevant to
the trial and so sensitive that they could
expose people who saw them "to torture
and death."
Walsh indicated that he would resist at
tempts by all four defendants or their
lawyers to review the mass of data. The
judge agreed with Walsh after defense at
torneys were unable to settle on a proce
dure for reviewing them informally.
Gesell, who a day earlier had criticized
Reagan administration officials for their
slow pace in clearing the classified govern
ment files for review by the defendants,
said yesterday that he appreciated that
Walsh had certain "national security
obligations."
"As far as I'm concerned, they have no
right to fish through these records," Gesell
said of the defendants and their lawyers.
But to ensure that all useful and relevant
documents are ready for the trial, Gesell
said defense attorneys should file formal
requests by May 16, describing the types

of government files they wish to examine.
Brendan Gullivan Jr., the attorney for
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, told Gesell
that "my problem is I cannot agree that
something is totally outside the case unless
I see it."
The new procedure for seeking "dis
covery materials" seemed to foreclose the
chance of starting the trial by July, as
Gesell had previously planned.
Defense requests for discovery tradition
ally lead to time-consuming battles over
what specific documents will be furnished
to defendants, according to legal experts,
especially in light of Walsh's statements
about the extreme sensitivity of some of
the records. In addition, two attorneys said
they were having serious problems inter
viewing potential witnesses.
Gesell has estimated that if he cannot
start what is expected to be a long trial
by mid-summer, it will have to be
postponed until after the November elec
tion. That is because he has ruled out any
testimony during the campaign, saying he
wants to keep the trial and the political
race from having any effect on each other.
The judge also is asking for more pretrial
legal arguments involving defense claims
that Walsh's office may have improperly
used parts of some defendants' immunized
testimony before Congress last year to
build a case against them.
