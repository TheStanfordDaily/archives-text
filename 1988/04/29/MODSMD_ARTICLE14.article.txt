Senate approves AIDS bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate, caught up
in an emotional debate over the government's
role in combating AIDS, yesterday approved
a proposal that bars federal funds from pre
vention programs that "promote" homosexual
behavior.
The proposal, one of several amendments
tacked onto a bill authorizing $685 million for
AIDS research and education, was approved
on a 77-23 vote. The Senate approved the
overall legislation on a 87-4 vote.
Earlier yesterday, the Senate approved
amendments calling for mandatory AIDS test
ing for all people convicted of drug- and sex
related crimes and banned programs giving
clean needles to drug addicts to combat the
spread of AIDS without the approval of the
surgeon general.
It also backed a provision barring states
from accepting federal AIDS funds if they pass
laws that prevent physicians of patients who
test positive for antibodies to the virus from
notifying spouses without the patient's explicit
permission.
Senators clashed angrily over the proposals
during a debate that focused on the federal
government's responsibilities to combat the
AIDS virus. Most of the battle came over the
proposal by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to with
hold funds from programs that "promote or
condone" homosexual behavior. The Senate
approved an identical provision last year.
But critics, like Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-
Mass., said Helms' amendment would bring a
halt to badly needed AIDS education programs
across the country.
INF treaty may be stalled
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion, in a move that could complicate Senate
approval of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces (INF) treaty, has complained that So
viet officials are backing away from several
agreed procedures for verifying compliance
with the pact.
Officials of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
protested to senior Soviet foreign ministry of
ficials yesterday that two positions recently
taken by ranking Soviet officials on the pact's
verification are contradicted by the terms of
the agreement and a record of the negotiations
that produced it.
The dispute concerns issues described bv a
State Department official as "technical, but
important" to ensuring that both nations have
equal rights to inspect sensitive military
facilities associated with the weapons banned
by the pact, which President Reagan and So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed last De
cember.
