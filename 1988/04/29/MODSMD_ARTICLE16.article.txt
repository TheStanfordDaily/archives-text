## Fight alcohol's ills 
### 
Efforts by both Coweii
Student Health Center and
Residential Education to
combat the problem of alcohol
abuse, in recognizing its complex
ity, are commendable.
In its approach toward alcohol,
Stanford has traditionally stressed
the importance of treating stu
dents as responsible adults. Be
cause Stanford has recognized that
alcohol abuse is rooted in social
and cultural conditions, it has
developed some very successful
ways of addressing the problem.
One example of a very creative
educational effort was the April 21
program in Toyon. Cowell Student
Health Center and Stanford Police
teamed up to demonstrate alco
hol's health and legal implications.
Officials supervised a few test stu
dents while they drank. Then, an
officer demonstrated the short
term physical effects of liquor and
explained the law as it pertains to
drunk driving. Students attended
the program, watched and learned.
Another important step in this
direction is the Alcohol Education
Project sponsored by Cowell's
Health Promotion department.
Its goal is to make abstinence
and minimal drinking at parties
an accepted norm among students
and develop an alcohol risk ap
praisal tool that could serve to il
luminate the relation between risk
and level of consumption.
Through measures such as this,
the University is showing that it
is truly committed to combating
alcohol by streamlining its attack

through all possible facets of the
problem.
Stanford's Residential Educa
tion program recognizes that it
needs to take a sophisticated ap
proach in the prevention of alcohol
abuse. It does not act in a pater
nalistic way.
Strict prohibition for underage
students simply does not work:
People who want alcohol can al
ways get alcohol.
Instead, Stanford has a more re
alistic and more effective approach.
Indeed, the physiological dan
gers of alcohol cannot and should
not be ignored. Scientific data
proves that excessive alcohol con
sumption damages the liver, the
stomach and other organs of the
human body.
It also increases the risk of heart
attack, reduces the testosterone
levels, interferes with the female
menstrual cycle and weakens the
body's immune system.
But to focus on alcohol's physical
effects is insufficient. It is not hard
to convince most students that
drinking does have negative phys
ical effects: Most have either had
a hangover themselves or seen
other people have one.
Res Ed and Cowell, in order to
confront the issue of heavy drink
ing more effectively, have recog
nized the need to place more em
phasis on the social and psycho
logical sources of alcoholism. It's
good that they work as a team,
and the cooperation of the police
demonstrates the appeal their ap
proach has had.
