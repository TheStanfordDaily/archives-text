## Minority groups need to recognize own prejudices 
### 
I FOUND David Chan-oong Kang's
April 20 letter on the hypocrisy of
minority groups interesting. Al
though I do not consider myself a
member of any traditionally recognized
minority, I support his views.
Having received my bachelor's degree
from a "large, public midwestern uni
versity" and having spent nearly all
my life in the east and midwest, I am
favorably impressed by the relative
openess with which "minorities" (I
really dislike that word) are "accepted"
into the "mainstream." (I'm sure to be
labeled a racist for that statement.)
However, I am bewildered by the
constant use of the "-ism words." Can
everything here be that black and
white? (No pun intended.) Is every
single comment or issue either "racist"

or "anti-racist"? Is there no mutual
understanding of the discrepancies
between meanings "as intended" and
meanings "as interpreted"?
As a white male, I have a unique
view of minorities. As an undergradu
ate, I joined the Society of Women
Engineers — an almost entirely female
organization fighting for women's
acceptance into the male-dominated
world of engineering.
Within this organization, I was
technically a minority. The surprising
thing was I felt no more accepted by
them than they felt by male engineers.
This anti-sexist organization was guilty
of supporting (in reverse) the exact
same closed-mindedness that they were
fighting against.

I will admit there were peculiar
circumstances surrounding my affilia
tion with SWE and I can understand
— although I certainly cannot justify
— their reaction. But that's my point!
While I tried to be understanding
about their attitude, they just blew me
off. Is that really conducive to change?
I keep mentioning ''understanding"
because I feel it is the key to any
meaningful change in minority affairs.
Without mutual understanding, there
can be no equality.
But, it seems to me — sad as it may
be — prejudice, in the general sense, is
an inescapable part of human nature.
This places a disproportionate amount
of the responsibility for understanding
on minority groups because they must

appear to be unprejudiced. (One's own
prejudices implies justification for
another's.)
I am not implying that minority
groups should be less active or vocal,
but that they have a greater responsi
bility to carefully choose their actions
and words.
Change occurs in one of two ways:
revolution or evolution. Revolution is
good only if you don't have to live
together tomorrow. Evolution will not
happen without mutual understanding.
Understanding is generally developed
only by the careful guidance of those
who are misunderstood.
