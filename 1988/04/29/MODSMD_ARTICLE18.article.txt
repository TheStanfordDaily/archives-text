# Carnival deserved coverage by Daily
## 
### 
On Saturday, April 23, a very special
event took place here. This was a day
of community fun and community
awareness organized and implemented
by a dedicated committee of students
together with over 40 dorms and
campus groups.
The event was enjoyed by well over
a thousand people, including families
from Palo Alto and East Palo Alto,
Stanford faculty and staff and their
families, Stanford students and even
the visiting Soviet students from
Novosibirsk University.
Yet come Monday, mention of this
event was noticeably absent from the
pages of The Daily. Despite its large
attendance and the large number of
Stanford students involved, The Daily
chose not to cover the event and, in
fact, completely ignored it in Monday's
paper.

The event to which I refer is the
Stanford Community Carnival, and I
am writing this letter to express my
anger toward The Daily for its failure
as this community's newspaper to pro
vide fair coverage to an event which is
most certainly an effort for and by the
whole of the community.
The purpose of the Stanford Car
nival is to strengthen ties between
Stanford, Palo Alto and East Palo Alto
in order to encourage community
awareness and involvement.
With its focus on children in nearby
areas, particularly East Palo Alto, the
Carnival furthermore seeks to promote
awareness of the East Palo Alto Stan
ford Summer Academy, or EPASSA, an
academic enrichment program
developed for junior high students in
the Ravenswood School District of East
Palo Alto.
These goals, together with the tre
mendous student involvement, not only
make the Carnival worthy of news
coverage, but also make this scrt of

publicity imperative in order to achieve
the sort of awareness we hope to
create.
By not giving the Carnival the cover
age it deserved, The Daily was nothing
less than insensitive toward the com
munity which it serves and the greater
community of which it is also a part.
As it turns out, the Carnival itself
was a huge success. Many facets of the
Stanford community joined in organiz
ing games for the children, including
groups ranging from the Law School
Association to the Asian-American Stu
dent Association to those "can't keep
'em down" Roble Refugees.
In addition, creativity abounded this
year with games like Soto's paper
airplane toss and the very popular
"Tactile Maze" constructed and run by
the residents of Faisan.
These activities, together with a
dunk tank, highstriker, merry-go
round, moonwalk and 250 free bag
lunches, made for an unforgettable day
of fun for the community.
Four full bus loads of children, not

to mention many Stanford families and
students, were filled with smiles and
laughter, and when the day was
through the Carnival had raised over
$2,100 to help the EPASSA with its
efforts.
Many students dedicated themselves
to make this event the success that it
was, and The Daily's neglect in not
acknowledging their efforts also serves
as a discredit to these people.
For all the time and energy which
they devoted, the members of the Car
nival committee, in particular the
booth coordinators Suzanne Rehmus
and Lydia Sandoval, deserve much
credit.
In the future, I hope that The Daily
will prove a bit more sensitive to the
students and the community which it
serves. The Daily needs to show that it
is responsive, in particular to those
events meant to involve as well as
benefit the whole of the community.
