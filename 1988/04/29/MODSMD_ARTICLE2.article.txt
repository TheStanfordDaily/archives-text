# Police will bring more charges of computer theft
## 
### Erin Martin Editorial staff 
After two weeks of tracking
down computers allegedly
stolen in a six-month-long
scam at the Stanford Book
store, police say they will con
clude their investigation next
week and levy more charges
against the Stanford senior
suspected of committing the
crimes.
Jose Fernandez, 23, was ar
rested April 14 as he allegedly
tried to smuggle textbooks out
of the store in a garbage bin.
He was later charged with one
count of burglary and two
counts of larceny and stands
accused of stealing more than
$60,000 in computers and
other merchandise from the
bookstore.
Police have spent the weeks
since the arrest searching for
some 20 computers Fernandez
allegedly resold to customers
unaware the property was
stolen. According to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer,
the investigation has yielded
two more computers, bringing
the total of recovered systems
to 12.
Police, who expect to trace a
number of additional systems
this week, will file formal
charges with the Santa Clara
County district attorney pend

ing completion of their inves
tigation.
For each computer that Fer
nandez is accused of stealing,
police will press seperate
charges.
According to Niemeyer, Fer
nandez kept extensive records
of the stolen computers and
their subsequent resale, ena
bling police to easily locate the
merchandise. Located buyers
of the contraband, who are ab
solved from all legal responsi
bility as a result of a temporary
amnesty period, include a
Santa Cruz lawyer and a busi
nessman from Ben Lomond,
Calif.
However, the special am
nesty period granted by the
police did not yield any volun
tary return of merchandise or
further information on the
case.
Niemeyer, who said that of
ficials had expected some stu
dents might come forward with
property received illegally from
Fernandez, said the former
president of the Theta Xi fra
ternity advertised the comput
ers in the San Jose Mercury
News and may have specifically
targeted off-campus buyers.
Fernandez's legal counsel,
Palo Alto attorney John Kah
ners, said it is "too difficult"
to comment on the case since it
is still being investigated.
Further legal action against
Fernandez will originate in the
district attorney's office, which
must decide if police charges
against Fernandez warrant pros
ecution.
Niemeyer said authorities are
"being flexible" about the am
nesty period, which will continue
for a short period of time, but
after its end, individuals found
with the merchandise may be held
responsible for having and receiv
ing stolen goods.
D.A. Lance Beizer refused to
speculate about the case since his

office has not received the police
report.
However, Beizer criticized com
ments made by University Judi
cial Affairs Officer Sally Cole in
dicating that Fernandez — in the
event he is found guilty of the
charges — is not likely to be ex
pelled from Stanford.
"I find that bizarre," said
Beizer, who said he feared the
University hesitated to "step on
the toes" of its students at the
expense of the surrounding com
munity.
Cole was unavailable for com
ment yesterday.
A press representative from the
Bookstore said it is "too early" to
say if the Bookstore will press
civil charges against Fernandez,
who was an employee of the store
for nearly three years.
