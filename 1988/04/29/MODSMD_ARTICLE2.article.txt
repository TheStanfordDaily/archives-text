After two weeks of tracking
down computers allegedly
stolen in a six-month-long
scam at the Stanford Book
store, police say they will con
clude their investigation next
week and levy more charges
against the Stanford senior
suspected of committing the
crimes.
Jose Fernandez, 23, was ar
rested April 14 as he allegedly
tried to smuggle textbooks out
of the store in a garbage bin.
He was later charged with one
count of burglary and two
counts of larceny and stands
accused of stealing more than
$60,000 in computers and
other merchandise from the
bookstore.
Police have spent the weeks
since the arrest searching for
some 20 computers Fernandez
allegedly resold to customers
unaware the property was
stolen. According to Stanford
Police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer,
the investigation has yielded
two more computers, bringing
the total of recovered systems
to 12.
Police, who expect to trace a
number of additional systems
this week, will file formal
charges with the Santa Clara
County district attorney pend

ing completion of their inves
tigation.
For each computer that Fer
nandez is accused of stealing,
police will press seperate
charges.
According to Niemeyer, Fer
nandez kept extensive records
of the stolen computers and
their subsequent resale, ena
bling police to easily locate the
merchandise. Located buyers
of the contraband, who are ab
solved from all legal responsi
bility as a result of a temporary
amnesty period, include a
Santa Cruz lawyer and a busi
nessman from Ben Lomond,
Calif.
However, the special am
nesty period granted by the
police did not yield any volun
tary return of merchandise or
further information on the
case.
Niemeyer, who said that of
ficials had expected some stu
dents might come forward with
property received illegally from
Fernandez, said the former
president of the Theta Xi fra
ternity advertised the comput
ers in the San Jose Mercury
News and may have specifically
targeted off-campus buyers.
Fernandez's legal counsel,
Palo Alto attorney John Kah
ners, said it is "too difficult"
