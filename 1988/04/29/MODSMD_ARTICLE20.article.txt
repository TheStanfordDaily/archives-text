## It's Campbell by default

SINCE THE DAY I turned 18, I've
been a registered Democrat. Now,
and for the next 40 days only, I am
a registered Republican.
Why? To get rid of Ernie Konnyu.
Your congressman and mine, Rep.
Ernest L. Konnyu (R-Saratoga) is a con
summate embarrassment to the 12th
Congressional District. His neanderthal
voting record alone shows he is not rep
resentative of the moderate (though
solidly) Republican 12th.
Earlier this month, to cite just one
example, he voted against the Civil Rights
Restoration Act, and then voted to sus
tain Reagan's veto on the bill.
Konnyu is still in hot water due to
some allegations that he sexually har
rassed two female staff members (who
were later fired) and a top E.F. Hutton
lobbyist.
Konnyu even dubbed Coca-Cola "Pinko
Commie Juice" and banned it from his
office, all simply because it's sold in the
People's Republic of China. (Word has it
that his next targets are the fellow
traveler red subversives at Kentucky
Fried Chicken.)
The mode at Konnyu's offices has bas
ically been fixed to Damage Control for
his entire tenure, due to these and other
bloopers. Shortly after the juicy stories
on sexual harrassment appeared in the
national press, Konnyu's blue "Con
stituent Newsletters," which we all pay
tax dollars to receive, suddenly began
stressing the Congressman's new-found
devotion to women's issues.
Ernie's so awful that GOP magnates
David Packard, William Hewlett, former

Rep. Ed Zschau and others have actually
deserted him. Ditching an incumbent is
practically unheard of, to say the least.
But Konnyu really is that bad.
Democrats and Republicans agree,
then, on one thing: The top priority of
all voters must be to dump Konnyu.
The question is, what's the best way
to do it?
Keep in mind that the 12th District
was gerrymandered in 1980 so as to be
a lock for the GOP. The Democratic state
legislature, when redrawing district
boundaries after the '80 census, lumped
all the area Republicans, from eastern
Santa Cruz county to Gilroy, into one
sprawling district.
That way, of course, all the surround
ing districts became safe Democratic
havens. But make no mistake: this ger
rymander made the 12th a GOP district
for federal elections.
Democratic zealots will contradict me,
citing the fact that the 12th is registered
as 43 percent Democratic, 43 percent Re
publican. But any district with figures
like that will always go GOP.
Heck, all California is heavily Demo
cratic, 51 percent to 36 percent, but has
gone for the Republican presidential can
didate in each of the last five elections.
Local Democrats like myself, therefore,
may only "choose the best Republican."
That individual is Tom Campbell, 35,
the youngest tenured law professor at
Stanford. Campbell packs a mighty
resume: He was editor of The Harvard
Law Review, received his Harvard law
degree magna cum laude and went on
to clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court.
His stances on the issues are well

thought-out and realistic. To be blunt,
Campbell is an articulate centrist who
has already won the endorsements of
most prominent Republicans and many
Democrats.
It's not that the two Democratic front
runners, San Mateo County Supervisor
Anna Eshoo and consultant Jim Gar
rison, wouldn't make fine representa
tives.
Eshoo's strength is local issues, while
Garrison has an edge in national and
international topics. Yet the party is bit
terly split, as is the GOP, between these
two front-runners.
All of which is academic. Neither can
win in November, even if Konnyu does
beat the more electable Campbell. If I
haven't made it clear by now, your rep
resentative will be either Ernie Konnyu
or Tom Campbell. No Democrat (or Re
publican for that matter), should have
to think too hard about which is better
suited for the job.
And so, my fellow Democrats, the
choice should be obvious. If you want to
avoid two more years of Ernie, register
Republican and vote for Tom Campbell
in the June 7 primary.
It's painless and quick.
