# Can you solve these resplendent rebuses?
## 
### Paul De Figueiredo Staff writer 
A rebus is a collection of pic
tures, numbers and letters put
together to form a word, phrase
or sentence. For example, the
rebus "timing tim ing" means
"split second timing," and the
rebus "thing-thing" means
"one thing after another."

The rebus was first used in
ancient Egypt about 3000 B.C.
in the form of hieroglyphics,
which were pictures and other
symbols used like letters of the
alphabet.
Egyptian hieroglyphics were
mainly phonetic signs, repre
senting not the object pictured
but some other thing that had
a name with a similar sound.
Individual characters were
joined together according to
rules such that words, phrases
and sentences were formed.
Though hieroglyphics died
out after Egypt was invaded by
Europeans, the rebus managed
to survive. During the reign of
Edward 111 in England, rebuses
became popular as symbols rep
resenting a family name, family
status or public office. The Ab
bott of Ramsey's seal, for ex
ample, shows a ram on the sea.
By the 18th century, the
rebus had been incorporated
into biblical literature with pic
tures taking the place of some
of the words.
Most recently, the rebus has
re-emerged in the United
States in a board game called
Whatzit? manufactured by Mil
ton Bradley.
According to Milton Bradley,
Paul Sellars was the first to
utilize the rebus in a board

game. He marketed a game in
England similar to Whatzit?
under the name of D'dingbats
and received a tremendous
response.
Listed below are a number
of rebuses as they might appear
on Whatzit? cards. See if you
can solve them.
