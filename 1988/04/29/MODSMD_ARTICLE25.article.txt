## Stage Review Tasteful but routine 'Murder' staged at Nitery 
### Debbie Frockt Staff writer 
It's hard to write a good play.
It's even harder to write a good
murder mystery. Not only do we
want something thrilling, clever
and exciting — we want some
thing new and free of trite clichds.
Senior H.G. Pollack displays a
few flashes of these essential
qualities during the premiere pro
duction of his play, "A Taste of
Murder." Unfortunately, the
script more often than not is bur
dened by lengthy expositions and
well-worn tricks of the trade.
Sometimes known around
campus as Howie, Pollack does
manage to provide a fairly
cohesive piece of writing for his
directors, actors and audience.
The story line works with a few
strategically placed suspensions of
disbelief. Agatha Christie it's not
— at least not yet — but we are
sometimes amused and some
times shocked.
The setting is not unfamiliar.
An honest, young, long-lost cousin
comes to visit his rich, rather
spooky East Coast family. The
patriarch is decrepit and despi
cable. His young, brash son is ex
plosive and somewhat maniacal.
There is a sweet, and often hys
terical, blond daughter flitting
about.
To make things a little more
intriguing, just add a few inex
plicable creepsters parading as
workmen and a shady chief of
police. Yes, you guessed it. We
have all the ingredients for a mur
der here, but I'll go no further
with plot summary so that you
can enjoy the maximum effect of
your evening of theater.
Suffice it to say that a great
amount of time and space is filled
by lengthy speeches of exposition.

Obviously, one of the most diffi
cult tasks for a playwright is to
provide the audience with the nec
essary background information to
understand the story without
boring them with a dry, un
dramatic presentation. Pollack's
lack of experience is most evident
in his inability to cut through this
problem.
Much of the time we feel as if
we could read a brief synopsis of
the family history before entering
the theater and be just as
prepared. Instead of filling his
space with action directly related
to his story, Pollack pads his ma
terial by reiterating facts that are
not always germane and are too
stilted to be considered essential
to the playwright's task of setting
up the audience.
There is no way for a problem
atic script to entirely overcome
its difficulties in production, but
Reid Edelman's direction
manages to allow the best mo
ments in the script to shine
through. With a combination of
mood music and a 19405-style set,
"A Taste of Murder" affords us
a rather humorous bit of nostal
gia.
In some of the climactic mo
ments of the play, and also the
most entertaining, we feel as if
we've stepped into a black and
white thriller where gentlemen
wear hats and ladies wear gloves.
It's a good instinct and perhaps
if Edelman had carried it a bit
further, the production would
have had a more consistent
vitality.
The acting is not quite at the
same standard of most Drama De
partment productions. Sopho
more Daniel Klein as Stephen the
long-lost cousin and senior Laura
Nisbet as the flighty daughter

Veronica both have some nice ex
pressions and mannerisms, but
they lack much range or depth.
Klein consistently looks goofy but
good-hearted, and Nisbet is drip
ping with a combination of sweet
ness and histrionics which is le
thal. Ultimately, they create char
acters which are sketches, not
portraits.
Some attempts at eccentric ac
cents and exaggerated styles to
fit eccentric and exaggerated char
acters are only partially successful
in Jeff Soesbe's portrayal of the
strange butler Philips and James
Assey's mean old man Archibald.
Soesbe has difficulties maintain
ing the cadence and voice that he
chooses and tends to slip in and
out of character.

Assey, a sophomore, is consis
tent but limited to one sound.
Andrew Myers' Richmond, the
spoiled heir, is schizophrenic, but
this is probably as much a result
of a weakness in the script as it
is an acting problem.
"A Taste of Murder" is not a
professional example of a well
made play, but it does have its
moments. A round of applause
should go to Edelman, the actors,
and the Drama Department for
supporting the work of a student
playwright. And a round of ap
plause for Pollack — keep with it.

"A Taste of Murder" will be per
formed at the Nitery today and
Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday
at 2 p.m.

Assey, a sophomore, is consis
tent but limited to one sound.
Andrew Myers' Richmond, the
spoiled heir, is schizophrenic, but

"A Taste of Murder" is not a
professional example of a well
made play, but it does have its
moments. A round of applause
should go to Edelman, the actors,
and the Drama Department for

plause for Pollack — keep with it.

"A Taste of Murder" will be per
formed at the Nitery today and
Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday
at 2 p.m.
