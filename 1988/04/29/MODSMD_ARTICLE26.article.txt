## 'Feast' a film delight 
### Jennifer Reese Staff writer 
"Babette's Feast" is the most
original and terrific movie
around these days. It's funny
and surprising throughout, a
refreshing change from the
stale, empty films we see so
many of, and which we have
come to expect. "Babette's
Feast" is the kind of film we
should be seeing more of: It's
imaginative, skillfully acted
and intriguing. Why is it so
rare?
To begin with, director
Gabriel Axel took a risk in
making this film, and most
directors are (prudently) risk
averse. We see the same kinds
of films over and over again,
the "sure successes": the
"little-boy-growing-up" movie,
the sexy thriller, the high
school romance movie, etc.
Axel, however, daringly
chose to dramatize a quirky
tale by Isak Dinesen about two
19th century Puritan sisters
living on the cold Danish coast.
This was by no means a "sure
thing." But Axel makes it work
and brings us the freshest
movie we've seen in a long
time.
The two women of the story
are beautiful and pious, desired
by men, but so devoted to their
pastor father that they do not
marry. Years pass, and they
grow old and quavery. After
their father's death they keep
his religious followers together,
though the flock dwindles to
only a handful of cranky,
decrepit old men and women.
Babette, their enigmatic
French cook, one day wins the
lottery, and with her money

'Babette's Feast'
is the kind of film
which we should
see more.

decides to put on a "real French
dinner" for these humble
people. The bulk of the movie
is concerned with this feast —
what it means to Babette, and
what it means to the guests
who eat it.
This may not sound like the
stuff of an exciting movie — I
was skeptical at first — and in
the hands of a lesser director
it could have easily failed,
turned stuffy or boring. But
Axel converts this story beauti
fully into a smooth, funny, ab
sorbing movie.
What is surprising is how
comical most of it is. The
scenes of the dour, old Puritans
poking nervously at the quails
Babette has cooked for them
is hilarious. It proves that you
don't need slapstick to ensure
laughs — just a keen eye for
life's silliness. The humor is
effortless, unstrained.
The fact that this film is in
Danish, and that it deals with
an unusual theme, may turn
some people off before they
even enter the theater. Make
no mistakes, cinema "snobs"
and a few others will be sure
to see the film for those very
reasons, but "Babette's Feast"
deserves a much larger audi
ence. Don't be put off by sub
titles and a strange story. This
is a movie for everyone.
