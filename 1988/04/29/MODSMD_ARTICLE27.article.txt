"Permanent Record"
AMC Old Mill Six
San Antonio/Central
Mountain View
In "Permanent Record," a
popular high school student
wanders away from a party one
night and jumps off a cliff. This
movie is an earnest and thought
ful exploration of why David
jumps, and more explicitly, how
his death affects his friends.
However, despite the best in
tentions, it comes out like one of
those "After-school special" TV
movies where they choose a
"tough" subject (teen pregnancy,
drug abuse, homosexuality, etc.)
and dramatize it, essentially
digesting it for a young audience,
and coming to some sort of life
affirming conclusion.
David (Alan Boyce) is a "to
gether" kid: musically talented,
bright, well-liked, hip, sensitive,
etc. He isn't the caricaturized
teenager of most teen movies —
he is "deep," or so it is suggested.
He's increasingly anxious, lacks
identity, is depressed (though he
shows it very little), and he kills
himself.
What triggers the suicide? The
movie suggests various factors,
but leaves the question un
answered. To nail down the "rea
son" would have wrecked the film.
The central figure in the movie
is not David, however, but Chris
(Keanu Reeves), his easy-going
best friend, a scraggly long-haired
kid who wears cutoff army pants
and combat boots.
Chris, while not as gifted as

David, is basically a happy kid,
and he is stunned by the suicide.
He goes through all the tradi
tional motions of self-doubt: "It
should've been me. ... I should've
known. ... I could've stopped
him." David's other friends do the
same, and since we've seen all
this 20 times before in movies
and on TV, none of these ques
tions have much emotional power
left, and the movie sags.
All the grief is leading up to a
musical tribute the kids want to
pay David. They want to use the
school auditorium, but the powers
"up top" forbid it (although the
principal in this film is actually
a good guy). They manage to get
around the authorities, though,
and there is an icky teary-eyed
finale which should never have
been shot.
Even before the corny finale,
though, "Permanent Record" was
having some problems. Suicide is
trivial unless the filmmakers can
make it matter to us, and they
don't really pull it off here.
This isn't a terrible movie —
it's quite smooth, but it's low on
originality, low on polish. It has
the workhorse good intentions of
a TV movie, which isn't quite good
enough to pay $5 to see.

"A Time of Destiny"
AMC Old Mill Six'
San Antonio/Central
Mountain View
The new William Hurt/Timothy
Hutton film, "A Time of Destiny,"
blends the sappiness of a Hall

mark card with the deranged
mentality of a slasher movie. Di
rector Gregory Nava (who made
the flawed but promising "El
Norte") has brought us a monster
of a movie: sometimes sickeningly
sweet, other times violent, always
(alas) heavy and sincere.
What is surprising is that two
intelligent big-name stars like
William Hurt and Timothy Hut
ton agreed to act in this hefty
and stupefying movie. It's hard
to understand why they didn't
just read the script, laugh
uproariously and walk away (still
chuckling) with their dignity.
Wholesome, angelic Josie
(Melissa Leo) defies her father
and elopes with Jack (Timothy
Hutton), a squeaky-clean young
soldier about to ship out for Italy
in World War 11. They have a
midnight wedding ceremony, the
music soars, the rain outside
pours down, they kiss (we wince),
but tragedy and separation
quickly follow.
Josie's father tracks them down
that very night and takes Josie
away, only to drive off the road
into the lagoon. He drowns, Josie
survives, and her disturbed black
sheep brother Martin (William
Hurt) blames Jack for his father's
death and decides to kill him. The
rest of the movie is about Martin's
obsession with Jack, as he follows
him into combat in Italy, then
back to San Diego, determined to
keep Jack and Josie apart.
One wishes he would succeed.
What really makes this movie un
endurable is the wimpiness of
Jack and Josie, the couple we're

supposed to be rooting for. Josie,
as played by Leo, is always plead
ing, tears welling up in her gentle
brown eyes.
William Hurt as Josie's wacko
brother Martin comes across as
weird and mechanical. This is one
performance Hurt is probably
going to want to forget.
Martin's obsession with de
stroying Jack is inadequately ex
plained with some muddled psy
chology. Flashbacks to Martin's
childhood are supposed to show
how the fact that his father didn't
love him enough led to his current
(severe!) problems.
The message seems to be that
Martin — who comes across as a
real maniac — is just a "wannabe"

goody-goody, the kid who didn't
make the "good" team, and
turned to evil instead. This is a
cop-out explanation for a cop-out
film.

"The Unholy"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
The last words of "The Unholy"
come when Father Michael, who
has been through hell and back
and can't take it anymore, says
"Take me out of here." I felt the
same way.
"The Unholy" could have been
a good movie. There were

respected names in front of and
behind the camera. But the
screenplay, co-written by veteran
Philip Yordon, could have been
renamed "The Holey."
The holes in the plotline are
complemented in the simplicity of
its execution. Priests are dying.
Their throats are ripped out while
they are praying at the altar on
the day after good Friday. The
opening scenes of the movie show
one Father Dennis' (Ruben
Rabasa) demise.
He is at the altar asking for
giveness for some dire deed when
a sultry redhead (Nicole Fortier)
appears. She is dressed in a black
cape and a see-through black
gauze dress that leaves little to
the imagination.
The will of the pure priest
crumbles as the siren makes her
moves on the poor man. He swal
lows hard and kisses the teasing
lips and, presto, his Ithroat is
ripped out.
This is typical of the tempta
tions that are offered Father Mi
chael (Ben Cross) when he
reopens the church three years
later.
This tale of horror and blood
centers around one of the devil's
demons who feeds upon the souls
of the devout and innocent, and
the devil's attempts to claim
Father Michael.
"The Unholy" can remain on
earth as long as no one resists its
temptations. The movie and
others like it will remain as long
as there are mindless folks who
cannot resist schlock.
