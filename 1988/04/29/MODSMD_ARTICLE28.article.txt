## Baseball continues whirlwind U.S. tour 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team, to par
aphrase country singer Willie Nelson,
just couldn't wait to get on the road
again.
Only a few hours after returning
from a tough extra-inning loss at
Fresno State's Beiden Field Wednes-

day night, the Cardinal nine was traveling again.
This time they exchanged the team bus for an
airplane and took off for Miami for a three-game
weekend series.
The three games, all broadcast on KZSU-FM 90.1,
start at 4:30 p.m. PDT today and Saturday, and
10 a.m. Sunday.
This weekend's games are crucial for two teams
looking for a late-season surge before the upcoming
NCAA regionals. The Hurricanes have been playing
flat in their last 10 games, compiling a record of
5-4-1. Stanford has not fared much better, going
6-4 over its last 10 contests.
Miami Coach Ron Fraser, whose team is ranked
12th in the nation by both the Baseball America

and ESPN polls, seems to have gone to the Bill
Walsh school of gloom and doom for sizing up
opponents. He discounted his team's high ranking,
saying it was inflated compared to the teams in the
West, especially Stanford. He said that his team
has a great record because they play inferior oppo
nents. "They (the pollsters) lose sight of the
schedules," Fraser said.
Meanwhile, Stanford, ranked seventh by Baseball
America and 10th by ESPN in the latest polls, is
trying to wrap up a successful six-game non
conference stretch — which ends Tuesday at home
against Pacific — before its final six games against
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division opponents.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said he thinks
that the Hurricanes will be a good warmup for the
NCAA regionals. "We've never played in Miami, so
that should be quite an experience. We've always
felt that in order to be the best team possible, you
have to play the best throughout the season. We'll
certainly be tested this week," he said.

in recent memory for a Stanford player, will be on

the line this weekend. Paulsen
currently leads the team with a
.359 batting average, 75 hits, 16
doubles and five game-winning
RBI.
Another player who has been
streaking lately for the Cardinal
is junior third baseman Ed
Sprague, who went three for five
with a home run against Fresno
State. Sprague's 16 home runs
put him atop the Six-Pac, and his
slugging percentage of .680 is tops
for Stanford.
Miami's stocky left-fielder Mike
Fiore could spell trouble for Stan
ford pitching. The 5-foot-10, 189-
pound senior has a .408 batting
average this season with 11 home
runs and 58 RBI, more than any
Stanford player this season.
Junior shortstop Jorge Robles,
who is batting .335 this season,
may also spark the Hurricanes
offense.
Of the three pitching matchups,
Friday's could be the key to the

series. Miami's best pitcher,
junior Joe Grahe, will be pitted
against Stanford freshman Stan
Spencer (4-1), who leads the Car
dinal pitching squad with a 3.36
ERA.
Spencer has been on a streak
of no-decisions. In his last start
Monday against Arizona State, he
went 2% innings, allowing five
hits and four runs. Stanford came
back to tie the game in the bottom
of the fourth, which let Spencer
off the hook, before losing 13-5.
In Saturday's contest, Stanford
senior Lee Plemel (6-8) goes
against Miami freshman Greg
Knowles. Knowles has compiled
a 7-2 record for the Hurricanes,
with a respectable 3.27 ERA.
Plemel has had some tough
breaks in his last few outings,
especially on Wednesday against
Fresno State, when his errant
throw in the bottom of the 10th
inning allowed the Bulldogs to
score the winning run. However,
Plemel still leads the team in
starts and strikeouts.
In the final game Sunday, the
only day game in the series, Stan
ford freshman Mike Mussina (8-1)

will face sophomore Steve Tucker.
Mussina leads the Cardinal in
wins and has been the corner
stone of the pitching staff this
season. In his last start at Fresno
State, he only gave up one run,
but left the game after the fourth
inning.
Mussina will need his best stuff
for the game on Sunday which
will likely be played in 90-degree
heat. When asked if the weather
would give Miami an advantage,
Fraser replied, "I'm looking for
all the help I can get."
"It's going to be a great series,"
he continued. "The fans are ex
cited to see the College World Se
ries champions come to town, and
the team is pumped up. We hope
we play well and they (Stanford)
play well," Fraser said.

play well," Fraser said.
The Stanford baseball team, to par
aphrase country singer Willie Nelson,
just couldn't wait to get on the road
again.
Only a few hours after returning
from a tough extra-inning loss at
Fresno State's Beiden Field Wednes-

day night, the Cardinal nine was traveling again.
This time they exchanged the team bus for an
airplane and took off for Miami for a three-game
weekend series.
The three games, all broadcast on KZSU-FM 90.1,
start at 4:30 p.m. PDT today and Saturday, and
10 a.m. Sunday.
This weekend's games are crucial for two teams
looking for a late-season surge before the upcoming
NCAA regionals. The Hurricanes have been playing
flat in their last 10 games, compiling a record of
5-4-1. Stanford has not fared much better, going
6-4 over its last 10 contests.
Miami Coach Ron Fraser, whose team is ranked
12th in the nation by both the Baseball America

and ESPN polls, seems to have gone to the Bill
Walsh school of gloom and doom for sizing up
opponents. He discounted his team's high ranking,
saying it was inflated compared to the teams in the
West, especially Stanford. He said that his team
has a great record because they play inferior oppo
nents. "They (the pollsters) lose sight of the
schedules," Fraser said.
Meanwhile, Stanford, ranked seventh by Baseball
America and 10th by ESPN in the latest polls, is
trying to wrap up a successful six-game non
conference stretch — which ends Tuesday at home
against Pacific — before its final six games against
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division opponents.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said he thinks
that the Hurricanes will be a good warmup for the
NCAA regionals. "We've never played in Miami, so
that should be quite an experience. We've always
felt that in order to be the best team possible, you
have to play the best throughout the season. We'll
certainly be tested this week," he said.
Troy Paulsen's 27-game hitting streak, the longest
in recent memory for a Stanford player, will be on

the line this weekend. Paulsen
currently leads the team with a
.359 batting average, 75 hits, 16
doubles and five game-winning
RBI.
Another player who has been
streaking lately for the Cardinal
is junior third baseman Ed
Sprague, who went three for five
with a home run against Fresno
State. Sprague's 16 home runs
put him atop the Six-Pac, and his
slugging percentage of .680 is tops
for Stanford.
Miami's stocky left-fielder Mike
Fiore could spell trouble for Stan
ford pitching. The 5-foot-10, 189-
pound senior has a .408 batting
average this season with 11 home
runs and 58 RBI, more than any
Stanford player this season.
Junior shortstop Jorge Robles,
who is batting .335 this season,
may also spark the Hurricanes
offense.
Of the three pitching matchups,
Friday's could be the key to the

series. Miami's best pitcher,
junior Joe Grahe, will be pitted
against Stanford freshman Stan
Spencer (4-1), who leads the Car
dinal pitching squad with a 3.36
ERA.
Spencer has been on a streak
of no-decisions. In his last start
Monday against Arizona State, he
went 2% innings, allowing five
hits and four runs. Stanford came
back to tie the game in the bottom
of the fourth, which let Spencer
off the hook, before losing 13-5.
In Saturday's contest, Stanford
senior Lee Plemel (6-8) goes
against Miami freshman Greg
Knowles. Knowles has compiled
a 7-2 record for the Hurricanes,
with a respectable 3.27 ERA.
Plemel has had some tough
breaks in his last few outings,
especially on Wednesday against
Fresno State, when his errant
throw in the bottom of the 10th
inning allowed the Bulldogs to
score the winning run. However,
Plemel still leads the team in
starts and strikeouts.
In the final game Sunday, the
only day game in the series, Stan
ford freshman Mike Mussina (8-1)

will face sophomore Steve Tucker.
Mussina leads the Cardinal in
wins and has been the corner
stone of the pitching staff this
season. In his last start at Fresno
State, he only gave up one run,
but left the game after the fourth
inning.
Mussina will need his best stuff
for the game on Sunday which
will likely be played in 90-degree
heat. When asked if the weather
would give Miami an advantage,
Fraser replied, "I'm looking for
all the help I can get."
"It's going to be a great series,"
he continued. "The fans are ex
