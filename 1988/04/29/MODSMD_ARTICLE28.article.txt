## Baseball continues whirlwind U.S. tour 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team, to par
aphrase country singer Willie Nelson,
just couldn't wait to get on the road
again.
Only a few hours after returning
from a tough extra-inning loss at
Fresno State's Beiden Field Wednes-

day night, the Cardinal nine was traveling again.
This time they exchanged the team bus for an
airplane and took off for Miami for a three-game
weekend series.
The three games, all broadcast on KZSU-FM 90.1,
start at 4:30 p.m. PDT today and Saturday, and
10 a.m. Sunday.
This weekend's games are crucial for two teams
looking for a late-season surge before the upcoming
NCAA regionals. The Hurricanes have been playing
flat in their last 10 games, compiling a record of
5-4-1. Stanford has not fared much better, going
6-4 over its last 10 contests.
Miami Coach Ron Fraser, whose team is ranked
12th in the nation by both the Baseball America

and ESPN polls, seems to have gone to the Bill
Walsh school of gloom and doom for sizing up
opponents. He discounted his team's high ranking,
saying it was inflated compared to the teams in the
West, especially Stanford. He said that his team
has a great record because they play inferior oppo
nents. "They (the pollsters) lose sight of the
schedules," Fraser said.
Meanwhile, Stanford, ranked seventh by Baseball
America and 10th by ESPN in the latest polls, is
trying to wrap up a successful six-game non
conference stretch — which ends Tuesday at home
against Pacific — before its final six games against
Pacific 10 Conference Southern Division opponents.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said he thinks
that the Hurricanes will be a good warmup for the
NCAA regionals. "We've never played in Miami, so
that should be quite an experience. We've always
felt that in order to be the best team possible, you
have to play the best throughout the season. We'll
certainly be tested this week," he said.
Troy Paulsen's 27-game hitting streak, the longest
in recent memory for a Stanford player, will be on

Stanford leftfielder Brian Johnson hit his first home run of the season Wednesday night in a losing
effort at Fresno State. Tonight, Johnson and the Cardinal begin a three-game effort against Miami to
improve their non-conference standing.
