# Researchers fight to lower overhead
## Faculty examines remedies to avert drain of federal research dollars 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: This story is the
second in a two-part series ex
amining the problems of Stan
ford's runaway indirect cost rate,
which is the research overhead
that siphons dollars away from
direct research projects. Today's
article looks at the faculty dilem
ma, and concludes with possible
solutions proposed by the faculty.

Stanford researchers are scram
bling this year to solve the prob
lem of high overhead costs that
knife into their federal research
dollars.

Because Stanford's indirect cost
rates are the second highest in
the nation — behind only Colum
bia University — some faculty
members fear that an inability to
control administrative costs, facil
ities depreciation, and operations
and maintenance costs will leave
Stanford high and dry in the na
tional research arena.
Those three costs make up the
bulk of the indirect cost rate,
which at Stanford increased by
50 percent from 1973 to 1986.
The rate is a tax Stanford levies
on federal agencies sponsoring re
search, in order to recoup over
head costs accrued by that re
search. Direct costs, by contrast,

are the funds that drive individual
experiments.
The two costs are lumped to
gether by federal agencies, which
have been squeezed by the Reagan
administration budget cuts.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll,
who worked on a deans' report
released in March documenting
the indirect cost problem, said
now is "a key time" for Stanford
to put the stops on indirect costs.
Noll questioned how Stanford
stacks up against other univer
sities in the eyes of the federal
government. Some universities
are working to decrease their
costs, Noll said. He predicted that
if Stanford doesn't follow suit, re

searchers will lose grants and the
University will lose its allure for
talented young researchers.
Struggling to keep pace
So far, University researchers
have been able to keep pace with
the rising indirect cost rates by
seeking additional federal grants
and contracts.
The deans' report, released
after two years of data-gathering,
found that the average number
of active grants or contracts per
University researcher has, in fact,
increased from 2.4 contracts per
researcher in 1977 to 2.9 in 1986.
This seemingly small increase
in contracts translates into a sig
nificant rise in the number of pro
posals written each year, which
means that research faculty have
less time to devote to their re
search or their teaching — with
out reaping any material benefits.
"Faculty researchers feel they
are working harder and harder to
stay in the same place," said Elec
trical Engineering Prof. Anthony
Siegman, a member of a faculty
task force on indirect costs formed
18 months ago to assist the deans'
study.
"The system is getting closer
to breaking down," Siegman con
cluded.

Unattractive options
In March, the faculty task force
released a report saying that Stan
ford's high indirect cost rate
leaves researchers with three un
attractive options:
• To avoid overhead cost drains
by seeking to finance research
projects with federal contracts
that specifically forbid indirect
cost charges from being levied.
This option would only be avail
able to a select number of faculty
and would alienate the have-nots.
• To shrink the scale of their
research programs, something
that none of Stanford's ambitious
faculty want.
• To increase the number of ac
tive grants per principal re
searcher, which would cause a
corresponding leap in the number
of written grant proposals. The
faculty has already attempted

this, with limited success.
Despite the unpalatable options
available to the Uni
versity and the deans' report per
sist in advocating a policy of full
cost recovery while striving for
national competitiveness — two
potentially conflicting goals that
don't show an active initiative by
the University to cut indirect
costs.
A researcher's view
One proponent of more radical
steps, Biology Prof. Robert
Simoni, said that from an indi
vidual researcher's point of view,
the goals outlined by the deans'
report are not critical.
Simoni said that immediate ac
tion is needed. "Over the past few
years, federal funding for research
has remained about the same or
gone down, but the University ad
ministration keeps getting more

of it,"he said. "This compromises
researchers' ability to do re
search."
"The bottom line is that we
must lower the cost of doing re
search at Stanford," he added.
Simoni said he sides with the
faculty report, which presents
seven loosely defined proposals,
including an absolute cap on the
indirect cost rate.
One of the faculty's most de
tailed proposals, called "overhead
for all," would impose indirect
cost recovery on all University de
partments, including those that
aren't traditionally considered
"research" departments.
Under the current policy, many
departments do not feel the ef
fects of the high indirect cost rate
because their indirect costs are
paid for invisibly by the Univer
sity. They never see the money

spent on indirect costs, so they
don't miss it, as individual scien
tists do.
Siegman said if all departments
had money visibly drained from
their budget to pay for overhead,
concern over the indirect cost rate
would be more widespread and a
broader movement for action
would arise.
No consensus yet
The task force did not reach a
consensus on which of its seven
proposals might be the most ef
fective, and the University has not
yet acted on any of these possible
solutions. The matter currently
rests with the Faculty Senate.
According to the faculty report,
"The problem is to get the entire
Stanford community faculty, ad
ministration and high level staff
to recognize that there is a prob
lem."
