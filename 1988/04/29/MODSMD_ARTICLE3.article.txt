# Researchers fight to lower overhead
## Faculty examines remedies to avert drain of federal research dollars

Editor's note: This story is the
second in a two-part series ex
amining the problems of Stan
ford's runaway indirect cost rate,
which is the research overhead
that siphons dollars away from
direct research projects. Today's
article looks at the faculty dilem
ma, and concludes with possible
solutions proposed by the faculty.

Stanford researchers are scram
bling this year to solve the prob
lem of high overhead costs that
knife into their federal research
dollars.

Because Stanford's indirect cost
rates are the second highest in
the nation — behind only Colum
bia University — some faculty
members fear that an inability to
control administrative costs, facil
ities depreciation, and operations
and maintenance costs will leave
Stanford high and dry in the na
tional research arena.
Those three costs make up the
bulk of the indirect cost rate,
which at Stanford increased by
50 percent from 1973 to 1986.
The rate is a tax Stanford levies
on federal agencies sponsoring re
search, in order to recoup over
head costs accrued by that re
search. Direct costs, by contrast,

are the funds that drive individual
experiments.
The two costs are lumped to
gether by federal agencies, which
have been squeezed by the Reagan
administration budget cuts.
Economics Prof. Roger Noll,
who worked on a deans' report
released in March documenting
the indirect cost problem, said
now is "a key time" for Stanford
to put the stops on indirect costs.
Noll questioned how Stanford
stacks up against other univer
sities in the eyes of the federal
government. Some universities
are working to decrease their
costs, Noll said. He predicted that
if Stanford doesn't follow suit, re

searchers will lose grants and the
University will lose its allure for
talented young researchers.
Struggling to keep pace
So far, University researchers
have been able to keep pace with
the rising indirect cost rates by
seeking additional federal grants
and contracts.
The deans' report, released
after two years of data-gathering,
found that the average number
of active grants or contracts per
University researcher has, in fact,
increased from 2.4 contracts per
researcher in 1977 to 2.9 in 1986.
