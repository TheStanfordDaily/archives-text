# Cal men on 17-year win streak
## Track aims to end jinx 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Edwards Field will be a proving
ground for the Stanford track and
field team Saturday as it ventures
to Berkeley to duel California in the
94th annual "Big Meet." The
seasonal marks for each team indi
cate a dead heat, so the team that

stands up best under pressure should come out on
top.
The Stanford men are currently the victims of a
17-year losing streak, although they hold a 50-41-2
overall series advantage. Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson feels that the 1988 Cardinal is better than
last year's, and has reason for optimism, with 16
men already qualified for the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship meet.
The women are looking to regain their series
lead, which is now tied at four wins apiece after
Cal won last year's contest 93-50. The women will
try to salvage the running events by scoring well
in the distance races, but should dominate the
throws. With thousands of fans watching they will
take no prisoners and fight for every point.
Stanford athletes could easily sweep several events
due to the virtual absence of Cal throwers. Among
these are NCAA qualifier Patty Purpur in the discus
and shot put, and Erica Wheeler, another NCAA
qualifier, in the javelin. Both are juniors and will
return in these events next year.
Lisa Bernhagen, a senior, is also an NCAA
qualifier and has several inches on the rest of the
field in the high jump. The other two field events
should be dominated by Sheila Hudson, Cal's 1987
NCAA long-jump champion and triple-jump runner
up. Still, Stanford should carry a substantial ad
vantage in the field.
Stanford's other top gun will be sophomore Carol
Gray, who is entered against Cal star Kirsten
O'Hara in both the 5,000 meters and the 3,000
meters. With several hours between them, these

two stars will compete in an epic duel.
Junior Kim Stevens and freshmen Melanie Bloch
and Wendy Neely will also need to come through
to keep Stanford close in the running events, as
the Cardinal will have to face Hudson and several
other Golden Bear standouts in the shorter events.
"They're strong in the sprints," Stanford Asst.
Coach Scott Chisam conceded. That could wipe out
Stanford's advantage in the field events.
The men will have a more balanced attack, with
their main strength coming in the distance events.
Marc Oleson should beat anyone Cal runs against
him in the 1,500 meters after setting a Stanford
Stadium record last weekend with a time of 3:39.26,
and will come back in the 5,000 meters, doubling
along with his roommate Steve Schadler. "One of
the things we need to do is put two people in front
of their distance guys," Oleson said.
Stanford will have to offset Atlee Mahorn, a junior
who was ranked fourth in the world during his
freshman season in the 200, and Rod Jett, who
should win both the 110-meter and 400-meter
hurdles.
Another key challenge for the Cardinal will be
in the weight throws. Junior Glenn Schneider thinks
Stanford is "strong; we'll get more points."
Schneider will be the favorite in the discus for the
Cardinal after setting a school record of 196 feet,
one inch last week, and will pressure Cal freshman
Roland Anderson in the hammer. With senior Dave
Pickett boasting a school-record 233-11 in the
javelin, the field events will be very close.
This meet will focus as much on third-place
finishes as wins, and one or two upset wins will
probably make the difference. This is Stanford's
first and only dual meet of the season. The coaches
are hoping that Cal will be worn down from several
tight matches, including their meet last weekend
that saw the Bears beat Fresno State but lose a
hard battle to Oregon. It will be an opportunity for
the women to beat Cal on its home turf, and the
best chance of the decade for the men to beat the
Cal jinx.
