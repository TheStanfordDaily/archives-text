# Tennis teams play some not-so-Big Games at Cal
## Pride on the line for women 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
With its 6-0 win
Wednesday against
U.S. International
University, the
Stanford women's
tennis team se
cured the No. 2

seeding in the upcoming NCAA
Championships in Los Angeles.
Tomorrow's 1 p.m. regular season
finale at California has not been
rendered meaningless, however.
"Cal means a lot pride-wise,"
junior Cindy Buchsbaum said fol
lowing the USIU match. "I think
it's just sort of a positive thing.
We get one more tough match in."
Unfortunately, freshman Tami
Whitlinger won't have the benefit
of playing one more tough match
prior to the nationals. The Car
dinal's top singles player is still
bothered by a groin injury that
she aggravated at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships last
weekend in Ojai.
"I think it's a little more serious
than what I thought," Whitlinger
said yesterday."I did a little run
ning to test it, antf it hurt. It
bothers me that it's still hurting.
I hate not doing anything."
Whitlinger said she should be
able to start hitting again by Sun
day. "Whether it's ready or not,
I think 1 want to start playing. I
tried to be patient with it, but I
want to start hitting."
Without Whitlinger and junior
Eleni Rossides, the second-ranked
Cardinal could be hard-pressed to
beat the No. 5 Golden Bears.
When the teams met here April
7, Stanford clinched the match in
singles, and if the Cardinal cannot
repeat the trick tomorrow, it will

have to go without the services
of its No. 2 doubles team (Tami
and Teri Whitlinger) against Cal's
talented doubles corps.
In addition, Stanford's top dou
bles tandem — senior Cari Hagey
and freshman Sandra Birch —
has not played together since the
Cal match here, when Hagey hurt
her right shoulder.
Senior Kay Tittle and sopho
more Lisa Green, the Cardinal's
No. 3 pair, are coming off their
finest week of the season at Ojai,
where they advanced to the semi
finals of the Pac-10 doubles tour
nament. Tittle and Green will
move up to No. 2 against the
Bears, with Teri Whitlinger and
Buchsbaum playing at No. 3.
Cal's potent doubles lineup is
led by Alissa Finerman and Tif
fany Silveria, the newly crowned
Pac-10 doubles champions. They
beat Tittle and Green in straight
sets in the Pac-10 semifinals, and
then in the finals upended team
mates Sharon Fletcher and Jean
Marie Lozano in three sets.
Fletcher and Lozano knocked off
the Whitlingers in the Stanford-
Cal match three weeks ago.
Card note
The Cardinal finds itself in an in
teresting position this weekend:
rooting for USC. The No. 3 Trojans
meet No. 4 UCLA this weekend in
i/os Angeles. If the Bruins win, they
will move ahead of the Trojans and
earn the No. 3 seeding at the NCAA
championships. This would set up a
potential Stanford-UCLA national
semifinal. The Cardinal would prefer
to play USC, which it has beaten twice
easily this season, rather than UCLA,
which split two matches with Stan
ford this year and will have the home
court advantage in I>os Angeles.
