# Are men vulnerable without injured freshman Wheaton?
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
On paper, the top
rated Stanford
men's tennis team
should dust off No.
16 California today
in Berkeley with
dispatch.

The Cardinal is 20-1 with a 14-
match win streak to its credit. It
has big names such as the
Wheatons, the McEnroes and
Tarangos that Cal doesn't.
In doubles play, freshman Da
vid Wheaton and sophomore Jeff
Tarango are the nation's No. 3
pair, with senior Patrick McEnroe
and freshman Martin Blackman
the No. 23 tandem.
Cal, by contrast, has no doubles
team with a national ranking and
no singles player rated in the top
50. The Bears' No. 1 player, Ted
Scherman, is out with a leg injury,
and their best available player,
Woody Hunt, is suffering through
a mtyor junior slump. Cal is just
12-12 on the season.
But a combination of a Stanford
injury and Cal clawing to qualify
for the NCAA field makes today's
1:30 p.m. contest interesting. The
match is the Cardinal's last before
the NCAA Championships May
20-24.
"To clinch an NCAA berth, they
have to win the match," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "It
wouldn't be an easy match (for
us) with everyone healthy, but
without David it will be a little
tougher.
"A good team is able to circum
vent its problems and rise above

healthy, but without
David it will be a little
tougher.'

that. But we had better be ready
to play. It's an important match
for us to build momentum for the
NCAAs."
Wheaton, who started the
season with an injured left wrist,
won't play today because of a
groin injury. He should be ready
to play within a week and enter
the NCAAs at full strength.
Sophomore Barry Richards,
who played solid doubles with
Tarango at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Championships last weekend
in Ojai, will play in the singles
lineup and team with Tarango in
doubles.
The Bears, who are playing in
their final home dual match this
season, are on the fence for an
NCAA bid. A win over cross-town
rival Stanford would ensure them
of a spot in the elite field.
Freshman Carl Chang comes
off an impressive Pac-10 tourna
ment, where he upset UCLA's
Jason Netter before losing in the
semifinals to Tarango. Hunt has
rebounded from ii\juries and is
ready to go at No. 1 singles.
In short, Cal has nothing to
lose and an NCAA bid to gain. A
win over a depleted Stanford
squad would make their season.
