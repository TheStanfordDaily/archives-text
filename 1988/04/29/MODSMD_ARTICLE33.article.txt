# Going for the shirts off their backs
## Crew in Big Row vs. Bears 
### Don Hogue Staff writer 
Bay Area bragging rights are on
the line in this weekend's annual
Big Row. California has both the
momentum and the home-course
advantage, but Stanford will key
on revenge in the annual Stanford-
Cal crew classic.

"This is pretty much our chance," varsity
oarsman Bart Nichols said. "Our seniors haven't
beaten Cal in a dual race. It's a last chance for
some of the seniors to win a Cal shirt."
Nichols added that the men's varsity has grown
tired of giving California its shirts, the traditional
trappings garnered by winning crews in dual
meets. Although Cal is established as one of the
top crews on the West Coast, Stanford crew
members noted that the gap has narrowed sig
nificantly in the teams' last meetings.
California's varsity crews defeated Stanford's
two weeks ago at the Redwood Shores/Stanford
Rowing Classic. However, Stanford's men are

coming off an emotional high after upsetting
perennial power Washington at Redwood Shores.
California's home course on the Oakland Es
tuary, however, may prove to be enough of a
challenge for Stanford. The course is known for
its currents and eddies which can be distracting
for visiting crews. Unlike Stanford's home course
at Redwood Shores, the Oakland Estuary has a
significant amount of boat traffic, which creates
wakes on the race course.
"It's tough to steer because of the currents,"
Stanford Women's Coach John Davis said. "It's
really confusing, especially for the novice boats."
Still, Stanford's women's novice crews may
have the upper hand against Cal. Stanford Co
coach Wendy Davis' novice crew is undefeated,
garnering a medal at the San Diego Crew classic
earlier this year.
The women's varsity hasn't been as fortunate.
"It's tough when we're making progress and
we have people in the boat downed by the flu,"
senior varsity stroke Kristin Dahl said. However,
Dahl indicated that recent changes in the boat
may give the varsity some optimism against Cal.
