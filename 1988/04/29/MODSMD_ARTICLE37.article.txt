# A 						week for gay and lesbian activism
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
Celebrating 20 years of gay and lesbian
activism at Stanford, the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford will hold its 15th annual
Gay and Lesbian Awareness Week, a seven
day-long series of events designed to educate
people about Stanford's gay community.
Recent controversy surrounding the un
finished restoration of George Segal's "Gay
Liberation" statue — vandalized and
removed for repairs last summer — has
focused attention on the week, which begins
Sunday and will include a rally next Friday
at the statue's former site.
For several months, GLAS has been ask
ing the University to have the statue
returned in time for GALA Week. Earlier
this week, the Stanford Organization for
Lesbian and Gay Equality produced photos
taken Tuesday that show the statue has not
yet been repaired, despite an art professor's
claims to the contrary.
Because of the controversy, the rally may
be larger and "a little less friendly" than
planned, according to senior Daniel Bao, a
member of the GALA Week planning com
mittee.
As in past years, GALA Week this year
will include a Gay and Lesbian Blue Jeans
Day, which will be held Thursday. Since its
inception in 1978, Blue Jeans Day has al
ways been one of the week's most contro
versial events.

The purpose of Blue Jeans Day is to
familiarize gay and lesbian peoples' struggles
by making something as acceptable as
wearing blue jeans an unusual event. "What
if just being yourself wasn't so easy?" asked
Phil Fernandez, manager of computing and
networking for the Medical School and a
member of the planning committee.
"Wearing blue jeans is a completely nor
mal everyday thing for everyone, but all of
a sudden it's not," he said. "Because it's
Gay Blue Jeans Day, people might look at
[those wearing jeans] suspiciously. You can't
just be yourself without thinking about it."
Another event designed to bridge the gap
between gay and non-gay communities will
be a free concert by singer Holly Near, foun
der of Redwood Records and a pioneer of
"women's music," which often deals with
feminist themes and is produced and written
by women.
Near has long been a supporter of gay
and lesbian liberation, as well as an activist
for the women's movement and for peace
in Central America, according to Ted Hardie,
a graduate student and member of the plan
ning committee.
"Sponsoring a performer who does sup
port gay rights but is also a symbol of ac
tivities beyond [gay liberation]" should at
tract a broader audience to the concert, he
said.
In another attempt to broaden awareness,
Ujamaa House will host an informal panel
discussion on relationships between the

black and gay communities. According to
freshman and committee member Corey
Davis, the panel of five students will focus
on racism in the gay community and ho
mophobia in the black community, with a
particular focus on the isolation of black
gay people.
This program is the first of its kind here
at Stanford and will be "most important in
that it will give a chance for gay blacks to
feel secure and help to rid stereotypes that
the black community is more homophobic,"
Davis said.
Director of Student Organization Services
Michael Ramsey-Perez said he is looking
forward to GALA Week. "GLAS is one of
the better, more tightly organized groups
on campus," he said. "They know how to
get things done."
Because of recent tension between gay
and lesbian students and the University over
the state of repair of the Segal statue, Bao
said Friday's rally in particular could become
a forum for students to air their concerns.
Cleve Jones, the founder of the Names Proj
ect (the AIDS quilt) and a longtime gay
activist, will speak at the rally.
Ramsey-Perez agreed with Bao that "cer
tainly there are issues" between the gay
community and the University. "It would
be wrong to say there are no problems, but
the good thing is that the students know
who to talk to, and they're talking."
