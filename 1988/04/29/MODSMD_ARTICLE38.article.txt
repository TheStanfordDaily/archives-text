An editorial printed in yester
day's Daily said two students were
members of the Delta Upsilon fra
ternity when they assaulted an
other student during Rush two
years ago. In fact, neither was a
member of Delta Upsilon at the
time.
Also, in a Daily story last Fri
day, Rudy Fuentes was identified
as the co-chair of MEChA, a
Chicano/Latino organization. In
face, at that time MEChA had no
chair position.
