# Hopkins' search for a director is over
## 
### Heather Woodcock 
After four years without a di
rector, Stanford's Hopkins
Marine Station, just 90 miles
south of the Palo Alto campus,
has finally found an official
leader.
Wooed by the marine station
for three years, Dennis Powers,
former chair of the biology de
partment at Johns Hopkins Uni
versity, will take over as director
and assume a tenured position as
professor of biology effective in
September.
The marine station is located
on about one mile of Stanford
owned shoreline in Monterey Bay.
Founded in 1892, one year after
Stanford opened for classes, it was
the first marine laboratory to be
established on the Pacific Coast.
Since 1984, the marine station

has been led by an acting director,
Marine Biology Prof. David Epel,
while an interim six-person com
mittee of professors, graduate stu
dents and undergraduates sought
a replacement.
Powers said his decision took
so long because the marine station
is understaffed, with only nine
full-time biologists, and may lack
sufficient facilities for his re
search interests.
"I think the staff out at the
station is too small," Powers said.
"The University has offered two
additional positions and I asked
for six. We 11 see what we can do."
The lengthy three-year negoti
ations between Powers and the
marine station were also due
largely to the prospect of the new
Monterey Bay Aquarium Re
search Institute donated by bil
lionaire Palo Alto industrialist

the station is too

David Packard, who decided to
set up an institute with a focus
on oceanography with a broader
interest in marine biology.
The marine station and Powers
hope to share facilities with Pack
ard's project, which is located only
a block away. Although Hopkins
wants to share resources with the
Packard project, the institute will
not become a part of Stanford,
according to Judy Thompson, ad
ministrator for the marine sta
tion.
Allan Campbell, who headed the
selection committee that chose

Powers, said he was hesitant
about conducting the search for
a new director without knowing
what the station could offer. "A
potential director would be out of
his right mind," Campbell said,
"if he wanted to accept an offer
without a definitive postition
from the Packard Institute."
Although negotiations with the
institute have not been completely
finalized, both Powers and Camp
bell said that an agreement will
be reached soon and that they are
excited at the developments that
are going op at Hopkins.
"The marine station is really
moving forward," Powers said.
"We're meeting now about the
construction of the new Packard
buildings we hope to build. We
also hope to be working in con
junction with the Monterey Bay
Aquarium."
