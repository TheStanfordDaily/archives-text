# Soviets conclude feverish week visiting Stanford

They're gone.
After a jam-packed week of Stanford dorm life,
San Francisco sightseeing and political discourse,
last night 12 Soviet students and their supervisors
headed home.
The Russians, here as part of the Stanford Soviet
Exchange Project, gave hundreds of Stanford stu
dents the chance "to get to know [Soviets] who are
really our peers," said SSEP Chair David Kang, a
senior.
The exchange program got off the ground last
year when a group of Stanford students decided to
create a person-to-person dialogue with the Soviet
Union. With the recent thaw of relations between
the United States and the Soviet Union, the ex
change quickly became reality.
During spring break, 12 Stanford undergraduates
traveled through the Soviet Union and visited with
university students there. This week the Soviet
students reciprocated the visit.
While both student groups had some expectations
fulfilled and others smashed, Soviet student Igor
Liapunov called the program a first step in "building
our mutual understanding."
During the week, the Soviets stayed in Phi Psi,
Hurlburt, Florence Moore Hall and other University
residences, giving Stanford students an intensified
residential education.
The Soviets students also played football with
Branner freshmen, participated in a panel discussion
on Soviet-American perceptions and attended
classes.
Junior Dean Pedregon, who
met Soviet students in his Rus
sian language class, said he at
tempted to speak to them in
Russian but found it difficult be
cause of his "limited vocabulary."
Pedregon did, however, manage
to find out about the students'
homes, hobbies and their opinions
of American sports.
According to Pedregon, they
thought "American football was
strange because . . . you get
knocked down and then you think
for 15 minutes."
The students he met were "all
pretty friendly," Pedregon said,
adding that he was surprised to
learn that one Soviet college stu
dent, Sergei Richter, "was
married and had a couple of kids."
Pedregon went on to praise
Richter as "a very intelligent,
down-to-earth guy." Richter is
presently the head of the Kom
sommol, a prominent Communist
student organization.
Branner freshman John
Ameriks was also impressed with
the Russians. Ameriks, who
traveled throughout the Soviet
Union in high school, said he
really wanted to go to
Novosibirsk, "because the stu
dents seem more relaxed than the
people in Leningrad and Moscow."
Ameriks planned the football
game with the Russians, saw San
Francisco with them and has
spent much of the past week
taking full advantage of the ex
change.
Ameriks gained international
perspective as well as a more di
verse music collection because of
the exchange. The students gave
him Russian music tapes which,
according to Ameriks, are "just
as good as American rock."
While touring San Francisco,
the Stanford students showed the
Russians the wealthy and poor
sections of the city, pointing out
"soup lines and business centers,"
Ameriks said.
But one Soviet student, Igor
Liapunov, was skeptical about
what he had seen during the trip
and was hesitant about evaluating
American social conditions. Ac
cording to Liapunov, he had
learned that the United States

'I was disappointed
that some of the
stereotypes (about
the Soviet Union)
turned out to be true.'
— Ann Podlozny

"was a land of contrasts" and was
not yet ready to make his own
judgements because the Soviets
only "visited comfortable places."
Soviet student Ramon Borisov
also expected to see extremes of
poverty and wealth during his
stay but said he was surprised at
"how comfortable" he felt in the
United States.
"I was surprised I was not
hauled around a corner and
robbed," he said.
But the Russians were not the
only students who confronted cul
tural differences during the ex
change.
"I was disappointed that some
of the stereotypes (about the So
viet Union) turned out to be
true," junior Ann Podlozny said.
Podlozny, who lives in Flo Mo
where two Soviets were staying,
called the Soviet visitors male
chauvinists. She explained that
one Soviet male snubbed her
when a Stanford male walked into
a lounge where they were talking.
"[He] turned his whole body
away from me and ignored me,"
she said. "[They] required male
verification for everything I told
them, even directions."
Podlozny said she was "disap
pointed" by the men's attitudes
and knew that "they were part of
their culture."
In fact, senior Alma Derriks,
who participated in the exchange,
said she confronted chauvinistic
sentiments in Russia. She said
that both Soviet men and women
were opposed to women having
important leadership roles in
their country.
Derriks went on to explain that
when the Soviets learned that she
was majoring in international re
lations they told her that "women
just don't do that here."
Female Soviet exchange stu
dent Elena Sazonova said that the
women of her country are in a

"slightly suppressed state."
Sazonova was one of only two
women with the 12-person Soviet
group — delegates were chosen
on the basis of academic achieve
ment. Noting that most Soviet
women are married by college age,
Sazonova said that women cannot
devote themselves solely to aca
demics.
Although there were cultural
differences between the two
groups, both sides worked to
break stereotypes. Sophomore
Kim Grose, another exchange par

ticipant, said that speaking to two
Soviet men made both groups
"think out [their] own countries
on a personal level — not as
abstractions but as people."
Soviet student Valodya
Schiltser also came to terms with
the two countries on a person-to
person basis. One night on the
trip, Schiltser began roaming the
halls at 2 a.m., determined to
strike up a conversation with an
American.
"America is not for sleeping,"
he said.
