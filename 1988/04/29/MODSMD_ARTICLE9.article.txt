They're gone.
After a jam-packed week of Stanford dorm life,
San Francisco sightseeing and political discourse,
last night 12 Soviet students and their supervisors
headed home.
The Russians, here as part of the Stanford Soviet
Exchange Project, gave hundreds of Stanford stu
dents the chance "to get to know [Soviets] who are
really our peers," said SSEP Chair David Kang, a
senior.
The exchange program got off the ground last
year when a group of Stanford students decided to
create a person-to-person dialogue with the Soviet
Union. With the recent thaw of relations between
the United States and the Soviet Union, the ex
change quickly became reality.
During spring break, 12 Stanford undergraduates
traveled through the Soviet Union and visited with
university students there. This week the Soviet
students reciprocated the visit.
While both student groups had some expectations
fulfilled and others smashed, Soviet student Igor
Liapunov called the program a first step in "building
our mutual understanding."
During the week, the Soviets stayed in Phi Psi,
Hurlburt, Florence Moore Hall and other University
residences, giving Stanford students an intensified
residential education.
The Soviets students also played football with
Branner freshmen, participated in a panel discussion
on Soviet-American perceptions and attended
classes.
