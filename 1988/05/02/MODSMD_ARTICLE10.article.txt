# Blacks, gays strive to resolve prejudice

### Christine Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
The black and gay commu
nities should work together to
overcome misperceptions of
each other, a panel of black
and gay students and alumni
agreed at Ujamaa House last
night.
The panel, composed of two
gay black men, two white les
bians and a heterosexual black
woman, focused on the rela
tionship between the black and
gay communities as well as the
unique problems of gay blacks.
Senior Barb Voss noted that
while gay people often perceive
homophobia within the black
community, they do not recog
nize racism within the gay com
munity.
Voss, a member of both the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford and the Stanford Or
ganization for Lesbian and Gay
Equality, called for cooperation
between the communities to
overcome these attitudes.
Two panel members dis
cussed the "double discrimina
tion" felt by those who are both
gay and black. Karl Knapper,
a 1983 graduate in communi
cation, is just such a person.
He noted that like being black,
being gay is not a matter of
choice.
"People have asked: Why
would I want to add the prob
lem of homophobia to racism?"
Knapper said. According to
Knapper, "That (question)

arises from the misconception
that being gay is a choice."
Freshman Corey Davis, a
black student, spoke about his
decision to live in Ujamaa, the
black theme house. "I figured
if I lived in Ujamaa, I wouldn't
come out [about my sexual
orientation]," he said. "It still
scares me when I come out to
black people because of the
stereotype that they're more
homophobic, but I don't think
that's true."
Although the panel ad
dressed the issue of solidarity
between the gay and black com
munities, it acknowledged that
their agendas are not always
the same.
"We (the black community)
work with allies when we can,
but it is no simple task to form
coalitions," said senior Amanda
Kemp, a member of the Black
Student Union.
But Voss emphasized that
while the two groups need to
respect each other's agendas,
they should not wait until their
goals are absolutely congruent
to work together.
She added that many of the
stereotypes about blacks being
homophobic and gays being
racist are tactics used by some
members of the white commu
nity to divide the black and gay
communities.
"Homophobia has become a
buzzword used by the white
conservative Stanford commu
nity to turn gays and blacks
against each other," Voss said.
