# Young calls for more youth activism
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young
spoke on the importance of youth
activism in fostering change in
the United States and abroad Sat
urday in Memorial Auditorium.
Young's speech to over 500
people was the keynote address
for the four-day Global Objectives
'88 conference, which was de
signed to bring together people of
different backgrounds to discuss
activism and globed development.
Young, who has served in the
House of Representatives as the
first black person elected from
Georgia in 101 years and as am
bassador to the United Nations
under President Carter, made a
name for himself by working in
the early civil rights movement
alongside Martin Luther King Jr.

and by promoting development in
the Third World.
Speaking here, Young high
lighted the central role young ac
tivists have played in important
social developments of recent his
tory. He also criticized the fact
that so few students actually be
come involved in such movements
and called on those at the confer
ence to inspire others to action.
"You're not hearing the Grate
ful Dead; you are about making
the world meaningful for the
living," Young quipped, referring
to that afternoon's concert in
Frost Ampitheater.
Looking back on his experiences
during the Vietnam War, Young
remembered visiting a campus
where 20 students were protest
ing the war while many more stu
dents were involved in "fraternity
and sorority foolishness."

According to Young, the move
ment to desegregate busing in
Montgomery, Ala. — popularized
by Rosa Parks and King — actu
ally started when an anonymous
youth sat in a bus section reserved
for white people only.
"Had it not been for the action
of that young person, we might
not be here today," Young said.
"Nobody started a conference
to start a sit-in movement,"
Young said. The power of young
people is to take concrete action,
"to take on the big issues of the
day and make a difference."
Young also outlined the leader
ship role the United States should
be playing in development, saying:
"For good or for ill, we do run
the world." As a result, the United
States must provide the vision to
create a "global New Deal."
Opportunities exist, especially

with countries like Japan, for U.S.
leadership to guide world capital
into projects "to feed the hungry,
to clothe the naked, to heal the
sick," Young said.
According to Young, the real
problem with U.S. citizens is that
they are afraid of the world be
yond the borders of their own
country, especially the Third
World. He commended those at
tending the conference for feeling
very comfortable with the world
and said they should make an ef
fort to rid fear of involvement
among other citizens through ed
ucation.
A mix of students and non
students, representing more than
100 international organizations
from 35 nations and 25 states of
the United States, attended the
weekend conference.
