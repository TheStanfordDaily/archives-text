Aide dies: apparent suicide
WASHINGTON — Tom Pappas, chief aide
to Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., died yesterday in
what police described as an apparent suicide
leap from his room on the 24th floor of the
Helmsley Palace Hotel in New York City.
Pappas, 46, of Accokeek in Prince George's
County, Md., was the subject of a Federal
Election Commission review of irregularities
in Dyson's campaign finances and was the
focus of a front-page article in yesterday's
Washington Post that described unorthodox
social demands he made of male staff members
in the congressional office.
Pappas left behind a note, police said, but
they would not reveal its contents.
New York police said Pappas, Dyson and
Todd Skipper, Dyson's legislative director,
checked into the hotel Friday. They were in
town for a meeting with a lawyer, police said.
Police interviewed Dyson and Skipper about
the incident Sunday, Det. James Coleman said.
The two could not be reached for comment,
last night.
Two friends who talked to Pappas by tele
phone yesterday morning said he was dis
traught that the story appeared on the front
page and focused on social activities involving
the office. They said he was also worried about
its impact on Dyson's reelection campaign in
Maryland's Ist District, which includes the
Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland.
But the friends said they had no inkling
that he intended to take his life. Police said
he jumped from a window in his room about
midday and fell to an eighth floor roof. He
was pronounced dead at the scene at 12:25
p.m., according to police.
Pappas and Dyson declined repeated re
quests by the Washington Post for interviews.
OPEC oil-cutting plans stall
VIENNA, Austria — An ambitious plan for
a global alliance of oil producers stumbled
today over the inability of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries to overcome
its own intractable internal differences.
OPEC's 13 oil ministers broke off their un
usual meetings here and adjourned until June
after failing to settle on a plan to cut oil
production in concert with Mexico and five
other non-OPEC nations.
The collapse of talks is likely to drive oil
prices for now, perhaps by $1 a barrel,
analysts said. That will not have much effect
on the price of gasoline or other oil products,
however, because oil prices are expected to
edge back up as seasonal summer demand
takes over in a few weeks.
A failure to cut production was a victory
for Saudi Arabia, the world's richest oil nation,
which opposes sharp increases in oil prices
that would trigger new conservation and al
ternative energy measures in industrial na
tions.
