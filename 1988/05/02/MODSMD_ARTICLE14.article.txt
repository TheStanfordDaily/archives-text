# IRA claims killings of 3 British airmen
## 
### 
BONN, West Germany —
Three British servicemen were
slain and three more were
wounded in the Netherlands early
yesterday, and the Irish Republi
can Army later claimed responsi
bility for the killings.
The off-duty servicemen were
attacked in two separate incidents
while they were on weekend
passes during May Day festivities
in the Netherlands, just across
the border from their Royal Air
Force base in West Germany.
One airman was killed and two
were wounded when their car was
raked by sub-machine gun fire in
the town of Roermond in south
ern Holland.
A half-hour later and 30 miles
south, in the hamlet of Nieuw
bergen, two airmen died and one
was badly injured when a bomb
exploded in their car as they got

into it after leaving a discotheque.
The disco is a haunt for off-duty
British servicemen, and the
nearby streets in the early hours
were still filled with people
marking Queen Beatrix' 50th
birthday, celebrated over the
weekend.
The attack, for which the IRA
in Belfast clamed responsibility,
was apparently in retaliation for
the March slaying of three IRA
guerrillas in Gibraltar.
British sources have reported
that the slaying of the IRA guer
rillas, who were allegedly intent
on placing a bomb in the British
colony at the tip of Spain, was
carried out by an ambush set by
troopers of the British army's top
secret, anti-terrorist arm, the Spe
cial Air Service.
