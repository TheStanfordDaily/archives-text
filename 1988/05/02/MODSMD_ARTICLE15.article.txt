# Israel suspends officer
## Opened fire unnecessarily on stone-throwers 
### 
JERUSALEM â€” A junior Is
raeli army officer was suspended
yesterday after a preliminary in
vestigation determined that he
had unnecessarily ordered his
troops to open fire on stone
throwing Palestinian demonstra
tors, killing a 20-year-old man.
An army press representative
said that the incident occurred
near the northern perimeter of
the occupied West Bank, in the
village of Faqqua, northeast of
Janin. The shooting followed a
number of recent reports that Is
raeli troops, in a change from ear
lier practice, had opened direct,
live fire in response to attacks
with stones.
Long-standing army procedures
prohibit such fire unless there is
a real threat to the soldier's life
and unless he has first tried to
disperse his attackers with oral

warnings and a series of warning
shots in the air and at their feet.
The same restrictions were lifted
several weeks ago in the case of
attackers hurling firebombs at
troops.
A military press representative
said this was not the first time
during the nearly five months of
Palestinian unrest in the occupied
territories that an Israeli soldier
was faulted for unwarranted use
of live gunfire. She would not cite
specific examples, however, and
noted that "not everything is pub
lished."
The army's chief education of
ficer, Brig. Gen. Nehemiah
Dagan, said last week that Israeli
soldiers commit an average of 200
"excessive acts" against Palestin
ians in the occupied territories
each month.
