# Protests rock Poland
## Police, demonstrators clash on May Day 
### 
WARSAW, Poland — Police and pro-
Solidarity demonstrators clashed in
Warsaw and Gdansk yesterday and anti
government demonstrations were
mounted in five other Polish cities,
marking a tense May Day on which
workers at the nation's largest steel mill
remained on strike for the sixth day.
In the Baltic seaport of Gdansk, the
birthplace of the now-banned Solidarity
trade union, demonstrators engaged in
running skirmishes with police for 40
minutes. Witnesses said that two police
officers were beaten when they tried to
enter a churchyard to apprehend rock
throwing demonstrators.
In Warsaw, police clashed briefly with
demonstrators following a rally outside
St. Stanislaw Kostka Church, a cepter
of Solidarity support in the capital. The
demonstrators dispersed after a one
hour standoff with police, who were de
termined to prevent the anti
government rally from spreading beyond
the neighborhood of the church.
The government press representative
said that at least 33 people were arrested
across the country in what Solidarity
had urged as national "day of protest."
The Polish leader, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, speaking at official May Day
ceremonies, took a hard line against the
wave of labor unrest that has beset
Poland in the past week.
"Our country is at a turning point"
in its economic reform plan, Jaruzelski
said in a rally preceding the traditional
May Day parade, suggesting that in
creased wage demands from workers
could derail the government's faltering
plan to revive the troubled economy.
As Jaruzelski spoke, hundreds of
workers at the vast Lenin steel works
in Nowa Huta were attending a mass
conducted by two priests who had been
spirited into the sealed-off plant by
workers who, since Tuesday, have been
demanding a 50 percent pay increase to
offset price increases imposed by the
government in February and March.
The factory's strike committee and
negotiators for the plant management
have been stalemated since the strike

began, and government officials are
clearly worried that strikes could spread
to other industrial concerns.
Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader,
pressed the rally in Gdansk to show
support for the striking workers at Nowa
Huta but stopped short of calling for
more strikes.
The wave of strikes in Poland, the
worst since Solidarity was banned and
martial law was declared in 1981, began
last Monday with a transport workers
strike in two western Polish cities,
Bydgoscsz and Inowroclaw. The workers
demanded, and within hours received,
a 60 percent pay increase.
The strike at Nowa Huta, which
employs 32,000 workers, began the next
day.
Friday, a defense plant at Stalowa
Wola in southwestern Poland, went on
strike. Workers decided to go back to
work the following day, apparently after
receiving a wage increase of about 50
percent.
Over the weekend, reports were cir
culating — mostly unconfirmed — that
other major industrial concerns would
issue strike alerts today and that other
workers across the country would begin
to demand equally substantial pay in
creases.
The government could give in to the
pay demands, but officials fear that is
suing wholesale pay raises could lead to
the kind of economic chaos that hit the
country in 1981, when shops' stocks of
merchandise were bought out and even
basic food commodities were in short
supply.
Giving in to "unjustified" wage de
mands, Jaruzelski said yesterday,
"would lead directly to the infamous
epoch of (having only) vinegar on store
shelves. We have gone through that al
ready."
Some Solidarity activists have been
saying in recent days that the new wave
of strikes could bring down the
Jaruzelski government, as it has brought
down Polish governments in the past.
