# Western ambassadors attend Moscow May Day parade
## 
### 
MOSCOW Ending a boycott that
began with the Soviet invasion pf Af
ghanistan in 1979, Western ambas
sadors yesterday appeared at Moscow's
May Day celebration in an atmosphere
of improved U.S.-Soviet relations.
The envoys, including Jack Matlock
of the United States and Bryan
Cartledge of Britain, stood in a spec
tators' area close to the Lenin
mausoleum.
From atop it, the ruling Politburo,
including Soviet leader Mikhail Gor

bachev and his more conservative
No. 2 man, ideology chief Yegor Ligac
hev, watched the massive parade.
Matlock said Washington had given
him the go-ahead to attend because
of the Soviet Union's announced in
tention to begin a troop withdrawal
from Afghanistan later this month,
and"in the spirit" of President
Reagan's planned trip to Moscow in
four weeks.
One diplomat said that since the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, West

ern diplomats had "found it con
venient to be elsewhere on May 1."
The posters on such occasions as
the May Day parade often tell a great
deal about political trends. This year
there were a few banners mildly crit
icizing apartheid policies in South
Africa, but unlike in past years, there
were no banners criticizing U.S. poli
cies.
Last year signs denounced President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
— or Star Wars, the space-based mis

sile defense program — and U.S. in*
volvement in Central America.
But yesterday one float carried a
picture of the intermediate-range nu
clear forces (INF) treaty signed in
Washington last December by Reagan
and Gorbachev, calling it "an example
of new political thinking."
Cartledge, however, said he was not
yet sure if he would attend the parade
marking the anniversary of the Bol
shevik Revolution on Nov. 7.
