## GALA Week for all 
### 
WHAT WOULD it be like if
what seemed normal to
you was considered
deviant by society?
This question and many others
will be asked as the Stanford gay
and lesbian community attempts
to heighten awareness, under
standing and acceptance of its cul
ture and history with this week's
annual Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week.
And if a week of well-planned
events succeeds in accomplishing
its goals, the gay and lesbian com
munity will have made great
strides. The Stanford community
should recognize the tremendous
opportunity the week provides to
continue breaking down any bar
riers that exist between itself and
the gay and lesbian community.
Thursday's Gay and Lesbian
Blue Jeans Day will address spe
cifically the opening question.
Members and friends of the gay
and lesbian community will be
wearing blue jeans in a show of
support for gay and lesbian aware
ness. We all should also don our
blue jeans and share the experience
of being a stigmatized minority.
Two other events during the
week seek to answer the question:
"What is the relationship between
the gay community and other mi
nority communities?"
The first event, the "Black and
Gay Communities" panel discus
sion, occurred last night at Ujamaa
House. Its goal was to examine the
sometimes tense relationship be
tween the black and gay commu

nities. Questions that were ad
dressed included racism in the gay
community and homophobia in the
black community. One of the dis
cussion's goals was to establish a
framework for future cooperation
between the groups in order to
enact social change.
The second event, a panel dis
cussion today on "AIDS: Perspec
tives from Minority Communi
ties," brings the gay and other mi
nority communities together with
the community at large by present
ing different perspectives on an
issue on everyone's minds: AIDS.
At the very least, this discussion
should dismiss the belief that the
acquired immune deficiency
syndrome is just a gay disease. It
affects us all.
The events of GALA Week and
the issues it raises are intended to
involve everyone. That's why there
is a free concert by Holly Near, a
singer and activist for gay and les
bian rights; that's why there is a
comedy night being put on at the
Coffee House; and that's why there
will be an open social at the Old
Firehouse so people can see for
themselves "what those gay and
lesbian people are up to up there."
GALA Week is now a 15-year
institution at Stanford and has a
history of its own. This year it
celebrates the 20th anniversary of
gay and lesbian activism at Stan
ford. And as long as gay and lesbian
people are discriminated against in
our society, GALA Week will be
there to help break down
stereotypes and promote under
standing.
