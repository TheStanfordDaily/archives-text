# University tests show no fiberglass danger
## 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
As far as managers are con
cerned, United Stanford Workers
concerns about fiberglass expo
sure in the press building mail
room no longer hold any water.
However, despite results of a
second air test conducted April 4
that appear to vindicate manage
ment claims that there is no haz
ard in the area, USW representa
tives are still protesting.
Understandably pleased by the

testing, which revealed almost
zero fiberglass exposure in all
areas of the building, mailroom
manager Chris Lundin said Fri
day, "Everything is back to nor
mal and everyone is back to work
now."
Lundin was referring to the sit
uation in March, when five of his
employees opted to work outside
the building, because they were
"worried about the possibility of
cancer," according to USW offi
cials.
All five employees have since

returned to work in the building.
But USW field representative
Nick .Jones charged Friday that
mailroom managers are "playing
games" with the workers by
taking air samplings instead of
addressing what he called the
"key" issue: faulty ceiling instal
lation of the insulation.
Tests for fiberglass exposure
were originally made in response
to union protests over a February
ceiling installation job done by
Coast Insulation. Although there
was an aluminum-foil backing on

the insulation, the end seams of
the foil were not tightly joined.
"They could have spent the
money and done it right by taping
up the ceiling with good strong
adhesive tape," Jones said. He
reiterated his claim that the USW
would soon take up a collection
and come in "to tape up the ceiling
ourselves."
After the fiberglass was in
stalled, some employees com
plained of upper respiratory, skin
and eye irritation. One employee
even said he found a strand of
fiberglass in his cup of coffee.
The first test results were far
below state and federal minimum
standards for fiberglass exposure,
but they weren't low enough for
USW representatives, who ac
cused University facilities manag
ers of "not caring about safety."
Where the USW saw negligence,
facilities managers saw nuisance
dust. Ralph Buchanan, acting
deputy associate vice president of
Administrative Services and Fa
cilities, thought all along that the
samplings were skewed by dust
left over from the original instal
lation job.
