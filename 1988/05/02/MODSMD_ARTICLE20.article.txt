## Minority groups work for unity in a hostile world 
### 
IT IS unthinkable that David
Kang's April 20 letter, titled, "Mi
nority groups are hyprocritical"
should remain unchallenged. The title
alone is a severly misguided blanket
accusation that, in one breath, dis
parages the efforts of all minority
groups on campus, many of which
work with and for minority children in
the surrounding areas.
But even more blatant than this
vandalizing statement is the basic lack
of understanding of the purpose of
minority groups apparent in Kang's
argument, a lack of understanding
which I believe pervades the entire
campus. He fails to realize that one of
the minority groups' main goals is to
foster unity in their respective commu
nities. Individuals alone cannot fight a
system. There is a definite strength in
a large number banding together for a
unified struggle.

Yet there are still those who claim
that the American "system" is fine and
that institutional practices of racism
have been all but completely erad
icated. I encourage these people to
reread the Constitution. Its framers
believed they had produced a "fine"
document, yet it blatantly denies an
entire sex all political rights and con
siders each individual of an entire race
to constitute only three-fifths a person.
By rising up and struggling together,
females and then blacks overcame the
limits of the Constitution and became
legitimate partakers in this society.
But not completely.
The same "American" consciousness
that created the Constitution still
exists today. This consciousness has
changed, though. It has expanded to
include the oppression, not only of
blacks, but also of Native Americans,
Chicanos, Latinos and Asian-

Americans, to name only a few. If this
consciousness did not still pervade our
society, then minority groups would
not remain trapped in the reservations,
ghettos and barrios of America.
Minority groups then, are not "self
righteous," as Kang accused. Rather,
they are self-affirming. They have no
other choice. They have been forced to
band together to assert their identity.
They have been forced to empower
themselves with a feeling of self-worth
and self-respect which American society
has stripped away from them. Until
black children born today know it is
beautiful to be black, and Chicanos
know that there is another future
except a life in a barrio, the work of
minority groups will not end.
I agree, as Kang said, that within
minority groups one of the goals
should be "diversity" and "openness to
differences." But right now, when

society itself remains hostile to such
groups, the most important goal is
unity. At a time when American soci
ety is attempting to disempower minor
ity groups, telling them that the only
way to success is assimilation, minority
groups must empower themselves with
a sense of purpose. They have the
right to expect respect for their unique
cultures.
I am sorry Kang feels he has to
defend dissenting opinions of minority
groups even though he himself is a
minority, but he should understand
the minority groups, especially the
Black Student Union, are constantly
being made to defend their reasons for
existence to the general public.
Everyone needs to comprehend that
the goal of minority groups is unity —
unity of struggle and purpose to posi
tively transform American society.
