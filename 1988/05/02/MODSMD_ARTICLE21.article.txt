# 'Vanna' not stupid

### 
Leslie Kaufman's April 26 column,
"Vanna a sign of times," poses some
interesting questions on the limitations
of the feminist revolution.
Obviously, it has not gone far
enough — we still aren't ready for a
female president. But why castigate
the way some females opt to reach
their goals? And really, does being
sexy, attractive and saying "may the
best man win" (concerning the presi
dential race) constitute brainlessness?
On the contrary, many women
realize (and sigh about) the lack of
female progress and the double stand
ards still being inflicted on our society.
Kaufman, and other women — includ
ing me — at Stanford have the fortune
of acquiring other tools for our per
sonal advancements; most women don't

have the chance. Some therefore opt to
work with the double standards and
use them to their benefit.
The point of "Vanna a sign of
times" is well taken, but if anybody is
to blame, it is the public at large and
not a particular woman. Equating sexi
ness, vulnerability and "dumb blonde"
images with brainlessness is undermin
ing how intelligent a woman may be.
(Besides, with an advance of
$250,000 on "Vanna Speaks" and up
to three product-endorsement offers a
week, I would be careful of depicting
her as brainless.)
Kaufman is right. Female advance
ment has not achieved what we would
like, but why coin as "brainless" those
women who make the double standards
of our society work to their advantage?
They obviously do not have the time,

patience or other tools to wait around
for the revolution.
