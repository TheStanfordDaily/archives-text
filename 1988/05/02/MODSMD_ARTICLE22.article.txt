What kind of student exchange high
lights a trip to Safeway? I was dis
turbed by the implications of the arti
cle about the Stanford-Soviet Exchange
Project and the Soviet students' visit
to Stanford.
As a member of the exchange proj
ect, I would like to share some of the
real highlights of the program.
The highlights were not the big
dorm events or the tourist trips; they
were the free time to sunbathe on

Wilbur Field and the discussions about
"girlie magazines" in the car ride to
San Francisco.
One of my most memorable experi
ences came at Phi Psi late one night. I
was lounging in a dorm room with
Sergei, Igor and Merry, intensely ques
tioning our press, our need for infor
mation and finally our military
defense. It became a discussion not of
Russian vs. American, but of four
friends dicovering similar feelings
about different political systems.
As Sergei and I walked to the car,
exhausted from thinking so hard, he
stopped me and said, "You know, Kim,
you are right. Getting to know people
in our two countries is a better
defense against war than building mili
tary (defenses). There are faces now,
on the American army."
