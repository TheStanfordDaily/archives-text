## A
						travesty of justice 
### 
ONE BY ONE, the justices enter
The Room, leaving their robes and
law clerks at the door. They
proceed slowly, silently, to their assigned
places around the thick oak rectangular
table. The chief justice opens his leather
folder and the debate over the nation's
future begins.
"The first issue on the agenda today,"
Chief Justice William Rehnquist an
nounces, "is whether we should strike
down all the civil rights laws as uncon
stitutional. All those in favor?"
"Bill, isn't that a little much for so
early in the morning?" chimes Justice
Antonin Scalia. "Shouldn't we save a few
to strike down after lunch?"
"Well, I figured we could do the civil
rights laws in the morning and concen
trate on the eradication of the right to
privacy in the afternoon. That way, we
could end early and William could catch
his afternoon nap," Rehnquist answers.
The octogenarian blood in Justice
William Brennan's face begins to boil as
he responds, "Ah, it's good to hear from
the Prophets of Judicial Restraint. When
the court upholds the rights of the poor
to health care, the illiterate to education
and the homeless to shelter, then we are
engaging in the satanic exercise of judicial
activism. But when we write opinions
allowing corporations to exploit the eco
nomy and the government to invade
people's personal lives, we are merely
following the original intent of the
Founding Fathers, right?"
"More specifically, the intent of the
white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant Fathers

— some of whom owned slaves and all
of whom owned women," adds Justice
Thurgood Marshall, the lone black pres
ence in The Room. "Maybe Bill and Nino
are right, however, in believing that the
14th Amendment was not passed to help
blacks nor other oppressed groups. Those
lines about equal protection and the
rights of life, liberty and property must
have referred to disadvantaged whites
and to overly regulated businesses."
"Thurgood, please," intellects Justice
John Paul Stevens. "We are trying to
keep the discussion intellectual, not emo
tional. We here agree that every individ
ual should not be discriminated against
on the basis of race ... ah, sex ... ah,
wealth — well at least race."
"And the Constitution prohibits
anyone, or at least anyone involved with
the state, from intentionally discriminat
ing against any person," insists Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.
"Do you really think, Sandy, that some
one who has a foot pressing on his throat
really cares about how that foot got there
and if the state's name is branded on
the foot?" questions Marshall. "He just
wants it off."
"Thurgood," declares Justice Byron
White, "it might seem very simple to you
but if that foot comes off to ensure proper
education, then the next thing you know
we've got to allow everyone to have jobs,
housing, food and medical care. That total
restructuring of society is socialism at
best, communism at worst."
"Communism, who mentioned commu
nism?" queries Rehnquist as he
scrambles for his copy of "The Federalist

Papers."
"Calm down Bill, it was just Byron off
on another one of his parade of hor
ribles," intercedes Justice Harry Black
mun. "The point Byron missed is that
this court sometimes has to lead the way
when Congress and the states won't. Just
look at Brown v. Board in education, Roe
v. Wade in abortion ..."
Sitting somewhat obscured in the cor
ner of the table, the newest justice, An
thony Kennedy, sheepishly raises his
hand. Blackmun stops speaking, all eyes
turning to Kennedy. Scaiia asks, "And
how does our Californian colleague feel
on this subject?"
"I have an answer. Instead of banning
all civil rights laws, why don't we just
reconsider the 1866 Civil Rights Act that
allowed private citizens the right to sue
other private citizens for acts of racial
discrimination. William, hand me a quar
ter. Heads we reconsider and break for
lunch, tails we leave civil rights laws
alone."
It was heads, and the justices had in
digestion at lunch that day.
