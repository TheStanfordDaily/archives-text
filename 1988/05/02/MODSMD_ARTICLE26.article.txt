## 'A Day in the Life of California' At Stanford 
### 
Friday, from 12:00:01
a.m. to 11:59:59 p.m.,
renowned photo-journalist
Michael Bryant saw more
of Stanford in 24 hours than
most students see in four
years. Bryant was one of
100 photographers assigned
to document "A Day in the
Life of California," the
latest book in the series that
has captured daily life in the
Soviet Union, America,
Japan and Hawaii.
Each photographer in
volved in the project was as
signed to a particular Cali
fornia region or event.

Bryant was the only pho
tographer covering Stan
ford. During his short but
intense time on campus,
Bryant shot 1,386 frames of
Kodachrome film to docu
ment an impressive array
of Stanford activities.
Pausing only to change
film, he photographed
events ranging from a Mos
lem meeting to a special per
formance of the Stanford
Band. His day also included
shoots of fraternity parties,
windsurfing on Lake Lagu
nita and, of course, the
newlv arrived Dead Heads.
