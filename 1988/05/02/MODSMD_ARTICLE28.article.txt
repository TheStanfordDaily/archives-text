# Men drop Big Meet; women defeat Bears
## 
### Ed Pike [Illegible] Staff writer 
"You win some arid you
lose some," the saying
goes. Saturday at Califor
nia the Stanford track
and field team did both,
as the women won a 74-
70 decision to take a 5-4

series lead and the men lost by a single
point, 82-81, to extend their losing
streak to Cal to 18 years.
The most dramatic race was the wom
en's 3,000 meters. Cal had come back
from a 20-point deficit to tie the score
at 65-65 after shutting out Stanford in
the 200 and the 400 hurdles. Stanford
had little chance in the final event, the
400 relay, but could clinch the win with
a first and second in the 3,000.
Stanford sophomore Carol Gray went
out strong and easily took her second
win of the day after winning the 5,000,
earning five points for each. Freshman
Mary Mendoza, who has struggled in
the 1,500, held on for second in what
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson said
"could have been the race of her life"
to clinch the victory, with freshman
Wendy Neely coming back from a
second-place finish in the 5,000 to com
plete a Stanford sweep.
The women throwers chalked up 27
points in the shot put, discus and javelin
when Cal conceded these events uncon
tested. After winning the shot put with
a throw of 51 feet, 4 1/2 inches, Stanford
junior Patty Purpur was hoping to throw
the discus 168-6 to qualify for the NCAA
Championship meet, having already
qualified in the shot put. Her best throw
equaled the mark without an inch to
spare. In the javelin, junior Erica

'The good breaks and
the bad breaks even
out. The Cal men have
a better dual-meet
team than we do.'
— Brooks Johnson

Wheeler led a sweep with a meet record
173-7.
The men's loss was especially tough
after so many years of frustration and
many close races that could have gone
either way, but Johnson refused to spec
ulate. "The good breaks and the bad
breaks even out. The Cal men have a
better dual-meet team than we do."
The meet was exceptionally close from
start to finish, and stood tied at 43-43
after 10 events. Cal, as expected, took
the sprints and hurdles, but fifth-year
senior Marc Oleson took both the 1,500
and the 5,000 to head Stanford's 31-5
dominance of the distance events.
In the 800, freshman David Strang
and senior Christian Skoog kicked down
Cal's David Ottaway, who was running
conservatively to rest for the 5,000
(though he only ended up placing fourth
in that event). Stanford also won the
steeplechase, with freshman Jason Mar
tin trading the lead with Cal's Andy
Walsh before pulling away for the win.
In the end, the contest came down to
the field events, as Cal accumulated a
narrow five-point advantage to offset
Stanford's performance on the track.

Besides leaping to second place in the triple jump Saturday, sophomore Vanessa
Henlon also dashed to a third-place 12.39 in the 100 meters against California.

Stanford had cut a Cal 76-64 ad
vantage, the largest lead either
side held, with a one-two finish
in the 5,000, down to five points
with the triple jump and 400 relay
to go. The Stanford team gathered
around the pit to cheer senior
Henry Green as he attempted to
beat Christopher Moorings' 47-8
mark set earlier in the day. His
final jump fell short, and Cal

clinched its 18th straight win.
Stanford Asst. Coach Scott
Chisam felt "we did about as well
as we could have. You can't start
saying one point makes a differ
ence." In particular, the Cardinal
took more distance points than
could have been expected, as Cal
has several strong distance run
ners, led by David Ottaway.
There were several close events
that went against the Cardinal.
Senior Brian Marshall and Jeff
Rogers both jumped 7-3/4 in the
high jump, but Cal's Rogers had
fewer misses and was awarded the

win. Freshman John Hopkins tied
for the third-place jump but was
edged on overall misses. Senior
John Gash had the same problem
in the pole vault, placing second
at 16-6.
The 400 was the closest track
event of the day. Freshman James
Cramton won in 48.41, while Dar
rell Armstrong, a Stanford fresh
man, was awarded third after a
photo finish with Mike Harper.
The Cardinal are now looking
to the Pac-10 Championships.
"We will beat them in the Pac-lOs
and the NCAAs," Chisam said.

Wheeler led a sweep with a meet record
173-7.
The men's loss was especially tough
after so many years of frustration and
many close races that could have gone
either way, but Johnson refused to spec
ulate. "The good breaks and the bad
breaks even out. The Cal men have a
better dual-meet team than we do."
The meet was exceptionally close from
start to finish, and stood tied at 43-43
after 10 events. Cal, as expected, took
the sprints and hurdles, but fifth-year
senior Marc Oleson took both the 1,500
and the 5,000 to head Stanford's 31-5
dominance of the distance events.
In the 800, freshman David Strang
and senior Christian Skoog kicked down
Cal's David Ottaway, who was running
conservatively to rest for the 5,000
(though he only ended up placing fourth
in that event). Stanford also won the
steeplechase, with freshman Jason Mar
tin trading the lead with Cal's Andy
Walsh before pulling away for the win.
In the end, the contest came down to
the field events, as Cal accumulated a
narrow five-point advantage to offset
Stanford's performance on the track.

Besides leaping to second place in the triple jump Saturday, sophomore Vanessa
Henlon also dashed to a third-place 12.39 in the 100 meters against California.

Stanford had cut a Cal 76-64 ad
vantage, the largest lead either
side held, with a one-two finish
in the 5,000, down to five points
with the triple jump and 400 relay
to go. The Stanford team gathered
around the pit to cheer senior
Henry Green as he attempted to
beat Christopher Moorings' 47-8
mark set earlier in the day. His
final jump fell short, and Cal

clinched its 18th straight win.
Stanford Asst. Coach Scott
Chisam felt "we did about as well
as we could have. You can't start
saying one point makes a differ
ence." In particular, the Cardinal
took more distance points than
could have been expected, as Cal
has several strong distance run
ners, led by David Ottaway.
There were several close events
that went against the Cardinal.
Senior Brian Marshall and Jeff
Rogers both jumped 7-3/4 in the
high jump, but Cal's Rogers had
fewer misses and was awarded the

win. Freshman John Hopkins tied
for the third-place jump but was
edged on overall misses. Senior
John Gash had the same problem
in the pole vault, placing second
at 16-6.
The 400 was the closest track
event of the day. Freshman James
Cramton won in 48.41, while Dar
rell Armstrong, a Stanford fresh
man, was awarded third after a
photo finish with Mike Harper.
The Cardinal are now looking
to the Pac-10 Championships.
"We will beat them in the Pac-lOs
and the NCAAs," Chisam said.
