# Fund to help individual athletic talent
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Known for its unparalleled suc
cess in intercollegiate sports, the
Stanford Athletic Department is
now taking steps to widen its
arena of competition.
Selected Stanford student
athletes like Olympic figureskater
Debi Thomas — who do not
receive athletic scholarships and
often do not compete on Stanford
teams — will soon be eligible to
receive University funds to com
pete at national or international
levels.
Providing assistance to these
"extra-collegiate" athletes was the
brainchild of sophomores Dana
Klapper and Suzanna Mak, who
organized the Athlete's Fund for
Individual Recognition with the
help of the Athletic Department.
The program, thought to be the
only one of its kind in the nation,
will be directed by a board that
will review applications from
student-athletes in need of finan-

Organizers said they
hope the program will
allow world-class ath
letes to attend Stan
ford and still cover
training costs.

cial support.
The AFIRE Board, which met
for the first time Thursday, is
comprised of KJapper, Mak, Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger, Club
Sports and Recreaction Director
Shirley Schoof, History Prof.
Carolyn Ixmgee and Bob Huff, di
rector of Financial Aids.
Geiger applauded the AFIRE
program, saying, "We're going to
try and find the means to support
special student talents in athletics
... similar to the way we're able
to do it on an ongoing basis for
our varsity athletes."

The program will assist under
graduate and graduate students
alike who have shown the ability
to compete successfully in a sport
not heavily funded by the Athletic
Department. Organizers said they
hope AFIRE will allow outstand
ing athletes like Thomas, cyclist
and speed skater Eric Heiden and
luger Bonnie Warner to attend
Stanford and still cover the costs
necessary to train for the highest
levels of competition.
Thomas, a junior, has stopped
out, while Heiden is a student at
the Medical School, and Warner
is a 1983 graduate in Humanities.
Mak said she and Klapper, who
both have competed as equestri
ans, came up with the idea this
winter. "We were trying to think
of a way ... we could find a source
to compete at the level of compe
tition we were used to, and we
couldn't find one," Mak said.
"The more we talked about it,
the more we found a need at Stan-
ford, and nationally," for such a
program.
After deciding to go ahead with
the program, Geiger set aside
$20,000 from a fund for student
recreation that had been left
unused for some time. Geiger said
he plans to raise money for the
project on an ongoing basis
through the department's office
of development.
Although AFIRE will benefit
only a few students, and few of
those will actually compete for
Stanford, Geiger said he feels the
program will become an impor
tant part of his department's ac
tivities.
"The idea is to support the stu

dent, not promote the Athletic De
partment," Geiger said, adding
that his philosophy is for the ath
letes to be "doing something for
themselves instead of 'competing
for Stanford.' "
While admitting that the pro
gram's future is uncertain, Geiger
said he thinks AFIRE is a good
idea. "I think it will enhance [the
school's reputation]. Debi Thomas
didn't compete for Stanford, yet
I think Stanford got mentioned a
few times" during the Winter
Olympics, he said.
The program may also serve as
a recruiting tool to encourage
world-class athletes to come to
Stanford. Although this possiblity
has not been discussed with the
Admissions Office, Mak said she
feels AFIRE may attract these
students.
William Tingley, associate dean

of Undergraduate Admissions,
had no knowledge of the program
but said it sounded like a "well
thought-out" plan. "I think that
we all enjoy seeing these excellent
students who also bring honor to
this institution through their
(athletic) accomplishments," he
3aid.
An orientation meeting will be
held Tuesday at the department
when athletes will receive appli
cations. They will be asked to sub
mit proof of athletic success in
their sport and a list of expenses.
The athletes and their budgets
will then be viewed by the board,
which will determine where to al
locate the funds. Although it is
too early to judge the interest
such a program will generate,
Mak said, "I would certainly hope
to pull in 50 applications for this
round."
