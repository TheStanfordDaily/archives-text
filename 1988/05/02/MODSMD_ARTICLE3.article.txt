# Fund to help individual athletic talent
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Known for its unparalleled suc
cess in intercollegiate sports, the
Stanford Athletic Department is
now taking steps to widen its
arena of competition.
Selected Stanford student
athletes like Olympic figureskater
Debi Thomas — who do not
receive athletic scholarships and
often do not compete on Stanford
teams — will soon be eligible to
receive University funds to com
pete at national or international
levels.
Providing assistance to these
"extra-collegiate" athletes was the
brainchild of sophomores Dana
Klapper and Suzanna Mak, who
organized the Athlete's Fund for
Individual Recognition with the
help of the Athletic Department.
The program, thought to be the
only one of its kind in the nation,
will be directed by a board that
will review applications from
student-athletes in need of finan-

The AFIRE Board, which met

Geiger applauded the AFIRE
program, saying, "We're going to
try and find the means to support
special student talents in athletics
... similar to the way we're able
to do it on an ongoing basis for
our varsity athletes."

The program will assist under
graduate and graduate students
alike who have shown the ability
to compete successfully in a sport
not heavily funded by the Athletic
Department. Organizers said they
hope AFIRE will allow outstand
ing athletes like Thomas, cyclist
and speed skater Eric Heiden and
luger Bonnie Warner to attend
Stanford and still cover the costs
necessary to train for the highest
levels of competition.
Thomas, a junior, has stopped
out, while Heiden is a student at
the Medical School, and Warner
is a 1983 graduate in Humanities.
Mak said she and Klapper, who
both have competed as equestri
ans, came up with the idea this
winter. "We were trying to think
of a way ... we could find a source
to compete at the level of compe
tition we were used to, and we
couldn't find one," Mak said.
"The more we talked about it,
the more we found a need at Stan-
