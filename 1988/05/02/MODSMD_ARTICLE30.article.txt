## Card loses all but luggage 
### Cameron Macky Editorial staff 
Ever go on a trip where
everything went wrong?
If so, then you can
sympathize with the
Stanford baseball team,
which traveled to Miami
over the weekend and

got swamped by the 12th-ranked Hur
ricanes. To start off, the Cardinal ap
parently lost its bats in an airport some
where, as the team dropped the first
two games of the series, 9-3 and 7-3,
mustering six hits in each game.
As if the losses weren't enough, the
weather was lousy. The third game,
scheduled for yesterday, was called be
cause of rain and will not be made up.
And to top it all off, Stanford's Troy
Paulsen, a sophomore, went hitless in
four at-bats Saturday night, bringing
his school-record 28-game hitting streak
to a screeching halt.

The Cardinal, ranked seventh by
Baseball America and 10th by ESPN in
last week's polls, now has a 31-19 record
and has dropped five of its last six
games. The team returns to action to
morrow at 2:30 p.m. against Pacific at
Sunken Diamond.
Friday night's game, the Cardinal's
sixth in seven days, was also the first
game in 12 years that Stanford played
without Coach Mark Marquess, who
was in Oregon to attend his sister-in
law's wedding. Asst. Coach Dean Stotz
ran the show, which quickly turned into
a horror show for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal scored the game's first
run in the top of the first when junior
Frank Carey led off the game with a
single and came around to score, but
the lead was short-lived.
The Miami hitters jumped all over
Stanford freshman starter Stan Spen
cer. Hurricane shortstop Jorge Robles
led off for Miami with a single, stole
second and came home when senior

leftfielder Mike Fiore tripled down the
right-field line.
It was the 61st RBI of the season for
Fiore, who entered the series with a
team-leading .410 batting average and
11 home runs. Fiore then scored on
right fielder Rey Noriega's grounder to
second to give the 'Canes a 2-1 lead.
The Cardinal tied the game in the
top of the second when senior catcher
Doug Robhins doubled and scored on
sophomore Brian Johnson's lined shot
off the glove of Miami pitcher Joe
Grahe. But the Hurricanes came right
back with two runs in the bottom of
the inning to take charge of the game.
Catcher Frank Dominguez led off
with a double and took third when third
baseman Rob Word singled. Henry Her
nandez put Miami ahead 3-2 with a
sacrifice fly that scored Dominguez, and
center fielder John Viera made the score
4-2 with an RBI single.

While Spencer was having
trouble taming the Hurricanes,
the Cardinal offense was having
woes of its own, as Grahe com
pletely stifled the Stanford bat
ters. After the three hits in the
first two innings, the team collec
ted only three more — including
sophomore Paul Carey's solo
home run in the fourth, which
extended his hitting streak to 15
games — the rest of the way.
Robles also helped shut the Car
dinal down with several excellent
plays at short.
Spencer, who had not fared well
in his two previous outings, was
finally chased in the third after
Fiore, who had reached on a
fielder's choice, scored on desig
nated hitter Will Vespe's double.
Junior Robbie Kamerschen got
Dominguez to end the inning on
a grounder to short, but then
began the fourth inning by yield
ing two singles and a triple to the
bottom third of the Miami batting
order.
Kamerschen settled down to
retire the next three batters, but
when the smoke cleared the
'Canes had run the score to 8-3.
The teams combined for only
five hits the rest of the way, with
Miami picking up its final run in

the seventh when Dominguez
doubled home Vespe, who had
tripled. All nine Miami starters
got as far as second base on the
evening, and eight of the nine had
at least one hit.
Paulsen kept his streak alive
Friday with a one-out single in
the eighth, one of only two hits
Grahe allowed in the final five
innings. Grahe, who ran his
record to 10-2, had been in a mini
jam in the seventh after Paul
Carey singled and Robbins
walked, but he calmly struck out
the next three batters. Grahe,
who appeared to grow stronger in
the later innings, ended the game
by striking out the side in the
ninth.
Stanford started Saturday's
game with a surprising switch in
starting pitchers. Instead of
senior Lee Plemel, the scheduled
hurler, Stotz had junior Steve
Chitren start the game on the
mound. Chitren, who usually
works as the Cardinal's main
relief man, had not started a game
in over a year.
The change "was something
we'd been toying with for a while
now," Stotz said. "We were just
waiting for a non-league series to
try it out. It's still a viable op
tion."
The switch apparently paid off
early, as Chitren gave up only one
run through four innnings. The
Cardinal took the early lead in

'We underachieved
with the bats.'
— Dean Stotz

the second after Robbins walked
and scored on a Johnson liner
that Word misplayed.
After Miami tied the game in
the bottom of the fourth, Stanford
came right back with two more
runs in the top of the fifth. Soph
omore Tim Griffin, starting at
designated hitter in place of senior
Jeff Saenger, led off with a single.
He was followed by freshman cen
ter fielder Mike Eicher, who also
singled. Frank Carey moved the
runners up with a sacrifice, and
after Paulsen struck out, Miami
starter Greg Knowles walked Ron
Witmeyer to load the bases.
Knowles then gave way to Dan
Bruckner, who was promptly
greeted by junior Ed Sprague,
who singled home two runs. The
hit — Sprague's first of the series
— gave the Cardinal a 3-1 lead.
With Sprague on first and Wit
meyer at third, Bruckner still had
his hands full, but he then came
up with a play that suddenly
ended the Cardinal rally. Bruck
ner threw to first to try to pick
off Sprague, but Sprague appar

ently got back to the base before
first baseman Hernandez applied
the tag.
The first base umpire signaled
that Sprague was safe, causing
the Miami bench to erupt, yelling
at the ump for several minutes
over what they thought was a
blown call. After an umpires' con
ference, the call was reversed:
Sprague was out, and the Cardi
nal was finished in the fifth.
The official explanation after
the game was that the first base
umpire's view of the play had been
"obscured," forcing the home
plate umpire to make the call.
From home plate, Sprague appar
ently had seemed out.
Miami didn't waste the break.
In the bottom of the inning, Word
singled, moved to second on a
sacrifice by Hernandez, and
scored on Viera's triple. After a
single by Robles, a triple from
Trujillo and a single from Fiore,
Miami was suddenly in control at
5-3. The Cardinal offense became
comatose once again, and solo
home runs by Vierra and Fiore
rounded out the scoring.
Stotz was blunt about the dif
ference in the teams' play. "Give
'em (Miami) credit for putting the
bat on the ball," he said. As for
the Cardinal's lack of offense dur
ing the two games, Stotz said, in
an understatement, "We under
achieved with the bats."
