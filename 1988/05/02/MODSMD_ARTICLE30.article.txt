## Card loses all but luggage 
### Cameron Macky Editorial staff 
Ever go on a trip where
everything went wrong?
If so, then you can
sympathize with the
Stanford baseball team,
which traveled to Miami
over the weekend and

got swamped by the 12th-ranked Hur
ricanes. To start off, the Cardinal ap
parently lost its bats in an airport some
where, as the team dropped the first
two games of the series, 9-3 and 7-3,
mustering six hits in each game.
As if the losses weren't enough, the
weather was lousy. The third game,
scheduled for yesterday, was called be
cause of rain and will not be made up.
And to top it all off, Stanford's Troy
Paulsen, a sophomore, went hitless in
four at-bats Saturday night, bringing
his school-record 28-game hitting streak
to a screeching halt.

The Cardinal, ranked seventh by
Baseball America and 10th by ESPN in
last week's polls, now has a 31-19 record
and has dropped five of its last six
games. The team returns to action to
morrow at 2:30 p.m. against Pacific at
Sunken Diamond.
Friday night's game, the Cardinal's
sixth in seven days, was also the first
game in 12 years that Stanford played
without Coach Mark Marquess, who
was in Oregon to attend his sister-in
law's wedding. Asst. Coach Dean Stotz
ran the show, which quickly turned into
a horror show for the Cardinal.
The Cardinal scored the game's first
run in the top of the first when junior
Frank Carey led off the game with a
single and came around to score, but
the lead was short-lived.
The Miami hitters jumped all over
Stanford freshman starter Stan Spen
cer. Hurricane shortstop Jorge Robles
led off for Miami with a single, stole
second and came home when senior

leftfielder Mike Fiore tripled down the
right-field line.
It was the 61st RBI of the season for
Fiore, who entered the series with a
team-leading .410 batting average and
11 home runs. Fiore then scored on
right fielder Rey Noriega's grounder to
second to give the 'Canes a 2-1 lead.
The Cardinal tied the game in the
top of the second when senior catcher
Doug Robhins doubled and scored on
sophomore Brian Johnson's lined shot
off the glove of Miami pitcher Joe
Grahe. But the Hurricanes came right
back with two runs in the bottom of
the inning to take charge of the game.
Catcher Frank Dominguez led off
with a double and took third when third
baseman Rob Word singled. Henry Her
nandez put Miami ahead 3-2 with a
sacrifice fly that scored Dominguez, and
center fielder John Viera made the score
4-2 with an RBI single.
