# Pac-10 tournament is the light at the end of men's golf tunnel

lhe end is near.
The Stanford men's
golfers, whose competi
tive season started in
early October, will play
their final tournament of
the season this week.

The linksters have shown steady im
provement over the season, especially
in the past month. The 54-hole Pacific
10 Conference Tournament at the
Orinda Golf and Country Club will be
their last chance to shine.
The 6,400-yard Orinda, Calif., course
will give the Cardinal a chance to show
off the two things it does best: putt
and keep the ball in the middle. Ac
cording to Coach Wally Goodwin, most
teams "know that distance is no factor"
and have been preparing accordingly.
The Stanford delegation of sopho
mores Brad Benbrook, Brad Joondeph,
Don Christensen, Mark Funseth and
Josh Zander, along with junior John
Mahon, has been working hard all week
to prepare for the short course. Goodwin
had them practice hitting three-woods
and pitching wedges. The team also
spent a lot of time in the sand traps
and on the putting green because the
short-game will be the deciding factor.
Since the Pac-10 is one of the
strongest conferences in the nation for
golf, the Cardinal will be up against
some serious competition. Both Arizona
and Arizona State have been vying for
top-ranked national status with Okla
homa State. The current rankings put
Arizona second in the nation and Ari
zona State third. In addition, USC and
UCLA are nationally ranked, and round
out the Pac-10's "Big Four."
"It will be a dogfight between the Big
Four," Goodwin said, but added that
the shortness of the course could put
a finesse team like Stanford in conten
tion for the title.
"Our team is the most psychologically
together, and in the heat of competition,
that makes the difference. The odds of
our doing well are a lot better than
they were a month ago," Goodwin op
timistically said, noting his team's im
provement. In its last three tourna
ments, Stanford significantly lowered
its scoring average and finished seventh
in two tournaments packed with na
tionally ranked powerhouses.
According to Benbrook, Stanford's
hottest player of late, the big hitters
on the UCLA and Arizona squads will
be hurt by the Orinda golf course be
cause it works against strong hitting.
He predicted that Arizona State's
Billy Mayfair, who finished fifth in last
year's tournament, would win because
he has mastered the short game. Last
year's tournament winner, Arizona's
Larry Silvera, will also be competing at
Orinda.
For Stanford, Benbrook could break
out of the pack. A different player has
emerged each week as the team leader,

but Benbrook seems poised to put to
gether three good rounds. "There are
a lot of birdie holes out there at Orinda,
and my putting at Phoenix (last week)
was as good as it's been," Benbrook
said. "I only missed one putt within 10
feet all week."

The golfers know that their chances
of going to the NCAA tournament are
slim. "Realistically, we'd have to win
the Pac-10 tournament to go," Mahon
said. But he added that the Cardinal's
chances of winning this week are not
as slim as its ranking indicates.
