# Men's crew grabs Big Jim Reynolds
## 
### Don Hogue Staff writer 
Since 1971, California's men's
crew teams have held a
stranglehold on the Big Jim
Reynolds Cup, awarded to the
winner of the Stanford-
California Big Row. That
streak came to an end yester-

day when Stanford's varsity men held off a
late surge to beat California for the first time
in 17 years in the annual dual regatta.
The conditions on the Oakland Estuary
were less than ideal Saturday. Unpredictable
winds and choppy waves forced regatta offi
cials to meet with coaches to decide whether
the races should be postponed. The men's
races were delayed until yesterday, but the
women decided to race a shorter course
against the current on Saturday.
Stanford and California rowed distinctively
different strategies in the men's varsity race
yesterday. California relied upon a series of

surges and flutter-strokes, but Stanford main
tained a consistent rhythm. Stanford built a
three-seat lead 1,000 meters into the race
that it never relinquished over the last half
of the race, winning by nearly a second. Stan
ford and California split the two other races
yesterday, with California taking the men's
freshman race and Stanford winning junior
varsity.
If the weather was playing favorites Satur
day, it definitely blew in the favor of the
California women's crew teams. Rowing with
a significant weight advantage into the strong
winds, California's junior varsity women beat
Stanford by nearly two boat-lengths over the
1,300-meter course. Stanford's varsity wasn't
as fortunate. The Card women, in a boat
thinned by illness and ii\jury, finished nearly
20 seconds behind California.
Earlier Saturday, Stanford beat California
in the men's novice four and the women's
novice eight but lost in the men's novice eight.
Boats began taking in considerable amounts
of water before officials decided to halt races

until meeting with coaches.
California men's coach Bruce Beall said this
weekend's conditions were typical of East
Coast regattas. "Having a regatta postponed
back East was a regular occurrence," he said.
"To my understanding this was the first time
in quite a few years here that a dual race
was postponed because of the conditions."
Stanford freshman Lance Suder, novice
four stroke, said the combination of strong
current and high winds made racing difficult,
if not perilous, for some of the crews. "It was
ridiculous to row (Saturday) — the wind was
pretty strong," added senior men's varsity
captain Craig Bouck.
However, Bouck said the decision to row
Sunday was ideal for Stanford's varsity. Com
ing off its first dual win against Washington
two weekends atro, the varsity was optimistic
— and hungry — for a victory over the Bears.
"Everyone knew that this year we had a
chance to win it. But to have both (varsity

and junior varsity) boats beat Cal
is unheard of. And to have it hap
pen at Berkeley was icing on the
cake," Bouck said.
The regatta concluded the dual
schedule for the men's crews, but
the women will face Santa Clara
next weekend. Later this month,
Stanford will travel to
Sacramento for the Pacific Coast
Championships at Lake Natoma.
