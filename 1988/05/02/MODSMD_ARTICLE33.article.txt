# Card netters wind Cal

### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
The wind was gusting furiously Sat
urday at California's Helman Stadi
um, and the Stanford women's tennis
team was almost blown off the court
early in its dual match against the
Golden Bears.
But the second-ranked Cardinal,

playing without its top singles performer, freshman
Tami Whitlinger, stormed back to clinch the match
in singles. Stanford's 6-3 victory in the regular
season finale gave the team a 23-2 record heading
into next week's NCAA championships. Fifth
ranked Cal finished 15-8.
"It was very dramatic to beat a team of that
caliber without Tami Whitlinger," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said, noting that the Bears were
"completely healthy."
Even more dramatic than the victory was the
Cardinal's comeback after losing five of the six first
sets in the singles. "They (the Stanford players)
weren't really revved up beforehand, and I think
part of that was my fault," Brennan said, adding
that his players had trouble adjusting to the wind
early in the match.
The Bears took a 1-0 lead when Sharon Fletcher
finished off senior Cari Hagey 6-2, 6-1 in the No.
6 singles. But the Cardinal sent the other five
singles matches to third sets.
Stanford freshman Teri Whitlinger and Jennifer
Prah had split sets when the two teams met earlier
this season, as had senior Kay Tittle and Alissa
Finerman. In that April 7 match at Stanford, Whit
linger and Tittle were victorious. Saturday was no
different.
Whitlinger, who has lost just once in a dual match
this season, rallied for a 4-6, 6-0, 6-2 victory over
Prah in the No. 2 singles, while Tittle beat Finerman
for the second straight time, 2-6, 6-3, 6-3.
After Stanford sophomore Lisa Green upended
Cal's Karen Shin 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the No. 1 singles
to give the Cardinal a 3-1 lead, the Bears had a

Golden opportunity to even the match heading into
the doubles action.
In the No. 5 contest, Kay Louthian had three
match points in the third-set tiebreaker, but Stan
ford junior Cindy Buchsbaum pulled out a 2-6, 6-2,
7-6 (8-6) victory.
Cal still had a chance to stay in the match, as
Jean Marie Lozano led Cardinal freshman Sandra
Birch 5-3 in the third set of the No. 3 singles. Birch
held her serve to make it 5-4, but Lozano served
for the match on a three-all point in the 10th game
of the set.
Lozano, who had been charging the net following
her serve throughout the match, decided to stay
back on this point. She eventually hit a slow back
hand that hit the top of the net and rolled back
on her side. Brennan said that Birch would have
had no play had the ball rolled over the net.
"Sandra got pumped up at that point," Brennan
said.
Birch won the next two games to post a 6-4, 6-7
(5-7), 7-5 victory that clinched the match and gave
the Cardinal a 1988 sweep of the Bears. Last season,
Cal won both times the schools met.
With the match already won, Brennan decided to
forfeit the No. 3 doubles. Buchsbaum and Teri
Whitlinger were scheduled to play Louthian and
Jill Barr, but Whitlinger has a muscle pull in her
left quadricep. Brennan said that Whitlinger would
have played had it been necessary.
In the No. 1 doubles, Birch and Hagey knocked
off Cal's Finerman and Tiffany Silveria, the Pacific

Junior Cindy Buchsbaum withstood three match points to survive at No. 6 singles, 2-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6)
against California's Kay Louthian.

pions, 6-3, 6-7, 6-3. The victory
was impressive, considering that
the Stanford pair had not played
together in over three weeks.
Lozano and Fletcher, the Pac
-10 runners-up, were 6-2, 6-2 win
ners over Tittle and Green in the
No. 2 doubles.
The Cardinal now has 10 days
before it begins the quest for a

third consecutive national title.
The NCAA championships begin
May 11 at UCLA, but Stanford
will not be involved until the fol
lowing day.
"I think the players are basi
cally where they want to be,"
Brennan said. "It's just a matter
of being healthy."
Brennan said that Tami Whit
linger, who has a pulled muscle
in her left groin, probably won't
start hitting again until Friday.
Junior Eleni Rossides is hitting,
but she is still questionable for
the NCAAs.
