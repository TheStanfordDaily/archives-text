# Clear some space in men's tennis trophy case
## All signs are go after 6-3 win 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
If the result of Fri
day's match is any
indication, start
preparing space in
Ye Olde Ralph
Rodriguez Club
house at the Stan-

ford Tennis Stadium for Stanford
men's tennis Coach -Dick Gould's
ninth NCAA championship
trophy in 19 years.
With an easy 6-3 win over Cal
ifornia in Berkeley, the No. 1 Car
dinal ended its regular season 10-
0 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
21-1 overall.
Both previous times Stanford
went undefeated in league play,
in 1978 and 1983, the Cardinal
captured the NCAA title.
Also like in 1978 and 1983, this
year's Stanford team is sparked
by a top freshman class. John
McEnroe was the prize recruit in
1978, John Letts, Dan Goldie, Jim
Grabb and Eric Rosenfeld the top
picks in 1983.
This season, David Wheaton,
Martin Blackman and Glenn
Solomon have made a similar im
pact on the Cardinal, helping to
turn around last year's disap
pointing 13-10 record. This
season's NCAA championships
are in Athens, Ga., May 20-28.
Though playing without
Wheaton, who is out with a minor
groin pull, the Cardinal clinched
the match after singles play. Only
sophomore Jeff Tarango, bowing

6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to Woody Hunt at
No. 1 singles, lost for Stanford.
"We're coming together well,"
Gould said. "In a match where
we could have let down, the guys
concentrated real well and did a
super job. The guys at No. 3, 4,
5 and 6 didn't even come close to
losing a set; they just took it to
them."
Cal is 12-13, 3-7 in Pac-10 play.
At No. 2 singles, senior Patrick
McEnroe played an outstanding
first set on his way to a 6-2, 6-7,
6-4 victory over Doug Eisenmann.
McEnroe, the nation's No. 10
player, improved his season
record to 26-8.
McEnroe was the only Stanford
winner to struggle, though, as
Blackman, sophomore Jeff
Cathrall, Solomon and sophomore
Barry Richards each won with
ease.
Blackman, at No. 4 singles, and
Cathrall, at No. 5 singles, have
been the most consistent winners
for the Cardinal this season and
had little trouble moving up a
notch against the No. 16 Golden
Bears.
At No. 3 singles, Blackman, the
No. 11 U.S. junior from Braden
ton, Fla., beat Kurt Streeter 6-3,
6-3 to extend his season record
to 25-6.
Blackman, a U.S. Junior Davis
Cup member, has improved
steadily since the start of the
season, beating USC's Eric
Amend, the nation's 24th-ranked
player, twice this month. He is

currently rated No. 59.
"Martin has done a great job
all year long," Gould said. "He
competed well Friday."
Cathrall, from Lakewood, Colo.,
ousted Carl Chang 6-4, 6-3 to im
prove his season record to 19-5.

At No. 5 singles, Solomon
upended Pete Fitzpatrick 6-3, 6-4.
After a midseason slump,
Solomon has been effective at his
regular No. 6 position recently,
besting UCLA's Goria Payes two
weeks ago in Los Angeles.

Barry Richards whipped Matt
Stroyman at No. 6 singles 6-3, 6-4.
In doubles play, Gould juggled
his lineup, moving Cathrall and
sophomore Eric Peus up from
their regular No. 3 slot to the No.
1 position, where they lost to

Hunt and Fitzpatrick 6-3, 6-4.
Tarango and Richards upended
Streeter and Eddie Marcum in the
No. 2 matchup, 7-5, 6-4.
At No. 3 doubles, Chang and
Stroyman bested Turbow and
Solomon 7-5, 6-4.



Lester Basl
Senior Patrick McEnroe has hit many a successful forehand in his regular-season match Saturday against California's Doug Eisenmann
Stanford career. The nation's 10th-ranked player won his final 6-2, 6-7, 6-4.
