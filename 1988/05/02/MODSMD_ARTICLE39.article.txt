# Stanford, UCSF control a new genetic monopoly
## 
### Jeff Album Staff writer 
Stanford and the University
of California gained a virtual
monopoly over critical gene
splicing processes last week as
they received the last of three
joint genetic engineering
patents.
The latest genetic patent,
granted last Tuesday, will en
sure that all commercial uses
of important recombinant DNA
methods are licensed — for a
fee — by Stanford's Office of
Technology Licensing.
The U.S. Patent Office in
Washington, D.C., issued the
first two patents in 1980 and
1984.
The technology was developed
jointly in 1973 by Genetics Prof.
Stanley Cohen of Stanford's
School of Medicine and Bio
chemistry Prof. Herbert Boyer
of UC-San Francisco. The proc
ess splices a desired gene into

a DNA molecule, creating a cell
"factory" that produces large
quantities of valuable biological
molecules.
"This is the most commer
cially significant technique
available on the market at this
time," said Katharine Ku, asso
ciate director of the licensing
office. She said that many
marketed products are produced
through the patented methods,
including human growth hor
mone, insulin, alpha interferon
and tissue plasminogen ac
tivator — which prevents blood
clots in heart patients.
Stanford's genetic engineer
ing licensing program will re
quire biotechnology companies
to pay $10,000 annually for use
of the technique, plus a 1 per
cent royalty on sales, according
to Ku.
Of $3.7 million in revenues
expected during 1988, 15 per
cent will go to Stanford's licens
ing office for administrative

costs, and the remainder will be
split between Stanford and the
UC system. Stanford's portion
will then be divided three ways
among the inventor, the Genet
ics Department, and the School
of Medicine — a sum approach
ing $500,000 for each.
Genetic engineering and
licensing arrangements are con
troversial among observers of
the scientific community.
Barry Katz, lecturer in
Values, Technology, Science and
Society, said there are both eth
ical and public policy concerns
about genetic engineering and
the patenting process. He called
the royalty-sharing system a
"Stanford tax" that is really a
"capitalistic interference" with
the pursuit of scientific knowl
edge.
He warned that safeguards
need to be developed so that
money brought to Stanford by
the research does not become a
"source of corruption."
