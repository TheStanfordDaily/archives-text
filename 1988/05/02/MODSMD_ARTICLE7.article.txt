# Minorities attack Law School policy

Revised guidelines to protect Stanford
Law School students from discrimination
by on-campus employment recruiters met
with loud criticism from minority groups
at a forum Friday.
The enforcement procedure for the Law
School's non-discrimination policy was
originally questioned last fall because it
did not establish steps to take when firms
are accused of discriminatory actions in
interviews on- or off-campus. A coalition
of Law School ethnic minorities, women,
gay and lesbian groups called the Multi
cultural Council spearheaded the reform
drive.
The new policy proposal completed two
weeks ago is a revision of interim proce
dures suggested in a December 1987 draft
that has been in effect since that time and
which partially addressed the council's de
mands.
According to Law Prof. Miguel Mendez,
chair of a school placement committee that
oversees on-campus recruiting, there are
two significant changes in the revised
policy. First, it provides for mediation in
cases of alleged discriminatory conduct in
volving a current Law School student. Sec
ond, it empowers the school's director of
career services to call for sanctions against
a company where such discriminatory con
duct has occurred off-campus.
The sanctions, to be determined on a

sions 'pathetic,' claiming
they do not address the
council's main concern.

case-by-case basis by an oversight commit
tee enforcing the policy, could include
publicizing the discriminatory conduct or
barring the employer from recruiting on
campus.
Multicultural Council representative
Peter Haviland called the revisions "pa
thetic," claiming they do not address the
council's main concern: that companies
recruiting on campus be effectively pun
ished if they are found to discriminate
against students on the basis of race, re
ligion, gender or sexual orientation.
According to Haviland, the council had
demanded — among other things — that
the Law School publish and prominently
display findings of companies' discrimina
tion as a deterrent against discrimination.
But Law Prof. Ellen Borgesen, a member
of the placement committee, said such man-
datory sanctions against discrim
inatory companies overly limit the
options of the oversight commit
tee. By not including mandatory
sanctions in the policy, the over
sight committee retains its
"flexibility," she said.
Haviland said, however, that it
is very likely students will organ
ize themselves to enforce their de
mands if the placement commit
tee does not accede to them.
David Cavicke, president of the
Federalist Society — a conserva
tive group of law students, pro
fessors and judges — said the
whole debate surrounding dis
criminatory interviews is "much
ado about nothing."
"It's another example of the
Law School injecting its leftist po
litical agenda into the private lives
of law students," Cavicke said.
The revised policy was pre
sented at a sparsely attended
forum at the Law School, during
which several audience members
suggested a variety of changes to

be included in the policy. These
included:
• That a woman or person of color
be included on the three-member
oversight committee;
• That a student monitor be se
lected to act as intermediary be
tween the complaining student
and the director; and
• That the one student represen
tative on the oversight committee
be elected by either the Law
School student body or Law
School minority groups.
The student representative is
currently chosen by the school's
associate dean for administration,
who also sits on the committee.
Another demand was that a stu
dent filing a claim be allowed to
attend meetings concerning his or
her grievance. "Even the lowliest
worker has a right to be present
at all grievance hearings," an au
dience member said.
Students also called for an as
sessment of problems at compan
ies where Stanford students have
worked in the past, as well as
barring from campus any em
ployer who refuses to affirm its
compliance with the policy.
