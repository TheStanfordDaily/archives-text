# 'Domino' transplant
## Med Center records a double heart switch 
### Dennis Lee 
For only the second time at the Stanford
Medical Center, surgeons have performed
a double transplant operation in which the
heart of a heart-lung recipient was trans
planted into a second patient.
The first such operation in the nation
occurred at John Hopkins University in
May 1987. This double transplant is
referred to as a "domino" transplant.
The operation was done on April 22 be
cause of the shortage of heart donors at
the time, according to Vaughn Starnes, the
head of Stanford's heart-lung transplant
program and one of the surgeons involved.
Ann Sellers, 41, of San Jose, received
the heart and lungs from Elizabeth
Strandlie, 45, of Kenai, Alaska, who died
at Stanford from an aneurysm, a sac
formed by a swelling in a weakened wall
of an artery. Seller's was then
received by Fleda Amaral, 57, of Eureka,
Calif. Starnes, who operated on Sellers,
said Friday that both Sellers and Amaral
were "doing very well." Both patients are
presently in stable condition.
Before operating on Sellers, surgeons
evaluated her heart through electrocar
diograms and clinical exams to ascertain
her suitability as a heart donor and found
her to be an appropriate donor for Amaral.

Explaining the double switch, Starnes
commented yesterday that "people have
been waiting for heart transplants for as
long as five months due to the inadequate
supply â€” for heart-lung transplants, as
long as eight to 12 months."
Three surgeons operated simultaneously.
Edward Stenson, a professor of cardiac sur
gery, removed the heart and lungs of
Strandlie. Starnes removed Sellers' heart
and implanted Strandlie's organs. Philip
Oyer, another professor of cardiac surgery,
performed the heart implantation on
Amaral. The entire operation took about
four to five hours.
Starnes stated that the chances of sur
vival for both patients in such an operation
is "excellent."
Sellers was a victim of bronchiectasis
since her childhood, a lung disease that
leads to the progressive deterioration of
lung tissue.
Amaral suffered from cardiomyopathy,
resulting in deterioration of heart muscle.
Amaral needed a heart with pulmonary
pressure about twice the normal rate to
work against high pressure in the pulmo
nary artery leading from the heart to the
lungs. As a consequence of her lung disease,
Sellers' heart worked with two to three
times the normal pulmonary pressure,
making the transplant almost ideal.
