# Jackson supporters select delegates
## 
### Scott Lyon Staff writer 
Chanting "Win Jesse Win,"
supporters of Democratic pres
idential candidate Jesse Jack
son held a caucus yesterday on
campus to select five prospec
tive delegates to the party's na
tional convention in Atlanta
July 18-21.
Two former Stanford stu
dents, one senior and Green
Library staff member were se
lected. A law student was cho
sen to be an alternate.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Keith Archuleta was the top
vote-getter, with 186 out of 250
votes. Two former Black Stu
dent Union chairs, Amanda
Kemp, a senior, and Steve Phil
lips, Class of 1987, came in
second and third respectively.
Woody Ichiyasu of Green Li
brary came in fifth with 76
votes, and law student Richard
Sommer was the second alter
nate.
Caucusing in Room 40 of the
Psychology Department, al
most 40 Jackson supporters
passed out fliers and gave short
presentations, sharing their
backgrounds, reasons for
joining the campaign and ac
tivities on behalf of the candi
date. Afterward, the crowd of
250 cast secret ballots for up
to five choices.
Giving the first presentation,
Phillips spoke of Jackson's
commitment to "opening up

America . . . for everyone.
That's why I support this cam
paign."
Supporters of Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis also held
delegate caucuses throughout
the state. Although the cau
cuses for U.S. Sen. Albert Gore
were canceled, some campaign
workers still gathered together
to celebrate the former candi
date's success.
Over 400 people attended the
Dukakis caucus, which was
held in Mountain View. Steve
Westly, a vice chair of the Cal
ifornia Democratic Party and
a former member of the Coun
cil of Presidents, was the
second-highest vote getter. In
addition, Martin Carnoy, pro
fessor of education and eco
nomics, was the fourth dele
gate chosen.
The delegates selected yes
terday will go to the convention
for the candidate to whom they
are committed, depending on
the proportion of the congres
sional district popular vote won
by the candidate in the Cali
fornia presidential primary
June 7.
The 12th Congressional Dis
trict, which represents Stan
ford, has been alloted five
delegates and two alternates
for the convention. So, for ex
ample, if Jackson wins 60 per
cent of the vote in the 12th
district on June 7, he would
get to send three delegates, and
Dukakis would get to send the
other two. These delegates would
then be committed to vote for
their candidate at the convention.
The location of the caucuses
reflects the different strategies
and attitudes of Dukakis and
Jackson.
The Jackson campaign, as Phil
lips pointed out, has traditionally
relied heavily on student support
and tends to focus on campus
groups. He said it was only fitting
that the caucus be held at a uni
versity site.
In contrast, the Dukakis cam
paign attracts more independent,
professional types, according to
junior Hugh Bethell, co-chair of
Students for Dukakis. As a result,
the local Dukakis organization in
tentionally decided to host the
caucus away from Stanford.
This approach upset junior Sub
odh Chandra, chair of the Stan
ford Democrats, who said the Du
kakis organization snubbed Stan
ford students.
"I'm unhappy with the ulterior
motives to exclude students from
the process by putting the site
relatively far off campus,"
Chandra said.
