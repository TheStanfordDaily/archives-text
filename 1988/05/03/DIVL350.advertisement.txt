I Fraternities aren't for everyone. And even if they are, Sigma Nu may not I
Ibe the right one for you. All fraternities represent something different, I
I and we encourage those who rush us to investigate all chapters to find I

I fraternity, not a club, of men, not boys, who operate by honor, not I
I expediency. Our existence came about in opposition to hazing, and still I
I today we simply won't tolerate it. If you find these principles to be of I
I interest, we invite you to rush Sigma Nu, and bring a strong tradition I
