(TO THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES theme):
Come on listen to my story of a rabbit named
Bink, Star of Life in Hell, a strip that makes you
think. Well one day Bink was feelin' kinda low,
So he came up wth the plan to make some
dough. Merchandising that is. Fun garb. Comfy
T's. Well the first thing you know the shirts
began to sell. Bink's kinfolk said: "This aint so
bad for Helll" They said: "Hooray for Callforny
and all its glam and glossl" So Binky paid his
rent and he stayed right there In Los. Angeles,
that is. Swimming pools. Obscure cartoonists.
