# ASSU to address housing policy
## Equal access sought for married gay and lesbian couples 
### Angle Kim Staff writer 
A bill to grant equal access to
University housing, facilities and
services for gay and lesbian cou
ples will be introduced in the
ASSU Senate tonight.
The bill is intended to promote
awareness of the fact that gay
and lesbian couples cannot legally
marry and are not granted the
privileges that married heterosex
ual couples receive from the Uni
versity, such as access to married
student housing, said Don
Gagliardi, the graduate senator
who authored the legislation.
A gay couple may consider their
relationship "marriage" in that
they have made a lasting commit
ment, sometimes symbolically
through marriage ceremonies,
despite the fact that gay marriage

is not legally recognized in the
United States.
Last year Stanford's non
discrimination policy was ex
tended to ban discrimination
based on sexual preference, but
even though that policy is broader
than the University's housing
policy, the housing rules have not
been changed to specifically state
that gay couples deserve the same
treatment as heterosexual cou
ples.
"Once there is public awareness
that the University is violating its
own non-discriminatory policy,
hopefully [Stanfordl will take in
itiative to change that," Gagliardi
said.
According to Patricia Pol
hemus, residential dean of
married students in Gscondido
Village, gay couples can get
married housing under present

University rules if they affirm
that their relationship is "a
marriage-like situation."
Polhemus said that she sup
ports the bill completely, and
added that the University is mov
ing toward complete equality be
tween legally married couples and
gay couples. Non-discriminatory
treatment of gay couples will be
written into the housing policy
next year, with or without the
ASSU resolution, she scud.
But Daniel Sternbergh, a first
year graduate student in engi
neering, said that Stanford does
not routinely apply the policy to
housing and facilities issues
"If Stanford is going to claim
to be non-discriminatory, then it
shouldn't adopt or apply discrim
inatory laws," Sternbergh said.
Gay students "have no option â€”
we can't get married ."
