Stanford Band members have raised
the necessary funds to ensure them
selves a trip "down under" this July to
participate in the World Expo '88 in
Brisbane, Australia.
According to Phil Cline, coordinator
of the tour project, Band members had
to raise $50,000 before they could be
certain of making the trip. Cline said
the group is committed to raising the
remaining $50,000.
Jon Sherman, assistant band mana
ger, said most of the funds have been
donated by Band alumni, though they
are currently targeting local businesses
and a few larger corporations.
Though the University has not of
fered monetary assistance to the Band
campaign, Sherman says it "has been
helpful in putting us in contact with
certain people, such as Band alumni."
In accordance with University fund
raising policies, the Office of Develop
ment has been keeping tabs on the Band
to ensure that it does not interfere with
Stanford campaigns. This policy is en
forced to be certain that internal fund

raising does not create a situation where
the University "shoots itself in the foot"
in pressing donors too much.
The cost per person is $1,600, and
each individual is responsible for $600
of those expenses.
Sixty-three band members will be
making the trip, including next year's
Dollies, Tree and Band director Art
Barnes, professor of music.
The Band will be in Australia between
July 3 and 19, performing in such areas
as the University of Melbourne, the
American Embassy in Canberra and the
Sydney Opera House.

was chosen over the University of

bands to represent the state of Califor
nia. The reason for the choice, he said,
was that the pavilion managers were
looking for a band that "truly repre
sented California in a sort of laid back,
wild and crazy style."
Not planning to change their style
for the Australian crowd, the Band will
be performing numbers similar to those
played at sporting events here. Accord
ing to Sherman, the Australians "will
be able to identify with the Band. . . .
They are friendly people."
William Thomas, who assumed the
Tree position this quarter, said he is
looking forward to the trip. "We like to
visit far off places and rally them."
