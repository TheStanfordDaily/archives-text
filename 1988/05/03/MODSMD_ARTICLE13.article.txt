JERUSALEM - Hundreds of Is
raeli troops swept into the army's self
proclaimed "security zone" in south
ern Lebanon yesterday, searching for
Palestinian guerrillas in their biggest
operation north of the border in more
than two years.
An Israeli army spokesman con
firmed the action, which he said was
"due to the growing number of ter
rorist attempts to infiltrate into Israel
for the purpose of committing murder
and terrorist attacks for (hostage) bar
gaining purposes."
Although the spokesman gave no
additional details, Lebanese and other
sources indicated that as many as
1,500 troops were involved in the ac
tion, which was centered in the eastern
sector of the security zone near the
point where the Lebanese, Syrian and
Israeli borders meet.
This area was the site of several
recent infiltration attempts into Israel,

including one April 26 in which an
Israeli battalion commander and an
other soldier from an elite army unit
were killed and two other troops were
wounded. Six Arab guerrillas also were
killed in that attempt, as was another
in the same area the next day.
In all, there have been at least a
dozen attempted infiltrations from the
north since Nov. 25, when a lone guer
rilla used a hang glider to cross the
border and attack an army base, killing
six Israeli soldiers before being shot
to death himself. At least 11 Israeli
troops have died along the northern
border in the last five months.
Beirut Radio reported late yesterday
that Israeli ships and airplanes were
taking part in the latest operation,
bombarding Lebanese villages in the
south. And United Nations sources
confirmed that there was "lots of il
lumination" along the Lebanese coast
both north and south of Tyre, which

is about 15 miles north of the inter
national border with Israel.
However, the sources said that U.N.
outposts scattered through much of
the more populous western portions
of the area had detected no other un
usual activity as of midnight local
time.
The last time the Israelis were
known to have crossed the border in
such force was in February 1986, when
they launched a six-day sweep through
the western sector to search for two
captured comrades and to punish their
abductors. By the end of the operation,
13 Lebanese had been killed, a dozen
wounded, more than 100 taken pris
oner and about 3,000 questioned.
Israel invaded Lebanon in June
1982, ostensibly to destroy a virtual
"state within a state" of the Palestine
Liberation Organization that had
taken root in southern Lebanon and
posed a constant threat to Israel's

northern settlements. Another goal of
the invasion, it was later confirmed,
was to install a friendly Christian
regime in Beirut that would make
peace with Israel.
While it succeeded in driving most
PLO fighters out of Lebanon, the ac
tion, which involved more than 15,000
troops, failed in its second purpose.
And by the time Israel finally
withdrew the bulk of its forces three
years ago, the Lebanon incursion was
widely perceived in the country as per
haps its most unsuccessful war.
As part of its withdrawal plan, the
army declared a strip extending as
much as 10 miles north of the border
to be a "security zone," over which
Israel would exercise military hegem
ony in cooperation with an allied,
mostly Christian militia known as the
South Lebanon Army.
