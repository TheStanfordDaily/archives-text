# Plans dropped to send Coast Guard to Gulf
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Penta
gon, facing stiff congressional op
position, yesterday dropped its
plan to dispatch six Coast Guard
cutters to join the Navy fleet
patrolling the Persian Gulf.
"The Department of Defense is
no longer considering sending
Coast Guard vessels to the Per
sian Gulf at this time," a state
ment issued by the Pentagon said.
At the same time, the White
House announced that President
Reagan would meet with Kuwait's
prime minister, Crown Prince
Sheikh Saad Abdullah Sabah, in
July. The main item on their
agenda will be the threats to the
small Persian Gulf state's security
raised by the eight-year-old Iran-
Iraq war, officials said.

A White House statement said
Saad had accepted Reagan's invi
tation to visit Washington July
10-14, his first official visit to the
United States.
Last July, the administration
agreed to Kuwait's request to
reflag 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers as
American vessels and provide
them Navy protection from
Iranian attacks.
In discussions with Reagan and
other administration officials,
Saad will probably press Kuwait's
requests for additional U.S. mili
tary equipment to strengthen the
country's defenses against
Iranian sea, air and missile
strikes.
