# Unrest spreads in Poland

WARSAW — The wave of labor unrest
in Poland spread yesterday to the Lenin
shipyard in Gdansk, the birthplace of
the free trade union movement
Solidarity, as workers went on strike
and closed the shipyard gates behind
them.
The exact number of striking workers
could not be determined immediately.
But Solidarity leaders in Gdansk said
workers on the shipyard's morning shift
began the action and appealed to em
ployees reporting for work in the after
noon to join them. They said about 3,000
out of 12,000 workers were participating
in the work shutdown inside the
shipyard.
Representatives of the Polish govern
ment, already faced with a strike affect
ing 32,000 workers at the country's larg
est steel mill at Nowa Huta in southern
Poland, confirmed that a strike was in

progress in Gdansk.
The Lenin shipyard workers appar
ently were responding to a plea issued
Sunday by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
for workers to show "solidarity with
Nowa Huta ... in your shipyards, in
your ports and in your factories."
Walesa, in a telephone interview, said
he had made two trips to the shipyard,
where he still works as an electrician,
to talk with the workers. He said he
told them his national responsibilities
in Solidarity, which is outlawed but still
active, prevented him from leading the
strike, but he declared his support for
their action.
The strike began after several dozen
Solidarity activists in the shipyard
marched around the yard and ended at
the main gate, where workers were
urged to stay off the job.
