# Pravda prints attack on Soviet government
## 
### 
MOSCOW — The Communist Party
newspaper Pravda published an ex
traordinary attack yesterday on the
way the Soviet Union has been
governed, declaring that after the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution the party evolved
into a frequently dictatorial and ter
rorizing force.
The article, displayed conspicuously
on the front page in the form of a
letter from a mid-level government of
ficial, called for a number of reforms
that are said to comprise part of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's platform
for a special June party conference.
The reforms include direct secret
ballot elections for regional party po
sitions, open debate at party con
gresses and limited terms for high
level posts.
The letter is the most detailed public

accounting to date of the ruling Com
munist party's historical failings and
the fullest published description of
how far the so-called "Gorbachev
Revolution" might go toward "democ
ratization," a frequently used term
here.
It was signed by V. Selivanov, a
party member and a senior official in
the Aviation Industry Ministry, but it
is an almost certain representation of
Gorbachev's own views, and it clearly
stakes out the Soviet leader's position
against possible conservative reaction.
The letter analyzed the party from
its beginnings, saying that after the
revolution, its "ranks began to be pen
etrated by elements foreign to it with
careerist intentions," and that the civil
war and Joseph Stalin's purges in the
1930s wiped out countless and valu

able party members.
Secrecy about party matters, the let
ter said, soon became the norm, forc
ing people to live double lives and cre
ating public and private moralities. At
the same time, the letter said, Stalin's
perversion of the party made it in
creasingly dictatorial, eliminating
debate and focusing all attention on
Stalin himself.
"The view was actively instilled that
each party member is its soldier and
it is for the leadership of the Central
Committee to decide the policy, to
define what is right and what is
wrong," the letter said.
"The view was instilled that the gen
eral secretary is always correct, that
his words are the final words of truth,
and therefore it is unnecessary for
anyone else to study or examine public

affairs. It is necessary only to quote
the leader."
The system merely stabilized but
did not change signficantly under
Stalin's successors, Nikita Khrushchev
and Leonid Brezhnev, the letter said.
Dictatorship and a lack of accounta
bility led to economic decline and the
creation of a "parasitic" class of
bureaucrats that did not take care of
the workers. An overall ethic of "every
man for himself' grew out of the sit
uation.
Then came a remarkable admission
for the party's own newspaper: "The
truth is that our errors and failings
are, in the first instance, the failings
of our party and the Central Commit
tee and each party member."
