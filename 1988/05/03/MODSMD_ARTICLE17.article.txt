North proud of his indictment
WASHINGTON - Retired Lt. Col. Oliver
North, in his first major public appearance
since being indicted in the Iran-Contra scandal,
declared yesterday that the charges against
him are "not a brand, they are a badge of
honor" and complained that he had been
vilified and subjected to slander.
Under scrutiny by congressional investigat
ing committees and independent counsel

Lawrence Walsh, the former
White House aide said he had
been forced to "endure the
largest investigation in the
history of our republic, an in
vestigation that has probed
every aspect of my profes
sional and personal life and
that of my family."
"My wife and children have
been placed in a crucible of
uncertainty," he said.

The 35-minute speech before a com
mencement-day audience at the Rev. Jerry
Falwell's Liberty University in Lynchburg,
Va., provided a vintage display of North's
oratorical skills and revealing insights both
into his view of the charges against him and
into the motivations that drove his zealous
support for Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
Dressed in an academic gown and standing
in front of a 600-square-foot American flag,
North said he was facing criminal charges
only because he was "caught in the middle of
a bitter political dispute between the Congress
and the president over the control of foreign
policy."
Pete Rose suspended for 30 days
NEW YORK — Cincinnati Reds Manager
Pete Rose was suspended yesterday for 30
days for "forcefully and deliberately shoving"
umpire Dave Pallone in what National League
President Bart Giamatti called one of the worst
manager-umpire disputes in recent memory.
The suspension was believed to be the
longest for a manager since Leo Durocher of
the then-Brooklyn Dodgers was suspended for
the entire 1947 season by Commissioner
Happy Chandler for "incidents detrimental to
baseball." Durocher allegedly had associated
with gamblers.
Rose, who underwent arthroscopic knee sur
gery yesterday, was not immediately available
for comment.
Because any suspension of more than 10
days can be appealed, Rose has the right to
ask for reconsideration of the decision, which
also included an undisclosed fine of "a sub
stantial amount."
He will probably be replaced on an interim
basis by Tommy Helms, a coach who has taken
over in the past when Rose has been absent.
Giamatti also said he had summoned two
Cincinnati broadcasters, Marty Brennaman
and Joe Nuxhall, to New York for "inciting
the unacceptable behavior of some of the fans"
after Pallone's ninth-inning decision led to the
winning run in the New York Mets' 6-5 win
over the Reds.
