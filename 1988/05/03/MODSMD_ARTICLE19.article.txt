## A 						dangerous path 
### 
THE STANFORD research
machine is on the brink of
breakdown. Runaway indi
rect research costs are threatening
to handcuff Stanford's research
abilities.
Indirect costs are costs and ex
penses not directly associated with
actual research efforts. These costs
typically include maintenance, ad
ministration, support and
depreciation expenses. The costs
of research equipment and supplies
are direct research costs.
The increasing indirect cost rate
in and of itself is not the problem.
But when indirect costs rise and
federal research dollars remain
fixed, the amount of money avail
able for actual research is
diminished.
This situation leaves professors
with two choices: They can apply
for indirect charge exempt grants,
or they can freeze or cut back their
direct research costs. These two
choices are tantamount to suicide
for many faculty members and for
the University's research reputa
tion.
If indirect costs are left un
checked, the faculty will have to
devote more time to raising re
search money. This will limit the
amount of time faculty members
can devote to teaching. Stanford's
reputation as a premier teaching
university would be damaged.
Students themselves will suffer
if government agencies decide to
withdraw their research funds
from Stanford as a result of
runaway indirect costs.
students will lose opportunities to
gain valuable experience working
on research projects, as the na
tion's top research professors may
be attracted to other universities.
Of the two feasible solutions
from the March Faculty Senate
task force report, one is clearly
unacceptable.

That solution — which would
require indirect costs to be spread
uniformly across all departments
— is simply ignoring the problem.
In fact, this solution would make
things worse. Why should the Clas
sics Department be charged for the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment's costs?
This "overhead-for-all" solution
presumably aims to keep indirect
costs down by taxing some faculty
so that they pressure their col
leagues to keep their expenses in
line.
Polarizing the faculty and pit
ting them against each other is
not the answer.
The second solution suggested
by the task force, placing a cap on
indirect costs, may work for the
short term. Until an adaquate plan
for long-term research is drawn
up, this will have to do.
However, the real solution to the
cost problem is this: University re
search management needs to be
improved. Eliminate interdepart
ment research duplication and en
courage cooperation among depart
ments.
More importantly, the Univer
sity needs to adhere to a policy of
sustainable and rational growth.
Stanford seems tb W hellbent
on being the No. 1 university m
all aspects of academia. The Uni
versity wants to keep research
volumes increasing. At the same
time, the University insists on
huge construction programs. The
facilities construction expenses, in
particular the Near West Campus
project, contribute most to the in
direct research costs.
The University's policy of bigger
and better, faster and farther will
not work and is not necessary.
Stanford is not in the "University
Olympics." There are more
reasonable ways to build a world
class university.
