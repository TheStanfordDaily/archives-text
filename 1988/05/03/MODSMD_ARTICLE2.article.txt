# CIV provision could violate faculty rights
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
A central provision of the newly adopted
Culture, Ideas and Values program may
violate official rights and privileges of fac
ulty members, a Medical School professor
said last week.
Carlos Camargo, an associate professor
of medicine, said in a speech to the Faculty
Senate Thursday that one line in the final
CIV legislation should be reconsidered be
cause it contradicts the Faculty Handbook,
a statement of University policy regarding
faculty members.
He said the CIV legislation calls for the
provost to choose members of the Area
One Committee — faculty and students
who will oversee the new CIV courses —
by "taking into account «uch factors as
gender, ethnicity, academic discipline, and
field of expertise." The handbook, however,
prohibits members of academic committees
from being chosen based on ethnicity and
gender, Camargo said.
The Handbook, which Camargo calls the
"constitution of the University," states that
"the assignment of teaching and other pri
marily academic responsibilities (and) any
other granting or withholding of benefits
or imposition of burdens shall be made
without regard to ... an individual's race,
ethnic origin, sex or religion."
This rule is part of the "Statement of
Academic Freedom," adopted by the Board
of Trustees in 1974.
Camargo said he would like to see the
committee appointment provision of the
CIV legislation changed to replace "eth
nicity" and "gender" with "interest in the

program."
The Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees will consider Camargo's state
ments and make a report before the end
of the quarter.
Camargo said he believes using ethnicity
as a criterion for appointment to the Area
One Committee is wrong because "ethnicity
is not relevant to the acquisition, diffusion
and transmission of knowledge, which are
the functions of the University."
"Champollion did not have to be Egyp
tian, or Tocqueville American, to make
contributions to the understanding
of these cultures," Camargo said. "Knowl
edge, expertise and interest are the only
factors that matter."
Camargo said that changing the CIV leg
islation to adhere to the Faculty Handbook
would not affect the substance of the leg
islation in a major way. He stressed, how
ever, that the violation of the Faculty
Handbook is "a matter of principle" and
added that the senate should not be allowed
to tamper with it.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, chair of the
Faculty Senate's Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies, said the current wording of
the CIV legislation "accurately reflects the
way we (the University) do business."
He said the wording of the legislation
"guarantees a representation of viewpoints
from all corners of the University" on the
Area One Committee.
According to Heller, earlier language in
the CIV proposal, calling for a "balanced"
Area One committee, was rejected by the
CUS as too quantitative.
Both Heller and Camargo
agreed that even if the legisla
tion's wording is changed, the se
lection process will remain the
same. Heller said the provost, who

appoints Area One committee
members, will continue to take
into account factors of race and
sex but will not make these
criteria the exclusive basis for his
decision.
University Provost James
Rosse said he "didn't see anything
restrictive in the way the (CIV)
language was there."
Camargo said he had tried to
bring his criticism to the senate
floor before CIV was passed
March 31, but he said there was
not enough time to discuss it
before the vote.
