## Soviet-Stanford student exchange reduces conflict 
### 
Last Tuesday the visiting
Soviet students from the Univer
sity of Novosibirsk held a ques
tion and answer session. On Wednes
day Edward Teller gave a presentation
on SDI. What a contrast in approaches
to U.S.-Soviet relations! As a visiting
professor engaged in research on U.S.-
Soviet relations at the Hoover Institu
tion, I should like to comment on
these different approaches.
It would be naive to believe that the
profound ideological differences be
tween the two sides will disappear
simply by having American and Soviet
students meet and talk to one another.
But personal contact, at every level
from summit meetings of political
leaders to meetings between students

or ordinary citizens, is of major impor
tance in defusing the ideological con
flict and humanizing the relationship.
When the enemy is a hostile abstrac
tion — an "evil empire" or "capitalist
warmonger" — it is conceivable to fire
off nuclear weapons against him. But
when the "enemy" is known in per
sonal terms, such as the Novosibirsk
students, it seems an obscene idea to
contemplate their incineration by
American nuclear missies.
Soviet-American exchanges of every
kind — cultural, educational, political,
trade, tourism — have considerable
potential to make peaceful co-existence
possible, especially with Mikhail Gorba
chev in office in the Soviet Union, a
Communist with a human face.

Edward Teller, by contrast, offers
the approach of a technological quick
fix. Even Teller concedes, however,
that a leak-proof SDI is an unlikely
development. Moreover, if either side
deploys SDI, the other side will inevi
tably take counter measures to over
come it, and so the arms race will
spiral futher upwards at colossal cost,
leaving neither side more secure. Also,
deployment of SDI will appear threat
ening to the other side, suggesting
preparation of a possible first strike,
and thereby make more difficult an
improvement in the political relation
ship.
Edward Teller, at the age of 80, is,
with all due respect, an embodiment of
the past, of the eve of Stalin. The

Stanford-Novosibirsk student exchange
embodies the future, the eve of Gorba
chev and post-Reagan America.
The past is filled with gloom. The
future promises brighter hope.
