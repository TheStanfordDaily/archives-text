# Guarantee funding for minority groups
## 
### 
The fact that the Black Student
Union may be denied funding in the
recent elections proves one thing for
certain: Funding for minority groups
on campus should be guaranteed and
not subject to a vote by the mtyority
white Stanford community.
"But that's anti-democratic! It's
reverse discrimination!" To these
charges I say, "Right on!" Democracy
has maintained the racial caste system
in America for 200 years. Bourgeois
democracy means democracy for the
oppressors and dictatorship over the
oppressed.
The BSU, and other minority groups
whose fee requests were passed by the
narrowest margins yet seen, were dealt
this lesson in the last elections. Scared
by the increasing Black and Latino
"militancy" on campus (the black bal
loons. the walk-out on Secretary of

State George Shultz last year, the at
tack on Western Culture, the anti-
Reagan raps in White Plaza, the grape
boycott), liberal voters who had always
ensured that minority groups got their
funding deserted them in droves when
they saw that these groups were begin
ning to overstep the carefully defined
bounds of bourgeois democracy that
constitute "acceptable" political behav
ior.
In two recent letters in The Daily,
charges were made against minority
groups. On April 20, David Chanoong
Kang charged minority groups with
"self-segregation," and on April 29,
Richard Voyles claimed that they were
"guilty of supporting (in reverse) the
exact same closed-mindedness that they
are fighting against."
This "reverse discrimination" line
presupposed equality where none
exists; it glosses over the differences in
status between classes and nationali
ties. The fact that in America everyone
is (in theory) "equal before the law"
cannot hide the glaring differences in
wealth or the rich-white-male composi

tion of the government, industry and
the media.
The oppressed know that their free
dom can come only at the expense of
the freedom of the oppressor.
The militancy of the masses often
forces the ruling class to make conces
sions to this "anti-democratic" concept
by giving special consideration to op
pressed nationalities through affirmi
tive action or welfare. But these are
only concessions necessary to maintain
the stability of the caste system over
all.
As the approaching world crisis in
tensifies, oppressed nationalities will
find that their demands will have to
become increasingly anti-democratic in
order to combat the attacks against
them.
The Stanford elections, Secretary of
Education William Bennett's attacks on
Cultures, Ideas and Values and the
recent Supreme Court decision against
civil rights show that at least one sec
tion of the ruling class is already
trying to roll back the gains made in
the 19605.

We must not be afraid to "alienate"
the oppressors. On the contrary, by
unflinchingly upholding our demands
in the face of right-wing opposition, we
will win over new people, neutralize
others and firm up the support of
those who are already on our side.
While many liberals deserted the BSU,
the students who continued to vote for
it now stand by the BSU more solidly
and consciously than ever before.
The author of the April 29 letter,
Voyles, wrote, "Change occurs in one
of two ways: revolution or evolution.
Revolution is good only if you don't
have to live together tomorrow. Evolu
tion will not happen without mutual
understanding."
The oppressed do not want to come
to a "mutual understanding" with
their oppressors nor do they want to
"live together tomorrow" with them as
master and slave. They want to put an
end to oppression. This is just what
most liberals are scared of.
