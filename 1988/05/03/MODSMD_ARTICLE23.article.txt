## Democrats hear you 
### 
IT APPEARS that at last the field of
candidates has narrowed, and barring
some upset in Atlanta this summer,
Vice President George Bush and Gov.
Michael Dukakis should be battling it
out for the highest office in the land
come November.
While these two men are poles apart
on the political spectrum, if press ac
counts are to be believed, they seem to
share many of the same personal char
acteristics. After all, the same adjectives
have been used to describe them both —
consistant, solid, uncharasmatic and
(let's be honest) deadly dull.
But voters and avid election freaks
needn't be dismayed. While in the coming
months we can't hope to be enchanted
by the sharp wit or endearing stories of
the candidates, we can hope that in the
absence of stellar personalities to carry
them through, the new focus for the
upcoming election could be, dare we say
it, issues and parties.
The public as candidate consumers will
be forced to look beyond the fancy pack
aging and take stock in the ingredients
and the company name — what party,
they will ask, has the standards, outlook
and goals that best reflect mine?
This is a good thing (if you are a Dem
ocrat, that is.)
The Republicans carried the last two
elections with landslide numbers, but
they did so on the sheer popularity of
Ronald Reagan, not because his
troglodytic conservative agenda was
really supported by the masses.

Quite the contrary, poll after poll
showed that Americans generously en
dorsed giving federal funds to many of
the social programs whose budgets the
Reagan administration and its appointees
were ruthlessly cutting. In fact, the Re
publicans, caught in the righteousness of
the Reagan "mandate," ignored public
discomfort with their brutally forceful
foreign policy and penny-pinching social
cuts — that's why they lost the Senate
in 1986.
This Republic indifference is also part
of the reason the Democrats remain the
party of the people in numbers — re
member the majority of registered voters
and elected officials in this country are
Democrats.
However, the main reason the the
Democrats have and deserve majority
support is that they have always been
the progessive party. A quick comparison
makes it obvious why the Democrats
should be the voters' choice for 1988.
• The first federally controlled plans to
take care of the elderly and the poor
were instituted under Democratic admin
istrations. And currently, the Democrats
are the ones pulling strongest for com
prehensive federal plans to deal with
AIDS and the homeless crises.
• Democrats have stood strong for laws
preserving the environment when the Re
publicans have been following the
Reagan/Wattian theory of chop-and
exploit-as-much-as-possible-because-
the-apocalypse-is-near for dealing with
our precious natural resources.
• On the campaign trail George Bush has

been repeating the old Republican ac
cusation that Democrats spend too much.
He, being attached to an administration
that managed to triple the federal defecit
in the past eight years, should know thut
the Republicans too are capable of un
restrained spending. At least the Demo
crats have the class to spend the money
for programs to help the needy poor in
stead of allocating it to the already
bloated coffers of the Pentagon.
• Most significantly the Democrats have
stood at the forefront of the civil rights
movement. Their commitment to
equality stands in sharp contrast to the
Republicans, who accept change only
when pushed. Conservative Reagan ap
pointees to the Supreme Court chillingly
signaled last week that they are consid
ering overturning the 1976 Runyon v.
McCrary decision that was a vic
tory for the advancement of civil rights.
Bush has been running on the promise
that he'll continue the Reagan revolution,
but it wasn't the revolution that won
the 1980 and 1984 elections; it was
Reagan. Let's hope that becomes clear
to the Republicans next November.
