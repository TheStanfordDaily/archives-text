## Readers question Bug's whale measurements 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
Dear Bug,
It was not long ago that on the
PBS channels the mating of the
whales that travel to southern
waters was being televised. These
whales, while large, do not reach
the dimensions of the blue whales.
However, your surmise of 10 feet
is not in the ballpark. Looks to
me like your guess is a phallus-sea
(pun intended).
— Harold

Hey you,
Regarding your column of April
26 — Kurt Vonnegut, in his novel
"Breakfast of Champions," delves
into the dimensions of the sexual
organs of male aquatic mammals,
among other things. Therein, 1
believe that he claims that a typ
ical blue whale is endowed with
a six-foot, one-eyed garden snake.
What makes your facts more ac
curate than his, seeing as he is
an award-winning novelist and
you have to ask other people for

your material?
— Wise in the ways of science
First of all, buddy, most of us
ceased using the phrase "one-eyed
garden snake" when we hit junior
high. Yet somehow, based on the
rest of your observations, it is not
in the least bit surprising that it
remains in your vocabulary.
Second, on page 147 of "Break
fast of Champions" Vonnegut
says, and I quote, "The blue
whale, a sea mammal, had a penis
96 inches long and 14 inches in
diameter." If you will apply your
rudimentary arithmetic skills to
this problem you will realize that
this equals eight feet, not six.
Third, Vonnegut may be an
award-winning novelist, but when
it comes to actual scientific facts
you'd be far better off listening
to the The Bug instead of a fiction
writer. My statistics came from
"Whales" by E.J. Slijper, and
"The Natural History of the
Whale" by L. Harrison Matthews.
Referring to the penis of the blue
whale, the former says,"It can
be as long as 10 feet with a
diameter of up to one foot," while
the latter says,"It may be over
10 feet long."
Fourth, if you will go and get
your copy of last week's column
you will notice that my statistics
were in fact for "your large male
blue whale." The average Balae
noptera Musculus may indeed
have an eight-foot attachment;
the large blue whale, as the above
excerpts show, is endowed with
at least 10 feet.
It's obvious that the two of you
could use continued assistance in

coming to terms with the facts,
or facsimiles, of life, so please con
tinue sending your questions to
The Bug at Bug-Me (not B.Bug-
Me) at the tragedies on LOTS, or
send them to Bug Me, Stanford
Daily, Stanford, CA, 94305.
Dear Bug,
Why did they take down the
Rodin statue in front of Meyer
Library?
— Gearhead
Dear Bug,
About a month ago, Rodin's
Balzac scupture was carted away
from its home in front of Meyer.
He was replaced by grass, which
does not seem to me an adequate
substitute. Whatever happened to
him, and will we ever get another
statue for the front of Meyer?
— Art Lover
The world-famous Balzac sculp
ture by Auguste Rodin had been
at Stanford for two years courtesy
of the Los Angeles County
Museum. It offered the statue as
a loan to Stanford while it built
a new wing in the museum to
house the piece.
Having finished the wing, the
museum asked for the statue to
be returned; it went bye-bye dur
ing spring break.
Albert Elsen, professor of art
and coordinator of statue logistics,
says he hopes we soon will find
a replacement for the bare spot
in front of Meyer.
Now I certainly appreciate art,
but let me just add that I never
actually stopped to look at the
statue during its tenure at Stan

ford. In my opinion, art, like the
sun and my ex-girlfriend, can of
ten be appreciated without
looking directly at it.
Dear Bug,
Is it true that if our professors
are 10 minutes late to a class we
have the right to leave and not
expect to have class that day?
— Ten minutes and I have no
class
What do you mean "have the
right to leave?" The last time I
checked we were all living in a
free country, and the only thing
actually preventing us from
leaving class is the fact that the
rows of chairs in most classrooms
are three inches apart.
What you have done here is
brought up another one of those
Great Myths of the 20th century,
falling into the same category as
"If my roommate dies I get
straight A's" and "Darryl Hannah
can act." Unfortunately, this one
lies in the gray area known as
Nobody Will Give The Bug A
Definitive Answer, which means
that we will have to extrapolate.
According to University
Registrar and Cruise Director
Sally Mahoney there is no written
policy dealing with professor
tardiness. Nor, she offers, is there
any common understanding that
students and professors adhere to.
This, she says, is because profes
sors showing up late to class is
not a frequent occurence.
The University ombudsperson
suggests that in cases where a
professor might be late the situ
ation is more or less governed by

the majority rule. For instance, if
the entire class gives up and goes
home after 20 minutes it would
be pointless for the professor to
punish them all by holding class
anyway.
I would think that mere polite
ness would dictate that you give
the professor more than 10
minutes before you decide to
leave. Trying to incite the entire
class to scram when the clock
strikes 9:10 may not endear you
to everyone in the room.
So, if you should ever be in a
situation where the professor is
10 or 15 minutes late, and there
is scheduled to be some material
that you can't afford to miss —
a final exam, for instance — it
looks like the best thing to do is
either convince the whole class to
leave in unison or stick it out to
the bitter end.
Hey Bug,
Did that oh-so-clever person
who wrote that oh-so-cute poem
to the admissions staff (in the
classified ads), you know,"I know
my chances are slim / For me this
is no whim," actually get in?
— Oscar the Grouch
That oh-so-clever person is
freshman Katrina Karkazis of Oc
cidental College, a double major
in French and Political Science.
She didn't apply to Stanford as a
freshman because she didn't
think she could get in.
"Grade-wise I'm not a genius,"
she says, which is why she put
the poem in the classifieds, hoping
it would show her creative side.
John Bunnell, associate dean of

undergraduate admissions, says
that such stunts do not impress
the Admissions Office. The staff
is much more interested in a stu
dent's academic and extracurric
ular achievements than their abil
ity to devise clever rhymes. Often,
in fact, such frivolous extras can
bias the admissions staff against
a student, he said.
Applicants have sent everything
from high heels (to get "a foot in
the door") to a life-preserver to
fresh corn to a cake with "Stan
ford '88" frosted across the top.
One student took the photos of
the admissions officers' faces that
are sent to applicants and made
a mural, trying to anticipate what
their bodies would look like. £
Another student paid $72 $o
send original artwork to the ad
missions staff. "It was awful,"
said Bunnell.
Also, high school senior Mark
Haber put an advertisment in The
Daily earlier this year thai
screamed "Let Me In" at the ad
missions staff. The Admissions
Office will not comment on
whether they did, in fact, let him
in. If anyone knows his fate give
me a ring.
But getting back to Katrina,
transfers won't find out about
their fate for another few weeks,
and Bunnell said that he hadn't
seen nor heard about her ad in
The Daily. It looks (horrors!) like
her fate will be decided on aca
demic merit alone.
The Bug will keep y'all posted.

Bug Me appears every Tuesday to
explore the dark recesses of the
human experience on this planet.
