# Deputy D.A. criticizes Stanford's lenient expulsion policy

### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Stanford's reluctant use of expulsion
to penalize students found guilty of
serious crimes has provoked criticism
from a county attorney involved in last
month's arrest of a Stanford senior on
burglary charges.
Palo Alto Deputy District Attorney
Lance Beizer said he was "shocked" and
"concerned" to learn that senior Jose
Fernandez, who was arrested April 14
for allegedly stealing nearly $60,000
worth of Stanford Bookstore merchan
dise, might not be expelled if he is found
guilty of the crime.
University Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole said that in similar prior cases of
theft from non-University businesses,
students have generally faced suspension

rather than expulsion. Cole said the Uni
versity in recent years has chosen to
avoid expelling students in cases of phys
ical assault, theft and property damage.
Such offenses violate Stanford's Fun
damental Standard, a student code of
behavior.
Instead, in such cases Stanford tends
to rely on "indefinite suspension," a
penalty that usually involves a two-year
suspension with the subsequent right to
petition for an earlier return to campus,
according to Student Affairs Administra
tive Assistant Nadine O'Leary.
Cole said the University's preference
for suspension over expulsion is in ac
cordance with its goal to educate and
rehabilitate. "Stanford has always
stressed education over punishment," she
said. Cole said she believes Stanford
handles suspended students with the at

titude that "if you persuade us you have
learned from your mistakes, you can
come back."
Beizer disagreed. To not expel Fernan
dez, if he were to be found guilty of a
felony, would be irresponsible and
"bizarre." To merely suspend Fernandez,
Beizer said, would imply that "anyone
can take a class in Western Culture (at
Stanford as long as they have the cash."
"We are not talking about someone
desperate to get food," he said. "We are
talking about someone who may have
stolen $20,000-30,000 worth of merchan
dise. I think he would shame the Stanford
community, rather than [Stanford wan
ting! him there," Beizer said.
Beizer, who has not been in contact
with the University on this issue, said
his objection to the expulsion policy is a
philosophical one. "The policy, if it cannot

deal with [the Fernandez
easel, is too weak; it
needs to be rethought,"
Beizer said.
Cole, who strongly
supports the University's
policy, said she cannot
comment directly on the
Fernandez case because
she has not yet familiar
ized herself with the

facts of the case and will not begin her
own investigation until the police have
finished theirs.
However, she did say that because the
theft did not take place in a University -
or student-run store, the University
penalty may be less severe.
"There is a strong tendency to impose
harsher penalties in cases where stu

dents' misconducts have adversely af
fected other students," she said.
Cole speculated that the Fernandez
case may be treated "equivalent to thefts
from Macy's or the Emporium, which
are left to the courts."
In the six years she has held the po
sition of Judicial Affairs Officer, only one
student has been expelled for violations
of the Fundamental Standard. This case
involved seven different counts of Fun
damental Standard violations, including
forgery, theft from students and off
campus misconduct.
The two-sentence standard, written in
1906, is intentionally broad so that it
can effectively be applied to a great va
riety of situations, Cole said. "The appli
cation changes in response to University
policy," she said.
