## Men struggle to 8th after 1st day at Pac-10s Benbrook ending year with a bang 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
The Show-Me State's legacy in Stanford
golf is not extensive but it is prestigious.
Back in 1971, Stanford Indian senior Tom
Watson, who hailed from Kansas City, Mo.,
took the collegiate golf world by storm and
went on to become the premier player on
the pro tour. Sophomore Brad Benbrook
was only three years old at the time.
Nearly a generation later, Benbrook is
successfully following in his fellow Mis
sourian's footsteps. He is still young and
has yet to dominate any tournaments, but
he has the potential and the personality
to be one of the great ones.
The men's golf team is a young but very
well-balanced group this year. Each week,
a new golfer emerges as the team's low
scorer. Sophomore Mark Funseth took his
first outright tournament victory in Feb
ruary, sophomores Chris Weyand and Mike
Hubly led the team at the John Burns
Invitational in Hawaii, sophomore Don
Christensen was Stanford's best in Pasa
tiempo, Calif., and sophomore Brad Joon
deph was the team medalist at his home
course in the Stanford/U.S. Intercollegiate.
So where was Benbrook all this time?
The sophomore from St. Louis battled
an illness all winter and did not play in a
tournament until the Stanford tourney last
month. Even after not playing competi
tively for over three months, he managed
to finish third for the team, with a re
spectable score of 225 (75-72-78) for three
rounds.
Two weeks later, at the talent-packed
Sun Devil Invitational at Phoenix, Ariz.,
Benbrook led the team with a two-round
total of 149 (73-76), an amazing feat con
sidering he is not yet at full strength fol
lowing his illness.
Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin likes to
call Benbrook "Jimmy Stewart" because
"he has a pulse rate of about three and
he doesn't get real excited about anything."
Goodwin says that Benbrook's mechanics
are "average for a Division I golfer," but
that he is "way above average spiritually."
Perhaps it is Benbrook's Midwestern
constitution that makes him such a patient,
persevering player. Goodwin said that
Benbrook's perseverance and conservatism
contributes a lot to the team, especially
since most of the players are from the
West Coast. According to Goodwin, the
Californians tend to "put things off because
the weather will be just as good tomorrow."
But, in the Midwest, he says, "you get it
done today because the weather will be
even worse tomorrow."
Benbrook gets a lot back from his team
mates as well. They were very supportive
of him when he was getting over his illness.
According to Goodwin, in his first year at
Stanford, this year's linksters are "more
like a team than any I've ever coached."
Over the course of this year, Benbrook
has matured both on and off the course,

'Just because you're a nice
guy doesn't mean you don't
want to beat (their) brains
out.'
— Brad Benbrook

Goodwin said. He "has a much better time
and has learned to take defeat much bet
ter."
Benbrook said he chose Stanford when
he "got the acceptance letter and saw how
many people they had turned down," and
realized what a privilege it would be to
play college golf in such an academically
stimulating environment. In high school,
he was junior state champion of Missouri
three years running, and was recruited by
the University of Missouri. Ironically, it
was Missouri's coach who suggested that
Benbrook consider Stanford.
He agrees with Goodwin's assessment of
the team's supportive character, but
Benbrook added that there is a good deal
of competition among the team. "While we
support each other, we all try to beat each
other and be the best on the team," he said.
Last summer, Benbrook lived out the
dream of amateur golfers across the coun
try. He qualified for the U.S. Amateur
tournament in Jupiter, Fla., and played
Jay Siegel at the nationally prominent
Jupiter Hills Course. Siegel, who won the
tournament two years ago, and has been
voted amateur of the year many times this
decade, is considered one of the premier
golfers in the United States.
And Benbrook rose to the challenge. He
stuck with Siegel through the front nine,
turning one hole down in match play. How
ever, on the back side he bogeyed three
holes in a row and lost the match three
and-two.
According to Benbrook, Siegel was "a
gentleman but not that nice a guy" during
the match. He said that his own style is
not quite the same during a competitive
match. "I like to have a good time with
the players in my group. Just because
you're a nice guy doesn't mean you don't
want to beat (their) brains out."
Christensen said that Benbrook is "very
energetic but intense" on the course. "Brad
doesn't hit it out of play too often and is
real solid. He worked hard this summer
and showed up ready to go in September,"
he said.
The man that the team calls "Walter"
for no apparent reason should go far in
the world of golf. According to Goodwin,
Benbrook has "all the ingredients to be a
great player, especially his ultra-good atti
tude."
Once he recovers to full strength, which
should be very soon, Benbrook could be
the star on a team full of very solid players.

A short golf course can be a great
equalizer. Talented teams with a lot
of big hitters can lose their edge,
while other teams with good short
games can emerge from virtual
obscurity.
Unfortunately, Stanford was not

the team to emerge yesterday in the Pacific 10
Conference Championship at Orinda, Calif. Wash
ington, which has had a good season but has won
no tournaments this year, is leading the tournament
by the surprisingly wide margin of five strokes over
Arizona, the nation's second-ranked team.
At the conclusion of the first round, the scores
were much higher than would be expected for the
short (6,400-yard) Orinda Golf and Country Club
Course. Washington topped the field with a team
total of 366. It was followed by Arizona at 371 and
Arizona State at 379. California, playing on its
home course, is firmly in the middle of the pack
with 381. Both USC and UCLA, which have
dominated the Pac-10 golf scene for years, turned
in surprisingly poor performances for nationally
ranked teams. They stand fifth and sixth with 385
and 386, respectively.
Stanford had difficulty at the Orinda course on
which it had played so well only three weeks ago.
The Cardinal is a disappointing eighth, with a team
total of 390 strokes for the first 18 holes.
Considering that Stanford sophomore Mark Fun
seth shot a 3-under-par 69 at Orinda only three
weeks ago, one would expect the talented Pac-10
field to match or better that score this week.
Remarkably, no one did.
The individual medalist in the first round was
the Bears' Tom Kennaday, who shot a 2-under-par
70. Two Washington golfers, Todd Tidke and Scott
Whaley, carded 71s and stand second. Arizona's
Mike Springer, who won the Fresno State Classic
and was low amateur at the PGA's Tuscon Open,
is fourth with a 72.
Stanford's best effort was sophomore Brad
Benbrook's 3-over-par 75. The other Cardinal
linksters performed well overall, but each seemed
to have trouble on one or two holes to inflate their
scores. Sophomore Brad Joondeph had double
bogeys on the relatively easy first and 14th holes.
Otherwise he was only 1 over par and shot 77.
Sophomore Don Christensen was 5 over par on
back to back holes on the front side, but hung in
for a 79, as did junior teammate John Mahon.
Rounding out the Stanford scorers were sophomores
Josh Zander and Mark Funseth, who shot 80 and
82, respectively.
Quite obviously, the course did not just lay down
and die Monday. Unlike three weeks ago, when the
course played relatively easily, Orinda showed its
claws in the first round.
Stanford coach Wally Goodwin said the course
was much more difficult than anyone could have
expected. "They definitely did the right thing
making this into a true championship course where
really good shots are rewarded and poor shots are
penalized," he said admiringly.
Goodwin hypothesized that his team played much
better Monday than it did three weeks ago, but
that the course was many times more difficult.
Hopefully, as they get more acquainted with the
more difficult look of Orinda, the linksters will turn
in better scores.

energetic but intense" on the course. "Brad
doesn't hit it out of play too often and is
real solid. He worked hard this summer
and showed up ready to go in September,"
he said.
The man that the team calls "Walter"
for no apparent reason should go far in
the world of golf. According to Goodwin,
Benbrook has "all the ingredients to be a
great player, especially his ultra-good atti
tude."
Once he recovers to full strength, which
should be very soon, Benbrook could be
the star on a team full of very solid players.

A short golf course can be a great
equalizer. Talented teams with a lot
of big hitters can lose their edge,
while other teams with good short
games can emerge from virtual
obscurity.
Unfortunately, Stanford was not

the team to emerge yesterday in the Pacific 10
Conference Championship at Orinda, Calif. Wash
ington, which has had a good season but has won
no tournaments this year, is leading the tournament
by the surprisingly wide margin of five strokes over
Arizona, the nation's second-ranked team.
At the conclusion of the first round, the scores
were much higher than would be expected for the
short (6,400-yard) Orinda Golf and Country Club
Course. Washington topped the field with a team
total of 366. It was followed by Arizona at 371 and
Arizona State at 379. California, playing on its
home course, is firmly in the middle of the pack
with 381. Both USC and UCLA, which have
dominated the Pac-10 golf scene for years, turned
in surprisingly poor performances for nationally
ranked teams. They stand fifth and sixth with 385
and 386, respectively.
Stanford had difficulty at the Orinda course on
which it had played so well only three weeks ago.
The Cardinal is a disappointing eighth, with a team
total of 390 strokes for the first 18 holes.
Considering that Stanford sophomore Mark Fun
seth shot a 3-under-par 69 at Orinda only three
weeks ago, one would expect the talented Pac-10
field to match or better that score this week.
Remarkably, no one did.
The individual medalist in the first round was
the Bears' Tom Kennaday, who shot a 2-under-par
70. Two Washington golfers, Todd Tidke and Scott
Whaley, carded 71s and stand second. Arizona's
Mike Springer, who won the Fresno State Classic
and was low amateur at the PGA's Tuscon Open,
is fourth with a 72.
Stanford's best effort was sophomore Brad
Benbrook's 3-over-par 75. The other Cardinal
linksters performed well overall, but each seemed
to have trouble on one or two holes to inflate their
scores. Sophomore Brad Joondeph had double
bogeys on the relatively easy first and 14th holes.
Otherwise he was only 1 over par and shot 77.
Sophomore Don Christensen was 5 over par on
back to back holes on the front side, but hung in
for a 79, as did junior teammate John Mahon.
Rounding out the Stanford scorers were sophomores
Josh Zander and Mark Funseth, who shot 80 and
82, respectively.
Quite obviously, the course did not just lay down
and die Monday. Unlike three weeks ago, when the
course played relatively easily, Orinda showed its
claws in the first round.
Stanford coach Wally Goodwin said the course
was much more difficult than anyone could have
expected. "They definitely did the right thing
making this into a true championship course where
really good shots are rewarded and poor shots are
penalized," he said admiringly.
Goodwin hypothesized that his team played much
better Monday than it did three weeks ago, but
that the course was many times more difficult.
Hopefully, as they get more acquainted with the
more difficult look of Orinda, the linksters will turn
in better scores.

Sophomore Brad Benbrook shot a 75 to lead the Cardinal yesterday
In the first round of the Pac-10 Championships. Benbrook hopes
to follow in the footsteps of fellow Missourian and former Stanford
player Tom Watson.

The Show-Me State's legacy in Stanford
golf is not extensive but it is prestigious.
Back in 1971, Stanford Indian senior Tom
Watson, who hailed from Kansas City, Mo.,
took the collegiate golf world by storm and
went on to become the premier player on
the pro tour. Sophomore Brad Benbrook
was only three years old at the time.
Nearly a generation later, Benbrook is
successfully following in his fellow Mis
sourian's footsteps. He is still young and
has yet to dominate any tournaments, but
he has the potential and the personality
to be one of the great ones.
The men's golf team is a young but very
well-balanced group this year. Each week,
a new golfer emerges as the team's low
scorer. Sophomore Mark Funseth took his
first outright tournament victory in Feb
ruary, sophomores Chris Weyand and Mike
Hubly led the team at the John Burns
Invitational in Hawaii, sophomore Don
Christensen was Stanford's best in Pasa
tiempo, Calif., and sophomore Brad Joon
deph was the team medalist at his home
course in the Stanford/U.S. Intercollegiate.
So where was Benbrook all this time?
The sophomore from St. Louis battled
an illness all winter and did not play in a
tournament until the Stanford tourney last
month. Even after not playing competi
tively for over three months, he managed
to finish third for the team, with a re
spectable score of 225 (75-72-78) for three
rounds.
Two weeks later, at the talent-packed
Sun Devil Invitational at Phoenix, Ariz.,
Benbrook led the team with a two-round
total of 149 (73-76), an amazing feat con
sidering he is not yet at full strength fol
lowing his illness.
Stanford Coach Wally Goodwin likes to
call Benbrook "Jimmy Stewart" because
"he has a pulse rate of about three and
he doesn't get real excited about anything."
Goodwin says that Benbrook's mechanics
are "average for a Division I golfer," but
that he is "way above average spiritually."
Perhaps it is Benbrook's Midwestern
constitution that makes him such a patient,
persevering player. Goodwin said that
Benbrook's perseverance and conservatism
contributes a lot to the team, especially
since most of the players are from the
West Coast. According to Goodwin, the
Californians tend to "put things off because
the weather will be just as good tomorrow."
But, in the Midwest, he says, "you get it
done today because the weather will be
even worse tomorrow."
Benbrook gets a lot back from his team
mates as well. They were very supportive
of him when he was getting over his illness.
According to Goodwin, in his first year at
Stanford, this year's linksters are "more
like a team than any I've ever coached."
Over the course of this year, Benbrook
has matured both on and off the course,

'Just because you're a nice
guy doesn't mean you don't
want to beat (their) brains
out.'
— Brad Benbrook

Goodwin said. He "has a much better time
and has learned to take defeat much bet
ter."
Benbrook said he chose Stanford when
he "got the acceptance letter and saw how
many people they had turned down," and
realized what a privilege it would be to
play college golf in such an academically
stimulating environment. In high school,
he was junior state champion of Missouri
three years running, and was recruited by
the University of Missouri. Ironically, it
was Missouri's coach who suggested that
Benbrook consider Stanford.
He agrees with Goodwin's assessment of
the team's supportive character, but
Benbrook added that there is a good deal
of competition among the team. "While we
support each other, we all try to beat each
other and be the best on the team," he said.
Last summer, Benbrook lived out the
dream of amateur golfers across the coun
try. He qualified for the U.S. Amateur
tournament in Jupiter, Fla., and played
Jay Siegel at the nationally prominent
Jupiter Hills Course. Siegel, who won the
tournament two years ago, and has been
voted amateur of the year many times this
decade, is considered one of the premier
golfers in the United States.
And Benbrook rose to the challenge. He
stuck with Siegel through the front nine,
turning one hole down in match play. How
ever, on the back side he bogeyed three
holes in a row and lost the match three
and-two.
According to Benbrook, Siegel was "a
gentleman but not that nice a guy" during
the match. He said that his own style is
not quite the same during a competitive
match. "I like to have a good time with
the players in my group. Just because
you're a nice guy doesn't mean you don't
want to beat (their) brains out."
Christensen said that Benbrook is "very
energetic but intense" on the course. "Brad
doesn't hit it out of play too often and is
real solid. He worked hard this summer
and showed up ready to go in September,"
he said.
The man that the team calls "Walter"
for no apparent reason should go far in

Benbrook has "all the ingredients to be a

tude."

should be very soon, Benbrook could be
