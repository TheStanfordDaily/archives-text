# Card hopes to tame Tigers
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Things can only get better for the
Stanford baseball team. After losing
its last three games in a row and
five of its last seven games, the Car
dinal, ranked eighth nationally by
Baseball America and 10th by
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, will look

to rebound today against the University of the
Pacific and this weekend against California.
Stanford plays the Tigers at 2:30 p.m. today at
Sunken Diamond, then takes on the Golden Bears
in a three-game Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division series that begins Friday at Evans Diamond
in Berkeley. The Cardinal, 31-19 overall and 14-10
in conference play, closes the Six-Pac season at
home against USC next weekend.
With six conference games to play, the Cardinal's
chances of retaining the Six-Pac title are slim. First
place Arizona State swept UCLA in Tempe, Ariz.,
last weekend to improve its conference record to
19-8, 3V2 games ahead of second-place Stanford.
The Sun Devils' magic number is now down to one,
meaning that any one Stanford loss or one ASU
win would clinch the league title for the Sun Devils.
Arizona State is idle this weekend, and closes it3
Six-Pac schedule against last-place Arizona in Tuc
son, Ariz., next weekend.
So the Cardinal will be trying to hold on to second
place as it faces third-place Cal (14-13 in the con
ference) this weekend and fourth-place USC (12-12)
next weekend. At least three and possibly four Six-
Pac teams probably will be invited to NCAA regional
tournament play.
"These last eight games are very important to
us not only because six are conference games, but
because we need to establish some momentum
heading into the regionals," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said.
The Cardinal has been up and down all season.
"We haven't been putting our whole game together
lately," Marquess said. "We've had games where
we hit the ball real well, but our pitching has been
missing, and vice versa."
Over the last six games, Stanford's pitchers have
given up an average of nine runs and 12 hits per
game. The offense, meanwhile, sputtered against
Miami over the weekend. After reaching double
figures in hits in 15 straight games, the Cardinal
could muster only six in each of the two games
against the Hurricanes (a 9-3 loss Friday and a 7-3
loss Saturday).
Card notes
Fresno State, which beat Stanford 6-5 last Wednesday
to extend its winning streak to 29 games, has moved into
the top spot in both national polls, passing Oklahoma
State, which dropped to No. 2 after holding the No. 1
spot all season. Arizona State remains at No. 3.

Shortstop Troy Paulsen has been getting it done at the plate as
well as In the field for Stanford. The sophomore is currently hitting
.350 after having a 28-game hitting streak snapped last weekend
in Miami against the Hurricanes.
