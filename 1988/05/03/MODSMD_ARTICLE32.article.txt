The Orioles finally ended their losing
streak, but unfortunately their win came
at the expense of former Stanford ace
Jack McDowell. The O's rocked Mc-
Dowell for five runs in six innings to
hand him his second loss of the year
against one win.

McDowell entered the season as one
of the most highly touted rookies in
baseball on the strength of his smashing
3-0 debut last fall, but he has yet to
match last year's form. He has failed to
put together one really solid outing and
is struggling along with a 5.93 ERA.
McDowell is in a tough position in
Chicago, where he is expected to carry
a major portion of the load for a young
White Sox team. The White Sox traded
their top three starters last winter and
have probably placed too much pressure
on McDowell.
Nonetheless, McDowell should be able
to battle through this rocky stretch. Not
only does he have the physical talents,
but he also has the attitude (read cocki
ness) to be a success in the Big Leagues.
The blush has faded off this rosy rookie,
but McDowell will prevail in the long
haul.
• Stanford is developing a strong
Chicago connection, as McDowell and
former Stanford football player Kenny
Williams, the White Sox starting third
baseman, will soon be joined in the
Windy City by Brad Muster.
Few expected Muster to last as long
as he did in the draft, and the Bears
felt lucky to get him. During the past
decade the fullback has been a com
plimentary element of the Bears' attack
as a blocker for Walter Payton. With
Payton's retirement, though, Muster
should get his hands on the ball fre
quently. If he can avoid injuries, Muster
should complement the dazzling Neal
Anderson in one of the NFL's best back

fields.
• Todd Lichti and Howard Wright's
invitations to the Olympic basketball
tryouts are a boost for the Stanford
program. Wright was picked to Basket
ball Times' "All Rodney (Dangerfield)
Team" for underrated players, but it
looks like national observers are finally
beginning to take notice of his remark
able improvement this year. Lichti is a
known commodity who garners respect
from basketball people around the coun
try.
Some questions did arise from a se
lection process that seemed blatantly po
litical. How else could Olympic Coach
John Thompson pick four players from
a good but not legendary Arizona team
and then ignore players like Illinois'
Nick Anderson, Purdue's Troy Lewis
and Missouri's Derrick Chievous?
The omission of Chievous, the Band-
Aid man, was particularly glaring. It's
hard to see how Arizona's lead-footed
Tom Tolbert could contribute more than
Chievous, who will almost certainly be
a high first-round draft pick.
• Stanford basketball received a fur
ther compliment when Asst. Coach
Denny Huston was tabbed as the new
head coach at Weber State. Huston
replaces Larry Farmer, the former
UCLA coach who had spent the last few
years at Weber State. The job is a sig
nificant promotion for Huston, who will
take over a well-established Division I
program that competes in the Big Sky
Conference.
• Stanford basketball recruit Martha
Richards was featured in Sports Il
lustrated's "Faces in the Crowd" section
a few weeks ago. Richards, the top player
in Wisconsin, was selected to USA
Today's first five prep all-star team and
is considered the top off-guard in the
country.
Two other Stanford recruits, Chris
MacMurdo and Julie Zeilstra, were
named to USA Today's second five,
which gave Stanford Coach Tara Van-
Derveer three of the top 10 preps in the
nation and her second straight top
ranked recruiting class. VanDerveer
stockpiles talent the way the govern
ment stockpiles grain, and women's bas
ketball here will only get better and
better.
