# Suspended SLAC worker charges racism

### Pia Ali-Salaam Staff writer 
Charging the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center with "racism
and discrimination," 10 members
of United Stanford Workers union
picketed the home of a senior
SLAC official Friday evening to
protest the recent suspension of
a black worker at the facility.
The USW protesters gathered
at the home of Kaye Lathrop, as
sociate director of SLAC, to
publicize their complaint that the
April 22 suspension of technician
Charles Barnard was part of an
ongoing pattern of racial harass
ment at the facility. SLAC con
tends Barnard was suspended for
insubordination.
"Unjust discipline was given to
one of our Afro-American union
members (Barnard) . . . because
he is black and has been an active
union steward," according to a
leaflet USW members distributed
to Lathrop's neighbors.
Lathrop denied the charges,

saying, "There ia no basis for the
charge [of racism]" and added
that there has been an "outstand
ing" history of affirmative action
at SLAC.
Barnard has won three griev
ances against Stanford over the
past two years, none that were
won on racially related grounds.
In August 1987, an independent
arbitrator ruled that Barnard had
been treated "disparately" by his
supervisors at SLAC. More re
cently, on April 13, he won a
workman's compensation suit for
loss of hearing. Barnard has been
suspended on previous occasions
for insubordination and disrup
tion of the workplace, according
to memos written by Barnard's
supervisor, Don Farwell.
"It is no coincidence that
Charlie is being harassed" about
a week after "he won a workman's
compensation suit for loss of
hearing," said Linda Crouse, chief
steward for the USW.
SLAC management disputes
Crouse's claim. Harold Harvey,

Barnard's direct supervisor, said
he told Barnard and three other
technicians to move from one
building to another, and that all
but Barnard completed the move.
"I don't have any problem with
him winning discrimination suits,
but I mind when he disrupts my
work schedule," Harvey said.
Barnard said that his super
visors would not allow him to take
his union literature and personal
effects with him to his new work
area. When he asked to consult
a union representative about the
move, Barnard said, Harvey "gave
me a lot of static."
In a memo to Barnard, Farwell
accused the technician of "sorting
old newspapers instead of pack
ing."
Barnett said he tried to resolve
the situation by speaking to
Lathrop but was told that the as
sistant director would not meet
with him and told him to go
through proper channels.
Crouse pointed out, however,
that "the proper channels ... can

members ... because
he is black and has
been an active union
steward.'

take up to four years to be heard
in arbitration."
But according to Michael Var
tain, a University attorney, within
three weeks after a grievance has
been filed, the USW and the Uni
versity confer. If the union does
not agree with the University de
termination of what to do about
the complaint, a date is set to
meet with one of the six ar
bitrators.
