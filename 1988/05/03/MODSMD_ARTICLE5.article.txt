# Stanford-in-Krakow
## Students undaunted by steelworker strikes 
### John Pollack Senior staff writer 
A widespread student strike at
Krakow's Jagiellonian University
disrupted classes last week, but
the 17 Stanford students studying
in that Polish city remained
largely unaffected by the unrest.
Hundreds of Polish students in
Krakow boycotted classes Friday
in a show of solidarity with strik
ing steelworkers at the nearby
Nowa Huta steel mill. A
walkout by 16,000 workers at
Nowa Huta last Tuesday touched
off a wave of strikes that has since
spread to other factories around
the country. Wage talks between
government officials and the
strikers at Nowa Huta remained

at a standstill yesterday.
Stanford's overseas center in
Krakow is located 15 minutes by
tram from the giant plant, which
employs roughly 36,000 workers.
Another large student walkout
and demonstration are planned
for today — Poland's Constitution
Day — but according to junior
Lena Slachmuulder, no Stanford
students are expected to partici
pate in the protest.
Slachmuijlder, contacted in
Krakow yesterday, added that
several Polish professors involved
with the Stanford program
warned the Stanford students of
potential police violence at the
demonstrations and urged them
to stay away.
"They're all warning us not to
go," Slachmuylder said.
Junior Lloyd Day, another par
ticipant in the Krakow program,
reported seeing 50 buses of militia
trundle into town past his dor
mitory last night. Day, Slach
muijlder and sophomore David
Levine all reported a heavy police
presence around university build
ings, which are scattered through
out the medieval city.
Levine said the Stanford stu
dents in Krakow are allowed to

walk around freely but are for
bidden to take photographs. "We
can go anywhere we want, but
we're always at a risk," he said,
alluding to possible police vio
lence.
Deputy Director of Overseas
Studies Nancy Padgett said yes
terday that since the unrest began
last week the Overseas Studies
office has been in frequent contact
with the Krakow program and
with the American consulate
there. Padgett noted that most of
the more serious clashes between
demonstrators and police have oc
curred in Gdansk and Warsaw.
"The town of Krakow is quite
calm," Padgett said.
Padgett said the University has

no plans to bring the Stanford
students home early because of
the troubles. However, she did not
rule out the possibility that some
students may choose to return
home before the end of the quar
ter. "It depends on what hap
pens," she said. "Naturally we
want to continue to monitor the
situation."
Levine said information avail
able to him about the labor stop
pages is contradictory. He ex
plained that opinion on the sub
ject varies widely among profes
sors, the state-owned newspaper
and students. "A lot of it depends
on who you talk to," Levine said.
Day agreed, saying, "We just hear
things through the grapevine."
