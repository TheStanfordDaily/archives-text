## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
The selection process for di
rector of the ASSU Public Af
fairs Office finally ended yes
terday when the Council of
Presidents rescinded last
week's veto of the nomination
of junior Rachel Wiesen.
The COP expressed its
"deepest apology" to Wiesen for
the "delays and trials of her
appointment process."
The complete reason behind
the veto has never been an
nounced and will remain un
disclosed because of "confiden
tiality promised to those in
volved," according to COP
member Leonard Adler. He
said that the COP's investiga
tions discovered "nothing sub
stantial enough to overturn the
nomination."
However, COP members did
sav the veto centered around

a question on Wiesen's resume
and their general disgust with
the lengthy selection process.
Adler, a junior, said the COP
continues to feel problems ex
isted in the selection process,
but added that none of those
warrant upholding the veto.
A number of senators last
week predicted the veto would
be overturned at tonight's
ASSU Senate meeting, which
will be broadcast on SUNet,
the University television chan
nel.
Wiesen said last night that
the withdrawal of the veto was
an "interesting turn of events"
that she said would "save a
little bit of embarrassment for
the COP."
The full senate confirmed
Wiesen's appointment two
weeks ago after two committee
recommendations had failed to
gain approval.
