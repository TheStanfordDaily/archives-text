A word of advice to Student Organizations:
Relax.
At your last meeting, you're informed that you've got to design, print, and
arrange to distribute one thousand fliers for your next event. On top of this, you've
got two midterms, a ten-page paper, and, not to mention a few parties you might like
to go to.
Relax. The Ad Agency has a team of graphic artists who can design and print
your flier and a team of twenty distributors who can get your ad all over campus.
Give us a call, sit back, study, enjoy yourself, or just relax.
