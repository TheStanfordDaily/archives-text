Animal House
For years fraternities have been
fighting the images created by the
popular movie Animal House. One
good lesson from the box office hit
was Dean Wormer's famous quote, g
above. It's really what fraternities
have been stressing all along.
Fraternities are an opportunity to
develop one's leadership skills,
social abilities, intellectual
capacities, and develop a lifelong
camaraderie. Sigma Nu has been
successful in these areas for 119
years. We're proud of that history
and proud to be returning home to
Stanford. For rush information call
David Sturgeon, Associate
Executive Director at 328-2800 or
see us in White Plaza today
and tomorrow.
