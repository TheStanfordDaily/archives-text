write a book!
We are publishing a book to help college students get into business schools
and top companies. You can make the book a success.
Please send by May 20, 1988:
• essays that got you into business school (and please tell where)
• anecdotes of your job interviews - the questions they asked along
with your sharpest answers and your most embarrassing ones
• resumes and cover letters that have worked for you
• your insight and advice
We will send you a leather briefcase and a copy of the
book if we publish your contribution!
