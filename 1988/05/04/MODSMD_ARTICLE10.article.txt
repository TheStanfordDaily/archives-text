# Debate rages over drug testing
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Although the Santa Clara
County Superior Court is likely
to uphold its injunction against
NCAA drug testing at Stanford
in the next few weeks, a panel
discussion here last night indi
cated that controversy surround
ing the merits of such a decision
rages on among University
coaches and officials.
At a standing-room-only forum
in Potter House last night, Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger, Law
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, law stu
dent Patti Sue Plumer and attor
ney for Stanford athletes Dehra
Zumwalt all argued against man

datory drug testing of athletes.
Track Coach Brooks Johnson and
Women's Basketball Coach Tara
Van Derveer argued in favor of
testing.
Johnson questioned the merits
of a decision that would strike
down such mandatory drug test
ing. Arguing that testing is a
strong deterrent to drug use, he
said the NCAA should "correct
flaws in the drug testing process"
rather than throwing it out en
tirely.
Geiger takes an opposing view.
"I don't believe athletes should
be singled out on college campuses
and required to be drug tested to
participate in regular university
activities," he said. "The NCAA's

testing constitutes an unusual
search and seizure and is a viola
tion of our rights."
Geiger, however, qualified his
position by saying that if it can
be shown that in certain activities
there is unfair competition be
cause of the use of some
performance-enhancing sub
stance, he "would not object to
some testing proposal when
privacy rights are insured."
Johnson countered by calling
the use of performance enhancing
drugs "grand larceny."
"The people that use perform
ance enhancers are picking the
pockets of honest athletes,"
Johnson said. "Believe you me, I
know civil rights are important,
but it is also important to consider
the rights on both sides of the
street."
Van Derveer also said she
favors some form of drug testing
because of her concern about the
use of recreational drugs in bas
ketball.
"My concern is for people on
my team. I don't want to see their
careers destroyed because of

drugs," she said. She cited the
case of a player at Ohio State
(where she coached before coming
to Stanford): The player earned
a 0.0 GPA due because of her
drug dependancy.
Van Derveer, however, was
more critical of current NCAA
testing than Johnson.
"The NCAA's way is not the
best way to go about it," she said.
"I'm more in favor of a counseling
approach. I would prefer educa
tion and some form of deterrent
testing."
Zumwalt criticized the NCAA
expert witnesses in recent drug
testing litigation, saying they

were unable to produce any
evidence that a substance existed
that was known to enhance per
formance.
She also pointed out that even
if steroids could enhance perform
ance, the type of testing done by
the NCAA (post-championship
testing) wouldn't be able to detect
water-based steroids used for
training early on in the season.
Zumwalt is representing Stan
ford students Barry McKeever, a
junior on the football team, and
Jennifer Hill, a senior on the
women's soccer team, in their on
going suit against the NCAA's
drug testing policies.

Johnson, however, disagreed
vehemently with Zumwalt's con
clusion that steroids at most had
a placebo effect, citing laboratory
experiments in which rats showed
increased tissue development
after being injected with steroids.
"It's a myth that performance
enhancing drugs don't exist,
Johnson said. "Steroids allow you
to get in more work sessions at
a given time."
Plumer, an American record
holder in track, said she found
her own experiences with drug
testing, especially the lack of
privacy, disturbing.
