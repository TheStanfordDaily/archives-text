# Debate rages over drug testing
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Although the Santa Clara
County Superior Court is likely
to uphold its injunction against
NCAA drug testing at Stanford
in the next few weeks, a panel
discussion here last night indi
cated that controversy surround
ing the merits of such a decision
rages on among University
coaches and officials.
At a standing-room-only forum
in Potter House last night, Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger, Law
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, law stu
dent Patti Sue Plumer and attor
ney for Stanford athletes Dehra
Zumwalt all argued against man

datory drug testing of athletes.
Track Coach Brooks Johnson and
Women's Basketball Coach Tara
Van Derveer argued in favor of
testing.
Johnson questioned the merits
of a decision that would strike
down such mandatory drug test
ing. Arguing that testing is a
strong deterrent to drug use, he
said the NCAA should "correct
flaws in the drug testing process"
rather than throwing it out en
tirely.
Geiger takes an opposing view.
"I don't believe athletes should
be singled out on college campuses
and required to be drug tested to
participate in regular university
activities," he said. "The NCAA's

testing constitutes an unusual
search and seizure and is a viola
tion of our rights."
Geiger, however, qualified his
position by saying that if it can
be shown that in certain activities
there is unfair competition be
cause of the use of some
performance-enhancing sub
stance, he "would not object to
some testing proposal when
privacy rights are insured."
Johnson countered by calling
the use of performance enhancing
drugs "grand larceny."
"The people that use perform
ance enhancers are picking the
pockets of honest athletes,"
