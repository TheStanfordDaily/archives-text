CLEVELAND — Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis continued to sail
toward the Democratic presidential
nomination yesterday as he rolled up
comfortable victories over the Rev.
Jesse Jackson in Ohio and Indiana.
Jackson, however, won a commanding
victory in the District of Columbia.
In Ohio, with 90 percent of the vote
counted, Dukakis led Jackson, 64 per
cent to 27 percent, and was in position
to win most of the 159 Democratic
convention delegates at stake.
In Indiana, where 79 delegates were
at stake, Dukakis led by 70 percent
to 22 percent with 77 percent of the
ballots counted.
Jackson's only consolation was the
primary in the District of Columbia,
where about two-thirds of the voters
are black. With 70 percent of the pre
cincts reporting, Jackson led Dukakis
80 percent to 18 percent and was
poised to win most or all of the cap

ital's 16 delegates.
Vice President George Bush, who
has already collected enough delegates
for the Republican nomination,
coasted to victory in all three of yes
terday's primaries. Bush was on the
ballot with Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and
former religious broadcaster Pat Rob
ertson, but Dole dropped out of the
race and Robertson did not campaign
actively in any of the contests.
The delegate tabulations were
slower than the popular vote, but Du
kakis led for 182 delegates from the
three contests to 69 for Jackson, ac
cording to estimates by the Associated
Press. Not counting yesterday's pri
maries, Dukakis had slightly more
than 1,300 of the 2,081 delegates
needed to clinch the nomination, a
lead of nearly 450 in the AP tally over
his sole remaining rival.
In Boston, Dukakis said yesterday's
results represented "terrific progress,

a real boost for the campaign."
"I want to thank the people of Ohio
and Indiana," he said at a news con
ference after the polls closed. "Both
states, I think, we can put in the Dem
ocratic column" in November.
Dukakis was counting on big vic
tories in the two Midwestern states
to propel him toward a final showdown
with Jackson in California on June 7.
Jackson, speaking yesterday night
at a party in Washington to celebrate
the only victory he had realistically
anticipated, insisted he was winning
— but continued to redefine the term.
The campaign is "winning every
where," he told supporters. "It's not
what they believe; it's not just count
ing votes," he said, "though we have
nearly five million. It's not just count
ing delegates, though we're moving
toward a thousand. It's .. . changing
national priorities."
His effort, Jackson said, "did not

start in Iowa; it will not end in Atlanta
. . . the struggle tonight is for the di
rection of our party and the soul of
our nation."
Bush, meanwhile, appeared briefly
in Washington before 500 supporters
at an "over the top" rally at a down
town hotel. The vice president actually
has been able to claim enough
delegates to assure him of the nomi
nation for a week — but when this
event was scheduled, aides believed it
would take until yesterday's votes in
Indiana and Ohio to clinch it.
"We've wrapped this thing up sooner
than any of us thought would take
place. But we've got a long way to
go," Bush said.
"Whether the Democrats nominate
Mike Dukakis or Jesse Jackson, we're
going to have a clear choice. Just as
clear as in 1980, just as clear as in
1984."
