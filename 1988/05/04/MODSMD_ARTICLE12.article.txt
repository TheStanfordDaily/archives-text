TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras
â€” Leaders of a dissident move
ment of Nicaraguan rebels said
yesterday they will formally pe
tition top rebel directors to
remove Enrique Bermudez as
commander of the U.S.-backed
force fighting the Nicaraguan
government.
A petition endorsed by 49
field commanders and civilian
members of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the umbrella group
of the rebels known as Contras,
is to be presented to the or
ganization's civilian directorate
at a meeting in the United
States as early as today, dissi
dent leaders said. The nine
point document calls for the
immediate restructuring of the
Contra forces and demands the
replacement of Bermudez by a
junta of Contra regional com
manders.
The decision to make the pe
tition public appears to mark
a widening of a complex, mul
tifaceted split in rebel ranks
that has fractured the Contras'
military unity and divided the
five-member civilian" direc

torate.
Rival factions in the dispute
are accusing each other of cor
ruption and incompetence, and
both Bermudez and the dissi
dents claim the support of the
great majority of Contra
fighters.
Both sides agree that Ber
mudez still has the support of
the Central Intelligence
Agency, which has been
seeking to heal the split. A U.S.
Embassy press representative
also indicated backing for him.
At the core of the dispute,
according to the dissidents, are
longstanding grievances by
Contra field commanders
against Bermudez, 56, a former
colonel in the National Guard
of the late Nicaraguan ruler,
Anastasio Somoza. The dissi
dents charge that Bermudez's
leadership has been corrupt, in
effectual and "dictatorial."
Some have begun calling him
"the Noriega of the Contras,"
a reference to Panamanian
strongman Gen, Manuel An
tonio Noriega.
