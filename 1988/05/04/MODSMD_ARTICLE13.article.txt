GDANSK, Poland â€” Riot police last
night surrounded the Lenin Shipyard
where striking workers were demanding
the legalization of the Solidarity Union as
more job actions erupted in Poland and
the communist government conceded in
creasing difficulty in handling the situa
tion.
Copper workers at the Rudna mine in
Polkolwice, in southwestern Poland, went
on strike, miners in the town said, and
echoed the demand of the Gdansk workers
for the legalization of Solidarity, which was
suppressed after the government of Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law
in December 1981. The miners said 1,000
of the 7,000-member workforce struck,
while the manager said 95 percent were
working.
A strike by steelworkers in the Lenin
Mill in Nowa Huta near Krakow also con
tinued for an eighth day. Efforts by au
thorities to reopen talks with an ad hoc
strike committee after a five-day break
failed, and state television quoted the firm's
manager yesterday night as describing the
situation as "dramatic not only for the mill
but for the country."
On the second day of the strike at the
Gdansk shipyard. Solidarity chairman Lech
Walesa made several speeches and appealed
to the government for negotiations on
Solidarity.
"They can come here with their tanks,"
Walesa told the cheering workers. "They
can come and destroy us but it won't, solve
anything.''
Following a day of rallies and speeches,
riot police surrounded the shipyard, appar

ently intent on stopping any Solidarity sup
porters from marching on the shipyard.
Alojzy Szabowski, head of the Lenin
Shipyard strike committee and the chief
of Solidarity in the shipyard in 1981, said
yesterday morning that 7,000 of 12,000
workers had joined the occupation of the
yard, but by late yesterday the number
appeared to have shrunk to 3,000.
In a press conference in Warsaw, gov
ernment press representative Jerzy Urban
said the government remained "deter
mined" but added, "We can see this is
becoming complicated and more difficult
than we expected."
"The strikes which are currently under
way and the ones which are being provoked
do not threaten socialism in Poland, which
has strong roots in the country, but they
threaten reforms," Urban said. He repeated
government arguments that the nine-day
old strike wave is only undermining at
tempts by the government to liberalize both
the economy and the country's political life.
Despite calls for dialogue by Walesa,
Jaruzelski's government does not intend
to open talks with Solidarity, Urban said,
because "the government will not talk to
illegal structures and Solidarity is an illegal
structure." However, he said, "we might
talk to individuals who were in Solidarity
but not Solidarity as a union."
Opposition sources said that the govern
ment continued to detain Solidarity ac
tivists yesterday and that up to 20 persons
had been arrested in Warsaw while the
phones of a number of key activists had
been cut.
