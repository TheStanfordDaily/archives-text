# Meese backs Utah lawyer for No. 2 job in Justice Dept.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Attorney Gen
eral Edwin Meese 111 has selected
Harold Christensen, a prominent Utah
trial lawyer, to fill the vacant No. 2
job at the Justice Department, admin
istration sources said yesterday.
Sources said Meese recommended
Christensen to the White House on
Monday as a replacement for Arnold
I. Burns, who resigned March 29 to
protest Meese's leadership of the de
partment.
An administration official said yes
terday there were no apparent obsta
cles to nominating the 62-year-old Salt
Lake City lawyer, but emphasized that
he would be subjected to careful back

ground checks before any announce
ment is made.
Meese, seeking to demonstrate that
the resignations of Burns and Assis
tant Attorney General William Weld
had not crippled the department's abil
ity to function, obtained White House
approval to announce his previous
choice for the position, St. Louis
lawyer John Shepherd, before any of
the standard background checks were
done.
Fifteen days later, Shepherd
withdrew from consideration, citing
the "ordeal" that scrutiny of his per
sonal life had been for him and his
family.

Shepherd's withdrawal resulted in
part from publicity surrounding a
recent court case involving his law
firm. In addition, Shepherd's member
ship in two private clubs — one all
male and the other all-white — had
appeared likely to come under fire dur
ing confirmation hearings.
Meese has conducted a public and
until now futile search for replace
ments for Burns and Weld. His first
choice for the deputy's job, former
federal judge Arlin Adams, rejected the
offer, citing commitments to. his
Philadelphia law firm. An assistant
labor secretary and at least three U.S.

attorneys have rejected overtures
about taking Weld's place as head of
the criminal division.
Meese has succeeded in finding a
replacement for Associate Attorney
General Stephen Trott, who resigned
to become a federal judge. Francis
Keating, an assistant Treasury secre
tary, was named to succeed him.
An administration official said
Meese has sent the White House its
recommendation for the criminal di
vision job as well, but other adminis
tration sources said the Burns replace
ment was taking priority.
