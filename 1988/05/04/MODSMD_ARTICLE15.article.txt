Israeli soldiers surround towns
AIN AATA, Lebanon — resistance
fighters who have waged war against the Is
raeli military presence in southern Lebanon
fled this village at daybreak yesterday, slipping
through the lines of the advancing Israeli
forces that surrounded Ain Aata and three
other Bekaa Valley towns.
An official of the National Syrian Social
Party, a Lebanese faction that backs Syria,
said 15 men had left quietly to spare the
mainly Druze township the disaster they
feared could result from an all-out confronta
tion with Israeli soldiers.
"There are houses you know, and helpless
people," said one young fighter, gazing across
the valley to his home town from under the
shade of a mulberry tree.
He and his comrades estimated that 200 to
400 Israeli infantrymen had moved toward
the village and commanded the rocky slopes
overlooking it. Members of the South Lebanon
Army (SLA), a local militia trained and
equipped by Israel, distributed pamphlets
warning residents not to hide members of the
national resistance.
Israeli officials have given no indication that
targets of the operation include Lebanese fac
tions operating against Israeli forces in south
ern Lebanon. They have said it is aimed at
crushing Palestinian groups that have been
infiltrating northern Israel and carrying out
attacks there.
Khouzai Ridan, commander of the National
Syrian Social Party, said there was no Pales
tinian presence in this town. "But if the Pal
estinians come," he said, "we shall welcome
them and welcome every nationalist who will
join our ranks to fight the Israeli enemy."
At dusk yesterday, at least six Israeli helicop
ters were seen hovering east of the heights
around Ain Aata and landing paratroops on
nearby slopes.
Talks on Angola civil war begin
LONDON — The first tentative talks to end
one of the globe's longest-simmering regional
conflicts, the 13-year-old Angolan civil war,
began yesterday in an atmosphere described
as "friendly and constructive."
Diplomats cautioned that the initial round
of negotiations, expected to last two days, is
unlikely to produce any immediate result. But
the meeting itself is viewed as a breakthrough
because it brings together opposing factions
in the conflict, including the United States,
112 for the first time.
k The government-controlled radio of South
Africa, another of the four nations involved
in the talks, described the meetings as "ex
ploratory." One source present at the first
session yesterday declined to comment after
ward on the substance of the negotiations.
Any agreement to end the war, which has
cost an estimated 60,000 to 120,000 lives, dis
placed 750,000 people and stifled the country's
development, would ease tensions significantly
in troubled southern Africa.
All parties to the negotiations have pledged
to observe an official news blackout until the
first series of meetings concludes today. But
it is believed that any talks to end the Angolan
war will eventually also address the fate of
neighboring Namibia, where a nationalist
guerrilla organization, the South West Africa
People's Organization known as SWAPO, is
fighting to end South African control.
