## The 						right is wrong 
### 
LET THE DECISION stand.
This idea is a fundamental
tenet of the American legal
system that conservative judges,
especially, have long endorsed.
Shifts in the membership of our
courts, while certainly channeling
the course of future law, ordinarily
do not disrupt established case
rulings.
But when the new conservative
majority in the U.S. Supreme
Court last week decided to recon
sider a civil rights question that
the court resolved in 1976, it sig
naled that it is ready to re-write
the rules of the judicial game.
In a 1976 case, the Supreme
Court decided that a 1866 civil
rights law — which granted equal
rights to blacks to make and en
force contracts — prevented dis
crimination by the government
and, critically, by private parties.
Now a new case is before the
court. Neither side questioned that
the 1866 law applied to private
discrimination. But, oddly, the
court did.
Instead of restricting itself to the
relatively minor issue of the new
case, it decided to reconsider the
very basis on which the current
suit against a private employer was
based: the applicability of the 1866
law to private discrimination.
This unusual move is of grave
concern because it indicates that
the Rehnquist court may be willing
to roll back over 20 years of civil
rights rulings. The 1866 enact
ment, known as Section 1981, is
in immediate jeopardy, and its
companion law, Section 1982,
would not be far behind since its
applicability to private discrimina
tion is based on the exact same
rationale.
These laws are extremely impor
tant in the convoluted and over
lapping system of federal civil
rights protections. They ensure
non-discrimination in private in

teractions between whites and
blacks in a number of areas not
covered by more recent laws. Ad
ditionally, sections 1981 and 1982
provide greater monetary relief for
victims of employment-related dis
crimination than other civil rights
laws.
Just as alarming is the symbolic
significance of the court's willing
ness to tamper with its established
precedents. No right or liberty of
any of us is safe if the court is
ready to trash 200 years of con
stitutional precedent.
And this message is likely to be
understood as a confirmation of a
prevelent belief that the problems
of racism are solved and that even
the courts themselves feel that the
law has gone too far in dealing
with race relations.
This feeling is evident on
campus, for example, in the atti
tude that the BSU's efforts to
reform injustices are nothing more
than annoying whining, and in the
belief that there is "much ado
about nothing" in charges of dis
crimination.
In the 1960s the Warren Court
was criticized from the right for
its so-called judicial activism in
creatively expanding constitutional
rights in areas such as due process
and equal protection. However un
orthodox its decisions may have
been, there is a lot less to fear
from the expansion of previously
undeveloped rights than from the
destruction of rights that
Americans have come to rely on
and cherish.
Last week's change of heart by
this conservative court indicates
that it is determined to be just as
activist as any liberal-dominated
court has ever been. But the court
is not just showing a lack of self
restraint. Because it appears ready
to abdictate its special role in en
forcing civil rights, it is also
showing a lack of good judgment.
