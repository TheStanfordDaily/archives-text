## Register Republican to block Konnyu nomination 
### 
ERNIE KONNYU, the Stanford
community's representative in
Congress, is an embarrassment.
Mitch Steinberger's April 29 column,
"It's Campbell by default," points out
some of the reasons why this is so.
As a woman, I wish to elaborate on
the sexual harassment incidents to
impress The Daily's readers with the
urgency of Konnyu's removal.
The August 9, 1987 edition of the
San Jose Mercury News describes in
some detail the allegations of sexual
harassment by Konnyu and Konnyu's
response to them.
One Konnyu aide complained that at
a convention Konnyu asked her to
move her name tag so that she
wouldn't draw attention to her small

breasts.
In the article, Konnyu acknowledged
the incident, stating "she wore her
name tag . . . right over her boobs . . .
it should be up high. She is not ex
actly heavily stacked, OK?"
Konnyu's prehistoric conceptions
regarding women should anger anyone
who believes women deserve respect in
their professions. It should anger us at
Stanford enough to get rid of him.
But how? We should register as
Republicans so we can participate in
the Republican primary and vote for
Law Prof. Tom Campbell.
Steinberger stated an unpleasant
truth: If Campbell does not win the
primary, Konnyu is certain to be our
representative again. Steinberger set

forth strong support for such an out
come.
This district has voted Republican
since 1960. Incredible. That means the
12th District voted Republican during
the Kennedy administration, voted
Republican during the liberal '60s and
voted Republican when Carter won big
in '76.
The prediction for '88? In this con
servative era, the 12th District will go
Republican, even if the candidate in
the general election is Ernie Konnyu.
The Stanford community, then, must
make sure Campbell, not Konnyu, is
the Republican candidate. On all is
sues, Campbell is a moderate whose
views well represent those of the
majority of the people in this district

and on women's issues Campbell is the
antithesis of Konnyu.
It's worth noting that Campbell's
doctoral dissertation dealt with salary
discrimination against women in the
federal government and that he has
made public speeches, not as a candi
date but prior to his candidacy, on
legal equity for women and comparable
worth.
The deadline for registering to vote
is May 6. I have changed my registra
tion from Independent to Republican. I
hope that enough Independents and
Democrats do likewise, just for this
primary, to oust Konnyu.
