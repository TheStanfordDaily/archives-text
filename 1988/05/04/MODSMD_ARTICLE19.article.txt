# Cowell should tell patients about test
## 
### 
We are writing in response to the
recent controversy surrounding HIV
antibody testing at Cowell Medical
Center. Cowell is in the difficult posi
tion of having notified individuals of
the results of non-reactive HIV anti
body tests with no post-test counseling
of what that result may or may not
mean.
Post-test counseling is an important
aspect of the testing process because in
some individuals, HIV antibody produc
tion subsequent to infection may be
delayed for several months.
This means some individuals who
have received "negative" test results
may nonetheless be infected with HIV
and be unwittingly transmitting the
virus to their sexual partners.
At the same time, because of the
potential for discrimination in health
insurance, housing, employment and
other areas, confidentiality of test

results is critical and notification of
specific individuals is ethically problem
atic.
Cowell is faced with a dilemma. We
suggest that Cowell run a full page
advertisement in The Daily discussing
many of the issues that are raised in
post-test counseling sessions as well as
an appeal for individuals tested and
not given counseling to schedule an
appointment with Cowell.
This proposal in no way jeapordizes
confidentiality and brings important
information to the Stanford communi
