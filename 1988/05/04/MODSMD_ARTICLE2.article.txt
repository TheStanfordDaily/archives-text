# More profs in the Academy
## National Academy of Sciences elects two from Stanford 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
Two Stanford professors have
been elected to the prestigious Na
tional Academy of Sciences, the
Academy announced Saturday.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Anthony Siegman and Political
Science Prof. John Ferejohn will
join 80 other Stanford faculty
members in the Academy, long
considered the nation's leading
honor society for scientists. The
Academy has over 1,500 mem
bers.
Ferejohn has developed mathe
matical models to explain the be
havior of political institutions.
Siegman, an expert in both the
fundamental physics and practical
applications of lasers, has contrib
uted to the design of efficient
high-power lasers and has au
thored several books on lasers.
Siegman expressed both
surprise and elation at his election
to the Academy.
"It was not something I was
expecting. In fact, if I had been
voting in the election, I'm not
sure I would have voted myself
in," said Siegman, who was in
ducted into the National Academy
of Engineers 10 years ago.
Ferejohn was unavailable for
comment last night.

Although
Ferejohn is the
third member of
the Political Sci
ence faculty at
Stanford to be in
ducted into the
Academy, he was
the only political
scientist among
the 61 members

selected to join the Academy this
year, and was one of only eight
scholars from the social sciences
to be chosen.
Originally founded by President
Abraham Lincoln in 1863 to help
draw scientists into the North's
war effort during the Civil War,
the Academy serves two primary
functions. It elects outstanding
scientists to its membership, con
ferring prestige that most scien
tists consider second only to the
Nobel Prize. It is also an advisory
organization chartered by
Congress that convenes and su
pervises the National Research
Council — a group of ad hoc com
mittees of experts that provide
independent, non-political advice
to the Federal Government.
For most of its history, the
Academy was dominated by
scholars from the so-called hard
sciences, which include the natu

ral sciences such as biology,
chemistry, mathematics and
physics.
But in the early 1970s it began
a more concerted effort to elect
social and behavioral scientists to
its membership, partly in an effort
to increase its range of expertise
for advising the Government on
complex policy issues. On the eve
of this year's election, the Acad
emy's roster of 1,479 members
included 177 social and behavioral
scientists, of whom 41 were social
or political scientists.
Gabriel Almond, professor
emeritus of political science and
a member of the Academy, said
the traditionally low number of
social scientists in the Academy
was largely because of the lack of
scientific methodology used in the
social sciences in the past.
"Political science prior to World
War II was essentially historical,
philosophical and descriptive," he
said. "Since then, it has become
more quantitative, more method
ical. . . . Political scientists have
only been in the Academy for 10
years."
Ferejohn's work with mathe
matical models reflects the in
creasing trend in political science
toward using quantitative analy
sis.
