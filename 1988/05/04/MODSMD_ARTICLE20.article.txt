# Cheating shouldn't be taken too lightly

### 
I found Nathan Hochman's April 25
column, "Cheaters always win," in
extremely poor taste in that it encour
ages students (and others) to move in

directions diametrically opposed to
their own best interests. Let me ex
plain.
A very large sum of money (and in
many cases at considerable personal
sacrifice) has been paid in order to
provide each student at Stanford with
an education. The significant transfor
mations stemming from this exchange
are those which occur among the stu
dent's brain cells and not on a slip of
paper in the registrar's files.
All of us enjoy bragging about the
bargains we have won in our pur
chases — 60 percent off, $500 rebate,
two for the price of one, etc. The
cheater may brag about what he/she
got away with, but did you ever hear
the cheater brag about how little
knowledge he/she got in exchange for
the price of tuition?
I have occasion to speak with many
premedical students. Anyone who
cheats to enter medical school and/or
cheats to get through medical school is
ripe for a fat, juicy malpractice suit.
Every patient who enters a doctor's
examining room presents that doctor

with yet another final exam.
Similar situations arise for any "pro
fessional" person (among lawyers, en
gineers, editors, teachers, etc.) who has
cheated on the way to that office. I
can imagine no one more lonely and
desolate than the person who cheated
or spread other falsehoods who then
says, "Believe me. Please, believe me,"
only to be ignored by the world.
In the last paragraph of the column,
Hochman indicates that perhaps his
column was to be considered
humorous. My letter is not.
