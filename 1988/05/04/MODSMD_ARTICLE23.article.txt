## How do we rate life? 
### 
AS MY FOUR-YEAR stay at Stan
ford comes to an end and I look
with increasing excitement toward
graduation, I begin to wax reminiscent
about this school and its pleasures and
pitfalls.
Here, then, is one person's opinion
about what is overrated and what is un
derrated at Stanford, in California, and
maybe in life.
The ASSU is underrated. My God,
you'd think the place never did any good
from the way they are attacked by every
weirdo group on campus (the same ones
who get funding from the ASSU).
The ASSU brings us great Flicks,
ample lecture notes, cheap T-shirts and,
best of all, refunds!
(I'm sick of hearing people complain
about not knowing when fee refunds are
given out. Hello, folks, is anybody home?
Do you ever read The Daily? Third and
fourth week every quarter, Tresidder
back patio. Be there. I'm not giving you
cuts in line, either.)
The DUs are completely overrated. I
mean, who are these guys? And how did
they all end up living in the Suites?
The other frats are wholly underrated.
I mean, especially by people in Old Union.
What'd you think of Rush this year, Dean
Lyons?
The Band will be overrated until they
learn some newer songs.
And Don Kennedy will be overrated
until we get some lighted tennis courts.
I hold him personally responsible.

KZSU will join the ranks of the un
derrated once they stop playing jazz one
hour, progressive music the next, and
something else after that. Until then,
KZSU deserves and will get no listeners.
Ernie Konnyu is underrated. Sure he's
a sexist, racist fool, but hey, the guy
sends me mail!
The Oasis is underrated, the Goose is
overrated. Why is "The O" always empty
while "The Goo" is always packed? I can't
understand this at all. "The O" has much
better food (the best pizza anywhere) and
cheaper beer — my prescription for a
great place.
Western Culture is without question
the most overrated entity on this campus.
A valuable, vibrant class? Dubious at
best. My freshman year I snoozed
through every lecture. The class was hor
rid, the sections interminable.
This whole prolonged debate has
missed a central point: I don't care who
the Inferno I read, just try and make
the class interesting! Who hires these
soporific section leaders, anyway? Hey,
Western Culture, CIV, whatever you're
called, try to find better lecturers!
Palm Drive is so overrated! Sure, the
view's great, but could we have more
potholes? And while you're at it, could
they be bigger?
Stanford's housing system is incredibly
overrated. Sorry, but if you draw a num
ber in excess of 1,300, you're looking
grim.
Tremendously overrated are the people
this very paper always relies upon for

"expert analysis" after major world
events. (What, you mean John Manley
was quoted in The Daily as not liking
President Reagan's State of the Union
address? And he thought Ollie North
should go to jail? Shocking!)
Overrated? The Coffee House! Here's
my typical order: "May I please have
another expensive, no-meat sandwich and
a foreign grad student to go?" (Hey, at
least the lighting's good.)
The Graduate School of Business is
completely overrated, a belief I'll hold
until the day that battle-hungry bunch
of losers lightens up when playing in
tramurals. Guys, relax! No bonus points
are given for drawing blood.
You want really overrated? The Grate
ful Dead are the most overrated group
in the world today. (And by the way,
what was in those brownies I bought
near Frost on Saturday? I got so green
I had to go to Cowell Health Center.)
Cowell is underrated. Unless, of course,
you're sick. (Anybody need a handout on
the common cold?)
