## Student scoops up success 
### Erika Ryst 
Recipe for success: Blend two measured
scoops of determination and fate. Top with
a liberal sprinkling of hard work. And serve
at Hobson's — Menlo Park's newest dessert
store.
But perhaps the real key to the success
of Northern California's first Hobson's is
sophomore Dan Beltramo, the store's owner.
Beltramo became sweet on the idea of
owning an ice cream shop shortly before
the start of this school year when he decided
to buy, with his father's help, a Bud's ice
cream store which had recently gone out of
business.
But his taste for management had
developed long before sophomore year. "I'll
put a plug in for the CPPC," said Beltramo,
who took the Career Planning and Place
ment Center's diagnostic test his freshman
year. The results showed that his interests
were in restaurant management, food serv
ice and small business. "They really pegged"
the right careers, he said.
Coincidences seemed to emerge lickety
split as Beltramo's future in the ice cream
world began to materialize. A year before
his store's opening this March, Beltramo
visited Santa Barbara and ate ice cream at
the local Hobson's. Liking the flavor, he
kept a Hobson's napkin as a memento.
Six months later, he ran across the napkin
in his desk — an event that prompted a
call to the company. Although Beltramo
tasted many ice creams in many stores, Hob
son's, a Santa Barbara-based chain of ice
cream stores, became the top choice as his
supplier.
As the ice cream shop became to take
shape, business negotiations became more
impending than any of his classes.
"It's one thing when you're negotiating
for a grade, but another when you're dealing
with your total assets," Beltramo joked.
But his efforts have met with success. In
fact, within the first four weeks he needed
to hire three more employees because of the
store's popularity.
The store's fresh decor might attribute
to its success. Decorated in light tones of
blue and white, the store radiates a clean
atmosphere and has the look of an old ice
cream parlor. Contributing to the parlor
effect are white stools that line two of the
walls and face high clear windows. Prints
of scoops of Hobson ice cream buried in
mounds of strawberries, Oreos, bananas and
peanuts hang on the store's walls, tempting
customers to indulge.
Another factor that sets Hobson's apart
from other ice cream stores is its special
blending process. Hobson's blending mac
hines occupy their own prominent places
behind the store's counter. Employees create
a Hobson's blend by scooping up two flavors,
weighing the ice cream on a scale and using
the blending machine's spiral equipment to
drill a hole for the desired filling.
The machine spins into action, blending
the mixture into what Beltramo said is is
a "smoother, softer consistency."
Finally, the machines' hand pump is used
to swirl the creation into a cup or cone, and
another Hobson's blend is fresh for the
eating.
Beltramo claimed that there are "over
4,427,000 different combinations" of blends
for the customer to create and enjoy. For
the less daring, Hobson's also offers a slate
of "very special blends" to choose from,
Beltramo said.
Blend recipes range from the cookie crumb
ice cream blended in Reese's peanut butter
cups and sprinkled with crushed peanuts to
apple pie ice cream blended in heath bars

and strawberries.
Menlo Park resident Kathy Price said
Hobson's ice cream is "very good" and that
she visits the store about twice a week.
Customer Chuck Moody praised Hobson for
having "one of the best ice creams [he] has
ever tasted."
Although the store is doing deliciously
well, Beltramo admitted that two obstacles
face him — youth and schoolwork.
Beltramo, who is is only a few years older
than most of his employees, said that owning
a business at age 20 is "challenging."
"If [my employees] sense weakness, they
jump" he said.
But Mel Heydari, who has worked at Hob
son's for five weeks, had nothing but praise
for his boss.
"Dan is awesome," said Heydari, a student
at Menlo-Atherton High School. Heydari
said he appreciates the effort Beltramo takes
to instruct his employees. "[He teaches] not
just how to serve ice cream [but] how to
handle situations with customers."
Comparing ice cream to academia, Bel
tramo said he sees his business as an ex
tension to his Stanford classes in economics
and psychology.

"Hobson's is my own little lab," Beltramo
said, explaining that the store is "a real-life
kind of parallel" to textbook explanations
of pricing strategies, labor and human re
action.
He pointed out a psychological observation
he has made at work involving color. Ac
cording to Beltramo, lemon ice cream does
not sell because of its pale color, but bright
rainbow ice cream is very popular with
children.
Despite the on-the-job education Beltramo
is receiving, Hobson's takes away a great
deal of time from his conventional studies.
According to Beltramo, his life is a "con
stant juggling act," between work and
school. But for now, he said he copes by
"fighting the fires where they're worst,"
and "doing the things most needed."
He estimated that he spends more waking
hours at Hobson's than on campus. "I
haven't been to a party in six weeks," he
said ruefully.
But cutting down on social life for busi
ness is a sacrifice Beltramo's willing to
make. As long as he can blend school with
work, Beltramo said he hopes to keep tasting
the flavor of success.

peanuts hang on the store's walls, tempting
customers to indulge.
Another factor that sets Hobson's apart
from other ice cream stores is its special
blending process. Hobson's blending mac
hines occupy their own prominent places
behind the store's counter. Employees create
a Hobson's blend by scooping up two flavors,
weighing the ice cream on a scale and using
the blending machine's spiral equipment to
drill a hole for the desired filling.
The machine spins into action, blending
the mixture into what Beltramo said is is
a "smoother, softer consistency."
Finally, the machines' hand pump is used
to swirl the creation into a cup or cone, and
another Hobson's blend is fresh for the
eating.
Beltramo claimed that there are "over
4,427,000 different combinations" of blends
for the customer to create and enjoy. For
the less daring, Hobson's also offers a slate
of "very special blends" to choose from,
Beltramo said.
Blend recipes range from the cookie crumb
ice cream blended in Reese's peanut butter
cups and sprinkled with crushed peanuts to
apple pie ice cream blended in heath bars

and strawberries.
Menlo Park resident Kathy Price said
Hobson's ice cream is "very good" and that
she visits the store about twice a week.
Customer Chuck Moody praised Hobson for
having "one of the best ice creams [he] has
ever tasted."
Although the store is doing deliciously
well, Beltramo admitted that two obstacles
face him — youth and schoolwork.
Beltramo, who is is only a few years older
than most of his employees, said that owning
a business at age 20 is "challenging."
"If [my employees] sense weakness, they
jump" he said.
But Mel Heydari, who has worked at Hob
son's for five weeks, had nothing but praise
for his boss.
"Dan is awesome," said Heydari, a student
at Menlo-Atherton High School. Heydari
said he appreciates the effort Beltramo takes
to instruct his employees. "[He teaches] not
just how to serve ice cream [but] how to
handle situations with customers."
Comparing ice cream to academia, Bel
tramo said he sees his business as an ex
tension to his Stanford classes in economics
and psychology.

"Hobson's is my own little lab," Beltramo
said, explaining that the store is "a real-life
kind of parallel" to textbook explanations
of pricing strategies, labor and human re
action.
He pointed out a psychological observation
he has made at work involving color. Ac
cording to Beltramo, lemon ice cream does
not sell because of its pale color, but bright
rainbow ice cream is very popular with
children.
Despite the on-the-job education Beltramo
is receiving, Hobson's takes away a great
deal of time from his conventional studies.
According to Beltramo, his life is a "con
stant juggling act," between work and
school. But for now, he said he copes by
"fighting the fires where they're worst,"
and "doing the things most needed."
He estimated that he spends more waking
hours at Hobson's than on campus. "I
haven't been to a party in six weeks," he
said ruefully.
But cutting down on social life for busi
ness is a sacrifice Beltramo's willing to
make. As long as he can blend school with
work, Beltramo said he hopes to keep tasting
the flavor of success.

Sweet success has emerged lickety-split for sophomore Dan Beltramo, the owner of
Hobson's ice cream store.
Recipe for success: Blend two measured
scoops of determination and fate. Top with
a liberal sprinkling of hard work. And serve
at Hobson's — Menlo Park's newest dessert
store.
But perhaps the real key to the success
of Northern California's first Hobson's is
sophomore Dan Beltramo, the store's owner.
Beltramo became sweet on the idea of
owning an ice cream shop shortly before
the start of this school year when he decided
to buy, with his father's help, a Bud's ice
cream store which had recently gone out of
business.
But his taste for management had
developed long before sophomore year. "I'll
put a plug in for the CPPC," said Beltramo,
who took the Career Planning and Place
ment Center's diagnostic test his freshman
year. The results showed that his interests
were in restaurant management, food serv
ice and small business. "They really pegged"
the right careers, he said.
Coincidences seemed to emerge lickety
split as Beltramo's future in the ice cream
world began to materialize. A year before
his store's opening this March, Beltramo
visited Santa Barbara and ate ice cream at
the local Hobson's. Liking the flavor, he
kept a Hobson's napkin as a memento.
Six months later, he ran across the napkin
in his desk — an event that prompted a
call to the company. Although Beltramo
tasted many ice creams in many stores, Hob
son's, a Santa Barbara-based chain of ice
cream stores, became the top choice as his
supplier.
As the ice cream shop became to take
shape, business negotiations became more
impending than any of his classes.
"It's one thing when you're negotiating
for a grade, but another when you're dealing
with your total assets," Beltramo joked.
But his efforts have met with success. In
fact, within the first four weeks he needed
to hire three more employees because of the
store's popularity.
The store's fresh decor might attribute
to its success. Decorated in light tones of
blue and white, the store radiates a clean
atmosphere and has the look of an old ice
cream parlor. Contributing to the parlor
effect are white stools that line two of the
walls and face high clear windows. Prints
of scoops of Hobson ice cream buried in
mounds of strawberries, Oreos, bananas and
peanuts hang on the store's walls, tempting
customers to indulge.
Another factor that sets Hobson's apart
from other ice cream stores is its special
blending process. Hobson's blending mac
hines occupy their own prominent places
behind the store's counter. Employees create
a Hobson's blend by scooping up two flavors,
weighing the ice cream on a scale and using
the blending machine's spiral equipment to
drill a hole for the desired filling.
The machine spins into action, blending
the mixture into what Beltramo said is is
a "smoother, softer consistency."
Finally, the machines' hand pump is used
to swirl the creation into a cup or cone, and
another Hobson's blend is fresh for the
eating.

4,427,000 different combinations" of blends
