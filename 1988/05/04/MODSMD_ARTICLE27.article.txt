Band Beat:
I was talking to Dan Luscher, the drummer
for the campus band "Random Numbers" the
other day. The band plays rock music of the
'60s, '70s and '80s or as Dan put it,"the type
of music you hear on KFOG." Check out the
Random Numbers for yourself this Friday
night at Cedro's all-campus party.
Senior Frolicking:
Senior class presidents Stacey Estrella and
Liz Marks want to remind their classmates
that tomorrow is the Senior Survey Picnic in
Frost Amphitheater. Liz says there will be
"tons of beer from a Chinese Beer Company"
and the picnic will be a lot of fun.
After the eating and drinking winds down,
the dancing begins as the festivities continue.
Senior Pub Night is at the funky Club Afrique.
A Capella Action:
Tomorrow night at Cubberley Auditorium
Mixed Company, Fleet Street, the Mendicants,
Everyday People and Counterpoint will per
form in a benefit concert for the Special Olym
pics. The talents of our singing groups will
certainly bring plenty of support for this spe
cial cause. Good job, guys!
