## Concert Review D'Arby dumbfounds and dazzles on Fillmore stage 
### L. Masterson 
Whether you like him or not, wheth
er, in fact, you are even cognizant of
his existence, there is no longer any
question that Terence Trent D'Arby
has arrived. His two sold-out perform
ances at San Francisco's Fillmore
Auditorium Sunday and Monday
proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
In mid-1987, D'Arby stunned the
music establishment by accomplishing
a virtually unheard-of feat: The un
known artist's debut effort, "Introduc
ing the Hardline According to Terence
Trent D'Arby," entered the British
charts at No. 1 and reportedly sold a
million copies within its first three
days of distribution. Not only that,
but the critics liked it, too.
An instant, overnight sensation,
D'Arby was heralded as nothing short
of the Second Coming, the One to
Watch, the next Big Thing. Intelligent,
witty and opinionated, D'Arby soon
began to gain more notoriety for the
outspokenness of his interviews and
his statements than for the music he
had created.
Nonetheless, expectations ran high
when the former boxer prepared to
take America by storm. He didn't ex
actly make a splash, but he began to
gain momentum and noteriety by ap
pearing on such shows as "David Let
terman," "Saturday Night Live" and
the Grammys.
In the meantime, his British block
buster, "Wishing Well," was presented
for statewide consideration and began
its steady climb up the charts and
eventually reached number one on
Billboard's pop charts. D'Arby was
ready for a second splash.
At the Fillmore on Sunday, D'Arby

opened with a surprise — a Stones
cover — "Jumpin' Jack Flash." Using
a '40s-style stationary mike, D'Arby
stood riveted to it and bobbed his knee
a lot. Then the strip show started.
First off came the sunglasses, then
the hat, then the dog-ugly leather
"wannabe-a-tough-guy" motorcycle
jacket — girls screaming all the while.
Song No. 2 was another cover, "Soul
Power," which featured D'Arby taking
his braids out of a ponytail to more
screams.
Before starting his own material,
D'Arby introduced himself, his band,
and then, surveying the packed floor,
make the wry observation, "This looks
like the place to be." It wasn't. I swear
I've had more fun at the Bowl-O-
Rama.
"Sign Your Name" was the first of
his tunes that translated reasonably
well, and with "Seven More Days," he
started to showcase the vocal prowess
that turned people's heads originally.
Neatly dropping into "Wishing Well,"
things finally seemed to fall into place.
When he began the a capella extem
porization of "If You Let Me Stay," I
remembered why I hadn't stopped
talking about him in six months. At
the song's finish, D'Arby continued to
play up its content with something
that resembled a storyline/
comedy routine which strung together
several song bits and solos.
The only problem with D'Arby
showing off vocally is that he enjoys
the drama of the pauses so much that
it's 25 seconds between notes. It wears
thin. In fact, that was what was be
ginning to become very obvious. The
theatrics.
When the theatrics were Terence
being Terence, they were hysterical.

When they were Terence executing one
rock cliche after another, they seemed
calculated and cheap.
At one point during "Sign Your
Name," he reached into his shirt and
made it "jump" out where his pound
ing heart would be. It looked as
awkward and unnatural as it sounds.
The show's encore degenerated into
D'Arby yelling that it was time for
"More Rock and Roll!" I wondered if
I hadn't misplaced myself and gone to
a Ratt concert by mistake. He finished
with more Stones, and if that weren't
letdown enough (I'm not voicing per
sonal preference here, he's supposed
to be a soul singer), he outdid himself
with more ridiculous staging.
When the lights went out, he
smashed his guitar. I was in shock —
the only surprising thing about it

being that he would stoop so low.
Monday was basically a day to go
and take serious notes to reconfirm
what I had seen the previous evening.
I had my checklist and was ready to
count and label each of the various
cliches.
Monday's show was much like the
previous one in content, but very dif
ferent in feeling. I saw a look come
over D'Arby's face, it was the look of
a man who was seducing the crowd,
not with stunts or gimmicks, but with
some part of his being — and he knew
it.
He knew he was thrilling the audi
ence and he fed off that knowledge.
He fired up from the crowd's energy
in a way he hadn't the night before.
He went into the strong part of the
show and everything seemed to flow.
During the "comedy" sequence, he in
teracted and adapted to suit the crowd
and inserted one of his own "B" sides
to his a capella pleading.
For his encore, he did another one
of his songs, a slow wailer with a
gospel pickup that ended refreshingly
softly without him insisting on wres
tling the vocals to the bitter end. The
finale was still a Stones tune, but
D'Arby danced to it the way I had
wished he would take off all night.
The band tore it up, but paled next
to the star. When he hit that groove,
you understood why the critics had
flipped.
The guitar still got smashed. That
bothered me. But I was relieved more
than anything else. He had taken the
part of him that was mesmerizing
along the rock star trip, and, given
the proper conditions, could magnify
it to a degree where it still retained
its blinding brilliance.

"wannabe-a-tough-guy" motorcycle
jacket — girls screaming all the while.
Song No. 2 was another cover, "Soul
Power," which featured D'Arby taking
his braids out of a ponytail to more
screams.
Before starting his own material,
D'Arby introduced himself, his band,
and then, surveying the packed floor,
make the wry observation, "This looks
like the place to be." It wasn't. I swear
I've had more fun at the Bowl-O-
Rama.
"Sign Your Name" was the first of
his tunes that translated reasonably
well, and with "Seven More Days," he
started to showcase the vocal prowess
that turned people's heads originally.
Neatly dropping into "Wishing Well,"
things finally seemed to fall into place.
When he began the a capella extem
porization of "If You Let Me Stay," I
remembered why I hadn't stopped
talking about him in six months. At
the song's finish, D'Arby continued to
play up its content with something
that resembled a storyline/
comedy routine which strung together
several song bits and solos.
The only problem with D'Arby
showing off vocally is that he enjoys
the drama of the pauses so much that
it's 25 seconds between notes. It wears
thin. In fact, that was what was be
ginning to become very obvious. The
theatrics.
When the theatrics were Terence
being Terence, they were hysterical.

When they were Terence executing one
rock cliche after another, they seemed
calculated and cheap.
At one point during "Sign Your
Name," he reached into his shirt and
made it "jump" out where his pound
ing heart would be. It looked as
awkward and unnatural as it sounds.
The show's encore degenerated into
D'Arby yelling that it was time for
"More Rock and Roll!" I wondered if
I hadn't misplaced myself and gone to
a Ratt concert by mistake. He finished
with more Stones, and if that weren't
letdown enough (I'm not voicing per
sonal preference here, he's supposed
to be a soul singer), he outdid himself
with more ridiculous staging.
When the lights went out, he
smashed his guitar. I was in shock —
the only surprising thing about it

being that he would stoop so low.
Monday was basically a day to go
and take serious notes to reconfirm
what I had seen the previous evening.
I had my checklist and was ready to
count and label each of the various
cliches.
Monday's show was much like the
previous one in content, but very dif
ferent in feeling. I saw a look come
over D'Arby's face, it was the look of
a man who was seducing the crowd,
not with stunts or gimmicks, but with
some part of his being — and he knew
it.
He knew he was thrilling the audi
ence and he fed off that knowledge.
He fired up from the crowd's energy
in a way he hadn't the night before.
He went into the strong part of the
show and everything seemed to flow.
During the "comedy" sequence, he in
teracted and adapted to suit the crowd
and inserted one of his own "B" sides
to his a capella pleading.
For his encore, he did another one
of his songs, a slow wailer with a
gospel pickup that ended refreshingly
softly without him insisting on wres
tling the vocals to the bitter end. The
finale was still a Stones tune, but
D'Arby danced to it the way I had
wished he would take off all night.
The band tore it up, but paled next
to the star. When he hit that groove,
you understood why the critics had
flipped.
The guitar still got smashed. That
bothered me. But I was relieved more
than anything else. He had taken the
part of him that was mesmerizing
along the rock star trip, and, given
the proper conditions, could magnify
it to a degree where it still retained
its blinding brilliance.

Whether you like him or not, wheth
er, in fact, you are even cognizant of
his existence, there is no longer any
question that Terence Trent D'Arby
has arrived. His two sold-out perform
ances at San Francisco's Fillmore
Auditorium Sunday and Monday
proved it beyond a shadow of a doubt.
In mid-1987, D'Arby stunned the
music establishment by accomplishing
a virtually unheard-of feat: The un
known artist's debut effort, "Introduc
ing the Hardline According to Terence
Trent D'Arby," entered the British
charts at No. 1 and reportedly sold a
million copies within its first three
days of distribution. Not only that,
but the critics liked it, too.
An instant, overnight sensation,
D'Arby was heralded as nothing short
of the Second Coming, the One to
Watch, the next Big Thing. Intelligent,
witty and opinionated, D'Arby soon
began to gain more notoriety for the
outspokenness of his interviews and
his statements than for the music he
had created.
Nonetheless, expectations ran high
when the former boxer prepared to
take America by storm. He didn't ex
actly make a splash, but he began to
gain momentum and noteriety by ap
pearing on such shows as "David Let
terman," "Saturday Night Live" and
the Grammys.
In the meantime, his British block
buster, "Wishing Well," was presented
for statewide consideration and began
its steady climb up the charts and
eventually reached number one on
Billboard's pop charts. D'Arby was
ready for a second splash.
At the Fillmore on Sunday, D'Arby

opened with a surprise — a Stones
cover — "Jumpin' Jack Flash." Using
a '40s-style stationary mike, D'Arby
stood riveted to it and bobbed his knee
a lot. Then the strip show started.
First off came the sunglasses, then
the hat, then the dog-ugly leather
"wannabe-a-tough-guy" motorcycle
jacket — girls screaming all the while.
