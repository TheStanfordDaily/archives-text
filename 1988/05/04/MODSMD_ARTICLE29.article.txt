# Criticisms of rock taken too seriously
## 
### Frank Lester Staff writer 
What do Fishbone and Allan
Bloom have in common?
Besides a presumed mutual
animosity (or, more likely, mutual
ignorance), both brought to mind
last month the incredible passion
college students invest in rock
music, that bastion of pop culture
that didn't even exist 35 years
ago, but which by now is so in
stitutionalized that some people
wish it would just consume itself
in its own orgiastic excesses and
die off.
Everybody over the age of 16
has something nasty to say about
rock and its racism, its misogyny,
its homophobia, its puerility, its
stupidity, its reliance on bald
faced clich6 while pretending to
be iconoclastic, its pure hypocrisy.
These are the same complaints
one could make about any insti
tution. Any institution, to en
hance its chances of survival,
relies on the overfrequent repeti
tion of certain hackneyed tropes.
In rock's case, those tropes can
be gleaned from any week's Top
Ten chart. Women are all angels
(Aerosmith), but we all, even
sweet females, have the devil in
side us (INXS). We all wish we
could make the devil go away, get
down to the simplest of levels,
and have pop-heaven bliss
(Terence Trent D'Arby). All men
are basically incomprehensible, so
to preserve their dignity, women
demand men to prove they're an
gelic at heart (Taylor Dayne).
After all, even naughty girls need
love (Samantha Fox).
Anything outside this adoles
cent picture of human relation
ships is roundly condemned by
the money-hungry pop songwriter
as obscene and threatening. What

more advertising for the procrea
tive agenda (and, increasingly, as
the industry goes neo-Connie
Francis on us, the marital agenda)
could a society need?
Allan Bloom, whose frighten
ingly successful diatribe "The
Closing of the American Mind"
became available in paperback a
couple of weeks ago at the Book
store, argues that college students
love rock music because there's
little else we aren't plumb scared
to death to commit ourselves to,
whether it's another person, an
other idea, or another act. But
Bloom again ignores the Connie
syndrome: most rock (especially
now, unless it's Depeche Mode)
unabashedly celebrates the notion
of commitment, in all its avatars.
Think about Fishbone for a sec
ond. They played in White Plaza
to a wildly receptive audience, and
their performance symbolized
everything that rock is about —
irreverence, bawdiness, loudness,
sweat, profanity, and just plain
obnoxiousness. What gets
Bloom's goat, apparently, is that
an institution could get away with
so much revolutionary posturing
and not be quashed by now.
Fishbone came. Fishbone con
quered. They snarled their way
through a set of music that was,
to say the least, blatantly conde
scending — as befitted an act that,
without the kind of visible success
that lends itself to gigs with more
famous acts in high-capacity
arenas, must rely for its upkeep
on performances in front of antsy
college kids with a little excess
libido to burn.
But contrary to what Bloom
would have seen had he been
standing on the sidelines, shaking
his graying head, the group
wasn't captivating us with some
jinxing, mindless blend of hyp

notic rhythm and subliminal
foolery. It was insulting the
daylights out of us, delivering a
manifesto of rage (and yes, even
commitment), and enjoying every
second of it. It was violating
Bloom's premise that revolution
not hide behind the petticoats of
the establishment.
The way Bloom drives his prem
ise home is to suggest that rock's
mixture of obscenity and respect
ability, agitation and stagnation,
overthrow and status quo, blinds
us to the polarities those opposites
convey. Our brain waves get
crossed, to put it simplistically,
and we begin flitting from hunk
to hunk and hunkette to hunk
ette, party to party, keg to keg,
cause to cause, book to book,
never spending enough time to
come to any conclusion more
meaningful than that everything
in the world is relative.
Bloom's alarmism aside, the
purpose of most music is to seduce
the mind into breaking intellec
tual bonds. That is the magic of
something as structured, elegant,
and contrived as a Bach concerto;
its purpose, above all, is to express
an outpouring of emotion to the
glory of God. Rock shares the
characteristics of seduction, con
fusion, and evocation with any
other music form you could name,
including the Chopin sonatas
Bloom likely listens to while sip
ping his aged sherry in his tatty
Chicago study.
The point here is that rock has
more in common (especially be
cause it is such a parasitic form)
with the genealogy of music, and
of American culture in general,
than Bloom would like to admit.
One of these commonalities, for
the most part, is emphatically and
determinedly not aesthetic pre
tension. Rock is music, and there

fore besieges the same visceral el
ements in us that any music does,
but it is before all else an insti
tution, an industry dispensing a
commodity like any other. If it
degrades the American mind, it
does so hand in hand with the
media, the advertisers whom the
media jerk off, and the products
those mutual sessions emit.
Bloom wants (ironically) to
solder rock, like a precious stone,
into a fourteen-carat ring and
declare it an art form in the same
way Beethoven and Coltrane's art
forms are. All the easier to make
false claims about the true impact
of the stuff. It's far easier to say
we're being hoodwinked into
being uncaring stiffs when it's an
art form that's hoodwinking us,
and not a disposable pop industry
that anyone in his right mind
wouldn't give a second thought to.
And the funny thing is that rock
will, as long as it is an industry
with profits to make and com
modities to break, and most im
portantly of all, fans of Tiffany
to impress, resist that metaphys
ical declaration. Rock makes no
claims to engaging the soul, as
Bloom thinks it does, and when
it does, it usually fails. Rock is at
its best when it is engaging the
animal in us, the animal enraged
by apartheid, horny for sex, or
enraptured with life. There is no
point in getting on the dance floor
and worrying about the post
modernist intellectual crisis.
The industry moguls who pump
out rock by the planeload every
day are obsessed with the next
chart-topping duet between
Dionne Warwick and Michael
Jackson, the next fiery and boring
piece of Glass Tiger fretwork, the
next piece of Johnny Hates Jazz
synth frippery, the next ultrason
ically diverting, pelvis-pleasing

Georgio dance mix. Rock thumbs
its nose and fluffs its long mane
in derision at the notion that it
could be anything like an art
form. Art is for losers who lan
guish fatly in the bar and com
plain about their two left feet.
Rock, in other words, does a
Fishbone at the notion that it is
anything like the threat Bloom
makes it out to be. It is a product,
not a poison. It generates enthu
siasm in much the same way that
other commodities generate en
thusiasm. (Why else would there
be all these incestuous promo
tions by Eric Clapton for Michelob
and Whitney Houston for Diet
Coke?)
The music is fun to get into
intense conniptions about because
it's usually idealess, harmless,
and because it usually contradicts
itself so much that its ill effects
cancel themselves out.
But even the most artful tunes,
the most sublime Hendrix riffs,
the most superb Aretha Franklin
vocals, the most scalding Wire
numbers, do not kill the intellect
or discourage commitment. The
best rock 45s (unless they're

pretentious glop not worth the
attention needed to drop the
needle) laugh at snide Chicken
Littles like Bloom and remind us,
above all, not to take rock so damn
eyebrow-furrowed seriously.
Rock certainly does not blind
you (if you're attentive, which it's
safe to say most college students
try to be) to any pernicious mes
sage it might be conveying, or for
that matter, any insidious trope
it might be carrying. The letters
of concern that poured into the
Daily after Fishbone played con
firm this.
Bloom reminds me of the sappy
clipboard-carrying pollsters in
Calvin Trillin's column who go
around collecting data to prove
how moronic the American public
is. They go up to kids who know
the name of every hummock that
ever pushed out of the earth, and
ask them where Baton Rouge is.
"Isn't that a continent someplace
near Cambodia?"
That's right, Bloom. We're all
hopeless imbeciles, held in sway
by poetry and motion. Plato is
spinning in his ivy-covered grave.

Bloom's alarmism aside, the
purpose of most music is to seduce
the mind into breaking intellec
tual bonds. That is the magic of
something as structured, elegant,
and contrived as a Bach concerto;
its purpose, above all, is to express
an outpouring of emotion to the
glory of God. Rock shares the
characteristics of seduction, con
fusion, and evocation with any
other music form you could name,
including the Chopin sonatas
Bloom likely listens to while sip
ping his aged sherry in his tatty
Chicago study.
The point here is that rock has
more in common (especially be
cause it is such a parasitic form)
with the genealogy of music, and
of American culture in general,
than Bloom would like to admit.
One of these commonalities, for
the most part, is emphatically and
determinedly not aesthetic pre
tension. Rock is music, and there

fore besieges the same visceral el
ements in us that any music does,
but it is before all else an insti
tution, an industry dispensing a
commodity like any other. If it
degrades the American mind, it
does so hand in hand with the
media, the advertisers whom the
media jerk off, and the products
those mutual sessions emit.
Bloom wants (ironically) to
solder rock, like a precious stone,
into a fourteen-carat ring and
declare it an art form in the same
way Beethoven and Coltrane's art
forms are. All the easier to make
false claims about the true impact
of the stuff. It's far easier to say
we're being hoodwinked into
being uncaring stiffs when it's an
art form that's hoodwinking us,
and not a disposable pop industry
that anyone in his right mind
wouldn't give a second thought to.
And the funny thing is that rock
will, as long as it is an industry
with profits to make and com
modities to break, and most im
portantly of all, fans of Tiffany
to impress, resist that metaphys
ical declaration. Rock makes no
claims to engaging the soul, as
Bloom thinks it does, and when
it does, it usually fails. Rock is at
its best when it is engaging the
animal in us, the animal enraged
by apartheid, horny for sex, or
enraptured with life. There is no
point in getting on the dance floor
and worrying about the post
modernist intellectual crisis.
The industry moguls who pump
out rock by the planeload every
day are obsessed with the next
chart-topping duet between
Dionne Warwick and Michael
Jackson, the next fiery and boring
piece of Glass Tiger fretwork, the
next piece of Johnny Hates Jazz
synth frippery, the next ultrason
ically diverting, pelvis-pleasing

Georgio dance mix. Rock thumbs
its nose and fluffs its long mane
in derision at the notion that it
could be anything like an art
form. Art is for losers who lan
guish fatly in the bar and com
plain about their two left feet.
Rock, in other words, does a
Fishbone at the notion that it is
anything like the threat Bloom
makes it out to be. It is a product,
not a poison. It generates enthu
siasm in much the same way that
other commodities generate en
thusiasm. (Why else would there
be all these incestuous promo
tions by Eric Clapton for Michelob
and Whitney Houston for Diet
Coke?)
The music is fun to get into
intense conniptions about because
it's usually idealess, harmless,
and because it usually contradicts
itself so much that its ill effects
cancel themselves out.
But even the most artful tunes,
the most sublime Hendrix riffs,
the most superb Aretha Franklin
vocals, the most scalding Wire
numbers, do not kill the intellect
or discourage commitment. The
best rock 45s (unless they're

pretentious glop not worth the
attention needed to drop the
needle) laugh at snide Chicken
Littles like Bloom and remind us,
above all, not to take rock so damn
eyebrow-furrowed seriously.
Rock certainly does not blind
you (if you're attentive, which it's
safe to say most college students
try to be) to any pernicious mes
sage it might be conveying, or for
that matter, any insidious trope
it might be carrying. The letters
of concern that poured into the
Daily after Fishbone played con
firm this.
Bloom reminds me of the sappy
clipboard-carrying pollsters in
Calvin Trillin's column who go
around collecting data to prove
how moronic the American public
is. They go up to kids who know
the name of every hummock that
ever pushed out of the earth, and
ask them where Baton Rouge is.
"Isn't that a continent someplace
near Cambodia?"
That's right, Bloom. We're all
hopeless imbeciles, held in sway
by poetry and motion. Plato is
spinning in his ivy-covered grave.

What do Fishbone and Allan
Bloom have in common?
Besides a presumed mutual
animosity (or, more likely, mutual
ignorance), both brought to mind
last month the incredible passion
college students invest in rock
music, that bastion of pop culture
that didn't even exist 35 years
ago, but which by now is so in
stitutionalized that some people
wish it would just consume itself
in its own orgiastic excesses and
die off.
Everybody over the age of 16
has something nasty to say about
rock and its racism, its misogyny,
its homophobia, its puerility, its
stupidity, its reliance on bald
faced clich6 while pretending to
be iconoclastic, its pure hypocrisy.
These are the same complaints
one could make about any insti
tution. Any institution, to en
hance its chances of survival,
relies on the overfrequent repeti
tion of certain hackneyed tropes.
In rock's case, those tropes can
be gleaned from any week's Top
Ten chart. Women are all angels
(Aerosmith), but we all, even
sweet females, have the devil in
side us (INXS). We all wish we
could make the devil go away, get
down to the simplest of levels,
and have pop-heaven bliss
(Terence Trent D'Arby). All men
are basically incomprehensible, so
to preserve their dignity, women
demand men to prove they're an
gelic at heart (Taylor Dayne).
After all, even naughty girls need
love (Samantha Fox).
Anything outside this adoles
cent picture of human relation
ships is roundly condemned by
the money-hungry pop songwriter
as obscene and threatening. What

more advertising for the procrea
tive agenda (and, increasingly, as
the industry goes neo-Connie
Francis on us, the marital agenda)
could a society need?
Allan Bloom, whose frighten
ingly successful diatribe "The
Closing of the American Mind"
became available in paperback a
couple of weeks ago at the Book
store, argues that college students
love rock music because there's
little else we aren't plumb scared
to death to commit ourselves to,
whether it's another person, an
other idea, or another act. But
Bloom again ignores the Connie
syndrome: most rock (especially
now, unless it's Depeche Mode)
unabashedly celebrates the notion
of commitment, in all its avatars.
Think about Fishbone for a sec
ond. They played in White Plaza
to a wildly receptive audience, and
their performance symbolized
everything that rock is about —
irreverence, bawdiness, loudness,
sweat, profanity, and just plain
obnoxiousness. What gets
Bloom's goat, apparently, is that
an institution could get away with
so much revolutionary posturing
and not be quashed by now.
Fishbone came. Fishbone con
quered. They snarled their way
through a set of music that was,
to say the least, blatantly conde
scending — as befitted an act that,
without the kind of visible success
that lends itself to gigs with more
famous acts in high-capacity
arenas, must rely for its upkeep
on performances in front of antsy
college kids with a little excess
libido to burn.
But contrary to what Bloom
would have seen had he been
standing on the sidelines, shaking
his graying head, the group
wasn't captivating us with some
jinxing, mindless blend of hyp

notic rhythm and subliminal
foolery. It was insulting the
daylights out of us, delivering a
manifesto of rage (and yes, even
commitment), and enjoying every
second of it. It was violating
Bloom's premise that revolution
not hide behind the petticoats of
the establishment.
The way Bloom drives his prem
ise home is to suggest that rock's
mixture of obscenity and respect
ability, agitation and stagnation,
overthrow and status quo, blinds
us to the polarities those opposites
convey. Our brain waves get
crossed, to put it simplistically,
and we begin flitting from hunk
to hunk and hunkette to hunk
ette, party to party, keg to keg,
cause to cause, book to book,
never spending enough time to
come to any conclusion more
meaningful than that everything
in the world is relative.
Bloom's alarmism aside, the
purpose of most music is to seduce
the mind into breaking intellec
tual bonds. That is the magic of

of concern that poured into the
Daily after Fishbone played con
firm this.
Bloom reminds me of the sappy
clipboard-carrying pollsters in
Calvin Trillin's column who go
around collecting data to prove
how moronic the American public
is. They go up to kids who know
the name of every hummock that
ever pushed out of the earth, and
ask them where Baton Rouge is.
"Isn't that a continent someplace
near Cambodia?"
That's right, Bloom. We're all
hopeless imbeciles, held in sway
by poetry and motion. Plato is
spinning in his ivy-covered grave.
