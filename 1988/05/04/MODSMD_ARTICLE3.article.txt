# Native Americans find home on Row

Stanford's Native Americans
refuse to be a forgotten minority.
Although they make up less
than one-tenth of 1 percent of the
student population, the 73 Native
Americans enrolled at Stanford
are striving to dispel the myths
and miconceptions surrounding
their culture.
"For too long, America has
treated its original citizens like
mascots instead of people." These
are the words below a Cleveland
Indians banner that hangs in
Lathrop House — the first Native
American theme house at Stan
ford.
Although Lathrop is currently
in transition and its status as a
theme house will not become of
ficial until next year, Native
American outreach programs are
indeed developing at the house.
In the fall, a Sioux medicine

man came to bless Lathrop. Be
cause of his beliefs, the medicine
man barred all women who were
menstruating from the ceremony.
Another program will occur to
morrow when Peter Zah, the
former tribal chair of the Navajo
Nation, leads a discussion on the
future of Native American educa
tion and the issues facing educa
tors.
Of Lathrop's 30 residents, six
are Native Americans and during
this year's Draw, special priority
was given to students of Native
American descent.
Lathrop will also have an in
house resident fellow next year.
Assistant Dean of Native Ameri
can Affairs Jim Larimore and his
wife Karen will live in the house.
"The first goal for the house is
a strong community for Indians
and non-Indians. We want the
residents' experience to be first
hand and not as spectators," said
Larimore, a Comanche Indian.
"The second goal, which is
equally important, is to establish
a place where Indians and non-
Indians can learn about each
other . . . through activities and
guest speakers," he explained.
As the smallest house on the
Row, Lathrop seemed an ideal
choice for the theme house, ac
cording to junior Steve Etsitty, a
member of the Stanford American
Indian Organization (SAIO) and
a current Lathrop resident.
"The fact that [Lathrop] is
pretty small. . . means that people
can get to know each other better.
We wanted a small house because
we (Native Americans) are a small
community." Etsitty said.
Etsitty went on to explain that
during last year's planning stages
Residential Education worked
with him and "a cone
[other Native Americanl students
to help facilitate the transition."
According to Assitant Dean of
Residential Education Alice Sup
ton, "One of the main concerns
of the core group was planning
and developing outreach pro
grams with a host of political, so
cial and cultural issues."
While Etsitty said that "re
sponse" from students during the
house's transition stage has been
"supportive," other Lathrop resi
dents had mixed reactions about
how the theme house was devel
oping this year.
"(For now) there is little pro
gramming. . . . [Lathrop] is just
like a regular Row house," said
Sean McGraw, Lathrop's resident
assistant.
Junior Sarah Patch, who has
lived in the house for the past
two years, said that "very little

1 chose to go to Stan
ford because there is
a strong Native Amer
ican department.'

has affected" her since the change
in Lathrop's status.
But all residents interviewed
agreed that the lack of theme
related activities was a result of
Lathrop being in transition.
Although it is unlikely that Na
tive American freshmen will live
at Lathrop, Etsitty said that he
and other SAID members will
make a concentrated effort to
reach all Native American stu
dents — as well as all students
interested in the American Indian
culture. ;i *
""Calling fne tneme house a
great idea," sophomore Marlene
Jones said that she would like to
live at Lathrop. Although Jones
is a Native American, there is
little chance for her to live in
Lathrop next year because her
housing is unguaranteed.
"I have not heard that much
about the theme house," sopho
more Todd Michael said. Lathrop
is "kind of hidden and small,"
said Michael, a Native American
who does not want to live in the
house next year.
But for freshman Cassandra
Nordstrand, a supportive cultural
environment is the place for her.
"I chose to go to Stanford because
there is a strong Native American
department. When I came here
there was a support group and I
felt welcome," said Nordstrand.
"I'm probably going to live in
Lathrop," she added.
