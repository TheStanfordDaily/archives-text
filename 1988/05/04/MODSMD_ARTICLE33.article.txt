## UOP falls 16-0 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Sure, it was a non
league game. Sure,
it was against the
University of the
Pacific. Sure, it
was a blowout.
But the Stanford

baseball team will take any victory
it can get at this point, and yes
terday's 16-0 defeat of the Tigers
at Sunken Diamond will do just
fine, thank you.
The Cardinal, which had lost
three in a row and five of its last
six, pounded out a season-high 20
hits — including four doubles and
a home run — while three
pitchers combined to six-hit the
visitors and record Stanford's
third shutout of the season.
Stanford, now 32-19 on the year
and in second place in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
with a 14-10 record, opens a cru
cial conference series against Cal
ifornia this Friday.
"Finally, we got a good one that
we won," said sophomore right
fielder Paul Carey, who paced the
Stanford attack, going 4-for-5
with five RBI and a double. "It's
good to get a victory like that
going into a series with Cal . . .
a win's a win, and we needed to
get off the losing track."
The game was a showcase of
the three pitchers — senior Lee
Plemel and freshmen Stan Spen
cer and Mike Mussina — who will
probably start against Cal this
weekend.
Plemel started and went four
innings, giving up four hits, strik
ing out six and walking none. He
recorded the victory to improve
his record to 7-8. Spencer also
pitched four innings, giving up
two hits and striking out three,
and Mussina pitched the ninth
inning, retiring the side in order
and fanning two. The Tigers
never advanced a runner past sec
ond.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said that Mussina probably will
start the series opener against Cal
on Friday, with Plemel starting
on Saturday and Spencer going
on Sunday.
"This was good — we needed

something like this," Marquess
said. "We pitched well, played
good defense and hit the ball well.
When you get a good outing from
the hitters like that, it becomes
contagious."
Stanford's scoring had a nice
progression: The Cardinal scored
one run in both the second and
third innings, two in the fifth,
four in the sixth and eight in the
seventh inning. All of Stanford's
starters had at least one hit.
Ed Sprague, a native of Stock
ton (where UOP is located),
ripped a two-run homer off Todd
Deck in the fifth. It was Sprague's
17th homer of the season, putting
him in third on the all-time Stan
ford single-season home run list,
behind Rick Lundblade's 25 in
1985 and Eric Hardgrave's 24 in
1983. Sprague, a junior, also holds
fourth place on the list with the
16 homers he hit last season.
Paul Carey, meanwhile, upped
his batting average to .324 (59-
for-182) with his four hits in five
at-bats. He knocked in three runs
with a bases-loaded double into
the right-center gap in the sixth
inning, and singled in another two
runs in the Cardinal's big
seventh.
Significantly, Carey, a left
handed hitter who usually hits to
the opposite field, sent three of
his four hits yesterday to right
field.
Carey said his pull-hitting was
just a matter of taking the pitches
where they came. The pitches
were inside, so he hit them to
right field.
Card notes
Santa Clara scored four times in
the bottom of the ninth inning and
once in the 10th to topple top-ranked
Fresno State 10-9 yesterday at Buck
Shaw Stadium, snapping the Bull
dogs' 32-game winning streak. Fresno
State was just two games shy of the
NCAA record for consecutive victories
— 34, set by Texas in 1977.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen
doubled off the fence in left-center in
the sixth to raise his season doubles
total to 17. That ties him with Ron
Witmeyer (1987), Mike Dottercr
(1982) and Mike Aldrete (1982) for
ninth on the all-time Stanford single
season doubles list. Paulsen needs
only three more two-baggers to tie
the school record of 20.



Senior Lee Plemel had one of his best outings of the season
yesterday, pitching four innings of four-hit ball and tallying six

James Rucker —-Dail
strikeouts. Stanford ended a three-game losing streak by beatin
UOP 16-0 at Sunken Diamond.

fourth place on the list with the
16 homers he hit last season.
Paul Carey, meanwhile, upped
his batting average to .324 (59-
for-182) with his four hits in five
at-bats. He knocked in three runs
with a bases-loaded double into
the right-center gap in the sixth
inning, and singled in another two
runs in the Cardinal's big
seventh.
Significantly, Carey, a left
handed hitter who usually hits to
the opposite field, sent three of
his four hits yesterday to right
field.
Carey said his pull-hitting was
just a matter of taking the pitches
where they came. The pitches
were inside, so he hit them to
right field.
Card notes
Santa Clara scored four times in
the bottom of the ninth inning and
once in the 10th to topple top-ranked
Fresno State 10-9 yesterday at Buck
Shaw Stadium, snapping the Bull
dogs' 32-game winning streak. Fresno
State was just two games shy of the
NCAA record for consecutive victories
— 34, set by Texas in 1977.
Sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen
doubled off the fence in left-center in
the sixth to raise his season doubles
total to 17. That ties him with Ron
Witmeyer (1987), Mike Dottercr
(1982) and Mike Aldrete (1982) for
ninth on the all-time Stanford single
season doubles list. Paulsen needs
only three more two-baggers to tie
the school record of 20.



Senior Lee Plemel had one of his best outings of the season
yesterday, pitching four innings of four-hit ball and tallying six

James Rucker —-Dail
strikeouts. Stanford ended a three-game losing streak by beatin
UOP 16-0 at Sunken Diamond.
