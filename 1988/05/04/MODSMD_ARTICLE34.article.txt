# Giants' rivalry is for the birds
## 
### 
People are making too big a deal over this
Giants-Cardinals rivalry.
These are two basically boring teams in
separate divisions. This will never work.
How often will the Giants and Cards play
each other for the National League pennant?
It's only happened once in my lifetime. So
most of the time when San Francisco and St.
Louis meet, it's pretty meaningless.

It makes a lot more sense for the Giants
to loathe and despise the Dodgers and Reds,
who are perennial contenders for the N.L.
West title, and who are more despicable than
the Cardinals anyway.
Likewise, St. Louis should concentrate on
their own divisional rival, the Mets. It's not
dificult to dislike the Mets, since they are the
most obnoxious team in baseball.
But back to S.F. and St. Louis. Boring,

boring, boring. The only two players with any
personality at all on the Giants are Jeffrey
Loenard and Will Clark, and Leonard is hitting
well below his weight, while Clark is so
juvenile, he's hard to take seriously.
The rest of the Giants are, in a word, bland.
I mean, Rick Reuschel is the ace of the pitch
ing staff. That pretty much sums up those
wild Humm-Babies. Good, but colorless. St.
Louis shortstop Ozzie Smith was probably
right when he remarked in that now infamous
GQ article that 19 out of 20 people don't
know who Bob Brenly is.
Gosh, those are fighting words, Ozzie. Take
that back about Bob Brenly. Everyone knows
he's the Giants' second baseman. Or is he a
relief pitcher? Oh, that's right. He's the other
catcher besides the equally famous Bob Mel
vin. What a catching corps. The two Bobs.
The idea of controversy swilring around
mild-mannered Ozzie Smith is pretty ridic
ulous, anyway. He's a great shortstop and
one of the nicest, most polite players in base
ball â€” a sport not exactly known for mannerly
athletes. And how could you not like a guy
who does backfiips on the field?
Plus, poor Ozzie is not in his right mind.
In that same article, the Oz claimed he should
have been named MVP in the National League
last year.

Ha ha ha. Sorry, Oz, but you weren't even
MVP on your own team last season. Jack
Clark, the pitching staff, and even Whitey
were more valuable.
They usually give the MVP to some one
who can hit, Oz. The Golden Glove is the
award given for fielding. Of course, Ozzie
already has a closet full of those. The glare
from all those gold mitts must have blinded
him from reality. He's obviously not playing
with a full deck, so don't get upset when he
criticizes the Giants.
In fact, now that Jack "I can't play, my
ankle/wrist/shoulder/otherbodypart hurts"
has masochistically defected to play (or not
play) for Steinbrenner/Martin, et. al., San
Francisco fans really have no one left to
resent. Who can you hate on the Cardinal
team? Who is on the Cardinal team?
The whole thing is pretty silly. I can guar
antee you that San Francisco and St. Louis
will not meet again in the N.L. playoffs this
year, and that the "rivalry" will die by next
year.
The ongoing series at Candlestick is proof
of the stupidity of this so-called bad blood.
The Cardinals are in second-to-last place, the
Giants are hovering around .500, and it's still
early in the season.
Basically, who cares?
