# Women sailors breeze to second
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
In a pertormance
that may earn it a
top national
ranking and even
a spot at the na
tional champion
ships, the Stanford

women's sailing team returned to
the top ranks of the Pacific Coast
region this weekend with a
second-place finish at the Re
gional Championship in Santa
Cruz.
Though the regatta drew a dis
appointingly small number of
schools, each of the West Coast's
strongest female skippers was
there to vie for the chance to rep
resent the home district when
UC-Santa Cruz hosts the national
championship later this year.
In the end, a veteran team from
UC-Irvinc topped the other com
petitors, leaving Stanford in the
alternate's spot, waiting to see
whether another team from out
side the region will forfeit its po
sition at the nationals.
Throughout the regatta, which
featured everything from gale
force winds and crashing waves
to whispering breezes and glassy

seas, Irvine and Stanford fought
with third-place Santa Cruz and
fourth-place California for the
regatta's top spot.
"We went up and down in the
standings with every puff of the
wind, it was so close," said soph
omore Kim Grose.
On Saturday, with the wind
blowing at over 35 mph, the boats
were literally up and down as
many competitors capsized while
completing the course. Particu
larly harrowing were the turning
marks, where the sailors had to
jibe, flipping the sail from one
side of the boat to the other, or
end up upside-down in the Santa
Cruz waves.
"In the second race, we were
in third when the two boats ahead
flipped over, leaving us in the
lead. We knew then it was jibe or
die," said senior Allie Rowe, who
sailed in the A Division.
Ultimately, the regatta was
decided in the last few races, when
Stanford couldn't quite find the
wind to pull ahead of Irvine.
"It was a bit disappointing to
come so close, but I'm definitely
pleased with the way our women's
team sailed. They showed that
practice can really pay orf, n Stan
ford Coach Blake Middleton said.

rest of the Cardinal women took second at the Regional Champi
onships off Santa Cruz last weekend.
