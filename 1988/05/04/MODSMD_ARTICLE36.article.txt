ORINDA, Calif.
— When is a
lamb not a
lamb? When it
turns into a
lion.
Just three

weeks ago, when the Stanford
men's golf team played a dual
match against California, Mark
Funseth shot the magical num
ber of three-under-par 69 to
lead the field. After that per
formance and the relatively
good performance of the other
Cardinal golfers, coach Wally
Goodwin predicted that the
field would tear up the par-72,
6,400-yard Orinda Golf and
Country Club course.
But something happened
during the three weeks leading
up to the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship. The denizens of
Orinda did not like the idea of
their course being a patsy, so
they narrowed the fairways
and grew tall grass around the
greens. As a result, the course
made absolute mincemeat of
the most talented golfers in the
nation Tuesday during the sec
ond round of the champion
ship.
Stanford, which played an
"average round as a team" ac
cording to sophomore Don
Christensen, came roaring
back into contention and cur
rently stands in fifth place,
only one shot behind fourth
place Oregon after finishing
Monday's first round dismally
in eighth place.
The Cardinal scored 382 as
a team Tuesday, eight shots
better than its performance in
the first round. The teams that
were ahead of Stanford did not
fare nearly as well.
Washington, which shot a
decent 369 in the second round,
still leads the tournament by
a comfortable margin of eight
over Arizona, which shot 372.
Arizona State shot 370 Tues
day and trails the leaders by
16 shots, while Oregon im
proved its standing to fourth
place, shooting 385.
California, playing on its
home course, scored a sky-high
396 in the second round and

fell into a tie for sixth with
Oregon State, which shot 385.
Individually, Washington's
O.D. Vincent leads the tourna
ment with a two-round total
of 143 (73-70).
Funseth made a huge move
for Stanford. He shot the third
best round of the day, a one
under-par 71. It was a far cry
from his first round 82, which
included an eagle on the 475-
yard par-5 12th hole. It gave
him a two-round total of 153,
good enough to tie him for 14th
place individually.
Sophomore Brad Joondeph
has been the most consistent
player for Stanford this week.
He shot a 75 in the second
round, which gives him a two
round total of 152 (77-75) and
puts him solidly in 13th place.
Rounding out the scoring for
the Cardinal were sophomore
Brad Benbrook's 154 (75-79),
junior John Mahon's 157 (79-
78), sophomore Josh Zander's
159 (80-79), and sophomore
Don Christensen's 161 (79-82).
"Yesterday when I shot 82,
I only really shot four bad
shots, which cost me three
double-bogeys. Today I only
really made one mistake and I
got lucky on that hole and
made par." Funseth said of his
round today. He also noted that
he was three-over par after
eight holes, but battled back
in the final ten holes to turn
in a great score.
According to Stanford Coach
Wally Goodwin, today's round
was good, but not good enough.
"We're going to have to play
better tomorrow to hold our
position," he said.
Goodwin said that such ex
perienced and talented teams
such as USC and UCLA would
"have their guns out" in the
final round and probably play
much more agressively than
they had the first two days.
Goodwin said that the Cardinal
would be playing its normal,
conservative game in the final
round in hopes of holding or
improving its position.
As Goodwin said before the
tournament started, a finish in
the top five of the Pac-10
"would be great progress from
where we were at the beginning
of the vear "
