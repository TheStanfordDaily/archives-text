# BSU wins fee assessment
## Newly-elected officers plan for productive new year 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Overseas students voted 61-17 to ap
prove the Black Student Union fee as
sessment after its preliminary defeat by
only eight votes in the campus-wide
ASSU elections held two weeks ago.
With a healthy budget for the upcom
ing year, members of the BSU have
also chosen new officers and are making
plans for the fall of 1988.
The results of close to 100 overseas
ballots were tabulated yesterday from
Stanford overseas campuses in Oxford,
Berlin, Florence and Washington, D.C.
No other overseas campus returned its
ballots by the deadline at 5 p.m. Mon
day.
The delay in the final count resulted
from confusion in the election process
when election officials decided not to
establish overseas polling sites. The
early results could not be validated until

the overseas ballots were then returned
to the ASSU.
The BSU fee request was the only
ballot measure whose status changed
after the overseas ballots were counted.
Elections Commissioner Steve Baer,
who had charged last week that the
ASSU Senate would not have collected
the overseas ballots "if (the BSU) had
lost by a larger margin or had won (its)
fee assessment," said he accepted the
outcome of yesterday's results, but still
voiced anger that the extra ballots were
collected at all.
Members of the BSU used the delay
in the elections to encourage voting
overseas to reverse the slim defeat of
the group's fee assessment in the
original returns.
According to BSU chair Bill King,
members of the BSU made phone calls
"almost every day" to friends or ac-

quaintances overseas to make
sure the elections took place and
that the results were sent to Stan
ford. The BSU also sent telegrams
to the directors of the various
overseas campuses reminding
them of the election.
King said he is "very glad" the
assessment was approved, but
added that students overseas
probably would have supported
the BSU fee request even without
the extra push by BSU members.
"Students sharp enough to go
overseas and become a minority
there, are sharp enough not to
have a bias against minority stu
dent organizations," he said.
In addition, overseas students
have had more exposure to the
national press, which has given
the BSU positive coverage in
recent months, King said.
Even if the BSU had lost the
funding from the ASSU, King said
the organization "would not have
been stopped" by the defeat, and
that the Stanford student body

"would have been hurt the most"
by a decision to reject the BSU
request.
"It is not a bright thing for a
student body that considers itself
diverse" to cut the funding of a
minority student group,
King said.
"The BSU is here to rock the
boat, because not many others do.
I would much rather see the BSU
not get any money for rocking
the boat too much than for the
BSU to get its money and do noth
ing," he said.
The BSU announced its new
officers for next year at its general
meeting Monday night. Members
of the black community cast their
ballots two weeks ago after can
didates gave speeches earlier,
King said.
Mary Dillard, a sophomore
living in Ujamaa House this year,
will replace King as chair of the
BSU next year.
The new vice chairs are soph
omore Cheryl Taylor and Bill
Faucette, the treasurer is Joel
Martin, the secretary is Louis
Jackson, the general representa
tive is Dereca Blackmon, and the
communications coordinator is

Nomi Martin. All the new officers
except Dillard and Taylor are
freshmen.
Dillard, who is a double mtyor
in history and Afro-American
Studies, said community service
will be the highest priority for
the BSU next year, and existing
programs will be strengthened.
Although the Area One (Western
Culture) requirement will no
longer be the focus of the BSU's
activities, "We're not going to
drop it. We'll always be concerned
with the curriculum," Dillard
said.
She said she will work at uni
fying the black community on
campus and involving "more black
students in programs in East Palo
Alto, tutoring and community
service."
Dillard said she believes that
any image problems the BSU has
probably are the result of lack of
attention to the group's commu
nity service work.
"The reputation of the BSU this
year has been questionable be
cause most students do not know
all we do," she said. "Our com

munity service work does not get
covered."
Both King and Dillard said they
were "pleased" with the new of
ficer corps. According to King, the
new officers are "very experi
enced" and the group is "well
balanced," drawing on veteran
BSU members and students who
are active in other sectors of the
community as well.
King said the BSU probably will
not have to fight as much next
year. "It will not be as bitter a
struggle as this year, which was
just battle after battle," he said,
referring to the organization's
fight to change the Western Cul
ture requirment and the criticism
the group faced for levying
charges of racism in the ASSU
Senate.
"I'm jealous of (next year's of
ficers) because they will have a
chance to actually implement a
new Area One requirement, new
community service projects and
programs supported by the new
ASSU and COP. They will be able
to focus on making projects the
best possible, rather than spend
ing half the time defending the
project itself," he said.
