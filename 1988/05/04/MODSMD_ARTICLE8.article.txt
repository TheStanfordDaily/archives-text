# IFC criticizes task force report

### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
In its first effort to respond to the
Final Report of the University Task
Force Report on Fraternities and
Sororities, the Interfraternity Council
last night expressed dissatisfaction with
the task force's recommendations.
In a special meeting designed to pro
vide Fraternal Affairs Advisor Joe
Pisano with information before he
makes recommendations on the report
to Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons,
Alpha Epsilon Pi President Mike Fox
said the report reflected the task force's
desire to weaken the fraternal system.
"It's a basic dislike of fraternities
masked by other things," Fox said.
"Some of this stuff is outrageous."
"The recommendations are fuzzy and
unclear," added Jonathan Schwartz, a

Sigma Alpha Mu member.
But Pisano argued that the discussion
excited by the report is healthy. "Times
do change and we have to re-evaluate
policy as they do," he said.
Only six fraternity members and the
five IFC officers attended the meeting.
IFC President Vinny Frost expressed
dismay at the low attendance. "I hope
fraternities aren't too complacent and
thinking everything will stay the same
as it is now," he told the group.
The report, released on Feb. 16, was
compiled by a committee appointed in
1983 to discern the degree to which
"fraternal organizations at Stanford
(should) be encouraged or discouraged"
at Stanford.
Most of the debate at last night's
meeting centered around two recom
mendations — the second and fifth —
from the report.

The second recommendation of the
task force states that the assignment
of student housing may not be based
on subjective criteria, such as those used
by fraternities during Rush.
Reacting to this recommendation, fra
ternity members argued that subjective
selection processes form the core of the
fraternal system.
Pisano agreed, saying, "The very na
ture of fraternities is subjective selec
tion."
IFC Vice-President Stuart Levy said
the University should attempt to solve
the housing problem for all students
instead of targeting fraternities.
"If the University would guarantee
four years of housing, maybe this
wouldn't be a problem," he said.
But Pisano said the issue of subjective
selection would exist regardless of the
