# ASSU OKs election results despite heated controversy
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Despite some controversy about overseas cam
paigning, the ASSU Senate last night finally cer
tified this spring's election results, including the
Black Student Union's approved fee request.
The senate unanimously certified all election
results with the exception of the BSU fee request,
which was considered separately because of ques
tions about possible campaign violations. The
BSU results were eventually certified by a 15-5
vote after a lengthy debate.
In its first meeting televised by SUNet, the
University channel, the senate also approved a
bill to grant equal University privileges for
spouses of gay students. The bill was approved
to pressure the University to allow gay students
who consider themselves "married" — even
though they are not legally recognized as such
— to be housed in University housing for married
students.
Also, in what publisher Don Lee called a "last
resort" action, Release magazine requested a
$3,000 loan from the ASSU Publications Board.
The senate approved the loan by a 15-to-3 vote
to save the financially troubled arts and enter
tainment magazine, which lost its $11,880 fee
request in the spring elections.
A fourth bill, which passed by a 19-to-l vote,
urges the University to thoroughly investigate
the firing of employee Long Quach. The circum
stances under which Quach was hired and fired
are being challenged by the United Stanford
Workers union.
Concerning the BSU fee request, a number of
senators questioned whether the BSU cam
paigned overseas and if such campaigning violated
ASSU bylaws. Many senators proposed that the
matter be referred to the ASSU Hearings Officer
to determine whether there would be "grounds
for disqualification" of the BSU fee request.
Senator Peter Thiel, a senior, said campaigning

after preliminary results were announced is a
"clear violation of the bylaws." Although no
senators were sure whether the BSU campaigned
overseas, Thiel asserted that the "overwhelming
margin" in favor of the BSU overseas showed
evidence of "extensive overseas campaigning" by
the BSU.
Thiel said the "peculiar circumstances" of the
overseas balloting warranted the senate's confir
mation "pending investigation by the election
hearings commissioner."
However, BSU member Nomi Martin argued

ASSU Senator Peter Thiel argues that the BSU
clearly violated senate by-laws by campaigning
for votes from students on overseas campuses.
