# ASSU OKs election results despite heated controversy
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Despite some controversy about overseas cam
paigning, the ASSU Senate last night finally cer
tified this spring's election results, including the
Black Student Union's approved fee request.
The senate unanimously certified all election
results with the exception of the BSU fee request,
which was considered separately because of ques
tions about possible campaign violations. The
BSU results were eventually certified by a 15-5
vote after a lengthy debate.
In its first meeting televised by SUNet, the
University channel, the senate also approved a
bill to grant equal University privileges for
spouses of gay students. The bill was approved
to pressure the University to allow gay students
who consider themselves "married" — even
though they are not legally recognized as such
— to be housed in University housing for married
students.
Also, in what publisher Don Lee called a "last
resort" action, Release magazine requested a
$3,000 loan from the ASSU Publications Board.
The senate approved the loan by a 15-to-3 vote
to save the financially troubled arts and enter
tainment magazine, which lost its $11,880 fee
request in the spring elections.
A fourth bill, which passed by a 19-to-l vote,
urges the University to thoroughly investigate
the firing of employee Long Quach. The circum
stances under which Quach was hired and fired
are being challenged by the United Stanford
Workers union.
Concerning the BSU fee request, a number of
senators questioned whether the BSU cam
paigned overseas and if such campaigning violated
ASSU bylaws. Many senators proposed that the
matter be referred to the ASSU Hearings Officer
to determine whether there would be "grounds
for disqualification" of the BSU fee request.
Senator Peter Thiel, a senior, said campaigning

after preliminary results were announced is a
"clear violation of the bylaws." Although no
senators were sure whether the BSU campaigned
overseas, Thiel asserted that the "overwhelming
margin" in favor of the BSU overseas showed
evidence of "extensive overseas campaigning" by
the BSU.
Thiel said the "peculiar circumstances" of the
overseas balloting warranted the senate's confir
mation "pending investigation by the election
hearings commissioner."
However, BSU member Nomi Martin argued

ASSU Senator Peter Thiel argues that the BSU
clearly violated senate by-laws by campaigning
for votes from students on overseas campuses.
that no campaigning was done by
the BSU at overseas campuses.
Because she said the BSU heard
conflicting opinions on the legality
of campaigning, she said the BSU
only sent a telegram to each over
seas campus to "make sure all
overseas students vote." The
telegrams made "no mention of
the BSU fee assessment or the
preliminary results," according to
Martin.
Graduate senator Don
Gagliardi added that different in
terpretations of the bylaws might
even allow overseas campaigning
in this year's case. "If there was
lobbying by the BSU, and that's
a big if, that is not necessarily
grounds for disqualification," he
said.
Pollmaster Steve Krauss, next
year's elections commissioner,
said it would be "extremely un
likely that the hearings officer
would overturn" the BSU victory.
"The whole election has been
botched by senate politicking," he

said, adding that the elections
commission wants to conclude the
election without further contro
versy.
In other business last night, the
senate approved a number of Pro
gram Board and Community
Service allocations for campus
groups. Approved appropriations
included $13,222 from the Pro
gram Board Sixth Discretionary
Fund, $45,653 from annual Pro
gram Board funds and $22,324 of
annual community service alloca
tions.
One of the few allocations ques
tioned was a recommendation to
give only $2,030 to the Stanford
AIDS Education Project. The ap
propriations committee recom
mended that amount — rather
than the $3,230 which was re
quested by the project — because
it felt the project should charge
students for contraceptives dis
tributed by the Safer Sex Shoppe.
Project coordinator Daniel Bao
said the Safer Sex Shoppe has
been "one of the more successful
programs we've done," emphasiz
ing the difference between that
program and an earlier one which
distributed safe sex kits.
