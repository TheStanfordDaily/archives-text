# African National Congress urges end to colonialism
## 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
Pallo Jordan, a ranking member of
the African National Congress, criticized
the"de facto military alliance between
the U.S. and the Pretoria regime" yes
terday, calling for an end to U.S. defense
of colonialism in Southern Africa and
"genuine disinvestment."
Addressing an audience of 45 in the

History Corner, the director of research
for South Africa's leading opposition
group condemned Stanford's policy of
selective divestment in companies that
conduct business in South Africa.
"Universities have played a significant
role in pushing for total disinvestment,"
Jordan said, "but this has mainly been
due to the agitating of the students

themselves, more than the actions
of trustees and regents."
Jordan called for "genuine dis
investment," which would not
only induce U.S. businesses to
pull out of South Africa, but
which would also ensure that
those companies did not continue
operation under a different name.
Total disinvestment is also a goal
of Stanford Students for a Free
South Africa, a group which co
sponsored Jordan's talk.
SFSA member Will Masters, a
graduate student at the Food Re
search Institute, said he hoped
Jordan's visit would renew inter
est in South Africa and Stanford's
investment policies. SFSA organ
izer Mia Lewis, a graduate stu
dent in education, noted that
campus interest in the issue had
"fizzled out" from previous levels
of involvement. In 1985, protests
and sit-ins by Stanford Out of
South Africa helped to encourage
the Board of Trustees to recon
sider the University's invest
ments in South Africa.
As SFSA members set up
crosses in White Plaza to
memorialize those killed by the
South African regime, members
of the group said their immediate
target is a board of trustees meet

ing Monday. SFSA will host a
candlelight vigil Sunday night
before the trustees meet to review
the current divestment policy.
In March, the trustees' Special
Committee on Investment
Responsiblity modified the policy
for voting on stockholder resolu
tions calling for withdrawal or dis
investment. The trustees now
may cast their proxies in favor of
the resolution or they may abstain
from voting. In no case may the
board vote against a resolution.
Stanford's portfolio of compan
ies with South African holdings
is valued at approximately $161

million.
While lauding the "quite
remarkable anti-apartheid move
ment" in the United States, Jor
dan acknowledged a decline in
U.S. activism. He attributed the
change to a lack of information
fostered by a press ban instituted
in 1985.
"(South African Prime Minis
ter) P.W. Botha's press restric
tions removed awareness of South
Africa," he said. "As people's
awareness decreases their level of
activism and agitation recede."
Jordan also cautioned against
viewing disinvestment as a
panacea for problems between the
United States and South Africa.
He criticized U.S. support for
rebels in neighboring Angola and
the Reagan administration policy
of "linkage," connecting a South
African withdrawal from occupied
Namibia with a Cuban troop with
drawal from Angola.
Jordan joined the ANC in his
teens in 1960, although he says
he has "been political" since age
six. He left South Africa in 1962
under the advice of ANC leaders
and has never returned. Head
quarters of the outlawed ANC are
in Lusaka, Zambia.
In the past, critics have at
tacked the ANC for its advocacy
of violence to topple the white,
minority regime in South Africa.
"We are not willing to buy peace
at the price of slavery," he said.
