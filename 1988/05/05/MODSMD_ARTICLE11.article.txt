# Small campus journals face funding pinch
## 
### Gaby Banks 
The recent spring voting
returns forecast another tough
year for the ASSIJ Publications
Board, an organization that
provides funds and guidance
for most student publications
at Stanford.
Because the board's proposal
for a 20 percent increase in
funding was voted down for the
fourth year in a row in this
year's election, many campus
publications will be forced to
compete for the limited funds
the Publications Board will
receive from the ASSU.
Proceeds from the fee in
crease would have supplied
discretionary funding to over
14 publications and gone to the
improvement of the board's fa
cilities in the Storke Building,
which are shared by many of
these organizations.
Keith Seinfeld, the current
director of the board, said that
as a result of the election "it's
not likely that there will be
much — if any — money for
new publications. It's going to
take a lot of creative fundrais
ing to keep them alive."
Chris Adamson, next year's
board director, said he believes
the board's budget has not in
creased in three years. "We're
still operating on 1984 dollars,"
he said.
Adamson attributed the
repeated loss of its fee request
to the wording on the election
ballots every year, which offers
students the option of voting

for no increase, a 10 or 20 per
cent increase, or a 10 or 20
percent decrease.
The current system does not
work, Adamson said, "because
it makes a zero percent change
the most likely outcome of the
election."
"People aren't going to vote
for an increase unless they've
had some kind of contact with
a publication," Seinfeld said.
Commenting on the board's
pre-election publicity cam
paign, Seinfeld pointed out
what he called "a catch in the
system".
The Publications Board
"should not have to devote our
time and energy to publicizing
ourselves," he said.
The one consolation for the
board comes in the victories of
other groups. SaLSA, a cul
tural umbrella organization in
the Chicano-Latino communi
ty, won a fee assessment that
will fund two publications,
"Estos Tiempos" and "El
Aguila." Originally, the board
budgeted for those two news
papers.
However, Adamson assessed
that the discretionary funding
is still fairly tight.
Seinfeld said that because
there was no increase in fund
ing last year, this year's board
has not been able to give many
groups the amount of funding
they expected.
"We've softened the blow,"
he explained, "by dipping into
reserves."
