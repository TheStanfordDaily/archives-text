# Mexican holiday spurs campus celebration
## 
### Dennis Lee 
Today is Cinco de Mayo, and
campus celebration of this tradi
tional Mexican holiday will con
tinue over the next few weeks and
include art displays, music and
speakers from the Chicano com
munity.
Some highlights of the celebra
tion include a dance and dinner
at Casa Zapata, a display of in
digenous Mexican art and a con
cert given by MALO, a Chicano
rock group.
One prominent event at Casa
Zapata will be the appearance of
Arturo Vargas on May 7. Vargas,
a Stanford graduate with a
master's degree in education, is
expected to speak about the state
of education for the Chicano com
munity and about amnesty for il
legal aliens in the United States.
The art display features work
by the Huichol, an Indian people
who live on the Pacific coast of
Mexico. Tony Burciaga, resident
fellow at Casa Zapata, described
the work as "impressive." The
paintings, which have strong re
ligious symbolism, are presently
at El Centro Chicano. The display
will run from May 2-14.
MALO, a nationally known rock
group, will give a concert at Wil
bur Field May 8, followed by the
Bandidos and Dr. Loco, two other
groups who play Chicano rock.
Between the band perform
ances, John Ceremenio, a worker
at a youth counseling agency in
San Jose, will talk about the high
school walkouts in the 1960s by
Chicanos who demanded better
education.
The festivities, a celebration of
Mexican patriotism, have been
sponsored by a number of student
groups on campus, including

MEChA, SaLSA, El Centro
Chicano and Casa Zapata.
MEChA Co-Coordinator Lucky
Gutierrez said that the objectives
of the celebration are to "promote
Chicano culture and to add to the
cultural diversity on campus."
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean
of Graduate Studies and resident
fellow at Zapata, said that the
festivities are "more than just
music and food." Many important
issues — such as immigration,
language and the state of higher
education for the Chicano com
munity — will be stressed by the
various speakers.
She emphasized that the pur

pose of the events is to "keep alive
our bicultural richness." It is a
chance to bring together the Stan
ford community as a whole and
to emphasize multi-ethnic partic
ipation, she said.
"Overall, all ethnic communi
ties really celebrate events such
as this to share with the greater
community part of their own his
tory, values and culture."
Mrs. Burciaga also commented
that Stanford is an important in
stitution because many Mexican-
Americans in this part of the
country identify with it."The
campus mirrors its Hispanic
roots," she said, citing the

Hispanic origins of the architec
ture and the names of many of
the streets.
She also remarked that Cinco
de Mayo serves as an educational
experience for many here who
have no conception of the ethnic
history and future of the South
west. Stressing cooperation be
tween the different ethnic groups,
she said that "too many people
isolate themselves."
The events are open to area
residents as well as members of
the Stanford community.
Other events occurring at
Zapata May 7 include the playing
of mariachi music by Azteca.
