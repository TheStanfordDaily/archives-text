Blast destroys rocket fuel plant
HENDERSON, Nev. — Three searing ex
plosions of orange flame yesterday destroyed
a plant that makes rocket fuel for the space
shuttle and flattened a candy factory next
door. Reports from the scene were confused,
and the number of fatalities, if any, was not
immediately known.
Early reports from Clark County officials
put the number of dead at nine, but Marc
Hechter of the county's Emergency Operations
Bureau said officials were unable to confirm
this count later in the day. "We're just now
getting into the fire zone," Hechter said in an
evening telephone interview.
Nevada Gov. Richard Bryan, who was at
the scene, said there were two people missing
but no confirmed deaths.
"It would appear we've been extraordinarily
fortunate at this point," Bryan said. "This
thing could have been much worse. If there
are no confirmed deaths, this could be a
miracle."
The explosions jolted an airliner in the sky,
flipped some cars and knocked others off a
state highway, threw pedestrians to the ground
in Henderson; shook hotel-casinos in Las
Vegas 15 miles north and blew a massive black
cloud of acrid smoke high into the desert sky
over much of southern Nevada.
Contra leader fights for post
WASHINGTON — Enrique Bermudez, tar
get of a campaign to oust him as the
Nicaraguan contras' military commander,
came here this week to launch a counterattack
to keep his post and has denounced Adolfo
Calero, a top Contra political leader, as "dis
loyal" and "irresponsible," according to sources
close to Bermudez.
Bermudez has leveled his most severe
criticism at Calero in meetings with U.S. of
ficials involved in the Contra program and
has accused Calero of masterminding the plot
to remove him, according to a U.S. official
and Bermudez allies.
Calero denied yesterday that he is attempt
ing to oust Bermudez.
U.S. officials have expressed great concern
about the widening struggle within the Contra
leadership because it comes as the U.S.-backed
rebels are engaged in sensitive negotiations
with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista govern
ment to end their seven-year civil war.
Teamsters head may step down
Teamsters President Jackie Presser told the
union's executive board yesterday that he was
taking a four-month leave of absence because
of health problems, knowledgeable sources
said.
Some sources in the union believe that yes
terday's action is the first step toward Pres
ser's relinquishing of his authority permanent
ly-
Presser told the executive board via an union
computer hookup that Weldon Mathis, the
union's secretary-treasurer and second
ranking official, will step into the president's
job for the next four months, as the union's
constitution provides.
Presser, 61, had surgery for lung cancer last
year and has been undergoing radiation treat
ments. In the computer message, Presser said
his doctors at the Cleveland clinic had advised
him in the last few days to undertake more
radiation therapy.
