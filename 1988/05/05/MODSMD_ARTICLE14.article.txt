# 40 Shiites, 3 soldiers killed in fierce fighting
## Israel ends raid into South Lebanon 
### 
JERUSALEM — Israeli troops
pulled back from positions north of
their self-proclaimed security zone in
southern Lebanon yesterday night
after a day of fierce battles in which
three Israeli soldiers and more than
40 Lebanese Shiite militiamen were
killed, according to Israeli military of
ficials.
Most of them died in an intense
firefight around the Lebanese village
of Maydun. Hundreds of Israeli troops
backed by helicopter gunships and ar
tillery stormed the area, which Israeli
officials described as the southernmost
base of Hezbollah, the radical Moslem
Shiite militia challenging Israeli forces
and their Christian Lebanese allies in
the area.
Yesterday's fighting reportedly
brought Israeli troops within five miles
of Syrian defense lines in Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley and at one point Israeli
artillery shelled a village containing a
Syrian outpost. But while the Syrians
remained on high alert, they refrained
from retaliation and the Israeli oper
ation appeared to have ended last night
without a direct confrontation between
the two armies.
Israel's "Operation Law and Order"
began early Tuesday with sweeps and

house-to-house searches in at least
eight villages in the foothills of Mount
Hermon in southeast Lebanon, where
troops looked for Palestinian gunmen
and arms caches used to infiltrate
northern Israel. There were no
clashes.
Military officials had portrayed the
operation, the largest Israeli thrust
inside Lebanon in over two years, as
a "limited" action designed to stymie
Palestinian efforts to use the region
as a corridor for attacks on Israel. But
yesterday the search operation turned
into a full-scale battle as the Army
turned its attention to Hezbollah gun
men occupying hilltop fortifications in
Maydun, located west of Tuesday's op
eration.
The military officials hinted that the
Israelis had not anticipated yesterday's
fierce resistance, expecting the Hez
bollah men to melt away to the north
the same way Palestinian guerrillas
did Tuesday. "In Maydun, Hezbollah
decided to make a stand," Col. Ranaan
Gissin, the Army's deputy spokesman,
told reporters at a press conference
last night. "If Hezbollah would not
have engaged us, we would not have
fought."
Israeli political leaders apparently

also were taken by surprise by yester
day's clash. At a meeting of the policy
making group of ministers known as
the Inner Cabinet, two senior mem
bers reportedly expressed reservations
about the operation, suggesting they
had been misled by Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and senior Army offi

ciaJs into believing that the two-day
action inside Lebanon, which report
edly involved nearly 2,000 troops by
its conclusion, would not lead to a
direct confrontation with Lebanese
Shiites.
