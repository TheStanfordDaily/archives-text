# 3 more hostages freed

PARIS — The last three French
hostages held in Beirut were re
leased last night and headed home
after three years of being im
prisoned by Islamic extremists.
Their unexpected liberation,
announced here by the Interior
Ministry, could provide a much
needed boost to the presidential
campaign of Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac only four days
before the runoff vote against
President Francois Mitterrand
The three released hostages —
Marcel Carton, 64; Marcel Fon
taine, 45, and Jean-Paul Kauf
fmann, 43 — were escorted by a
Shiite Moslem cleric to the seaside
Summerland Hotel in southern
Beirut, Washington Post special
correspondent Nora Boustany re
ported from Beirut. French Inte
rior Minister Charles Pasqua,
who has managed the hostage ne
gotiations for Chirac, said they
were handed over to Jean-Charles
Marchiani, a former intelligence
agent who served as Pasqua's en
voy, and flown out aboard an ex
ecutive jet. Pasqua said the plane

would arrive here today.
In Washington, the State De
partment said it was awaiting
details of the terms under which
the men were released. "We would
be concerned by any sign that con
cessions were made," a statement
said. "We believe concessions en
courage future kidnapings and
could prolong the captivity of
other hostages."
Kauffmann, interviewed by a
French radio station in midflight
via radio telephone, said, "We are
not in too bad shape, I think, it
is up to our families, our relatives
to judge."
Carton and Fontaine, identified
as diplomats, were kidnaped
March 22, 1985, and Kauffmann,
a magazine reporter, was ab
ducted May 22 the same year. All
three kidnapings were acknowl
edged by Islamic Jihad, which
anti-terrorism specialists say is a
name used by the security arm
of Hezbollah, or Party of God, an
Iranian-linked Shiite Moslem or
ganization in Lebanon.
