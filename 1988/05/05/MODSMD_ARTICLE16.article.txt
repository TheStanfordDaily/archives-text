# House cuts SDI funding
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The House
voted yesterday to cut funding for
President Reagan's "Star Wars"
missile defense system to $3.5 bil
lion in fiscal 1989, and lawmakers
predicted that most of the savings
would be earmarked for the gov
ernment's war on drugs.
The reduction was adopted by
a vote of 223-195 as an amend
ment to a $299.5 billion defense
spending bill for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. Sponsored by
Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., the
amendment would provide $400
million less than was appropriated
in fiscal 1988 for "Star Wars,"

known formally as the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
Reagan has threatened to veto
the bill if funding for the program
fell below $4 billion. But the fig
ure ultimately approved by
Congress could be at least that
high if the Senate, which has yet
to act on the defense bill, approves
a higher level.
In fact, many House members
said that they were supporting
the Bennett amendment in order
to insure that the final figure
would be about $4 billion.
