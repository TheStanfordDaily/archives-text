# Church seeks to mediate labor troubles in Poland
## 
### 
GDANSK, Poland â€” The Roman
Catholic Church entered Poland's labor
conflict yesterday, dispatching teams of
church intellectuals to speak with strik
ing steel workers and shipyard employ
ees in an effort to mediate between the
workers and the Communist govern
ment.
There was no clear indication that the
government would accept the church's
mediation role or abide by any of its
recommendations. Moreover, the gov
ernment's chief press representative ac
cused the strikers of "terrorist actions,"
suggesting that the authorities may be
preparing to adopt a tougher approach
to a wave of increasingly political labor
unrest.
"We shall prevent anarchy," press rep
resentative Jerzy Urban vowed
So far, Polish authorities have used
the police only to prevent massive
marches in support of the strikers. They
have made no move to use force to end
the strikes at two of the nation's largest
industrial enterprises, a steel mill at
Nowa Huta and the shipyards in
Gdansk.
The emissaries from the Roman Cath
olic Episcopate in Warsaw arrived at
midday at the shipyard, which has been
shut by strikers since Monday. They
met with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa
and the strike committee of the banned
independent trade union.
"We are here to invent a solution and
to push it forward," said Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, the editor of a leading Cath
olic publication and a longtime adviser
to Solidarity, whose members are de
manding official reinstatement of the
union in the shipyard. Accompanying
Mazowiecki was Andrzej Wielowieski, an
economist.
Officials in the government press of

fice in Warsaw declined to confirm or
deny that the church effort was under
taken at the government's suggestion
or had its backing. The members of the
mediation teams are all well known for
their close association with Solidarity.
Another team appointed by the church
met with striking steel workers at the
Lenin steelworks in Nowa Huta, where
a Solidarity-backed work stoppage has
gone on for nine days. Negotiations be
tween the striking workers at Nowa
Huta, when? there are 32,000 employees,
and representatives of management
have been at a standstill for nearly a
week.
At the Gdansk shipyard, with 11,000
employees, a similar deadlock held for
a second day, with spokesmen for man
agement and the official, government
sanctioned union reporting that wage
issues had been settled. Remaining is
sues, principally the recognition of
Solidarity as a union in the shipyard,
were in the hands of the government,
they added.
"This is a political decision and must
be made in Warsaw," said Wlodzimierz
Ziolkowski, the management spokes
man.
A statement by the Communist Party
Politburo, published yesterday, con
tained language that could be read as
conciliatory, stressing the need for "fur
ther reformlike steps" such as "socialist
pluralism" and "development of democ
racy." But it also stressed the need for
order, the principal message in Urban's
comments, which were made later.
Any solution to the "current conflicts
and problems" in Poland, the Politburo
said, "must be accompanied by realism
and feelings of responsibility for
Poland's future."
