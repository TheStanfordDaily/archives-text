## Modest proposals 
### 
EVER an effective watchdog,
the Multicultural Council
last week once again criti
cized proposed guidelines for the
enforcement of the Law School's
policy against discriminatory activ
ities by law firms recruiting on
campus.
A coalition of women and mi
nority law student groups, the
council has called since last fall for
the Law School to put teeth into
its non-discrimination policy. Two
of its current demands are justi
fied, but one is not.
Under the current plan, a Law
School dean selects the student
who sits on the three-member
oversight committee that enforces
the policy. This is clearly prepos
terous. The council rightly de
mands that students choose their
own representative.
The second assertion by the
council also deserves support,
namely that the oversight commit
tee, when it determines that a firm
has engaged in discrimination on
or off campus, must take the min
iumum action of publicizing its
findings through memos to stu
dents and notices in the school's
career services office.
Far from being the restrictive
mandate that the Law School
fears, this request for cautious yet
definitive action takes into account
the full range of behavior that the
term "discrimination" can encom
pass.
The Law School's current en
forcement procedure is to investi
gate charges of discrimination and
apply sanctions where necessary
on a case-by-case basis. Measures
could include publicizing discrimi
natory conduct, as well as harsher
steps like barring the firm from
campus for the next recruiting
season.
The school claims that "discrim
ination" can cover a very broad

range of actions, and so specific
responses should not be simply
mandated.
But the publicizing sanction is
only the barest of steps. It is
analogous to receiving a traffic
ticket, no matter how heinous the
discriminatory offense.
A firm that routinely discrimi
nates in hiring on the basis of sex
would be publicized at least as
much as another whose represen
tative unintentionally makes a
sexist remark during an interview,
even though the former crime is
more repugnant.
So as a minimum step, the coun
cil's approach is more than
reasonable. In fact, it should be
augmented by a requirement that
the committee always provide
public explanation of its reasoning
when it fails to take further steps
to deal with firms it finds guilty
of discrimination.
But the council's third request
is unreasonable, arguing that one
member of the oversight commit
tee must be a woman or person of
color.
This demand stereotypes the
views of women and minorities and
assumes that white males cannot
fairly judge cases of discrimination.
Such a requirement would also
exclude other people who could be
targets of discrimination, such as
disabled white people or gay white
males, whose rights the council is
working to protect.
In proposing an oversight com
mittee that carefully responds to
the concerns of students being
recruited on campus, the Law
School has demonstrated a desire
to handle discrimination charges
in a fair, measured way.
However, the school should not
be scared off by the council's pro
posals to make a good system even
better.
