Former Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon will become dean
of admissions at Princeton Uni
versity effective July 1.
Hargadon, who served as dean
at Stanford from 1969 to 1984,
said he took the job because he
"missed students and university
life in general. ... It became clear
to me after a while that I wanted
to come back to a university."
He said he "will always have a
special place in [His] heart for
Stanford," but that returning to
Stanford as a dean was out of the
question because "Stanford has
such a great dean in Jean Fetter,"
he said.
Hargadon left Stanford in 1984
to become a senior officer at the
College Board, a New York-based
non-profit education group that
provides testing and other serv
ices to colleges and universities.
Currently a senior adviser to the
president of the College Board,
Hargadon will finish a study of
admissions to U.S. colleges and

universities before joining Prince
ton.
Hargadon said that while he
was glad to take a break from the
college lifestyle, he is looking for
ward to his new post because
"dean of admissions is the most
interesting job in a university."
Hargadon said his involvement
with Princeton began when offi
cials there contacted him for ad
vice about choosing a new dean
of admissions.
"The more we talked about [the
job]," Hargadon said, "the more
interested I became."
Hargadon cited his admiration
for Princeton and his acquaint
ance with faculty there as primary
reasons for accepting the offer.
According to a written state
ment by Princeton Dean of the
College Nancy Weiss, Hargadon's
appointment is "a wonderful op
portunity for Princeton."
"Fred Hargadon brings to the
deanship extraordinary qualities
of imagination and vision and un
paralleled knowledge of and ex
perience in college admissions,"
she wrote. "We Eire extremely for
tunate to have been able to attract

someone of such stature to this
critically important position."
Hargadon said he does not view
Stanford and Princeton as rival
schools, noting that while both
Princeton and Stanford are com

peting for some of the same stu
dents, they draw many of their
applicants from different regions.
While on the Farm, Hargadon
was one of the most popular fig
ures on campus. Known affec
tionately as "Dean Fred," he was

chosen as Class Day speaker for
six consecutive years beginning in
1979, and was also a recipient of
the Dinkelspiel Award for out
standing service to undergraduate
education.
Hargadon said that he contin
ues to be involved with Stanford
and presently serves on the Stan
ford Alumni Association executive
board. In addition, Hargadon is
writing a book on admissions for

the Alumni Association's "Porta
ble Stanford" series.
"And, of course, I'll be at Stan
ford for the commencement cer
monies in June," Hargadon
added. This year marks the grad
uation of the last class Hargadon
admitted.
Jean Fetter, current dean of un
dergraduate admissions, said: "It
would have difficult for Princeton
to find a more qualified dean."
