## Seer shakes up locals 
### 
A LOT of terrible things have hap
pened to me this week: I invited
my professor to breakfast and
spilled coffee all over him, I had 12 mid
terms and four papers to work on, and
I lost my keys somewhere on this
ridiculously large campus of ours. Actu
ally only one of the above is true (the
keys have a silver whistle attached and
would love to be back with their owner),
and the rest are the exaggerations of a
slightly tired mind.
Nothing that I've mentioned above,
however, sounds even remotely terrible
when compared to the predictions that
we Californians must come to grips with
this month.
The month of May is supposedly "the"
month. The month for what, you ask?
For the "big" earthquake. While we here
at Stanford are somewhat sheltered from
the hype and hysteria created by the
media in the non-academic world, the
earthquake predicted by the 16th Cen
tury seer Nostradamus is causing panic
and anxiety all over California.
The end of last month saw the anni
versary of San Francisco's devastating
1906 earthquake and the celebration of
Earthquake Awareness Day. On top of
that, think of all the unusual things that
have happened these past few months:
the gorgeous days in January, the
drought-causing weather on the West
Coast, the end of the latest El Nino
episode in the Pacific Ocean, the

windstorm in China and Russia, and
April earthquakes in Nepal, Greece, Peru,
Soviet Central Asia, Alaska and northern
California. All of these forces of nature
seem to indicate the something is brewing
in the kitchens of Mother Nature.
Especially interesting is the fact that
this month is the so-called "once in a
blue moon" month. Meaning that during
this May, we will see two full moons,
one at the month's start and one at its
end. This astronomical event only hap
pens every 10 to 15 years hence our
interest in the phenomena.
While my thoughts are mere specula
tions on the state of things to come,
there are lots of reasons why so many
Californians think that Nevada may soon
have beachfront property.
Perhaps most interesting and most
frightening to people who are not geologic
experts are the rumored predictions of
Nostradamus, the French seer.
Nostradamus, who left behind 924 pre
dictions written in quatrains, wrote:
"A great trembling in the month of
May/ Saturn in Capricorn, Jupiter and
Mercury in Taurus/ Venus also in Cancer,
Mars in Virgo/ Then hail will fall greater
than an egg . . . Volcanic fire from the
center of the earth/ Will cause an earth
quake around the new city/ Two great
rocks will oppose one another for a long
time/ Then the rivers will run red."
Sounds vague and widely applicable,
doesn't it? Nonetheless, hundreds of

people are in hysterics and many are
even moving out of the state because of
it. Maybe people are worried because
Nostradamus' past predictions have sup
posedly been fairty accurate.
The San Francisco Examiner said that
"various quatrains of his have been in
terpreted to retroactively 'predict' the
French Revolution, the rise of Hitler,
atomic bombs, the Berlin Wall and the
assassination of the Kennedys."
In spite of Nostradamus' past suc
cesses, astronomers at the Griffith Ob
servatory dispute any such astronomical
lineups and shifting of the earth's plates.
Also, it's wise to note that Nost
radamus didn't mention anything about
San Francisco or Los Angeles. So why
are we panicked? Maybe it's because Or
son Welles mentions these cities in a
documentary about Nostradamus called
"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow."
Then again, maybe it's because we're
smart to start thinking now about what
we're going to do when the big one comes.
