## Politically extreme groups marginalize minorities 
### 
IT IS sad that Dave Chanoong Kang
must take the flak for vocalizing
what many minorities feel. I agree
ardently with Kang's April 20 letter.
I believe that many minorities are
marginalized by their experiences with
fanatically committed students, who do
not accurately represent their experi
ences. The actual number of people is
not that large who hold these views,
yet because of the extremity of their
opinions, they garner most of the
publicity and attention.
Nicole Ramos, in her May 2 letter, is
only partially correct when she writes
that minority groups are self-afTirming:
These minority groups are self
affirming only to those minorities that
believe as they do.
In calling for unity, Ramos does not
affirm Kang, rather she objects to his

dissension. I too, have been told that
my values must be subsumed for the
good of the many — a situation which
makes people and groups less willing
to hear criticism.
One problem lies in our blithely
assuming that "American" values are
the only ones which are racist and the
only ones which cause strife and dis
sension. I believe Kang's point was
that minorities on a personal basis can
be just as vicious and prejudiced to
each other as to people outside the
group and that perhaps this one aspect
should be re-examined.
It seems to me that Ramos gives the
typical party line: "The most important
goal is unity." In other words, either
you are for us or you are against us. I
have to agree with Kang.

Minority groups should look at their
own behavior within their groups. For
example, if you are moderate you are
considered a sell-out. My own experi
ences have taught me too well these
problems.
To some degree a moderate minority

stance is harder to take because one
feels marginalized from one's own
"supposed" community and from main
stream society.
