# The
						BSU deserves student support
## 
### 
As members of the Stanford commu
nity, we feel angry and ashamed at the
hostility and insensitivity directed
toward the Black Student Union by
many in the University throughout
this year.
Earlier this year, there were chal
lenges to the very existence of the
BSU as an all-black organization.
Throughout the year, there has been a
great deal of unfair criticism of the
BSU's efforts to broaden the Western
Culture requirement. Finally, and most
disturbing because it involved so many
students, are the results of the recent
election.
Thanks to the recent overseas vote,
the BSU juot barely won its fee assess
ment. Rather than expressing concern
at what appears to be a classic case of
white backlash, The Daily followed the

election with an April 18 editorial that
said in effect the BSU was getting
what it deserved for what The Daily
termed "unsubstantiated" charges of
racism.
Is this not disturbing? Isn't it obvi
ous that it was a real slap in the face
of people of color at Stanford for stu
dents to support funding for the Axe
Committee overwhelmingly, yet barely
pass the BSU assesssment and the
SALSA assessment? This election and
the earlier challenges to the BSU's
existence and political presence at
Stanford reflect both an appalling in
sensitivity to the struggles of blacks in
our society and black students at Stan
ford, and a hostility to black political
power that borders on paranoia.
Rather than joining the BSU in their
efforts to nourish a truly multicultural
and multiracial community at Stanford,
many Stanford students have appar
ently decided that people of color on
the campus have gotten "too big for
their britches." As soon as a minority

organization begins to exercise genuine
political power, the mtyority commu
nity feels the need to stifle that power
in order to protect its own cherished
privileges and positions of power.
In addition to serving as a source of
pride, unity and strength for black
students, the BSU's efforts and activi
ties have enriched the entire Universi
ty. The whole University, and probably
universities all over the country, will
benefit from the new Culture, Ideas
and Values program. By providing ex
posure to great works by people of
color and women, the program will
provide students a more global and
thus more accurate perception of them
selves, their history and their educa
tion.
Each year it seems that the BSU
must in some way defend itself or
justify its existence to the rest of the
community. Apparently, it is difficult
for many white students to recognize
the importance of the BSU as an all
black social, cultural and political or-

ganization.
As much as we may all want to live
in a color-blind or color-neutral society,
the fact is that we don't. Blacks in
this country are systematically denied
access to economic power and are stig
matized in many different ways as
inferior by the dominant culture. Rac
ism is so deeply ingrained in our his
tory, culture and institutions that of
ten we do not recognize it at all. Thus,
though most people do not intend to
be racist, our actions (such as voting
against the BSU fee assessment) often
perpetuate a status quo that is racist.
The Stanford Chapter of the Na
tional Lawyers Guild wholeheartedly
supports the BSU. It is our goal to
help make Stanford a place where the
experiences of people of color, women
and gays and lesbians will be cele
brated, not rejected and marginalized.
