## Fiberglass exposure can be dangerous 
### 
We'd like to add several points to
The Daily's article "University tests
show no fiberglass danger" on May 2.
Fiberglass was installed in Mailing
Services and left exposed. In response
to the mail deliverer's protest, manage
ment sealed the fiberglass. The prob
lem is that the outside contractor did
not do a good sealing job.
Instead of making the outside con
tractor fix this, management took air
samples and said the remaining fiber
glass exposure is within safe limits.
We have problems with this.
First, many feel the "safe" limits are
set at levels more for the convenience
of industry than the health of workers.
These limits are frequently revised. In
fact, many feel there is no real "safe"
limit to asbestos or fiberglass.
Theoretically a single fiber of either
could cause cancer, and we have no
way of knowing for each individual
whether its the first fiber or the
thousandth fiber inhaled that initiates
the cancer. The asbestos level in the
Tresidder Bake Shop was "safe" yet
two exposed workers have developed
cancer possibly from the exposure.
Second, when the fiberglass was
installed most of the deliverers
developed symptoms. One got strep
throat. After two months of treatment
he still has strep throat which doctors
feel may not be healing because of the
fiberglass. The supervisor who refuses
to seal the fiberglass properly has
forced the worker to use up his sick
leave and vacation and has disciplined
him for "excessive" use of sick leave.
Third, we ask, why expose anyone
unnecessarily to fiberglass? The fiber
glass in Mailing Services can be sealed
properly for little cost. This letter is a

notice to management that USW
workers are going to pay for the
sealing tape and donate their labor to
correct this problem. If management
won't fix it, we will. It is also a mes
sage to management that the lives and
health of workers are no less precious
than anybody else's.
