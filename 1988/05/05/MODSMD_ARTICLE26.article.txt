# Engineers need choice in curriculum
## 
### 
I ATTENDED the address which
U.S. Secretary of Education
William Bennett delivered April 18.
As a whole I agree with his views
regarding the importance of the study
of Western culture on a collegiate
level, and I share in his condemnation
of the tactics employed to bring about
the recent curriculum changes here at
Stanford.
â€¢ This letter, however, addresses a
comment he made in the question-and
answer portion of the program which I
not only took exception to, but actually
found rather offensive.
The thrust of the question was:
Given that engineering students have
only a limited number of classes which
may be selected from the humanities
and social sciences, is it appropriate for
the school to mandate Western Culture
as requirement rather than allowing
the students to choose for themselves
the paths which they may find more
enlightening?
His response was that the engineer
ing curriculum was at fault and that
the engineering school ought to recon
sider any curriculum which makes it
necessary to curtail a more in-depth,
liberal if you will, study of world
cultures.
The remark which I found offensive
was his comment that Stanford is not
a "trade school", but rather a univer
sity which is noted as a leader among
other universities and a school which
sets standards which other schools
follow.
The implication here is that engi
neering school unaccompanied by a full
complement of Western culture studies,
as well as a study of other cultures, is
in fact not what he believes to be of
sufficient scholarly value to be worthy
of the title of "university" education,

but merely a "trade school" training.
Is it his implication that our studies
allow us to join the skilled labor force,
knowing that our education has not
earned us a position in the social
strata which might include other, more
liberally trained, college graduates?
I truly believe that social studies are
crucial to a well-rounded education,
and no university engineering curricu
lum enforces that better than Stan
ford. However, the sheer magnitude of
information which must be assimilated
by an engineering student prohibits a
more exhaustive study of these issues.
A more in-depth study could come
about only as a result of further com
promising the already strained under
graduate technical core.
The difference between a university
education and a trade school training
is the difference between doing and
understanding. Those of us who have
chosen engineering, the physical
sciences or mathematics as our pri
mary field of study have a quite differ
ent perspective from the one Bennett
most highly prizes.
In my studies, the thrust of my
inquiry has been to investigate our
physical environment. It is just as
important to me to learn how nature
works, how we interact with it and
how to adapt it and ourselves so as
better to suit our wants and needs as
it is to him to study the social implica
tions and human interactions of our
culture throughout our history.
I am by no means minimizing the
importance of studying the nature of
human interaction and its societal
implications. The social sciences and
natural sciences are separate, but each
is no less important than the other,
and a well-rounded education includes
exposure in both of these areas.

The secretary's suggestion that the
engineering education as a whole is at
fault for not teaching a more "liberal"
education fails to take into account the
practical limitations of completing a
degree.
Even after graduating from a good
engineering school, the student is
generally ill prepared to do meaningful
engineering work. A master's degree is
considered by most to be the minimum
requirement. This program typically
takes one to two full-time years of
study.
Bennett's suggestion to require an
engineering undergraduate to study
more completely the social sciences
would not only increase their time
requirements but for most would also
prove financially devastating.
I am upset that the secretary of
education would make a comment
which negates the scholarliness of the
sciences in the absence of an extensive
liberal education.
In an equally absurd vein, one might
easily argue that in the absence of an
extensive study of the physical
sciences, mathematics and the growing
technology which is enveloping our
everyday lives, a person is uneducated
because he does not fully understand
this aspect of our environment.
I believe it is necessary for everyone
to study both social and natural
sciences, but practical limitations
prohibit an in-depth study of both
areas. The issue of choice in one's
exposure to a field which is not his
main area of study, as in the Western
Culture debate, is not a moot point
and should not have been brushed
aside as not having validity to the
debate at hand.
