## Undergrad research: more than mouse-play 
### Eric Ly Staff writer 
Research. The word coi\jures up
an image of white-coated scien
tists meticulously looking through
microscopes for days to under
stand the life of some microor
ganism.
This image is no longer accu
rate, especially in universities
where computers have replaced
slide rules and polyester pants
have been supplanted by blue
jeans.

And thanks to the Undergrad
uate Research Opportunities pro
gram, the days when research op
portunities for undergraduates
were limited to handling mice in
the lab are also gone.
Since its beginning here in
1974, URO has aided students in
terested in conducting their own
research projects. The program
provides guidance for students to
launch their projects and, in the
last three years, has helped
finance them.
Last Friday the program
awarded 25 new Major Grants,
which provide $2,500 for re
search, to students studying such
topics as the "Modernization and
the Lives of Young Zuni Women,"
the "Symmetries of Surfaces" and
the "Resource Allocation Patterns
in Female Speyeria Mormonia."
Modeled after a similar pro

gram at the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, the URO
awards grants in three categories
to undergraduates who have de
signed their own proejcts. Mayor
Grants are given to students in
the natural sciences, while Golden
Grants, also $2,500, are awarded
to undergraduates for projects in
the humanities and creative arts.
The program also provides other
small grants to students, from
$250 to $500.
The grants cover a student's
research expenses, like reimburs
ing human subjects and paying
for lab materials. This alleviates
the financial burden of doing re
search that most undergraduates
would otherwise find prohibitive.
"We want students to concen
trate on research and not be in
hibited by financial problems,"
URO Director Laura Selznick
said. She said undergraduates
should make a priority of doing
some research or completing an
honors thesis as an undergradu
ate.
"I think undergraduates here
are sometimes under-challenged.
That's why so many students
decide to double-rmyor. They say,
'I'm going to finish my classes for
this msyor by my junior year.
What am I going to do for my
fourth year?' Instead of learning
facts, why not develop other ways
of learning? I want to challenge
students on this idea," Selznick
said.
Funding for URO has been a
problem ever since URO began in
1974. At first, the program only
assisted students in matching
their research interests with fac
ulty members in the same area,
but did not provide any research
funding. The Firestone family
donated enough money to provide
25 $2,500 grants in 1985, but the
fund quickly went dry.
Fortunately, the research pro
gram has received other donations
in the last three years. This fall,
the Lane family made a $1 million

donation to the program, enabling
it to award an additional 12 re
search grants. Another do
nation included a $1 million gift
from alumnus Robert Golden,
who wanted his donation to be
targeted for students in the hu
manities.
The program has an annual
budget of approximately $100,000
which is divided to help approxi
mately 100 students each year.
Seiznick said undergraduate re
search funding is a major objec

tive for Stanford's Centennial
Campaign, which seeks to provide
a $15 million endowment for the
program.
Although Stanford was the na
tion's most funded research uni
versity last year, none of that
money trickled to the undergrad
uate program, Seiznick said.
Besides offering research
grants, URO also maintains three
on-line databases accessible to
students through Folio computer
accounts. These files provide in

formation about currently avai
able internships and research po
sitions, academic interests of
Stanford faculty and graduate fel
lowships and awards.
National recognition
The Stanford program is one of
several undergraduate research
programs currently being offered
in the country. "It represents a
new trend in making independent
research for undergraduates pos

sible," Seiznick said.
The Stanford program is
unique, however, in that it not
only provides funding to students
in the natural sciences, but also
in the social sciences and human
ities. "The programs at the other
universities are funded primarily
by big corporations interested in
the results of that research, as
opposed to private contributions
which we get," Seiznick said.

Information about currently available internships and research potentials.
