## Undergrad research: more than mouse-play 
### Eric Ly Staff writer 
Research. The word coi\jures up
an image of white-coated scien
tists meticulously looking through
microscopes for days to under
stand the life of some microor
ganism.
This image is no longer accu
rate, especially in universities
where computers have replaced
slide rules and polyester pants
have been supplanted by blue
jeans.

And thanks to the Undergrad
uate Research Opportunities pro
gram, the days when research op
portunities for undergraduates
were limited to handling mice in
the lab are also gone.
Since its beginning here in
1974, URO has aided students in
terested in conducting their own
research projects. The program
provides guidance for students to
launch their projects and, in the
last three years, has helped
finance them.
Last Friday the program
awarded 25 new Major Grants,
which provide $2,500 for re
search, to students studying such
topics as the "Modernization and
the Lives of Young Zuni Women,"
the "Symmetries of Surfaces" and
the "Resource Allocation Patterns
in Female Speyeria Mormonia."
Modeled after a similar pro

gram at the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, the URO
awards grants in three categories
to undergraduates who have de
signed their own proejcts. Mayor
Grants are given to students in
the natural sciences, while Golden
Grants, also $2,500, are awarded
to undergraduates for projects in
the humanities and creative arts.
The program also provides other
small grants to students, from
$250 to $500.
The grants cover a student's
research expenses, like reimburs
ing human subjects and paying
for lab materials. This alleviates
the financial burden of doing re
search that most undergraduates
would otherwise find prohibitive.
"We want students to concen
trate on research and not be in
hibited by financial problems,"
URO Director Laura Selznick
said. She said undergraduates
should make a priority of doing
some research or completing an
honors thesis as an undergradu
ate.
"I think undergraduates here
are sometimes under-challenged.
That's why so many students
decide to double-rmyor. They say,
'I'm going to finish my classes for
this msyor by my junior year.
What am I going to do for my
fourth year?' Instead of learning
facts, why not develop other ways
of learning? I want to challenge
students on this idea," Selznick
said.
Funding for URO has been a
problem ever since URO began in
1974. At first, the program only
assisted students in matching
their research interests with fac
ulty members in the same area,
but did not provide any research
funding. The Firestone family
donated enough money to provide
25 $2,500 grants in 1985, but the
fund quickly went dry.
Fortunately, the research pro
gram has received other donations
in the last three years. This fall,
the Lane family made a $1 million

donation to the program, enabling
it to award an additional 12 re
search grants. Another do
nation included a $1 million gift
from alumnus Robert Golden,
who wanted his donation to be
targeted for students in the hu
manities.
The program has an annual
budget of approximately $100,000
which is divided to help approxi
mately 100 students each year.
Seiznick said undergraduate re
search funding is a major objec

tive for Stanford's Centennial
Campaign, which seeks to provide
a $15 million endowment for the
program.
Although Stanford was the na
tion's most funded research uni
versity last year, none of that
money trickled to the undergrad
uate program, Seiznick said.
Besides offering research
grants, URO also maintains three
on-line databases accessible to
students through Folio computer
accounts. These files provide in

formation about currently avai
able internships and research po
sitions, academic interests of
Stanford faculty and graduate fel
lowships and awards.
National recognition
The Stanford program is one of
several undergraduate research
programs currently being offered
in the country. "It represents a
new trend in making independent
research for undergraduates pos

sible," Seiznick said.
The Stanford program is
unique, however, in that it not
only provides funding to students
in the natural sciences, but also
in the social sciences and human
ities. "The programs at the other
universities are funded primarily
by big corporations interested in
the results of that research, as
opposed to private contributions
which we get," Seiznick said.

URO Director Laura Seiznick points out that the URO's Folio computer accounts access students to three online databases providing
Information about currently available internships and research potentials.
She said URO is one of the
most developed programs of its
kind in the nation.
The research made possible by
the URO grants has not gone un
noticed. This year, the two Rhodes
scholars and three Marshall
scholars at Stanford all previously
had received grants from URO.
"People from the outside are
definitely noticing" the research
being done through the URO pro
gram, Selznick said.
Though the proposed topics
may seem obscure to most stu
dents, the research can certainly
contribute significantly to the par
ticular area of study, Selznick
said. For example, Frank Lyles,
a senior in biology, used an URO
grant he received last year to
study ways of making capsules
which only release medicine to
certain cells in the body.
Lyles' research may eventually
yield applications in which
medicines, poisonous to some
cells, can travel harmlessly
through the body, targeting only
harmful tissue, such as AlDS
infected cells. The research may
also prove useful for improving
the safety of certain kinds of im
munization, Lyles said.
Selznick said the URO students
have been able to become experts
in their own area of research. In
addition, "students learn valuable
analytical skills which are more
important than learning which
battle came before which in some
class," she said.
Beyond the classroom
Selznick said that many grant
proposals result from a student's
desire to study a particular topic
in greater depth, a topic only men
tioned briefly in the classroom.
Laura Stepp, a junior majoring
in psychology and feminist stu
dents, wanted to study the psy
chology of how "women relate to
women differently than they

'Instead of learning facts, why not
develop new ways of learning? I want to
challenge students on this idea We
want students to concentrate on re
search and not be inhibited by financial
problems.'

relate to men," a topic of only
marginal research popularity in
the past.
Stepp said she was surprised
that "there was so little [research]
done on lesbian relationships and
the non-verbal interaction be
tween women." It was this dearth,
exposed during a brief discussion
in a Feminist Studies course, that
sparked her curiosity.
With the guidance of an aca
demic instructor, Stepp developed
an independent project which
received a $2,500 grant from
URO. She will begin her research
this summer.
Jose Navarro, a senior in
physics, received a grant last
spring to pay for the expense in
curred from his research into
atomic particles. Navarro aims to
determine accurately the electri
cal charge, if any, of a neutron.
Scientists currently believe the
neutron has no charge.
Not only did the grant allow
him to study something entirely
new and interesting, Navarro said
that he learned much about the
research process itself.
"Things don't always work as
well as you expect, and there are
too many details which you have
to pay attention to all the time,"
Navarro said.
In fact, Navarro has not had a
chance to take any measurements
of neutrons yet and he is still in
the process of making minute
glass beads that will contain the
suitable number of atoms for mea
surement.
Navarro has made definite
progress, however. He has

succeeded in designing an
electronic device that detects the
spinning of minute particles in
absolute-zero temperatures. Al
though Navarro constructed the
device for his own experiments,
scientists will be able to use it in
other types of experiments as
well.
The device is also the topic of
a research paper authored by
Navarro and his faculty sponsors.
"I do a little of everything, even
those things not related to my
thesis," he said.
If Navarro does find a charge
associated with a neutron,
physicists may have to rethink
their ideas about atomic particles.
For Lyles, life has become
"smoother" after doing research.
"I didn't care about whether I
made the grade in a class.
(Classes) just became interesting
and easier," Lyles said.
"In the classroom, you learn the
basic things, but in a research
environment you get to learn the
details they never show you in a
textbook," Lyles said.
Lyles was hesitant about major
ing in biology for financial
reasons, but doing research
helped him decide to in bi
ology instead of engineering.
"When I was a kid, I wanted to
go into medical research, but
everybody told me how much debt
I would be in," Lyles said.
The $2,500 grant Lyles received
enabled him to conduct research
in an area which interested him.
