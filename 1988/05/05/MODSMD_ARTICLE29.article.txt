# Dancing for donations

### Maryellen Driscoll 
Over 200 Stanford students
are expected to dance the night
away in an effort to help the
homeless of Menlo Park Friday.
In a campus wide dance mar
athon, hosted by the Stanford
Christian Legal Society, partic
ipants will dance for five hours
to raise money for the Menlo
Park Family Center, which spe
cializes in the care of homeless
families and runaway children.
Dancers are currently seeking
sponsors who will pledge money
on the basis of how many hours
the participants dance.
Stressing that it is not too
late to participate and that all
students should put on their
dancing shoes, dance organizer
John Platz said, "We want to
emphasize that this is an all
campus event."
According to Steve Odell, who
is also helping plan the event,

the marathon is "a way of di
rectly helping to alleviate at
least some of the suffering of
the area's homeless population
and help raise the consciousness
among the Stanford communi
ty,"

A Stanford student since
1979, Odell said the marathon
is a "unique" event that he
thought had never been tried at
Stanford during his time here.
Tunes will range from '40s
music to songs from the '80s,
with jumps between decades oc
curing each hour.
To kick off the evening, U.S.
Sen. Mark Hatfield will speak
on how homelessness has be
come a national crisis and what
individuals can do to fight the
problem.
Often referred to as the "con
science of the Senate," Hatfield,
R-Ore., has gained notoriety for
his opposition to U.S. interven
tion in Southeast Asia and Cen
tral America and for his concern
on how to overcome the home
lessness problem.
The marathon will follow
Hatfield's address, with dancers
sweeping the floor from 8 p.m.
to 1 a.m.



Sen. Mark Hatfield
