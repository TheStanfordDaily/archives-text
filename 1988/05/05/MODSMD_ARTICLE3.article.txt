# Palm Drive to get new landscaping and road repair
## 
### Tim Hullar 
Landscaping improvements are under
way and road repairs are on the way for
Palm Drive, the formal gateway to the
Stanford campus.
The University plans to landscape both
ends of Palm Drive, replace palms miss
ing from the side of the road, and repair
the road surface itself, according to John
Lerry, a University facilities engineer.
Plans for the improvements must still
gain the formal approval of University
President Donald Kennedy and the Com
mittee on Land and Building Develop
ment before road work can begin in ear
nest, Lerry said. The final approval is
expected to come over the summer.
The deteriorated, crumbling condition

of Palm Drive has been a continuing
problem for Stanford. Lerry noted that
the edges of roadway are severely eroded
from water seeping under the edges of
the pavement.
Stanford has been under pressure from
its insurance agent to fix Palm Drive,
Lerry said, citing the danger of lawsuits
from bicyclists who might crash because
of the condition of the pavement.
Lerry said the Palm Drive landscaping
will be primarily "restoration and en
hancement" rather than radical change
of the roadway's character. He said the
work will cost between $350,000 and
$400,000. Most of the money will be
donated privately to the University.

rent condition of Palm Drive as "pretty
grim." He pointed out that the roadway
is missing several of its namesake trees
from the rows flanking it.
The University will replace 13 of the
missing palms at a cost of $2,500 to
$3,000 each, Lerry said.
Landscaping the entrance to Palm
Drive from El Camino Real has already
begun and some trees have been removed.
One landscaping request from a Uni

versity official was quick to be accommo
dated. "President Kennedy specifically re
quested that the walls be visible from
both sides to accentuate the border of
the University," he said.
Since then, the walls flanking the en
trance arches have been cleared of
obscuring shrubbery, Lerry said.
Lerry said that new vegetation will
replace the native California poppies that

have thrived in the area in years past.
Better drainage will be added to the
edges of the drive, preventing further
deterioration of the road surface, Lerry
said. He added that Palm Drive itself will
remain two lanes wide in each direction,
while the bicycle path will be broadened
from eight to 12 feet to accommodate
mixed bicycle and pedestrian traffic.
Changes at the end of Palm Drive
nearest the Oval will include planting of
a stand of trees and conversion of
Memorial Way — which angles from
Palm Drive toward the Old Chemistry
building — into a pedestrian walkway
edged with picnic tables. The University
will work to preserve the population of
California quail that live near the Oval,
Lerry said.
