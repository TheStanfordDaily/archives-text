"And the Band Played On:
Politics, People, and the AIDS
Epidemic"
By Randy Shilts
Reviewed by Steve Sassaman
Randy Shilts sets an enormous
task for himself in this book: to
faithfully and accurately chronicle
the sprawling complexity of the
AIDS epidemic.
The book covers a time span

that begins with the Fourth of
July celebrations in 1976 and ends
on May 31, 1987, when President
Reagan made his first public
statement about the epidemic
which had been killing Americans
since the early 1980s. This is an
ambitious undertaking, and Shilts
deserves praise for his attempt to
provide the public with a record
of who did what, when and where
about the crisis and how the di
verse events all fit together.

However, although the book is
styled and advertised as this sort
of historical record, it is unfor
tunately more of a tragic, histor
ical novel than a genuine work of
historical scholarship. In short, it
contains ommissions and distor
tions which not only imperil the
reader's understanding of AIDS,
but risk perpetuating the stereo
typing and hysteria which have
characterized the crisis.
The "plot," as Shilts presents
it, is simple: AIDS came from
Africa and, because of the foolish
and hedonistic lifestyle of
America's gay communities,
spread rapidly. While there were
many heroes who fought a des
perate struggle against the dis
ease, they were largely thwarted
by devious and selfish bureau
crats, bathhouse owners,
politicians and a blind media.
Now, granted, that is a gross
over-simplification of Shilts' book,
but so is his portrayal of the his
tory of AIDS a gross over
simplification. He boils everything
and everyone down to easy good
vs. bad formula, rarely refraining
from showing the reader which
side he believes to be correct. In
dicative of this approach, I found
that after finishing the book and
looking through the glossary of
biographical names provided in
the front of the book, I was able
to characterize almost everyone
of them as a "good guy" or a "bad
guy."
A fine example of thi3 style —
and its faults — is Shilts' treat
ment of Gaetan Dugas, the so
called "Patient Zero." Dugas was
a flight attendant who traveled
extensively throughout North
America, Europe and Africa. A
high percentage of the first
diagnosed cases of AIDS in this
country appeared in former sexual
partners of Dugas; hence the the
ory that he may have acquired
the virus while in Africa and
spread it through the gay com
munities in the United States by
his promiscuity. These are facts.
But Shilts goes far beyond the
facts. He describes Gaetan's
megalomaniac tendencies, his
narcissistic sexual exploits and his
prowlings in the gay bars and
bathhouses. Once Dugas is in

formed that he may have the
virus, Shilts has him launch into
a sex-spree, describing how he
would go to a bathhouse, pick up
some man, have sex with him,
and then say: "I've got gay cancer,
and now you do too."
Dugas comes across as sub
human, a monster who seeks to
kill others because he himself
must die. But where Shilts ob
tained his insights into the ac
tions, motives, and thoughts of
Dugas is a mystery. Dugas' name
is not on the list of people whom
Shilts interviewed for the book;
yet the kind of detail that Shilts
describes could only be the prod
uct of a very open and personal
interview with Dugas himself.
This carelessness — fabrica
tion? — is just one example of
Shilts' needless, almost fictitous
dramatization.
In his dramatic presentation,
Shilts focuses on five institutional
villains: the government, the
blood bank industry, the media,
the medical profession, and large
segments of the gay community.
And, indeed, such villification
makes for fascinating reading. It
is interesting to read about the
interagency competition which so
hampered early research, the in
difference on the part of many
officials who looked the other way
because it was gay men who were
dying, doctors who put careerist
self-interest ahead of saving lives,
and hosts of other blameworthy
persons and institutions.
Likewise, it was heartening to
read about the many heroes in
these groups who went out on a
limb when AIDS was still an un
certain issue.
But it is Shilts, not the reader,
who decides who is a villain and
who is a hero. If he were writing
true journalism, he would provide
facts and the allow his readers to
draw their own conclusions. In
stead he presents people and their
actions from his hightly personal
and political perspective.
In one particular case, espe
cially, I think that he goes too far
and indeed does more damage
than good: in his characterization
of the response of the gay com
munity to the outbreak and

spread of AIDS. As a gay man, I
was antf offended by
Shiits, another gay man, whose
basic message is that gays caused
the epidemic and, in some strange
sense, deserve the consequences.
In this vein, Shiits devotes
much attention to the early 1980s

issue of whether or not to close
the gay bath-houses, which he ap
parently sees as a microcosm of
the entire AIDS campaign. (He
favors their closing, and he views
those who disagree with him as
not only mistaken but evil.) In
his portrayal of this debate, Shilts
does the gay community a serious
injustice by completely disregard
ing the atmosphere of fear, un
certainty and defensiveness which
pervaded the time.

By labeling people who acted
short-sightedly because they
lacked our clearer hindsight as
villains, and by portraying their
actions as selfishly facilitating the
spread of AIDS, Shilts presents a
damaging picture of the gay com
munity which supports his very
biased views. This is not to say
that the gay community acted as
a paragon of rationality through
out the crisis, but Shilts has an

almost ruthless lack of compas
sion. It is not necessary to con
demn people for being frightened,
as the book seems to do.
One other serious flaw is Shilts'
failure to mention the impact of
the "safe sex" movement, which
began in 1981. By leaving "safe
sex" out of his history, he in
sinuates that the radical scare
tactics which he supports — the
puritanical promotion of

abstinence, etc. — were the agents
which stemmed the spread of
AIDS.
In so doing, Shilts misleads his
readers by not providing all of the
information. I can assure Shilts
that gay men did not just stop
having sex; we did, however, ed
ucate ourselves about the practice
of safer sex and then implement
it. It is to such behavioral modi
fication that most people would

credit the progress that has been
made in halting the spread of
AIDS.
Indeed, Shilts' ommission of
"safe sex" is perhaps his most
serious flaw, especially when com
bined with an unfoundedly nega
tive portrayal of the gay commu
nity, which can do little more than
reinforce dangerous stereotypes.
I do not mean to ascribe devious
motives to Shilts; I am sure that

his motives were good and that
he wrote what he saw as the his
tory of AIDS. But in fact, it is a
dramatized and selective history,
one which might better have been
subtitled "One Man's View of the
AIDS Epidemic."
