# Gay activist attacks book

### Don Gagliardi 
San Francisco attorney Mary
Dunlap, who teaches a course
on sexual orientation and the
law at Stanford Law School,
also strongly disagrees with
aspects of Randy Shilts' best
selling book, "And The Band
Played On," which traces the
early development of the AIDS
epidemic.
Dunlap was significantly in
volved, as a lesbian civil rights
attorney and a board member
of the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation, in the policy
debates over the closing of the
city's gay bathhouses in the
early 1980s. At that time, she
argued vigorously, but unsuc
cessfully, to keep the bath
houses open. "The bathhouses
were one of the few and most
effective means of dissemina
ting AIDS education and safe
sex materials in those days,"
she says, and their closure also
infringed on the civil liberties
of the baths' gay patrons.
Shilts, on the other hand,
contends in his book that while
the San Francisco gay commu
nity dragged its feet over the
closing of the baths, AIDS
spread rapidly among its mem
bers. Some of the ensuing
deaths might have been
prevented by earlier action, he
argues.
Dunlap discounts Shilts' per
spective on the spread of AIDS,
which posits in part that
thousands of AIDS victims
were infected by a French
Canadian flight attendant
named Gaetan Dugas. "Shilts'
epidemiology model is a sen
sationalists, People magazine

view," she charges. It "creates
a caricature," a sort of modern
day Typhoid Mary, as a
scapegoat.
Dunlap notes that there are
substantial questions that
remain unanswered about the
spread of AIDS and about the
forms of behavior that are most
amenable to its transmission.
Simplistic and sensationalistic
accounts of the disease "feed
the popular hysteria over
AIDS," Dunlap says, which in
turn creates an environment
in which the rights of privacy
and other civil liberties are
placed in jeopardy. She cites
the military's mandatory AIDS
testing of new recruits and in
itiatives to quarantine AIDS
victims as examples.

Mary Dunlap will speak on
"Gay and Lesbian Awareness
and Coalition-building" at 1
p.m. today in Room 95 of the
Law School.
