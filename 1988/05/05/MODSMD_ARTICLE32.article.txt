Not only is there much to be
learned scientifically about the
nature of AIDS — and a cure still
seems remote — but the law sur
rounding AIDS is in disarray. Of
course there is no "law of AIDS,"
per se. Rather, the recent
epidemic has posed a wide range
of novel legal problems in the con
text of everyday societal institu
tions.
May employees be fired for
having AIDS? May schoolchildren
afflicted with the disease be kept
out of public schools? What are
the obligations of insurance com
panies to AIDS victims and per
sons at high risk for contracting
the disease? And under what cir
cumstances is mandatory testing
for AIDS permissable? These are
a few of the legal questions that
society is only beginning to con
front in grappling with the per
vasive AIDS epidemic, and which
the Yale AIDS Law Project ex
amines in "AIDS and the Law."
This useful work contains a se
ries of separately authored, schol
arly essays, unpublished else
where, on various AIDS-related
legal issues. Essentially these es
says are written as stylized legal
memoranda. They're practical
working papers, with sober but
elegant prose. Since the book
seeks out a broad-based audience,
including non-lawyers, the au
thors provide many basic expla
nations of legal rules and opera

tions. But the book is in no way
patronizing, even to attorneys.
For the most part, the contri
buting authors are legal scholars
boasting impressive credentials in
their respective specialties.
Rhonda Rivera, for example, who
wrote the chapter on AIDS and
the military, has been widely pub
lished on gay-related legal mat
ters. And the chapter on housing
issues was authored by Daniel
Mandelker, an expert on munici
pal housing and zoning or
dinances.
Because there are not yet
definitive answers to most of the
questions addressed in "AIDS and
the Law," its essays largely cata
log and discuss general legal au
thority which indirectly relates to
these issues. Federal and state
handicap discrimination laws
present a prime example. Is AIDS
a "handicap" for purposes of these
laws? The Supreme Court has yet
to interpret the federal enact
ment. And state laws, also mostly

uninterpreted by the courts so far,
will likely vary in their answers.
Even where AIDS-related is
sues have actually been litigated,
the results aren't necessarily
broadly applicable. For instance,
only three cases concerning
schoolchildren with AIDS have
been decided (all in favor of al
lowing the child to remain in
school), but no state supreme
court has yet approved such a
result. Thus the law remains in
flux almost everywhere.
This book is nonetheless in
formative and useful because it
provides a baseline understanding
of the various legal problems and
because it therefore enables one
to hazard an intelligent guess as
to what the law of AIDS might
(and should, in the view of com
passionate observers) be. At this
stage, that's all that can be asked
for.
