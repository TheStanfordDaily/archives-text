Heroes don't normally write
how-to books. Lon Nungesser
has, and the result is extraordi
nary.
Nungesser's heroism comes
from his ability to find profound
joy in life upon learning that he
must die young. His latest book
is both a practical manual for
survival and coping, and an en
lightening story of one man's
dedication to life.
In 1983, Nungesser, a 30-
year-old Stanford alumnus, was
diagnosed as having AIDS and
told that he had only a few
months to live. Not only has he
survived, but now he has writ
ten an outstanding, funny, and
pragmatic book of advise to
others who have, or who know
someone who has, an incurable
ailment.
Nungesser draws from his
personal experience, but what
he says is highly generalizable.
He talks, for example, about his
own first experience of telling
someone that he has a tragic
disease, and then he immedi
ately distills for the reader the
practical points which he took
from the process, like specific
questions people with an in
curable disease should consider
when deciding whom should be
the first person they confide in.
The central message of Nun
gesser's book is to remain hope

ful. "Hope in the face of death
is not denial," he writes. Getting
oneself into a mindset which
enables one to seize control of
day-to-day living has also helped
Nungesser.
Nungesser rejects a great deal
of formal medical practice be
case he has found that it inter
feres with achieving this sense
of control. In this vein, he avoids
dispair by concentrating on the
things which he can do rather
than on the things which he
can not.
Throughout the book, Nun
gesser stresses the importance
of the seemingly impossible —
taking the diagnosis in stride.
"A diagnosis is an event to be
adapted to, not a death sentence
to be compliant with." Indeed,
Nungesser's advice, his hope,
and his example make the
reader feel as though what Nun
gesser has done, others can do
as well.
In the end, Nungesser claims
that his attitude is what has
allowed him to persevere.
It should be emphasized that
this book is not an "AIDS book."
Nungesser does not write in
some cryptic, disease-specific
language. Rather, he writes in
a truly universal language of
hope, of bravery and compas
sion.
And since it is written in such
a universal language, we can all
learn from it, even — perhaps
especially — those of us in good
health. Nungesser's story is
moving, his guidence specific,
and his attitude uplifting.
