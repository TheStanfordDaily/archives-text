## Yesterday's news

Why oh why in 1988 must
sportswriting be so dry?
The New York Times, May
3, 1938 — Colonel Bill Terry's
swashbuckling Giants were
winging westward last night
toward Cincinnati on the mo
mentum of an eleven game win
ning streak, thanks to the still
futile, though ever furious, bat
tling of Burleigh Grimes'
Dodgers, who emerged on the
short end of a 7-4 count in the
series finale at the Polo
Grounds yesterday.

Today the story would
divulge who hit the big homer,
who got the win, and who got
the save. Yawn. We can find
those facts out a few hours
after the game on the 11 p.m.
sportscast, where we see a six
second home run highlight.
But what happened in the
game, at the ballpark? Was the
Giant win a boring but efficient
effort, or did the Dodgers battle
furiously? It seems that in
1938 the writers were more
concerned with the single game
at hand than with stats and
standings. Good for them.
CINCINNATI, May 4, 1938
— After having deftly polished
off the best the East had to
offer, the Giants made an ex
cellent clearance of the Alleg
henies today, effected a neat
three-point landing and imme
diately set out for fresh worlds
to conquer.
But in almost record time
they crashed into difficulties.
The weather was unseasonably
and unsufferably hot, the Reds
were even hotter and the result
of it all was that a brilliant
winning streak of eleven
straight melted and parted
with a snap, while the Giants
went sprawling under a 10-2
defeat.
John Drebinger, the writer
of the above lead, seems

eminently qualified to step in
as a war correspondent a few
years down the road. Indeed,
the game is one clash during
the summer campaign, the
quest for the pennant.
Why not portray it as such?
Drebinger is writing for the
New York fans, who want to
see how their warriors did yes
terday. Completely unbiased
sports reporting can be com
pletely boring.
CINCINNATI, May 5, 1938
— Inspired by the abounding
patience of Carl Owens Hub
bell, the Giants virtually
started two runs behind scratch
today, but finally succeeded in
overhauling the stout-hearted,
though hard-headed, Reds to
down Ray (Peaches) Davis, 3-2.
Hey, who is Hubbell, and
what position does he play?
C'mon everyone knows he's the
star pitcher, you lousy bum.
You're no Giants fan.
Okay, but what did he throw,
a five-hitter or something?
Look in the damn boxscore for
that stuff. Man, he was gutsy
out there on the hill. He won
the damn game, buddy — if
you need to know how many
hits he gave up, you're no
Giants fan.
The Giants were down 2-0,
and two straight Giants run
ners were thrown out at the
plate. Drebinger writes: Except
for the fact that Terry has a
very thick crop of hair, it is
quite likely he would have
pulled enough out after this to
leave himself practically bald.
Anyway, we were still two down
as the sixth dawned . . .
Well, if you're not hard
headed you can probably figure
out that Terry is the Giants'
manager (Bill), and that Hub
bell must have had "abounding
patience" to persevere through
two baserunning muffs. But
the most important thing is
that "we" were still two runs
behind. Today, Drebinger's
partisanship would be termed
unprofessional by people who
probably couldn't write worth
a lick.
Of course, all of the above
could just be sentimental hog
wash.
