# Fantastic finish for golfers: 4th
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
Every so often,
something hap
pens in the world
of sport that is so
unexpected, it
defies explanation.
Some call it poetic

justice, others call it a quirk of
fate. Stanford's fourth-place
finish in the Pacific 10 Conference
Championship yesterday is one of
those events.
The Cardinal golfers, trailing
Oregon by one shot at the start
of the third round, vaulted over
the Ducks to finish fourth by one
shot. It wasn't pretty, but the
young team did what had to be
done.
Stanford shot 381 as a team in
the final round, one shot better
than its performance Tuesday, to
give it a total of 1,153 shots for
54 holes. Washington, which led
the tourney from wire-to-wire,
shot 369 Wednesday to hold on
and win the tournament with an
1,104. Arizona, trailing by eight
shots at the start of the third
round, came up short with 367
(1,110), despite the valiant efforts
of Wildcat senior Mike Springer,
who tore up the Orinda Country
Club course with a four-under-par
68.
Stanford beat both USC and
UCLA, which were ranked 10th
and 13th in the country, respec
tively. That seemed to gratify the
Cardinal players just as much as
their fine fourth-place finish.
"That's it, we beat USC and
UCLA! When we go into this sum
mer and people ask me how we
did, that's what I'm going to tell
them," a joyful Brad Joondeph
exclaimed.
Joondeph, a sophomore, led the
Cardinal this week with a three
round total of 228, good enough
to tie him for 12th place among
all players. Sophomore Josh
Zander had a great final round,
carding a 73, for a total of 232.
Sophomore Don Christensen dis
played his usual final-round
heroics, shooting 74 on the final
18, and 235 for the tourney. Soph
omore Mark Funseth continued
his solid performance, firing 76
Wednesday and 229 for the week.
Sophomore Brad Benbrook and
junior John Mahon rounded out
the Stanford scoring at 236 and

239, respectively.
Washington's O.D. Vincent,
who won the Western Intercol
legiate Tournament earlier this
season, won the tournament with
a final round 71 and 214 total for
the week. Three players tied for
second at 216, Arizona's Springer
and Washington players Todd
Tibke and Scott Whaley. Placing
three players in the top four no
doubt gave Washington a needed
boost over Arizona. "That's how
you win golf tournaments," Cali
fornia Coach Steve Desimone
commented at the awards cere
mony.
The course, which had played
much tougher than its 6,400-yard
length would indicate, was set up
even more stringently for the final
round. Most pins were tucked in
the least accessible corner of each
green. "They may as well have
put rough where the middle of
the green should be," UCLA's
Kevin Leach said, shaking his
head in bewilderment.
The key to Stanford's low
scores today was its agressive
play. After a birdie on the par-5
fourth hole, Zander put his second
shot on the par-4 fifth hole within
eight inches of the flag, even
though his tee shot had been in
less than ideal position. Funseth
also displayed a Seve Ballesteros
like demeanor on the course,
swinging hard and going for every
flag.
After the round, Joondeph said
that conservative play would have
hurt the golfers at Orinda. On
the 347-yard, par-four 17th, Joon
deph said "the hole would have
been a lot tougher if I had hit a
three-iron and had a 150-yard ap
proach shot than if I used a driver
and had a 100-yard wedge."
As it turned out, Joondeph did
use a driver off the tee at 17 and
hit a perfect wedge to within one
foot of the hole for an easy birdie.
As their long season came to
an end, the Cardinal players
exuded hope for next year, as they
have every right to. After their
strong finish in 1988, the young
team has one more year of exper
ience under its belt and the sat
isfaction of knowing that it beat
nationally-ranked teams when the
pressure was on. Christensen
summed it up best when he said,
"We'll probably be ranked ninth
in (District 8) after this week, and
that's a great start for next year."
