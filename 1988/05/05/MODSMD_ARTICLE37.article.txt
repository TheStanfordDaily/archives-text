# Tami and Teri: partners for life
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Team tennis is in many ways
a contradiction in terms. People
who play one of the most individ
ual of all individual sports are
expected to come toget her to form
a group. Needless to say, cohesion
can be difficult to achieve, and
camaraderie often has a contrived
look to it.
Such haa not been the case for
two members of this year's Stan
ford women's tennis team. They
have been an inseparable team
since they were born five minutes
apart on Nov. 13, 1968.

Tami and Teri Whitlinger are,
by all accounts, partners for life.
John Whitlinger, their uncle and
assistant coach of the men's ten
nis team, calls them "best
friends." Yet, their relationship is
more than just a friendship. On
an emotional level, they seem to
experience life together.
"1 feel like everything that hap
pens to Tami happens to me,"
Teri says.
The closeness of the Whitlinger
twins is most apparent at Stan
ford tennis matches. When one is
not playing, she will become
engrossed in the other's match,
watching each point nervously,

cringing with each mis-hit, and
offering encouragement in be
tween points. "If she loses, I feel
like I've lost," says Tami.
Even when they are on the
court at the same time in a dual
match, the Whitlingers continue
to keep tabs on each other. "I
know it's important for me to
hear her voice, and she's told me
she wants to hear mine," Tami
says.
Yet, both admit that at times
they have become so worried
about the other's match that their
own game has suffered. "Some
times I have the hardest time with
that," says Teri. "I'll find myself
getting all wrapped up in her
match. Most of the time I'm more
concerned with her winning. It's
hard. It's really hard, because I
get so nervous watching her."
Any lack of concentration that
has resulted has not been
reflected in the Whitlingers'
records. Their first season at
Stanford has been extremely suc
cessful to date. Tami, the team's
No. 1 singles player, has beaten
several of the top collegiate
players this year. She has a 38-6
overall record and a No. 3 national
ranking. Teri had a 20-match win
ning streak at one point in the
season and is currently 38-5 and
ranked 17th.
The Whitlingers hail from
Neenah, Wis., halfway across the
country, but they were destined
to attend Stanford since they were
five years of age. Uncle John
played on the Stanford men's
team from 1973 to 1975, and
Tami and Teri became the Car
dinal's youngest fans during that
period. "We were like the little
mascots," Teri laughs.
Between 1975 and 1987, the
Whitlingers honed their tennis
skills to a level that made them
prime candidates for a tennis
powerhouse like Stanford. Tami's
credentials included 1985 national
indoor singles champion, 1986 na
tional outdoor champion, four
time Wisconsin high school state
titlist and 1987 Junior Wightman
Cup Team member.
Among Teri's accomplishments
on the junior circuit were the
1985 16-and-under singles na
tional championship. She, too,
was a Junior Wightman Cup
Team member last summer.
When considering which college
to attend, the Whitlingers had

little considering to do. All factors
pointed to Stanford: the school's
renowned tennis program, their
previous connection with Stan
ford and the fact that John was
living in the area and working as
an assistant to Dick Gould, the
men's tennis coach.
"I knew if we were accepted, it
would definitely be Stanford,"
Teri says. "Coming to Stanford
has been a dream of ours since
John was here."
As "best friends," the Whitlin
gers never gave much thought to
attending different schools. "Our
parents mentioned just briefly the
idea, but neither of us took it
seriously," says Tami. "We had
decided in our mind that we
wanted to go to school together.
I don't think we wanted to lose
the bond we had.''
Their closeness created a prob
lem earlier this season. Because
the Whitlingers spend so much
time together, some of their team
mates were under the impression
that they didn't want to assim
ilate with the rest of the team.
"I feel bad because that's not
the impression we wanted to give.
It's just we know we can count
on each other. It's not meant to
be negative," says Tami.
"It's hard for other people to
relate to what Tami and I have
as twins," adds Teri. "She's the
one person through thick and thin
I know will be there."
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
explains that the tension between
the Whitlingers and their team
mates resulted largely from
Tami's personality. "Tami is very
aloof, was missing her boyfriend
(and) is very stand-offish," says
Brennan. "She could afford to do
that because she had Teri. And
Teri, being her closest friend in
the whole wide world, felt
obligated to defend her."
The fact that Tami was playing
No. 1 as a freshman might also
have caused some friction, adds
Brennan. "I don't care who you
are, if Mother Theresa comes on
the team and plays No. 1 as a
freshman and forgets to say hello,
watch out."
All parties agree that the situ
ation has improved since the be
ginning of the season. "It took
some getting used to," says Bren
nan. "It took Teri paving the way
