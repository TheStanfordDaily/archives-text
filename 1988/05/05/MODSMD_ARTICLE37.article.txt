# Tami and Teri: partners for life
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Team tennis is in many ways
a contradiction in terms. People
who play one of the most individ
ual of all individual sports are
expected to come toget her to form
a group. Needless to say, cohesion
can be difficult to achieve, and
camaraderie often has a contrived
look to it.
Such haa not been the case for
two members of this year's Stan
ford women's tennis team. They
have been an inseparable team
since they were born five minutes
apart on Nov. 13, 1968.

Tami and Teri Whitlinger are,
by all accounts, partners for life.
John Whitlinger, their uncle and
assistant coach of the men's ten
nis team, calls them "best
friends." Yet, their relationship is
more than just a friendship. On
an emotional level, they seem to
experience life together.
"1 feel like everything that hap
pens to Tami happens to me,"
Teri says.
The closeness of the Whitlinger
twins is most apparent at Stan
ford tennis matches. When one is
not playing, she will become
engrossed in the other's match,
watching each point nervously,

cringing with each mis-hit, and
offering encouragement in be
tween points. "If she loses, I feel
like I've lost," says Tami.
Even when they are on the
court at the same time in a dual
match, the Whitlingers continue
to keep tabs on each other. "I
know it's important for me to
hear her voice, and she's told me
she wants to hear mine," Tami
says.
Yet, both admit that at times
they have become so worried
about the other's match that their
own game has suffered. "Some
times I have the hardest time with
that," says Teri. "I'll find myself
getting all wrapped up in her
match. Most of the time I'm more
concerned with her winning. It's
hard. It's really hard, because I
get so nervous watching her."
Any lack of concentration that
has resulted has not been
reflected in the Whitlingers'
records. Their first season at
Stanford has been extremely suc
cessful to date. Tami, the team's
No. 1 singles player, has beaten
several of the top collegiate
players this year. She has a 38-6
overall record and a No. 3 national
ranking. Teri had a 20-match win
ning streak at one point in the
season and is currently 38-5 and
ranked 17th.
The Whitlingers hail from
Neenah, Wis., halfway across the
country, but they were destined
to attend Stanford since they were
five years of age. Uncle John
played on the Stanford men's
team from 1973 to 1975, and
Tami and Teri became the Car
dinal's youngest fans during that
period. "We were like the little
mascots," Teri laughs.
Between 1975 and 1987, the
Whitlingers honed their tennis
skills to a level that made them
prime candidates for a tennis
powerhouse like Stanford. Tami's
credentials included 1985 national
indoor singles champion, 1986 na
tional outdoor champion, four
time Wisconsin high school state
titlist and 1987 Junior Wightman
Cup Team member.
Among Teri's accomplishments
on the junior circuit were the
1985 16-and-under singles na
tional championship. She, too,
was a Junior Wightman Cup
Team member last summer.
When considering which college
to attend, the Whitlingers had

little considering to do. All factors
pointed to Stanford: the school's
renowned tennis program, their
previous connection with Stan
ford and the fact that John was
living in the area and working as
an assistant to Dick Gould, the
men's tennis coach.
"I knew if we were accepted, it
would definitely be Stanford,"
Teri says. "Coming to Stanford
has been a dream of ours since
John was here."
As "best friends," the Whitlin
gers never gave much thought to
attending different schools. "Our
parents mentioned just briefly the
idea, but neither of us took it
seriously," says Tami. "We had
decided in our mind that we
wanted to go to school together.
I don't think we wanted to lose
the bond we had.''
Their closeness created a prob
lem earlier this season. Because
the Whitlingers spend so much
time together, some of their team
mates were under the impression
that they didn't want to assim
ilate with the rest of the team.
"I feel bad because that's not
the impression we wanted to give.
It's just we know we can count
on each other. It's not meant to
be negative," says Tami.
"It's hard for other people to
relate to what Tami and I have
as twins," adds Teri. "She's the
one person through thick and thin
I know will be there."
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
explains that the tension between
the Whitlingers and their team
mates resulted largely from
Tami's personality. "Tami is very
aloof, was missing her boyfriend
(and) is very stand-offish," says
Brennan. "She could afford to do
that because she had Teri. And
Teri, being her closest friend in
the whole wide world, felt
obligated to defend her."
The fact that Tami was playing
No. 1 as a freshman might also
have caused some friction, adds
Brennan. "I don't care who you
are, if Mother Theresa comes on
the team and plays No. 1 as a
freshman and forgets to say hello,
watch out."
All parties agree that the situ
ation has improved since the be
ginning of the season. "It took
some getting used to," says Bren
nan. "It took Teri paving the way

secutive NCAA title.
a little bit. But Tami's come a
hundred miles."
"We've tried to talk to them
(their teammates) and tell them
it's nothing against them," says
Tami. "I think they've gotten to
know our personalities a little bit
better, and we've tried to accom
modate them."
The Whitlingers' personalities
have to some degree been shaped
by their order of birth. Over the
course of 18 years, five minutes
may seem like a blink of an eye.
Nevertheless, Tami is five
minutes older than Teri, and she
has played the role of older sister.
"I think I try to act more
grown-up," Tami says. "She loves
to be child like. I'm not always
like that. . . . She's more outgoing,
and she likes to be around people.
I'm more inward, and I often
don't open up enough to some
people. I like to be alone, but I
enjoy being with people too, so at
times I can be jolly and have fun
like Teri."
Their contrasting personalities
had a lot to do with their different
reactions to Stanford. Brennan
likes to refer to the Whitlingers
as the Pepsodent Twins, but only
Teri was flashing her pearly
whites at the beginning of the
school year. Tami's adjustment
was not smooth. "I didn't feel that
happy here," she says."I felt lone
ly-
"Because of my personality, I've
had a little more problem (adjust
ing). Teri's been able to meet
people and have fun."
"Tami's come a long way in the
past couple of months," says John
Whitlinger. "She was really strug
gling, (but) now she's come out
of her shell."
Tami has rarely struggled on

the tennis court, especially
against sister Teri, whom she has
not lost to in approximately 100
matches since they were 10 years
old. Included in Tami's
dominance over her younger
sister are two victories this
season.
"It's really hard to play each
other," Teri says."The hardest
part is it feels like more of a prac
tice match."
"When Tami and Teri play, not
often is it a very good match,"
John laughs. "It should be a great
match, but a lot of times it's 6-1,
6-2."
"Now it (the losing streak) is
all psychological," Teri adds. "I
don't have a fighting spirit out
there when I play her."
The Whitlingers have had
identical training. Their grandfat
her, Warren, has coached both of
them, and they have very similar
types of games. But Tami was
consistently ranked higher than
Teri throughout their junior
careers and she has continued to
perform at a slightly higher level
than her younger sister.
Everyone that knows the Whit
lingers, including Tami and Teri,
has come to the same conclusion
as to why Tami has had more
success.
"I've always been mentally
tougher than her," Tami explains.
"I'm a great competitor. I don't
fold easily. I hate to lose."
"She's more mentally tough
than I am," Teri agrees. "That's
why she's better."
"Personally, I like the way they
both hit the ball," says John.
"Sometimes Teri's strokes are
even better. (But) for some reason
Tami has that killer instinct, that
mental toughness to put her over
the top."
Despite Tami's overwhelming
success against Teri, they claim
that they have rarely gotten on
each other's nerves when they

have played. Their history as a
doubles team has been markedly
different, however. They may
have a close relationship, but they
are still siblings, and they have
been known to have an occasional
sisterly dispute on the court.
"We've had our moments," Teri
says with a smile. "We laugh
about it, we really do."
The Whitlingers can be a very
potent doubles team. They were
ranked second nationally as 14-
and 16-year-olds, and this season
they are 19-4 overall. But despite
their seemingly impressive record
this year, neither has been
pleased. "We've been pretty dis
appointed," Teri says. "We've had
more trouble getting along on the
court."
"I don't feel as comfortable
playing doubles," Tami explains.
"I tend to get upset and let things
bother me with Teri. We've sat
down and said we've got to quit
this. We've got to work together."
One thing the Whitlingers
would like to do together is play
professional tennis. They have al
ways been good athletes ("We
were always the two little
towheads running around playing
with the boys," Teri remembers),
and they have solid baseline
games, but they both realize that
they need to develop net games
before they turn pro. As Uncle
John says, "There aren't many
Chrissie Everts anymore."
When Tami was struggling to
adjust at Stanford, there was
speculation that she might not
come back next year. But her
boyfriend from Wisconsin is plan
ning to move out here next year,
and she is almost certain now that
she will return.
Tami currently has a groin pull
in her left leg that threatens to
keep her out of next week's NCAA
championships in Los Angeles,
but if she is able to return and
win the national singles title,

there is "a slight chance" that she
will turn pro. "I'd have to sit down
and talk to my grandfather and
father and see what they say. But
right now I'm planning on coming
back."
Her sister is more certain.
"She's going to come back for
sure," Teri says. "You should take
as much advantage of being in
college and having fun."
Tami is not set on staying at
Stanford for four years if she feels
at some point that she is ready
to make the jump to professional
tennis. "I think it's important to
turn pro at the right time. I
learned from my uncle. He won
the NCAAs (in 1974) as a soph
omore and should have turned
pro."
John, who agrees that in
retrospect he probably should
have left Stanford after winning
the NCAA championship, says he
hopes to have some input in any
decisions Tami makes. "If she can
go out and do a great job right
away — say the top 20 (in the
world) — then it's worth it," John
says. "But if she's going to hang
around 70 or 80 (in the rankings),
then it's not."
If Tami does go early, she
knows that the most difficult part
will be leaving her sister. The
Whitlingers have never been far
apart in 18 years, and at least
one of the two doesn't look for
ward to splitting up. Says Tami:
"Teri and I have sat down and
had many talks about [Tami turn
ing pro early]. She's said, 'To be
honest with you, I don't want you
to leave.' "
But Tami realizes that "the
time will come when we have to
part," and she knows that even
if she turns pro early, Teri will
join her on the tour someday soon.
After all, Teri has always been
just a few minutes behind her
older sister.
Team tennis is in many ways
a contradiction in terms. People
who play one of the most individ
ual of all individual sports are
expected to come toget her to form

ilate with the rest of the team.
"I feel bad because that's not
the impression we wanted to give.
It's just we know we can count
on each other. It's not meant to
be negative," says Tami.
"It's hard for other people to
relate to what Tami and I have
as twins," adds Teri. "She's the
one person through thick and thin
I know will be there."
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
explains that the tension between
the Whitlingers and their team
mates resulted largely from
Tami's personality. "Tami is very
aloof, was missing her boyfriend
(and) is very stand-offish," says
Brennan. "She could afford to do
that because she had Teri. And
Teri, being her closest friend in
the whole wide world, felt
obligated to defend her."
The fact that Tami was playing
No. 1 as a freshman might also
have caused some friction, adds
Brennan. "I don't care who you
are, if Mother Theresa comes on
the team and plays No. 1 as a
freshman and forgets to say hello,
watch out."
All parties agree that the situ
ation has improved since the be
ginning of the season. "It took
some getting used to," says Bren
nan. "It took Teri paving the way

a little bit. But Tami's come a
hundred miles."
"We've tried to talk to them
(their teammates) and tell them
it's nothing against them," says
Tami. "I think they've gotten to
know our personalities a little bit
better, and we've tried to accom
modate them."
The Whitlingers' personalities
have to some degree been shaped
by their order of birth. Over the
course of 18 years, five minutes
may seem like a blink of an eye.
Nevertheless, Tami is five
minutes older than Teri, and she
has played the role of older sister.
"I think I try to act more
grown-up," Tami says. "She loves
to be child like. I'm not always
like that. . . . She's more outgoing,
and she likes to be around people.
I'm more inward, and I often
don't open up enough to some
people. I like to be alone, but I
enjoy being with people too, so at
times I can be jolly and have fun
like Teri."
Their contrasting personalities
had a lot to do with their different
reactions to Stanford. Brennan
likes to refer to the Whitlingers
as the Pepsodent Twins, but only
Teri was flashing her pearly
whites at the beginning of the
school year. Tami's adjustment
was not smooth. "I didn't feel that
happy here," she says."I felt lone
ly-
"Because of my personality, I've
had a little more problem (adjust
ing). Teri's been able to meet
people and have fun."
"Tami's come a long way in the
past couple of months," says John
Whitlinger. "She was really strug
gling, (but) now she's come out
of her shell."
Tami has rarely struggled on

the tennis court, especially
against sister Teri, whom she has
not lost to in approximately 100
matches since they were 10 years
old. Included in Tami's
dominance over her younger
sister are two victories this
season.
"It's really hard to play each
other," Teri says."The hardest
part is it feels like more of a prac
tice match."
"When Tami and Teri play, not
often is it a very good match,"
John laughs. "It should be a great
match, but a lot of times it's 6-1,
6-2."
"Now it (the losing streak) is
all psychological," Teri adds. "I
don't have a fighting spirit out
there when I play her."
The Whitlingers have had
identical training. Their grandfat
her, Warren, has coached both of
them, and they have very similar
types of games. But Tami was
consistently ranked higher than
Teri throughout their junior
careers and she has continued to
perform at a slightly higher level
than her younger sister.
Everyone that knows the Whit
lingers, including Tami and Teri,
has come to the same conclusion
as to why Tami has had more
success.
"I've always been mentally
tougher than her," Tami explains.
"I'm a great competitor. I don't
fold easily. I hate to lose."
"She's more mentally tough
than I am," Teri agrees. "That's
why she's better."
"Personally, I like the way they
both hit the ball," says John.
"Sometimes Teri's strokes are
even better. (But) for some reason
Tami has that killer instinct, that
mental toughness to put her over
the top."
Despite Tami's overwhelming
success against Teri, they claim
that they have rarely gotten on
each other's nerves when they

have played. Their history as a
doubles team has been markedly
different, however. They may
have a close relationship, but they
are still siblings, and they have
been known to have an occasional
sisterly dispute on the court.
"We've had our moments," Teri
says with a smile. "We laugh
about it, we really do."
The Whitlingers can be a very
potent doubles team. They were
ranked second nationally as 14-
and 16-year-olds, and this season
they are 19-4 overall. But despite
their seemingly impressive record
this year, neither has been
pleased. "We've been pretty dis
appointed," Teri says. "We've had
more trouble getting along on the
court."
"I don't feel as comfortable
playing doubles," Tami explains.
"I tend to get upset and let things
bother me with Teri. We've sat
down and said we've got to quit
this. We've got to work together."
One thing the Whitlingers
would like to do together is play
professional tennis. They have al
ways been good athletes ("We
were always the two little
towheads running around playing
with the boys," Teri remembers),
and they have solid baseline
games, but they both realize that
they need to develop net games
before they turn pro. As Uncle
John says, "There aren't many
Chrissie Everts anymore."
When Tami was struggling to
adjust at Stanford, there was
speculation that she might not
come back next year. But her
boyfriend from Wisconsin is plan
ning to move out here next year,
and she is almost certain now that
she will return.
Tami currently has a groin pull
in her left leg that threatens to
keep her out of next week's NCAA
championships in Los Angeles,
but if she is able to return and
win the national singles title,

there is "a slight chance" that she
will turn pro. "I'd have to sit down
and talk to my grandfather and
father and see what they say. But
right now I'm planning on coming
back."
Her sister is more certain.
"She's going to come back for
sure," Teri says. "You should take
as much advantage of being in
college and having fun."
Tami is not set on staying at
Stanford for four years if she feels
at some point that she is ready
to make the jump to professional
tennis. "I think it's important to
turn pro at the right time. I
learned from my uncle. He won
the NCAAs (in 1974) as a soph
omore and should have turned
pro."
John, who agrees that in
retrospect he probably should
have left Stanford after winning
the NCAA championship, says he
hopes to have some input in any
decisions Tami makes. "If she can
go out and do a great job right
away — say the top 20 (in the
world) — then it's worth it," John
says. "But if she's going to hang
around 70 or 80 (in the rankings),
then it's not."
If Tami does go early, she
knows that the most difficult part
will be leaving her sister. The
Whitlingers have never been far
apart in 18 years, and at least
one of the two doesn't look for
ward to splitting up. Says Tami:
"Teri and I have sat down and
had many talks about [Tami turn
ing pro early]. She's said, 'To be
honest with you, I don't want you
to leave.' "
But Tami realizes that "the
time will come when we have to
part," and she knows that even
if she turns pro early, Teri will
join her on the tour someday soon.
After all, Teri has always been
just a few minutes behind her
older sister.
Team tennis is in many ways
a contradiction in terms. People
who play one of the most individ
ual of all individual sports are
expected to come toget her to form
a group. Needless to say, cohesion
can be difficult to achieve, and
camaraderie often has a contrived
look to it.
Such haa not been the case for
two members of this year's Stan
ford women's tennis team. They
have been an inseparable team
since they were born five minutes
apart on Nov. 13, 1968.

Tami and Teri Whitlinger are,
by all accounts, partners for life.
John Whitlinger, their uncle and
assistant coach of the men's ten
nis team, calls them "best
friends." Yet, their relationship is
more than just a friendship. On
an emotional level, they seem to
experience life together.
"1 feel like everything that hap
pens to Tami happens to me,"
Teri says.
The closeness of the Whitlinger
twins is most apparent at Stan
ford tennis matches. When one is
not playing, she will become
engrossed in the other's match,
watching each point nervously,

cringing with each mis-hit, and
offering encouragement in be
tween points. "If she loses, I feel
like I've lost," says Tami.
Even when they are on the
court at the same time in a dual
match, the Whitlingers continue
to keep tabs on each other. "I
know it's important for me to
hear her voice, and she's told me
she wants to hear mine," Tami
says.
Yet, both admit that at times
they have become so worried
about the other's match that their
own game has suffered. "Some
times I have the hardest time with
that," says Teri. "I'll find myself
getting all wrapped up in her
match. Most of the time I'm more
concerned with her winning. It's
hard. It's really hard, because I
get so nervous watching her."
Any lack of concentration that
has resulted has not been
reflected in the Whitlingers'
records. Their first season at
Stanford has been extremely suc
cessful to date. Tami, the team's
No. 1 singles player, has beaten
several of the top collegiate
players this year. She has a 38-6
overall record and a No. 3 national
ranking. Teri had a 20-match win
ning streak at one point in the
season and is currently 38-5 and
ranked 17th.
The Whitlingers hail from
Neenah, Wis., halfway across the
country, but they were destined
to attend Stanford since they were
five years of age. Uncle John
played on the Stanford men's
team from 1973 to 1975, and
Tami and Teri became the Car
dinal's youngest fans during that
period. "We were like the little
mascots," Teri laughs.
Between 1975 and 1987, the
Whitlingers honed their tennis
skills to a level that made them
prime candidates for a tennis
powerhouse like Stanford. Tami's
credentials included 1985 national
indoor singles champion, 1986 na
tional outdoor champion, four
time Wisconsin high school state
titlist and 1987 Junior Wightman
Cup Team member.
Among Teri's accomplishments
on the junior circuit were the
1985 16-and-under singles na
tional championship. She, too,
was a Junior Wightman Cup
Team member last summer.
When considering which college
to attend, the Whitlingers had

little considering to do. All factors
pointed to Stanford: the school's
renowned tennis program, their
previous connection with Stan
ford and the fact that John was
living in the area and working as
an assistant to Dick Gould, the
men's tennis coach.
"I knew if we were accepted, it
would definitely be Stanford,"
Teri says. "Coming to Stanford
has been a dream of ours since
John was here."
As "best friends," the Whitlin
gers never gave much thought to
attending different schools. "Our
parents mentioned just briefly the
idea, but neither of us took it
seriously," says Tami. "We had
decided in our mind that we
wanted to go to school together.
I don't think we wanted to lose
the bond we had.''
Their closeness created a prob
lem earlier this season. Because
the Whitlingers spend so much
time together, some of their team
mates were under the impression
that they didn't want to assim
ilate with the rest of the team.
"I feel bad because that's not
the impression we wanted to give.
It's just we know we can count
on each other. It's not meant to
be negative," says Tami.
"It's hard for other people to
relate to what Tami and I have

"I'm a great competitor. I don't
fold easily. I hate to lose."
"She's more mentally tough
than I am," Teri agrees. "That's
why she's better."
"Personally, I like the way they
both hit the ball," says John.
"Sometimes Teri's strokes are
even better. (But) for some reason
Tami has that killer instinct, that
mental toughness to put her over
the top."
Despite Tami's overwhelming
success against Teri, they claim
that they have rarely gotten on
each other's nerves when they

have played. Their history as a
doubles team has been markedly
different, however. They may
have a close relationship, but they
are still siblings, and they have
been known to have an occasional
sisterly dispute on the court.
"We've had our moments," Teri
says with a smile. "We laugh
about it, we really do."
The Whitlingers can be a very
potent doubles team. They were
ranked second nationally as 14-
and 16-year-olds, and this season
they are 19-4 overall. But despite
their seemingly impressive record
this year, neither has been
pleased. "We've been pretty dis
appointed," Teri says. "We've had
more trouble getting along on the
court."
"I don't feel as comfortable
playing doubles," Tami explains.
"I tend to get upset and let things
bother me with Teri. We've sat
down and said we've got to quit
this. We've got to work together."
One thing the Whitlingers
would like to do together is play
professional tennis. They have al
ways been good athletes ("We
were always the two little
towheads running around playing
with the boys," Teri remembers),
and they have solid baseline
games, but they both realize that
they need to develop net games
before they turn pro. As Uncle
John says, "There aren't many
Chrissie Everts anymore."
When Tami was struggling to
adjust at Stanford, there was
speculation that she might not
come back next year. But her
boyfriend from Wisconsin is plan
ning to move out here next year,
and she is almost certain now that
she will return.
Tami currently has a groin pull
in her left leg that threatens to
keep her out of next week's NCAA
championships in Los Angeles,
but if she is able to return and
win the national singles title,

there is "a slight chance" that she
will turn pro. "I'd have to sit down
and talk to my grandfather and
father and see what they say. But
right now I'm planning on coming
back."
Her sister is more certain.
"She's going to come back for
sure," Teri says. "You should take
as much advantage of being in
college and having fun."
Tami is not set on staying at
Stanford for four years if she feels
at some point that she is ready
to make the jump to professional
tennis. "I think it's important to
turn pro at the right time. I
learned from my uncle. He won
the NCAAs (in 1974) as a soph
omore and should have turned
pro."
John, who agrees that in
retrospect he probably should
have left Stanford after winning
the NCAA championship, says he
hopes to have some input in any
decisions Tami makes. "If she can
go out and do a great job right
away — say the top 20 (in the
world) — then it's worth it," John
says. "But if she's going to hang
around 70 or 80 (in the rankings),
then it's not."
If Tami does go early, she
knows that the most difficult part
will be leaving her sister. The
Whitlingers have never been far
apart in 18 years, and at least
one of the two doesn't look for
ward to splitting up. Says Tami:
"Teri and I have sat down and
had many talks about [Tami turn
ing pro early]. She's said, 'To be
honest with you, I don't want you
to leave.' "
But Tami realizes that "the
time will come when we have to
part," and she knows that even
if she turns pro early, Teri will
join her on the tour someday soon.
After all, Teri has always been
just a few minutes behind her
older sister.
Team tennis is in many ways
a contradiction in terms. People
who play one of the most individ
ual of all individual sports are
expected to come toget her to form
a group. Needless to say, cohesion
can be difficult to achieve, and
camaraderie often has a contrived
look to it.
Such haa not been the case for
two members of this year's Stan
ford women's tennis team. They
have been an inseparable team
since they were born five minutes
apart on Nov. 13, 1968.

Tami and Teri Whitlinger are,
by all accounts, partners for life.
John Whitlinger, their uncle and
assistant coach of the men's ten
nis team, calls them "best
friends." Yet, their relationship is
more than just a friendship. On
an emotional level, they seem to
experience life together.
"1 feel like everything that hap
pens to Tami happens to me,"
Teri says.
The closeness of the Whitlinger
twins is most apparent at Stan
ford tennis matches. When one is
not playing, she will become
engrossed in the other's match,
watching each point nervously,

cringing with each mis-hit, and
offering encouragement in be
tween points. "If she loses, I feel
like I've lost," says Tami.
Even when they are on the
court at the same time in a dual
match, the Whitlingers continue
to keep tabs on each other. "I
know it's important for me to
hear her voice, and she's told me
she wants to hear mine," Tami
says.
Yet, both admit that at times
they have become so worried
about the other's match that their
own game has suffered. "Some
times I have the hardest time with
that," says Teri. "I'll find myself
getting all wrapped up in her
match. Most of the time I'm more
concerned with her winning. It's
hard. It's really hard, because I
get so nervous watching her."
Any lack of concentration that
has resulted has not been
reflected in the Whitlingers'
records. Their first season at
Stanford has been extremely suc
cessful to date. Tami, the team's
No. 1 singles player, has beaten
several of the top collegiate
players this year. She has a 38-6
overall record and a No. 3 national
ranking. Teri had a 20-match win
ning streak at one point in the
season and is currently 38-5 and
ranked 17th.
The Whitlingers hail from
Neenah, Wis., halfway across the
country, but they were destined
to attend Stanford since they were
five years of age. Uncle John
played on the Stanford men's
team from 1973 to 1975, and
Tami and Teri became the Car
dinal's youngest fans during that
period. "We were like the little
mascots," Teri laughs.
Between 1975 and 1987, the
Whitlingers honed their tennis
skills to a level that made them
prime candidates for a tennis
powerhouse like Stanford. Tami's
credentials included 1985 national
indoor singles champion, 1986 na
tional outdoor champion, four
time Wisconsin high school state
titlist and 1987 Junior Wightman
Cup Team member.
Among Teri's accomplishments
on the junior circuit were the
1985 16-and-under singles na
tional championship. She, too,
was a Junior Wightman Cup
Team member last summer.
When considering which college
to attend, the Whitlingers had

little considering to do. All factors
pointed to Stanford: the school's
renowned tennis program, their
previous connection with Stan
ford and the fact that John was
living in the area and working as
an assistant to Dick Gould, the
men's tennis coach.
"I knew if we were accepted, it
would definitely be Stanford,"
Teri says. "Coming to Stanford
has been a dream of ours since
John was here."
As "best friends," the Whitlin
gers never gave much thought to
attending different schools. "Our
parents mentioned just briefly the
idea, but neither of us took it
seriously," says Tami. "We had
decided in our mind that we
wanted to go to school together.
I don't think we wanted to lose
the bond we had.''
Their closeness created a prob
lem earlier this season. Because
the Whitlingers spend so much
time together, some of their team
mates were under the impression
that they didn't want to assim
ilate with the rest of the team.
"I feel bad because that's not
the impression we wanted to give.
It's just we know we can count
on each other. It's not meant to
be negative," says Tami.
"It's hard for other people to
relate to what Tami and I have
as twins," adds Teri. "She's the
one person through thick and thin
I know will be there."
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
explains that the tension between
the Whitlingers and their team
mates resulted largely from
Tami's personality. "Tami is very
aloof, was missing her boyfriend
(and) is very stand-offish," says
Brennan. "She could afford to do
that because she had Teri. And
Teri, being her closest friend in
the whole wide world, felt
obligated to defend her."
The fact that Tami was playing
No. 1 as a freshman might also
have caused some friction, adds
Brennan. "I don't care who you
are, if Mother Theresa comes on
the team and plays No. 1 as a
freshman and forgets to say hello,
watch out."
All parties agree that the situ
ation has improved since the be
ginning of the season. "It took
some getting used to," says Bren
nan. "It took Teri paving the way

a little bit. But Tami's come a
hundred miles."
"We've tried to talk to them
(their teammates) and tell them
it's nothing against them," says
Tami. "I think they've gotten to
know our personalities a little bit
better, and we've tried to accom
modate them."
The Whitlingers' personalities
have to some degree been shaped
by their order of birth. Over the
course of 18 years, five minutes
may seem like a blink of an eye.
Nevertheless, Tami is five
minutes older than Teri, and she
has played the role of older sister.
"I think I try to act more
grown-up," Tami says. "She loves
to be child like. I'm not always
like that. . . . She's more outgoing,
and she likes to be around people.
I'm more inward, and I often
don't open up enough to some
people. I like to be alone, but I
enjoy being with people too, so at
times I can be jolly and have fun
like Teri."
Their contrasting personalities
had a lot to do with their different
reactions to Stanford. Brennan
likes to refer to the Whitlingers
as the Pepsodent Twins, but only
Teri was flashing her pearly
whites at the beginning of the
school year. Tami's adjustment
was not smooth. "I didn't feel that
happy here," she says."I felt lone
ly-
"Because of my personality, I've
had a little more problem (adjust
ing). Teri's been able to meet
people and have fun."
"Tami's come a long way in the
past couple of months," says John
Whitlinger. "She was really strug
gling, (but) now she's come out
of her shell."
Tami has rarely struggled on

the tennis court, especially
against sister Teri, whom she has
not lost to in approximately 100
matches since they were 10 years
old. Included in Tami's
dominance over her younger
sister are two victories this
season.
"It's really hard to play each
other," Teri says."The hardest
part is it feels like more of a prac
tice match."
"When Tami and Teri play, not
often is it a very good match,"
John laughs. "It should be a great
match, but a lot of times it's 6-1,
6-2."
"Now it (the losing streak) is
all psychological," Teri adds. "I
don't have a fighting spirit out
there when I play her."
The Whitlingers have had
identical training. Their grandfat
her, Warren, has coached both of
them, and they have very similar
types of games. But Tami was
consistently ranked higher than
Teri throughout their junior
careers and she has continued to
perform at a slightly higher level
than her younger sister.
Everyone that knows the Whit
lingers, including Tami and Teri,
has come to the same conclusion
as to why Tami has had more
success.
"I've always been mentally
tougher than her," Tami explains.
"I'm a great competitor. I don't
fold easily. I hate to lose."
"She's more mentally tough
than I am," Teri agrees. "That's
why she's better."
