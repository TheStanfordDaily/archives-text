During the cold, cloudy and
windswept afternoon Saturday
at Chabot Junior College, the
Stanford men's ultimate fris
bee team continued its winning
streak by capturing the North
ern California College Ultimate
Championships and upping its
collegiate season record to 26-
0.
In the first game of the day,
No. 1 seed Stanford was
matched against the host team,
Chabot, last year's champion
and this year's No. 4 seed. The
game began under the
onslaught of raging winds,
which favored Chabot, and
Stanford quickly found itself
down 4-3 in a game played to
11. At that point, the Cardinal
figured out the winds as well
as Chabot's zone defense and
went on a 5-1 run, which in
cluded 3 upwind goals, to take
the lead 8-5. Both teams then
traded goals and Stanford went
on to win 11-8.
In the next game, Stanford
played an overmatched Ohlone
Junior College and was an easy
11-3 winner.
Stanford's next opponent
was third-seeded California.
The Stanford men again found
themselves, as in their first
game, playing sluggishly ini
tially and trailing 4-3. The Car

dinal team then adjusted to its
opponent's zone and was able
to forge a slim lead of 6-4. At
that point Stanford altered its
own zone defense to take ad
vantage of a prevailing cros
swind and proceeded to shut
down the Bear offense and
cruise to an 11-7 win.
In the final game of the day
the team was matched against
UC-Santa Cruz, the No. 2 seed,
for the tournament champion
ship. By the afternoon the
winds had actually increased,
and it looked as though the
victor would be the team that
won the initial flip to deter
mine which team had the wind
at its back. Stanford not only
lost the flip but also the first
point.
"At that point," co-captain
Steve Weilbach, a graduate stu
dent, said, "I really thought
that we were out of it."
However, with some timely
defensive play and determined
offense, the team regained the
disc and tied the score at 1-1.
After a quick on-field confer
ence, Stanford decided to play
zone defense off both offensive
and defensive points. The move
proved to be decisive since it
allowed the team to reel off
nine unanswered goals. The
Banana Slugs scored only one
more goal in the remainder of
the game and fell 11-2.
