# Kennedy, Drell to join national committee

In an effort to
strengthen what they
called an ineffective
presidential scientific
advisory committee,
University President
Donald Kennedy and
SLAC Deputy Director
Sidney Drell will serve
on a newly created sci
entific advisory commis
sion.

Both Kennedy and Drell received of
fers to join the Carnegie Commission
on Science, Technology and Government
in April. The commission will meet for
the first time at the end of this month.
The commission is primarily designed
to "examine and recommend means to
improve the quality of science advice to
the government," Drell said. "There is
a need for the president to have the
best possible understanding of the sci
entific and technological issues involved
in important policy decisions."
Kennedy stated that one of the com
mission's priorities may be to devise a

more effective means to organize a sci
entific advisory committee for the pres
ident.
Both Kennedy and Drell blasted the
current presidential science advisory
body. "It struck me that we could get
more mileage out of the Office of Science
and Technology Policy," Kennedy said.
Kennedy was the senior consultant for
that office in 1976 and 1977.
Kennedy and Drell also complained
that the current science advisory com
mittee is crippled by the lack of support
and attention it receives from the pres
ident and is chronically understaffed.
"No mechanism will be effective un
less the president uses it and wants it
to be," Drell said.
The commission is funded by the Car
negie Corporation of New York, a phi
lanthropic organization that supports a
wide range of activities. Health and ed
ucation in underdeveloped countries,
mental health and arms research are
several of the areas the corporation tar
gets, according to Drell.
Drell stressed that neither the Car-


Kennedy
negie Corp. nor the commission
are lobbying organizations.
"The commission is set up to
study problems and make recom
mendations for the good of the
nation and science," Drell said.

"It won't be effective if it has a
political slant."
Kennedy added that the com
mission's influence "necessarily
depends on the quality of the
report and the people appointed
to the commission."
The commission includes
former President Jimmy Carter,
as well as industry executives and

academics. "It's a good group and
the Carnegie Corp. is very influen
tial in the development of public
policies," Kennedy said.
The president of the corpora
tion, David Hamburg, is a former
Stanford Medical School profes
sor. He knows Kennedy and Drell
and is familiar with their work,
Drell said.
