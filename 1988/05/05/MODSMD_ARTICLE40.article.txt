For the second
straight year,
Stanford Wom
en's Golf Coach
Tim Baldwin
has garnered
the nation's top

recruiting class.
Last year, Baldwin brought
Michele Lyford, the year's top
recruit, Jodi Figley, a close sec
ond, and highly-rated Kristin
Ryan to the Farm.
This year is almost identical.
Again the top recruit in the
country will come to Stanford,
this time in the person of Adele
Moore. "For the past two years,
she has been, tournament in
and tournament out, the top
junior player in the country,"
Baldwin said.
Moore's accomplishments
over the past two years on the
American Junior Golf Associa
tion's summer circuit are sim
ply amazing. In 1986 she was
chosen as the Rolex AJGA
Junior Player of the year. That
year she won the PGA Junior,
the Western Junior and the
AJGA Tournament of Cham
pions. These tournaments,
along with the USGA Junior,
are considered the four
"majors" of junior golf. In 1987
Moore defended her Western
title and for the third time was
a finalist in the match-play for
mat of the USGA Junior.
"As a junior she's won every
thing she could win (except the
USGA)," freshman Jodi Figley
said. "She's just incredible."
"She (Moore) is in the same
class as Kathleen McCarthy as

far as a recruit coming into
Stanford," Baldwin concluded.
Complementing Moore will
be Stephanie Davis, who hails
from Bainbridge Island, Wash.,
and Audrey Wooding of
Tacoma, Wash. Both are
among the nation's top 10
recruits.
"The word in Washington is
that Stephanie (Davis) and
Audrey (Wooding) are the
finest players to come out of
the Pacific Northwest since Jo
Anne Carner," Baldwin said.
Davis was the 1987 Junior
Americas Cup Champion. The
tournament last summer
brought the best juniors from
Canada, Central and South
America and the western half
of the United States to Mexico
City. She also was the medalist
in the 1987 Pacific Northwest
Junior Championship, and two
weeks ago won her first AJGA
event of the year at the Fair
way Oaks Junior Classic.
Like Moore, Davis chose
Stanford because of its aca
demic quality and the
excellence of the golf program.
Wooding was the 1986
Pacific Northwest Junior
Champion and is the reigning
Washington State High School
Champion.
Also joining the team next
fall will be Martha Richards.
Hailing from Hudson, Wise.,
Richards is Parade Magazine's
national high school Basketball
Player of the Year. When not
playing basketball during the
winter, she intends to play for
Baldwin. Although the golf
season lasts all year, the team's
schedule peaks in March, April,
and May, as basketball ends.
