## Summer health

Any time is a good time to start
working toward a healthier lifestyle.
If yon are in shape and healthy, it
is important to keep it that way.
The benefits of taking care of your
self when you are well are soundly
documented.
If your physical condition or your
diet is not what you would like it
to be, good whether can be a great
incentive to get started. It seems
that good whether brings many of
us out of hibernation. The increased
availibility of some fruits and
vegitables makes it that much easier
to attend to good nutrition. For
many, sun-worshipping begins anew.
Others struggle with the less
glorious wonders of spring and sum
mer weather, such as allergies.
As you move on to increased out
door activities, keep in mind that
while it is possible to cram for exams,
it is not possible to cram for a healthy
lifestyle. We recommend that you
assess your needs and develop goals
— not burdens — in developing a
healthier lifestyle. Respect your
limits, and keep the process fun.
