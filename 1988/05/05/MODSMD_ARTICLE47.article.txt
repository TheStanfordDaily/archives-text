# Laughing yourself healthy
## 
### Lenoard Krasner, PhD Behavioral Medicine Lab 
At first, writing about humor and
health sounds very simple. Laugh and
the world laughs with you, and you
will be healthy, physically and men
tally. A sense of humor — being able
to fend off the stresses of life by being
able to laugh at yourself and to make
others laugh — is an important part
of healthy living.
Yet the issues involved in the rela
tionship between humor and health
are quite complex. They involve vir
tually every aspect of a human being:
physiology, thought processes, behav
ior, learning experiences, values, fam
ily, friends and the society in which
the individual functions.
The notion that humor can affect
health is certainly not new, going back
to ancient times. The current interest
in the relationship between humor and
health is usually traced to a 1979 book
on the "Anatomy of an Illness as Per
ceived by the Patient" by Norman
Counsins, a prominent editor and pub
lisher. He had been diagnosed as
having a serious, probably fatal disease
in which the connective tissue in the
spine was disintegrating (official diag
nosis — ankylosing spondylitis). The
cause of the difficulty was thought to
be a dysfunction of the adrenal glands
in the endocrine system.
Cousins had read that adrenal ex
haustion could be caused by emotional
tension and that negative emotions
such as frustration or suppressed rage
could have negative effects on body
chemistry. He then concluded that
positive emotions such as love, hope,
faith, laughter and the will to live
could produce positive chemical
changes.
He did research on the effects of
the various medications he was taking
and, in consultation with his physician,
decided that laughter would best en
hance his body chemistry. He set up
a program in a hotel room, leaving
the hospital because laughter would
disturb staff and other patients (and
besides the hotel room cost only a
third as much as the hospital).
In the room he watched TV spoofs
popular in the 1960s called "Candid
Camera" ami old Marx Brothers films.
A nurse would read to him passages
from humor books (e.g.. Max Eastman's
"The Enjoyment of Laughter").
In a relatively short period of time
he literally laughed himself back to
health and all pain disappeared. He

returned to his Saturday Review
editorship, reported continuous health
improvement in subsequent months,
and widely circulated reports of his
experiences in both popular and med
ical publications.
This case history raises many issues.
As strict scientific evidence, the
Cousins case is minimal since it
represents only one person's experi
ence. In addition, the causal linkage
of laughing and specific physiological
effects is not clear-cut.
Further, the Cousins case touches
upon a very important theoretical and
practical issue — the "placebo effect"
— to which Cousins himself devotes
a chapter. The placebo effect occurs
when a patient recovers from illness
because of his belief that his treatment
will cure him, not because of the treat
ment itself.
Of course, a key issue in a discussion
of the effect of humor on health is
the physiological effects of laughtei.

The psychiatrist Dr. William Fry
Jr., an investigator of humor for three
decades, has described "mirth
associated pertubations in five major
systems of the human body: respira
tory, cardiovascular, muscular, en
docrine and central nervous systems.
The effects are most prominently of a
stimulatory nature. The period of stim
ulation is generally followed by a pe
riod of activity diminished below the
usual baseline for that function. The
effects are of varying magnitude, in
several instances coordinated with the
intensity of accompanying laughter."
In effect, emotional tension that con
tributes to stress is lowered through
the cathartic effects of laughing. It has
even been noted that during the time
when people are laughing, they are
not able to smoke or to eat unhealthy
foods. Further, laughter is antithetical
to feelings of anger, rage or even de
pression.
There is still no conclusive scientific
evidence of the relationship between
humor and health. There are, however,
studies demonstrating that humor can
help alleviate physical and mental dis
orders such as heart disease, cardiovas
cular problems, cancer and depression.
A few studies have indicated that
laughter can enhance the immune, res
piratory, cardiovascular and neuro
endocrine systems. However, these
systems can also be affected by
medication, relaxation, exercise, med
itation and diet.
Some writers, physicians and
therapists caution that belief in the
healing power of humor might stop
some people from using proper
medications. Some critics of humor as
treatment even go so far as to imply
that those who believe in the power
of humor would blame the patient if
he or she did not improve from humor.
Whatever studies suggest, it seems
clear that a positive mental attitude,
with a litde humor tossed in, certainly
cannot hurt, and if nothing else, can
help to make life a little more bearable
with any health problem.
There have been studies of the use
of humor in various settings. For ex
ample, one study observed humor in
a hospital and noted that in the oper
ating room, a very high-stress area,
sexual humor predominated. To help
reduce tension, ludicrous behavior,
such as surgeons dropping their surgi
cal trousers, would occur.
Humor in the health field is not
always intentional. For example, there

was a recent article in a humor journal,
"Laughing Matters," which pointed
out that humor can be just what the
doctor ordered — literally and figura
tively.
It then cited quotes lifted verbatum
from the medical records of a general
hospital in a large metropolitan area:
"Patient experiences difficulty swal
lowing tires easily;" "History: pati6nt
was shot in head with .32 caliber rifle.
Chief complaint: headache;" "Patient
referred to hospital by private
physician with green stools;" "This 54-
year-old female is complaining of ab
dominal cramps with BM's on the one
hand and constipation on the other;"
"Patient has been married twice, but
denies any other serious illnesses."
In the field of mental health, humor
has had an important role dating back
at least to Sigmund Freud and his
classic 1905 study "Jokes and Their
Relation to the Unconscious." Freud,
himself a collector of jokes, argued
that it was through jokes that a person
is able to express feelings that have
been repressed. Thus jokes are likely
to be hostile or sexual in content be
cause, according to Freud, these are
major repressed impulses in our soci
ety.
Our own view is that rather than
being a function of repressed wishes,
laughter and the appreciation of humor
are a function of situational stimuli
and habitual/learned patterns of
response.
The use of humor in prevention and
treatment takes a variety of forms,
some of which are even quite funny.
For example, there is a technique
called "paradoxical intervention" used
in psychotherapy. Clients are encour
aged to exaggerate their symptoms to
the point of absurdity.
