# Laughing yourself healthy

### Lenoard Krasner, PhD Behavioral Medicine Lab 
At first, writing about humor and
health sounds very simple. Laugh and
the world laughs with you, and you
will be healthy, physically and men
tally. A sense of humor — being able
to fend off the stresses of life by being
able to laugh at yourself and to make
others laugh — is an important part
of healthy living.
Yet the issues involved in the rela
tionship between humor and health
are quite complex. They involve vir
tually every aspect of a human being:
physiology, thought processes, behav
ior, learning experiences, values, fam
ily, friends and the society in which
the individual functions.
The notion that humor can affect
health is certainly not new, going back
to ancient times. The current interest
in the relationship between humor and
health is usually traced to a 1979 book
on the "Anatomy of an Illness as Per
ceived by the Patient" by Norman
Counsins, a prominent editor and pub
lisher. He had been diagnosed as
having a serious, probably fatal disease
in which the connective tissue in the
spine was disintegrating (official diag
nosis — ankylosing spondylitis). The
cause of the difficulty was thought to
be a dysfunction of the adrenal glands
in the endocrine system.
Cousins had read that adrenal ex
haustion could be caused by emotional
tension and that negative emotions
such as frustration or suppressed rage
could have negative effects on body
chemistry. He then concluded that
positive emotions such as love, hope,
faith, laughter and the will to live
could produce positive chemical
changes.
He did research on the effects of
the various medications he was taking
and, in consultation with his physician,
decided that laughter would best en
hance his body chemistry. He set up
a program in a hotel room, leaving
the hospital because laughter would
disturb staff and other patients (and
besides the hotel room cost only a
third as much as the hospital).
In the room he watched TV spoofs
popular in the 1960s called "Candid
Camera" ami old Marx Brothers films.
A nurse would read to him passages
from humor books (e.g.. Max Eastman's
"The Enjoyment of Laughter").
In a relatively short period of time
he literally laughed himself back to
health and all pain disappeared. He

returned to his Saturday Review
editorship, reported continuous health
improvement in subsequent months,
and widely circulated reports of his
experiences in both popular and med
ical publications.
This case history raises many issues.
As strict scientific evidence, the
Cousins case is minimal since it
represents only one person's experi
ence. In addition, the causal linkage
of laughing and specific physiological
effects is not clear-cut.
Further, the Cousins case touches
upon a very important theoretical and
practical issue — the "placebo effect"
— to which Cousins himself devotes
a chapter. The placebo effect occurs
when a patient recovers from illness
because of his belief that his treatment
will cure him, not because of the treat
ment itself.
Of course, a key issue in a discussion
of the effect of humor on health is
the physiological effects of laughtei.

The psychiatrist Dr. William Fry
Jr., an investigator of humor for three
decades, has described "mirth
associated pertubations in five major
systems of the human body: respira
tory, cardiovascular, muscular, en
docrine and central nervous systems.
The effects are most prominently of a
stimulatory nature. The period of stim
ulation is generally followed by a pe
riod of activity diminished below the
usual baseline for that function. The
effects are of varying magnitude, in
several instances coordinated with the
intensity of accompanying laughter."
In effect, emotional tension that con
tributes to stress is lowered through
the cathartic effects of laughing. It has
even been noted that during the time
when people are laughing, they are
not able to smoke or to eat unhealthy
foods. Further, laughter is antithetical
to feelings of anger, rage or even de
pression.
