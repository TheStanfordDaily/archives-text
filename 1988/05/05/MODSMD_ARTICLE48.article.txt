# Computer network offers health tips

Where can you get anonymous in
formation, 24 hours a day, about health
topics ranging from constipation to
gonorrhea, breast or testicular self
examinations to warts, dandruff to knee
injuries? If you are near a computer
terminal, the answer is Stanford
Health-Net.
Stanford Health-Net, available on
LOTS computers, is a health
promotion computer network created
by Cowell Student Health Center. The
network was designed to promote cost
and time-effective utilization of health
care services through education about
appropriate self-care and promotion of
healthful behaviors.
You don't have to be a computer
hacker to use Health-Net. The system
has been designed so even a novice
can use it without difficulty. Those
who have tried it in preliminary tests
have found it easy.
Health-Net is comprised of three
main components: "Self-Help Info," a
bulletin board and "News-Events-

Resources." News-Events-Resources
includes three sub-components: a
calendar of health-related events on
or near campus, news flashes on
medicine and public health, and
"Where to go for help," an information
and referral resource, including phone
numbers, for local health and social
service agencies.
The electronic bulletin board con
tains answers to health-related ques
tions asked by students in the past.
Self-Help-Info is the most popular
Health-Net component. It provides in
formation on more than 90 health
topics. The information is often ac
companied by optional, interactive al
gorithms leading users through a series
of questions about symptoms they may
be experiencing.
At the end of the algorithms, the
computers make recommendations
about whether to try a home treatment
or to seek help at Cowell.
Health-Net is intended to be used
only as an educational resource, how
ever. The network does not give med
ical advice. It gives only information
to help students make more informed
choices.
The system addresses common stu
dent problems — colds, headaches,
hayfever, diarrhea, swimmer's ear and
athlete's foot — as well as problems
that students might feel less comfort
able talking about — sexually trans
mitted disease (including a large
amount of information on AIDS), im
potence, gynecologic problems and
methods of birth control.
The network also provides informa
tion on local hotlines, counseling
centers, and places where specialized
products are available.
Stanford Health-Net was created
over the past four years by Stanford
medical student Tom Robinson and
Cowell Director Paul Walters Jr. with
the help of programmer Scott Grinis,
a recent Stanford graduate in Electri
cal Engineering, and several under
graduate research assistants.
Much of the development took place
with support from the Metropolitan

Life Foundation, which enabled a
large-scale evaluation of Health-Net.
The evaluation involved approximately
1000 Stanford undergraduate and grad
uate students.
Half of the students were randomly
assigned to have access to Stanford
Health-Net, and were mailed informa
tion on how to use the system. The
other half, which was not given access
to the program, received question
naires at the beginning and the end
of the four-month study.
The results were very promising.
Over a four-month period, the group
with access to Health-Net made 23
percent fewer health-care visits than
the group without access.
This difference was calculated in
cluding all members of the group that
was allowed access, not just those who
used the program. In fact, 26 percent
of the group with access used the
program during the four month study.
Those who used Health-Net logged
on an average of 6.4 times, although
the number of uses ranged from one
to 97.
These results should not discourage
students from visiting Cowell and
other health professionals. We hope
visits increase for some problems. We

only want students to feel more com
fortable taking care of their own minor
problems, and to be better informed
about their own health. The decrease
in visits may be the result of being
better informed.
The evaluation also measured the
number of hospitalizations to be sure
that increased self-care was not leading
to more complications. Although
hospitalization rates are not a perfect
assessment of complications, we did
not find any significant difference be

tween the two groups.
This finding is consistent with those
reported by investigators studying the
effects of self-care books.
Stanford Health-Net also represents
a potential vehicle for teaching stu
dents healthful behaviors. We are cur
rently working on interactive
components to teach healthy nutrition
and stress reduction. The nutrition
course should be ready later this quar
ter. Plans have also been made to
include a component on substance use.
