						guide to caring for your eyes

Vision is our most precious sense.
It is also one that requires the most
care and correction from qualified pro
fessionals. Millions of Americans re
quire some form of vision correction,
and about 18 million of them have
decided to use contact lenses instead
of glasses.
The majority of wearers find their
lenses safe, comfortable, and in some
ways, better than glasses for correcting
vision problems and fitting into an
active lifestyle.
Developments over the past few
years have made contact-lens wearing
possible for many more people. It re
quires commitment, but most people
say it's worth it.
Who can wear contact lenses?
The answer is: most people who
need vision correction. Contact lenses
can correct vision for nearsightedness,
farsightedness, stigmatism, presbyopia
(the need for bifocals), and can even
be worn by individuals who have had
cataract surgery.
Hard lenses
Years ago, when only hard lenses
were available, many people simply
could not get accustomed to wearing
a hard, plastic lens on their eye. Those
who were able to adapt to hard con
tacts, however, found they offered
many advantages over glasses.
Hard lenses don't have to be
changed with a new fashion trend, as
do opthalmic frames. Hard contacts
are the least expensive of all lenses,
and with reasonable care they will last
for years.
Today there are two types of hard
lenses — conventional and "gas
permeable." Gas permeable lenses
transmit more oxygen to the eye,
making them more comfortable and
easier to wear then conventional hard
lenses.
Both types of hard lenses give ex
cellent vision correction, and they re
quire the least amount of maintenance.
They won't slip off your nose, and
they offer better peripheral vision than
glasses. Improved appearance is, of
course, another big reason that people
prefer contacts over glasses.
Hard lenses do have drawbacks. In
addition to the difficulty of getting
used to them, dust can get caught
under them and be painful. Conven
tional hard lenses can deprive the eye
of needed oxygen, causing swelling
and discomfort. And, because of their
small size, they may periodically pop
out, limiting their value in sports ac
tivities. Conventional hard lenses must
also be removed before sleeping.
Soft lenses
Soft lenses come in two basic types:
those designed for daily wear and those
designed for extended wear. Because
soft lenses are made of somewhere
between 38 and 79 percent water, they

are more comfortable than hard lenses
and usually require a shorter break-in
period.
They are larger than hard lenses
and conform to the natural shape of
the eye. They fit more closely to the
eye and so are less likely to be dis
lodged, making them ideal for sports
activities. There is less chance of dust
getting under them, and they also give
excellent peripheral vision. Manufac
turers of soft lenses compare them to
a drop of Water in look, feel and ease
of adaptability for the user.
However, there are disadvantages.
Soft lenses can tear easily and often
don't last more than a year. The water
in them can breed bacteria and so
they need careful disinfecting, clean
ing and overnight soaking. All of this
maintenance requires a determined
commitment on the part of the wearer.
Despite the effort, most people think
it's worth it and would not go back to
wearing glasses full time. Manufac
turers are also doing their part to make
maintanence of soft contacts easier.
Extended-wear contacts
Of the 18 million Americans who
wear contacts, about five million of
them are extended-wear users. These
contacts are designed for round-the
clock use. Although the federal Food
and Drug Administration has approved
them for continuous wear "for up to
thirty days, according to the advice of
the eye care practitioner," most pro
fessionals now advise removal at least
once a week for cleaning and a night's
sleep without them.
These comfortable and popular
lenses can, however, pose a danger to
the eyesight of the careless user. Even
extended wear lenses must be properly
cleaned to prevent infection. They can
cause the cornea to swell. This can
lead to corneal ulcers as well as in
fection. If not treated within 24 hours,
such infections can lead to permanent
vision impairment and, in severe cases,
even blindness.

Symptoms to watch for include:
• redness, especially in one eye;
• sudden change in vision, particularly
blurring;
• pain, in or around the eye;
• excessive watering of the eyes.
Remember, when in doubt, leave
your lenses out.
Your eye-care professional
If you are considering contact lenses
— hard, soft or extended-wear — your
first step will be an examination by
an eye-care professional. He or she
can evaluate your particular needs and
prescribe the best corrective measures
for you.
Even if you do not require vision
correction, an eye examination can give
a professional warning of glaucoma,
cataracts, diabetes, high blood pressure
or arteriosclerosis. With early diag
nosis, theses conditions can often be
treated successfully.
Should you consider lenses, your
eye-care professional will decide if you
can wear them on the basis of the
health of your eyes, the vision correc
tion you need, and your individual
lifestyle.
If contacts are prescribed for you,
your eye-care professional should work
closely with you to see that you receive
careful and thorough instructions on
lens-wearing, cleaning, storing, disin
fecting and on any solutions or prod
ucts that might be necessary for their
proper maintanence. You will also be
instructed on how to handle your con
tact lenses. Because soft lenses are
similar to a drop of water, practice in
handling is important.
Safety first
There are certain safety measures
that must be followed to ensure the
continued comfortable wear of your
lenses.
• Always wash you hands thoroughly
before handling a lens
• Always clean hard lenses and disin

feet soft lenses after taking out.
• Follow the lens-care procedures
prescribed for you and read package
instructions before using solutions. Al
ways use fresh solutions when caring
for your lenses.
• Always work in a clean, well-lit
space. If you clean your lenses over
a sink, close the drain.
• Close your eyes when applying hair
spray. Liquids and vapors may be ab
sorbed by your lenses.
• Don't use soaps, detergents or
household chemicals on lenses or lens
care equipment.
• Don't rub your eyes vigorously. You
may dislodge the lenses.
• Don't wear lenses while swimming.
• Apply eye makeup carefully after ap
plying lenses. Don't use cosmetics in
side the eyelid or products that run
into the eye. There are now hypoaller
genic cosmetics on the market which
are specifically formulated for contact
lens wearers.
• Visit your eye-care professional on
a regular basis.
Warning signs
If any unexplained eye discomfort,
watering, vision change, or redness of
the eye occurs, remove your lenses
and sec your eye-care professional im
mediately. There are also times when
conditions outside of your control can
make wearing your lenses uncomfort
able. These include:
• climates with very low humidity,
windy days, airplane cabins or blow
dryers;
• television watching or working at a
computer terminal (this can dry out
your eyes);
• taking certain medications which
may cause dryness of the eyes;
• pregnancy or menstruation, which
can effect water balance in the body
and may result in dry eyes;
• exposure to smoke or other airborne
irritants or vapors;
• allergies or even allergic response
to the lenses themselves.
