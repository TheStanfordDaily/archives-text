# Students write to protest imprisonment of Czech

Jiri Wolf has been in a Czechoslovakian
prison for six years. He is separated from
his family. His health is failing. And he

will feature events ranging from a film on
Haitian jailings and oppression to a balloon
release in White Plaza.
In addition to recruiting people to write
letters to free Wolf, AI members will also
be circulating a petition that calls for his
release. The petition already has 200 signa
tures, according to sophomore John Chang,
chief organizer for the week.
In working with AI, "we're not just say
ing human rights is a groovy idea, we're
pointing our fingers at specific cases," said
Paul Atkins, a sophomore who heads the
AI movement on campus.
Atkins said AI members "write letters"
and put the prisoner's name in "huge cap
