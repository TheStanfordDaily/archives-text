# Students write to protest imprisonment of Czech
## 
### Leann Wiley 
Jiri Wolf has been in a Czechoslovakian
prison for six years. He is separated from
his family. His health is failing. And he
may have undergone torture during his
imprisonment.
His crime? Writing stories and articles
that his government considers subversive
— an action that would not even have
been considered unlawful in the United
States.
In an effort to secure his release, a group
of Stanford students, working with Am
nesty International chapters all over the
Bay Area, are writing letters to the Czech
oslovakian government protesting Wolfs
plight.
Amnesty International, which was
founded in 1961 and has members in 46
nations, seeks to release all prisoners who
have been jailed for peaceful protest against
their governments.
Wolfs is only one of many cases that AI
and students here have taken on in order
to pressure governments worldwide to stop
human rights violations.

With a Human Rights Awareness Week
starting Monday, students involved with
these letter-writing campaigns will try to
bolster their ranks by increasing campus
awareness about the work they do.
Sponsored by AI, which has had repre
sentatives on campus since 1970, the week
will feature events ranging from a film on
Haitian jailings and oppression to a balloon
release in White Plaza.
In addition to recruiting people to write
letters to free Wolf, AI members will also
be circulating a petition that calls for his
release. The petition already has 200 signa
tures, according to sophomore John Chang,
chief organizer for the week.
In working with AI, "we're not just say
ing human rights is a groovy idea, we're
pointing our fingers at specific cases," said
Paul Atkins, a sophomore who heads the
AI movement on campus.
Atkins said AI members "write letters"
and put the prisoner's name in "huge cap
ital letters (on the envelope) so when
(government officials! read them, they get
the picture." This way, even if
officials cannot read English, they
recognize the name and realize
that a large number of Americans
are aware of how that person is
being treated, he added.
The group also tries to publicize
the atrocities of governments they
target because "torture loves

closets," he said.
Chang said the main purpose
of next week's events is to show
people the faces and voices of po
litical prisoners — to bring their
struggles back to Stanford.
One of the short stories Wolf
wrote and was imprisoned for,
titled "I'm Fine, So Is Paco," will
be read next Thursday night at
Bechtel International Center. It
is an ironic description of life in
side a Czechoslovakian prison.
Although the group has concen

trated this year on Czechoslovakia
and Haiti, Chang emphasized that
human rights violations take
place in many countries. In next
week's events, Chang said AI
members would focus less on par
ticular countries than on world
wide issues.
Monday night's film on torture,
titled "Your Neighbor's Son,"
demonstrates how even normal
persons can become torturers if
they undergo torture.
