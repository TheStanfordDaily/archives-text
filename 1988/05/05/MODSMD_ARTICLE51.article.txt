# Fighting cholesterol and heart disease
## 
### Laura Brainin-Rodriguez, R.D., M.S.-M.P.H. Cowell Nutritionist 
Heart disease is the number-one
killer in the United States. The process
that leads to this grim statistic begins
early on in life. One of the factors
associated with heart disease is high
blood cholesterol.
This article will discuss blood
cholesterol, when to worry about it,
and what you can do about it.
Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like sub
stance. Three-quarters of the choles
terol in our bodies is manufactured by
our livers. The other quarter comes
from the food we eat.
Cholesterol is important to the body,
providing raw materials for steroid hor
mones, vitamin-D and cell membranes.
The substance is only found in foods
of animal origin. I laugh everytime I
see an advertisement for peanut butter
or oil which exclaims: "No Choles
terol." These foods never had choles
terol — it was removed courtesy of
the animal manufacturer.
Cholesterol in our blood is distrib
uted into particles called lipoproteins.
The amount of protein in these parti
cles determines their density. High
density lipoproteins, or HDL, have
more protein and less cholesterol than
low-density lipoproteins, or LDL.
LDL cholesterol goes from the liver
to the tissues. HDL cholesterol goes
from the tissues to the liver for excre
tion as bile acids.
The more your body's cholesterol
consists of the LDL variety, the higher
your risk of heart disease. An LDL
value of 140 or above, and an HDL
value of 40 or less, are causes for
concern.
To determine an individual's degree
of risk, health providers divide your
total cholesterol level by your HDL
cholesterol level. Ideally the result

should be a number equal to or less
than 3.5. In addition, for people under
age 30, we recommend a total choles
terol level of 200 or less.
Cholesterol cannot be oxidized by
exercising more or going on a diet.
The only way the body can get rid of
cholesterol is through bile acids. These
are made in the liver from cholesterol
that helps to break down the fats we
eat into small droplets so that they
can be digested.
While the jury is not in on whether
oral contraceptive agents (OCA) raise
blood cholesterol, we worry about
blood cholesterol levels in OCA-users.
OCA users run a three times higher
risk of heart attack than non-OCA
users when they are older than 35 and
smoke or at any age if they have a
pre-existing vascular disease such as

hypertension, diabetes or high blood
cholesterol.
Part of the concern is that OCAs
may raise a woman's blood pressure
and cause her blood to clot more readi
ly. Combined with a high blood choles
terol, this tendency greatly increases
the risk of heart disease.
Before you despair about your family
history of heart disease or your own
high level of blood cholesterol, there
are some things you should know about
how to reduce your blood cholesterol
and your risk of heart disease. Some
of these mean changing how you eat.
Others may require you to change
other habits.
It is still a matter of controversy
whether dietary cholesterol increases
blood cholesterol. When individuals
have been fed high levels in experi

ments, some have shown increases,
some decreases and some no change
in blood cholesterol levels.
What we do know is that people
who eat more cholesterol also eat more
total fat, more saturated fat, more ex
cess calories and less fiber. They also
tend to be more sendentary, have more
cars per capita and have a higher socio
economic level.
So eating more cholesterol appears
to be only part of the problem, and
therefore reducing dietary cholesterol
may only be part of the solution.
Saturated fats are hard at room tem
perature. Examples include butter,
lard, fat in dairy products such as
cream, cheese, vegetable shortening,
beef fat, chicken skin, coconuts, plam
oil and lunch meats like salami,
bologna and hot dogs. Reducing your
ifitake of these foods will help to
reduce your cholesterol level.
Eating fewer calories (if you are
eating more than you need and gaining
undesired weight), may also help. Eat
low-fat and non-fat yogurt, milk and
cottage cheese and pay attention to
cheese intake, limiting it to between
four and six ounces a week.
Intake of trans-fatty acids may also
increase blood cholesterol. These are
formed when oils arc artificially
hydrogenatcd to form a fat that can
be spread. Examples of these are mar
garine, vegetable shortening and any
product that is labeled "partially hard
ened" or "patially hydrogenatcd."
These fats are used in most com
mercially produced breads, muffins,
cookies, cakes, crackers and even some
peanut butters.
So how can you decrease blood
cholesterol? First, by decreasing your
total intake of fats. Overindulgence will

make you fat and increase your risk
of colon and breast cancer.
Second, you can replace saturated
fats in your diet with monosaturated
and polyunsaturated fats.
Monosaturated fats — such as those
found in olives and olive oil, avocados,
cashews and sesame seeds — are the
reasons for the low incidence of heart
disease in Spain, Italy and Greece.
Polyunsaturated fats include oils
such as corn, safilower, sunflower, wal
nut and soybean. From a health per
spective, they are all about the same.
They should be used sparingly and
kept refrigerated.
Another important source of polyun
saturated fat is fatty fish, which include
salmon, herring, mackeral, sardines,
trout, tuna and oysters. These have
been shown to decrease blood choles
terol. Studies have shown that people
who ate fish twice a week had, after
20 years, one-half the heart-disease
rate of people who ate it less often.
Try choosing fish when you eat out.
The fiber found in peas, beans,
fruits, vegetables and whole grains
decreases cholesterol.

and cause her blood to clot more readi
ly. Combined with a high blood choles
terol, this tendency greatly increases
the risk of heart disease.
Before you despair about your family
history of heart disease or your own
high level of blood cholesterol, there
are some things you should know about
how to reduce your blood cholesterol
and your risk of heart disease. Some
of these mean changing how you eat.
Others may require you to change
other habits.
It is still a matter of controversy
whether dietary cholesterol increases
blood cholesterol. When individuals
have been fed high levels in experi

ments, some have shown increases,
some decreases and some no change
in blood cholesterol levels.
What we do know is that people
who eat more cholesterol also eat more
total fat, more saturated fat, more ex
cess calories and less fiber. They also
tend to be more sendentary, have more
cars per capita and have a higher socio
economic level.
So eating more cholesterol appears
to be only part of the problem, and
therefore reducing dietary cholesterol
may only be part of the solution.
Saturated fats are hard at room tem
perature. Examples include butter,
lard, fat in dairy products such as
cream, cheese, vegetable shortening,
beef fat, chicken skin, coconuts, plam
oil and lunch meats like salami,
bologna and hot dogs. Reducing your
ifitake of these foods will help to
reduce your cholesterol level.
Eating fewer calories (if you are
eating more than you need and gaining
undesired weight), may also help. Eat
low-fat and non-fat yogurt, milk and
cottage cheese and pay attention to
cheese intake, limiting it to between
four and six ounces a week.
Intake of trans-fatty acids may also
increase blood cholesterol. These are
formed when oils arc artificially
hydrogenatcd to form a fat that can
be spread. Examples of these are mar
garine, vegetable shortening and any
product that is labeled "partially hard
ened" or "patially hydrogenatcd."
These fats are used in most com
mercially produced breads, muffins,
cookies, cakes, crackers and even some
peanut butters.
So how can you decrease blood
cholesterol? First, by decreasing your
total intake of fats. Overindulgence will

make you fat and increase your risk
of colon and breast cancer.
Second, you can replace saturated
fats in your diet with monosaturated
and polyunsaturated fats.
Monosaturated fats — such as those
found in olives and olive oil, avocados,
cashews and sesame seeds — are the
reasons for the low incidence of heart
disease in Spain, Italy and Greece.
Polyunsaturated fats include oils
such as corn, safilower, sunflower, wal
nut and soybean. From a health per
spective, they are all about the same.
They should be used sparingly and
kept refrigerated.
Another important source of polyun
saturated fat is fatty fish, which include
salmon, herring, mackeral, sardines,
trout, tuna and oysters. These have
been shown to decrease blood choles
terol. Studies have shown that people
who ate fish twice a week had, after
20 years, one-half the heart-disease
rate of people who ate it less often.
Try choosing fish when you eat out.
The fiber found in peas, beans,
fruits, vegetables and whole grains
decreases cholesterol.
Heart disease is the number-one
killer in the United States. The process
that leads to this grim statistic begins
early on in life. One of the factors
associated with heart disease is high
blood cholesterol.
This article will discuss blood
cholesterol, when to worry about it,
and what you can do about it.
Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like sub
stance. Three-quarters of the choles
terol in our bodies is manufactured by
our livers. The other quarter comes
from the food we eat.
Cholesterol is important to the body,
providing raw materials for steroid hor
mones, vitamin-D and cell membranes.
The substance is only found in foods
of animal origin. I laugh everytime I
see an advertisement for peanut butter
or oil which exclaims: "No Choles
terol." These foods never had choles
terol — it was removed courtesy of
the animal manufacturer.
Cholesterol in our blood is distrib
uted into particles called lipoproteins.
The amount of protein in these parti
cles determines their density. High
density lipoproteins, or HDL, have
more protein and less cholesterol than
low-density lipoproteins, or LDL.
LDL cholesterol goes from the liver
to the tissues. HDL cholesterol goes
from the tissues to the liver for excre
tion as bile acids.
The more your body's cholesterol
consists of the LDL variety, the higher
your risk of heart disease. An LDL
value of 140 or above, and an HDL
value of 40 or less, are causes for
concern.
To determine an individual's degree
of risk, health providers divide your
total cholesterol level by your HDL
cholesterol level. Ideally the result

should be a number equal to or less
than 3.5. In addition, for people under
age 30, we recommend a total choles
terol level of 200 or less.
Cholesterol cannot be oxidized by
exercising more or going on a diet.
The only way the body can get rid of
cholesterol is through bile acids. These
are made in the liver from cholesterol
that helps to break down the fats we
eat into small droplets so that they
can be digested.
While the jury is not in on whether
oral contraceptive agents (OCA) raise
blood cholesterol, we worry about
blood cholesterol levels in OCA-users.
OCA users run a three times higher
risk of heart attack than non-OCA
users when they are older than 35 and
smoke or at any age if they have a
pre-existing vascular disease such as

hypertension, diabetes or high blood
cholesterol.
Part of the concern is that OCAs
may raise a woman's blood pressure
and cause her blood to clot more readi
ly. Combined with a high blood choles
terol, this tendency greatly increases
