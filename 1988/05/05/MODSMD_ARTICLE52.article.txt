How are carbohydrates, fats and
proteins best distributed in a healthy
diet?
If you divide the food you eat each
day, the proportion of the total calories
from each macronutrient should be
roughly 55 percent from car
bohydrates, 15 percent from protein
and no more than 30 percent from fat.
These percentages are based on guide
lines for a daily diet established by
the American Heart Association, the
National Academy of Sciences and the
National Institute of Health.
Your diet will very likely be healthy
if you increase intake of complex car
bohydrates and avoid foods that are
high in fat and refined sugar.

Did you know that 60 percent of all
the fat you eat is hidden?
Foods contributing to high fat con
sumption are mostly those containing
hidden fat. For example, in bologna
the amount of calories from fat is high.
Of the total 170 calories in two slices,
139 come from fat. That's 82 percent
of the total calories from fat.
Both fat and cholesterol are essen
tial. However, the typical American
diet is too high in fat. Populations that
have diets low in fat also have lower
rates of heart disease and certain types
of cancers. Fatty and rich foods are
high in calories and offer little in the
way of nutrients. Saturated fats (found
in meat, cheese and other animal prod
ucts) are converted to cholesterol in
the body.

To control the amount of fat in your
diet:
• Use lemon juice or limit the amount
of dressing on your salad.
•Use skim (nonfat) milk, non-fat or
low-fat yogurt and low-fat cheeses.
• Reduce fried foods, gravies and
sauces.
• Limit intake of luncheon meats like
hot dogs, bologna, sausage and salami.
• Limit bakery goods and pastries.
Did you know that carbohydrates
(starchy foods) contain less than half
the calories per ounce of fats?
Fat has 225 calories per ounce, and
carbohydrates have 112 calories per
ounce. The best kind are complex car
bohydrates. These are found in beans.
