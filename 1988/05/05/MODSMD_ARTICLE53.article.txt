# Of summer, your skin and the sunshine
## 
### A. Christine Miller, M.D. Cowell Physician 
The sun, the blazing star of our
solar system, has been deified and wor
shipped for thousands of years. It al
lows life to exist on the planet, it
makes us feel good, some think it make
us look good, it can even treat disease.
But can one get too much of this good
thing? The answer is a most definite
yes. And as the sunny season arrives,
knowledge of how best to protect one's
skin from overexposure to the sun be
comes increasingly important.
Overexposure to the sun can result
in a variety of reactions: reactions that
occur from a single or a few episodes
of overexposure — so-called "acute"
reactions — and changes that occur
after many cumulative exposures —
"chronic" reactions.
The classic form of acute reaction
is sunburn — painful, red, swollen
skin occuring after a short term expo
sure on sun-exposed areas. There is
statistical evidence linking painful sun

burn to an increased risk of a serious
type of skin cancer called malignant
melanoma.
Chronic sun exposure results in a
constellation of skin changes called
dermatoheliosis. These changes in
clude irregular, freckle-like
discoloration of the skin, small dilated
blood vessels, thinning of the skin,
wrinkling of the skin, and a yellowish
leathery look. All of these changes
make the skin look prematurely aged,
and in fact, many of the changes we
usually associate with aging are due
to sun damage.
After more extensive sun damage,
rough pre-cancerous growths of the
skin called actinic heratoses can
develop. Chronic exposure can also
contribute to the development of skin
cancers including basal cell carcinoma,
squamous cell carcinoma and malig
nant melanoma. Although these can
usually be cured if discovered and
treated early, skin surgery is usually
required.
Many people mistakenly associate

these skin cancers with old age. As
more extensive sun exposure over
larger areas of the body has become
more commonplace in the last few
decades, it is certainly not rare for
physicians to see skin cancers in
patients in their 30s, and occassionally
in their 20s.
In addition to the acute and chronic
effects noted above, in some sensitive
people, sun exposures can lead to an
noying, itching, painful or unsightly
skin rashes called "photodermatitis.
This condition can be due to an allergic
mechanism or to interaction with
medications a person is taking.
Finally sun exposure can precipitate
a flare of disease in persons with cer
tain uncommon systemic disorders —
lupus erythematosis or porphyria, for
example.
The following is a list of sensible
guidelines for sun exposure.
• Don't sit out in the sun just to get
a tan. In particular, don't purposefully
tan your face; it's always exposed and
gets a lot of sun with everyday activ

ities. The person with the golden tan
today is going to look like a wrinkled
prune tomorrow!
• Wear sunscreen lotion on exposed
skin areas (face, neck, upper chest,
forearms, backs of hands) on a daily
basis during sunny summer months.
If you're fair, make sure your sunscreen
has an SFF (sun protection factor) of
15 or higher.
• When you re going to be out in the
sun for a prolonged period, wear a
sunscreen on all exposed skin, and
reapply it after swimming or if in
volved in activities where you perspire
a lot. Don't forget your lips.
• Wear protective clothing when out
in the sun. Wear a hat or visor to
shade your face and keep your shirt on.
• If possible, schedule outdoor activi
ties for early-morning or late-afternoon
hours when the sun is least direct.
• Don't be fooled by the claims of
sun-tan parlors. The ultraviolet
wavelengths one gets at these contrib
ute to many of the changes mentioned
above for natural sun exposure.
