## Getting the most from exercise 
### 
Pace yourself
You get the benefits of a workout by
exercising longer rather than harder
or faster. Exercise at an intensity that
you can maintain for an extended pe
riod of time. It is best to work out at
a slower pace for 20 continuous
minutes rather than to push too hard
for five minutes and not be able to
continue. Slow down when you need
to.
Know your limits
Stop exercising when:
• you are breathing very heavily and
your face feels flushed and hot. Keep
moving gently though; never stop an
aerobic activity abruptly.
• you experience a sharp pain in a
joint or muscle.
• if you feel excessive fatigue, faintness
or nausea. Slow down and join in again
when symptoms disappear. If pain or
discomfort persists, go to Cowell.
Warm up and cool down
Wanning up and cooling down will
help you avoid injury. (See article on
stretching.) Don't bounce while
stretching. Stretching should be
smooth and sustained.
Land smoothly

Never land flat-footed.
Drink water
Drink water before, during and after
your exercise session to avoid dehydra
tion.
What to wear
Athletic shoes are a must! Use shoes

appropriate to your activity (e.g.,
aerobic shoes for aerobic dance, run
ning shoes for jogging).
Wear non-restrictive, comfortable
clothes. Cotton fabrics are best.
Women should wear supportive bras
during each workout.
A word of caution

Do not eat a meal for two hours
before you exercise. You may experi
ence nausea and cramps otherwise. If
you are over age 35 and not accus
tomed to vigorous exercise, consult
with a physician before you start. If
you are pregnant, consult with your
physician to receive some guidelines
on exercise during pregnancy.
Target heart rate
Target heart rate is your personal guide
to physical fitness. Exercising at your
target heart rate increases your fitness
without causing extreme fatigue or
stress on body functions. During each
workout, take you pulse several times
to check if you are within your target
heart rate range. If you are above,
slow down, and if you are below, work
a little harder.
Exercising below your target heart
rate will not condition your cardiovas
cular system to its optimal level. Ex
ercising above your recommended
heart-rate range may be a level of
exercise intensity at which fatigue and
overwork occur. High-impact activi
ties, such as jogging and aerobic dance
can lead to musculoskeletal injury
when you exercise too intensely.
As you get in better shape, you will
be able to do more and stay within
your target zone because your heart,
lungs and muscles are more efficient.
Exercise Prescription
To obtain health benefits, exercise
at target heart rate three to five times
a week for 20 to 30 minutes each
session.
