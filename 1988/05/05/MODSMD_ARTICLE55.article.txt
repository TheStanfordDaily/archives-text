# Stretch out before working out

Stretching exercises make everyday
movement easier and can help you
prevent injury and soreness from your
exercise sessions.
Always begin your workout with
seven to 10 minutes of warm-up that
includes low-intensity activity and
stretching exercises, followed by some
rhythmic movements for two to five
minutes to prepare muscles and car
diovascular system for all-out use dur
ing the aerobic workout. This prelim
inary warm-up:
• gets fluids to the joints to keep them
lubricated to facilitate exercise;

• increases blood circulation to the
muscles;
• gets the cardiovascular system
warmed up;
• gets the body ready for vigorous ex
ercise.
Cooling down is also essential, and
you should never neglect it. It is im
portant that you cool down gradually
after a period of vigorous exercise.
Stopping exercise abruptly may trap
a large quantity of blood in your legs'
muscles. As a result, an insufficient
amount of blood circulates back to the
heart and brain, which may cause diz
ziness or faintncss.
So after the vigorous part of your
workout, slow down by brisk walking

or by swimming slowly for three to
five minutes and then stretch again
for five to 10 minutes. Doing so:
• gives the body a chance to recover
from vigorous exercise;
• stretches muscles that tighten during
aerobic activities;
• helps prevent soreness and cramping
by maintaining circulation to muscles
and thus aiding in the removal of waste
products.
To improve and sustain flexibility,
follow these guidelines:
• Stretching should be static. Never
bounce. Ballistic moves create a stretch
reflex response that causes the muscle
to contract forcefully, inhibiting
flexibility and making you prone to
injury.

• Stretching should be pain-free.
Stretch just to the point of tightness.
• Stretching should be smooth and sus
tained. Reach and hold" each stretc .
10 to 20 seconds. Don't hold your
breath.
Some days you may be "looser" than
others. Flexibility varies with time of
day, temperature and stress levels. Lis
ten to your body and don't overstretch.
Always remember that it is impor
tant to stretch before and after exer
cise. Most exercises involve the
repeated contraction of the muscles
used. Contraction is just the opposite
of stretching, so conscious attempts to
stretch are needed to maintain
flexibility.
