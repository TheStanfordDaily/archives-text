# What to do when you overdo it
## 
### Ana Kozlowski, M.A. Fitness Nutrition Specialist Tim Bowman Physical Therapist 
Physical activity is necessary for good
health. Exercising regularly has many
benefits, but unfortunately some
people are simply doing too much, too
fast, too soon, too often, with too little
supervision. As a result, they are get
ting injured and/or getting sick.
It's easy to be too enthusiastic about
exercise and end up exhausted at the
end of a workout. It is wisest to ex
ercise at a level that challenges your
system without overworking it.
Excessive exercise can make you
feel sick. Instead of boosting your en
ergy and enhancing your health, over
training may leave you feeling run
down. You may experience the follow
ing symptoms:
•restlessness,
•anxiety,
•lack of energy throughout the day,
•inability to sleep,
•weakness,
•more colds than usual, one after the
other,
•aches and pains all over.
It may be that for some people the
mile-long course they've been running
easily for the past month, suddenly
seems arduous. Some exercisers give
up because of it, and others continue,
only to get sick or injured. Some
people feel they are supposed to feel
that way. That's not true. It will go
away if they just cut back.
You should also take a look at your
diet and fluid intake if you experience
some of the symptoms described
above.
To get your muscles going, you need
the appropriate fuel. Muscles are
fueled by glucose, glycogen and fatty

acids, all of which are available in
your food. To enhance your energy
stores you need to consume enough
complex carbohydrates (fruits,
vegetables, breads, potatoes, pasta).
You should also consider that a large
percentage of your body is water. You
use it in your blood to carry nutrients
and oxygen, remove waste, and dis
sipate heat.
Yet, through sweating, your blood
volume can be slightly reduced. This
can adversely affect muscle efficiency.
If you are not well-hydrated, you can
develop a sense of weakness, fatigue
and fainting. Thirst is not a good in
dicator. By the time you are thirsty,
you are already slightly dehydrated.
So make sure you drink plenty of
water, before, during and after your
workouts.
Basically, overtraining is doing more
exercise than your body can adapt to.
If someone who has been sedentary
for years goes out and exercises for
30 minutes seven days a week, he or
she is overtraining. Overtraining is a
sure way to develop injuries like shin
splints, tendinitis and other bone and
muscle injuries.
Body tissues like muscles, tendons,
bones and joint surfaces respond to
the stresses of regular exercise by
building up and getting stronger. Thus,
over time, they are able to withstand
greater stresses. Overexercise will
cause these tissues to weaken and
break down because they haven't been
given enough rest to respond properly
to stress. You can cram for finals, but
not for fitness.
When over-stressed, tissues will
break down through micro-trauma, or
small tears, which causes pain and
inflamation. This also obviously
weakens the tissues and can lead to
more serious injuries. Micro-trauma is

often the origin of muscle strains, ten
donitis and stress fractures. If you try
to "exercise through" these tissue
breakdowns, you are risking macro
trauma, major tears and full-blown
fractures.
When experiencing early signs of
macro-trauma, you should avoid the
activities that stress that particular
tissue. The "BICE" treatment is
advised: Best, Ice (for 20-minute pe
riods throughout the day), Compres
sion (such as an Ace wrap or tape),
and elevation (raising that part of your
body above your heart) will help
reduce inflamation.
Once the tissue is healed, it needs
specific exercises and stretches to
build it back up and prepare it for the
stresses of renewed exercise. If you
do not take special care, the damaged
tissue will be your "weak link in the
chain" and be highly susceptible to
future injury.
When returning to exercise after
injury, you need to build back up
gradually. You can't jump back into it
at the same level of intensity.
Don't overuse equipment, such as
athletic shoes. Bunning shoes are good
for about 500 or 600 miles of running.
Also, run on level surfaces for a few
weeks before attempting the Dish.
Try staying in shape year-round and
condition yourself for upcoming
seasons, such as skiing. In other words,
try to be fit for life rather than be a
"weekend warrior."
Stay away from the "more is better"
approach. In exercise, more is better
up to a point. After that, it can be
bad. Moderate, regular exercise will
bring about greater long-term gains
than bursts of intense activity, which
may lead to injury or illness.

I low do you know if you are over
training? How do you avoid it?
Take your morning pulse (resting
heart rate) for a minute. If it starts to
creep up over the course of a few
weeks (an elevated pulse of five to 10
beats or more in the morning), slow
down. Regular aerobic exercise tends
to lower morning heart rate. But if
you overdo it, your cardiovascular sys
tem becomes fatigued, resulting in
higher morning pulse.
Both novices and longtime exer
cisers should work out a maximum of
six days a week. Everybody needs a
full day's rest.
A guideline for people of all levels
is to increase workouts by no more
than 10 percent a week. If you have
been running 10 miles a week and
want to do more, run 11 miles the
next week. Continue to build in 10
percent weekly increments, as long as
the workouts aren't leaving you unduly
tired or sore.
Listen to your body. Normal mus
cular soreness should go away with a
day of rest. It doesn't require aspirin
or. painkillers, involve joint swelling,
limit the motion of a joint, or interfere
with eating, working or sleeping. It
improves during exercise, instead of
hurting more. If your pain doesn't fit
that description, you probably have an
injury. Stop the exercise. Consult a
doctor.
The more days a week you exercise,
and the more intense your workouts
are, the more prone you are to get
injured.
No matter what your exercise, al
ternate hard and easy workouts the
way the pros do. You can also alternate
high-impact with low-impact activities,
like running or aerobics one day and
swimming or biking the next.
