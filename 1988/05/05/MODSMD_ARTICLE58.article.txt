# Can you change body composition?
## 
### 
Yes you can! But, regardless
of how drastically you might like
to change your body composition,
remember that only moderate
changes in your lifestyle will lead
to permanent body fat loss (or
gain). Diet pills, fad diets and
exercise gimmicks that claim to
make the process "quick and
easy" are not good ways to lose
body fat. They are not only dan
gerous but also ineffective be
cause the faster you drop those
pounds, the more likely you are
to put them right back on.
When your body fat
percentage is high:
Incorporating more aerobic ex
ercise into your lifestyle is the
best way to reduce your body's
fat content. Don't fool yourself
into believing fat can be melted
off by saunas, vibrating or elastic
belts, electric muscle stimulators,
rubber or plastic suits. Nor can

fat be dissolved by swallowing
pills or eating grapefruit.
The key to losing fat is com
bining aerobic exercise with a
low-fat, balanced diet. Obviously,
jogging isn't the only way to do
this. Brisk walking, swimming,
cycling, aerobic dancing or any
other aerobic exercise is just as
effective in reducing body fat.
Here's why exercise
is so effective:
• Your basal metabolic rate (the
rate at which the body normally
burns calories) increases with
regular exercise, which means
you use more calories in a resting
state than you would if you were
not an exerciser.
• As a result of an aerobic
workout, your metabolic rate may
stay elevated for up to 15 hours.
This means more calories are
being burned, even after you stop
exercising.

• The more you exercise, the
less fat and the more lean mass
(muscles) you carry on your body.
Fat is inactive tissue — it just
sits there. Muscle is active — it
burns calories all the time so
your metabolism increases as
your muscle mass increases.
Therefore, as you get in better
shape, you burn more calories
than before even when sitting
still.
• If you are dieting and not ex
ercising, the caloric restriction is
thought to produce a 15 to 30
percent decrease in your
metabolic rate. As a result, your

body will adjust to your lower
intake and will not burn as many
calories as before. A small in
crease in physical activity will
help counteract the decrease in
your metabolic rate caused by
caloric restriction.
There is no "magic formula."
The best approach for changing
your body composition is a com
bination of a low-fat, well
balanced diet (of no less than
1200 calories a day) high in com
plex carbohydrates and a regular
program of aerobic exercise.
