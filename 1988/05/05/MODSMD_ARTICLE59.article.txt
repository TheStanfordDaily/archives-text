# What to do about allergies
## Achoo, sniff, cough, wheeze 
### John Dorman, M. D Lou Shaw, R. N 
Eyes and ears itch? Tickle in your
throat? Has a tissue under your nose
become a permanent feature of your
face? Does this happen to you every
spring? If the answer to these ques
tions is yes, you're probably experi
encing hayfever, a seasonal respiratory
allergy to pollens from flowers, trees,
grasses or molds.
Since an allergy is hypersensitivity
to a specific substance, the best treat
ment is avoidance of the substance.
This is not always possible, however.
So what else can you do?
Antihistamines (Chlortrimeton,
Dimetane, etc.). These medications act
by preventing or decreasing nasal dis
charge and itching. Antihistamines
vary in both effectiveness and side
effects. They may cause sleepiness in
some individuals, and should not be
taken with sedatives or alcohol. Most
non-prescription medication can be
purchased inexpensively as a generic
brand.
Seldane is a new prescription an
tihistamine that that does not cause
drowsiness. It is modestly expensive,
however.
Antihistamines are often used in
combination with decongestants,
which will help shrink swollen nasal
membranes. Actifed, Drixoral and

Dimetapp are three such combination
drugs. Both antihistamines and decon
gestants can be used long-term if you
do not develop side-effects.
Preventive nasal sprays. These in
clude cortisone and cromolyn sprays,
both of which require a prescription
and are preventive only. These nasal
sprays are not for acute relief (unlike
Afrin, which provides acute relief for
two or three days only). Although they
are useful as treatment for individuals
who are not helped by antihistamines,
they are more expensive. Examples
include Nasalcrom, Nasilide and Van
cenase.
Allergy shots. After extensive skin
testing, offending allergens can be
made into an antigen, which is given
by injection in increasing doses at reg
ular intervals. This process will help
desensitize the individual to the of
fending allergens. Success is variable,
and it often takes months or even years
for results. The entire procedure is
also very expensive and should only
be undertaken if other methods have
proved ineffective.
Allergies are not easy to live with
â€” nor is the fact that there isn't any
cure. However, we can at least take
joy in the visual beauty of our sur
roundings here in California as we
sneeze and sniff our way through the
spring!
