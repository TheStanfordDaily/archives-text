### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
An unidentified youth who has re
portedly exposed himself, stolen money
and physically harassed female students
in two campus residences is the subject
of a current Stanford Police investiga
tion.
The suspect has been involved in at
least three incidents in the past two
weeks. The most recent incident in
volved a female student in Yo3t House
at about 1:45 a.m. Monday. The male
suspect entered her unlocked room
while she slept; the student then woke
and screamed after seeing the intruder.
The suspect, who allegedly stole her car
keys and $20, was then seen by another
resident fleeing the house.

A previous incident led to violence,
according to Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer. On April 30, the youth re
portedly became physical with a female
student in the Elliott Guest Suite West.
After his physical advances, he exposed
himself to the woman. According to the
victim, he first wanted her to smoke
marijuana with her. Niemeyer said she
"became assertive" and he left the room.
The same student said she was ap
proached by the suspect April 24. He
asked for directions to the room of an
other student in the house, and then
engaged in a conversation with the
woman.
The suspect is described as a Latino
youth, about 130 pounds, with collar
length, black curly hair. Victims esti

mate he is 15 or 16 years old and stands
five feet, four inches tall. Those who
conversed with him also said he has a
heavy accent.
The police warn all campus residents
to lock their doors and windows and to
pass on any information that could help
identify the man. Niemeyer said there
is no composite drawing of the youth
because the police are still collecting
information about the cases.
According to reports, the number of
transients seen on campus traditionally
escalates during spring quarter.
Niemeyer warned that many are "not
mentally stable."
The police are also quick to point out
that incidents are not limited to one
area of campus.
