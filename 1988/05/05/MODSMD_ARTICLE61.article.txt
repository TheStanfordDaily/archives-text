# Therapy: Is talking for you?

impossible to write, to read or even
to have fun. "Who am I" may lead to
"I don't know,"and then drinking al
cohol or smoking marijuana or trying
the latest designer drug may be an
easy but dangerous solution to tense
uncertainty.
A few years ago, the state of Cali

Psychotherapy — the healing of the
mind, the "talking cure" — is a concept
that many find difficult to imagine.
And yet, we all know that relationships
and intimacy are supportive, gratifying,
and can help us to be our best.
The years between ages 18 and 28
are fraught with great change as we
move away from the all-too-familiar to
the challenges and opportunities of the
unknown. The questions are many:
Who am I? What do I want to spend
my life thinking about? What matters
most? Do my values make any sense?
What does a relationship mean to me.
What does it mean about me?
In the background, looming large
for some, are inner voices: What is
the matter with you? Why can't you
perform better? You are a disappoint
ment? No, you must not study that
— you will never get a good job. What
will they think of me? You are ugly!
You are a pervert! You are bad! Can
I get close? What will they expect?
Sometimes the questions become
confusing. It may be increasingly dif
ficult to concentrate. Feelings of
sadness may overwhelm, leading to
withdrawal, tears and thoughts of
death.
At other times, the voices of doom
lead to fear and anxiety. It becomes

"friends are good medicine." Perhaps
simplistic, the message was based on
the scientific fact that social support
and relationships can help forestall
life's pains.
Psychotherapy or counseling is a dif
ferent kind of relationship — one in
which you can say whatever comes to
mind without concern that the other
person will be upset or hurt.

This processs brings with it a free
dom — an ability to be more open
and straightforward, both with yourself
and with the counselor, than perhaps
you may have ever been.
At the same time, feelings emerge
that are the baggage of the past —
feelings and thoughts that have made
themselves known in the voices of
self-deprecation. As you and the coun

selor begin to understand how these
ghosts have constrained your choices,
new options become available.
But does it help? For most, the
answer is most definitely yes. Late
adolescence and early adulthood is
such a fluid time that tragedies of one
moment can quickly turn to treasures
of the next. For the vast majority of
problems, talking to a counselor for

just a few weeks makes all the differ
ence. For others — those who are
prisoners of their emaciated bodies,
or live from drink to drink, or run
from partner to partner in defiance of
the life-threatening risk such exposure
brings — for them, it takes longer.
Even then, however, much is possible;
people can change-
So why see a therapist? Because at
this time in your life, you do not want
to be stuck, because in addition to
extending your knowledge about the
world, the college years may be an
opportunity to learn more about your
self. As a Stanford woman wrote about
her group counseling experience:
"But the path was a long one. It
got worse before it got better. The
messages and patterns that each of us
had built up over the years could not
be erased only by thinking change.
We had a lot of pain around other
issues, most of all, our relations with
parents and siblings, for which food
had become a detour. We had to un
derstand our essential selves very well
before we could change."
About 1500 Stanford students camc
to Counseling and Psychological Serv
ices last year. They sought assistance
for a variety of problems ranging from
depression to procrastination to sexual
dysfunction. The counseling relation
ship offers students a unique oppor
tunity to sort things out — sometimes,
you just can't do it alone.
