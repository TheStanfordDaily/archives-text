# Staying healthy around the world
## 
### 
Are you planning to travel overseas
this summer? Hopefully you have not
forgotten to review your immunization
records in your excitement. Diseases
such as malaria, typhoid fever and
hepatitis are realities in many parts of
the world where health standards are
not as high as in Europe, Canada or
the United States.
Malaria is an especially serious dis
ease that affects millions of people
worldwide, even in areas visited by
tourists. Effective medication for the
prevention of malaria is available, but
you will need to consult with the
Cowell Immunization Clinic in order
to determine the proper dosage and
type of medication, since malaria con
ditions vary from region to region.

You also need to consider other im
munizations, some of which may be
required depending on your destina
tion. Even if you plan to limit your
trip to the capitals and major cities of
Europe, you should be up to date on
measles, rubella and tetanus im
munizations.
The time to start is now. Some im
munizations are given in series a
month apart or must be spaced apart
to avoid reactions. Please come in as
soon as you know your travel itinerary.
Cowell Immunization Clinic is open
9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. every Tuesday
and Friday.
