# SHARE Committee: Working for you

Horror stories about Cowell are as
much a part of student culture at Stan
ford as Big Game and Food Service.
Few students have not heard about
someone's visit to Cowell Hell, where
he waited two agonizing hours before
seeing a cranky, curmudgeon of a
nurse, who after but a cursory glance
at his throat, told him to go home and
rest.
Fact or fiction, these are the stories
that the Student Health Advisory
Review and Evaluation Committee
wants to hear and address. A funda
mental objective of the SHARE Com
mittee is to assist Cowell in providing
the best possible health care service
to the student population.
We want to reverse Cowell's nega
tive reputation and make the health
center a more attractive and acceptable
place for students to seek medical care
and advice.
A survey conducted last year by the
SHARE Committee showed that stu
dent dissatisfaction was not nearly as
widespread as anticipated. However,
some students had legitimate com
plaints. It is these that seem to have
caused fear among students.

SHARE members are available to
field comments (good or bad) in person
at the SHARE Booth in White Plaza,
every Thursday from 11 a.m. until 1:30
p.m.
Each SHARE Committee member,
in addition to providing feedback to
student concerns, works on specific
projects aimed at improving Cowell.
For example, in response to the lack
of adequate dental and vision care
services at Cowell, several SHARE
members initiated student discount
programs with dentists and op
thamologists in the the Stanford area.
Lists of participating doctors are avail
able at the Cowell front desk.
Similarly, many students have com
plained that care for the common cold
has been depressingly minimal, point
ing out that a fact sheet on colds is
hardly worth the trip to Cowell.
Beginning this quarter, the SHARE
Committee has opened a cold clinic
staffed by a nurse and one or two
student volunteers. While the cold
clinic does not promise a cure, cold
sufferers can get free, over-the-counter
medications for symptomatic relief.
One SHARE member, who is help
ing Cowell reach out to students who
are not sure if they need medical as
sistance, is currently integrating

artificial-intelligence techniques used
in medical expert systems with knowl
edge about symptom profiles and
symptom relief medications.
When the Health-Net computer sys
tem is finished (see page 1), users will
be able to get a recommendation for
over-the-counter cold medications that
best suit their needs. If symptoms sug
gest a more serious infection (other
than the common cold), then Health-
Net will advise an immediate visit to
Cowell for professional attention. This
management system is intended to
complement existing Health-Net in
formation on cold-related topics.
Another SHARE member designed
and constructed a bulletin board with
photographs and information about
Cowell staff members. Currently dis
played in the main lobby, the bulletin
board allows students to get to know
their practitioners on a more personal
level.
Other projects in progress include
writing an updated brochure detailing
the services available at Cowell and a
dorm outreach program. Several mem
bers also participate in staff commit
tees within Cowell.
Recently, SHARE has become ac
tive in student health at the intercol
legiate level. In February, one SHARE

member represented Stanford at a
regional student-health conference in
San Diego, and last month, five com
mittee members spent a week meeting
with leading figures in student health
at the annual American College Health
Association conference in Denver.
The SHARE Committee was
developed under the guidance of Lou
Shaw, a registered nurse at Cowell,
who was concerned about the lack of
student input at the health center.
Seeking to overturn Cowell's negative
image among students, she and senior
Mary Thurber, committee chair and
former Council of Presidents member,
began recruiting in late 1986 for the
current group of 12 students.
SHARE members are a diverse
group of undergraduate and graduate
students in a wide variety of academic
disciplines, including biology, human
biology, history, philosophy, business
and computer science. What they have
in common, however, is commitment
to work toward improving health care
services and to contribute to a better
student life at Stanford.
SHARE is currently accepting ap
plications for membership during the
1988-89 school year. If you are inter
ested in becoming a part of the com
mittee, call Lou Shaw at 723-4841.
