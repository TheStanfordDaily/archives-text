# Crisis causes rationing
## Water shortage forces Stanford to cut back 
### Angie Kim Staff writer 
Stanford has begun water
rationing and will have to drasti
cally cut back on its water usage
by July 1, 1988 because of the
threat of a Northern California
drought, according to Cheryl Jen
sen, manager of Mechanical
Utilities.
Because of the imposition of
water rationing by the San Fran
cisco Public Utilities Council,
which declared the water situa
tion a "crisis," Stanford has
turned off the water to all public
fountains and will be reducing
landscape irrigation by 50 per
cent.
Stanford must reduce its total
water usage by 29 percent as part
of a broader reduction program
that is designed to cut total water
usage in the Bay Area by 25 per
cent.
The next two months will be a
"trial period" when Stanford will
attempt to meet the 29 percent

cutback by making people aware
of the gravity of the problem and
getting them to cooperate with
water conservation measures.
According to Jensen, more
"drastic" measures will have to
be adopted if students do not
cooperate fully with conservation
measures. Allowing water usage
only at certain times or turning
off selected drinking fountains
would be possibilities, she said.
Mechanical Utilities, in con
junction with Housing Energy
Conservation Center and Housing
Management will publicize the
water crisis in student residences
on campus to encourage students
to save water.
More programs and publica
tions will be put on by Housing
Management, according to Kath
leen O'Connor, the Housing En
ergy Conservation Center pro
gram coordinator.
According to Jensen, students
will be encouraged to take "a little
inconvenient but unharmful v
measures of water conservation,

such as taking military showers,
turn -ig off ti.e r while brush
ing teeth, ,md doing full loads of
laundry. Taking military showers
is a method of conserving water
by shutting off the shower except
when it is iceded to rinse one's
body.
"A normal shower uses up
twenty-five gallons of water*
whereas a military shower uses
up on 1 ; four ,villous, and running
the water while brushing teeth
uses up ten gallons, while turning
it off uses up only a half a gallon,"
Jensen said. "That's a tremen
dous amount of difference for just
a little bit of inconvenience."

Tourists on campus marvel at the Claw in White Plaza. The fountain has no water as a result of water
rationing recently implemented on campus.
