House approves anti-drug plan
WASHINGTON — The House, seized by
election-year enthusiasm for anti-drug legisla
tion, voted overwhelmingly yesterday to re
quire the armed forces to halt illegal drug
trafficking into the United States.
The measure, authored by Rep. Duncan
Hunter, R-Calif., gives President Reagan only
45 days "to substantially halt the unlawful
penetration of the United States borders by
aircraft and vessels carrying narcotics."
It also requires the Pentagon to begin con
tinuous aerial radar coverage of the nation's
southern border. It would amend a Civil War
era statute known as the Posse Comitatus
Act, which prohibits the military from enforc
ing civilian laws.
The measure was approved by a vote of
385-23 as an amendment to the $299.5 billion
defense spending bill for fiscal 1989.
Although the House-passed amendment is
certain to be weakened or stripped from the
defense bill before it finally clears Congress,
the extreme nature of the amendment and
the overwhelming vote reflect the growing
frustration that most lawmakers feel in dealing
with the flow of drugs into the United States.
It also demonstrates the political sensitivity
of the drug issue as the November election
approaches.
"The problem is that our southern borders
are just a sieve of cocaine and heroin coming
over unchallenged every night," said Rep. John
Davis, R-111. "We want to bring the front lines
into this battle against this poison coming
across our borders."
Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., said that the
vote marked the end of a defeatist, "Vietnam
type mentality toward the war on drugs" in
Congress. He predicted that Congress could
be persuaded to accept the use of the military
to combat drug trafficking across the nation's
southern borders.
Soviets give up 3 Afghan posts
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Soviet units Wed
nesday handed over three security posts to
Afghan troops, the rebel Afghan Islamic Press
agency reported.
Up to 200 Soviet soldiers were manning the
posts, located on the edge of Jalalabad in east
ern Afghanistan, close to the Pakistan border,
the agency said.
Western diplomats in Pakistan believe that
Jalalabad will be the first Afghan city to fall
to the anti-communist mujaheddin guerrillas
after an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops start
withdrawing from Afghanistan later this
month.
An Afghan traveler from Kabul was quoted
by the agency as saying that the mujaheddin
were in control of the Jalalabad-Kabul highway
at Mahiper after ambushing an Afghan army
convoy Wednesday. Five Afghan soldiers were
killed in the fight, the traveler said.
