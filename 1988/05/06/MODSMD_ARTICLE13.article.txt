# Polish military uses force to end unrest

### 
GDANSK, Poland â€” Paramilitary
riot squads stormed striking steel
workers in southern Poland yesterday,
and a heavy police cordon was thrown
around the strikebound Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk as Polish author
ities opted for force to end a wave of
labor unrest.
Solidarity leader Walesa held
out inside the locked shipyard gates
with fewer than 1,000 of the striking
workers. He vowed that he would "stay
to the end" despite mounting indica
tions that the government was
prepared to eject the strikers by force,
as it had hours earlier at the nation's
largest steel mill at Nowa Huta.
"They can kill me," Walesa said,
"but they cannot overcome me."
Hundreds of riot police were posi
tioned in the vicinity of the shipyard,
the birthplace of the outlawed
Solidarity trade union, where workers
have been on strike since Monday.

At the same time, the government
said that its pre-dawn raid to end the
10-day-old strike at the Lenin steel
works near Krakow was carried out
because the work stoppage threatened
"the fundamental interests of the so
ciety and the national economy."
Government press representative
Jerzy Urban said "the whole thing
took place without a bruise." But op
position figures who said that they
witnessed the raid asserted that anti
terrorist police units used concussion
grenades, tear gas and truncheons
against the strikers, some of whom
were said to be asleep when the assault
began.
Tadeusz Zaleski, a priest who was
with the strikers, said that some of
them were bleeding from beatings in
flicted by the police, and some were
forced, on their knees, to sign pledges
that they would return to work.
The government declared the strike

officially over and the plant ready for
normal operations beginning with the
morning shift. It said that 38 strikers
had been arrested, including 13 of the
15-member strike committee. But op
position sources said that four mem
bers of the strike committee had
eluded arrest.
Almost simultaneously, announce
ments were broadcast to workers in
the shipyard declaring that operations
there had been suspended.
The blow against the strikers came
within hours of a warning issued by
Urban, who accused union activists of
"terrorist actions."
"These wildcat strikes have
degenerated," he said, "and, I am
warning, may result in serious conse
quences."
Yesterday, Urban described the raid
as "a normal restoring of order when
the law was being violated." He called
the use of force inevitable and added:

"The majority wanted to work, and a
minority (wanted) to strike."
Solidarity activist Adam Michnik,
released yeaterday after two days of
detention in Gdansk, described the
government's use of force as "the last
nail in the coffin" of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, the head of Poland's Com
munist Party.
"This is another attempt at solving
social conflict and economic crisis
through force and police," Michnik
said. "It is the most stupid thing the
authorities could do."
News of the raid reached the strik
ing Solidarity activists at the Lenin
Shipyard quickly and with what ap
peared to be a dispiriting effect. Be
ginning at 2:30 a.m., recorded an
nouncements on the shipyard's public
address system told strikers that op
erations had been suspended indefi
nitely.
