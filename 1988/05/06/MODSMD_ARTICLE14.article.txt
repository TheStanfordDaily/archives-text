# Major fire damages L.A.'s tallest building
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES - Fire ex
ploded on two floors of the 62-
story First Interstate Bank late
Wednesday night, spreading into
a ring of flame that encircled all
four sides of the city's tallest
structure.
Flaming debris from shattering
windows rained down on down
town streets as rescue helicopters
plucked late-night workers from
the roof of the building. Fire Chief
Donald Manning said that the
building had no sprinkler systems
and fire crews were attacking the
raging blaze from the inside of
the structure.
There were no official reports
of fatalities or injuries, although
bystanders reported seeing some
who escaped the building being
taken away in ambulances. In ad
dition there was an unconfirmed
report of people trapped in an
elevator.
One fireman broke off an in
terview, saying that he had to
help someone with a burn. An
other fire official said that at least
23 people suffered smoke inhala
tion.
At least eight people were
rescued from the building's roof
by helicopters in the first hour
after the blaze was discovered.
More than 120 firefighters from
at least 36 engine companies were
rushed in to fight the flames in
the bank building.
Firefighters were attacking the
blaze by climbing up stairs from
the first floor and climbing down
from the roof, one fire official

said.
Flames were first reported at
10:37 p.m. by maintenance crews
working in the building, fire offi
cials said, and within a half-hour
raged to a height of 20 feet.
Black smoke billowed 30 to 40
stories above the bank, obscuring
the view of rescue helicopters that
shone their spotlights into build
ing offices.
Fire officials said the blaze was
centered on the building's 12th
and 13th floors.
Zora Imamovich of Glendale, a
foreman for a cleaning company,
was on the 58th floor when she
heard about the fire on her
walkie-talkie.
"We started going down the
stairs and smoke started going
up," she said. "So we turned and
went up."
On her walkie-talkie, she said
she heard a group of people on
an elevator who identified them
selves as "Car 33," screaming:
"We are on fire! We are dying!"
Neither police nor fire officials
could confirm whether anyone
was trapped in elevators.
Joan Sampson of Los Angeles
watched the flames from the
street below along with hundreds
of others drawn by the commotion
from nearby restaurants and bars.
One firefighter, who did not
pause to give his name said that
melting electrical wiring, insula
tion and internal building sup
ports were making it particularly
difficult to battle the blaze.
