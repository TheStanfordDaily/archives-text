# Scandal hits Justice Dept.
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Justice De
partment said yesterday it is investigat
ing several department officials for pos
sible perjury arising from their involve
ment in the case of Inslaw Inc., a
Washington-area computer software
company. A judge ruled last fall the
department had tried to force the com
pany out of business.
Justice Department press representa
tive John Russell confirmed the inves
tigation, but declined to identify the of
ficials.
In addition, the Associated Press re
ported yesterday that the Justice De
partment's public integrity section has
heard allegations that Attorney General
Edwin Meese 111 may have had a role
in the ouster of an attorney who was
working for Inslaw. But a high-ranking
Justice Department official said last
night that Meese was not being inves
tigated.
Sources also said yesterday that the
tangled Inslaw case is the subject of a
probe by the Senate's permanent sub
committee on investigations, chaired by
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
Nunn's committee is said to be con
ducting a wide-ranging investigation
that focuses on a number of allegations
made by Inslaw and lawyers that rep
resent the firm.
Among them is a contention by Inslaw
founders William and Nancy Hamilton
that the Justice Department tried to
drive Inslaw out of business so that a
New York businessman could buy the
company's assets and then sell its
software to the department.
Inslaw, which has been operating un
der Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy
code for more than three years, devel
oped a computer software program for

the Justice Department that is used by
U.S. attorneys' offices to track cases.
Inslaw has alleged that it was forced
into bankruptcy because of a vendetta
against it by Justice Department offi
cials, one of whom was fired by the
company a decade ago.
The Justice Department has repeat
edly denied that it tried to drive the
company out of business.
But last September, U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge George Francis Bason Jr. ruled
that the department had used "trickery,
fraud, and deceit" to steal the rights to
Inslaw's product, and that Justice De
partment officials had tried to force In
slaw to liquidate.
Bason awarded the company $6.8 mil
lion in damages, plus legal expenses.
The department is appealing the deci
sion.
Earlier this year, Bason's term on the
bankruptcy bench was not renewed, and
he has suggested that he was forced to
step down because of his decisions in
the Inslaw case.
The Associated Press reported yester
day that the Justice Department's public
integrity section has heard allegations
against Meese made by the Hamiltons.
Inslaw has alleged that one of its
lawyers, Leigh Ratiner, was fired from
the Washington law firm of Dickstein,
Shapiro and Morin in 1986 after Meese
talked with one of the firm's partners,
Leonard Garment.
According to the Associated Press,
Garment has called the charges "pure
baloney," but confirmed that he was
interviewed by Justice Department
lawyers about the allegation two months
ago. Garment could not be reached for
comment last night.
