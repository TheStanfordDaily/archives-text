## Restore Segal statue 
### 
THE SYMBOL of tolerance
and acceptance of alternative
sexual orientations at Stan
ford should not be an empty bench.
But for the last eight months,
that's all those looking for "Gay
Liberation," an innocuous bronze
sculpture by George Segal, have
found.
The University has been insensi
tive by not communicating with
the community about the statue's
absence, particularly gay and les
bian groups that understandably
consider "Gay Liberation" an im
portant symbolic rallying point.
Even beyond the statue's political
significance, it is a work of public
art and ought to be displayed.
Another serious issue is the
question of why the professor in
charge of the statue stated that it
had been repaired when in fact it
has not. Stanford has an honor
code which should not be treated
lightly. Some argue that not
publicizing vandalism is the best
way to deter it, but that logic
should not encompass lying.
The University claims to have
legitimate reasons for delaying the
return of the sculpture, including
upcoming construction under the
site. But by keeping those reasons
secret, the University appears to
be yielding to homophobic van
dalism.
The University should once
again strongly affirm that it will
not tolerate homophobia, espe
cially in the form of hate-motivated
violence. President Kennedy's
speech to the freshmen last fall
made that point, as does the Uni

versity's non-discrimination policy,
but the continued cooperation of
the University is necessary if ho
mophobia is to be eradicated here.
The University should publicly
account for the statue's progress
from last August until now and
release a timetable for when it will
be repaired and reinstated. It
should establish a permanent
mechanism for better communica
tion with the gay and lesbian com
munity. And until the statue can
be returned to its permanent lo
cation, it should either be installed
in an alternate one or a com
memorative plaque should be in
stalled at the site.
Today at noon people will gather
around that empty bench to rally
for gay and lesbian rights. The
statue's absence is symbolic of
other deficits cited by the gay and
lesbian community: lack of com
munication between the Univer
sity and the various gay and les
bian student groups; lack of en
forcement of the University non
discrimination policy at the Career
Planning and Placement Center;
lack of community center status
and paid officers or staff for the
overworked Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance; and lack of any administrator
specifically entrusted with gay and
lesbian interests, such as ethnic
minorities have.
Today's rally was originally in
tended as a celebration to welcome
the return of the statue, and its
aim is still to foster communica
tion. The University should listen
to the views that are aired and be
responsive.
