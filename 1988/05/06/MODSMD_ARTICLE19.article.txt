## Death penalty unacceptable when guilt not certain 
### 
JUST BEFORE spring break Willie
Darden was executed by the state
of Florida. The crime was cer
tainly deserving of the death penalty.
The perpetrator accosted a couple, shot
the husband in the head, then forced
the wife to perform oral sex while her
husband lay dying a few feet away.
There are some crimes that are so
heinous that society, to protect itself,
must never let the perpetrators return
to its midst. In such cases I do not see
how society has an obligation to shell
out $10,000 to $50,000 a year to house
these criminals. It is the criminals who
choose their acts. If they must be
removed from society permanently the
death sentence is justified.
But Darden went to his death main
taining his innocence and lawyers from

Amnesty International agreed that
there were reasons to doubt his guilt.
There was an alibi that had not been
duly considered and prosecutors were
charged with the use of questionable
tactics. If we are going to execute
somebody we have to be sure he is
guilty.
The death penalty is irreversible. An
especially stringent measure of
reasonable doubt should be required
before a death sentence can be im
posed. The degree of doubt when the
sentence is irreversible must be less
than when sentence can be changed.
At present, applicability of the death
penalty is determined by the presence
of aggravating and mitigating circum
stances when a crime is committed.
The certainty of guilt is not among

these criteria. This is a flaw.
Juries should be asked in capital
cases to hand down two rulings:
whether they find the accused guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt, and
whether they find him guilty beyond
any doubt that is not a product of
radical skepticism.
When the extra measure of guilt is
not found, aggravating and mitigating
circumstances might be considered in
determining the severity of the sen
tence, but the death penalty would be
ruled out. When the extra measure of
certainty is found the court would go
on to weigh aggravating and mitigating
circumstances to determine whether
the death penalty should apply, as is
done now.
The system could also be streamlined

by having the judge weigh the ag
gravating and mitigating circumstances
himself, without the help of a jury,
whose constitutionally mandated func
tion is to determine guilt, not punish
ment. Automatic appeal (review) of
sentencing should be retained.
If certainty was required before the
death penalty could be imposed society
might be less reluctant about the
death penalty and be willing to apply
it to more crimes. I could favor that.
Yet even for the most horrible
crimes, if the irreversibility of the
death penalty is not compensated for
by an extra measure of certainty of
guilt, execution must be an unaccepta
ble punishment.
