After presenting his report on affirm
ative action to the Faculty Senate yes
terday, Provost James Rosse said the
shortcomings in the University's faculty
hiring program are "fairly evident."
Rosse': report on affirmative action
shows only small increases in minority
and women faculty over the past 16
years. Minority faculty members com
prised 3.7 percent of the total faculty
in 1971-72, while they make up 7.7
percent today. The percentage of women
faculty members rose from 5.3 percent
to 10.2 percent over the same time pe-
While these figures do show some
progress, they also cover a large time
span during which the University has
been actively working to recruit minor
ities and women.
Rosse said the University has made
"relative achievements" by upping the
number of minority faculty members,
but he agreed with other faculty mem
bers that the University's affirmative
action program is not living up to ex-

pectations.
Rosse acknowledged
that external factors
have accounted for part
of Stanford's inability
to recruit more minor
ity and women faculty
members. The shortage
of minority and women
faculty candidates is a
"major problem," he

But Medical Microbiology Prof. Leon
Rosenberg blamed the University itself,
calling its affirmative action program
"a sociological experiment that is
failing."
Rosse concurred, adding that future
University reports are expected to crit
ically examine the current affirmative
action program.
According to the affirmative action
report, 'appointments to Stanford's fac
ulty require evidence of a nationwide
(and often worldwide) search for the
best available person fulfilling the needs
of the open position."
However, Asst. Sociology Prof. Henry
Walker said department heads some

times use covert hiring procedures when
they have a specific professor they wish
to recruit.
Walker, who is not a faculty senate
member, said departments sometimes
recruit specific people without going
through normal competitive hiring
channels. Department heads often
create new positions or receive permis
sion from the Provost's office to bypass
search procedures.
It often happens that when these
"subterranean" hiring procedures are
used, Walker said, other potential fac
ulty candidates are not even made aware
of the opening. Potential faculty candi
dates are excluded from the hiring proc
ess and are not allowed to compete for
Walker *anl this covert hiring process
often works against minorities and
women, and gave two examples of non
competitive hiring in the Sociology De
partment. Both examples concerned
white males recruited and hired without
a nation-wide search or competition.

One of these hirings occurred
within the past year, he said.
"If this was Ford (Motor Co.)
or Hewlett-Packard (Corp.), there
would be litigation going on over
these covert hiring procedures,"
Walker said.
"In my opinion, these non-com
petitive procedures are illegal, un
ethical and immoral," he added.
"It would make some people feel
better if minorities and women
were recruited using these covert
procedures, but not me," Walker
said.
Walker said the University
doesn't need special programs; it
just needs a fair hiring policy with
no loopholes.
