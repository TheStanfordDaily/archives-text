# Construction blocks Mirrielees parking
## 
### 
I'm writing to you concerning the
outrageous parking situation that
exists at Mirrielees House right now.
The number of parking spaces avail
able for Mirrielees residents has been
significantly reduced due to ongoing
construction work. The construction
crew has roped off whole rows of
parking spaces in order to insert new
underground pipes. As a result, I fre
quently find myself struggling to find
parking, especially late at night. The
parking lot was overflowing before the
construction even began.
This is why I felt so angry after
receiving a parking ticket a few nights
ago. I was cited for having parked in a
space "undesignated" for student use.
Under the circumstances, I felt my
action was justified. After all, what are
you supposed to do when you come
home late at night and find every

single one of the "designated" spaces
full! Of course, I could have gone
across the street and parked in the
Wilbur Hall lot, but I don't have the
right type of permit. Either way I
would undoubtedly have received a
citation from one of the hardworking
Stanford sheriffs who are always on
the lookout for illegally parked cars or
illegally ridden bicycles.
I feel that the whole Stanford
parking system needs to be re
examined when innocent students are
forced to buy parking permits for their
cars and then get ticketed in the lot
that they have paid to park in. I basi
cally received a ticket due to the
shortage of parking in the Mirrielees
lot. Why would I park in an illegal
space if there were other legal spaces
available? Also, who created this
shortage of parking? The University.
To make matters worse, I found that
the regulating body that controls
parking at Stanford, the Stanford
police, were totally insensitive and
unreceptive to my complaints. The

sergeant in charge simply refused to
speak with me.
With all the land that the University
owns, I don't think parking needs to
be a problem here. Don't students
have enough concerns and sources of
stress without having to deal with this
nonsense?
