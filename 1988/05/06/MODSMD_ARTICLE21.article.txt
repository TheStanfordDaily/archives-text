# Daily overlooks 2 feminist speakers
## 
### 
Well, I'm beginning to believe all the
jokes about the Daily and its pitifully
boring content. In fact, it seems other
people are also wondering how the
Daily chooses the stories it covers. I'm
thinking specifically of Brian Lee's
April 29 letter complaining about how
the Daily somehow "forgot" to cover
the Stanford Community Carnival. I
agree with his sentiments and I'd like
to add a few of my own.

I find it hard to believe that the
Daily could have somehow overlooked
two very important and interesting
speakers that Stanford hosted on April
26 and April 28. Both these speakers
are very prominent activists in the
national feminist movement. It seems
that the Daily is much more interested
in the delegation of research funds,
SDI and horse barns than feminist
issues.
On April 26, Irene Natividad, the
chairperson of the National Women's
Political Caucus and opening speaker
for the New York Democratic Presiden
tial Debate, spoke at Kresge. And on
April 28, one of the most controversial,
radical and dynamic feminist lawyers
in this country, Catherine MacKinnon,
spoke on "Do Women Have Constitu
tional Rights?" at the Law School. The
room was packed. She was fantastic!
Not surprisingly, the event was ad
vertised in the Daily itself. Where were
you? \
