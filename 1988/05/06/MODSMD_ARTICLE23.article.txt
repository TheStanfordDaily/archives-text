## Bad call on ump bump 
### 
PETE ROSE by any other name
would still smell like Aqua Velva.
But National League President A.
Bartlett Giamatti, even if he had a real
name, would still emerge from his deci
sion Monday — to suspend Rose for 30
days — smelling like used food. So would
His Royal Incompetence, umpire Dave
Pallone.
Six days ago the New York Mets were
in Cincinnati. 'Twas the top of the ninth,
two gone, score tied at five apiece, with
the Mets' Howard Johnson on second.
Mookie Wilson grounded to Reds
shortstop Barry Larkin, whose throw
may or may not have pulled first baseman
Nick Esasky off the bag. But first-base
umpire Dave Pallone delayed making a
call as HoJo raced home with the winning
run. When Johnson crossed the plate
several seconds later, Pallone finally got
around to fanning his arms fitfully: Safe!
His Incompetence immediately found
Reds manager Pete Rose one and one-half
inches from his face presenting Respon
sible Opposing Viewpoints. Nobody cared
so much whether Wilson was out or not;
the problem was the late, late call.
In the course of this pleasant chitchat,
Pallone jabbed Rose in the cheek with
his index finger. Rose responded by
propelling the much bigger Pallone about
five feet backwards.
The Aqua Velva Man was ejected, of
course — nobody may thump the ump,
ever, no matter how meekly.
Fans began showering the field with
debris to show what they thought of Pal
lone's punctual callmaking. Down rained
the beer cups, beer, popcorn, toilet paper,
ice, saliva, profanity, and the occasional
transistor radio. The game was delayed

for 14 minutes while all four umpires
took a powder, hoping the crowd would
settle down (or run out of ammunition)
soon enough.
But the crowd kept right on pelting,
so Pallone finally took senior umpire
John Kibler's advice and left for his own
safety.
The Reds lost the game, 6-5.
Monday morning A. Bartlett Giamatti
slapped Charlie Hustle with a 30-day
suspension. Thirty days. That's the
longest suspension ever for a manager
for an on-field altercation.
If you consider that past "altercations"
have treated umpires to spikings, slap
pings, gang-tacklings, and good old
fashioned punchings, then A. Bartlett's
month-long suspension of Rose for push
ing an umpire who hit him first seems
preposterous. It is.
This curious man named A. even flew
Reds radio announcers Marty Bren
naman and Joe Nuxhall to New York to
publicly chew them out for their on-the
air Pallone criticism, which ostensibly
fanned the fans' flames. (When a roll of
toilet paper landed near His Incom
petence during the debris deluge, Bren
naman mentioned "how appropriate" the
salute was.)
Strange. This whole time I thought we
were living in the U.S. of A., where people
have a right to express their opinions.
Brennaman and Nuxhall apologized to
the world at large after their little session
with little Bart. They said Bart didn't
"browbeat" them into apologizing, and
that all Bart wanted was to talk to them
briefly to ensure that such a deplorable
exercise of their First Amendment rights
would never occur again.

Bull, 1 say. If that's all Bart wanted,
he would've used the telephone.
Who's really at fault here?
Pallone is at fault. Had he made that
call immediately, there'd have been no
hooliganism at Riverfront Stadium. Ditto
if he would have just walked away from
Rose and not joined right in the scream
fest. Bart should've given Pallone an in
voluntary three-day leave to think things
over.
Rose, Brennaman, and Nuxhall are at
fault. But certainly no more so than the
first-base umpire. Bart should've given
Rose a week's unpaid vacation, tops.
(Even that is more than what longtime
Reds shortstop Dave Concepcion got for
spitting in an ump's face a few years
back.) And a curt phone call would've
taken care of . the radio duo.
Most of all, A. Bartlett Giamatti is at
fault choosing a quick overreaction to
the Riverfront Rampage over a carefully
considered response. When all is said and
done, this guy's still just a former pres
ident of Yale who likes writing poetry —
not exactly league president qualifica
tions. It's time for Giamatti to get out
of baseball and into the literary tea circles
where he belongs.
Bartlett, suspend thyself.

that all Bart wanted was to talk to them
briefly to ensure that such a deplorable
exercise of their First Amendment rights
would never occur again.

Bull, 1 say. If that's all Bart wanted,
he would've used the telephone.
Who's really at fault here?
Pallone is at fault. Had he made that
call immediately, there'd have been no
hooliganism at Riverfront Stadium. Ditto
if he would have just walked away from
Rose and not joined right in the scream
fest. Bart should've given Pallone an in
voluntary three-day leave to think things
over.
Rose, Brennaman, and Nuxhall are at
fault. But certainly no more so than the
first-base umpire. Bart should've given
Rose a week's unpaid vacation, tops.
(Even that is more than what longtime
Reds shortstop Dave Concepcion got for
spitting in an ump's face a few years
back.) And a curt phone call would've
taken care of . the radio duo.
Most of all, A. Bartlett Giamatti is at
fault choosing a quick overreaction to
the Riverfront Rampage over a carefully
considered response. When all is said and
done, this guy's still just a former pres
ident of Yale who likes writing poetry —
not exactly league president qualifica
tions. It's time for Giamatti to get out
of baseball and into the literary tea circles
where he belongs.
Bartlett, suspend thyself.
