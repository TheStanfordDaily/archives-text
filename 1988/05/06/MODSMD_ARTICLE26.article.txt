## Student writes smash play 
### Kristen Lee 
When Howie Pollack, engineer
and theater technician, proposed
writing a play as his senior honors
project, the Drama Department
was skeptical — to say the least.
His initial proposals were sum
marily denied.
"I'm not afraid to do almost
anything," Pollack said. "But the
department didn't feel that way."
Pollack said the department
turned down his request because
it disagreed with him over "what
we thought honors was supposed
be. The department saw it as a
culmination of three years of
study. I wanted something to
motivate me to go beyond my
studies," he said.
After months of lobbying, Pol
lack finally convinced the depart
ment to sponsor his project.
This spring Pollack became the
first undergraduate at the Uni
versity to write and produce a
play for the Drama Department.
His play, "A Taste of Murder,"
ran from April 27 to May 1, and
three of its four performances
were sold out.
Although Pollack is not a drama
he is no stranger to Stan
ford dramatic productions: he has
held positions such as technical
director and lighting designer for
twenty campus shows.
Rather than receiving honors
in playwrighting, he will be
awarded honors in production for
coordinating the "non-artistic" el
ements of "A Taste of Murder,"
Pollack said.
Nevertheless, Pollack said his
most demanding task was not
producing the play, but writing
it. Pollack began the script the
summer before his junior year and
finished revising it this spring.
"I've always loved to write, but
it's still difficult," Pollack said.
When he started writing he had
no conception of how much work
it would require.
"I'd close my eyes, picture the
scene, (and think) 'I know these
people.' I'd listen to what they

said. Subsequently, in the first
draft they all ended up sounding
like me," he said.
Determined to create believable
characters, Pollack "work
shopped" the play for a month
before printing the final draft.
This involved having the cast im
provise on each scene, offering
suggestions and adding life to the
typed words while Pollack listened
and revised.
"It was almost as if I had a
hand writing the play," said
James Assey, who played the
grandfather.
After the workshop sessions,
Pollack referred to the play as a
"collective group project." "Just
call me if there are any problems"
seemed to be his motto, Assey
said.
Although the idea of working
under the playwright's piercing
gaze caused some nervousness in
the cast, Pollack's relaxed attitude
— "if people say to me when they
leave, 'I had a good time,' then

it's a success" — dispelled it
quickly.
"For me, it has been terrific
working with him because he
gives me a lot of freedom," said
Reid Edelman, director of "Taste"
and recent Stanford graduate.
Edelman said Pollack offered
criticisms and suggestions
throughout rehearsals, but was
also receptive to new ideas from
the cast.
"You would never guess how
much he's done because he's al
ways really happy, enthusiastic
and ready to do anything to help
me. During the workshopping
process he was very flexible and
worked well with the actors," said
Anne Kaufman, the play's stage
manager.
Pollack's enthusiasm has ex
tended not only to his theater
projects, but also to the Kenpo
Karate club, Sigma Phi Epsilon
Fraternity and the computer sci
ence courses he teaches.
But drama has taken up most

of his time, not only due to his
love of theater, but also because
he enjoys helping other people.
"He's been in the department
for a long time and, even if he
has a billion things to do, he al
ways helps out," said Claudia
Orensein, who assisted Pollack in
revising the script.
Pollack himself says he is "too
nice," and ends up taking on a
great many responsibilities at
once.
"I like to see other people hap
py, and if it's not going to kill
me, I'll say 'yes,' " he said rue
fully.
Pollack also expects people to
say yes to him. His mtyor, like
his honors project, is self
designed. Persuading his advisors
to approve it was not easy.
"I pestered [Industrial Engi
neering Prof. Jim Adams] for
three weeks before he agreed to
sponsor me," Pollack said.
His major, "New Technology
Engineering," was designed to
aquaint him with "forefront tech
nology." Rather than preparing
him for a technical career, it has
led Pollack to law school, where
he intends to concentrate on pat
ent and copyright law, thus syn
thesizing his dramatic and tech
nical experience.
"Real, live engineers don't do
what I wanted to do. Being the
person I am, I wanted to have a
little more control over what I'm
going to do," he said.
Pollack may not have used his
experience as a computer science
teaching assistant to write
"Taste," but Edelman said Pol
lack's experience as lighting and
set designer gave him one of his
major strengths as a playwright.
"He (Pollack) is able to really
conceptualize the world of a play
and the storyline as a unit. He's
created in his mind the complete
story," Edelman said. "He's gone
beyond the limits of the paper
and has created a whole world."
In Pollack's own words: "For a
person with an analytical mind,
I have an overactive imagination."
