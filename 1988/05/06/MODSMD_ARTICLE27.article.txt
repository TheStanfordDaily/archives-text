## Weekend event brings fun, food 
### Arija Bareikis 
Anyone interested in perus
ing a plethora of hand-crafted
goods, tempting their taste
buds or having their handwrit
ing analyzed should be sure to
explore the 16th annual Stan
ford Spring Faire hosted by the
Bridge in White Plaza today,
tomorrow and Sunday.
Each day from 10 a.m. until
6 p.m. the Faire will feature a
variety of foods and services
along with music and enter
tainment from the Stanford
Band, the Stanford Court Jug
glers, singing groups, a stilt
walker and others. Faire Coor
dinator Greg Bail, a senior,
added, "We're also raffling off
specially donated prizes this
year."
According to Bail, he invited
over 150 vendors to the fair,
which is more than in years
past. In order to be invited, all
vendors must go through an
application process in which
they are judged for the origin
ality of their work. In fact,
many of them come from all
over the country just to sell
their products at the Faire.
Once accepted, vendors must
pay a $50 booth space fee each
day, which is donated to the
Bridge — the peer counseling
center at Stanford. Bail noted
that the Faire is the "sole
source of funding for the
Bridge."
"Organizing the Spring Faire
has been a lot of work," said
Bail. "It's been a very time con
suming job ... a marketing,
public relations, management
job all in one."
He predicts the labor will pay
off this weekend, saying, "I
think it's going to be the best

Spring Faire ever.
"The Faire is a chance for
the Stanford community and
the outside community to
'bridge,'" he said, just as the
Bridge helps students connect
to Stanford life.
Begun in 1971, the Bridge
was originally a "halfway house
for people coming down from
drugs," Bail said. Today, the
organization serves as a gen
eral outreach center for advice
on anything from relationships
to substance abuse.
Just as the counseling serv
ice works to raise students'
spirits, the Stanford Spring
Faire promises to satisfy de
sires of the craving palette, the
avid shopper, and the seeker
of entertainment.
