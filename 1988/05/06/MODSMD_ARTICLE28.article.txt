"Casual Sex"
AMC Old Mill Six
San Antonio Central
Mountain View
Have a few drinks and go see
"Casual Sex" with a friend some
time. It's an odd, silly and sur
prisingly honest movie by
Genevieve Walter, about love and
sex in the AIDS scourged 1980s.
It has a weird quicksilver charm
that is ultimately impossible to
resist, though there are scenes
here so inane you want to groan.
The story is predictably light: two
young women go to a Club Med
type spa where they meet various
desirable and undesirable men,
and the comedy is spun from this.
Stacy (Lea Thompson) is sexy
and flirtatious; Melissa (Victoria
Jackson) is shy and repressed.
The movie is done in a funky,
easy style — the two women often
talk directly into the camera,
about their romantic lives, their
hopes and fears. Both actresses
are appealing, though at times
Jackson's nasal whine can be
grating, and Thompson is pain
fully cute.
Unquestionably this film is
messy and jumbled — a lot of it
is nothing more than screwball
sex comedy. But a few of the
scenes are sad, touching, and ex
ceptionally truthful, which is a
suprise in a "dumb" movie.
"Casual Sex" has been

marketed "dumb" (look at the
title!) and seems to want to be
flighty, but it keeps getting smart
in spite of itself. So many
"serious" films fail at the brutal
honesty that this flimsy movie al
most inadvertently seems to
stumble upon.
However, as soon as we've seen
a truthful or painful scene here,
the tone abruptly shifts and we're
back on the old breakneck laugh
track, bombarded with corny
jokes. This can be disorienting,
disturbing — the film can't make
up its mind what it wants to do.
The movie knows where we
hurt. In one scene Melissa makes
out with a man on the beach and
he can't "perform," so he gets up,
dresses, tells her he's "not at
tracted" to her, and leaves. This
is played off as comedy, but when
Melissa lQoks into the camera and
says to us, "I wish you hadn't
seen that," it cuts through the
comedy.
Scenes of Stacy unable to break
up with a boyfriend who drives
her crazy seem frighteningly real.
The loneliness of the characters
doesn't drown in the comedy.
The humor in this movie is a
mixture of silly gags and a mock
ery of our society: fitness freaks,
condoms, artistic types...some of
it's funny, some of it isn't. But
it's always quick, always colorful.
There are a lot of trashy movies
out there — and this has a tras

hier title than most. But "Casual
Sex" is actually quite funny and
on-target, though inconsistently
so. Go see this movie for a few
laughs, and you might be sur
prised at how much else you come
away with.

"Critters 2: The Main Course"

"Critters 2: The Main Course"
opened to the delight of parents
teaching their children table man
ners.
A few of the original folks came
back for the seconds but probably
left in search of some Pepto-
Dismal.
The same day"The Main
Course" opened the original "Crit
ters" movie played on TV stations
everywhere.
The humurous furballs with
teeth from two years ago are back;
so are the bounty hunters and a
few harried town folk. What isn't
back is the humor. The first crit
ter movie was really funny. The
second...well they billed it as a
comedy.
Grover's Bend, Kansas (with
beautiful mountains in the back
ground?) is taken over by a litter
of newly hatched Krites. They too
are leftovers from the first critter
movie.

The eggs hatch just in time for
Easter. The young Krites are very
hungry and begin munching on
just about everything. All the
while they mumble to themselves,
sounding very much like a cross

between G rover and the Cookie
Monster from Sesame Street.
The subtitled translations from
the first movie are humorous
counterpoints that illuminated
the character of the critters. In

"Critters 2" there isn't a subtitle
until half way through the movie
and it isn't even funny.
The critters' dinner manners
are probably based on the culinary
habits of the Cookie Monster. The
cookie monster, though, reeks
decorum and manners compared
to the little Krites.
I guess some allowances need
to be made for the intended au
dience. The rating of PG-13 sets
it off as a munchkin exploitation
film. And the Playboy centerfold
shots are aimed at the 13-year
old. Close-ups of breasts expand
ing and bursting through leather
bindings are not for the mature.
The rest of "the Main Course"
consists of low-brow shots of crit
ters being stepped on, run over,
shot and exploded while they
gorge themselves on messy
foodstuffs. The critters eat one
dog, several cows, a sheriff, a
junkman, an alien bounty hunter,
several random townspeople and
anything else that gets too close.
The munchkins in the audience
cheer as the furballs rampage
through salad bars in greasy
spoon fast-food joints. They giggle
and laugh while people are turned
to messy skeletons. To their credit
they enjoyed themselves just as
much when the critters are
turned into glogs of green slime.

"Two Moon Junction"
Century Almaden
Blossom Hill/Almaden
San Jose
"Two Moon Junction" is a
movie trying desperately hard to
be sexy. Just look at the ad for
it: a picture of an ecstatic woman
embracing a bulky, half-naked
man. The caption reads, "Into her
perfect world comes a perfect
stranger — and suddenly . . .
nothing is perfect anymore."
After an asinine promotion like
that you can only expect a movie
as glossy and empty as this one,
so drained of all real feeling that
you watch perplexed and
stupefied, never moved or excited
though there's plenty of sex and
plenty of "action." Everything
seems to go on under several
inches of glass — it feels removed,
unreal.

The story could have been
plucked out of any trashy
romance novel. The "heroine"
April (Sherilyn Fenn), is the
oldest daughter in a rich, genteel
Southern family. She's beautiful
and princess-like, or so we are
supposed to believe.
Oddly, she has a trampy look
even in the classy outfits the film
makers dress her in — her hair
and skin looked bleached out,
Debbie Harry/ Madonna style. She
doesn't look believably upper
class.
April is about to marry a young,
local rich boy she obviously isn't
hot for — he isn't the brawny
masculine type she craves. Yet,
we know she has some heavy lust,
because very early on she is filmed
showering (we get plenty of nice
shots of her breasts).
She peeks through a missing
tile in the shower at some men
showering next door — the sight
of their nude wet bodies makes
her sink to the shower floor in
some sexual trance, steam billow
ing around her face and breasts.
She meets Perry (Richard

Tyson) at a carnival. He's a brute
with a beefed-up torso, and he
treats her with (sexy?) disrespect.
He comes to her enormous house
and seduces her in one long, un
erotic scene.
They go on to have several very
satisfying (she weeps!) sessions
together— and here's the conflict:
April is drawn to Perry's sensual
lower-class life, but she can't go
back on her responsibilities to her
family.
Will she run off with Perry and
have good raunchy sex, or will
she marry the guy she isn't hot
for and eternally squirm with un
satisfied desire? That's the central
issue in "Two Moon Junction."
It's a dumb question; this is a
dumb movie.
Junky films can be fun if the
actors are exciting, the dialogue
witty, the sex mildly sexy, but
this movie has nothing to redeem
itself. If it isn't porno in fact, it's
porno at heart.
The lame story seems to have
been written only to explain the
sex scenes, which aren't even very
interesting. The characters are all

shallow and they go at each other
with the humorless, exaggerated
passion that always seems faked.
This is like a porn movie without
the all-out sexual display— it will
satisfy no one.

"The 20th International Tournee
of Animation"
Varsity
456 University Avenue
Palo Alto
"The 20th International Tour

nee of Animation" bills itself as
a collection of the best animated
cartoons from all over the world.
And they're right; it is simply
amazing. No review can capture
the uniqueness of this diverse col
lection of 20-odd animated short
films.
The cartoons range from the
cute to the bizarre, from the
ridiculously funny to the morbid.
Some of them even manage to
combine the two. For example,
"Snookles," a three- minute teaser
that left the audience in stitches,

starts off as a cutesy skit about
a baby fire-breathing dragon and
a baby bird trying to make beau
tiful music together. It ends in
farcical tragedy, however, when
the dragon makes the mistake of
singing too hard . . . and . . . well
you get the picture.
Other skits manage to reflect
real-life situations with a unique
candor and wit in a way that no
other medium can. That's what
makes the "Tournee" so particu
larly appealing — the latent
whimsical, unrestrained creativity
that lashes out to the audience
from the screen.
You see such a vast repertoire
of techniques — claymation, stop
segment films, the latest in com
puter graphics — that just flashes
by in short, powerful snippets.
The humor of most of the skits
smacks of the best of Gary Lar
son's "The Far Side." The humor
in the "Tournee" shares that
same twisted sparkle.
If you're interested in an eve
ning of good, light-hearted fun,
see the "Tournee."

"Casual Sex"
AMC Old Mill Six
San Antonio Central
Mountain View
Have a few drinks and go see
"Casual Sex" with a friend some
time. It's an odd, silly and sur
prisingly honest movie by
Genevieve Walter, about love and
sex in the AIDS scourged 1980s.
It has a weird quicksilver charm
that is ultimately impossible to
resist, though there are scenes
here so inane you want to groan.
The story is predictably light: two
young women go to a Club Med
type spa where they meet various
desirable and undesirable men,
and the comedy is spun from this.
Stacy (Lea Thompson) is sexy
and flirtatious; Melissa (Victoria
Jackson) is shy and repressed.
The movie is done in a funky,
easy style — the two women often
talk directly into the camera,
about their romantic lives, their
hopes and fears. Both actresses
are appealing, though at times
Jackson's nasal whine can be
grating, and Thompson is pain
fully cute.
Unquestionably this film is
messy and jumbled — a lot of it
is nothing more than screwball
sex comedy. But a few of the
scenes are sad, touching, and ex
ceptionally truthful, which is a
suprise in a "dumb" movie.
"Casual Sex" has been

marketed "dumb" (look at the
title!) and seems to want to be
flighty, but it keeps getting smart
in spite of itself. So many
"serious" films fail at the brutal
honesty that this flimsy movie al
most inadvertently seems to
stumble upon.
However, as soon as we've seen
a truthful or painful scene here,
the tone abruptly shifts and we're
back on the old breakneck laugh
track, bombarded with corny
jokes. This can be disorienting,
disturbing — the film can't make
up its mind what it wants to do.
The movie knows where we
hurt. In one scene Melissa makes
out with a man on the beach and
he can't "perform," so he gets up,
dresses, tells her he's "not at
tracted" to her, and leaves. This
is played off as comedy, but when
Melissa lQoks into the camera and
says to us, "I wish you hadn't
seen that," it cuts through the
comedy.
Scenes of Stacy unable to break
up with a boyfriend who drives
her crazy seem frighteningly real.
The loneliness of the characters
doesn't drown in the comedy.
The humor in this movie is a
mixture of silly gags and a mock
ery of our society: fitness freaks,
condoms, artistic types...some of
it's funny, some of it isn't. But
it's always quick, always colorful.
There are a lot of trashy movies
out there — and this has a tras

hier title than most. But "Casual
Sex" is actually quite funny and
on-target, though inconsistently
so. Go see this movie for a few
laughs, and you might be sur
prised at how much else you come
away with.

"Critters 2: The Main Course"

"Critters 2: The Main Course"
opened to the delight of parents
teaching their children table man
ners.
A few of the original folks came
back for the seconds but probably
left in search of some Pepto-
Dismal.
The same day"The Main
Course" opened the original "Crit
ters" movie played on TV stations
everywhere.
The humurous furballs with
teeth from two years ago are back;
so are the bounty hunters and a
few harried town folk. What isn't
back is the humor. The first crit
ter movie was really funny. The
second...well they billed it as a
comedy.
Grover's Bend, Kansas (with
beautiful mountains in the back
ground?) is taken over by a litter
of newly hatched Krites. They too
are leftovers from the first critter
movie.

The eggs hatch just in time for
Easter. The young Krites are very
hungry and begin munching on
just about everything. All the
while they mumble to themselves,
sounding very much like a cross

between G rover and the Cookie
Monster from Sesame Street.
The subtitled translations from
the first movie are humorous
counterpoints that illuminated
the character of the critters. In

"Critters 2" there isn't a subtitle
until half way through the movie
and it isn't even funny.
The critters' dinner manners
are probably based on the culinary
habits of the Cookie Monster. The
cookie monster, though, reeks
decorum and manners compared
to the little Krites.
I guess some allowances need
to be made for the intended au
dience. The rating of PG-13 sets
it off as a munchkin exploitation
film. And the Playboy centerfold
shots are aimed at the 13-year
old. Close-ups of breasts expand
ing and bursting through leather
bindings are not for the mature.
The rest of "the Main Course"
consists of low-brow shots of crit
ters being stepped on, run over,
shot and exploded while they
gorge themselves on messy
foodstuffs. The critters eat one
dog, several cows, a sheriff, a
junkman, an alien bounty hunter,
several random townspeople and
anything else that gets too close.
The munchkins in the audience
cheer as the furballs rampage
through salad bars in greasy
spoon fast-food joints. They giggle
and laugh while people are turned
to messy skeletons. To their credit
they enjoyed themselves just as
much when the critters are
turned into glogs of green slime.

"Two Moon Junction"
Century Almaden
Blossom Hill/Almaden
San Jose
"Two Moon Junction" is a
movie trying desperately hard to
be sexy. Just look at the ad for
it: a picture of an ecstatic woman
embracing a bulky, half-naked
man. The caption reads, "Into her
perfect world comes a perfect
stranger — and suddenly . . .
nothing is perfect anymore."
After an asinine promotion like
that you can only expect a movie
as glossy and empty as this one,
so drained of all real feeling that
you watch perplexed and
stupefied, never moved or excited
though there's plenty of sex and
plenty of "action." Everything
seems to go on under several
inches of glass — it feels removed,
unreal.

The story could have been
plucked out of any trashy
romance novel. The "heroine"
April (Sherilyn Fenn), is the
oldest daughter in a rich, genteel
Southern family. She's beautiful
and princess-like, or so we are
supposed to believe.
Oddly, she has a trampy look
even in the classy outfits the film
makers dress her in — her hair
and skin looked bleached out,
Debbie Harry/ Madonna style. She
doesn't look believably upper
class.
April is about to marry a young,
local rich boy she obviously isn't
hot for — he isn't the brawny
masculine type she craves. Yet,
we know she has some heavy lust,
because very early on she is filmed
showering (we get plenty of nice
shots of her breasts).
She peeks through a missing
tile in the shower at some men
showering next door — the sight
of their nude wet bodies makes
her sink to the shower floor in
some sexual trance, steam billow
ing around her face and breasts.
She meets Perry (Richard

Tyson) at a carnival. He's a brute
with a beefed-up torso, and he
treats her with (sexy?) disrespect.
He comes to her enormous house
and seduces her in one long, un
erotic scene.
They go on to have several very
satisfying (she weeps!) sessions
together— and here's the conflict:
April is drawn to Perry's sensual
lower-class life, but she can't go
back on her responsibilities to her
family.
Will she run off with Perry and
have good raunchy sex, or will
she marry the guy she isn't hot
for and eternally squirm with un
satisfied desire? That's the central
issue in "Two Moon Junction."
It's a dumb question; this is a
dumb movie.
Junky films can be fun if the
actors are exciting, the dialogue
witty, the sex mildly sexy, but
this movie has nothing to redeem
itself. If it isn't porno in fact, it's
porno at heart.
The lame story seems to have
been written only to explain the
sex scenes, which aren't even very
interesting. The characters are all

shallow and they go at each other
with the humorless, exaggerated
passion that always seems faked.
This is like a porn movie without
the all-out sexual display— it will
satisfy no one.

"The 20th International Tournee
of Animation"
Varsity
456 University Avenue
Palo Alto
"The 20th International Tour

nee of Animation" bills itself as
a collection of the best animated
cartoons from all over the world.
And they're right; it is simply
amazing. No review can capture
the uniqueness of this diverse col
lection of 20-odd animated short
films.
The cartoons range from the
cute to the bizarre, from the
ridiculously funny to the morbid.
Some of them even manage to
combine the two. For example,
"Snookles," a three- minute teaser
that left the audience in stitches,

starts off as a cutesy skit about
a baby fire-breathing dragon and
a baby bird trying to make beau
tiful music together. It ends in
farcical tragedy, however, when
the dragon makes the mistake of
singing too hard . . . and . . . well
you get the picture.
Other skits manage to reflect
real-life situations with a unique
candor and wit in a way that no
other medium can. That's what
makes the "Tournee" so particu
larly appealing — the latent
whimsical, unrestrained creativity
that lashes out to the audience
from the screen.
You see such a vast repertoire
of techniques — claymation, stop
segment films, the latest in com
puter graphics — that just flashes
by in short, powerful snippets.
The humor of most of the skits
smacks of the best of Gary Lar
son's "The Far Side." The humor
in the "Tournee" shares that
same twisted sparkle.
If you're interested in an eve

"Casual Sex"
AMC Old Mill Six
San Antonio Central
Mountain View
Have a few drinks and go see
"Casual Sex" with a friend some
time. It's an odd, silly and sur
prisingly honest movie by
Genevieve Walter, about love and
sex in the AIDS scourged 1980s.
It has a weird quicksilver charm
that is ultimately impossible to
resist, though there are scenes
here so inane you want to groan.
The story is predictably light: two
young women go to a Club Med
type spa where they meet various
desirable and undesirable men,
and the comedy is spun from this.
Stacy (Lea Thompson) is sexy
and flirtatious; Melissa (Victoria
Jackson) is shy and repressed.
The movie is done in a funky,
easy style — the two women often
talk directly into the camera,
about their romantic lives, their
hopes and fears. Both actresses
are appealing, though at times
Jackson's nasal whine can be
grating, and Thompson is pain
fully cute.
Unquestionably this film is
messy and jumbled — a lot of it
is nothing more than screwball
sex comedy. But a few of the
scenes are sad, touching, and ex
ceptionally truthful, which is a
suprise in a "dumb" movie.
"Casual Sex" has been

marketed "dumb" (look at the
title!) and seems to want to be
flighty, but it keeps getting smart
in spite of itself. So many
"serious" films fail at the brutal
honesty that this flimsy movie al
most inadvertently seems to
stumble upon.
However, as soon as we've seen
a truthful or painful scene here,
the tone abruptly shifts and we're
back on the old breakneck laugh
track, bombarded with corny
jokes. This can be disorienting,
disturbing — the film can't make
up its mind what it wants to do.
The movie knows where we
hurt. In one scene Melissa makes
out with a man on the beach and
he can't "perform," so he gets up,
dresses, tells her he's "not at
tracted" to her, and leaves. This
is played off as comedy, but when
Melissa lQoks into the camera and
says to us, "I wish you hadn't
seen that," it cuts through the
comedy.
Scenes of Stacy unable to break
up with a boyfriend who drives
her crazy seem frighteningly real.
The loneliness of the characters
doesn't drown in the comedy.
The humor in this movie is a
mixture of silly gags and a mock
ery of our society: fitness freaks,
condoms, artistic types...some of
it's funny, some of it isn't. But
it's always quick, always colorful.
There are a lot of trashy movies
out there — and this has a tras

hier title than most. But "Casual
Sex" is actually quite funny and
on-target, though inconsistently
so. Go see this movie for a few
laughs, and you might be sur
prised at how much else you come
away with.

"Critters 2: The Main Course"
AMC Old Mill Six
San Antonio Central
Mountain View
"Critters 2: The Main Course"
opened to the delight of parents
teaching their children table man
ners.
A few of the original folks came
back for the seconds but probably
left in search of some Pepto-
Dismal.
The same day"The Main
Course" opened the original "Crit
ters" movie played on TV stations
everywhere.
The humurous furballs with
teeth from two years ago are back;
so are the bounty hunters and a
few harried town folk. What isn't
back is the humor. The first crit
ter movie was really funny. The
second...well they billed it as a
comedy.
Grover's Bend, Kansas (with
beautiful mountains in the back
ground?) is taken over by a litter
of newly hatched Krites. They too
are leftovers from the first critter
movie.

The eggs hatch just in time for
Easter. The young Krites are very
hungry and begin munching on
just about everything. All the
while they mumble to themselves,
sounding very much like a cross

between G rover and the Cookie
Monster from Sesame Street.
The subtitled translations from
the first movie are humorous
counterpoints that illuminated
the character of the critters. In

"Critters 2" there isn't a subtitle
until half way through the movie
and it isn't even funny.
The critters' dinner manners
are probably based on the culinary
habits of the Cookie Monster. The
cookie monster, though, reeks
decorum and manners compared
to the little Krites.
I guess some allowances need
to be made for the intended au
dience. The rating of PG-13 sets
it off as a munchkin exploitation
film. And the Playboy centerfold
shots are aimed at the 13-year
old. Close-ups of breasts expand
ing and bursting through leather
bindings are not for the mature.
The rest of "the Main Course"
consists of low-brow shots of crit
ters being stepped on, run over,
shot and exploded while they
gorge themselves on messy
foodstuffs. The critters eat one
dog, several cows, a sheriff, a
junkman, an alien bounty hunter,
several random townspeople and
anything else that gets too close.
The munchkins in the audience
cheer as the furballs rampage
through salad bars in greasy
spoon fast-food joints. They giggle
and laugh while people are turned
to messy skeletons. To their credit
they enjoyed themselves just as
much when the critters are
turned into glogs of green slime.

"Two Moon Junction"
Century Almaden
Blossom Hill/Almaden
San Jose
"Two Moon Junction" is a
movie trying desperately hard to
be sexy. Just look at the ad for
it: a picture of an ecstatic woman
embracing a bulky, half-naked
man. The caption reads, "Into her
perfect world comes a perfect
stranger — and suddenly . . .
nothing is perfect anymore."
After an asinine promotion like
that you can only expect a movie
as glossy and empty as this one,
so drained of all real feeling that
you watch perplexed and
stupefied, never moved or excited
though there's plenty of sex and
plenty of "action." Everything
seems to go on under several
inches of glass — it feels removed,
unreal.

The story could have been
plucked out of any trashy
romance novel. The "heroine"
April (Sherilyn Fenn), is the
oldest daughter in a rich, genteel
Southern family. She's beautiful
and princess-like, or so we are
supposed to believe.
Oddly, she has a trampy look
even in the classy outfits the film
makers dress her in — her hair
and skin looked bleached out,
Debbie Harry/ Madonna style. She
doesn't look believably upper
class.
April is about to marry a young,
local rich boy she obviously isn't
hot for — he isn't the brawny
masculine type she craves. Yet,
we know she has some heavy lust,
because very early on she is filmed
showering (we get plenty of nice
shots of her breasts).
She peeks through a missing
tile in the shower at some men
showering next door — the sight
of their nude wet bodies makes
her sink to the shower floor in
some sexual trance, steam billow
ing around her face and breasts.
She meets Perry (Richard

Tyson) at a carnival. He's a brute
with a beefed-up torso, and he
treats her with (sexy?) disrespect.
He comes to her enormous house
and seduces her in one long, un
erotic scene.
They go on to have several very
satisfying (she weeps!) sessions
together— and here's the conflict:
April is drawn to Perry's sensual
lower-class life, but she can't go
back on her responsibilities to her
family.
Will she run off with Perry and
have good raunchy sex, or will
she marry the guy she isn't hot
for and eternally squirm with un
satisfied desire? That's the central
issue in "Two Moon Junction."
It's a dumb question; this is a
dumb movie.
Junky films can be fun if the
actors are exciting, the dialogue
witty, the sex mildly sexy, but
this movie has nothing to redeem
itself. If it isn't porno in fact, it's
porno at heart.
The lame story seems to have
been written only to explain the
sex scenes, which aren't even very
interesting. The characters are all

shallow and they go at each other
with the humorless, exaggerated
passion that always seems faked.
This is like a porn movie without
the all-out sexual display— it will
satisfy no one.

"The 20th International Tournee
of Animation"
Varsity
456 University Avenue
Palo Alto
"The 20th International Tour

nee of Animation" bills itself as
a collection of the best animated
cartoons from all over the world.
And they're right; it is simply
amazing. No review can capture
the uniqueness of this diverse col
lection of 20-odd animated short
films.
The cartoons range from the
cute to the bizarre, from the
ridiculously funny to the morbid.
Some of them even manage to
combine the two. For example,
"Snookles," a three- minute teaser
that left the audience in stitches,

starts off as a cutesy skit about
a baby fire-breathing dragon and
a baby bird trying to make beau
tiful music together. It ends in
farcical tragedy, however, when
the dragon makes the mistake of
singing too hard . . . and . . . well
you get the picture.
Other skits manage to reflect
real-life situations with a unique
candor and wit in a way that no
other medium can. That's what
makes the "Tournee" so particu
larly appealing — the latent
whimsical, unrestrained creativity
that lashes out to the audience
from the screen.
You see such a vast repertoire
of techniques — claymation, stop
segment films, the latest in com
puter graphics — that just flashes
by in short, powerful snippets.
The humor of most of the skits
smacks of the best of Gary Lar
son's "The Far Side." The humor
in the "Tournee" shares that
same twisted sparkle.
If you're interested in an eve
ning of good, light-hearted fun,
see the "Tournee."
