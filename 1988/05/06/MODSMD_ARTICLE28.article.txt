"Casual Sex"
AMC Old Mill Six

Have a few drinks and go see
"Casual Sex" with a friend some
time. It's an odd, silly and sur
prisingly honest movie by
Genevieve Walter, about love and
sex in the AIDS scourged 1980s.
It has a weird quicksilver charm
that is ultimately impossible to
resist, though there are scenes
here so inane you want to groan.
The story is predictably light: two
young women go to a Club Med
type spa where they meet various
desirable and undesirable men,
and the comedy is spun from this.
Stacy (Lea Thompson) is sexy
and flirtatious; Melissa (Victoria
Jackson) is shy and repressed.
The movie is done in a funky,
easy style — the two women often
talk directly into the camera,
about their romantic lives, their
hopes and fears. Both actresses
are appealing, though at times
Jackson's nasal whine can be
grating, and Thompson is pain
fully cute.
Unquestionably this film is
messy and jumbled — a lot of it
is nothing more than screwball
sex comedy. But a few of the
scenes are sad, touching, and ex
ceptionally truthful, which is a
suprise in a "dumb" movie.
"Casual Sex" has been

marketed "dumb" (look at the
title!) and seems to want to be
flighty, but it keeps getting smart
in spite of itself. So many
"serious" films fail at the brutal
honesty that this flimsy movie al
most inadvertently seems to
stumble upon.
However, as soon as we've seen
a truthful or painful scene here,
the tone abruptly shifts and we're
back on the old breakneck laugh
track, bombarded with corny
jokes. This can be disorienting,
disturbing — the film can't make
up its mind what it wants to do.
The movie knows where we
hurt. In one scene Melissa makes
out with a man on the beach and
he can't "perform," so he gets up,
dresses, tells her he's "not at
tracted" to her, and leaves. This
is played off as comedy, but when
Melissa lQoks into the camera and
says to us, "I wish you hadn't
seen that," it cuts through the
comedy.
Scenes of Stacy unable to break
up with a boyfriend who drives
her crazy seem frighteningly real.
The loneliness of the characters
doesn't drown in the comedy.
The humor in this movie is a
mixture of silly gags and a mock
ery of our society: fitness freaks,
condoms, artistic types...some of
it's funny, some of it isn't. But
it's always quick, always colorful.
There are a lot of trashy movies
out there — and this has a tras

hier title than most. But "Casual
Sex" is actually quite funny and
on-target, though inconsistently
so. Go see this movie for a few
laughs, and you might be sur
prised at how much else you come
away with.

"Critters 2: The Main Course"
AMC Old Mill Six

"Critters 2: The Main Course"
opened to the delight of parents
teaching their children table man
ners.
A few of the original folks came
back for the seconds but probably
left in search of some Pepto-
Dismal.
The same day"The Main
Course" opened the original "Crit
ters" movie played on TV stations
everywhere.
The humurous furballs with
teeth from two years ago are back;
so are the bounty hunters and a
few harried town folk. What isn't
back is the humor. The first crit
ter movie was really funny. The
second...well they billed it as a
comedy.
Grover's Bend, Kansas (with
beautiful mountains in the back
ground?) is taken over by a litter
of newly hatched Krites. They too
are leftovers from the first critter
movie.

The eggs hatch just in time for
Easter. The young Krites are very
hungry and begin munching on
just about everything. All the
while they mumble to themselves,
sounding very much like a cross

between G rover and the Cookie
Monster from Sesame Street.
The subtitled translations from
the first movie are humorous
counterpoints that illuminated
the character of the critters. In

"Critters 2" there isn't a subtitle
until half way through the movie
and it isn't even funny.
The critters' dinner manners
are probably based on the culinary
habits of the Cookie Monster. The
cookie monster, though, reeks
decorum and manners compared
to the little Krites.
I guess some allowances need
to be made for the intended au
dience. The rating of PG-13 sets
it off as a munchkin exploitation
film. And the Playboy centerfold
shots are aimed at the 13-year
old. Close-ups of breasts expand
ing and bursting through leather
bindings are not for the mature.
The rest of "the Main Course"
consists of low-brow shots of crit
ters being stepped on, run over,
shot and exploded while they
gorge themselves on messy
foodstuffs. The critters eat one
dog, several cows, a sheriff, a
junkman, an alien bounty hunter,
several random townspeople and
anything else that gets too close.
The munchkins in the audience
cheer as the furballs rampage
through salad bars in greasy
spoon fast-food joints. They giggle
and laugh while people are turned
to messy skeletons. To their credit
they enjoyed themselves just as
much when the critters are
turned into glogs of green slime.
