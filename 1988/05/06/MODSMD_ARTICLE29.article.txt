## Card, Bears square off in second-place battle Stanford holds slim lead over Cal in Pac-10 Southern Division 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Things could be a lot
worse, says California
baseball Coach Bob
Milano.
Going into this week
end's three-game series
against Stanford,

Milano's Golden Bears (34-22 overall
and 14-13 in conference play) are stuck
in the middle of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division race. They are
in third place, a game-and-a-half behind
second-place Stanford (32-19, 14-10)
and a scant half-game ahead of fourth
place USC (32-18, 12-12).
"We're in a better position than I
thought we'd be in with three games
left," Milano said.
Arizona State has all but locked up
the conference title. The Sun Devils
lead the Cardinal by three-and-a-half
games, and their magic number is down
to one, meaning that any one Stanford
loss or ASU win will clinch the title for
the Sun Devils.
So this weekend's series between Cal
and Stanford — beginning at 2:30 p.m.
today at Evans Diamond in Berkeley,
moving to Sunken Diamond for a 1 p.m.
start tomorrow and returning to
Berkeley for the finale at 1 p.m Sunday
— will be a battle for second place. At
least three and possibly four teams from
the Six-Pac probably will be invited to
NCAA regional play.
However, second place is valuable. Al
though regional sites haven't been se
lected yet, it's virtually certain that
ASU, ranked third nationally in both
major polls, will host a tournament in
Tempe, Ariz., where the Sun Devils are
tough to beat. The team that finishes
second in the Six-Pac most likely
wouldn't be sent to a regional in Tempe
because the NCAA generally won't put
the top two teams from one conference
in the same regional.
Cal is in an interesting position be
cause this weekend's games are the last
on the Bears' regular-season schedule,
while Stanford and USC meet next
weekend at Sunken Diamond to con-

elude their schedules. There's only so
much the Bears can do to help them
selves. "We have to win one to have a
chance (for a regional berth)," Milano
said. "Ideally, we'd take two."
The Bears started the Six-Pac season
on a tear, pulling off an improbable
sweep of ASU in Tempe and holding
first place for the first few weeks of
the conference season. But Cal has
tailed off lately, bottoming out when
the Sun Devils came to Berkeley three
weeks ago and administered a sweep of
their own.
Cal took two of three from Arizona
last weekend in Berkeley, but continues
to have trouble with its pitching staff.
Mark Juhas, a mainstay of the starting
rotation for much of the year, has been
lost for the rest of the season. Travis
Willis, who was supposed to be the ace
of the staff this year, has been bothered
by arm trouble all season, and has been
"inconsistent," Milano said.
Asked yesterday to name his starting
rotation for the weekend, Milano said,
"That's a good question — Do you want
to talk to me and help me with that?"
Willis (7-7 season record, 5.40 ERA)
is the scheduled starter for today's
game, but he has been experiencing a
lot of stiffness in his pitching arm and
may not start until tomorrow, Milano
said.
Junior right-hander Mike Matthews
(5-1, 5.16) and senior left-hander Fred
Corral (3-4, 4.80) probably will be the
other two starters this weekend, Milano
said.

Stanford will counter with freshman
Mike Mussina (8-1, 3.67) today, senior
Lee Plemel (7-8, 5.22) tomorrow and
freshman Stan Spencer (4-2, 3.55) on
Sunday.
The Cardinal will pit its power and
pitching against the speed and balanced
offensive attack of the Bears. Cal has
swiped a total of 111 bases this year to
the Cardinal's 70, but Stanford has out
homered the Bears 49-31.
In the two teams' series earlier this
year, Stanford won both of the games
at Sunken Diamond and Cal won at
Evans Diamond. Stanford is 24-5
against Cal in games at Sunken Dia
mond since the Six-Pac was formed in
1979, and 14-14 at Evans Diamond.
"Sunken Diamond is not one of our
favorite places to play," Milano said.
Card notes
The Cardinal is ranked eighth nationally
by Baseball America and 10th by ESPN/Col
legiate Baseball, while Cal is ranked 24th
by Baseball America and 22nd by ESPN/Col
legiate Baseball.
All three of this weekend's games will be
broadcast live on KZSU (90.1 FM), with the
erudite John Platz and the effulgent Randy
Chappel providing play-by-play and com
mentary.
Cardinal sophomore shortstop Troy Paul
sen, whose hitting streak is at one game
and counting, is leading the team in batting
average (.351), at bats (222), hits (78) and
doubles (17). His 78 hits place him fourth
among the Pac-10's leaders, as do his doubles
(sixth) and batting average (10th).
The NCAA regionals will be held either
May 25-29 or May 26-30. Some regional
sites and participants in the tournament will
be selected on May 16 following a conference
call by the NCAA Baseball Committee. With
conference tournaments and make-up games
still to be played the week of May 16, the
entire field and all eight regional sites will
not be finalized until May 23. The College
World Series is scheduled for June 3-11 in
Omaha, Neb.
The Cardinal is 6-9 this year in games in
which it trailed after three innings, 4-14 in
games in which it trailed after six innings,
and 1-16 in games in which it trailed going
into the ninth inning. Stanford hasn't won
a game on a Friday since Feb. 26.
