# Student groups wage war on voter apathy
##

Many Stanford students do not know
that June 7 is the California primary,
according to the Santa Clara County
Registrar of Voters, and even fewer
realize they must be registered by May
9 to participate in the primary.
Traditionally, students have been con
fused or unaware of the voting process,
but campus political organizers hope to
change that. They agree that the most
confusing aspect of the process is the
absentee ballot.
The numbers show that a substantial
number of students, coming from out
of state, have not been at Stanford long
enough to learn about the local congres
sional races, and they are not sure how
to vote from campus for their represen
tatives in their home state.
For example, in the 1986 June pri-

Mary, there were 2,809 registered voters
at Stanford. According to the Registrar
of Voters, only 29 percent of those reg
istered voters actually cast ballots and
still less, 1.8 percent, sent away to their
home district for absentee ballots.
The numbers improved somewhat in
the November 1986 general election,
with 5,918 people registering to vote
Almost half of those who registered ac
tually voted, while 2.9 percent voted ab
sentee.
As of April 25 of this year, 2,889
students are registered as Democrats
while 1,225 are Republicans, according
to junior Subodh Chandra, president of
the Stanford Democrats.
The numbers also reflect another
trend among Stanford voters: a preoc
cupation with national politics, which
will no doubt be heightened by this
year's presidential race.
But campus politicos insist that
there is widespread interest on
campus in both local and national
political races this year. The goal
then becomes, according to
Chandra, "to show students how
their specific concerns translate
into electoral politics."
Local organizers are counting
on the race for the 12th Congres
sional District, which includes
Stanford, to pique student inter
est. The race, which features a
Stanford law professor, is being
billed as one of the hottest in the
nation.
Law student Chris Raboin,
campus coordinator for Republi

can Law Prof. Tom Campbell,
thinks students will get involved
in the congressional race because
of "the particular personalities"
of the candidates.
U.S. Rep. Ernie Konnyu, Camp
bell's Republican foe, has "high
name recognition" on campus, ac
cording to Raboin. "When I tell
people about him at study breaks,
a lot of people boo and hiss at
him in disgust," Raboin said.
Senior Mark Lemley, an activist
for Democratic candidate Jim
Garrison, is finding a surprising
amount of interest in the congres
sional race.
"Garrison always speaks to
capacity crowds and we get people
in here all the time wanting to
volunteer in the office and walk
precincts," he said.
And while students have not
shown a desire for specific polit

ical programming in their dorms,
they have drifted over to tables
set up by campus representatives
in White Plaza. Junior Hugh Bet
hell, co-chair of Students For Du
kakis, said "the typical response
of these potential voters is usually
'1 really should learn more about
the issues and find out what the
candidates are saying.' "
According to Bethell, the pri
maries "haven't come into focus
yet." Even so, Chandra and other
Democratic coordinators say they
usually get about 20 students per
hour wandering over to their
White Plaza tables and leafing
through position papers.
"We've registered literally hun
dreds of voters in the past two
months," Chandra said. Between
February 25 and April 25, 375
democrats have registered, ac
cording to Chandra.
