# Student groups wage war on voter apathy

Many Stanford students do not know
that June 7 is the California primary,
according to the Santa Clara County
Registrar of Voters, and even fewer
realize they must be registered by May
9 to participate in the primary.
Traditionally, students have been con
fused or unaware of the voting process,
but campus political organizers hope to
change that. They agree that the most
confusing aspect of the process is the
absentee ballot.
The numbers show that a substantial
number of students, coming from out
of state, have not been at Stanford long
enough to learn about the local congres
sional races, and they are not sure how
to vote from campus for their represen
tatives in their home state.
For example, in the 1986 June pri-

Mary, there were 2,809 registered voters
at Stanford. According to the Registrar
of Voters, only 29 percent of those reg
istered voters actually cast ballots and
still less, 1.8 percent, sent away to their
home district for absentee ballots.
The numbers improved somewhat in
the November 1986 general election,
with 5,918 people registering to vote
Almost half of those who registered ac
tually voted, while 2.9 percent voted ab
sentee.
As of April 25 of this year, 2,889
students are registered as Democrats
while 1,225 are Republicans, according
to junior Subodh Chandra, president of
the Stanford Democrats.
The numbers also reflect another
trend among Stanford voters: a preoc
cupation with national politics, which
will no doubt be heightened by this
