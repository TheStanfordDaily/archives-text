Continuing an indoor
tradition initiated by
Stanford men's tennis
Coach Dick Gould in
1974, the Stanford
men's and women's ten
nis teams host California

tomorrow at Maples Pavilion in a mixed
team format.
The competition, which begins at 7
p.m., is based on cumulative scoring
from the six matches — the team with
the most points after all the matches
have been completed is the winner.
Each match is limited to one set. Ad
mission for students and faculty is $2.
Last year, Gould had to give his tie
to Cal men's Coach Scott McCain as
part of a pre-match wager when the
Bears won the exhibition match for the
first time ever, 35-30. This year, how
ever, Gould is the solid favorite to collect
the tie, as the Cardinal men's and wom
en's team are ranked first and second,
respectively, while both Cal squads have
struggled.
"It's not a blood-and-guts thing,"
Gould said, "but it's a nice friendly
rivalry. The players and fans enjoy the
relaxed atmosphere and the mixed dou

bles."
The event also marks the final com
petition for both the Cardinal men and
women before the NCAA champion
ships. The women's NCAAs start Wed
nesday in Los Angeles, while the men's
NCAAs begin May 20 in Athens, Ga.
In tomorrow's first contest, Stanford
sophomore Jeff Cathrall and junior
Cindy Buchsbaum play Cal's Doug
Eisenmann and Sharon Fletcher.
In men's singles, the Cardinal's Jeff
Tarango, the nation's No. 6 player, faces
Woody Hunt. Tarango and Hunt have
met three times this season, with
Tarango winning twice.
In a match between two of the na
tion's best women's doubles teams,
Stanford senior Cari Hagey and fresh
man Sandra Birch, the nation's No. 3
doubles tandem, meet Tiffany Silveria
and Alissa Finerman, the Pacific 10
Conference doubles champions.
Senior Patrick McEnroe and fresh

man Martin Blackman follow, facing
Cal's Carl Chang and Eddie Marcum.
In women's singles, Stanford sopho
more Lisa Green, the Pac-10 singles
champion, meets Jean Marie Lozano.
A pair of standout freshmen close out
the competition for the Cardinal. David
Wheaton, ranked fourth in the nation,
and Teri Whitlinger, rated 17th, play
Cal's Pete Fitzpatrick and Jennifer
Prah.
Card Notes
The iryury watch for the Stanford
men is improving, while injuries con
tinue to haunt the Cardinal women.
Wheaton, who pulled a groin muscle
two weekends ago at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships in Ojai, is ready to go after
missing last weekend's dual-match
against Cal.
But the women can't shed their nag
ging problems. Freshman Tami Whit
linger, Stanford's No. 1 player, is cur
rently out with a groin pull and is ques
tionable for the NCAAs this week. "I'm
going to try to hit possibly this weekend
and see how it feels," she said. "If it's
real bad then I might not be able to
play (at the NCAAs)."
Junior Eleni Rossides, ranked No. 1
in the nation earlier this season, has
not played a dual match this season,
also because of a groin pull.
