As they say on the
18th tee, "Last
chance!"
The Stanford
women's golf team
gets its last chance
to move up in the

national rankings and earn a
postseason berth in its final tour
nament of the regular season.
They will co-host the California
Intercollegiate with San Jose
State this Sunday and Monday at
the par-73, 6,100-yard Stanford
Golf Course.
The Cardinal women, currently
ranked 17th in the nation, need
to move ahead of Kentucky
(16th), Florida State (15th), and
Ohio State (Nth) to assure them
selves of an NCAA Championship
berth. The top 14 teams, plus 3
"at large" teams, are invited.
"If we play up to our potential,
we can definitely make it," Stan
ford Coach Tim Baldwin said. "We
need three solid rounds from
everyone."
The competition is not nearly
as tough as it was at the Stanford
Intercollegiate last October.
fall six of the nation's top 10
teams competed. The highest
ranked team this time is 10th

ranked San Jose State, with
UCLA (11th) and U.S. Interna
tional (12th) close behind.
Fiflh-ranked USC was invited,
but has already exceeded the
NCAA limit on competitive
rounds for the year. Washington,
Washington State, and Hawaii all
could not attend because their
players are taking final exams.
Consequently, the field is also
smaller this time, with only nine
teams competing as opposed to
18 last fall.
Although the Cardinal's main
goal is to win the tournament and
earn a trip to NCAAs, Baldwin at
least wants to see his team beat
San Diego State. Ranked 21st, the
Aztecs have beaten the Cardinal
in each of the three times they
have played together. "Until this
year we had never lost to them
(SDSU)," he said.
Other teams that will play are
Long Beach State, Oregon, Ore
gon State, and Pepperdine.
As usual, Baldwin will look to
his two standout players, senior
Kay Cornelius and freshman Jodi
Figley, to lead the way for the
Cardinal. Should the team fail to
qualify for NCAAs, Cornelius has
"a lock" on an individual bid, ac
cording to Baldwin, while Figley
is "on the bubble."
"If Jodi (Figley) has a good In-

If we play up to our potential, we can

need three solid rounds from everyone.'

tercollegiate she'll go (to
NCAAs)," Baldwin said.
Cornelius is currently ranked
ninth individually, while Figley is
15th. The top eight players are
selected to the All-America First
Team, while the next eight make
the Second Team. Players ranked
17th through 24th receive
Honorable Mention.
But by no means will the Car
dinal contingent be a two-woman
show. Freshman Kristin Ryan
continues to increase her prowess
on the course, and sophomore
Stephanie Parel has begun to
show some spark. Both recorded
impressive four-round totals of
320 at last week's Pacific 10 Con
ference Championships. Fresh
man Michele Lyford has also
shown the potential to fill in when
her teammates falter, having
carded a solid 77 on the third

round at Pac-lOs when Cornelius
slipped to a rare 82.
In addition, the women will be
playing in their own backyard,
which is a distinct advantage, par
ticularly on the Stanford course.
The course will pose a real test
for the players this weekend. The
greens were sanded and "aerified"
over the past two weeks, and they
are very hard and very fast.
The hardness of the greens will
make it difficult to stop approach
shots, forcing players to play the
roll of the greens more often than
usual.
If the recent high winds con
tinue through the weekend, look
for some high numbers on the
leader board.
If you intend to watch any of
the tournament, the following lo
cations are recommended:

Above and behind the 12th tee:
From this location you can see
tee shots on the monstrous J 2th
hole. In addition, play on the
arena-like 14th green and the
tight doglegged 9th hole can be
observed.
Above the 18th green: The clas
sic observation point. The par-5
finishing hole will be reachable
for most long hitters, while the
collection bunker on the front
right portion of the green catches
most wayward attempts. From
there you can also keep an eye
on the leader board.
Regardless of conditions,
Baldwin and his young team must
demonstrate that they can play
with NCAA-caliber teams if they
hope to extend their season.
