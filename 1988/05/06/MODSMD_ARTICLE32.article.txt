# Crew gets ready in final tune-up

### Don Hogue Staff writer 
Stanford's crew teams face
one last set of tests before the
Pacific Coast Championships,
which will be held in two
weeks. Tomorrow, Stanford's
women's crews will host Pen
insula rival Santa Clara at Red
wood Shores while the men's
frosh and novice crews will
travel to Davis.
This weekend, Stanford's
women will have a chance not
only to race in more familiar
surroundings but also to work
together in a race situation
before heading north to
Sacramento.
The varsity will use the
weekend to regroup following
last weekend's loss to Califor
nia. For the first time in over
two weeks, Stanford's varsity
will field a boat without being
hampered by either illness or
injury. Of note, sophomore
Diana Olson returns after a
bout with the flu that left the

varsity considerably weakened
last weekend.
The novice women will have
the opportunity to prove their
number-one West Coast
ranking against the Broncos.
Undefeated on the season,
Stanford Coach Wendy Davis'
novice crew defeated Cal by
more than 18 seconds last
weekend in unfavorable condi
tions on the Oakland Estuary.
"With the boats we have
now, I think we've really got
the best shot at winning it
(Pacific Coast Championships)
we've had since I've been
coaching here," Davis said.
However, Davis was cautious
as she noted, "The name of the
game with novices is upset. You
never know who could surprise
you at this level."
Davis and Stanford's novice
women will also be awaiting
tomorrow's results of the
California-Washington novice
