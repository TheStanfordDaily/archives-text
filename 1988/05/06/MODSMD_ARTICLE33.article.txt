# Track prepares for Pac-10s
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Almost as soon as it
began, the track and
field dual-meet season
is over for Stanford.
After a tight battle
against California,
with the women at 1-0

and the men 0-1, the rest of the
season, starting tomorrow at Modesto,
will be spent preparing for the Pacific
10 Conference Championships.
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson de
scribed last weekend's dual meet as
part of a program that will continue
until the Pac-10 meet, the NCAA
Championships, and, for a select few,

the U.S. Olympic trials and possibly
Seoul. "The effort was what it was
supposed to be," according to
Johnson, who is hoping it will con
tinue this weekend.
The men currently have 17
qualifiers for the Pac-10 meet, which
will be held in two weeks. Several
athletes will have another chance this
weekend. Senior Henry Grenn, who
has qualified in the long jump, will
try to add the triple jump as well,
while freshmen Marcus Hickerson
and Darrell Armstrong will be shoot
ing for the long jump qualifying mark.
Sophomore Vanessa Hubbard will be
aiming for the women's NCAA stand
ard in the triple jump.

The men will also be fielding a com
petitive high jump squad, led by senior
Brian Marshall. Marshall has quali
fied for the NCAAs but has been hurt
recently and will be getting back his
form while trying to qualify for the
Canadian Olympic team. Freshman
John Hopkins will be attempting to
match his high school best of seven
feet to get to the Pac-10 meet. Soph
omore Wendy Allen will be represent
ing the women in the event.
The women currently have seven
members on the Pac-10 list, and are
hoping to add a few in the next two
weeks. The Cardinal, with a strong
distance team, may be aided by the
lack of qualification barriers in the
5,000 and 10,000 meters.
