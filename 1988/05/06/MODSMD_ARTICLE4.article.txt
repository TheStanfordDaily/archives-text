# Economists call American legal system inefficient

### Sherrell Evans 
Milton Friedman and
Kenneth Arrow, both
Nobel Memorial Prize win
ners in Economic Science,
called attention to flaws in
thi U.S. legislative system
in front of a standing
room-only crowd yesterday
at Kresge Auditorium.
Friedman, a senior fel
low at the Hoover Institu
tion and professoi of eco-

nomics at the University of Chicago,
warned that legal enactments have the po
tential to seriously affect the economic sys
tem.
"What appears to be a minor change in
law . . . can have far-reaching economic
effects," Friedman said.
Arrow, also a senior Hoover fellow and
economics professor at Stanford, explained
that there is an inherent potential within

the law to achieve something -of value at
minimum cost.
The American legal system, however, is

inefficient and unable to
tap this potential, accord
ing to Arrow. He explained
that it is beset with con
fusion because of the un
certainty of many of its
laws.
Friedman attributed this
uncertainty to the lack of
foresight of some legisla
tors. Lawmakers often do
not plan far enough in ad-

vance to consider the potential economic
ramifications, he said.
Arrow said that although no law can be
specififc in every detail and it is impossible
to have a legal code with no ambiguity,
the degree of uncertainty in the American
system needs to be reduced.
"Uncertainties can be thought of as an

excess of burdens if they can be
eliminated," Arrow said. "When
you have uncertainty, you can
have difference of opinion on in
terpreting legal conflicts."
According to Friedman, there
are two principal relationships be
tween economics and law: the re
lationship between economic anal
ysis and law, and secondly the
relationship between economic
enactments and law.
"In recent years, courts have
even used economic analysis in
reaching their decisions," Fried
man said. "This is something very
unusual."
Friedman explained that it is
natural to think of American law
as legislative law, but added that
lawyers realize that the bulk of

our laws is not designed by the
people, but instead by common
law developed by the courts based
on precedent.
"Fundamentally, one of the
reasons we have so much empha
sis on precedent in common law
is an attempt to reduce uncertain
ty," Friedman said, adding that
with legislative law, the degree of
uncertainty increases. He cited
the tendency of the tax laws to
change every couple of years as
an example of the fickleness of
legislative laws.
"In general, the freer the eco
nomic system, the greater the role
of common law, and the smaller
the role of legislative law," Fried
man said.
Because legislative law brings
more uncertainty, the state will
have to be more involved in the
economic system than if only com
mon law prevailed, Friedman said.
