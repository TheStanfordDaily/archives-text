Kenneth Arrow, both
Nobel Memorial Prize win

nomics at the University of Chicago,

"What appears to be a minor change in
law . . . can have far-reaching economic
effects," Friedman said.

economics professor at Stanford, explained
that there is an inherent potential within

the law to achieve something -of value at
minimum cost.
The American legal system, however, is

inefficient and unable to
tap this potential, accord
ing to Arrow. He explained
that it is beset with con
fusion because of the un
certainty of many of its
laws.
Friedman attributed this
uncertainty to the lack of
foresight of some legisla
tors. Lawmakers often do
not plan far enough in ad-

vance to consider the potential economic
ramifications, he said.
Arrow said that although no law can be
specififc in every detail and it is impossible
to have a legal code with no ambiguity,
the degree of uncertainty in the American
system needs to be reduced.
"Uncertainties can be thought of as an
