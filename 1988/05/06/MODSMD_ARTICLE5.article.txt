# Student leaders encourage more minority admissions
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
In response to Provost James Rosse's
annual affirmative action report, minor
ity student leaders agreed Stanford has
made gains in student and faculty mi
nority recruitment but re-emphasized
the need for further improvement.
While the Rosse report shows an over
all increase in the number of minority
undergraduates, it emphasizes the need
to expand "the University's capacity to
identify and attract minority undergrad
uates." Rosse said the University should
"keep pressing" its minority recruiters
in order to "seek out and recruit the
best 112 Stanford I can."
"The gap between what we have done
and what we aspire to do remains pain

full large," Rosse said in his report
which was discussed yesterday at the
Faculty Senate meeting.
Sophomore Mary Dillard, next year's
BSU chair, said she is very pleased with
th ■ percentage of black students in next
year's freshman class. However, like
(o:- ->e, Dillard said "there is always room
for improvement."
Dillard said she plans to push a pro*
gram in which Stanford students are
sent to high schools to recruit under
graduate minority applicants.
Senioi Rudy Fuentes, former director
of E! Cer. ro Chicano, he supports
a similar proposal.

While the Rosse report shows

tify and attract minority under
graduates." Rosse said the Uni
versity should "keep pressing" its
minority recruiters in order to
"seek out and recruit the best
(Stanford] can."
"The gap between what we have
done and what we aspire to do
remains painfully large," Rosse
said in his report which was dis
cussed yesterday at the Faculty

Senate meeting.
Sophomore Mary Dillard, next
year's BSU chair, said she is very
pleased with the percentage of
black students in next year's
freshman class. However, like
Rosse, Dillard said "there is al
ways room for improvement."
Dillard said she plans to push
a program in which Stanford stu
dents are sent to high schools to
recruit undergraduate minority
applicants.
Senior Rudy Fuentes, former
director of El Centro Chicano,
said he supports a similar propos
al.
According to the report, an all
time high 19.8 percent of the stu
dents accepted for next year's
freshman class are black,
Chicano/Latino and Native Amer
ican students.
However, this number marks
less than a one percent increase
from last year for these groups,

which are specifically targeted by
the University for undergraduate
recruitment. Asian American stu
dents are not targeted.
Through the past five years,
Asian Americans doubled their
admissions from 7.3 to 16.0 per
cent of the freshman clasi, though
the number of Asian American
applicants increased 250 percent.
Junior Derick Lin, chair of the
Asian American Student Associa
tion's Issues Committee, said that
although Asian American admis
sions went up, most of these stu
dents came from upper-middle
class, suburban families. AASA is
seeking University recruitment of
Asian students from poorer,
working-class families.
Denni Woodward, Program Co
ordinator of the Native American
Cultural Center, said the Univer
sity is at a "turning point" with
respect to Native American af
firmative action.
