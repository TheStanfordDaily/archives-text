# Higher salaries to boost budget
## 
### Jeff Album Staff writer 
The 1988-89 operating budget pro
posal, issued this week by Provost
James Rosse, calls for an 8.8 percent
•y re;t in overall I niversit} spending.
Rosse identified salary increases as
the "largest driving force" behind the
proposed $852 million budget, up $28.5
million from last year.
Next year's six to eight percent tui
tion hike provides much of the income
for increased University spending. The
proposed budget also anticipates growth

in endowment income, gifts and grants,
special funds from non-endowed invest
ments and reimbursed indirect costs.
The budget includes $5 million spe
cifically targeted for salary increases to
all staff, except those in the Schools of
Business and Medicine and the Hoover
Research Program. The latter are
funded through the University's
"restricted" budget, which comes pri
marily from federally sponsored re
search grants and contracts.
After expenditures for research and
teaching, which total $155.3 million, the
largest allocations from the operational

budget v ill be for Administration Serv
ices and Operations and Maintenance.
Rt ss« said a 10 ft percent increase in
udget, from $44.7
m lio: in 1987-88 to $49 5 million for
1988-89, reflects a growing commitment
to d«;U more effectively with health and
safety issues.
A 9.8 percent growth in Operations
and Maintenance funding, from $47 mil
lion to $51.8 million, accounts for new
facilities and building developments
around campus.
