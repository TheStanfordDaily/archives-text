# Higher salaries to boost budget
## 
### Jeff Album Staff writer 
The 1988-89 operating budget pro
posal, issued this week by Provost
James Rosse, calls for an 8.8 percent
•y re;t in overall I niversit} spending.
Rosse identified salary increases as
the "largest driving force" behind the
proposed $852 million budget, up $28.5
million from last year.
Next year's six to eight percent tui
tion hike provides much of the income
for increased University spending. The
proposed budget also anticipates growth

in endowment income, gifts and grants,
special funds from non-endowed invest
ments and reimbursed indirect costs.
The budget includes $5 million spe
cifically targeted for salary increases to
all staff, except those in the Schools of
Business and Medicine and the Hoover
Research Program. The latter are
funded through the University's
"restricted" budget, which comes pri
marily from federally sponsored re
search grants and contracts.
After expenditures for research and
teaching, which total $155.3 million, the
largest allocations from the operational

budget v ill be for Administration Serv
ices and Operations and Maintenance.
Rt ss« said a 10 ft percent increase in
udget, from $44.7
m lio: in 1987-88 to $49 5 million for
1988-89, reflects a growing commitment
to d«;U more effectively with health and
safety issues.
A 9.8 percent growth in Operations
and Maintenance funding, from $47 mil
lion to $51.8 million, accounts for new
facilities and building developments
around campus.
The University's library system
receives the fourth largest slice,
$33.3 million, of the proposed
budget.
The proposal singles out the li
brary's collections division for a
whopping 18 percent increase.
"We're generally pleased and
grateful," said Collections devel
opment officer Michael Ryan. He
said, however, that the increase
will only allow Stanford libraries
to keep pace with last year's
aquisitions. The library system
purchases 40 to 50 percent of its
collections from abroad, and the
devaluation of the dollar over the
past academic year has raised
costs, Ryan said.
Rosse said the operating budget

was designed using a new decen
tralized budgeting process.
In the past, schools asked for
funds on a yearly basis and were
subject to the Provost's decision
on their requests. This year, how
ever, each school prepared a plan
projecting funding needs for the
next three years. The Provost will
award the schools block sums, al
lowing the schools to determine
how the money will be spent.
The new process gives greater
autonomy to individual schools
and departments to determine the
direction of their growth, Rosse
said.
"Our biggest priority was to es
tablish budget redesign, to estab
lish a more planned approach,"
Rosse said.
The budget proposal waits ap
proval by the Board of Trustees,
which will vote on it later this
year.
