# Senior drowns in canoeing tragedy
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
On a retreat meant to celebrate his
senior year at Stanford, a student
drowned yesterday when his canoe cap
sized in the choppy waters of Fallen Leaf
Lake at Stanford Sierra Camp.
The victim's name was not released
because the next of kin had not been
notified as of late last night. However,
the student was identified as a 22-year
old male from Southern California who
was a double major in electrical engineer
ing and biological sciences.
The apparent accident occurred at the
Stanford Senior Weekend, sponsored an
nually by the Stanford Alumni Associa

tion at the Sierra Camp, near Lake
Tahoe.
His companion in the canoe, computer
science major Terry Bernstein, from
Woodland Hills, Calif., was pulled from
the cold water by three people in a small
fishing boat. Bernstein, who was delirious
at the time, is reportedly in good condi
tion in Barton Memorial Hospital's in
tensive care unit, where he is being kept
for observation. He should be released
later today, according to a nurse there.
During a routine check of the lake in
a speedboat, staff members at the camp
discovered the fishing boat with
Bernstein aboard, and the body floating
nearby.
The two students were found about

two miles northeast of the camp, close
to an hour before the camp's 2 p.m.
checkout time.
After retrieving the body, the staff took
both students to shore, where a sheriff s
deputy and Dave Bunnett, an emergency
medical technician from the camp, at
tempted to revive the victim with car
diopulmonary resuscitation.
Bunnett removed Bernstein's wet
clothes, wrapped him in his own, and
placed him in a sleeping bag. Bernstein
was then taken to the hospital and
treated for possible hypothermia, accord
ing to Chris Thomsen, manager of the
camp.
Most of the 90 seniors who attended
the retreat had already left or were

leaving as the camp staff discovered the
two students at 12:35 p.m. It was not
known how long the two seniors had
been on the lake.
Fallen Leaf Lake, which has an ap
proximate circumference of three miles
and is never more than one mile wide,
is nearly 10 miles from the southwest
corner of Lake Tahoe by car and about
one mile by air.
Although only a few students ventured
out onto the lake in unseasonal snows
Saturday, many more took advantage of
yesterday's improved weather, but had
to struggle with strong winds and waves.
Thomsen said yesterday's weather was
not bad enough to prompt camp officials
to restrict activities on the lake, but many

students said they found the going treac
herous in the camp's canoes, rowboats
and sailboats.
Senior Brandi Watson said she "really
had to paddle against the wind to come
in" to the shore yesterday, and added
that she was not surprised to learn that
a student had drowned because her canoe
nearly capsized several times.
Alex Perez, another senior, said he and
several friends decided not to go out on
the lake at all because they "could see
the canoes out there being pushed to the
center; they had no control."
Several people said a small group of
seniors walked back to the camp after
anchoring their canoe on the
shore far from the camp. "They
said they just gave up and
couldn't paddle back" because the
winds were too strong, according
to senior Fary Mahamedi.
Both Thomsen and William
Stone, director of the Alumni As
sociation, said they could not

recall a similar tragedy occurring
on the lake in the history of the
Sierra Camp, which was founded
at the turn of the century.
A resident fellow in the
deceased student's dormitory said
only a few of the victim's closest
friends have been informed of the
drowning and added that he plans
to call a special meeting for the
dorm's residents today after the
next of kin are notified.
He said he hopes residents
there will eventually "find a way
to say good-bye to him."

Upon learning of the drowning,
many of the seniors on the retreat
expressed shock that their tran
quil weekend took such a tragic
turn at its end.
"It was really quiet," said senior
Rosemarie Day, who added that
she wished students had learned
to use distress signals before
trying the waters.
"I was glad my boyfriend was
rowing the boat because I could
never have made it back," she
said. "Stanford smarts don't help
you in situations like that."
