## Former U.S. Sen. McCarthy endorses Garrison 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
In a cameo appearance at
Stanford Friday afternoon,
former Democratic presidential
candidate Eugene McCarthy
endorsed Mountain View busi
ness consultant Jim Garrison's
run for the 12th Congressional
District seat.
McCarthy, appearing at an
event sponsored by the Stan
ford Democrats, praised Gar
rison and pointed to a "distinct
leadership vacuum" in the
United States that permeates
the presidency and the U.S.
Senate.
McCarthy told his Cubberley
audience, "What we really need
is a House of Representatives
with a new force in it which
will come from people like Jim
Garrison to reinvigorate Amer

ican politics."
Garrison said McCarthy's
stand against President Lyn
don Johnson's escalation of
U.S. involvement in Vietnam
and the draft inspired his own
political style, as he introduced
the former senator from Min
nesota.
Garrison called McCarthy
"the beacon" for his own po
litical awakening in the late
19605.
Garrison related the trying,
agonizing crisis of conscience
he experienced when, as a stu
dent in 1968, he had to face
charges of draft evasion.
"I went through the most
refined political agony I think
that I've ever gone through,
with my whole future being
called into account against a
decision I had to make," Gar
rison said.
