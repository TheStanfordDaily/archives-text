Israel deport order blocked
JERUSALEM — The Israeli Supreme Court
yesterday issued a temporary injunction bar
ring deportation of Palestinian-American ac
tivist Mubarak Awad pending a hearing on
his appeal, which could set a legal precedent
affecting thousands of Jerusalem-born Arabs.
The court gave the government three days
to answer Awad's argument that it has no
right under the so-called Law of Entry into
Israel of 1952 to deny him residency.
Awad was arrested in a midnight raid on
his home Thursday after Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, in his additional capacity as
acting interior minister, signed the deportation
order over strong U.S. objections.
While Israel accused the Jerusalem-born
U.S.-educated psychologist of activities harm
ful "to the security of the state and to the
public order," the specific grounds for the
expulsion order are that Awad has been in
the country illegally since his tourist visa ex
pired Nov. 22.
Awad's attorney, Jonathan Kuttab, said that
the basis of the appeal filed on his client's
behalf yesterday is that Awad "can't be con
sidered a tourist in his own homeland."
While no precise figures are available, Amer
ican officials here agreed with Kuttab that the
outcome of the case could affect "tens of
thousands" of other Jerusalem-born Arabs
whose current legal status is "very question
able."
Borja wins Ecuador presidency

QUITO, Ecuador — Rodrigo
Borja, a soft-spoken left-of
center intellectual, won a con
vincing victory yesterday in
Ecuador's presidential elec
tion, defeating feisty populist
Abdala Bucaram in a race
characterized more by its
crude language than a quality
of political debate.
Borja won 1,584,483 votes

to Bucaram's 1,344,200, a margin of well over
200,000 votes, according to nearly complete,
unofficial returns compiled by the nation's
commercial television networks.
In giving the victory to Boija, Ecuador's
voters opted for a traditional social democrat
from the nation's political mainstream and
rejected a populist who had shrieked out his
campaign speeches, portraying Borja as the
devil and casting explicit aspersions on his
manhood. Borja had responded that Bucaram
was a "mad man" and a "barbarian."
Boija not only won handily in his own stron
ghold, the upland capital city of Quito, but
also made strong inroads into Bucaram's
power base, the grimy, sprawling port city of
Guayaquil, to win the runoff election in his
third campaign for the presidency.
