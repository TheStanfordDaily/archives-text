# Polish shipyard strike nears settlement
## 
### 
GDANSK, Poland â€” Solidarity un
ion leaders last night appeared close
to accepting a compromise with Polish
authorities that would end a seven-day
strike at the Lenin shipyard here that
has become the focal point of more
than 2 Vi weeks of nationwide labor
unrest.
Under a settlement plan offered late
yesterday afternoon by Poland's pow
erful interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak, workers would abandon the
strike without winning their chief
demand of legalization for the out
lawed Solidarity union, which was
born as an independent labor coalition
here in 1980.
In exchange, shipyard management
would grant workers a pay increase,
forgo criminal or disciplinary action
against them and allow establishment

of a special commission that would
include strike representatives to over
see the agreement.
It was not clear late last night
whether the compromise would be ac
cepted either by the management or
by the fewer than 500 striking workers
still occupying the shipyard, which has
been under police siege since last
Thursday morning. When informed of
the government proposal at an assem
bly this evening, workers responded
with cries of "Solidarity" and said they
would not give up their demand for
legalization of the union.
At this time, the chief sticking point
in the compromise arrangement ap
pears to be formation of the special
commission. After initially agreeing to
it, management reversed its position
and refused to accept the commission,

which Solidarity leaders regard as a
face-saving symbolic step toward un
ion pluralism in the shipyard.
"The management agreed to every
thing but one word: commission," said
Andrzej Celinski, one of a dozen or
more veteran Solidarity advisers
working to hammer out the compro
mise. "But that for us is the absolute
minimum."
Solidarity leaders said they believe
the proposed settlement was an 11th
hour government alternative to break
ing the strike with a police attack. In
a statement outlining their position,
strike committee leaders said that
while they continued to believe that
"the legal activity of Solidarity is in
dispensable for overcoming the crisis,"
they did not want "to contribute in

the least to aggravating the political
climate in Poland."
Young workers insisting on sticking
to the demand for Solidarity "don't
know what it's like to be beaten, to
be taken away and put in jail," said
Andrzej Duzynski, a member of the
strike committee, in explaining why
the solution was being considered.
"We, who are older, want to try to
arrange some kind of compromise so
they won't have to live through that,"
he said.
It was not clear last night whether
Solidarity Chair Lech Walesa, who has
presented himself here as an adviser
rather than a strike leader, supported
the decision of the strike committee
to give up the demand for Solidarity.
