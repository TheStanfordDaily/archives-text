# Mitterrand re-elected by a wide margin

PARIS â€” Francois Mitterrand was
re-elected president of France with a
triumphant 54 percent of the vote yes
terday and called on political adver
saries as well as supporters to join
him in making "national solidarity"
their first priority.
The 71-year-old Socialist's easy vic
tory over Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac for a second seven-year term
opened a period of uncertainty on the
French political landscape. It raised
the possibility of early legislative elec
tions or attempts at a center-left
governing majority of the kind that
has been out of style since Charles de

Gaulle redefined politics here 30 years
ago.
The renewed victory marked the
high point of a see-saw political career
spanning all of France's postwar po
litical history. The versatile son of
devout rural Catholics, Mitterrand has
evolved over the years from a young
Resistance leader to a Socialist
reformer to a regal president making
overtures to the business-oriented cen
ter.
Although he generated concern in
Washington when he first took over
the presidency in 1981 and brought
Communists into the government,

Mitterrand begins his second term of
office as a highly trusted U.S. ally and
partner in most strategic areas.
Mitterrand's conservative opponent
conceded defeat minutes after com
puter projections established the score.
With 91 percent of the vote counted,
the Interior Ministry said Chirac had
45.8 percent to Mitterrand's 54.2 per
cent.
Chirac was expected to resign in the
next few days to permit Mitterrand to
name a new prime minister and seek
a new majority. "In a democracy, the
people decide, and I bow to their
choice," Chirac declared.

But Chirac, who for
the moment at least
still heads the conser
vative majority in par
liament, said his neo-
Gaullist movement
carries a message of
hope for France and
will continue to seek
political power to
translate it into ac
tion.

"Together, we will make this hope
live,'' Chirac said. "We will make it
grow, in unity."
