### 
A $2.5 million luxury yacht
was seized by the Coast Guard
after one-tenth of an ounce of
marijuana was found on board,
and the vessel will be sold un
der the government's tough
new policy aimed at even the
most casual drug users.
The 133-foot Ark Royal, reg
istered in Delaware with its
home port in Philadelphia, was
•eiaed Saturday in interna
tional waters between Mexico
and Cuba after Coast Guard
officers found a butt of a ma
rijuana cigarette in a trash can
and a small amount of mari
juana in a stateroom, Coast
Guard officials in Miami said.
The Coast Guard can legally
board U.S.-flagged vessels in
international waters.

None of the six people on
board was arrested, Coast
Guard press representative
Lou Parris said. He declined
to identify them, but said the
boat is registered to a Delaware
business, the Tomima Corp.
The boat, under a Coast Guard
escort, was headed for Key
West. Parris said the six on
board would be released there.
The Associated Press quoted
Coast Guard Lt. John Felker
in Miami as saying that neither
the yacht's registered owner,
Michael Rogerson, described by
the Coast Guard as the presi
dent and chief shareholder of
Tomima Corp., nor any pas
sengers were on board. Appar
ently only the crew was on
board.
