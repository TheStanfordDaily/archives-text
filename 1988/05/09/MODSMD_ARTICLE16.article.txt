# Regan exposes Reagans
## Former aide's new book excerpted in Time 
### 
WASHINGTON — First lady Nancy
Reagan is portrayed in a forthcoming book
by former White House chief of staff
Donald Regan as a willful, conniving
woman who cleverly manipulates the pres
ident and has so little regard for others
that she heartlessly demanded CIA Direc
tor William Casey's resignation shortly
before he died of a brain tumor.
As excerpted in Time magazine's May
16 issue published today, the book contains
the most unflattering account ever pub
lished of Mrs. Reagan's behavior as first
lady and is certain to revive the public
debate over whether she has too much
influence on the president and his policies.
Regan, embittered by Mrs. Reagan's role
in forcing him to resign Feb. 27, 1985,
after more than a year as chief of staff
and four years as secretary of the treasury,
also discloses for the first time that the
president's schedule is virtually dictated
by the forecasts of an astrologer whom the
first lady consults by telephone from Camp
David, Md., every Saturday.
The astrologer, to whom Mrs. Reagan
frequently referred in discussions with

Regan as her "friend," was identified by
Time as San Francisco socialite Joan
Quigley, whom Time described as a well
coiffed woman not unlike many of the first
lady's California friends.
Quigley told Reuters yesterday that she
had advised Mrs. Reagan on scheduling
events at the White House. But she em
phasized: "I never make decisions for my
clients."
The book also offers new proof of tension
between Mrs. Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev,
wife of the Soviet leader, which has often
been denied by the White House. After an
evening with the Gorbachevs in which
Raisa lectured the president about the So
viet system, for example, the first lady
bitterly remarked to Regan: "Who does
that dame think she is?"
It also contradicts Mrs. Reagan's oft
stated contention that she never interferes
with the conduct of administration policy.
Whenever the president resisted her advice,
Regan said, the first lady used former
White House aide Michael Deaver and
others to manipulate her husband.
