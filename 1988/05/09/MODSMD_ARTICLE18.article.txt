## A 						primary right 
### 
Register to vote. Today
is the mailing deadline to
put your name on the rolls
to vote in the California primary
June 7. Tables are located in White
Plaza if assistance is needed. Or
you can drive to San Jose and reg
ister in person until 5 p.m. Friday
at the Santa Clara County
Registrar of Voters.
To vote for a particular national
or local candidate in the primary,
you must register with that can
didate's party. No crossover voting
is allowed.
It is legal to register here even
if your home state is not California.
Stanford has traditionally ig
nored the primary. Santa Clara
County figures show that only
2,800 Stanford voters registered
here in 1986 and just over 800
ended up casting a ballot. This elec
tion deserves special consideration
because both Republicans and
Democrats have some interesting
choices before them.
On the Republican side, local
politics dominates the scene. U.S.
Rep. Ernie Konnyu, a first-term
incumbent in the 12th Congres
sional District, faces a tough fight
from Stanford Law Prof. Tom
Campbell. The most recent Camp
bell poll shows Konnyu to be a few
percentage points ahead of the
challenger.
If district history is any indica
tion, the Republican primary will
probably decide the race. For over
20 years, the GOP has represented
this area.
It is unusual for an incumbent

to have a strong challenger within
the party. Konnyu has suffered
image problems from allegations
last year — which he vigorously
denies — that he sexually harassed
female staffers in his office.
Campbell has had difficulties of
his own. Some have charged that
he lets former Rep. Pete McClos
key be his "hatchet man," attack
ing Konnyu personally, while
Campbell takes the high road and
only talks about issues.
Some campus Democrats are
even considering the option of
registering Republican for the pri
mary so they can vote for Camp
bell. The 12th District, they argue,
will always be Republican, and
Konnyu should be ousted at all
costs.
However, other Democrats claim
that the party has a viable slate
of congressional candidates this
year and those newly registered
Republicans will have to sacrifice
voting in the Dukakis-Jackson race
for the Democratic presidential
nomination, a battle that is not
yet over.
California appears to be Jack
son's last, best hope to capture a
significant number of delegates.
Although Massachusetts Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis appears to have
sewn up the Democratic presiden
tial nomination, California Demo
crats could dramatically affect the
tone of the party convention if they
send some sort of mandate to the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Either way, make your decision
and sign up.
