# Theme houses draw little interest in Round One
## 558 and Storey House top the charts 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
This fall's closing of popular
Roble Hall intensified the first
round competition in the
Housing Draw for spots in 558
Mayfield and Storey House,
which for the second consecu
tive year were first and second,

respectively, in popularity.
Cutoff numbers for 558 were
104 for men, compared to 241
last year, and 102 for women,
compared to 159 last year. Fig
ures this year for Storey were
178 for men and 517 for women.
Last year recorded 366 for men
and 480 for women.
While the cutoff for almost

every residence was lower, co
ops and thpme hou c ? sti 1 '
97 vacancies, 20 more than last
year. This is a serious concern
for Rodger Whitney, director of
student housing, who said he is
most disappointed with the
results for Slavianskii Dom, the
East European theme house,
formerly called Hurlburt. That

house still has 29 vacancies for
me., ind women.
However, Whitney said the
house is not in jeopardy of losing
its theme status. He speculated
that the empty spaces arose be
cause this is the first year for
the program and the house did

not get enough students with
priorities.
"Maybe their advertising didn't
get off the ground," he said.
Whitney said he was surprised
by the cutoff numbers for Casa
Zapata, in Stern Hall. With a
cutoff of 1,494 for men and 2,923
for women, the dorm showed a
marked increase in popularity
from last year, when both num
bers were in the 2,9005.
Because of new graduate stu
dent housing scheduled to open
in the fall, this year's cutoff num
bers will not spell especially tough
times for unguaranteed students,
Whitney said. Many graduate stu
dents who would have taken
spaces in residences such as the
Manzanita trailers and Crothers
Memorial will now be spread out
in the new housing.
"There should be the same
number of spaces left over for
unguaranteed people ... if not
more," Whitney said. At the be
ginning of this academic year,

roughly 500 students with un
guaranteed status were placed on
campus.
William Georges, assistant di
rector of housing, said the
Housing Center has already
begun to place unguaranteed
women. The center will not begin
to place men until after Round
Two, because many who place in
the first round drop out of the
Draw to join fraternities. Whitney
said the center will not know how
many they can place until over
the summer, and advised unguar
anteed students to "keep things
flexible."
Undergraduate Housing Super
visor Susan Birkenseer said now
that students have Round One
results, they "need to look at their
choices" and "decide if they want
to accept their draw number." Ac
cording to the center, students
should keep in mind that about
400 people of 4,168 who entered
the Draw will drop out of the first
round to become resident assis
tants, join fraternities or travel
overseas.
However, she cautioned that
students should not simply sub
tract 400 from their number be

cause they cannot determine what
numbers the drop-outs have.
Students now have three
choices when they see where they
placed in the Draw. Options in
clude:
• Accepting the assignment;
• Dropping out of the Draw; or
• Being considered for Round
Two, at which time all assign
ments are permanent.
May 12 is the last date for stu
dents to decide between these
three options. If students want to
enter Round Two, they do not
have to do anything because they
are automatically entered. Those
who want to accept their assign
ment in Round One or drop out
of the Draw must complete Draw
Card Two,
The results for Round Two will
be posted in the center office on
May 24.
Whitney said that there are
committees working on plans to
establish four years of guaranteed
housing at Stanford. He said that
with about 400 to 450 more
spaces, the University could guar
antee housing for four years for
all undergraduates.
