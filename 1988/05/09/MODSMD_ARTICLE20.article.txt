## We're all immigrants

CC X"T TELCOME to California.
XIXI Now Go Home." For four
Y T years at Brown University,
I kept this bumper sticker on my desk
for all my Eastern friends to see.
This was my answer to their jokes
about the anti-intellectualist, live-for-the
babes-beach-and-beer atmosphere that
they "knew" pervaded the West Coast.
If you don't like America's Garden of
Eden, then go back to your sub-zero,
cramped and snobby lifestyles.
It was the old Arab maxim applied to
California: A Los Angelino against a San
Diegan. A Los Angelino and a San Diegan
against a San Franciscan. A Los Angelino,
a San Diegan and a San Franciscan
against all non-Californians.
For all my statist rhetoric and sunshine
saber-rattling, however, I did not really
think that Californians were inherently
superior to any other members of the
Union or of the world, for that matter.
Since the welcome mat was laid out
for my family almost 40 years ago, no
one has questioned my family's ability
and right to stake its claim in the City
of Angels.
For certain immigrant groups, though,
this questioning of their right to be a
Californian has plagued their lives since
they crossed the state's borders. It seems
to be the fate of every new immigrant
group that they are looked upon as the
"threat" by other immigrant groups who
have had to struggle to become part of
the accepted society. If you gain, I must
lose, or so goes the zero-sum equation.
This questioning of an immigrant's
right to join mainstream society appears

to be inversely proportional to the state's
or country's level of economic and social
prosperity.
The worse off the country is socially
and economically, the more likely the
"outsider" will not be accepted. France
provides an excellent current example of
this hypothesis.
In the first round of the French pres
idential elections two weeks ago, Jean-
Marie Le Pen, the leader of the right-wing
National Front party, emerged with 14.4
percent of the vote.
Over 4.4 million people cast their bal
lots for a politician whose principal mes
sage is to evict the 3.9 million immigrants
in France who are allegedly responsible
for the crime, unemployment, housing
shortages, an inefficient social security
system, poorly performing schools,
crowded hospitals and AIDS.
The danger of Le Pen's "Welcome to
France. Now Go Home" bumper sticker
is that it is not treated as good-natured
sparring between college dormmates but
as a serious solution to France's problems
by a significant number of blue-collar
workers, unemployed people, shop
keepers, small farmers and young people
facing a tight job market.
Rather than being branded a pariah in
French politics, Le Pen has been given
legitimacy by the voters and politicians
alike. He has found an easy and appealing
scapegoat, the Arab immigrants, for his
country's ills â€” just as Adolf Hitler used
the Jews to explain Germany's post-
World War I economic and social
maladies.
In treating "outsiders" as the "real"
problem and their expulsion as the "logi

cal" solution, Le Pen voices a modern
sentiment that has not been confined to
France. One sees these nationalist
bumper stickers spreading throughout
many European and African countries as
the immigrant populations swell while
their economies shrink.
Israeli Knesset Member Meir Kahane's
answer for Israeli-Arab relations is to
kick all Arabs out of the Jewish state.
Palestinian leaders have countered with
similar proposals to remove all Jews from
the Palestinian state.
In dealing with its "outsiders," Califor
nians can retract their welcome mat and
blame groups like Latinos, blacks and
Asians for the state's escalating crime
rate, overcrowded public schools and
inner-city turmoil.
As a state of immigrants, however, we
must not succumb to the easy scapegoat
answer but work to allow the same access
to the state's opportunities for recent
immigrants that our families received
when they arrived. The Californian
maxim should conclude: A Los Angelino,
a San Diegan and a San Franciscan
against the Le Pens and Kahanes of this
world.
