## Attacks on current democratic system unjustified 
### 
Doug Thompson grandly
asserted May 3 that "anti
democratic" tactics are of no
significance in dealing with minority
causes because "bourgeois democracy
means democracy for the oppressors
and dictatorship over the oppressed."
This is another instance of that
peculiarly airheaded left-wing logic that
accepts the proposition that reasoned
argument means nothing when a
hackneyed Marxist slogan is readily
available.
Slogans, after all, do not require
thought or justification. They stand on
their own as self-evident laws of na
ture — at least to the faithful.
By denouncing "bourgeois democra
cy," Thompson must have some alter
native in mind — presumably some

sort of "revolutionary democracy." It is
always pleasant, of course, to divert
oneself with dreams of "revolutionary"
justice.
That is one of the primary preoc
cupations of the left. It is also, of
course, unfortunate and inconvenient
when history, with annoying regularity,
comes along to deflate these airy bal
loons, which require only endless
amounts of hot air to remain aloft.
What is the reality of revolutionary
"justice" and "democracy?" What are
the historical models that Thompson
might put forward to support his
unspoken assumption that there is a
democracy superior to what he so
disdainfully labels "bourgeois"?
The fact is that every revolutionary
"people's democracy" has ended in

brutal oppression and that "justice,"
racial or otherwise, has never been its
primary preoccupation.
If Thompson does, in fact, have
actual historical precedents, what are
they? Why do radicals of his kind
never divulge these examples of histori
cal "justice" and "democracy?" Is it
perhaps because they don't exist? Or
are we just to accept their future
reality on a naive faith in resounding
slogans?
When fanatics like Thompson come
along and cheerfully tell us to abandon
our admittedly imperfect "bourgeois
democracy" let us remember the les
sons that history teaches us. Let us
think before we blithely swallow such
inanities as "bourgeois democracy

means democracy for the oppressors
and dictatorship over the oppressed."
If the revolution should ever come,
we know very well who will be exercis
ing "democracy" at that point — the
general secretaries, the bureaucrats,
the ideologues such as Thompson —
but certainly not the "people."
Radicals seem to fear nothing. That
is because they do not choose to live
in a world of historical reality and
practical consequences, but prefer to
gather a store of political slogans and
postulates based on their purely prag
matic needs of the moment. Fanaticism
thrives precisely where the cumber
some and imperfect processes of de
mocracy are rejected.
