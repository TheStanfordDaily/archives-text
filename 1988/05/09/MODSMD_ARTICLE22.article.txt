# BSU should help whole community
## 
### 
With the end of ASSU elections, and
the realization that the Black Student
Union was almost denied ASSU fund
ing (which would not have left it with
out funds to work with), tempers seem
to be running high, along with many
accusations of racism.
Doug Thompson's May 3 letter is no
exception. He seemed to be implying
that the main reason for the near
failure of BSU funding was a result of
latent racism.
I cannot speak for anyone else, but
my reasons for not supporting the
funding of the BSU had to do with my
perception of it as being an organiza
tion which, in the past year, has not
positively contributed to community
awareness of the problems of being a
minority in American society today.
I say "positively" because the ten
dency of the BSU is to make itself

autonomous, almost an exclusive asso
ciation from the rest of the Stanford
community.
For instance, I was extremely dis
turbed by the way Martin Luther King
Jr.'s birthday was celebrated. King is
an individual who represents the
struggle for civil rights.
Yet, the entire focus of the BSU and
its programs for that week was not to
make students aware of the continuing
civil rights movements as much as it
was to lift up a black martyr (as if he
were the only individual to push for
civil rights).
People need to realize that he was
not striving for the rights of blacks
alone, but for all of the downtrodden.
This is just one example of the BSU's
misdirection.
I feel that if the BSU ever wants to
be a truly effective organization, it
must look above the issue of color, and
look at the real issues of rights and
exploitation occuring even today.
Until it shows me that it can truly
do this, and that it wants to share a

part of the responsibility of being a
positively contributing part of the
Stanford community, I will continue to
vote down its funding.
As to the question of funding being
guaranteed for minority groups on
campus, I feel that that is a very dan
gerous and un worth while proposal.
Personally, I vote with the idea that a
group that positively contributes to the
Stanford community should receive
funding.
I dd not vote against minority
groups, or any other groups for that
matter, on racist perceptions. I did not
vote for the Chaparral because it per
forms no useful function for the Stan
ford community.
If my right to vote where my money
goes were taken away, I would be
greatly disturbed. It would mean that
groups like the BSU would have free
reign to make themselves an autono
mous unit from the rest of the Stan
ford community, which, in my belief,
would harm both it and us.
This ability to vote allows groups

such as the BSU to know when we
feel that the programs which they are
proposing are no longer productive to
the community as a whole. That's the
whole idea behind a democratic voting
process.
I contributed to those funds in the
form of ASSU dues, and I therefore
feel that I should have a say in the
way they are used.
If groups such as the BSU want
funds to support programs that are
not conducive to helping the Stanford
community grow, then I feel that those
funds should come out of their own
pockets.
Their membership can foot the bill
for these programs. We are saying that
we won't support them. What the past
elections are really telling groups such
as the BSU is to re-evaluate their pro
grams and policies, and ask whether
they are being constructive or destruc
tive to the community within which
they live.
