## Going for gold in a special way 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Not all Olympians going for the gold are
headed to Seoul, Korea. Some will reach for
their best right here at Stanford.
More than 225 mentally retarded athletes
will be diving into deGuerre Pool, celebrating
on the campus' lacrosse fields and feeling like
winners at the seventh annual Stanford Spe
cial Olympics on May 15.
Ranging from age 8 to 50, the athletes are
Santa Clara County residents faced with
varying degrees of mental retardation. There
are 16 different schools and agencies for men
tally retarded individuals in the county, each
sporting a team at Sunday's competition.
Stanford's Special Olympics is one of 100
different local competitions held throughout
the country. Through the local meets, Special
Olympic athletes can aspire to national and
international levels of competition.
But most athletes at Stanford's games are
just coming to have fun. "Anybody who par
ticipates is a winner and nobody puts pressure
on them," said junior Hubert Ho, student
coordinator for this year's competitions.
Some athletes must live in wheelchairs but
compete in the swimming events by wearing
life vests. "They are all very brave," said Ho,
who has helped out at three Stanford Olym
pics.
Remembering one Special Olympic athlete
named Bill, Ho described him as "really fiery."
Ho said he dared Bill to "catch up" with him
in the pool during one of the competitions.
"Bill was trying so hard that I was actually
having trouble getting ahead of him," Ho
recalled.
He and about 30 other Stanford students
have been working together throughout the
year organizing the event, which is completely
run and funded by Stanford students. "We
get all of our money from student groups,"
Ho said, explaining that this year dorms con
tributed $2,500 and the Business and Law
School student groups each contributed
$1,000 for the event.
Student efforts are most evident at the ac
tual competition. Each athlete is paired with
a Stanford "buddy" who "encourages and
hangs out with the [athlete] for the whole
day," according to Ho. Students can shout
out cheers for the competitors or lend physical
support by pulling swimmers along on kick
boards.
Ho encouraged all students to "drop by for
the day" or to come to volunteer orientation

meetings held tonight and tomorrow night at
7:30. "We are shooting for about 300 to 400
volunteers," he said.
The Band will also be at the competition,
ready to pump up the athletes with inspira
tional music. Rock bands will be there as well,
giving participants a chance to relax and cel
ebrate. A dunking booth and face painting
should also add to the day's liveliness.

While competitors placing in the top eight
receive ribbons, all athletes will be awarded
participant medals. But perhaps the most
meaningful reward will go to the student vol
unteers.
"I went in kind of stereotyping them," Ho
explained. "But they exude a very genuine
feeling. They are athletes who love what they
do."
