# Seniors rate Farm

Farewell, seniors â€” almost.
As that day approaches quickly
when the eldest members of
the undergraduate population
will be entering the real world,
they are being asked to reflect
on their years here at Stanford
in the 1988 Senior Survey.
On March 31, The Daily in
correctly reported that this
year's survey had already been
completed. The printed results
were actually taken from the
1987 Senior Survey.
The survey, conducted an
nually for over 12 years, un
derwent renovations and
took on new purpose three
years ago. Traditionally, the
survey included questions
related only to academic expe
riences and future work or
school plans. Now it is now
much broader, dealing with
most aspects of student
life here on the Farm.
Extra-curricular activities,
volunteer work, overseas
studies and the University's
ability to nurture such things
as the "exploration of ethnic
diversity" are all topics ad
dressed in the attempt to gain
as much information as possi
ble about the Stanford experi
ence.
The survey is designed by
the Educational Research
Group, a committee composed
of representatives from numer
ous administrative offices. Sur
vey questions are contributed
by over 15 campus groups.
It is "designed as a dynamic
instrument to respond to the
needs of various University of
ficers and committees," ex
plained Ann Porteus, chair of
ERG. She stressed that the re
sponses "are taken seriously"
by University officials.
Registrar Sally Mahoney
pointed out that "responses
from the late 1970s played an
important role in the [re
designing] of the distribution
requirement system."

In the 1987 survey,
43 percent of the
seniors found the
general academic
advising "poor" and
25 percent de
scribed it as "fair."

Responses in the past few
years have included complaints
that the financial aid program
is insufficient for students to
take advantage of public serv
ice programs, overseas studies
and research and summer in
ternships.
Another theme that has con
sistently arisen over the years,
according to Mahoney, is stu
dent dissatisfaction with the
freshman advising system and
advising within the mtgors. In
the 1987 survey, 43 percent of
the seniors found the general
academic advising "poor" and
25 percent described it as
"fair."
In the past few years, stu
dents have expressed that they
would like to see more oppor
tunities for independent
studies and research as well as
increased one-on-one interac
tion with faculty members.
The survey has expanded to
11 pages, but Porteus said the
response has remained con
stant at about 34 percent.
To encourage completion of
the survey, the senior class
presidents held a Senior Survey
Celebration on May sth. Tick
ets were obtained by turning
in the surveys by this time.
The final deadline is May 11th,
though surveys turned in late
will be accepted.
Porteus said the survey is
often not representative of the
entire class, and responses
from minority students are
particularly low. "We want to
hear from everyone," Porteus
re-emphasized.
