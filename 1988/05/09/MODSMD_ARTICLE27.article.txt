## Cal takes two of three from Card Stanford wins the battle but loses the war 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
BERKELEY - The Stan
ford and California baseball
teams came to blows yester
day, and when the dust
cleared, the Golden Bears
were the ones standing,
coming away with a 4-1 win

at Evans Diamond.
The game was marred by a huge, bench
clearing brawl in the seventh inning, but
the real story was the strong pitching of
the Bears and the impotence of the Car
dinal offense. After pounding out 14 hits
in a 13-3 rout of the Bears on Saturday,
Stanford could manage only five hits yes
terday against starter Mike Mathews and
reliever Joe Buckley.
Cal didn't do much better offensively,
but capitalized on a Cardinal fielding error
and some pitching charity on the way to
three unearned runs in the crucial seventh
inning.
Stanford, meanwhile, stranded eight run
ners in the game and squandered a bases
loaded, one-out opportunity in the eighth
inning.
"We had a lot of opportunities and just
couldn't produce," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said.
"I was just happy we came out (on Sat
urday) and played well," catcher Doug Rob
bins said. "I thought it would carry over,
but obviously it didn't. ... It's still kind
of a mystery . . . we've been so inconsis
tent."
Yesterday's loss, combined with an 8-3
defeat Friday and the win on Saturday,
moves the Cardinal's record to 33-21 over
all and 15-12 in the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division. Stanford is alone in
second place, a half-game ahead of Cal
(36-23, 16-14). With Stanford's loss Friday,
Arizona State clinched the conference title.
Cal has completed its Six-Pac schedule,
while the Cardinal closes with a three-game
set at home against fourth-place USC next
weekend.
Yesterday's game was tied 1-1 through
six innings, as freshman starter Stan Spen

cer of Stanford dueled Matthews and Buck
ley. Steve Chitren came on in relief of
Spencer — who gave up only four hits —
in the sixth with two on and no outs and
escaped with only one run of damage done.
Chitren didn't fare as well in the seventh.
The junior hit Darryl Vice with a pitch to
open the inning, then walked Brian Scott.
After Mike Muhlethaler struck out, soph
omore shortstop Troy Paulsen bobbled Dar
ren Lewis's grounder deep in the hole, and
the bases were loaded with one out.
Chitren walked the next batter, Todd
Mayo, to force in a run and make the score
2-1. That brought up Bart Frets, who
worked the count full and then bounced a
ball back to the mound.
Chitren gloved the ball and threw to
Robbins for the force at home. Scott, the
runner coming in from third, went hard
into Robbins to disrupt the double play
attempt. Robbins appeared to knee or kick
Scott in the back after he had been called
out, and hoine-plate umpire Kevin Gilmour
immediately gave Robbins the heave-ho.
An instant later, Robbins and Scott were
scuffling, and that brought both teams out
of their dugouts for a free-for-all battle
near the pitcher's mound.
Police officers came on the field to help
break up the fight, which delayed the game
about 10 minutes. Only Robbins, a senior,
was ejected and no players appeared to be
injured. Stanfor d equipment manager Matt
Ritson suffered bruised ribs.
When play resumed, the bases were still
loaded, now with two outs. The next batter,
Pete Fondersmith, ripped a pinch-hit
double down the left-field line, bringing in
Lewis and Mayo to give Cal a 4-1 lead.
The Cardinal loaded the bases with one
out in the eighth on two singles and a
walk, but Buckley induced sophomore
pinch-hitter Tim Griffin to ground into an
inning-ending double play.
Stanford put another runner on in the
ninth, but he died there, too.
The fight was the culmination of tensions
which had been brewing between the Car
dinal and the Golden Bears all weekend.


Richard Murphy — Daily
Senior catcher Doug Robbins was the center of attention in this weekend's series with California. First, a Cal pitcher
threw a pitch three feet behind him Friday. Next, Robbins was accused of taunting Bear players while rounding the
bases after a Paul Carey homer Saturday. Finally, he was bowled over by a Cal runner trying to score yesterday, an
altercation that started a bench-clearing brawl resulting in a 10-minute stoppage of play.
