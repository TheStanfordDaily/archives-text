69, the Cardinal women are right in the middle
of the lead pack heading into today's final
round "doubleheader" in the California Inter
collegiate at the par-73 Stanford Golf Course.
Today's final 36 holes will be played in a
double shotgun format, starting at 8:00 a.m.
and 1:00 p.m.
Cornelius' 69 was only the seventh com
petitive sub-70 round in the course's history,
according to Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin. It
was the lowest round she has shot on the

Stanford course in her four years on the Farm.
Other players that have scored below 70 in
clude current LPGA tour players Patty Shee
han and Juli Inkster, as well as Stanford
players Julie Carmichael and three-time Ail-
American Kathleen McCarthy.
"Kay (Cornelius) played First Team All-
American golf today," Baldwin said.
The competitive course record is 65, held
by Rita Moore of Texas Christian. Moore's
younger sister, Adele, was the nation's top
recruit this year and will be coming to the
Farm next year.
Cornelius turned the front nine in even
par, bogeying the second hole and coming
right back with a birdie on the tight, par-3
third hole.
On the fourth she hit her approach shot
long, but managed to get up-and-down in two,
sinking a 20-foot putt to save par. She also
saved par twice from the sand on the day.

Today was the first time
that I didn't really choke. I
was just hitting the ball
well.'
— Kristen Ryan

Her 4-under-par 33 on the back nine was
nearly flawless, as she dropped birdie putts
on the 10th and 13th holes and went on to
finish with consecutive birdies on 17 and 18.
"I didn't putt exceptionally well," she said.
"I was just hitting (approach shots) to 10 or
15 feet from the flagstick."
"It was an easy 69," she added. "It could've
been much lower, but I'm more than pleased."
Freshman Kristin Ryan turned in her finest
performance of the year, shooting a much
needed 74, despite a double bogey on the
ninth hole.
"Today was the first time that I didn't
really choke," she said. "I was just hitting
the ball well."
Fellow freshman Jodi Figley, fighting to
retain her spot on the All-America Second
Team, did not help her cause today, slipping
to an 81.
"I just didn't hit it well at all today," she
said.
"I'm confident that she (Figley) can turn
it around and maybe even get back to even
par," Baldwin added.
Freshman Michele Lyford turned in a solid
performance, shooting 81 to bring the team's
total to 305 for the day.
Baldwin believes that for his team to move
into 14th place in the national rankings,
thereby earning an automatic NCAA Cham
pionship bid, they will have to shoot 305 or
better on all three rounds. "One down, two
to go," he said of his team's performance
today.
Cornelius sits atop the leader board, with
Long Beach State's Donna Watson one stroke
back. The rest of the leader board contains
some all-too-familiar names. San Jose State's
Dana Lofland and Pat Hurst are tied for third
at 72 with UCLA's Jean Zedlitz.
Zedlitz's teammate Valerie Pamard is all
alone in sixth at 73, with San Diego State's
Wendy Modic, U.S. International's Helen
Alfredson and Ryan tied for seventh at 74.
Oregon's Diana Lewton shot a first-round
75 to tie her for 10th with Tupito Walker
and Allison Shapcott, both of USIU.
The team standings are equally bunched at
the top, with any six of the top nine teams
still in the running for the tournament cham
pionship.
UCLA (300) holds a slim four-stroke lead
over SJSU, with Stanford and USIU tied for
third at 305. SDSU is another stroke back at
306, with Long Beach State bringing up the
rear of the lead pack at 311.
Oregon shot a 328 yesterday, Pepperdine a
341 and Oregon State a 358 to round out the
nine-team field.
According to Baldwin, any of the players
on the leader board can win the individual
title, but Cornelius, playing her final regular
season tournament of her collegiate career
and trying to make First Team All-America,
has to be the favorite.
