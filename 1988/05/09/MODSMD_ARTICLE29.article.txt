# Track's parade gets rained on
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
| The first omen
came when
Stanford high
jumper Brian
Marshall was
scratched in
Saturday's

Modesto Invitational track and
field meet. Then the rains
came, and when they finally
left, Stanford's split squad,
made up primarily of jumpers,
never regained its timing.
According to Stanford Asst.
Coach Scott Chisam, Marshall,
a senior, "hurt his back" and
did not want to risk aggrava
tion in an unimportant compe
tition, and none of the other
athletes was able to achieve
qualifying marks for the Pacific
10 Conference Championships.
Sophomore Venessa Henlon
was the top Stanford per
former, placing second in the
triple jump. Henlon had her
second-best jump of the season
at 40 feet, three and one
quarter inches, but is still
looking to add half a foot to
her best and qualify for the
NCAA Championship meet.
The women's triple jump
started early, and thus Henlon
was the only jumper to finish
before the rains came down.
Eric Mastalir posted the top
performance on the track, run
ning third in the invitational

3,000 meters. Mastalir, a red
shirt freshman, came through
with an 8-minute, 14.3-second
performance. Mastalir also
owns the team's fastest 5,000
meter time of 14:07.0, which
is 10 seconds off the NCAA
Championship qualifying time.
Stanford also sent a small
contingent to Ohio over the
weekend to run in the Jesse
Owens meet. Junior Erica
Wheeler was entered in the
high jump, while junior Lisa
Bernhagen was high jumping
and junior Glenn Schneider
competed in the throwing
events.
Freshman Jason Martin had
a strong race in the 3,000-
meter steeplechase after win
ning the event against Califor
nia last weekend. Martin has
come on strong in the steeple
chase, lowering his personal
best by a quarter of a minute
to 9:09.8. Another freshman,
John Hopkins, looked good
clearing in the high jump
and was about to make an at
tempt at two inches higher
when the drizzle began. The
one-hour delay affected his
form, and he missed his final
attempts.
The team is in the Pac-10
preparation phase of its season.
This Saturday's Sacramento
State meet will be what Chisam
termed a "last chance" race for
those who have not yet made
the racing team
