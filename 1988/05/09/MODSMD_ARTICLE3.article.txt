In an effort to remain compet
itive with rivals such as UC-
Berkeley, Harvard, Yale and MIT,
University officials plan to in
crease the amount of money al
located for faculty salaries by 5.6
percent next year.
Although Stanford pays profes
sional salaries that are above na
tional averages, officials say the
increases are necessary for Stan
ford to remain competitive in at
tracting and keeping top profes
sors.
"We pay close attention to fac
ulty salaries because they are the

key to competing," said Tim
Warner, associate provost and di
rector of budgets. "Salaries are
critical in retaining and attracting
faculty."
Stanford boasts higher salaries
than most other universities, ac
cording to Provost Office figures
reported in a survey sponsored by
the American Association of Uni
versity Professors released this
month.
Stanford professors earned an
average of $70,800 in 1987-88,
$19,720 more than the average
professorial salary at other uni
versities that award doctoral
degrees. Associate and assistant

professors here also exceeded the
average earnings of their peers by
$12,770 and $8,120, respectively.
Stanford, second only to Har
vard, pays its professors more
than UC-Berkeley, Yale and MIT.
Associate and assistant professors
here earn more than their col
leagues at those four institutions.
Stanford also conducts its own
salary surveys each year to deter
mine where the University stands
in relation to its competition.
University Provost James
Rosse, who approves individual
faculty salaries and presented the
1988-89 budget to the Faculty
Senate on Thursday, stressed that

Stanford attempts to compete
with the "top 20" universities.
"We are not concerned with what
the University of Nevada pays,"
he said.
The AAUP survey distin
guished between professors, asso
ciate professors and assistant pro
fessors. According to Warner, the
distinctions between a professor,
associate professor and assistant
professor at Stanford are based
on ability, experience and achieve
ment.
At Stanford, individuals are
generally promoted from assistant
