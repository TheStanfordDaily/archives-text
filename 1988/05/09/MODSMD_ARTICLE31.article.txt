# Winning Colors takes the Derby
## 
### 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Win
ning Colors withstood a des
perate stretch rally by Forty
Niner on Saturday and became
the third filly to win the Ken
tucky Derby.
She took the lead at the
break and it looked for a time
as if she might cruise to an
easy victory. But as the wire
approached, it looked as if
Forty Niner might catch her.
The colt ran out of room.
The exciting victory was the
first in the Derby for trainer
D. Wayne Lukas, who was
making his eighth consecutive
appearance. She was his 13th
starter in those eight races.
Risen Star finished third in
the field of 17 3-year-olds that
went to the post for the
$786,200 Derby on a bright 80-

degree day at Churchill Downs.
In joining Regret, 1915, and
Genuine Risk, 1980, Winning
Colors carried Gary Stevens
over the IV< miles in 2:02 1/5
under 121 pounds. Her male
rivals each carried 126.
"She has the face of a
princess, the butt of a washer
woman and the walk of a
hooker," is the way Lukas de
scribed her. Saturday, Winning
Colors had the stride of cham
pion.
"She did it," said Stevens,
who was riding in his fourth
Derby. "I didn't. I was a pas
senger."
He must have been a very
nervous passenger indeed in
the closing yards of the 114 th
Derby.
