# Crews tune up for a title run
## 
### Don Hogue Staff writer 
Although Stan
ford's women's
crew teams
have had a
tough time
facing some of
the nation's top

crews throughout the season,
Santa Clara had an even
tougher time with Stanford.
The Cardinal took each of Sat
urday's dual races at Redwood
Shores, winning the varsity,
junior varsity and both novice
races.
Meanwhile, Stanford's var
sity men took time off this
weekend to polish the freshly
reclaimed Jim Reynolds Cup as
the freshmen and novice crews
headed north for a final dual
matchup at UC-Davis.
"It's good to go out and know
we can win," Stanford women's
coach John Davis said of his
varsity, which has rowed intact
for only two of the past six
weeks. Stanford jumped to an
early lead in the varsity race,
holding a boat-length lead un
der the bridge at the halfway
point. Santa Clara surged near
the finish, but Stanford main
tained its lead, winning by four
seconds.
"We're really rowing well, al
though it's only the second day
we've really been rowing to
gether," junior coxswain Quen
tin Story said. Although the
varsity rowed at a low rate of
32 strokes per minute during
much of the race, Story said
that the crew seemed comfort
able picking up the rate at the
sprint. Earlier in the day, the
junior varsity also appeared
comfortable, claiming a 28-
second victory over Santa
Clara.
Coach Wendy Davis' novice
crews continued their domina
tion of the West Coast with a
convincing 17-second victory in
the first-novice race and a 25-
second margin in the second

novice race. Sporting flowery,
multi-colored "Jerry Garcia"
hats purchased outside the
Grateful Dead concert last
weekend, the first-novice ex
tended its winning streak to
5-0, including a gold medal per
formance at the San Diego
Crew Classic.
The Pacific Coast Champi
onships in two weeks will be a
showdown for the West Coast's
unbeaten women's novice
crews, as Stanford will face
also-unbeaten Washington.
The Huskies defeated Califor
nia by 11 seconds this weekend
at the Oakland Estuary. Last
weekend, Stanford had
defeated Cal by two seconds,
but in extremely rough condi
tions on the Estuary.
At UC-Davis' home course
on the Sacramento Ship Canal,
Stanford's freshmen-eight men
dominated the Aggies, winning
by 10 lengths in a time of six
minutes, 40 seconds. In the
novice-eight, Stanford sprinted
from a four-seat deficit, but
lost by less than the length of
a bow-ball to Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo in a photo-finish. Stan
ford's time was 6:44.03 to Cal
Poly's winning time of 6:44.00.
In the novice-four, Stanford
reduced Cal-Maritime's open
water lead at the halfway mark
to pull within three seats at
the finish, edging third-place
Davis.
"It was a great final tune-up
for the Pacific Coast Champi
onships," men's coach Ken
Dreyfuss said. "It looks like
they'll be in the thick of things
in two weeks. The novice-eight
rowed against a (Cal Poly) crew
which looks like one of the fast
est crews at this time."
Stanford will travel to the
Pacific Coast Championships
in Sacramento, May 21-22. The
event features the top crews
from the West Coast, and the
winner of each division will ad
vance to the respective men's
and women's national champi
onships.
