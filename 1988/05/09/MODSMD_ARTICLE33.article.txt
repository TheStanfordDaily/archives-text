# Netters beat Cal just for fun
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
Everybody agrees
that the annual
Stanford-Califor
nia indoor mixed
tennis match is de
signed to be fun,
but e v -

eryone would also agree Stanford
had more fun than the Golden

Bears in the eighth annual
matchup Saturday night. The
Cardinal won each of the six sets
played en route to a 37-11 victory,
the most lopsided win ever.
This match is designed to be a
low-key end to both teams' regu
lar seasons and Stanford men's
Coach Dick Gould felt the match
was everything he hoped for.
"I think the crowd enjoyed it,"
he said. "I think the players en

joyed it. No one got hurt out
there."
Stanford got off on the right
foot in the first set, a mixed dou
bles contest between the team of
junior Cindy Buchsbaum and
sophomore Jeff Cathrall and Cal's
Jennifer Prah and Pete Fitz
patrick. The set lasted only 14
minutes before Buchsbaum vol
leyed a ball over Prah's head,
dropping it right inside the
baseline for a 6-0 win.
The second set was considerably
more exciting. Sophomore Jeff
Tarango, ranked sixth in the
country, struggled with Bear
junior Woody Hunt, ranked only
62nd nationally. Hunt broke
Tarango in the sixth game with
two amazing backhand returns to
take a 4-2 lead, then held his own
serve.
Tarango's groundstrokes re
turned at this point as he began
to move Hunt around, pressuring
him to err. Hunt did and Tarango
rattled off five straight games for
the 7-5 win.
"You play in a different man
ner," because it is only an exhibi
tion match, Tarango said. "You
try some shots you don't normally
try. We want to win it, they want
to win it, but it's laid-back. We
have a lot of fun."
The fun continued for the
Maples Pavilion crowd, the largest
to attend a Stanford-Cal mixed
match, according to Gould, as
senior Cari Hagey and freshman
Sandra Birch took the court to
face Alissa Finerman and Tiffany
Silveria. Finerman and Silveria
won the Pacific 10 Conference
doubles title two weeks ago, but
they struggled against Hagey and
Birch. The Cardinal tandem,
ranked fourth in the nation, won
all the big points to post a 6-1
win in only 20 minutes.
The pattern of this match-up
was set on the first point. After
a short exchange Hagey volleyed
a ball that hit the top of the net
and paused momentarily. Finally
the ball trickled over to the
Golden Bears' side of the net —
point Hagey and Birch. And the
two continued to be just a little
bit better throughout their unex
pectedly easy win.
The next set, men's doubles,
was more of the same. Stanford
senior Patrick McEnroe and

'We want to win it,
they want to winiift 112
but it's laidback. We
have a lot of fun.'

freshman Martin Blackman
dominated Cal's team of Carl
Chang and Ed Marcum, winning
6-2. This clinched the team com
petition for Stanford at 25-8, the
Cardinal's seventh win in the in
door series. The Golden Bears
have won only once, 35-30 last
year.
Sophomore Lisa Green, the
1988 Pac-10 singles champ, be
came the next Stanford hero,
downing Cal's Jean-Marie Lozano
6-1. The match was closer than
the score indicated, though, as six
of the seven games were won on
sudden-death, three-all points.
Freshmen Ten Whitlinger and
David Wheaton took on Sharon
Fletcher and Doug Eisenmann to
close out the night. Wheaton and
Whitlinger both appeared fully re
covered from injuries that have
sidelined them in the past month
to handily defeat Fletcher and
Eisenmann, 6-2.
"We played pretty well tonight,"
Whitlinger said in an understate
ment. "It (the format) is fun. I
like it. It gives the guys and the
girls a chance to play together."
The second-ranked (behind
Florida) women begin play in Los
Angeles at the NCAA Champion
ships Thursday, while the men
begin NCAA competition in Ath
ens, Georgia, May 21. The Cardi
nal men received all eight first
place votes in the latest poll.
"Everyone's getting a little
tired," Whitlinger said. "This is
a happy break. I think then you
come out a little relaxed on Mon
day."
Gould agreed that "it's nice to
do something where it's more
relaxed." Gould was also able to
relax throughout the match. Last
year Gould and Cal men's Coach
Scott McCain began the tradition
of awarding a tie to the winning
coach, and Gould was repaid for
his loss last year when McCain
presented him a tie after the
Green-Lozano contest.



Ken Beer — Daily
In a match full of Stanford highlights, the doubles team of freshmen
Teri Whitlinger and David Wheaton perhaps shone the brightest,
burying Cal's Sharon Fletcher and Doug Eisenman 6-2.
