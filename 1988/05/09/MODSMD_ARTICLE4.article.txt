# Crack-down on underage drinking
## Police hit parties 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Tensions between Stanford par
tygoers and police heightened this
weekend as three all-campus par
ties were visited by officers crack
ing down on underage drinking.
The unusual visits to the Friday
night parties have renewed ques
tions about the University's ac
tual policy on alcohol consump
tion.
At about 9 p.m. Friday, Stan
ford police entered Toyon Hall,
Cedro and 558 Mayfield, all of
which hosted parties that night.
The Toyon and Cedro parties
were registered with the police
beforehand. The 558 party was
not registered, but was heavily
advertised.
Student residences are not re
quired to register parties, but the
Office of Residential Education
encourages them do so as a cour
tesey to police.
At each of the parties, police
isolated one dorm resident of legal

drinking age to take responsibility
for any alcohol served. Toyon res
ident Pat Jones and Cedro Resi
dent Assistants Barb Egan and
James Tuleya said they were
taken aside by the police and
threatened with arrest if anyone
under 21 was found drinking al
cohol when police returned later.
Junior Cindy Tsay of 558 said she
was chosen and held accountable
for others with the threat of a
citation.
Although the individuals ac
cepted responsibility, Law Prof.
Robert Weisberg said they were
"not absolutely bound by their
statement" to be responsible for
the party. Although he said no
rights were violated, Weisberg
said the absolute responsibility of
the individual as a "negligent ac
complice" would be difficult to
prove in court.
Students and resident assis
tants involved charged that police
entrance of parties was a con
scious effort to intensify enforce
ment against campus drinking, if
not an entirely new policy.
Police officers claimed Friday
that their presence did not con
stitute a new enforcement policy.
Diana Conklin, associate dean of
Residential Education, also said
last night that the University's
policy on alcohol has not changed.
The policy is that individuals

are responsible for their own de
cisions whether to abide by state
law, according to Norm Robinson,
associate dean of Student Affairs,
the office that oversees Res Ed.
He said the University does not
specify enforcement guidelines for
the police.
Neither Robinson nor Conklin
would comment on the police ac
tion, and police officials were un
available over the weekend.
However, Egan, a senior, said
she was taken completely by
surprise by the police action. Fri
day night's party was the "first

time we've ever had a problem"
with police entering the residence,
Egan said.
Egan disagreed with the claim
by police Friday night that
"they've always been entering
parties" to check underage drink
ing.
Jones, a senior, said the police
action was "the entirely wrong
approach to solve the problem of
underage drinking."
The police used scare tactics to
ensure that "people serving the
alcohol were 21," Jones charged.
