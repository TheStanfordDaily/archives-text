# Statuesque support
## Gay and lesbian rally centers on Segal piece 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
Gathering before a living replica
of the still-absent George Segal
"Gay Liberation" statue, about 60
members and friends of Stan
ford's gay and lesbian community
rallied Friday to celebrate their
unity and strength.
The rally, part of a week-long
celebration of the gay and lesbian
community at Stanford, took
place at the former site of the
statue, which was vandalized and
removed for repairs last summer.
The statue has been the subject
of recent controversy as members
of the gay and lesbian community
have charged that the University
has been too slow to repair it.
The statue is currently stored in
the basement of the Stanford Art
Museum.
Steve Greene, a first-year grad
uate student in psychology,
Andrew Gans and Ann Chang,
first-year graduate students in

computer science, and Merry
Meyers, a supporter visiting from
San Diego, posed motionless for
half an hour in imitation of the
statue's four figures.
Keynote speaker Cleve Jones, a
San Francisco gay activist and
founder of the Names Project —
a quilt stitched with names of
numerous AIDS victims —
praised the progress of the Stan
ford gay and lesbian community
since he "used to hang out here
in 1973."
He joked that the community
is "better-dressed," with
"shorter" hair. Jones added
seriously that he was impressed
by the "cautiousness and clever
ness" with which the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford and
the Stanford Organization for
Lesbian and Gay Equality have
handled the statue controversy.
The campus is "much less con
frontational than it was [in the
19705]," he said.
"This situation [with the
sculpture] pisses me off to the
point of speechlessness," Jones
told the crowd. Despite the frus
tration, he said the Names Proj
ect, which has grown to about
12,000 panels in just 10 months,
has helped him to "turn [his] back
on the cynicism and despair."
"For every bigot with a hammer
or a can of spray paint, there are
many more decent American
people who want to respond in a
caring and compassionate way,"
to the gay community and the
AIDS epidemic, Jones said.
Sophomore Barb Voss, a mem
ber of the SOLGE and the GLAS,
said the statue's absence lent "a
kind of poignancy" to the rally.
The sculpture "is a symbol of our
solidarity and place on this
campus," she said. "We have to
continually keep fighting for our
place at this University, and we

shouldn't have to."
Nevertheless, Voss told the
crowd in a short speech
punctuated by frequent applause,
Stanford is "one of the most com
fortable college campuses" for
gays and lesbians in the country.
Voss praised the accomplish
ments of GLAS and SOLGE, such
as the successful campaign for a
University policy against dis
criminating on the basis of sexual
orientation.
However, there are still a lot
of issues left, she said, noting the
importance of fighting for con
fidential AIDS testing at Cowell
Health Center and removing the
military and CIA from the Career
Planning and Placement Center
because of their discrimination on
the basis of sexual preference.
Others who spoke included
1957 Stanford graduate and San
Mateo County Supervisor Tom
Nolan, who described himself as
"one of about 30 openly gay
elected officials in the United
States," and Rick Rudy, a member
of the board of directors of the
National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force.
