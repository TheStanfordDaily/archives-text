## Students ride with the blues 
### Brent Bigler 
In an effort to improve community relations with
campus police, the Panel on Student and Police
Relations yesterday designated May 9 to 31 as Police
Ride-Along month.
The panel was formed in February to facilitate
communication between the police and the Stanford
community with a focus on increased public under
standing of public safety and security matters, set
ting up Police Ride-Along month is the panel's first
real action in its effort to fulfill its charge.
Though the opportunity to accompany an officer
has been available for many years, student com
mittee member Amy Francetic said that this is the
first time the program has been publicized by the
panel.
Designed to familiarlize students with the inner
workings of a police officer's duties, the ride-along
program provides students the opportunity to spend
four hours with an officer in a patrol car.
Francetic said that she hoped that the program
would get "a good response from different student
organizations," particularly minority groups.
Because of numerous complaints of racism in
police proceedings in recent years, the panel decided
to "make sure that the different minority groups
on campus are included," said junior Jonathan Hol
loway, a panel member.
Applications for the ride-along program are avail
able in the reception area of the Office of the Dean
of Student Affairs on the third floor of Old Union.
Three shifts, starting at 1 p.m., 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.,
are offered.
