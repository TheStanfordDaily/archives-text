Call now and we'll take your application for a
Wells Fargo Visa Card owr the phone. You don't
need a 4.0 grade average either. But you do need
to be at least a sophomore at a 4-year California
college or university. And a U.S. citizen or per
manent resident with a social security number.
You must have a checking or savings account
opened at least six months ago-and be on g(X)d
terms with your bank and any creditors. That's
the fine print, mostly. So get your bank account
number and other personal information to
gether, and call l-8(X)-642-RANK today. Don't you
wish you could schedule classes this easily?
