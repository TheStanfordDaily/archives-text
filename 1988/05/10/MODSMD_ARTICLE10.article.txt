Thomas Wasow has announced
the 10 winners of his newly
created Dean's Award for Aca
demic Achievement, which aims
to honor undergraduates for out
standing academic accomplish

This year's 10 recipients —
seniors Jamie Driscoll, Yvonne
Gutierrez, Robert Jancu, Dikran

doubted all the recipients were as
impressive as they were made out
to be.
"They seem to be trying to
make people at this University
feel better about the work they're
doing, but this is not the way to
do it,"the prize winner said.
"Certainly there are a few
people doing wonderful work, but
we shouldn't have to lie to make
ourselves feel good," he said and
added that this award made the
University seem as if it is "trot
ting people out like a dog show."
Responding to these charges,
Wasow said it was the first nega

office can't know what every stu
