# Ten students win new Dean's Award

### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow has announced
the 10 winners of his newly
created Dean's Award for Aca
demic Achievement, which aims
to honor undergraduates for out
standing academic accomplish
ments and "improve the intellec
tual atmosphere" at Stanford.
This year's 10 recipients —
seniors Jamie Driscoll, Yvonne
Gutierrez, Robert Jancu, Dikran
Karagueuzian, Bill King, Sarah
I-.au and Sally Otto; junior John
Dewitt and sophomores Christo
pher Burge and Lei Zhu — have
distinguished themselves in a
number of fields, ranging from
biology and engineering to Slavic
studies and humanities.
In the past, students have been
recognized for athletics and serv
ice, but establishment of this
award marks the first general
award for academic accomplish
ments while at Stanford. Another
award, the President's Award, is
granted based on academic
criteria, but it is given only to
freshmen.
However, not everyone sees the
award as a great honor.

One of this year's recipients,
who wished to remain anon
ymous, said the award was "dis
tressing" and that he sees it as a
"movement to make this place
more intellectual, like some sort
of Eastern school."
Furthermore, the recipient
said, the presenters of his award
"lied" about his accomplishments
at the awards ceremony on April
13. "I'm a relatively good student,
but I'm not as great as they said
I was," he said, adding that he
doubted all the recipients were as
impressive as they were made out
to be.
"They seem to be trying to
make people at this University
feel better about the work they're
doing, but this is not the way to
do it,"the prize winner said.
"Certainly there are a few
people doing wonderful work, but
we shouldn't have to lie to make
ourselves feel good," he said and
added that this award made the
University seem as if it is "trot
ting people out like a dog show."
Responding to these charges,
Wasow said it was the first nega
tive reaction he had heard. "This
office can't know what every stu
dent is doing," he said. "We rely
on our faculty to tell us about
the achievements of our stu
dents." He said he "would be very
disappointed" if faculty had lied
about the students' achievements
in nominating them for the
award.
"A student who felt he'd
received an award he didn't
deserve would have been perfectly
justified to decline it," Wasow
said, adding that he wondered
why the student would be critical
of the Dean's office for giving the
award rather than of himself for
accepting an award he didn't
deserve.

"Clearly, if we're going to give
the award to five to 10 students
a year out of 6,000, it can't be
for merely doing well in classwork
or being smart; it has to be for
doing something truly extraordi
nary," Wasow said.
The honored students were cho
sen from a field of about 30 stu
dents nominated by faculty mem
bers during the winter. "Reading
through the nomination letters
was one of the most pleasant jobs
I have had (at Stanford)," Wasow
said. "It made me feel very good
about our students."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who gives quarterly service
awards that Wasow said partially
inspired him to create the aca
demic award, said he is very
pleased with the award.
"There are probably dozens of

awards of one sort or another for
various types" of academic
achievement, but the idea of a
general academic achievement
award had "never even come up
and been turned down," Lyons
said. "It took someone like Tom
Wasow to come along" and notice
the lack of an award, he said.
Although lack of resources
prohibit any plans for expansion
of the award in the next few years,
Wasow said it will continue to be
given annually.
Senior Maria Canas, a member
of the Council of Presidents, came
up with the idea last year after
noticing the lack of academic
awards. She went to Wasow with
the idea last fall but "had no idea
he would implement it as soon as
he did," she said. "I was surprised
he'd taken my idea so seriously."
