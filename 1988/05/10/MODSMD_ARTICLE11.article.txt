Senate postpones INF debate
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's
hopes of taking an approved intermediate
range nuclear weapons treaty to his Moscow
summit with Mikhail Gorbachev later this
month were dealt a sharp jolt yesterday when
Senate leaders again postponed debate on the
agreement.
After a closed hearing by the Senate Intel
ligence Committee and a round of late
afternoon meetings between senators and
White House officials, Majority Leader Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., said Senate floor debate on
the agreement will be postponed at least until
next week.
Problems that had already caused him to
put the debate off for two days, until Wed
nesday, had not been resolved, Byrd said, and
new complications seemed to have arisen.
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker Jr.,
and Gen. Colin Powell, the president's national
security adviser, concurred in the decision.
The Senate's decision to put off debate left
the nagging problems to be tackled by Secre
tary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who are
scheduled to meet in Geneva Wednesday and
Thursday to continue preparations for the
Reagan-Gorbachev summit, beginning May 29.
Bennett bows out in September
WASHINGTON — Education Secretary
William Bennett made it official yesterday —
he will leave his Cabinet post in mid-
September.
Education Department press representative
Loye Miller said Bennett met yesterday with
President Reagan and later with the depart
ment staff to announce his plans to resign in
order to write a book about education and
join the lecture circuit.
"He expressed his gratitude to President
Reagan for the opportunity to serve in his
Cabinet," Miller said. "The secretary reiterated
to his staff his intention to continue at 'full
spead ahead' during the next few months."
An administration source said that when
Bennett told the president he intended to write
a book, Reagan didn't say anything, but gave
Bennett a sharp look. Bennett said, "Not that
kind of book, Mr. President," referring to
former WTiite House chief of staff Donald
Regan's controversial portrait of the adminis
tration.
Bennett has frequently sparked controversy
in his three years in office with pointed
criticism of schools, teachers' unique, colleges
and universities.
He told a conference of education writers
last month that he would probably resign early
because the preoccupation in Washington with
November elections would make it difficult to
accomplish substantive work before Reagan
leaves office.
