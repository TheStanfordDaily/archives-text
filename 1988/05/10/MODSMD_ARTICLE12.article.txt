# Talks break down; Polish strike goes on
## 
### 
GDANSK, Poland — Striking
shipyard workers decided yesterday to
continue their holdout against Polish
authorities after an all-night round of
talks between strike leaders and the
yard management broke down without
an agreement.
The management had refused to ac
cept a proposal put forward by strike
leaders to appoint a commission that
would include Solidarity union mem
bers to oversee the implementation of
any strike agreement.
The commission idea was a compro
mise proposal that seemed to win only
scant backing of the 400 to 500 strik
ing Solidarity activists. The strikers,
at a meeting inside the locked
shipyard, unhesitatingly shouted their
determination to stay until they won
recognition for Solidarity or the Polish
government decided to remove them
by force.
Although the government used the
police to end a strike last week at a

steel mill in southern Poland, it has
held off sending in policemen to end
the weeklong strike here.
"Our spirits are up," said Lech
Walesa, the Solidarity leader who has
remained inside the vast Lenin
Shipyard, alternately advising and
cheering the strikers on since Wed
nesday.
"Those who wanted to leave are
gone," Walesa said. "Only the tough
ones remain."
Over the last several days, the num
ber of strikers inside the plant has
been falling. When it began, an esti
mated 4,000 to 5,000 workers, out of
a force of about 11,000, were active
participants in the strike, joining
crowded rallies just inside the yard's
main gate.
After a pre-dawn police raid Thurs
day at the Lenin Steelworks in Nova
Huta, the number of strikers dropped
sharply and, until yesterday, appeared
to be declining by about 60 to 70 men

a day. A rough count taken by
reporters yesterday indicated that
about 500 workers were still inside.
The spirit of the strikers has been
strained by what many of them see
as a lack of response by the Polish
public to their protest.
Many of them expected their action,
carried out at the birthplace of
Solidarity, would spark similar strikes
nationwide. But a combination of the
government's hard-line approach to
the protests and the general fatigue
of the Polish public prevented the out
burst the strikers had counted on.
The strikers were heartened at least
briefly yesterday by a report that
workers at the Ursus tractor factory

in Warsaw, in the past a staunchly
militant work force, had gone out on
strike.
But according to a government news
agency report, only 70 employees had
stopped working. The report denied
that the action constituted a strike.
Opposition sources and some workers
said that about 1,000 workers were
involved.
Officials at the plant also denied
that a strike was in progress, and there
were no signs around the plant indi
cating that any organized work stop
page was under way.
At the shipyard here, the strikers
voiced their decision to stay inside
after an emotional speech by Walesa.
He noted that some of the workers
who had left the strike earlier were
beginning to filter back into the plant
through passageways not sealed off by
the riot police that have ringed the
shipyard's eight gates.
