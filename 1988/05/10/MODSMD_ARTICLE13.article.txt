# Chirac quits in France

### 
PARIS â€” Acting the day after
a crushing electoral defeat, Prime
Minister Jacques Chirac offered
his resignation last night as
France watched for signs of how
President Francois Mitterrand in
tends to put his overwhelming
new mandate into practice.
Chirac scheduled a meeting
today with Mitterrand to hand
over a formal letter of resignation,
his press representative an
nounced. The conservative prime
minister remained closeted in his
office, meeting with a few key ad
visers, while aides bundled files
into cardboard boxes.
Chirac's decision to depart
swiftly opened the way for the
Socialist president to name a new
prime minister. According to Mit
terrand's lieutenants, the appoin
tee will have the assignment of
attracting a parliamentary ma
jority to reflect the broadened
electorate that lined up behind
Mitterrand in Sunday's vote or,
if this falls through, of running
the government until new par
liamentary elections can be held.
The Interior Ministry an
nounced Mitterrand's final score
in the runoff was 54.02 percent
of the vote and Chirac's 45.98
percent. This gave Mitterrand the
strongest margin in French P
idential elections spice Cnarles ae'
Gaulle's victory in* 1965 and in- 1
dicated wide support to the right
of his own Socialists.
Lionel Jospin, the Socialist
Party's first secretary, said the
strong endorsement of Mitterrand
as president makes it impossible
for Chirac's conservative par
liamentary majority to remain in

place. "This will have to be cleared
up in the days and weeks ahead,"
he declared in a televised appear
ance.
'"Dissolution (of the present
Parliament) is one way to
respond," Jospin added, implying
new elections. "In polls, a ma
jority of Frenchmen seem to think
this is desirable. There could be
others, but in any case, this ques
tion must be cleared up."
Mitterrand declined to reveal
his choice as prime minister.
Speculation centered on former
Agriculture Minister Michel
Rocard, former Finance Minister
Pierre Beregovoy and Jean-Louis
Bianco, secretary general of Mit
terrand's Elysee Palace staff.
Rocard had his own presidential
campaign until Mitterrand
eclipsed it in March. Beregovoy
managed Mitterrand's campaign.
