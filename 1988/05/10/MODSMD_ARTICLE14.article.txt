# Reagan says no on pardons
## President vows to stay out of Iran-Contra trial 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
in his most definitive public statement
on the subject to date, indicated yester
day that he would not pardon former
White House aide Oliver North and
three other accused co-conspirators in
the Iran-Contra scandal.
Reagan told syndicated columnist Carl
Rowan that he does not believe in grant
ing pardons until someone has been con
victed because such a step would leave
unanswered the question of whether the
defendant was guilty.
Apparently believing that the case in
volving the Iran-Contra figures will not
be resolved before he leaves office in a
little more than eight months, Reagan
said: "I won't have to face that issue."
The president's comments from the
interview at the White House yesterday
were relayed by Rowan in an interview
broadcast by WUSA-TV, the local CBS
television affiliate in Washington.
In the past, Reagan has been partic
ularly reluctant to discuss the politically
sensitive issue of pardons for North,
John Poindexter, Richard Secord and
Albert Hakim, and White House officials
have said they have no idea whether
the president would indeed pardon any
of the defendants.
But, according to Rowan, Reagan said
yesterday that "he does not believe in
giving pardons before people are con
victed because it leaves a cloud of guilt
down through the years."
Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admi
ral, was Reagan's assistant for national
security affairs, and North, who has
retired from the Marine Corps as a
lieutenant colonel, was an aide to Poin

dexter. Both men played central roles
in the sale of arms to Iran — part of
an effort to win the freedom of
Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian
factions in Lebanon — and the subse
quent diversion of funds to the Contra
rebels fighting the Nicaragua govern
ment.
Hakim and Secord, a retired Air Force
major general, were key middlemen in
the operation.
The four were indicted March 16 by
a federal grand jury and have pleaded
not guilty. Each was charged with con
spiracy to defraud the United States.
North and Poindexter were accused of
theft of government property, wire
fraud, obstruction of Congress and false
statements.
In addition, Robert McFarlane, Poin
dexter's predecessor as national security
adviser, has pleaded guilty to four mis
demeanor counts of withholding infor
mation from Congress in the scandal.
Poindexter resigned his senior White
House post in November 1986, and
North was forced out under pressure at
the same time, when the diversion of
funds to the Contras was disclosed.
U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell
has said that if he cannot start the trial
by midsummer it will have to be
postponed until after the November elec
tion to avoid any testimony during the
campaign that traditionally starts on
Labor Day. Thus, the trial and possible
appeals would probably extend beyond
the end of the President's term next
Jan. 20.
