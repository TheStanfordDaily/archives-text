## Don't blame BSU 
### 
THE PERCEPTION persists
that the BSU somehow sub
verted the electoral process
in the recent ASSU election. It did
not.
When the preliminary votes were
totaled, the BSU had lost its fee
assessment request by eight votes.
But the ASSU election commis
sioner failed to make polling sites
available at overseas campuses —
as he was required to do by the
ASSU bylaws — meaning that the
BSU would be given a "second
chance" to gain its assessment.
The BSU urged students to vote
at the overseas campuses, as any
organization with its funding in
the balance would have been in
clined to do. Meanwhile, voices
here argued that the BSU's actions
were undermining the fairness of
the election.
Quite the contrary was true. The
fairness of the election would have
been compromised if the ASSU
failed to ensure that every voter
was given the chance to vote.
When the ASSU's mistake was
discovered, the BSU recognized
that it had been placed in an
awkward position. It needed the
votes, but campaigning might be
improper. BSU Chair Bill King
opted to take the high road and
offered to yield to an "information
blackout" if the ASSU Senate
deemed it appropriate.
His statement came at the first
senate meeting immediately fol
lowing the initial voting. In fact,
according to the minutes of the
meeting, his statement came al
most immediately once the senate
began to discuss the topic.
Despite King's cooperative offer,
the senate failed to make a deci
sion. Senators never decided
whether the BSU would be allowed
to solicit overseas votes.
It was here that the senate
dropped the ball. The bylaws

clearly state that any candidate or
group is subject to disqualification
if it attempts "to influence the cas
ting of votes at an overseas campus
once the results of the preliminary
tally have been announced." But
apparently no senator at the meet
ing was aware of the bylaw and
no senator at the meeting checked
to see if there was one. The BSU,
naturally, was left with the im
pression that no bylaw existed.
The only guidance that the BSU
had therefore, was the official
"Code of Election Rules" that it
was given prior to the election.
The rules made no mention of the
bylaw and identified no options for
further exploration of ASSU
bylaws pertaining to elections.
It is not the responsibility of
every student leader on campus to
know the bylaws inside and out —
that would be unrealistic at best.
But it is the senate's responsibility
to know the bylaws well and to
enforce them. What happened in
this election is that the senate
failed to do its job.
Far from acting underhandedly
to alter the outcome of the election,
the BSU was an innocent by
stander to ASSU follies. And the
BSU is to be commended for
showing respect for the process
and offering not to campaign over
seas.
The perception, then, that the
BSU won when the BSU shouldn't
have won, is wrong. The voters
voted, and their decison deserves
respect as a decision made through
a democratic process. That process
was jumbled by some ASSU fum
bling here and there, and perhaps
the fairness of the process was un
dermined because the overseas
voters' ballots suddenly became
disproportionally more important
than other ballots. But the BSU
did its best to ensure fairness, not
hamper it.
