## Students in fairyland 
### 
ONCE UPON a time there was a
fairyland in California inhabited
by, among others, a group of
people called the class of '88. All members
of this class were created equal, yet di
verse: created equal on that one day in
the spring of 1984 when Dean Fred wrote
all of them letters that said "Great!" and
diverse because he sent them all those
letters for different reasons. (Of course,
there were times when it seemed that
some admittees were more equal than
others, but that is another story, my best
beloved.)
Now because there was limited room
in the fairyland, each admittee was only
to stay for four years. This was for some
a very reasonable amount of time, for
others too much, but for most of our
fairyland population (or students as they
were called) this was not nearly enough
time. This, most esteemed reader, created
an unbearable dichotomy of being among
the students.
You see, they were caught between
celestial dream of obtaining
— thereby fulfilling their academic den
sities — and their desires to know the
physical pleasures of the fairyland. Each
student coped with this pulling feeling
in a different manner. Some buried the
calls of earthly pleasures in a pile of
books on their shelves, while others suc
cumbed totally to them, aspiring to live
the "college experience" based solely on
the template of "Animal House."
The fairyland administrators encour
aged them in all their ways by being

lenient to the animalistic, rewarding the
diligent and just and patient with all
those in between. And a precarious but
definite peace was in the land and in the
hearts of the students, and this was good.
Suddenly, though, as the four years
began to draw close, the outside world
cast an ugly shadow upon the land. Its
influence and values created a schism in
the previously contented and equal class
of '88. The complexities of the differences
between the two sides were manifold, but
suffiee to say, there were some who wore
suits and some who immensely disliked
such an idea.
The fairyland administrators pre
tended that they did not mean to take
sides in the dispute, but there were in
dications that they were sympathetic to
the suit-wearing types. They constructed
a castle, where emperors' emissaries
would divine which of the students would
have fortune and gold. They would in
terview only those with suits.
= The golden SiTOES the
castle's gates tells that the suit-wearing
part of Dean Fred's "incredibly diverse"
class of '88 arrived like lemmings at the
magic castle all dressed in identical navy
blue suits. All that was required was for
a small child to call out, "They are all
dressed alike," for the folly to be exposed,
but small children had the sense to avoid
the castle.
So the navy-clad students would wait
together in a long hallway, until one by
one, they were taken to small white in
terrogation rooms. Some never returned,

but the vast mtyority came out much
humbled and muttering things like, "Is
it too late to take the LSAT?"
Meanwhile, those without suits had no
officials to help them find their way in
more esoteric, if less lucrative, fields of
employment. Sometimes they would at
tempt to approach the castle gates, only
to be rebuffed repeatedly. "There are no
jobs for you here, look elsewhere," they
would be told. Starved for encourage
ment, some of the weaker of these souls
contemplated begging for a fifth-year
reprieve in the fairyland, which the ad
ministrators generously granted.
The other suitless ones faced constant
insidious pressures to conform. Subtle
societal signs pointed out, "Suits Va
Money % Personnel Worth." Ah, where
were the counselors with the advice, "To
thine ownself be true?"
Now, my best beloved, any good fairy
tale must end happily. Many without
suits remained determined, despite the
odds against them, to seek their fortune
the old-fashioned way — through piracy
and adventure. And though it is still too
soon to tell, we hope they all live happily
ever after.
