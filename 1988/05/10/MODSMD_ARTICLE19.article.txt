## Democratic candidate ignored in 12th district race 
### 
REPUBLICANS, Independents and
even flimsy Democrats would
have us believe that there are
only two candidates in the 12th dis
trict congressional race: Ernie Konnyu
and Tom Campbell. No Democrat, they
tell us, can win this district.
It is true, as Daily columnist Mitch
Steinberger points out, that this dis
trict has gone Republican for at least
the last 20 years. In fact, any district
with a voter registration divided
equally between Democrats and Repub
licans usually goes Republican for
obvious reasons: Republican viewpoints
and voting patterns are more monolith
ic, Republicans are more likely to-show
up to vote on election day and Repub

licans typically outspend their Demo
cratic opponents. Yet, I cannot accept
Steinberger's fatalistic approach to
politics.
No doubt, incumbent Ernie Konnyu
has caused Republicans much chagrin
because of comments he allegedly made
to female members of his staff. His
asinine remarks on other issues also
are nothing to be proud of.
On the other hand, there's Tom
Campbell. Unfortunately, most people
have forgotten Professor Campbell's
chivalric effort to save the Supreme
Court nomination of Judge Robert
Bork by testifying on his behalf at
Bork's confirmation hearings last year.
Given Bork's embarassing defeat in the

U.S. Senate, it is no wonder Campbell
has chosen to downplay his support of
Bork's views on women's and civil
rights.
Thus, the motto of the Campbell
campaign has become not "Choose the
best Republican," as Steinberger notes,
but rather "Choose the lesser of the
two evils." This district's sophisticated
constituency deserves better.
Although post-primary politics have
not officially begun, it is clear that the
Republican party is presenting this
district with two unpalatable choices.
The voters' best bet is to turn to the
Democrats for a strong, electable can
didate. That candidate is San Mateo
County Supervisor Anna Eshoo.

Eshoo has a proven record of effec
tive leadership and public service
unmatched by Tom Campbell. She has
the sensitivity to women's issues obvi
ously unmatched by Ernie Konnyu.
Eshoo has a grasp on national issues
superior to most politicians in the
district — Republican or Democrat.
This district's voters are smarter
than Steinberger thinks. Indeed, they
need not choose between Tweedle-Dee
and Tweedle-Dum. Instead, voters
dissatisfied with the poor choices of
fered by the Republicans may put
party loyalties aside in November to
elect the best candidate this district
can offer.
