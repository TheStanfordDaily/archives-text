# Senior Weekend drowning
## Rescued senior details story 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
The Stanford senior who drowned
Sunday in a canoeing accident at Stan
ford Sierra Camp near Lake Tahoe was
identified yesterday as Robert Yuan, 22,
of Fountain Valley, Calif.
The identity of the victim was with
held from the public until the El Dorado
County Sheriff's Office contacted
Yuan's family yesterday.
The cause of death will be announced
today pending an autopsy at the county
coroner's office.
Yuan, who was a senior in biological
sciences and electrical engineering, and
senior Terry Bernstein were boating on
Fallen Leaf Lake Sunday afternoon
when their canoe capsized in cold, rough
water.
The accident, the first drowning at
the lake this year, occurred during Stan
ford Senior Weekend, an annual event
sponsored by the Stanford Alumni As
sociation at Sierra Camp. Most of the
90 seniors attending the weekend had
already left the camp when the accident
occurred.
Bernstein said the pair decided to
make the trip in spite of very windy
conditions. He told The Daily yesterday
that neither he or Yuan were surprised
when the vessel capsized.
The two attempted to right the canoe,
but according to Bernstein, the boat
"kept filling with water."
At that point, the students, who were
both wearing life jackets, decided to
swim for shore, which Bernstein esti
mated to be a half-mile away.
He said that as he approached the
shore, he lost sight of Yuan but realized
that he "better keep swimming."
Bernstein said he "couldn't swim well
wearing the jacket" but managed to
come within 50 yards of shore. Tired
and shaking, he began yelling for help,
recalling that the last sound he heard
before blacking out was the running
motor of the fishermen's boat that con
tained three men who pulled Bernstein
out of the icy water.
"It was like swimming in an ocean,"
he said.
Near 1 p.m., after finding Bernstein
in the fishing boat, Sierra Camp staff
members discovered Yuan's body face
down in the water approximately 250
yards from the shore.
Bernstien, who was suffering from
hypothermia when pulled from the lake

about 50 yards from shore, spent Sun
day night in the intensive care unit of
Barton Memorial Hospital in South
Lake Tahoe, and was released yesterday
afternoon.
Back at Stanford early yesterday eve
ning, Bernstein said that he has made
a "quick recovery" and is "feeling fine"
despite a few scrapes and cuts.
Although Bernstein was reportedly
delirious when removed from the water,
Nancy Spencer, the nurse in charge of
the hospital's intensive care unit, said
he was "perfectly lucid" when dis
charged yesterday.
According to Bernstein, he and Yuan
set out in a canoe just after noon on
Sunday and paddled to the middle of

Fallen Leaf Lake, which is approxi
mately three miles in circumference and
not more than one mile wide.
As the two began to row back to
Sierra Camp a little before 12:30 p.m.,
the craft overturned in the rough
waters, at a point that Bernstein de
scribed as the exact center of the lake.
A sheriff s deputy and Dave Bunnett,
an emergency medical technician from
the camp, administered cardiopulmo
nary resuscitation to Yuan, but were
unable to revive him. Yuan was pro
nounced dead on the scene.
Sgt. Jerry Trackett of the El Dorado
County Sheriffs Office said officers es-
timated that Bernstein may have
been in the water about 45
minutes before he was pulled out.
The water temperature at nearby
Lake Tahoe was 54 degrees Sun
day, and Fallen Leaf Lake usually
is a little colder, Trackett said.
Though weather conditions

Sunday were particularly bad,
Trackett said that conditions at
the lake can be "really deceptive"
and at times "treacherous" be
cause the lake is situated at the
base of a group of mountains.
Trackett added that there is no
regular police watch of the lake,
where one drowning took place
last year.
A former roommate of Yuan
found the drowning especially

shocking because he said Yuan
was a "strong swimmer."
An American Red Cross manual
on lifesaving rescue and water
safety, however, cautions that "a
person who falls into cold water
should not attempt to swim unless
it is absolutely practical or nec
essary to do so. . . . Even skilled
swimmers are liable to drown sud
denly if they attempt to swim any
distance in very cold water."
