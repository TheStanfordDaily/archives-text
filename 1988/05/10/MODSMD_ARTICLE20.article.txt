# Farm is apathetic about Segal statue
## 
### 
This year at Stanford has been one
of minority groups making a stand —
asking and even demanding that they
be treated honestly and fairly by the
University.
For those who have been part of
this struggle or agree with its prin
ciples, I ask: What will it take to get
people to speak out when anyone
within the university community is
being treated unfairly?
At the moment, I'm thinking specifi
cally about the Gay and Lesbian Alli
ance Rally last week at the site of the
absent Segal sculpture. It is clear that
the University has not handled this
situation honestly. (They claimed the
statue had been fixed, and then it
turned out that it really hadn't.) What
ever your views of homosexuality are,
the goings-on should interest you if
you follow the way the University
deals with minority groups.

There were about 75 people at the
rally. As a heterosexual attending as a
show of support, I was more moved
than I thought I'd be. The dual under
currents of pride and frustration were
all too familiar, although I've usually
felt them for different reasons. We all
have our own special interest issues,
but to really change the way this uni
versity thinks and acts, we've got to
step outside those bounds.
