# Rose's suspension sets fine example
## 
### 
The National league executive com
mittee which on Friday upheld Pete
Rose's 30-day suspension apparently
did not read Mitch Steinberger's May 6
column, for they seem not to share his
acumen. Why, they didn't even have
the sense to make fun of National
League President A. Bartlett Giamat
ti's name or his avocations. And these
people feel that they can rule on mat

ters that affect baseball.
I applaud the National League for
taking such action against Rose. Sure
it is severe punishment and somewhat
unprecedented, but this ruling will no
doubt serve to deter such incidents in
the future.
League offices have generally been
lax in punishing past offenders, and as
Steinberger himself points out, umpires
have continually been the target of
altercations. Until this abuse is ended,
the integrity of the game is in ques
tion. Perhaps now umpires can make a
call without having to look over their
shoulder for a fist headed in their
direction.
By no means am I denying Pete
Rose his right to argue with umpire
Dave Pallone. Pallone delayed making
his call and potentially cost the Reds a
run (though had first baseman Nick
Esasky been more intent on getting
the runner trying to score than on
arguing the call this perhaps may not
have been the case).
Certainly a manager can go out and
dispute such a call, but when he physi

cally assaults an umpire, he must be
taken care of swiftly and severely. To
me, it is irrelevant whether or not
Pallone contacted Rose first. If he did
it was unintentional, and Rose's con
tact certainly was not; it was an action
which had to be dealt with.
Finally, we come to the issue of the
radio announcers who supposedly in
cited the ensuing "riot." Sure, they
had the right to do what they did, but
in so doing they have basically made it
impossible for Pallone to ever comfort
ably do his job again in Cincinnati.
Certainly this needs to be dealt with,
and again, I feel that Giamatti chose a
very effective route. Had he only called
the announcers it would have sent a
much different message to other mem
bers of the media to do the same.
Steinberger accuses Giamatti of
making a quick overreaction instead of
a carefully considered response. It
seems to me that Steinberger formed a
quick overreaction instead of a care
fully considered column.
