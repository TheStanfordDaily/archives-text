## Bug examines wisdom of seceding from ASSU 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
The results are in!
After a month of torrid voting
its finally time to announce the
big winner in the Major with the
Cutest Guys Contest. (How did I
get myself into this stupidity?)
The winning major, which took
the early lead and then gathered
momentum going into the final
week, is electrical engineering.
Yes, people were actually stopping
me on the street simply to tell
me that the cutest guys are in EE.

In fact, the cutest EE is named
Kirk Stromberg. Call him at 329-
0364. He paid me to say this.
Unfortunately, many of the
votes came from guys who were
trying to pad the voting for their
own major. This, in my mind, vi
olates the spirit of the rules.
Also, a girl named Shikha voted
for double majors in mathematical

and computational sciences and
Japanese. (Hint: There's only one
guy on campus, I'm told, who fits
this description.) I'm not sure
what, if anything, is being violated
here, although I'm pretty sure I
know who is being violated.
Dear Bug Me,
I would like to secede from the
ASSU. I am totally serious about
this, and I know several other
people (at least) who will join me
in this.
I will agree to waive any benefits
I receive from the ASSU. To my
knowledge I have never had any.
I have never participated in any
ASSU-sponsored function or
group, and I own no T-shirt or
lecture notes (which are extra any
way, since they are paid for out
side of the ASSU fee). Any campus
organization I wish to support I
will contribute to myself, without
any ASSU skimming off the top.
I just want to avoid these silly
hoops I have to jump through
every quarter to get my ASSU fee
back. I wait for 20 minutes or
more to get to the spiffy and ex
pensive new voting machines so
that I can get my receipt, turn in
a blank ballot, and then wait 20
minutes to get my money. I would
like to simply not pay it in the
first place.
Please tell me how to get out.
— Un-associated Wannabe
Kids, if seceding from the ASSU
were an easy thing to do, you'd

see the greatest exodus since the
Jews left Egypt.
Unfortunately, the ASSU and
the University have that nifty
little agreement in which you are
automatically billed each quarter
for that all-too-familiar 20 bucks.
At this point there is no way you
can avoid having the $20 put on
your bill.
This leaves you two options: (1)
Pay up and stand in lines for
hours on end to get your bucks
back, or (2) Go the conscientious
objector route.
The second option has its draw
backs. If you return your bill with
$20 missing and a note saying
that you no longer consider your
self a part of the ASSU, the Uni
versity will send you a note in
forming you that you can kindly
pay or forfeit your right to enroll
in this fine school of ours.
Remember, comrade, the ASSU
fee is only used to support those
student groups that we support
with our vote in the spring elec
tions. All other ASSU functions,
like Maria Canas, are self
supporting or are supported by
the profits from other projects.
Prior to 1970, the University
would give a large lump of money
to the ASSU each year to fund
the group's depraved frivolities.
Under the new ASSU constitu
tion, students pay the fee them
selves, and in return the Univer
sity lowers the cost of tuition by
the same amount. Net difference:
zip. But it was felt that students

should have direct control over
their bucks.
Despite the fact that the ASSU
is run by a bunch of student
scalawags, the fee refunds are ac
tually administered by non
student adult employees of the
ASSU. I pass this along so you
will stop yelling at the poor folks
who do the fee refunds, and in
stead yell at your senators.
The Bug's New Fee System
Here's my new plan to make
ASSU fees quick 'n dirty: (1) Put
any campus group that wants
funds on a ballot. This way groups
don't have to get those stupid
signatures. (2) Send a ballot to
every student. (3) Put a box in
Tresidder where students can
drop their ballot, along with a
check for the amount of money
they are giving to student groups.
Presto! No more $20 fee on your
bill. No more waiting in lines.
Nobody votes in ASSU elections.
No student group gets more than
$2.85.

Dear Bug Me,
I am riding my bike down Es
condido on the way to another
exciting class in the Quad. I am
confronted with a dilemma: Meyer
is in front of me. Do 1 ride around
to the left or the right? Or can 1
ride through the lobby ? Can you
tell me which is the shortest (and
proper) direction to choose?
— Confused
I very much appreciate your
having taken the time to write
this question, so I will supress
my natural urge to inform you
that this is the stupidest question
I have received all year! Since you
are coming from that side of
campus, I can only hypothesize
that you must be from Branner.
This leads to one of two possible
conclusions:
1. Because you live in Branner,
you arc stupid. This is certainly
not beyond the realm of possibil
ity, for it is known that living in
Branner has been proven to cause
brain damage in rats. Particularly
those rats who live in the singles.
2. Because you arc stupid, you
live in Branner. This is the more
likely conclusion. I'm always
amazed at how the Housing Office
is able to spot the dim ones from
the Frosnbook pictures and put
them in Branner.
But I digress.
In honor of the scientific tradi
tion of this campus, I performed
a scientific experiment that con
sisted of careening at high speeds

on my bicycle to the left, right,
and through the middle of Meyer
Library.
Biking as fast as I could from
the back edge of Sweet Hall to
the Clock Tower by the Quad, it
took me exactly 35 seconds (Swiss
timing) to go around Meyer to
the right. A few minutes later,
after my lungs had begun working
again, I tried Meyer to the left.
Time: 35 seconds.
As for going through the lobby,
the "shortest distance between
two points is a straight line" gar
bage doesn't hold when there is
a large library in between those
two points.
In order to go from Sweet Hall
to the Clock Tower I had to: bike
at full speed straight at Meyer,
brake suddenly, carry my bike up
the steps, run to the doors, open
them, push my bike through, run
through the lobby, open the other
doors, run to the steps, carry my
bike down the steps, hop on, and
peddle like hell. Net result: 50
seconds station to station and one
very pissed library employee.
(Who says this job ain't fun?)
Your best bet is to go with the
flow of traffic — which is gener
ally to the right. Anarchy, in small
doses, is rather refreshing, but a
head-on collision would probably
delay your arrival at the Quad for
a substantial period of time.

Bug Me appears every Tuesday,
the holy day on the ancient Mayan
calendar.
