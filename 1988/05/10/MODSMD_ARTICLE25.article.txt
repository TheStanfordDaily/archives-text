## Golfers can taste NCAAs Women suddenly in running after blistering tourney 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
By Jove, I think they did
it.
Down to its last day,
in fact its last round of
the season, the Stanford
women's golf team
pulled off what may be

one of the biggest comebacks in the
program's history. Its final-round,
season-low 297 in the California Inter
collegiate could very well have launched
it into the NCAA Championships.
Heading into 54-hole tourney here at
the Stanford Golf Course, the Cardinal
was ranked 17th in the nation. How
ever, the teams that were ranked ahead
of it were not those mentioned in Fri
day's tournament preview, as new
rankings have since been released. Ac
cording to San Diego State Coach Marty
Maher, who saw the latest rankings,
his Aztecs (16th), U.S. International
(15th), Ohio State (14th) and Stanford
were "all within a couple of strokes of
each other."
The Cardinal's 305-315-297 perform
ance (which left it tied for second with
UCLA) beat the Aztec women by 21
strokes and USIU by eight. It seems
that the latter two teams have been
passed in the national rankings. The
only remaining question is whether or
not it caught the Buckeyes for 14th
place nationally.
The NCAA Championships feature
the top-14 ranked teams in the nation
as well as three teams chosen "at large."
Even if Stanford does not move into
14th and earn an automatic bid, it may
get an at-large bid due to its rise from
as far down as 27th, three months ago.
The NCAA field will be announced Mon
day.

The outlook was not nearly as bright
after this morning's round. Senior Kay
Cornelius, who opened Sunday with a
69, bogeyed three of the first four holes
en route to a disappointing 80. Fresh
man Kristin Ryan, who along with Cor
nelius shot her best round of the year
with a 74 Sunday, slipped slightly,
finishing at 78.
The only bright light at midday was
freshman Jodi Figley. Figley, who was
infuriated with herself after an 81 Sun
day, shot a solid even-par 73. It could
have been as low as a 69, because with
four holes left to play she was three
under par. However, she three-putted
for bogey on three of these holes and
missed a four-foot birdie putt on the
other. "My putting cost me four strokes
on those four holes," she said.
Going into the final round Stanford
was in fourth place at 620. San Jose
State, co-host and eventual tournament
champion, led with a two-round total
of 603. USIU (610) had a tender one
stroke lead over UCLA (611). San Diego
State was in fifth, six strokes behind
the Cardinal.
Unlike the morning, the afternoon
round was all Stanford. Leading the
charge was Figley, who birdied six holes,
including four consecutively, to finish
with a 3-under-par 70 and a total of
224, tying for fourth. On her final four
holes she just missed the cup with three
birdie attempts and three-putted for
bogey on the other hole.
Figley, who was ranked 15th heading
into the weekend, has locked up a se
lection to the All-America Second Team,
and is the second-ranked freshman in
the country behind Texas' Michiko Hat
tori.
Cornelius also improved in the after
noon, carding a 1-over-par 74 to finish
at 223 and take third-place honors. Her

74, along with her 69 Sunday, should
move her up from her current ninth
place ranking and earn her a spot on
the All-America First Team.
"I would have liked to have won my
last tournament at home," she said,
"but it's all right."
The good news continued to pour in
as the players waited in anticipation of
the final results. Ryan came in with an
even-par 73 to finish at 225 and tie for
sixth. It was Ryan's best round ever on
the Stanford course, besting her 74 Sun
day.
"Kristin (Ryan)'s final round score is
a culmination of an entire year's hard
work," Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
said. "To finish even par on a golf course
as tough as this one demonstrates just
how much she has improved this year."
Comparing her scores this weekend
with those at last fall's Stanford Inter
collegiate, where she shot 83-88-92, she
has improved her average round by over
12 strokes, simply an amazing ac
complishment in only six months. She
is without question the most improved
player on the team this year.
A team's score is made up of four
players' scores, and that fourth score
has been Stanford's nemesis all year.
But yesterday afternoon the Cardinal
got the boost it needed from freshman
Michele Lyford. With her parents fol-

lowing her throughout the day,
Lyford, who shot 88 in the morn
ing, came back to card an 80 and
vault Stanford past USIU and
into the second-place tie.
USIU did not play as well as it

had over the first two rounds,
finishing the afternoon with 315
to take fourth place at 925. San
Jose State won with a three-round
total of 905, with the Cardinal
and the Bruins 12 strokes back.
San Diego State was fifth at 938.
As expected, the individual
leader board changed drastically
from Sunday, primarily due to the
onslaught by Ryan and Figley. Pat

Hurst of San Jose State (72-73-
75) came from the lead pack to
capture first place with a one
over-par 220. It was Hurst's sec
ond straight tournament victory,
as she won the PCAA Conference
Championships two weeks ago.

finishing the afternoon with 315
to take fourth place at 925. San
Jose State won with a three-round
total of 905, with the Cardinal
and the Bruins 12 strokes back.
San Diego State was fifth at 938.
As expected, the individual
leader board changed drastically
from Sunday, primarily due to the
onslaught by Ryan and Figley. Pat

Hurst of San Jose State (72-73-
75) came from the lead pack to
capture first place with a one
over-par 220. It was Hurst's sec
ond straight tournament victory,
as she won the PCAA Conference
Championships two weeks ago.
"It was great to come back the
way we did and finish second, pe
riod," Baldwin said. "Today was
just a great day for these girls."
By Jove, I think they did
it.
Down to its last day,
in fact its last round of
the season, the Stanford
women's golf team
pulled off what may be

one of the biggest comebacks in the
program's history. Its final-round,
season-low 297 in the California Inter
collegiate could very well have launched
it into the NCAA Championships.
Heading into 54-hole tourney here at
the Stanford Golf Course, the Cardinal
was ranked 17th in the nation. How
ever, the teams that were ranked ahead
of it were not those mentioned in Fri
day's tournament preview, as new
rankings have since been released. Ac
cording to San Diego State Coach Marty
Maher, who saw the latest rankings,
his Aztecs (16th), U.S. International
(15th), Ohio State (14th) and Stanford
were "all within a couple of strokes of
each other."
The Cardinal's 305-315-297 perform
ance (which left it tied for second with
UCLA) beat the Aztec women by 21
strokes and USIU by eight. It seems
that the latter two teams have been
passed in the national rankings. The
only remaining question is whether or
not it caught the Buckeyes for 14th
place nationally.
The NCAA Championships feature
the top-14 ranked teams in the nation
as well as three teams chosen "at large."
Even if Stanford does not move into
14th and earn an automatic bid, it may
get an at-large bid due to its rise from
as far down as 27th, three months ago.
The NCAA field will be announced Mon
day.

The outlook was not nearly as bright
after this morning's round. Senior Kay
Cornelius, who opened Sunday with a
69, bogeyed three of the first four holes
en route to a disappointing 80. Fresh
man Kristin Ryan, who along with Cor
nelius shot her best round of the year
with a 74 Sunday, slipped slightly,
finishing at 78.
The only bright light at midday was
freshman Jodi Figley. Figley, who was
infuriated with herself after an 81 Sun
day, shot a solid even-par 73. It could
have been as low as a 69, because with
four holes left to play she was three
under par. However, she three-putted
for bogey on three of these holes and
missed a four-foot birdie putt on the
other. "My putting cost me four strokes
on those four holes," she said.
Going into the final round Stanford
was in fourth place at 620. San Jose
State, co-host and eventual tournament
champion, led with a two-round total
of 603. USIU (610) had a tender one
stroke lead over UCLA (611). San Diego
State was in fifth, six strokes behind
the Cardinal.
Unlike the morning, the afternoon
round was all Stanford. Leading the
charge was Figley, who birdied six holes,
including four consecutively, to finish
with a 3-under-par 70 and a total of
224, tying for fourth. On her final four
holes she just missed the cup with three
birdie attempts and three-putted for
bogey on the other hole.
Figley, who was ranked 15th heading
into the weekend, has locked up a se
lection to the All-America Second Team,
and is the second-ranked freshman in
the country behind Texas' Michiko Hat
tori.
Cornelius also improved in the after
noon, carding a 1-over-par 74 to finish
at 223 and take third-place honors. Her

74, along with her 69 Sunday, should
move her up from her current ninth
place ranking and earn her a spot on
the All-America First Team.
"I would have liked to have won my
last tournament at home," she said,
"but it's all right."
The good news continued to pour in
as the players waited in anticipation of
the final results. Ryan came in with an
even-par 73 to finish at 225 and tie for
sixth. It was Ryan's best round ever on
the Stanford course, besting her 74 Sun
day.
"Kristin (Ryan)'s final round score is
a culmination of an entire year's hard
work," Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin
said. "To finish even par on a golf course
as tough as this one demonstrates just
how much she has improved this year."
Comparing her scores this weekend
with those at last fall's Stanford Inter
collegiate, where she shot 83-88-92, she
has improved her average round by over
12 strokes, simply an amazing ac
complishment in only six months. She
is without question the most improved
player on the team this year.
A team's score is made up of four
players' scores, and that fourth score
has been Stanford's nemesis all year.
But yesterday afternoon the Cardinal

Michele Lyford. With her parents fol-
