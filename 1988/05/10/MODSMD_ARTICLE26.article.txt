# It's only spring but hoops is heating up

### 
It's an old saying that bas
ketball players are made in the
summer, but next year's
Pacific 10 Conference race has
already been thrown into con
fusion by several spring
developments.
Three teams, Arizona,
Oregon State and UCLA, have
all received welcome off-season
news, which should improve
their standing in the eyes of
preseason prognosticators.

Lute Olson had to breathe a
sigh of relief when Sean Elliott
decided to return for his senior
year at Arizona. Had he en
tered the draft, Elliott would
have probably been the second
pick behind Kansas' Danny
Manning, instead he's turning
down millions of NBA dollars
to stay in Tuscon.
The silky-smooth Elliott will
be the best player in the coun
try next year, and his presence
turns the Wildcats from a Pac
-10 also-ran to a contender.
With P'lliott as well as Olympic
camp invitee Anthony Cook
and former starter Ken Lofton
back, the Wildcats have a solid
nucleus. In a pre-preseason
ranking Basketball Weekly's
Phil Axelrod tabbed the
Wildcats No. 2 in the country.
For all those people who
grew to hate Arizona during
its Shermanesque march
through the Pac-10 last year,
it looks like there is little relief
in sight. The Wildcats won't
be as good as last season, but
they still should finish no lower
than second in the conference.
And though Axelrod's predic
tion seems a bit lofty, they
should be a factor nationally.
UCLA made itself an early
favorite for the conference title
when the Bruins signed Simi
Valley superstar Don Mac Lean.
The 6-foot-10 Mac Lean was the
top unsigned recruit in the
country, and he is perhaps
most important catch
of the decade.
It was absolutely critical that

ent drain that had sent Stevie
Thompson to Syracuse, Sean
Higgins to Michigan, Brian
Williams to Maryland and
Chris Mills to Kentucky over
the past few years. Under Walt
Hazzard the Bruins had been

recruiting, so it was important
that new coach Jim Harrick
turn the tide by keeping
Mac Lean at home.
The signing of Mac Lean not
only re-establishes UCLA as a
factor in Southern California
recruiting but also makes a
good team better. The Bruin
kingpins are Trevor Wilson and
Pooh Richardson, and each
makes the other better.
The Bruins should be an in
spired team next year as Rich
ardson looks to improve his
draft position and Harrick
whips a traditionally underac
hieving squad into shape.
Stanford also looks to be im
proved as four starters will
come back with one more year
of experience. Also, former reg
ular Eric Reveno, a senior, is
fully recovered from the back
injury that forced him to red
shirt this year, and top recruit
Adam Keefe will add power on
the block.
The players are currently
working out in unofficial
Maples Pavilion scrimmages
and hitting the weights in their
off-season conditioning pro
gram.
These look to be the top
three teams in the conference,
and their fortunes will rise and
fall to a great extent on the
play of their three senior stars.
Elliott, Richardson and Stan
ford junior Todd Lichti are ar
guably the best trio of players
ever to simultaneously enter
the conference. Elliott and
Lichti became only the second
and third players in Pac-10 his
tory to score 1,000 points by
the end of their sophomore
season, and Richardson has
run the LTCLA offense from
Day One.
One team that could break
into this top trio is Oregon
State. The Beavers surprised
everyone by Finishing second
last season in what was sup
posed to be Coach Ralph Mil
ler's last year. However, Miller
recently announced that he'll
return for one more year at
the helm before he is forced
