# Reborn Chitren is back on track
## Relief ace emerges from slump to aid Stanford nine in stretch run 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Steve Chitren has
been to relief
pitchers' hell. It's
a dreadful place
where the strike
zone is tiny and
elusive, where

home runs flourish and comfort
able leads wither and die.
Chitren has spent some time
there. After emerging as one of
the premier relief pitchers in the
nation last year — going 8-3 and
chalking up 13 saves and 62
strikeouts in 26 relief appearances
in his first season in the bullpen
— Chitren has been up and down
and all around this season.
"Early on in the season, when
I'd had a couple bad outings, I
started doubting myself, thinking
maybe last year was a fluke,
maybe I'm not really suited for
this role," Chitren said. "I was
really frustrated — I didn't know
what the problem was."
But the junior right-hander,
who is 5-7 with a 3.96 ERA and
seven saves, seems to have turned
it around in the last few weeks.
As the Cardinal enters the last
week of the regular season hun
ting for an NCAA regional bid —
playing at San Erancisco State at
2:30 p.m. today and finishing up
with a three-game set at home
against USC this weekend — it
will need Chitren to continue his
strong pitching.
"He's pitched really well recent
ly," Stanford pitching coach Tom
Dunton said. "That short relief
guy is so critical and vital to the
success of a team. . . . He's been
our guy — you sink or swim with
him."
Early in the season, Chitren
was doing more sinking than
swimming. He had several
nightmarish outings:
• On Eeb. 13, at Hawaii, he
issued three walks (including one
intentionally) in the bottom of the
10th, forcing in the winning run
with the last walk as the Cardinal
lost 5-4.
• On Eeb. 20, against UC-Santa
Barbara, Chitren inherited an 8-3
lead from freshman starter Mike
Mussina in the ninth inning, only
to walk four batters and sur
render a single and a grand-slam
home run, departing with the
game tied 8-8. The Cardinal went
on to win 9-8.
• On Mar. 4, against UCLA,
Chitren entered a 3-3 tie but gave
up two singles and a home run
in the ninth inning as the Cardi
nal lost G-3.
• Chitren reached bottom on
April 1, at California. He took a
2-1 lead into the bottom of the
ninth after a dramatic two-run
homer in the top of the inning
by senior Doug Robbing. Chitren
gave up a single and walked three
batters (one intentionally) and left
the game with the score tied 2-2

and the bases loaded. Sophomore
Robbie Kamerschen came in but
couldn't get the ball over the plate
either, walking Bart Frets to force
in the winning run.
It couldn't get any worse for
Chitren, but Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said he didn't lose
faith in his closer. "There was
never a time when I lacked con
fidence in him," Marquess said.
"I never felt that he wouldn't
regain his form. .. . There was a

time when his control wasn't real
sharp, but we had to keep sending
him out there."
Finally, on April 17 at UCIA,
Chitren made his breakthrough.
He inherited a 2-2 tie from fresh
man starter Stan Spencer in the
eighth inning and threw 4Va in
nings of shutout ball as the Car
dinal pulled out a 5-2 win in 12
innings.
"That was the best I had
thrown the ball all vear," he said.

"1 finally felt like I could throw
the pitch where 1 wanted to; I
felt in control of the situation. I
never felt totally in control before
that."
Chitren followed up that outing
with another strong performance
against Arizona State on April 23.
He inherited a 3-3 tie from Mus
sina in the eighth and shut out
the Sun Devils for two innings as

Junior relief pitcher Steve Chitren has had an up-and-down season, but it looks like the emphasis
is back on the up. After a rough stretch earlier this season, Chitren has put together a string of
encouraging outings recently. Chitren's effectiveness will be a key to how far the Cardinal goes this
season.
