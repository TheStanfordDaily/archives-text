# Robert Yuan remembered
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Friends and relatives of Robert
Yuan mourned the Stanford senior's
death as news of his drowning in a
canoeing accident reached campus
yesterday.
A memorial service for Yuan has
been tentatively planned for 6 p.m.
tomorrow in Memorial Church, ac
cording to James Larimore, assistant
dean of Student Affairs.
Although the fatal accident oc
curred on Sunday, Yuan's name was
not released until yesterday because
of delays in notifying his parents in
Fountain Valley, Calif.
Adams House, where Yuan had
been living since the closing of Roble
Hall in January forced his relocation
from that residence, had a house
meeting last night to talk about the
death, "and talk some about him,"
Adams Resident Assistant John
Hogan said.
Ehud Havazelet, a lecturer in the
English Department and the resident
fellow of Adams, described the
dorm's residents as "still stunned."
According to Havazelet, another dis
cussion meeting for Adams residents
is planned for Wednesday.
Hogan, who lived next door to
Yuan in Adams, remembered his
neighbor as a person who "always
kept his door open."

"He was always the one who pro
vided the volleyball," Hogan said.
"He really established some ties here
over the past two quarters."
Other friends of Yuan who asked
not to be identified described him as
organized, intelligent, physically ac
tive and low-key. There was general
agreement that he was in good phys
ical condition and a "strong swim
mer."
Yuan was only five weeks short of


Robert Yuan
graduating with a double major
in electrical engineering and biol
°gy.
Yuan was extremely active in
his four years at Stanford. In ad
dition to carrying a double major,
he worked as an assistant wire
editor at The Daily, a disc jockey
at KZSU, a teaching assistant in
the biology department, and a
math/science advising associate at
Roble.
He planned to get a coterminal

degree in electrical engineering
unless he was accepted to UC-San
Diego Medical School. He was on
the waiting list for Stanford Med
ical School.
According to Diana Conklin, as
sistant dean and director of the
Row, the local police department
in Fountain Valley was responsi
ble for notifying the next of kin
about Yuan's death.
Conklin said that the Univer
sity has a policy of letting
hometown police do the notifica
tion because "you just can't tele
phone with news like this." The
University does follow up within
an hour by having the student's

residential dean — in this case
Jim Cadena — call the parents
or next of kin, Conklin said.
The University kept especially
tight raps on the victim's name
Sunday night because Yuan's
sister, Jennifer Yuan, is a soph
omore at Stanford. Jennifer Yuan,
an undeclared transfer from
UCLA, was informed of her broth
er's death around 8 p.m. Sunday
by her resident fellow, Assistant
Civil Engineering Prof. Lyna Wig
gins, Conklin said.
Jennifer and her parents, ac
companied by Cadena, flew today
to Lake Tahoe, where results of
Robert's autopsy will be an
nounced Tuesday.
