### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Friends and relatives of Robert
Yuan mourned the Stanford senior's
death as news of his drowning in a
canoeing accident reached campus
yesterday.
A memorial service for Yuan has
been tentatively planned for 6 p.m.
tomorrow in Memorial Church, ac
cording to James Larimore, assistant
dean of Student Affairs.
Although the fatal accident oc
curred on Sunday, Yuan's name was
not released until yesterday because
of delays in notifying his parents in
Fountain Valley, Calif.
Adams House, where Yuan had
been living since the closing of Roble
Hall in January forced his relocation
from that residence, had a house
meeting last night to talk about the
death, "and talk some about him,"
Adams Resident Assistant John
Hogan said.
Ehud Havazelet, a lecturer in the
English Department and the resident
fellow of Adams, described the
dorm's residents as "still stunned."
According to Havazelet, another dis
cussion meeting for Adams residents
is planned for Wednesday.
Hogan, who lived next door to
Yuan in Adams, remembered his
neighbor as a person who "always
kept his door open."

"He was always the one who pro
vided the volleyball," Hogan said.
"He really established some ties here
over the past two quarters."
Other friends of Yuan who asked
not to be identified described him as
organized, intelligent, physically ac
tive and low-key. There was general
agreement that he was in good phys
ical condition and a "strong swim
mer."
Yuan was only five weeks short of
