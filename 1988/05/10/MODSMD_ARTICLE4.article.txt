### Pia Ali-Salaam Staff writer 
Democratic presidential candi
date Michael Dukakis will not ap
pear at a student-sponsored edu
cation conference this Saturday,
but his stepson, John Dukakis,
will join presidential hopeful Jesse
Jackson at the event, conference
organizers said yesterday.
Jackson is scheduled to appear
at 2 p.m. Saturday in White Plaza,
while John Dukakis will speak at
Memorial Auditorium that morn
ing at a separate session of the
conference.
The 28-year-old Dukakis, son
of Kitty Dukakis and her first
husband, John Chaffetz, is a co
ordinator of Michael Dukakis'
presidential campaign.
The one-day conference, "Edu
cation: Taking Action for Our Fu
ture," is being sponsored by mi

nority student and student gov
ernment groups from around the
state.
Tickets for the event are $2
each and will be on sale in White
Plaza Wednesday through Friday,
from noon to 1 p.m.
Participants in the conference
will present the speakers with an
"educational bill of rights to in
fluence the direction of education
over the next four years," said
senior Vivian Wu, a member of
the Asian American Student As
sociation.
Last month, members of
MEChA, a Chicano-Latino stu
dent group; the African/Black
Student Statewide Alliance and
the Asian/Pacific Islander Student
Union wrote agendas highlighting
their educational concerns.
Members of all three student
networks are working to draft one
agenda that draws from the three

already written.
Members of MEChA, A/BSSA,
and the A/PSU will ratify the ed
ucational bill and present it to
statewide student government or
ganizations in hopes of getting
their endorsements.
Elsa Tsutaoka, one of the con
ference organizers, said that the
concept behind the event is that
"education is a right for all, not
a privilege. It is a human right
that any just society provides and
is necessary for progress."
Students hope to apply this con
cept to issues in education such
as admissions, curriculum and fi
nancial aid.
The groups also support
changes in universities' core cur
riculum "that reflect all groups
that contribute to American cul
ture," according to Tsutaoka. She
