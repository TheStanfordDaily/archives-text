# 'Gay Liberation' statue
## Artist calls University negligent 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
In the wake of controversy
about delay in repairing a campus
sculpture defaced last summer,
the sculpture's creator has ac
cused the University of negligence
in its handling of vandalism of
the statue.
The sculpture, called "Gay Lib
eration," is awaiting restoration
after vandals spray-painted the
acronym "AIDS" on it last Au
gust. Art Department officials
said there are no suspects in the
attack.
The attack was the second since
it was acquired by the department
in 1984 in Marc h of 1984 — just
two weeks after its installation —
an unidentified vandal struck the
statue about 40 times with a ham
mer. After that first attack, the
statue — which depicts two men
standing together and two women
sitting together — was repaired
and put back in place within two
weeks in Lomita Mall, near the
Math Corner of the Quad.
The sculptor of the piece,
George Segal, say 3 now that be
cause the University failed to

'Not only is my art
work violated; the
University policy is
violated."
— George Segal

prosecute the first vandal of the
sculpture, the most recent attack
has "forced the University into a
corner."
In a telephone interview from
New York last week, Segal told
The Daily that the University
should have found and prosecuted
the sculpture's first assailant to
make an example of the person.
The statue, Segal said, is "sym
bolic of the University's position"
toward the gay community and
the AIDS epidemic. Because Stan
ford failed to prosecute the first
vandal of the sculpture, Segal said
he believes that the most recent
attack raises an important ques
tion: "Does the University cave
in to fundamental religious pres
sure, or does the University stand

behind inquiry and compassion?"
Segal said that vandalism of the
sculpture constitutes an attack on
his artwork as well as on the Uni
versity. "Not only is my art work
violated, the University policy is
violated," he said.
University officials were quick
to refute Segal's accusations. Art
Prof. Albert Risen, a member of
the University Panel on Outdoor
Art, said yesterday that Segal's
claims were just speculation but
that "everyone is entitled to spec
ulate."
Law Prof. John Merryman,
chair of the art panel when the
statue was first attacked said,
"George (Segal) has it wrong"
about the University knowing the
identity of the first vandal. He
said someone did witness the
hammer-wielding vandal, but that
the identity of the person is still
unknown.
The most recent statue contro
versy began when an anonymous
photographer presented pictures
to the Stanford Organization for
Lesbian and Gay Equality that
showed the statue in disrepair,
contradicting Elsen's statements
to The Daily that repairs on the
statue had been completed.
SOLGE officials had hoped that
the statue would be repaired in
time for Gay and Lesbian Aware
ness Week last week.
Contacted yesterday, Elsen ex
plained the reason for the con
tradiction. He said that late last
summer he learned of the Art De
partment's plan to repair the
statue but shortly thereafter he
traveled to Paris for seven months
to head the Stanford overseas
campus there.
He said it was during his ab
sence that the restoration was
delayed until construction at the
statue's site in Lomita Mall is
completed. The work, installation
of a utility line, is currently sched
uled to begin June 13 and is ex
pected to be finished by late sum
mer.

Elsen said he made the state
ments under the assumption that
the statue's restoration had been
finished, and that he was not in
formed about the construction.
He also said he did not remain
silent after the photographs of the
unrepaired statue were made
public. Elsen said he explained
the reasons for his statement to
The Daily, a member of SOLGE,
and the President's office.
Segal characterized the latest
attack on "Gay Liberation" as a
"medieval reaction" to the AIDS
epidemic, likening it to the reac
tion of some Europeans to the
Black Plague in the Middle Ages.
"When the Black Plague was
prevalent in Europe, could you
solve the problem by murdering
people with the Black Plague?"
he asked. "You needed scientific
discovery to find that rats carried
the disease. The current solution
(to the AIDS epidemic) requires
concentrated medical research."
Segal said he never meant for
the patina and bronze piece to be

a "lightning rod" for controversy.
The artist said he decided to
create it after it was commis
sioned by the Mildred Andrews
Fund in 1984. He said it was fash
ioned in a "gentle, lyric" manner
to emphasize people's "common
humanity with the homosexual
and lesbian community."
According to Elsen, the statue
was turned down by the cities of
Los Angeles, New York, and
Cambridge, Mass., and was then
offered to San Francisco.
Segal said "Gay Liberation" did
not receive support in San Fran
cisco because "incidents of AIDS
came at the same time" and there
were problems with trying to
place it on public lands as stip
ulated by the Mildred Andrews
Fund.
Elsen explained it was at this
time he contacted the Fund and
expressed interest in the Segal
work. After the University agreed
to install it in a public location,
the statue was given to Stanford
as a gift.
