# Trustees to divest in one case

Stanford trustees voted Monday to divest Uni
versity holdings of Ingersoll-Rand, a U.S. firm sel

because the company failed to satisfactorily explain
its poor performance in promoting racial equality
in the South African workplace.
The board also stiffened Stanford's selective di

indirectly to the South African police or military.
If they persist in this commerce, Stanford will divest

eighth time Stanford has divested from companies

for a Free South Africa, staged rallies and staffed
an information and education table this week in
White Plaza.
SFSA is pushing Stanford to adopt a policy of
complete divestment from all companies doing busi
ness in South Africa, according to graduate student
Mia Lewis. "The Trustees love to say they are
against apartheid, but they are as against apartheid
as is (South African President Peter) Botha because
they are doing what Botha wants them to do â€”
investing in South Africa and maintaining normal
