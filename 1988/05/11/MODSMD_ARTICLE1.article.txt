# Trustees to divest in one case
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Stanford trustees voted Monday to divest Uni
versity holdings of Ingersoll-Rand, a U.S. firm sel
ling heavy construction equipment to South Africa,
because the company failed to satisfactorily explain
its poor performance in promoting racial equality
in the South African workplace.
The board also stiffened Stanford's selective di
vestment policy by promising to support shareholder
resolutions urging companies not to sell products
indirectly to the South African police or military.
If they persist in this commerce, Stanford will divest
its holdings with those companies. Stanford's policy
currently prohibits University investment in com
panies that sell products directly to these bodies.
Ingersoll-Rand has for the past two years received
low ratings under the Sullivan Principles, a widely
accepted set of guidelines used to judge a company's
promotion of racial equality among workers in South
Africa.
According to the Trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility, Ingersoll-Rand unsatis
factorily explained its poor ratings and failed to
answer a questionnaire submitted by Stanford con
cerning the company's practices in South Africa.
The University's divestment of its holdings in
Ingersoll-Rand, valued at $120,125, marked the
eighth time Stanford has divested from companies
doing business in South Africa.
The Trustees' decision coincided with increased
student activism promoting campus awareness of
South African apartheid. A new group, Students
for a Free South Africa, staged rallies and staffed
an information and education table this week in
White Plaza.
SFSA is pushing Stanford to adopt a policy of
complete divestment from all companies doing busi
ness in South Africa, according to graduate student
Mia Lewis. "The Trustees love to say they are
against apartheid, but they are as against apartheid
as is (South African President Peter) Botha because
they are doing what Botha wants them to do —
investing in South Africa and maintaining normal
relations," she said.
SFSA has also initiated a post
card writing campaign to urge
Congress to support a bill that
strengthens present sanctions
against South Africa. In addition,
the group is responsible for set
ting up more than 200 crosses
around campus to "memorialize
a few of the many thousands as
sassinated by the apartheid gov
ernment," according to Lewis.
According to SFSA member
Will Masters, a graduate student
at the Food Research Institute,
SFSA members spoke with Trus
tees and held a vigil outside a
SCIR meeting Sunday night.
Lewis said such student activ
ism is necessary to force the Trus
tees to address the issue of di

vestment. "The only way the trus
tees are going to make it a priority
is if they are pressured by the
students," she said.
Several Trustees said the stu
dents' actions had little direct in
fluence on the Ingersoll-Rand de
cision, but according to Trustee
Robert Freelen — also University
vice president for Public Affairs
— "There is no question that the
trustees notice and are also very
interested" in the student activ
ity.
SCIR head Ted Mitchell, an ed
ucation professor at Dartmouth,
said the Trustees view divestment
"as a last resort, an expression of
our frustration in neither being
able to get companies to work for
change in South Africa nor disin
vesting."
Trustee Thomas Ford voiced
disappointment that no students
raised these issues during several
informal dormitory discussions

with Trustees Monday night.
The SCIR recommended that
companies cease sales to the
South African government or
withdraw from the country if
South African law requires them
to sell products without disclosing
their destination.
Although Stanford's policy de
termining investment includes a
provision that companies must
not sell goods directly to the
South African military or police,
laws in that country often force
companies to sell to the govern
ment's central supply organiza
tion where the destinations of
supplies are undisclosed.
The SCIR changed the policy
to urge companies — particularly
Mobil Oil and General Motors —
to terminate sales to South Africa
if they are forced to sell indirectly
to the military and the police.
Trustee Melvin Lane said the

current policy "makes the best of
a bad situation." He noted that
it is difficult to know the real
effect of divestment on South
Africans themselves.
The Trustees also aproved a
$7.3 million reconstruction of
Roble Hall which, along with
making the residence earthquake
safe, will include general improve
ments in the dormitory's design.
Lane said the cost of a new build
ing would be almost double the
cost of the reconstruction. He
added that the Trustees "were
convinced the [rebuilt] building
will reach the level of safety" of
a new residence.
Additionally, the Trustees ap
proved a $2.5 million renovation
of the Stanford tennis facilities,
to be started in September. The
improvements include better
seating, new locker rooms, lighted
courts and expanded parking fa
cilities.

informal dormitory discussions

with Trustees Monday night.
The SCIR recommended that
companies cease sales to the
South African government or
withdraw from the country if
South African law requires them
to sell products without disclosing
their destination.
Although Stanford's policy de
termining investment includes a
provision that companies must
not sell goods directly to the
South African military or police,
laws in that country often force
companies to sell to the govern
ment's central supply organiza
tion where the destinations of
supplies are undisclosed.
The SCIR changed the policy
to urge companies — particularly
Mobil Oil and General Motors —
to terminate sales to South Africa
if they are forced to sell indirectly
to the military and the police.
Trustee Melvin Lane said the

current policy "makes the best of
a bad situation." He noted that
it is difficult to know the real
effect of divestment on South
Africans themselves.
The Trustees also aproved a
$7.3 million reconstruction of
Roble Hall which, along with
making the residence earthquake
safe, will include general improve
ments in the dormitory's design.
Lane said the cost of a new build
ing would be almost double the
cost of the reconstruction. He
added that the Trustees "were
convinced the [rebuilt] building
will reach the level of safety" of
a new residence.
Additionally, the Trustees ap
proved a $2.5 million renovation
of the Stanford tennis facilities,
to be started in September. The
improvements include better
seating, new locker rooms, lighted
courts and expanded parking fa
cilities.
