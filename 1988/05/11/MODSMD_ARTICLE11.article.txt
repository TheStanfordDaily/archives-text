# The 						'good life' is a mix of ethics and morality for Oxford scholar
## 
### Frank Lester Staff writer 
Oxford jurisprudential scholar
Ronald Dworkin talked about the
"good life" last night, but he made
no recommendations for how to
lead it.
However, he did suggest to a
near-capacity crowd in Kresge Au
ditorium that a good life, as de
scribed by theories of ethics, can
not be divorced from politics with
out losing its goodness.
He said there is a symbiosis
between politics and morality, and
that it is necessary, if our lives
are not to be dry and baseless, to
"imbed our political convictions
in the rest of what we think."
A good life, according to
Dworkin, takes advantage both of
the convictions of the individual
and society's common goals.
Dworkin said liberalism meets
the criterion of being a "vision
ary" political philosophy because
it transcends politics and draws
force from many other ideological
outlooks. It answers the question,
' Given limited resources, what is
the best life someone can lead?"
he said.
Dworkin is best known for his

book "Taking Rights Seriously."
One of that book's essays is an
attack on a British lawmaker's
claims that any society wanting
to pass the test of morality had
to criminalize homosexuality first.
In that vein, one of the ques
tions Dworkin addressed was
whether society should strait
jacket those people whose lives,
according to the common judg
ment, are "contemptible." One of
the most frequent objections to
liberalism, Dworkin said, is that
it supposedly demands that people
leave their convictions at the
"polling station door" — that is,
that they should be neutral when
the issue of legislating social
morality springs up.
Due to this supposed neutrality,
Dworkin said some have accused
liberalism of being indifferent to
anything but the goods of selec

ted, time-bound interests. What
about the interests of society in
general, and of future genera
tions? Liberalism's critics have
asked these questions.
But liberalism, according to
Dworkin, is not morally neutral
when it comes to issues of "third
person morality," deciding what
others' lives should be if they are
to be good.
"I have spent a good deal of
time with members of the Moral
Majority," Dworkin said. "Rest as
sured that they are not concerned
about the state of my immortal
soul. They just want me to take
my sin the hell out of the coun
try."
Dworkin argued that people
lead truly good lives only if they
have decided — by their own
faculties, not by social enforce
ment — that the values which fill
that life are good.
He also indicated that this stric
ture of individual welfare reduces
the chances that the common
good — as determined by an un
scientific measurement of the
majority opinion — will be any
thing more than a tissue of in
equities, and therefore an "occa
sion for shame."
