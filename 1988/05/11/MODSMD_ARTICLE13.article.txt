North served with subpoena
WASHINGTON — Oliver North — who in
his Marine years took on Congress, terrorists
and Marxist revolutionaries — for 10 days
outmaneuvered a "monumental effort" to
serve him a subpoena from the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, according to Capitol Hill
sources.

Repeated efforts to serve
North through his lawyer, the
U.S. mail and at his Great
Falls, Va., home failed, said
the sources, who supplied
details on condition that their
identities be withheld.
North even discussed the
subpoena with the Rev. Jerry
Falwell when North delivered
the commencement address at

Falwell's Liberty University May 2, according
to a source close to Falwell. North confirmed
reports that Falwell had heard about the sub
poena. He reportedly told Falwell, "They didn't
get it in my hands."
But last Saturday, U.S. Capitol police, on a
stakeout that began at North's home, served
the subpoena after North stopped his car at
a traffic light near his house. A police officer
sprinted past a backup car driven by North's
private security guards and stuck the subpoena
through an open window on the passenger
sid° of North's car, the sources said.
Mitterrand replaces Chirac
PARIS — President Francois Mitterrand
yesterday appointed Michel Rocard, a 57-year
old Socialist maverick with a following among
non-leftists, to replace Jacques Chirac as pre
mier of France.

Rocard, a popular politician
and longtime rival of Mitter
rand, immediately left the
president's office at the Elysee
Palace to take his new place
in the premier's office at the
Hotel Matignon on the other
side of the Seine River.
While the Republican Guard
stood at attention, Chirac, 55,
a conservative who was

soundly beaten by the 71-year-old Mitterrand
in Sunday's fined round of the presidential
election, met Rocard at the door of the Matig
non and led him to the premier's office. The
symbolic transfer of power took place there.
Chirac and Rocard, who were classmates at
the prestigious Institute of Political Studies,
talked for 30 minutes, then Rocard escorted
Chirac to the door. Chirac, who had resigned
as premier earlier in the day, was then driven
to his office and apartment in the luxurious
City Hall; he remains mayor of Paris.
Program traders halt practice
Five of the biggest practitioners of program
trading, the computerized activity blamed for
aggravating stock market volatility and the
October crash, said yesterday that they will
suspend the controversial practice for their
own accounts.
The voluntary moves, made to restore in
vestor confidence and assuage a growing
chorus of critics, all but eliminated for now
the last of the mtyor Wall Street firms con
ducting program trades for their own accounts.
The moves also follow recent actions by the
New York Stock Exchange to increase controls
on program trading, amid critics' concerns
that the activity is getting out of hand, exerting
a greater influence on market movements and
possibly leading to market manipulation.
However, some Wall Street experts said that
the profitable practice will continue to influ
ence the market, because an increasing
amount of the activity — perhaps more than
half — is now being done for clients, generally
large government and corporate pension funds
seeking steady returns with relatively little
risk.
Four of the five companies — Salomon Bros.,
Morgan Stanley & Co., Paine Webber Inc. and
Kidder, Peabody & Co. — said they will con
tinue to conduct program trades for clients.
Only one, Bear, Stearns & Co., said that it
suspended the activity for clients as well. All
said that their suspensions were temporary,
leaving open the possibility of future reinstate
ment.
Hepatitis virus identified
A northern California biotechnology com
pany announced yesterday that it has identi
fied the virus that causes the most common
form of blood-borne hepatitis and is developing
a blood test that could prevent tens of
thousand of Americans a year from contracting
the virus through blood transfusions.
Officials of the Emeryville-based Chiron Cor
poration said at a Washington news conference
that their discovery will also spur research
toward a vaccine against the sometimes
debilitating liver ailment, which is called "non-
A, non-B hepatitis."
This is a solution to "one of the great un
solved infectious disease problems," Edward
Penhoet, Chiron's president, said.
But some leading liver researchers were cau
tious about Chiron's findings, which have yet
to be published in a medical journal or pre
sented at a medical meeting.
"I suspect they may really have something
but there are over 30 reports of people who
believe they have isolated the non-A, non-B
hepatitis virus over the last seven years," said
Dr. Gary Gitnick of the University of Califor
nia, Los Angeles, Medical Center, who in 1972
was one of the first scientists to describe the
existence of the disease.
