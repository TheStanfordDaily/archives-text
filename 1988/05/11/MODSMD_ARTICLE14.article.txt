# Polish strikers end walkout in defeat

### 
GDANSK, Poland - Polish
shipyard workers ended their strike
yesterday, abandoning a nine-day-old
protest demanding reinstatement of
their banned Solidarity trade union
and surrendering the hope that their
action would ignite the sort of national
upheaval that rocked Poland eight
years ago.
Marching slowly behind a wooden
cross and a grimy banner of the still
outlawed union, the last 400 to 500
holdouts of the strike walked though
the gates of the Lenin Shipyard at
sunset, red-eyed and weary but as
sured by their leaders that their defeat,
by a steadily resistant Polish govern
ment, was only temporary.
"This time we did not manage to
win," a statement from the strikers
said. "We are not leaving the shipyards
in triumph. (But) we are leaving it
with our heads held high and con
vinced of the need and rightness of
our protest."
Lech Walesa, the national Solidarity
leader who had spent the past six days
inside the shipyard with the strikers,

walked at the head of their column,
his arms linked with the generally
youthful members of the shipyard
strike committee, who had hoped that
a wave of labor unrest that began in
Poland 15 days ago would continue to
build and rally national support behind
their cause.
Instead of a leading a widespread
outbreak of sympathetic protests, the
strikers watched as the government
quashed the rash of strikes and threat
ened stern action against potential
labor unrest. After a few days, the
strikers found that even fellow
shipyard workers refused to join them
in significant numbers, some of them
fearing an assault by police and others
doubting that he protest would have
any chance of success.
"We had to assess the situation,"
said strike committee leader Aloyzi
Szablewski. "We had the shipyard, but
we had no support outside." The
strikers, he said, listened to discus
sions of the situation confronting
them.

"They took it in peace," he said,
"but I saw tears in some eyes that we
had ended it this way, but they ac
cepted it."
The ordeal was evident in the
strained faces of the strikers, even as
bells rang in their honor from the
spire of St. Brigida's Church, which
had encouraged their effort by supply
ing food and communications with out
side supporters.
A crowd of about 1,000 that rushed
forward to greet the strikers when
they crossed the lines of police ringing
the shipyard gates seemed struck by
the solemnity of their expressions, and
the almost funereal pace of the proces
sion to a Mass at St. Brigida's nearby.
"The world is watching and admir
ing you," the priest there told them.
"Perhaps your defeat means your fight
has just begun. Be proud of your
struggle and do not cease fighting for
the rights of the Polish worker."
Walesa, who had advised the strikers
but declined to acknowledge a role in
its leadership, seemed more serene

than some of the young workers, many
of whom had tears in their eyes
through much of the Mass.
Walesa had initially called for the
action that resulted in the strike, in
a May Day speech that called for
workers to support a steel workers'
strike in the nation's largest mill at
Nowa Huta in southern Poland. Al
though Walesa said at the time that
he was not calling for strike action,
the shipyard strike broke out the next
day.
Walesa, although supporting the
strike, referred frequently to what he
said was its "premature" start. But
he also indicated that once it had
begun, and the young activists had
begun to press for the legalization of
Solidarity in the shipyard where the
union was founded, he had little choice
but to join it.
The shipyard strike enmeshed once
again Polish opposition forces, the gov
ernment and the Catholic Church,
which claims as adherents 95 percent
of Poland's population.
