# Shultz, Shevardnadze plan pre-summit talk
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - For their
final meeting to prepare for the
U.S.-Soviet summit, Secretary of
State George Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shev
ardnadze will meet in Geneva
today to iron out late-breaking
glitches in a recently signed arms
treaty and to seek progress toward
a more ambitious arms agreement
in the future.
The two men will also discuss
regional issues, a senior U.S. of
ficial said yesterday, with the
main focus on the conflict in An
gola. New hope for ending the
15-year-old civil war arose last
week after a constructive U.S.-
sponsored session in London,
where South Africa and Cuba,
whose troops support opposite
sides, sat down to their first-ever
direct meeting.
A Soviet representative ob
served the talks, a development
that U.S. officials interpreted as
the Gorbachev government's
blessing on the peace process,
with the apparent intent of fol
lowing the same monitoring pat
tern as in the successful Afghan
negotiations.
The senior official, briefing
reporters before Shultz's depar
ture, expressed optimism that the
meeting will settle the "very tech
nical issues" on verification that
are holding up Senate ratification
of the U.S.-Soviet medium-range
(300 to 3,400 miles) missile ac

cord. Shevardnadze, arriving in
Geneva, said he believes the prob
lems have been basically resolved.
Senate leaders Monday decided
to hold up consideration of the
intermediate nuclear forces treaty
until the verification difficulties
had been cleared up.
Nine such issues had been out
standing. One dealt with the size
of the smallest item subject to
inspection: the entire missile, as
the Soviets have claimed, or each
stage of that missile, as the
United States has insisted. An
other concerned the legal status
of U.S.-made Pershing 1A missiles
that are owned by West Germany
but stored in the continental
United States.
