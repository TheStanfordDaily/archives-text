# Dukakis takes the lead
## Early results point to sweep of W. Virginia, Neb. 
### 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
scored resounding primary victories over
Jesse Jackson in West Virginia and Ne
braska yesterday, besting Jackson by
more than 2 to 1 and further sealing
his claim to the 1988 Democratic pres
idential nomination.
The latest tallies on Dukakis' pre
convention scorecard make Jackson's
chances for a California resurgence un
likely and boost the Massachusetts
governor's shot at winning the required
2,081 delegates prior to the July Dem
ocratic National Convention.
Dukakis, who was attending campaign
receptions in New York last night after
spending the week off the campaign trail
in Boston, said the lopsided results were
"another major victory on the road to
the nomination."
Jackson, who has already moved his
campaign to Oregon, where ballots will
be cast next week, was upbeat last night,
insisting that "it's not over 'til it's over."
Vice President Bush, who has already
amassed the Republican National Con
vention delegates needed to win the GOP
presidential nomination, also scored
easy victories yesterday. But he showed
some weakness in Nebraska, where ex
candidate Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan.,
gathered 23 percent of the primary vote.
In both states, Dukakis' victory was
treated by local party officials as a
foregone conclusion days before the polls
opened, as the presidential sweepstakes
was cast into shadow by close statewide
races.
Dukakis coasted to easy victories even

though he expended relatively little of
his campaign time or money in either
West Virginia or Nebraska, which taken
together account for only 62 Democratic
National Convention delegates.

According to the As
sociated Press, Dukakis
has 1,519.7 of the 2,081
delegates needed to
nominate and Jackson
has 933.1. Dukakis
spent last weekend at
home in Boston and was
not scheduled to return
to the campaign trail
until today in New Jer-

sey.
According to ABC News exit polls,
Jackson fared better than expected in
Nebraska, where he received nearly a
fourth of the white vote, the most he
has gotten in recent primaries. Only
about 3 percent of the voters in the two
states voting yesterday are black.
Also, according to the exit polls, Jack
son received far more than his usual
number of ballots from voters who iden
tified themselves as moderates.
Jackson is hoping for surprise finishes
in Oregon next Tuesday, which has 51
Democratic and 32 Republican conven
tion delegates at stake, and in the final
mega-primaries in California and New
Jersey on June 7. Oregon and California,
especially, have gained reputations as
upstarts in the primary process by re
peatedly depriving eventual Democratic
nominees of a final victory.
