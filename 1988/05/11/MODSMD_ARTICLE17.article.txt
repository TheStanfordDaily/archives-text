MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev said in a speech released yes
terday that conservatism, confusion and
panic have delayed the successful im
plementation of his radical reform plans.
In a speech to newspaper and maga
zine editors last Saturday, Gorbachev
said that conservatism has been"the
main braking factor" on reform and that
"the problem" extended even to the top
leadership.
Gorbachev said the country was now
in the second, or "boost," phase of
perestroika, or restructuring, and "far
from everybody has proved prepared for
this."
"We (in the ruling Politburo) saw that
far from everybody was ready to view
the present situation correctly," Gorba
chev said, according to the official news
agency Tass. "We found veritable con
fusion in the minds of many people —
workers, intellectuals and administra
tors alike. And, let us be blunt, not only
at the ground level, but also on the top."
In the past few months, Gorbachev
and his closest allies in the Politburo,
such as propagandist Alexander
Yakovelev, have been laying the ideo
logical and political groundwork for an
important party conference at the end
of June. The conference, the first such

meeting held since 1941, is expected to
play a key role in shaping the personnel
of the 300-member Central Committee
and the pace and scope of reform in the
near future.
Against that background, Gorbachev
and more conservative leaders such as
Yegor Ligachev have held heated closed
door debates in the Politburo over the
pace of reform. Soviet and Western dip
lomatic sources said that it was Ligachev
who sponsored a neo-Stalinist article
published in Sovyetskaya Rossiya in
March, just as Gorbachev was leaving
on a trip to Yugoslavia.
Gorbachev, who reportedly sponsored
a pro-reform rebuttal that ran in Pravda
April 5, referred directly to the
Sovyetskaya Rossiya article in his
speech, saying, "They are trying to scare
us."
Although there was no mention of it
in the Tass version of the speech, Gor
bachev reportedly told editors at the
meeting that he had no intention of
stepping down as head of the Soviet
Communist Party. Other editors also
reported that just as Gorbachev said,
"We all have a great deal to do together
yet," he made a conciliatory gesture
toward Ligachev.
