# Contra leader demands Sandanista concessions
## 
### 
MIAMI â€” The embattled mili
tary commander of Nicaragua's
Contra rebels said yesterday that
unless the Sandanista govern
ment makes new concessions in
the peace negotiations, his forces
will return to war when a 60-day
cease-fire expires at the end of
this month.
"We have no motive to continue
the truce if the Sandinistas make
no concessions. They've benefited
generously from the truce, which
was a concession we made in ex
change for nothing. It's like they
won the lottery," the Contra com
mander, Enrique Bermudez, told
reporters.
Bermudez acknowledged he is
facing what he called "a rebellion"
by three of his top field com
manders. But he said he will not
resign and is confident he has
enough support within his forces
to quell the revolt.
Negotiations under the accord
signed March 23 in Sapoa, Nica
ragua, have reached a stalemate
and Contra fighters in Nicaragua
have been unable to receive food

and clothing underwritten by the
U.S. Congress.
Sandinista officials charge that
Bermudez opposes the peace proc
ess and has sought to thwart it.
They adopted the position that
the negotiations cannot go for
ward until the Contras' military
forces commit themselves in writ
ing to disarm.
Bermudez said he is critical of
the Sapoa accord because it left
his fighters at a disadvantage.
"It is the only case I know
where with two forces in a cease
fire, one of them gives the other
the right to decide if they will be
resupplied or not," Bermudez
said. He spoke with reporters at
Miami International Airport, just
before boarding a plane for Hon
duras to return to his border base
camps to confront the uprising
against him.
Bermudez asserted that Sandi
nista troops have been able to use
the respite from fighting, which
began formally April 1, to re
equip, refresh and relocate their
troops.
