# Denmark elections send unclear message to NATO
## 
### 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark - Den
mark's parliamentary election yester
day appeared to give a vote of confi
dence to the country's continuing
membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
But it left unsettled the issue of
nuclear weapons. The voting, in which
eight parties gained seats in the
Folketing, the Parliament, failed to
give a clear mfyority to parties that
are either for or against tightening
Denmark's laws against NATO war
ships carrying nuclear weapons in
Danish waters.
The early election was called when
opposition members in Parliament
passed a resolution April 14 telling
the government to inform visiting
NATO ship captains that nuclear
weapons are banned.

This new phrasing of Denmark's
anti-nuclear policy was deemed unac
ceptable by the United States and Brit
tun, which have followed a policy of
neither confirming nor denying the
presence of nuclear weapons on their
warships.
The NATO nuclear position was
strongly supported by Conservative
Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, who
called yesterday's snap election, widely
viewed as a referendum on whether
Denmark would remain a full-fledged
member of the Western alliance.
Schlueter said after the votes were
counted that he is not prepared to
step down as prime minister but will
consult leaders of other parties to see
whether he can form a new, stable
coalition.
His chief opponent, Svend Auken,

head of the Social Democrats, said his
party will stand by the tougher wor
ding in the anti-nuclear resolution.
Both mtyor groupings in Parliament
claimed victory early today, contending
that a majority of members in the
179-seat Parliament would support
their positions.
But it was difficult to assess these
claims because smaller parties in the
Parliament often side with or against
the government depending on specific
issues, and do not join in a formal
government coalition.
Political observers said early today
that the NATO issue would probably
be finessed so that Denmark can con
tinue to call attention to its 30-year-old
law banning nuclear weapons in
peacetime — but not specifically de
manding that individual ship captains

be informed of the law.
Norway also bans nuclear weapons,
but it assumes that a general state
ment of its policy to its NATO allies
is a sufficient reminder.
In the balloting, Prime Minister
Schlueter's Conservative Party lost
three seats while the Social Democrats
gained one.
But the biggest surprise was the
showing by the right-wing Progress
Party, which advocates lower taxes
and a halt to immigration.
Since it tends to support a strong
defense posture and is pro-NATO, the
gain of the Progress Party — though
it is not in the government — could
offset the Conservative Party's losses
if the NATO nuclear issue comes to
a vote.
