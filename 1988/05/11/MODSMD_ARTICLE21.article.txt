## End Draw inequity 
### 
HEY HEY, ho ho, returning
residency has got to go!
This year there has been
progress for racial and gender
equality, but one inequity on
campus — Returning Residence
Priority — has been virtually ig
nored.
It's high time Stanford's system
of institutionalized discrimination
against the unlucky be abolished
. . . completely.
Returning Residence Priority al
lows students to return to the res
idence they lived during their first
guaranteed year, regardless of
what number they draw for their
second guaranteed year. If a stu
dent is in the assignable pool,
which consists of all guaranteed
women and most guaranteed men,
he or she has first priority for
spaces in a previous residence.
Returning Residency effectively
limits the number of new students
assigned to a house. In 1985, re
turning residents have occupied up
to 42 percent of available spaces
at Roble Hall, 50 percent at Toyon
Hall and 53 percent at the Italian
House.
The quality of housing here runs
the range from 558 Mayfield to
Stern Hall. Allowing a limited
number of students access to the
best housing on campus for two
years solely based on a good draw
number their sophomore year is
clearly unfair. The policy is out of
line with Stanford's philosophy of
equal access for all students to Uni
versity facilities.
Proponents of the policy claim
its merit rests with the continuity
it brings to both residences and
students. Returning residents can
provide houses with the experience
and leadership to carry on house
traditions. In turn, the policy al
lows residents a sense of stability
in their housing arrangements.
The validity of these arguments
is questionable, and in no case do

the merits of continuity outweigh
the inequity the system creates.
In fact, some resident fellows
assert that a large number return
ing residents may even be detri
mental to a house. Cliques formed
by former residents exclude new
students, making the job of build
ing house unity even more diffi
cult. Former residents may be
resistant to new programming
ideas or may not participate at all.
The job of upholding house
traditions rests with the residence
staff, not the returning students.
Even all-freshman dorms have
traditions — which the resident
assistants and and RFs maintain.
Returning residency even vi
olates Residential Education's
philosopy of promoting diversity.
Instead of advocating continuity,
Res Ed should encourage students
to experience a variety of living
arrangements.
Currently, the Housing Opera
tions Advisory Committee, in con
sultation with students, RAs and
RFs, is reconsidering returning
residency. Several alternatives to
the current policy are under ex
amination, many of which are
worse than returning residency it
self.
One alternative would increase
the number of exempt spaces in a
dorm to allow students to return
and assume leadership positions.
But this would likely force resi
dence staffs to rely on subjective
criteria in choosing the students
for these positions, a move that is
both anti-democratic and unwork
able.
The time is right to abolish re
turning residency, before Roble
reopens. Freshmen have already
been notified that they may not
receive returning residency to their
sophomore residence. End the
policy for all incoming classes, and
let the luck of the Draw decide.
