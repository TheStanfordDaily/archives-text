Recent revelations and
recriminations regarding Ronald
Reagan have reddened and reeled
this Republican. ("Say, Keith, how about
writing in a more obnoxious way?")
What's this astrology crap? (In case
you've been living in Mirrielees, er, a
cave for the past week, you must know
that Donald Regan's new book about the
Reagan White House has leveled some
outlandish charges against Nancy
Reagan, claiming that she frequently con
sults a "San Francisco astrologer" before
letting aides plan the president's
schedule.)
Last time I checked my reality meter,
the full moon and stars were responsible
for high tides but not a whole lot else
(unless you're a freshman girl heading
for the Quad to be kissed by a senior —
and girls, I'm free in case you were won
dering. Excuse me, did I just hear a pin
drop?)
Now, I know I said some harsh things
about Pat Robertson a few months ago
(the word was "nut," I believe), and many
of you wrote The Daily to complain about
my choice of words. Well this time, move
over astrology buffs, because I'm angered
and appalled (damn that alliteration!).
If Regan's words are true, we've got
some big problems on Pennsyvania Av
enue — and I'm not talking about the
green square in a Monopoly game. Imag
ine, a president whose schedule is dic
tated by Jeane Dixon! Somebody get the
Reagans to a padded cell!
I can see it now: "No, sorry guys, the
summit's gonna have to wait. Mercury

is retrograde that week and Ronnie really
shouldn't be signing any binding agree
ments." This is bizarre at best!
Or another: "Look, fellas, I'd love to
have a press conference on the 15th but
Venus and Pluto aren't giving me good
signs. You understand, right?" Wrong,
Mr. President! Is this the White House
or a three-ring circus? (Easy does it, Dem
ocrats; stay away from the obvious joke.)
Now let's be blunt: We all look at the
horoscope when we come across it in the
paper and we may even feel "neat" when
the prediction is for a good day. But
that's not what we're talking about here.
We're talking about the most powerful
man in the world consulting a lunatic
weirdo in the freakshow city of San Fran
cisco to make substantive decisions!
It's enought to make a college-educated
Republican wince.
Does Mike Dukakis use astrology?
That's a question I want answered. How
about George Bush? Does he know the
difference between the Big Dipper and
the Big Gipper? I need to know now.
Have you seen this horror show of a
woman astrologer on TV? She looks the
part, all the way down to her disgusting
cake face full of make-up, which makes
me sorry I don't own stock in Revlon.
(Then again, with a spokesperson like
that .. .) Godzilla, move over!
You know what, though? I like Ronald
Reagan. Overall, I think he's been one
of the most successful presidents we've
ever had. Let me tell you something else:
I like his decisions on the issues. He's
done a great job.

So, what's all the fuss about this
astrologer? If it works for Reagan, and
it obviously has, why knock it so hard?
In fact, this astrologer seems to have
done a damn good job! She may not be
on the White House payroll, but she (and
the stars) have steered Reagan into some
pretty nifty decisions!
I wish I knew more about astrology,
but I don't. My bias is evident, both in
favor of Ronald Reagan and against
"looking to the stars" for answers to
difficult questions.
As a cynical Republican, then, I'm in
one heck of a bind: If I admit astrology
is freakish and dumb, I've called Reagan
freakish and dumb. If I say Reagan's a
great guy who makes wise decisions, then
I've given credence to a weird "science"
I have absolutely no faith in.
In any case, one thing really puzzles
me: This astrologer woman, whoever she
is — is she gonna make any predictions
for 1989 in The National Enquirer? In
qiring minds want to know!
So does Ronald Reagan — and that's
scary.
