## California offshore oil drilling should be abolished 
### 
THE FUTURE of the California
coastline should be addressed at
a time when the dangers of oil
drilling and exploration are readily
apparent.
Secretary of the Interior Donald
Hodel proposed oil drilling activity off
the coasts of Mendocino and Humbolt
counties. California members of
Congress reacted April 28 by proposing
a one-year delay on the sale of oil
leases.
This proposed moratorium on of
fshore oil development is a strategic
move which may benefit the battle to
protect our coastline if the next admin
istration proves to be more sympa
thetic to environmental causes.
Offshore drilling is something to be

worried about because accidents do
happen. The Shell Oil disaster in the
East Bay April 23 proved that the oil
industry, despite its constant reas
surances otherwise, still needs to work
on its prevention of leaks and spills as
well as its methods for expeditious
clean-ups to mitigate the extent of
such tragedies.
Granted, Shell Oil Co. has been
fined and must pay for the clean-up in
the East Bay, but such costs are minor
to the oil company. Fines will never be
effective measures to force the oil
industry to become concerned or cau
tious about the environment.
Rather, the oil companies should be
strictly limited in their activities in the
first place because it is the environ-

ment, with its wildlife and plantlife,
which ultimately has to pay for the
disaster.
It will take years to rehabilitate the
marsh in Contra Costa County, and
this should serve as an example of
what could happen to the beautiful
California coastline if an oilspill oc
curred from an offshore rig. It would
ruin the aesthetic beauty of the
coastline, and the environment would
be damaged for years as birds, fish and
oceanic plantlife suffered and died.
Several cities and counties in Califor
nia have proposed local ordinances
which limit onshore facilities for of
fshore development of oil.
The oil companies claim that these
ordinances unfairly discriminate
against the oil industry and that the

United States needs to offset its
growing dependence on imported oil.
The question to be raised is whether
there are other ways to curb American
dependence on foreign oil without
subjecting coastlines to oil drilling.
Conservation of oil and gas which we
do have and use of alternative or
renewable resources should be empha
sized.
Capitalistic motives of the oil indus
try have closed the doors on progress
towards alternative resources which
might diminish the prime importance
of oil. These doors should be reopened
and offshore oil drilling along
coastlines prohibited.
