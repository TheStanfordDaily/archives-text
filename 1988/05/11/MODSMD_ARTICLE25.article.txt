# Sexism was subtle in Daily article
## 
### 
On the front page of the May 9 Dai
ly, readers were treated to a small and
subtle dose of sexism which should not
be overlooked. The Daily's article on
the results of the first-round housing
draw described 558 Mayfield and
Storey House as being "first and sec
ond, respectively, in popularity."
Clearly, the graphics which accompa
nied the article showed this to be the
case for men. The women's draw
results, on the other hand, showed
that Storey House was actually the
fifth most popular choice following
558, Kairos, Terra and Toyon.
Even if the claim were based upon
cumulative data (i.e. adding the men's
and women's cutoff numbers together),
Storey House would not have been the
second most popular residence. It
would have been Toyon.
Some may argue that this is mere

nitpicking. To them, my reply is, "So
what?" Subtle sexism, like subtle rac
ism, requires nitpicking. Why? Because
it's subtle!
Sexist journalism lends no more
credit to The Daily's already battered
reputation than sloppy journalism.
Why not avoid it?
