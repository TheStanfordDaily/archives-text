# Only cheaters lose by being dishonest

### 
We would like to express whole
hearted agreement with Kirk Roberts'
May 4 letter "Cheating shouldn't be
taken too lightly," and to invite anyone
interested to learn the more basic
philosophical principles behind this
issue.
In discussions of ethics, it is usually
taken for granted that acting dis
honestly is to a person'B self-interest.
The moral choice involved is presented

as: either be selfish and dishonest, or
sacrifice your interests and be honest
out of a sense of moral duty.
The truth, however, is the exact
opposite: honesty is to your self
interest, dishonesty requires self
sacrifice.
The dishonest person tries to gain a
value by faking reality. He tries to
achieve his goal by relying, not on
facts, but on other people's errors. But
only facts, only what actually exists,
can have value.
By subordinating his own perception
of the facts to the minds of other
people, the dishonest person sacrifices
his basic tool for dealing with reality;
and because he tries to succeed by
relying on what does not exist, he is
doomed to failure.
Roberts correctly identifies the way
this principle applies to cheating on
exams. The cheater thinks he will
achieve professional success by people
thinking he has; and this can't be
done.
When you recognize the philosophical

principle involved, you can see that it
is not limited to exams, but applies in
the same way to honesty in business
dealings, in personal relationships and
in all other areas of interaction be
tween people.
The philosopher Ayn Rand fully
identified this principle and discussed
it in detail. We recommend her
writings to anyone who wants to un
derstand why he should be honest, not
as a moral duty or because of the re
quirements of society, but for his own
self-interest.
