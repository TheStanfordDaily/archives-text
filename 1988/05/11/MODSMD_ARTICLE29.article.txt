## Israeli acts unjustified 
### 
LESLIE KAUFMAN'S April 12
column "Israel's Acts Justified"
exemplifies a basic ignorance
present in the general public regarding
the Middle East. She gives an image of
Israel as an island of Western democ
racy built on "economic and social
equality and justice" and surrounded
by hostile, uncivilized Arabs.
Her explanation of the roots of this
conflict regard special attention since
they show a fundamental lack of re
search. I will, therefore, attempt to
illuminate her story with some basic
facts about the conflict.
In the immediate post-World War II
period, the world was shocked to find
out about the Holocaust in which over
six million Jews were murdered by the
Nazis. While humanity must never
forget this horror, we must also re
member that the Arabs had nothing to
do with these atrocites.
Thus, it is incorrect to link Nazi
anti-Semitism with Arab anti-Zionism.
Zionism was seen by the Arabs as the
colonization of their homeland by
Europeans (even if Jews). Fighting the
creation of Israel was, therefore, in the
same spirit of post-war nationalism as
seen in India, Algeria, and the rest of
the colonized world.
Kaufman is correct in her statement
that at the time the motto of anti
colonialism cried "driving the Jews into
the sea." She is very much mistaken,
however, if she thinks that it is the
general opinion of the Palestinians
today.
In the same light, Ariel Sharon,
Israeli defense minister, claims that
the lands of Israel extend to the
Tigris, Euphrates meaning the com
plete annihilation of Jordan, Lebanon,
Syria, Iraq and parts of Saudia Arabia.
Instead of being bogged down in such
extremist ideas held by a few members

of either side, we must look at the
common desires for peace present
among the majority of both peoples.
Kaufman claims that the Israeli
government is eager to cooperate in
the establishment of peace. As exam
ples I present Israel's annexation of
Golan Heights and East Jerusalem as
well as continued occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza even though UN
Security Council Resolution 242 passed
in 1967 clearly demanded Israel's
withdrawal from the occupied ter
ritories.
Even our closest allies (i.e., the
European countries members of the
European Economic Community) have
repeatedly declared that the PLO must
have a role in any peace negotiations.
Kaufman's argument now claims that
if the PLO accepted Israel's right to
exist, the Israelis would give up the
occupied territories.
The PLO cannot officially accept this
proposition until at the bargaining
table because it is the only chip it
holds in the peace negotiations. Yasser
Arafat, however, has accepted U.N.
Security Council Resolution 242 as
basis of an agreement, thereby provid
ing de facto recognition to the state of
Israel.
Those who claim that the PLO is a
terrorist activity because of attacks on
Israeli civilians must remember that
when Israel kills civilians in the occu
pied territories or raids villages in
southern Lebanon, we call it tactical
military operations or attempts at
pacification, never terrorism.
When Kaufman calls the PLO terror
ist, she is overlooking state terrorism
in her narrow definition. She considers
Arafat not an appropriate leader be
cause he has been involved in terrorist
acts.
Yet we all hailed Menachem Begin,

Israeli Prime Minister from 1977-82,
even though he was the leader of
Irgun during the 1930's and 40's. This
organization was responsible for many
violent attacks against civilians, most
famous of which was the bombing of
the King David Hotel in 1946 in which
91 people died including 28 British, 41
Arabs and 17 Jews.
We must come off our high horses
that Israel is this innocent bystander
in a world of chaos and terror. Even
arguments about the good the Israelis
have done for the Palestinians reminds
us of the French and their mission
civilizatrice in which they thought
ruling the colonies actually benefitted
their "uncivilized" subjects.
There is nothing "commonplace" or
"chic" about the horrors endured by
the past three generations of Palestini
ans. If in recent weeks we have been
shocked by the violence in the occupied
territories, we have only seen a
glimpse of the daily humiliation of
most Palestinians.
Let us open our eyes to the realities
without stereotyping Arabs as violent
savages and Israelis as the pillars of
democracy and the West. By remaining
ignorant we simply prolong the suffer
ing and degradation of millions of
Palestinians.
