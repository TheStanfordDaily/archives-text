# Pauling pitches science in education
## 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Science Editor 
Linus Pauling, the winner of
the 1954 Nobel Prize in chemistry
and the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize,
emphasized the central role of sci
ence in issues ranging from the
politics of peace to the prevention
of disease on a KZSU interview
last night.
Because of the importance of
science in society, all students
should receive substantial educa
tion in science, especially in
physics and chemistry, Pauling
said. Such education is necessary
if people are to understand the
course of the world and the in
fluence of science upon it, he said.
A professor emeritus of
chemistry at Stanford, Pauling
also directs the Linus Pauling Re

search Institute of Science and
Medicine in Palo Alto.
Pauling, who has gained
notoriety most recently as a
leading advocate of vitamin C,
retains a interest in the
vitamin as well as in health issues
in general.
Despite criticism of his views
from callers, Pauling said he is
proud to have influenced people
to take vitamin C for protection
against everything from colds to
cancer. He maintained this posi
tion despite one caller's criticism
that evidence for vitamin C's ef
fectiveness as insurance for good
health is far from conclusive.
The lack of good advice about
nutrition from the medical com
munity is one of Pauling's main
concerns. He claims authorities
on these matters, the doctors,

1 came into the field
20 to 30 years ago. I
haven't been brain
washed by these old
guys.'
— Linus Pauling, 87

"haven't kept up with develop
ments in science and nutrition."
"I came into the field 20 to 30
years ago. I haven't been brain
washed by these old guys," he
said. Pauling, who is 87, said he
reads medical literature and
makes up his own mind on new
developments.
Because science has played such
an important role in politics, from

the Manhattan Project to the
Strategic Defense Initiative,
Pauling stressed the importance
of good science advice in govern
ment and the current lack of it.
"I think it would be good if
there were a good science adviser
to the president. We don't have
one right now," Pauling said, add
ing that he doubts Reagan has
ever consulted the adviser he has
at his disposal.
"Scientists should express their
opinion on these (political) mat
ters," Pauling said. "They should
help educate the people."
Responding to criticism that it
is wrong for a civil servant to use
his or her position to influence
students and society in general
on political matters, Pauling kept
his cool.
"A professor has the duty to
discover the truth and the state
of the truth,"he said, implying
that truth extends beyond one
particular field of expertise.
Sixty-six years after his first sci
entific paper was published,
Pauling has a unique perspective
on the evolution of the field of
chemistry and biology.
"When I began my scientific
work, chemistry consisted of a
large collection of facts," Pauling
said. "There were some unifying
principles, but not an extensive
theoretical body (of knowledge in
the field)."
That is not the case today.
Chemistry is now governed by
more general theories, qualifying
it as "more of science," than it
was in the 19305, Pauling said.
Molecular biology, according to

Pauling, now resembles the field
of chemistry in its infancy.
Molecular biology has "not yet
reached a stage where we have a
system of unifying principles as
we have in chemistry and
physics," he said.
