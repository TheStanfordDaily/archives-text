# Jackson deserves slot
## 
### 
AS THE CALIFORNIA Demo
cratic Party primary nears, some
observations are in order.
It is interesting to see the trauma
and discomfort being experienced by
the leadership of the Democratic Na
tional Committee because of Jesse
Jackson's surprising (to them) perform
ance across the country. We now begin
to hear about heretofore unknown
"super delegates" who may disregard
the masses of people voting for Jack
son.
The Democratic National Committee
is, indeed, on trial, and it is of further
interest that court will be held in a
city and region that is dominated by
blacks. The cast, the plot and the
stage could not be better.
The media is also on trial. I assume
individuals in the media listen to or
read questions put to candidates by
their colleagues and the candidates'
answers as well.
Nevertheless, Jackson is asked the
same set of questions each time as if
media representatives are blind or
deaf: What about the Hymietown
comment? What about hugging Sadat?
What about your lack of experience?
What about some black leaders not
supporting your candidacy? Were you
on the balcony in Memphis? Were you
on the Pettis Bridge?
No other democratic candidate is
asked the same questions repeatedly.
(It is of little comfort that Bush is
repeatedly asked about his role in the
Iran-contra scandal, but I shall wait to
see if he is repeatedly confronted with
this question by the media.)
It is one thing for the media not to
accept or agree with Jackson's
answers; it is another to repeat the
questions as if they had never been
asked by anyone else or answered
before by Jackson. If his answers are

unacceptable, the media should say or
write so and then move on to more
enlightening questions.
And, no one questioned Dukakis
about the statements Jimmy "The
Greek" Snyder made about black ath
letes. Yet Jackson is held accountable
for every statement that might be
offensive to some.
There is also negative campaigning
among certain candidates. One method
was to criticize other candidates for
not bashing Jackson. Certain media
representatives also got their oars in
by doing the same about their col
leagues. They would also say, "I chal
lenged Jesse Jackson on national TV!"
They did not go on to report embar
rassment when they received civil and
thoughtful answers from Jackson. No
other candidate has been asked to
explain so much, so often, with so
little time, by such small minds.
Finally, I am truly concerned about
those who whimper, "Jackson cannot
win" and, "Voting for Jackson is was
ting a vote." It is only a waste when
one does not vote at all and does not
vote for his or her own preference.
A member of the staff of one of the
Democratic candidates was reported in
The New York Times as having said —
mimicking Jackson — that the country
is not electing a president who can
rhyme, but who can reason.
May I add: If one is opposed to
apartheid, poor education, poverty,
drugs, poor health care, illiteracy and
equivocation by the courts and justice
departments on civil rights, there is no
rhyme or reason for one to vote for
anyone other than Jackson. Matter of
fact, to quote a famous philosopher
from New York City: "It would be
crazy."
