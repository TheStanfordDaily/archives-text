## Violators beware, parking officers don't scare Community Service Officer Muhammad Randhawa reveals the ups and downs of his job 
### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
He is the man students love to hate.
Issuing an estimated 13 parking tick
ets a day, Community Service Officer
Muhammad Randhawa is one of the
least popular, most visible people on
campus.
Driving around campus in a three
wheeled blue and white Cushman cart,
Randhav/a is one of six CSOs at Stan
ford responsible for catching all parking
violations.
Randhawa admitted that issuing tick
ets to fiesty Stanford students is a hard
work but said that he generally likes
his job.
"I my work; everyone is very
nice to me," he said. Despite his positive
outlook, Rahdhawa has had his share
of tough times with unhappy violators.
For example, although he is originally
from India, Randwana said students
sometimes mistake him for Iranian and
act hostilely
"Sometimes it is a problem,"
Randhawa explained. "Students some
times get upset and say, 'Go home
Iranian!' and I'm not even Iranian."
Randhawa said that his religious prac
tices also set him apart on the job. As
a practicing Sikhs, an Indian religion
and ethnic group, Randhawa is expected
to wear a turban. But it was only after
four years of working for Stanford that
the University, in 1982, gave him per
mission to wear a turban while patroll
ing. Before that time, he would always
keep a turban in his car and put it on
as soon he was off-duty.
"Because of our (the Sikhs) religous
beliefs, we have to keep a beard and
facial hair and wear a turban. Everytime
a Sikh leaves his house he must wear
a turban but in the home we don't have
to cover our hair," he explained.
Randhawa admitted, however, that he
trims his beard because he had difficulty
finding a job in the United States when
he had a long, bushy beard.
Randhawa moved to the United
States from India in 1974. He attended
Aligash University and was captain of
his school's field hockey team which
won the All-India championship under
his leadership. He graduated with a
Bachelor of Arts and then attended Law
School for two years.
His first job in the United States was
as a security guard for Wells Fargo,
and he has been a Stanford CSO for
the past 10 years.

Having worked as a Community Serv
ice Officer for a decade now, Randhawa
has heard every excuse in the book. He
said that there are two typical excuses
student hand him for parking illegally.
They claim that a "professor stopped"
them for "an important talk" or that
their " test ran over," Randhawa said.
Although he is constantly listening
to students plead, Randhawa said the
job is interesting because each day
brings its share of determined students
hoping to finesse their way out a ticket.
"Students are always taking
chances," Randhawa said. "I've given
four or five tickets in the same week
to the same student who parked in the
same place and gave me the same ex
cuse."

Another of Randhawa's responsibili
ties is replacing the wooden striped bar
riers that restrict entrance to certain
points on campus. The barrier at Sweet
Hall is probably the one most frequently
broken, about two or three times a
week, Randhawa pointed out.
According to Sgt. Rick Tipton in the
Parking Enforcement Department, "five
to 10 (barriers) are broken per week."
Barriers cost about $20 to replace.
Besides barrier patrol, Randhawa is
often on the lookout for students who
"like to park in the 14-minute zone for
an hour and just hope they don't get
ticketed."
Randhawa recalled one fiesty woman
who was determined to avoid a write-up.
"Once I was writing a ticket in a

metered zone when a lady from England
came up to me and insisted that she
had a permit to park there," he said.
"I tried to explain that this was metered
parking and that there were no permits,
but she said that she had a C permit
and there was a little C in front of the
change sign."
Despite her obvious confusion, the
woman was parked illegally and
Randhawa issued her a ticket.
Randhawa said he is committed to his
jobs and always tries to act fairly, often
waiting 10 or 15 minutes for people to
come back when time runs off the
parking meters. He also never writes
up the ticket before he has filled in the
license number.
"I hate giving tickets when everything
is clearly marked and people still insist

that they didn't see the sign," he said.
"At the Graduate School of Business
people always park between the signs
that say 'Service Vehicles Only' and
insist that they didn't see the sign."
He also has trouble with people who
park in front of the Quad in the illegal
red zone. Students will plead that they
"have to turn in a papers and will only
be just five minutes, " according to
Randhawa. "They don't understand
that I can't give permission against a
policy I'm hired to enforce," he said.
Despite his various responsibilities
and commitment to the job, Randhawa
admitted that even he he has parked
illegally. "Sometimes 1 park out on the
street behind the police station when
the lot is full," he said.

park in front of the Quad in the illegal
red zone. Students will plead that they
"have to turn in a papers and will only
be just five minutes, " according to
Randhawa. "They don't understand
that I can't give permission against a
policy I'm hired to enforce," he said.
Despite his various responsibilities
and commitment to the job, Randhawa
admitted that even he he has parked
illegally. "Sometimes 1 park out on the
street behind the police station when
the lot is full," he said.

Community Service Officer Muhammad Randhawa faithfully writes up a parking ticket
for one poor trucker.

He is the man students love to hate.
Issuing an estimated 13 parking tick
ets a day, Community Service Officer
Muhammad Randhawa is one of the
least popular, most visible people on
campus.
Driving around campus in a three
wheeled blue and white Cushman cart,
Randhav/a is one of six CSOs at Stan
ford responsible for catching all parking
violations.
Randhawa admitted that issuing tick
ets to fiesty Stanford students is a hard
work but said that he generally likes
his job.
"I my work; everyone is very
nice to me," he said. Despite his positive
outlook, Rahdhawa has had his share
of tough times with unhappy violators.
For example, although he is originally
from India, Randwana said students
sometimes mistake him for Iranian and
act hostilely
"Sometimes it is a problem,"
Randhawa explained. "Students some
times get upset and say, 'Go home
Iranian!' and I'm not even Iranian."
Randhawa said that his religious prac
tices also set him apart on the job. As
a practicing Sikhs, an Indian religion
and ethnic group, Randhawa is expected
to wear a turban. But it was only after
four years of working for Stanford that
the University, in 1982, gave him per
mission to wear a turban while patroll
ing. Before that time, he would always
keep a turban in his car and put it on
as soon he was off-duty.
"Because of our (the Sikhs) religous
beliefs, we have to keep a beard and
facial hair and wear a turban. Everytime
a Sikh leaves his house he must wear
a turban but in the home we don't have
to cover our hair," he explained.
Randhawa admitted, however, that he
trims his beard because he had difficulty
finding a job in the United States when
he had a long, bushy beard.
Randhawa moved to the United
States from India in 1974. He attended
Aligash University and was captain of
his school's field hockey team which
won the All-India championship under
his leadership. He graduated with a
Bachelor of Arts and then attended Law
School for two years.
His first job in the United States was
as a security guard for Wells Fargo,
and he has been a Stanford CSO for
the past 10 years.

Having worked as a Community Serv
ice Officer for a decade now, Randhawa
has heard every excuse in the book. He
said that there are two typical excuses
student hand him for parking illegally.
They claim that a "professor stopped"
them for "an important talk" or that
their " test ran over," Randhawa said.
Although he is constantly listening
to students plead, Randhawa said the
job is interesting because each day
brings its share of determined students
hoping to finesse their way out a ticket.
"Students are always taking
chances," Randhawa said. "I've given
four or five tickets in the same week
to the same student who parked in the
same place and gave me the same ex
cuse."

Another of Randhawa's responsibili
ties is replacing the wooden striped bar
riers that restrict entrance to certain
points on campus. The barrier at Sweet
Hall is probably the one most frequently
broken, about two or three times a
week, Randhawa pointed out.
According to Sgt. Rick Tipton in the
Parking Enforcement Department, "five
to 10 (barriers) are broken per week."
Barriers cost about $20 to replace.
Besides barrier patrol, Randhawa is
often on the lookout for students who
"like to park in the 14-minute zone for
an hour and just hope they don't get
ticketed."
Randhawa recalled one fiesty woman
who was determined to avoid a write-up.
"Once I was writing a ticket in a

metered zone when a lady from England
came up to me and insisted that she
had a permit to park there," he said.
"I tried to explain that this was metered
parking and that there were no permits,
but she said that she had a C permit
and there was a little C in front of the
change sign."
Despite her obvious confusion, the
woman was parked illegally and
Randhawa issued her a ticket.
Randhawa said he is committed to his
jobs and always tries to act fairly, often
waiting 10 or 15 minutes for people to
come back when time runs off the
parking meters. He also never writes
up the ticket before he has filled in the
license number.
"I hate giving tickets when everything
is clearly marked and people still insist

that they didn't see the sign," he said.
"At the Graduate School of Business
people always park between the signs
that say 'Service Vehicles Only' and
insist that they didn't see the sign."
He also has trouble with people who
park in front of the Quad in the illegal
red zone. Students will plead that they
"have to turn in a papers and will only
be just five minutes, " according to
Randhawa. "They don't understand
that I can't give permission against a
policy I'm hired to enforce," he said.
Despite his various responsibilities
and commitment to the job, Randhawa
admitted that even he he has parked
illegally. "Sometimes 1 park out on the
street behind the police station when
the lot is full," he said.
