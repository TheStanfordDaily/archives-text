Revelation:
You all realize, of course, that we have less
than a month left of school. Getting in the
way of saying "hooray" is the fact that I am
now almost a senior. Only one year separates
me from the real world. I suppose I'll just
have to make the most of these last few
weeks...
Sydney Comes to Stanford:
The Lively Arts at Stanford presents the
internationally acclaimed Sydney Dance Com
pany which will perform on Monday, May 16,
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. Tickets
are available at the Tressider Ticket Office.
The Stanford engagement will feature the
American premiere of the full-length work,
"Shining." The Lively Arts people say that
this is their most prestigious event yet.
A Spring Quarter Attitude:
Cloudy skies don't dampen spirits as last
weekend will attest. Splendor in the Grass,
Siete de Maio and the Cowell Cluster Luau
— all went on despite the gloominess.
Seniority:
The very last Senior Pub Night is tomorrow
at El Torrito. Why not go out in style? And
while you're at it, may I suggest looking for
a date, everyone? Senior Formal is not that
far away...
That 50's Style:
For those of you who love be-bop, cheer
leaders and bobby-socks, Toyon and the Stan
ford Eating Clubs are presenting "Grease"
this weekend on the Toyon Green. Perform
ances are May 12-14 at Bpm — bring a blanket
and get in the mood for some "Summer
Loving!"
Don't Be Blue:
If you're feeling down about the Draw
results, cheer up. Hey, I'm facing a third year
in Serra (without the benefit of that free
Hobee's breakfast). Just remember: lots can
happen in the second round.
