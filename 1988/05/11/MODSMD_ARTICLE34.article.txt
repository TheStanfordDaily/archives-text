# Album Review
## Dolby scores with creative 'Aliens' 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Thomas Dolby — "Aliens Ate My
Buick"
The king of creative craziness
is back with a vengence.
After a hiatus of over three
years, Thomas Dolby has released
the much-awaited followup album
to "The Flat Earth" that matches
that record in inventiveness and
excitement.
This time around, Dolby — the
man behind such hits as "Hyper
active," "Dissidents" and the pe
rennial favorite of the LSJUMB,
"She Blinded Me With Science"
— has magnificently blended jazz
and funk to create a dynamic ve

hide for the witty and humerous
shreds of sarcasm that one would
expect to find on a release titled
"Aliens Ate My Buick."
Starting with the voice of Robin
Leach saying the words "There
was a room in her house that was
always kept locked/ It was her
garage," "The Key To Her Fer
rari" opens the album with a jazzy
bang that shows the listener that
he or she has embarked on an
ebullient journey through the
realm of satire.
The first five songs, especially
the first single "Airhead," are
about as sarcastic and witty as
music can get, as Dolby repeatedly
jabs at the phenomenon known
as So Cal to some, L.A. to others
and home to me. After spending

17 years living in the "Pulp Cul
ture" among many people whose
actions just shout out "My Brain
Is Like A Sieve," Dolby brings
back many memories of events
some friends of mine would like
to forget.
But perhaps the album's big
gest gem is "Hot Sauce," a funky
and electric remake of the George
Clinton tune (who, incidently,
makes a guest appearance on the
last track humorously called "May
The Cube Be With You"). Few
cuts dare to radiate the overt
ecstacy and the general joie de
vivre that overflows from this
number.
"Aliens" is quite simply an
eight-song tidal wave. Catch it
now or be swept away by it later.
