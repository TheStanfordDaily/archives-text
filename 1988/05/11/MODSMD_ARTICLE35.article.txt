# Album Review
## Voodoo casts spell on 'Americans' 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Wall of Voodoo - "The Ugly
Americans in Australia*"
Before purchasing this album,
I had only known of their biggest
hit, "Mexican Radio," and I was
expecting a lively band with
humorous songs vocalized by a
strange lead singer. Basically, I
expected Devo without the stupid
red hats. To the band's credit,
those expectations fortunately
went unfulfilled.
Admittedly, Wall of Voodoo,
indeed, is a lively band with
humorous songs vocalized by a
strange lead singer, but the Devo
corniness and theatrics are ab
sent. This "greatest" hits-type
concert album provides an excit
ingly refreshing blend of resolute
nuttiness and insignificant candor
that portrays a band having fun
making seriously thrilling music.
As the album sleeve kindly
points out, "This delightful col
lection has been plucked from
each and every album, rendering
an all-encompassing yet brief view

of the Wall of Voodoo parade of
hits, near hits and ne'r hits."
Most of the concert album was
performed in Melbourne,
Australia. (Hence the name "Ugly
Americans in Australia*") Four
of the songs, however, accounting
for the asterisked title, were re
corded at Big Joe's Bar 'N Grill
in Bullhead City, Arizona.
Wall of Voodoo does not exactly
sell out stadiums.
Since Melbourne was the focal
vocal performance point, the band
includes the obligatory "tribute to
the concert city" song, but they
do so Wall of Voodoo-style. In a
53-second on-the-spot tribute en
titled "Crazy, Crazy Melbourne,"
a piano-based ad-glib that would
do Paul Schaffer proud, the band
confronts the audience with the
following lyrics: "Melbourne.
Crazy, crazy Melbourne./ You've
got everything from restaurants
to kiddie porn/ And would I leave/
Man you must be kidding me/ Un
less you gave me a one-way ticket/
To Sydney." A virtual crowd
pleaser for the Melbourne audi
ence, judging from the
posthumously-recorded corn

ments heard in the background.
After initiating the assembly
with that second song, the band
immediately breaks into the sim
ply animated "Wrong Way to Hol
lywood" and very seldomly disap
points.
"Ring of Fire" is the most in
fectious song on the album. In it,
Prieboy explains why "Love is a
burning thing that makes a fiery
ring." "I fell into a burning ring
of fire/ Went down, down, down
and the flames got higher/ And it
burns, burns, burns/ The ring of
fire/ The ring of fire." Comple
ment the lyrics with a hauntingly
burning music track centered
around incessant synthesizers,
and you have Wall of Voodoo's
version of today's love song.
"Far Side of Crazy" is another
contagion that relentlessly at
taches itself to neurons in the
memory banks. The self
explanatory lyrics accurately
depict the band's mental state.
In spite of a few needless and
annoying diversions that crop up
on the album, "Ugly Americans
in Australia*" offers a deranged
platter of enjoyable music.
