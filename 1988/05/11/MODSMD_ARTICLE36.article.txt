# Stage Review
## Theater's efforts more interesting than play itself 
### Frank Lester Staff writer 
People go to see a play either
because they want to see a play
or because they want to be seen
seeing a play.
Those of the latter inclination
will shy away from Judith
Dresch's production of Shaw's
"Geneva" at the Manhattan
Playhouse jn Palo Alto (continu
ing its Friday-Saturday run
through May 21) — all the better
for those of the former inclina
tion.
Arthur Miller, who, every 25
years or so, seems to know what
he's talking about, once wrote,
"The structure of a play is always
the story of the birds coming
home to roost." Unfortunately,
Shaw's 1939 play, as written,
seems to be more the story of the
birds coming home to pontificate.
This is an unavoidable fact. You
will not go to this production if
you want any shred of respect
you have for Shaw to be left in
tact.
"Geneva," a comedy about the
World Court at the Hague in
1939, is also a dramatization of
the absurdity of the League of
Nations (and, by extension, I sup
pose, the United Nations). It is
also a theatrical treatment of the
theme: "Man is, so far, a failure
as a political animal."
If you can imagine any theater
or drama in either or both of these
two ideas, you are a hardier per
son than I. The capacity crowd
at the playhouse was clearly of
that hardy stock.
They laughed every time one of
the characters made a political
diatribe, which, in the case of this
play, seemed to be every three
minutes. The last act is an hour
long, but only a couple of young
women in front of me rolled their
necks in fatigue as the invective
wore on. Everybody else, however,
had a splendid time immersing
themselves in the orations of the
characters, who were, unsubtly
enough, mere mouthpieces for
Shaw's fiery socialist rants.
About the last act: it is a staged
confrontation, in the old equiva
lent of the World Court, between
the forces of justice and the three

fascist dictators of the Continent.
Bardo Bombardone (Mussolini,
played by Johannes Kempees)
strides in wearing a toga and a
gaudy crown of laurels. Ernest
Battler (Hitler, played by Tim
Franklin) stomps in wearing full
military regalia and a plumed hel
met.
Toward the end of the act, Gen
eral Flanco de Fortinbras (Franco,
played by Steve Somerstein) does
not stride or stomp as much as
breeze in, wearing a gilded
matador's costume. The only con
ventionally dressed historical
types in the play are Commissar
Posky (Steve Andrews) and Sir
Orpheus Midlander, the British
Prime Minister (Steen Sellers).
These absurd costumes are di
rector Dresch's responsibility, and
as much as one can sympathize
with her apparent desire to con
vey the effect of high farce, the
consequence is something like
watching Michael Jackson's "Man
in the Mirror" video, with its
colorized highlights of the Fueh
rer's newsreel armbands. The
sense of absurdity is oppressively
draining, when the play itself, al
ready draining enough on its own,
needs no additional inducements
to tedium.
Here is a sample of the dialogue.
Battler: "As a pioneer I know that
the real obstacle to human prog
ress is the sort of mind that has
been formed in its infancy by the
Jewish Scriptures. That obstacle
I must smash through at all
costs." Commissar: "I must inter
vene. Are we here to discuss the
Jewish problem? If so, I have no
business here: my country has
solved it. And we did not solve it
by badinage."
The rest of the play is exactly
the same, with the minor varia
tion of the love interest between
a secretary, who starts the chain
of events moving with several in
advertently dispatched letters
(Linda Gunther), and an Ameri
can journalist, who expediently
falls in love with her (Scott
Grebe). The dialogue consists
mostly in stentorian defenses of
Shaw's position.
The League of Nations, in
Shaw's estimation, prides itself on
the impartial delivery of justice,

but is really an ineffectual piece
of slow-moving machinery that
can enforce none of its imperious
fiats. Admirable though that po
sition might be, its place is in an
essay, not a play.
The interpretation of "Geneva"
by Dresch's cast is, for the most
part, quite what one would expect:
there is a lot of overacting and
mugging to compensate for the
general morass of the play, espe
cially during the tedious last act,
during which several of the char
acters have nothing to do for tens
of minutes on end but grimace
and gesture at one another. All
of this is very spirited and exigent,
but it also raises the question of
why Dresch thought "Geneva"
was worth bringing to the stage
in the first place.
I have thus far provided no
reasons for spending ten dollars

on the ticket for this production.
There is at least one, and it over
rides the criticisms I have just
outlined.
If you find the whole process
of putting a play together, with
all its attendant problems, a sub
ject of fascination, you will want
to go see this production as an
exercise in what the theater — at
its most earthbound level —
means, not only to its audience,
but to the players and puppeteers
behind the scenes. Many people
find the process-versus-product
debate hopelessly childish, but I
think it deserves some consider
ation.
There is something exhilarating
in watching a cast struggle to
bring the ideas of the playwright
to fruition, from the scraggly,
late-night hours of rehearsal dur
ing which it seems nothing can

go right, to the final weeks of
performance, when, God willing,
all the blockings, cues, lines, and
bits of business go just perfectly.
This is the process, not the prod
uct.
The point is that you will not
get the slightest idea of process
if you choose to see a play at the
Lucie Stern or the Burgess or the
American Conservatory. All
you're going to see there is slick
ness, the clean, spacious lobby
packed with judiciously dressed
patrons (think of the movie line
scene in "Annie Hall"), the hubris
that aspires to constant perfec
tion, the product that usually falls
short of its inspiration and hopes
you don't notice.
The Manhattan does not truck
with such pretense. Mrs. Dresch
has been putting out Ibsen,
Shakespeare, Coward, Shaw,

Chekhov, and other notables al
most single-handedly since the
days when Lyndon Johnson was
still a newcomer to the White
House. The players here are
people taking time out of nine-to
five jobs as marketing consultants
and sales reps and personnel man
agers to indulge their love of the
dramatic muse to its hilt.
The Manhattan is intimate
enough that you can wait in the
lobby after the show ends and
watch the actors, in some cases
with traces of makeup still
daubing their faces, come out of
the back room with cans of beer
in hand to chat with anyone will
ing to take the time to do so.
They will speak candidly about
the amount of energy needed to
maintain character and presence
of mind through a play as long
as "Geneva," about eleventh-hour
casting problems that forced some
to learn their lines in five days.
Mrs. Dresch herself, an enthu
siastic, tireless woman in baggy
bohemian garb, will grasp your
attention (if not your hands) and
regale you with stories of produc
tions past. It is a far cry from
the glitz and spitshine of larger
Bay Area theaters. It is a welcome
change.
Seeing "Geneva," despite all its
demands on my patience,
reminded me of the people at
home who get together and put
on plays in church basements just
for the hell of it, the excitement
of bringing an illusion to life. This
kind of atmosphere will have no
attraction for the reader who
thinks I am being patronizingly
romantic, that I am dispensing
tired homilies about the in
domitable "show must go on"
spirit of the local townsfolk.
On the other hand, those who
love the theater will know imme
diately what I mean, and will be
more than happy to see Dresch's
company in action, warts and all.

by Dresch's cast is, for the most
part, quite what one would expect:
there is a lot of overacting and
mugging to compensate for the
general morass of the play, espe
cially during the tedious last act,
during which several of the char
acters have nothing to do for tens
of minutes on end but grimace
and gesture at one another. All
of this is very spirited and exigent,
but it also raises the question of
why Dresch thought "Geneva"
was worth bringing to the stage
in the first place.
I have thus far provided no
reasons for spending ten dollars

on the ticket for this production.
There is at least one, and it over
rides the criticisms I have just
outlined.
If you find the whole process
of putting a play together, with
all its attendant problems, a sub
ject of fascination, you will want
to go see this production as an
exercise in what the theater — at
its most earthbound level —
means, not only to its audience,
but to the players and puppeteers
behind the scenes. Many people
find the process-versus-product
debate hopelessly childish, but I
think it deserves some consider
ation.
There is something exhilarating
in watching a cast struggle to
bring the ideas of the playwright
to fruition, from the scraggly,
late-night hours of rehearsal dur
ing which it seems nothing can

go right, to the final weeks of
performance, when, God willing,
all the blockings, cues, lines, and
bits of business go just perfectly.
This is the process, not the prod
uct.
The point is that you will not
get the slightest idea of process
if you choose to see a play at the
Lucie Stern or the Burgess or the
American Conservatory. All
you're going to see there is slick
ness, the clean, spacious lobby
packed with judiciously dressed
patrons (think of the movie line
scene in "Annie Hall"), the hubris
that aspires to constant perfec
tion, the product that usually falls
short of its inspiration and hopes
you don't notice.
The Manhattan does not truck
with such pretense. Mrs. Dresch
has been putting out Ibsen,
Shakespeare, Coward, Shaw,

Chekhov, and other notables al
most single-handedly since the
days when Lyndon Johnson was
still a newcomer to the White
House. The players here are
people taking time out of nine-to
five jobs as marketing consultants
and sales reps and personnel man
agers to indulge their love of the
dramatic muse to its hilt.
The Manhattan is intimate
enough that you can wait in the
lobby after the show ends and
watch the actors, in some cases
with traces of makeup still
daubing their faces, come out of
the back room with cans of beer
in hand to chat with anyone will
ing to take the time to do so.
They will speak candidly about
the amount of energy needed to
maintain character and presence
of mind through a play as long
as "Geneva," about eleventh-hour
casting problems that forced some
to learn their lines in five days.
Mrs. Dresch herself, an enthu
siastic, tireless woman in baggy
bohemian garb, will grasp your
attention (if not your hands) and
regale you with stories of produc
tions past. It is a far cry from
the glitz and spitshine of larger
Bay Area theaters. It is a welcome
change.
Seeing "Geneva," despite all its
demands on my patience,
reminded me of the people at
home who get together and put
on plays in church basements just
for the hell of it, the excitement
of bringing an illusion to life. This
kind of atmosphere will have no
attraction for the reader who
thinks I am being patronizingly
romantic, that I am dispensing
tired homilies about the in
domitable "show must go on"
spirit of the local townsfolk.
On the other hand, those who
love the theater will know imme
diately what I mean, and will be
more than happy to see Dresch's
company in action, warts and all.

Courtesy Manhattan Playhouse
A deaconess (Ruth C. Velnott) meets up with Bardo Bombardone (Johannes Kempees), a Mussolini
character, in the American Premiere of "Geneva," a comedy by George Bernard Shaw, now performing
at the Manhattan Playhouse.
People go to see a play either
because they want to see a play
or because they want to be seen
seeing a play.
Those of the latter inclination
will shy away from Judith
Dresch's production of Shaw's
"Geneva" at the Manhattan
Playhouse jn Palo Alto (continu
ing its Friday-Saturday run
through May 21) — all the better
for those of the former inclina
tion.
Arthur Miller, who, every 25
years or so, seems to know what
he's talking about, once wrote,
"The structure of a play is always
the story of the birds coming
home to roost." Unfortunately,
Shaw's 1939 play, as written,
seems to be more the story of the
birds coming home to pontificate.
This is an unavoidable fact. You
will not go to this production if
you want any shred of respect
you have for Shaw to be left in
tact.
"Geneva," a comedy about the
World Court at the Hague in
1939, is also a dramatization of
the absurdity of the League of
Nations (and, by extension, I sup
pose, the United Nations). It is
also a theatrical treatment of the
theme: "Man is, so far, a failure
as a political animal."
If you can imagine any theater
or drama in either or both of these
two ideas, you are a hardier per
son than I. The capacity crowd
at the playhouse was clearly of
that hardy stock.
They laughed every time one of
the characters made a political
diatribe, which, in the case of this
play, seemed to be every three
minutes. The last act is an hour
long, but only a couple of young
women in front of me rolled their
necks in fatigue as the invective
wore on. Everybody else, however,
had a splendid time immersing
themselves in the orations of the
characters, who were, unsubtly
enough, mere mouthpieces for
Shaw's fiery socialist rants.
About the last act: it is a staged
confrontation, in the old equiva
lent of the World Court, between
the forces of justice and the three

fascist dictators of the Continent.
Bardo Bombardone (Mussolini,
played by Johannes Kempees)
strides in wearing a toga and a
gaudy crown of laurels. Ernest
Battler (Hitler, played by Tim
Franklin) stomps in wearing full
military regalia and a plumed hel
met.
Toward the end of the act, Gen
eral Flanco de Fortinbras (Franco,
played by Steve Somerstein) does
not stride or stomp as much as
breeze in, wearing a gilded
matador's costume. The only con
ventionally dressed historical
types in the play are Commissar
Posky (Steve Andrews) and Sir
Orpheus Midlander, the British
Prime Minister (Steen Sellers).
These absurd costumes are di
rector Dresch's responsibility, and
as much as one can sympathize
with her apparent desire to con
vey the effect of high farce, the
consequence is something like
watching Michael Jackson's "Man
in the Mirror" video, with its
colorized highlights of the Fueh
rer's newsreel armbands. The
sense of absurdity is oppressively
draining, when the play itself, al
ready draining enough on its own,
needs no additional inducements
to tedium.
Here is a sample of the dialogue.
Battler: "As a pioneer I know that
the real obstacle to human prog
ress is the sort of mind that has
been formed in its infancy by the
Jewish Scriptures. That obstacle
I must smash through at all
costs." Commissar: "I must inter
vene. Are we here to discuss the
Jewish problem? If so, I have no
business here: my country has
solved it. And we did not solve it
by badinage."
The rest of the play is exactly
the same, with the minor varia
tion of the love interest between
a secretary, who starts the chain
of events moving with several in
advertently dispatched letters
(Linda Gunther), and an Ameri
can journalist, who expediently
falls in love with her (Scott
Grebe). The dialogue consists
mostly in stentorian defenses of
Shaw's position.
The League of Nations, in
Shaw's estimation, prides itself on
the impartial delivery of justice,

but is really an ineffectual piece
of slow-moving machinery that
can enforce none of its imperious
fiats. Admirable though that po
sition might be, its place is in an
essay, not a play.
The interpretation of "Geneva"
by Dresch's cast is, for the most
part, quite what one would expect:
there is a lot of overacting and
mugging to compensate for the
general morass of the play, espe
