# Quad buildings to be reinforced
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Seismic surveys have revealed
that a number of buildings in the
Quad must undergo structural
reinforcement because they con
tain flaws that could lead to safety
problems in the event of an earth
quake, a University official said
yesterday.
The Geology Corner and the
Engineering Corner, both located
at the rear of the Main Quad, top
the list of buildings recommended
for reinforcement, according to
Associate Director of Facilities
Project Management Earl
Kershner.
"Structural condition, function
and frequency of use" will all de
termine which buildings will be
repaired first, Kershner said.
The seismic surveys which
revealed the flaws were all part
of an ongoing University-wide
study examining the earthquake
safety of all buildings that were
constructed here before 1933,
when building codes began requir
ing seismic surveys and earth
quake safety features.
In a related development, Stan
ford's Board of Trustees yesterday
approved the proposed budget to
renovate Roble Hall, which was
evacuated and closed at the outset
of winter quarter when it was
learned the building was seismi
cally unsound. The project budget
totals $7.3 million, $5 million of
which will come from housing
reserves and $2.3 million which

will come from restructuring
long-term University debts.
Interior demolition work on
Roble will begin May 15 and
working designs for its
reconstruction will be completed
by July 1.
Kershner said reconstruction
will begin "very shortly," pending
the University's hiring of a con
tractor. The Trustees' report
stated the need for a "fast track
management approach" to
"return the building to service by
September 1989."
In the University's new recom
mendations to reinforce buildings
in the Quad, both the Geology
Corner and the Engineering Cor
ner were determined to be high
