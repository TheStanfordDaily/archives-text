# Quad buildings to be reinforced
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Seismic surveys have revealed
that a number of buildings in the
Quad must undergo structural
reinforcement because they con
tain flaws that could lead to safety
problems in the event of an earth
quake, a University official said
yesterday.
The Geology Corner and the
Engineering Corner, both located
at the rear of the Main Quad, top
the list of buildings recommended
for reinforcement, according to
Associate Director of Facilities
Project Management Earl
Kershner.
"Structural condition, function
and frequency of use" will all de
termine which buildings will be
repaired first, Kershner said.
The seismic surveys which
revealed the flaws were all part
of an ongoing University-wide
study examining the earthquake
safety of all buildings that were
constructed here before 1933,
when building codes began requir
ing seismic surveys and earth
quake safety features.
In a related development, Stan
ford's Board of Trustees yesterday
approved the proposed budget to
renovate Roble Hall, which was
evacuated and closed at the outset
of winter quarter when it was
learned the building was seismi
cally unsound. The project budget
totals $7.3 million, $5 million of
which will come from housing
reserves and $2.3 million which

will come from restructuring
long-term University debts.
Interior demolition work on
Roble will begin May 15 and
working designs for its
reconstruction will be completed
by July 1.
Kershner said reconstruction
will begin "very shortly," pending
the University's hiring of a con
tractor. The Trustees' report
stated the need for a "fast track
management approach" to
"return the building to service by
September 1989."
In the University's new recom
mendations to reinforce buildings
in the Quad, both the Geology
Corner and the Engineering Cor
ner were determined to be high


John Hughes
priority structures because they
are relatively tall and are utilized
by many people, according to
Kershner. He said those buildings
present the largest safety risk of
all Quad buildings.
Other Quad buildings will un
dergo minor, short-term seismic
bracing in case a msyor earth
quake hits Stanford before per
manent reinforcement can be
completed, according to Kershner.
To permanently reinforce a build
ing, a building often must be com
pletely gutted and then

reconstructed, Kershner said.
Many such reconstructions, es
pecially in the Main Quad, were
completed during the 1960s and
19705. Most recently, the Com
munications Department, build
ing 120 of the Quad, underwent
such a reconstruction.
But such reconstruction is very
expensive and takes a long time
to complete, according to
Kershner, who added that in past
years it has been difficult to raise
enough money for such projects.
But now, instead of waiting to
completely reinforce individual
buildings, administration officials
have chosen to "spread the money
around to a number of buildings,"
Kershner said.
