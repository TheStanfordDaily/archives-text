## To be Frank, Card is Carey-ed to 23-2 romp 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
SAN FRANCISCO - For
Frank Carey, little
changes have brought big
results.
Three weeks ago, Stan
ford's junior second
baseman made a couple

minor adjustments in his batting stance,

and since then, his hitting has picked up
remarkably.
Yesterday, Carey racked up a double,
a triple and three singles to pace a 25-hit
attack as the Cardinal swamped the San
Francisco State Gators 23-2 at Maloney
Field.
Stanford, which is ranked ninth na
tionally by Baseball America and 10th
by ESPN/Collegiate Baseball, is now 34-
21 overall going into its final Pacific 10

Conference Southern Division series of
the year — at home against USC this
weekend.
The 23 runs and 25 hits yesterday are
both season highs for Stanford. The Car
dinal onslaught included five doubles and
four home runs — junior third baseman
Ed Sprague's 18th of the season, soph
omore designated hitter Tim Griffin's
third, sophomore rightfielder Paul
Carey's (no relation to Frank) ninth and

sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen's
sixth.
The drubbing started early. After six
pitches from Gator starter Greg
McKnight in the top of the first inning
the score was 2-0, as Frank Carey doubled
with one out and Sprague homered to
left. After six more pitches had gone by,
senior catcher Doug Robbins had singled
and Griffin had homered and the score
was 4-0.
The Cardinal scored at least three runs
in each of the first five innings, putting
up three in the second, nine in the fourth
and three in the fifth.
The one constant in the Stanford at
tack was Frank Carey, who batted seven
times and, in addition to the first-inning
double, also tripled in the second inning,
singled twice in the lengthy third inning
and singled again in the ninth.
Frank Carey's 5-for-7 day raised his
batting average 15 points to .280, but he
has been particularly torrid of late, bat
ting .430 (23-for-53) in the team's last
12 games. During that 12-game span,
Carey has scored nine times, stolen four
bases and knocked in eight runs.
Carey attributes his recent surge to
some changes he made in his stance three
weeks ago, before a series against Arizona
State at Sunken Diamond.
He lowered his hands a little bit and
"shortened" his stance, moving his feet
a little closer together in the batter's box.
"That has allowed me to use my hips
a little more, instead of just muscling
the ball with my arms and hands," he
said.
The results have been encouraging, but
Carey said he still isn't overly happy
about his performance.
"I'm not real pleased with the way I've
played this season," he said. "I've gone
into two periods where I didn't hit the
ball well at all — at the beginnning of
the season and towards the middle. I like
to pride myself on being consistent, and
offensively, I've been too inconsistent.
"But I can't really do anything about
that now. All I can do is hope I can keep
hitting like this and finish the season
strong."
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess is so
pleased by Carey's recent offensive per
formance that he may start keeping the
left-handed swinging Carey in the No. 2
spot in the batting order against left
handed pitchers — as Marquess did yes
terday against southpaw Gator starter

McKnight — rather than dropping Carey
to the ninth spot against lefties as has
been done most of the season.
Regardless of how he was doing at the
plate, Carey has played steady defense
all year. After playing shortstop through
out high school and during his freshman
year at Stanford, Carey switched over to
second last year. There were some ad
justments to make, and Carey's defense
was shaky at times.
"The adjustment I had to make was
not so much on ground balls as on double
plays — starting the double play," he
said. "Now, I'm pretty comfortable with
that. ... I've worked hard on my defense
.. . and it's paid off."
Carey's fielding percentage was a solid
.955 going into yesterday's game. "A lot
of my errors are mostly just throwing
errors — I don't think I've really booted
that many," he said.
But it's Carey's offense that has been
opening eyes lately, and as the Cardinal
closes the regular season with a three
game set against USC at Sunken Dia
mond this weekend, the team will look
to follow Carey's example at the plate.
"We're not happy with our record,"
Carey said. "But I refuse to believe that
our record and stats reflect how good we
are. I think we're a better team than the
record shows. ... If we can start getting
more big hits, more two-out hits, like
last year's team did .. . that will be a
key."
Card notes
Sophomore Robbie Kamerschen started and
went four innings for the Cardinal, notching
the victory to improve his record to a perfect
6-0. Junior Brian Keyser and sophomore
Mark Carper both pitched two innings, and
freshman Scott Weiss pitched the ninth. All
four pitchers threw effectively.
After going hitless in his first 14 at-bats
this season, freshman Ryan Turner singled
up the middle in the third inning yesterday
for his first collegiate hit.
Stanford sent 14 men to the plate in the
third inning, which included seven singles, a
double, a two-run home run and two Gator
errors.
After dropping two games to Santa Clara
last week, Fresno State relinquished the top
spot in the polls, falling to third in the Baseball
America list and fourth in ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball. Oklahoma State returned to the No.
1 spot in both polls, with Arizona State back
at No. 2.

When a team wins by 21 runs, there have to be some stars. Junior second baseman Frank Carey led the parade of
heroes with five hits yesterday in Stanford's 23-2 manhandling of San Francisco State.
