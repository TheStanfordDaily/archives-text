# Can Card win one more for Gipper?

I wonder if the proposed Reagan
Library would have met with a
different fate had the Stanford
Athletic Department been in
volved in the decision making.
After all, the Reagan years have
brought unprecedented prosperity
to the Cardinal sports programs.

Stanford has garnered at least
one NCAA team title every year
during the 1980s — the last dry
year was 1979. And unlike
Reagan, Stanford sports have
found increasing success as the
decade has unfolded. In 1986 and
1987, Stanford teams reached the
pinnacle, bringing home four
team titles each of those years.
But with only a month left in
the school year, the winning
streak is in jeopardy. Only the
men's tennis, women's tennis and
baseball teams (in that order)

have a realistic chance of breaking
up the shutout.
The Stanford baseball team,
which has several players back
from last year's NCAA champion
ship squad, grabbed the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
lead early in the season. But in
consistent pitching has finally
caught up with the Cardinal over
the past few weeks.
The team has a very long, dif
ficult road to cover if it is to cap
ture its second straight NCAA
crown. Winning the national
championship in college baseball
is always a crapshoot; it almost
always involves a little luck, or
something unexpected. Some
thing along the lines of a Paul
Carey grand slam with the team
trailing by three runs in its last
turn at-bat. Something along the
lines of A 1 Osuna pitching eight
plus innings of shutout relief after
inheriting a 3-0 deficit.
Yet, the Cardinal will need more
than the usual amount of magic
this year. Getting to the World
Series may be the most difficult
chore. To advance to Omaha, the
Cardinal will probably have to
beat either Fresno State or Ari
zona State on their home turf in
a West regional. The Bulldogs and

Sun Devils were only the two hot
test teams in the nation over the
last two months.
The Stanford tennis teams have
far fewer obstacles to hurdle,
needing only to win four matches
in four days to keep the Cardinal
streak alive. Not that this will be
easy by any means, but Stanford
has two things going for it: Dick
Gould and Frank Brennan.
Gould has coached the men to
eight championships over the last
two decades, and the women have
won four of the past six NCAA
titles under Brennan.
On two previous occasions —
1982 and 1984 — Brennan and
the Cardinal women have been
the only Stanford team to win a
championship. And this year, the
Cardinal women have the added
incentive of trying to become the
first school ever to win three con
secutive national women's tennis
titles.
But evoking history is one
thing, and actually going out on
the court and winning a champi
onship is another. You win or lose
with this year's lineup, not with
the teams that were victorious in
1982, '84, '86 and '87. And un
forunately, this year's women's
lineup may not have enough

healthy bodies to pull off the hat
trick.
The Cardinal will probably have
junior Eleni Rossides back, albeit
in a limited capacity. However,
freshman No. 1 player Tami Whit
linger is "extremely doubtful" for
tomorrow's first-round match in
Los Angeles, according to Bren
nan.
The Cardinal coach said he has
faith that his players can move
up in the lineup and still win.
But, almost in the same breath,
he admitted that top-ranked
Florida (which has lost just once,
that setback coming three months
ago) will be virtually unbeatable
unless the Cardinal is "completely
healthy." And with each passing
day that doesn't look like it will
be the case.
Stanford's best bet rests with
Gould and the men's tennis team.
Ranked No. 1 and undefeated
since February, the Cardinal will
be the favorite to win the NCAA
title in Athens, Ga. But there are
never any gimmees in Athens, es
pecially if you have to play the
home team. Last year USC was
undefeated and considered to be
one of the better teams in NCAA
history, but the Trojans were

toppled by the Georgia Bulldogs
in the semifinals.
There is a chance that the Car
dinal will meet Georgia in the
quarterfinals this year, and even
if the Bulldogs are not on the
agenda, Stanford will be up
against several other worthy con
tenders. Still, if the entire Cardi
nal team plays well — something
that hasn't happened on many

occasions this season — the lineup
may be too imposing for the rest
of the field at Georgia.
If this is the case, then the
men's tennis team will push the
Stanford team title winning
streak to nine years. And, who
knows, Dick Gould may even
receive a phone call during the
championship celebration from
President Reagan.

year was 1979. And unlike
Reagan, Stanford sports have
found increasing success as the
decade has unfolded. In 1986 and
1987, Stanford teams reached the
pinnacle, bringing home four
team titles each of those years.
But with only a month left in
the school year, the winning
streak is in jeopardy. Only the
men's tennis, women's tennis and
baseball teams (in that order)

have a realistic chance of breaking
up the shutout.
The Stanford baseball team,
which has several players back
from last year's NCAA champion
ship squad, grabbed the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division
lead early in the season. But in
consistent pitching has finally
caught up with the Cardinal over
the past few weeks.
The team has a very long, dif
ficult road to cover if it is to cap
ture its second straight NCAA
crown. Winning the national
championship in college baseball
is always a crapshoot; it almost
always involves a little luck, or
something unexpected. Some
thing along the lines of a Paul
Carey grand slam with the team
trailing by three runs in its last
turn at-bat. Something along the
lines of A 1 Osuna pitching eight
plus innings of shutout relief after
inheriting a 3-0 deficit.
Yet, the Cardinal will need more
than the usual amount of magic
this year. Getting to the World
Series may be the most difficult
chore. To advance to Omaha, the
Cardinal will probably have to
beat either Fresno State or Ari
zona State on their home turf in
a West regional. The Bulldogs and

Sun Devils were only the two hot
test teams in the nation over the
last two months.
The Stanford tennis teams have
far fewer obstacles to hurdle,
needing only to win four matches
in four days to keep the Cardinal
streak alive. Not that this will be
easy by any means, but Stanford
has two things going for it: Dick
Gould and Frank Brennan.
Gould has coached the men to
eight championships over the last
two decades, and the women have
won four of the past six NCAA
titles under Brennan.
On two previous occasions —
1982 and 1984 — Brennan and
the Cardinal women have been
the only Stanford team to win a
championship. And this year, the
Cardinal women have the added
incentive of trying to become the
first school ever to win three con
secutive national women's tennis
titles.
But evoking history is one
thing, and actually going out on
the court and winning a champi
onship is another. You win or lose
with this year's lineup, not with
the teams that were victorious in
1982, '84, '86 and '87. And un
forunately, this year's women's
lineup may not have enough

healthy bodies to pull off the hat
trick.
The Cardinal will probably have
junior Eleni Rossides back, albeit
in a limited capacity. However,
freshman No. 1 player Tami Whit
linger is "extremely doubtful" for
tomorrow's first-round match in
Los Angeles, according to Bren
nan.
The Cardinal coach said he has
faith that his players can move
up in the lineup and still win.
But, almost in the same breath,
he admitted that top-ranked
Florida (which has lost just once,
that setback coming three months
ago) will be virtually unbeatable
unless the Cardinal is "completely
healthy." And with each passing
day that doesn't look like it will
be the case.
Stanford's best bet rests with
Gould and the men's tennis team.
Ranked No. 1 and undefeated
since February, the Cardinal will
be the favorite to win the NCAA
title in Athens, Ga. But there are
never any gimmees in Athens, es
pecially if you have to play the
home team. Last year USC was
undefeated and considered to be
one of the better teams in NCAA
history, but the Trojans were

toppled by the Georgia Bulldogs
in the semifinals.
There is a chance that the Car
dinal will meet Georgia in the
quarterfinals this year, and even
if the Bulldogs are not on the
agenda, Stanford will be up
against several other worthy con
tenders. Still, if the entire Cardi
nal team plays well — something
that hasn't happened on many

occasions this season — the lineup
may be too imposing for the rest
of the field at Georgia.
If this is the case, then the
men's tennis team will push the
Stanford team title winning
streak to nine years. And, who
knows, Dick Gould may even
receive a phone call during the
championship celebration from
President Reagan.
