# Sailors earn national berths
## 
### Hugh R. Bethell Staff writer 
For the first time in a number of
years, the Stanford sailing team qual
ified for both the Dinghy Racing and
Team Racing National Champion
ships this weekend by finishing in
the top two at both of this year's
Pacific Coast Championships, hosted

on San Francisco Bay by the Richmond Yacht Club.
From the start of racing Saturday morning until
the final finish Monday evening, the Cardinal had
to fight tooth and nail for their positions at the
nationals. When the spray finally settled, the team
found itself second in the dinghy racing standings
and tied for first among the team racers, so that
together with UC-Irvine, Stanford will represent
the Pacific Coast region at the nationals to be hosted
by the Cardinal in June.
During the qualifying regatta for the Dinghy
Racing Championships, Stanford competed against
10 other teams that had earned the right to vie for
the regional championship by earning top finishes
at local regattas. All of the teams found the Bay's
usual strong winds and the regatta's new boats a
challenge to master, but the seven smallest schools
all found it difficult to turn in top finishes the first
day As a result, four schools — Stanford, Irvine,
California and Orange Coast — were locked in a
close battle after Saturday's racing.
With Orange Coast and Irvine a few points ahead
and Cal close behind, Stanford's sailors knew they
had their work cut out for them when the racing

began again Sunday morning. Sailing in A Division,
senior Tom Kuhnle and junior Rita Snape sparked
the Cardinal effort with a series of top finishes,
which were matched by seniors Dan Buckstaff and
Kathleen Mallery in B Division.
Although the team's performance dipped slightly
during the middle of the day, another surge in the
afternoon's racing put the team in second, five
points ahead of Orange Coast, as it entered the last
race.
Knowing that second place would mean a berth
at the nationals but third would bring its season
to an end, the team put senior skippers Dan Buck
staff and Drew Gashler together to sail the finale.
Closely covering the team from Orange Coast, Buck
staff and Gashler dragged their opponents to the
back of the fleet, went on to pass another boat,
and ended up adding two points to the margin of
victory.
"It was sweet to win it on the water that way,"
Gashler said.
Though the day's racing was over, the regatta
results were put into limbo as Orange Coast filed
a number of protests that accused Stanford of
fouling them on the racecourse. After over five
hours of hearings, however, a panel of sailing experts
cleared the Cardinal of any wrongdoing and
validated their finishing position.
"The jury's decision was quite a relief. It would
have been incredibly painful to lose on shore what
we had won on the water," Stanford Coach Blake
Middleton said.

Junior Rita Snape and senior Tom Kuhnie sparked the Cardinal in A Division to its twin national bids:
In the Dinghy Racing and Team Racing National Championships.

Even after the decision, the
team still refrained from celebrat
ing as it prepared for the Team
Racing Championship. In that
event, the Cardinal matched a
team of three boats against each
of the other schools in a three
on-three format. Strongly trained
by team racing legend Joe Petruc
ci, Stanford's Director of Sailing,
the team had no trouble in going
undefeated.

Because the final race between
Stanford and Irvine was unnec
essary to determine the qualifiers,
it was never sailed, leaving open
the question of which team was
best in the region.
After three days of intense
racing, Stanford's sailors could
hardly afford to relax. With the
national championships only a
few weeks away, they will be re
turning to training almost imme
diately.
"We had to fight to qualify, but
the real fight is at nationals.
That's when we'll really show
them," Snape said.
