Senior Robert Yuan, the vic

last weekend at Stanford Sierra
Camp, will be remembered at
a memorial service today at 6
p.m. in Memorial Church.
Several faculty and friends
of Yuan will give tributes in
his honor, according to Dean
of the Chapel Robert Gregg.

later in his home town of Foun
tain Valley, Calif.
Yuan's parents and his
sister, Jennifer, a sophomore

their home for the funeral.
The El Dorado County
Sheriff department yesterday
released preliminary results of
Yuan's autopsy, which indi
cated that Yuan drowned after
succumbing to hypothermia

following about 45 minutes in
the cold water of FaJlen Leaf
Lake.
"There is no indication that
there were any narcotics or al
cohol involved," said Sgt. Jerry
Trackett of the sheriffs depart
ment, who added that the pre
liminary autopsy findings will
not be final until a toxicology
report is completed in two
weeks.
In another effort to honor
Yuan's memory, friends of his
will gather in front of Roble
Hall tonight at 8 p.m. and walk
together up to the Dish.
The staff at KZSU, where
Yuan worked for two years, will
honor Yuan today by playing
George Winston's December al
bum and Beethoven's Sixth
Symphony, Gregg said. Accord
ing to Gregg, KZSU is attempt
ing to remember the "differ
ent" kinds of music that Yuan
listened to and played when he
was a disc jockey at the station.
