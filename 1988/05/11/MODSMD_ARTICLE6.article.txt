# Solving the priority problem
## Residential dilemma 
### Erik Johnson 
In an attempt to end the
long-running controversy over
whether the University should
retain its returning residence
priority system, a student ad
visory committee will meet
with resident fellows and the
director of Univeristy housing
during the next month.
In a meeting last night at
Storey House, members of the
Housing Operations Advisory
Committee (HOAC), a group
with student members and two
resident fellows, held a forum
with Director of University
Housing Rodger Whitney to
hear student concerns over the
issue of returning residency.
Under the University's re
turning residence system, stu
dents who wish to live in the
same house for more than one
year receive preferred status to
do so in the Draw.
The meeting at Storey pro
vided a chance for vocal
proponents of both sides of the
issue to air their views.
"Housing, as it is now with
the returning residency, is in
equitable. People want a fair
shot" at the more desirable
housing, current Council of
Presidents member Leonard
Adler said at the meeting.
However, residents of Alpha
Sig argued strongly that the
system should be kept intact.
The returning residency pro

vides the cohesion and conti
nuity that many places require
to maintain the a house's
quality, they said.
"Obviously, we've done
something right so people will
feel at home," Alpha Sig resi
dent Bruce Klein said, citing
the spirit of community that
is enjoyed at Alpha Sig.
Paul Von Der Lippe, another
Alpha Sig resident, also
stressed that many houses
need returning residency to en
sure the continuation of house
traditions. "People will not
want to put in as much effort
(in house activities) if they
know they are not coming back
next year."
HOAC acknowledges the
need for some exemptions if
returning residency is aban
doned. "There are already ex
empt spaces for places like
theme houses," Whitney said.
"Nothing will change with
those spaces. Most of the
spaces are programatic and
wouldn't be hurt. Theme
houses probably need that
sense of continuity."
Whitney named theme as
sociates, computer tutors,
house officers and financial
managers as some people who
would probably retain exempt
status if returning residence
were eliminated.
