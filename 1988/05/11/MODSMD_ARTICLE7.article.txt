# IFC elects officers for next year
## President-elect plans for greater interaction with minority groups 
### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
The Interfraternity Council last
night elected a new slate of
leaders, closing out a turbulent
year in which the body faced
strong criticism of its positions
on wet rush and its relations with
minority communities.
Kappa Alpha member Chris Er
lin, one of four fraternity mem
bers who vied for the presidential
spot, will head the IFC next year.
Three other officers were also
elected. Sigma Psi Epsilon mem
ber Todd Ortega, Theta Xi mem
ber Ryan Lordos and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon member Park Shaper, all
sophomores, were named vice
president, treasurer and public re
lations director, respectively.
No nominations for the posi
tions of secretary and community
service director were received,
though there are individuals who
have expressed interest in the po
sitions but could not attend the
meeting, according to outgoing
IFC President Vinny Frost. Those
positions will be filled at the IFC
meeting on May 24.
In speeches given by prospec
tive candidates last night, many
speakers seemed highly concerned
with improving the general image
of fraternities.
As the new leader of the fra
ternity community, Erlin, who is
a junior, said he plans to do even
more to increase communication
with the University and other
groups on campus, including mi
nority groups.

"Communication has to exist
between everyone," Erlin said.
"I'd like to see minority groups
included in many of our func
tions."
Also at last night's meeting, fra
ternity representatives volun
teered to assist the Black Greek
Letter Council, which coordinates
black fraternities and sororities,
in organizing the group's annual
Malcolm X rally.
Members of the Black Greek
Letter Council were not present
at the meeting.
Erlin said the issue of serving
alcohol during fraternity Rush is
still up for debate. Citing prob
lems with insurance coverage of
a wet rush, Erlin suggested a
phase-out plan in which alcohol
would be phased out of Rush over

several years.
In praising the exiting Frost,
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said "he has done a
fabulous job."
Pisano cited the ambitious
agenda undertaken by this year's
IFC as proof of the group's desire
to improve the fraternal system.
Among those goals were improve
ment of relations with the Uni
versity and other groups, in
creased public service and fine
tuning the workings of the IFC.
Echoing Pisano, Erlin praised
the performance of this year's IFC
Executive Committee as well.
"Rush was a success, and fra
ternities have increased public
service work and openness with
minority groups," Frost said.
