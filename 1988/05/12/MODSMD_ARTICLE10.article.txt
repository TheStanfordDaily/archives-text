# Sec. Bennett's legracy
## No change in store for U.S. Education Dept. 
### Nick Anderson Editorial staff 
With the resignation of U.S.
â– Secretary of Education William
[iennett effective mid-Sep
ember, Stanford will soon be
Yee of Bennett's criticisms of
he curriculum But his succes
*or will continue to enforce
Bennett's 'back to basics' pol
cv, department sources said.

Bennett, 44,
has repeatedly
attacked Stan
ford's curricu
lum change
from Western
Culture to Cul
tures, Ideas
and Values,
coming to
Stanford last

month to vilify what he called
political intimidation in the
Faculty Senate and appearing
on national TV in a debate with
University President Donald
Kennedy.
Aside from Stanford, many
national universities have also
horn the brunt of Bennett's
criticism for being "greedy" in
planning steep tuition in
creases.
The secretary, who has held
the post since 1985, said Mon
day he will not stay for the
final months of the Reagan ad
ministration, preferring to
write books and work more on
the lecture circuit.
Final confirmation of an in
terim caretaker for the depart
ment has not yet come from
the White House, but a depart
ment source said vesterdav

that the man Bennett prefers,
Undersecretary of Education
Linus Wright, can probably
count on filling out the final
months of Reagan's term, and
may even get consideration
from George Bush as depart
ment head if Republicans
retain control of the White
House next year.
Wright, 61, has been second
in command at the department
for less than a year and was
superintendent of the Dallas
school system for nine years
prior to his arrival in Wash
ington.
Wright was unavailable for
comment yesterday, but press
representative Michael Jackson
said Wright holds views similar
to Bennett in most policy mat
ters.
"Linus believes in everything
the Secretary says," Jackson
said.
Stanford Education Dean
Marshall Smith said yesterday
that Wright would probably
not implement much change in
policy. Smith criticized Ben
nett's attitude toward the job.
"What Bennett's done over the
last year has been disruptive,"
he said "He's slowed down the
education reform movement by
being negative."
However, Smith added that
Bennett "has been effective in
making use of the job as a bully
pulpit.' Smith said the position
has never been held by such
an outspoken person.
Bennett said earlier this
week he plans to spend his final
months in the post working
"full speed ahead "
