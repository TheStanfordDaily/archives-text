# Classics scholar hails non-Western cultures
## 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
Cornell Prof. Martin Bernal, "the talk
of all classics departments" according
to faculty here, spoke to a crowded au
dience at the Branner Lounge yesterday
about his new book "Black Athena."
The book, a national scholarly best
seller, argues that Greek civilization was
strongly influenced by Egypt and
Phoenicia. It rebukes the "Aryan
model," which argues that Greek
civilization is the result of Indo-
European invasions which overwhelmed
the native population. This model, Ber
nal says, was formed in the 1840s as
the result of racist ideologies widely held
at that time.

Racism became a European and
North American obsession in the 17th
century, said Bernal. In an attempt to
remove blacks from society, and to up
hold slavery, whites asserted that Egyp
tians were not black, and that the first
philosophers were not Egyptian, but
Greek, he said. In this manner, they
constructed a "double boundary" for the
blacks, he said.

Although the theo:y itself is not en
tirely new, scholars before Bernal have
not approached tl is subject in a
rigorous academic manner; nor has it
been written so lucidly or with such a
wealth of information, according to
Classics Prof. John Winkler.
Calling the book "the most exciting
revision in the last three centuries,"
Winkler compared Bernal's position in
academia to that of a "heretic in a
church."
Bernal denounced Western culture
programs that "treat texts as sacred
and outside of society." He added that
Western culture courses at colleges
throughout the country need revision,
and called the new CIV requirement at
Stanford "a committee compromise, the
least bad option."
"European culture had very substan
tial contributions from the outside," he
added.
Referring to Allan Bloom's book "The
Closing of the American Mind," Bernal
said "Bloom is trying to create an Ivory
Tower." He added that the book is a
symptom of the Reagan years.
"The Reaganite policies are so

destructive to American culture that the
only culture they can have is this
detached culture," he said.
According to Winkler, Bernal's
"revised ancient model" has not
replaced the Aryan model. Though the
theory has not been accepted as a new
orthodoxy,' Winkler said that critics
have not been very vocal.
Bernal cited Phoenicia as another so
ciety which contributed to Greek cul
ture, saying that though it was acknowl
edged academically until 1880, it was
dropped along with Egyptian history,
as the result of increased anti-semitism.
One audience member agreed with
Bernal and said that "the Holocaust
would have been impossible without the
Aryan model."
Black Athena" is the first of three
volumes, the second of which is expected
to be published in 1990, followed by
the third volume in 1993.
The lecture, called "Questioning the
Origins of Ancient Greek Culture," was
sponsored by the Afro-American Studies
Department as part of their spring se
ries.
