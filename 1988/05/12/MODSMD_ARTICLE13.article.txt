Banks raise prime lending rate
WASHINGTON — Big banks across the
country boosted their prime lending rate from
8.5 percent to 9 percent yesterday in response
to higher money-market interest rates and a
tighter anti-inflationary stance by the Federal
Reserve.
The rise in interest rates knocked Wall
Street for a loop, sending the Dow Jones in
dustrial average down 37.80 points to close at
its lowest level in three months. Higher rates
undermine the stock market by luring inves
tors away from stocks into interest-paying se
curities.
The nationwide increase in the prime rate,
which is used as a benchmark for a variety
of business and consumer loans, marks the
first time major banks have raised borrowing
costs since last October's stock market crash.
The prime rate increase will boost interest
rates on most home equity loans, which have
become an increasingly popular way of bor
rowing in the last year because they are one
of the few remaining ways available for indi
viduals to continue claiming a full tax deduc
tion for the interest costs.
Analysts said that they expected interest
rates to continue to creep upward this year,
but they contended that such increases pose
little risk of toppling the economy into a reces
sion in 1988.
"We're in the middle of an upward cycle in
interest rates," said John Wilson, chief econ
omist at Bank of America in San Francisco.
"But for us to go into recession, it would
require short-term interest rates moving well
into double digits."
Danish prime minister resigns
COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Danish Prime
Minister Poul Schlueter resigned yesterday,
and Queen Margrethe authorized negotiations
to begin for formation of a new government,
after Schlueter's minority coalition failed to
win an outright majority in Tuesday's elec
tions.
Schlueter said he was confident he would
be able to re-establish his center-right, four
party group, with added support from else
where in Parliament.
But the inconclusive nature of the vote, and
early signs of the direction of the negotiations,
made that prospect far from certain, and the
possibility of a center-left government led by
the Social Democratic Party could not be ruled
out. A new government is not expected for at
least a week.
Rather than resolving the principal issues
in the campaign — Denmark's somewhat
equivocal position as a non-nuclear member
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the need lor a firm majority government on
one side or the other — the* election appears
for the moment to have left the situation as
muddled as ever.
British turncoat dies in USSR
Harold 'Kim" Philby, the last surviving
member of the triumvirate of spies who shook
the British espionage system to its marrow
30 years ago, died yesterday in Moscow. He
was 76.
A British Foreign Office press representative
made the announcement in London, saying
"We were told by the Soviet Embassy that he
died today (yesterday). We don't know what
of, or how, or the circumstances, just that he
died."
The defection to the Soviet Union of British
diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Mac Lean
in 1951 led to Philby s discovery more than
a decade later as one of the most important
double agents in the history of espionage.
He had been a murky figure through his
years of exile, surfacing only periodically and
most recently in interviews last October on a
Latvian state television station and again in
February on a Moscow TV program dedicated
to British author Graham Greene. Greene and
Philby had been longtime friends and col
leagues in British intelligence circles before
Philby's defection in 1963.
For 30 years he was both a leader of the
British secret service — MI-6 — and a "mole"
for the Sonet Union, taking the heart of the
secrets he learned as a senior British agent
and passing them along to his Russian con
tacts,
4 guerrillas nabbed in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Four
white African National Congress guerrillas
were arrested and a weapons cache, described
as the largest ever uncovered in South Africa,
was confiscated during a predawn raid at a
farmhouse, police said yesterday.
The guerrillas, three men and a woman,
reportedly formed a "highly specialized terror
unit." Among the arms seized was a surface
to-air missile, as well as land mines, hand
grenades, Soviet-made assault rifles and ma
chine guns and handguns with silencers, a
police spokesman said
Adriaan Vlok, the minister of law and order,
said: "This is further tangible proof that the
real character and nature of the ANC is a
violent terrorist organization Their aim is one
thing — the death and mutilation of innocent
people, regardless of race or color."
For 28 years the African National Congress,
outlawed in South Africa, has been fighting a
guerrilla war against the white minority-led
government African National Congress offi
cials say their policy is to attack primarily
government and economic targets, although
they concede that civilian casualties have been
unavoidable.

be able to re-establish his center-right, four
party group, with added support from else
where in Parliament.
But the inconclusive nature of the vote, and
early signs of the direction of the negotiations,
made that prospect far from certain, and the
possibility of a center-left government led by
the Social Democratic Party could not be ruled
out. A new government is not expected for at
least a week.
Rather than resolving the principal issues
in the campaign — Denmark's somewhat
equivocal position as a non-nuclear member
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the need lor a firm majority government on
one side or the other — the* election appears
for the moment to have left the situation as
muddled as ever.
British turncoat dies in USSR
Harold 'Kim" Philby, the last surviving
member of the triumvirate of spies who shook
the British espionage system to its marrow
30 years ago, died yesterday in Moscow. He
was 76.
A British Foreign Office press representative
made the announcement in London, saying
"We were told by the Soviet Embassy that he
died today (yesterday). We don't know what
of, or how, or the circumstances, just that he
died."
The defection to the Soviet Union of British
diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Mac Lean
in 1951 led to Philby s discovery more than
a decade later as one of the most important
double agents in the history of espionage.
He had been a murky figure through his
years of exile, surfacing only periodically and
most recently in interviews last October on a
Latvian state television station and again in
February on a Moscow TV program dedicated
to British author Graham Greene. Greene and
Philby had been longtime friends and col
leagues in British intelligence circles before
Philby's defection in 1963.
For 30 years he was both a leader of the
British secret service — MI-6 — and a "mole"
for the Sonet Union, taking the heart of the
secrets he learned as a senior British agent
and passing them along to his Russian con
tacts,
4 guerrillas nabbed in S. Africa
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Four
white African National Congress guerrillas
were arrested and a weapons cache, described
as the largest ever uncovered in South Africa,
was confiscated during a predawn raid at a
farmhouse, police said yesterday.
The guerrillas, three men and a woman,
reportedly formed a "highly specialized terror
unit." Among the arms seized was a surface
to-air missile, as well as land mines, hand
grenades, Soviet-made assault rifles and ma
chine guns and handguns with silencers, a
police spokesman said
Adriaan Vlok, the minister of law and order,
said: "This is further tangible proof that the
real character and nature of the ANC is a
violent terrorist organization Their aim is one
thing — the death and mutilation of innocent
people, regardless of race or color."
For 28 years the African National Congress,
outlawed in South Africa, has been fighting a
guerrilla war against the white minority-led
government African National Congress offi
cials say their policy is to attack primarily
government and economic targets, although
they concede that civilian casualties have been
unavoidable.
