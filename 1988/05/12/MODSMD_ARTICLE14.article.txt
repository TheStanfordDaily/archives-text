# House approves defense spending bill
## Reagan scores big victory as Senate narrowly overturns SDI freeze proposal 
### 
WASHING lON — The House ap
proved a $300 billion defense bill for
next fiscal year yesterday as President
Reagan's high-priority Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI) narrowly es
caped a serious blow from the Senate.
Then the president scored another
victory in the Senate as it voted 51
to 45 last night to shelve a proposal
to freeze deployment of strategic, or
long-range, nuclear weapons as an "in
terim restraint measure to prevent
an arms escalation until a U.S.-Soviet
strategic arms reduction treaty
(START) can be negotiated.
But the Reagan administration ap
peared to be bowing to growing con
gressional pressure for more use of
military forces to stop the flow of nar
cotics into the United States. The
House included such a provision in its
bill, transferring funds for the effort
from monies it had trimmed from the
SDI program.

The Senate is expected to consider
a similar but less sweeping proposal
for expanding the military's role in
drug interdiction later this week.
White House press representative
Marlin Fitzwater said the administra
tion has become "amenable to the
idea and quoted Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci as indicating to a group
of Republican lawmakers that he was
"not unalterably opposed" to such a
move.
I he House version of the huge mil
itary authorization bill for fiscal 1989
was approved, 252 to 172, after nearly
three weeks of debate during which
the House also voted to constrain the
deployment of nuclear weapons into
the next administration.
As the Senate began consideration
of similar arms control measures in
connection with its version of the mil
itary budget, it narrowly rejected a
$<00 million cut from committee

approved spending for SDI that would
have denied even a modest increase
for the controversial "Star Wars" anti
missile program next year.
In a series of cliff-hanging votes,
during which opposing sides competed
on the Senate floor to switch the votes
of a handful of wavering members,
the Senate rejected, resurrected, then
rejected again a move to limit oul
spending to $3.85 billion by transfer
ring $700 million from SDI to the
space program.
This move, pushed by Sen. J. Ben
nett Johnston, D-La., would have cut
SDI spending for next year below this
year's level of $3.9 billion, virtually
guaranteeing a substantial congres
sional cutback in the defense program
for the first time.
On a third and final roll call, the
Senate voted 50 to 48 to stick with
the Armed Services Committee's rec
ommendation of $4.55 billion for the

A J.
program. Reagan had proposed $4.9
billion for SDI. The House approved
$.3.5 billion. The Senate vote indicates
a likely House-Senate compromise of
about $4 billion, allowing a small in
crease over current spending.
In pushing for the $700 million
transfer from SDI to the space pro
gram, Johnston and his allies con
tended it was the only way to finance
a new space shuttle and free up funds
for the U.S. space station, an argu
ment that picked up some votes from
senators whose states have a big stake
in the space program.
I here s not going to be enough
money to do the space station without
this, argued Johnston, contending
that the space station had important
defense implications and deserved a
higher priority than additional funding
for SDI. 6
