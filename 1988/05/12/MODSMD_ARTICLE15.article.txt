# Reagan endorses Bush

### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan, in a surprisingly brief and
unadorned announcement, endorsed
Vice President George Bush for the
presidency yesterday evening.
"I'm going to work as hard as I can
to make Vice President George Bush
the next president of the United
States," Reagan said.
The endorsement, though expected,
had been held in abeyance until Bush
had locked up the Republican Party's
presidential nomination. It followed by
several hours Pat Robertson's an
nouncement that he would officially
abandon his campaign next week and
support Bush.
After meeting with the one remain
ing candidate in the Republican pres
idential race, Robertson told reporters
at the White House: "We are going to
be working harmoniously and in unity
together and, of course, I am whole
heartedly endorsing the vice president
for the presidency of the United States.
The race is now over."
In his prepared text, the president
mentioned Bush by name only twice.
Reagan recited a one-sentence resume
of the jobs held by the vice president,
whom he called "my candidate": mem
ber of Congress, ambassador to China,
ambassador to the United Nations, di
rector of the Central Intelligence
Agency and national chair of the Re
publican Party.
Although his endorsement may have
appeared unenthusiastic, Reagan said:
"I intend to campaign as bard as I
can."
Whatever the case, the value of the
Reagan endorsement was questioned
by some analysts. Political scientist

Larry Sabato of the University of Vir
ginia, citing Bush's difficulty in estab
lishing an identity separate from that
of Reagan, said the candidate risked
being overshadowed by the president.
"I know Reagan can energize his
base more than most politicians, but
Bush is still almost completely unde
fined, said Sabato, who has studied
the impact of endorsements and the
transferability of political popularity.
As for Robertson's endorsement,
Sabato called it "a blessing and a
curse."
"It helps to some degree with the
fundamentalists, but I'm not certain
that he doesn't drive away more voters
than he attracts, especially among
young people. And I don't know that
he can particularly motivate his base
of fundamentalist Christians" to vote
for Bush, he added.
As predictable as it was — the pres
ident endorsing his vice president of
eight years — Bush was surely relieved
to get the support behind him. In the
last two weeks, a growing number of
questions confronted the vice presi
dent on the campaign trail: Why the
delay in the endorsement? Is there a
-problem-between Bush and the pres
ident?
Some Bush campaign advisers were
disappointed that the endorsement be
came such an exclusive late-night gala
for party insiders, rather than a care
fully orchestrated midday event geared
toward showing the president embrac
ing his vice president in plenty of time
for broadcast on evening television
news.
As Robertson made his endorse
ment, standing on a driveway in front

of the White House West Wing, Bush
surveyed the scene — the vice presi
dent's one remaining opponent sur
rounded by reporters and television
camera crews, offering his uncondi
tional support.
Bush, interrupting a five-minute
photo session with members of the
National Advisory Council to the Small
Business Administration, stood on the
second-floor balcony of his office across
a private street from the White House
and raised his arms in a victory salute
over his head.
Robertson said he was encouraging

his supporters "to continue the
struggle that they have been under
taking for conservative values in
America, adding: "I feel that virtually
to a man or a woman, they will be
unified as Republicans this fall to sup
port the Republican ticket."
He said that he was not seeking the
vice presidential nomination and that
he would not consider running in 1992
if Bush wins in November. But he
acknowledged that, if Bush loses, he
might resume his own candidacy in
the next presidential election.
