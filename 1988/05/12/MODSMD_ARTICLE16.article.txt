WASHINGTON — Seven mem
bers of a revolutionary group pro
testing U.S. international and do
mestic policies have been indicted
for setting off a time bomb in the
U.S. Capitol in 1983 and commit
ting seven other terrorist bom
bings here and in New York, of
ficials said yesterday.
The indictment, announced by
U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens,
charged that the seven suspects
— all but one of whom is in prison
on other charges — belonged to
a self-described secret "commu
nist politico-military organiza
tion" and resorted to the terrorist
acts to protest and influence U.S.
domestic and international poli
cies.
The Capitol explosion, which
took place at night in an alcove
close to the Senate chamber, could
have caused extensive loss of life
if the Senate had not canceled a
scheduled evening session, au
thorities said after the Nov. 7,
1983, incident. The bombing
resulted in much tighter security
measures at the Capitol and else
where in Washington that are still
in effect.

In addition to the Capitol bomb
ing, the indictment charged the
seven with conspiring to detonate
explosives at three Washington
military facilities and a number
of sites in New York, including
an FBI office on Staten Island,
the Israeli Aircraft Industries
Building, the South African Con
sulate and the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association.
Ihe conspirators also were
charged with surveying other
bombing targets as part of their
"armed propaganda" campaign,
including the Old Executive Office
Building adjacent to the White
House, the U.S. Naval Academy
in Annapolis and the Army Aber
deen Proving Ground in Mary
land.
Defendants include Elizabeth
Duke, who is being sought as a
fugitive, Laura Whitehorn, Linda
Evans, Marilyn Buck, Susan
Rosenberg, Timothy Blunk and
.Man Berkman, all of whom are
incarcerated for other crimes, ac
cording to a Department of Jus
tice press representative.
