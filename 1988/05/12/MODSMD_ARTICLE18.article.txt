# U.S. offers to drop charges; still no word from Noriega
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan ad
ministration, in a dramatic reversal, has
offered to dismiss drug-trafficking
charges against Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega if Noriega will
accept a proposed deal to resign as
Panama's military commander and de
facto ruler, according to U.S. govern
ment sources.
No agreement between the adminis
tration and Noriega has been struck,
sources said, adding that secret negoti
ations under way between the adminis
tration and the general could collapse.
Michael Kozak, a deputy assistant sec
retary of state who has played a leading
role in the talks with Noriega, is believed
to be in Panama, according to U.S. and
Panamanian opposition sources.
NBC News reported that the deal
would require the United States to drop
the federal criminal charges against Nor
iega and Noriega, in return, to agree to
leave power and his country on Aug.
12, the sixth anniversary of his becoming
Panama's military chief Elections
would take place in 1990, after which
Nonepi would be allowed to return to
Panama And henceforth, Panama's
defense chiefs would serve a single five
vear term
While neither confirming nor denying
any details, the White House said last
night that discussions with Noriega are
continuing but declined to comment fur
ther.
In Panama City, Reuter reported, the
Panamanian government said "there
has been no agreement on any subject"
and that reports of a possible deal "form
part of the confusion and confrontation
provoked by specific elements of the
Washington establishment."
Noriega and officials from the State
Department and other U.S. agencies
have negotiated on and off in recent
months in an attempt to find an accept
able formula for his removal
Former aides and Panamanian oppo
nents have said one of Noriega's main
concerns had been the drug indictments.
Noriega was charged in two drug
trafficking indictments returned in Feb
ruary bv federal grand juries in Miami
and Tampa, Fla He is accused of pro
viding protection and other government

Federal law enforcement officials in
volved in the investigations and Secre
tary of State George Shultz and other
administration officials have insisted
that they would not agree to drop the
charges as part of efforts to ease Noriega
from power.
"He has been indicted in this country,
and I'm sure the Justice Department
intends to prosecute him if it can . . .
that's our position," Shultz said at a
March 12 White House briefing.
Despite intense U.S. economic and po
litical pressures, including cutting off
aid and freezing Panamanian bank ac
counts, the administration has not been
able to dislodge Noriega, whose con
tinuance in power has become a
embarrassment to the United States.
Ihe proposal to drop the charges
against Noriegea drew almost immediate
criticism on Capitol Hill and from law
enforcement officials.
"If the rumors are true, I would be
very unhappy," said Richard Gregorie,
the chief assistant U.S. Attorney in
Miami, who supervised the Noriega in
vestigation there. "I don't control
foreign policy or executive decisions . .
(but) I just don't see the right side."
Law enforcement officials said the

to have the charges dismissed The U.S
attorneys in Miami and Tampa can have
the charges dropped, or it could be done
by Attorney General Edwin Meese 111
