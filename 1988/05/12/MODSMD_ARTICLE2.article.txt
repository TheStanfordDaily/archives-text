# Prof, charges unfairness
## Says faculty hiring discourages minority, female applicants 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
A non-competitive hiring procedure de
signed to recruit top scholars to the Uni
versity discourages minority and female
applicants to faculty positions, according
to Asst. Sociology Prof. Henry Walker.
University departments normally hire
faculty members after conducting a nation
wide search during which they advertise
the opening, accept applications and offer
the position to the best candidate.
In some cases, however, the provost and
the dean give departments permission to
waive a national search. These waivers are
known as "target for opportunity" waivers
and are usually used only to bring "distin
guished senior faculty members" to the
University, according to Prof. John Shoven,
chair of the Economics Department.
According to Walker, these waivers
create an "unfavorable climate" among mi

nority and female scholars who feel the
non-competitive hiring procedures are in
herently discriminatory.
Women and minorities are then less
likely to apply for positions when they feel
the hiring and promotion process is
"rigged," Walker added.
Officials from the Provost's Office dis
agreed with Walker's criticism of the target
for opportunity waiver system.
Provost James Rosse, who has the final
decision on whether departments receive
waivers, called the target for opportunity
system a "carefully managed process."
"The target for opportunity hiring pro
cedure should not discourage minorities
and women from applying (for faculty po
sitions)," he added.
According to Elizabeth Ball, a staff as
sociate in the Provost's Office, the target
for opportunity hiring procedure is used
