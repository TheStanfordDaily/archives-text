# Prof, charges unfairness
## Says faculty hiring discourages minority, female applicants 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
A non-competitive hiring procedure de
signed to recruit top scholars to the Uni
versity discourages minority and female
applicants to faculty positions, according
to Asst. Sociology Prof. Henry Walker.
University departments normally hire
faculty members after conducting a nation
wide search during which they advertise
the opening, accept applications and offer
the position to the best candidate.
In some cases, however, the provost and
the dean give departments permission to
waive a national search. These waivers are
known as "target for opportunity" waivers
and are usually used only to bring "distin
guished senior faculty members" to the
University, according to Prof. John Shoven,
chair of the Economics Department.
According to Walker, these waivers
create an "unfavorable climate" among mi

nority and female scholars who feel the
non-competitive hiring procedures are in
herently discriminatory.
Women and minorities are then less
likely to apply for positions when they feel
the hiring and promotion process is
"rigged," Walker added.
Officials from the Provost's Office dis
agreed with Walker's criticism of the target
for opportunity waiver system.
Provost James Rosse, who has the final
decision on whether departments receive
waivers, called the target for opportunity
system a "carefully managed process."
"The target for opportunity hiring pro
cedure should not discourage minorities
and women from applying (for faculty po
sitions)," he added.
According to Elizabeth Ball, a staff as
sociate in the Provost's Office, the target
for opportunity hiring procedure is used

only on rare occasions and most
often to make senior faculty ap
pointments.
But Walker said some Univer
sity departments abuse the target
for opportunity procedure. The
non-competitive hiring procedure
should not be used with junior
faculty, Walker said, because they
have not had a chance to prove
themselves.
Walker's criticisms were aimed
mainly at the Sociology Depart
ment, which has hired two junior
faculty members this year using
target for opportunity waivers.
Sociology Chair Joseph Berger
defended his department. "These
hirings were done according to
well-established rules, procedures
and precedents of the University,"
he said. "The hirings were au
thorized and approved by the ap
propriate University officials."
According to Berger, the two
assistant professors hired were
"extremely qualified."

"We competed with half a dozen
other top universities to get these
people," Berger said.
However, some other depart
ment heads said the target for
opportunity waivers should be
used only sparingly. English
Chair Albert Gelpi and Shoven,
for example, said the waivers
should only be used to hire
scholars who are already at the
top of their field.
"They (target for opportunity
waivers) are useful mechanisms
for bringing people to Stanford,"
Gelpi said. "But I only think of
them in terms of bringing super
stars to the department."
According to Gelpi, English has
only used target for opportunity
waivers twice in his three years
as department chair.
While the waivers are invoked
more often in the Economics De
partment, Shoven said, they are
used only to fill senior faculty po
sitions.
When the Economics Depart
ment has a specific professor in
mind, it sends out between 15
and 20 letters of recommendation

to scholars who know the candi
date.
These letters ask scholars to
compare the candidate to other
top people in the field, Shoven
said. They also ask scholars to
suggest minority or female candi
dates who might be qualified for
the position, he added.
According to Shoven, this proc
ess is not exclusionary and it is

not abused — at least in the Eco
nomics Department.
"We haven't overlooked minor
ities and women," he said.
In fact, one of the two profes
sors hired by the Economics De
partment this year using target
for opportunity waivers was Prof.
Don Brown, former chair of the
economics department at Yale.
Shoven called him "perhaps the
best black economist in the na
tion."
But Shoven acknowledged the
target for opportunity waiver sys
tem has the potential to be
abused.
"If a department essentially
hires a person and then gets let
ters of recommendation to justify
their action, after the fact, that
would be abusive," Shoven said.
Shoven also agrees with Walker
that the target for opportunity
system could be abused if waivers
were used to hire unproven junior
faculty members.
He added that junior faculty po
sitions should be open to all can
didates and that junior faculty
hiring should be "routine."

While the waivers are invoked
more often in the Economics De
partment, Shoven said, they are
used only to fill senior faculty po
sitions.
When the Economics Depart
ment has a specific professor in
mind, it sends out between 15
and 20 letters of recommendation

These hirings were
done according to
well-established
rules, procedures and
precedents of the Uni
versity. We competed
with half a dozen
other top universities
to get these people.'

to scholars who know the candi
date.
These letters ask scholars to
compare the candidate to other
top people in the field, Shoven
said. They also ask scholars to
suggest minority or female candi
dates who might be qualified for
the position, he added.
According to Shoven, this proc
ess is not exclusionary and it is

not abused — at least in the Eco
nomics Department.
"We haven't overlooked minor
ities and women," he said.
In fact, one of the two profes
sors hired by the Economics De
partment this year using target
for opportunity waivers was Prof.
Don Brown, former chair of the
economics department at Yale.
Shoven called him "perhaps the
best black economist in the na
tion."
But Shoven acknowledged the
target for opportunity waiver sys
tem has the potential to be
abused.
"If a department essentially
hires a person and then gets let
ters of recommendation to justify
their action, after the fact, that
would be abusive," Shoven said.
Shoven also agrees with Walker
that the target for opportunity
system could be abused if waivers
were used to hire unproven junior
faculty members.
He added that junior faculty po
sitions should be open to all can
didates and that junior faculty
hiring should be "routine."
