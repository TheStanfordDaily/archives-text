## Upgrade libraries 
### 
AN OLD TWILIGHT ZONE
episode tells the story of a
man who loved to read. But
books are prohibited in his world.
The man sneaks into a library,
finds millions of books, but breaks
his glasses and is unable to read
them.
Stanford's library system toes
that line. The resources here would
delight any world-class scholar, yet
they are almost impossible to use.
The University Library System
needs to join the modern age. Re
sources should be easily accessible
for all students.
Presently, Meyer and Green
close at midnight, but reference
librarians are there only until 10
p.m. Course schedules and jobs
prohibit many students from doing
research during the day, but when
they use the library late at night,
no one is there to help them.
A reference librarian should be
available during all times a library
is open; without them, libraries
cannot fully serve the public.
In addition, Stanford must es
tablish a uniform time schedule
for all libraries. Students research
ing at Meyer or Green may find
that the material they want is at
a smaller library, such as the Jack
son Business Library or the Art
and Architecture Library.
But these smaller libraries close
liâ€¢i. * - . ..
early at night and are only partially
open during weekends. Again the
irony is that these libraries are not
open when the students need them
most.
To facilitate research, the libra
ries' online card catalog, Socrates,
needs to be expanded and im
proved. The Law Library has only
one Socrates terminal; the Jackson
Library has none. Socrates must
be widely available in all libraries.
The Socrates software should be
more user-friendly and its listings
more up-to-date.

The "current periodical" section
of most libraries is simply not cur
rent. Students who use Meyer
would be lucky to find a magazine
less than three weeks old or a sci
entific bulletin less than three
months old.
Presently, all periodicals are
received in Green and then distrib
uted to Meyer. Green must shorten
its distribution time if it wants
these periodicals to be of any value
at all.
Check-out procedures are pain
fully slow and archaic. Fortunate
ly, the University plans to install
a computerized self-service circula
tion system within the next three
to five years.
Access to the libraries will be
much easier if a laminated ID is
introduced. But until then, libra
ries must employ more people to
improve checkout service.
There are some encouraging
developments in the libraries, es
pecially Meyer.
Future plans for Meyer include
complete internal redecoration.
The new designs were made by an
architect who used student and
faculty input from a poll taken last
spring. The redecoration will take
place on a floor-by-floor basis so
that the library remains open.
The plans include creating a sep
arate 24-hour area for relaxation
and eating. This will make Meyer
a better place for studying.
Students often complain that
Meyer is noisy. But all should
make an effort not to socialize in
the library. The staff is not there
to police students, but rather to
assist them in using the library.
As a top university, Stanford
needs to place a greater priority
on upgrading its library facilities.
What good is a library if no one
can use it?
