## SDI research Should Stanford accept weapons research funding?

PRO

Regarding the Strategic
Defense Intiative, the
Stanford community
ought to make a special
effort to resist its usual
presumption of self
importance. In fact,

whether Stanford — and places like it
around the country — do or do not take
SDI research contracts will not affect the
U.S. government's ability to defend the
American people against ballistic mis
siles. That is because, contrary to con
ventional wisdom, anti-ballistic defense
is not a mystery of science.
True, in 1983, the president, perhaps
under the influence of astrologers and
certainly under the influence of bureau
crats, redefined this country's work on
anti-ballistic missile defenses into an end
less tail-chase between impossible re
quirements and exotic technologies, a
welfare program for scientists.
And so, since 1983 the Pentagon has
been making tvme, all the while giving
out research contracts that are some
times technically interesting but that
have no relationship to any program
which would actually destroy ballistic
missiles in flight.
If such a program were to exist, it
would look very different from the cur
rent one. For one thing, university re
search would have almost no role in it,
just as university research played almost
no role in the development of ballistic
missiles between 1955 and 1961.
In 1961, the bureaucracy was solid in
its recommendation that much research
should precede the commitment to go to
the moon. Kennedy, however, knew that
in real life things work the other way
around, and the only way new things are
to be done is by taking the tools at hand
and making the best of them as quickly
as possible.
When a future president, taking a leaf
out of Kennedy's book, will tell the Pen
tagon's slothful bureaucrats "build an

somebody who will," the industrial con
tractors will alreadly have in hand more
than enough technology to do a respect
able job. The notion of a system that can
guarantee protection wastes time and
money and feeds all sorts of inefficiencies.
So do not fret. Nothing Stanford does
or does not do about SDI will change the
course of history.
Nevertheless, what Stanford does
about SDI will matter to the ethos of
Stanford. The Greek word "ethos" means
habit, and Stanford has developed some
bad ethics lately. It has gotten into the
habit of excluding (or not including) pro
fessors who do not commit themselves
to left-wing causes. It has gotten into
the habit of endorsing every trendy cause
that comes along. These habits are bad
in themselves and bad because they
alienate the students and the entire com
munity from the rest of the United
States.
We shouldn't forget this lovely yuppie
factory exists in peace and freedom be
cause a lot of our countrymen are spend
ing their lives in the defense of the U.S.
Shall Stanford be part of providing these
people the very best tools that can be
devised? The SDI program, such as it is,
is part of this country's military posture.
Stanford enjoys the benefits of U.S.
defense effort. It ought not to get into
the unethical and self-destructive habit
of disassociating itself from it.

has been an intermittent
debate at Stanford about
the ethics of doing work
related to weapons sys
tems. Some researchers
have said: "I don't know

anything about the weapons applications,
I just do basic science, and the Depart
ment of Defense just happens to fund
my kind of research."
Others said: "The use of my work is
a political question, and in a democracy
that's decided by the Congress." A more
honest expression of this point was made
by one researcher who said, "1 try not
to look down the road too far, I just do
what I think is interesting."

nologists are professionals, at the peak

sition carries with it a responsibility of
seeing their work in a social context.
They are not day laborers, but men of
power.
No responsible chemist would attempt
to justify the continued development of
new analogs of hallucinogenic drugs and
their uncontrolled release into society,
no matter how interesting' that work
might be. The proliferation of new and
more powerful weapons into the world
is now a social hazard no better controlled
than the drug trade.
The combination of the system of
secrecy behind which these weapons are
developed and the mystification that high
technology introduces has meant that
there is no meaningful review of decisions
by the political process. Even the military
chiefs are fed biased data to support a
new and "interesting" weapons Rystem.

decades.
In the 19605, an anti-ballistic missile
system was deployed despite a consensus
that it was incapable of performing any
useful mission. The war-gaming system
at Livermore was built with a skewed
data base so that it would be able to
show a more favorable tactical effect from
the neutron bomb which was then the
laboratory's most "interesting" system.
Scientists as independent professionals
can no longer take the irresponsible at

grant from a weapons-related agency
must be accompanied by a social impact
statement — a report that the principal
investigator has responsibly reviewed the
context of his work and is prepared to
assure his peers of the desirability of the
final application. Science is a search for
the truth, and truth exists in a social
context.

laboratory's most "interesting" system.
Scientists as independent professionals
can no longer take the irresponsible at
titude that the outcome of their work is
not their concern. The acceptance of a
grant from a weapons-related agency
must be accompanied by a social impact
statement — a report that the principal
investigator has responsibly reviewed the
context of his work and is prepared to
assure his peers of the desirability of the
final application. Science is a search for
the truth, and truth exists in a social
context.

Regarding the Strategic
Defense Intiative, the
Stanford community
ought to make a special
effort to resist its usual
presumption of self
importance. In fact,

whether Stanford — and places like it
around the country — do or do not take
SDI research contracts will not affect the
U.S. government's ability to defend the
American people against ballistic mis
siles. That is because, contrary to con
ventional wisdom, anti-ballistic defense
is not a mystery of science.
True, in 1983, the president, perhaps
under the influence of astrologers and
certainly under the influence of bureau
crats, redefined this country's work on
anti-ballistic missile defenses into an end
less tail-chase between impossible re
quirements and exotic technologies, a
welfare program for scientists.
And so, since 1983 the Pentagon has
been making tvme, all the while giving
out research contracts that are some
times technically interesting but that
have no relationship to any program
which would actually destroy ballistic
missiles in flight.
If such a program were to exist, it
would look very different from the cur
rent one. For one thing, university re
search would have almost no role in it,
just as university research played almost
no role in the development of ballistic
missiles between 1955 and 1961.
In 1961, the bureaucracy was solid in
its recommendation that much research
should precede the commitment to go to
the moon. Kennedy, however, knew that
in real life things work the other way
around, and the only way new things are
to be done is by taking the tools at hand
and making the best of them as quickly
as possible.
When a future president, taking a leaf
out of Kennedy's book, will tell the Pen
tagon's slothful bureaucrats "build an

somebody who will," the industrial con
tractors will alreadly have in hand more
than enough technology to do a respect
able job. The notion of a system that can
guarantee protection wastes time and
money and feeds all sorts of inefficiencies.
So do not fret. Nothing Stanford does
or does not do about SDI will change the
course of history.
Nevertheless, what Stanford does
about SDI will matter to the ethos of
Stanford. The Greek word "ethos" means
habit, and Stanford has developed some
bad ethics lately. It has gotten into the
habit of excluding (or not including) pro
fessors who do not commit themselves
to left-wing causes. It has gotten into
the habit of endorsing every trendy cause
that comes along. These habits are bad
in themselves and bad because they
alienate the students and the entire com
munity from the rest of the United
States.
We shouldn't forget this lovely yuppie
factory exists in peace and freedom be

ing their lives in the defense of the U.S.
Shall Stanford be part of providing these
people the very best tools that can be
devised? The SDI program, such as it is,
is part of this country's military posture.
Stanford enjoys the benefits of U.S.
defense effort. It ought not to get into
the unethical and self-destructive habit
of disassociating itself from it.

has been an intermittent
debate at Stanford about
the ethics of doing work
related to weapons sys

have said: "I don't know

anything about the weapons applications,
I just do basic science, and the Depart
ment of Defense just happens to fund
my kind of research."
Others said: "The use of my work is
a political question, and in a democracy
that's decided by the Congress." A more
honest expression of this point was made
by one researcher who said, "1 try not
to look down the road too far, I just do
what I think is interesting."

No responsible chemist would attempt
to justify the continued development of
new analogs of hallucinogenic drugs and
their uncontrolled release into society,

more powerful weapons into the world
is now a social hazard no better controlled
than the drug trade.
The combination of the system of
secrecy behind which these weapons are
developed and the mystification that high
technology introduces has meant that
there is no meaningful review of decisions

chiefs are fed biased data to support a

In the 19605, an anti-ballistic missile
system was deployed despite a consensus

data base so that it would be able to
show a more favorable tactical effect from
