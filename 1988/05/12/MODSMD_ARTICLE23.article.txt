C C T ET US not be afraid to outgrow
old thoughts and ways and
-I—4 dare to think on new lines as
to the future of the work under our care.
Let us not be poor copies of other uni
versities."
So said Jane Stanford in a 1904 speech,
according to an article in the May 16
issue of Time magazine. This week's
Time portrays Stanford as "brash and
exuberant," an institution that "jostles
the Ivies at the top ranks of U.S. uni
versities." Without a doubt, it is a com
plimentary article, but then it is praise
that is not entirely undeserved.
More than most schools, Stanford is a
challenging and dynamic place to be —
and though we criticize it often and ruth
lessly, it is an institution that deserves
credit for trying to achieve many ideals.
With the quickly approaching end of
the school year and the graduation of
another class, it's only fitting to take a
look, for a change, at the strong aspects
of Stanford life, at the questions that we
should keep asking of ourselves and our
school.
My first visit to Stanford left me
amazed at the youthfulness, diversity and
energy of the campus. I remember stand
ing in White Plaza during peak lunch
time traffic with the sun shining, colorful
scarves and jewelry merchants' sparkling,
bicycles everywhere, melodious jazz drift
ing in the air and so very many confident,
active people moving all about me.
It was a scene that left a strong im

pression in my mind. One that helped
me realize what was important about
Stanford — its openness to thought and
dissent and the opportunity it provides
for us all to find lifestyles that are per
sonally right and socially valuable.
It is clear that many of us have com
plaints about Stanford — this columnist
has had a fair share in making those
complaints. Yet it is important to peri
odically reaffirm the strengths of our
community. This year we at Stanford
have faced issues of student apathy, fra
ternity Rush, AIDS, University housing,
divesting from South Africa, ethnocen
trism in Western Culture, computer
privacy, the homeless problem, breaking
ties with the Hoover Institute, gay rights,
global environmental awareness and rac
ism.
While none of these issues have been
resolved, they have been raised and
provokingly challenged. There is a very
healthy relationship here between stu
dents and administrators, between
protest and change, between awareness
and activism.
It is blindly foolish to say Stanford is
a perfect school, that it is every student's
academic Utopia. It is not and neither
should it hope to be. Just as perfection
and complete satisfaction can't be ex
pected from the real world, neither can
we expect it from Stanford.
Nonetheless, we are able to learn here
that anything is possible with initiative
and work, that progress needs a voice,

that social responsibility must be part of
everyone's agenda.
The Pledge of Environmental and So
cial Responsibility illustrates this com
mitment well. The pledge askes those
graduating seniors who sign it to "con
sider the social and environmental im
plications of any job they may choose to
accept in the future." It is non-binding.
In the spirit of many of our policies, it
ojrpecta and invitee each individual to
make socially responsible decisions in a
world that is selfish, fast-paced and
materialistic.
We are taught here to think independ
ently, to question authority and to face
the consequences of our actions. As Jane
Stanford hoped, we are not a stagnating
pillar of knowledge, but a vitally growing
tree of knowledge.
The poet Ogden Nash once said
Americans were too foolishly meddlesome
to "leave well enough alone." At Stanford,
meddling is a game of progress and
change — and "well enough" is never
enough.
