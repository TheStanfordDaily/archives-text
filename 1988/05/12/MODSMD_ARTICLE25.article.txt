Stanford's panel
ensures animal care

THIS PAST November, 1 com
pleted my one year appointment
as ASSU representative to the
University's Panel on Laboratory
Animal Care. In following the current
controversies surrounding animal
research at Stanford, I thought it
might be helpful to provide a few
comments.
First, I have found Stanford commit
ted to the notion that animal research
should be conducted in only the most
thoughtful and humane manner. The
veterinary staff at Research Animal
Facility-1 is excellent and provides
outstanding animal care. Moreover, I
have toured the various animal facili
ties and have spoken with a variety of
investigators who use animals in their
research. These people are not bar
barians. They are researchers devoting
their energies towards solving scientific
and medical questions of wide impor
tance.
Second, PLAC is effectively carrying
out its mandate of overseeing the
entire research process as it affects
animals at Stanford. Committee mem
bers carefully review each protocol for
compliance with federal law and Na
tional Institute of Health guidelines
and the University's own rules on
animal research. In addition, the com
mittee considers and debates general
ethical issues which may be raised by
any particular experiment. Every ex
periment involving animals at Stanford
must pass these tests before it can be
conducted.
Third, the position of the animal
welfare movement should not be con
fused with that of the animal rights
movement. Opposing the construction
of RAF-2 is not an animal welfare
position. RAF-2 would provide state-of
the-art facilities for the housing and
care of research animals; construction
of this facility is applauded by those
who support animal welfare. However,
for those in the animal rights camp,
construction of any facility connected
with animal research can never be
supported.

Likewise, some members of the Palo
Alto Humane Society have argued that
they should be able to appoint their
own representative to PLAC. They
claim that an outside moniter from
their group is needed on PLAC to
ensure that the committee is faithfully
executing its duty. My experience on
the committee leads me to believe that
this demand is a red herring. These
individuals will never be satisfied with
Stanford's methods of animal research
nor with the work of PLAC. The goal
of the animal rights movement is
simple: the unconditional abolition of
all animal research.
Finally, what is perhaps most dis
tressing is the volume of gross mis
representations which are all too often
made by those in the animal rights
movement, including individuals in the
local community.
For example, I have seen serveral
flyers which cite examples of abhorrent
animal research allegedly being con
ducted at Stanford. When these claims
are actually investigated, however, they
have invariably turned out to be wildly
distorted or just plain false.
As another example, careful reading
of a December 23 letter to the Wall
Street Journal by members of the Palo

Alto Humane Society reveals at least
nine misleading or false assertions in
the 11-paragraph letter. Before the real
debate between those in the animal
rights movement and those supporting
humane animal research can be under
stood by the general public, educated
and honest dialogue will have to sur
face.
The public has a tremendous stake
in the outcome of the current debate
over the use of animals in research. At
least for the future, animal research
will be essential for progress in the
prevention, treatment and cure of a
wide range of medical illnesses.
I am an advocate for the improved
care and treatment of animals used in
research. Undoubtedly there are nu
merous members of local humane
societies who also support animal
research that is done properly and
humanely. The data shows that the
vast majority of the citizenry share
this view.
1 believe that these individuals, were
they to have served on PLAC, would
approve of the committee's work and
be proud of Stanford's commitment to
prudent and humane animal research.
