# Don't expel lawbreakers
## 
### 
I understand that Palo Alto Deputy
District Attorney Lance Beiser feels
that Stanford should expel students
who are guilty of theft on the scale of
the Fernandez case. I disagree.
A university's goal is education and
the pursuit of knowledge. This pursuit
should be open to everyone. In my
mind, only cases of plagiarism and
other directly academically-related
crimes should interfere with this pur
suit. Non-academic crimes should not
have academic punishments.
The larger question is what role
should various agencies in society, like

home, family, friends, religion and job,
take in punishing behavior which is
against the law. I don't think anybody
seriously advocates that any of these
groups should expel lawbreakers. Let
the law take care of that.
Beiser said that it would be ir
resposible to simply suspend Fernan
dez, but I agree with Cole's position
that our responsibility is to educate
and rehabilitate.
