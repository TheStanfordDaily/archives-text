# Palestinians misstated
## 
### 
As a visitor to the Stanford campus
where I am working on papers cover
ing the Middle East conflict which are
in the Hoover Institution Archives, I
was shocked to read Nathan Hochman
in Monday's paper.
In his column he refers to the threat
of Israel Knesset member Meir Kahane
"to kick all Palestinians out of Israel."
Lest he be accused of treason to the
Jewish state, he then adds: "Palestin
ian leaders have countered with similar
proposals to remove all Jews from the
Palestinian state." What Palestinian
state is he talking about?

There is an Israeli state, but there ii
yet no state of Palestine as called for
by Resolution 181 of 1947 of the
United Nations. And Palestinian
leaders, to my knowledge, have not
called for the removal of all Jews from
their state when and if, it is estab
lished.
It is such irresponsible journalism as
this that has made the achievement of
a Middle East peace with justice that
much more impossible.
