# Draw results confusing
## 
### 
Why are there 29 unfilled spaces in
Slavianskii? My roommate and I may
have drawn 4402, but we put this
house first on our Draw card with a
priority two.
People tell me there is an "assign
able pool" of numbers and that 4,402
is not one of them, but nobody seems
able to explain why there is an "as
signable pool" and why housing spaces
are not automatically filled.
Do those of us in this "pool" then
drown in housing anxiety until the fall
when we will camp on somebody's

floor while we hope to walk on? Is this
a plot to send students fleeing off
campus? Is the Draw supposed to
make sense?
