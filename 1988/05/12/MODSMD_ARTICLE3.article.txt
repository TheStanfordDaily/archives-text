# Challenges U.S. Defense Dept.
## Scientist ready for next court bout 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
Stanford computer scientist Clifford
Johnson will launch what may be the
last hearing of his lawsuit against the
U.S. "launch on warning" nuclear
defense system and then Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger tomorrow
in a San Francisco appeals court.
Johnson, a computer manager for the
Office of Information and Technology
Services, sued Weinberger in February
1984, charging that the "launch on
warning system" usurps presidential
and congressional power to declare war
Johnson claims this nuclear defense sys
tem takes the decision about firing a
retaliatory nuclear strike out of human
hands and leaves it in the hands, or

circuits, of computers.
Johnson's attorney
Tom Robertson says
these "computer er
rors" could cause the
United States to launch
a nuclear warhead
without an enemy war
head actually being
fired at the United
States.

Thus far in the four-year progress of
Johnson v. Secretary of Defense, no
court has ruled on these contentions.
Since the case began, courts have
deferred the issue, raising questions of
jurisdiction and citizenship.
Tomorrow morning's hearing before
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will
appeal a March 1987 District Court

ruling. That ruling held that Johnson's
case raises a political issue, not a legal
one, and is therefore outside the juris
diction of a court. Robertson said the
government will also challenge
Johnson s standing — as a British cit
izen — to raise the suit.
The hearing will be the second time
that this case has reached the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1985, the
court challenged Weinberger's tes
timony that Congress approves of
"launch on warning" because it ap
propriates money for the program.
Nonetheless, the case was dismissed on
other grounds.
This time Johnson and his lawyers

Alliance for Nuclear Arms Control
say they are optimistic about the
hearing. Two of the three judges
presiding over the case are
"liberals," they say, and the third
presiding judge was appointed to
the federal bench by President
Reagan.
It was unclear who would be
arguing the government's case in
the hearing, as several Defense
Department attorneys have been
involved in the lawsuit.
Johnson noted that the briefs
for the case were filed ". ith the
Pentagon and that "he would not
be surprised" if a Washington
lawyer flew out for tomorrow's
oral arguments.
But for the maverick computer
scientist, much more is at stake
than his lawsuit.
A "nuclear hair-trigger protest"
to "educate the federal govern
ment" about the risks of acciden
tal nuclear war will precede the
hearing tomorrow morning. It will

feature Johnson dressed as Amer
ican revolutionary Thomas Paine.
.Johnson will lead the protesters
in song and will also distribute
his own version of Paine's "Com
mon Sense" pamphlet.
"At least we've gotten people's
attention," Johnson said, his
British accent prominent. "I've
never tried this protest stuff
before but this may be our last
hearing and I've got to get our
message (about the risk of ac
cidental nuclear war) out."
