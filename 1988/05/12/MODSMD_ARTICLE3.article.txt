# Challenges U.S. Defense Dept.
## Scientist ready for next court bout 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
Stanford computer scientist Clifford
Johnson will launch what may be the
last hearing of his lawsuit against the
U.S. "launch on warning" nuclear
defense system and then Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger tomorrow
in a San Francisco appeals court.
Johnson, a computer manager for the
Office of Information and Technology
Services, sued Weinberger in February
1984, charging that the "launch on
warning system" usurps presidential
and congressional power to declare war
Johnson claims this nuclear defense sys
tem takes the decision about firing a
retaliatory nuclear strike out of human
hands and leaves it in the hands, or

circuits, of computers.
Johnson's attorney
Tom Robertson says
these "computer er
rors" could cause the
United States to launch
a nuclear warhead
without an enemy war
head actually being
fired at the United
States.

Thus far in the four-year progress of
Johnson v. Secretary of Defense, no
court has ruled on these contentions.
Since the case began, courts have
deferred the issue, raising questions of
jurisdiction and citizenship.
Tomorrow morning's hearing before
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will
appeal a March 1987 District Court

ruling. That ruling held that Johnson's
case raises a political issue, not a legal
one, and is therefore outside the juris
diction of a court. Robertson said the
government will also challenge
Johnson s standing — as a British cit
izen — to raise the suit.
The hearing will be the second time
that this case has reached the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1985, the
court challenged Weinberger's tes
timony that Congress approves of
"launch on warning" because it ap
propriates money for the program.
Nonetheless, the case was dismissed on
other grounds.
