RevieiJed by Chris. Myers
For several yearstiow, "The BilP
James- Baseball Abstract" has'
been for baseball fans what "The^*

Farmers' Almanac" used to be for
rural Americans: an annual guide
to the mysteries of the universe,
full of odcU:facts and statistics,
quirky hurtior and pithy-sayings.
much has changed
with the"3.988 the
Abstract: 'Qiere are stil] plenty of
baseball myths to be debunked,
and either a genius or

a pompous ass,. depending on
one's perspective — is the one to
do the debunking.
One thing, 'however, has
changed with the 1988 Abstract:
James is quitting the business, so
this Abstract is the last.
James apparently is tired of the
book-writing grind, and it's hard
to- blame him .— writing, the
Abstract is probably equivalent to
doing an honors thesis combined
with about a zillion problem sets
every year.
James started producing-the
Abstract in 1977, typing up arti
cles about teams and players,
photocopying them, stapling them
together and selling them out. of
his home. That went on for-four
years, until, in -1982, Ballantine
Hooks publishedlJames' book and
gave it national distribution
through bookstores.
. James' fias always been
the best of its kind because James
is 'an analyst, -not a number
cruncher. As fie says in -tis
lengthy valedictory at the end of
the 1988 Abstract, "I didn't care,
and don't care, whether Mike
Schmidt hit .306 or .296 against
left-handed pitching. 1 was.-con
cerned with what the statistics
mean."
James' methodology is simple:
He takes an accepted piece-, of
baseball wisdom or a baseball
question that-is being asked
widely — like, for instance, "How
will the new strike zone affect
pitchers and hitters?" — then
gathers relevant'statistics, creates
a formula, if necessary,
answer the question, and then
makes a conclusion.
sounds dry/ yes, but James's
writing is crisp, , light and-per
sonal. He explains his formulae
clearly and wntes with insight
and common sense. And~ he
rewards the careful reader,
burying fascinating bits of analy
sis on almost -every page-and
huilding throughout the boot on
comments that he made before.
This year, among

other things, the fallowing:

For several yearstiow, "The BilP
James- Baseball Abstract" has'
been for baseball fans what "The^*

Farmers' Almanac" used to be for
rural Americans: an annual guide
to the mysteries of the universe,
full of odcU:facts and statistics,
quirky hurtior and pithy-sayings.
much has changed
with the"3.988 the
Abstract: 'Qiere are stil] plenty of
baseball myths to be debunked,
and either a genius or

a pompous ass,. depending on
one's perspective — is the one to
do the debunking.
One thing, 'however, has
changed with the 1988 Abstract:
James is quitting the business, so
this Abstract is the last.
James apparently is tired of the
book-writing grind, and it's hard
to- blame him .— writing, the
Abstract is probably equivalent to
doing an honors thesis combined
with about a zillion problem sets
every year.
James started producing-the
Abstract in 1977, typing up arti
cles about teams and players,
photocopying them, stapling them
together and selling them out. of
his home. That went on for-four
years, until, in -1982, Ballantine
Hooks publishedlJames' book and
gave it national distribution
through bookstores.
. James' fias always been
the best of its kind because James
is 'an analyst, -not a number
cruncher. As fie says in -tis
lengthy valedictory at the end of
the 1988 Abstract, "I didn't care,
and don't care, whether Mike
Schmidt hit .306 or .296 against
left-handed pitching. 1 was.-con
cerned with what the statistics
mean."
James' methodology is simple:
He takes an accepted piece-, of
baseball wisdom or a baseball
question that-is being asked
widely — like, for instance, "How
will the new strike zone affect
pitchers and hitters?" — then
gathers relevant'statistics, creates
a formula, if necessary,
answer the question, and then
makes a conclusion.
sounds dry/ yes, but James's
writing is crisp, , light and-per
sonal. He explains his formulae
clearly and wntes with insight
and common sense. And~ he
rewards the careful reader,
burying fascinating bits of analy
sis on almost -every page-and
huilding throughout the boot on
comments that he made before.

other things, the fallowing:
