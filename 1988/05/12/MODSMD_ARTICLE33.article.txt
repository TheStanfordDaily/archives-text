ond-seeded Stanford women's
tennis team as it begins play this
afternoon at the NCAA Champi
onships in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal, 23-2, opens at 3
p.m. at UCLA's Los Angeles Ten
nis Center against Duke, a 5-4
winner in yesterday's first-round
match against Arizona.
Stanford is attempting to be
come the first women's tennis
team ever to win three straight
national championships. But in
today's match the Cardinal will
be without sensational freshman
Tami Whitlinger, who has a groin
injury that will probably keep her
out of the entire tournament.
Whitlinger suffered the injury
in her left leg almost a month
ago and aggravated it April 21 at
the Pacific 10 Conference Cham
pionships in Ojai. She was sched
uled to start hitting last weekend
in preparation for the NCAAs, but
her groin has shown no sign of
improvement. "It just hasn't been
healing up the way I'd hoped it
would," Whitlinger said yester
day.
"Tami is extremely doubtful,"
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan
said Monday. "She just hasn't
responded to treatment. She's not
even hitting."
Whitlinger will fly down to Los
Angeles this morning to join the
rest of the team, which left Tues
day. She will not play today, but
she will try to get out on the

court to test the groin. "The team
means a lot to me, and I really
want them to do well," Whitlinger
said. "If it's at all possible, I want
to play."
If Whitlinger is unable to play,
the Cardinal would be hard
pressed to beat Florida in a po
tential championship match-up
Sunday. "We might be the only
team that can beat them," said
Brennan, who added that with the
injury to Whitlinger the Gators
"must just be rubbing their hands
together now."
Top-seeded Florida has not lost
since February. The Gators beat
the Cardinal 5-4 in the final of
the national indoor championship
March 6 in Madison, Wis. If the
teams meet again, it will be a
rematch not only of their earlier
contest this season, but also of
last year's NCAA semifinal, when
the Cardinal eliminated the
previously-unbeaten and top
seeded Gators 5-1.
Talk of a Stanford-Florida
match-up may be premature,
however. Brennan said that the
Gators are almost a sure bet to
make Sunday's final, but his own
team will have to contend with
some lineup alterations.
The good news for the Cardinal
comes from two sources. Junior
Eleni Rossides, who has been out
with a groin injury since Feb. 7,
will return to the Stanford lineup
this afternoon. Whitlinger said
that Brennan indicated before the
team left that he would play Ros
sides at No. 5 singles.
"She's hitting the ball very
well," Brennan said Monday.
"[Eleni's] a very tough kid. She's
coming along a little faster than
I thought she would."

The tournament draw is also
in the Cardinal's favor. Arizona
and Duke would provide monu
mental challenges for Stanford in
men's basketball, but in women's
tennis they are heavy underdogs
to advance to the second round.
In tomorrow's quarterfinal, the
Cardinal would face the winner
of today's Georgia-Indiana match.
And Saturday in the semifinals,
third-seeded USC would likely be
the opponent. Even without Whit
linger, Stanford would match up
well with the Trojans. The Car
dinal beat USC twice this season,
clinching both matches in the
singles.
Brennan is confident that his
players can move up in the lineup
if Whitlinger can't play in the top
spot. "I thought that Lisa Green
was the best No. 2 player in the
country. I thought Teri Whit
linger was the best No. 3 player
in the country. I thought Sandra
Birch was the best No. 4 player
in the country, and I thought Kay
Tittle was the best No. 5 player
in the country," Brennan said.
All of these players will move
up a notch, led by Green, who
will occupy the No. 1 singles slot.
"She handles pressure very well.
She plays well in big matches,"
Brennan said of the sophomore.
"She won the Pac-10 champion
ship in front of a big crowd at
Ojai. I have a lot of confidence in
Lisa Green."
If Rossides plays at No. 5, junior
Cindy Buchsbaum will be in the
No. 6 spot. Buchsbaum has played
her best tennis of the season re
cently, according to Brennan.
"She really played great" in the
mixed doubles of the indoor ex
hibition match against California
last Saturday, he said. "She really

was just beaming and bouncing
out there. It did a world of good
for her confidence."
In doubles, Buchsbaum will join
freshman Teri Whitlinger on the
No. 2 team if Tami can't play.
Brennan had considered playing
Tami in doubles even if she
couldn't play in singles, but Tami
said yesterday that they had dis
carded that idea. "We've thought
about that, but with all the dif
ferent movements in doubles, it
could probably hurt [the groin]
even more."
Card notes
The NCAA individual tournament
begins Monday and lasts for four days.
Stanford qualified six players for the
singles, including Rossides, despite
the fact that she did not play in any
dual matches this season and has been
out of action for three months. "I was
very pleasantly surprised when she
was accepted into singles — with an
emphasis on both pleasantly and sur
prised," Brennan said.
Also qualifying were the Whitlin
gers, Green, freshman Birch and
senior Tittle. Tami Whitlinger said
she will not play in the individuals if
she does not play in the team tour
nament.
The teams of senior Cari Hagey-
Birch and Whitlinger-Whitlinger
received bids for the doubles tourna
ment.
In other first-round play yesterday,
Pepperdine beat Texas 5-2, Brigham
Young edged South Carolina 5-4 and
Trinity crushed Harvard 5-1. In
second-round play Kentucky shutout
Oklahoma State 6-0 and California
defeated Southern Methodist 5-2.
Today's match-ups in the second
round: Florida vs. Pepperdine, Stan
ford vs. Duke, USC vs. BYU, UCLA
vs. Trinity, Georgia vs. Indiana and
Miami vs. Arizona State.

btanford Coach Frank Brennan's Cardinal has won the national title
in four of the past six years but will need great play from Lisa
Green to add to his trophy collection. Green, who reached the
semifinals in last year's NCAA singles competition as a freshman
is expected to play No. 1 singles throughout this week's team
championships.
