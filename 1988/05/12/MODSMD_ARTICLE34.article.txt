# Stanford hoops Revving up during the off season
## 
### 
The bodies began to fly out of the
picture like in the old Mighty Mouse
cartoons, and our hero emerged from the
debris on the Maples Pavilion floor.

Eric Reveno.
And he sank a jump-hook. In fact, on
Monday afternoon Reveno missed only
one out of a couple dozen j-hooks, and

after that lone brick Maples shook with
a shout of "FnA," which I believe stands
for "Fear not, Arizona." Reveno can't
make 'em all.
But the Big Rev seems to be back,
because his back is back, or something
like that. He sat out last season because
of the out of whack lower back, but dur
ing the four-on-four non-coached scrim
mages, there was no evidence of Reveno
slack.
Indeed, Rev can do no wrong. He rarely
misses nowadays, and when he does it's
because someone surely fouled him. And
he never commits any fouls. Just ask
him. Well, maybe he has had, uh, six,
yeah, six fouls this spring. It's funny —
without the refs, Rev is a much cleaner
player.

With Rev, the rest of the Cardinal
players are (much?) better. They talk
about how when Rev takes the court he
lifts everyone up an intensity .notch-After
practicing against Eric, playing the rest
of the world will be a piece of cake.
For the rest of the world, those elbows,
thighs-in-the-butts and body-leans are
fouls. But not on Rev's Maples' junction.
Foul? Hee, hee. Now that's funny. Be
serious, buddy.
And then there is that majestic j-hook.
That doesn't stand for joke-hook, al
though it looks rather humorous. Does
it look more like someone putting on
deoderant while hopping on hot coals, or
like a big lunk doing a pirouette in the
shower? Let's settle for a "twine-seeking
roundhouse wrist-flick."

In any case, the sphere ends up at the
bottom of the net. If Rev's back holds
up, the Cardinal could find itself cutting
down some nets next year. ,

At Tuesday night's annual Stanford
basketball banquet, junior Todd Lichti
was given the Hank Luisetti Most Valu
able Player Award. Lichti averaged 20.1
points and 5.6 rebounds per game, was
named to the All-Pacific 10 Conference
team for the third straight year, and also
made honorable mention All-America in
several national publications. In addition,
Lichti was on the All Pac-10 Academic
team and his teammates voted him the
Most Inspirational Cardinal award.
The Cardinal players also voted senior
Greg Butler the Most Improved Player

Award. The 6-foot-11 Butler finally be
came an inside player this year, and the
scuttlebutt has Butler possibly going
the •latu-socond' onr third round of the
NBA draft.
The Howard Dallmar Coaches Award,
which is given to the Cardinal who excels
in on- and off-court leadership, went to
junior Howard Wright. Wright led the
Pac-10 in shooting percentage (62 per
cent) and card-playing (pair of 10s). Both
Wright and Lichti will attend the United
States Olympic Trials next week.
Junior Bryan McSweeney received the
Best Defensive Player award, although
he would rather have received the news
that Arizona's Sean Elliott was going
pro. McSweeney was also an honorable
mention All Pac-10 Academic selection.
