# Lichti and Wright to face the best at Olympic trials
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Before the Pan-American Games basketball
tryouts last summer, Indiana Coach Bob Knight
strolled out to deliver a preview monologue to the
hopefuls.
He talked about playing team defense, about help
ing each other out, and about making each other
look better. So who ended up on the U.S. team?
"Guys like Rex Chapman, Fennis Dembo and
Ricky Berry made the team," Stanford's Howard
Wright, who was at those tryouts, said with a
chuckle. "I'm not saying you have to be selfish, but
Todd (Lichti) and I have to look for our shot more."

Wright and Lichti will be looking for those shots
next week at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Colorado
Springs. The Cardinal juniors are among the 90-plus
Americans who have been invited to try to represent
their country at the Summer Olympics in South
Korea later this year.
After about a week of intense practices, the field
will be pared down to 20 players. Those 20 will
then join Olympic Coach John Thompson at George
town for an extended period before the final list of
12 players is named.
In his years at the helm of the Georgetown Bull
dogs, Thompson has stressed an aggressive, even
frenzied defense, and a physical offense. That type
of team could jive well under the looser and more
physical international rules.
"Thompson is going to look for people who can
get up and get after you," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. International ball is more phys
ical than we know in the NCAA, so he'll be looking
for guys who overlook being fouled. You can't pout
or bitch if you think you were fouled, or not hustle
— that's the stuff that can eliminate you."
With the experience of the Pan-Am trials and
National Sports Festival competition in their hip
pockets, Wright and Lichti will enter next week's
fiesta with a bit more wisdom than in the past.
The two Cardinal stars, however, have set different
goals for themselves.
Ever since Wright arrived at Stanford three years
ago, he has shimmered in a pool of potential. This
past season, Wright began to dip into that pool for
extended periods of time. The 6-foot-8 forward shot
62 percent from the field in conference play and
occasionally dominated Pacific 10 Conference games
on his way to All Pac-10 season.
Next week, however, Wright will be trying to
swim with the best of the best.
Realistically, I think my chances of making the
final 12 are pretty slim," Wright said. "But I have
a chance to take advantage of a great opportunity
to raise my stock in the pro scouts' eyes."
Scouts from the NBA will be out in force next
week to see the best sophomores, juniors and seniors
all in the same place.
"I think it's safe to bet that nobody will be holding
anything back," Wright said. "And that goes espe
cially for me, since my name is not established
nationally."
Wright has spent the last several weeks working
out with his Cardinal teammates in the afternoon
and then welghtlifting after practice. Both he and
Lichti return to the quiet confines of Maples Pavilion
at about 10 p.m. for an hour of individual shooting.
Although it will be almost impossible for Wright
and Lichti to help each other on the court at the

'I know I can hit from out
there, but I don't know if the
rest of the country does.'
— Todd Lichti

tryouts, they know the moral support is there.
"Our friendship developed a lot at the Pan-Am
Games, and being up against the best players, it
was a , help to be able to criticize each other each
night,' Wright said. "1 think it was an advantage
that some other players who went by themselves
might not have had."
Lichti may have a few more advantages than
Wright. Jirst, his name is at least recognized thanks
to some honorable mention All-America votes. Sec
ond, accuracy from 3-point range helped Brazil upset
the United States at the Pan-Am games, and if
Thompson goes looking for some sharpshooters,
Lichti will be in the picture.
"I'll be looking to score. 1 definitely think he'll
be looking for scorers," Lichti said. "Last year they
said 'We're not looking for scorers,' and when it
cam right down to it they took the guys who cast
the ball up."
Lichti is partaking in a regimen similar to
Wright's. When shooting from the outside he makes
sure he is about a foot behind the NCAA 3-point
line, where the international line would be. And he
doesn't miss many.
" I hat's probably where the NCAA line should be
too,' Montgomery said. "There was a lot of talk at
the NCAA meetings (about changing the 3-point
line), but nothing happened.
"Certainly Todd has that type of range," Mont
gomery added. "The extra foot is not going to affect
him strenght-wise."
If the Olympic coaches looked at a Lichti highlight
film, they would see not only straight-up 3-pointers,
but also some turnaround and fall-away treys. Even
Steve Kerr can't do that.
Hut Lichti will have to do that on the courts in
Colorado Springs, where the air is thin and the
pressure is high.
"1 here's going to be some pressure, but you can't
let that get to you," Lichti said. "I know I can hit
from out there, but I don't know if the rest of the
country does."
Although earlier this year NBA scout Dick
McCiuire said that Lichti needed to work on his
defense, the combination of the frantic Thompson

philosophy and the up-tempo international game
could play to the Cardinal guard's talents.
In fact, Lichti loves the fast break After some
times heing bottled up in Montgomery's set offense,
Lichti broke out for 34 running points against Ixmg
Beach State in the NIT. In the press room after
wards Lichti said, "I felt very comfortable in the
open court,"and Montgomery chuckled from the
needling.
T odd Lichti thinks he has a chance to make the
U.S. team.
I 11 just try to play the best defense I can. If I
play as well as I can, I think I can play with any
of the best there," Lichti said. "I'll just play all
out, and if I hit my shots, I think I've got a chance."

from out there, but I don't know if the rest of the
country does."
Although earlier this year NBA scout Dick
McCiuire said that Lichti needed to work on his
defense, the combination of the frantic Thompson

philosophy and the up-tempo international game
could play to the Cardinal guard's talents.
In fact, Lichti loves the fast break After some
times heing bottled up in Montgomery's set offense,
Lichti broke out for 34 running points against Ixmg
Beach State in the NIT. In the press room after
wards Lichti said, "I felt very comfortable in the
open court,"and Montgomery chuckled from the
needling.
T odd Lichti thinks he has a chance to make the
U.S. team.
I 11 just try to play the best defense I can. If I
play as well as I can, I think I can play with any
of the best there," Lichti said. "I'll just play all
out, and if I hit my shots, I think I've got a chance."

The U.S. Olympic trials will give junior
forward/center Howard Wright a great chance to
improve his stock with the pro scouts before his
senior season.


Junior swingman Todd Lichti hopes scoring buck
ets will be this easy at the U. S. Olympic trials
next week.
Before the Pan-American Games basketball
tryouts last summer, Indiana Coach Bob Knight
strolled out to deliver a preview monologue to the
hopefuls.
He talked about playing team defense, about help
ing each other out, and about making each other
look better. So who ended up on the U.S. team?
"Guys like Rex Chapman, Fennis Dembo and
Ricky Berry made the team," Stanford's Howard
Wright, who was at those tryouts, said with a
chuckle. "I'm not saying you have to be selfish, but
Todd (Lichti) and I have to look for our shot more."

Wright and Lichti will be looking for those shots
next week at the U.S. Olympic Trials in Colorado
Springs. The Cardinal juniors are among the 90-plus
Americans who have been invited to try to represent
their country at the Summer Olympics in South
Korea later this year.
After about a week of intense practices, the field
will be pared down to 20 players. Those 20 will
then join Olympic Coach John Thompson at George
town for an extended period before the final list of
12 players is named.
In his years at the helm of the Georgetown Bull
dogs, Thompson has stressed an aggressive, even
frenzied defense, and a physical offense. That type
of team could jive well under the looser and more
physical international rules.
"Thompson is going to look for people who can
get up and get after you," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. International ball is more phys
ical than we know in the NCAA, so he'll be looking
for guys who overlook being fouled. You can't pout
or bitch if you think you were fouled, or not hustle
— that's the stuff that can eliminate you."
With the experience of the Pan-Am trials and
National Sports Festival competition in their hip
pockets, Wright and Lichti will enter next week's
fiesta with a bit more wisdom than in the past.
The two Cardinal stars, however, have set different
goals for themselves.
Ever since Wright arrived at Stanford three years
ago, he has shimmered in a pool of potential. This
past season, Wright began to dip into that pool for
extended periods of time. The 6-foot-8 forward shot
62 percent from the field in conference play and
occasionally dominated Pacific 10 Conference games
on his way to All Pac-10 season.
Next week, however, Wright will be trying to
swim with the best of the best.
Realistically, I think my chances of making the
final 12 are pretty slim," Wright said. "But I have
a chance to take advantage of a great opportunity
to raise my stock in the pro scouts' eyes."
Scouts from the NBA will be out in force next
week to see the best sophomores, juniors and seniors
all in the same place.
"I think it's safe to bet that nobody will be holding
anything back," Wright said. "And that goes espe
cially for me, since my name is not established
nationally."
Wright has spent the last several weeks working
out with his Cardinal teammates in the afternoon
and then welghtlifting after practice. Both he and
Lichti return to the quiet confines of Maples Pavilion
at about 10 p.m. for an hour of individual shooting.
Although it will be almost impossible for Wright
and Lichti to help each other on the court at the

'I know I can hit from out
there, but I don't know if the
rest of the country does.'
— Todd Lichti

tryouts, they know the moral support is there.
"Our friendship developed a lot at the Pan-Am
Games, and being up against the best players, it
was a , help to be able to criticize each other each
night,' Wright said. "1 think it was an advantage
that some other players who went by themselves
might not have had."
Lichti may have a few more advantages than
Wright. Jirst, his name is at least recognized thanks
to some honorable mention All-America votes. Sec
ond, accuracy from 3-point range helped Brazil upset
the United States at the Pan-Am games, and if
Thompson goes looking for some sharpshooters,
Lichti will be in the picture.
"I'll be looking to score. 1 definitely think he'll
be looking for scorers," Lichti said. "Last year they
said 'We're not looking for scorers,' and when it
cam right down to it they took the guys who cast
the ball up."
Lichti is partaking in a regimen similar to
Wright's. When shooting from the outside he makes
sure he is about a foot behind the NCAA 3-point
line, where the international line would be. And he
doesn't miss many.
" I hat's probably where the NCAA line should be
too,' Montgomery said. "There was a lot of talk at
the NCAA meetings (about changing the 3-point
line), but nothing happened.
"Certainly Todd has that type of range," Mont
gomery added. "The extra foot is not going to affect
him strenght-wise."
If the Olympic coaches looked at a Lichti highlight
film, they would see not only straight-up 3-pointers,
but also some turnaround and fall-away treys. Even
Steve Kerr can't do that.
Hut Lichti will have to do that on the courts in
Colorado Springs, where the air is thin and the
pressure is high.
"1 here's going to be some pressure, but you can't
let that get to you," Lichti said. "I know I can hit
from out there, but I don't know if the rest of the
country does."
