# Confident Birch well-prepared for NCAAs

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
For many freshman athletes,
NCAA Championships are a
nerve-racking and novel experi
ence. Vying for the title under
the critical gaze of the national
media and the probing eyes of
thousands of spectators, collegiate
rookies often find themselves cen
ter stage at a stress festival.
Stanford's Sandra Birch, how
ever, will be spared the trauma.
Though her No. 4 ranking with
senior doubles partner Cari Hagey
will put her right in the thick of
things this weekend, the fresh
man has assumed this role of a
contender many times before.
If last summer is any indica
tion, the Stanford tennis faithful
can sit easy. Birch won the U.S.
Hardcourt Championships dou
bles title in Burlingame and fol
lowed with an inspired runner-up
performance at the U.S. Open
Junior Championships in Flush
ing Meadows, NY, losing only to
the young Soviet phenom Natalia
Zvereva (who hit the top 20 on
the professional tour earlier this
year).
"I think she's going to go down
as one of the best players we've
had at Stanford University, which
is saying a lot for a girl who's
playing No. 4 right now," Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan said.
"She's really something special.
"She has a great all-around
game and shows the ability to
come to the net, which is really
rare, something you don't find too
often in junior players and college
players. It's only found in the best
ones, and she's one of the best."
And one of the mellowest. In a
sport dominated by emotional ex

troverts, Birch remains one of the
calmest and most collected players
to hit the tennis limelight.
"I really feel that an important
part of the game is your mental
attitude and outlook," Birch said.
"I don't know which comes first
— maybe I think calmly so I be
have calmly, but I think behaving
that way reinforces the way I
think.
"I may get very angry inside,
but I can control it, because if I
were angry it would hurt my
game. My idol is Bjorn Borg, so
maybe that's why I try to keep a
calm attitude; I admire that in
him, so I guess I emulate him in
that respect."
The quiet posture masks a
fiercely competitive interior.
Birch is an extremely aggressive
player who, unlike her idol, shows
no reluctance to approach the net
and silence her opponent with her
powerful forehand or her steady
backhand. From just looking at
the soft-spoken five-foot-six na
tive of Huntington Bay, NY, one
can hardly imagine the sheer de
termination hidden within.
"She's a real competitor," Bren
nan replied. "I saw her at the
U.S. Open (Junior Champion
ships), where her feet were bleed
ing and her back was sore. [Yet]
she was playing match after
match. She could have just lay
down and played dead at any
point, but she didn't; she kept
going until there was nothing left.
"I looked at her and I thought,
'Gee, this is an awfully nice kid,
an awfully sweet girl' as I sat in
her living room and petted her
cat, but I had no idea she had
this in her. I was really over
whelmed with her ferociousness
as a competitor. She just would

not let go."
Her style of play mirrors this
tenacity. Competing against ath
letes that tend to reserve ap
proaching the net for only special
occasions or professional careers,
Birch has made aggressive play
the mainstay of her game, her
extra edge.
I think that the future for me
is coming into net, and that's the
game that 1 like to play, so I'm
going to try and develop it,"the
freshman said. "It's a game that
takes longer to develop. I'll have
to be patient, hut hopefully it will
pay off."
Perhaps demanding more pa
tience is her place on the Stanford
squad. Entering college tennis
ranked No. 2 nationally among
juniors last year and No. 23 in
the Volvo/ITCA preseason col
legiate poll, Birch could easily
have played No. 1 singles for al
most every team in the nation.
However, by choosing to the two
time defending NCAA champion
Cardinal, she assured her self at
least a year of playing behind
other star players.
"Everybody who comes to col
lege is a former No. 1 player in
her section, obviously on her high
school team, maybe in the coun
try," Brennan noted. "In Sandra's
case, she was all three, so when
she comes to Stanford and she's
not playing she's obviously a little
disappointed.
"But I think she's taken it in
the right spirit in that she works
hard, and I think she's deter
mined to come back next year and
go for that top spot."
For the freshman, tennis has
been the least of her adjustments
of the past six months. Her
trademark determination spans

the spectrum of her activities, and
juggling the excellence she de
mands in her sport with equally
important academic success has
proved to be a challenge indeed
for the student-athlete who values
both halves of her Stanford life.
"I'm not sure what I am,
whether I'm an athlete-student
or a student-athlete," Birch
conceded. "I'd like to think that
my tennis comes first because I
would like to make that my pro
fession, but I take my studies very
seriously. I want to do well in
both, and I think it's a difficult
balance to find.
"I always put 100 percent into

whatever I do, so I can't blow off
studying. A lot of people blow
things off or don't take it as
seriously, but I can't do that. I
don't know why, but I've never
been able to do that, so I put
everything I can into both," she
said.
"I'm getting used to the col
lege.'' she added. "That was a dif
ficulty for me, adjusting not only
as a tennis player but as a person
and a student. As I adjust a little
more, I'll feel a little more com
fortable with my game."
Perhaps her biggest help has
been older brother Barry, a senior
double majoring in biology and

economics who participates in
tennis as a spectator. Graduating
Phi Beta Kappa next month and
entering Yale Medical School in
the fall, the senior Birch sets and
example that his sister is quick
to follow.
"I'm very close with my family,
and I found it very hard to leave
home, so my brother being here
made it much easier for me," she
said. "He's someone who I can
rely on through thick and thin,
and I think it's been great that
he's been here for me."
If all goes as hoped this week
end in Los Angeles, Barry Birch
will be a proud sibling indeed.
