Cycling
Movin' on up ... but not
quite to the top. The Stanford
cycling team placed second
overall at the Western Col
legiate Cycling Conference
Championships last weekend,
enabling it to rise from third
to second place in the confer
ence's season standings. In a
weekend of racing at UC-Irvine
marred by disorganization, the
Stanford riders put out their
best efforts to pass UC-Santa
Barbara and finish just behind
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo in
the overall standings. These ef
forts secured the Cardinal a
berth in the National Champi
onships at Cal Poly-SLO in two
weeks.
The road race on the first
day of racing turned out to be
unfortunately located on a
truck route. Due to this, the
women's race and two C races
were started but the riders'
placingß were not counted. The
remaining A, B, and C races
were not held and the entire
day was nullified.
The strenuous three-mile
time trial Sunday morning
went off more smoothly. Fresh
man Colt Richardson was the
highest Stanford finisher in the
A race, scoring 10th place.
Graduate student Kaye Wag
ner, alumnus Pam Stevenson,
and post-doctoral student Ami
Laws all scored between ninth
and 15th in the women's race.
In this race against the clock,
senior Dave Louden hammered
to victory in the B field with
a time that was also the third
fastest overall for the day.
Sophomore John Shinn
placed first in the C time trial.
Graduate student Jon Kaplan
also scored points with a 10th
place C finish.
True to its reputation as a
team with a preponderance of
sprinters, the Cardinal raced
well in the criteriums Sunday
afternoon. Richardson
pounded his way to a field
sprint victory in the A race,
giving him fourth place overall,

and posted three prime wins.
Stanford's premier woman
sprinter Stevenson ended her
collegiate season with a trium
phant third place in the criter
ium. Freshman Ellen Austin
scored an amazing 12th place
in her first crit ever.
Louden again proved his
sprinting supremacy by win
ning a convincing first place in
the B criterium. Sophomore
Scott Evans finished up in
seventh after working for
Louden during the race.
Stanford's C cyclists also
scored points for the team.
Kaplan and freshman Greg
Nakamoto each placed 12th in
their respective C races and
Shinn nabbed second in a
prime.
Cricket
The Stanford cricket club
suffered defeats at the hands
of Fresno and Marin last week
end to slump to 2-2 for the
season.
In the match at Fresno,
played on terrain which
favored the Fresno team, Stan
ford batted first. Only a fight
ing 65 not out by Stanford's
middle order batsman Peter
Perera helped Stanford reach
152 for 7 wickets after its al
lotted 45 overs.
The Fresno players began
their innings well, but Stanford
grabbed 3 wickets for only 24
runs and looked like it had a
chance. Fresno, however, re
lentlessly battled on, aided by
some missed catches, to easily
reach Stanford's score after
only 32.3 overs.
The Mann game, played in
Larkspur, also resulted in a
loss for the Cardinal. The
Marin team won the toss and
batted first, finishing with the
huge score of 260 runs after
its 45 overs,
Stanford started its innings
quickly, but after losing some
quick wickets it became appar
ent that matching Marin's
score would be impossible.
