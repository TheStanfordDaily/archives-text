# The
						tough decision to turn pro
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
To turn pro, or not to turn pro: That's the ques
tion that burns in the mind of many an amateur
men's tennis player.
For the talented few, playing professionally is
never in doubt. But when to take the plunge —
bypassing a college education and NCAA eligibility
— can be the most momentous decision, for better
or for worse, in a youth's lifp
Many spurn college altogether. Most top European
players, such as Sweden's Mats Wilander and Stefan
Edberg, never consider attending college, go on to
successful results, and never look back.
Recently, many U.S. players have followed suit.
U.S. Open semifinalist Jimmy Arias and U.S. Open
quarterfinahst Aaron Krickstein both had substan
tial initial successes, but have slipped dramatically.
18-year-old Andre Agassi and 16-year-old Michael
Chang have also recently lept out onto the pro tour
as teenagers.
Still other tennis greats attended college for year
or two before they joined the pro ranks.
Stanford's John McEnroe and UCLA's Jimmy
Connors left after one year; Stanford's Tim Mayotte,
Roscoe Tanner and Scott Davis after three.
These are the names most have heard of. But
what of the player that leaves college early and
flounders on the tour? A hasty decision to grab the
benefits of a pro career could prove to haunt some
players.
USC's Luke Jensen, the No. 2 junior in the world
in 1985, had wins over West Germany's Boris Becker
as a junior. Jensen, No. 2 on the Trojan team, was
rated as high as the nation's No. 5 college plaver
at the end of last season and turned pro after his
sophomore year.
Since last May, he has scraped into the top 200,
but has not vet attained the success his junior
ranking promised.
"Luke turning pro was a horrible mistake. He's
struggling and will probably realize that he isn't
good enough to play professional tennis," USC
Coach Dick Leach said. "Then he'll realize he didn't
get a college education. He may end up teaching
terms in a country club to a bunch of old ladies."
With the allure of the pro circuit, agent contracts,
endorsements, exhibitions and tournament prize
money, it's no wonder tennis players itch to get
into the big time.
In 1986, the No. 50 professional player earned
$108,000 in prize money alone. Endorsements and
exhibitions up the ante even more.
"In today's market, with today's prize money, if
I had a (college) player ranked professionally around
100, I'd say he really ought to think about turning
pro," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "If he were
ranked No. 50, 1 think he should definitely turn
pro."
