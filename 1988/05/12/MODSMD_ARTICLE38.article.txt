# The 						tough decision to turn pro
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
To turn pro, or not to turn pro: That's the ques
tion that burns in the mind of many an amateur
men's tennis player.
For the talented few, playing professionally is
never in doubt. But when to take the plunge —
bypassing a college education and NCAA eligibility
— can be the most momentous decision, for better
or for worse, in a youth's lifp
Many spurn college altogether. Most top European
players, such as Sweden's Mats Wilander and Stefan
Edberg, never consider attending college, go on to
successful results, and never look back.
Recently, many U.S. players have followed suit.
U.S. Open semifinalist Jimmy Arias and U.S. Open
quarterfinahst Aaron Krickstein both had substan
tial initial successes, but have slipped dramatically.
18-year-old Andre Agassi and 16-year-old Michael
Chang have also recently lept out onto the pro tour
as teenagers.
Still other tennis greats attended college for year
or two before they joined the pro ranks.
Stanford's John McEnroe and UCLA's Jimmy
Connors left after one year; Stanford's Tim Mayotte,
Roscoe Tanner and Scott Davis after three.
These are the names most have heard of. But
what of the player that leaves college early and
flounders on the tour? A hasty decision to grab the
benefits of a pro career could prove to haunt some
players.
USC's Luke Jensen, the No. 2 junior in the world
in 1985, had wins over West Germany's Boris Becker
as a junior. Jensen, No. 2 on the Trojan team, was
rated as high as the nation's No. 5 college plaver
at the end of last season and turned pro after his
sophomore year.
Since last May, he has scraped into the top 200,
but has not vet attained the success his junior
ranking promised.
"Luke turning pro was a horrible mistake. He's
struggling and will probably realize that he isn't
good enough to play professional tennis," USC
Coach Dick Leach said. "Then he'll realize he didn't
get a college education. He may end up teaching
terms in a country club to a bunch of old ladies."
With the allure of the pro circuit, agent contracts,
endorsements, exhibitions and tournament prize
money, it's no wonder tennis players itch to get
into the big time.
In 1986, the No. 50 professional player earned
$108,000 in prize money alone. Endorsements and
exhibitions up the ante even more.
"In today's market, with today's prize money, if
I had a (college) player ranked professionally around
100, I'd say he really ought to think about turning
pro," Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "If he were
ranked No. 50, 1 think he should definitely turn
pro."
Freshman David Wheaton, the No. 1 U.S. junior
and No. 2 junior in the world behind Australia's

Freshman David Wheaton Is one of a few collegiate players faced with the choice
between staying In college or turning pro early to (hopefully) earn a good living.
Jason Stoltenberg, wrestles with
when he should forego his future
years at Stanford and head into
the pro circuit.
Wheaton, the U.S. Open Junior
Champion, opted for at least one
year of college despite phenome
nal results on the junior circuit.
After an injury-riddled year un
der Gould, Wheaton, rated fourth
in the nation, has improved his
serve-and-volley game and figures
to put it all together in the NCAA
Championships next week. But
turning pro hasn't strayed far
from his mind.
"For many people, if you don't

push yourself, you could get in a
rut and college could be a detri
ment to your game if you stay
too long," Wheaton said. "For me,
going to college for four years
might hurt me. For others it may
help."
"It's good to turn pro when
you're on a high. I'll see how I
do this summer, but if I do well,
it will be hard to come back in
the fall," he added. "If I won the
NCAAs, the chances of me coming
back next year would be slim."
Though few top-notch players
like McEnroe and Connors played
college tennis for four years and
graduated, several players im
prove steadily in college and have
enjoyed solid success on the tour.
Pepperdine's Brad Gilbert and
Georgia's Mikael Pernfors are two

high-quality pros that attended
junior college for two years and
college for two. Recent Stanford
grads Dan Goldie, currently
ranked No. 37 professionally, and
Jim Grabh have also played with
good professional results after
four years of college tennis.
"Most of the players that turn
pro early aren't too serious about
school," senior Patrick McEnroe
said. "They get tired of hanging
around. They get antsy and ask
why am I wasting my time in
college."
"But in college, there's a chance
for players to develop their game
without the constant pressure of
worrying about where their next
paycheck is coming from. That's
something that is often over
looked."
