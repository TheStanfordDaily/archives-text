Pablo Morales and Jeff Kostoff are simply
irreplaceable in the world of collegiate swim
ming, but Stanford men's swimming Coach
Skip Kenney came close with this year's
recruiting class.
The nine new team members bring in
enough talent to help ease the gaps left, by
the graduations of Morales. Kostoff, Sean
Murphy, Anthony Mosse and Matt Nance over
the past two years.
"This class has the opportunity to be the
best class we've ever had here," Kenney said
"1 can't imagine another class with more in
dividual wins than Jeff and Pablo, but the
quality and depth we have coming in has the
chance to score more points (at NCAA's) than

Headed by Jeff Rouse, Alex Kostich, Jason

corps and will also compote in the 400 indi
vidual medley. Not only did he win a gold
medal and set a meet record in the 1,500-
meter free at the 1987 Pan American Games,
but his high school 1,650-free time would
have taken fourth at this year's NCAA's and
his 400 1M best would have placed in the
consolation finals. Kostich is already "looking
forward to the hard work and helping the

One member of the class already has his
flight tickets to Seoul. Plummer, a native of
