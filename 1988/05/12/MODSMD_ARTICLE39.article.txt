# Men's swimming lands some big fish

Pablo Morales and Jeff Kostoff are simply
irreplaceable in the world of collegiate swim
ming, but Stanford men's swimming Coach
Skip Kenney came close with this year's
recruiting class.
The nine new team members bring in
enough talent to help ease the gaps left, by
the graduations of Morales. Kostoff, Sean
Murphy, Anthony Mosse and Matt Nance over
the past two years.
"This class has the opportunity to be the
best class we've ever had here," Kenney said
"1 can't imagine another class with more in
dividual wins than Jeff and Pablo, but the
quality and depth we have coming in has the
chance to score more points (at NCAA's) than
any single class we've had at Stanford "

Headed by Jeff Rouse, Alex Kostich, Jason
Plummer and Andy Lloyd, the recruits swim
every NCAA event These four, if not more,
should make their presence felt during their
freshmen seasons.
"Alex, Jason, Jeff and Andy ought to be
able to come real close to covering the points
we're losing from Sean and Anthony's grad
uation," Stanford Asst. Coach Ted Knapp said
A native of Fredericksburg, Va., House
brings backstroking and sprint freestyle depth
to the Cardinal ranks. Twice named Virginia
Male Swimmer of the Year, his current bests
would have given him two fourth places in
the national meet this year — in the 100-vard
back and 200 back A 1988 Olympic trials
qualifier, the backstroker has a shot at making
the U.S. squad for the Games according to
Kenney.
Fellow trials qualifier Kostich, a member

of the (iator Swim Club of Cambridge, Mass.,
will fill a gap in Stanford's distance-freestyle
corps and will also compote in the 400 indi
vidual medley. Not only did he win a gold
medal and set a meet record in the 1,500-
meter free at the 1987 Pan American Games,
but his high school 1,650-free time would
have taken fourth at this year's NCAA's and
his 400 1M best would have placed in the
consolation finals. Kostich is already "looking
forward to the hard work and helping the
team regain the national crown "
One member of the class already has his
flight tickets to Seoul. Plummer, a native of
Hrisbane, Australia, has already qualified for
the Australian Olympic contingent in his
specialties — distance freestyle events — and
according to Kenney has a legitimate shot at
a gold in the 1,500 free.
Plummer's list of international
accomplishments already includes
a gold medal in the 400-meter
free at the Commonwealth Games
and a bronze in the same event
at the 1987 Pan Pacific Champi
onships, and he is Australian na
tional champion in both the 400
and 1,500.
Lloyd brings talent in a variety

of events. The Mercer, Wash., na
tive is nationally ranked in IM,
back and free events. The Aca
demic All-America swimmer is
ranked first among all high school
competitors in the 200 IM, and
also brings All-America experi
ence in the 100 back and 500 free
to the Cardinal.
"You just can't beat interna
tional experience," Kenney said.
"It would add so much to this
class if we had three Olympians
and really help bridge the gap."
Two other signees should make

an impact in their inauguaral
season on the Farm. Backstroker
and IM specialist Josh Mikesill,
of Crawfordsville, Ind., is a High
School All-America. Kevin Hen
derson, a freestyle, butterfly and
IM swimmer from El Paso, Tex.,
has qualified for the Olympic Tri
als in the 200 IM. Joining them
will be backstroker and butterflier
David Johnson, a club teammate
of Kostich, sprint freestyler John
Degroot of Galveston, Tex., and
Jeff Deßuiter from Castro Valley,
Calif., a breaststroker and IM
swimmer.
