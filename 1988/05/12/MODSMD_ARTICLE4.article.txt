# Kennedy to encourage signing of Senior Pledge
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
Adding his support to a campus
movement that has been greeted
skeptically by some students, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
will ask graduating seniors to sign
a pledge at Commencement to in
vestigate the "environmental and
social consequences" of any job
they might consider.
Kennedy said Tuesday he
thought the pledge was "an ex
cellent idea" and he plans to en
courage seniors to sign it in his
Commencement address.
"I don't intend to put anybody
in a position that they feel forced

to sign the pledge, but I will ask
them to give it thoughtful atten
tion," he said.
1 he pledge, which was affirmed
bv 65 percent of voters in last
month's ASSU electi on, was
placed on the ballot by members
of the Graduate Pledge Alliance,
an umbrella organization of 19
different student groups that sup
port the pledge.
The pledge's goal is to help open
discussion of social and environ
mental responsibility and to im
prove the chances that these is r
sues will be considered in career
decisions, according to Diane
Honigberg, chair of the GPA.
Honigberg said Stanford

seniors will join others at seven
California universities who have
already decided to include the
pledge in their graduation cere
monies — including UC-Berkeley,
UC-Santa Cruz and Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo. Sacramento State
and San Francisco State are
strongly considering the proposal,
she said.
" The pledge is becoming a na
tional phenomenon," Honigberg
said. Several schools outside the
state are working on adopting the
pledge, .she said.
On campus, however, some are
unsupportive by the idea. Ken
Rivera, former president of the
Stanford College Republicans,

said that although the issue of
whether to back the pledge was
never brought before his organi
zation and that they did not of
ficially oppose the pledge, he per
sonally finds the pledge "irrele
vant. It will have "little impact,"
he predicted.
"1 personally felt the basis on
which the proposal was built was
highly questionable," Rivera said.
"1 think it has profoundly liberal
roots."
Honigberg acknowledged there
is a "silent minority" that opposes
the pledge, although she said the
GPA has not met any organized
opposition on campus. Thirty-five
percent of the student bod'v op

posed the pledge in the recent
ASSU election.
The pledge will be voluntary
and personal, Honigberg said.
Students will simply sign a card
and keep it.
"1 hope the pledge will encour
age people to think about ethical
considerations in their job, not
just financial ones," she said. "I
personally don't believe that
people are as concerned about
money as people think they are."
Honigberg said that the details
for the distribution of the pledge
cards was finalized at a meeting
yesterday. Students will pass out
cards to seniors lined up in the
processional as thev enter the sta

diura.
The pledge was first imple
mented at Humboldt State Uni
versity last year.
Stanford alumnus Matt
Nicodemus, a leader of the Na
tional Graduation Pledge Alliance
and a professor in the political
science department at Humboldt
State, said that over 700 hundred
of the 893 students who walked
across the stage at Humboldt
States graduation picked up
pledge cards, but he said there
was no way of knowing exactly
how many signed the pledge.
"The idea that the pledge is
based on has been around as long
as humanity.
