# A 						new way to catch some rays
## Professor is perfecting the world's most efficient solar cell 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Science editor 
For thousands of years, humans
have tried to trap and tap the
sun's energy. In 200 8.C., the
Greek mathematician Archimedes
is believed to have used polished
shields to concentrate and reflect
sunlight to burn Roman ships.
In 1988, University engineers
are perfecting a tiny silicon chip
that collects concentrated sun
light and makes, not fire, but elec
tricity.
This silicon chip, or solar cell,
developed by Assoc Electrical En
gineering Prof. Richard Swanson,
converts sunlight into electricity
more efficiently than any other
in the world.

The neat thing is
that. . . you put
photons in and get
electrons out.
Nothing has to
spin or turn.'
— Richard Crane

Whereas Archimedes' shield

'"K '*■> the lens mounted wit!
Swanson's chip concentrates sun
light by refracting or bending it

according to Richard Crane, re
search and development engineer
in Swanson's lab
On a clear day, the sun delivers
light energy to the earth at a rate
of 100 watts per square foot,
which is too diffuse to be har
nessed effectively, Crane said.
Like a magnifying glass burning
a hole through paper, Swanson's
cell efficiently uses the sun's en
ergy because a 7-by-7 inch lens
concentrates sunlight 500 times
its original intensity.
Commercially available cells,
which do not use concentrated
sunlight, convert between 10 and
12 percent of incoming sunlight
to electricity. These solar, or
photovoltaic, cells are too ineffi
cient to be practical for large-scale
use.
By contrast, Swanson's cells
currently show efficiencies of
greater than 28 percent. By the
19905, these cells may be able to
generate the megawatts of power
needed by public utilities at very
low cost, according to a journal
of the Electric Power Research
Institute of Palo Alto.

Four utility companies, includ
ing Pacific Gas and Electric, have
provided funds for researching
and manufacturing Swanson's
chip.
None of the thousands of non
concentrating photovoltaic cells in
use today produce power at a cost
that competes with fossil fuels,
according to the EPRI Journal.
Electricity now costs about 10
or 11 cents per kilowatt hour for
a homes near a utility hook-up,
according to Gilbert Masters, pro
fessor of civil engineering. The
target cost for electricity using
solar concentrator cells is 6 to 8
cents per kilowatt hour.
Using efficient solar cells will
not only allow utilities to lower
electricity costs, but also decrease
emissions from fossil fuel-based
power generation.
Photovoltaics are not the only
way to make electricity from sun
light. Other methods include

solar-powered windmills — wind
results from the heating of air
and so it is ultimately produced
by the sun — hnd thermal solar
power.
In thermal solar power, the sun
heats water and the resulting
steam runs a turhine. The tur
bine's generator converts me
chanical motions into electricity.
"The neat thing about photo
voltaics is that there are no mov
ing parts; you put photons in and
get electrons out. Nothing has to
spin or turn," Crane said. "It's
silent power."
Twelve years ago, Swanson
began to pursue his idea for a
new kind of photovoltaic cell.
To develop the solar cell, Swan
son and his research team created
a computer program to model the
operation of the new cell. Telling
the computer certain known fea

tures of the cell design, the re
searchers asked the model to
predict the cell's performance.
As it turned out, the model
"predicted things that went
against the grain of traditional
knowledge" of how to build solar
cells. Crane said.
"It took a lot of faith to take
these ideas and keep financing
them over the years," Crane said,
but the project turned out to be
"a real block-buster."
The actual cell Swanson is cur
rently working on was born in
1980, the year the Stanford solar
project changed its focus from a
slightly different technology to
the pure photovoltaic cell, a single
crystal silicon cell, according to
the EPRI Journal.
The only group outside of Stan
ford with a high-quality single
crystal silicon cell is at the Uni

versity of New South Wales in
Australia.
Sandia National Laboratories
and Palo Alto-based Varian As
sociates have both achieved a 25
to 26 percent efficiency with
galium-arsenide concentrator
cells, according to the EPRI Jour
nal. Vanan's cell held the effi
ciency record before the Stanford
cell was developed.
EPRI, which now funds the
Stanford research, recently hired
Acrian Inc., a San Jose semicon
ductor firm, to develop a way to
manufacture the cell.
Over $10 million has been in
vested to develop the cell and an
estimated additional $15 to $20
million will be required before the
cell is manufactured and used by
utility companies, the EPRI Jour
nal said.
The cells are hard to manufac

ture because they are very thin
and the material has to be ex
tremely pure, according to Crane.
However, Swanson said his cells
were "designed from the start to
be manufactured with standard
integrated-circuit processing tech
niques," and that mass-producing
the device is "a given."
In utility plants, solar cells are
physically and electrically con
nected to each other in the form
of modules, the power producing
units. For the concentrator cell,
60 24-cell modules will then be
combined into an "array." Each
cell produces about six watts of
electricity.
An array using non-concen
trator cells costs between $7.50
and $8 per watt to install; for a
concentrator cell, the cost would
be about $3 per watt, Crane said.
Although concentrator cells are
more expensive to make, they
reduce the cost of electricity for
two reasons. First, their high ef
ficiency means they can produce
much more power per cell than
traditional cells.
Second, because they use con
centrated sunlight, the cells use
less silicon and land area than do
traditional solar cells.
Because "sunlight is free," a
big part of the total cost of produc
ing electricity is the cost of the
silicon to make the cells. Reducing
that cost is crucial to lowering
the price of electricity.
It is always cheaper to run the
sunlight through a lens to con
centrate the light than it is to
convert it to electricity, Crane ex
plained.
Currently, solar power is only
economically practical in remote
locations, far from the nearest
utility. Such applications include
lighting a buoy on an ocean or
signs on remote sections of high
way.
With today's solar technology,
'you have to think about where
you want to use electricity. If
PG&E is in your backyard, you
might as well buy from PG&E,"
Masters said.
But if Pacific Gas & Electric is
not in the neighborhood and only
a small amount of electricitv is

needed, a utility hook-up or AC
power generator will cost about
twice as much as would solar
electric power, which costs about
25 cents per kilowatt hour,
Masters said.
The electricity in Crane's home
is generated by the sun. Because
of the location of his home, the
$100,000 cost of extending the
utility line outweighed the higher
cost per watt of solar power The
solar cells on Crane's house
charge a large battery which
produces enough electrical cur
rent for his house.
For developing countries with
out central utilities, solar power
is the most economically efficient
source of electricity, Masters said.
Today's two other main electric
power resources are fossil fuels
and nuclear energy. The main fos
sil fuels are natural gas, coal and
oil.
There are many areas of solar
energy research in addition to
those geared toward electricity
production, according to Masters.
Some solar researchers study how
to use plants, which convert sun
light into biomass via photosyn
thesis, to make alcohol fuel for
cars.
Only 1 percent of the solar en
ergy available to plants is cap
tured by plant tissue. Of that 1
percent, only about one-tenth to
one-half is available for consump
tion by herbivores or alcohol fuel
production. The remainder is used
for the plant's own respiration.
Other research is being done to
find ways to use solar energy to
provide some part of the heat for
houses. This includes architec
tural design to increase a build
ing's ability to absorb heat from
the sun. One Colorado home is
heated entirely by the sun despite
its exposure to very cold weather
and snow in the winter, according
to Masters.
Stanford has a few solar water
heating systems, but doesn't use
solar energy to a large extent,
Masters said.
