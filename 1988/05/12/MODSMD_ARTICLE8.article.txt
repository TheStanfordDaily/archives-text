						new way to catch some rays
## Professor is perfecting the world's most efficient solar cell 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Science editor 
For thousands of years, humans
have tried to trap and tap the
sun's energy. In 200 8.C., the
Greek mathematician Archimedes
is believed to have used polished
shields to concentrate and reflect
sunlight to burn Roman ships.
In 1988, University engineers
are perfecting a tiny silicon chip
that collects concentrated sun
light and makes, not fire, but elec
tricity.
This silicon chip, or solar cell,
developed by Assoc Electrical En
gineering Prof. Richard Swanson,
converts sunlight into electricity
more efficiently than any other
in the world.

The neat thing is
that. . . you put
photons in and get
electrons out.
Nothing has to
spin or turn.'

Whereas Archimedes' shield

Swanson's chip concentrates sun

On a clear day, the sun delivers
light energy to the earth at a rate
of 100 watts per square foot,
which is too diffuse to be har
nessed effectively, Crane said.
Like a magnifying glass burning
a hole through paper, Swanson's
cell efficiently uses the sun's en
ergy because a 7-by-7 inch lens
concentrates sunlight 500 times
its original intensity.
Commercially available cells,
which do not use concentrated
sunlight, convert between 10 and
12 percent of incoming sunlight
to electricity. These solar, or
