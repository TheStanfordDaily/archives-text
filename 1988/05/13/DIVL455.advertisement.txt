(Not at the Duquette Pavillion)
Complications in obtaining insurance for the Duquette Pavillion
prevent us from holding our Formal there.
Instead, we will have the Formal in the Grand Ballroom of the Westin
St. Francis Hotel, 335 Powell Street, on Union Square. The date is stili
Thursday, May 19th, 9 P.M. —IA.M. The band is still Pride and Joy.
We will also have a DJ in an adjoining ballroom.
Your ticket also comes with Class of 1988 glasses, a complimentary
drink per person, and substantial discounts on suites at the hotel. To
make suite reservations, call 397-7000 and mention Stanford to get
your discount. A limited number of tickets for the Formal are still
available at Tresidder Ticket Office —$50 per couple.
