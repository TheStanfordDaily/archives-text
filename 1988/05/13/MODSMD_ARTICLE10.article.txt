# Dancers to wow powwow crowd

### J. Eric Jones 
Only hours after a medicine man of the Native
American community blesses the Stanford soccer
fields today, the 17th Annual Stanford Powwow
will begin.
Over 8,000 Native Americans representing tribes
from across the United States and Canada will join
an estimated 7,000 visitors for a "social and spiritual
gathering" for the three-day powwow.
The cultural event, organized each year by the
Stanford American Indian Organization, will feature
everything from traditional singing and dancing con
tests to tribal arts and crafts booths next to Stanford
Stadium.
The acknowledged highlight of the powwow, how
ever, will be the dancing performances that are
scheduled — almost hourly — throughout the week
end.
Displaying a variety of dance styles characteristic
of different Native American tribes, the perform
ances will all be part of over 10 categories of contests
ranging from the Men's Grass Dance to the Women's
Fancy Shawl,
Two different drum groups, representing both
northern and southern tribal regions, will have the
task of accompanying each dance performance all
weekend long.
Although the Stanford Powwow has never had a
theme in past years, organizers decided to break
tradition by choosing "Indian Sobriety" as this
year's theme.
According to senior Bill McCabe, "It's our way
of saying 'something needs to be done' " about
alcoholism, which has long been a problem among
Native Americans.
Because traditional Native American social events
have never tolerated the use of alcohol or other
mind-altering drugs, McCabe said organizers decided
to ban all alcoholic beverages from the powwow
this weekend.
Only one meeting of an Alcoholics Anonymous
group will actually deal with the issue of sobriety
directly, said McCabe, who is a Navajo and a member
of the Powwow Committee.

This year, organizers said they hoped more people
from the Stanford community would attend. "People
generally have a misconception about the event and
they're afraid to come," said committee member
and senior Ix?slie Jackson, a Crow Indian.
Woodward stressed that the powwow is open to
all. "It's not an Indian-only event," she said "Every
one is welcome."
