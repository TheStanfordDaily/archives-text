A freshman in Twain who
seriously injured his back late
Wednesday night was reported
to be in stable condition last
night at Kaiser Permanente
Hospital in Redwood City.
Steve Kawamoto is expected
to undergo surgery early next
week for a small fracture in
one of his spinal vertebra. He
should be out of the hospital
and in rehabilitation after two
weeks with full use of his arms
and legs, according to senior
Stan Scoggins, a resident as
sistant in Twain.
Kawamoto injured himself
Wednesday at approximately
10 p.m. while rehearsing for
the Twain spring play, "The
Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas." Just before a house
meeting, the freshman slipped

while doing a handstand, hurt
his neck and lay immobile until
Scoggins reached him and
called Cowell Health Center
and the Stanford Hospital.
Kawamoto, whose parents
live nearby in San Carlos, was
fully conscious while being
transported to Stanford Hospi
tal, where he underwent test
ing that revealed the fractured
vertebra, known as a teardrop
flexion. He remained overnight
in the hospital, accompanied by
his parents and concerned stu
dents from Twain.
Yesterday afternoon, he was
moved to Kaiser, where he is
now in intensive care. Nurses
there report that he is alert
and oriented. Friends who have
visited him say he is in good
spirits and retains full feeling
in all of his limbs.
Kawamoto plans to return to
school in the fall, Scoggins said.
