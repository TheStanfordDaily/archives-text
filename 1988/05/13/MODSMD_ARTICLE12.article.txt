# Marguerite to eliminate on-campus routes
## 
### Deborah Palmer 
The University plans a
overhaul of the Marguerite bus
service's routes, cutting back the
buses' campus circuits but ex
tending a line to California Ave
nue.
Changes will go into effect in
December, according to Dennis
Perkinson, director of the Office
of Transportation Programs.
The Marguerite's current blue
and purple lines, which circle
campus daily from 7:20 a.m. to
6:40 p.m., will be discontinued ex
cept for during noon hours. In
their place, a new line will be
created that will run from the
California Avenue train station,
along Serra Street, to the Stan
ford Shopping Center. This new

line will run during peak com
muter hours in the morning and
afternoon.
The current noontime routes to
downtown Palo Alto and SLAC
will remain unaffected.
Some Marguerite users have ex
pressed dismay at the proposed
changes.
"It's great that they're going to
California Avenue," said one grad
uate student who uses the Mar
guerite frequently. "But not if it
means they have to cut down on
their service around campus."
Perkinson said the route
changes are aimed at efficiency
and convenience, both for Mar
guerite users and operators. With
the growth of the inner campus,
the demand for service skirting
campus borders is dwindling

while the number of commuters
from off campus is on the rise.
The service to the California
Avenue station caters to the
growing number of public trans
port users, reaching five addi
tional bus lines and meeting
trains more conveniently. This
"should ease campus traffic con
gestion and parking problems on
campus," Perkinson said.
Also, the changes are expected
to save up to $200,000 annually
in the operations of the Margue
rite. Although Perkins said the
motivation for the alterations is
"not primarily cost cutting," the
expense of the Marguerite system
has been criticized recently. The
new system will save money be
cause fewer vehicles will be
needed when the route is restruc
tured.

According to Perkinson, a route
that will include California Ave
nue is "something we've had re
quests for, for as long as I've been
here." Although initially the Mar
guerite could lose as much as 25
percent of its estimated 1,600
riders, Perkins said he believes
the change will better serve the
community.
However, he said he regrets dis
appointing present mid-morning
or mid-afternoon riders of the
purple and blue lines. If great
need for a line to a specific place
not covered should arise, he said,
"we have the option of adding a
separate line, as we did with
SLAC."
Perkinson also noted that his
office wants to receive community
input about the proposed changes.
