Reagan reaffirms endorsement
WASHINGTON — President Reagan,
asserting that he was taken aback by news
reports that said his endorsement of George
Bush was lukewarm, took the unusual step
yesterday of issuing a written statement saying
that he was "enthusiastic, fully committed and
. . . will go all out to make Vice President
Bush the next president of the United States."
The brevity of Reagan's remarks endorsing
Bush at a Republican fund-raising gala Wed
nesday evening was defended by the White
House, which said Reagan wrote the words
himself and that they had been approved by
the vice president.
"You can say it was brief, but it wasn't
lukewarm," one senior White House official
said.
White House press representative Marlin
Fitzwater said Reagan was "mortified" by
press accounts saying that his gesture of sup
port was less enthusiastic than expected.
And Bush rejected the notion that he had
any reason to be disappointed. At a stop in
Albuquerque, N.M., en route to campaign ap
pearances in San Diego, he told reporters: "I
thought it was just great."
FCC proposes AT&T rate cap
The Federal Communications Commission
disclosed the details of a telephone regulatory
proposal yesterday that it said could save long
distance customers $1.6 billion over four years.
Under the plan, the FCC would be able to
place caps on what American Telephone &
Telegraph can charge long-distance customers.
In return, the agency would lift the current
limits on how much AT&T can earn from the
business.
The FCC said its proposal, which was ap
proved in concept in August and which will
come up for final approval in August at the
earliest, is "designed to reduce telephone costs
and spur innovation."
It would let AT&T choose whether to adopt
the new regulatory system or stick with tradi
tional, so-called rate-of-return regulation,
which it has strongly criticized as unnecessary
in an increasingly competitive business. The
new plan would begin next April 1 and be
reviewed after three years.
MIT discovers new genetic code
Molecular biologists at Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology have discovered the nature
of a second genetic code and how it functions
in all living cells alongside the well-known
first genetic code, which was deciphered in
the 19605.
Scientists had known for decades that a
second such code must exist, but none could
determine how it worked. The MIT discovery
reveals the nature of the code's language but
has not deciphered it fully.
One prominent expert, Nobel laureate Chris
tian de Duve, hailed the findings as highly
significant and said the second code, simpler
than the first, may have been its evolutionary
predecessor. If further study confirms this
speculation, the discovery could lead to im
portant new insights about how life began.
"We're very excited about it," said Paul
Schimmel, an MIT biology professor who found
the second code and published his report, along
with Ya-Ming Hou, a doctoral student in his
lab, in yesterday's issue of the British scientific
journal Nature.
