# INF treaty verification differences resolved

### 
GENEVA — With the United States
apparently winning most of the points,
American and Soviet negotiators yes
terday completed two documents here
that resolved all of their outstanding
differences on implementing the
medium-range missile agreement.

Secretary of State
George Shultz said
that the outcome,
achieved at the end of
two days of talks, was
"absolutely satisfac
tory" to the Reagan
administration. He
saw no reason, he
added, why the Senate
should continue to

hold up ratification proceedings on the
treaty now.
The documents were being carried
back to Washington last night by na
tional security adviser Colin Powell to
present and explain to senators today,
Shultz said.
The announcement that Shultz and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shev
ardnadze had come to an agreement

on the nine disputed items in the
treaty's verification section touched off
a flurry of debate on the Senate floor,
where pressure is mounting to com
plete the ratification debate before the
summit between President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev

that is set to begin
May 29.
Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.1., chairman of
the Foreign Relations
Committee, said that
Shultz would testify
before the panel Mon
day afternoon and
that Senate floor
debate on ratification

could resume Tuesday.
While Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., reiterated his
determination to keep the debate
removed from the summit schedule,
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, called for
the Senate to work into the night and
on weekends if necessary to complete
action before Reagan goes to Moscow.
"The opportunity for an American

The opportunity for an American president to
present before the Soviet people this significant
and historic agreement is one that should not be
missed, if there is any way possible for the Senate
to complete its business.'

president to present before the Soviet
people this significant and historic
agreement is one that should not be
missed, if there is any way possible
for the Senate to complete its busi
ness," Stevens said.
At the White House, press represen
tative Marlin Fitzwater reported that
"progress has been made" but gave
no details. Fitzwater said that as a
result of the progress reported in
Geneva, "we will try to get ratification
before going to the summit."
Neither Shultz nor his senior staff
would claim victory on virtually all of

the disputed issues, which involve So
viet attempts to restrict U.S. on-site
inspectors more than was allowed in
the treaty. But a senior Pentagon of
ficial said that "all outcomes were con
sistent with our original understand
ing of the treaty text."
In view of the result, which had
been widely expected, some U.S. offi
cials expressed puzzlement that Soviet
military officers who are charged with
implementing the treaty had raised
the largely technical issues in the first
place.
