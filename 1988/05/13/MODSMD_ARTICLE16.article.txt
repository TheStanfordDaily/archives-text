# Pentagon joins drug war
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Secretary
of Defense Frank Carlucci and
Senate leaders were nearing
agreement last night on a plan
to give the Pentagon a greater
role in the war against illegal
drugs coming over the South
ern border of the United States
from Latin America.
The talks were expected to
yield a bipartisan compromise
that is likely to be approved by
the Senate today as part of a
$299.5 billion defense spending
bill for fiscal 1989.
The Pentagon, which has
fiercely resisted pressure to get
involved in the interdiction of
drugs until now, was forced to
consider a compromise when it
became clear earlier this week
that the Senate was on the
verge of approving one of two
such proposals, both of them
flawed from the viewpoint of
the military.
Nevertheless, Carlucci was
said to be a highly reluctant
participant in negotiations
with the senators. "They are
not doing cartwheels over there

(at the Pentagon)," Sen. Al
fonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said.
Using the military to inter
dict drugs has become a pop
ular election-year issue in the
Congress. Yesterday, Senate
Armed Service Committee
Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
who once opposed a greater
role for the military, said the
Pentagon must become in
volved because drug trafficking
is a form of "chemical warfare."
According to Senate mem
bers, the final compromise
amendment will state that the
Department of Defense must
take a greater role in surveil
lance of drug traffickers who
cross U.S. borders.
Still unresolved last night,
however, was the controversial
issue of whether the armed
forces should be empowered to
arrest or detain suspected drug
traffickers who are halted on
the high seas outside U.S. bor
ders as a result of military sur
veillance.
