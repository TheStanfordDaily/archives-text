# White House calls Noriega deal a good 'plea bargain'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The White House,
insisting that it must consider all available
means to bring about the resignation of
Panamanian General Manuel Noriega, yes
terday defended its consideration of a deal
that could involve dropping drug indict
ments pending against Noriega in Florida.
"What this amounts to is a plea bargain,"
White House press representative Marlin
Fitzwater said. He declined to detail
specifics of the negotiations with Noriega
and asserted that no agreement had been
reached.
If a deal on the charges could be worked
out, it "would be the most fruitful and
productive plea bargain that we have seen
in a long time," White House Chief of Staff
Howard Baker Jr. said.
The White House and State Department
sought to keep a snug mantle of secrecy
over the long-running efforts to remove
Noriega from power. Officials expressed
concern that premature disclosure of
details of the negotiations being conducted
with the Panamanian general could derail
the shadowy talks.
But according to administration officials,
one proposal under negotiation included
the possibility that Noriega would face no

criminal prosecution if he went into exile.
"If Noriega were to offer to leave
(Panama) in exchange for some action on
our part, that action could include dropping
the charges," one administration official
said. "But that may be the outer limits of
what we're proposing, and it's incorrect to
say the president has signed off on it.
There's nothing final until it comes back
and is presented to the president."
The prospect that the drug charges might
be dismissed brought angry reactions from
Democrats and Republicans in Congress,
who said that a concession would undercut
U.S. efforts to combat drug trafficking.
It also prompted the U.S. attorney in
Miami, who has spearheaded the investi
gation into Noriega's alleged involvement
in drug smuggling, to fly to Washington
to meet with Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111.
U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner, who has
resigned effective next month, said in a
statement issued by his office after his 10-
to 15-minute session with Meese that he
still wants to proceed with the Noriega
prosecution.
