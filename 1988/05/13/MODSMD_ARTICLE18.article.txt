# Afghan resistance may attack retreating Soviets

### 
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - The Af
ghan resistance, determined to punish
Soviet troops for nearly a decade-long
occupation of their homeland, yester
day served notice in the bluntest pos
sible way that the Red Army will have
to fight its way home during the total
troop withdrawal Moscow has prom
ised starting Sunday.
According to diplomatic reports,
anti-communist moujahedeen (holy
warriors) armed with U.S.-provided
Stinger missiles downed a Red Army
helicopter during the day. The Hind-24
gunship was said to have been escort
ing an army convoy out of Jalalabad,
a major provincial capital and garrison
in eastern Afghanistan. Both of the
helicopter's crewmen were killed, the
reports said.

"Just because they (the Soviets)
struck a deal with Washington doesn't
mean the deal is binding on the
moujahedeen," Islamic Alliance leader
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said, referring
to the accords signed in Geneva this
spring providing for a Soviet with
drawal over the next nine months.
"If they want a safe withdrawal and
an end to the war, then they should
talk to the moujahedeen," he said.
Hekmatyar told a news conference
here that rather than celebrate a
moujahedeen victory on the date
agreed for the pullout to begin, May
15, "we have extensive operations
planned (for that day)."
Pakistani officials had urged that
the Soviet troop withdrawal be
facilitated by local cease-fire arrange

ments with district moujahedeen com
manders. Unconfirmed reports have
reached here of such accommodations
in at least two regions well inside Af
ghanistan. But Hekmatyar, reporting
on yesterday's regular conference of
Islamic resistance leaders, ruled out
an overall hold on hostilities.
Explained one Western diplomat
who is deeply concerned w r ith Afghan
affairs: "The moujahedeen strategy is
to keep the pressure on â€” to make it
hard for them (the Soviets)."
He noted that the truck convoys
hauling the Soviets out of the country
first bring in reinforcements and sup
plies for the pro-communist Afghan
army units that are replacing the Red
Army. "So they're fair game," he said.
"And the moujahedeen are attacking

them right and left."
In the Jalalabad incident, diplomatic
reports reaching Islamabad indicated
that a convoy of 40 to 60 trucks had
headed out of the provincial capital
carrying elements of the Soviet 66th
Brigade toward Kabul, the Afghan cap
ital, 75 miles to the west.
The Hind-24 gunship that was shot
down had been flying air cover for the
convoy, according to the reports. There
was no immediate report whether the
convoy itself had come under attack
from the resistance forces.
During the past week, convoys have
been shuttling Afghan regular army
troops into Jalalabad to replace the
departing Soviets, a process under way
throughout Afghanistan.
