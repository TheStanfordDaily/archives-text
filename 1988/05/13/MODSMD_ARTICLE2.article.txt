# Minority groups gain changes in Law School plan

Minority law students and the
Law School administration appear
to have struck a compromise on
a new enforcement procedure for
the school's non-discrimination
policy.
A Law School proposal drafted
Tuesday to change the enforce
ment procedure, which guards
against discrimination by employ
ers recruiting on campus, signals
significant gains for a coalition of
law student minority groups that
has sought to tighten the policy
for close to a year.
The Multicultural Council — a
coalition of women, minority, gay
and lesbian law student groups
— has pushed for reforms in the
enforcement policy, including a
student-elected representative to
help oversee recruiting violations

and a minimum sanction that
would publicize Law School find
ings that firms had discriminated
on campus.
The new proposal, which is the
third draft of a policy that dates
back to last December, permits
the Law Student Association to
elect the student representative
that will sit on the three-member
oversight committee enforcing the
policy. This is a gain from the
last proposal on April 20, when
the student was to be chosen by
an associate dean.
The proposal also specifies that
publicizing discriminatory con
duct by firms interviewing on
campus shall be "a minimum ap
propriate sanction." In the past,
the council has fought for mini
mum sanctions against firms that
discriminate off campus, but the
school has long balked at that
