# Minority groups gain changes in Law School plan
## 
### Nick Anderson Ken Yew Staff writers 
Minority law students and the
Law School administration appear
to have struck a compromise on
a new enforcement procedure for
the school's non-discrimination
policy.
A Law School proposal drafted
Tuesday to change the enforce
ment procedure, which guards
against discrimination by employ
ers recruiting on campus, signals
significant gains for a coalition of
law student minority groups that
has sought to tighten the policy
for close to a year.
The Multicultural Council — a
coalition of women, minority, gay
and lesbian law student groups
— has pushed for reforms in the
enforcement policy, including a
student-elected representative to
help oversee recruiting violations

and a minimum sanction that
would publicize Law School find
ings that firms had discriminated
on campus.
The new proposal, which is the
third draft of a policy that dates
back to last December, permits
the Law Student Association to
elect the student representative
that will sit on the three-member
oversight committee enforcing the
policy. This is a gain from the
last proposal on April 20, when
the student was to be chosen by
an associate dean.
The proposal also specifies that
publicizing discriminatory con
duct by firms interviewing on
campus shall be "a minimum ap
propriate sanction." In the past,
the council has fought for mini
mum sanctions against firms that
discriminate off campus, but the
school has long balked at that
demand, saying it is impossible to
effectively punish off-campus dis
crimination until a court rules
that discrimination actually oc
curred.
Jesus Bernal, a press represen
tative for the council, said yester

day that the school has taken
"positive steps" in the formula
tion of a new proposal. Although
not all council demands were met
and exact wording needs to be
finalized, "the proposal worked
toward a common goal," Bernal
said.
Bernal said the "policies are not
perfect." Next fall, the council
wants the school's placement
committee — which formulated

the drafts — to consider action
against firms that discriminate
off-campus, Bernal said.
Law School Dean Paul Brest
said the latest proposal will be
discussed in a faculty meeting
next year and, if approved, will
be implemented by the 1989-90
interviewing season.
Law Prof. Miguel Mendez, chair
of the Law School's Placement

Committee, denied that the new
proposal came in response to pres
sure from student groups, saying
that it had incorporated sugges
tions made by many students at
an open forum April 29.
Minority groups in the Law
School have consistently charged
that the non-discrimination policy
— which is very broad in scope
— is ineffective because it has
never been able to be enforced.
