## Respect partygoers

STOP HARASSING student
party-goers.
In addition to the normal
supply of students, several campus
parties last weekend were host to
Stanford police officers.
The police entered dorms and
demanded that a single student be
responsible to ensure that no un
derage students drink.
Aside from obvious legal ques
tions about whether the police can
in fact shoulder one individual
with the responsibility for the ac
tions of so many, the Stanford
police are undermining their rela
tions with students here through
incidents such as these.
In at least two of the cases, plan
ners voluntarily registered their
parties with the police. But their
trust was violated when they
received unwarranted visits by of
ficers before the parties actually
got underway.
Ironically, some of the students
involved had attended meetings
with the police earlier in the quar
ter where officers said that regis
tering parties was one way to im
prove working relations between
students and the police.
By taking advantage of student
goodwill, police are sending the
message that they neither respect
students nor are they willing to
work with them to combat problem
drinking.
Students involved have felt the
effect of this message that some
called "unfriendly" and an attempt
at "scare tactics."
The police cannot reasonably ex
pect students to continue to reg
ister their parties if they know
their cooperation will be used
against them.
This is not to de-emphasize the
important role the Stanford police
play in combating alcohol abuse
here. The entire Stanford commu
nity should be aware of the serious
ness of problem drinking. The

police have their work cut out for
them trying to control parties at
tended by hundreds of young
adults. Students must do their part
to control who drinks the alcohol
they serve and to look out for
others who have had too much to
drink at their parties.
Unfortunately, the fact that
police officers have had to call am
bulances for students with alcohol
poisoning several times recently in
dicates that parties are not as well
controlled as they should be.
As a result, police should encour
age students to be responsible for
their parties.
But using scare tactics to strong
arm students into submission is a
stupid tactic. Maintaining these
practices will only encourage stu
dents to drink underground and
inhibit them from working with
police officers.
To combat this, police must reas
sure students that registering their
parties will not incriminate them,
but will open lines of communica
tion between officers and those
who are holding parties.
Officers should also maintain
closer contact with the RA Council
to inform resident assistants —
and other interested students —
of the specific ways they can con
trol their parties with police assis
tance.
With a community problem such
as alcohol abuse, cooperation is es
sential among all members of the
community.
The recent development of inno
vative alcohol abuse programs by
Cowell Student Health Center and
other individuals may prove to be
an effective way to combat this
problem at Stanford.
While they should be recognized
for their participation in some of
these programs, the police should
extend this Cooperation into their
field practices.
