## University's policy inconsistent regarding alcohol 
### 
AT THE BEGINNING of each
quarter, Residential Education
and police officials hold a meet
ing to explain Stanford's policy regard
ing student alcohol consumption.
While they make it clear that it is
illegal for people under the age of 21
to drink in California and that the
University expect its students to abide
by the law, they also explain that
University authorities prefer to trust
students with the responsibility of
choosing whether or not to drink and
whether to serve alcohol at parties.
In this way, Res Ed does not blindly
deny underage drinking but instead
prevents students from driving off
campus to drink and encourages them
to handle drinking like responsible
adults.

Aware of this policy, Cedro House
decided to hold an all-campus party on
May 6. By Friday evening we had done
all we could to assure that this party
would be fun, successful and within
University guidelines.
Before it began, however, police
entered the dorm, took the names of
two resident assistants and told them
that if any students under the age of
21 were found drinking in the vicinity
of the party, those students and the
two RAs would be arrested.
Seeing that it would be too difficult
to assure that no minors would drink,
Cedro decided not to serve any alcohol.
As students arrived at our party and
saw that the advertised alcohol was
not being served, many went next door

to Okada where there was alcohol at a
party of which the police had not been
notified and which they had not en
tered.
We protest this inconsistency of the
alcohol policy's application. First, the
way in which the policy has been
stated and the way in which it was
applied Friday were clearly inconsis
tent.
While the police came to parties at
Cedro, Toyon and 558 Mayfield that
night, they did not go to others at Flo
Mo or Okada, so they could serve
alcohol while we could not.
Not only is it unfair to students to
have Stanford's alcohol policy inconsis
tently explained and applied, but it
encourages them to disobey the Uni
versity's own rules.

Students will be very unlikely to
make the effort to require student ID
checks, to serve EANABs and food, to
end the party by 1 a.m. and, least of
all, to notify the police if parties serv
ing alcohol must be held in secret, for
they will be held regardless.
We therefore request the answers to
some questions. Has the University
changed its alcohol policy? If so, why
has it done so, and why has it not
notified students of the change? We
deserve an explanation.
