# Conflicting policy on discrimination
## 
### 
I am absolutely opposed to any insti
tution, policy, activity or practice that
treats people differently because of the
way their skin looks. All individuals
are morally justified in questioning, in
standing up against, in fighting a sys
tem which denies them their right to
equality of opportunity. I can no
longer take quietly the discriminatory
practices and the racist activities I
have seen here on the Stanford
campus.
Stanford admissions. Page 20 of the
Guide to Graduate Admissions states
that Stanford "does not discriminate
against students on the basis of sex,
race, color, handicap, religion, sexual
orientation or national and ethnic
origin in the administration of its edu
cational policies, admissions policies,
scholarships and loan programs and
athletic and other University-

administered programs."
Why, then, on page 1 of Stanford's
"Application for Admission to the
Graduate Division" is there a volun
tary section asking me to "please indi
cate (my) ethnic origin"? The applica
tion explains that the U.S. Department
of Education requires this information
of Stanford.
In what ethnic group does Stanford
classify those students who choose not
to answer the question? Does the De
partment of Education require that the
information be designated on the ad
missions application?
Is Stanford told by the Department
of Education which numbers look
"good" and which look "bad"? If so,
how does Stanford act upon that infor
mation? Can't Stanford put that sec
tion of the application on a separate
reply card, a card on which a student
need not put his name? Shouldn't
Stanford eliminate the possibility that
someone may be discriminated against
on the basis of this information?
Stanford Financial Aid. Why do I

have there in front of me a letter
about the Irvine Foundation Fellowship
Program (Stanford University letter
head), which states clearly that "pref
erence is given to underrepresented
ethnic minorities."
Who authorized that sentence? If the
Irvine Foundation allows for discrimi
nation, why does Stanford participate?
How much "weight" is attached to the
color of one's skin when the applica
tions are being reviewed? How can
Stanford justify that this program is in
compliance with its non-discriminatory
policy?
The Stanford Student Body. Stu
dents who wish to fight for equality of
opportunity, as I do, should join hands
and together fight against racism,
which hurts all of us.
Why do some students choose to
wear sweatshirts proclaiming their
color of skin? These articles of clothing
misplace the battle lines, dividing stu
dents into the white and the black,
confusing a color with a code. It is my
view that the slogans on the clothes

serve only to perpetuate racist views
among the student body.
I write out of frustration, out of
anger, out of disappointment, that
racism is so much a part of my experi
ence at Stanford. We students have the
power to question, to demand answers,
and to put right what is wrong here
on campus.
Sadly, I feel that we have targeted
each other, not the systems and prac
tices fostering racism, as the enemies
in this necessary struggle for what is
right.
