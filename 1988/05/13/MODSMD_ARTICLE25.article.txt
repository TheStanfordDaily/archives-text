# Mitch Steinberger
## Who will Duke select? 
### 
STARK NAKED politics determines
vice presidential picks. Keep an eye
on the summer conventions, and
you'll see what I mean.
Four years ago, the Democrats nobly
nominated former Rep. Geraldine Fer
raro, D-N.Y., for vice president. Conser
vative Southerner Jimmy Carter
balanced his 1976 ticket by choosing
Northern liberal Walter Mondale. And
we all know that Dick Nixon picked Spiro
Agnew so that no one could dream of
assassinating Nixon.
This year's picks will be no less political
and no less crucial.
Three weeks ago I eyeballed possibili
ties for the GOP viceman. Now it's time
to survey the odds on the much more
motley Democratic crew available to the
inevitable nominee, Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
Rev. Jesse Jackson: 100-1. Neither the
Democratic establishment nor Jackson
likes this idea. Besides, Jackson has really
already won.
It is Jackson's top issues that have
disproportionately become the big cam
paign issues: drugs, education, unemploy
ment — even the very validity of
Reaganomics. He doubled his popular
vote tally of 1984.
But most importantly, Jackson did well
as a black man who happened to be a
radical liberal. Ergo, a centrist black pres
ident has become a real possibility for
the near future. We Have Not Overcome
yet, but Jesse Jackson nudged Someday
much closer.
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.: 11-1. Seems
like the Washington pundits have already
picked the conservative Nunn as the "ob
vious" vice president pick for Dukakis.
They say that this Southern hawk of

fers just what Northern dove Dukakis
needs for ticket balance: geography,
foreign and military policy expertise and
conservatism — The Nunn Factors. They
say that Nunn will accept the No. 2 spot,
provided he also gets to be Secretary of
State or Defense. So they say.
What bunk. Nunn differs with Dukakis
on more issues than he does with George
Bush. He's just too conservative (or Du
kakis is too liberal) for this marriage to
work. Moreover, Dukakis is looking for
charisma, while Nunn is probably the
single most boring person in Dixie.
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio: 10-1. Every
one loves an astronaut, and the Glenn
is no exception. He'd deliver the Midwest
to the Democrats and add mild Nunn
Factors. Including boredom.
Sen. Lloyd Rentsen, D-Texas: 6-1.
Bentsen, effective but uncharismatic
(sound familiar?), offers Texas' 29 elec
toral votes — which Reagan won in '80
and '84. Bentsen's lack of charisma and
foreign policy experience hurts his
chances for vice president, sure. Without
him, however, the Democrats will just as
surely lose Texas to sometime resident
Bush.
Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb:
6-1. Robb's a tremendously popular
centrist semi-Southerner who nearly ran
for president himself. He'd carry much
of the South, true, but he's basically a
Dixie Dukakis — he couldn't help heal
the ticket's handicap: foreign policy in
experience.
San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros:
5-1. Like Robb, Cisneros has a golden
track record as a charismatic domestic
manager who could deliver Southern
votes. Like Robb, Cisneros is one of the
brightest young Democratic stars in the

country. And like Robb, Cisneros has zero
foreign and military policy seasoning.
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.: 7-4. Graham,
a former two-term governor, also offers
tempting electoral votes. But he is yet
another liberal domestic expert; He has
no Nunn Factors.
Sen. A! Gore, D-Tenn.: Even money.
Certainly A 1 Gore emerges as the clear
favorite. Unlike everyone else but Jack
son, he's put in his hard time on the
campaign trail; the Democratic delegates
won't forget that.
His often breathtaking command of
arms control and foreign policy issues
will dovetail neatly with Mike Dukakis'
expertise in domestic economics. Gore
demonstrated on Super Tuesday that he
can command the Southern vote.
And Gore, as a freshman senator, won't
be taking a cut in power (as Senate vet
erans Nunn and Glenn would be) in ac
cepting the vice presidential nomination.
And there you have it — or most of
it since Dianne Feinstein, Bruce Babbitt,
Patricia Schroeder and others have to be
considered as well. But if I were Mike
Dukakis, 1 know who I'd pick. Someone
with even more Nunn Factors than Sam
Nunn. Someone with on-the-job experi
ence.
George Bush. The right man for the
job.

(sound familiar?), offers Texas' 29 elec
toral votes — which Reagan won in '80
and '84. Bentsen's lack of charisma and
foreign policy experience hurts his
chances for vice president, sure. Without
him, however, the Democrats will just as
surely lose Texas to sometime resident
Bush.
Former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb:
6-1. Robb's a tremendously popular
centrist semi-Southerner who nearly ran
for president himself. He'd carry much
of the South, true, but he's basically a
Dixie Dukakis — he couldn't help heal
the ticket's handicap: foreign policy in
experience.
San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros:
5-1. Like Robb, Cisneros has a golden
track record as a charismatic domestic
manager who could deliver Southern
votes. Like Robb, Cisneros is one of the
brightest young Democratic stars in the

country. And like Robb, Cisneros has zero
foreign and military policy seasoning.
Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.: 7-4. Graham,
a former two-term governor, also offers
tempting electoral votes. But he is yet
another liberal domestic expert; He has
no Nunn Factors.
Sen. A! Gore, D-Tenn.: Even money.
Certainly A 1 Gore emerges as the clear
favorite. Unlike everyone else but Jack
son, he's put in his hard time on the
campaign trail; the Democratic delegates
won't forget that.
His often breathtaking command of
arms control and foreign policy issues
will dovetail neatly with Mike Dukakis'
expertise in domestic economics. Gore
demonstrated on Super Tuesday that he
can command the Southern vote.
And Gore, as a freshman senator, won't
be taking a cut in power (as Senate vet
erans Nunn and Glenn would be) in ac
cepting the vice presidential nomination.
And there you have it — or most of
it since Dianne Feinstein, Bruce Babbitt,
Patricia Schroeder and others have to be
considered as well. But if I were Mike
Dukakis, 1 know who I'd pick. Someone
with even more Nunn Factors than Sam
Nunn. Someone with on-the-job experi
ence.
George Bush. The right man for the
job.
