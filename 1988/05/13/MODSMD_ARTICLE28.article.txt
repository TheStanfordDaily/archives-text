## A 						stuttering struggle 
### Katherine Toy 
Moses and Aristotle had it. So did Darwin, Isaac
Newton, Winston Churchill and Marilyn Monroe.
They all had stuttering disabilities.
There are more than 15 million stutterers in the
world today and approximately 1 million in the
United States alone. But most stutterers do not
share a spot in the limelight — fear and shame
hold them back from communicating.
Coming to terms with the stuttering problem,
the U.S. Congress has declared this week National
Stuttering Awareness Week. Congress has never
before officially recognized stuttering as a national
problem.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, stuttering is a genetic neurological
condition that almost always begins in childhood,
usually between the ages of two and four. Experts
are not certain exactly what causes stutterin'g.
Muscle coordination and a lower-than-normal speak
ing rate are probable causes.
Research has also shown that stuttering seems
to run in families and affects more males than
females.
About 80 percent of children who stutter are able
to speak normally by the time they are adults,
regardless of whether they have had therapy. Some
adults also have been known to stop stuttering. All
stutterers can speak fluently some of the time.
Here at Stanford there is an estimated 130 stu
dents with a stuttering disability. And fear of
ridicule prevents many from speaking up.
"Very few people will come forward and accept
that they stammer. They want to hide and not let
people know," said graduate student Perwez
Shahabuddin, a stutterer himself.
"Stuttering is not a very defined disease right
now. It's not like being blind or deaf. Stuttering is
not a clear handicap," Shahabuddin said.
But freshman Andrew Moses has, for the most
part, overcome his stuttering handicap. "I've had
the problem for so long now that I can think ahead
and some words I know I'll have problems with,
so I'll change the words," he said.
Despite his success dealing with the problem,
Moses admitted that classes that base grading on
discussion sometimes make him nervous.
"In section I am hesitant to say something. When
I do, I formulate it all first. It's hard for me to ad
lib," he said.
According to Moses, alleviating the stuttering

'It's just that we have trouble get
ting words out. It's not that we're
any less intelligent.'

problem takes determination. For example, when
he first came to Stanford, Moses had difficulty
dealing with his speech disability because he was
no longer meeting with a speech therapist and was
in a new environment.
"When I first came here [my stuttering] was a
little worse," he said. "I made a conscious effort
to make it not as bad."
Shahabuddin, who is presently a teaching assis
tant for an engineering class, said he also must
concentrate when speaking in front of a group. Like
Moses, Shahabuddin admitted that dealing with his
problem "takes a lot of energy."
Dr. Kathryn Beadle of the Mid-Peninsula Speech
and Language Clinic works with one or two Stanford
students a year. "Most stutterers, with the right
kind of help, can control their stuttering, but you
can't cure it. Over an 80-year period, there's been
no cure that's stood up under scrutiny," Beadle
explained.
"It's certainly not an easy handicap to deal with,"
said Beadle, emphasizing that "acceptance is the
key."
For Shahabuddin, acceptance by society as well
as by the individual is an important factor in dealing
with the disability.
"The attitude of the individual must change. A
stutterer needs self-acceptance or [therapy] won't
help," he said.
Founded in 1977, the National Stuttering Project
helps individuals like Shahabuddin face their dis
ability. The project is a "self-help" group meeting
the needs of children and adults who stutter. The
organization now serves 60 cities and over 3,000
members across the country.
According to John Ahlbach, executive director of
the National Stuttering Project, "Stuttering is not
the nervous disorder most people think it is. It's
just that we have trouble getting words out. It's
not that we're any less intelligent."
For Moses, stuttering is a problem common to
all. "Everyone stutters. The whole world does. . . .
It's just that for people with the disability it's a
more permanent thing," he said.
