# Cap, gown: for a clown?
## 
### Paul De Figueirdo Staff writer 
On June 12, our beloved
seniors will don their caps and
gowns and proudly receive the
diplomas they so deserve. But
will these brilliant soon-to-be
graduates have any idea why
they are wearing black tent-like
dresses and cardboard hats?

Wouldn't shorts and T-shirts
be more in step with California
fashion? How did this "cap and
gown" tradition get started?
According to the "Encyclope
dia of World Costume," the cap
and gown worn at Western uni
versity commencement ceremo
nies is essentially the same style
as the everyday outfits worn in
the late Middle Ages and early
Renaissance.
The cap, the gown and the
hood — three main pieces of
the medieval costume — have
undergone a few alterations
over the years. Most changes
have been made in the design
of the gown, which has seen
various lengths, colors and
sleeve styles.
The early European univer
sities of the 12th and 13th cen
turies were closely associated
with the Church, and since most
of the academics were in the
Holy Orders, religious dress was
normally worn. Consisting of
long, loose tunics, hoods with
shoulder cape, hoses and shoes,

the clothing was similar to the
styles everyone else wore in that
time.
In the later Middle Ages,
when the general fashion trend
was towards short tunics, the
scholars who were not directly
associated with the Church kept
wearing the gowns of the older
style. But now the academics'
gowns were just a bit shorter
than what their priestly coun
terparts wore. Scholars have
worn these gowns ever since —
at least for all formal occasions.
Today the head covering used
for most University outfitting
is the mortar-board, trencher or
catercap. The covering has a
stiffened round cap or headpiece
with a square board on top and
a tassel attached. This unusual
head covering was the standard
style in most 12th century West
ern universities.
PUZZLE
Listed below is an array of
different clothing. Though all
are not as bizarre as the aca
demic costume, see if you can
identify the following:
1. aglet — a. the ruffled edges
of a medieval cape b. sixteenth

century waistcoat c. type of yarn
d. a lace with metal tag.
2. anorak — a. Eskimo snow
shoe b. parka c. linen undergar
met d. neckpiece.
3. dungarees — a. workper
son's overalls b. loose fitting
shirt c. long length shorts d.
painter's apron.
4. genappe — a. Irish skirt b.
French headpiece c. Egyptian
cloth d. Belgian yarn.
5. raffia — a. Indian material
used to make saris b. a tightly
woven fabric of the Andes c.
palm leaves used to make hats
and bags d. African footwear.
6. tog — a. Dutch shoes b.
colloquial term for any type of
garmet c. top hat d. Norwegian
formal attire.
7. aba — a. South American
poncho b. loose gown worn in
Turkey c. bandana d. Italian
blouse.

For the remainder of the quar
ter, Brain Teaser will appear
