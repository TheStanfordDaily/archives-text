# Rosse denies accusation of abuse in hiring procedures
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
In his report to the Faculty Sen
ate yesterday, Provost James
Rosse dismissed recent allegations
that faculty hiring procedures are
being abused.
Asst. Sociology Prof. Henry
Walker has charged that waivers
used by department heads to
recruit specific faculty members
without going through a nation
wide search process discourage
potential minority and female fac
ulty applicants.
Rosse denied specific accusa
tions that the Sociology Depart
ment had abused search waivers

in its recent hiring of two junior
faculty members, Szonja Szelenyi
and David Grusky.
According to Rosse, Szelenyi's
appointment was the result of a
full departmental search. "Sze
lenyi was selected unanimously by
the department from a large and
well-qualified applicant pool,"
Rosse said.
However, Grusky, who is en
gaged to Szelenyi, was appointed
under the search waiver process,
in which department heads may
recruit specific scholars without
a rigorous search, Rosse added.
Although Szelenyi made her ac
ceptance of Stanford's offer con
tingent upon her fiance also re-

ceiving a position,
Rosse noted that
Grusky had
emerged as the
department's top
choice in a search
conducted i n
1985. He did not
accept a position
at Stanford at
that time.

Rosse said when Grusky resub
mitted his application, the depart
ment "fully reconsidered his
qualifications" and "reaffirmed its
original judgement."
In other senate business, Oper
ations Research Prof. Gerald
Lieberman, who will turn his po

sition as senate chair over to Law
Prof. John Kaplan next year, an
nounced that the senate's Com
mittee on Committees is "working
diligently" to investigate a poten
tial contradiction in the senate's
Area One decision establishing
the Culture, Ideas and Values pro
gram.
Carlos Camargo, an associate
professor of medicine and a mem
ber of the faculty senate, pointed
out at the last senate meeting
that the Area One legislation, as
passed, takes race and sex into
consideration in the selection of
Area One committee members.
These committee members will
decide which topics and/or works

will make up the Area One re
quirement each year.
Using race or sex as a criteria
to select committee members vi
olates guidelines established in
the faculty handbook, according
to Camargo.
The Committee on Committees
plans to present a report on the
issue to the senate before the end
of the academic year, Lieberman
said.
The senate also voted unani
mously to establish a pilot pro
gram for continuing studies that
will allow community members to
take courses at the University.
The program will target mem
bers of the "greater Stanford

metropolitan area" to enroll in
courses at Stanford, according to
Vice Provost for Academic Plan
ning and Development William
Chace, who presented the pro
gram proposal to the senate.
Two years ago, Rosse estab
lished a task force to study the
feasibility of establishing a pro
gram at Stanford that would allow
members of the surrounding com
munity to take courses taught by
top University professors.
Chace, who headed the task
force, said task force members
found a great interest in such' a
program in the surrounding area
