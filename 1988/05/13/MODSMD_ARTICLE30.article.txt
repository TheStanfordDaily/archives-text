## Stage Review This 'Shadow' doesn't know better 
### Debbie Frockt Staff writer 
There's no way to take a bad
script and transform it into a good
production. Sometimes a director,
if he or she is especially lucky or
exceptionally gifted, can make the
best of a bad situation and create
an acceptable performance.
Unfortunately, this is not the
case with the Drama Depart
ment's current production of Ev
geny Lvovich Shvarts' "The
Shadow."
My first question to director
Denise Chuk would have to be,
"Why this play?" Billed as a "Most
Unusual Fairytale," Shvarts'
story is a horribly muddled bore.
It creeps and crawls along in a
disjointed mangle of poorly writ
ten dialogue from the beginning,
and sadly we realize that we've
gone nowhere by the final curtain.
The Scholar, adequately played
by Jeff Schwamberger, begins by
telling us of a canceled speaking
engagement on fairytales. I use
the word "adequate" for Schwam
berger because that is about the
best any actor could do with such
a dry, one-dimensional part. From
there he enters into a strange
world of the living fairytale, that
is more chaotic than fantastic.
In fact, "The Shadow" oflens
seems to be little more than a
rather large group of displaced,
poorly conceived and even more
poorly written characters who
happened to escape from their
creator's mind by accident. Much
to our dismay, he was unable to
catch them before they found a

place on stage.
From this inauspicious begin
ning Shvarts proceeds into a se
ries of very loosely connected plots
and counterplots that never quite
manage to blend together into an
interesting or cohesive whole. To
make matters worse, the vignettes
have a stiff, hollow ring to them.
The characters are stuck in
empty babble where nothing of
any great importance is at stake.
There's no way to invest yourself
into such a piece.
There are a few bright spots in
Chuk's direction which manage
to lighten some of the weight of
this production. A pompous and
decrepit Minister of Finance (Ric
Simmons) is carried around by
his two strong, silent-type valets.
Unable to move his limbs or form
any facial expressions himself, he
shoots orders like "Put me the
pose of great satisfaction!" to his
henchmen.
Chuk makes the most of these
comic gems as her actors rear
range the old coot into his re
quests. She demonstrates a subtle
understanding of the possibilities
of physical humor.
Chuk captures a crucial mo
ment near the play's beginning
when the highly elusive and much
talked-about Princess (Dana
Klapper) appears on stage. She
utilizes background music with a
magical quality in combination
with a rather seductive and mys
terious entrance to capture just
the right mood to create intrigue.
If this appealing allure of whimsy
could have been maintained more
consistently, "The Shadow" may

have fared better.
For the most part, however, the
element of wide-eyed fantasy was
missing.
Chuk did not manage to max
imize the potential of the inter-
Elay between Schwamberger and
is shadow, Michael Alves. The
shadow commits mutiny aban
doning his long-time friend to live
his own life in pursuit of power.
This opens up myriad possibil
ities for some wonderful inter
action between Schwamberger
and Alves. However, the contact
between the two is minimal and
in the few scenes where the
Shadow mirrors his "owner" the
timing is a bit off and the use
of the technique is inconsistent.
The one stellar performance
of the evening is Charlotte Al
exander's Julia Julie. A prima
donna soprano if there ever was
one, Julia expounds at great
length upon her "Circle of Real
People" where everybody always
smiles so you never know what
they are thinking.
Alexander's expressions are
right out of a silent movie, as
she coos pouty faces, Shock,
Fear, Sadness, Seduction and
Joy at the audience. Her affected
poses and exaggerated walk and
voice combine to form a mag
nificent comic presence on the
stage.

"The Shadow" will be presented
at the Little Theater at 8 p.m.
May 13 and 14; and May 18
through 21 at the Little Theater
at 8 p.m.
