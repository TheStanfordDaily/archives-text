# Stage Review
## Branner makes beautiful music 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Branner Hall's production of
"Studio 42" is deliciously
amusing and competently put
together. But its greatest charm
is that the musical is completely
original, created by a corps of
dedicated Stanford frosh, whose
talent and attention to detail
are evidenced by the quality of
the whole production.
Clever writing, convincingly
professional music, believable
acting, energetic dancing and
successful staging under less
than-ideal conditions in the
Branner Dining Hall combine
to bring alive a fairly familiar
storyline.
The musical chronicles a few
of the antics and rough times
at the studio of a television
show. Occasionally the story
relies tritely and ineffectively on
stereotypes, most noticably
stereotyped working relation
ships of men and women, and
borders once or twice on cliche.
Nonetheless, this is the nature
of musicals.
Once one is swept up in the
standard sweetness and well
intentioned entertainment, set
in a context consciously distant
from Stanford, the show is very
enjoyable and well-worth seeing.
The musical began to take
shape in fall quarter, when a
group of students in Branner,
most with previous theater ex

perience, decided to put on a
Branner spring musical, as was
been done two years ago.
"We just happened to have
incredible talent in the dorm,
and we were all excited about
creating our own show," said
freshman Christopher LaPuma,
who directed and produced
"Studio 42."
The script was written by a
staff of six writers, headed by
Alicia Dißado, mostly during
winter term. Dißado said the
hardest part was deciding on
what to write about, and once
that was set "it took off the
ground."
LaPuma said they chose to
write a musical because "musi

cals are more fun (than plays)
and because we had such
talented composers."
The music definitely is one of
the highlights of the show. The
composers, Rich Reay and
Soham Roy, who also accom
pany the production, cleverly
combine the familiar sound of
musicals with their respective
specialties, jazz and pop-rock.
LaPuma had experience act
ing and directing in high school.
He was an actor in Gaieties this
fall and will be associate director
of Gaieties next vear.

"Studio 42" will be presented
at 8 p.m. in Branner Dining
Hall today and tomorrow.
