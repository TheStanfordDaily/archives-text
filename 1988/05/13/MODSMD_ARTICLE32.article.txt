"Bagdad Cafe"
Park Theater
1275 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
Weirdness is chic these days —
it gets attention. Look at "Blue
Velvet," "Siesta," and most re
cently, "Bagdad Cafe." Shot at
odd angles, in yellow light, this
movie tells the story of a fat Ger
man woman who wanders into a
dumpy desert motel and makes
friends with the people living
there.
Clearly, this isn't your standard
movie fare — it's funkier, more
daring. But if you bother to look
underneath this film's superficial
thematic and cinematic weird
ness, you come up with something
very shallow and mundane. The
weirdness is just veneer.
Jasmin (Marianne Sagebrecht)
is a German housewife who
separates from her husband in
the middle of the desert. Dragging
her suitcase along, she finds her
self at the Bagdad Cafe, a grimy
diner/motel inhabited by various
weirdos, and run by Brenda
(C.C.H. Pounder), a bony, sour
black woman.
While the beginning, when Jas
min is alone and morose, has an
eerie, interesting feel, the end is
generically heartwarming. It's
like "The Sound of Music," only

not so beautiful.
So we have here your basic
uplifting movie, only this time
dressed in off-the-wall clothing.
Don't be fooled: This is the same
thing we've seen more than a few
times before, except director
Percy Adlon has artfully disguised
it by choosing an overweight
actress to play the lead, by casting
the movie with freaks and by
using bizarre camera angles.
Unquestionably this makes the
movie more fun to watch: "Bag
dad Cafe" is colorful and distinc
tive. But it's the same sentimental
casserole movie directors have
been serving us for years, only
here it's been reheated and topped
with cheese.

"Dead Heat"
Century Cinema 10

"I was looking for something a
bit more suspenseful," said the
lady at the jewelery store mo
ments before a couple zombies
robbed it.
I was looking for a little sus
pense from the movie "Dead
Heat" but that wasn't to be.
What I did find was a poorly
written, somewhat undefined
comedy about dead cops. For some

reason I enjoyed it.
The plot of the movie revolves
around dead bodies coming back
to life and being bad, getting shot
several times and then turning
into goo.
Mortis (Treat Williams) is a cop.
A good cop, but a dead cop. He
has 12 hours before his dead body
turns into a puddle of gooey bio
logical stew. Since he's already
dead he doesn't have to worry
about little things like bullets. In
fact he starts collecting them in
his body soon after discovering
they don't hurt.
Throughout most of the movie,
cop Joe Piscopo, who is alive,
drops one liners like, "Remember
the good old days when bullets
killed people?" "Being dead is not
something you should advertise,"
and "Personally I would like to
come back as the seat on a girl's
bike."
Turns out just about everyone
in the movie is dead or will die.
It will be difficult to make a sequel
to this one.

"Salsa"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at 101
Mountain View
The pre-pubescent girls in the
theater loved "Salsa" — they were

jabbering about it in the restroom
after the show, and listening to
their excited chatter brought me
back a few years to when "Grease"
was the "hot" movie and I was
that easily thrilled by corny
romance and dancing.
"Salsa" is a junky, lively and
brainless movie that 13-year-old
girls will love, and everyone else
should at least be able to enjoy.
Rico (Robby Rosa) is the slickest
dancer at "the Club." He lives for
the nights when he can dance and
be the center of attention (sound
a little like "Saturday Night
Fever"?). At day he works at a
garage to support his widowed
mother and younger sister Mar
garita, but he dreams of dancing
and winning a trip to Puerto Rico
— which, in this movie, is made
into some sort of Promised Land.
Everyone wants to be in Puerto
Rico.
But there are wicked women
out there who want to corrupt
Rico, and take him away from his
lovely girlfriend.
Meanwhile, his innocent sister
(of whom he is insanely protec
tive) has fallen in love with his
innocent best friend Ken (Rodney
Harvey). This enrages Rico and
he beats Ken bloody.
The "high" drama is inter
spersed with dancing sequences
which are exhilarating and fun to

watch, though not quite up to
what we've seen in past dance
movies.
Robby Rosa, the lead actor and
dancer, looks a lot like Michael
Jackson, but he seems normal,
more masculine. He's a likeable
young actor who, if he's lucky,
will soon be seen on some posters
without his shirt on.
The one really jarring and dis
turbing feature of this movie is
the sexism that goes candy-coated
and ignored. The women in this

movie are dark-haired Barbie
dolls. While "Salsa" is too good
natured to be offensive, the way
Margarita jumps at Rico's com
mand is enough to make anyone
wince.
This is a pleasant, watchable
film. The script could use some
help, the acting is often unmen
tionably bad, but this movie
works. It goes by quickly and
doesn't try to be more than what
it is: very light entertainment.
