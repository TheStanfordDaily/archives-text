## Stanford advances to quarterfinals Rossides leads Card — no questions asked 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES -
For three months,
Eleni Rossides was
grasping for expla
nations: What ex
actly was her in
jury? When would

she be able to play?
Rossides is still somewhat be
wildered. However, instead of
being frustrated, she is at this
point slightly amazed. After al
most three months with little
progress, how did her groin injury
improve so suddenly? And how
has she been able to get back into
competitive form so quickly?
In her first match since Feb. 7,
the Stanford junior ignored all
those questions for the time being

Stanford 5, Duke 1
Lisa Green (S) defeats Patti O'Reilly 6-1, 6-4.
Susan Sabo (D) defeats Teri Whitlinger 6-2, 6-3.
Sandra Birch (S) defeats Christine O'Reilly 6-1, 6-2.
Kay Tittle (S) defeats Terrl O'Reilly 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Eleni Rossides (S) defeats Lee Shelburne 6-3, 6-2.
Cindy Buchsbaum (S) defeats Katrina Greenman 7-5,
6-7 (5-7), 6-0.

and simply concentrated on an
impressive 6-3, 6-2 win over
Duke's Lee Shelburne yesterday
as the second-seeded Cardinal (24-
2) beat the Blue Devils (24-6) 5-1
to advance to today's quarterfinal
round of the NCAA Women's Ten
nis Championships.

Stanford is matched today
against seventh-seeded Georgia at
2 p.m. at UCLA's Sunset Courts.
The Cardinal and Bulldogs met
in last year's final, which Stanford
won 5-1.
Playing in the No. 5 singles slot,
Rossides was every bit as good as

the score of her match indicated.
Shelburne tried to move her
around the court, but Rossides
was up to the challenge, often
scampering from the baseline to
the net and from side to side to
win points.
It was only a couple of weeks
ago that Rossides was confined to
hitting from a stationary position
to protect her groin. "I was
worried for awhile," she said. "I'm
not exactly sure how it got bet
ter."
Her first practice set was only
five days ago, and the progress
she has made since that time has
been surprising even to her.
"Honestly it hasn't taken all that
much to get back, and I don't
know why," Rossides said.
And now, just two weeks after
she doubted whether she would
play at the NCAAs, Rossides ex
pects to make a major contribu
tion to the Cardinal's cause. "I'll
be disappointed if I lose," she said.
"I know [Stanford Coach Frank
Brennanl is expecting me to win."
As well as Rossides played yes
terday, she could not beat team
mate Sandra Birch off the court.
Playing in her first NCAA tour
nament, the Cardinal freshman
didn't seem to be fazed at all by
the pressure as she got Stanford
on the scoreboard first with a 6-1,
6-2 victory over Duke's Christine
O'Reilly in the No. 3 singles.
"I was a little nervous, but I
felt very well prepared," Birch
said.
It was not a good day for the
O'Reilly family. Christine is one
of three triplets that play for
Duke, and her sisters were also
knocked off in straight sets. Lisa
Green upended Patti O'Reilly 6-1,
6-4 in the No. 1 singles, and Kay
Tittle held on against Terri
O'Reilly to record a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4)
victory in the No. 4 contest.
The twins — Tami and Teri
Whitlinger — were as frustrated
as the triplets yesterday. Tami
continues to be sidelined by a
groin injury and in Brennan's es
timation has a "very, very slim"
chance of playing this weekend.
Yesterday she could only watch
her sister, who did not provide
too much viewing pleasure. Teri

fell 6-2, 6-3 to Duke's Susan Sabo
in the No. 2 singles.
With the team score 4-1, only
the No. 6 singles remained. Stan
ford's Cindy Buchsbaum and the
Blue Devils' Katrina Greenman
split two very close sets. But with
all of her Cardinal teammates
watching, Buchsbaum annihilated
Greenman in the third set to post
a 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-0 win that
clinched the team victory.
"Cindy was great," Brennan
said. "She was our star today."
Without Tami Whitlinger, the
Cardinal will need several star
performances to capture its third
straight NCAA title, something
that Brennan believes is still pos
sible. "We played Cal (two weeks
ago in Berkeley) without Tami

and won, so that was a nice
confidence-builder," he said. "We
know we're pretty damn good."
Card notes
In yesterday's other matches, only
one seeded team was upset. Arizona
State edged eighth-seeded Miami
(Fla.) 5-4, winning the final doubles
match in a third-set tie-breaker.
The Sun Devils play top-seeded
Florida in a quarterfinal match this
morning. The Gators' Halle Cioffi,
the nation's No. 1-ranked singles
player, lost yesterday to Pepperdine's
Ginger Helgeson, but Florida was still
able to crush the Waves 5-1.
In the other quarterfinals, fourth
seeded UCLA battles fifth-seeded Cal
ifornia, and third-seeded USC takes
on sixth-seeded Kentucky.

won 5-1.
Playing in the No. 5 singles slot,
Rossides was every bit as good as

the score of her match indicated.
Shelburne tried to move her
around the court, but Rossides
was up to the challenge, often
scampering from the baseline to
the net and from side to side to
win points.
It was only a couple of weeks
ago that Rossides was confined to
hitting from a stationary position
to protect her groin. "I was
worried for awhile," she said. "I'm
not exactly sure how it got bet
ter."
Her first practice set was only
five days ago, and the progress
she has made since that time has
been surprising even to her.
"Honestly it hasn't taken all that
much to get back, and I don't
know why," Rossides said.
And now, just two weeks after
she doubted whether she would
play at the NCAAs, Rossides ex
pects to make a major contribu
tion to the Cardinal's cause. "I'll
be disappointed if I lose," she said.
"I know [Stanford Coach Frank
Brennanl is expecting me to win."
As well as Rossides played yes
terday, she could not beat team
mate Sandra Birch off the court.
Playing in her first NCAA tour
nament, the Cardinal freshman
didn't seem to be fazed at all by
the pressure as she got Stanford
on the scoreboard first with a 6-1,
6-2 victory over Duke's Christine
O'Reilly in the No. 3 singles.
"I was a little nervous, but I
felt very well prepared," Birch
said.
It was not a good day for the
O'Reilly family. Christine is one
of three triplets that play for
Duke, and her sisters were also
knocked off in straight sets. Lisa
Green upended Patti O'Reilly 6-1,
6-4 in the No. 1 singles, and Kay
Tittle held on against Terri
O'Reilly to record a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4)
victory in the No. 4 contest.
The twins — Tami and Teri
Whitlinger — were as frustrated
as the triplets yesterday. Tami
continues to be sidelined by a
groin injury and in Brennan's es
timation has a "very, very slim"
chance of playing this weekend.
Yesterday she could only watch
her sister, who did not provide
too much viewing pleasure. Teri

fell 6-2, 6-3 to Duke's Susan Sabo
in the No. 2 singles.
With the team score 4-1, only
the No. 6 singles remained. Stan
ford's Cindy Buchsbaum and the
Blue Devils' Katrina Greenman
split two very close sets. But with
all of her Cardinal teammates
watching, Buchsbaum annihilated
Greenman in the third set to post
a 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-0 win that
clinched the team victory.
"Cindy was great," Brennan
said. "She was our star today."
Without Tami Whitlinger, the
Cardinal will need several star
performances to capture its third
straight NCAA title, something
that Brennan believes is still pos
sible. "We played Cal (two weeks
ago in Berkeley) without Tami

and won, so that was a nice
confidence-builder," he said. "We
know we're pretty damn good."
Card notes
In yesterday's other matches, only
one seeded team was upset. Arizona
State edged eighth-seeded Miami
(Fla.) 5-4, winning the final doubles
match in a third-set tie-breaker.
The Sun Devils play top-seeded
Florida in a quarterfinal match this
morning. The Gators' Halle Cioffi,
the nation's No. 1-ranked singles
player, lost yesterday to Pepperdine's
Ginger Helgeson, but Florida was still
able to crush the Waves 5-1.
In the other quarterfinals, fourth
seeded UCLA battles fifth-seeded Cal
ifornia, and third-seeded USC takes
on sixth-seeded Kentucky.

LOS ANGELES -
For three months,
Eleni Rossides was
grasping for expla
nations: What ex
actly was her in
jury? When would

she be able to play?
Rossides is still somewhat be
wildered. However, instead of
being frustrated, she is at this
point slightly amazed. After al
most three months with little
progress, how did her groin injury
improve so suddenly? And how
has she been able to get back into
competitive form so quickly?
In her first match since Feb. 7,
the Stanford junior ignored all
those questions for the time being

Stanford 5, Duke 1
Lisa Green (S) defeats Patti O'Reilly 6-1, 6-4.
Susan Sabo (D) defeats Teri Whitlinger 6-2, 6-3.
Sandra Birch (S) defeats Christine O'Reilly 6-1, 6-2.
Kay Tittle (S) defeats Terrl O'Reilly 6-3, 7-6 (7-4).
Eleni Rossides (S) defeats Lee Shelburne 6-3, 6-2.
Cindy Buchsbaum (S) defeats Katrina Greenman 7-5,
6-7 (5-7), 6-0.

and simply concentrated on an
impressive 6-3, 6-2 win over
Duke's Lee Shelburne yesterday
as the second-seeded Cardinal (24-
2) beat the Blue Devils (24-6) 5-1
to advance to today's quarterfinal
round of the NCAA Women's Ten
nis Championships.

Stanford is matched today
against seventh-seeded Georgia at
2 p.m. at UCLA's Sunset Courts.
