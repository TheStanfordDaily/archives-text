# Trojans and Fridays haunt baseball
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
It's Friday the 13th,
but you don't have to
be superstitious to
think that this day is
different from the rest
of the week for the
Stanford baseball team.

It has been several weeks — 11, to be
exact — since the Cardinal won a game
on a Friday.
The Cardinal is 3-9 in Friday games
this season, and has lost its last seven
Friday games in a row. Stanford last
won on a Friday on Feb. 26, when it
beat USC 13-4. So it could be a positive
omen that the Trojans are also today's
opponent, as Stanford opens its last
homestand of the season at 2:30 p.m.
at Sunken Diamond.
At this point in the season, however,
the losing streak on Fridays doesn't
weigh too heavily on the minds of the
Cardinal. "It's just a coincidence,"
sophomore shortstop Troy Paulsen
said. "I don't think it's going to be
on our mind. . . . We have too many
other things to think about."
Like holding on to second place in
the Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division. Like finishing strong to go

into postseason play on a winning
note. Like trying to find a way back
to Omaha, Neb., to defend Stanford's
national championship at the College
World Series.
The Cardinal, 34-21 overall and 15-
12 in the Six-Pac, is in second place
in the conference, a half-game ahead
of third-place California (36-23, 16-14)
— which has completed its Six-Pac
schedule — and a game-and-a-half
ahead of the fourth-place Trojans (33-
21, 13-14).
More importantly, with several
regional invitations due to be handed
out on Monday, the Cardinal is ranked
ninth nationally by Baseball America
and 10th by ESPN/Collegiate Baseball.
A good series this weekend could move
Stanford into one of the coveted top
eight positions nationally, giving the
team a chance for a top seeding in a
regional.
The NCAA Regionals will be held
May 25-29 at some sites and May 26-30
at others. Some regional sites and par
ticipants will be selected on Monday,
following a conference call by the
NCAA Baseball Committee, of which
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess is a
member. With conference tourna
ments and make-up games still to be
played the week of May 16, the entire

tournament field and eight sites will

"I think we're going to go to a
regional no matter what we do this
weekend," junior third baseman Ed
Sprague said. "But hopefully, we can
move up to the top eight — that would
give us a No. 1 seeding in a regional
and we wouldn't have to play any of
the other top seeds."
To put itself in that position, the
Cardinal probably needs a sweep, and
that means winning today, on a Fri
day.
"We've got to take the first one for
sure, to get some momentum going
into the weekend," Paulsen said.
"Taking two out of three is a must."
Two wins this weekend would give

the Cardinal sole possession of second
place in the Six-Pac, and would prob
ably mean Stanford would be safe from
Western regionals. Although regional
sites haven't been selected yet, it's
likely that Arizona State — which has
clinched the Six-Pac title and has been
ranked in the top three nationally
most of the season — and Fresno State
— which also has been among the top
three teams most of the year — will
be awarded Western regionals.
Stanford lost twice in Fresno this
season, and has traditionally struggled
in the state of Arizona, so the team
would probably like to find a route to
the College World Series that bypasses
those two places.
Unfortunately for the Cardinal, the
Trojans are no pushovers, despite the
fact that Stanford swept them in Los
Angeles earlier this season. "They've
got some live arms . . . and can put
together the big inning," Sprague said.
And Stanford hasn't made anybody
forget about last year's national cham
pionship team. The only thing stranger
than the Cardinal's inability to win
on Fridays is the team's wildly erratic
play. This is a team that all season
has done things in binges: it scores
runs in binges, gives up runs in binges
and makes errors in binges, and it
rarely does any of those things at the
same time.
"We have to play consistently,"
Paulsen said. "We have to put a good
hitting performance together with a
strong pitching performance — it
seems like we're always missing one
or the other."
Stanford has lost six of its last eight
weekend games, and four of its last
six Six-Pac games. After mustering
only five hits in a 4-1 loss to Cal on
Sunday, the Cardinal squared that
total on Tuesday at San Francisco
State, piling up 25 hits in a 23-2
thrashing of the Division II Gators.
The Cardinal simply swings more
freely in the lopsided mid-week games.
"I think you see us playing behind a
lot more on the weekend," Sprague
said. "Seems like we're always playing
behind, fighting for our lives. . . . Guys
have to take a lot more pitches, and
they start to press."
The Cardinal must bring the same
top-to-bottom aggressive hitting to
weekend games as it does to Tuesday
games. "That's the key," Sprague said,
"when you see the seven-eight-nine
guys (in the batting order) leading off
the inning and getting something
going, then you get back to the top
