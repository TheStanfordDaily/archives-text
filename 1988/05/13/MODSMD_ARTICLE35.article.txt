# Track relaxes with last test
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Some of them will rest this
weekend.
Others will be competing to
morrow at Sacramento State —
hoping to exceed their bests and
make qualifying standards.
But these days, everyone on

the Stanford track and field team is thinking
about the Pacific 10 Conference Championship
meet.
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson has been
focusing on the Pac-10 Championships, which
begin May 21 at since the beginning
of the season. Johnson is "very excited (and)
very pleased" about the team's latest effort,
the Big Meet against California April 30, and
is hoping the momentum will continue this
weekend. Stanford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
thinks the outlook for the Pac-10 meet "looks
very good Everyone who has qualified is very
readv"


James Rucker — Datty flto
Junior Andy Papathanassiou qualified for the
Pacific 10 Conference Championships last
month with a shot put of 57 feet, 6-1/6 inches.

Meanwhile, however, for sev
eral Cardinal there is still the
meet at hand. Four freshmen are
among those very close to quali
fying on both the men's and the
women's team.
Chris Rae has been taking the
pace out for his teammates in the
middle distances this season, so
this will be his chance to break
loose. Jason Martin has also been
making tremendous strides in the
3,000-meter steeplechase and
needs to break nine minutes to
become the first Stanford
qualifier in two years in that
event.
In the long jump, Marcus Hick
erson needs to add just one inch
to his leap of 24 feet, 2V2 leap
against Cal to make the Pac-10

standard. On the women's side,
Debbie Malueg needs a few more
inches in the shot put, while soph
omore Wendy Allen will try to
gain an inch and a half in the
high jump.
These athletes are aiming to
join 22 teammates who all qual
ified for the Pac-10 meet at least
three weeks ago. Because so many
have put that barrier behind
them, according to Chisam, train
ing will be "just normal. It's very
lucky because we have so many
people qualified ahead of time."
With everyone that Stanford
has qualified, however, there
could still be more. First of all,
there are a few slots at the Pac-10
meet for those that do not make
their qualifying mark in time, due
to a conference rule that each
team is allowed at least one entry
in each event. Johnson will not
enter athletes if he does not think
they will be competitive, but this

could make the difference for an
athlete who is capable but just
short of the mark.
In addition, the 10,000 meters
and the women's 5,000 do not
have qualifying marks.
The Cardinal has qualified 16
men whose main strength is in
the distance events. Looking at a
potential Pac-10 lineup, Stanford
could double senior Marc Olesen
in the 1,500 meters and the 5,000
meters and race freshman David
Strang in the 800 and 1,500.
Rivals Matt Guisto of Arizona and
Eric Peterson of Oregon will pro
vide the main distance competi
tion, but Stanford will have an
ace in the hole with senior Steve
Schadler.
The women will mount an at
tack at the Pac-lOs that focuses
on quality over quantity, relying
on a core of NCAA All-Americans.
Junior Erica Wheeler improved
her season's best, the school

record and the meet record at the
Jesse Owens Classic last Saturday
and is second on the conference
list behind Washington's Shelly
Sanford. Sophomore Carol Gray
could run anything from the 1,500
to the 10,000, but would be likely
to double on consecutive days in
the 3,000 and the 5,000, her two
specialties.
Junior Patty Purpur and senior
Lisa Bernhagen will be Stanford's
other big guns. Purpur will be
throwing the shot put and the
discus, while Bernhagen will be
high jumping. Bernhagen and
classmate Brian Marshall have
both been resting due to hurt
backs recently in anticipation of
next weekend.
The Cardinal is preparing for
its biggest meet of the year. With
22 Pac-10 competitors and several
more on the way, it will be rested
and ready for whatever comes its
way.
