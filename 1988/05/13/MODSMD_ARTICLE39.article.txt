# Fac Sen toughens rules for distinction

### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
In a move intended to "upgrade and
broaden" the process used to recognize
academic achievement by graduating
seniors, the Faculty Senate yesterday
unanimously approved a measure tough
ening standards for graduating "with
distinction."
The passage of the bill — scheduled
to take effect in the next academic year
— reflects a trend in University aca
demic policy this year toward bolstering
undergraduate academic awards.
The legislation stated that "there
exists some confusion regarding the
meaning of distinction at Stanford." By
approving new standards, the senate in
dicated that the award, which is now
predominantly department-based,
should reflect University wide academic
achievement.
The distinction award is often con
fused with graduating "with honors,"
which is also awarded by individual de
partments, on the basis of high achieve
ment and thesis project work.

Currently, the University has only one
explicit guideline for students graduat
ing "with distinction": their grades must
rank in the top 25 percent of their de
partment. The University then encour
ages the departments to examine a stu
dent's entire academic record before
making a final recommendation to the
Registrar.
The legislation, forwarded by the
Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement and underway since last
November, raises eligibility criteria to
include only those students whose
grades rank in the top 20 percent of
both their major and the University as
a whole.
According to David Wellbery, profes
sor of German studies and comparative
literature and chair of the committee,
the bill serves three purposes:
• To distinguish the poorly under
stood award from graduating 'with
honors';
• To increase the prestige of the
award;
• To establish the award as
University-based.
