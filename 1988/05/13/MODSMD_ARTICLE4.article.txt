# Chace to leave position as vice provost
## 
### John Cuerva 
English Prof. William Chace
will step down from his position
as vice provost for Academic Plan
ning and Development and will
be succeeded by History Prof.
John Wirth, University Provost
James Rosse announced at yes
terday's Faculty Senate meeting.
Chace said he will leave the post
in June to go on sabbatical for a
year. While remaining in Palo
Alto, he will research authors
James Joyce and Mary McCarthy.
Chace originally accepted the
job in 1985 with the understand
ing that he would step down in
three years, when the position

was to be dis
solved.
Though Chace
has fulfilled his
commitment, the
innovative office
has proved so
successful that
the position will
continue, accord
ing to Rosse.

Rosse established the post to
decrease the workload placed on
the Provost's Office by the Cen
tennial Campaign. The Office of
Academic Planning and Develop
ment is a special branch of the
Provost's Office, with a primary
goal of representing faculty inter

ests in the planning of the Cen
tenial Campaign.
Chace's office links faculty in
terests and the Office of Develop
ment, which is responsible for the
campaign. The office works to
tailor academic goals with avail
able funding. As a part of this
process, Chace helped set the
priorities and goals of the Cen
tennial Campaign.
One special project Chace led
was direct faculty involvement in
the Centennial Campaign. Fac
ulty members attended three sep
arate fundraising events at
Seattle, San Francisco and New
York, teaching for a day in pairs

and helping to facilitate the suc
cess of the events.
The provost chose Wirth after
an intensive search among Stan
ford faculty. At the senate meet
ing, Rosse said Wirth would be
"an enthusiastic warrior of Stan
ford's interests."
Wirth said Chace has done an
"excellent" job creating harmony
between the Office of Develop
ment and the faculty.
Wirth said he was excited about
the position, as it would offer him
a "chance to range over how this
whole marvelous University is put
together."
