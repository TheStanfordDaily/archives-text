An article in yesterday's Daily
on the lawsuit of Stanford com
puter scientist Clifford Johnson
incorrectly defined the grounds
for legal challenge of a plaintiffs
"standing," which Johnson may
encounter in court. In this case,
standing refers to an individual's
right to sue the government
before actual damage has been in
curred.
Also, the headline for an article
on the "graduation pledge for en
vironmental and social aware
ness" was inaccurate. The pledge
was misidentified as the "senior
pledge," which is a fund-raising
drive sponsored by the Alumni
Association.
