## City debates whether to bat for the Giants 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Although the East Palo Alto
Stadium Task Force altered its
name and is now investigating the
possibility of developing an indus
trial park to accompany a new
stadium, the strength of commu
nity support behind becoming the
home for the San Francisco
Giants is still in question.
Such uncertainty could place a
barrier in the path of uniting the
Giants with the young city â€”
which is plagued by bankruptcy,
a dwindling police force and drug
problems. The baseball team is
looking for a new home after its
Candlestick Park lease expires in
1994.
The area under scrutiny is the
Ravenswood Industrial Park, a
140-acre Bayside plot at the end
of Bay Road. A stadium built at
Ravenswood would be about five
miles from the Stanford campus.
According to Myrtle Walker,
chair of the renamed Ravenswood
Industrial Park Master Plan Task
Force, more people are beginning
to see the possibility of a stadium.
She said the popularity of the
stadium has grown as the com
munity realizes that planners are
not working "just for a Giants
stadium."
She added that the task force
has made great strides in its in
vestigation of the possible land
uses on the site, including a hotel,
a marina and a shopping center.
The research body has "gone
through a wealth of material," she
said, as it looks at how develop-

ments could affect transportation,
land use, finance, relocation and
engineering.
However, task force member
Dennis Scherzer is skeptical of
Walker's predictions. He said the
Giants will not want to come to
the city because "the public (of
East Palo Alto) is against it like
you wouldn't believe."
As evidence of community dis
satisfaction with the stadium,
Scherzer has gathered together an
"ad-hoc" East Palo Alto Citizen's
Stadium Task Force made of five
community representatives who
do not want the stadium in their
city.
He said this second task force
will recommend that the stadium
be built in the San Mateo County
Fair Grounds.
The group will make a presen
tation to the East Palo Alto city
council Wednesday night but
"won't press them any harder
than to hear some good state
ments" why East Palo Alto should
vie for the baseball team, Scherzer
said.
East Palo Alto Mayor John Bos
tic, who is also a member of the
newly elected city council, said the
five-member council "is not
leaning one way or another" in
its support of a stadium. He said
the governing body is new, and
its members have not yet voiced
support or opposition.
