Pacific Management Systems is an independent con
sulting group specializing in helping organizations
manage racial, gender, and cultural differences.
We have been contracted by the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues (UCMI) of Stanford University to
assess students' opinions on a number of multi-racial
and multi-cultural issues.
We are looking for students who are willing to parti
cipate in individual, confidential interviews. These inter
views will last approximately one hour, and involve
sharing in an unintrusive manner your academic and
social experiences at Stanford with peers, faculty, and
staff.
The interviews will take place Monday through Friday,
May 16 to May 27. All interviews will take place on
campus. If you are interested, please call 725-0989.
Pacific Management Systems consultants will be avail
able on campus at a table in White Plaza between 11:30
am â€” 1:30 pm on Monday, May 16 and Tuesday, May 17
to answer any questions you might have.
