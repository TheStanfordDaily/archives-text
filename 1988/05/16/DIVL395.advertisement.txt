ANNOUNCING A NEW HONORS
PROGRAM IN EDUCATION
The Stanford School of Education (SUSE) announces the
inception of an honors program that will enable qualified
undergraduates to engage in educational research. Each
student's work in Education, and expecially the honors
theses, will build upon work done in the undergraduate major
department. (An average grade in the major field of B + is
required for entry.) Thus, for example, a philosophy major will
work with one of the School's philosophers of education, and
a psychology major will work with an educational psychologist.
Most undergraduate majors can be catered for.
This is an innovative program, unique in the country.
Further information, and application forms, are available in
the Education Office, in the School of Education; or contact
Professor D.C. Phillips.
Applications for Fall close at noon on Friday, May 27.
