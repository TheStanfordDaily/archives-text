# Stanford stomps in NCAAs — again
## Women's tennis wins 3rd straight national title Sports Monday

LOS ANGELES - It was un
likely that Florida's dynamic duo
of Halle Cioffi and Shaun Stafford
would both lose in the same day.
And it was even more improbable
that Stanford's Teri Whitlinger
and Eleni Rossides, who had
never played together, could win
their doubles match with ease.
But the two-time defending
champion Cardinal seems to do
as it pleases at the NCAA tour
nament, and yesterday's national
championship match was no ex
ception.
With a 5-2 victory over top
seeded Florida yesterday at
UCLA's Los Angeles Tennis Cen
ter, the Cardinal put itself in the
history books, becoming the first

collegiate women's tennis team
ever to win three straight national
titles.
Stanford, the tournament's No.
2 seed, finished the season 27-2.
Florida, the No. 1 seed for the
second straight year, ended 29-2.
The Cardinal won four of the
six singles contests yesterday, and
then clinched the match when
Whitlinger and Rossides prevailed
6-0, 6-4 at No. 2 doubles.
"Total shock," said Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan, when
asked after the match how he felt.
"If somebody would have said
we'll give you two wins and you'll
lose in the semifinals I would have
taken it."
"Nobody expected us to win,"
said Rossides, who won each of
her four singles matches in the
team tournament. "It's just so

satisfying because no one thought
we would do it."
The reason that nobody
thought the Cardinal could win
was the absence of freshman
Tami Whitlinger, the team's No.
1 singles player. Whitlinger ac
companied the team to Los An
geles but was not able to play
because of a pulled groin muscle.
In addition, Rossides, at one
point this year the nation's top
ranked individual player, was re
turning from a three-month
absence and played down at the
No. 5 singles position.
So the Cardinal's one-two
punch had to be replaced by soph
omore Lisa Green at No. 1 and
freshman Teri Whitlinger at No.
