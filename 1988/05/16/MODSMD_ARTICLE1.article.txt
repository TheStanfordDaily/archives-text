# Stanford stomps in NCAAs — again
## Women's tennis wins 3rd straight national title Sports Monday 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES - It was un
likely that Florida's dynamic duo
of Halle Cioffi and Shaun Stafford
would both lose in the same day.
And it was even more improbable
that Stanford's Teri Whitlinger
and Eleni Rossides, who had
never played together, could win
their doubles match with ease.
But the two-time defending
champion Cardinal seems to do
as it pleases at the NCAA tour
nament, and yesterday's national
championship match was no ex
ception.
With a 5-2 victory over top
seeded Florida yesterday at
UCLA's Los Angeles Tennis Cen
ter, the Cardinal put itself in the
history books, becoming the first

collegiate women's tennis team
ever to win three straight national
titles.
Stanford, the tournament's No.
2 seed, finished the season 27-2.
Florida, the No. 1 seed for the
second straight year, ended 29-2.
The Cardinal won four of the
six singles contests yesterday, and
then clinched the match when
Whitlinger and Rossides prevailed
6-0, 6-4 at No. 2 doubles.
"Total shock," said Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan, when
asked after the match how he felt.
"If somebody would have said
we'll give you two wins and you'll
lose in the semifinals I would have
taken it."
"Nobody expected us to win,"
said Rossides, who won each of
her four singles matches in the
team tournament. "It's just so

satisfying because no one thought
we would do it."
The reason that nobody
thought the Cardinal could win
was the absence of freshman
Tami Whitlinger, the team's No.
1 singles player. Whitlinger ac
companied the team to Los An
geles but was not able to play
because of a pulled groin muscle.
In addition, Rossides, at one
point this year the nation's top
ranked individual player, was re
turning from a three-month
absence and played down at the
No. 5 singles position.
So the Cardinal's one-two
punch had to be replaced by soph
omore Lisa Green at No. 1 and
freshman Teri Whitlinger at No.

days (during Stanford's 5-1 and
5-3 victories over Duke and Geor
gia) and Green lost Saturday (as
the Cardinal beat third-seeded
USC 5-1).
On the heels of those matches,
Green and Whitlinger were con
fronted yesterday with Florida's
Cioffi and Stafford, the nation's
No. 1 and No. 6 singles players,
respectively. "I think they really
were [expecting to win the top
two matches]," Green said.
But Green and Whitlinger
stunned the Gators' prolific pair.
Whitlinger was a 6-4, 6-2 victor
over Stafford, who had just one
prior dual-match loss. "She's just
a thoroughbred," Brennan said of
Whitlinger. "It was just a matter
of time before she got going."
The heavy-hitting Stafford was
victimized by errant
groundstrokes against the more
consistent Whitlinger. "(Stafford)
tried to hit winner after winner
after winner, and you just can't
do that," Florida Coach Andy
Brandi said.
"I played really dumb," Stafford
said. "I never changed things up."
When the two teams had met

Stanford 5, Florida 2
Lisa Green (S) defeats Halle Cioffi 6-4, 6-2.
Terl Whitlinger (S) defeats Shaun Stafford 6-4, 6-2.
Nicole Arendt (F) defeats Sandra Birch 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
Kay Tittle (S) defeats Denise Dayan 6-0, 7-6 (7-3).
Eleni Rossides (S) defeats Holly Danforth 6-2, 6-3.
Siobhan Nicholson (F) defeats Cindy Buchsbaum 6-1,
6-2.
Rossides and Whitlinger defeat Danforth and Stafford
6-0, 6-4.

earlier in the season (a 5-4 Florida
victory), Stafford had blasted
Green in the No. 2 singles. Green
was able to avoid a rematch, as
she had to move up to No. 1
singles with Tami Whitlinger in
jured.
Of course, one can't say Green
was ducking from playing a tough
opponent. By avoiding Stafford,
Green had to play the country's
top player. But Cioffi struggled,
and Green was playing some of
her best tennis of the year. The

result was a 6-4, 6-2 victory for
Green.
"Lisa Green, I think, is the most
underrated player in the coun
try," Brennan said. "She just wins
and wins and wins."
Cioffi said that she, like her
teammates, was too tentative.
"We didn't play to win," the Gator
freshman said. "Our whole team
[was] just a little tentative."
"We were playing not to lose,
and they were playing to win,"
said Stafford.

The Cardinal's other two
singles victories yesterday came
from perennial NCAA tourna
ment standouts Rossides and Kay
Tittle. Rossides, now 8-0 in NCAA
tournament dual matches over
the last two seasons, bested
Florida's Holly Danforth 6-2, 6-3
in the No. 5 singles.
"Eleni Rossides at five is a hell
of a tennis player," said Brennan.
On court four, Tittle blasted the
Gators' Denise Dayan in the first
set and then held on for a 6-0,
7-6 (7-3) victory.
Florida stayed in the match
with singles wins from Nicole
Arendt and Siobhan Nicholson.
Cardinal junior Cindy Buchsbaum
had won each of her three previ
ous matches in the tournament,
but Nicholson was too much for
her yesterday, winning 6-1, 6-2
in the No. 6 singles.
Meanwhile, Arendt won a nail
biting first set and then finished
off Stanford freshman Sandra
Birch 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in the No. 3
singles to send the match to dou
bles.
Brandi and his players said they
were still confident heading into
the doubles, but Brennan thought
the Gators "looked a little devas
tated" after the singles.
If the Gators weren't devas
tated prior to the doubles, they
certainly were as the action un
folded.
Florida figured to have the edge
in the No. 2 doubles. Rossides
and Teri Whitlinger had never
even practiced together, and in
fact they weren't slated to play
together yesterday. Whitlinger
was scheduled to play with
Buchsbaum, but Brennan in
formed his players of the change
just minutes before the doubles
started.
"I just could not sit on the
sideline," Rossides said. "I said,
Frank, please put me in."
"It's just one of those things,"
Brennan said. "You trust your gut
and go for it."
Brennan's faith paid off, as
Whitlinger and Rossides won the
first seven games of their match
against Stafford and Danforth, all
along playing like an experienced
team. "It felt a lot like playing
with my sister (Tami, her regular
doubles partner)," said Whit
linger. "Our two games just
meshed."
While Whitlinger and Rossides
were cruising in the No. 2 doubles,
their teammates were doing
likewise on the first and third
courts. Birch and senior Cari
Hagey won the first set of the
No. 1 doubles 6-1 and Tittle and
Green captured the first set of
the No. 3 doubles 6-2.
The only thing that remained
to be seen was which doubles
team would clinch the champion

ship. Whitlinger and Rossides did
the honors, leaping into each
other's arms after the final point.
Their teammates stormed onto
court two to join in the fun, which
included dancing to the tune of
"All Right Now."
Afterward, Brennan took a look
at the rectangular championship
trophy and said, "I love to take
these big chunks of wood home
every year."
A disappointed Brandi had
nothing but praise for the Cardi
nal. "Stanford won it and they
deserved to win it,"he said. "They
were tremendous in this tourna
ment, and they dealt so well with
adversity. He (Brennan) did a
marvelous coaching job."

Five Stanford players will be
aiming to give the Cardinal its
fourth consecutive NCAA singles
champion this week at the Los
Angeles Tennis Center. Singles
competition began today at 8 a.m.,
followed by the second round of
singles and the first round of dou
bles.
Linda Gates won in 1985, and
Patty Fendick captured the
singles title in 1986 and '87.
Lisa Green, a semifinalist last
year as a freshman, opens today

against TCU's Tory Plunkett. If
Green can win her two matches
today, she will likely draw USC's
Trisha Laux, the No. 2 seed, in
the third round tomorrow.
Freshman Teri Whitlinger, who
has a victory over Laux this
season, plays Duke's Susan Sabo
in the first round. Sabo defeated
Whitlinger 6-2, 6-3 in the team
tournament Thursday, but Whit
linger is confident about her
chances in the singles draw.
"I'm feeling good right now,"
she said. "After the team (cham
pionship), the individuals is just
something extra to go for. Of
course, the ultimate goal is to win
it. I think I can do it."
Other first-round matches in
cluding Stanford players are:
junior Eleni Rossides vs. Duke's
Patti O'Reilly; senior Kay Tittle
vs. Notre Dame's Cece Cahill; and
freshman Sandra Birch vs.
UCLA's Joni Urban.
Tami Whitlinger, the nation's
No. 5 singles player, qualified for
the tournament but will not play
because of a groin injury.
Stanford has one doubles team
in the tournament. Birch and
senior Cari Hagey, the No. 5
seeds, open today against the
Brigham Young team of Fulford
and Lee.

on its 5-2 NCAA Championship victory over Florida. A semifinalist in the NCAA Individual Champi

Trisha Laux, the No. 2 seed, in
the third round tomorrow.
Freshman Teri Whitlinger, who
has a victory over Laux this
season, plays Duke's Susan Sabo
in the first round. Sabo defeated
Whitlinger 6-2, 6-3 in the team
tournament Thursday, but Whit
linger is confident about her
chances in the singles draw.
"I'm feeling good right now,"
she said. "After the team (cham
pionship), the individuals is just
something extra to go for. Of
course, the ultimate goal is to win
it. I think I can do it."
Other first-round matches in
cluding Stanford players are:
junior Eleni Rossides vs. Duke's
Patti O'Reilly; senior Kay Tittle
vs. Notre Dame's Cece Cahill; and
freshman Sandra Birch vs.
UCLA's Joni Urban.
Tami Whitlinger, the nation's
No. 5 singles player, qualified for
the tournament but will not play
because of a groin injury.
Stanford has one doubles team
in the tournament. Birch and
senior Cari Hagey, the No. 5
seeds, open today against the
Brigham Young team of Fulford

Tennis followers are growing accustomed to seeing Stanford freshman Lisa Green and NCAA in the
same picture. Green defeated the nation's top-ranked player Halle Cioffi 6-4, 6-2 to spark Stanford
on its 5-2 NCAA Championship victory over Florida. A semifinalist in the NCAA Individual Champi
onships last year, Green opens this year's competition today against Texas Christian's Tory Plunkett.

Stanford junior Eleni Rossides (left) high-fives freshman Teri Whit
linger on their way to a 6-4, 6-0 win at No. 2 doubles, clinching
the national title for the Cardinal. Rossides and Whitlinger had
never teamed up as doubles partners ever before — even in practice.
LOS ANGELES - It was un
likely that Florida's dynamic duo
of Halle Cioffi and Shaun Stafford
would both lose in the same day.
And it was even more improbable
that Stanford's Teri Whitlinger
and Eleni Rossides, who had
never played together, could win
their doubles match with ease.
But the two-time defending
champion Cardinal seems to do
as it pleases at the NCAA tour
nament, and yesterday's national
championship match was no ex
ception.
With a 5-2 victory over top
seeded Florida yesterday at
UCLA's Los Angeles Tennis Cen
ter, the Cardinal put itself in the
history books, becoming the first

collegiate women's tennis team
ever to win three straight national
titles.
Stanford, the tournament's No.
2 seed, finished the season 27-2.
Florida, the No. 1 seed for the
second straight year, ended 29-2.
The Cardinal won four of the
six singles contests yesterday, and
then clinched the match when
Whitlinger and Rossides prevailed
6-0, 6-4 at No. 2 doubles.
"Total shock," said Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan, when
asked after the match how he felt.
"If somebody would have said
we'll give you two wins and you'll
lose in the semifinals I would have
taken it."
"Nobody expected us to win,"
said Rossides, who won each of
her four singles matches in the
team tournament. "It's just so

satisfying because no one thought
we would do it."
The reason that nobody
thought the Cardinal could win
was the absence of freshman
Tami Whitlinger, the team's No.
1 singles player. Whitlinger ac
companied the team to Los An
geles but was not able to play
because of a pulled groin muscle.
In addition, Rossides, at one
point this year the nation's top
ranked individual player, was re
turning from a three-month
absence and played down at the
No. 5 singles position.
So the Cardinal's one-two
punch had to be replaced by soph
omore Lisa Green at No. 1 and
freshman Teri Whitlinger at No.

days (during Stanford's 5-1 and
5-3 victories over Duke and Geor
gia) and Green lost Saturday (as
the Cardinal beat third-seeded
USC 5-1).
On the heels of those matches,
Green and Whitlinger were con
fronted yesterday with Florida's
Cioffi and Stafford, the nation's
No. 1 and No. 6 singles players,
respectively. "I think they really
were [expecting to win the top
two matches]," Green said.
But Green and Whitlinger
stunned the Gators' prolific pair.
Whitlinger was a 6-4, 6-2 victor
over Stafford, who had just one
prior dual-match loss. "She's just
a thoroughbred," Brennan said of
Whitlinger. "It was just a matter
of time before she got going."
The heavy-hitting Stafford was
victimized by errant
groundstrokes against the more
consistent Whitlinger. "(Stafford)
tried to hit winner after winner
after winner, and you just can't
do that," Florida Coach Andy
Brandi said.
"I played really dumb," Stafford
said. "I never changed things up."
When the two teams had met

Stanford 5, Florida 2
Lisa Green (S) defeats Halle Cioffi 6-4, 6-2.
Terl Whitlinger (S) defeats Shaun Stafford 6-4, 6-2.
Nicole Arendt (F) defeats Sandra Birch 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
Kay Tittle (S) defeats Denise Dayan 6-0, 7-6 (7-3).
Eleni Rossides (S) defeats Holly Danforth 6-2, 6-3.
Siobhan Nicholson (F) defeats Cindy Buchsbaum 6-1,
6-2.
Rossides and Whitlinger defeat Danforth and Stafford
6-0, 6-4.

earlier in the season (a 5-4 Florida
victory), Stafford had blasted
Green in the No. 2 singles. Green
was able to avoid a rematch, as
she had to move up to No. 1
singles with Tami Whitlinger in
jured.
Of course, one can't say Green
was ducking from playing a tough
opponent. By avoiding Stafford,
Green had to play the country's
top player. But Cioffi struggled,
and Green was playing some of
her best tennis of the year. The

result was a 6-4, 6-2 victory for
Green.
"Lisa Green, I think, is the most
underrated player in the coun
try," Brennan said. "She just wins
and wins and wins."
Cioffi said that she, like her
teammates, was too tentative.
"We didn't play to win," the Gator
freshman said. "Our whole team
[was] just a little tentative."
"We were playing not to lose,
and they were playing to win,"
said Stafford.

The Cardinal's other two
singles victories yesterday came
from perennial NCAA tourna
ment standouts Rossides and Kay
Tittle. Rossides, now 8-0 in NCAA
tournament dual matches over
the last two seasons, bested
Florida's Holly Danforth 6-2, 6-3
in the No. 5 singles.
"Eleni Rossides at five is a hell
of a tennis player," said Brennan.
On court four, Tittle blasted the
Gators' Denise Dayan in the first
set and then held on for a 6-0,
7-6 (7-3) victory.
Florida stayed in the match
with singles wins from Nicole
Arendt and Siobhan Nicholson.
Cardinal junior Cindy Buchsbaum
had won each of her three previ
ous matches in the tournament,
but Nicholson was too much for
her yesterday, winning 6-1, 6-2
in the No. 6 singles.
Meanwhile, Arendt won a nail
biting first set and then finished
off Stanford freshman Sandra
Birch 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in the No. 3
singles to send the match to dou
bles.
Brandi and his players said they
were still confident heading into
the doubles, but Brennan thought
the Gators "looked a little devas
tated" after the singles.
If the Gators weren't devas
tated prior to the doubles, they
certainly were as the action un
folded.
Florida figured to have the edge
in the No. 2 doubles. Rossides
and Teri Whitlinger had never
even practiced together, and in
fact they weren't slated to play
together yesterday. Whitlinger
was scheduled to play with
Buchsbaum, but Brennan in
formed his players of the change
just minutes before the doubles
started.
"I just could not sit on the
sideline," Rossides said. "I said,
Frank, please put me in."
"It's just one of those things,"
Brennan said. "You trust your gut
and go for it."
Brennan's faith paid off, as
Whitlinger and Rossides won the
first seven games of their match
against Stafford and Danforth, all
along playing like an experienced
team. "It felt a lot like playing
with my sister (Tami, her regular
doubles partner)," said Whit
linger. "Our two games just
meshed."
While Whitlinger and Rossides
were cruising in the No. 2 doubles,
their teammates were doing
likewise on the first and third
courts. Birch and senior Cari
Hagey won the first set of the
No. 1 doubles 6-1 and Tittle and
Green captured the first set of
the No. 3 doubles 6-2.
The only thing that remained
to be seen was which doubles
team would clinch the champion

ship. Whitlinger and Rossides did
the honors, leaping into each
other's arms after the final point.
Their teammates stormed onto
court two to join in the fun, which
included dancing to the tune of
"All Right Now."
Afterward, Brennan took a look
at the rectangular championship
trophy and said, "I love to take
these big chunks of wood home
every year."
A disappointed Brandi had
nothing but praise for the Cardi
nal. "Stanford won it and they
deserved to win it,"he said. "They
were tremendous in this tourna
ment, and they dealt so well with
adversity. He (Brennan) did a
marvelous coaching job."

Five Stanford players will be
aiming to give the Cardinal its
fourth consecutive NCAA singles
champion this week at the Los
Angeles Tennis Center. Singles
competition began today at 8 a.m.,
followed by the second round of
singles and the first round of dou
bles.
Linda Gates won in 1985, and
Patty Fendick captured the

with my sister (Tami, her regular
doubles partner)," said Whit
linger. "Our two games just
meshed."
While Whitlinger and Rossides
were cruising in the No. 2 doubles,
their teammates were doing
likewise on the first and third
courts. Birch and senior Cari
Hagey won the first set of the
No. 1 doubles 6-1 and Tittle and
Green captured the first set of
the No. 3 doubles 6-2.
The only thing that remained
to be seen was which doubles
team would clinch the champion

ship. Whitlinger and Rossides did
the honors, leaping into each
other's arms after the final point.
Their teammates stormed onto
court two to join in the fun, which
included dancing to the tune of
"All Right Now."
Afterward, Brennan took a look
at the rectangular championship
trophy and said, "I love to take
these big chunks of wood home
every year."
A disappointed Brandi had
nothing but praise for the Cardi
nal. "Stanford won it and they
deserved to win it,"he said. "They
were tremendous in this tourna
ment, and they dealt so well with
adversity. He (Brennan) did a
marvelous coaching job."

Five Stanford players will be
aiming to give the Cardinal its
fourth consecutive NCAA singles
champion this week at the Los
Angeles Tennis Center. Singles
competition began today at 8 a.m.,
followed by the second round of
singles and the first round of dou
bles.
Linda Gates won in 1985, and
Patty Fendick captured the
singles title in 1986 and '87.
Lisa Green, a semifinalist last
year as a freshman, opens today

against TCU's Tory Plunkett. If
Green can win her two matches
today, she will likely draw USC's
Trisha Laux, the No. 2 seed, in
the third round tomorrow.
Freshman Teri Whitlinger, who
has a victory over Laux this
season, plays Duke's Susan Sabo
in the first round. Sabo defeated
Whitlinger 6-2, 6-3 in the team
tournament Thursday, but Whit
linger is confident about her
chances in the singles draw.
"I'm feeling good right now,"
she said. "After the team (cham
pionship), the individuals is just
something extra to go for. Of
course, the ultimate goal is to win
it. I think I can do it."
Other first-round matches in
cluding Stanford players are:
junior Eleni Rossides vs. Duke's
Patti O'Reilly; senior Kay Tittle
vs. Notre Dame's Cece Cahill; and
freshman Sandra Birch vs.
UCLA's Joni Urban.
Tami Whitlinger, the nation's
No. 5 singles player, qualified for
the tournament but will not play
because of a groin injury.
Stanford has one doubles team
in the tournament. Birch and
senior Cari Hagey, the No. 5
seeds, open today against the
Brigham Young team of Fulford
and Lee.

Tennis followers are growing accustomed to seeing Stanford freshman Lisa Green and NCAA in the
same picture. Green defeated the nation's top-ranked player Halle Cioffi 6-4, 6-2 to spark Stanford
on its 5-2 NCAA Championship victory over Florida. A semifinalist in the NCAA Individual Champi
onships last year, Green opens this year's competition today against Texas Christian's Tory Plunkett.

Stanford junior Eleni Rossides (left) high-fives freshman Teri Whit
linger on their way to a 6-4, 6-0 win at No. 2 doubles, clinching
the national title for the Cardinal. Rossides and Whitlinger had
never teamed up as doubles partners ever before — even in practice.
LOS ANGELES - It was un
likely that Florida's dynamic duo
of Halle Cioffi and Shaun Stafford
would both lose in the same day.
And it was even more improbable
that Stanford's Teri Whitlinger
and Eleni Rossides, who had
never played together, could win
their doubles match with ease.
But the two-time defending
champion Cardinal seems to do
as it pleases at the NCAA tour
nament, and yesterday's national
championship match was no ex
ception.
With a 5-2 victory over top
seeded Florida yesterday at
UCLA's Los Angeles Tennis Cen
ter, the Cardinal put itself in the
history books, becoming the first

collegiate women's tennis team
ever to win three straight national
titles.
Stanford, the tournament's No.
2 seed, finished the season 27-2.
Florida, the No. 1 seed for the
second straight year, ended 29-2.
The Cardinal won four of the
six singles contests yesterday, and
then clinched the match when
Whitlinger and Rossides prevailed
6-0, 6-4 at No. 2 doubles.
"Total shock," said Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan, when
asked after the match how he felt.
"If somebody would have said
we'll give you two wins and you'll
lose in the semifinals I would have
taken it."
"Nobody expected us to win,"
said Rossides, who won each of
her four singles matches in the
team tournament. "It's just so

satisfying because no one thought
we would do it."
The reason that nobody
thought the Cardinal could win
was the absence of freshman
Tami Whitlinger, the team's No.
1 singles player. Whitlinger ac
companied the team to Los An
geles but was not able to play
because of a pulled groin muscle.
In addition, Rossides, at one
point this year the nation's top
ranked individual player, was re
turning from a three-month
absence and played down at the
No. 5 singles position.
So the Cardinal's one-two
punch had to be replaced by soph
omore Lisa Green at No. 1 and
freshman Teri Whitlinger at No.

days (during Stanford's 5-1 and
5-3 victories over Duke and Geor
gia) and Green lost Saturday (as
the Cardinal beat third-seeded
USC 5-1).
On the heels of those matches,
Green and Whitlinger were con
fronted yesterday with Florida's
Cioffi and Stafford, the nation's
No. 1 and No. 6 singles players,
respectively. "I think they really
were [expecting to win the top
two matches]," Green said.
But Green and Whitlinger
stunned the Gators' prolific pair.
Whitlinger was a 6-4, 6-2 victor
over Stafford, who had just one
prior dual-match loss. "She's just
a thoroughbred," Brennan said of
Whitlinger. "It was just a matter
of time before she got going."
The heavy-hitting Stafford was
victimized by errant
groundstrokes against the more
consistent Whitlinger. "(Stafford)
tried to hit winner after winner
after winner, and you just can't
do that," Florida Coach Andy
Brandi said.
"I played really dumb," Stafford
said. "I never changed things up."
When the two teams had met

Stanford 5, Florida 2
Lisa Green (S) defeats Halle Cioffi 6-4, 6-2.
Terl Whitlinger (S) defeats Shaun Stafford 6-4, 6-2.
Nicole Arendt (F) defeats Sandra Birch 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.
Kay Tittle (S) defeats Denise Dayan 6-0, 7-6 (7-3).
Eleni Rossides (S) defeats Holly Danforth 6-2, 6-3.
Siobhan Nicholson (F) defeats Cindy Buchsbaum 6-1,
6-2.
Rossides and Whitlinger defeat Danforth and Stafford
6-0, 6-4.

earlier in the season (a 5-4 Florida
victory), Stafford had blasted
Green in the No. 2 singles. Green
was able to avoid a rematch, as
she had to move up to No. 1
singles with Tami Whitlinger in
jured.
Of course, one can't say Green
was ducking from playing a tough
opponent. By avoiding Stafford,
Green had to play the country's
top player. But Cioffi struggled,
and Green was playing some of
her best tennis of the year. The

result was a 6-4, 6-2 victory for
Green.
"Lisa Green, I think, is the most
underrated player in the coun
try," Brennan said. "She just wins
and wins and wins."
Cioffi said that she, like her
teammates, was too tentative.
"We didn't play to win," the Gator
freshman said. "Our whole team
[was] just a little tentative."
"We were playing not to lose,
and they were playing to win,"
said Stafford.

The Cardinal's other two
singles victories yesterday came
from perennial NCAA tourna
ment standouts Rossides and Kay
Tittle. Rossides, now 8-0 in NCAA
tournament dual matches over
the last two seasons, bested
Florida's Holly Danforth 6-2, 6-3
in the No. 5 singles.
"Eleni Rossides at five is a hell
of a tennis player," said Brennan.
On court four, Tittle blasted the
Gators' Denise Dayan in the first
set and then held on for a 6-0,
7-6 (7-3) victory.
Florida stayed in the match
with singles wins from Nicole
Arendt and Siobhan Nicholson.
Cardinal junior Cindy Buchsbaum
had won each of her three previ
ous matches in the tournament,
but Nicholson was too much for
her yesterday, winning 6-1, 6-2
in the No. 6 singles.
Meanwhile, Arendt won a nail
biting first set and then finished
off Stanford freshman Sandra
Birch 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 in the No. 3
singles to send the match to dou
bles.
Brandi and his players said they
were still confident heading into
the doubles, but Brennan thought
the Gators "looked a little devas
tated" after the singles.
If the Gators weren't devas
tated prior to the doubles, they
certainly were as the action un
folded.
Florida figured to have the edge
in the No. 2 doubles. Rossides
and Teri Whitlinger had never
even practiced together, and in
fact they weren't slated to play
together yesterday. Whitlinger
was scheduled to play with
Buchsbaum, but Brennan in
formed his players of the change
just minutes before the doubles
started.
"I just could not sit on the
sideline," Rossides said. "I said,
Frank, please put me in."
"It's just one of those things,"
Brennan said. "You trust your gut
and go for it."
Brennan's faith paid off, as
Whitlinger and Rossides won the
first seven games of their match
against Stafford and Danforth, all
along playing like an experienced
team. "It felt a lot like playing
with my sister (Tami, her regular
doubles partner)," said Whit
linger. "Our two games just
meshed."
While Whitlinger and Rossides
were cruising in the No. 2 doubles,
their teammates were doing
likewise on the first and third
courts. Birch and senior Cari
Hagey won the first set of the
No. 1 doubles 6-1 and Tittle and
Green captured the first set of
the No. 3 doubles 6-2.
