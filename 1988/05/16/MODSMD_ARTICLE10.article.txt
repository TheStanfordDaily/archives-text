# Stanford researcher moves out

### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Citing Stanford's high research
overhead costs, the inventor of
the free-electron laser plans to
leave the University this fall to
begin full-time research at Duke
University.
John Madey, a research profes
sor of electrical engineering, said
he will be taking $20 million in
equipment and some of his re
searchers with him to Duke.
Madey said one of the reasons
he decided to leave Stanford was
its high indirect costs. Indirect
costs, also known as research
overhead, include administrative
costs, capital depreciation, libra
ries, student services and opera
tions and maintenance.Stanford
currently has one of the highest
indirect cost levels in the nation,
second only to Columbia.
Since 1983, Madey has received
more that $11 million in grants
— more than any other Stanford

professor — to work on applica
tions of the free-electron laser,
which is a key component of the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
Dean of the School of Engineer
ing James Gibbons called Madey's
move "a significant loss" for Stan
ford. "He is a very bright and
enthusiastic researcher," Gibbons
said of Madey. "Anytime you lose
someone like that you feel it."
Madey, who invented the free
electron laser as a graduate stu
dent in 1967, said the University
recently told him his overhead
costs would rise to $2 million,
twice what they had been annual
ly-
University officials are still
negotiating the indirect cost issue
with Madey. Madey, however,
gave no indication that he is
reconsidering his decision to
leave.
Gibbons speculated that an
other factor in Madey's decision
to move may have been the fact
that Duke offered him a tenured

position. According to Gibbons,
Stanford is currently unable to
offer Madey a tenured appoint
ment because there are no open
positions.
"The position (at Duke) is al
most ideal for him," Gibbons said.
"He has a tenure appointment,
more space, and he will be a cen
terpiece."
Some University officials spec
ulate that Madey's move may be
prompted by disagreement over
the direction of his research. Ac
cording to Bob Beyers, head of
the University News Service,
Madey would like to explore new
applications for the laser in
medicine, chemistry, phar
maceuticals, electronics, energy
and beam weaponry.
Madey has requested that his
government-provided research
equipment be moved to Duke this
summer. The move, which will
cost about $300,000, will be paid
for by the government.
