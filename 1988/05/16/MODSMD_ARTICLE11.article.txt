Amy Blue, associate vice
president for Administrative
Services and Facilities, died
yesterday after a nearly
year-long fight with brain
cancer. She was 44.
Appointed vice president
only a few weeks before
learning of her disease last
May, Blue continued to work
until the very end. She was
the highest-ranking woman
in the University's non
academic administration.
Blue suffered a seizure
Thursday morning and went
into a coma from which she
never recovered. She had
just returned from a 10-day
trip to France with her hus
band, Jim Smith, her son
Jason Blue-Smith, 10, and
her daughter, Lindsay, 8.
Funeral arrangements
have not yet been made.
