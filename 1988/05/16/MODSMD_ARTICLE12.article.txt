Five killed in Sri Lanka clash
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Two policemen,
two home guards and a girl were killed and
four others were critically ir\jured yesterday
when insurgents from the Marxist People's
Liberation Front stormed the office of Sri
Lanka's ruling United National Party in
Akuressa 80 miles south of here.
Police sources at Matara near Akuressa said
about 30 armed youths of the liberation front
stormed the UNP office of D. Abeywickrema,
one of the ruling party's prominent candidates
for provincial elections, shooting at random
with machine-guns.
There was a gunfight for nearly half an
hour between armed police and home guards
who challenged the attackers. The dead girl
was said to be a relative of the candidate, who
was unhurt. Police said the gunmen escaped,
taking several weapons with them.
It was the first mtyor confrontation between
the liberation front and government forces
since a decree banning the Marxist party was
lifted last Tuesday by President Junius
Jayewardene.
In another incident, at Weligama about 18
miles away, an armed gang — also thought
to be members of the People's Liberation Front
— shot and killed another UNP candidate and
injured two policemen.
Kentucky bus accident kills 27
CARROLLTON, Ky. — A crowded church
bus burst into flames when it was struck
head-on by a pickup truck traveling on the
wrong side of an interstate highway late Sat
urday, killing 27 people, most of them teen
agers.
Distraught parents clutching medical and
dental records made a grim pilgrimage here
Sunday to identify the victims of the fiery
crash, who were heading home from an amuse
ment park.
The collision, one of the worst bus accidents
in U.S. history, injured more than 30 other
persons, many of them burned or suffering
from smoke inhalation. At least eight were
listed in critical condition in area hospitals.
Among those seriously hurt was the driver
of the truck, identified by officials as Larry
Mahoney, 34, of nearby Worthville, Ky., who
was driving north in the southbound lane of
Interstate 71 about 40 miles northeast of
Louisville.
Trooper Glenn Walton, press representative
for the Kentucky State Police, said that it was
not known why Mahoney was driving on the
wrong side of the divided highway. No charges
have been filed, although Mahoney's blood has
been tested for alcohol content, Walton said.
He declined comment on the results of that
test.
The 11-year-old bus, owned by the First
Assembly of God Church in Radcliff, Ky., was
packed with 67 youngsters and adult chap
erones when it was hit. The group was re
turning from a day-long outing at the Kings
Island Amusement Park near Cincinnati.
Radcliff, about 35 miles south of Louisville
and 75 miles from the accident scene, is ad
jacent to Fort Knox. Many of the youngsters
on board were children of military personnel.
