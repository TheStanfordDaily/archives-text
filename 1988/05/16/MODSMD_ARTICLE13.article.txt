# Soviets begin withdrawal from Afghanistan
## 
### 
KABUL, Afghanistan — The Soviet
Red Army, afler failing for more than
eight years to overcome a determined
Afghan rebel force aided by the United
States, began its painful withdrawal
from this mountainous Central Asian
country yesterday.
At 7 a.m., an armored division of
1,000 Soviet troops and 300 vehicles
left its garrison at Jalalabad, 80 miles
east of Kabul. The convoy included
tanks, armored personnel carriers, ar
tillery units, communications and
radar vehicles and supply trucks.
Although Afghan rebel groups based
in Peshawar, Pakistan, had threatened
to disrupt Soviet columns as they
depart, Soviet soldiers and reporters
accompanying the convoy reported no
attacks yesterday. Occasionally, during
the nine-hour journey, the convoy was
escorted by helicopter gunships. Soviet
tank nests flanked the road at regular
intervals.

"It was an easy ride on a good road,"
said Vladimir, 20, riding atop a BTR
-80 armored vehicle. The young soldier,
who asked that his last name not be
used, reported that not all of the troops
in the convoy will go back to the Soviet
Union immediately. He, a native of
Minsk, and his fellow rifleman, Karif,
20, from Baku on the Caspian Sea,
are due to return in five months, he
said.
Asked if he had seen any combat in
the war, he said: "Enough."
Soviet officers told Eastern Euro
pean reporters that the first part of
the convoy would reach the Soviet bor
der by Thursday, traveling north
through the Salang tunnel, then to
the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif
and finally crossing the Amu Darya
River into the Soviet Union at Termez.
The last stage of the same convoy
will not reach the border until May 28.
At a press conference Saturday, Lt.

Gen. Boris Gromov, commander of the
Soviet forces in Afghanistan, said that
the pace of withdrawal will be slowed
somewhat by the country's bad road
conditions after eight years of war.
Nevertheless, he said that one-quarter
of all Soviet troops will be gone by
May 29, the opening day of the summit
meeting between President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
in Moscow.
The lead vehicles in the convoy yes
terday zipped along the highway at a
fast clip, not even stopping for the
men to eat along the way. In fact,
they were early and were forced to
stop about 10 miles outside Kabul so
that 300 foreign journalists could be
there to witness the events.
A U.N. observer team here to mon
itor the withdrawal was 40 minutes
late getting to the site.
As the convoy neared Kabul, it was
greeted by several hundred Afghan sol

diers and militiamen who waved Soviet
flags and threw flowers at the passing
troops. The Soviet troops appeared to
be in good spirits, smiling at the Af
ghan soldiers, a bedraggled bunch in
comparison with the regular Soviet
units.
It did not, however, have the air of
a victory parade. Only a few Afghan
villagers from the mud colonies sur
rounding this capital bothered to come
to the roadside, and only a few of
them waved. But Afghan secret
policemen in civilian clothes drove
alongside the convoy in Soviet
automobiles and shouted greetings in
Russian.
It was clear that the ceremony
honoring the departing Soviet troops
was being conducted by the very men
who will be responsible for protecting
the Afghan regime of President
Ngyibullah after the Soviets leave.
