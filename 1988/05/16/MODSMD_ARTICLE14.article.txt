# Syrian troops to move into southern suburbs of Beirut
## 
### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” A Syrian official
announced yesterday that some 7,000
Syrian troops would move into Beirut's
Shiite southern suburbs for the first time
in a bid to end fierce battles between rival
Shiite Moslem militias and he said they
would shoot any gunmen in sight.
The move was seen as a bid by Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon, to
assert control over the slums on Beirut's
southern edge, an area that has become a
base for the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia
and where at least some of 19 Western
hostages, including nine Americans, were
believed held by factions linked to Hezbol
lah.
The Syrian deployment was ordered after
days of fighting for control of the suburbs
between militant Hezbollah fighters and
their rivals in the more moderate Shiite
Amal movement, which is backed by Syria.

At least 250 people have been killed and
1,000 wounded in the battles in which
Hezbollah took control of the slums from
Amal, which is headed by Lebanon's justice
minister, Nabih Berri.
Fighting was reported for a 10th day
yesterday, in the Chiah quarter, where
Amal militiamen still hold positions. Amal
security officials said the fighters were
trading mortar shells and shoulder-fired
B-7 rockets. One rocket landed in an un
finished building that houses Palestinian
refugees, reportedly killing a mother and
her child and wounding four people.
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, Syria's chief
of military intelligence in Lebanon, told a
press conference at the Beau Rivage Hotel
yesterday afternoon that "Syrian Arab
armed forces have received orders to enter
the southern suburbs."
