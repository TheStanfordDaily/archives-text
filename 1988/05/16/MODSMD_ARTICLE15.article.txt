# Israeli official: sergeant encouraged prisoner beatings

### 
JERUSALEM â€” An Israeli army ser
geant took a group of Jewish teen-a per a
on an unauthorized tour of a temporary
army detention center near the West Bank
town of Ramallah earlier this year during
which he allegedly encouraged the students
to beat Palestinian prisoners, it was
revealed here yesterday.
Yair Tsaban, a member of the Knesset,
Israel's parliament, from the leftist Mapam
party, said in an interview that he had
evidence that one or more of the Jewish
teen-agers did strike prisoners. And he said
he had written to both Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin and Education Minister
Yitzhak Navon yesterday seeking further
inquiry into the incident.
Israeli military sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, confirmed that the
sergeant had been tried and punished for
taking the Jewish youth group into the
detention area but said that an army "in

vestigation did not in any way corroborate
findings of beatings or participation in
beatings." The sources said they considered
the investigation closed.
Master Sgt. Charlie Danino was sen
tenced to four months in the brig and
demoted to private for "negligence and im
proper behavior" in connection with the
burial incident. Two other soldiers had pre
viously received four- and five-month terms
respectively.
According to military sources, the latest
incident occurred between Feb. 7 and Feb.
12 while Jewish students from an official
paramilitary youth group were assigned to
an army camp near Ramallah for an annual
training session.
The youths are members of Gadna, a
national organization in which virtually all
Israeli Jewish high-school students get pre
military training.
