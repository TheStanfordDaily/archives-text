# Jackson blasts Bush
## Cites 'insensitivity' to minority education 
### 
HAMPTON, Va. - The Rev.
Jesse Jackson, who watched as
his mother-in-law received a
college degree yesterday at the
age of 61, used the occasion to
accuse Vice President George
Bush of "gross insensitivity" to
the educational aspirations of
minorities.
Jackson, citing news reports
of remarks Bush made May 5
to Latino high-school students
in East Los Angeles on the
need for blue-collar labor, sug
gested that Bush try his hand
at shining shoes rather than
running for president.
Bush reportedly told stu
dents at Garfield High School
that while education is neces
sary, young people "don't have
to go to college to achieve suc
cess.
"We need those people who
build our buildings, who send
them soaring to the sky," Bush
was quoted as saying. "We need
the people who run the offices,
people who do the hard phys
ical work of our society."
Jackson, whose campaign
speeches include a pledge to
double the federal education
budget, said yesterday that if
he is elected president, he'll
help Bush find just such a job.
"Bush said, in his gross in
sensitivity, to some Hispanic
children a few weeks ago â€”
looking them in their faces:
'College is not necessary for
success. We will still need
people in our society to do
physical work,' " Jackson
noted.
"If I'm successful, that's ex
actly what he will be doing next
year," Jackson told a cheering
crowd of black students and
their families at the Hampton

University commencement
here.
"Let him wait tables. Let him
caddy. Let him shine shoes.
You keep going to college."
Jackson took time out from
his campaign for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination
to attend the graduation and
receive an honorary degree
from Hampton, before flying
to New Jersey for three cam
paign appearances. The New
Jersey and California primaries
are both on June 7.
Among the graduating class
at Hampton University was
Gertrude Davis Brown, the
mother of Jackson's wife, Jac
queline, who received her B.A.
degree yesterday in social work.
Jackson, garbed in cloak and
mortarboard to receive his
honorary degree, embraced his
mother-in-law on stage and de
scribed her as an inspiration
to him to "run against the
odds" as the first major black
presidential candidate.
He said that Brown worked
as a maid in a Veterans Ad
ministration hospital, starting
work each day at 4 a.m., to
raise five children and put four
of them through college.
At the age of 49, she went
back to high school in
Hampton, near the Newport
News naval base, then went on
to college, taking one or two
night courses a year.
He said that she now wants
to earn a master's degree in
social work. Her ambition, he
said, is to open a home for
unwed mothers, "and I'm going
to help her."
