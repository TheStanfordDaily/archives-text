## Keep idealism alive 
### 
JESSE JACKSON, whether
you support his candidacy or
not, merits thoughtful atten
tion.
As a presidential candidate or
sweet-sounding preacher, Jackson
came to Stanford on Saturday with
a true vision of a better America.
That idealism should not fall on
deaf ears.
Voter polls and delegate tallies
show that Jackson is losing the
presidential nomination. But his
victory is that he has brought is
sues in which he believes strongly
to the the nation's attention.
Though his agenda has always
been an inextricable weave of
morality and politics, Jackson now
is rising above the political realm
in an attempt to impact the 1988
election.
His dedication to his ideals
should be a backboard of encour
agement for students preparing to
face the difficulties of the "real
world."
Students graduating with a
Stanford education are equipped
to face the problems of illiteracy,
poverty and interracial oppression
that Jackson enumerated. His
challenge to students — that they
invest in themselves and others,
never relinquishing hope of success
— should be a navigating star for
students of this era.
His idea of collective responsi
bility is an important one, espe
cially at a university so decorated
with academic and social prestige.

Jackson conducted a much-needed
"gut check" yesterday by challeng
ing listeners to work together to
fit America into the global com
munity.
Though Jackson's simple and
eloquent message is not new, it is
enlivened and empowered in lan
guage that should wake up those
whom Jackson describes as prac
titioners of "escapism."
But unfortunately, it is that
moral inflection clothed in lib
eralism that alienates many would
be supporters.
Those who oppose Jackson on
specific issues — perhaps leery of
his support for bilingualism, an in
creased minimum wage or a freeze
on defense spending — cannot help
but share his valiant image of an
America in which everyone has
equal access to education, health
care and comparable Wages.
The driving fuel behind Jack
son's message, that of racial unity,
is a "good" to which all Americans
should aspire. By opposing Jack
son's particular remedies, voters
run the risk of appearing hostile
to an overall ethical agenda.
Jesse Jackson gave his audience
the ends yesterday. Now it is up
to each individual to ask what the
means should be to achieve his
ideals. Jackson's inspirational
speech moved many. Those who
were inspired should turn their
emotions into action for positive
change.
