## Running the race...

THE STARTING GUN fired. A loud
cheer resounded through the over
100,000 assembled. Surrounded by
a sea of colors and costumes, I let out a
little "Oh joy" and gladly noticed that
nobody was moving. For 36 minutes my
luck held out and we did not advance
beyond a brisk walk. But when we passed
the four-story-high, blow-up Spuds
MacKenzie, my Northern California rite
of passage commenced. Twelve
kilometers of San Francisco's Bay to
Breakers lay before me.
It was fitting that Spuds was there to
see me off. Spuds, after all, represents
the American Dream. Only in America
could a mutt with a discolored left eye
rise from the rags of dog obscurity to
the riches of national canine stardom.
Spuds represents a part of each of us.
Aren't we all, in the words of Bill Murray
in "Stripes," just mutts and immigrants
to this Land of Opportunity? Aren't We
all engaged in the constant struggle to
fulfill the Horatio Alger myth, represent'
beer products and scale the Hay Street
Hill? Bobbing majestically above me,
Spuds inspired my Nike Air shoes to
begin their flight over the treacherous
course to the finish line.
Treacherous is an understatement. In
the words of Douglas Baer, a lycra-clad
runner, "There were quite a few people
here." But weaving in and out of the
crowd was a major part of the experience.
What struck me about the race, both
figuratively and literally as I almost hit
the pavement several times, was the
amazing amalgamation of people and
creatures from all parts of society. The
old, the young, the slow, the fast, the

wheel chairs, the baby carriages, the nine
headed Chinese fire dragon, the Banana
people — all came together to share a
yearly ritual and create the most impres
sive road hazards this side of Palm Drive.
Where else but in America could you
see yuppies in their color-coordinated
running outfits running side-by-side with
folks in tattered garb? And where else
but in San Francisco would the gay,
Asian, white, black and Latino commu
nities unite to cheer one another on to
victory or at least a sub-two-hour time?
As much as I hate to admit it, perhaps
it was the nature of the sport that allowed
people to forget their prejudices for a
moment and enjoy some good, clean
sweating. Running, after all, does not
require expensive accouterments; it does
not need extensive training or coordina
tion; and it does not mandate a certain
height, weight, musculature, hair color
or level of social akilla. Ali you need is
the masochistic urge and a large smile
for the photo stations.
Did I say "masochistic urge"? I meant
the will to pursue the elusive "runner's
high." I think I got one of these highs
when I ran through Golden Gate Park.
Fortunately, this still isn't illegal in Cal
ifornia.
What should be illegal, however, is the
entry of a walker into a runner's lane.
I don't mind if someone is so buzzed
from his runner's high that he feels the
need to slow it down a bit and savor the
moment. Yet, his right to savor his high
ends where my right to maintain my
rhythm begins.
On the subject of law, I realized mid
way through the trek that Stanford Law
School will never win the centipede com

petition until it adopts a stronger non
discrimination policy and hires more mi
nority and women faculty. I figure that
while the law school administration
might proceed in its usual slow good faith
ways if the issue is defined in terms of
racial and gender balance, should the
compelling school interest be victory in
the centipede competition, then the law
school will produce results now.
In reality, though, one does not run
for results. One does not run for time,
for exercise or for victory (with the pos
sible exception of the Business School).
One undertakes 12 kilometers of hell for
the T-shirt, plain and simple. Thus, imag
ine my disappointment to learn that the
color of this year's shirt was salmon. If
I need a shirt to go with my mauve tweed
sport coat, I'll pick salmon. In my run
ning shirts, I prefer the more macho
athletic colors of royal blue, white, black,
or, for those hard workouts, fire-engine
red.
Cruising into the final turn, heart
pumping at full blast, I joined over
100,000 of my new friends in the thrill
of crossing the finish line. For now I was
able to enjoy my favorite part of running
— stopping and having lunch.
