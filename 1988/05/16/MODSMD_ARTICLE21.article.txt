## Judge morality of divestment by its consequences 
### 
EVEN a mere perusal of serious
thought on foreign policy gives
one a sense of the importance of
means and ends. Simply put, good
foreign policy should define goals and
then decide upon which courses of
action will help achieve these goals.
This proposition seems so logical, so
reasonable that few would dispute it.
However, there are many student
groups on this campus that lose sight
of this principle.
Specifically, I am thinking of Stu
dents for a Free South Africa. One
could say that the end to which this
group is working is the death of apart
heid. One may also say that the means
to this end is a total divestment policy
by Stanford which would provide the
leadership for a total divestment policy

by the United States.
I would first like to take on this
aspect of their argument by asking:
"Will a policy of national divestment
achieve your goal?" Certainly history
does not tell us that this would be
true; one could almost say that eco
nomic sanctions are the most often
used, yet least often effective method
of persuading governments to do what
we want them to do. The record is
filled with cases of the United States'
imposing sanctions and having little or
no effect. Perhaps divestment
proponents should explain how the
selling of our companies in South
Africa to rich South Africans will
achieve the unquestioned goal of end
ing apartheid.
Perhaps the most compelling argu-

ment that divestment proponents put
forth is that divestment is necessary in
order to make a moral stand against
apartheid. However, to say this is to
make divestment an end in itself, not
a means to the ultimate goal.
I propose that we judge the morality
of divestment by its consequences and
not its intentions. Just as we judge
Strategic Defense Initiative not by its
intentions (rendering nuclear weapons

obsolete), but by its consequences (the
destabilizing effects on superpower
relations), we should judge divestment
by this same yardstick.
Divestment is only a moral stand if
it is a policy that has moral conse
quences, that is, ending apartheid. This
is the issue: the effectiveness of divest
ment.
