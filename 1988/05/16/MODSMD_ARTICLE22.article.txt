# The 						Draw is subject to many variables

### 
I am writing in response to the May
12 letter to the editor in which Kristin
Barendsen expressed some confusion
about the concept of the "assignable
group" and why there are unfilled
spaces in the Draw.
The Draw is based on several inter
related principles of which the "access
to housing" principle is perhaps the
most important. The "access to
housing" principle states that prefer
ence for assignment to housing in gen
eral (not specific residences) is to be
given first to guaranteed students and
then to unguaranteed students in draw
number order.
A student may only be assigned to a
given residence if he or she does not
thereby deprive another student of
housing who is guaranteed and/or who
has a better draw number and is will
ing to live anywhere on campus.

This principle is expressed in the
Draw through the concept of the "as
signable group," that is the group of
students who are to be considered for
assignment.
The size of the assignable group is
determined by the number of under
graduate housing spaces available. Stu
dents are placed in the assignable
group based primarily on their guaran
tee standing (guaranteed students
before unguaranteed students) and
secondarily on the basis of their draw
number (low numbers before high
numbers).
Barendsen was not placed in the
assignable group because her draw
number (4,402) was much higher than
those of many other students applying
for the limited number of spaces avail
able in undergraduate housing.
Experience has shown that certain
houses with special themes, student
interests and methods of house man
agement are more successful when
their residents hold a common concern
for that which makes the house

unique.
To provide support for the goals
underlying Row and Governor's Corner
houses that offer special priorities,
assignment to these houses in Round
One of the Draw is restricted to stu
dents in the assignable group who
have a priority for the house and/or
listed it as a specific choice on their
draw card.
If not enough students in the assign
able group have listed the house as a
specific choice, vacancies may be left in
the house after Round One of the
Draw.
This gives students newly placed in
the assignable group in Round Two
who have listed special priority houses
as a choice an opportunity to be as
signed to these houses. Several hun
dred additional students are placed in
the assignable group after Round One
to join fraternities, accept positions as
RAs, go overseas or live off campus.
By leaving vacancies in some special
priority houses after Round One, the
houses are also given another opportu

nity to fill with students in the assign
able group who have a genuine inter
est in the house (demonstrated by
obtaining special priorities or listing
the house as a specific choice) and who
will contribute to the program and
goals of the house.
Only a few special priority houses
have vacancies after Round One and
Round Two of the Draw. This year
Slavianskii Dom was the only house
that had vacancies for women after
Round One.
The unusually large number of
vacancies in the house is probably due
to the fact that it is a new theme
house and is not yet well-known.
The principles and procedures of the
Draw are examined closely each year
by University committees, the Stanford
Housing Center and the Office of Resi
dential Education and are based on
thoughtful analysis and discussion with
much student input.
