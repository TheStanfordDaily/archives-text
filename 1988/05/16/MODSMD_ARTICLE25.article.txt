# Near-stumble on path to glory

LOS ANGELES — Friday the 13th
almost proved to be fatal for the Stan
ford women's tennis team.
Seventh-seeded Georgia staged a late
rally in an NCAA quarterfinal match
against the second-seeded Cardinal at
UCLA's Sunset Courts, providing Stan
ford with its most nerve-wracking mo
ment of the tournament.
"Did we really win that match?" Stan
ford Coach Frank Brennan asked after
his team had eked out a 5-3 victory.
Friday's match at first looked like it
would be a repeat of last year's team
final, when the Cardinal pounded the
Bulldogs 5-1. Stanford won all six of
the first sets in singles and took a quick,
commanding 4-0 lead in the match.
With sophomore Lisa Green, fresh
man Sandra Birch, and juniors Eleni

Rossides and Cindy Buchsbaum already
in the victory column, the Cardinal only
needed to split the last two singles
matches. And with freshman Teri Whit
linger leading 5-2 in the third set of
the No. 2 singles, an early afternoon
appeared to be on the horizon for Stan
ford.
But with the match seemingly lost,
the Bulldogs started to make some
noise. Lisa Apanay rallied for a 4-6, 6-4,
6-3 victory over Kay Tittle in the No.
4 singles, handing the Cardinal senior
her first loss ever in NCAA team tour
nament play.
Then Georgia's Stacey Schefflin
stunned Whitlinger by winning the final
five games of the No. 2 singles to record
a 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory that sent the
match to doubles.
The Bulldogs continued to take a bite
out of the Cardinal's lead as Jane
Cohodes and Lianna Bebeau swept

Buchsbaum and Whitlinger 6-4, 6-4 in
the No. 2 doubles to make the score 4-3.
On court one, SchefTlin and Apanay
had taken Birch and senior Cari Hagey
to a third set, while on court three,
Tittle and Green also appeared headed
for a third set.
But Birch and Hagey ended the
suspense by playing a near-perfect final
set to defeat SchefTlin and Apanay 6-1,
3-6, 6-0.
"This is always a big match in the
tournament," Brennan said after the
quarterfinal victory. "If you can get
through, at least you're in the final
four."
Saturday's semifinal pitted Stanford
against third-seeded USC. In two pre
vious matches this season, the Cardinal
ousted the Trojans in singles. Saturday,
the Cardinal completed the hat trick by
posting a 5-1 victory.
"We played them three times and
couldn't get to doubles once," USC
Coach Dave Borelli lamented. "That's
pretty sad."
Said Brennan: "In my pre-game
Knute Rockne speech, I said, 'You guys
not only should win, you should win in
singles.' "
The Cardinal not only won in singles,
it won the first five singles matches
completed. Tittle won in straight sets,
while Whitlinger, Birch, Rossides and
Buchsbaum posted three-set victories.
Rossides' victory was especially
noteworthy. The Cardinal junior lost
the first set 6-0 and had a match point
against her in the second set before
rallying for a 0-6, 7-6, 6-4 victory.
"This is one of the most frustrating
matches I've ever had," Borelli said. "I
thought we should've won, but they
played really tough. They were really,
really tough."
Last year after losing to Stanford in
the first round, Borelli predicted that
the Cardinal would go on to win the
title. After Saturday's match, he said,
"All I know is the winner of our match
has always won the whole thing."
Borelli may be 0-for-8 dating back to
April of 1986 against Stanford, but he
is now 2-for-2 in predicting NCAA
Champions.
