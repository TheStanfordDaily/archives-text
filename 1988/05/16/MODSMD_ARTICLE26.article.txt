# Bring out the brooms; baseball sweeps USC
## Stanford awaits at-large playoff assignment 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The Stanford base
ball team put an
exclamation point
at the end of its
regular-season
schedule yester
day, trouncing

USC 12-4 at Sunken Diamond to
complete a resounding three
game sweep of the Trojans.
Freshman Stan Spencer threw
a complete-game seven-hitter, and
junior first baseman Ron Wit
meyer's two home runs paced a
14-hit Cardinal attack that capped
a three-game offensive explosion.
Stanford also won 10-8 Friday and
10-9 Saturday.
The three wins give the Cardi
nal a 36-21 record for the regular
season, and an 18-12 record in
Pacific-10 Conference Southern
Division play. Stanford finished
second in the Six-Pac, three
games behind league-champion
Arizona State and two games
ahead of third-place California.
The Cardinal will begin NCAA
regional tournament play either
May 25 or May 26, depending on
which regional the team is placed
in. Most of the regional sites and
most of the at-large berths will
be announced today, but many of
the at-large teams like Stanford
probably will not know which
regional they are going to until
May 23, after various make-up
games and conference tourna
ments have been completed.
This weekend's three wins were
promising for a number of
reasons:
• Stanford, which had found all
sorts of interesting ways to lose
games this season, found ways to

win this weekend. "This weekend,
there seems to be a feeling that
we're going to score, that we're
going to win somehow," Witmeyer
said after Saturday's game.
"That's something that we had
last year that's been missing this
year."
• The Cardinal turned in its
best sustained offensive perform
ance of the season. On a weekend
when Sunken Diamond did its
best imitation of Cape Canaveral
— with both teams launching
rockets at regular intervals (18
hits left the premises during the
three games) — Stanford piled up
a total of 32 runs on 38 hits,
including 11 home runs and nine
doubles.
"It was a pleasant surprise,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "That's what we've waited
for all year — we've done it in a
few games, but it hasn't happened
consistently."
• The Cardinal won despite get
ting sub-par performances from
starters Mike Mussina on Friday
and Lee Plemel on Saturday.
"We're actually winning games
with offense, which we haven't
done all year," Marquess said.
"You gotta win some games where
you're not pitching well, and we
haven't done that much this
year. . . . You'd like to keep it
neater — pitch well and win 5-1
. . . but I'd rather be playing this
way than scratching out runs."
• All of the batters in the middle
of the Cardinal order produced
runs consistently. Junior third
baseman Ed Sprague had one
home run and five RBI. Sopho
more rightfielder Paul Carey con
tinued his remarkable second-half
performance with two home runs,
six RBI and two doubles. Wit
meyer had three homers and eight

RBI. Senior catcher Doug Robbins
had three home runs — including
two on Friday — and four RBI.
It was the first time this season
that all of the big guns in the
Cardinal lineup have fired in uni
son.
Two of the smaller guns, soph
omore shortstop Troy Paulsen
and junior second baseman Frank
Carey, also got in on the act. Paul
sen had a home run and two dou
bles on the weekend, and Carey
ripped his first home run of the
season — a titanic three-run blast
to deep centerfield in the second
inning of Friday's game.
• Ace reliever Steve Chitren
continued his resurgent pitching,
turning in solid outings on both
Friday and Saturday. Chitren
made things interesting in both
outings by flirting with the outer
limits of the strike zone, but he
got the big outs and kept the ball
in the park. It was the first time
this season that he has recorded
two saves in one weekend.
• Spencer recorded a win. The
freshman right-hander from Van
couver, Wash., has been a hard
luck case all season: Although his
ERA is a skimpy 3.49 (second
lowest among the Cardinal
regulars), Spencer has suffered
from a lack of offensive support

in most of his outings, and had
only six decisions in 14 starts
going into yesterday's game. He
hadn't won a game since March
6, when he beat UCLA 5-1 at
Sunken Diamond.
"He has pitched very well,"
Marquess said. "It seems like
every time he pitches it's 1-1, and
we take him out and then we win
or lose."
"It's frustrating when you pitch
well and don't get a decision,"
Spencer said. "It's OK once or
twice, but when it happens six or
seven times it gets really frustrat
ing."
Spencer began yesterday's
game a bit shakily, giving up a
solo home run to USC third
baseman Rodney Peete in the first
inning. But the Cardinal was
pretty used to that kind of thing
by yesterday, since the Trojans

had homered twice in the first
inning on Friday and once in the
first inning on Saturday.
Stanford wasted no time in
answering. With one out in the
bottom of the first, Paulsen hung
a ball out to dry in left field. But
USC leftfielder Damon Buford
reached over the fence and
deflected the ball back into the
park, and Paulsen ended up with
a double.
Paulsen moved to third on a
bloop single to right by Ed
Sprague, and Paul Carey brought
him home with a single to tie the
score 1-1. With two outs and two
on, Witmeyer crunched a ball into
the trees behind the right-field
fence to give Stanford a 4-1 lead.
In the third, Buford homered
and Peete homered for the second

time in as many at-bats to bring
the Trojans within 4-3.
The Cardinal blew the game
open in the fourth, however.
Three singles loaded the bases,
then Frank Carey brought in two
runs with a sharp double down
the right-field line, and Sprague
brought in two more with a single
to left, putting Stanford up 8-3.
USC pulled to within 8-4 with
a double and a single in the sixth,
but the Trojans blew a big oppor
tunity in the seventh. Buford and
shortstop Bret Barberie led off
the inning with singles, bringing
up Peete with two on, no outs
and the Trojans trailing by four
runs. Peete tried to bunt but
popped up to Robbins.
"I couldn't believe it," Robbins
said. "The guy has two home runs
in the game already, and they're
down by four runs.... He could
get them back in the game with
one swing."
Witmeyer homered again in the

seventh — this time with one on
— to make it 10-4, and in the
eighth, Robbins hit a two-run shot
— in the final Sunken Diamond
at-bat of his collegiate career.
Robbins had walked in his pre
vious at-bat (in the seventh, and
was scheduled to bat fourth in
the eighth inning. "I £old the guys
to get me one more at-bat, because
I didn't want my last at-bat to be
a walk," he said.
But it didn't look like Robbins
would get up. Paulsen and
Sprague both struck out against
reliever Brian Nichols, bringing
up Paul Carey with two outs and
Robbins on deck. "Paul (Carey)
said, 'I guarantee you that you'll
get up,' " Robbins said. "Then he
hit that pop fly (a foul shot that
tucked into the USC bullpen just
out of reach of Peete), and turned
to me and said, 'I was just trying
to scare you.' "
Carey then doubled off the wall
in left field, and Robbins nailed
a 1-2 fastball over the left-field
fence for his 10th home run of
the season.

and junior second baseman Frank
Carey, also got in on the act. Paul
sen had a home run and two dou
bles on the weekend, and Carey
ripped his first home run of the
season — a titanic three-run blast
to deep centerfield in the second
inning of Friday's game.
• Ace reliever Steve Chitren
continued his resurgent pitching,
turning in solid outings on both
Friday and Saturday. Chitren
made things interesting in both
outings by flirting with the outer
limits of the strike zone, but he
got the big outs and kept the ball
in the park. It was the first time
this season that he has recorded
two saves in one weekend.
• Spencer recorded a win. The
freshman right-hander from Van
couver, Wash., has been a hard
luck case all season: Although his
ERA is a skimpy 3.49 (second
lowest among the Cardinal
regulars), Spencer has suffered
from a lack of offensive support

in most of his outings, and had
only six decisions in 14 starts
going into yesterday's game. He
hadn't won a game since March
6, when he beat UCLA 5-1 at
Sunken Diamond.
"He has pitched very well,"
Marquess said. "It seems like
every time he pitches it's 1-1, and
we take him out and then we win
or lose."
"It's frustrating when you pitch
well and don't get a decision,"
Spencer said. "It's OK once or
twice, but when it happens six or
seven times it gets really frustrat
ing."
Spencer began yesterday's
game a bit shakily, giving up a
solo home run to USC third
baseman Rodney Peete in the first
inning. But the Cardinal was
pretty used to that kind of thing
by yesterday, since the Trojans

had homered twice in the first
inning on Friday and once in the
first inning on Saturday.
Stanford wasted no time in
answering. With one out in the
bottom of the first, Paulsen hung
a ball out to dry in left field. But
USC leftfielder Damon Buford
reached over the fence and
deflected the ball back into the
park, and Paulsen ended up with
a double.
Paulsen moved to third on a
bloop single to right by Ed
Sprague, and Paul Carey brought
him home with a single to tie the
score 1-1. With two outs and two
on, Witmeyer crunched a ball into
the trees behind the right-field
fence to give Stanford a 4-1 lead.
In the third, Buford homered
and Peete homered for the second

time in as many at-bats to bring
the Trojans within 4-3.
The Cardinal blew the game
open in the fourth, however.
Three singles loaded the bases,
then Frank Carey brought in two
runs with a sharp double down
the right-field line, and Sprague
brought in two more with a single
to left, putting Stanford up 8-3.
USC pulled to within 8-4 with
a double and a single in the sixth,
but the Trojans blew a big oppor
tunity in the seventh. Buford and
shortstop Bret Barberie led off
the inning with singles, bringing
up Peete with two on, no outs
and the Trojans trailing by four
runs. Peete tried to bunt but
popped up to Robbins.
"I couldn't believe it," Robbins
said. "The guy has two home runs
in the game already, and they're
down by four runs.... He could
get them back in the game with
one swing."
Witmeyer homered again in the

seventh — this time with one on
— to make it 10-4, and in the
eighth, Robbins hit a two-run shot
— in the final Sunken Diamond
at-bat of his collegiate career.
Robbins had walked in his pre
vious at-bat (in the seventh, and
was scheduled to bat fourth in
the eighth inning. "I £old the guys
to get me one more at-bat, because
I didn't want my last at-bat to be
a walk," he said.
But it didn't look like Robbins
would get up. Paulsen and
Sprague both struck out against
reliever Brian Nichols, bringing
up Paul Carey with two outs and
Robbins on deck. "Paul (Carey)
said, 'I guarantee you that you'll
get up,' " Robbins said. "Then he
hit that pop fly (a foul shot that
tucked into the USC bullpen just
out of reach of Peete), and turned
to me and said, 'I was just trying
to scare you.' "
Carey then doubled off the wall
in left field, and Robbins nailed
a 1-2 fastball over the left-field
fence for his 10th home run of
the season.
The Stanford base
ball team put an
exclamation point
at the end of its
regular-season
schedule yester
day, trouncing

USC 12-4 at Sunken Diamond to
complete a resounding three
game sweep of the Trojans.
Freshman Stan Spencer threw
a complete-game seven-hitter, and
junior first baseman Ron Wit
meyer's two home runs paced a
14-hit Cardinal attack that capped
a three-game offensive explosion.
Stanford also won 10-8 Friday and
10-9 Saturday.
The three wins give the Cardi
nal a 36-21 record for the regular
season, and an 18-12 record in
Pacific-10 Conference Southern
Division play. Stanford finished
second in the Six-Pac, three
games behind league-champion
Arizona State and two games
ahead of third-place California.
The Cardinal will begin NCAA
regional tournament play either
May 25 or May 26, depending on
which regional the team is placed
in. Most of the regional sites and
most of the at-large berths will
be announced today, but many of
the at-large teams like Stanford
probably will not know which
regional they are going to until
May 23, after various make-up
games and conference tourna
ments have been completed.
This weekend's three wins were
promising for a number of
reasons:
• Stanford, which had found all
sorts of interesting ways to lose
games this season, found ways to

win this weekend. "This weekend,
there seems to be a feeling that
we're going to score, that we're
going to win somehow," Witmeyer
said after Saturday's game.
"That's something that we had
last year that's been missing this
year."
• The Cardinal turned in its
best sustained offensive perform
ance of the season. On a weekend
when Sunken Diamond did its
best imitation of Cape Canaveral
— with both teams launching
rockets at regular intervals (18
hits left the premises during the
three games) — Stanford piled up
a total of 32 runs on 38 hits,
including 11 home runs and nine
doubles.
"It was a pleasant surprise,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said. "That's what we've waited
for all year — we've done it in a
few games, but it hasn't happened
consistently."
• The Cardinal won despite get
ting sub-par performances from
starters Mike Mussina on Friday
and Lee Plemel on Saturday.
"We're actually winning games
with offense, which we haven't
done all year," Marquess said.
"You gotta win some games where
you're not pitching well, and we
haven't done that much this
year. . . . You'd like to keep it
neater — pitch well and win 5-1
. . . but I'd rather be playing this
way than scratching out runs."
• All of the batters in the middle
of the Cardinal order produced
runs consistently. Junior third
baseman Ed Sprague had one
home run and five RBI. Sopho
more rightfielder Paul Carey con
tinued his remarkable second-half
performance with two home runs,
six RBI and two doubles. Wit
meyer had three homers and eight

at-bat of his collegiate career.
Robbins had walked in his pre
vious at-bat (in the seventh, and
was scheduled to bat fourth in
the eighth inning. "I £old the guys
to get me one more at-bat, because
I didn't want my last at-bat to be
a walk," he said.
But it didn't look like Robbins
would get up. Paulsen and
Sprague both struck out against
reliever Brian Nichols, bringing
up Paul Carey with two outs and
Robbins on deck. "Paul (Carey)
said, 'I guarantee you that you'll
get up,' " Robbins said. "Then he
hit that pop fly (a foul shot that
tucked into the USC bullpen just
out of reach of Peete), and turned
to me and said, 'I was just trying
to scare you.' "
Carey then doubled off the wall
in left field, and Robbins nailed
a 1-2 fastball over the left-field
fence for his 10th home run of
the season.
