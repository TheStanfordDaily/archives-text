# Witmeyer rocks Trojans
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
Ron Witmeyer is Randy Powers' worst
nightmare.
Witmeyer, Stanford's junior first
baseman, has feasted on USC pitching
this season, and Powers seems to be a
particular favorite. Witmeyer homered
twice against Powers in a game on Feb.
26 in Los Angeles, then took him deep
again yesterday, blasting a two-run shot
in the seventh inning of the Cardinal's
12-4 win.
And Witmeyer gave Powers a healthy
bump when the two met in a close play
at the plate in the fifth inning yesterday,
nearly igniting a brawl.
Witmeyer also homered in the first in
ning of yesterday's game (a three-run can
nonball off Trojan starter Darrin Beer)
and in the seventh inning of Saturday's
game (also a three-run bomb, this one
off reliever Dave Latter).
In six games against the Trojans this
season, Witmeyer was 8-for-21 (.381),
with five home runs, 13 RBI, seven runs
and seven walks.
The 6-foot-3, 210-pound native of West
Bayshore, N.Y., is at a loss to explain his
mastery of the Trojan. "I don't know
what it is — I've hit nine home runs this
year, and over half of them are against
these guys," he said.
And Witmeyer claimed that Powers
isn't a favorite of his. "There are some
pitchers that you love to hit off of, but
he (Powers) isn't one of them," he said.
It turns out that the Trojans just had
the bad luck to run into Witmeyer at a
time when his power stroke is in a groove.
He has had a hard season offensively
(batting .281 going into yesterday's
game), and made some adjustments re
cently. "I changed my swing a little bit,"
he said. "I figured I wasn't hitting for

average, anyway, so I might as well try
to hit for power."
Witmeyer said he took the bat off his
shoulder in his batting stance, bringing
the bat up more vertical to the ground,
and is trying to transfer more weight to
his front foot during his swing. It worked
well against the Trojans.
"It's nice to pick it up before regionals,"
he said. ""I had some pretty ugly games
before today."
But even when he wasn't hitting the
ball well, Witmeyer has contributed to
the team, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said.
"With a lot of first basemen, you have
them in the lineup just for their bats,"
Marquess said. "The thing with Ron is
that he's such a good defensive player
that even when he struggles (offensively),
he helps you in the field."
Witmeyer has made only five errors in
545 chances this year, for a sterling .991
fielding percentage. In his three-year
career at Stanford, Witmeyer has made
just 10 errors in 1,488 chances (.993).
And he has been much more productive
offensively than his batting average might
indicate. His 56 RBI is second best on
the team, and he has a healthy .383 on
base percentage.
Still, Witmeyer isn't pleased with the
year he's had. "It has been disappointing
in a lot of ways, both for me and for the
team," he said. "We didn't win the Six-
Pac, and I haven't played as well as I
would have liked."
Now, however, both the team and Wit
meyer seem to be surging at the right
time. "The team seems to be reaching
the peak at the right time," he said.
"We've been trying to get on a roll for
the last few weeks. .. . We know the
pitchers are going to be there; we just
needed to get the bats going."
