# No new Pac-10 qualifiers for track
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Saturday's meet at Sacramento
State was the last chance for
a dozen members of the Stan
ford track and field team to
add their names to the Pacific
10 Conference Championship
list of qualifiers. But this last

chance instead turned out to be their last
race, as Stanford's Pac-10 list will look vir
tually the same as it did after the Stanford
Twilight meet April 23.
Most of the top Stanford athletes rested
last weekend for the Pac-10 meet next Sat
urday and Sunday, and thus the meet was
the season finale for the majority of those
competing. But unlike the dual meet against
California or some of the earlier home com
petitions, this was an opportunity to run for
themselves.
Freshman Debbie Malueg was one who came
close to qualifying, finishing second in the
shot put, one place ahead of junior teammate
Morgyn Warner, but well off the qualifying

mark. "I was disappointed, hut I improved a
lot this season," Malueg said.
Freshman Chris Rae came in second in the
800 meters but also missed the mark in that
event. Rae ran a 1:53 pace in Saturday's heat,
over the 1:51.44 mark he needed.
Stanford Coach Brooks Johnson said he
was "disappointed that there were no Pac-10
qualifiers" hut did not want to place too much
emphasis on the contest. "They are people
we wanted qualified and they didn't get qual
ified, but they've had opportunities."
One athlete, pole vaulter John Gash, was
competing for higher stakes. Gash came close
but just missed vaulting 17 feet, five-and
three-quarters inches, the NCAA Champion
ship mark. Gash, a senior, set the school
record last year at 17-BMi and will be com
peting both for points and the NCAA mark
at the Pac-lOs.

Looking directly at Pac-lOs now, Johnson's
prime consideration this week will be "keeping
everybody healthy." For example, senior high
jumpers Lisa Bernhagen and Brian Marshall,
who rested last weekend due to back problems,
will be counted on heavily at the Pac-lOs and
the NCAAs June 1-4.
Another senior, Henry Green, will double
at the Pac-lOs in both the long jump Saturday
and the triple jump Sunday if his leg holds up.
Overall, Stanford will enter 22 qualifiers
and a total of 27 athletes at the Conference
Championships. Juniors James Alborough and
Kim Stevens will run the men's and women's
10,000 meters, respectively, which have no
qualifying requirements. In addition, as every
team is allowed one entry in each event, junior
D.D. Harris will compete in the decathlon,
sophomore Peg©' Odita will vie in the hep
tathlon and junior Dawn Wilson will race in
the 400 meter hurdles.
Both Johnson and Asst. Coach Scott Chisam
were uncertain of where the team would place.
"1 really don't know, " Johnson said. "I don't
like predictions because they put too much
pressure on the kids."
