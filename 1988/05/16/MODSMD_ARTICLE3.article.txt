### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Amid activists' cries for students to
change the U.S. educational system, Dem
ocratic presidential candidate Jesse Jack
son wowed an estimated 7,000 people in
White Plaza Saturday, pledging to carry
an educational bill of rights drafted by
California students to the Democratic Na
tional Convention.
Calling education "our No. 1 weapon for
national security, national defense," Jack
son criticized Reaganomics for devoting so
few resources to education and promised
to double federal spending on education if
he is elected president.
Under a hot afternoon sun, a crowd of
students and community members packed
White Plaza from Tresidder to the Clock
Tower to hear the candidate. Jackson spoke
at 3 p.m., two hours later than scheduled.
Jackson, who last came to Stanford on
Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in 1987,
addressed a student conference here about
the state of the nation's educational sys
tem. Conference organizers — members of
three networks of ethnic groups from
across California and several statewide stu
dent government associations — drafted a
bill of rights with 11 general demands for
the improvement of the nation's educa-
tional system.
When Angela Ramirez, a stu
dent from Sacramento State, pre
sented Jackson with the bill and
asked him to "carry [students']
dreams and make them reality,"
Jackson replied, "You got it."
Jackson, who has advocated
changes similar to those for
warded in the bill throughout his
campaign, then congratulated
Stanford students on their suc
cessful fight to replace the West
ern Culture requirement as a
"tremendous victory for multicul
tural education."
Although he did not mention
Dukakis by name, Jackson told
the crowd that Dukakis' home
state "has consistently had one of
the largest funding gaps between
rich and poor school districts."

He also quoted Bush as telling
a group of Latino students re
cently that "college is not neces
sary for success. We still need
people in our society to do the
physical work."
That's why "we need George
Bush out of Washington doing
some physical work," Jackson
retorted, drawing laughter and
one of the afternoon's many
standing ovations.
"Our priorities must change.
Amid these oceans of plenty there
are abounding islands of poverty."
"It's safer to educate before the
fact than to rehabilitate after the
fact," he said, noting that one year
in high school costs less than
$2,500 while one year in a county
jail can cost over $20,000.
When Jackson arrived back
stage at White Plaza, he embraced
former BSU Chair Amanda
Kemp, a senior, before accompa
nying her onstage.

Kemp, one of several activists
who spoke before Jackson's arri
val, gave a rousing, emotional
speech that drew thunderous ap
plause and a standing ovation.
Turning from policy to a per
sonal level, Jackson said in his
political career and in his personal
life he has "always felt the odds.
"I was born to a teenage mother
and now I stand within three men
of winning the White House. I
know the odds!" he shouted. "As
long as I lived I never earned the
right to do less than my best. Will
you do your best?"
"There is power in hope. You
must not surrender," he told the
audience.
Jackson addressed specific
wheelchair-bound members of the
audience, saying: "I challenge
you: Don't you give up!"
"I'd rather have Roosevelt in a
wheelchair than Reagan on a
horse."
