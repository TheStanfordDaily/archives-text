# No blues after Card-White scrimmage
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Staff writer 
If spring practice is any indicator, Stan
ford football aficionados have a lot to look
forward to next season.
The Cardinal has always had a tradition
of great quarterbacks, dating back to
Frankie Albert in the 19405, and this year's
traditional Cardinal and White scrimmage
showed that Stanford may have an embar
rassment of riches at the quarterback slot.
In the game which traditionally marks
the end of spring practice, redshirt freshman
Jason Palumbis emerged as the star of the
potential bumper crop of signal-callers. He
completed 16 of 22 passes for 184 yards,
three touchdowns and one interception.
Palumbis is very well suited for Stanford
Coach Jack Elway's "run-and-shoot of
fense," which Elway instituted at the start
of spring practice as a "great experiment,"
because Palumbis ran it during his final
two years of high school in Lake Oswego,
Ore. The run-and-shoot uses more receivers
than the traditional offensive alignment, and
is designed to add more offensive excitement
and scoring to the game.

"I'm not going to hide it. I want to play,
and I'm going to do my best to make that
happen," Palumbis said after the game.
There is only one very large obstacle pre
venting Palumbis from starting. It comes
in the person of sophomore two-sport star
Brian Johnson, who also saw a good deal
of action in the game. Overall, Johnson com
pleted three of seven passes for a total of
51 yards. Not overwhelming statistics, but
in Elway's mind, the job is still Johnson's
to lose.
"Brian started looking better the last cou
ple of weeks, but we know what he can do
from game situations," Elway said.
On the defensive side, returning inside
linebacker starters Kevin Richardson, a
junior, and Jono Tunney as well as junior
Arnie Pelluer had fine games, putting pres
sure on the quarterback and playing good
pass defense. Pelluer finished the game with
eight tackles, the second most on the team,
while junior Tunney played incredible pass
defense, nabbing two interceptions, one of
which he ran back 37 yards for a touchdown.
At the outside linebacker position, Elway
had to be pleased with the performances of
senior Rob Hinckley, who was the team's

fourth-leading tackier last season, and
senior Bruce Lang. The pair had two sacks
each.
The run-and-shoot offense usually only
calls for one player in the backfield, and
choosing that one player could be tough for
Elway. Theoretically, next year's squad
returns two experienced players at running
back — juniors Charlie Young and Jon
Volpe.
But Young went down early with an ii\jury
and Volpe was used sparingly, allowing two
new players to emerge as possible contenders
for the position — senior Scott Eschelman
and sophomore Tommy Vardell. Eschelman
contributed 22 yards on the ground and 45
as the team's leading receiver, while Vardell
was the game's best rusher with 42 yards
in seven carries.
Several players found themselves on the
receiving end of Palumbis* passes. Senior
Jim Price, who saw a good deal of action
last year at the tight end position, caught
one of Palumbis' TD passes for 10 yards.
Speedy sophomore Walter Batson broke one
wide open with a 37-yard scoring catch, and
redshirt freshman Chris Walsh also scored
with a 5-yard TD catch.
