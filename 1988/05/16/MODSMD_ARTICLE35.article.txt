A busy West Coast campaign
schedule over the weekend forced
Michael Dukakis to bypass an an
ticipated appearance at Stanford
Saturday, a Dukakis press repre
sentative said yesterday.
Declining an invitation to par
ticipate in Saturday's education
conference here, Dukakis spent
much of the day campaigning in
Oregon and the evening fundrais
ing in nearby Los Altos Hills and
Marin County, explained cam
paign press representative Amy
Dehart.
The Massachusetts governor
sent his son, John, to speak at
the conference in his place. Con
ference organizers last month in
vited all remaining presidential

candidates to speak at the event,
but only Rev. Jesse Jackson ac
cepted the offer.
"Governor Dukakis receives a
lot of requests for appearances,"
Dehart said.
"Governor Dukakis had com
mitments Friday night and Sat
urday morning in Southern Cal
ifornia that he would have had
to miss if he spoke at Stanford,"
said junior Hugh Bethell, co-chair
of Students for Dukakis.
Bethell said he thinks Dukakis
will probably try to schedule a
visit to Stanford before Califor
nia's primary June 7. Dehart,
however, said "no definite plans
have been made" for an appear
ance at Stanford. "If Governor
Dukakis does not visit Stanford
this spring," Bethell speculated,
"he will definitely come next fall."
