# Kennedy: Area 1 misunderstood

Both the media and U.S. Sec
retary of Education William
Bennett have created misper
ceptions about recent changes
in Stanford's Area One require
ment, University President
Donald Kennedy said Saturday
at Bowman Alumni House in
his annual "State of the Uni
versity" address.
Speaking to a crowd of 1,500
alumni and community mem
bers attending the 56th Annual
Stanford Campus Conference,
Kennedy said recent attention
given the Area One compromise
does not accurately reflect the

actual modifications. The mod
ifications "are, in my judgment,
marginal changes compared to
external fuss," he said.
According to Kennedy, both
Bennett and the media have
overestimated the effects of
these recent developments at
Stanford, and have purposely
tried to misrepresent the facts
surrounding the University's
decision. "No event in my his
tory has been so broadly misun
derstood," he said.
On March 31 the Faculty Sen
ate approved a proposal that
eliminated the core list of read
ings taught in Area One courses
and renamed the course Cul
ture, Ideas and Values. The
change allows lecturers more

freedom to select which texts
they will include in their
courses.
He said the senate passage of
the CIV proposal unsettled
many people's preconceptions of
education. "We hunger for lists
of books and facts that we need
to know to be educated," he
said, referring to the now
defunct core list. "It is not com
fortable to have to give up a
powerful and authoritative
sense that there is a fixed body
of things that we need to know."
In the same way that people
were afraid of Darwin's theory
of evolution when it emerged,
people are afraid of the new
knowledge contained in the CIV
track, Kennedy said.
