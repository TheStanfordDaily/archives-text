# Student activists make strides with education bill
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Although most people will remember
Saturday's educational rally because it
brought presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson to speak here, for conference
organizers the ratification of an "Edu
cation Bill of Rights" rivaled Jackson's
speech as the high point of the weekend.
Many said they believe the bill, which
student activists from around the state
ratified only hours after Jackson spoke,
will help set the agenda for future stu
dent activism on the state and national
level.
"We can really use it to galvanize
student support nationally," said Elsa
Tsutaoka, a member of the conference
planning committee.
"It can serve as a rallying point be
cause right now there's no other alter-
native in education," said Steve
Phillips, former chair of the Black
Student Union at Stanford and
one of the students who helped
draft the document.
Authored by student leaders
statewide, the bill lists 11 general
demands that call for a restruc
turing of the U.S. educational sys
tem.
The demands range from the
practical — increasing federal
spending for education and hiring
more and better teachers — to
the controversial — strengthen
ing bilingual education and ex
panding ethnic studies in all
schools.
The idea for the bill came last
fall from a meeting of the
statewide MEChA network, a
Chicano/Latino student associa
tion, and soon spread to two other
statewide networks.
MEChA stands for the
Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano
De Aztlan. A/BSSA and A/PSU
stand for the African/Black
Statewide Student Alliance and
the Asian/Pacific Islander Student
Union, respectively.
Three California student al
liances, representing the Univer
sity of California system, the Cal
ifornia State University system
and an association of community
colleges from around the state,
subsequently joined the move
ment and participated in the con
ference this weekend.
Marshall Smith, dean of the
School of Education, said few of
the basic points of the bill should
inspire enough controversy to
alienate any democrats.
People are finally viewing the
state of education as a "very
serious problem," he added. "I
think students have picked up on
that."
