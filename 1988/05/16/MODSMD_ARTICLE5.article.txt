### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Saying that Americans are "in a battle for the
economic future of our country, and that battle will
not be decided in the war room, but in the class
room," John Dukakis, stepson of Democratic pres
idential candidate Michael Dukakis, spoke at
Memorial Auditorium Saturday, meeting with scat
tered applause and some heckling from a sparse
crowd.
In a keynote speech to about 300 people at a
conference here on U.S. education, John Dukakis
said he "regretted" that his father was unable to
speak at Stanford.
Conference organizers said they invited all pres
idential candidates to speak. Although Republican
candidate George Bush reportedly declined, Demo
cratic candidate Jesse Jackson accepted and spoke

in White Plaza several hours after
John Dukakis appeared in place
of his father in Memorial Audito
rium.
Michael Dukakis, who was in
the area over the weekend, visited
a high school in Daly City Friday
and attended a fund-raising din
ner in Los Altos Saturday night.
A graduate of Brown Universi
ty, 29-year-old John Dukakis was
an actor in film and television for
several years until entering
politics in 1982. He worked with
Massachusetts legislators before
joining his father's presidential
campaign in early 1987. After
heading the winter primary cam
paign in the South, he started
directing his father's California
campaign.
John Dukakis spoke to an au

dience of mostly overt Jackson
supporters.
His introduction met with scat
tered applause and shouts of
"Jackson for president." He was
interrupted several times as mem
bers of the audience challenged
specific portions of his speech and
cheered when he mentioned Jack
son.
John Dukakis said his father
wants to revitalize and improve
teaching in order to make the
United States the "leading scien
tific, and industrial, and economic
power in the world" by the 21st
century.
The next president will be faced
with "an ocean of Republican red
tape" and will need to make
choices about how to improve ed
ucation, Dukakis said. He added
that his father's highest priority
will be to ensure the "competency,
training and currency" of teachers
in the United States.
