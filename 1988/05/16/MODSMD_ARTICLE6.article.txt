# Law students demand more minority faculty
## 
### Matt Poppe Staff writer 
A law student protest Friday
urging greater affirmative action
in minority faculty hiring at the
Law School turned into a spon
taneous cross-campus march and
a confrontation with faculty mem
bers at the Faculty Club.
The noontime protest, organ
ized by a group of law students,
began as an attempt to read a
statement to School Dean
Paul Brest criticizing the low
number of tenured women and
minority law professors and the
alleged mistreatment of visiting
minority and women professors.
Because Brest was out of town,
however, second-year law student
Sharon Simpson and first-year
student Juan Sepulveda, two of
the protest's organizers, read the
statement in front of the dean's

closed door. Meanwhile, other stu
dents covered the door with copies
of the statement.
Written by 10 law students, the
statement expresses dissatisfac
tion with the low number of
women and minority faculty
members at the Law School. The
statement also laments that past
proposals by the law student Mul
ticultural Council calling for nu
merical quotas in the hiring of
women and minority faculty
members have not been taken
seriously. The statement does not
call for specific quotas, however.
Currently there are four ten
ured minority law professors at
Stanford — all men — and two
tenured female professors.
The Law School counters that
an aggressive search for more mi
nority faculty is necessary, but
quotas would restrict the school's
freedom to hire top-flight profes
sors.
Although the Multicultural
Council — a coalition of women,
minority, gay and lesbian law stu
dents — was not officially in
volved in drafting the statement,
council member Peter Haviland
said all of the organizers of Fri
day's protest were members of the
council.
Hoping for a face-to-face con
frontation with the Law School
administration, the protesters,
who numbered close to 100,
marched through the Law School
chanting "1-2-3-4, we ain't gonna
wait no more!" and taping copies
of their statement to professors'
doors until they found Asst. Law
Dean Robert Weisberg in his of
fice.
After listening to the statement,
Weisberg told the protesters that
although he was "greatly in sym
pathy with the statement . . .
prospects are not good" for im

plementing racial or sexual quotas
in Law School hiring. He said fac
ulty support for such a policy was
very low and that "it would be
quixotic ... for me to [make
promises]."
According to Weisberg, im
provements in minority and
female representation on the Law
School faculty will have to depend
on the "good faith" of individuals.
After speaking with Weisberg,
the protesters marched from the
Law School to the Faculty Club,
chanting "Racism, sexism, we say
'no.' 'Good faith' efforts have got
to go."
The statement, titled "Faculty
Hiring at Stanford, Harvard: Stu
dents in Solidarity," emphasized
that the problems at Stanford's
law school are not unique. The
statement referred to a sit-in last
week at Harvard in which a dean's
office was occupied by black law
students who demanded specific
numerical increases in female and
minority faculty hiring.
The statement proposes the es
tablishment of "a network to coor
dinate action .. . for real affirm
ative action at mqjor law schools."
