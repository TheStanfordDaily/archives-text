# Law students demand more minority faculty
## 
### Matt Poppe Staff writer 
A law student protest Friday
urging greater affirmative action
in minority faculty hiring at the
Law School turned into a spon
taneous cross-campus march and
a confrontation with faculty mem
bers at the Faculty Club.
The noontime protest, organ
ized by a group of law students,
began as an attempt to read a
statement to School Dean
Paul Brest criticizing the low
number of tenured women and
minority law professors and the
alleged mistreatment of visiting
minority and women professors.
Because Brest was out of town,
however, second-year law student
Sharon Simpson and first-year
student Juan Sepulveda, two of
the protest's organizers, read the
statement in front of the dean's

closed door. Meanwhile, other stu
dents covered the door with copies
of the statement.
Written by 10 law students, the
statement expresses dissatisfac
tion with the low number of
women and minority faculty
members at the Law School. The
statement also laments that past
proposals by the law student Mul
ticultural Council calling for nu
merical quotas in the hiring of
women and minority faculty
members have not been taken
seriously. The statement does not
call for specific quotas, however.
Currently there are four ten
ured minority law professors at
Stanford — all men — and two
tenured female professors.
The Law School counters that
an aggressive search for more mi
nority faculty is necessary, but
