# Campus debate focuses on poverty

Left and right clashed last night
in an on-campus debate about so
lutions to poverty in the United
States.
An audience of about 50 in
Tresidder Oak Lounge witnessed
an intense debate between repre
sentatives of the liberal Stanford-
Peninsula Democratic Socialists
of America and the conservative
Stanford Review. The two groups
debated the question: "What to
do about poverty?"
While none of the participants
disputed the existence of some
level of poverty in the United
States, there was great disagree
ment about the seriousness of the
problem, and what remedies are
required.
Representatives of the Review
argued that only through un
restrained capitalism, have a few
countries in the world managed
to escape the cycle of abject
poverty.
"A rising tide has lifted all the
boats" in those countries, said
junior Peter Thiel, founder and
co-editor of the Review.
Thiel said that government
"handout" programs are not the
solution to poverty, and that eco
nomic growth is preferable to the
stagnation existing in "so-called"
socialist countries.
"Band-aids in the form of gov
eminent handouts will not solve
long-term problems," he said.

The speakers from the Review
also downplayed the seriousness
of the problem, asserting that the
U.S. economy has never been in
better shape than today.
While DSA representatives
agreed that "band-aids" are not
a viable solution, they said that
the existence of people who lack
the bare essentials of shelter, food
and medical care is "obscene" in
a society with a standard of living
as high as the United States.

Members of the DSA said that
it is the government's obligation
to provide the safety net that the
private sector has failed to provide
through jobs, money and social
supports.
"When the private economy
fails, handouts are all that some
people have," Boylan said.
He compared the situation to
"banging your head against the
wall When you stop, you feel bet
ter," he said
