Senate to resume INF debate
WASHINGTON — With strong administra
tion assurances that potential loopholes have
been eliminated, Senate leaders agreed last
night to begin final debate on the U.S.-Soviet
treaty limiting intermediate-range nuclear
weapons.
"I am satisfied, and I want to proceed,"
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
said last night after receiving written recom
mendations from the Foreign Relations,
Armed Services and Intelligence committees
to go ahead.
Although the pact, signed last December, is
considered certain to be approved, there was
a question whether the Senate debate could
be wound up in time for President Reagan to
exchange ratification documents with Mikhail
Gorbachev at the forthcoming summit meeting
in Moscow.
Byrd said that the Senate schedule will be
cleared and that full attention will be turned
to the ratification debate until it is completed,
unless the agenda is unavoidably changed.
The delayed decision to send the pact to the
Senate floor was made after Secretary of State
George Shultz and arms negotiators Max Kam
pelman and Maynard Glitman spent several
hours going over details worked out in meet
ings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze last week in Geneva.
A dispute over the procedures to be used
by U.S. inspectors to verify Soviet compliance
with the treaty arose just as the full Senate
was about to take up the agreement and oc
cupied most of Shultz's and Shevardnadze's
time in their last meeting in preparation for
the summit session.
New stock market laws rejected
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion's top financial market regulators yester
day said no new federal laws are needed to
prevent another stock market crash and spe
cifically rejected pleas to curtail stock index
futures trading, which has been blamed for
creating wild swings in the stock market and
scaring away investors.
Refusing to endorse any of the legislative
suggestions made by the Brady Commission
and others, the White House Working Group
on Financial Markets threw the ball back to
Congress, where Democrats said they will push
their own market reform proposals.
The four officials appointed by President
Reagan to seek consensus on new market rules
endorsed only one fundamental change: cre
ating a "circuit breaker" to limit huge drops
in the stock market by shutting down the
stock, stock option and stock index futures
markets for an hour whenever the Dow Jones
industrial average drops by 250 points.
The 250-point trigger to shut the market
was set high, he said, so it would not affect
everyday trading.
