# Senate OKs penalty:
## Pushes death sentence in drug-related killings 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Senate,
responding to a wave of murders
carried out by drug traffickers on
city streets, voted yesterday to
keep alive an election-year pro
posal requiring the death penalty
for persons convicted in drug
related killings.
The 68-27 vote was viewed as
an important test of congressional
sentiment on the death penalty,
even though the measure will
probably not be adopted as part
of a $299.5 billion defense spend
ing bill now being considered in
the Senate.
Co-authored by Sens. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., and others, the
proposal is the latest development
in an election-year crusade by con
servative Republicans in Congress
to dramatize their willingness to
get tough on illegal drug traffick
ing.
Although the vote demonstra
ted strong support for the pro
posal, liberal opponents of the
death penalty vowed to filibuster
as long as necessary to prevent
the Senate from taking a final
vote on the amendment.
D'Amato said that he will decide
today whether to press for a clo
ture vote to break the threatened
filibuster. He noted that yester
day's vote indicates that he would
have little trouble getting the 60
votes necessary to win it.
But Senate Armed Services
Committee Chair Sam Nunn, D-
Ga., sought to persuade D'Amato
to withdraw his amendment on
grounds that the House is un
likely to accept such a provision
in the defense spending bill. Nunn
argued that the D'Amato amend
ment should be adopted, instead,
as part of an anti-drug bill that
is expected to pass Congress later
this year.
The Senate vote demonstrated
a dramatic increase in support for
the death penalty for drug-related

killers. Just two years ago, when
Congress last showed election
year enthusiasm for anti-drug leg
islation, the Senate voted 60-25
to kill a similar amendment.
The amendment would permit
sentences ranging from 20 years
in prison to the death penalty for
persons who carry out narcotics
related murders, for "drug
kingpins" who order such killings,
and for those demonstrating
"reckless indifference for human
life" who participate in the killing
of law enforcement officers in con
nection with criminal drug en
terprises.
D'Amato indicated that his
amendment was inspired by a
number of recent drug-related kil
lings that have claimed innocent
lives or the lives of police officers
in the New York City area â€”
murders that he said were
"tearing up the very fabric of our
society."
"The only thing the death
dealing drug lords fear is death
itself," he said. "... Let's put a
little fear into them instead of
having our citizens live in fear."
But Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
an opponent of capital punish
ment, argued that the D'Amato
amendment is flawed because it
promises the same penalty to drug
dealers who kill other drug
dealers as to those who kill law
enforcement officers. He noted
that most of the victims of drug
related violence are drug dealers
themselves.
"This society should treat kil
ling of a drug dealer differently
from the killing of a police offi
cer,"he said.
Levin also cited a study showing
that American courts wrongfully
convicted 343 people in this cen
tury, 25 of whom were put to
death.
