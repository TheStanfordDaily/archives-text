# Meese fires official
## Justice department shakeup continues 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Attorney General
Edwin Meese Ill's chief press represen
tative, Terry Eastland, announced yes
terday that Meese fired him for failing
to defend the attorney general aggres
sively enough against "any and all
criticism," a move that left even some
of Meese's staunchest supporters
shaking their heads in disbelief.
Eastland, 38, a conservative theo
retician who is highly respected by po
litical appointees and career attorneys
at the Department of Justice as well as
reporters covering the embattled attor
ney general, decided to leave his
$77,500-a-year post immediately even
though Meese had given him 30 days
to do so.
In a letter to Meese, Eastland said
that the department's Office of Public
Affairs, which he headed, "has an obli
gation to serve not only the attorney
general but also the Department of Jus
tice and the American people."
Meese's chief speech writer, William
Schambra, also resigned yesterday, in
protest of Eastland's dismissal.
Schambra said that he found Meese's
action "astonishing," adding that it left
him "perplexed and deeply disturbed."
Several Department of Justice officials
linked Eastland's removal to what they
predicted would be an all-out fight by
Meese in response to an expected report
later this month by independent counsel
James McKay on his year-long investi
gation of the attorney general. The of
ficials said Meese did not believe that
Eastland would be effective in that bat
tle.
Eastland told a press conference that
he knew nothing of such a strategy but
did add: "As I saw things, it would be
difficult for me to be as aggressive as
he might like." He described himself as
"someone who could not be indifferent
to what might be contained in, or flow
from, the independent counsel's report."
McKay has been investigating Meese

on a number of legal matters, including
his role in a controversial $1 billion
Iraqi pipeline project and actions he took
that benefited the scandal-torn Wedtech
Corp. The independent counsel has in
dicated that he is unlikely to indict the
attorney general and will instead issue
a detailed report.
Eastland and Schambra, who was on
leave from the American Enterprise In
stitute, are the third and fourth high
ranking department officials to leave be
cause of Meese's legal troubles. Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns, the de
partment's No. 2 official, and Asst. At
torney General William Weld, chief of
the criminal division, resigned in unison
March 29. Several of their aides quit as
well.
Eastland's removal drew critical com
ments from some of the administration's
leading conservative supporters. One
noted conservative within the Cabinet,
Education Secretary William Bennett,
praised Eastland as "an excellent man"
and offered him a job at his department.
Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., us
ually a key administration ally and the
ranking minority member on the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said he was sur
prised and concerned over Eastland's
dismissal.
Meese likened his dismissal of East
land to a change of management by
Edward Bennett Williams, owner of the
loss-prone Baltimore Orioles. The attor
ney general told colleagues that he
wanted someone as chief press repre
sentative who would get the "Justice
Department's story out."
"Basically, I decided this was a good
time for a change in leadership," Meese
told reporters after Eastland's an
nouncement. "This was a matter basi
cally of my determination that for the
rest of the year we could use some new
leadership, and he was agreeable to
that."
