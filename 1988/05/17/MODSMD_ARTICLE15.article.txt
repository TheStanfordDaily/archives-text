# Reagan approves latest proposal to oust Noriega
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan has personally approved a new
U.S. offer to Manuel Noriega that
would require the Panamanian general
to leave his country for a year but
apparently would allow him to retain
effective control of the government,
administration sources said yesterday.
The sources said that Noriega was
expected to accept or reject the pro
posal within the next day or two.
The offer came as Jose Sorzano, the
top Latin American expert on the
White House National Security Coun
cil staff, resigned in protest against
what he called the administration's
mishandling of the negotiations with

Noriega.
The latest administration plan calls
for Noriega to step down as com
mander of the Panamanian armed
forces in mid-August and to leave
Panama for at least a year.
At the same time, prosecutors would
drop drug trafficking charges pending
against Noriega in Florida and would
agree not to file them again as long
as the general remained in exile. But
the charges could be brought again if
Noriega returned to Panama.
According to the sources, Noriega's
hand-picked president, Manuel Solis
Palma, would be allowed to retain the
office, although the United States

would continue to recognize Eric Del
valle, whom Noriega deposed in Feb
ruary, as the rightful chief of state.
Apparently the plan would permit
allies to retain control of
the armed fol-cea, although one source
said that the Panamanian legislature
would be asked to pass legislation
limiting the military chief to a single
five-year term.
So far, Noriega has ridiculed U.S.
efforts to ease him out of power and
rejected a succession of U.S. proposals.
American negotiators have softened
the terms after each failure.
The latest proposals have been
denounced by Panamanian opposition

leaders who believe that Noriega will
be allowed to continue to hold effective
power. The plans also have been crit
icized in law enforcement circles and
on Capitol Hill because the drug
charges against Noriega would be
dropped.
Michael Kozak, a State Department
official, has been shuttling between
Washington and Panama City, sound
ing out Noriega on various proposals.
According to the sources, however, the
latest plan has Reagan's personal ap
proval, which means that the deal will
be final if Noriega accepts the terms.
