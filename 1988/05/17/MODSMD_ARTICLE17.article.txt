HOW OFTEN does Stanford
think about how it is
viewed as a university?
Once in a while a national pub
lication, like Time magazine, casts
its gaze upon Stanford. Without
fail, the University is portrayed as
a sunny, carefree California school
whose students are stress-free,
laid-back and clean-cut.
The underlying implication of
these characterizations is that
there is no serious intellectual ac
tivity at Stanford.
Without question, Stanford is
world-renowned for its graduate
studies in engineering, business,
law and medicine.
However, a casual observer can't
help but think undergraduate life
is nothing but a four-year Club
Med. Palm trees, aerobics and ar
tificial ponds don't seem to lend
themselves to a high-powered in
stitution.
People familiar with Stanford
and Stanford students know where
the postcard pictures end and
where the truth begins. We know
that Stanford students work hard
and play hard. They just don't like
to show it.
Unfortunately, we still must an
swer questions like "How can you
study in that weather?" or "Isn't
Stanford Ivy League?"
Once the joking stops, that last
question remains to nag Stanford
most of all.
Who and what we are is a ques
tion that is difficult for Stanford
to answer.
Stanford is relatively young com
pared to most major universities
and is pubescent in comparison to
the Ivy League. Stanford is in
search of an identity, a character.
Too many times Stanford defines
itself and evaluates itself according
to the Ivies, Harvard in particular.
One needs only to look around to

see T-shirts that say that Stanford
is the "Harvard of the West." We
all remember Freshman Orienta
tion and the hissing every time
Harvard was mentioned.
Stanford needs to end this Ivy
League insecurity and take a long,
truthful look at itself.
The Time article, like most
others, glossed over the depth and
breadth of character that Stanford
possesses as an institution.
Take a look at the faces of Stan
ford, and one out of every four
will be brown, red, yellow and all
shades in between. Very few major
universities can boast of a fresh
man class with one-third of its
makeup comprised of ethnic mi
norities.
Until recently, Stanford political
activism has been largely over
looked. Stanford is in the forefront
of statewide and nationwide stu
dent political movements.
Stanford is indeed a national and
international university. Stanford
students hail from India, New Jer
sey, Hong Kong and Hawaii. On
how many Ivy League campuses
can one find an Alaska license
plate?
Most importantly, Stanford is
America's bastion of intellect on
the Pacific Rim. The University is
ideally situated in the heart of
silicon-biotech valley. With the
global power focus drifting west
towards Asia, Stanford will be the
marketplace for East-West techno
logical and intellectual exchange.
Stanford has enough to be proud
of without looking over its shoul
der to the East. However, Stanford
must be strong enough to take re
sponsibility for how the University
is viewed, and, at the same time,
be mature enough to define itself
as it chooses — not by the stand
ards of the Ivy League.
