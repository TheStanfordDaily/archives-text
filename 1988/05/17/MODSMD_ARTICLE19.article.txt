## Expel student felons 
### 
IN A recent event on campus, a Stan
ford student was accused of per
petrating a felony against the Book
store. The subsequent University re
sponse to the student's alledged infrac
tion of the law has been flip and careless
at best. Administrators insinuated that
they would be hesitant, even if the young
man is found guilty, to expel him from
the University — after all, as University
Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole was
quoted as saying, "Stanford has always
stressed education over punishment."
Very noble sentiments no doubt, but
they are hardly appropriate. Clearly this
University is not designed or equipped
to be an effective rehabilitation center.
Cole, Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Assoc. Dean Norm Robinson,
or any of our other administrators for
that matter, may prefer the politic role
of lenient guardian. But they might con
sider that a more legitimate responsibility
for them would be to set basic ethical
practices for the student body.
We would all hesitate to have the Uni
versity policing moral standards for stu
dents on this campus; however, as an
institution whose role is to help shape
the consciousness of future American
leaders, it has the obligation not to
tolerate behavior that is beneath the most
basic leve of social acceptance.
The line between what is acceptable
conduct and what is unacceptable con
duct is not hard to draw. For example,
committing a felony — physical assault,
arson, rape — should be mandatory
grounds for dismissal from Stanford,
whether or not these acts victimized
members of the Stanford community.

Similarly, when a student continues to
perform highly anti-social acts within,
and special to, the University, like cheat
ing or destroying dormitory and house
property, the harshest of responses
should be employed.
Stanford is obligated to react for a
variety of reasons, not the least impor
tant of which is that it is under contract
with its students to do so. We've all
signed a pledge called the Fundamental
Standard agreeing that we would act in
ways befitting a Stanford student,
causing no harm to our classmates. In
return, the University pledged that it
would enforce the code, protecting us
from those who would harrass us or do
us harm.
Most students uphold their end of the
deal, but in the several cases where they
have not, the University has failed to
fulfill its part of the bargain.
Cole has said that the University
prefers to avoid expelling its students
even when there are serious violations
of the law and relies instead on "in
definite suspension." Moreover, Cole
said, "if [they] persuade us that [theyl
have learned from their mistakes, they
can come back."
Are our administrators really being
kind when they react with such lack
adaisical indifference to such poor behav
ior? Not at all. While criminals may ap
preciate Cole and Co.'s response, the
average law-abiding Stanford student
suffers. Think of the personal suffering
of the students that had to live with a
roommate who urinated on their clothes
or blockaded them out of their room, or
with a dormmate that destroys dorm

furniture and threatens violence regu
larly (these are real instances).
On a larger level, the University's pres
tige is diminished every time it graduates
people who behave perversely. In the job
marketplace, those people will put at risk
the reputation for quality that Stanford
and its students work so hard to main
tain. As students, we have made many
sacrifices to reap the rewards of the Stan
ford name and the guarantee it gives
employers. Quite simply, those who ha
ven't made the sacrificies don't deserve
the benefits.
Most disturbing, though, is the casual
ness with which our administrators treat
even the most extreme elements of our
community.
Trusting students, pushing them to
take responsibity for their own actions
(as the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code do), is a laudable way to
run a university. However, in order for
the Honor Code and Fundamental Stan
ford to really work, there must be con
sequnces for violating them. If our com
munity doesn't have the guts to insist
on ethical behavior from its members,
the system of values we profess to en
compass is meaningless.
