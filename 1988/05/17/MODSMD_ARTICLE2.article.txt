# Report: Racial bias affected ASSU hiring
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Racial bias was a factor in the selection
process of three ASSU project managers,
according to a report released yesterday.
The Senate Chair's Task Force on ASSU
Staff Hiring said in its report that "insti
tutional racism was apparent" in the se
lection processes for the director of the
Speakers Bureau, chair of the Nominations
Commission, and director of the Office of
Public Affairs. The Black Student Union
had raised question about the selection
processes for all three positions.
"Minority candidates were assumed to
hold certain biases simply because of their
ethnic background, and as a result were
questioned on their involvement in other
student groups, while non-minority groups
were spared this investigation," the report
states.
The report also says that minorities in
ASSU positions are "held to a higher stand
ard of excellence" than non-minorities, in
addition to being "accused of catering to
special interest groups rather than to the
whole Stanford community."
Senate Chair Dave Smolen said that the
report "admits that there are problems"
in the selection process and recommends
a number of measures to eliminate factors
such as race from entering the decision
making procedure. He added that institu
tional racism within the ASSU is a "deeper

problem which we can't sweep under the
carpet."
The task force report made the following
general recommendations for reducing the
role that factors such as race may play in
the selection process:
• Alter the ASSU Bylaws to standardize
the interview and selection process;
• Establish a grievance procedure, under
the existing ASSU structure, for job appli
cants who feel they have been treated un
fairly;
• Improve communication so that job ap
plicants will be fully informed of how the
selection process operates;
• Organize two workshops to improve
the senate's understanding of working in
a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic environ
ment.
The report states that "significant
amendments" to the bylaws are needed to
make the selection committee structure
more systemized and to establish concrete
procedural safeguards against unfair ac
tion. Smolen said the recommendations are
a "continuation of a growing process" for
the ASSU in recent years.
Included in the bylaw changes, which
will be debated at tonight's senate meeting,
is a proposal to increase the size of the
selection committee from thiee members
to five in order to "limit the possible effect
that the biases of any single committee
member may have."
The recommended bylaw
changes also give specifics for
committee makeup, establish a
quorum number of committee
members needed to make deci
sions and expand the number of
appointed positions falling under
the altered bylaws.
The task force also recommends
that the ASSU's administrative
and financial managers prepare a
"timetable" for selection proc
esses early in the year
In addition, the report advises
that interviewing committees
"draft a uniform set of questions
for each group of interviews" to
prevent racially biased questions
from entering the interview proc
ess.
