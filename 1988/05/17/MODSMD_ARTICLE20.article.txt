## Misogynous decorations mar two fraternity parties 
### 
ON SATURDAY May 14, a few
people from our dorm attended
parties at the Taxi and KA
houses. We went to dance and enjoy
the music, not to confirm any
stereotypes.
At the Taxi house we found our
selves dancing next to a mural of a
gladiator holding a whip and a sword
with the words, "I'm a gladiator,
where's my wench?" Because there
were pens and paper readily accessible
to the people at the party, we don't
know if the Taxis or a party goer
wrote those words on the wall. But
that does not make it more acceptable

Although it was disturbing, we ignored
it and continued to have a good time
dancing.
However, later at the KA house we
discovered something we simply could
not ignore. We arrived at the house
just after the party had ended.
On our way out we discovered a
nude female mannequin whose breasts,
torso and thighs were smeared with
red, lying in the middle of the floor
next to the bar. This cannot be dis
missed as a drunken student who
spilled a red drink on the mannequin;
it was stained in such a way that the

mannequin looked like the victim of a
sexual assault.
We do not know who attended this
party or the circumstances under
which the mannequin was introduced.
Although it is possible the mannequin
belonged to someone outside the frater
nity, we feel the KAs must have
created an atmosphere which made a
"bloody" mannequin permissible.
Furthermore, why was it just left
lying on the floor with the empty beer
bottles and discarded decorations?
We invite the KAs and Taxis to
explain why they tolerated and con-

doned these highly destructive symbols
of violence against women at their
parties.
We believe that this sexist behavior
should not be allowed to occur in
University-owned housing.
As Stanford students, we have the
right to enjoy ourselves in an atmos
phere in which we don't have to close
our eyes to what is written on the
walls.
