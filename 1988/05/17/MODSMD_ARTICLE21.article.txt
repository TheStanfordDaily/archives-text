# BSU contributes to Farm awareness
## 
### 
I have read many (too many) letters
to The Daily criticizing the activities of
the Black Student Union, but Ronald
Shelby's May 9 letter really takes the
cake. Shelby's claim that the BSU "has
not positively contributed to commu
nity awareness of the problems of
being a minority in American society
today" infuriates me.
Stanford's BSU is, as far as I am
concerned, one of the most active, ef
fective and positive organizations on
this campus, and it really disturbs me
to see so few people willing to admit
it.
Shelby seems to continuously charge
that the programs of the BSU are too
"autonomous," "exclusive" and "mis
directed"; yet, he provides us with only
one poor example of his discontent. He
was disturbed by the BSU's approach
to Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday
celebration, for the focus was on a
"black martyr" rather than the contin
ual efforts of the civil rights move
ment.

I admit King wasn't the only civil
rights leader, and it is unfortunate
that Americans do not know more
about the other leaders such as Ella
Baker and Marcus Garvey (maybe the
new CIV course will pull us out of our
ignorance). But King has become the
symbol for the civil rights movement
and does deserve our recognition and
admiration on his birthday.
Even if I except Shelby's arguments
against the King celebrations, he has
provided me only one "negative" pro
gram on which to judge the BSU. Sor
ry, but I can list a number of
"positive" contributions the BSU has
made to Stanford that have enriched
my Stanford experience.
Bravo to the BSU for its efforts and
success in passing the Area One "Cul
tures, Ideas and Values" proposal; the
entire Western Culture debate brought
great "awareness of the problems of
being a minority in American society
today" (if I may use Shelby's phrase)
and will hopefully increase interest and
enrollment in minority studies in the
coming years. We all can benefit from
academic improvement in these areas.
Bravo to the BSU on its work with
Project Democracy, a Southern voter

registration drive that took place in
January. Although this did not occur
at Stanford, I have learned a lot about
minorities in the South by the articles
I have read and discussions I have had
with students who went on the trip.
Bravo to the BSU for its "chill
outs," its Soul Food Dinner and Stan
funk. These are only a few of the
social programs I am sure the BSU
sponsors, and contrary to popular
belief, they are open to everyone.
The BSU expends great energy in
trying to attract and welcome non
blacks to the black community and is
certainly not "an exclusive organiza
tion." As a friend of mine put it: The
BSU does send out invitations to the
entire campus, but you can not expect
its members to knock on everyone's
doors individually and drag them to
the party.
And last, on Saturday, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson spoke at Stanford, his
second time in less than 18 months.
Certainly this could not be done with
out the efforts of the BSU, working
cooperatively with other organizations,
and no one can claim that bringing
Jackson to Stanford is not a "positive"
program.

These programs are only a few of
the many that I am sure the BSU
helps to organize. I am not a member
of the BSU, but since coming to Stan
ford I have become aware of and in
volved with minority problems and
issues in the past two years, and or
ganizations like the BSU are a vital
necessity to keep this awareness and
education going. Without these organi
zations, minority issues would not be
addressed at all.
1 am very sorry that Shelby does not
feel he has learned about minority
issues in his two years here, and I am
sorry he feels the BSU takes the
wrong approach. If he really is con
cerned I hope he has started some
programs on his own; blacks should
not be the only ones interested in
black issues, just as all people should
be interested in diversifying and ex
panding their community. Otherwise
he should stop criticizing the BSU, for
it has more important things to do
with its time than respond to sharp
arguments against it that have no
substantial backbone.
