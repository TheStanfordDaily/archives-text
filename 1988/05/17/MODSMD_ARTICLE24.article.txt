After an atypical quarter of
gray, gloomy weather, spring
has finally sprung at Stanford
on Saturday and Sunday. And
a plethora of pleasant events
greeted the sunshine and blue
skies.

The weekend burst into
action with the Dance Depart
ment's production of Spring
Migration, a lively look at
Stanford's most talented dan
cers. Also helping to drum up
a diverse weekend, over 8,000
Native Americans participated
in the 17th Annual Stanford
Powwow, a three-day social
and spiritual gathering of
different tribes from across
the United States and Canada.
The sun sizzled on an esti

mated 7,000 spectators who
waited over two hours in 90-
degree weather to hear Dem
ocratic presidential candidate
Jesse Jackson speak at a
statewide educational confer
ence on Saturday. The week
end came to full blossom at
Sunday's seventh annual Stan
ford Special Olympics. More
than 200 student volunteers
came out to cheer on men
tally retarded athletes in
swimming competitions that

left everyone feeling like win
ners.
Although yesterday was yet
again a dreary day, hopefully
the memories of one of Stan
ford's brightest weekends will
beckon the sun back for good
