## Final authority on the Draw: The Bug speaks 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
Dear Andrew,
A friend of mine (who happens
to be my Resident Assistant) and
I were sitting around the other
day and somehow got to talking
about the Flintstones. We started
talking about the theme song and
one of us (exactly who is unimpor
tant) mentioned that we never
knew the line that comes after,
"Let's ride with the family down
the street." The other said some
thing like, "I never knew either."
And, no one in Loro, and the rest
of Flo Mo, knew either. We
decided that there might not be
anyone in the world who knew —
save yourself — so we're writing.
— George and Jane Jetson

I knew if I kept at this long
enough someone would ask me to
print song lyrics. But the Flint
stones? For Pete's sake, isn't
there anything to do in Flo Mo?
Oh what the heck, who am I
to judge? Gather 'round, pick up
your kazoos (Flintstones' theme
song must be played on kazoo),
and sing along.
Meet the Flintstones:
Flintstones, meet the Flint

stones, they're the modern stone
age family
From the town of Bedrock,
they 're a page right out of history
Let's ride with the family down
the street
Through the courtesy of Fred's
swift feet
When you're with the Flint
stones, have a yabba dabba doo
time, a dabba doo time, we'll have
a gay old time
Flintstones, meet the Flint
stones, they're the modern stone
age family
From the town of Bedrock,
they're a page right out of history
Someday maybe Fred will win
the fight
Then that cat will stay out for
the night
When you're with the Flint
stones, have a yabba dabba doo
time, a dabba doo time, we'll have
a gay old time
We'll have a gay old time.
Glad to be of service.
Hey you slimy bug here's a ques
tion for you.
Well, it seems that me and
several other victims of this insti
tution called the Draw, which is
merely a covert operation executed
by the authorities to dispel the
existing state of dishonorables
who indulge in crack . . . well any
way i and probably countless other
equiring (sic) minds would like
to know what all this assignable
pool stuff is anyway, french house
is on my draw card and i didn't
get assigned yet the french house
has vacancies and it's all because
i got put in the unassignable pool.
Since when did i become a fish
anyway.
— I fought the draw and the draw
won
In your case, the Housing office

didn't put you in the French
house because you have a com
plete inability to punctuate Eng
lish sentences. How do you expect
to get about in a French environ
ment with this deficiency, seeing
as how French has 20 or 30 times
as many punctuation marks as
English?
In fact, French would be pro
nounced just like English if it
weren't for those punctuation
marks. That is why French
women sound so sexy when they
speak. The punctuation forces
them to wind their lips and tongue
into all kinds of erotic postions.
But don't just listen to me, go
out and test it for yourself. The
next time you hear someone
speaking French, go right up and
kiss them. As long as they don't
beat you to a pulp, you will find

this very erotic, especially if they
are saying something with a lot
of punctuation marks, such as,
"Soupe du jour s'il vous plait."
(Translation: "Say, did you see
the play?")
But this was not your question.
After a week of intense research
I am now one of two people on
campus who understand the com
plete complexities of The Draw.
For your convenience I will list
below the complete procedure
used by the housing computer for
assigning people through the
draw:
First, the computer computes
the assignable pool by taking as
many men as there are spaces for
men, and as many women as there
are spaces for women. Priorities
have no effect on determining the

assignable pool. This year, the last
man in the assignable pool held
number 2,912, while the last
woman held 3,447. If you had a
draw number higher than this you
could not be assigned on the first
round regardless of your priorities
— even returning resident prio
rity.
Once the assignable pool is de
termined there should theoreti
cally be exactly as many people
as there are places. At this point
priorities kick in, and students
are assigned to specific residences
as follows: if two people have the
same priority to a house, the per
son with the lower draw number
gets in; if one person has a better
priority, he gets in over the other
person regardless of the draw
number.
The computer will go down your
list of choices and try to stick you
into houses that you have selec
ted. If it gets to the end of your
choices and has been unable to
assign you because your number
is too high and your priorities
don't beat anyone, then you will
be assigned randomly to any res
idence with open spaces if you
checked "Assign me to any resi
dence" on your draw card.
Now here's the confusing part:
Students are not assigned to a
special priority theme house un
less they list it on their draw card
and have a priority. There are
empty spaces in the French house
because there weren't enough
people in the assignable pool who
had the French house on their
draw card with priorities. You
didn't get into the French house
because you simply weren't in the
assignable pool.
The reason it works this way
is that the special theme houses
do not want random shmucks
placed in their houses who aren't
generally interested in the theme
and overall atmosphere of the

house.
Between the first and second
rounds, men drop out to join fra
ternities and both sexes drop out
to become RAs or to face criminal
prosecution stemming from
charges of ASSU election fraud.
This opens up more spaces,
usually about 400. The next 400
lowest draw numbers, mostly
men, are added to the assignable
pool from the draw numbers.
Once the second assignable pool
has been determined, the com
puter goes through again and tries
to reassign everyone. Don't worry,
you cannot move down on your
draw card in the second round.
Even if someone has a better pri
ority to the house you were as
signed to on the first round, he
cannot bump you out of there.
You will only move out of your
first round assignment if there is
space available in a house you
ranked higher on your draw card.
On rare occasions, men with
returning residence priority will
not be in the assignable pool until
round two and then find that
there is no space in their return
ing residence because no one as
signed there in round one can
move up. The Housing center says
it is "virtually guaranteed" that
they will find a way to get the
returning resident back into their
house in such a case.
Finally, if the special priority
theme houses still haven't filled
after the second round, they are
filled from the waiting list during
the summer or fall.
That's about all there is to it.
My recommendation: Don't lose
any sleep over it. All will be
revealed a week from today, and
chances are high that you'll live
somewhere yucky next year.
Cheers!

Bug Me appears every Tuesday,
'til death do us partly.
