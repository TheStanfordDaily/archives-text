## It's family day at the ballpark 
### 
Ed Sprague concentrates on
the batter and waits for the
pitch. He's not bracing for a
shot at third, though, but in
stead is studying the hitter's
bat speed and strength.
As a scout for the Baltimore
Orioles, Ed Sprague, Sr., com
bines business with pleasure
when he watches his son, Ed
Sprague, Jr., Stanford's start
ing third baseman, play at
Sunken Diamond.

Sprague is one of 18 scouts
scouring the nation for the
Orioles, and he's responsible
for Northern California and all
of Nevada excluding Las Vegas.
It's a fertile area for both high
school and college baseball tal
ent, and Sprague's eye has
been honed by years of exper
ience as a Major League
pitcher, minor league instruc
tor and minor league team
owner. Sprague knows his
baseball talent, and he knows
what he's looking for.
"Basically you break it down
into what kind of tools the kids
have," Sprague said Saturday
at Sunken Diamond. "It's not
just performance. We're
looking for the best athlete we
can possibly get. Can he run?
Can he throw? Can he hit with
power? Can he field?
"Then you break it down by
position. At first base, for in
stance, you're not so much con
cerned about his arm as his
fielding, and he has to be able
to hit home runs."
Sprague looks for different
qualities in players at each po
sition, but one constant he
v likes to see in fitters is power.
"In college there are a lot of
guys that hit the ball that 1
don't think will hit in pro ball,"
Sprague said. "They're defen
sive hitters. I'm a power-source
guy. I played on clubs with
Johny Bench, Hank Aaron and
Reggie Jackson."
Sprague also looks for power

in pitchers. A youngster can be
taught a curve or slider, but a
lively arm is a prerequisite.
"I look for a fastball and
movement on a fastball,"
Sprague said. "Most of the time
I'm looking at sheer arm
strength. Lefthanded pitchers
are different, particularly if
they have a fastball that runs
off the plate."
Of course, all the physical
tools in the world don't make
up for a bad attitude.
"It's not easy," Sprague said
of the road to the majors. "You
have to have an even temper
ament. It's a game of consis
tency over a period of time. A
lot of times you see a player
without a lot of skills but great
makeup, and he makes it to
the majors."
Eventually, though, as
Sprague said, "Most scouting
is a gut feeling."
Most Stanford homestands
find Sprague in attendance,
watching his son and scouting
the Cardinal and its opponents.
Several Stanford players are el
igible for the draft this year,
and Sprague likes what he sees.
The top prospect is Ed, Jr.,
a junior in eligibility, and some
observers are calling him the
best hitter in Stanford history.
The younger Sprague leads the
Pacific 10 Conference South
ern Division with 19 home
runs.
Ed Sprague, Sr., naturallv
feels a bit of fatherly pride in
his namesake, but he echoes
all the scouts in saying, "I
think he'll be within the first
45 players taken. In my per
sonal opinion, I think he can
play third and be a good first
baseman. He could be an im
pact player at catcher.
"If the situation arises where
it's good for Eddie to leave
school, I'll back him 100 per
cent."
Part of Sprague's job, there
fore, involves spending many
of his spring afternoons watch
ing a Stanford baseball team
that boasts a wealth of poten
tial pro talent, including his
son who stands to be a high
draft pick. It's understandable
then when Sprague says, "It's
an interesting business. I enjoy
it. I sold three businesses, and
I just enjoy it."
