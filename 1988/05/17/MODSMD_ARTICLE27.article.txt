# Blackman proving to be money player
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Stanford at USC, April 15. The
No. 1 national men's tennis
ranking on the line. Match tied,
4-4. Hostile Trojan crowd scream
ing obscenities. Momentum: USC.
In the final match, USC's doubles
tandem of Murphy Jensen and
Scott Brownsburger twice have
set points against Cardinal senior
Patrick McEnroe and his partner,
freshman Martin Blackman. Not
exactly the most comfortable
place for a freshman to be playing.
But for Blackman, there was
no better place to be. He and
McEnroe came up with enough
clutch shots to pull out the match,
7-6 (10-8), 6-2 and give Stanford
a 5-4 win. The victory preserved
the Cardinal's perfect Pacific 10
Conference record (Stanford
ended up 10-0 for the year) and
helped lock up the top seed at
this week's NCAA Champion
ships.
But more importantly, the win
showed the college tennis world
what kind of talent Blackman has.
It spoke of the outstanding future
he has ahead of him. And it said
that Blackman will be a key man
in Stanford's bid to recapture the
NCAA title beginning May 20.
Is it unusual for a freshman to
play such an important role on a
potent team like Stanford? Not
entirely — the Cardinal has been
paced to success through the
years by such talented rookies as
John McEnroe, not to mention
Blackman's teammate, freshman
David Wheaton.
But in a time where black
players have successfully integra
ted the playing fields of many
other college sports, to find a
prominent black player such as
Blackman on the tennis court is
rare.
So why is Blackman playing ball
on the tennis court instead of an
other court? One reason is that
unlike many excellent U.S. ath
letes, black or otherwise, Black

man grew up in a country, Bar
bados, where there weren't that
many sports to play.
"In other countries, the better
athletes are more likely to get
into tennis because they don't
have so many other professional
sports to play," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said.
So, Blackman didn't have the
impulse, as many of the best ath
letes reared in the United States
have, to turn to the more
prominent sports: basketball,
baseball and football.
As Blackman, a gifted all
around athlete, observe!, "If I had
been in a different situation, who
knows? I might not be playing
tennis right now."
After looking at how Blackman
performs in pressure tennis situ
ations, it's hard to imagine him
in any other sport. The no-ad
scoring and final-set tie-breaker
of college tennis especially lend
themselves to a player who thrives
on pressure situations. Blackman
has showed how he can respond
in tough spots many times, most
notably in the deciding match at
USC.
"In a big match he comes
through," McEnroe said. "Martin
likes that; he likes to have the
match on the line."
"He's able to pull out the big
shots when he needs to," Stanford
freshman Glenn Solomon said,
"That's what makes him unique
among the big hitters."
Playing at the No. 4 slot on the
Stanford singles ledger, Blackman
has the added pressure that he is
always expected to win.
"He's done a great job in
playing in that situation, which
is a compliment because it's a
hard situation," Gould said. "At
No. 3, 4, and 5 you always put it
on the line."
What's more, with Stanford
playing in what many regard to
be the nation's toughest confer
ence, he has had more competi
tion than he expected.
"I kind of thought the standard

wouldn't be that high," Blackman
noted, "but I'd have to say the
standard of college tennis is very
high. There's a lot of depth, and
that kind of competition improves
you."
One place where that improve
ment has been shown the most
is in Blackman's consistency.
While, as Gould said, Blackman
is "a great natural talent" whose
strengths are quickness and
power, that style of play is prone

to ups and downs. But this year
he has been able to come through
for the Cardinal match after
match.
"He's been one of the most solid
guys we've had out there,"
Solomon said.
Maybe the biggest area of im
provement this season has been
his doubles game. Blackman said
that when he came to Stanford

he wasn't a good doubles player.
Said McEnroe: "He's improved
a lot in doubles. I feel confident
playing with him."
It's been a long road for Black
man. He debuted on the national
junior circuit at age 12.
After heading to Florida for
high school, Blackman won the
boys 16s Junior Nationals and
reached the semifinals of the U.S.
Open Junior tournament. Last
year, he played both pro and
junior events, qualifying and win
ning a round of a professional
tournament in Philadelphia.
A top junior player, Blackman
is also an alumnus of Nick Bol
lettieri's famous Florida tennis
school, the same school that grad
uated fellow freshman phenom
Wheaton. And like Wheaton,
Blackman is faced with the temp
tation of possible professional suc
cess. But Blackman seems set on
staying in college for the time
being.
"I think I needed college to im

prove on my tennis and just to
mature a little," Blackman said.
"For the experience, I think it
will be well worth going through.
Not that there's any rush.
Blackman is young — he still has
a year of playing junior 18s to go
— and he wants to play in the
Wimbledon Junior Champion
ships in June. And he can still
continue his rapid climb up the
college ranks. Blackman has qual
ified for the NCAA singles cham
pionships and is ranked 48th na
tionally.
Indeed, as the NCAA Champi
onships begin, Blackman has no
more important occupation than
to help Stanford toward the title.
The tournament will again be held
in Athens, Ga., a place notorious
for its fanatical crowd and high
pressure.
"We have a lot of confidence,
but we know how tough the com
petition is," Blackman said. "The
NCAAs are what we work for all
year — we'd trade all our season
success for the team champion
ship."
"I think Martin will play his
best tennis of the year there,"
Gould said.

his doubles game. Blackman said

After coming to Stanford as one of the top recruits in the nation,
freshman Martin Blackman has been almost unbeatable this season
In both singles and doubles.
he wasn't a good doubles player.
Said McEnroe: "He's improved
a lot in doubles. I feel confident
playing with him."
It's been a long road for Black
man. He debuted on the national
junior circuit at age 12.
After heading to Florida for
high school, Blackman won the
boys 16s Junior Nationals and
reached the semifinals of the U.S.
Open Junior tournament. Last
year, he played both pro and
junior events, qualifying and win
ning a round of a professional
tournament in Philadelphia.
A top junior player, Blackman
is also an alumnus of Nick Bol
lettieri's famous Florida tennis
school, the same school that grad
uated fellow freshman phenom
Wheaton. And like Wheaton,
Blackman is faced with the temp
tation of possible professional suc
cess. But Blackman seems set on
staying in college for the time
being.
"I think I needed college to im

prove on my tennis and just to
mature a little," Blackman said.
"For the experience, I think it
will be well worth going through.
Not that there's any rush.
Blackman is young — he still has
a year of playing junior 18s to go
— and he wants to play in the
Wimbledon Junior Champion
ships in June. And he can still
continue his rapid climb up the
college ranks. Blackman has qual
ified for the NCAA singles cham
pionships and is ranked 48th na
tionally.
Indeed, as the NCAA Champi
onships begin, Blackman has no
more important occupation than
to help Stanford toward the title.
The tournament will again be held
in Athens, Ga., a place notorious
for its fanatical crowd and high
pressure.
"We have a lot of confidence,
but we know how tough the com
petition is," Blackman said. "The
NCAAs are what we work for all
year — we'd trade all our season
success for the team champion
ship."
"I think Martin will play his
best tennis of the year there,"
Gould said.
Stanford at USC, April 15. The
No. 1 national men's tennis
ranking on the line. Match tied,
4-4. Hostile Trojan crowd scream
ing obscenities. Momentum: USC.
In the final match, USC's doubles
tandem of Murphy Jensen and
Scott Brownsburger twice have
set points against Cardinal senior
Patrick McEnroe and his partner,
freshman Martin Blackman. Not
exactly the most comfortable
place for a freshman to be playing.
But for Blackman, there was
no better place to be. He and
McEnroe came up with enough
clutch shots to pull out the match,
7-6 (10-8), 6-2 and give Stanford
a 5-4 win. The victory preserved
the Cardinal's perfect Pacific 10
Conference record (Stanford
ended up 10-0 for the year) and
helped lock up the top seed at
this week's NCAA Champion
ships.
But more importantly, the win
showed the college tennis world
what kind of talent Blackman has.
It spoke of the outstanding future
he has ahead of him. And it said
that Blackman will be a key man
in Stanford's bid to recapture the
NCAA title beginning May 20.
Is it unusual for a freshman to
play such an important role on a
potent team like Stanford? Not
entirely — the Cardinal has been
paced to success through the
years by such talented rookies as
John McEnroe, not to mention
Blackman's teammate, freshman
David Wheaton.
But in a time where black
players have successfully integra
ted the playing fields of many
other college sports, to find a
prominent black player such as
Blackman on the tennis court is
rare.
So why is Blackman playing ball
on the tennis court instead of an
other court? One reason is that
unlike many excellent U.S. ath
letes, black or otherwise, Black

man grew up in a country, Bar
bados, where there weren't that
many sports to play.
"In other countries, the better
athletes are more likely to get
into tennis because they don't
have so many other professional
sports to play," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said.
So, Blackman didn't have the
impulse, as many of the best ath
letes reared in the United States
have, to turn to the more
prominent sports: basketball,
baseball and football.
As Blackman, a gifted all
around athlete, observe!, "If I had
been in a different situation, who
knows? I might not be playing
tennis right now."
After looking at how Blackman
performs in pressure tennis situ
ations, it's hard to imagine him
in any other sport. The no-ad
scoring and final-set tie-breaker
of college tennis especially lend
themselves to a player who thrives
on pressure situations. Blackman
has showed how he can respond
in tough spots many times, most
notably in the deciding match at
USC.
"In a big match he comes
through," McEnroe said. "Martin
likes that; he likes to have the
match on the line."
"He's able to pull out the big
shots when he needs to," Stanford
freshman Glenn Solomon said,
"That's what makes him unique
among the big hitters."
Playing at the No. 4 slot on the
Stanford singles ledger, Blackman
has the added pressure that he is
always expected to win.
"He's done a great job in
playing in that situation, which
is a compliment because it's a
hard situation," Gould said. "At
No. 3, 4, and 5 you always put it
on the line."
What's more, with Stanford
playing in what many regard to
be the nation's toughest confer
ence, he has had more competi
tion than he expected.
"I kind of thought the standard

wouldn't be that high," Blackman
noted, "but I'd have to say the
standard of college tennis is very
high. There's a lot of depth, and
that kind of competition improves
you."
One place where that improve
ment has been shown the most
is in Blackman's consistency.
While, as Gould said, Blackman
is "a great natural talent" whose
strengths are quickness and
power, that style of play is prone

to ups and downs. But this year
he has been able to come through
for the Cardinal match after
match.
"He's been one of the most solid
guys we've had out there,"
Solomon said.
