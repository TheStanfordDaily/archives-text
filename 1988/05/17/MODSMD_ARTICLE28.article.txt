# Three women make sweet 16

LOS ANGELES - Teri Whit
linger has good reason to be
confident that she can win the
national singles title this week
at UCLA. The one player who
would be a definite favorite to
beat the Stanford freshman is

not playing in the tournament.
That person would be Tami Whitlinger, who
just happens to be Teri's twin sister. "She's
the one person who has a total psych job on
me," Teri said yesterday after beating UCLA's
Kirsten Dreyer 6-3, 6-2 to advance to this
morning's third round of the NCAA singles
tournament. Whitlinger will be joined in the
third round by teammates Lisa Green and
Kay Tittle.
Tami Whitlinger has beaten Teri every time
the two have played since they were 10 years
old. But Tami is not playing this week because
of a groin injury.
"The one national tournament I won when
I was in the 16s was when Tami lost in the
quarterfinals," Teri said. "My dad said, 'Teri,
the one person you always lose to is out of
the tournament, so go out and win.' "
Duke's Susan Sabo and UCLA's Dreyer
don't have eight-year winning streaks against
Teri, but each had beaten the Cardinal fresh
man the last time they played. So Whitlinger
was initially a little worried when she saw
that the draw had her playing Sabo in the
first round and Dreyer in the second.
"But the more I started to think about it,
I didn't play well the first time, so more or
less I wasn't nervous (yesterday). I felt excited
and challenged," Whitlinger said.
Sabo, who beat Whitlinger in straight sets
when they played last Thursday in the team
tournament, matched groundstrokes with
Whitlinger early in the first set of their match.
But she eventually began to tire as Whitlinger
chased her from side to side. The second set
was over quickly as Whitlinger prevailed 6-3,
6-1.
In the second round, Whitlinger fell behind
2-0 in the first set against Dreyer, who beat
her 6-0, 6-0 April 15 at Stanford. "I started
off and I was down two-love, and then I won
a game and I said, well it's not going to be
O and O," Whitlinger said.
Dreyer has a reputation as a steady baseline
player, but Whitlinger had too much firepower
for the UCLA freshman as she recorded a
6-3, 6-2 victory.
Whitlinger will meet another familiar face
in a 10 a.m. third-round match today. She
will be pitted against Florida's fourth-seeded
Shaun Stafford, who she beat 6-4, 6-2 Sunday
in the team championship match.
"She's seeded ahead of me, but she's prob
ably going to feel like I did going into these
two matches (against Sabo and Dreyer),"
Whitlinger said.
Whitlinger may be happy to be in the third
round, but nobody was more pleased to win
her first two matches than Tittle. As soon as
she finished beating USC's Lupita Novelo in
the second round, Tittle made a beeline for
the tournament desk to make sure that she
had earned All-America status for the first

time in her four years at Stanford by advanc
ing to the round of 16.
When coaches and tournament officials as
sured her that she is an All-American, Tittle
let loose with high-fives and hugs. "That was
my goal all year," she said.
Tittle became an All-American by virtue of
a routine 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 first-round victory
over Notre Dame's Cece Cahill and a scintil
lating 6-2, 6-2 demolition of Novelo.
Tittle said she was mentally and physically
exhausted after Sunday's conclusion of the
team tournament, but she was motivated by
the knowledge that the singles tournament
will be her last competitive tennis. "I was
definitely thinking about it, knowing if I lose
this is it," she said.
Tittle has at least one more match left in
her tennis career, this morning against Cal
ifornia's Karen Shin. If she wins, she will
move into the quarterfinals. If she loses, she
will at long last give her battle-weary knees
some rest.
"After playing on them for a while they get

really bad," Tittle said. "I think it's time to
move on and try something different — like
windsurfing and skiing."
Card notes
As expected, Green moved into the third round
with a pair of wins yesterday. The sophomore beat
Texas Christian's Tory Plunkett 6-3, 6-2 and then
rallied for a 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory over Maryland's
Claudia Borgiani.
Green will be tested this morning by USC's
Trisha Laux, the No. 2 seed. Laux defeated Green
in Saturday's team semifinal 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.
Stanford's other singles entrants fell in the first
day of competition. Junior Eleni Rossides was
upended by Duke's Fatti O'Reilly 6-2, 7-5 in the
first round.
Freshman Sandra Birch beat UCLA's Joni Urban
6-1, 7-5 in the first round but then was eliminated
by Florida's third-seeded Halle Cioffi 6-2, 6-1.
In doubles, Stanford's Birch and Can Hagey, the
No. 5 seeds, moved into today's second round with
a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory over BYU's Susanna Lee
and Sydney Fulford.
