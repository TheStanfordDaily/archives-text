# Baseball in NCAAs; Card must travel
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team
will go on the road for NCAA
regional play, but the team's
destination is as yet unknown.
The NCAA yesterday an
nounced all of the sites and
about half of the participants
for the eight regional tourna
ments that will begin next
Wednesday and Thursday.
Stanford, which finished the
season at 37-21 overall and 18-
12 in league play, was one of
22 teams named to the 48-team
tournament field yesterday.
The rest of the field and final
tournament assignments and
seedings will be announced
next Monday, after various
make-up games and conference
tournaments have been com
pleted.
The Cardinal will not know
where it will go for tournament
play until then.
The two Western regionals
will be played at Arizona State
and Fresno State, but it's likely
that the Cardinal will be
shipped out to a regional east
of the Rockies.
The NCAA "is going to have
to send a team from the West
out — send them back East —
and with our record in our
league, I would think we'd be
the logical choice at this time,"
Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said on Saturday.
Despite sweeping USC in a
three-game Pacific 10 Confer
ence Southern Division series
last weekend to lock up second
place in the conference, Stan
ford hardly moved in the na
tional polls this week, moving
up one slot to No. 9 in the
ESPN/Collegiate Baseball poll
and remaining at No. 9 in the
Baseball America list.
Still, the Cardinal has a
chance of being named one of
the top eight seeded teams,

meaning that it would be the
top seed in one of the eight
regionals and wouldn't have to
play any other top seeds to get
to the College World Series.
"If we get a chance to be a
No. 1 seed ... that will open
up a lot of opportunities for
us," junior first baseman Ron
Witmeyer said.
Other Western teams named
to the field yesterday include
Six-Pac champion Arizona
State, Pacific Coast Athletic
Association champ Fresno
State and West Coast Athletic
Conference champion Pepper
dine.
Following are the eight sites,
host schools and dates for the
regional tournaments:
• West I: Fresno (Fresno
State), May 26-30;
• West II: Tempe, Ariz. (Ar
izona State), May 26-30;
• East: Tallahassee, Fla.
(Florida State), May 25-29;
• Atlantic: Miami, Fla.
(Miami), May 25-29;
• South: Starkville, Miss.
(Mississippi State), May 26-30;
• Midwest: Stillwater, Okla.
(Oklahoma State), May 26-30;
• Central: Austin, Texas
(Texas), May 26-30;
• Northeast: New Britain,
Conn, (hosted by a consortium
of schools), May 26-30.

Stanford sophomore rightfielder
Paul Carey was named the Player
of the Week in the Six-Pac last
week. In the three wins over USC
and a 23-2 thrashing of San Fran
cisco State last Tuesday, Carey was
9 for 16 with three home runs and
nine RBI. He now has 11 home
runs and 51 RBI for the season.
Arizona State moved up to No.
1 in the ESPN/Collegiate Baseball
poll this week, displacing Okla
homa State. The Cowboys re
mained in the top spot in the Baae
