# MEChA snubs efforts to unify Latinos
## 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
A boycott by 82 students last
night undermined efforts by
members of Stanford's Latino
community to set up an umbrella
organization to coordinate the
community's activities.
The Latino community has
been struggling in recent months
for cohesive organization, and last
night's emotion-filled meeting
brought little resolution to con
flicts within the group.
Originally designed to discuss
two proposals submitted for con

sideration by the Latino commu
nity here, members of MEChA
boycotted the discussion and
withdrew their proposal because
of frustration that the community
is divided into too many factions.
The proposals were submitted
last month by MEChA, the most
established Latino group on
campus, and the Stanford Latino
Student Alliance Committee, a
group that is trying to establish
itself as an umbrella organization
for all Latino groups.
Debate centers around creation
of an all-encompassing body to
address the needs of the commu

nity.
While MEChA does not support
construction of a unifying group
at this time because of tensions
it sees plaguing the community,
its leaders say they hope tensions
will subside and formation of a
larger group will take place next
year.
Lucky Gutierrez, a senior and
MEChA member, said the com
munity "needs a cooling-off peri
od."
The SaLSA Committee adv
ocates an umbrella organization
that will join diverse elements of
the Latino community often

estranged from MEChA, which
claims that it does not try to rep
resent all members of the Latino
community.
One student participating in the
discussion last night cited
MEChA's focus on Chicano issues
as a barrier to students of other
Latino groups.
Senior Alberto Hernandez, a
resident assistant at Casa Zapata
told the group of 50 students at
the meeting he felt that unity was
required before a structure could
be chosen. He posed a rhetorical
question: "Are we going to try to
convince ourselves that structure
will lead to unity?"
Senior Rudy Fuentes, a leader
of the SaLSA Committee, said
many members of the Latino com
munity here feel they are not a
part of MEChA, and that the new
SaLSA Committee proposal exists
to unify the community.
An audience member chal
lenged the motives of the boycot
ting students. "If they (the
boycotting students) want unity,
if they want to talk, why aren't
they here?" the student asked.
The 82 students who boycotted
the meeting signed a petition
charging that "What could have
been a useful and productive at
tempt to unify the community has

been turned into a confusing
debate."
"The unification of our commu
nity will not begin on the basis
of a vote that is won by a slim
margin," the petition says.
Four representatives of the
boycotting students attended the
meeting in order to explain the
students' position.
The Latino community at Stan
ford has been struggling since fall
quarter to decide how it should
organize itself. Critics of the proc
ess, such as Gutierrez, charge that
the "disruptive and bitter proc
ess" has furthered division in the
community.
Casa Zapata resident fellow
Cecilia Burciaga, who opened the
discussion, attributed the unifica
tion difficulties to "a malaise in
the community."
Latino students today "have
one of the most deep-seated
hatreds I've seen in this commu

nity," she said.
The SaLSA Committee proposal
gives three arguments for its im
plementation:
• Growth in the Latino student
population and activity in recent
years necessitates a structure for
new students to become involved;
• Continuity and accountability
in the community's activities
would be assured by an umbrella
organization;
• Such an organization would
act as a unified voice for the
Latino community.
The proposal suggests that
there be an elected board of eight
officials, a core committee of one
representative from every active
organization in the Latino com
munity, and regular community
meetings.
MEChA, which is currently the
political cornerstone of the Latino
community here, has little organ
izational structure.
