# MEChA snubs efforts to unify Latinos

A boycott by 82 students last
night undermined efforts by
members of Stanford's Latino
community to set up an umbrella
organization to coordinate the
community's activities.

been struggling in recent months
for cohesive organization, and last
night's emotion-filled meeting
brought little resolution to con
flicts within the group.
Originally designed to discuss
two proposals submitted for con

sideration by the Latino commu

boycotted the discussion and
withdrew their proposal because
of frustration that the community
is divided into too many factions.
The proposals were submitted
last month by MEChA, the most
established Latino group on
campus, and the Stanford Latino
Student Alliance Committee, a
group that is trying to establish
itself as an umbrella organization
for all Latino groups.
Debate centers around creation
of an all-encompassing body to
address the needs of the commu

While MEChA does not support
construction of a unifying group
at this time because of tensions
it sees plaguing the community,
its leaders say they hope tensions
will subside and formation of a
larger group will take place next
year.
Lucky Gutierrez, a senior and
MEChA member, said the com

The SaLSA Committee adv
ocates an umbrella organization
that will join diverse elements of
the Latino community often

estranged from MEChA, which
claims that it does not try to rep
resent all members of the Latino
community.
One student participating in the
discussion last night cited
MEChA's focus on Chicano issues
as a barrier to students of other
Latino groups.
Senior Alberto Hernandez, a
resident assistant at Casa Zapata
told the group of 50 students at
the meeting he felt that unity was
required before a structure could
be chosen. He posed a rhetorical
