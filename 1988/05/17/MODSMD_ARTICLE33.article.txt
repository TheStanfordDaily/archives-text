# ASSU picks senate chair for coming year
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
The ASSU last night began its
annual transition period by selec
ting Richard Vaughn as next
year's ASSU senate chair.
Vaughan, a graduate student in
computer science, will chair the
first meeting of the 19th ASSU
Senate, scheduled for two weeks
from tonight.
After a three-hour meeting, the

senate-elect chose Vaughan from
a pool of five candidates. Eight
originally entered the race, but
Council of Presidents member
Leonard Adler, Graduate Senator
David Fallek and sophomore
Kerry Davidson dropped out
before the meeting.
"Honored" by his selection,
Vaughan said he expects to spend
about 30 hours a week in the
position. Although he said the se
lection procedure is a "fairly ran

dorn process," Vaughan said his
experience and his emphasis on
ASSU bylaws were his main
strengths as a candidate.
According to Vaughan, the sen
ate chair is mainly a "facilitative
position ... to make sure the
bylaws and the constitution are
followed." He added that "with a
little insight [the chair] can an
ticipate problems" that inevitably
arise at senate meetings.
Vaughan was selected after two

hours of applicant interviews and
a closed senate debate. No candi
date garnered a majority on the
first regular ballot, but Vaughan
was selected on the second ballot.
Smolen said a lot of students
have a "misunderstanding" about
the chair selection process, as
suming the position is decided
during the ASSU spring elections.
In fact, only the 20 voting mem
bers of the senate-elect may vote
to select the senate chair.
