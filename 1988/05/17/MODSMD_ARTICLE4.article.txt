# 1985 arrest for Old Union apartheid sit-in
## Campus police brutality charges dismissed 
### John Pollack Senior staff writer 
Charges against the University
alleging that Stanford Police used
excessive force against protesters
at an anti-apartheid sit-in two
years ago were dismissed Wednes
day by a federal district court
judge in San Jose.
At an Oct. 11, 1985, sit-in pro
testing Stanford's investments in
companies that do business in
South Africa, nine students were
arrested for refusing to leave Old
Union after it closed at 5 p.m.
During those arrests, four
protesters went limp and had to
be carried out of the building by
police. Then-senior Robby Per
kins charged that the police vio

lated his civil rights by using a
"compliance-pain hold" to remove
him.
In such a hold, police twist the
wrists of the person arrested

and hold the
arms up high,
near the shoulder
blade.
Perkins also
claimed that the
police's use of the
hold was racially
motivated and
negligent. Per
kins. the onlv

black student arrested, further al
leged that he was later forcibly
strip-searched and beaten at
Santa Clara North County Jail by
three county sheriffs deputies.

Federal District Court Judge
Spencer Williams ruled that com
pliance holds are not inappropri
ate for handling passive resisters.
He also ruled that Stanford is not
responsible for events that hap
pened at North County Jail.
Perkins' attorney, James Mel
len, said he was unsure whether
Perkins would appeal Spencer's
decision. Perkins, who is now
serving in the Peace Corps in
rural Costa Rica, was unavailable
for comment yesterday.
University attorney Debra
Zumwalt said she hopes the mat
ter has finally been put to rest.
"The Stanford Police Department
is one of the best in the country,
and I am happy the court has
vindicated its actions," she said.

Civil charges against the
sheriffs deputies will be reviewed
at a July hearing in San Jose. A
controversial internal investiga
tion conducted by the Santa Clara
County Sheriff s department after
the incident cleared the deputies
of any wrongdoing. Perkins is ex
pected to return to the Bay Area
in early June, Mellen said.
Following the arrests and en
suing controversy, University
President Donald Kennedy com
missioned Law Prof. John Kaplan
to investigate the events of Oct.
11, including the police's use of
compliance holds.
Kaplan found police use of such
holds to be "wrong and unjusti
fiable," but he did not recommend
disciplinary action.
