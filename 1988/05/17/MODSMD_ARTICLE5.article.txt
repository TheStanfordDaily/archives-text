"Stanford-in-Washington ... I
like the ring of that," proclaimed
Marion Barry Jr., mayor of Wash
ington, D.C., at a celebration yes
terday marking the dedication
and ceremonial opening of Stan
ford's campus there.
Over 400 distinguished Stan
ford graduates — including Su
preme Court Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justice
Anthony Kennedy — braved golf
ball-sized hail to attend the grand
opening ceremony.
Several speakers lauded Stan
ford's expansion to the nation's
capital city.
"As a public servant, I have
great admiration for this pro
gram," Justice Kennedy told the
crowd, which was protected by a
large tent jutting from the four
story brick building on Connecti
cut Avenue that houses the
campus.
"As a parent, I give many
thanks to the people who made
this possible," added Kennedy,
whose three children have atten
ded Stanford. "Young people live
in the city and young ideas are
tested here."
University President Donald
Kennedy, also speaking at yester
day's event, pointed to Stanford's

expansion to Washington as a sign
that "Stanford is a net exporter
of energy."
The celebration included a din
ner Sunday evening attended by
the participants in the program,
50 of the large donors to the pro
gram, the faculty advisers for the
students and President Kennedy.
George Boone, who donated
$ 1.2 million to endow the program
director's position, described his
gift as a way of "investing in the
future through bright young
people and quality education."
Yesterday, a lunch was held at
the National Press Club for 400
alumni guests. Following the
lunch, three panel presentations
on economics and law were given.
Rehnquist chaired a panel on con
stitutional law in the 19905.
Eleven students are attending
the Stanford-in-Washington pro
gram this quarter. The students,
who arrived in Washington after
spring break, will remain there
until the first week in July. The
13-week program includes
tutorials, seminars and student
internships in government offices.
The students this quarter are
participating in a wide variety of
internships, including work for
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the
Securities Exchange commis
sioner and a newspaper colum
nist.
