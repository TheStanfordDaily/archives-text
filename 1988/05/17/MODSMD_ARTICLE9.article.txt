# Fired worker given new Stanford job
## USW drops grievance against University 
### Goodwin Liu Senior staff writer 
Despite the contention that
fired employee Long Quach
was dismissed for incom
petence, the University this
week offered the worker a po
sition with the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, just one
day before a scheduled hearing
between Stanford and the un
ion to settle the case.

Quach and
the USW
agreed with
the provisions
of the Univer
sity's state
ment to give
Quach a per
manent posi
tion as a me
chanical sci-

ence and engineering techni
cian at SLAC.
As a result, today's hearings
were canceled and the United
Stanford Workers yesterday
dropped three grievances alleg
ing University violations of the
labor contract of the mechan
ical engineering employee.
A University letter given to
the USW yesterday asked the
union to drop charges of
mistreatment and unfair ter
mination filed on behalf of

Quach, a Vietnamese im
migrant who had worked as a
lab technician at Stanford since
March, 1987. Quach was fired
from the mechanical engineer
ing department on April 12.
"We're satisfied that [Quach]
is in the job he deserves, and
that he's in the right pay range
for his qualifications," said
Rodney Barnette, a USW field
representative.
Demonstrating the "at odds"
relationship of the USW and
Stanford in recent years, Bar
nette and University officials
have differing explanations of
the action.
Barnette cited community
pressure as motivation for the
University to re-examine the
firing. "We had strong cases
on each of the three griev
ances."
However, University staff
counsel Michael Vartain said
the agreement did not result
from action by the USW or
from recent public pressure
related to Quach's case.
Voicing support of the union
to the University, the ASSU
Senate and the Asian American
Students Association peti
tioned for Quach's reinstate
ment, compensation of back
