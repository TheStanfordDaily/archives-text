# Trustees tell Hoover director to step down
## 
### Mark Lawrence Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
decided unanimously last Tuesday
that VV. Glenn Campbell, the con
troversial director of the Hoover
Institution, must step down from
his position when he turns 65
next year.
The trustees' decision, revealed
yesterday by the University,
marks the latest — and poten
tially the most controversial —
incident in the long-standing dis
pute between the University and
Hoover over the institution's
governance.
Campbell, who has been Hoover
director since 1960, said in a
statement yesterday that he was
surprised by the decision, but
would not say how he would re
spond. "1 have found that it is a
mistake to react immediately and
publicly to a surprise proposal,"
he said.
Campbell said last month in a
campus meeting with the College

Republicans, however, that if
Stanford tried to retire him, he
might respond with a lawsuit.
"They would be slapped, one way
or another, with a lawsuit, and
my lawyer would probably be Ed
ward Bennett Williams or his
protege," he said. Williams is a
prominent Washington lawyer
whose firm also represents Lt.
Col. Oliver North.
Campbell said he came from a
"warrior tradition" and that, if
Stanford tried to retire him, the
resulting feud would attract na
tional attention. He said in March
that he hoped to retire on Aug.
31, 1994, after he turns 70.
The trustees, in a letter that
Campbell received yesterday, said
the decision to retire Campbell
was made solely because of his
age. "At Stanford," the letter said,
"it is customary, and we believe
that it is generally appropriate,
that top administrative positions
should be relinquished at age 65."
A 1959 trustee resolution, ap
proved by Herbert Hoover, estab

lished 65 as the retirement age
for Hoover directors. Robert
Freelen, University vice president
for Public Affairs, said the
guideline is "simple and straight
forward." Campbell's retirement,
Freelen said, is simply a matter
of the Hoover director "living up
to the agreement."
Freelen said yesterday that a
search committee would begin
locating a successor in the near
future. A search committee ap
pointed by the trustees in 1985
will be immediately activated.
The trustees said in their letter
to Campbell that they hoped he
would remain at Hoover as senior
fellow and director emeritus. The
board offered Campbell a "gener
ous salary" with yearly increases,
a sabbatical of one or two years
with a travel and research
stipend, a supplement to ordinary
retirement benefits after Camp
bell retires as a senior fellow, and
retention of clerical help, office
