# New voting machines pass the dollar test

Automated voting in ASSU
elections may be here to stay.
Despite the expense of using
new voting machines, freshman
Steve Krauss, next year's elec
tions commissioner, said yester
day that the costs for this spring's
general ASSU elections were "al
most identical" to elections when
the machines were not used.
Although operating expenses
for the machines were about
$1,900 more than operating ex
penses without the machines, this
spring's elections actually cost
$188.39 less than those in 1986.
Krauss said he has determined
that "the new voting system is a
workable one" and that "the costs
of the voting machines are accept
able for a large election." He
added that his findings were "a
lot better than what 1 was expect
ing."
Krauss compared the costs of
this year's spring elections to the
cost of the 1986 spring elections.
The figures from 1987 could not
be used in the comparison because
Krauss said those elections were

"so screwed up that they would
not provide any valuable data."
Last year's spring elections
were marred by two recounts of
the original balloting and an en
tirely new recall election. That
election prompted the decision to
use voting machines to prevent
similar problems from occuring
this year.
Krauss said the voting mach
ines definitely helped eliminate
problems that led to last year's
fiasco. Results were obtained
more quickly and accurately with
the machines, he said, adding that
the only mtyor problems that oc
curred this year were the absence
of overseas ballots and long voter
lines.
During the debate over whether
to use the machines, Krauss said,
"people weren't worried about
costs."
The machines' expense was not
called into question until this fall
when the ASSU Senate learned
the fall elections would cost about
$7,500. Since only 700 people par
ticipated in the fall elections,
senators expressed concern that
the voting machines might not be
cost-efficient.
