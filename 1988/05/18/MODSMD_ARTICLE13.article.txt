Senate re-opens debate on INF
WASHINGTON — For the first time since
1972, the Senate opened debate yesterday on
a new U.S. nuclear arms control agreement
with the Soviet Union, with supporters calling
the pact limiting medium-range weapons the
most scrutinized treaty in American history.
The debate, expected to be one-sided, began
with President Reagan's departure for Moscow
and his fourth summit with Soviet leader Mik
hail Gorbachev only a week away. Indications
were that the Senate would put in long hours
in the coming days to bring the agreement to
a vote so Reagan will be prepared to exchange
ratification documents at the summit.
"The president should not go to the meeting
empty-handed," Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
declared in remarks to the Senate yesterday
afternoon. "We should approve this treaty and
we should approve it without delay."
After two months of hearings by three com
mittees, and clarifying talks between Secretary
of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Cranston
labeled the agreement "the most closely
scrutinized treaty ever submitted for Senate
consideration."
The pact, signed by Reagan'and Gorbachev
in Washington in December, bans ground
launched missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400
miles.
Panel to upgrade Medicare
WASHINGTON — House and Senate con
ferees tentatively agreed yesterday to include
prescription drugs in the Medicare program
starting in 1991, with the government paying
half the cost after the first $600 a year, sources
said yesterday.
Under the agreement, the government's
share of the costs would rise to 60 percent in
1992 and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter.
But the deductible that must be paid by
beneficiaries would also rise, with medical in
flation, to an estimated $710 in 1993.
The conferees also agreed informally to
make mammography, a vital test for early
detection of breast cancer in women, eligible
for Medicare coverage.
For women 65 and older, Medicare would
pay up to $50 toward the cost of a mammogram
every other year. The benefit would start in
1990, and the $50 limit would be revised to
keep pace with medical inflation.
Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the
1 Hmiae Ways and Means subcommittee on
health, called the mammography provision a
"revolution. We will begin to pay for preventive
medicine for the first time. With mammog
raphy, early detection of breast cancer saves
lives and can reduce the need for thousands
of dollars of hospital costs."
Summit may solve Angola issue
WASHINGTON — Substantial progress on
bringing peace to Angola and independence to
Namibia (South West Africa) may be made at
upcoming summit talks in Moscow between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, a senior administration official
predicted yesterday.
Asst. Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway
suggested that recent U.S.-Soviet success in
forging an agreement on the Soviet withdrawal
of troops from Afghanistan had improved the
climate for moving ahead on other regional
issues, especially southern Africa.
"Southern Africa is the regional issue that
offers some prospect for moving the dialogue
ahead," Ridgway said at a White House news
briefing a week before Reagan is scheduled to
depart for the Moscow summit.
Proposed reductions in long-range nuclear
weapons, human rights improvements and a
number of other issues also are on the agenda,
she noted, but she set low expectations for
making headway in those areas.
The agenda "is not a high-water mark" in
U.S.-Soviet relations but rather, she said,
mixing metaphors, "sort of like catching your
second wind."
