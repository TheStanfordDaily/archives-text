# Poll says Dukakis may take California
## Democratic front-runner seems on the threshold of a landslide victory 
### 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Duka
kis seems on the threshold of a lop
sided victory in the California primary
and in an early position to do what
no other Democratic candidate has
done in the last five presidential cam
paigns — carry the state in November.
The Los Angeles Times Poll has
found Dukakis to be leading the Rev.
Jesse Jackson by 2-1 among Califor
nians likely to vote in the June 7
primary. The figures are Dukakis 61
percent, Jackson 30 percent, un
decided 5 percent and other candidates
4 percent.
And pointing toward the anticipated
race between Dukakis and Vice Pres
ident George Bush in November, the
survey showed the Massachusetts
Democrat to be running ahead by 17
points in California, 53 percent to 36
percent with 11 percent undecided.

Bush possibly could help himself a
little in California by choosing Gov.
George Deukmejian as his vice presi
dential running mate, the survey
showed. But Bush would run almost
as well in the state with New York
Rep. Jack Kemp on the ticket.
The Times Poll questioned 2,202
Californians by telephone for six days
ending Monday night. Of these, 1,486
were regarded as likely to vote in the
primary. They included 713 Democrats
and 583 Republicans, plus 190 other
registered voters. The margin of error
for all likely voters is 3 percent in
either direction. For Democrats it is
5 percent.
A lot will happen politically between
now and November, of course — nearly
six months of highly visible campaign
ing, two national convention ex
travaganzas, the strategic selection of

running mates — plus many non
political events that could shape voter
opinions, such as the superpower sum
mit and the various twists and turns
of the nation's economy.
But what The Times Poll showed
conclusively was that California no
longer can be penciled automatically
into the Republican victory column
before the fall campaign begins.
One mcyor reason for the more level
playing field is that unlike five of the
last seven presidential elections, no
Californian will be heading the GOP
ticket in 1988, as Reagan or Richard
Nixon previously did. In fact, a Califor
nian has been on the Republican ticket
— either in the top spot or as the
running mate — in eight of the last
10 elections.
There has been much speculation,

therefore, that Bush might turn to
California's governor as his running
mate. For months, Deukmejian has
insisted that he could not accept such
an offer because if he were elected
vice president, he would have to turn
over the governor's office to a Demo
crat. Bush has countered that Deuk
mejian's reluctance will not deter him
from seriously considering the gover
nor anyway.
But all the dialogue and jockeying
aside, Deukmejian probably would be
of only slight help to Bush, according
to The Times survey. This conclusion
was determined by matching Bush and
Deukmejian against Dukakis and Ten
nessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., and then
comparing that result with how Bush
and Kemp would fare against Dukakis-
Gore.
