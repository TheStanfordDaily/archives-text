# U.S. trade balance:
## Exports soar; deficit hits 3-year low 
### 
WASHINGTON - The na
tion's merchandise trade deficit
fell sharply in March to $9.7 bil
lion, the lowest level in three
years, as exports soared to an all
time high and import growth
moderated, the Department of
Commerce reported yesterday.
The March trade deficit was
fully $4.1 billion lower than Feb
ruary's. Exports soared by $5.4
billion to $29 billion.
Administration officials hailed
the jump in exports as further
evidence that the economy was
being driven by a boom in
manufactured goods sold abroad.
They said that should ease protec
tionist pressures in Congress and
diminish trade as an election issue
this fall.
But private economists saw the
dramatic surge in exports as a
further indicator of labor and
supply shortages, higher inflation
and higher interest rates.
Investors seemed to agree, and
markets that fell a month ago
when the trade deficit was re
ported as rising slumped again on
the news that the trade picture
had brightened. Stock and bond
rallies fizzled early, with the Dow
Jones industrial average closing
down 21.22 points.
"Markets are so fearful of in
flation now it's going to take a
lot more than one month of better
trade numbers to make them feel
better," said Jay Goldinger, an
international exchange and bond

specialist with Capital Insight, a
Los Angeles investment broker.
President Reagan, addressing
reporters at the White House,
called the March trade figures
"the best news on this front since
March of 1985." Suggesting that
he would soon veto the trade bill
that Congress approved late last
month, he said: "This is not the
time to be imposing restrictions
on trade or reducing incentives
for free, open markets."
In Washington, Secretary of
Commerce C. William Verity said
in a statement that the latest
report demonstrated the "decisive
improvement in the trade balance
that is now under way."
Corrected for inflation, the U.S.
trade imbalance has been improv
ing steadily since mid-1986, but
the totals for the three months
ending in March marked the first
clear-cut quarterly trade balance
improvement in years.
The deficit for the first three
months of this year was $36 bil
lion, compared with $39.2 billion
in the first three months of 1987
and $38 billion in the first quarter
of 1986.
To be sure, part of the latest
improvement stemmed from tem
porary factors, including a $600
million sale of gold bullion to
Taiwan and a $600 million decline
in oil imports, reflecting lower
prices as well as smaller volume.
