# Senate rejects Noriega deal
## Won't accept agreement that dismisses drug charges 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
refused yesterday to say if he had ap
proved dismissing drug-trafficking in
dictments against Panamanian strong
man Manuel Antonio Noriega, while the
Senate put itself on record as strongly
opposed to any deal that would drop the
charges in exchange for Noriega's
removal from power.
With Republicans leading the revolt
against the administration's Panama
policy, the Senate voted 86-10 to approve
a non-binding "sense of Congress" res
olution expressing unqualified opposi
tion to a deal — or even negotiations
that could lead to a deal — that involves
dropping the drug charges against Nor
iega. The resolution was sponsored by
Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan.
A few hours later Reagan made a rare
appearance in the White House briefing
room to praise the Senate for taking up
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces

Treaty and was besieged with questions
from reporters about a prospective deal
for Noriega's removal. The president
replied that "there are no facts to sus
tain" some of the published reports
about the terms of the deal but declined
to give details because "we are in the
midst of real negotiations."
Later in the news conference Reagan
was asked if he would agree to an ar
rangement under which Noriega gave
up his role as head of the Panamanian
Defense Forces while leaving his cronies
in power.
"What we're interested in seeing is a
restoration of democracy in Panama,"
Reagan replied.
A senior administration official who
talked on condition of anonymity said
Reagan's goal from the beginning has
been and remains the ouster of Noriega.
