# Reagan defends Meese

WASHINGTON - President Reagan
yesterday defended longtime friend At
torney General Edwin Meese 111, who
has been under intense investigation on
conflict-of-interest charges for more
than a year, saying, "I've seen no
evidence of any wrongdoing on his part."
In an unusual midafternoon news con
ference, the president also denied that
he relied on astrological advice to make
policy or personal decisions but refused
to say whether he believes in astrology.
Former White House chief of staff
Donald Regan, in a book published last
week, said first lady Nancy Reagan based
travel and scheduling decisions on an
astrologer's recommendations, an asser
tion that Reagan yesterday denied.
Reagan's defense of Meese came a day
after he fired his chief spokesman, Terry
Eastland, supposedly because he had not
been vigorous enough in defending the
attorney general, the subject of a year
long investigation by independent coun
sel James McKay. Morale at the Justice
Department has been shattered by a
series of key resignations, and Meese
has become a prime Democratic target
in this year's presidential campaign.
But Reagan expressed "complete con
fidence" in the attorney general, who
has worked for him since Reagan was
governor of California in 1967 and
Meese was his legal-affairs secretary.
"I think that for him to step aside
would be what he himself once said —
that he would then live for the rest of
his life under this cloud — with nothing
that had ever been proven," Reagan said,
when asked if Meese should quit if he
is accused of ethical violations that fall

short of indictment.
Reagan said that "nothing has been
proven" against Meese and compared
his plight to that of former Labor Sec
retary Raymond Donovan, who resigned
after he was indicted on bribery charges
and was later acquitted by a jury.
Meese, meanwhile, labeled as "ba
loney" Eastland's explanation that he
was fired for failing to defend the at
torney general ardently enough. Meese
was implicitly supported by Reagan, who
said reporters should ask the attorney
general why Eastland was dismissed.
"This had nothing to do with a defense
of me," Meese said Monday. "This had
to do with just generally the need for
a change in leadership. Actually, defend
ing me . . . was not one of Terry's tasks."
The president's appearance in the
White House briefing room, only his
second of the year, was initiated by
Reagan, aides said. The president
wanted to make positive comments
about the Senate taking up the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty and the dramatically im
proved trade-deficit figures. But a senior
official said Reagan was told that "the
price of admission" for such an appear
ance would be a series of questions from
reporters about Meese and U.S. policy
in Panama.
Appearing unusually relaxed, Reagan
read a two-minute statement and an
swered questions for 16 minutes. Several
dealt with the reports of his reliance on
astrology, considered a psuedo-science
by most scientists.
