## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — Two Los An
geles Jewish organizations said
yesterday that they would not
participate in a meeting scheduled
today with Democratic presiden
tial candidate Jesse Jackson be
cause they felt that Jackson was
dictating the terms.
"Many Jewish organizations
feel Jackson is setting the agenda
for this meeting and that is not
right," Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean
of the Simon Wiesenthal Center,
said in a telephone interview.
"Why should Jackson be given
control that would not be given
to any other candidate for presi
dent?" Hier said. "If you are can
didate for president you should
be willing to meet in a public
forum and take any and all ques
tions."
The meeting will be private at
Jackson's request. A press brief
ing is planned afterward.

David Lehrer, regional director
of the Anti-Defamation League,
said yesterday his organizaton has
also declined to attend the meet
ing.
Rabbi Allen Freehling of Uni
versity Synagogue, who arranged
the meeting, said about 40 Jewish
leaders have been invited but he
stressed that they would be com
ing as individuals, not as repre
sentatives of any organizations
they may belong to.
He added that he had sought
the meeting with Jackson "be
cause the most important thing
is to establish a dialogue."
Jackson has had rocky relations
with some Jewish leaders for
years. Some, including Hier, be
lieve that he is not supportive
enough of Israel and is reluctant
to condemn Arab states for their
hostility toward Israel.
