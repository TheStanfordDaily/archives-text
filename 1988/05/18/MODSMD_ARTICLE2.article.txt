# W. Glenn Campbell: A controversial career
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
W. Glenn Campbell's 28-year
tenure as the first and only di
rector of the Hoover Institution
for War, Revolution and Peace
has been marked by controversy
since he was appointed to the
position in 1960.
Although Campbell was Her
bert Hoover's personal choice
for the directorship, University
President Wallace Sterling did
not support the appointment
from the start, according to
George Nash, author of a new
book titled "Herbert Hoover and
Stanford University."
"For more than a year, the

impression on campus was
strong — an impression which
Sterling himself fostered — that
the University president was
simply biding his time and
would dismiss Campbell after
Hoover was dead," according to
Nash.
While Campbell, who has
been asked to step down from
the directorship, survived that
storm, nasty weather has often
plagued him during his tenure.
Since its establishment,
Hoover has endured persistent
criticism about its ties with the
University. Campbell recently
said that Hoover's relations


W. Glenn Campbell
with Stanford "are just as bad
now as they were in the spring
of 1960."
Most recently, Campbell drew
criticism for his role in convincing
University officials to bring the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary to Stanford. The library was
not built in the Foothills as
planned after it inspired a large
protest from the community.
Calls to sever ties between the
University and the conservative
think tank have been raised often
in the past. In the past five years,
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz have urged the Faculty Sen
ate to examine the matter three
times.
Tomorrow Manley and Rebholz
plan to publicize the results of
their most recent petition drive

asking the University to cut its
ties with Hoover.
Manley stressed that most
problems between Hoover and
Stanford stem from the institu
tion itself, not necessarily its di
rector. In fact, Manley said Camp
bell "is not the problem."
"The crucial thing for Stanford
is not that Stanford has spray
painted W. Glenn Campbell's
parachute gold and pushed him
through the door, but that they
bring the Hoover Institution un
der normal academic gover
nance," Manley said.
"We should not allow the trus
tees' decision to obscure the larger
issue of the University's ties with
the Hoover Institution," he added.
However, he complimented the
outspoken Campbell for being
"honest about the Institution's
activities because he is proud of
them."
Despite his many controversies,
many have also complimented

Campbell for making significant
improvements in the institution.
According to Campbell, the
Hoover collections have grown
from 600,000 volumes to 1.6 mil
lion and the archives have quad
rupled under his directorship.
"Campbell has been very com
mitted to the institution," said
Political Science Prof. John
Ferejohn, who is a senior fellow
at Hoover. "Campbell has com
bined the resources and people
necessary to make Hoover an
enormously important national
institution," he added.
Indeed, at a White House recep
tion in January, President Reagan
acknowledged the importance of
the institution. Hoover's "bold in
tellectual leadership has made it
not only an institution with an
international reputation but also
a national treasure," he said.
A native Canadian, Campbell
graduated from the University of
Western Ontario in 1944.
