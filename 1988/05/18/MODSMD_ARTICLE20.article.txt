SAYING YOU HAVE a Stan
ford degree just isn't enough
— at least, not for some Stan
ford students.
That's why there's such a thing
as "graduating with distinction,"
which the Faculty Senate has just
decided should honor those stu
dents who have academically ex
celled in all areas — not just their
major.
The senate voted unanimously
last week to change the require
ment for distinction from requiring
grades to be in the top 25 percent
of only their department to being
in the top 20 percent in both the
department and the entire gradu
ating class.
Hence the senate ensured that
distinction is not confused with
graduating "with honors," in
which the student excels within an
individual department through
high achievement and completion
of a thesis project.
The move automatically
broadens the meaning of graduat
ing with distinction, which under
standably led to the former confu
sion between distinction, honors
and a University-wide honor.
This is necessary to give credit
where credit is due. One simply
cannot ascertain from the generic
degree which students got by on
a pass/no credit regimen of courses
outside of their major from those
who throw themselves wholeheart
edly into all of their academic pur

suits.
The pass/no credit option is so
inviting to students who wish to
focus on their specific field of study
because it is only allowed for
courses taken outside of the m^jor.
Honors, since it is only based on
performance within the specific
major, rewards this trend.
But students who focus on
achieving excellence and breadth
in their whole education are often
ignored. Graduation with distinc
tion is necessary to reward and
motivate students to embrace all
areas of the academic spectrum.
For years, Stanford has battled
the anti-intellectual image that has
accompanied our sunny weather
and relaxed atmosphere.
Graduation with distinction will
highlight and applaud those stu
dents who have always existed, al
beit behind the scenes, at Stanford.
It is the all-around scholar that
excels in the gamut of distribution
requirements that is recognized
through distinction — the fresh
man who misses Flicks to read Sap
pho even though he/she plans on
majoring in electrical engineering.
It is this student, who goes all
out no matter what the subject,
that also deserves some special
recognition when the sheepskins
are being handed out in June three
years later.
That is what distinction, as now
defined by the Faculty Senate, will
do.
