## Curb grade inflation 
### 
GRADE INFLATION affects all
Stanford students adversely. The
perception around the country, in
law school, B-school and med school ad
missions offices is that Stanford students
are systematically overpraised for their
performances in the classroom.
I've come into possession of some very
important statistics put out by LSAC,
the "clearinghouse" for collegiate
transcripts of all people who take the
Law School Admissions Test (LSAT).
I've also been studying some numbers
from Old Union, closely guarded and per
haps properly so. Prof. John Kaplan, a
member of Stanford Law School's Ad
missions Committee, is my source. I'm
here to tell you what the information
says and I think you'll be very interested.
Of the 913 Stanford students taking
the LSAT in the years 1985-1987 in
clusive, the mean GPA at graduation was
3.36. The mean LSAT score was a 39,
or the 85th percentile nationally.
That 3.36 GPA is higher than the mean
at Amherst, Brown, Michigan, Harvard,
Yale, Princeton, UC-Berkeley,
Swarthmore and basically any other
"elite" school you can mention.
But are our LSAT scores higher than
those other schools? Well, some. Harvard
beats us substantially in the mean score
(91st percentile) as does Yale, Princeton
and Amherst. It's really tough to argue
that Stanford students get better grades
because they're smarter.

At Stanford, 29 percent of those taking
the LSAT in the last three years gradu
ated with GPAs above 3.6. At Berkeley,
the number is 18 percent. At Harvard,
16 percent. At Princeton, 19 percent. And
at Michigan (Ann Arbor), 15 percent. The
differences don't disappear at the 3.4
GPA level, either.
Here's the shocking stuff. At Stanford
last autumn (1986), there were 5,011
grades given out in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences to people with
"senior" status. Of those, 36 percent were
"A" grades, 30 percent were "B" grades,
6 percent were "C" grades and 1 percent
were "D" grades.
There were 223 "No Credits," or 5
percent of the total (and those disappear
from transcripts!). Twenty-two percent
of the grades were "none of the above,"
most of them either "Pass," " + " or "In
complete."
That same quarter, now removing all
grades that were given out other than
letter grades, we get some appalling
results. There were 3,646 letter grades
that quarter. Half of them, 1,808, were
"A" grades. Forty-one percent, or 1,510
were "B." There were only 296 "C's"
given out to seniors in Humanities and
Sciences, a paltry 8 percent! Less than
1 percent of the total grades were "D's."
The story goes on. Last spring, exactly
one year ago, there were 4,347 letter
grades given out to seniors in Humanities
and Sciences classes. Of these, 53 percent
were "A's," 37 percent "B's," 9 percent

"C's" and 1 percent "D's." This is grade
inflation however you care to define it.
That's in Humanities and Sciences and
it only covers seniors, who may work less
hard once their future plans are set.
Readers, it seems all too evident that
"A's" are everywhere and "B's" are al
most the lowest grade you can get at
Stanford if you are in H&S. For seniors
there are almost six times as many "A's"
as "C's" given out!
Think about it. "No Credits" disappear
from transcripts. Classes can be dropped
up until 24 hours before the final. Fifty -
one percent of the four letter grades given
to seniors in H&S last year were "A's."
It paints a picture of a place that sys
tematically overpraises its students.
Unquestionably, there should be as
many "C's" as "A's" given out. Let's
make an "A" much tougher to get, so it
really does mean "exceptional perform
ance." To admissions officers and em
ployers, those words now wring hollow
and with good cause.
