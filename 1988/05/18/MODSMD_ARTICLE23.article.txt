## Stanford needs to pay more attention to recycling 
### 
I'M WRITING to relate an incident
which exemplifies many students'
lack of awareness regarding recy
cling (especially of cardboard) and
waste disposal at Stanford.
Most cardboard on campus is now
collected in metal dumpsters provided
and serviced by Peninsula Sanitary
Service, the trash contractor for Stan
ford.
These dumpsters are clearly marked
for recycling only — they are green (a
very different color than the brown
dumpsters used for garbage), and they
are logoed with the recycling symbol
and the words "Cardboard Only,"
"Please Flatten" and "No Garbage."
They are emptied the same way
garbage is emptied — by a large dump
truck operated by PSS. The contents

of the truck are delivered to the recy
cling center; a huge pile is dumped
onto the ground, where the cardboard
is manually loaded into the baling
machine. We sort out contaminants as
we bale in order to net the best possi
ble price from our paper buyer.
A co-worker and I were loading
stacks of cardboard into the baler
when I came upon a large cooked ham
still on the bone. This occurred mo
ments after I'd discovered an entire
raw fish among lots of other trash and
food waste in the cardboard pile.
Disgusted, I was about to shovel the
ham into the trash when I discovered
that it wasn't just a ham; it was the
entire head of a pig — a vegetarian's
nightmare, indeed!
Judging from the type and quantity
of other garbage in the pile, the

cleanup crew of last weekend's Hawaii
Club Luau at the Cowell Cluster had
apparently mistaken the green
cardboard recycling dumpster for a
trash dumpster.
An honest mistake, perhaps, but the
frequency of such mistakes all over
campus never ceases to amaze and
appall those of us who must process by
hand every ton of cardboard, alumi
num, glass and paper recycled at Stan
ford.
We often joke that people at Stan
ford can't read; why else would they
constantly throw garbage into the
1,000 clearly-marked recyclying barrels
and cardboard containers all over
campus?
I cite the incident only as one of the
more graphic instances of the trash

problem which constantly and seriously
hampers recycling efforts here.
Anything you throw "away" must be
handled by many people before it
reaches its final destination, be it the
dump or the paper recycling plant. I
urge students, faculty and staff to
think before they dispose of their trash
to learn what can and cannot be
recycled and to take the time to
recycle properly by separating and
depositing recyclables into the appro
priate containers.
In the words of a former Stanford
Recycling manager, waste is a decision.
Here at Stanford we are fortunate to
have the option to decide against the
needless waste of scarce resources.
Recycling works!
