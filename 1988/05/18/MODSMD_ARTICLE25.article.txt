# Candidates must respect voters more
## 
### 
I was really disappointed with Jesse
Jackson's speech Saturday. Why? Be
cause I didn't get to hear it. After
standing in the hot sun for over two
hours with my wife and two small
children, I finally gave up and went
home.
Apparently, there was something far
more important on Jackson's agenda
than my piddly opinions (and the
piddly opinions of the rest of the Stan
ford community).
Am I an apathetic voter? I don't
think so. I was there. I tried. We
wasted about three and half hours
getting the kids ready, hauling our-

selves over to campus from Mountain
View, standing around, then hauling
ourselves back. For zip! Next time I'll
just catch it in The Daily.
It is, of course, unfair to level this
criticism at Jackson. You fill in the
name, it's all the same: Dukakis, Bush,
Art Agnos for that matter.
I admit that these people are ex
tremely busy — after all, they have to
bum up millions and millions and
millions of dollars on their two-year
bid for a four-year job — but with all
the complaints of the apathy that grips
the nation, I expect a little more from
the very people who are courting our
votes. Our time is important, too!
When was the last time you had to
wait over two hours for a rock con
cert? Think of the implications. A bus
load of stoned musicians is more de
pendable than the people who want to
run our country.
