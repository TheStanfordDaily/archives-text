## Stop helping oppression 
### 
WITH MOST of the media
focused on Nicaragua and its
efforts to comply with the
Esquipulas II Accords ("Arias peace
plan"), it is easy to ignore serious
problems of inequity and repression in
the other four Central American
countries.
Widespread human rights violations
and political corruption continue in El
Salvador and Guatemala. The extreme
poverty and economic stagnation that
plague Honduras are worsened by U.S.
militarization of this country which
acts as the base for U.S. military
operations in Central America.
Costa Rica's tradition of democratic
politics and social reform has been
jeopardized by a U.S. policy of keeping
the Costa Rican economy afloat in
return for Costa Rica's cooperation in
the U.S. anti-Nicaragua effort.
Despite literally billions of dollars in
U.S. aid going to El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica,
conditions of inequity, political repres
sion and economic instability have
either remained constant or
deteriorated in these countries.
In January, the International
Verification Commission, charged with
monitoring compliance with the
Esquipulas II Accords, released its
report, drafted by representatives of
the United Nations, the Organization
of American States and 13 Latin
American countries.
The report commended Nicaragua in
its steps toward compliance and called
for a "definitive cessation" of U.S.
Contra aid to ensure the success of the
Arias plan. It also cited El Salvador
and Guatemala with low compliance in
discontinuing cease-fire negotiations
with domestic insurgents and con
demned Honduras for continuing to
allow Honduran territory to be used

for U.S.-backed Contra operations.
Yet the Reagan administration and
U.S. media disregard these findings
and continue to foster the perception
that the success or failure of demo
cratic reform in Central America lies
with Nicaragua.
Take El Salvador as a case in point.
For the past eight years, the military
dominated, U.S.-backed government
has been fighting against insurgents in
a war which has left more than 60,000
dead and 1.2 million homeless in a
population of 5 million, and has caused
over $1 billion in damage to the infra
structure of this largely rural society.
The "low-intensity" warfare practiced
by the U.S.-trained and U.S.-armed
Salvadoran army has not succeeded in
quelling a growing opposition. Instead,
the insurgents have responded in kind
by staging surprise attacks on armed
forces throughout the country, and the
FMLN-FDR (Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front-Democratic Revolu
tionary Front), the leading voice in the
insurgency, has broadened its popular
base among laborers and peasantry.
Marginal U.S. pressure for political
reform in El Salvador has not
prevented the increasing militarization
of the Salvadoran government and the
numerous death squad assassinations
of politically progressive Salvadoran
civilians and U.S. citizens.
With substantial U.S. economic and
military assistance, the Salvadoran
Armed Forces grew from 13,000 in
1980 to 53,000 in 1986, acquiring U.S.
military advisors and a broad array of
U.S. military equipment.
U.S. aid to El Salvador leaped from
$9.5 million in fiscal year 1979 to $149
million in fiscal year 1981 and $437
million in fiscal year 1986 and is
consistently higher than aid to any
other Central American nation.

A 1985 congressional study headed
by Reps. Jim Leach, George Miller and
Sen. Mark Hatfield found that most of
the aid is used for military purposes;
aid designated as "economic" has often
been channelled into war-related pro
grams. No aid package has been explic
itly linked to democratic reform.
For fiscal year 1989, Congress is
working on an appropriations bill of
$388.9 million in aid to El Salvador,
with $95 million targeted for the
Military Assistance Program, $1.5
million for International Military Edu
cation and $185 million for the Eco
nomic Support Fund.
As of yet, there has been no signifi
cant effort to make aid dependent on
the Salvadoran government' 3 progress
in achieving a negotiated settlement
with insurgents and in complying with
international human rights standards.
That the Reagan administration and
the media choose to direct public
attention to events in Nicaragua while
hardly acknowledging gross inequities
and repression in El Salvador and the
other countries appears to be a calcu
lated move.
Surely, it is difficult to justify a U.S
foreign policy in which massive infu
sions of aid sustain civil war at the
price of thousands of lives, further
strengthen a repressive military regime
and destabilize an already weak eco
nomy.
