# District race not lost yet
## 
### 
IT HAS BEEN STATED in several
letters over the past few weeks
that a Democrat running for
Congress cannot win in a district that
has even registration between Demo
crats and Republicans, like the 12th
Congressional District, which includes
Stanford.
Well, I've heard this story before. In
1986, while I was attending the Uni
versity of Colorado, Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, a Democrat and American
Indian, ran for Congress in a district
comprised of the western slope of
Colorado. The district had been ger
rymandered, much like the district we
live in, to guarantee a Republican
representative.
Early in the campaign, Campbell
found that not only did he have to
battle the Republicans, but he also had
to battle a defeatist attitude within his
own party.
He rose to the challenge. Campbell
campaigned aggresively against his foe,
Mike Strang, a very conservative first
term Republican who had offended
many of his district's more moderate
members.
Campbell's hard work paid off. By
election day the polls shows him in a
virtual tie with Mike Strang. But,
unfortunately, five hours after the
polls had closed on election day and
with 95 percent of the precincts
reporting, it became clear that Camp
bell was going down in defeat.
In Denver, where the state Demo
cratic Party was celebrating the elec
tion of a Democratic governor and U.S
senator, Campbell was dismissed as
another victim of a gerrymandered
Republican district. Apparently, the
defeatist attitude had triumphed.
But, unbeknownst to anyone, a
critical error had been made when
entering the results into the main

election computer. The error was not
discovered until several hours after the
celebration in Denver had come to an
end. When the error was corrected, the
computer spit out a startling result —
Ben Nighthorse Campbell had won!
It is amazing to me the parallelism
between the election held on the west
ern slope of Colorado and the election
being held this year in the Silicon
Valley.
On the Republican side, instead of
Mike Strang, we have Ernie Konnyu, a
very conservative Republican who has
offended many of this district's more
moderate members. Some of his ac
tions have been so offensive that a
moderate Republican has chosen to
challenge him in the primap'-
On the Democratic side, instead of
Ben Nighthorse Campbell, we have Jim
Garrison. Jim Garrison, ignoring the
defeatist attitude within his own party,
has launched an all-out assault, intent
on taking the Congressional seat away
from the Republicans.
Hundreds of volunteers for Jim
Garrison have spread throughout the
district to tell the voters that they can
have a representative in congress who
will vote to stop Contra aid, stand up
for civil rights, stop the manufacturing
the D-5, a highly accurate first-strike
nuclear missile, and stop developers
from turning a tract of land in the
foothills into a golf course.
I urge my fellow Democrats to stop
talking about defeat in the 12th Con
gressional District and join Jim Gar
rison in his effort to represent us.
Remember, history often repeats
itself. Jim Garrison is the Ben
Nighthorse Campbell of the 12th Con
gressional District and he will win if
you believe he can win.
