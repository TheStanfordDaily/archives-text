# CIV clause could be rewritten
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate will proba
bly modify a controversial clause
in the recently passed Cultures,
Ideas and Values legislation that
some members say violates Stan
ford appointment procedures, ac
cording to University officials.
The Committee on Committees,
responsible for investigating Fac
ulty Senate committees, is cur
rently working on a recommen
dation that might reword a por
tion of the CIV decision concern
ing appointments to the Area One
Committee, the body responsible
for administration of the CIV pro
gram.
The clause currently states that
the provost shall take gender and
ethnicity into account when ap
pointing members of the Area One
committee. The change recom
mended by Assoc. Prof, of
Medicine Carlos Camargo three
weeks ago involves replacing the
words gender and ethnicity with
the phrase "interest in the pro
gram."
Camargo's recommendation is
on the agenda for the senate's
next meeting, May 26.
Camargo, who is a member of
the senate, said the current lan
guage directly contradicts Univer
sity rules regarding committee ap
pointments because the faculty
handbook prohibits the selection
of committee members on the
basis of gender or race.
However, some have said they
believe the present wording serves
as a safeguard to ensure commit
tees have some minority and
female representation.
One such person is Jon Inda,
a member of MEChA, a Chicano
student organization at Stanford.
Inda pushed for a change in the
Area One requirement, and said
he thinks the majority of Univer
sity committees are currently
made up of only white males. He
said the language specifically re
ferring to gender and ethnicity
guards against the "tendency to
keep things the way they are."
Biology Prof. Craig Heller, who
worked on the CIV legislation,
said it is "fine" if minority groups
feel the specific CIV language
serves as a safeguard.
But such groups need not worry
about the possible rewording be
cause "we (University faculty) do
make sure committees have broad
representation," added Heller,
who is chair of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
According to committee mem
bers, the report should be com
pleted before the end of the aca
demic year.
