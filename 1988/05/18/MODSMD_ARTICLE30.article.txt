## Speaking out for sign language classes 
### Dee Dee Weale 
Most language teachers do a lot of talking.
Kathy Haas does none. Her class in American
Sign Language involves watching, listening
and communicating through hand gestures.
But outside of the classroom, Haas's stu
dents cannot stop talking about the unique
course.
"[ASL] completely opens your mind up to
a new culture — one that you know nothing
about and in that sense, it's foreign . You
learn how to 'read' what people are saying,"
said senior Kym Croft, who has taken the
class for three quarters now.
Although the course is not publicized, each
quarter over 60 students show up for ASL,
which only has 25 available spots.

Class content
Like yearlong foreign language sequences,
Haas* course becomes increasingly more dif
ficult over its three quarters. For the first
two, Haas, who is deaf, uses an interpreter
to translate her gestures to the students. By
the third quarter, students are on their own.
During the past three quarters students
have studied songs, movies, deaf culture and
the course's textbook through sign language.
Students are learning outside of the classroom
as well. Last month professional actress Ter
rylene, who is deaf, performed for the stu
dents. She has appeared in several television
shows, including "Cagney and Lacey" and
"Beauty and the Beast."
Impact
After three quarters of participating in ASL,
students have achieved basic proficiency in
sign language.
Services Coordinator of the Disability
Resource Center Molly Sandperl praised Haas'
class for making an impact on campus and
helping Stanford's deaf students feel more at
home. Three deaf students were admitted to
Stanford this year.

"IThe sign language class] provides a sup
portive environment and a base community
for deaf students here," Sandperl said.
Controversy
Despite its popularity and the positive feed
back the class is receiving, ASL teaching as
sistant David Lasner charged that the Uni
versity is not adequately recognizing the im
portance of sign language study.
As it now stands, ASL classes cannot be
taken for a letter grade, are only offered for
three units and do not fulfill the foreign lan
guage requirement.
"There is no reason Stanford cannot estab
lish a legitimate program in ASL of the quality
that there is for Spanish, German, French
and other languages," Lasner argued.

He said that "there is a definite deaf culture
in the United States," which the University
must recognize. Lasner went on to compare
the culture of Black Americans to the coun
try's deaf culture.
"Blacks are part of American culture in
every way possible but they also have their
own culture and traditions .... [deaf culturel
is separate from the hearing culture although
it is also fairly integrated."
University stand
Stressing that language must provide in
sight into a foreign nation as well as a different
culture, Chair of the Linguistics Department
Dorothy Huntington reaffirmed the Univer
sity's position that ASL should not fulfill Stan
ford's foreign language requirement.
"ASL does not open the same doors that
the study of foreign languages does," she said.
"I can't see any fraction of [the foreign lan
guage requirement! that are substantially
filled by ASL."
But Lasner questioned why Stanford's pres
ent foreign language requirement must be
partially based on international issues.
"Should a foreign language requirement in
volve . . . characteristics like international

trade and cultural issues, and whose right of
decision is that?" he asked.
In defense of the University's Hunt
ington pointed out that Stanford is one of
few mtyor universities that gives any academic
credit to its sign language classes. "Stanford
is the exception in allowing any credit at all,"
she said, adding that Stanford has been "crit
icized" for giving ASL "that dignity."
Huntington pointed to deaf schools such as
the Technical Institute for the Deaf in
Rochester which do not grant any academic
credit for their sign language classes.
Acadcmic demands
According to Huntington, ASL cannot be
taken for a letter grade because the academic
demands of the class are more relaxed than
those for foreign language classes.
"The rigor of the qualifications of the in
structor are not nearly so great as for the
ones that are taught for letter grades," she
said, adding that "Other language course in
structors either hold Ph.D.s or have had ex
tensive academic experience prior to coming
to Stanford."
But according to Lasner, other "major uni
versities in the country" have full professors
teaching sign language or at least have "people
fighting to get it taught."
Money
Another issue threatening the future of ASL
is finance.
"We don't have more money to open up
sections for students who want to take ASL,"
said Marya Teusch-Dwyer, director of the Spe
cial Language Program at Stanford.
"It's not that we don't want to offer more,
but these are simply our budgetary limita
tions," she explained.
The policy of Stanford's Special Language
Department is to offer language courses when
student demand is five or more. Because of
lack of funding, often that policy cannot be
met.
"We've only got so much money to spend
so we couldn't offer an infinite number of
languages even if we had the required number
of people for each one of them," Huntington
said.
"We'd be happy to have 10 sections of ASL
if there were the demand and we could fund
and staff them," she said.
In the future Stanford might very well have
to fill that demand. "ASL is becoming an
increasingly popular course," Lasner said.
"There is a new awareness that sign is an
art form."
