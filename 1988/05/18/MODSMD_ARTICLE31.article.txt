Sun Tan Blues:
Just got back from a sun-filled weekend in
Los Angeles. The rays were strong and my
sunburned back will prove it! Now I am forced
to face reality (in the form of a Renaissance
Lit. paper) once again.
Mendicant, n. a wandering singer:
On my way into the Bookstore Monday I
caught the tail end of the Mendicant's rendi
tion of "Only You." The casual concert
reminded me to remind you that the Men
dicants' Spring Concert is tommorrow night
in Memorial Church. Singer Todd Dereemer
called out to the Bookstore crowd: "Come!
Thursday. 8 p.m."
Look Out Fred and Ginger:
Tomorrow night is Senior Formal at the St.
Francis on Union Square â€” the last chance
you seniors will have to catch the magic of
"prom night." Not only is the dance a final
class farewell, but it is also a great excuse to
dress up, party in San Francisco, and dance
to the amazing sounds of Pride and Joy. Have
a fantastic time!
Laugh and the World Laughs with You:
Tonight at the Coffee House, "Seven New
Bay Area Comedians" will be performing for
your enjoyment. Comedy Night is from 8-10:30
p.m. and the coffee isn't bad either. . . .
Congratulations are in Order:
I can't help but be in awe of the phenomenal
performance of the women's tennis team last
weekend! Continued good luck to those indi
vidual players seeking the NCAA singles title
this week.
