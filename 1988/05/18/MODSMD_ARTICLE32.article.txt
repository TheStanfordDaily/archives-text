## Album Review Shocked turns out a real surprise 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Michelle Shocked
"The Texas Campfire Tapes"

Picture the scene: A campfire
flickers in the darkness of a Texas
autumn night. The Keirville Folk
Festival's activities for the day
have long since wound to a close,
and participants freely mingle
with the audience.
Soon, one of the artists pulls
out her guitar and her Sony
Walkman tape recorder. Placing
the Walkman in the record mode,
Michelle Shocked proceeds to per
form a dozen of the songs in her
repertoire for the eager ears of
the spectators and the accepting
microphone of her Walkman.
The result is "The Texas
Campfire Tapes," a rather witty

and surprisingly clear recording
that has suddenly, recently and
unexpectedly appeared on record
store shelves. If this impromptu
effort is any indication, however,
her next release will be much
anticipated.
Quite simply, the woman can
play and the woman can sing. She
squeezes more emotion out of her
voice (which sounds like a soulful
mix of Dolly Parton and Laurie
Anderson) and her guitar (a good
'ole acoustic six-string) than many
quintets. And her snappy little
ditties would make most folk sing
ers green with envy.
From the outset of the folksy
"5 a.m. in Amsterdam" through
the bluesy "The Secret of a Long
Life (Is Knowing When It's Time
To Go)," Shocked weaves a
thoroughly enjoyable album that
just grows on you. With other

winners like "(Don't Ya Mess
Around With) My Little Sister"
and"The Ballad of Patch Eye,"
the "Texas Tapes" is a definite
success.
Kudos are also due to Howie
Weinberg, the man responsible for
the brilliant sound mastering that
makes the recording spring to life.
Weinberg has magically mixed the
music to eliminate the dreaded
Walkman hiss, fine details like the
flickering fire and the chirping
crickets are pleasantly preserved.
Now, don't expect to hear this
music on any local radio station,
as this material is about as far
away from pop music as you can
get and most stations shy away
from airing folk music. But if you
venture to a Texas folk festival
or even to a record store, look for
Michelle Shocked and prepare
yourself for a treat.
