## Dickies have fun with 'Klowns' 
### Bernardo Silva 
The Dickies
"Killer Klowns"

In the late '70s, things were
simple: John Travolta ruled the
movie industry, center-parts and
platform shoes ruled the fashion
world and Los Angeles' legendary
Dickies ruled the underground
punk music scene. In the late '80s,
things seem a bit more complex.
A brat pack rules the movie in
dustry, platform shoes still rule,
and a hellacious resurgence of
punk and heavy metal has the
music industry in a stranglehold.
Times change, but remember
that history repeats itself. Return
ing triumphantly after a half

decade hiatus, the Dickies have
turned in a five-track mini
masterpiece, "Killer Klowns."
1988 finds the Dickies closer to
the mainstream than they once
were; however, their updated vi
sion of refined pop still highlights
bright and fun guitars and singer
Leanord Phillips' mile-a-minute
harmonies.
The title track comes from the
main title of a campy horror
movie entitled "Killer Klowns
from Outerspace" (no kidding —
look for it at your local video out
lets). Not surprisingly, the Dickies
were the logical choice to cut that
title track. Other tracks include
a retelling of the larger-than-life
legend of "Jim Bowie" and a non

sensical little ditty entitled
"Magoomba." Also included is a
"Les-Paul-and-the-Stray-Cats
meet-the-Vapors" romp and "Eep
Opp Ork (Uh Uh)," a song taken
from the Jetsons cartoon. True
Dickies material.
First signed in 1978 by the
British wing of A&M Records —
who believed they had an answer
to the Sex Pistols — the band has
fared better commercially in
Britian than in the States. Now
10 years wiser, the Dickies find
themselves on the verge of
making it big. Heck, even "Live
-105" (the home of "m-m-modern
rock") is playing a couple of the
new tracks — but don't let that
scare you.
