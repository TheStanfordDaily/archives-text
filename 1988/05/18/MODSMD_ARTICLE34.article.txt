# Album Review
## The 						Church is good laundry music 
### Frank Lester Staff writer 
The Church
"Starfish"

It's unfortunate that The
Church has such a hard time
living up to the critical hype. But
then, given the yawning gap be
tween the Australian band's ar
tistry and the drooling expecta
tions of its obviously slavish cadre
of U.S. rock critic groupies, it's
no big wonder.
The Church is a great band,
better than most of what's emerg
ing from Down Under these days.
INXS rules the top of the album
charts for months on end with a
workmanlike grab-bag of guitar
riffs and vocal snarls that fits in
quite squarely with the rest of
the current set of pop pap; Mid
night Oil records music that out
reaches its ambition; the Divinyls,
Celibate Rifles, and The Saints
all make pub-ready music, at
which American critics salivate
out of a need to find anything
that hasn't been done yet.
The Church is the only un
pretentious outfit of this
Australian crop, largely because
its pack of critic devotees is still
relatively small. Just wait till they
hit the MTV big-top.
Right now they're doing just
fine. That's not saying they're su
perb; the law of diminishing
returns may make some record
buyers gleeful to spend nine bucks
on a collection with maybe three

terrific cuts, but I'm not one of
those.
"Under the Milky Way" is a
bona fide beaut. It's the first truly
radio-happy track the boys have
cut in their seven or so years to
gether, and it's the kind of pur
ring, jangling confection that
makes you want to go out and
embrace the world and lie back
in the grass with a blade of the
green stuff between your teeth.
But like The Alarm, whose "Rain
in the Summertime" was another
feel-good 45 on the airwaves this
year, The Church is incapable of
sustaining the hallucination for
more than five minutes on end.
Which is too bad. The album
is, to steal a recent metaphor,
good laundry music. That is not
a slur. Some of the best albums
ever recorded are neither partic
ularly intense nor particularly
attention-grabbing; they're just

perfect mood music, the kind of
stuff you listen to in dark booths
at crowded pubs full of yammer
ing college students.
It's not at all damning with
faint praise these days to label an
album "mood music." It's some
thing of a pleasure to come across
an album that doesn't assault
your nerves or your sensibilities.
The album is chock-full of lyrics
about trips and travel and un
reached goals, stuff that makes
the critics yowl with pleasure at
The Church's sexy opacity. It's
also chock-full of rapturous guitar
â€” the harmonic, clanging variety,
though, happily, not the overdone
anthemic Irish variety.
"Starfish" is a nice album. But
if I had it to do over again, it's
fair to warn you I'd have bought
the $2.50 cassette single of "Milky
Way" and left the album for some
richer person to buy.
