### Bernardo Silva 
Descendents
"Liveage!!"

Girlfriend/boyfriend left you
for another? The "in-crowd"
makes fun of you because of the
way you dress? Parents give you
shit about everything? Someone
fart in your van?
These novellas of teenage
angst and growing up form the
heart of one of the other kings
of the Los Angeles underground
punk scene, the Descendents. As
its title suggests, "Liveage!!" is
a live 18-track "retrospective"
on SST records, featuring
performances of material from
the band's five previous re
leases.

This album is also the band's
last release (for now); lead
singer and anima Milo Aucker
man has once again decided to
leave the band for graduate
study in biochemistry — no lie.
Thus, "Liveage!!" stands as a
veritable homage to one of the
greatest bands there ever was
— right up there with, uh, Big
Black. That's right — Big Black.
Even in their early punk
beginnings, the band stood
apart and above other groups
both in terms of whiplashing
power — pop guitar — and,
most importantly, in potent
lyrics that almost all normal

teens could relate to. For exam
ple, "I'm Not A Loser" exposes
the stuck-up rich kids you loved
to hate in high school: "You
think that life is really tough/
When your daddy won't buy you
a brand new car. . ./ Cruising
down the boulevard wasting
mommy's gas."
"Surburban Home" lampoons
the new materialism of our gen
eration: "I don't want no hippie
pad/ I want a house just like
Mom and Dad." Their largest
theme by far is lost and unful
filled love. Sample lyrics? "She
needs beer, she doesn't need
me." How about this: "You're
already thinking about someone

else/ When he comes home
you'll be in his arms and I'll be
gone/ But I know my day will
come. . ./ Sitting there with your
mouth full of beer. . ./ Who's
going to pick you up and use
you for tonight?/ Not me."
Yup. All that angst and
telling-it-like-it-is on one record.
Live to boot. Pretty good quality
also, but I'd recommend buying
all their other records in addi
tion to this one — you don't
want to miss a single bite. Oh,
the CD version of "Liveage!!"
has two extra tracks on it. Yes,
it's out on CD also. Sign of the
times, I guess. But this band
really deserves it. No lie.
