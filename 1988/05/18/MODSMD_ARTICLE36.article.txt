# Album Review
## Prince overdoes and underdresses

Prince
" Lovesexy"

Prince has been poised on the
edge of stupidity for the past few
years, and now he's finally taken
the flying leap into the abyss.
Maybe he finds the company of
White Lion and Whitney Houston
stimulating; I wish I knew.
The artist's latest album,
"Lovesexy," is the worst thing
he's committed to vinyl the decade
he's been in the music business.
Since "Purple Rain," Prince has
released four albums, and each
one has had its share of duds and
gristle, but none of them sinks as
mightily under the weight of the
man's battening pretensions as
this one does.
The nude cover is at first
moderately amusing, but once you
have listened to the music, you
realize what a perfect symbol of
Prince's hubris the cover really
is. This album's a real yapper.
There is, most glaringly of all,
no funk on this album. Whatever
beat there is gets concealed under
layers of guitar, organ, tam
bourine, voice-over, and assorted

noise. Prince probably thinks this
layered approach is creative and
inspiring, but when his music
makes your head throb instead of
bop, you know something's
wrong.
It could be argued that to expect
Prince to perpetually grind out
those entertaining dance grooves
<for the predominantly white
crowd that can afford discos) is
racist, akin to the sentiment that
ghettoized Marvin Gaye until he
shoved "What's Going On" in the
faces of Motown executives. But
funk has always been Prince's
foundation. He's made a bushel
of definitive and innovative music
predicated on the notion that a
black artist could base his music
in a tight groove and use that as
a launching pad to delve into
other musical arenas — whether
those arenas included rock, jazz
or folk.
Prince, in fact, has built a
career on exploding the racism of
the music industry. Most of the
dance music on the radio in the
past four years has owed a direct
debt to the exhilarating embrace
Prince has given to the entire set
of rock styles. I defy anybody to
point to 10 current dance hits and
not find at least three tracks that

are not pale derivatives of grooves
Prince has already used.
But Prince is not expanding or
exploding with this album; he
seems content to flounder. He's
surrounded himself with a bunch
of musicians who merely follow
his dictatorial directives rather
than prod him.
It looked like these musicians
might have potential on his last
album, the ambitious "Sign of the
Times," but that ambition is his
tory now. The music is a hodge
podge of murk; it's a dense stylis
tic broth, but there's no meat in
it. For the most part, it relies
heavily on guitar, a fact which
one reviewer has taken to be a
return to the adventurous
heterogeneity of "Purple Rain."
This same reviewer, who writes
for the Los Angeles Times, is of
the opinion that "Lovesexy" is the
most personal work Prince has
ever committed to vinyl. This may
be so, but that fact is a weakness,
not a strength. The lyrics are play
ful, and sometimes even fascinat
ing, but for the most part they
either tumble off into rambling
nonsense or get buried in the ver
tiginous mix.
There's a heavy religious em
phasis here — the themes deal

more explicitly with God and
heaven and the lack or presence
of sex in the divine scheme of
thingß than any previous album
— but there's very little rhapsody
about it. It's more like Prince has
fallen into a cultic trance he can't
get out of.
Tracks like "Positivity" and
"Alphabet Street" (which, of
course, harks back to the Jackson
Five's "ABC" — it's a sad day
when Prince starts relying on Mi
chael Jackson for new ideas) al
most connect. And there's that
tantalizing edge' throughout the
album, that feeling that it

could've amounted to something
if he'd put just a bit more work
into it instead of succumbing to
his own lazy excesses, but the ten
sion is never put to good use.
You end the album feeling
gypped. You end the album say
ing, "I would've expected this crap
out of Midge Ure or Madonna.
But Prince?"
The only consolation here is
that there is an album — on boot
leg — that, from all indications,
marks Prince's true return to
form. God only knows why
Warner Brothers, in its eminent
judgment, decided that "Alphabet

Street" would be more commer
cial than "2 Nigs United for West
Compton" (from the so-called
"Black Album").
If racism is the topic here, then
the stodginess of the music in
dustry is the first thing that
should be investigated, and the
little political ploy that saw this
trash get released and the "Black
Album" embargoed is the first
case that should be docketed.
Maybe Warner Brothers will
change its tune when this album
fails to go gold, which I predict
it will.
