Looking at the statistics, you'd
think there was no choice. But
somehow it didn't quite work
out that way.

Coach Tim Baldwin received the disappointing
news that his team did not receive the final
at-large invitation to this year's NCAA Cham
pionships. Kentucky was chosen instead.
The tournament, to be held next week at
New Mexico State, features the top 14 teams
in the country as well as three teams chosen
at large. In addition, 10 individuals from Di
vision I schools not receiving bids are invited.
Stanford senior Kay Cornelius and freshman
Jodi Figley are among those 10 individuals.
The other two teams chosen at large were
Ohio State and host New Mexico State. Ohio
State was an automatic choice, as the NCAA
requires that one team from each region be
invited. Although 22nd in the nation, the
Buckeyes were the highest-ranked team from
the Midwest region.
New Mexico State would have received an
at-large bid even if they were not the host
team. They finished the season ranked 15th
in the nation, and according to Baldwin,
"When the host team is that close to receiving
(an automatic) bid, they have to be invited."
Team rankings are determined by the NCAA
handicap system, which averages a team's top
-14 differentials. A team differential is calcu
lated by subtracting the team's score from the
course rating, a standard used to compare
relative difficulty of courses.
The Cardinal was ranked 16th in the nation
and 15th by the average of all rounds played,
while Kentucky was 17th according to both
methods. The difference in average differential
between the two schools on both scales was
more than a full stroke, "a huge margin when
deciding on at-large bids," Baldwin said.
"Going by 3tats alone, which has been their
criterion all season, there was no choice," la
mented Baldwin.
The selection committee is comprised of one
representative from each of the nation's five
regions: Far West, West, Midwest, South and
Mid-Atlantic. One reason given by the NCAA
selection committee for selecting Kentucky was
that the Wildcats played a stronger schedule
that the Cardinal.
But golfers from the Bluegrass State have
only played against five teams invited to
NCAAs, while the Cardinal has played against
10 of the of the other 16 teams invited.
Members of the selection committee also
claimed that Kentucky's five best players were
better than Stanford's. Comparing top players,
Stanford's Cornelius is ranked seventh, while
Kentucky's Kate Rogerson is 10th. Figley is
ranked 17th, while Kentucky does not have
another player in the top 50.
