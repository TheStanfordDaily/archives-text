# Rice-a-Roni for Irish
## 
### 
SOUTH BEND, Ind., May 13
— It's 141 days until the Stanford
Cardinal visits "Touchdown
Jesus" and Notre Dame Stadium,
but the Fighting Irish students
are already licking their chops.
"Stanford?" Six Irish football
fans, barely distracted by the
cafeteria food in front of them,
are a bit confused. "We play Stan
ford next year? (Coach Lou) Holtz
must be looking for some Rice-a-
Roni, a San Francisco treat."

In addition to sharp wit, Notre
Dame looks to have a national
championship-contending team
next fall. In one preseason poll,
the Irish were ranked fourth, and
with seven home games on the
schedule, the South Bend faithful
may have reason to be giddy.
The Notre Dame opponents,
however, are as usual a for
midable group. The independent
Irish will play Michigan, Michigan
State, Pittsburgh, Miami, Penn
State and USC. The Oct. 1 visit
by Stanford and the Nov. 5 home
game against Rice (sans Roni)
University appear to be couple of
eyes in an autumn-long hur
ricane.
The Stanford-Notre Dame
matchup will not just be a one
year apparition, by the way. The
two institutions have agreed to
play each other for at least eight
out of the next 10 years, and pos
sibly 10 more years to follow.
Gone are pigskin powers Ala
bama and Boston College from
the Irish schedule.
M I think Athletic Director Dick
Rosenthal wanted to play more
academic teams," said Marty
Strasen, the sports editor of the

campus newspaper, The Obser
ver. "It was like, let's not set out
to weaken the schedule, but let's
play somebody on our academic
level."
Thus the potential for an inter
esting rivalry is born. Interesting
not just on the field, but in the
stands and in the atmospheres.
This may come as a shock to
Cardinal fans, but at Notre Dame,
if you are a student you stand for
the entire football game. And this
may sound alien to the Irish, but
if you are a Stanford student, you
kick back and sip wine coolers
and ask, "What down is it?"
At Notre Dame, football is
forever trying to muscle its way
into the holy trinity. On the side
of the library, a mosaic messiah
with arms held aloft strategically
hovers over the brick stadium.
Best seat in the world.
The stadium seats 59,075, as
in there are 59,075 people there
every game. The playing field is
natural grass — so natural that
the blades are attacking the 15
feet of concrete that separates the
players from the fans.
The Irish players include guys
named Mike Stonebreaker, Andy
Heck and (no joke) Flash Gordon.
And although Heisman Trophy
winner Tim Brown is now in
Raider black, sophomore Ricky
Watters is already being called
Brown-like.
The no-nonsense defense led by
Ned Bolcar is what the Irish fans
like best, and those fans will give
the Cardinal an earful.
"When the visitors have the ball
the whole comer where the stu
dents are is yelling like crazy. It's
deafening," Strasen said.
On big third-down plays, the
Irish students will whip out and
shake their keys. It's a key play,
get it? At Stanford Stadium the
Cardinal students shake their
keys when something boring is
happening.
Here's hoping that over the
next decade the keys won't be
shaking for boredom.
