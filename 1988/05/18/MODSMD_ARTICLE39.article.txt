" LOS ANGELES -
When Lisa Green
won the first set of
her third-round
singles match yes
terday against
JUSC's Trisha

Laux, she thought back to last
Saturday's team semifinal when
Laux beat her by winning the sec
ond and third sets.
"Last time I let up (after the
first set)," Green said. "Today I
just tried to keep the pressure
__ »»
on.
Before Laux knew what hit her,
Green built an insurmountable 4-
0 second-set lead. The Stanford
sophomore finished off the
second-seeded Laux 7-6 (7-0), 6-3
and later defeated Brigham
Young's Susanna Lee 6-2, 6-2 to
reach the semifinals of the NCAA
singles tournament for the second
year in a row.
Green will meet third-seeded
Halle Cioffi of Florida today at
noon at UCLA's Los Angeles Ten
nis Center. Cioffi is the nation's
top-ranked singles player, but
Green beat her 6-4, 6-2 in Sun
day's team championship match.
"I don't really think, 'Oh, I beat
her last time, so I should beat
her today,' " Green said. "She can
definitely hurt me. She's a real
good player. She's got a lot of
weapons."
Green had more than enough
weapons yesterday to oust Laux.
Her serve, which was shaky in
her first meeting with Laux,
picked up yesterday. "My serve
was good. That was the difference.
My first serve went in a lot more,"
Green said.
Laux had her chances in the
first set. She led 4-2, but Green
held her serve and then broke
Laux to get even at 4-4. Laux
broke back and was serving for
the set at 5-4, but she couldn't
hold and they eventually went to
a tiebreaker.
Then the roof caved in on Laux.
The next time she won a point
she had already lost the first set
and was trailing 2-0 in the second.
Green rattled off seven straight
points in the first-set tiebreaker
and continued the barrage by win
ning the first 11 points of the
second set. By the time the
onslaught was over, Laux was
hopelessly behind 4-0.
Green didn't cool of! much in
her quarterfinal match against
Lee. With the score knotted 2-2
in the first set, Green continued
her streaky day by winning the

next eight games to secure her
passage into the semifinals.

seed, against Florida's fourth

had beaten her 6-4, 6-2 in Sun
day's team final. The tables were
turned yesterday as Stafford
posted a 6-4, 6-1 victory to move
into the quarterfinals.
Stafford said that yesterday's
win did not make up for losing
to Stanford Sunday. "It doesn't
really ease the pain," she said.
"I'm just kind of disgusted I didn't
do it earlier."
Whitlinger took a 2-0 lead in
the first set, but a tight quadricep
in her left leg quickly caught up
with her as Stafford moved her
around the court with a variety
of shots.
"Before when I played her I
just hit hard balls. I never did
anything different," Stafford said.
"(Yesterday) I just played smart.
I took my time, I relaxed."
Stafford advanced to the semi
finals later in the day with a 6-4,
7-5 over California's Karen Shin.

four singles semifinalists to return to

final four of the NCAA singles championships. Today she faces the nation's top-ranked
player, Halle Cioffl of Florida, whom Green beat in the team finals on Sunday.
" LOS ANGELES -
When Lisa Green
won the first set of
her third-round
singles match yes
terday against
JUSC's Trisha

Laux, she thought back to last
Saturday's team semifinal when
Laux beat her by winning the sec
ond and third sets.
"Last time I let up (after the
first set)," Green said. "Today I
just tried to keep the pressure
__ »»
on.
Before Laux knew what hit her,
Green built an insurmountable 4-
0 second-set lead. The Stanford
sophomore finished off the
second-seeded Laux 7-6 (7-0), 6-3
and later defeated Brigham
Young's Susanna Lee 6-2, 6-2 to
reach the semifinals of the NCAA
singles tournament for the second
year in a row.
Green will meet third-seeded
Halle Cioffi of Florida today at
noon at UCLA's Los Angeles Ten
nis Center. Cioffi is the nation's
top-ranked singles player, but
Green beat her 6-4, 6-2 in Sun
day's team championship match.
"I don't really think, 'Oh, I beat
her last time, so I should beat
her today,' " Green said. "She can
definitely hurt me. She's a real
good player. She's got a lot of
weapons."
Green had more than enough
weapons yesterday to oust Laux.
Her serve, which was shaky in
her first meeting with Laux,
picked up yesterday. "My serve
was good. That was the difference.
My first serve went in a lot more,"
Green said.
Laux had her chances in the
first set. She led 4-2, but Green
held her serve and then broke
Laux to get even at 4-4. Laux
broke back and was serving for
the set at 5-4, but she couldn't
hold and they eventually went to
a tiebreaker.
Then the roof caved in on Laux.
The next time she won a point
she had already lost the first set
and was trailing 2-0 in the second.
Green rattled off seven straight
points in the first-set tiebreaker
and continued the barrage by win
ning the first 11 points of the
second set. By the time the
onslaught was over, Laux was
hopelessly behind 4-0.
Green didn't cool of! much in
her quarterfinal match against
Lee. With the score knotted 2-2
in the first set, Green continued
her streaky day by winning the

next eight games to secure her
passage into the semifinals.
Today's other semifinal pits
Miami's Ronni Reis, the No. 1
seed, against Florida's fourth
seeded Shaun Stafford.
In yesterday's third round,
Stafford got even with Stanford
freshman Teri Whitlinger, who
had beaten her 6-4, 6-2 in Sun
day's team final. The tables were
turned yesterday as Stafford
posted a 6-4, 6-1 victory to move
into the quarterfinals.
Stafford said that yesterday's
win did not make up for losing
to Stanford Sunday. "It doesn't
really ease the pain," she said.
"I'm just kind of disgusted I didn't
do it earlier."
Whitlinger took a 2-0 lead in
the first set, but a tight quadricep
in her left leg quickly caught up
with her as Stafford moved her
around the court with a variety
of shots.
"Before when I played her I
just hit hard balls. I never did
anything different," Stafford said.
"(Yesterday) I just played smart.
I took my time, I relaxed."
Stafford advanced to the semi
finals later in the day with a 6-4,
7-5 over California's Karen Shin.
Shin had beaten Stanford senior
Kay Tittle 6-2, 6-2 in a third
round morning match.

finals, the doubles quarterfinals
