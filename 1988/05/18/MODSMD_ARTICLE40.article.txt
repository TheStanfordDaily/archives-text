# Mango Tarango a real competitor
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
With Jeff Tarango, one gets the
sense anything's possible.
Tarango, the No. 1 singles
player on the top-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team, has the grit,
talent and character to win next
week's NCAA singles champion
ships.
Unlike many top-flight
amateurs who leave college early,
the sophomore also combines his
"tennis job" of the future with a
commitment to completing his
undergraduate degree in creative
writing and philosophy.
But what really makes the
player they call "Mango" go, as a
student as well as an athlete, is
his penchant for competition. He
likes nothing better than to plunk
his rackets on the ground, per
form before a crowd, and battle
it out on the court with the na
tion's best.
"He's a great competitor,"
senior teammate Patrick
McEnroe said. "He's a fighter. I
know I can count on him in a
tough situation. He's a good guy
to have in there when the chips
are down."
In addition to his intense com
petitiveness, fans ei\joy watching
Tarango's antics on the court.
Heading an occasional ball, inking
the letters 'SIT on his strings or
questioning an umpire's eyesight
are as much a part of his play as
his sizzling forehands.
Tarango is spontaneous on the
court; an observer can tell by
Tarango's confident gait — or his
yelps — just how he's competing
on a given day.
"I'm so used to giving 100 per
cent on the court," Tarango said.
"I have a lot of fun playing tennis,
and I'm really competitive. At the
same time, I'm really emotional;
I'm myself out there."
The nation's No. 6 player en

tering the 104 th NCAA Tennis
Championships in Athens, Ga.
this weekend, Tarango has turned
his counterpunching junior tennis
style into an effective offensive
weapon.
As a junior, Tarango often
clawed his way to wins over the
top international players on sheer
determination. His serve was in
effective, his backhand volley
shaky and his game defensive.
But after playing No. 1 last year
as a freshman and besting such
highly regarded players as USC's
Rick Leach, Tarango made a jump
in his game by converting his solid
groundstrokes into offensive
shots. He gained All-America
honors and reached the second
round of the NCAAs.
This season, Tarango has im
proved his serve and his volley to
the point where he no longer has
any glaring weaknesses. He cap
tured the Hobee's Northern Cal
ifornia Intercollegiate Tennis
Championships last February,
was a finalist at the Pacific 10
Conference Championships in
April, and made the semifinals at
the Volvo/All-America tourna
ment last fall.
In addition, Tarango and
partner David Wheaton are the
nation's No. 3 doubles tandem.
When all cylinders are clicking,
Tarango's punishing forehands
from the baseline and superb
return of serve is reminiscent of
former UCLA star Jimmy Con
nors.
"Jeff Tarango is probably the
most improved player in college
tennis," Stanford Coach Dick
Gould said. "He's a feisty com
petitor who's one of the best team
plaers I've ever had here. He can
beat anyone in college tennis
when he controls the tempo of
the match."
"Day by day, I see myself get

ting better both mentally and
physically," Tarango said. "I've
been hitting the ball a lot harder.
Players have a hard time attack
ing against me because I hit the
bail right through them."
While not at Stanford, Tarango
— a member of the U.S. Junior
Davis Cup team — is coached by
Robert Lansdrop of Los Angeles.
He will play professionally when
he graduates, but for now hones
in on concentrating on what he
does so well at Stanford — com
peting, improving and winning.
Tarango was 16-7 last season and
is 31-14 this year.
If Tarango's game comes to
gether in Athens, his zeal to com
pete at the NCAAs just might pro
vide him with the winning edge,
converting this possibility into an
NCAA singles title.
