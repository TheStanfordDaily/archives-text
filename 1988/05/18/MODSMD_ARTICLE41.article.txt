### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The left side of Stanford's in
field was placed intact on the
All-Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division team an
nounced yesterday.
Cardinal third baseman Ed
Sprague and shortstop Troy

Paulsen were the only Stanford players named
to a team that predictably was dominated by
conference champion Arizona State.
ASU pitcher Linty Ingram was named Six-
Pac Player of the Year, and Sun Devil skipper
Jim Brock was named Coach of the Year.
ASU also landed four other players on the
all-conference team.
Oddly, the six head coaches who voted for
the team selected seven infielders, only three
outfielders and made no honorable mention
selections. Last year five outfielders were

named to the team and 25 players were named
honorable mention.
Sprague, a junior, was one of only three
repeating All-Six-Pac selections, along with
UCLA first baseman Eric Karros and Califor
nia outfielder Todd Mayo. Sprague batted .349
in the regular season, led the league in home
runs with 19, and was fourth in RBI with 71.
Paulsen, a sophomore who played in only
nine games last year before incurring a season
ending knee injury, started all 58 of Stanford's
games this year, batting .349 with 20 doubles,
seven home runs and 41 RBI. His school
record 28-game hitting streak, which
stretched from March 6 to April 29, was one
of the highlights of the season.
Stanford, which finished second in the Six-
Pac with an 18-12 record and is 37-21 overall,
will begin NCAA regional play next Wednes
day or Thursday, depending on which regional
the team is assigned to.
The NCAA will announce final regional as

signments and seedings next Monday.
Following is the 1988 All-Six-Pac Team, as
voted on by the head coaches of the six teams
in the conference:
• Infielders: Bret Barberie (SS), USC; Kevin
Higgins (2B), ASU; Eric Karros (IB), UCLA;
Troy Paulsen (SS), Stanford; Rodney Peete
(3B), USC; Steve Willis (IB), ASU.
• Outfielders: Kevin Long, Arizona; Todd
Mayo, Cal; Dan Rumsey, ASU.
• Catcher: Jim Campanis, USC.
• Starting pitchers: Mike Magnante, UCLA;
Bias Minor, ASU.
• Relief pitcher: Joe Buckley, Cal.
• Utility: Frank Halcovich (P-DH), Arizona.
Card notes
Arizona proved the old adage that good pitching
is more important than good hitting. The Wildcats
led the Six-Pac in hitting, with a team batting
average of .329, but were last in the league in
pitching, with a team ERA of 6.20.
