An article in yesterday's
Daily on a meeting to dis
cuss proposed structures for
the Latino community mis
represented the role played
at the meeting by MEChA.
Terms such as "snub" and
"undermine," as used in the
headline and the article,
made it appear that MEChA
was working against at
tempts to unify the Latino
community. At the meeting,
however, MEChA members
said they support commu
nity unification, but that
they believed any decision
on the structure of the com
munity should be delayed
until tension among differ
ent Latino groups subsides.
Further, the article did
not explain that the 82 stu
dents who signed a petition
favoring the delay were not
necessarily MEChA mem
bers. There was no organ
ized boycott among the pe
tition signers, as the article
said. Though some petition
signers went to the meeting,
many decided not to attend
because they did not want
to encourage debate that
could lead to further divi
siveness.
The article also failed to
report that the meeting
ended with overwhelming
agreement to postpone a de
cision on the community's
structure until the fall.
In addition, comments
made by Casa Zapata Resi
dent Fellow Cecilia Burciaga
were taken out of context
and failed to acknowledge
Burciaga's high praise of
students in the community.
