# Martin Luther King professorship
## Prof. awarded Centennial Chair 
### Erik Johnson 
The Board of Trustees last week appointed An
thropology Prof. James Gibbs the first occupant of
the newly endowed chair honoring Martin Luther
King Jr.
The Martin Luther King Jr. Centennial Chair is
the third of 12 chairs the trustees are endowing to
honor faculty members who have made significant
contributions to undergraduate education here. It
is also one of the 100 chairs in the humanities the
trustees plan to create with money raised in the
University's $1.1 billion Centennial fund-raising
campaign.
Gibbs, who chairs the Anthropology Department,
was named to the position for its five-year duration
beginning last Tuesday.
Provost James Rosse said Gibbs was chosen for
his work in African and Afro-American studies,
anthropology and undergraduate education.
"He's been a guiding light in the African and
Afro-American Studies Department," Rosse said,
adding that he hopes Gibbs will continue to work
in the departments of Anthropology and Afro-
American Studies.
Stanford has been interested in establishing the
chair for a long time, according to spokesman Bob
Martin of the Office of Development, the Univer
sity's fund-raising department. For more than 10
years donors have expressed interest in creating a
chair for the slain civil rights leader, Martin said.
A permanent fund of $1 million has been estab
lished to fund the chair, according to David Fulton,
director of communications in Development. The
University provided about $500,000 for the endow

ment. San Diego resident Sol Price, owner of the
the Price Club discounting chain, supplied $250,000,
and three anonymous Palo Alto families donated
the remaining $250,000.
Gibbs said he considers the appointment a "per
sonal honor, but also an acknowledgement of the
role of blacks in general at Stanford. I knew Martin
Luther King, and it's an honor to hold a chair
honoring him and the ideas he represented."
Gibbs, whose term as the head of the Anthropol
ogy Department lasts two more years, said he does
not think the King chair will interfere with his
work in that position.
The chair "won't involve any change in my role.
I'll continue with a regular teaching load for two
years," Gibbs said.
"In the third or fourth year of the chair, I'll
hopefully have a sabbatical, during which I'll be
working on new course ideas," Gibbs said. One of
the primary goals in establishing the Centennial
chairs is to encourage the creation of new courses
for undergraduates.
Gibbs said he sees the creation of the King chair
as "another step" in Stanford's efforts to recognize
King's legacy and to thereby encourage more mi
nority students to apply to Stanford.
"At (King's] death, Stanford committed to diver
sify the student body, and that effort has paid off
dramatically," Gibbs said. In addition, "there has
long been an interest at Stanford in Martin Luther
King's ideas," according to Gibbs.
Gibbs said the King chair represents the Univer
sity's continued commitment to recognizing minor
ity issues.
