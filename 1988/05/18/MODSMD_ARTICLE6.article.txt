# Senate rejects report's conclusions on racism
## OKs recommendations despite inadequate inquiry 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night to
"disavow" the conclusions of the senate
task force that determined that institu
tional racism existed in ASSU hiring prac
tices this year.
However, the senate did approve a num
ber of the task force's recommendations
to improve the hiring process.
The hiring process was called into ques
tion earlier this spring when the Black
Student Union charged that racial bias may
have been a factor in several recent ASSU
hiring decisions.
The task force report, which was released
Monday, determined that institutional rac
ism was apparent in the selection processes
for the director of the Speakers Bureau,
chair of the Nominations Commission and
director of the Office of Public Affairs —
three cases that the BSU said were marked
by institutional racism.
But the senate approved a resolution to
reject the task force's conclusions "as being

based on an incomplete presentation of the
factual background and inadequate inves
tigation." The resolution passed on a 13-1
vote with four abstentions.
Many senators emphasized that the res
olution does not necessarily deny the ex
istence of institutional racism in the ASSU,
but rather faults the way in which the
task force arrived at its conclusions.
Most senators expressed their discontent,
and some expressed anger, with the "His
tory" section of the report, which deter
mined that racial bias affected this year's
process. Senator Timur Colak, a junior,
called the report's findings "completely ri
diculous" because he had not been con
tacted by the task force, even though he
was a member of the Speakers Bureau
director selection committee.
Graduate senator Don Gagliardi, a third
year law student, disagreed with the "con
clusions of fact" presented in the report
concerning this year's selection process. "I
don't think there is enough evidence [stated
in the report] to prove racism oc
curred," he said.
But some senators and Council
of Presidents member Roechelle
Smith, a junior, agreed with the
report's conclusions despite pos
sible deficiencies in the task
force's investigation.
Smith said that the report was
an effort to "make sure the ASSU
is addressing the problem of in
stitutional racism. Yes, it does ex
ist in the ASSU, and yes, it is
subtle."
Many senators objected to the
report's implications that certain
individuals were racist, but task
force member and senator Brett
Mahoney, a senior, pointed out
that no individuals were charged
with racism in the report. "We're
all victims of institutional racism
— the whole body of the ASSU,"
he said, adding that the task force

emphasized concrete safeguards
against racism rather than pin
pointing individuals as being
racist.
Even though the task force's
methods of investigation drew
scathing criticism, Senate Chair
Dave Smolen, a senior, expressed
satisfaction with the report.
"Everybody here agrees that the
recommendations were good and
that a lot of good was accom
plished" by the task force, he said.
The seven-person task force,
which was appointed by Smolen,
was organized to revamp the
ASSU'B hiring policy following
numerous problems with this
year's hiring process, including al
legations of racism.
The task force decided not to
conduct a full investigation of the
racism charges because it did not
have enough time and because it
wanted to focus on revising the
interview process, Smolen said.
Despite many senators' discon
tent with the task force's failure

to conduct a thorough investiga
tion into the charges, the senate
almost unanimously approved a
number of revisions of ASSU
bylaws proposed by the task force.
Most senators also expressed sup
port for extending the period for
interviews and other administra
tive guidelines suggested in the
task force report.
The senate unanimously ap
proved changes to bylaws that ex
pand the size of the interviewing
committee from three to five
people, specify the makeup of each
committee and require a quorum
of four committee members for
any decision to be valid.
The senate also approved a gen
eral non-discrimination statement
that will be written into the
bylaws for the first time.
In other business, the senate
confirmed the appointments of
sophomore Sheilon King as next
year's administrative manager
and of senior Valerie Huang as
next year's financial manager.
