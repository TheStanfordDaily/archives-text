# Defense makes appeal
## Validity of 'launch on warning' case undecided 
### Andrea Kohn 
Only time will tell
whether an attack aimed
at the U.S. government's
"launch on warning" nu
clear defense system will
be repelled.
Three judges heard oral
arguments Friday in the
case of Johnson v. Secre
tary of Defense, in which
Stanford computer scien
tist Clifford Johnson is

suing former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
The panel of judges is not expected to
decide on the validity of the case for at
least another two weeks and the process
could take up to four months.
In his suit, Johnson alleges that the U.S.

"launch on warning" nuclear defense sys
tem is unconstitutional because it usurps
presidential and congressional power to
declare war.
The case, which has been dismissed a
number of times since Johnson's original
charges in 1984, is an appeal of a 1987
district court ruling that the case is a po
litical issue, and therefore, outside of the
court's jurisdiction.
According to Bill Brockett, one of
Johnson's attorneys, the court must now
decide "whether or not the District Court
should dirty its hands with the law suit."
In a brief presented to the court, lawyers
representing Weinberger stated that
Johnson's claim is nothing more than an
attempt to litigate political disagreements
with U.S. defense policy.
