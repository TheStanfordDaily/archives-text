# Defense makes appeal
## Validity of 'launch on warning' case undecided 
### Andrea Kohn 
Only time will tell
whether an attack aimed
at the U.S. government's
"launch on warning" nu
clear defense system will
be repelled.
Three judges heard oral
arguments Friday in the
case of Johnson v. Secre
tary of Defense, in which
Stanford computer scien
tist Clifford Johnson is

suing former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
The panel of judges is not expected to
decide on the validity of the case for at
least another two weeks and the process
could take up to four months.
In his suit, Johnson alleges that the U.S.

"launch on warning" nuclear defense sys
tem is unconstitutional because it usurps
presidential and congressional power to
declare war.
The case, which has been dismissed a
number of times since Johnson's original
charges in 1984, is an appeal of a 1987
district court ruling that the case is a po
litical issue, and therefore, outside of the
court's jurisdiction.
According to Bill Brockett, one of
Johnson's attorneys, the court must now
decide "whether or not the District Court
should dirty its hands with the law suit."
In a brief presented to the court, lawyers
representing Weinberger stated that
Johnson's claim is nothing more than an
attempt to litigate political disagreements
with U.S. defense policy.

However, rather than directly
concentrating on the political na
ture of the suit, the court asked
the two parties to argue Johnson's
"standing" — or right to bring
suit for damages not yet incurred
—• in an attempt to examine all
facets of the case.
Weinberger contends that
Johnson, manager of capacity
planning for the Stanford Data
Center, is unable to demonstrate
injury in fact, nor does his alleged
injury differ from the interests of
any U.S. citizen.
Johnson, however, stated that
"a present threat to one's life has
traditionally been grounds for
granting standing. That is the
common-sense approach."
Even more important, Brockett
said, is that the threat alleged in
this case is different from other
suits. "No decision before has

dealt with a harm that has af
fected everyone. This is an impor
tant injury because we're talking
about everyone being vaporized.
"The harm here is important
enough that we should put aside
technical considerations of stand
ing," he said.
Although the case against the
U.S. "launch on warning" nuclear
defense system raises life-and
death concerns, Brockett found
time to take a jab at the Reagan
administration, saying, "having
an error-prone computer chip
make a decision is similar to
having an astrologer make deci
sions."
Humor aside, Brockett, a mem
ber of the Lawyers Alliance for
Nuclear Arms Control, said he
does consider this an important,
precedent-setting case, so impor
tant that neither he nor
Johnson's other lawyer, Tom Rob
ertson, are collecting legal fees.
Both Brockett and the Justice
Department refused to speculate
on the outcome of the case, which

Brockett hopes will answer the
question: "Should the power to
declare war be put in the hands
of a computer?"
Johnson, who is supported by
the Computer Professionals for
Social Responsibility, is taking a
wait-and-see approach. "We'll
wait for the ruling and decide
where to go from there," he said.
If the case were to reach the
Supreme Court, Johnson would
be looking for a decision that the
"launch on warning" system vi
olates the Fifth Amendment to
the Constitution, specifically the
right to life, liberty and the due
process of law.
Johnson, dressed as the Revolu
tionary War hero Thomas Paine,
demonstrated with approximately
40 other people before the hearing
in San Francisco last Friday.
"We had a lot of fun," said
Johnson, who added that the
protest was an effective means of
communicating his peaceful mes
sage.
