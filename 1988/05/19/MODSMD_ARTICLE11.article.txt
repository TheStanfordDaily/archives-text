# Stanford-in-Greece scratches surface of ancient civilization
## 
### Mari Yamaguohi 
Since its founding in 1985, stu
dents enrolled in Stanford's over
seas program in Greece have un
covered important pieces of Greek
history among the artifacts in a
region that was first inhabited by
humans more than 3,000 years
ago.
Organized by the Classics De
partment, Stanford-in-Greece
sends eight students each summer
to the Skourta Plain, a remote
mountain basin 1,800 feet above
the Aegean Sea not far from Ath
ens, where they spend six weeks
combing its surface for traces of
past civilizations.
The program is a scholarly re
search project designed to deter
mine where and how ancient
peoples settled on the plain from
prehistoric to medieval times.

With the work the team has
already completed, Stanford stu
dents will "be able to contribute
to understanding how the ancient
humans settled, as well as contri
buting physical evidence to the
study of archaeology," said Isaac
Barchas, a junior who will partic
ipate in the program this summer.
In the two years since they
began the program, participants
have uncovered evidence that sug
gests that battles between war
riors from' Thebes, the chief city
of ancient Boiotia, and Athenians
may have destroyed all the vil
lages on the plain.
The plain, which had been a
major agricultural and trading
center up to that time, was aban
doned after this possible assault
for approximately 500 years, be
tween 950 B.C. and 450 B.C.
The Stanford team was able to

place this period in history after
discovering no traces of human
habitation on the plain between
those dates. Although artifacts
from the period had been found
in abundance outside the plain,
students in the Stanford program
discovered the remains of
farmhouses on the Skourta Plain
which were built between 450
B.C. and 200 B.C.
These remains were discovered
in two of the villages that had
been destroyed, Loutsa and Iyios
Dimitrios, an area that simply
"looks like open fields" today, ac
cording to Classics Prof. Mark
Munn, director of the program.
The findings will provide infor
mation about how Athenians
dealt with remote areas when the
population in Athens started to
grow and sought new lands to
accommodate its inhabitants,
Munn said.
Another important discovery
included the unearthing of a semi
precious red stone that used to
be on a ring and is carved with
a satyr, a mythical creature com
bined of a man and a goat.
The group also discovered coins
dating from the period 350 to 250
8.C., from 300 to 600 A.D. and
from the medieval era, Munn said.
Among them were two Venetian
coins from the 14th century,
which indicate that Venice, a com
mercial center at the time, con
troled all trade in the area.
In two more summers, partici
pants in the program will be able
to cover close to 50 percent of the
plain, according to Munn.
For almost eight hours a day
for a six-week period during the
hot Greek summer, the team in
a single line, up and down through
the fields and forests of the plain

searched for artifacts.
The hardest part, according to
senior Cheryl House, who partic
ipated in the program last year,
was "to get up at 5:30 in the
morning," which the group does
every day.
"I guess it's going to be fun,
but hard work," Barchas said,
adding that he is "really looking

forward to it."
"It was great to participate di
rectly in archaeology," said
House, an anthropology mtyor.
So far, the project has involved
only an archaeological technique
known as surface survey because
deeper excavation would be too
time-consuming for the goals of
the program, said Munn, who ex

plained that the program tries
mainly to provide students with
a general idea of what ar
chaeological work is like.
"What we're looking for is not
gold but pot shells and roof tiles
without digging," said Munn.
He said, however, that surface
remains can provide information
equally as important as informa
tion gleaned from excavation.
The Stanford team studies its
findings at the dig site itself,
Munn explained. Students wash
the artifacts, try to identify them
and then measure and record the
discovery by making quick
sketches or taking photos, Munn
said. After examining the objects,
team members set aside any po
tentially important discoveries for
Greek authorities, who make
weekly inspections.
The Stanford-in-Greece sum
mer program is open to under
graduates from all mtyors who
have taken two required courses
from the Classics Department.
Additional study is recommended,
however. The deadline for appli
cations is in January and the pro
gram will begin this year June 24.

farmhouses on the Skourta Plain
which were built between 450
B.C. and 200 B.C.
These remains were discovered
in two of the villages that had
been destroyed, Loutsa and Iyios
Dimitrios, an area that simply
"looks like open fields" today, ac
cording to Classics Prof. Mark
Munn, director of the program.
The findings will provide infor
mation about how Athenians
dealt with remote areas when the
population in Athens started to
grow and sought new lands to
accommodate its inhabitants,
Munn said.
Another important discovery
included the unearthing of a semi
precious red stone that used to
be on a ring and is carved with
a satyr, a mythical creature com
bined of a man and a goat.
The group also discovered coins
dating from the period 350 to 250
8.C., from 300 to 600 A.D. and
from the medieval era, Munn said.
Among them were two Venetian
coins from the 14th century,
which indicate that Venice, a com
mercial center at the time, con
troled all trade in the area.
In two more summers, partici
pants in the program will be able
to cover close to 50 percent of the
plain, according to Munn.
For almost eight hours a day
for a six-week period during the
hot Greek summer, the team in
a single line, up and down through
the fields and forests of the plain

searched for artifacts.
The hardest part, according to
senior Cheryl House, who partic
ipated in the program last year,
was "to get up at 5:30 in the
morning," which the group does
every day.
"I guess it's going to be fun,
but hard work," Barchas said,
adding that he is "really looking

forward to it."
"It was great to participate di
rectly in archaeology," said
House, an anthropology mtyor.
So far, the project has involved
only an archaeological technique
known as surface survey because
deeper excavation would be too
time-consuming for the goals of
the program, said Munn, who ex

plained that the program tries
mainly to provide students with
a general idea of what ar
chaeological work is like.
"What we're looking for is not
gold but pot shells and roof tiles
without digging," said Munn.
He said, however, that surface
remains can provide information
equally as important as informa
tion gleaned from excavation.
The Stanford team studies its
findings at the dig site itself,
Munn explained. Students wash
the artifacts, try to identify them
and then measure and record the
discovery by making quick
sketches or taking photos, Munn
said. After examining the objects,
team members set aside any po
tentially important discoveries for
Greek authorities, who make
weekly inspections.
The Stanford-in-Greece sum
mer program is open to under
graduates from all mtyors who
have taken two required courses
from the Classics Department.
Additional study is recommended,
however. The deadline for appli
cations is in January and the pro
gram will begin this year June 24.
