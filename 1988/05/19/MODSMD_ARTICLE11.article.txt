# Stanford-in-Greece scratches surface of ancient civilization

Since its founding in 1985, stu
dents enrolled in Stanford's over
seas program in Greece have un
covered important pieces of Greek
history among the artifacts in a
region that was first inhabited by
humans more than 3,000 years
ago.
Organized by the Classics De
partment, Stanford-in-Greece
sends eight students each summer
to the Skourta Plain, a remote
mountain basin 1,800 feet above
the Aegean Sea not far from Ath
ens, where they spend six weeks
combing its surface for traces of
past civilizations.
The program is a scholarly re
search project designed to deter
mine where and how ancient
peoples settled on the plain from
prehistoric to medieval times.

With the work the team has
already completed, Stanford stu
dents will "be able to contribute
to understanding how the ancient
humans settled, as well as contri
buting physical evidence to the
study of archaeology," said Isaac
Barchas, a junior who will partic
ipate in the program this summer.
In the two years since they
began the program, participants
have uncovered evidence that sug
gests that battles between war
riors from' Thebes, the chief city
of ancient Boiotia, and Athenians
may have destroyed all the vil
lages on the plain.
The plain, which had been a
major agricultural and trading
center up to that time, was aban
doned after this possible assault
for approximately 500 years, be
tween 950 B.C. and 450 B.C.
The Stanford team was able to

place this period in history after
discovering no traces of human
habitation on the plain between
those dates. Although artifacts
from the period had been found
in abundance outside the plain,
students in the Stanford program
discovered the remains of
farmhouses on the Skourta Plain
which were built between 450
B.C. and 200 B.C.
These remains were discovered
in two of the villages that had
been destroyed, Loutsa and Iyios
Dimitrios, an area that simply
"looks like open fields" today, ac
cording to Classics Prof. Mark
Munn, director of the program.
The findings will provide infor
mation about how Athenians
dealt with remote areas when the
population in Athens started to
