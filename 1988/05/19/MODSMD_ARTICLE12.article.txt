Carlucci presses for mobile MX
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci has ordered full speed ahead for the
controversial rail version of the MX block
buster missile, approving $328.7 million in
contracts to build test versions of railroad cars
to carry and fire it, the Pentagon announced
yesterday.
Critics who back the rival Midgetman missile
charged last night that Carlucci was moving
so far ahead with the rail-mobile MX that the
next president might be locked in to this
deployment scheme.
Carlucci has championed putting the 10-
warhead MX on rails rather than confining
deployment to existing Minuteman silos, ar
guing that mobility would make the block
buster missile harder for the Soviets to target.
Opponents warned that the money Carlucci
has now earmarked in 1988 funds will be
supplemented by additional appropriations
when Congress finishes the fiscal 1989 Defense
Department budget, perhaps tipping the bal
ance toward the rail MX at the expense of the
proposed Midgetman, a much smaller missile
carrying a single warhead.
The American public will never accept the
idea of nuclear weapons being carried through
towns in railroad cars during periods of ten
sion, the opponents say, contending that going
ahead with the rail MX conflicts with the
Reagan administration's call for banning U.S.
and Soviet deployment of such mobile missiles
under a strategic arms reduction treaty
(START).
INF treaty survives challenge
WASHINGTON — The Senate easily
brushed aside a challenge to the validity of
the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty
from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., yesterday as
Senate leaders warned that such tactics could
delay expected approval of the pact beyond
the May 29-June 2 superpower summit in
Moscow.
Helms opened his anticipated assault on the
treaty with a point of order that Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev signed the pact with Pres
ident Reagan last December as general secre
tary of the Soviet Communist Party without
proper authorization from top officials of the
Soviet government.
Helms contended that such authorization is
required by Soviet law and said signing of the
treaty by Gorbachev was "the same as Paul
Kirk or Frank Fahrenkopf. . . going over there
and signing a treaty" as chairs, respectively,
of the Democratic and Republican national
committees.
Pro-treaty leaders responded that, under
what Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., called a
"common sense and wise judgment" principle
of international practice, the United States
had "no doubt" about Gorbachev's authority
to sign on behalf of the Soviet Union, and the
Senate agreed, 91 to 6.
Paraguay opposition lauds pope
ASUNCION, Paraguay — Pope John Paul
11, ending a tour of four Latin American na
tions yesterday on his 68th birthday, won
praise from Paraguayan opposition leaders for
his impassioned support for civil rights in one
of the region's few remaining dictatorships.
"This has been a powerful impulse for the
movement seeking change in this country,"
said Miguel Abbon Saguier, the leader of the
banned Authentic Liberal Radical Party, who
has been detained repeatedly since the 19605.
"This society is fragmented and divided, but
now this man has come and helped us over
come our hatred and differences."
John Paul emphasized his pastoral role and
never referred directly to the conflict between
the opposition and President Alfredo Stroes
sner, the 75-year-old general who has ruled
here for 34 years. But the pope spoke out
clearly for democracy with full and free par
ticipation in civic affairs by all citizens.
The focal point was a meeting with more
than 3,000 civic and opposition party leaders
Tuesday night that Stroessner's government
had tried to prohibit, saying it would be used
to provoke disorder. After pressure from the
Vatican and the Roman Catholic bishops in
Paraguay, who increasingly have attacked the
government over human rights abuses, the
government rescinded the ban and the meeting
went ahead.
FCC ruling threatens cable TV
WASHINGTON — In a policy reversal that
is likely to shake the cable television industry,
the Federal Communications Commission yes
terday offered local broadcasters exclusive
rights to syndicated programs as a way of
combatting the rising tide of television duplica
tion.
If the ruling goes into effect a year from
now as proposed, a local television station
could buy exclusive rights to air a popular
program such as "Magnum P. 1." or "MASH"
— now available in re-runs several times a
day on different channels in many markets
— and block competing cable stations from
scheduling that show.
FCC members asserted that their 3-0 deci-.
sion, hailed by jubilant broadcasters, should
end the "reign of reruns" that have plagued
the medium, encourage more varied program
ming and put local broadcasters back on an
even regulatory footing with cable and network
operators who already eryoy exclusivity.
But disgruntled cable industry representa
tives threatened to challenge the ruling in
court, and predicted blacked-out TV screens,
bankrupt operators and embittered viewers.
