# Bush indirectly criticizes Noriega dealings
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — Vice President
George Bush yesterday, in a rare break
with the Reagan administration, said
that if elected president he would not
"bargain with drug dealers . . .
whether they're on U.S. or foreign
soil," a reference to current plea bar
gaining with Panamanian military
leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
It was the first time Bush has openly
expressed opposition to the talks with
Noriega, who is under indictment by
two Florida grand juries on charges
of drug smuggling. The administration
has made several proposals to Noriega
under which the charges would be
dropped in exchange for his relinquish
ing power, touching off sharp protests
from Democrats and Republicans.
The likely Democratic presidential
nominee, Massachussets Gov. Michael
Dukakis, has been repeately attacking
Bush on the issue, saying he would
end dealings with "drug-running Pan
amanian dictators." Bush has also
been thrown on the defensive recently
by reports that he was told of Nori
ega's drug activities several years ago,
which he has denied.
Bush's remark, in an address at the
Los Angeles Police Academy, comes at
a time when campaign advisers have
been appealing to him with some ur
gency to define how his administration
would differ from Reagan's. With polls
showing Bush slipping far behind Du

kakis, the advisers have said Bush
needs to move sooner to outline his
views, rather than wait until the Au
gust party convention, as Bush has
said he would like to do.
Bush did not mention Noriega by
name in the speech. But he said, "Drug
dealers are domestic terrorists, killings
kids and cops, and they should be
treated as such. I won't bargain with
terrorists, and I won't bargain with
drug dealers either, whether they're
on U.S. or foreign soil."
Asked if he was referring to Noriega,
press representative Peter Teeley
quoted Bush as saying, "That is the
way I would deal with drug dealers as
president." In the delicate political ef
forts to separate Bush from Reagan,
the vice president's advisers say he is
intent on not criticizing the president,
preferring to state how he would han
dle issues and allowing others to judge
whether his statements amount to dif
ferences.
In more than seven years as vice
president, Bush has rarely if ever dif
fered with Reagan publicly on a
foreign-policy matter. In recent days,
he has hinted of dissatisfaction with
the Noriega plea bargaining, saying he
would like to see the Panamanian
"brought to justice," but refusing to
elaborate.
Bush advisers have said one way

Bush intends to present himself in
more detail to voters is by stressing
the anti-drug issue, which many public
opinion surveys show is the top do
mestic concern of Americans. The polls
also show that the public believes the
Reagan administration has not done

enough to fight drugs.
"We haven't obviously had success
in solving this problem. Today's speech
goes broader than just talking about
the interdiction effort," said chief of
staff Craig Fuller.
