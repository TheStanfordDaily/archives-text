# Jackson meets with Jewish community leaders

### 
LOS ANGELES — Trying to patch
up his relations with Jews, the Rev.
Jesse Jackson spent more than an
hour yesterday engaged in tough talk
over breakfast with almost 50 Jewish
community leaders who came away
pleased at the gesture but sounding
unsure about the man.
Jackson supporters did not expect
to win many votes at the closed-door
session, which by most accounts was
calm and courteous but spiced with
frank comments about relations be
tween blacks and Jews. But they did
hope to begin fashioning a peace be
tween Jackson and Jews.
"He didn't change any minds, but
I believe he continued to open up some
minds," said Rabbi Allen Freehling of
University Synagogue, who organized
the meeting, at a press briefing after

ward with Jackson and other rabbis
at his side.
For some, it was enough that Jack
son was willing to sit down and listen
to the Jewish complaints about Jack
son's record, including his relationship
with Nation of Islam leader Louis Far
rakhan, his visit with Palestine Lib
eration Organization leader Yasser
Arafat and his reference to New York
during the 1984 presidential campaign
as "Hymietown."
"By and large I think the crowd was
impressed," said Donna Bojarsky, a
young leader in the Westside Jewish
community and a Democratic Party
activist. "I don't think everyone was
completely mollified, but the impor
tant thing is we are talking."
However, demonstrators from the

fringe Jewish Defense League
protested outside the Hollywood
Roosevelt Hotel, where the meeting
took place. They also disrupted the
press briefing given by Jackson and
the Jewish leaders by banging on win
dows of the hotel bar where the brief
ing was held.
On the Farrakhan issue, Jackson
told the leaders that he had repeatedly
repudiated Farrakhan, and told them
that he had to handle things his way.
"You have to give me trust," Jackson
reportedly said. "Our communities
handle things differently. We cannot
impose our communities' solutions on
each other."
Jackson's weakest response, Jack
son supporters and skeptics agreed,
was his explanation of the

"Hymietown" remark.
He apologized for the remark but
said he still didn't think use of the
term "hymie" was derogatory.
Many prominent Jewish leaders in
Los Angeles declined Freehling's invi
tation to attend the meeting, including
Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center. David Lehrer,
regional director of the Anti-
Defamation League of B'nai B'rith,
said that Jackson's insistence that the
meeting be closed to the press and
public was unacceptable.
Jackson had declined a similar meet
ing with Jewish leaders in New York
prior to the New York primary. He
said yesterday that he did so because
the atmosphere there was too racially
charged.
