# Reagan joins calls for new ideas, tactics in drug war

### 
NEW LONDON, Conn. — President
Reagan, scrambling to wrest the politically
sensitive drug issue from Congress, called
yesterday for a bipartisan executive
legislative task force to propose within 45
days new ways to fight illegal drugs.
Reagan urged that the task force consider
gTeater use of the U.S. military and Na
tional Guard, new education and preven
tion programs and tougher penalties
against drug operatives, including capital
punishment for "kingpins" and "cop kil
lers."
"It is time to make illegal drugs public
enemy No. 1," the president declared to
loud applause in a commencement speech
at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
Reagan's call for new ideas to combat
illicit narcotics came amid a surge in
Congress to pass measures addressing com
plaints by voters who, according to opinion
polls, are increasingly concerned about the
effectiveness of the government's drug
fight.
So hastily was Reagan's proposal put
together that his own National Drug En

forcement Coordinating Group did not
know about it until he had included it in
his speech at the Coast Guard Academy.
Although Reagan pleaded that "excessive
drug politics" be removed from election
year debates, his call for an executive
legislative task force report by July 2 was
an obvious counter to the Democrats'
plans.
The president made clear that he
strongly backs imposing capital punish
ment in drug-related murders. An attempt
by Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., to at
tach the proposal to a defense authorization
bill has prompted Senate liberals to
threaten a filibuster against the measure.
Reagan said emphatically that his policy
of "zero tolerance" of illegal drug use
means "no exceptions." The remark came
at a time when sources say that Reagan
has offered to drop drug-trafficking charges
against Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega
as an inducement for him to relinquish
power.
