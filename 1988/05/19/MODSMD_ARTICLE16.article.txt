## Noriega charges were unwise 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Department of
Justice's extraordinary and politically
sensitive decision to seek criminal drug
trafficking indictments against Panama
nian Gen. Manuel Noriega was not well
thought out and was never submitted to
President Reagan or chief of staff Howard
Baker Jr. for their approval, administration
officials said yesterday.
The indictments have become a stum
bling block to U.S. efforts to oust Noriega,
who remains out of the reach of U.S. law
as long as he remains in Panama. And the
administration's willingness now to drop
the indictments as part of a deal to force
him out of power has made it possible for
Democrats to charge the Reagan adminis
tration with being soft on drug dealers.
Faced with this dilemma and receiving
criticism from all sides, the administration
officials say that a more thorough analysis
of how to proceed against Noriega might
have prevented the predicament.
Department of Justice officials consulted
with officials of the State and Defense de
partments and the White House National
Security Council staff before the indict
ments were returned in February, but nei
ther Reagan nor Baker signed off on the
action, a senior administration official said.
Attorney General Edwin Meese 111 ap
proved the indictment after being briefed
on the evidence by Leon Kellner, the U.S.
attorney in Miami, and former Assistant
Attorney General William Weld, who
headed Justice's Criminal Division, sources
said.
Even though it raised a sensitive foreign

affairs issue, Meese apparently was the
only Cabinet-level official to approve in
dicting Noriega. Although Lt. Gen. Colin
Powell, Reagan's assistant for national se
curity, is generally consulted on foreign
affairs matters, the issue of the Noriega
indictments was not submitted for his ap
proval, according to administration
sources.
Powell declined to comment on the mat
ter, saying, "I just can't go into details on
any of this. It's just too sensitive." Meese,
through a press representative declined to
comment on whether he raised the issue
with the president.
Although Baker has publicly defended
the indictments as a tool for destabilizing
Noriega, he is known to be deeply disturbed
that such a crucial decision involving the
leader of a foreign country and a potentially
explosive political issue was made without
more thorough discussion at the presiden
tial level and specific approval by the pres
ident.
A State Department official familiar with
discussions that led up to an administration
go-ahead on the indictments said officials
never thought through all the possible
repercussions, including implications on
foreign policy "and the consequences it
would mean for a friendly foreign country."
Since Noriega refused to step down in
the face of the criminal charges, the United
States has imposed economic sanctions on
the country that have damaged its eco
nomy, forced bank closings and kept many
Panamanians from receiving paychecks.
