# Meese discusses possible resignation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Attorney
General Edwin Meese 111 held
a "candid and frank discus
sion" yesterday with a group
of conservative Republican
senators on the possibility of
his resignation but gave no in
dication that he will step down,
participants said.
None of the seven senators
attending the luncheon meet
ing on Capitol Hill urged Meese
to resign in the session, which
all sources described as "very
friendly." However, one partic
ipant said that the attorney
general was told that he must
consider whether he is damag
ing President Reagan, the Re
publican Party and himself by
remaining.
Reagan continued to defend
his embattled attorney general,
saying that the accusations
against Meese are "all empty
charges. " Nevertheless, the dis
cussion of Meese's possible
departure, which the attorney
general and the senators raised
mutually, indicates continued
concern over the his legal prob
lems despite Reagan's frequent
expressions of support.

Such concern was even
voiced aboard the same plane
that took Reagan on a trip to
Connecticut yesterday. Sen.
Lowell Weicker Jr., R-Conn.,
flying with Reagan on Air
Force One to attend graduation
ceremonies at the Coast Guard
Academy in New London, said:
"I've been battling the son of
a bitch ever since he became
attorney general. I don't like
him."
But Weicker, a longtime
critic of Meese, added that he
would not decide whether to
call for his resignation until an
investigation of the attorney
general by independent counsel
James McKay is completed,
probably late this month.
When asked about the
resignations of Deputy Attor
ney General Arnold Burns and
Assistant Attorney General
William Weld, head of the de
partment's criminal division,
Meese "also reminded them
that they are only two out of
260 to 270 top employees,"
Thurmond's press representa
tive said.
