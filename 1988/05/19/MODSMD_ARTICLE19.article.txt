THE RISING TIDE of frus
tration over this country's
inability to improve its
troubled educational system has fi
nally spurred a response.
Turning frustration into action,
students here and around the state
authored the "Education Bill of
Rights," which they unveiled last
weekend at an educational confer
ence at Stanford.
The bill seeks to improve
teacher's salaries and working con
ditions, to increase financial aid to
underprivileged students, to in
clude study of ethnic minority his
toy and culture, and to redirect
funds from defense to education.
The bill makes positive recom
mendations, but two of its 11 de
mands are misguided.
The bill's authors are wrong to
argue that the way to equalize op
portunity in schools is to equalize
funding among schools. While
equal opportunity should be a pil
lar of our educational system, it is
unrealistic and unworkable to
equalize funding and resources
among schools.
For example, inner-city schools
and schools in rural areas have
very different needs and demand
unequal funding to address their
special needs.
Furthermore, the bill directly
contradicts itself because it also
demands increased commitment to
student services in the form of
family counseling, drug and alcohol
abuse programs, ethnic-student
programs and educational oppor

tunity programs.
While drug and alcohol abuse
programs may be essential in one
district, they may not be needed
in another district.
The second misguided demand,
which calls on the nation to reaf
firm its commitment to bilingual
and bicultural education, is largely
unrealistic.
Granted, more resources must
be devoted to improving the edu
cation of students who do not
speak English. But the bill is
wrong to assert that "bilingual ed
ucation is a proven method to en
sure the development of English
skills while retaining one's own
language." That has never been
proven.
In fact, the teachers' union of
the Los Angeles Unified School
District, one of the testing grounds
for early bilingual education pro
grams, recently decided that bilin
gual education is not the best way
to educate students who do not
speak English as a first language.
The architects of the bill need
to rethink these demands.
Yet the bill contains nine other
demands that could help revive ed
ucation in the Unites States.
Activists have already recorded
terrific success in drawing together
students from all over the state in
support of the bill. If they can
carry this momentum onto the na
tional level, the bill has the poten
tial to create meaningful change.
Now is the time to give it the
push it needs.
