## But several Hoover fellows are angry with the move

Three members of the Hoover
Institution Board of Overseers
publicly expressed their support
yesterday for last week's decision
by the University Board of Trus
tees to call for the retirement of
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell.
John Ditz, Rudolph Munzer
and Frank Tatum, all former

Senior Research Fellow George
Marotta said he was "quite

Senior Research Fellow Angelo
Codevilla said he was surprised
by the retirement, but added that
the decision was "certainly not
out of character."
"The hostility of Stanford lead

Senior Fellow Bruce Bueno De

Stanford had been interested in
retiring Campbell.
Bueno De Mesquita said Camp

bell's efforts to make Hoover the
top think tank in the country have
gone unnoticed. "Glenn has done
an extraordinary job â€” which is
widely unappreciated at Stan

Senior Fellow John Dunlop said
he, too, was surprised, but added
