# Three Hoover overseers back Campbell's ouster
## But several Hoover fellows are angry with the move 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Three members of the Hoover
Institution Board of Overseers
publicly expressed their support
yesterday for last week's decision
by the University Board of Trus
tees to call for the retirement of
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell.
John Ditz, Rudolph Munzer
and Frank Tatum, all former
Stanford trustees, issued separate
public statements yesterday en
dorsing the trustees' decision to
replace the director next year
when he turns 65.
According to Tatum, the trus
tees' decision "is consistent with
the 1959 (trustee) resolution
which established the retirement
age at 65 and with the practice
among senior administrators at
Stanford."
Several senior Hoover fellows,
however, have expressed surpise
and regret at the call for Camp
bell's retirement.
Senior Research Fellow George
Marotta said he was "quite
shocked" and that he had not ex
pected the trustees' decision.
Senior Research Fellow Angelo
Codevilla said he was surprised
by the retirement, but added that
the decision was "certainly not
out of character."
"The hostility of Stanford lead

ership toward the Hoover Insti
tution is not news," he said. "One
is always wondering what form
that hostility is taking."
Senior Fellow Bruce Bueno De
Mesquita said he was surprised
but said knew that in the past
Stanford had been interested in
retiring Campbell.
Bueno De Mesquita said Camp

bell's efforts to make Hoover the
top think tank in the country have
gone unnoticed. "Glenn has done
an extraordinary job â€” which is
widely unappreciated at Stan
ford," he said.
Senior Fellow John Dunlop said
he, too, was surprised, but added
that he did not know enough
details of the decision to comment
further.
Although more than 15 Hoover
Fellows refused to comment last
night about the trustee's decision,
those who did respond said they
thought Campbell had the sup
port of all of the scholars at
Hoover.
"I think everyone at Hoover is
behind him," Marotta said. "We
do not understand why the direc
tor has to be retired early. He is
doing a good job; he is in good
shape; he has the support of the
scholars."
Codevilla agreed: "I do not
know of anyone (at Hoover) who

would not support him," he said.
"If you took a poll of who would
replace Glenn Campbell, you
would probably find it would be
Glenn Campbell."
Marotta expressed hope that
the replacement will be of the
same caliber as Campbell.
In January, the 63 Hoover
scholars signed a letter to the
trustees and the Hoover Board of
Overseers voicing support of
Campbell and stressing the hope
that he would "continue as direc
tor for many years to come."
The scholars' letter was drafted
to express concern by members
of the group that Campbell is paid
a relatively low salary compared
to other political research insti
tution directors.
"In light of Dr. Campbell's
achievements," the scholars

wrote, "we urge Stanford and the
boards (of Stanford and Hoover)
to do everything necessary, finan
cial or otherwise, to ensure that
Dr. Campbell remain director of
the Hoover Institution."
