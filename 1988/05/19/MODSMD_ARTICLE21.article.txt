## Jackson isn't a symbol 
### 
CAN JESSE Jackson win the Dem
ocratic nomination? Can the Amer
ican nation, a stronghold of
equality and diversity, accept a black
leader? Most people at Stanford would
say yes. But at this stage of the game
talk is cheap, and behind much of the
idealism and positive talk there is a dis
appointing sentiment that Jackson's cam
paign can only be symbolic, never a
reality.
At the start of campaigning, Jackson
was highly favored for his enthusiasm.
But as Jackson appeared to be a serious
candidate, his popularity fell substan
tially in national polls.
It is as though a nation of open-minded
people are shaking their heads "yes" to
change and progress but "no" to change
and progress right now. "Jackson is a
powerful and moving speaker" becomes
replaced with "Jackson is a rabble
rousing preacher." "Jackson is sensitive
to the needs of many underrepresented
groups" becomes "Jackson only deals
with black issues." "Jackson would
generate change and a better quality of
life" becomes "Jackson lacks experience."
In the end, change and progress be
come a dream deferred, and people
deceive themselves into believing that
their biases are grounded in truth. Many
concerns about Jackson's ability are valid
worries: Jackson is politically inexperi
enced, he is more concerned with national
problems than international ones, and
he is especially sensitive to minority con
cerns. But are these things to worry
about?
Reagan's years of political experience
have added little to the depth of the

administration; his tip-toeing through
the gardens of international exchange has
led more often than not to the alienation
of other nations. His insensitivity to ed
ucation, minorities and natural resource
preservation has put us in a far deeper
hole than the Carter administration ever
did, and his forgetfulness and reliance
on the whims of the stars have caused
the American people to lose faith in the
morality and honesty of government.
Jackson may or may not be the best
solution to the problems of this admin
istration. It's anyone's guess how well a
person will fare in a new and difficult
role. But if the past and present are any
indication, Jackson is an energized
leader, capable of surrounding himself
with an intelligent and experienced staff.
He is a viable candidate, deserving more
than our empathy — he deserves our
serious consideration.
Why then have almost none of the
Democratic party's white leaders even
considered endorsing Jackson? Why is
there such a reluctance to acknowledge
Jackson's merit and give him a chance?
Many people believe that Americans
aren't ready for a black president. They
believe that a great many more attitudes
must change before we will ever be ready
for such a change.
History and social psychology, how
ever, disagree with the notion that atti
tudes must change before behaviors can
change. In 1954, when the Supreme
Court declared that separate schools were
by definition unequal, many people were
opposed to immediate integration of
schools, saying that laws could not legis

late morality, that attitudes had to
change first. If we had waited then for
attitudes to change, we would still be
waiting now to integrate our schools.
Social psychologists believe that equal
status contact is the fastest way to
achieve change. Putting people in situa
tions of equality allows them to base
their evaluations on direct experience,
not stereotypes. This eventually leads to
acceptance and better understanding.
The same is true of the "psychology
of inevitability." When we believe that
something is inevitable, we are quicker
to accept it and adapt to it. When the
National Guard backed the integration
of schools, change seemed inevitable, and
students made the best of the situation
by eventually accepting integration
rather than fighting it.
With all of this in mind, the argument
that people aren't ready for Jackson or
a black president seems less valid. If we
classify Jackson as simply another cor
nerstone on the road to equality, as some
one setting an example for the distant
future, then we are once again refusing
the challenge of change — deferring the
dream rather than awakening to it.
