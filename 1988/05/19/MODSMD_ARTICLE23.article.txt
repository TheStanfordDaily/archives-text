# George Segal statue will be reinstalled
## 
### 
Contrary to articles, letters and a
May 6 editorial of The Daily, there has
been no intended deception with
respect to the status of George Segal's
"Gay Liberation" statue.
I was responsible for having the
work removed after it was vandalized
in August. Before leaving Stanford last
September to become director of the
Stanford program in Paris, I made
arrangements for the complete
repatination of the sculptures which
had suffered discoloration, chipping of
the lacquer patina, as well as spray
painting by a vandal. We had planned
, reinstallation for this spring.
* I had assumed during my seven
month absence from the campus that
the work had been done. I had also
been informed while in Paris that the

University would have to dig up the
site where "Gay Liberation" was lo
cated, and it was my decision not to
reinstall it until that work was
finished. The bronze figures must be
bolted to the benches and concrete
pad. When removed, the bolts are cut,
and it is a difficult job removing and
replacing them in a process that is
stressful for the sculpture.
When first queried by The Daily
during a dinner-time phone call, I had
been under the impression the sculp
ture, which I had not seen since my
return, had been restored. The delay
in restoration is due to postponement
of reinstallation and the heavy burden
of other work borne by the one person
who can do the restoration.
Even if the sculpture had been res
tored, to avoid unnecessary strain on
it, we would not have reinstalled it for
the few weeks before work on Lomita
Mall will begin. Our concern is for the
statue's longevity.
This past Tuesday I talked to George

Segal, who did not know about the
reason for the delay or that we had
neither a strong suspect nor good case
against the persons who vandalized the
sculpture some years ago and last
summer. I reminded him that when we
reinstalled his sculpture following its
vandalism in 1984, it was because this
university takes the view that vandals
will not dictate our policy on public
art. I don't think you will find that
Segal considers us now to have been
negligent.
Coincidentally, and as a friend, he
had just written to me of the recent
tragic accidental death of Peter Put
nam, who had established the Mildred
Andrews Fund from which I obtained
"Gay Liberation" for Stanford in 1984.
Putnam had wanted the sculpture to
go to a West Coast city where gays
had historically fought for their civil
rights. Failing to find such a willing
recipient, he was agreeable to my argu
ment that as a community having a
gay population as well as being a

teaching institution, Stanford would be
appropriate.
I had talked to Putnam by phone
last August, explaining to his satisfac
tion our plans for the restoration and
determination to have the sculpture on
permanent display in the setting he
had approved.
Contrary to concerns expressed in
The Daily about our succumbing to
outside negative pressures to withhold
the Segal from public display, the Uni
versity's commitment to the most am
bitious campuswide sculpture program
in the country continues.
In addition to reinstalling Segal's
sculpture — and assuming that all the
appropriate committees concur — this
summer a world-famous sculpture will
also be installed permanently in front
of Meyer Library where Rodin's
"Monument to Balzac" had stood while
on loan from the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art.
