## Plant research blooms at idyllic Jasper Ridge 
### Eric Ly Staff writer 
Checkerspot butterflies flutter
over a carpet of violet, yellow and
white knee-high wildflowers that
runs along the trail. Just 50 yards
away to the left and right, a dense
sheet of emerald-green grass
covers the ground.
Only a 20-minute walk from
campus, this scene is an ideal lab
oratory for a naturalist, and it is
all part of Stanford's Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, a 1,200-acre
natural laboratory in the Foothills
west of campus.

Formally desginated a research
preserve in 1973, Jasper Ridge is
one of the last naturally vegetated
open spaces in the heavily ur
banized mid-Peninsula. Although
it also plays host to approximately
5,000 nature lovers each year, the
preserve is a "humongous labora
tory" for biological and ecological
research, said senior Steve Schloz

man, a docent at the ridge major
ing in biology and English.
For many scientists, Jasper
Ridge provides an opportunity to
conduct research in such diverse
fields'as archaeology, zoology, ge
ology, plant and animal evolution,
ecology, plant physiology and
plant communities.
The preserve's proximity to
campus, its variety of plant com
munities and the experiments
conducted there make Jasper
Ridge unique among American
university campuses, said Admin
istrative Director Alan Grund
man.
"Jasper Ridge is wonderful for
me," said graduate student Barb
Gartner, who is using Jasper
Ridge to study the poison oak
plant. "I can set up experiments
there and no one will disturb
them," she said.
"I can observe the plants year
round because [Jasper Ridgel is
so close to home." Gartner said.
The Ridge's diversity
The Ridge has all five of the
main ecosystems found in central
California, said Biology Prof.
Harold Mooney. "The soil types
were put down there as if they
were designed for experiments,"
he said. "You step over a line and
you've gone from one world to
another, biologically speaking."
One of the these worlds has
made Jasper Ridge home to a
spectacular collection of Califor
nia wildflowers. These wild
flowers grow on serpentine rock

— a long outcrop across the Ridge
that produces calcium-deficient
soils useful only to those plants
whose evolution over thousands
of years has made them especially
suited to take advantage of the
soil, Schlozman said.
These strikingly colorful
flowers normally bloom beginning
in mid-March to April and stay
that way for about a month.
"They adopt dramatic strategies
to attract insects in order to pol
lenate," Scholzman said.
It was also on this serpentine
soil that Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich and his associates have
conducted famous research on
checkerspot butterfly populations.
Ehrlich, who has been working
with Jasper Ridge butterflies
since 1960, has made important
progress in identifying the causes
of fluctuation in population size
in herbivorous insects, and the
nature of their interaction with
food plants.
Ehrlich's results are significant
not only to the theory of popula
tion biology, but also to such ap
plied problems as the control of
insect pests. Ehrlich's work is now
considered a model for long-term
ecological research. As a result of
Ehrlich's research, checkerspot
butterflies are now perhaps the
best known natural populations
of any group of non-humans or
ganism, Grundman said.
Ehrlich also played a funda
mental role in making Jasper
Ridge a place for academic re
