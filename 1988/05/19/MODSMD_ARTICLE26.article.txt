## Plant research blooms at idyllic Jasper Ridge 
### Eric Ly Staff writer 
Checkerspot butterflies flutter
over a carpet of violet, yellow and
white knee-high wildflowers that
runs along the trail. Just 50 yards
away to the left and right, a dense
sheet of emerald-green grass
covers the ground.
Only a 20-minute walk from
campus, this scene is an ideal lab
oratory for a naturalist, and it is
all part of Stanford's Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, a 1,200-acre
natural laboratory in the Foothills
west of campus.

Formally desginated a research
preserve in 1973, Jasper Ridge is
one of the last naturally vegetated
open spaces in the heavily ur
banized mid-Peninsula. Although
it also plays host to approximately
5,000 nature lovers each year, the
preserve is a "humongous labora
tory" for biological and ecological
research, said senior Steve Schloz

man, a docent at the ridge major
ing in biology and English.
For many scientists, Jasper
Ridge provides an opportunity to
conduct research in such diverse
fields'as archaeology, zoology, ge
ology, plant and animal evolution,
ecology, plant physiology and
plant communities.
The preserve's proximity to
campus, its variety of plant com
munities and the experiments
conducted there make Jasper
Ridge unique among American
university campuses, said Admin
istrative Director Alan Grund
man.
"Jasper Ridge is wonderful for
me," said graduate student Barb
Gartner, who is using Jasper
Ridge to study the poison oak
plant. "I can set up experiments
there and no one will disturb
them," she said.
"I can observe the plants year
round because [Jasper Ridgel is
so close to home." Gartner said.
The Ridge's diversity
The Ridge has all five of the
main ecosystems found in central
California, said Biology Prof.
Harold Mooney. "The soil types
were put down there as if they
were designed for experiments,"
he said. "You step over a line and
you've gone from one world to
another, biologically speaking."
One of the these worlds has
made Jasper Ridge home to a
spectacular collection of Califor
nia wildflowers. These wild
flowers grow on serpentine rock

— a long outcrop across the Ridge
that produces calcium-deficient
soils useful only to those plants
whose evolution over thousands
of years has made them especially
suited to take advantage of the
soil, Schlozman said.
These strikingly colorful
flowers normally bloom beginning
in mid-March to April and stay
that way for about a month.
"They adopt dramatic strategies
to attract insects in order to pol
lenate," Scholzman said.
It was also on this serpentine
soil that Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich and his associates have
conducted famous research on
checkerspot butterfly populations.
Ehrlich, who has been working
with Jasper Ridge butterflies
since 1960, has made important
progress in identifying the causes
of fluctuation in population size
in herbivorous insects, and the
nature of their interaction with
food plants.
Ehrlich's results are significant
not only to the theory of popula
tion biology, but also to such ap
plied problems as the control of
insect pests. Ehrlich's work is now
considered a model for long-term
ecological research. As a result of
Ehrlich's research, checkerspot
butterflies are now perhaps the
best known natural populations
of any group of non-humans or
ganism, Grundman said.
Ehrlich also played a funda
mental role in making Jasper
Ridge a place for academic re

search. Until the Ridge was for
mally made a preserve, it was
popular as a public park. Van
dalism, abuse and even unwanted
plant invasions had begun to
endanger not only academic ex
periments but also some natural
features. Pressure from several
environmental groups finally
forced the closing of Jasper Ridge
as a public park in 1975.
Although Ehrlich still conducts
butterfly research at the Ridge,
he has recently taken an interest
in the study of the bird population
at the preserve. He has co
authored a guide to the natural
history of North American birds,
"The Birder's Handbook."
Research on the edge
With Ehrlich's help, graduate
student Tom Sisk plans to begin
studying birds that live on the
the boundary of two different
habitats.
Sisk said he believes "this re
search will address issues of in
terest to both ecologists and con
servationists." Although his re
search has just begun, Sisk said
it may ultimately yeild an under
standing of these boundary
habitats, as well as of ways
preserving bird populations near
industrial cities, where extinction
of local birds and animals is a
recurrent concern of conser
vationists.
Sisk said he wants to address
three questions in his research:
• How does bird community struc
ture change from a oak woodland
habitat to a chaparral habitat?
• Is the bordering community a
unique blending of bird species or
a combination of the adjacent
communities?
• How does this edge community
differ from other edge habitats?
"The success of efforts to
preserve biological diversity over
the next century will depend on
the ability of conservationists to
provide the best possible habitats
from the limited land resrouces
given to their care," Sisk said.
In such situations, Sisk said,
information concerning bird com
munity dynamics at Jasper Ridge
may prove critical in preventing
the wholesale loss of native
species in threatened habitats.

Poison oak research
Gartner has been studying the
storage, movement and use of
water in stems of different forms
of poison oak at Jasper Kidge.
Poison oak is an abundant na
tive plant that grows as a shrub
and a vine. Through her research,
Gartner said, she hopes to better
understand evolutionary ques
tions of nature's tolerance of un
usual characteristics in or
ganisms. "Mother nature is not
as perfect as it seems," she said.
"There are plants with leaves
which shade themselves and don't
receive the maximum amount of
sunlight available," Gartner said.
Because poison oak is the same
species in both its shrub and vine
form, Gartner's study avoids
many of the problems normally
encountered in comparing two dif
ferent plants with distinct evolu
tionary pasts, Gartner said.
"Much research in wood anatomy
just describes the different ways
plants grow, but the functional
consequences of these differences
have not been studied," she said.
For Gartner, studying poison
oak is a useful way to investigate
the importance of the shape in
which a plant grows and the way
it functions. Specifically, Gartner
said she hopes to learn whether
viney or shrubby poison oak
plants produce wood with differ
ent water conducting properties.
This information, she said, may
in turn help answer the important
question of whether physical form
necessarily controls the way
plants function.
Gartner, who is not immune to
poison oak and must wear pro
tective gloves, said the plant has
not been studied because of its
"alergenic" reputation. "It's a lot
easier to work with than you
would think," she said. "Poison
oak was not designed to be
avoided. The plant is a wonderful
model to study, and it just so
happens that it causes skin
rashes," noted Mooney.
An important goal of ecology is
the ability to predict characteris
tics of one species based on an
understanding of other species,
Gartner said.

istrative Director Alan Grund
man.
"Jasper Ridge is wonderful for
me," said graduate student Barb
Gartner, who is using Jasper
Ridge to study the poison oak
plant. "I can set up experiments
there and no one will disturb
them," she said.
"I can observe the plants year
round because [Jasper Ridgel is
so close to home." Gartner said.
The Ridge's diversity
The Ridge has all five of the
main ecosystems found in central
California, said Biology Prof.
Harold Mooney. "The soil types
were put down there as if they
were designed for experiments,"
he said. "You step over a line and
you've gone from one world to
another, biologically speaking."
One of the these worlds has
made Jasper Ridge home to a
spectacular collection of Califor
nia wildflowers. These wild
flowers grow on serpentine rock

— a long outcrop across the Ridge
that produces calcium-deficient
soils useful only to those plants
whose evolution over thousands
of years has made them especially
suited to take advantage of the
soil, Schlozman said.
These strikingly colorful
flowers normally bloom beginning
in mid-March to April and stay
that way for about a month.
"They adopt dramatic strategies
to attract insects in order to pol
lenate," Scholzman said.
It was also on this serpentine
soil that Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich and his associates have
conducted famous research on
checkerspot butterfly populations.
Ehrlich, who has been working
with Jasper Ridge butterflies
since 1960, has made important
progress in identifying the causes
of fluctuation in population size
in herbivorous insects, and the
nature of their interaction with
food plants.
Ehrlich's results are significant
not only to the theory of popula
tion biology, but also to such ap
plied problems as the control of
insect pests. Ehrlich's work is now
considered a model for long-term
ecological research. As a result of
Ehrlich's research, checkerspot
butterflies are now perhaps the
best known natural populations
of any group of non-humans or
ganism, Grundman said.
Ehrlich also played a funda
mental role in making Jasper
Ridge a place for academic re

search. Until the Ridge was for
mally made a preserve, it was
popular as a public park. Van
dalism, abuse and even unwanted
plant invasions had begun to
endanger not only academic ex
periments but also some natural
features. Pressure from several
environmental groups finally
forced the closing of Jasper Ridge
as a public park in 1975.
Although Ehrlich still conducts
butterfly research at the Ridge,
he has recently taken an interest
in the study of the bird population
at the preserve. He has co
authored a guide to the natural
history of North American birds,
"The Birder's Handbook."
Research on the edge
With Ehrlich's help, graduate
student Tom Sisk plans to begin
studying birds that live on the
the boundary of two different
habitats.
Sisk said he believes "this re
search will address issues of in
terest to both ecologists and con
servationists." Although his re
search has just begun, Sisk said
it may ultimately yeild an under
standing of these boundary
habitats, as well as of ways
preserving bird populations near
industrial cities, where extinction
of local birds and animals is a
recurrent concern of conser
vationists.
Sisk said he wants to address
three questions in his research:
• How does bird community struc
ture change from a oak woodland
habitat to a chaparral habitat?
• Is the bordering community a
unique blending of bird species or
a combination of the adjacent
communities?
• How does this edge community
differ from other edge habitats?
"The success of efforts to
preserve biological diversity over
the next century will depend on
the ability of conservationists to
provide the best possible habitats
from the limited land resrouces
given to their care," Sisk said.
In such situations, Sisk said,
information concerning bird com
munity dynamics at Jasper Ridge
may prove critical in preventing
the wholesale loss of native
species in threatened habitats.

Poison oak research
Gartner has been studying the
storage, movement and use of
water in stems of different forms
of poison oak at Jasper Kidge.
Poison oak is an abundant na
tive plant that grows as a shrub
and a vine. Through her research,
Gartner said, she hopes to better
understand evolutionary ques
tions of nature's tolerance of un
usual characteristics in or
ganisms. "Mother nature is not
as perfect as it seems," she said.
"There are plants with leaves
which shade themselves and don't
receive the maximum amount of
sunlight available," Gartner said.
Because poison oak is the same
species in both its shrub and vine
form, Gartner's study avoids
many of the problems normally
encountered in comparing two dif
ferent plants with distinct evolu
tionary pasts, Gartner said.
"Much research in wood anatomy
just describes the different ways
plants grow, but the functional
consequences of these differences
have not been studied," she said.
For Gartner, studying poison
oak is a useful way to investigate
the importance of the shape in
which a plant grows and the way
it functions. Specifically, Gartner
said she hopes to learn whether
viney or shrubby poison oak
plants produce wood with differ
ent water conducting properties.
This information, she said, may
in turn help answer the important
question of whether physical form
necessarily controls the way
plants function.
Gartner, who is not immune to
poison oak and must wear pro
tective gloves, said the plant has
not been studied because of its
"alergenic" reputation. "It's a lot
easier to work with than you
would think," she said. "Poison
oak was not designed to be
avoided. The plant is a wonderful
model to study, and it just so
happens that it causes skin
rashes," noted Mooney.
An important goal of ecology is
the ability to predict characteris
tics of one species based on an
understanding of other species,
Gartner said.

Only a 20-minute walk from

Biological Preserve, a 1,200-acre
natural laboratory in the Foothills

Formally desginated a research
preserve in 1973, Jasper Ridge is
one of the last naturally vegetated
open spaces in the heavily ur
banized mid-Peninsula. Although
it also plays host to approximately
5,000 nature lovers each year, the
preserve is a "humongous labora
tory" for biological and ecological
research, said senior Steve Schloz

man, a docent at the ridge major
ing in biology and English.
For many scientists, Jasper
Ridge provides an opportunity to
conduct research in such diverse
fields'as archaeology, zoology, ge

ecology, plant physiology and
plant communities.
