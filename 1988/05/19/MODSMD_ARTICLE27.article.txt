# 'Youngsters' make New Waves on campus

Perched atop a large speaker
with a fire alarm blaring in the
background, sophomore Wren
Wescoatt, lead singer for The
Youngsters, declares the party a
success. The Okada party,
crowded and lively up to the very
end, testifies to the growing
popularity of this campus band.
When The Youngsters got to
gether in their present form last
fall, they wanted to play to a
different market than the typical
campus "party band," explains
keyboardist Sean Varah, a soph
omore. To accomplish this, The
Youngsters have foresaken some
of the more common party songs
— sophomore drummer Jeff
Carpenter calls them "old,
waahed-out party tunes" — in
favor of newer, popular num
bers. As an early Youngster flyer
made clear, the group does not
play "Louie-Louie," a rule Wes
coatt calls "a central Youngster
philosophy."
When The Youngsters origi
nally formed in February 1987
there were eight members, in
cluding three lead vocalists.
Over the summer, however, the
group shrank to four sopho
mores: Carpenter, Varah, Danny
Brown and Steve Rhody. The
addition of Wescoatt this fall
completed The Youngsters' pres
ent roster.
At present, the band's reper
toire includes some 50 songs, the
oldest of which dates back to
1978. Varah describes the
group's selections as "reggae
mostly British-post-1980-New
Wave type of music," which he
says require more musical talent
than most standard pop music.
"It's not that we don't play
popular music," Carpenter ex
plains. "We play INXS, The
Cure, The Smiths and English
Beat. What we try to play is
stuff that takes a little bit more
talent, that isn't .. . worn out."
Wescoatt complains that
sometimes the band's own mu
sical tastes play second fiddle to
those of its clientele. "Once in
a while we have to break down
and cater to the audience," he
says.
Above all else, the Youngsters

try to keep their audiences danc
ing. "We're not playing to be
seen," Varah says. "We want
people to party to us."
Wescoatt puts it even more
strongly: "Everything we do is
to make people dance. . . . We
play much better when people
are really into it."
"We don't like to play a party
where people don't like to
dance." Varah says. "When they
don't jump up and down a lot,
we jump up and down a lot."

'We're not playing to be seen. We want
people to party to us.'

"There is a direct correlation
between how much we enjoy
playing a gig and how much
other people have been dancing
and enjoying what we've been
doing," says Rhody, the band's

bassist.
The Youngsters' game plan is
to build a strong campus follow
ing and then expand to high
schools and other area colleges.
In Varah's estimation, the group
is making good progress. "It took
us longer than we wanted to,
but we finally got it moving win
ter quarter." So far, the band
has played at at East Palo Alto's
Club Afrique, as well as at two
local high school dances — one
in San Mateo, the other in Menlo

Park.
Later this month, the band
plans to perform at a high school
prom in Reno — its first out-of
state engagement. Eventually,
Varah says, The Youngsters

hope to expand their off-campus
forays to include other local col
leges, such as Foothill and San
Francisco State. "It's nice," he
adds, "We've got more than we
can handle."
Further down the road, the
band plans to finish making
demo tapes of some of their
original songs. They have al
ready recorded a few songs they
hope will get some airplay
through distribution to local
record companies and to KZSU
this summer.
"All the possibilities are
there," Varah says. "We'd like
to make it big, but we'll probably
end up (just) having a lot of fun."
"We'll ride this horse wher
ever it takes us," Wescoatt spec
ulates. Because all of the group's
members are sophomores, Varah
points out, "We'll be around for
a while."

The Youngsters pump out their "reggae-mostly British-post-1980-New Wave" music at the East
Side Carnival on Wilbur field last Sunday.
