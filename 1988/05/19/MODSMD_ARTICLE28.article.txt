There are many possible ap
proaches to writing a biography
of Sigmund Freud. The element
most of these approaches share
is a lack of comprehension.
Most people these days treat
Freud with a mixture of conde
scension and boredom, if not un
alloyed hostility. Yes, he is one of
two or three most influential
thinkers of the 20th century, but
that doesn't change the facts,
these people say. His focus on the
uncharted subconscious and on
complexes, syndromes and other
bugaboos over which we have no
control needlessly frightens
people — and gives them even
more complexes than they al
legedly had to begin with.
It seems that even "Freudians"
have something to fault in
Freud's theories, whether it be
the inadequacy of his tripartite
division of the mind, his seeming
obsession with Oedipality, or sim
ply his outdated view of the way
mental processes work.
After all, with a million happy
talking pop psych books weighing
down the nation's bookshelves,
what need is there to deal with
uncomfortable questions like the
existence of specters below the
threshold of consciousness? Or,
on the other hand, maybe it's bet
ter to trivialize the whole matter.
Get on the TV screen and pro
claim that 78 percent — yes, an
entire three-quarters — of the
mind is out of our perceptual
hands. Sell tapes with "subliminal
voices" on them that will help the
conscious percentage get in har
mony with the subconscious per
centage. That's the ticket.
If it's not one thing, it's an
other. Bruno Bettelheim says, in
essence, that Freud's theories are
incomprehensible because the
English language cannot ade

quately translate the true mean
ing of Freud's ideas. Another
writer proclaims, rather brashly
— and what's more, mendaciously
— that Freud was addicted to
cocaine the whole time he was
cooking up his notion of the sub
conscious and that the notion is
therefore a piece of chicanery.
Other writers say, variously,
that he had affairs with his sister-

in-law or desires for affairs with
a male colleague, using these ad
hominem appeals as a way of chip
ping at the borders of the psycho
analyst's credibility. Freud was
doctrinaire, insecure, inflexible,
moody, self-righteous, domineer
ing — in short, everything but
right.
All of which makes Peter Gay's
new biography a refreshing
change from the standard revi

sionist cant. Gay is a historian,
trained in the intricacies of psyc
hoanalysis, and thus brings a
leisurely expertise to his subject
matter that other biographers fre
quently lack. He knows how to
deal with the Austrian's life with
out falling off the fence either
into idolatry or cattiness — which
is not to say he is a fence
straddler.

He has none of the cold-fish
journalistic aspirations to "objec
tivity" that current biographers
seem to relish. It seems obvious
enough, but Gay simply gives
praise where praise is due, and
judges where it seems appropriate
to judge. Most biographers seem
uncomfortable striking that bal
ance, as if the equipoise of eval
uating their subjects' worth were
too much to demand.

Gay's style is that of any his
torian writing for the educated
market — somewhat reserved,
never flying into histrionics,
keeping an even keel, somewhat
the literary equivalent of George
Bush. This is not to disparage the
man's talent for turning a phrase;
his book is highly readable with
out being breezy. Again, it strikes
the balance.
Gay also weaves the details of
Freud's personal life with the dis
coveries which dominated that life
— without ever letting one get
the upper hand, in terms of cov
erage, over the other. This is ad
mirable, and again, almost mad
deningly balanced. One almost
wishes Gay would fly off the han
dle once in a while.
The architectonic features of
Gay's prose aside (you sometimes
feel as if, surrealistically, an
order-obsessed Intourist guide
has been transplanted from Mos
cow and is giving you the grand
tour of Freud's Viennese study),
this version of Freud's life is prob
ably the golden mean you're
looking for. It's not one of those
breathless, 100-page numbers
that gives you the quickie 15-
minute tour of the man's vital
stats and vital ideas. It's not
Ernest Jones' six-volume man
sion, either.
One of the most fortuitous
virtues of this book is the biblio
graphic essay it offers at the back.
If you want to delve into the
seething cauldron of controversy
over Freud's theories, or learn
more about his conflicts with
Jung, or find out everything you
ever wanted to know but were
afraid to ask about his wife (who
called her husband's life work "a
sort of pornography"), just con
sult the back of the book. Gay's
avoidance of the usual dry
endnote approach to biblio
graphies is both endearing and
absorbing.

Reviewed by Frank Lester
There are many possible ap
proaches to writing a biography
of Sigmund Freud. The element
most of these approaches share
is a lack of comprehension.
Most people these days treat
Freud with a mixture of conde
scension and boredom, if not un
alloyed hostility. Yes, he is one of
two or three most influential
thinkers of the 20th century, but
that doesn't change the facts,
these people say. His focus on the
uncharted subconscious and on
complexes, syndromes and other
bugaboos over which we have no
control needlessly frightens
people — and gives them even
more complexes than they al
legedly had to begin with.
It seems that even "Freudians"
have something to fault in
Freud's theories, whether it be
the inadequacy of his tripartite
division of the mind, his seeming
obsession with Oedipality, or sim
ply his outdated view of the way
mental processes work.
After all, with a million happy
talking pop psych books weighing
down the nation's bookshelves,
what need is there to deal with
uncomfortable questions like the
existence of specters below the
threshold of consciousness? Or,
on the other hand, maybe it's bet
ter to trivialize the whole matter.
Get on the TV screen and pro
claim that 78 percent — yes, an
entire three-quarters — of the
mind is out of our perceptual
hands. Sell tapes with "subliminal
voices" on them that will help the
conscious percentage get in har
mony with the subconscious per
centage. That's the ticket.
If it's not one thing, it's an
other. Bruno Bettelheim says, in
essence, that Freud's theories are
incomprehensible because the
English language cannot ade

quately translate the true mean
ing of Freud's ideas. Another
writer proclaims, rather brashly
— and what's more, mendaciously
— that Freud was addicted to
cocaine the whole time he was
cooking up his notion of the sub
conscious and that the notion is
therefore a piece of chicanery.
Other writers say, variously,
that he had affairs with his sister-

in-law or desires for affairs with
a male colleague, using these ad
hominem appeals as a way of chip
ping at the borders of the psycho
analyst's credibility. Freud was
doctrinaire, insecure, inflexible,
moody, self-righteous, domineer
ing — in short, everything but
right.
All of which makes Peter Gay's
new biography a refreshing
change from the standard revi

sionist cant. Gay is a historian,
trained in the intricacies of psyc
hoanalysis, and thus brings a
leisurely expertise to his subject
matter that other biographers fre
quently lack. He knows how to
deal with the Austrian's life with
out falling off the fence either
into idolatry or cattiness — which
is not to say he is a fence
straddler.

He has none of the cold-fish
journalistic aspirations to "objec
tivity" that current biographers
seem to relish. It seems obvious
enough, but Gay simply gives
praise where praise is due, and
judges where it seems appropriate
to judge. Most biographers seem
uncomfortable striking that bal
ance, as if the equipoise of eval
uating their subjects' worth were
too much to demand.

Gay's style is that of any his
torian writing for the educated
market — somewhat reserved,
never flying into histrionics,
keeping an even keel, somewhat
the literary equivalent of George
Bush. This is not to disparage the
man's talent for turning a phrase;
his book is highly readable with
out being breezy. Again, it strikes
the balance.
Gay also weaves the details of
Freud's personal life with the dis
coveries which dominated that life
— without ever letting one get
the upper hand, in terms of cov
erage, over the other. This is ad
mirable, and again, almost mad
deningly balanced. One almost

dle once in a while.
