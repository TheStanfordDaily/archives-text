"One evening, he had urinated in his parents'
bedroom, in their presence... . Exasperated, Jacob
Freud had told his son that he would never amount
to anything. The memory of this episode pursued the
young Freud for years. It had been 'a terrible blow to
my ambition,' and he continued to replay it in his
dreams.... Freud the psychoanalyst would later point
to the sexual curiosity of youngsters as the true
source of scientific inquisitiveness. It is a reasonable
speculation to see the episode in his parents'
bedroom as a straightforward, rather coarse expres
sion of such curiosity, later refined into research."
