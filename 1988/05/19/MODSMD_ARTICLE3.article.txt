# Threat will not deter search for new director

### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Depite Hoover Institute Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell's
recent threat to sue Stanford
if he is forced to retire, the
search for a replacement of the
28-year leader will begin soon,
according to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy said yesterday that
the University Board of Trus
tees' decision to conduct a
search for a new director of
the institution complies with a
1959 trustee resolution that
top administrative positions be
relinquished at age 65.
"All that is happening is the

enforcement of (Campbell's)
scheduled retirement," Ken
nedy said, adding that excep
tions to this requirement are
"extremely rare."
Given the historically
strained relations between
Hoover and Stanford, Kennedy
said, "the decision to enforce
his retirement is in the interest
of the relationship of the two
institutions." According to
Kennedy, the search for a new
Hoover director will "move
ahead" even if Campbell
decides to challenge the deci
sion.
