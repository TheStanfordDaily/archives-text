# Threat will not deter search for new director
## 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
Depite Hoover Institute Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell's
recent threat to sue Stanford
if he is forced to retire, the
search for a replacement of the
28-year leader will begin soon,
according to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy said yesterday that
the University Board of Trus
tees' decision to conduct a
search for a new director of
the institution complies with a
1959 trustee resolution that
top administrative positions be
relinquished at age 65.
"All that is happening is the

enforcement of (Campbell's)
scheduled retirement," Ken
nedy said, adding that excep
tions to this requirement are
"extremely rare."
Given the historically
strained relations between
Hoover and Stanford, Kennedy
said, "the decision to enforce
his retirement is in the interest
of the relationship of the two
institutions." According to
Kennedy, the search for a new
Hoover director will "move
ahead" even if Campbell
decides to challenge the deci
sion.
University Provost James
Rosse said he was "not particu
larly surprised" by Campbell's op
position to forced retirement but
declined to comment on specula
tion that the University is using
the age restriction as an oppor
tunity to force a change in the
leadership of Hoover.
Rosse added that he hopes any
resistance by Campbell to the

scheduled retirement will not im
pede the search process.
According to Trustee President
Warren Christopher, a 10-mem
ber University search committee
appointed in 1985 will be
"promptly activated." Kennedy
said the search for a new Hoover
director will be national in scope,
although candidates from Stan
ford and Hoover will be consid
ered for the directorship.
The committee has not yet met,
and no meeting has been sched
uled, according to committee chair

Gerald Dorfman.
Although the search committee
was created three years ago ex
pressly to prepare for the task of
finding a successor to Campbell
when he retired, Dorfman said
the committee had not been an
ticipating his retirement this year.
Dorfman, a senior fellow at
Hoover, said the announcement
of the trustees' decision to request
Campbell's retirement was unex
pected. He said he was "totally
surprised" by a telephone message
alerting him of the move Monday.
