## Green, Hagey-Birch ousted in NCAA semifinals 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
LOS ANGELES — After serving a
double-fault in the sixth game of her
NCAA singles semifinal match
against Stanford's Lisa Green,
Florida freshman Halle Cioffi had a
look of disgust on her face.
She had reason to be disgusted

with herself. Double-faulting in the first set against
Green yesterday was comparable to walking the
pitcher in baseball. Just throw strikes. Or, in tennis
parlance, just keep the ball on the court.
For most of yesterday's match at UCLA's Los
Angeles Tennis Center, Green was like a wild Nolan
Ryan. She hit the ball hard, but not where she
wanted to. By the time the Cardinal sophomore
regained the golden touch that had gotten her to
the semifinals, Cioffi had won the first nine games
of the match and was well on her way to a 6-0,
6-3 victory.
"All she (Cioffi) basically had to do was keep the
ball in the court, and I was missing," Green said.
"She had a lot of great wins this week — she
was our rock," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said
of Green. "Cioffi I'm sure would have traded (yes
terday's) match for the team match."
That team match was Sunday's NCAA final, when
Green posted a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Cioffi to lead
the Cardinal to a 5-2 victory over Florida.
Cioffi said the previous loss to Green provided
incentive for her yesterday. "When we lost in the
team (championship), I was so mad," Cioffi said.
"I just came out here wanting to do so well so bad."
"So bad" is probably how Green would have de
scribed her play in the first set yesterday. She won
only nine points and was plagued by unforced errors
in much the same way that she had been in her
semifinal loss last year against Florida's Shaun
Stafford.
"I was just really slow getting started," Green
said. "I wasn't into it at all at the beginning. Men
tally, I'm a little tired, and I wasn't able to be as
intense as the other days."
Cioffi didn't make anyone forget Martina Nav
ratilova, but she did keep the rallies going until
Green either hit out or into the net. In the first
set, Cioffi had only one unforced error.
"Cioffi didn't do that much," Brennan said. "I
think Lisa felt, 'Gee, I could have beat her.' Of
course, Cioffi might have risen to the challenge (if
Green had played better)."
Green did, in fact, pick up her game after losing
the first three games of the second set to trail 0-6,
0-3.
But both coach and player agreed that Green

'(Green) had a lot of great
wins this week. She was our
rock. Cioffi I'm sure would
have traded (yesterday's)
match for the team match.'

didn't get going until it was too late. "It's pretty
tough to let her get to nine-love and come back,"
Brennan said.
"After losing the first nine games, it's almost
impossible to come back," Green added.
Green did cut Cioffi's second-set lead to 4-3, but
Cioffi then held serve and broke Green to win the
match.
In doubles action yesterday, the high-wire act of
Stanford freshman Sandra Birch and senior Cari
Hagey finally came to an end in the semifinals. The
fifth-seeded Cardinal pair squandered a match point
and lost to Miami's Ronni Reis and Jami Yonekura
7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 7-5.
Birch and Hagey played three three-set matches
en route to the semifinals, including a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3
victory over Florida's fourth-seeded Cioffi and Cathy
Goodrich in yesterday's quarterfinals.
Card notes
Cioffi battles Stafford in tonight's singles final. It's the
first time in collegiate women's tennis history that two
teammates have met in the final. "It just shows that we
really are a great team," Stafford said, referring to the
team's loss against Stanford in Sunday's team final.
In the doubles final, Reis and Yonekura will meet
UCLA's Allyson Cooper and Stella Sampras.
With Green losing in singles and Birch and Hagey
falling in doubles, Stanford will not have anybody in the
individual finals for the first time since it has been in
the collegiate women's tennis national championships
(which began in 1977). The Cardinal had the last three
singles champions (Linda Gates in 1985 and Patty Fendick
in 1986 and 1987).
Still, Brennan said he was pleased with his team's
performance this week. "I think we made a good showing
in the individuals without our two No. 1 players (freshman
Tami Whitlinger and junior Eleni Rossides, who was not
at 100 percent after returning from a three-month layoff),"
he said.
"It would have been a different story with Lisa, Eleni
and Tami. We might have had three out of four semi
finalists. Who knows?"

Green yesterday was comparable to walking the
pitcher in baseball. Just throw strikes. Or, in tennis
parlance, just keep the ball on the court.
For most of yesterday's match at UCLA's Los
Angeles Tennis Center, Green was like a wild Nolan
Ryan. She hit the ball hard, but not where she
wanted to. By the time the Cardinal sophomore
regained the golden touch that had gotten her to
the semifinals, Cioffi had won the first nine games
of the match and was well on her way to a 6-0,
6-3 victory.
"All she (Cioffi) basically had to do was keep the
ball in the court, and I was missing," Green said.
"She had a lot of great wins this week — she
was our rock," Stanford Coach Frank Brennan said
of Green. "Cioffi I'm sure would have traded (yes
terday's) match for the team match."
That team match was Sunday's NCAA final, when
Green posted a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Cioffi to lead
the Cardinal to a 5-2 victory over Florida.
Cioffi said the previous loss to Green provided
incentive for her yesterday. "When we lost in the
team (championship), I was so mad," Cioffi said.
"I just came out here wanting to do so well so bad."
"So bad" is probably how Green would have de
scribed her play in the first set yesterday. She won
only nine points and was plagued by unforced errors
in much the same way that she had been in her
semifinal loss last year against Florida's Shaun
Stafford.
"I was just really slow getting started," Green
said. "I wasn't into it at all at the beginning. Men
tally, I'm a little tired, and I wasn't able to be as
intense as the other days."
Cioffi didn't make anyone forget Martina Nav
ratilova, but she did keep the rallies going until
Green either hit out or into the net. In the first
set, Cioffi had only one unforced error.
"Cioffi didn't do that much," Brennan said. "I
think Lisa felt, 'Gee, I could have beat her.' Of
course, Cioffi might have risen to the challenge (if
Green had played better)."
Green did, in fact, pick up her game after losing
the first three games of the second set to trail 0-6,
0-3.
But both coach and player agreed that Green

'(Green) had a lot of great
wins this week. She was our
rock. Cioffi I'm sure would
have traded (yesterday's)
match for the team match.'

didn't get going until it was too late. "It's pretty
tough to let her get to nine-love and come back,"
Brennan said.
"After losing the first nine games, it's almost
impossible to come back," Green added.
Green did cut Cioffi's second-set lead to 4-3, but
Cioffi then held serve and broke Green to win the
match.
In doubles action yesterday, the high-wire act of
Stanford freshman Sandra Birch and senior Cari
Hagey finally came to an end in the semifinals. The
fifth-seeded Cardinal pair squandered a match point
and lost to Miami's Ronni Reis and Jami Yonekura
7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 7-5.
Birch and Hagey played three three-set matches
en route to the semifinals, including a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3
victory over Florida's fourth-seeded Cioffi and Cathy
Goodrich in yesterday's quarterfinals.
Card notes
Cioffi battles Stafford in tonight's singles final. It's the
first time in collegiate women's tennis history that two
teammates have met in the final. "It just shows that we
really are a great team," Stafford said, referring to the
team's loss against Stanford in Sunday's team final.
In the doubles final, Reis and Yonekura will meet
UCLA's Allyson Cooper and Stella Sampras.
With Green losing in singles and Birch and Hagey
falling in doubles, Stanford will not have anybody in the
individual finals for the first time since it has been in
the collegiate women's tennis national championships
(which began in 1977). The Cardinal had the last three
singles champions (Linda Gates in 1985 and Patty Fendick
in 1986 and 1987).
Still, Brennan said he was pleased with his team's
performance this week. "I think we made a good showing
in the individuals without our two No. 1 players (freshman
Tami Whitlinger and junior Eleni Rossides, who was not
at 100 percent after returning from a three-month layoff),"
he said.
"It would have been a different story with Lisa, Eleni
and Tami. We might have had three out of four semi
finalists. Who knows?"

Despite being a freshman playing in her first NCAA Championships, Sandra Birch teamed with senior
Carl Hagey to advance to the semifinals of the doubles tournament before bowing out.
