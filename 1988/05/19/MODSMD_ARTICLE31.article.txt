# Bruins a bunch of ladies' men
## 
### 
There are 22 new men in my
life.
And they're a hockey team.
I've been swept off my feet
by the Boston Bruins, that
loveable bunch of thugs on
skates; the team that revels in
adversity and delights in
distress.

You see, as a Northern
Californian, I've been pretty
unfamiliar with hockey; we had
the San Francisco Seals when
I was little, but all I remember
about them was I liked their
name.
So all this time, I've been
under the impression that all
hockey players were big, ugly
brutes with no teeth named
Jacques, or were equally big
and even uglier Russians with
no teeth named Yuri.
In fact, my only positive as
sociation with the game was
the 1980 "Miracle on Ice,"
when a squad of fresh-faced
U.S. kids upset said unlovely
Russians in the Olympic
games. But, of course, that was
amateur hockey — not the bru
tal, uncouth NHL.
I wondered why supermodel
Carol Alt (of Sports Illustrated
swimsuit fame) would possibly
want to marry a hockey player
— and a member of the bar
baric New York Rangers (Ron
Greshner) at that!
I was even more astounded
to learn that women comprise
a higher percentage of the fans
in hockey than in any other
sport. Fifty percent of hockey
afficionados are women!
What, I asked myself, is their
problem? Is it that cold and
boring in the nether reaches
of the country that there is
nothing else to do?
Then I discovered the awful
truth: Hockey is not just played
by large, cretinous men nick
named "The Enforcer." The
best players are these slighter,
faster guys who actually have
teeth and are often good
looking! Hockey players! Can
you believe it??
In fact, most teams have just

a few villainous thugs, whose
job it is to try to stop the skill
ful, better-looking guys —
preferably by maiming them,
it seems — but the quicker,
better players usually win out.
Which is why you've heard of
Wayne Gretzky, but not of his
teammate, Marty McSorley,
whose claim to fame is his vi
cious spearing of Calgary's
Mike Bullard during the first
round of the playoffs.
Despite such unpleasant in
cidents, hockey is a lot of fun
to watch. Especially with men
like Pittsburgh's Mario
Lemieux (who beat out Gretzky
for the scoring title this year),
Detroit's Steve Yzerman, and
New Jersey's Sean Burke (a
goalie!).
Boston wins top honors,
however, on the strength of
defenseman Ray Bourke and
the fact that they play at the
Boston Garden, along with a
thrilling trip through the
playoffs, which included the
Bruins' win over Montreal in
the playoffs for the first time
in 18 series, and a bizarre
matchup with New Jersey in
which the NHL was forced to
use amateur referees for one
game.
In fact, the referee fiasco was
perhaps one of the most enter
taining incidents I have ever
seen in professional sports.
Game four of the series was
delayed for over an hour be
cause the regular officials
refused to take the ice after
the New Jersey Devils obtained
a court order allowing coach
Jim Schoenfeld to take his
place behind the bench.
Schoenfeld had been
suspended by the NHL for ac
costing an official the previous
game and telling him to "have
another doughnut" — clearly
grounds for suspension in a
league wracked with so much
violence and people like Marty
McSorley.
The upshot was that the
NHL used amateur refs culled
from the Meadowlands crowd
and dressed them in yellow
practice jerseys that looked
more like pi\jamas than any
thing else. Embarrassing for
the NHL, maybe, but enter
taining.
So now, thanks to the
Bruins, the Devils and the
NHL, the hockey myth has
been shattered, and I've joined
that female 50 percent of
hockey fans.
