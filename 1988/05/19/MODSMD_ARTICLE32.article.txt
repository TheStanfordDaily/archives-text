# Wheaton waylaid on way to pros
## 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
He orignially planned to attend
Stanford for a year of seasoning
before turning professional, but
freshman David Wheaton got
more than he bargained for.
Wheaton, the No. 1 U.S. junior
and No. 2 junior in the world, is
one of the more celebrated players
to enter college in recent years.
Coached by tennis guru Nick Bol
letieri, Wheaton won the U.S.
Open junior title last year.
Unlike many of Bolletieri's
noted baseliners (including
Jimmy Arias and Aaron Krick
stein), Wheaton's game isn't one
dimensional; he combines a
potent two-handed backhand
groundstroke with a punishing
serve-and-volley game.
"David's one of the top pros
pects in the world," said UCLA
men's tennis Coach Glenn Bas
sett. "The future is unlimited for
him."
In his first college competition
this fall, Wheaton reached the
final of the prestigious Volvo/All-
America tournament, bowing to
USC senior Scott Melville.
Wheaton was the nation's No. 2
player in the preseason rankings.
Playing for the top-ranked
Stanford team, the 6-foot-3, 175-
pound Wheaton looked like a sure
bet to do as he pleased in college
tennis, just as a Cardinal fresh
man named John McEnroe did on
the Farm 10 years ago. McEnroe
won the NCAA singles champion
ship in 1978 and turned pro after
his freshman year.
"Other than John McEnroe,
David probably has as good an
all-around game at this stage in
his development as anyone I've
ever coached," said Stanford
Coach Dick Gould, who has had
Roscoe Tanner, Tim Mayotte and
Gene Mayer play for his Cardinal
squads.
Because of ir\juries, however,
Wheaton's McEnroe-like talent
was missing this year at Stanford.
Wheaton iryured his left wrist in
December, knocking his devlop
ment back a notch and forcing
him to miss singles action for
more than three months. Last
month, soon after the wrist injury
healed, Wheaton pulled a groin
muscle at the Pacific 10 Confer
ence championships, pushing him
back yet another notch.
When he played at No. 2 and
No. 3 singles between ir\juries,
Wheaton's serve and ground
strokes were lacking, his consis
tency just not there.
Used to getting his way in the

juniors, the freshman from Ex
celsior, Minn., also found the
caliber of college tennis unexpec
tedly high.
Even though his 15-3 overall
record is impressive, Wheaton
barely eked past several players
not near his ranking. Against
UCLA at Stanford last month, he
bowed to unheralded Bruin Brian
Garrow.
Not in top condition because of
the groin pull, Wheaton's current
No. 5 ranking is based more on
his reputation than his play.
"It's hard to dominate college
tennis," Wheaton said. "It seems
like everyone beats everyone. Any
No. 1 player from any other team
can beat you. That's kind of sur
prised me."
After resting a bit in practice
over the last two weeks, Wheaton
is healthy for the NCAA Tennis
Championships this weekend in
Athens, Ga. A winner who has
dealt with hard knocks before,
Wheaton can't be discounted in
the singles championships â€” or
in the doubles championships
with sophomore teammate Jeff
Tarango.
"David, like John McEnroe, has
the ability to come up with a great
shot at any time," Gould said.
"Every aspect of his game is solid.
He's a tremendous athlete and
tennis player who, if he stays in
jury free, will make a big mark
internationally. He has to be one
of the favorites for an individual
title."
Despite his injuries and diffi
culties this season, Wheaton is
the confident sort. He eyes the
pro tour and is wary about staying
in college tennis for too long.
"I'm glad I came to Stanford,"
Wheaton said. "I didn't have it
in my own mind to play on the
tour week in and week out.
Gould's a great techician. He's
helped me tremendously with my
serve and volley."
"But it kind of scares me to see
so many top juniors, like (USC's)
Luke Jensen, come to college and
descend in their play," he contin
ued. "When I feel I can win con
sistently on the tour, I'll turn pro.
If I had known now what I didn't
know when I won the Open, I
wouldn't have come to college."
And while injuries may have
knocked his game back a couple
of notches and deprived Stanford
of seeing him at his best, a
healthy, confident Wheaton may
surprise some people in Athens
and make it onto the tour.
For a player with unparalleled
talent, what could be Stanford's
loss will be the pro circuit's gain.
