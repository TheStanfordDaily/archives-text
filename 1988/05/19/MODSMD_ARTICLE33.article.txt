Ultimate Frisbee
Two weeks after taking the
Northern California Collegiate
Ultimate Championships, the
Stanford men's utimate frisbee
team continued its winning ways
by capturing the Western Re
gional Championships at San Jose
State. The 13 best college ultimate
teams west of the Rockies battled
during two hard days of tourna
ment play. On Sunday, Stanford
emerged as the top team in the
West with a still unblemished 31-
0 record.
The Cardinal, the tournament's
No. 1 seed, opened play Saturday
against a familiar rival, No. 9 seed
California. Stanford came out
very tight against a fired-up Bear
squad and committed several
early turnovers. With the game
tied at 7-7, Stanford's zone
defense once again took charge
and propelled the Cardinal to a
15-9 victory.
Next, Stanford was matched
against No. 8 UCLA in a game
to determine pairings for the
quarterfinals. The young and un
dermanned Bruin team proved no
match for the Cardinal, falling 15-
6.
Stanford's last game Saturday
was a quarterfinal match against
No. 7 UC-Santa Cruz, which had
finished second in its pool. In a
repeat of the two teams' last meet
ing two weeks before, Stanford
jumped out to an early lead over
the Banana Slugs and never
looked back as it cruised to a 15-9
win.
Sunday morning, the Cardinal
squared off against the No. 4 seed,

UC-Santa Barbara. Even though
it fielded several injured players,
Stanford was still able to break
an early 3-3 deadlock and burst
out to a commanding 13-5 lead.
Stanford kept the pressure on and
closed out the game with a con
vincing 17-8 victory, which Stan
ford senior co-captain Keith
Sarkisian called "our best game
of the tournament."
In a long awaited final game,
the Cardinal was matched against
the tournament's No. 2 seed, Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo. Coming off
its unexpectedly easy semifinal
win, Stanford was taken by
surprise and found itself down 6-4
and without the disc.
"Cal Poly-SLO came out really
hard," said Stanford senior Steve
Weilbach. "They really wanted to
be the ones to kick us out of
Nationals."
The Cardinal fought its way
back into the game to tie the score
at 9-9 and quickly called a time
out. Abandoning its zone defense
for the first time this year, Stan
ford played an inspired man-to
man and created a dramatic turn
around on an 8-1 run, closing out
Cal Poly-SLO 17-10.
The Cardinal now moves on to
UC-Santa Barbara over Memorial
Day weekend to try to capture its
second collegiate national title.
