# Oilers edge Bruins 2-1 in Stanley Cup opener
## 
### 
EDMONTON, Alb. - Sel
dom-used Keith Acton deflected
in Steve Smith's slapshot early
in the final period last night to
give the Edmonton Oilers a 2-1
victory over the Boston Bruins
in the opener of the Stanley Cup
finals.
Acton, playing only his third
playoff game this year, got the
game-winner 1:15 into the final
period to break up a fierce de
fensive battle that featured the
return of former Oiler goal
tender Andy Moog to the
Northlands Coliseum.
Moog, facing his former team
mates for the first time since
the Oilers traded him to Boston
last March, played effectively.
But Edmonton's Grant Fuhr,
Moog's teammate through four
previous Stanley Cup finals, got
the victory with some help from
a stiff defense that allowed the
Bruins only 14 shots on goal.
Moog last played in a Stanley
Cup final for the Oilers in 1984
and also saw action last year in
the first round.
Fuhr, meanwhile, was playing
in his 33rd straight playoff game
dating back to last year.
The defending champion
Oilers snuffed out six Boston
power plays in winning their
ninth straight home game in
this year's playoffs. Overall,

they are 13-2, sandwiching 4-1
victories over Winnipeg and
Detroit around a four-game
sweep in Calgary.
Boston, which beat Buffalo,
Montreal and New Jersey for
the Wales Conference title, fell
behind 1-0 early in the second
period on a goal by Wayne
Gretzky.
The Bruins tied the game at
14:13 of the middle period on
Cam Neely's goal.
But Smith, who also had an
assist on Gretzky's goal, took
Kevin McClelland's centering
pass and ripped a slapshot from
45 feet in front of Moog.
Acton, a late-season pickup
from Minnesota, tipped it past
a helpless Moog for his second
playoff goal. He also had the
winner in the Campbell Confer
ence clincher against Detroit.
The best-of-seven series
resumes with Game 2 in Ed
monton tomorrow night.
The scoreless first period fea
tured good defense and sharp
goaltending by both teams.
The Oilers had two power
play opportunities, but were un
able to get a shot on either one.
The Bruins had three chances
with the man advantage and
were able to get off only one
shot on each.
The Oilers had a great scoring

chance in the last minute of the
first period, but were turned
away on a fine play by Moog.
Mike Krushelnyski had the
puck at the left boards when he
fed Gretzky in front. Gretzky
shot on the fly from about 10
feet in front, but Moog turned
it aside.
The Oilers outshot the Bruins
6-5 in the first 20 minutes, with
Fuhr making his best stops on
Boston defensemen Gord
Kluzak and Michael Thelven.
The Oilers finally broke the
scoreless tie with a power-play
goal by Gretzky 1:56 into the
second period.
Gretzky started the play by
feeding Smith in the deep slot.
Smith shot and the puck
bounced off Moog. Gretzky then
tapped it free from defenseman
Glen Wesley's skates and
banked it in off Moog and the
post for his 10th goal of the
playoffs and seventh on the
power play.
The Bruins tied it on Neely's
eighth playoff goal.
Craig Janney took a hit at
the Oilers' blue line that freed
Neely, who fired a slapshot from
the top of the right circle that
skittered through Fuhr's pads
after the goaltender came out
to cut down the angle.
