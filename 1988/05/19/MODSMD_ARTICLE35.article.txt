DALLAS — Dallas center
forward Roy Tarpley's jaw
dropped when Mavericks Coach
John MacLeod told him Utah's
Thurl Bailey had won the NBA
Sixth Man Award that was an
nounced yesterday.
"My heart about hit the floor,"
Tarpley said. "Then he told me 1
had won it."
"I've been sitting on this for a
week," MacLeod said after the
Mavericks squeaked past the Den
ver Nuggets 110-106 in Game 5
of their NBA playoff series.
Although Tarpley learned of his
award Tuesday night, the NBA
officially bestowed the honor for
outstanding contributions by a
non-starter yesterday, climaxing
Tarpley's comeback from a battle
with alcohol and chemical abuse
last year.
"It's a great honor, and I really
feel good about winning it," said
Tarpley, the first Dallas player to
receive a major postseason honor.
He finished seventh in the
league in total rebounds, the first
reserve in NBA history to finish
among the top 10 in rebounding.
The 7-foot Tarpley started in
only nine of the 81 games he
played, averaged 11.8 rebounds,
13.5 points and 28.5 minutes,
helping the Mavericks compile a
53-29 record.
Tarpley, a second-year pro out
of Michigan, received 67 votes
from an 80-member panel of writ
ers and broadcasters who regu
larly cover the NBA.
