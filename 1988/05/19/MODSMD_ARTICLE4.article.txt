# Stanford narrows gap on Harvard: 64 percent accept admission
## 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
No freshman applicants will be admit
ted from the wait list and very few trans
fer applicants will gain admission to Stan
ford this year because an exceptionally
high percentage of admitted freshman
have decided to accept offers of admis
sion.
With nearly 64 percent of admitted
freshmen accepting offers, Stanford will
be one of the few elite universities that
will not have to turn to its wait list to
fill next fall's entering class, said Fresh
man Admissions Director John Bunnell.
"We're oversubscribed," he said.
Among the newly accepted students,
about 200 were honored as David Starr
Jordan scholars based on their high
school academic records. Bunnell said
preliminary indications show that a
greater percentage of admitted Jordan
scholars planned to attend Stanford than
last year. Thirty-eight percent of last

year's admitted Jordan Scholars chose to
enroll at Stanford.
In an attempt to boost matriculation
of Jordan scholars and minority students,
the University this year tried a new
recruiting technique of offering travel
subsidies to visit Stanford as "pro-fros."
Only students with determined financial
need were given travel aid, Bunnell said.
Statistics on the succeas of that recruit
ment program and a breakdown of the
overall number of students accepting ad
mission will be available next week.
Although he said exact figures have
not yet been compiled, Bunnell said mi
nority acceptance rates "look good."
Other private universities, in
cluding Harvard, Yale and Princeton will
admit students from their wait lists for
the 1988-89 year. Last year at Stanford,
90 students were admitted from the wait
list.
Stanford's yield this year exceeds last
year's rate by almost 4 percent, Bunnell
said, adding that the high yield narrows

the gap between Stanford and Harvard,
the only major private university with a
higher yield than Stanford. Last year,
Stanford's yield ratio was 60 percent,
while Harvard's was 74 percent — a 14
percent difference. This year, Bunnell es
timates Harvard will have an acceptance
yield of about 70 percent.
The yield — which Bunnell measured
yesterday at "1,602 students and rising"
— may be so high that it might cause a
variety of administrative problems. In ad
dition to cutting down on spaces for
transfers and wait-list students, housing
and freshman English assignments may
also be complicated by the exceptionally
high yield, Bunnell said.
According to Assistant Dean of Stu
dents and Director of Housing Rodger
Whitney, over 1,610 potential freshmen
have accepted Stanford offers of admis
sion, but last-minute withdrawals will
lower that number to about 1,570 fresh
men who will need housing next year.
Combined with the closing of Roble

Hall earlier this year, the higher-than
expected number of incoming freshmen
would normally have put a tremendous
strain on available housing spaces for
upperclass undergraduates next year.
However, Whitney said, a "fluke" in grad

uate housing, due to the fall opening of
the new Rains Apartments near the
Cowell Cluster, will open up over 100
previously graduate housing spaces to un
dergraduates in Crothers, Crothers
Memorial and Escondido Village.
