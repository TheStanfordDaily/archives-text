# Law School dean rejects demand for minority faculty hiring quotas
## 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
Law School Dean Paul Brest has rejected
student demands that the school institute
hiring quotas to increase the number of
minority faculty.
In a statement released Tuesday, Brest
agreed in principle with student demon
strators that affirmative action should con
tinue to play a central role in the Law
School's search for faculty, but disagreed
over the best means of achieving greater
minority and female representation on the
faculty.
Nearly 100 Law students held an impas
sioned demonstration last Friday demand
ing that the Law School hire based on
quotas. The quota system was one of
several proposals first put forward by the

Black Law Student Association in January
1987.
On Friday, demonstrators made three
immediate demands:
• that the Law School fill four of six
open tenured faculty positions with women
and minorities;
• that of the four minorities and women
to be hired, at least two must be women,
two minorities and one a minority woman;
• that enough women and minority fac
ulty be hired to ensure that all first-year
law students are taught by at least one
woman and one minority faculty member.
Students staged Friday's demonstration
in part to show solidarity with affirmative
action demands of students at Harvard
Law School. About 50 black Harvard law
students held a sit-in at the law
school dean's office in Cambridge
last Tuesday demanding that the
school increase its 57-member
tenured faculty by adding 20
women and minority professors.
Of these, they demanded, at least
seven should be black and at least
four of those seven should be
women.
According to The New York
Times, Harvard's tenured faculty
now includes two black men and
five women.
Stanford Law School, out of a
permanent faculty of 42, has four
minority professors — two
Latinos and two blacks — and
five female professors. Brest said
in his statement that he does not
regard these figures as "reason
neither for shame nor com

placency."
Brest said he disagrees with
"numerical goals" but believes
that the Law School should be
aggressive in recruiting minorities
and women. He said in February

1987, "If the school is genuinely
committed to searching far and
wide, I believe that we can find
people who can meet whatever
standards we have."
In Tuesday's statement, Brest
also took issue with student
charges that the Law School
"abuses" visiting minority profes
sors. Demonstrators claimed
there is "all-too-common
mistreatment" of visiting faculty
members who are minorities or
women.
Brest said he hopes the Law
School has learned from its mis
takes, referring to former visiting
professors Derrick Bell and
Patricia Bryan, black professors
who have alleged they were poorly
treated while they were here.
Brest stressed in his statement,
however, that "the norm" for
visiting faculty "will always be a
revolving door." Very few visiting
faculty receive permanent ap
pointments, he noted.
