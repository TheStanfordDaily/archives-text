# Few students argue against CIV change
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
The likely passage of an amend
ment to the newly passed Cul
tures, Ideas and Values legislation
has evoked little response from
students who initially pushed for
the new progam.
So far, the campus minority
groups that lobbied strongly in
favor of the legislation have not
drafted any formal responses to
the possibility of a change in CIV
legislation concerning appoint
ments to the committee that will
oversee administration of the pro
gram.
The change, prompted three
weeks ago by a faculty senator,
would eliminate the words "eth
nicity" and "gender" from the list
of factors taken into account in
appointing faculty members to the

committee. The proposed modifi
cation would replace these words
with the phrase, "interest in the
program."
The Faculty Senate is expected
to pass the amendment at its next
meeting May 26.
Julie Martinez, member of
MEChA, a Chicano student or
ganization at Stanford, said she
did not see the probable change
as important.
"The mtyor issue is that the
(Area One Committed follows
through with the spirit of CIV."
Brian Kim, next year's chair of
the Asian American Student As
sociation, sees the revision as a
sign of the bureaucratic nature of
such new legislation.
"We're knee-deep in tech
nicalities," he said.
Some students, however, have
questioned the need to change the
current wording. Stacey Leyton,
member-elect of the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents, termed the pro

posed change "ridiculous."
Although student progressive
groups have not acted to prevent
the change, Leyton said she
believes the current wording is
necessary to make sure the
provost, who is responsible for ap
pointing members of the Area One
Committee, considers race and
gender when making appoint
ments.
