UNIFIED FIELD THEORY
VE WE MISSED THE OBV
Over three hundred years ago, Isaac Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (the Principia), considered
by many the greatest single intellectual achievement of all time, revolutionized man's conception of his universe. While, in
the first quarter of this century, the Newtonian description of macro phenomena received a major adjustment from the
mind of Albert Einstein, many of the original Newtonian concepts survive and remain the cornerstones of contemporary
theory. Chief among these is the Newtonian concept of mass that appears in his second law of dynamics and his gravitational
equation. Newtonian mass can be described as the proportionality constant of momentum, i.e., the momentum of a body
divided by its velocity.
Before Bejamin Franklin pondered over the proper words to frame the colonies' independence, almost three quarters of
a century after the Principia first appeared, he conducted a series of experiments that provided the world with a new
description for the phenomena of electricity. From his efforts arose the concept of electron flow and positive and negative
charge. The charge concept would from that day forward, in a manner similar to Newtonian mass for macro phenomena,
form the foundation of physicists' descriptions of micro world events.
Multi field theories can be said to be the outgrowth of the use of mass to describe gravitational fields and charge to
describe electromagnetic fields. In the last half century, two additional field laws, the strong field and weak field, have added
to the confusion. Might, however, there be something inherent in these concepts of mass and charge, put forth long before
the many subatomic particles were isolated and studied, that prevents the unification of macro and micro phenomena? And
must we be forced to accept these concepts as axiomatic truths on which all physical knowledge must be supported? Einstein
felt the key to future understanding rested on where our allegiance was placed. If we relied upon, and revered too heavily,
the idols of our past, then we placed severe limits upon our knowledge. It was only through continual reflection on current
foundations that we left the door open for more comprehensive understanding. "Concepts that have proved useful in the
constitution of an order of things readily win such an influence over us that we forget their earthly origin, such concepts
then become stamped as necessities of thought, as given a priori, so the path of scientific progress becomes impassable for
a long period It might be said that Einstein intuitively felt that the current reliance on multi field theories represented proof
in the fault of current conceptions. Divergent sets of physical laws for large and small was incongruous. While he sensed
the answer to a unified field theory lay within general relativity theory and light's particle/wave duality, he was never able
to unlock the mystery.
I have used the term unified field as if it is familiar to the reader. A unified field theory simply suggests a set of laws,
constructed from a single set of concepts, applying to all phenomena large and small.
While mass was originally a macro concept, it was to find its way into descriptions of atomic phenomena. Particles such
as electrons or protons should, it was believed, behave in some ways like macro bodies and could therefore be described
in terms of distinct masses. But when equations of particles, in terms of masses, are mixed with equations of particles, in
teTms of i harge, anomalies result. Rather than examining the concepts of mass and charge that engendered the anomalies,
physicists blamed the anomalies on the particles themselves. The particles were then said to exhibit anomalous behavior!
Cause and effect was replaced by uncertainty and probability in describing atomic phenomena. When Einstein didn't accept
this creative solution to the problem, he separated himself from the mainstream of the physics community. From then on
Einstein's views, and his quest for a unified field theory, were depicted as the folly of a once-great man who no longer
possessed the creativity and intellectual prowess of his younger days.
Fh<> difficulty of applying the mass concept in the atomic domain can be seen by considering a number of elementary
partic e equations. We begin by comparing Bohr's equation for hydrogen electron angular momentum and the Deßrodie
particle wave equation. From Bohr we have:
p• r = nh/2ir where p = electron momentum —mv
(electron mass times orbital velocity).
r = distaince separating proton and electron in a hydrongen atom.
h = Planck's constant
n = principal quantum number
Rearranging the Bohr Equation, we obtain:
p/n * h/2irr
For Bohr 2m (electron orbit) could be equated to electron wavelength (X), so we have:
p/n = h/\
Thus in classical Bohr theory electron momentum divided by the principal quantum number equals Planck's constant divided
by wavelength.
The Deßroglie matter wave equation for this same electron is:
X =» h/p or p = h/A
In that the Deßroglie equation is void of the principal quantum number, n, there appears to be conflict between Bohr and
Deßroglie. This can be resolved by recognizing p/n and p are both equal to the actual electron momentum. In Bohr's case,
the actual electron momentum is given by the ground state momentum divided by the principle quantum number n. In
Deßroglie's case, p, by itself, is the electron's actual momentum, or:
p = p g /n = h/A
Remembering \ equaled 2irr, we can write:
p g /n = h/2irr or p g r/n = h/2ir
By reflecting on the above relationships we encounter an enigma. According to Newtonian dynamics, electron momentum
will be equal to electron mass times electron velocity. As the hydrogen electron jumps from its ground state (n= 1) to a
higher energy level p K /n or p, the actual electron momentum, is reduced. If electron mass is a constant, then a reduction
in momentum must result in a corresponding reduction in electron velocity. By introducing two further elementary equa
tions, we will demonstrate that this does not appear to be a possibility.
When the hydrogen atom is treated in the classical manner, as a particle moving in an orbit around the proton the force
on this electron is given by either of two equations.
F = and F = q^/r 2 = q'/r 2 when q, ■q 2
I have elected to use cgs units where q is in electrostatic units to avoid the use of the constant kin the charge equation.
The equality of these equations can be shown by substituting in the contemporary values.
F » mvVr = (9.1 x 10 jll g) (2.2 x 10 <> cm/sec) i
5.3 x 10~ 9 cm
= 8.3 x 10" 1 dynes
F ■ qVr 2 = (4.8 x 1Q~ 10 esu)*
(5.3 x 10"cm) 2
= 8.2 x 10 1 dynes
The slight difference in forces is attributed to the rounding of units. The ability to express the force on an electron from
either of these two equations allows us to equate the equations and solve for q
q 2 /H ■ mv^/r
q = (mv'<r)''' or q = (mvr»v) ,/7
Since q is a constant, the term mvr.v must be constant for any r. From review of the Bohr and Deßroglie equations, we have:
P *r « p„»r/n ■ h/2ir
That is to say, p»r equals a constant and, since p » mv, the term mvr in the charge equation will equal the constant h/2iT
But can both mvr and mvr*v remain constant as r changes?
At first glance, we do not appear to have a problem For instance, if r doubles, mv simply goes to 1/2 mv and the constant
rules are obeyed. If, however, m is to stay constant, the reduction in mv must be totally accounted for by a reduction in
electron velocity to 1/2 v. As there are two v terms in the equation, q « (mvr.v)" 2 , if vis reduc ed to 1/2 v when r goes to
2 f , q| cannot remain constant There is no escape from this predicament We must choose between a variable mass i
variable charge, or variations in both charge and mass as electron energy levels are c hanged
Physicists appear to be correct in concluding elementary particles cannot be causally accounted for within the current
conceptions that frame our laws of physics. However, it seems premature to conclude particles do not follow causal laws
based upon other conceptions It is just as likely it is our concepts that are at fault, not the particles The mass and charge
concepts, created before particle data was available, have painted physics into a corner generating the need for multi field
theories in order to extricate itself.
It is not possible in the limited space herein to propose a solutk>n to this dilemma, although in the writer's opinion Einstein
was correcl in suggesting the answer lies within general relativity theory and a greater understanding of light Any riders
