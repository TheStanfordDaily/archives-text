I'm a very spontaneous
person. That's why I like
a hairstyle that can go
from the office, to the
park, to a night on the
town. So, naturally I go
to Great Expectations;
where I always get a cut
that's unbelievably
versatllel Sure, my
spontaneity drives my
boyfriend crazy, but at
least I don't have to
worry about my hair
driving me crazy!
