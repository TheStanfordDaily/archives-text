# Exhibit records Armenian war deaths
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
During World War I, over 1 mil
lion Armenians were killed by the
Ottoman Empire, yet some say
the deaths have largely gone un
recognized.
To promote awareness of what
they call the "Armenian geno
cide," the Stanford Armenian Stu
dents' Association has created an
exhibit on the second floor of
Meyer Library.
Books, documents and posters
showing evidence of the genocide
will remain on display in three
glass cases until the end of this
month.
Although some have praised the
exhibit, it is not without its
detractors.
One poster reveals a com
munique dated February 1918 or
dering that "All the Armenians
in the country who are Ottoman
subjects, from five years of age

upwards, are to be taken out of
the towns and slaughtered."
Graduate student Ekmel Oz
bay, head of the Stanford Associ
ation of Students from Turkey,
called the document "ridiculous."
Stressing that he did not speak
for the entire Turkish communi
ty, he said the document was con
tradictory because if the order was
carried out, there would not be
any Armenians left in Turkey
today.
Ozbay said there were a sub
stantial number of Armenians,
mostly businessmen and minis
ters, left in Istanbul after the war.
History Prof. Alexander Dallin
said there is no doubt among his
torians that there were "massive
casualties" among the Armenian
population during the war. He
added, however, that there is con
siderable disagreement on the
numbers of victims.
Rupert Horupian, press repre

sentative for the Armenian Stu
dents Association, said no contro
versy should exist over the Ar
menian genocide, citing eyewit
ness accounts and contemporary
newspaper articles that document
it. He said the U.S. ambassador
to Turkey wrote a book confirm
ing the lulling of Armenians dur
ing the war
Although he admitted that Ar
menians were killed during that
time, Ozbay said they were
casualties of war, not victims of
genocide. Many of the Armenians
killed, he said, were fighting
against the Ottoman Empire.
Yet, Horupian argued that
books on display at the exhibit
record the genocide in print and
photographs.
He said the books were mostly
taken from the shelves of the li
brary and some were donated by
Psychiatry Prof. Herant Katcha
dourian, who is Armenian.
