# 'Red' Deb gets redder as chief editor
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
You can have your cake and
eat it too.
Senior Debbie Rubenstein
proved the proverbial hypothesis
false last night, as she ate seven
pieces of her very own victory
cake after a successful ballot
stuffing campaign to become
editor in chief of The Daily for
Volume 194.
"Red," as inside sources said
she was called before she "ma
tured," inhaled the pieces of
pastry and imbibed numerous
bottles of cheap $4 champagne
after learning the results.
Those results, however, were
not announced until The Daily's
current managing editor had
eaten all her fingernails, chewed
apart four drinking straws and
dug numerous inch-deep holes
in the newsroom walls.
Continuing the redhead tradi
tion, began by a Kansan named
Patzy Andrew, Rubenstein will
start her questionable term as
"da boss" in the fall.
La chica roja's first move was
to call the "rents" at home in
Washington, D.C., who had long

been asleep. Her father first told
the anonymous caller to "quit
breathing heavily," but soon
realized it was his darling
daughter who had not called for
three months.
Ma, who obviously loves her
daughter very much, said "Oh,
I'm so proud of my little girl!
I'm just so happy!"
The girl with the Brenda Starr
hair, who was definitely not cho
sen by virtue of her exciting
answering machine messages,
beat fellow managing editor Rob
Portnoy in yesterday's runoff.
The Portman, as he is called
by current editor in chief Bob
"Mitchy" Michitarian, vowed
that he would be back next year
and hinted that his role would
not be as a saboteur. "Hey, I
was hoping that the best man
would win. But if that couldn't
happen, I guess Debbie's victory
is the next best thing to being
there," Portnoy said in an all
too-relaxed way.
Deb began her esteemed
career at The Daily nine volumes
and many moons ago, helping
out as a lowly night editor.
For you Stanford Daily trivia
buffs who like to know the

answers to questions appearing
in the home game, Red will be
the fifth editor in a row from
the supposed Class of 1988 (sup
posed because the graduation of
a few of those five will be delayed
because they spent a little too

much time at The Daily and a
little too little time in class).
Current chief Michitarian said
he looks forward to the coming
"Reign of Red."
"There'll never be a typo in a
Daily ad again," he predicted.
