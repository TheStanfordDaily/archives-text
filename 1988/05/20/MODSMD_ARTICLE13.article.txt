Bush meets with black leaders
WASHINGTON — Vice President George
Bush launched an effort to include minority
voters within the ranks of his supporters by
meeting yesterday with black leaders from
across the nation, but the activists warned
later that the session solved few of their con
cerns about his presidential candidacy.
"I came here with a great deal of hope that
we'd find in Mr. Bush a new level of sensitivity
to the devastation in the black community,"
Dr. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, said after
leaving the hour-long evening session.
"I have to say at this point that hope has
not been fulfilled."
Lowery and other black leaders who spoke
with reporters outside Bush's vice presidential
residence, where the meeting took place, said
that they chiefly sparred with Bush on the
issues of the size of the military budget com
pared to social program spending, on judicial
appointments and the Department of Justice,
and on pressing concerns about education and
drug abuse.
NASA delays shuttle launch
WASHINGTON - The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration has
pushed back its estimated launching date for
the space shuttle Discovery by about two
weeks, but the space agency still hopes to
launch the shuttle in August, NASA's space
flight chief said yesterday.
Richard Truly attributed the latest delay to
slower-than-expected progress in assembling
the shuttle's solid-fuel rocket motors. The cur
rent target launching date is Aug. 22, 18 days
later than the previous estimate.
The shuttle program, halted since the Chal
lenger disaster in January 1986, will resume
as soon as program officials are convinced that
the spacecraft is safe, Truly said at a press
conference at NASA headquarters.
"I'm not clinging to August" as a launching
date, the former astronaut declared, suggest
ing that the schedule may slip further. "I just
want to fly the first day we can get that sucker
ready."
Breast cancer breakthrough
WASHINGTON — The survival of women
with early-stage breast cancer may be en
hanced by additional therapy after primary
treatment, according to three new studies, the
National Cancer Institute announced yester
day.
In a highly unusual action, the institute
released the findings before publishing them
in a medical journal or presenting them to
other researchers at a scientific meeting, which
is the traditional and accepted procedure.
"This is an important public health matter,"
Dr. Vincent DeVita, director of the institute,
said in a statement. He emphasized that
human studies could no longer ethically be
continued using a control group — that is, a
group not receiving the additional treatment.
