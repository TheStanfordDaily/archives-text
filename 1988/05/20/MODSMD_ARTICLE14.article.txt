# Unrest in S. Korea:
## Riot police halt assault on U.S. embassy 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea —
Several thousand protesters yes
terday angrily surged toward a
U.S. Embassy building here but
were beaten back in fierce street
clashes with riot police firing tear
gas in the worst outbreak of anti-
American violence in South Korea
this year.
At more than 30 other sites in
South Korea, the Yonhap News
Agency reported that thousands
of people participated in demon
strations to mark the protest
suicide of a 24-year-old student
who had denounced the United
States.
The protests, running for the
third consecutive day in Seoul,
were the largest since massive
demonstrations last summer that
led to the country's first direct
presidential elections and ap
peared to confirm a growing wave
of anti-Americanism in South
Korea, sparked in part by oppo
sition to the 43,000 U.S. troops
based here.
While the demonstrations indi
cated opposition to newly elected
President Roe Tae Woo by the
country's student population,
they were not seen as a mtyor
threat to the government in
Seoul, site of this year's Summer
Olympic Games.
Yesterday's demonstration in
Seoul, which forced the evacua
tion of the building that houses
the U.S. Information Service but
caused little damage, came at the
end of a funeral procession
bearing the coffin of Cho Sung
Man, who killed himself Sunday
by stabbing himself in the
stomach and jumping off a build
ing in downtown Seoul. Before
committing suicide, Cho de
nounced the United States and
called for the withdrawal of the
U.S. troops in South Korea as
well as for the reunification of
North and South Korea.
(In Washington, State Depart
ment press representative Charles

Redman denounced the attack,
saying there was "no excuse for
it," Reuter reported. Redman said
seven windows in the facility were
broken but there were no inju
ries.)
More than 10,000 people,
mostly students, joined yester
day's somber procession, snarling
downtown traffic for miles when
they stopped in front of city hall
for a brief rally at which a mock
American flag was burned.
The protesters held up banners
calling for a withdrawal of U.S.
troops and the reunification of
North and South Korea, divided
since the end of World War 11.
Some of the students shouted,
"Drive out the Yankee im
perialists," and several Western
correspondents covering the dem
onstration were jostled by the
jeering protesters who seemed to
assume that all the Caucasians
were American.
Instead of ending the rally as
had been agreed earlier with
police, several thousand students
headed down the street on which
the U.S. Information Service
building is located. The students
chanted out more anti-American
slogans, and one of them report
edly grabbed a plaque on the
building bearing the U.S. emblem
of the eagle and smashed it to
the ground.
With tensions rising, riot police
launched tear gas shells from spe
cially built armor-plated vans and
protesters scattered. Pedestrians,
motorists and tourists at nearby
luxury hotels choked on tear gas.
Within a few minutes, groups
of students reappeared armed
with Molotov cocktails and rocks.
They made hit-and-run attacks on
the thousands of riot police who
had formed a perimeter around
the U.S. building. Several small
fires broke out when firebombs
hit a nearby department store and
above-ground subway shelter.
