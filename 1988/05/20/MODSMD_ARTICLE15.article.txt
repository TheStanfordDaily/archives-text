# Drug smuggler convicted

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Carlos Leh
der Rivas, a self-styled Colombian
revolutionary who helped found the
world's largest cocaine cartel, was con
victed yesterday of running a sophisti
cated drug-smuggling conspiracy that
imported hundreds of millions of dollars
worth of cocaine into the United States
in 1979 and 1980.
Lehder's conviction, after seven
months of testimony and 65 days of jury
deliberations, is considered the U.S. gov
ernment's most successful assault on
the powerful Medellin cartel, a violent
conglomerate that controls as much as
80 percent of the cocaine that has
flooded the United States in recent
years.
"In the immortal words of James

Brown, 'I feel good!' " said U.S. Attorney
Robert Merkle, who stalked Lehder for
six years and prosecuted the case. "This
is truly a major victory in the war on
drugs. ... It shows our American justice
system is not intimidated by bribes,
threats, physical violence or anything
else."
Three jurors wept as they were polled
after the verdict.
Lehder, 38, was found guilty on 11
counts of a 1981 indictment involving
about 3.3 tons of cocaine secretly flown
to Georgia and Florida. But evidence in
the case linked Lehder's organization to
as much as 18 tons smuggled into the
country over eight years ending in about
1985.
