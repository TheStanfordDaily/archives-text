# Senate may amend War Powers Act
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Four leading
senators, declaring that the 15-year-old
War Powers Resolution is unworkable,
proposed changes yesterday to give the
president more flexibility in deploying
military forces while preserving a strong
congressional voice in war-making deci
sions.
Their proposed legislation was de
signed to reduce confrontation and in
crease consultation between the White
House and Capitol Hill before and after
U.S. troops are sent into action, the
authors said.
One mcgor change would drop a provi
sion in the 1973 resolution that requires
automatic withdrawal of American
forces after 60 days unless Congress ap
proves their deployment, a clause often
scorned by presidents as an unconstitu
tional limitation on their authority.
Another proposed revision, however,
would allow Congress to invoke the act
and guarantee speedier consideration of
legislation to require U.S. forces to dis
engage from hostilities if Congress dis
agreed with a presidential decision to
deploy them.
The bill also would establish a con
sultative group of top congressional
leaders, along with chairmen and
ranking members of Foreign Relations,
Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and In
telligence committees in the Senate and
House, to confer regularly with the pres
ident on global trouble spots where U.S.
troops might get involved.
In view of its powerful sponsorship
by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., Armed Services Committee
Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
ranking Republican John Warner of Vir
ginia and influential Sen. George
Mitchell, D-Maine., the proposal was
believed to have a good chance for ap
proval in the Senate this year. But its
fate in the House was uncertain.
A White House press representative
withheld immediate comment on the

new proposal until experts could study
it but added: "We, like previous admin
istrations, think the War Powers Act is
unconstitutional."
The law requires the president to
report to Congress within 48 hours of
sending U.S. troops "into hostilities or
into situations where imminent involve
ment in hostilities is clearly indicated
by the circumstances." In addition, the
law says the president must justify his
action and estimate how long the troops
might be engaged.
However, the act was never invoked
when American forces were sent to such
hostile situations as Lebanon, the Per
sian Gulf or during the invasion of
Grenada.
The main reason for this was the con
troversial provision that the troops must
be withdrawn after 60 days unless
Congress has declared war or authorized
the deployment in the meantime.
"It's obvious the legislation is unwork
able," Byrd said at a news conference.
"It telegraphs our intentions in advance
to a potential adversary and there is no
enforcement mechanism if the president
ignores the law's requirements."
The proposed bill would allow troops
sent into action by the president to
remain unless a msyority of Congress
votes specifically to recall them. It also
would create a permanent group of con
gressional leaders to consult on vital
national security issues with the presi
dent.
In addition, the consultative group
could vote to invoke the War Powers
Resolution if the president refused to
submit a report to Congress after send
ing troops into hostilities. Then the
group could introduce a resolution,
either to authorize continued deploy
ment or insist on withdrawal of the
military forces, that would be considered
without delay or filibuster in both the
Senate and House.
