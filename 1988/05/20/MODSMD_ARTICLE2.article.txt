# Hoover battle heats up
## Petition binds Fac Sen to examine Stanford's ties 
### Jeff Album Staff writer 
Two faculty members fired the first salvo
yesterday in their latest battle to reexamine
Stanford's relations with the Hoover In
stitution.

Political Science Prof.
John Manley and English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz, both
long-standing critics of the
University's ties to
Hoover, announced at a
press conference that they
had collected 57 signatures
on a petition forcing dis
cussion in the Faculty Sen
ate over Stanford-Hoover
relations.

A petition must have 50 signatures to
be placed on the senate's agenda. To obtain
the minimum number of signatures, Man
ley said the petition was sent to about 200
faculty members over the past five weeks.
The petition recommends that the Uni
versity "bring the Hoover Institution under
normal academic governance." Failing that,
it calls on the Board of Trustees to "end
connections between the University and
the political arm of the Hoover Institution."
The petition, the third of its kind
launched by Manley and Rebholtz in the
last five years, was delivered Monday to
Law Prof. John Kaplan, who will chair the
senate next year. The petition will be
debated next fall on the senate floor once
the signatures on the petition are verified.
University President Donald Kennedy
dismissed the newest challenge to Stanford-

Hoover relations, saying petitions spon
sored by Manley and Rebholz "have never
gotten substantial support" from the sen
ate.
The petition's announcement comes on
the heels of a decision by the trustees last
Tuesday to force the retirement of Hoover

Director W. Glenn Camp
bell.
Speaking to members of
the national and local
press, Manly and Rebholz
said they timed their an
nouncement to draw atten
tion to their belief that the
overall structure of the
University's relationship
to Hoover must be

revamped. A "cosmetic change" in the In
stitution's leadership is not sufficient, they
said.
"Our (Stanford's) image is inextricably
linked with their activities, and that's dan
gerous for the University," Manley said.
"We've never defined the problem of
Hoover as 'Glenn Campbell.' His departure
won't affect the fundamental independence
of the institution," Manley added.
Currently, the institution's operations
are independant of Stanford. However, the
University exerts limited influence on
Hoover's appointment and hiring proc
esses. For example, the University presi
dent appointed three of the 10 members
who serve on the search committee for
Campbell's replacement.
Manley emphasized that the resolution
