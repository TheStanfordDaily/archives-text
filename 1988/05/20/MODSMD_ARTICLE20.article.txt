## Happy trails to you

GOOD RIDDANCE. Like a
rhinestone cowboy, Hoover
Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell has to ride off into
the sunset.
On Tuesday, the Board of Trus
tees unanimously "asked" the con
troversial director to pack his sad
dlebags and retire when he reaches
age 65 next year. It is customary
that top administrators step down
at that age, Trustees President
Warren Christopher said.
The trustees are too gutless to
be straightforward about why they
asked Campbell to leave. But it's
about time they asked.
Campbell has been Hoover's di
rector since 1960 and although he
has overseen the think tank's
remarkable growth, he is also
largely responsible for Hoover's
negative image as a vehemently
narrow-minded conservative insti
tution.
Campbell's legacy will be far
from positive. His extreme par
tisanship, his poor judgment when
making public statements and his
disrespect for legitimate criticism
has cursed Hoover — and the Uni
versity — with the brand of closed
mindedness.
Campbell is well-known for his
many ill-conceived remarks. In
April, the crusty Campbell dis
missed faculty members critical of
Hoover as "very left-wing and very
undistinguished." And last year,
faculty members were ready to
round up a posse when Campbell
boasted that bringing the Reagan
Library to Stanford would mean
that "not only the Hoover Institu

tion ... (could) boast of a Reagan
connection."
Campbell was also out of line to
become chairman of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Foundation,
which worked to bring the Reagan
Library to campus. His position
compromised both the University's
and Hoover's commitment to non
partisanship.
During his tenure, Hoover has
come under considerable fire from
faculty members who argue that
Stanford's connection with the in
stitution damages the University.
Yesterday, 57 professors urged the
Faculty Senate to bring Hoover un
der normal University governance
or sever relations.
It's high noon in the OK Corral
— and Hoover and Stanford are
facing off.
Campbell will soon be out of the
picture, and the University and
Hoover would be wise to work to
minimize the partisan image that
he embodies.
In searching for Campbell's re
placement, the trustees should
seize upon the opportunity to find
a director who will encourage a
wider range of research and turn
the institution away from its ide
ological bent.
Meanwhile, Hoover should seek
to regain some of its lost
credibility. The best way Hoover
could do this would be to drop its
goal, which is to "demonstrate the
evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx," and adopt a more intellec
tually open-minded purpose.
Campbell has been sent out to
pasture. Happy trails to you.
