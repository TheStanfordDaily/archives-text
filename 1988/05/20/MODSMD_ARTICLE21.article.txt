## SIDO was hypocritical when it promoted its fast 
### 
HOLY HYPOCRISY, Batman!
Yesterday the Stanford Interna
tional Development Organiza
tion sponsored an all-campus fast to
supposedly "raise money for the
hungry both locally and in developing
countries," according to an advertise
ment found on dining hall tables this
week. However, not one penny of the
money raised will actually go to allevi
ate hunger anywhere.
One side of the SIDO advertisement
used a strong emotional appeal to
capture student interest in the fast. It
is difficult to ignore these facts and
not want to do something to alleviate
the human suffering that they reflect.
Therefore, it is laudable for SIDO to
sponsor a fast in which we, the
privileged, suffer hunger for a day like

the underprivileged and contribute
some money to assist them.
In actuality, the all-campus fast was
not even tangentially related to the
alleviation of world hunger. The money
to be raised is targeted for:
• Educational materials needed by
black South African teachers and
Salvadoran refugees;
• A day care center in Nicaragua;
and
• Materials needed for a sewing
cooperative in Managua, Nicaragua.
While education and economic devel
opment deserve to be supported, it
seems from the SIDO flier itself that
world hunger and adequate health care
are humanity's most immediate and
pressing problems.
How can SIDO focus so intently

upon the world hunger crisis in its
advertising and yet be so callous as to
turn its back on the issue in the ac
tual distribution of its fund raising?
The choice of Nicaraguans and black
South Africans as the recipients of the
funds reveals the true nature of the
fast. SIDO is not supporting hunger
alleviation, but rather a liberal political
agenda.
Why would books ever take priority
over food, except in the political arena?
SIDO should advertise the fast as
benefiting Central American and black
South African education and develop
ment. It is a discredit to the organiza
tion that it has so blatantly attempted
to misrepresent the true aims of its
fund-raising activity.
The universal appeal of banishing a

superpolitical nemesis, world hunger,
should not be used to lull students
into support of partisan political ac
tion.
Furthermore, SIDO should put its
money where its mouth is. If SIDO is
truly sensitive about world hunger,
then it should do more than just
sensationalize it.
It should be obvious to an organiza
tion as concerned about development
as SIDO that the needs and wants of
the hungry and the diseased take
precedence over those of the socially
and politically disenfranchised.
As before, the money raised from
the fast should ideally be given to
organizations like Ecumenical Hunger
and Oxfam America. Food first.
