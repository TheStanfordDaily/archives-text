# Martin should stay to teach at Stanford
## 
### 
I was quoted extensively in an April
14 article about the course, "Optimal
Health and Fitness."
I criticized the course on a number
of grounds, and was quoted as saying
that I thought the instructor, Dr. Jack
Martin, should be banned from teach
ing at Stanford in the future.
At the request of Provost James
Rosse, I have met with Dr. Martin to
discuss my objections to the course. I
am now convinced that I overstepped
the bounds of propriety in suggesting
that he be banned from future teach
ing at Stanford and I wish to retract
that statement.
I apologize for any embarrassment it
might have caused Dr. Martin or his
faculty sponsor, Dr. Ralph Paf
fenbarger.
I hasten to add that I stand behind

my other statements, criticizing various
aspects of the promotion and organiza
tion of the course.
