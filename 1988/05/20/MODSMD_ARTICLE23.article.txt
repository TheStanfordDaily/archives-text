# Reaganomics has hurt nation's needy
## 
### 
I said, as reported in The Daily's
May 17 coverage of the recent debate
about poverty, that something was
"like banging your head against the
wall." Unfortunately, the article never
mentioned what that something was. I
thought I'd clear things up.
Conservatives triumphantly claim
that the economy is strong, the
recovery is amazing and Reaganomics
is a smashing success. Actually, it's a
smashing failure.
Reaganomics helped plunge the eco
nomy into the worst recession since

the Great Depression. Now, as the
economy returned to moderate reces
sion, it looks much better.
If you bang your head against the
wall and stop, you feel much better â€”
even though you're still in bad shape.
Just so has our economy recovered.
What are the numbers? During
Reagan's seven completed years in
office, unemployment averaged 7.7
percent; during Carter's four years it
averaged 6.4 percent; in the late 1960s
it averaged 3.6 percent.
When Carter left office, people said,
correctly, that the economy was in bad
shape: unemployment was 7.0 percent.
Yet it took Reagan six years to return
to that level, and unemployment
reached 9.6 percent. Even now, unem
ployment remains at what, by histori
cal standards, is recessionary.
Maybe unemployment figures some
how conceal employment growth? Con
servatives trumpet an "amazing"
record of job creation. From 1980 to

March of 1988 (the last available fig
ure) the economy gained just under 15
million jobs.
If growth had continued at the
1976-80 rate, it would have gained
more: 19 million.
What about income? A recent Con
gressional Budget Office study con
cluded that the bottom 40 percent of
the population is poorer now than it
was 10 years ago; yet the income of
the top one percent has gone up 74
percent (real, after-tax income).
So remember: A rising tide lifts all
yachts.
What's the point? Reaganomics has
not produced growth; it has taken
from the poor and given to the rich.
Liberal economics would be kinder, but
the private economy and private
charity have never taken care of every
one. Only the government can do that.
