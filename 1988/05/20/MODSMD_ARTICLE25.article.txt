## Prop. 69 is deceiving 
### 
C C O IXTY " NINE? WELL, of course
I support 69. Love it. Don't we
k-Jall?"
Typical. Most of us registered to vote
in the June 7 primaries have our favorite
presidential and congressional candidates
all picked out. But we haven't figured
out how we'll vote on those many boring
state and local initiatives. The political
ads we see and hear don't clarify matters
much.
"Keep our jails safe!" screams one TV
spot. Here's a placard that promises to
"Stop AIDS Now!" and there's one telling
us to "Vote YES on Schools." Who can
argue with sentiments like these? All we
have to do is vote YES on proposition x
and NO on measure y. Simple?
No. Simplistic.
One initiative in particular, Proposition
69, has been gravely misrepresented. This
7s the one that promises to "Stop AIDS
Now."'
Hmmm. Say, wasn't there an AIDS
initiative back in 1986? Proposition 64,
I believe. The bill that would "quarantine
the queers," to hear the homophobes tell
it.
That proposition would have declared
AIDS a "highly contagious disease." It
would have required widespread, manda
tory AIDS testing; those testing positive
would be placed on a special list, fired
and quarantined.
Lyndon Laßouche's pet project.
We knew then, and know now, that
AIDS presents a very serious public
health crisis, no question about it. But
Proposition 64's disease-control meas
ures seemed extreme. The treatment was
even worse than the affliction.

Californians rejected Proposition 64, 72
percent to 28 percent. The Laßouchies
failed not only because theirs was a bad
bill but also because they used a hard
sell. They appealed to homophobia in a
largely tolerant state and lost. But they
learned their lesson.
And now, two years later, they've given
us Proposition 69. Oh, they've cleaned
up the homophobia that was so apparent
in the campaign for 64. Yes indeedy. Now
their campaign is ostensibly backed up
with hard data. Numbers. Statistics.
Medical evidence.
The kinda stuff no-good lib'ral seck
yaler hoomanist types can respect.
Example: The official, Laßouche
endorsed argument in favor of Proposi
tion 69 on file with the California
Secretary of State warns of "1 million
Californians infected with the AIDS virus
today." False. But wait, there's more.
"The number of 'unexplained' AIDS
cases — cases not in 'high risk' groups,
such as homosexuals and intravenous
drug users — continues to grow at alarm
ing rates." More fiction.
Now for the non-fiction.
Proposition 69 is nothing but a sac
charine makeover of 64. All the
provisions remain: the testing, the
quarantining, the blacklisting. Endorsed,
once again, by space cadet Laßouche.
Contrary to the implications of the
Laßouchies, the medical community does
not support Proposition 69. Laurens
White, president of the California Medical
Association, has in fact publicly con
demned the measure.
In a statement issued with the presi
dents of the California Nurses Associa

tion and the California Association of
Hospitals, White pointed out medical
proof that AIDS is not, in fact, "highly
contagious"; no one has ever contracted
AIDS through casual contact.
The good doctor's final diagnosis of
Proposition 69 is no better. "This type
of repressive and discriminatory action
.. . will not serve to limit the AIDS prob
lem, but rather could prolong the spread
of this terrible disease."
But wait, there's still more. Proposition
69 would cost citizens billions in extra
taxes for the testing and quarantining of
AIDS "carriers." And for every dollar
spent on this blacklisting, there'd be one
fewer dollar available to fund research
for a cure for the disease.
But the Laßouchies probably don't
mind. From their point of view, it may
well be cheaper to round up "carriers"
than to cure them. And hey, why worry
about curing AIDS victims at all when
you can round up all those homos and
dope fiends instead?
Don't be fooled by the facade of scien
tific reasoning that surrounds pro-69 ads.
Most real doctors are against 69, and
that's no lip service.
