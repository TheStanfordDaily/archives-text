## Dates, curfew, Sorority Row: Stanford 50 years ago 
### Theresa Klosterman 
What does $115 buy these days?
Dinner for two at Mac Arthur
Park, books for a class or two . . .
a silk dress? For Stanford stu
dents from the Class of 1938,
$115 paid for a whole quarter of
University housing.
Last weekend, over 300 gradu
ates and their spouses reminisced
about the good oF days on the
Farm at their 50th reunion.
The celebration included class
seminars, a dinner dance and an
induction into the Half Century
Club by Birge Clark, a 95-year-old
graduate of the Class of 1914. But
the alumni spent most of their
time reminiscing.
"You wouldn't imagine how
much things have changed," said
Matt Lebenbaum, one alumnus
attending the reunion. Life at
Stanford was a whole different
"ball game," alumnus Gene Gear
said.
Housing
While today male and female stu
dents often share the same resi
dence bathroom, 50 years ago men
and women did not even live on
the same side of campus. Back
then, freshman women lived in
Roble Hall and upperclass women
chose between Union Hall (now
Old Union), Lagunita Court —
then only a couple of years old
and certainly the most desirable
residence on campus — or the
housed sororities on the Row.
Men, on the other hand, lived
on the east side of campus, spend
ing freshman year in Encina Hall
and subsequent years in Toyon
Hall, Branner Hall, Sequoia Hall
(now the home of the Statistics
Department) or the fraternities.
Despite much interaction be
tween the nine sororities and 24
fraternities — 13 of which Eire no
longer housed on campus — some
students were anxious for more
integrated housing.
"I lived in the Fyi house . . .
that is, until we lost our national
charter because we wanted to go
coed," 1938 class member Nelson
Wheeler explained.

Lockout
But Stanford's "lockout policy"
attempted to keep the sexes sep
arate. Lockouts occurred at mid
night on the weekdays and 2:30
a.m. on the weekends in Roble,
Lagunita and other female resi
dences. Any woman returning
after that time was locked out of
her dorm and had to find another
f)lace to spend the evening. A few
ate passes were issued every term
to allow for later evenings.
The lockout policy "tried to sep
arate the sexes and protect our
virtue," joked one alumna.
Making the 2:30 a.m. weekend
curfew posed quite a challenge for
those students who wanted to live
it up in San Francisco in the
evenings. "Most nights we'd drive
in about 2:29 a.m.," Miriam
Weikel said.
"It was really tough to come
back from San Francisco. High
way 280 wasn't there at that time
and we had to drive a long way
on Bayshore. That can be freezing
in a rumble seat," she added.
Stylish dress
Fashion was yet another differ
ence between the '80s and the
'30s. Women never would have
considered wearing pants back
then, according to many class
members. Instead, women wore
long skirts and high heels to class.
The University did not allow
men to wear Levi's jeans. Tradi
tionally, freshman men could not
even wear corduroy pants. In
stead, they donned moleskin
pants, preferably left unwashed
for a whole quarter.
Romance
For most students in 1938, San
Francisco was the place to go for
a good time — and for romance.
Dinner at the "Blue Fox" — a
whopping $1.50 for a seven-course
meal — and dancing at the
"Palace Hotel" were some favor
ite spots.
The alumni reported that stu
dents did indeed date back then.
But since they were at the tail

end of the Depression, money was
scarce and not everyone could af
ford elaborate dates. "Some of us
had to settle for sitting in the
Quad," one alumnus said.
In addition to dating, many
alumni met their future spouses
at Stanford. Choice meeting spots
included chemistry class, blind
dates or, when worse came to
worse, UC-Berkeley's campus.
No booze
Drinking, as decreed by Jane
Stanford, was forbidden within
the three-mile limit around

campus. Compounded by the
recent repeal of Prohibition, alco
hol was generally tough to find.
Dinah's Shack and the Peanut
Farm were both popular beer
joints. But for alumnus Chuck
Nimmo, Beltramo's in Menlo
Park was the best place for drink
ing.
"It was one of those beer joints
with sawdust strewn on the floor
and that served ale, which was
terrible stuff," Nimmo said.
"We never drank more than a
quart at a time, individually, that
is," he said.
For the more sophisticated,

L'Omelette, located south of
campus on El Camino, was the
preferred drinking hole. Often
young men wishing to impress a
date would go to that hangout.
"Keep in mind that this was
just after the 500 limit on the
number of women enrolled had
been raised," one alumnus ex
plained. "With unequal numbers
of the sexes, competition was
pretty keen, especially if you
didn't have money."
Say hello
Alumni remembered their fel
low students as being very friend
ly. In fact, the "Hello Tradition"
was an unspoken law on the
Farm. Whenever two students
walked past each other on
campus, they would say "hello,"
alumni reported.
Pickups
Certain corners of the Quad
were designated "pickup corners."
People could wait for the first car
to pass and inevitably get a ride
into Palo Alto. Drivers who passed
the corner without offering a ride
were sure to get a bad reputation,
alumni recalled.
Matt Lebenbaum was one
alumnus who took advantage of
the pickup system. "Even the first
day I arrived off the train in Palo
Alto as a freshman, I was given
a ride into the campus. However,
my ride was from Herbert Hoover,
who gave me a long lecture on
the traditions of Stanford."
While the Frosh Book causes
today's Stanford students to
cringe at their photos, the '38
Bawl Out was an even more har
rowing experience. A campus pub
lication that came out every quar
ter, the Bawl Out listed students'
names, residences, majors and
grade-point averages.
"A lot of folks would use it to
see how intelligent their blind
date was," according to one class
member.
Although the Bawl Out caused
stress, academic pressure was not
nearly so intense a half century
ago. "The scholastic competition

was not nearly as great as today,"
a graduate reported. "Anyone
with a high school diploma and
money could get in. It was the
Depression, and money really
counted," he said.
Academia
Students simply took the Stan
ford Aptitude Test, which pre
dicted whether students could
complete the work. Afterward,
students were ranked and re
ceived their final acceptance let
ters in August.
Once they came to Stanford,
most students enjoyed their fresh
man Western Civilization class.
Structured much like the current
Western Culture program, stu
dents met every day and a differ
ent professor lectured each week.
"From what I remember, how
ever, there were no disputes
around the class like today," one
alumna said.
Course content was quite dif
ferent in '38 as well. For example,
engineering was a much different
field back then. "I never felt any
pressure as an engineer," Leben
baum said.
Sports
Although Big Game seems to
be a Stanford tradition that never
changes, the hoopla surrounding
Big Game was even more lively
in '38. According to many class
mates, the tradition was a much
more publicized, highly antici
pated affair. But the football team
performed about the same as it
does today. Big Game "was fun
two out of the four years I was
there — the ones we won," ac
cording to one alumnus.
For seven decades now, gradu
ate Michael Antonacci, age 85, has
cheered on Stanford at Big Game
with his wife who graduated from
UC-Berkeley.
"My wife went to Berkeley and
even though she will attend all
kinds of Stanford activities with
me, when it comes to Big Game
she becomes a completely differ
ent person," Antonacci said.
Some things never change.

Alumni remembered their fel
low students as being very friend
ly. In fact, the "Hello Tradition"
was an unspoken law on the
Farm. Whenever two students
walked past each other on
campus, they would say "hello,"
alumni reported.
Pickups
Certain corners of the Quad
were designated "pickup corners."
People could wait for the first car
to pass and inevitably get a ride
into Palo Alto. Drivers who passed
the corner without offering a ride
were sure to get a bad reputation,
alumni recalled.
Matt Lebenbaum was one
alumnus who took advantage of
the pickup system. "Even the first
day I arrived off the train in Palo
Alto as a freshman, I was given
a ride into the campus. However,
my ride was from Herbert Hoover,
who gave me a long lecture on
the traditions of Stanford."
While the Frosh Book causes
today's Stanford students to
cringe at their photos, the '38
Bawl Out was an even more har
rowing experience. A campus pub
lication that came out every quar
ter, the Bawl Out listed students'
names, residences, majors and
grade-point averages.
"A lot of folks would use it to
see how intelligent their blind
date was," according to one class
member.
Although the Bawl Out caused
stress, academic pressure was not
nearly so intense a half century
ago. "The scholastic competition

was not nearly as great as today,"
a graduate reported. "Anyone
with a high school diploma and
money could get in. It was the
Depression, and money really
counted," he said.
Academia
Students simply took the Stan
ford Aptitude Test, which pre
dicted whether students could
complete the work. Afterward,
students were ranked and re
ceived their final acceptance let
ters in August.
Once they came to Stanford,
most students enjoyed their fresh
man Western Civilization class.
Structured much like the current
Western Culture program, stu
dents met every day and a differ
ent professor lectured each week.
"From what I remember, how
ever, there were no disputes
around the class like today," one
alumna said.
Course content was quite dif
ferent in '38 as well. For example,
engineering was a much different
field back then. "I never felt any
pressure as an engineer," Leben
baum said.
Sports
Although Big Game seems to
be a Stanford tradition that never
changes, the hoopla surrounding
Big Game was even more lively
in '38. According to many class
mates, the tradition was a much
more publicized, highly antici
pated affair. But the football team
performed about the same as it
does today. Big Game "was fun
two out of the four years I was
there — the ones we won," ac
cording to one alumnus.
For seven decades now, gradu
ate Michael Antonacci, age 85, has
cheered on Stanford at Big Game
with his wife who graduated from
UC-Berkeley.
"My wife went to Berkeley and
even though she will attend all
kinds of Stanford activities with
me, when it comes to Big Game
she becomes a completely differ

Some things never change.


April Pearson — Dally
John Barron, a 1938 Stanford graduate, feasts at his 50-year Stanford
reunion last week.
What does $115 buy these days?
Dinner for two at Mac Arthur
Park, books for a class or two . . .
a silk dress? For Stanford stu
dents from the Class of 1938,
$115 paid for a whole quarter of
University housing.
Last weekend, over 300 gradu
ates and their spouses reminisced
about the good oF days on the
Farm at their 50th reunion.
The celebration included class
seminars, a dinner dance and an
induction into the Half Century
Club by Birge Clark, a 95-year-old
graduate of the Class of 1914. But
the alumni spent most of their
time reminiscing.
"You wouldn't imagine how
much things have changed," said
Matt Lebenbaum, one alumnus
attending the reunion. Life at
Stanford was a whole different
"ball game," alumnus Gene Gear
said.
Housing
While today male and female stu
dents often share the same resi
dence bathroom, 50 years ago men
and women did not even live on
the same side of campus. Back
then, freshman women lived in
Roble Hall and upperclass women
chose between Union Hall (now
Old Union), Lagunita Court —
then only a couple of years old
and certainly the most desirable
residence on campus — or the
housed sororities on the Row.
Men, on the other hand, lived
on the east side of campus, spend
ing freshman year in Encina Hall
and subsequent years in Toyon
Hall, Branner Hall, Sequoia Hall
(now the home of the Statistics
Department) or the fraternities.
Despite much interaction be
tween the nine sororities and 24
fraternities — 13 of which Eire no
longer housed on campus — some
students were anxious for more
integrated housing.
"I lived in the Fyi house . . .
that is, until we lost our national
charter because we wanted to go
coed," 1938 class member Nelson
Wheeler explained.

Lockout
But Stanford's "lockout policy"
attempted to keep the sexes sep
arate. Lockouts occurred at mid
night on the weekdays and 2:30
a.m. on the weekends in Roble,
Lagunita and other female resi
dences. Any woman returning
after that time was locked out of
her dorm and had to find another
f)lace to spend the evening. A few
ate passes were issued every term
to allow for later evenings.
The lockout policy "tried to sep
arate the sexes and protect our
virtue," joked one alumna.
Making the 2:30 a.m. weekend
curfew posed quite a challenge for
those students who wanted to live
it up in San Francisco in the
evenings. "Most nights we'd drive
in about 2:29 a.m.," Miriam
Weikel said.
"It was really tough to come
back from San Francisco. High
way 280 wasn't there at that time
and we had to drive a long way
on Bayshore. That can be freezing
in a rumble seat," she added.
Stylish dress
Fashion was yet another differ
ence between the '80s and the
'30s. Women never would have
considered wearing pants back
then, according to many class
members. Instead, women wore
long skirts and high heels to class.
The University did not allow
men to wear Levi's jeans. Tradi
tionally, freshman men could not
even wear corduroy pants. In
stead, they donned moleskin
pants, preferably left unwashed
for a whole quarter.
Romance
For most students in 1938, San
Francisco was the place to go for
a good time — and for romance.
Dinner at the "Blue Fox" — a
whopping $1.50 for a seven-course
meal — and dancing at the
"Palace Hotel" were some favor
ite spots.
The alumni reported that stu
dents did indeed date back then.
But since they were at the tail

end of the Depression, money was
scarce and not everyone could af
ford elaborate dates. "Some of us
had to settle for sitting in the
Quad," one alumnus said.
In addition to dating, many
alumni met their future spouses
at Stanford. Choice meeting spots
included chemistry class, blind
dates or, when worse came to
worse, UC-Berkeley's campus.
No booze
Drinking, as decreed by Jane
Stanford, was forbidden within
the three-mile limit around

campus. Compounded by the
recent repeal of Prohibition, alco
hol was generally tough to find.
Dinah's Shack and the Peanut
Farm were both popular beer
joints. But for alumnus Chuck
Nimmo, Beltramo's in Menlo
Park was the best place for drink
ing.
"It was one of those beer joints
with sawdust strewn on the floor
and that served ale, which was
terrible stuff," Nimmo said.
"We never drank more than a
quart at a time, individually, that
is," he said.
For the more sophisticated,

L'Omelette, located south of
campus on El Camino, was the
preferred drinking hole. Often
young men wishing to impress a
date would go to that hangout.
"Keep in mind that this was
just after the 500 limit on the
number of women enrolled had
been raised," one alumnus ex
plained. "With unequal numbers
of the sexes, competition was
pretty keen, especially if you
didn't have money."
Say hello
Alumni remembered their fel
low students as being very friend
ly. In fact, the "Hello Tradition"
was an unspoken law on the
Farm. Whenever two students
walked past each other on
campus, they would say "hello,"
alumni reported.
