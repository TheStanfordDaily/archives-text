## CINEMA SCOPE 
### 
"The Moderns"
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
"The Moderns," a slow moving,
pretentiously different film, at
tempts a bold attack upon the
romantic, mythical status of the
Parisian "Lost Generation" of the
19205. Ernest Hemingway,
Gertrude Stein and the milieu of
modern art culture serve as a
backdrop for a rather simplistic
tale of love, art and the never
ending pursuit of what's new.
From the opening scene with
protagonist artist Nick Hart
(Keith Carradine) drawing carica
tures in a cafe crowded with
Parisian culture, it is obvious that
the film will be concerned with
the world of image. Each charac
ter is nothing more than a fluffed
out version of one of Nick's car
toons.
Gertrude Stein is the egocentric
queen bee, passing out social suc
cess or banishment with a wave
of her bulky arm. Hemingway is
drawn as a drunken, whining dolt,
spouting clich6d euphemisms, and
his omnipresence makes him into
a symbol for all of his generation.
At first, such blatant carica
tures are humorous, poking fun
at the demi-god status given the
expatriates, but soon the coarse,
simplistic nature of the depictions
becomes aggravating. One begins
to wonder if such a shallow char
acter is truly supposed to be the
same Hemingway whose bold,
original writing has influenced so
much of modern fiction. The sad
dest part of these portrayals is
that, despite their annoying shal
lowness, they are much more in
teresting than the main charac
ters and storyline of the film.
Nick is the struggling artist
forced to compromise his integrity
by copying several valuable paint
ings. Things become complicated
when his long-lost wife Rachel
(Linda Fiorentino) shows up on
the arm of prophylactic tycoon
Stone (John Lone), a ruthless
manipulator determined to buy
his way into Parisian high culture
by collecting modern art.
The inevitable battle between
Nick and Stone symbolizes the
collapse of the Parisian paradise
as art, love, money and culture
become an indistinguishable, un
savory mess. At the end of the
film, as the crowd begins its ex
odus to the "more modern" world
of Hollywood, poor Hemingway is

left to write the eulogy.
"Paris is a portable picnic," he
says while wandering through the
bustling train station. "No, Paris
is a meal you can take with you."
These lines are typical of "The
Moderns" satirical humor, de
pending almost entirely on insipid
depictions of the modern mythical
heroes of this time period.
The film cannot be said to be
uninteresting, however. Despite a
script that operates almost en
tirely through dialogue, director
Alan Rudolph has included an
ample amount of visually intrigu
ing material. The mood of Paris
in 1920 is created through a mix
ture of old footage and manipu
lation of color. Scenes fade from
black-and-white to a muted
golden color, then back to black
and-white in a somewhat effective
manner.
Many scenes utilize an almost
surrealistic expressionism to en
hance their impact; corpses rise
unseen from graves, cubist paint
ings serve as views from windows,
and the 1920s "artsy" crowd fades
into a vision of the "modern"
punks of today.
These scenes have their appeal,
but seem very much out of place
in the quasi-realistic style
employed throughout most of the
film. Just as the culture it
criticizes, "The Modems" seems
too contrived and affected. It
wants to be seen as something it
is not: an insightful, innovative
and interesting film.

"Midnight Crossing"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at U.S. 101
Mountain View
In "Midnight Crossing," two ap
parently happy couples sail off the
coast of southern Florida together
in a small boat. But what begins
as a pleasure cruise ends in a
bloodbath — these characters
have secret motives, violent plans.
There's a mysterious treasure
they all want, buried on an island
near Cuba, and the movie is all
about the scrambling, killing and
double-crossing that's necessary
to get it.
The first half of this movie is
good: elegant and funny. The cou
ples appear sane and civilized as
they sit and plan their trip, and
they drink champagne, sunbathe,
make love on the first days out
on the little boat. The tension is
building nicely.

But suddenly, too quickly, the
veneer cracks, and all that beau
tiful tension beneath the surface
is lost. The film disintegrates into
a violent, hysterical thriller. Every
three minutes someone is
stabbed, someone is bashed in the
head, someone is knocked off the
boat, lightning cracks through the
sky, the wind tosses the flimsy
sailboat a few more times. It's
overwrought, brutal and dizzying.
There are great actors here,
breathing life into this messy,
gasping movie. Faye Dunaway
stars as a blind woman, and she's
wonderful, groping her way
around on the blood-smeared
boat, her eyes fogged with
glaucoma. Daniel Travanti, un
recognizable from his good-guy
days on "Hill Street Blues", plays
her treacherous husband.
The other actors are all excel
lent, and the script is actually
well-written, clever. This movie
almost makes it. But it misses,
by those crucial few inches.

"Shakedown"
Century Cimena 10
Stierlin Road at U.S. 101
Mountain View
"Shakedown" is one of the best
cop movies playing. It is a little
thin on plot and is a little in
credulous, but what the heck.
Roland Dalton (Peter Weller) is
a public defender whose last case
is a drug-dealing cop killer. Dalton
is off to the good life of a law

firm in a week when his client
throws a monkey wrench into
things.
The drug dealer claims that the
cop was trying to kill him, and
killing the cop was just self
defense. Of course this sets off a
series of events that expose a ring
of bad cops. What else is new.
Officer Marks (Sam Elliot) is a
good honest cop who shoots
criminals and lives in a movie
theater. Marks is Dalton's eyes
into the world of the corrupt cop.
Weller shows a more human
side in this movie then his last.
But he keeps that hard edge, abil
ity to shoot fast, and the unerring
loyalty to truth and justice that
made "Robocop" a human interest
movie.
Elliot's character looks just like
the scum of the streets. He's an
undercover cop who never seems
to come off of plainclothes duty
or report to a superior officer, but
he has sterling loyalties. Good is
good (and bad is bad) no matter
how close he works with the bad
and no matter how rich they are
getting.
And the bad guys in this movie
are bad. They shoot innocent
bystanders because they get too
close, they bribe and murder each
other, they sell drugs for sex. If
it's immoral, they'll do it.
In the end truth and justice
triumph, the world is a better
place, the good guys are that
much more cynical, and there are
about a dozen minor plot compli
cations left hanging. So what.

"White Mischief'
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
"White Mischief' is a terrific,
bizarre movie, but let there be no
mistake: It isn't for everyone.
Like anchovies or avocados, you'll
either like it or you won't, and
it's not a question of this being
good or bad movie making.
"White Mischief' is distinctive
and well-made, but it offers ab
solutely no uplift — there's no
window into a world any better
than the narrow, stifling one
depicted here. Though the action
is set in Kenya on the vast sunlit
plains, the feeling is airless and
oppressive, and it's just this that
makes the movie excellent — and
unpleasant.
The story is based on fact,
though it's been dressed up a little
bit for drama. Diana (Greta Scac
chi), a beautiful young English
woman, marries Jock Broughton
(Joss Ackland) a much older man,
and she marries him unabashedly
for his money.
He brings her to Kenya to live,
and immediately (predictably!)
she begins an affair with Joss
(Charles Dance), the central fig
ure in a local crowd of hedonists.
(The antics of this crowd are
shocking: They rotate sex part
ners nightly, they shoot up drugs,
they hold creepy, debauched par
ties.)
Diana prepares to leave her
husband for Joss, which dis

tresses Joss' many lady friends
— who want to keep him as a
playmate — and devastates
Diana's pathetic old husband, who
wants to keep Diana and hold on
to a few shreds of his pride. One
night on a dark road, Joss is shot
to death. The question is: Who
did it?
The mystery isn't very compel
ling — this movie almost puts
you to sleep during the courtroom
scenes. But it's a wonderful pic
ture of life among the bored and
wealthy.
Sarah Miles, as one of Joss's
ex-lovers, is fantastically weird.
"You wouldn't happen to have,
by any chance, a chocolate covered
lobster?" she randomly asks a ser
vant at one party. (She does other
more disgusting and unforgetta
ble things that cannot be de
scribed here.)
What makes this movie difficult
to enjoy is that there's no way
out of this narrow, gorgeous and
horrifying world. The one char
acter who looks like he might be
uncorrupted — a grubby, re
clusive rancher (John Hurt) —
ends up to be just as limited as
everyone else.
If nothing else, "White Mis
chief" is a treat for the eyes, full
of great little scenes, beautifully
shot and quite strange. This isn't
a happy movie, and it isn't a per
fect movie, but it's weird and
fabulous enough that it should
interest you, even if you hate it.

"The Moderns"
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
"The Moderns," a slow moving,
pretentiously different film, at
tempts a bold attack upon the
romantic, mythical status of the
Parisian "Lost Generation" of the
19205. Ernest Hemingway,
Gertrude Stein and the milieu of
modern art culture serve as a
backdrop for a rather simplistic
tale of love, art and the never
ending pursuit of what's new.
From the opening scene with
protagonist artist Nick Hart
(Keith Carradine) drawing carica
tures in a cafe crowded with
Parisian culture, it is obvious that
the film will be concerned with
the world of image. Each charac
ter is nothing more than a fluffed
out version of one of Nick's car
toons.
Gertrude Stein is the egocentric
queen bee, passing out social suc
cess or banishment with a wave
of her bulky arm. Hemingway is
drawn as a drunken, whining dolt,
spouting clich6d euphemisms, and
his omnipresence makes him into
a symbol for all of his generation.
At first, such blatant carica
tures are humorous, poking fun
at the demi-god status given the
expatriates, but soon the coarse,
simplistic nature of the depictions
becomes aggravating. One begins
to wonder if such a shallow char
acter is truly supposed to be the
same Hemingway whose bold,
original writing has influenced so
much of modern fiction. The sad
dest part of these portrayals is
that, despite their annoying shal
lowness, they are much more in
teresting than the main charac
ters and storyline of the film.
Nick is the struggling artist
forced to compromise his integrity
by copying several valuable paint
ings. Things become complicated
when his long-lost wife Rachel
(Linda Fiorentino) shows up on
the arm of prophylactic tycoon
Stone (John Lone), a ruthless
manipulator determined to buy
his way into Parisian high culture
by collecting modern art.
The inevitable battle between
Nick and Stone symbolizes the
collapse of the Parisian paradise
as art, love, money and culture
become an indistinguishable, un
savory mess. At the end of the
film, as the crowd begins its ex
odus to the "more modern" world
of Hollywood, poor Hemingway is

left to write the eulogy.
"Paris is a portable picnic," he
says while wandering through the
bustling train station. "No, Paris
is a meal you can take with you."
These lines are typical of "The
Moderns" satirical humor, de
pending almost entirely on insipid
depictions of the modern mythical
heroes of this time period.
The film cannot be said to be
uninteresting, however. Despite a
script that operates almost en
tirely through dialogue, director
Alan Rudolph has included an
ample amount of visually intrigu
ing material. The mood of Paris
in 1920 is created through a mix
ture of old footage and manipu
lation of color. Scenes fade from
black-and-white to a muted
golden color, then back to black
and-white in a somewhat effective
manner.
Many scenes utilize an almost
surrealistic expressionism to en
hance their impact; corpses rise
unseen from graves, cubist paint
ings serve as views from windows,
and the 1920s "artsy" crowd fades
into a vision of the "modern"
punks of today.
These scenes have their appeal,
but seem very much out of place
in the quasi-realistic style
employed throughout most of the
film. Just as the culture it
criticizes, "The Modems" seems
too contrived and affected. It
wants to be seen as something it
is not: an insightful, innovative
and interesting film.

"Midnight Crossing"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at U.S. 101
Mountain View
In "Midnight Crossing," two ap
parently happy couples sail off the
coast of southern Florida together
in a small boat. But what begins
as a pleasure cruise ends in a
bloodbath — these characters
have secret motives, violent plans.
There's a mysterious treasure
they all want, buried on an island
near Cuba, and the movie is all
about the scrambling, killing and
double-crossing that's necessary
to get it.
The first half of this movie is
good: elegant and funny. The cou
ples appear sane and civilized as
they sit and plan their trip, and
they drink champagne, sunbathe,
make love on the first days out
on the little boat. The tension is
building nicely.

But suddenly, too quickly, the
veneer cracks, and all that beau
tiful tension beneath the surface
is lost. The film disintegrates into
a violent, hysterical thriller. Every
three minutes someone is
stabbed, someone is bashed in the
head, someone is knocked off the
boat, lightning cracks through the
sky, the wind tosses the flimsy
sailboat a few more times. It's
overwrought, brutal and dizzying.
There are great actors here,
breathing life into this messy,
gasping movie. Faye Dunaway
stars as a blind woman, and she's
wonderful, groping her way
around on the blood-smeared
boat, her eyes fogged with
glaucoma. Daniel Travanti, un
recognizable from his good-guy
days on "Hill Street Blues", plays
her treacherous husband.
The other actors are all excel
lent, and the script is actually
well-written, clever. This movie
almost makes it. But it misses,
by those crucial few inches.

"Shakedown"
Century Cimena 10
Stierlin Road at U.S. 101
Mountain View
"Shakedown" is one of the best
cop movies playing. It is a little
thin on plot and is a little in
credulous, but what the heck.
Roland Dalton (Peter Weller) is
a public defender whose last case
is a drug-dealing cop killer. Dalton
is off to the good life of a law

firm in a week when his client
throws a monkey wrench into
things.
The drug dealer claims that the
cop was trying to kill him, and
killing the cop was just self
defense. Of course this sets off a
series of events that expose a ring
of bad cops. What else is new.
Officer Marks (Sam Elliot) is a
good honest cop who shoots
criminals and lives in a movie
theater. Marks is Dalton's eyes
into the world of the corrupt cop.
Weller shows a more human
side in this movie then his last.
But he keeps that hard edge, abil
ity to shoot fast, and the unerring
loyalty to truth and justice that
made "Robocop" a human interest
movie.
Elliot's character looks just like
the scum of the streets. He's an
undercover cop who never seems
to come off of plainclothes duty
or report to a superior officer, but
he has sterling loyalties. Good is
good (and bad is bad) no matter
how close he works with the bad
and no matter how rich they are
getting.
And the bad guys in this movie
are bad. They shoot innocent
bystanders because they get too
close, they bribe and murder each
other, they sell drugs for sex. If
it's immoral, they'll do it.
In the end truth and justice
triumph, the world is a better
place, the good guys are that
much more cynical, and there are
about a dozen minor plot compli
cations left hanging. So what.

"White Mischief'
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
"White Mischief' is a terrific,
bizarre movie, but let there be no
mistake: It isn't for everyone.
Like anchovies or avocados, you'll
either like it or you won't, and
it's not a question of this being
good or bad movie making.
"White Mischief' is distinctive
and well-made, but it offers ab
solutely no uplift — there's no
window into a world any better
than the narrow, stifling one
depicted here. Though the action
is set in Kenya on the vast sunlit
plains, the feeling is airless and
oppressive, and it's just this that
makes the movie excellent — and
unpleasant.
The story is based on fact,
though it's been dressed up a little
bit for drama. Diana (Greta Scac
chi), a beautiful young English
woman, marries Jock Broughton
(Joss Ackland) a much older man,
and she marries him unabashedly
for his money.
He brings her to Kenya to live,
and immediately (predictably!)
she begins an affair with Joss
(Charles Dance), the central fig
ure in a local crowd of hedonists.
(The antics of this crowd are
shocking: They rotate sex part
ners nightly, they shoot up drugs,
they hold creepy, debauched par
ties.)
Diana prepares to leave her
husband for Joss, which dis

tresses Joss' many lady friends
— who want to keep him as a
playmate — and devastates
Diana's pathetic old husband, who
wants to keep Diana and hold on
to a few shreds of his pride. One
night on a dark road, Joss is shot
to death. The question is: Who
did it?
The mystery isn't very compel
ling — this movie almost puts
you to sleep during the courtroom
scenes. But it's a wonderful pic
ture of life among the bored and
wealthy.
Sarah Miles, as one of Joss's
ex-lovers, is fantastically weird.
"You wouldn't happen to have,
by any chance, a chocolate covered
lobster?" she randomly asks a ser
vant at one party. (She does other
more disgusting and unforgetta
ble things that cannot be de
scribed here.)
What makes this movie difficult
to enjoy is that there's no way
out of this narrow, gorgeous and
horrifying world. The one char
acter who looks like he might be
uncorrupted — a grubby, re
clusive rancher (John Hurt) —
ends up to be just as limited as
everyone else.
If nothing else, "White Mis
chief" is a treat for the eyes, full
of great little scenes, beautifully
shot and quite strange. This isn't
a happy movie, and it isn't a per
fect movie, but it's weird and

scenes. But it's a wonderful pic
ture of life among the bored and
wealthy.
Sarah Miles, as one of Joss's
ex-lovers, is fantastically weird.
"You wouldn't happen to have,
by any chance, a chocolate covered
lobster?" she randomly asks a ser
vant at one party. (She does other
more disgusting and unforgetta
ble things that cannot be de

What makes this movie difficult
to enjoy is that there's no way
out of this narrow, gorgeous and
horrifying world. The one char
acter who looks like he might be
uncorrupted — a grubby, re
clusive rancher (John Hurt) —
ends up to be just as limited as
everyone else.
If nothing else, "White Mis
chief" is a treat for the eyes, full
of great little scenes, beautifully
shot and quite strange. This isn't
a happy movie, and it isn't a per
fect movie, but it's weird and
fabulous enough that it should
interest you, even if you hate it.

"The Moderns"
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
"The Moderns," a slow moving,
pretentiously different film, at
tempts a bold attack upon the
romantic, mythical status of the
Parisian "Lost Generation" of the
19205. Ernest Hemingway,
Gertrude Stein and the milieu of
modern art culture serve as a
backdrop for a rather simplistic
tale of love, art and the never
ending pursuit of what's new.
From the opening scene with
protagonist artist Nick Hart
(Keith Carradine) drawing carica
tures in a cafe crowded with
Parisian culture, it is obvious that
the film will be concerned with
the world of image. Each charac
ter is nothing more than a fluffed
out version of one of Nick's car
toons.
Gertrude Stein is the egocentric
queen bee, passing out social suc
cess or banishment with a wave
of her bulky arm. Hemingway is
drawn as a drunken, whining dolt,
spouting clich6d euphemisms, and
his omnipresence makes him into
a symbol for all of his generation.
At first, such blatant carica
tures are humorous, poking fun
at the demi-god status given the
expatriates, but soon the coarse,
simplistic nature of the depictions
becomes aggravating. One begins
to wonder if such a shallow char
acter is truly supposed to be the
same Hemingway whose bold,
original writing has influenced so
much of modern fiction. The sad
dest part of these portrayals is
that, despite their annoying shal
lowness, they are much more in
teresting than the main charac
ters and storyline of the film.
Nick is the struggling artist
forced to compromise his integrity
by copying several valuable paint
ings. Things become complicated
when his long-lost wife Rachel
(Linda Fiorentino) shows up on
the arm of prophylactic tycoon
Stone (John Lone), a ruthless
manipulator determined to buy
his way into Parisian high culture
by collecting modern art.
The inevitable battle between
Nick and Stone symbolizes the
collapse of the Parisian paradise
as art, love, money and culture
become an indistinguishable, un
savory mess. At the end of the
film, as the crowd begins its ex
odus to the "more modern" world
of Hollywood, poor Hemingway is

left to write the eulogy.
"Paris is a portable picnic," he
says while wandering through the
bustling train station. "No, Paris
is a meal you can take with you."
These lines are typical of "The
Moderns" satirical humor, de
pending almost entirely on insipid
depictions of the modern mythical
heroes of this time period.
The film cannot be said to be
uninteresting, however. Despite a
script that operates almost en
tirely through dialogue, director
Alan Rudolph has included an
ample amount of visually intrigu
ing material. The mood of Paris
in 1920 is created through a mix
ture of old footage and manipu
lation of color. Scenes fade from
black-and-white to a muted
golden color, then back to black
and-white in a somewhat effective
manner.
Many scenes utilize an almost
surrealistic expressionism to en
hance their impact; corpses rise
unseen from graves, cubist paint
ings serve as views from windows,
and the 1920s "artsy" crowd fades
into a vision of the "modern"
punks of today.
These scenes have their appeal,
but seem very much out of place
in the quasi-realistic style
employed throughout most of the
film. Just as the culture it
criticizes, "The Modems" seems
too contrived and affected. It
wants to be seen as something it
is not: an insightful, innovative
and interesting film.

"Midnight Crossing"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Road at U.S. 101
Mountain View
In "Midnight Crossing," two ap
parently happy couples sail off the
coast of southern Florida together
in a small boat. But what begins
as a pleasure cruise ends in a
bloodbath — these characters
have secret motives, violent plans.
There's a mysterious treasure
they all want, buried on an island
near Cuba, and the movie is all
about the scrambling, killing and
double-crossing that's necessary
to get it.
The first half of this movie is
good: elegant and funny. The cou
ples appear sane and civilized as
they sit and plan their trip, and
they drink champagne, sunbathe,
make love on the first days out
on the little boat. The tension is
building nicely.

But suddenly, too quickly, the
veneer cracks, and all that beau
tiful tension beneath the surface
is lost. The film disintegrates into
a violent, hysterical thriller. Every
three minutes someone is
stabbed, someone is bashed in the
head, someone is knocked off the
boat, lightning cracks through the
sky, the wind tosses the flimsy
sailboat a few more times. It's
overwrought, brutal and dizzying.
There are great actors here,
breathing life into this messy,
gasping movie. Faye Dunaway
stars as a blind woman, and she's
wonderful, groping her way
around on the blood-smeared
boat, her eyes fogged with
glaucoma. Daniel Travanti, un
recognizable from his good-guy
days on "Hill Street Blues", plays
her treacherous husband.
The other actors are all excel
lent, and the script is actually
well-written, clever. This movie
almost makes it. But it misses,
by those crucial few inches.

"Shakedown"
Century Cimena 10
Stierlin Road at U.S. 101
Mountain View
"Shakedown" is one of the best
cop movies playing. It is a little
thin on plot and is a little in
credulous, but what the heck.
Roland Dalton (Peter Weller) is
a public defender whose last case
is a drug-dealing cop killer. Dalton
is off to the good life of a law

firm in a week when his client
throws a monkey wrench into
things.
The drug dealer claims that the
cop was trying to kill him, and
killing the cop was just self
defense. Of course this sets off a
series of events that expose a ring
of bad cops. What else is new.
Officer Marks (Sam Elliot) is a
good honest cop who shoots
criminals and lives in a movie
theater. Marks is Dalton's eyes
into the world of the corrupt cop.
Weller shows a more human
side in this movie then his last.
But he keeps that hard edge, abil
ity to shoot fast, and the unerring
loyalty to truth and justice that
made "Robocop" a human interest
movie.
Elliot's character looks just like
the scum of the streets. He's an
undercover cop who never seems
to come off of plainclothes duty
or report to a superior officer, but
he has sterling loyalties. Good is
good (and bad is bad) no matter
how close he works with the bad
and no matter how rich they are
getting.
And the bad guys in this movie
are bad. They shoot innocent
bystanders because they get too
close, they bribe and murder each
other, they sell drugs for sex. If
it's immoral, they'll do it.
In the end truth and justice
triumph, the world is a better
place, the good guys are that
much more cynical, and there are
about a dozen minor plot compli
cations left hanging. So what.

"White Mischief'
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson Ave.
Palo Alto
"White Mischief' is a terrific,
bizarre movie, but let there be no
mistake: It isn't for everyone.
Like anchovies or avocados, you'll
either like it or you won't, and
it's not a question of this being
good or bad movie making.
"White Mischief' is distinctive
and well-made, but it offers ab
solutely no uplift — there's no
window into a world any better
than the narrow, stifling one
depicted here. Though the action
is set in Kenya on the vast sunlit
plains, the feeling is airless and
oppressive, and it's just this that
makes the movie excellent — and
unpleasant.
The story is based on fact,
though it's been dressed up a little
bit for drama. Diana (Greta Scac
chi), a beautiful young English
woman, marries Jock Broughton
(Joss Ackland) a much older man,
and she marries him unabashedly
for his money.
He brings her to Kenya to live,
and immediately (predictably!)
she begins an affair with Joss
(Charles Dance), the central fig
ure in a local crowd of hedonists.
(The antics of this crowd are
shocking: They rotate sex part
ners nightly, they shoot up drugs,
they hold creepy, debauched par
ties.)
Diana prepares to leave her
husband for Joss, which dis

tresses Joss' many lady friends
— who want to keep him as a
playmate — and devastates
Diana's pathetic old husband, who
wants to keep Diana and hold on
to a few shreds of his pride. One
night on a dark road, Joss is shot
to death. The question is: Who
did it?
The mystery isn't very compel
ling — this movie almost puts
you to sleep during the courtroom
scenes. But it's a wonderful pic
ture of life among the bored and
wealthy.
Sarah Miles, as one of Joss's
ex-lovers, is fantastically weird.
"You wouldn't happen to have,
by any chance, a chocolate covered
lobster?" she randomly asks a ser
vant at one party. (She does other

ble things that cannot be de

out of this narrow, gorgeous and
horrifying world. The one char
acter who looks like he might be
uncorrupted — a grubby, re
clusive rancher (John Hurt) —

everyone else.
If nothing else, "White Mis
chief" is a treat for the eyes, full
of great little scenes, beautifully
shot and quite strange. This isn't
a happy movie, and it isn't a per
fect movie, but it's weird and
fabulous enough that it should
interest you, even if you hate it.
