# Committee begins two surveys on multi-racial relations
## 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
In an effort to evaluate the
quality of minority life here, the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues has begun two iarge
scale research projects to system
atically gather student opinions
about multi-racial relations at
Stanford.
The committee hired two out
side firms to administer a written
survey to undergraduates and to
conduct interviews with both
graduates and undergraduates.
The questions cover topics such
as dormitory life, curriculum, fac

ulty and staff interaction and per
sonal experiences.
For example, the survey asks
students to rate how much they
agree with statements such as
"the University provides too many
programs and other support ac
tivities for ethnic minority groups
on campus, considering their rela
tively small proportion of the stu
dent population" and"the best
way to have an impact on the
administration ia to make hard
demands and force the adminis
tration to react."
In addition, next Wednesday
the committee will release an in
terim report on their findings so

far in evaluating
minority life
here. UCMI
Chair A 1 Camaril
lo, associate pro
fessor of history,
said the commit
tee plans to
schedule a forum
to hear campus
reaction to this

report.
The final report will contain the
results of the two research proj
ects and will contain recommen
dations for University policy
changes. It will be released next
October or November after a sum
mer of work by committee mem

bers.
The committee was formed last
spring by University President
Donald Kennedy and Provost
James Rosse in response to de
mands by minority groups that
the University improve campus
minority life. The charge of the
committee is to "assess the insti
tutional environment of people of
color at Stanford" and to move
"further toward policies and prao
tices that implement the Univer
sity's commitment to a genuinely
pluralistic community."
According to Camarillo, the ex
ternal research is a "critical part"
of the committee's function and
is the first "significant commit

ment" any university in the coun
try has made to examine racial
relations in a college setting.
According to UCMI Vice-Chair
Faye McNair-Knox, assistant
dean of student affairs, the find
ings will help the committee iden
tify areas where changes in Uni
versity policy may be needed.
"Stanford has an impressive nu
merical diversity, but the goal is
to have pluralism," she said.
Stanford Research Institute In
ternational will conduct three sur
veys targeted at students, faculty
and staff with results available by
mid-summer. Camarillo said
1,700 undergraduates — 600
white students, 300 black stu

dents, 350 Hispanics, 47 Native
Americans, and 400 Asians — will
be mailed an extensive, 107-
question survey during the first
weeks of summer.
Minority students will receive
a different questionnaire than
other students.
On Monday, Pacific Manage
ment Systems, a minority-owned
San Francisco firm, began a series
of 200 personal and five to seven
group interviews to gather data.
The firm is still looking for indi
viduals to participate in the one
hour interviews, which involve
questions about academic and so
cial experiences with students,
faculty and staff.
