# Run away with the Pickle Family Circus
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The Pickle Family Circus is not
"The Greatest Show on Earth."
No, it's a lot less pretentious than
all that, and a lot more fun.
When the Pickle show touches
down at Stanford this weekend,
there will be no mirror balls, no
big top — and no lions, tigers or
bears. The Pickles present a no
frills, one-ring, open-air circus
that's a wild melange of acrobat
ics, tumbling, comedy, mime,
trapeze and the best juggling on
the West Coast, all performed to
the live accompaniment of a funky
five-piece jazz band.
The Pickle Family Circus is a
throwback to the traveling
vaudeville shows and one-ring cir
cuses that were popular in the
United States in the first half of
the 19th century. Working out of
an abandoned church in the
Potrero Hill district of San Fran
cisco, the Pickles barnstorm up

and down the West Coast each
spring and summer.
Their show lands at the Stan
ford intramural fields this week
end, with one performance today
at 3 p.m. and two shows tomorrow
and Sunday — at noon and 3 p.m.
both days. Advance tickets are $7
for adults, $4 for children under
12 and senior citizens; admission
at the gate is $8 and $5. For
information about advance tick
ets, call 853-3099.
The circus is a non-profit or
ganization; its shows are co
sponsored by various local non
profit agencies, which use the
circus as a fund raiser. The
performances at Stanford this
weekend are co-sponsored by The
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, Escondido Nursery
School and the Downtown Chil
dren's Center.
Founded in 1974 by Larry
Pisano (then a member of the San
Francisco Mime Troupe) and

Peggy Snider, the Pickles started
as a family of street performers
working on a tiny budget and have
evolved into a professional touring
ensemble operating on a still
comparatively-skimpy $700,000
annual budget. Last year the
circus put on 136 shows in places
as far-flung as Bend, Ore., and
London.
The Pickles remake their show
every year, and this year the show
takes a back-in-time theme, be
ginning in the 1980s and working
its way back to the turn of the
century.
The climax of the show is the
"Cafe des Artistes," a chaotic res
taurant scene, set in 1910, bring
ing in every member of the com
pany and ending with the
trademark "Big Juggle" — plates,
champagne bottles, parasols and
lamps fly.
As always, the Pickle show
revolves around its clowns, who
have more carefully drawn char

acters than clowns in ex
travaganzas like the Ringling
Brothers and Barnum & Bailey
Circus.
The Pickle clowns "are more
highly articulated," says Pickles
publicist Carol Pizzo. They are
actors as well as comedians, and
interact extensively with the au
dience.
But Pisano, the co-founder of
the group and its long-time
Lorenzo Pickle clown, left the
circus last year to tour in a solo
show called "Clown Dreams."
Pisano's departure ushers in a
new era for the 14-year-old circus.
The new artistic director of the
circus is a former member of the
troupe, Judy Finelli, who has
brought an increased emphasis on
theatricality and drama to the
Pickle shows.
Their show is a celebration of
human energy and imagination.
It's cozy and spontaneous, appeal
ing equally to children and adults.
