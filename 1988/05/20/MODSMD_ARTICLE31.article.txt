## No. 1 men's tennis ready to invade Athens Card senior McEnroe is top candidate for top sportsman 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
The Rafael Osuna Award, the most
prestigious men's collegiate tennis
honor, is presented annually to the
player best exemplifying competitive ex
cellence, sportsmanship and contribu
tions to the game.
Past Stanford winners include Pat
Dupre in 1976, Tim Mayotte in 1981,
and Jim Grabb in 1986. Dupre is a
former top-20 professional player,
Mayotte is currently in the top 10 and
Grabb in the top 75.
This season, senior captain Patrick
McEnroe has a lock on the award.
Rarely has a player prompted such
universal admiration from coaches, op
ponents, and teammates as has
McEnroe — a proven winner, composed
competitor, and student director of
Stanford's Volunteers For Youth pro
gram.

'Patrick is the kind of guy
you hope your own child
will grow up to be.'

"Patrick is exemplary of a student
athlete at Stanford," Stanford Athletic
Director Andy Geiger said. "He's a fine
student, sportsman, competitor, leader,
willing volunteer. He embodies every
thing in the context of the statement
we (Stanford athletics) try to make."
Patrick's easy-going personality on
and off the court is cool as a cucumber,
unlike the explosive on-court behavior
of his brother John, formerly the
world's No. 1 professional.
Instead of yelling obscenities when
he misses an easy volley, Patrick often
blurts "Sugar!" Rather than picking
fights with line judges, he quietly moves
on to the next point.
It's rare to see Patrick unprepared
— or lose his composure — during a
match. He's intensely competitive, yet
doesn't let bad calls, poor play, or a
whiny opponent affect his game.
"Everyone has something that they
have to worry about," McEnroe said.
"I try to go out and do the best I can
with what I have and see where it takes
me. I can't compare my game with my
brother's; no one can.
"You're representing not only your
self out there, but your friends, family,
school and teammates. That's some
thing that's lost out there sometimes."
The No. 13 U.S. junior entering Stan
ford, McEnroe has climbed from No. 6
to No. 1 on the singles ladder during
his stay on the Farm. As a freshman,
McEnroe started the season at No. 6,
but ended the year at No. 4 on a talented
team that included 1986 NCAA Singles

Champion Dan Goldie, Grabb, John
Letts and Derrick Rostagno.
In 1986, McEnroe played No. 3 and
won 20 straight matches at one point
during the season, helping Stanford to
its last NCAA team championship. Last
year, in an injury-plagued season, he
still bested USC's Luke Jensen to win
the Pacific 10 Conference singles cham
pionship. And this season, he is ranked
10th nationally and leads top-ranked
Stanford on the hunt for another na
tional title beginning tomorrow in Ath
ens, Ga.
"Patrick has done over four years
anything a coach could ask of a player,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "He
represents everything the college game
should stand for — he's probably the
most respected player in college tennis.
Patrick is the kind of guy you hope
your own child will grow up to be."
The lone senior on a young team,
McEnroe is a money player. His two
handed backhand is one of the most
feared weapons in college tennis. Come
crunch time, McEnroe will make just
the right shot, just where the ball
should go.
For example, against USC in Los An

geles this season with the match tied
4-4, McEnroe fended off two set points
with crisp returns of serve to team with
freshman Martin Blackman to key a
match-clinching 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 victory
over Scott Brownsberger and Murphy
Jensen. .
"Patrick's a great pressure player,"
teammate Jeff Tarango said. "He has
the respect from all his teammates in
tight situations; we all look up to him
because he knows how to win at the
NCAAs. In the clutch, we know he just
isn't going to lose."
For McEnroe, the challenges don't
end with NCAAs. Immediately after
graduation, McEnroe will take the Law
School Admissions Test.
Then he'll turn pro. Currently ranked
in the world's top 50 in doubles based
on winning the TransAmerica Open last
fall with Grabb, Patrick will play dou
bles at Wimbledon with John McEnroe's
former doubles partner, Peter Fleming.
As he embarks on further quests,
McEnroe leaves Stanford with the en
during respect of all who know him,
and the promise to join Dupre, Mayotte
and Grabb among the world's top
players.

"Patrick is exemplary of a student
athlete at Stanford," Stanford Athletic
Director Andy Geiger said. "He's a fine
student, sportsman, competitor, leader,
willing volunteer. He embodies every
thing in the context of the statement
we (Stanford athletics) try to make."
Patrick's easy-going personality on
and off the court is cool as a cucumber,
unlike the explosive on-court behavior
of his brother John, formerly the
world's No. 1 professional.
Instead of yelling obscenities when
he misses an easy volley, Patrick often
blurts "Sugar!" Rather than picking
fights with line judges, he quietly moves
on to the next point.
It's rare to see Patrick unprepared
— or lose his composure — during a
match. He's intensely competitive, yet
doesn't let bad calls, poor play, or a
whiny opponent affect his game.
"Everyone has something that they
have to worry about," McEnroe said.
"I try to go out and do the best I can
with what I have and see where it takes
me. I can't compare my game with my
brother's; no one can.
"You're representing not only your
self out there, but your friends, family,
school and teammates. That's some
thing that's lost out there sometimes."
The No. 13 U.S. junior entering Stan
ford, McEnroe has climbed from No. 6
to No. 1 on the singles ladder during
his stay on the Farm. As a freshman,
McEnroe started the season at No. 6,
but ended the year at No. 4 on a talented
team that included 1986 NCAA Singles

Champion Dan Goldie, Grabb, John
Letts and Derrick Rostagno.
In 1986, McEnroe played No. 3 and
won 20 straight matches at one point
during the season, helping Stanford to
its last NCAA team championship. Last
year, in an injury-plagued season, he
still bested USC's Luke Jensen to win
the Pacific 10 Conference singles cham
pionship. And this season, he is ranked
10th nationally and leads top-ranked
Stanford on the hunt for another na
tional title beginning tomorrow in Ath
ens, Ga.
"Patrick has done over four years
anything a coach could ask of a player,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said. "He
represents everything the college game
should stand for — he's probably the
most respected player in college tennis.
Patrick is the kind of guy you hope
your own child will grow up to be."
The lone senior on a young team,
McEnroe is a money player. His two
handed backhand is one of the most
feared weapons in college tennis. Come
crunch time, McEnroe will make just
the right shot, just where the ball
should go.
For example, against USC in Los An

geles this season with the match tied
4-4, McEnroe fended off two set points
with crisp returns of serve to team with
freshman Martin Blackman to key a
match-clinching 7-6 (10-8), 6-2 victory
over Scott Brownsberger and Murphy
Jensen. .
"Patrick's a great pressure player,"
teammate Jeff Tarango said. "He has
the respect from all his teammates in
tight situations; we all look up to him
because he knows how to win at the
NCAAs. In the clutch, we know he just
isn't going to lose."
For McEnroe, the challenges don't
end with NCAAs. Immediately after
graduation, McEnroe will take the Law
School Admissions Test.
Then he'll turn pro. Currently ranked
in the world's top 50 in doubles based
on winning the TransAmerica Open last
fall with Grabb, Patrick will play dou
bles at Wimbledon with John McEnroe's
former doubles partner, Peter Fleming.
As he embarks on further quests,
McEnroe leaves Stanford with the en
during respect of all who know him,
and the promise to join Dupre, Mayotte
and Grabb among the world's top
players.

Forehands like this from senior Patrick McEnroe have provided the Stanford
men's tennis team with quite a jolt over the last few years.
