After gutting through a 21-1
season despite injuries and
inconsistencies, the top
ranked Stanford's men's
tennis team enters the
104 th NCAA Tennis Cham
pionships in Athens, Ga.

today through Tuesday poised to shed its
nagging problems and play up to its ability
for the first time this year.
Stanford plays the winner of the Texas-
Brigham Young match tomorrow. The
quarterfinals are Sunday, semifinals Mon
day and finals Tuesday.

In singles play, Stanford has the most
talented lineup in the nation. The Cardinal
boasts three top-10 players: freshman Da

solid winners at No. 4 and No. 5 singles

NCAA singles championships beginning

Tarango are the nation's No. 3 pair,
McEnroe and Blackman are the Hobee's
Northern California Intercollegiate
runners-up and Cathrall and sophomore
Eric Peus have just one dual-match loss
at No. 3 doubles. The first two teams will
vie for the NCAA doubles title next week.

comes to doubles," Tarango said.
Stanford finished 10-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference. Both previous times the Car
dinal went undefeated in league play, in
1978 and 1983, the Cardinal captured the
NCAA title.
"We have a nice blend of youth and
experience," said Stanford's Dick Gould,
an eight-time NCAA championship coach.
"In my 22 years of coaching here, we have
as much the making of a championship
team as we've ever had here."
But, though the Cardinal has won 15

in February, injuries to Wheaton and in
