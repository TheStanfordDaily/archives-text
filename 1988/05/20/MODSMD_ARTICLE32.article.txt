# Netters open NCAA play Saturday

### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
After gutting through a 21-1
season despite injuries and
inconsistencies, the top
ranked Stanford's men's
tennis team enters the
104 th NCAA Tennis Cham
pionships in Athens, Ga.

today through Tuesday poised to shed its
nagging problems and play up to its ability
for the first time this year.
Stanford plays the winner of the Texas-
Brigham Young match tomorrow. The
quarterfinals are Sunday, semifinals Mon
day and finals Tuesday.
On paper, the Cardinal lineup is impos
ing.
In singles play, Stanford has the most
talented lineup in the nation. The Cardinal
boasts three top-10 players: freshman Da
vid Wheaton (No. 5), sophomore Jeff
Tarango (No. 6) and senior Patrick
McEnroe (No. 10).
In addition, freshman Martin Blackman
and sophomore Jeff Cathrall have been
solid winners at No. 4 and No. 5 singles
all season. Wheaton, Tarango, McEnroe
and Blackman will also compete in the
NCAA singles championships beginning

Wednesday.
The Cardinal also sends out three top
notch doubles tandems. Wheaton and
Tarango are the nation's No. 3 pair,
McEnroe and Blackman are the Hobee's
Northern California Intercollegiate
runners-up and Cathrall and sophomore
Eric Peus have just one dual-match loss
at No. 3 doubles. The first two teams will
vie for the NCAA doubles title next week.
"We're pretty much unbeatable when it
comes to doubles," Tarango said.
Stanford finished 10-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference. Both previous times the Car
dinal went undefeated in league play, in
1978 and 1983, the Cardinal captured the
NCAA title.
"We have a nice blend of youth and
experience," said Stanford's Dick Gould,
an eight-time NCAA championship coach.
"In my 22 years of coaching here, we have
as much the making of a championship
team as we've ever had here."
But, though the Cardinal has won 15
straight matches since its lone loss to USC
in February, injuries to Wheaton and in
consistent play from the No. 6 singles po
sition have left Stanford competing at less


than its best.
"Even though we've been win
ning, our team hasn't been
playing up to its potential for most
of the year," Wheaton said. "One
match some of us play well, the
next match others play well, but
we have yet to all play well in
the same match. But we have
been getting better with each
match."
Wheaton, the top U.S. junior
and No. 2 junior in the world,
injured his left wrist in December,
forcing him to miss singles play
until March.
After regaining much of his top
form and polishing off USC's
John Carras and UCLA's Brian
Garrow in straight sets, he in
jured himself again at the Pac-10
Championships April 21. This
time it was a less serious groin
pull.

Wheaton's injuries have left
Stanford's singles and doubles
lineup depleted for much of the
season.
At the No. 6 singles slot, fresh
man Glenn Solomon, sophomore
Barry Richards and junior Curtis
Dunn have each given it a go this
season, but no one has entrenched
himself as a starter.
But bolstered by three weeks
of practice without dual-match
play, Stanford is prepared to get
a healthy Wheaton back and plug
the hole in its lineup at the No.
6 position.
"We're all playing really well
right now," Tarango said. "We'll
win if everyone plays their best.
We're ready to go to Athens and
put out the 100-110 percent that's
necessary to win the NCAAs."
With Louisiana State, USC,
Pepperdine and defending na
tional champion Georgia clawing
toward the top, the Cardinal will
need to in order to cash in on
that promise.
However, the Cardinal got a

break with the pairings, only
drawing USC out of those four
teams in its half of the tourna
ment draw.
Georgia, 14-6, is the mystery
team. Buoyed by fanatical fan
support year in and year out at
the NCAAs, the Bulldogs are
tough to beat on their home turf.
Georgia has won two of the last
three titles and has a loaded
lineup this season, but injuries
have haunted them all year.
Currently, though, the lineup
— led by freshmen A 1 Parker and
Chris Garner and junior Stephen
Enochs — is at full strength.
Parker, the winner of more USTA
junior tournaments than any
player ever, is ranked eighth in
the nation.
Stanford appears ready for any
and all challenges, however.
"Our best tennis of the season
has been in the last month,"
Gould said. "We have taken gigan
tic steps. The NCAAs is a great
opportunity for us to go out and
prove we deserve to be No. 1."
