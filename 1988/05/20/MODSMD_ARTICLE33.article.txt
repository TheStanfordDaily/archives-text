# Track battles Pacific 10 foes and Murphy's Law
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
On paper, Stan
ford is a good bet
for a sixth-place
finish at the
Pacific 10 Confer
ence Champion
ships this week-

end, but the track and field team
has learned that what happens
on the track is what counts.
Last year the marks also pre
dicted that Stanford would be in
the middle of the Pac-10 pack,
but they fell victim to Murphy's
Law with a last-place finish for
the men and ninth place for the
women. The Cardinal should
make a definite improvement this
year, but until the dust clears no
one can say for certain how much
it will be.
Stanford has the footpower to
bounce back this year, with all
but one of last year's point win
ners returning with another year
of experience. Stanford has
several new threats, with fresh
men David Strang in the 800
meters and James Cram ton in the
400 meters. "There will be
surprises, both good and bad,"
predicted Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson.
UCLA, the top men's dual-meet
team in the country last year, has
a lock on both the men's and the
women's Pac-10 titles. Oregon
has the depth to take second, but
the spots after that will up for
grabs.
Stanford has its largest group
of Pac-10 qualifiers in the dis
tance events. The men have eight
entrants, lead by fifth-year senior

Marc Olesen. Olesen, the school
record-holder and clear favorite
in the 1,500 meters, may try to
run the 1,500 and the 5,000 back
to-back on Sunday. Senior room
mate Steve Schadler could run
either race, facing competition
from Matt Guisto of Arizona and
a strong Oregon team.
Strang has the second fastest
800-meter time in the conference
behind Ibrahim Okash of USC,
with Stanford senior Christian
Skoog also in the race. In a tactical
race, the race will likely go to the
runner with the best kick.
Sophomore Carol Gray will be
among the top women entrants.
Gray placed in both the 3,000 and
the 5,000 last year and will be
moving up to the 10,000 on Sat
urday. If she is rested, she will
also run the 5,000 on Sunday.
Another area of strength will
be the throwing events. Junior
Patty Purpur has the third-best
Pac-10 throw in the shot put and
eighth-best in the discus. She will
be facing stiff competition from
Washington in the shot and a
horde of top throwers in the dis
cus.
Glenn Schneider will also throw
the discus, with his main compe
tition coming from Jose DeSouza
of Oregon. The winner will be
"whoever throws consistently,"
Schneider predicted. A third-year
veteran, Schneider is looking for
ward to the opportunity to com
pete. "It's fun. I've spent all
season preparing for the champi
onship season"
Stanford will also be boasting
two school record holders in the
javelin. Senior Dave Pickett en
tered Stanford as a decathlete

and evolved into a 233-foot javelin
thrower. Junior Erica Wheeler
moved her school record up to
177-11 two weeks ago, and will
be competing primarily against
Shelly Sanford of Washington in
the women's field.
One area of uncertainty will be
the high jump. With the pressure
of jumping in the Pac-10 Cham
pionships, the win usually goes to
the athlete who responds best to
pressure. Senior Lisa Bernhagen,
who leaped 6-5 Vi last year, has
the most talent in the women's
high jump. She suffered a freak
injury that kept her out of the
Pac-10 and NCAA Championships
last year, but is looking for a Pac
-10 title this year.
Brian Marshall, also a senior,
will be jumping for the men Mar
shall set the meet record in 1986
at 7-4 Vi, and will fight to regain
his title. His 7-3 Vi season's best
is fourth in the conference, behind
leader Greg Jones of Washington.
Johnson is more concerned with
individual performers than over
all points. He did not want to
make early predictions, as "we
don't like to put pressure on the
athlete." Instead, success will
hinge on the performance of each
individual athlete.
Card notes
The Pac-10 Championships actu
ally began Monday with two events,
the heptathalon and the decathalon.
Junior D.D. Harris got the men's
team off" to a good start with a third
place finish in the decathalon, worth
six points. Multi-talented sophomore
Peggy Odita was fourth in the hep
tathalon for the women, putting four
points in the bank.

men David Strang in the 800
meters and James Cram ton in the
400 meters. "There will be
surprises, both good and bad,"
predicted Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson.
UCLA, the top men's dual-meet
team in the country last year, has
a lock on both the men's and the
women's Pac-10 titles. Oregon
has the depth to take second, but
the spots after that will up for
grabs.
Stanford has its largest group
of Pac-10 qualifiers in the dis
tance events. The men have eight
entrants, lead by fifth-year senior

Marc Olesen. Olesen, the school
record-holder and clear favorite
in the 1,500 meters, may try to
run the 1,500 and the 5,000 back
to-back on Sunday. Senior room
mate Steve Schadler could run
either race, facing competition
from Matt Guisto of Arizona and
a strong Oregon team.
Strang has the second fastest
800-meter time in the conference
behind Ibrahim Okash of USC,
with Stanford senior Christian
Skoog also in the race. In a tactical
race, the race will likely go to the
runner with the best kick.
Sophomore Carol Gray will be
among the top women entrants.
Gray placed in both the 3,000 and
the 5,000 last year and will be
moving up to the 10,000 on Sat
urday. If she is rested, she will
also run the 5,000 on Sunday.
Another area of strength will
be the throwing events. Junior
Patty Purpur has the third-best
Pac-10 throw in the shot put and
eighth-best in the discus. She will
be facing stiff competition from
Washington in the shot and a
horde of top throwers in the dis
cus.
Glenn Schneider will also throw
the discus, with his main compe
tition coming from Jose DeSouza
of Oregon. The winner will be
"whoever throws consistently,"
Schneider predicted. A third-year
veteran, Schneider is looking for
ward to the opportunity to com
pete. "It's fun. I've spent all
season preparing for the champi
onship season"
Stanford will also be boasting
two school record holders in the
javelin. Senior Dave Pickett en
tered Stanford as a decathlete

and evolved into a 233-foot javelin
thrower. Junior Erica Wheeler
moved her school record up to
177-11 two weeks ago, and will
be competing primarily against
Shelly Sanford of Washington in
the women's field.
One area of uncertainty will be
the high jump. With the pressure
of jumping in the Pac-10 Cham
pionships, the win usually goes to
the athlete who responds best to
pressure. Senior Lisa Bernhagen,
who leaped 6-5 Vi last year, has
the most talent in the women's
high jump. She suffered a freak
injury that kept her out of the
Pac-10 and NCAA Championships
last year, but is looking for a Pac
-10 title this year.
Brian Marshall, also a senior,
will be jumping for the men Mar
shall set the meet record in 1986
at 7-4 Vi, and will fight to regain
his title. His 7-3 Vi season's best
is fourth in the conference, behind
leader Greg Jones of Washington.
Johnson is more concerned with
individual performers than over
all points. He did not want to
make early predictions, as "we
don't like to put pressure on the
athlete." Instead, success will
hinge on the performance of each
individual athlete.
Card notes
The Pac-10 Championships actu
ally began Monday with two events,
the heptathalon and the decathalon.
Junior D.D. Harris got the men's
team off" to a good start with a third
place finish in the decathalon, worth
six points. Multi-talented sophomore
Peggy Odita was fourth in the hep
tathalon for the women, putting four
points in the bank.
