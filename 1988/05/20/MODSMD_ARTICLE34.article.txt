# Crew rows for Pac-10 title

Stanford, along with crews repre
senting some 30 schools, will make
the annual trek to Sacramento's
Lake Natoma for the West Coast's
premier rowing showdown — the
Pacific Coast Championships.
Washington, California and

UCLA have dominated the men's race since the
inception of the championships in 1960. This
year, however, Stanford's varsity men are among
the field's leaders and look to improve last year's
third-place finish.
The Pacific Coast Championships also doubles
as the Pacific-10 Conference Championships as
the top-placing Pac-10 school is deemed confer
ence champion. Stanford Men's Coach Ken
Dreyfuss, whose varsity is ranked second on the
West Coast, is enthusiastic about this weekend's
races.
"All of our boats have made steady, at times
startling, gains in both style and boat speed in

the last three weeks," Dreyfuss said. "The varsity
and junior varsity are both on the verge of the
best races of the season while the frosh and
novices are now set to move into the thick of
competition on the West Coast."
Dreyfuss has reason to be optimistic — his
varsity is coming off victories against Washington
and Cal, both perennially tough crews. However,
top-ranked UCLA, the defending Pac-10 cham
pion, is favored to win again this year. The only
loss the Bruins have suffered this year was to
defending national champion Harvard at Stan
ford's Redwood Shores Classic.
In the women's varsity race, defending cham
pion Washington leads the field, followed by Cal
ifornia and UCLA. Stanford, which finished third
last year, has been battling injuries as well as
the nation's toughest schedule this year but could
emerge as a top finisher.
Preliminary heats will be held tomorrow to
qualify for Sunday's final heats. The top three
finishing teams qualify for the national champi
onships, which will be held next month in Cin
cinnati for men and Pennsylvania for women.
