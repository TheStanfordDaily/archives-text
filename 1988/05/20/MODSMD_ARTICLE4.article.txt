# Zimbardo's prison reopened
## New film documents professor's controversial experiment 
### Gaby Banks Staff writer 
In August 1971, 18 college stu
dents gathered in the basement
of the Psychology Building here
to participate in what would be
come one of the most controver
sial psychological experiments of
all time.
A documentary film of the his
toric Stanford Prison Experiment,
which is still studied in psychol
ogy classes around the country,
debuted last night before large
audiences in both Terman and
Skilling auditoriums.
Using the original footage from
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo's experiment, the film
recreates the project in which par
ticipants were turned into prison
ers and guards. Recent interviews
with the participants are also fea

tured in the film titled "Quiet
Rage, The Stanford Prison
Study."
For the experiment, the partic
ipants were randomly divided into
two groups. Half became guards
and were told to humiliate and
demoralize their nine prisoners,
who were placed in "cells."
The experiment was scheduled
to last for two weeks. But the
"prison" closed down after just
six days when the conditions be
came too realistic for its partici
pants to bear.
Several prisoners suffered emo
tional breakdowns, one went on
a hunger strike and five left the
experiment at different times
before it was called off.
Since this and other experi
ments, controls have been imple
mented to protect human subjects
used in psychological experiments

nationwide.
Aside from retelling the story
of the experiment, the film also
touches on the ethical questions
the experiment raised about how
far researchers can go in pushing
subjects to their psychological and
physical limits for the sake of a
study.
In a question and answer period
following the preview, which was
attended primarily by students
from Zimbardo's introductory
psychology class this quarter,
Zimbardo said he was glad he con
ducted the experiment.
"Am I remorseful?" he asked
in response to a question from
the audience. "Yes. I would not
want my son to be in this exper
iment . . . But I am not sorry the
experiment was done."
