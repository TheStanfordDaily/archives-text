# Zimbardo's prison reopened
## New film documents professor's controversial experiment 
### Gaby Banks Staff writer 
In August 1971, 18 college stu
dents gathered in the basement
of the Psychology Building here
to participate in what would be
come one of the most controver
sial psychological experiments of
all time.
A documentary film of the his
toric Stanford Prison Experiment,
which is still studied in psychol
ogy classes around the country,
debuted last night before large
audiences in both Terman and
Skilling auditoriums.
Using the original footage from
Psychology Prof. Philip Zim
bardo's experiment, the film
recreates the project in which par
ticipants were turned into prison
ers and guards. Recent interviews
with the participants are also fea

tured in the film titled "Quiet
Rage, The Stanford Prison
Study."
For the experiment, the partic
ipants were randomly divided into
two groups. Half became guards
and were told to humiliate and
demoralize their nine prisoners,
who were placed in "cells."
The experiment was scheduled
to last for two weeks. But the
"prison" closed down after just
six days when the conditions be
came too realistic for its partici
pants to bear.
Several prisoners suffered emo
tional breakdowns, one went on
a hunger strike and five left the
experiment at different times
before it was called off.
Since this and other experi
ments, controls have been imple
mented to protect human subjects
used in psychological experiments

nationwide.
Aside from retelling the story
of the experiment, the film also
touches on the ethical questions
the experiment raised about how
far researchers can go in pushing
subjects to their psychological and
physical limits for the sake of a
study.
In a question and answer period
following the preview, which was
attended primarily by students
from Zimbardo's introductory
psychology class this quarter,
Zimbardo said he was glad he con
ducted the experiment.
"Am I remorseful?" he asked
in response to a question from
the audience. "Yes. I would not
want my son to be in this exper
iment . . . But I am not sorry the
experiment was done."
The highlight of the film is an
interview with Doug Korpi, pris
oner number 8612, who suffered
a mental breakdown and was the
first participant to drop out of
the experiment.
"I've never screamed so loud in
my life. I've never been so upset,"
said Korpi, who has since become
the staff psychologist at San Fran-

Cisco County Jail.
Like many others participants
in the experiment, Korpi was
profoundly struck by his own re
action to the situation. "I wanted
to understand myself so I went
into psychology," he said.
However, interviews with pris
oners and guards immediately
after the study revealed a variety
of responses. "I didn't feel any
regret" one guard said. "It was
only afterwards that I realized
this was a part of me I hadn't
noticed before."

"I don't look on it as an exper
iment," one prisoner said. "It was
a prison run by psychologists."
When subjected to the condi
tions of a real prison, the film's
narrative explains how "the best
and brightest of American youth"
began to mirror the behavior of
real prisoners and real guards.
As a result of the experiment,
Zimbardo concluded that regard
less of the person, the power of
the prison environment is
stronger than each individual's
will to resist falling into his role.
