### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
A prominent black historian challenged the
popular view that Malcolm X was a violent,
aggressive radical at a noontime rally celebrat
ing what would have been the Black Panther's
63rd birthday.
Oba T'shaka, chair of black studies at San
Francisco State, editor of the Black Studies
Journal and an active member of several na
tional black organizations, said Malcolm X's
violent image is false and has been promul
gated largely by the mass media.
According to sophomore Jon Hyman, organ
izer of the White Plaza rally, the annual event
is held because "a lot of people have an ig
norant perception of what Malcolm's life was
about." He agreed with T'shaka's assessment
that the perception comes primarily from the
media.
The rally, which drew a crowd of over 60
people and was sponsored by the Black Student
Union, was also intended to celebrate Mal-

colm's life and his work, Hyman
said.
Malcolm X, who was assas
sinated in February 1965, led the
Black Revolutionary Movement in
the United States. Born in
Omaha, Neb., to a poor family,
Malcolm educated himself and
went on to preach a message of
black power.
The "misrepresentation" of
Malcolm's life, and black history
in general, is a result of the fact
that it is generally "defined for
[blacks] by others," T'shaka
claimed. The distortion is based
on a need to control blacks' pasts,
something that results in contem
porary domination, he said.
T'shaka pointed to a book by
Peter Goldman, "The Death and
Life of Malcolm X," as a prime
example of the distortion of Mal
colm's life. The fact that Goldman
chose to place the word "death"
first in his title exemplifies this
distortion, T'shaka said.
"The significant thing isn't his
death, it's his life. We wouldn't
be talking about him if all he did
was die," he said.
T'shaka accused Goldman of
trivializing Malcolm and refuted
the claim in Goldman's book that

Malcolm was only a prophet, and
not a seminal thinker, organizer
or leader. Finally, alleging that
the CIA assassinated Malcolm, he
ironically said, "they didn't kill
him because they thought there
was no chance he'd have a fol
lowing."
Malcolm X actually taught a
philosophy of self-love, stressing
the importance of knowing your
self as a basis for loving yourself
and unity, T'shaka said.
Senior and former BSU chair
Bill King agreed that Malcolm has
been largely misrepresented.
"Malcolm did not advocate vio
lence, he advocated self-defense,"
he said.
"He said 'If you shoot me, I'll
kill you,' he never said 'attack
and kill,' " King said. "However,
because of the racist nature of
this society, people see possession
of guns by the oppressed as ter
rorism while the possession of
guns by the oppressors is seen as
national defense."
In reference to the recent West
ern Culture controversy, T'shaka
emphasized the need for a
balanced study of multicultural
history, "through our (blacks')
own eyes." He said the problem
in Western culture is that
"African studies are not seen as
legitimate when in fact they are
the foundation of European
study."
