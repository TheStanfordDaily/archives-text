MEET THE AUTHORS
OF
INTIMATE MATTERS:
The first full-length study of
the history of sexuality in
this country.
John D'Emilio and Estelle Freedman
describe the different sexual worlds of
plantation slaves, European immigrants,
and the urban middle class and how sex
ual matters moved from the privacy of the
bedroom to its commercial exploitation
and its entry into mass culture
The authors shed light on the complex
nature of race, gender, and class inequal
ity. They discuss such issues as white
slavery and lynching, how sex has served
as a symbol for a wide range of social
problems, and how conflicts over sex
uality have sometimes shaped the polit
ical and cultural contours of an era
D'Emilio and Freedman have drawn on
court records, diaries, letters, and popu
lar art and culture to provide both a
scholarly interpretation of the history of
sexuality and a compelling narrative of
the lives of anonymous Americans.
