• SHOWS IF YOU HAVE BEEN INFECTED
WITH THE AIDS VIRUS AND HAVE
DEVELOPED ANTIBODIES TO THE VIRUS.
• DOES NOT TELL YOU IF YOU NOW HAVE
AIDS OR ARC (AIDS Related Complex)
The decision to be tested for the AIDS antibody is
not a simple one. If, after reviewing the specifics of
your personal situation carefully, you have made a
decision to be tested, it is important that you
understand the meaning of the results you receive.
You need to know what a positive or a negative test
result implies in your personal situation.

ifrouMPOsmc,
• There is a slight possibility that it was a
false positive, that you are not really
infected. Repeating the test may clarify the
results.
• If it's a true positive, then you are infected
with the AIDS virus and have produced
antibodies to the virus which are present in
your blood.
• The virus is in your body and your are
capable of infecting others.
• This result does not necessarily mean that
you now have AIDS or ARC.
• You have a high probability of developing
AIDS within 5-7 years after your test.
Antibodies to the AIDS virus are NOT present in
your blood.
There are two possible explanations'.
1) You are NOT infected with the AIDS virus.
or
2) You have been infected with the AIDS virus,
but your body has not produced antibodies
yet. (It may take anywhere from 2 weeks to
6 months to produce antibodies). Rarely,
infected individuals may never produce HIV
antibodies.
You must be tested again 6 months after possible
infection to be confident that you are not
infected.
People who are actually infected but not
producing antibodies can still infect others.
It does not mean that you are immune to the
AIDS virus.
If you participate in any of the following after
your test:
vagina-penis sex, anus-penis sex, oral-penis sex,
needle sharing during IV drug use and probably
oral-vagina sex and oral-anal sex,
then the result may no longer be applicable. To
find out your current status, you must wait 6
months from the last time you participated in one
of these activities and get tested again.
