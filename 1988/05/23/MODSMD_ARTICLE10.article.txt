# Increased costs put libraries in a bind
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Because of the increasing costs
of maintaining its collections,
Stanford University Libraries
has begun to cancel about
$100,000 in science journal sub
scriptions for the 1988-89 school
year.
Despite an 18 percent Univer
sity increase in the overall 1988-
89 collections budget, planners
said they will be unable to afford
this year's number of subscrip
tions. As a result, they are
projecting a $200,000 budget
shortfall that will cut into sci
ence journals and other human
ities holdings.
Next year's collections budget
will add up to about $5.4 million,
an $800,000 hike from last year,
according to Collection Develop
ment Officer Michael Ryan.
However, both sharply in
creasing subscription rates for
science journals and the dollar's

continuing poor performance on
the international level have con
tributed to the cuts in holdings,
Ryan said.
Over the years, the publishing
of commercial science journals
has gradually shifted from non
profit organizations to large cor
porations, Ryan said. The result
has been to double, triple and
sometimes increase by up to 10
times the subscription costs of
publications for research insti
tutions.
Although some might think
that University Libraries would
receive discounts from the pub
lishers of scientific journals,
Ryan said, "It's just the oppo
site."
Because "we're (a) captive
market, [we] pay more," Ryan
said.
This, combined with the fact
that many of these large pub
lishers are based in Europe,
makes libraries such as Stan
ford's susceptible to "currency

manipulation," he added.
"Over half of the libraries' ma
terials are acquired from foreign
sources," Ryan said. As a result,
Stanford's library holdings are
"very heavily tied to the relation
between the dollar and foreign
currency."
However, Ryan said he does
not think students will notice
that much. "Our expectation is
that the cuts that we're going
to be making will have minimum
impact on our users," he said.
Because it is endowed and con
sidered separate from other li
braries here, Meyer Library will
not be affected at all by any of
the projected cuts.
The research collections in
Green Library and all of the
smaller branches will lose a
small portion of the 30,000 jour
nals to which University Libra
ries subscribes.
Ryan stressed that no widely
used subscriptions will be can
celed. Instead, duplicate sub

scriptions between libraries will
be reduced, while some periph
eral subscriptions will be elimi
nated.
Faculty committee members,
who routinely work with Uni
versity librarians, will help
decide which journals should be
dropped. Before any materials
are eliminated, however, librar
ians will check to make sure they
are available among the holdings
in area libraries and the Re
search Libraries Group.
The Research Libraries Group
is a national consortium of close
to 40 of the most important li
braries that share collections.
Librarians from the group are
also working to speed the ex
change of materials between li
braries to help cope with the
drop in holdings, Ryan said.
Despite these increases, Stan
ford has been "cautious" since
1985 and "more and more cau
tious since then," Ryan said.
