Hungarian party chief replaced
BUDAPEST, Hungary — Janos Kadar, who
led Hungary from the bloody suppression of
its anticommunist revolution in 1956 to re
forms of socialism that have become a model
for the Soviet Bloc, was removed from his
post as general secretary of the Hungarian
Socialist Workers Party at a special party con
ference yesterday.
Kadar, who will turn 76 next week, was
replaced by Karoly Grosz, 57, who will also
continue in his post as prime minister. Kadar
was given the honorary title of party president
but was dropped from the ruling Politburo.
Grosz will lead a new party Politburo and
Central Committee purged of many of Kadar's
longtime allies and seemingly shifted toward
proponents of rapid economic and political
change.
Eight of the 13 members of the Kadar-led
Politburo were dropped, along with 40 percent
of the 100-member Central Committee. Among
the six new Politburo members elected were
the two best-known advocates in Hungary of
radical political reforms, Patriotic People's
Front chief Imre Pozsgay and Rezso Nyers,
architect of Hungary's first economic reforms
in the 19605.
The leadership shift was the second to take
place in the six Soviet-allied nations of Eastern
Europe since Mikhail Gorbachev took power
in Moscow in March 1985. Unlike Milos Jakes,
the conservative and colorless politician chosen
last December as the new Communist leader
of Czechoslovakia, Grosz is considered an en
ergetic and pragmatic politician who has
adopted Gorbachev's open style.
Swaggart returns to the pulpit
BATON ROUGE, La. — Jimmy Swaggart,
defrocked but defiant, returned to the pulpit
yesterday and sought to save his troubled min
istry by unleashing the talent that once had
made him and his operation the envy of tele
vision evangelism.
For more than two hours, the golden-haired
preacher in the sharp black suit wept, shouted
scripture, spoke in tongues, sang, danced,
embraced cripples, grovelled on his knees,
played piano, wept, hugged his weeping wife
and told in whispers of dark, prophetic dreams
and desperate, late-night conversations with
the Lord.
He also asked for money more than once,
but on this, his triumphal return from three
months of penitence, Swaggart seemed less
concerned with raising revenue than removing
the paralysis that has clutched his $150
million-a-year ministry since his February con
fession to "moral failures."
Those among the crowd of 5,000 who came
to the 7,500-seat Family Worship Center an
ticipating Swaggart would provide, as
promised, the particulars of his fall were left
unfulfilled. The preacher displayed a mastery
of euphemism, referring obliquely to his
"trying time" and his "burden" and "Satan"
and "this leviathan." But he never specifically
confirmed or elaborated upon reports that he
has long struggled with a fascination for por
nography and rendezvoused regularly with at
least one prostitute in seedy motels outside
New Orleans.
