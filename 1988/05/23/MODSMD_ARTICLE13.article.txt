# Noriega tenacious
## Deal might allow him to retain power 
### 
WASHINGTON - Panama
nian Gen. Manuel Noriega could
continue to play a mcyor back
stage role in his country's politics
even if he retires under a deal
proposed by the Reagan adminis
tration, White House national se
curity adviser Colin Powell Jr.
said yesterday.
"It's not clear that we can re
move him from actions behind the
scene. . . . The question of what
he does after stepping down from
power is problematic," Powell said
in a television interview.
"Will he continue to be a force
to be reckoned with? One never
knows," Powell said. "But the im
portant thing is that he steps
down from his power base."
Powell's statement confirmed
reports that the administration
has retreated from its initial in
sistence that Noriega, whom U.S.
officials have condemned as a dic
tator, drug trafficker and gun
runner, must be deprived of any
role in Panamanian politics once
he is out of power.
Powell and Secretary of State
George Shultz, in separate televi
sion appearances, officially con
firmed for the first time that the
administration had offered Nori
ega a deal under which federal
drug indictments against the Pan
amanian leader would be dropped
if he agreed to give up his post
as commander of the country's
ruling military.

Both officials noted that Pres
ident Reagan had not yet ap
proved the deal — in part because
Noriega had apparently not
agreed on all the details of his
proposed retirement.
But they both strongly de
fended the proposal as a chance
to restore democracy to Panama
in exchange for dropping indict
ments against a man who appears
impossible to prosecute.
"We have no ability to extradite
him from Panama," Shultz said
on ABC's "This Week with David
Brinkley."
"So you ask yourself, which sit
uation are we better off in? To
have Noriega more or less in
charge in Panama and us with an
indictment that we can't do much
about ... or having Noriega give
up power in Panama and leaving
Panama, but also having paid that
penalty?
"The president has agreed for
the deal to be put on the table,
but it has not gone to closure,"
Powell said on CBS' "Face the
Nation."
"The president is examining the
deal . . . what we get from the
deal . . . the implications of drop
ping an indictment which will
probably never result in Gen. Nor
iega coming to the United States
or going into a court of law or,
if he went into a court of law,
being convicted," Powell said.
