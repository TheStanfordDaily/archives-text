## Israel may have helped China build Saudi missiles 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Israeli experts
working secretly in China were involved
in improving the guidance system of a
type of medium-range missile for Saudi
Arabia that Israel considers a potential
threat to its security, according to U.S.
commercial sources and Saudi experts.
Israeli leaders have publicly expressed
alarm about the presence in the Saudi
kingdom of the missile, which the Chi
nese developed originally to carry nu
clear warheads.
The Saudis and Chinese say it has
been modified for the Saudis to carry
only a conventional explosive. However,
it has a potential range of about 1,600
miles, enough to reach every military
site in Israel.
Israeli technology and expertise,
therefore, have contributed to the de
velopment of a weapon the Israeli gov
ernment now regards as a major new
threat and a destabilizing factor in the
Middle East.
The sources were divided on whether
the Israeli experts knew the modified
missile was destined for Saudi Arabia
or thought China was selling it to Iran
or Iraq, the two major clients of Chinese
arms exports.
The Israelis were reported to be

working to improve the accuracy of the
guidance system and to help the Chinese
make other changes required to convert
the missile from a nuclear to a conven
tional weapon. The missile was still not
fully operational as of March, according
to Saudi sources.
China and Saudi Arabia, two highly
secretive societies, went to great lengths
to keep the missile sale a secret. U.S.
intelligence did not obtain convincing
evidence about it until early this year.
The sources, who asked not to be iden
tified because some of them work in
Saudi Arabia, said some of the Israelis
had been using false Philippine pass
ports traced to the Philippine consulate
in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. They said
reports about these passports had been
circulating for several months in Jeddah
and Riyadh, the Saudi capital, and had
led them to believe that the Israelis may
have come into Saudi Arabia to work
on the missiles.
One U.S. official said he doubted the
Israeli experts knew that the missile,
known by NATO as the CSS2-class and
by China as the DF3A, was destined for
sale to Saudi Arabia.
