# U.S., Soviets may join in Mars probe
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The United States
has informed the Soviet Union that it
is prepared to assist a 1994 Soviet un
manned probe of the planet Mars, but
the Reagan administration considers a
high-profile leadership commitment to
a joint Mars mission to be premature,
officials said yesterday.
Samuel Keller, deputy associate ad
ministrator for space sciences of the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration, said he informed Soviet scien
tists 10 days ago in Moscow of a U.S.
decision in principle to take Soviet Mars
probe equipment into space on a planned
U.S. space launch in 1992.
This first move toward tangible U.S.-
Soviet cooperation in the exploration of
Mars came less than a week before the
disclosure by Soviet leader Mikhail Gor
bachev that he will ask President Reagan
during their Moscow summit meeting
next week to "cooperate on a flight to
Mars." Gorbachev disclosed his plan
Wednesday during an interview with
The Washington Post and Newsweek
that was published in yesterday's Post.
Secretary of State George Shultz, in
terviewed on ABC News' "This Week
With David Brinkley," said he expects
a U.S.-Soviet Mars mission to be dis
cussed under the space science coopera
tion agreement that he and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze

signed in Moscow April 15, 1987. Such
a mission, Shultz said, "has been talked
about, but it's a long way from being
agreed upon."
Gorbachev spoke of a joint U.S.-Soviet
mission to Mars while meeting American
artists, intellectuals and scientists at the
Soviet Embassy here last Dec. 8 during
the Washington summit, according to
U.S. participants in the meeting. Roald
Sagdeyev, director of Moscow's Space
Research Institute and a Gorbachev ad
viser, provided details Dec. 13 of a pro
posal for extensive U.S.-Soviet coopera
tion, first on unmanned flights to Mars
and later on manned flights, in an article
published in the Outlook section of The
Post.
State Department sources said that
in Moscow next week, the Reagan team
is prepared to propose the exchange of
studies of future space projects that
might be undertaken by either country,
as a basis for cooperative planning. Until
now, the exchange of such information
has been limited and spotty, according
to official sources.
Shultz, saying that "we have to be
careful with problems of technology
transfer," referred to one of the central
problems impeding greatly expanded
U.S.-Soviet space cooperation.
