# INF treaty ratification likely as summit nears
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Sen
ate's leading Democratic arms
control expert said yesterday that
the odds are "60-40" that the
chamber will ratify the Inter
mediate-range Nuclear Forces
Treaty in time for the Moscow
summit — but not before Presi
dent Reagan's departure Wednes
day for the Soviet Union.
"My guess is that we will finish
the INF Treaty prior not to the
president departing, but prior to
the actual meetings," said Sen.
Sam Nunn of Georgia, chair of
the Armed Forces Committee. He
cautioned, however, that the
timing of the vote is unclear.
Meanwhile, administration offi
cials, striving to steer the treaty
through the Senate, held out hope
that they might reach a last
minute accord with Democrats,
who have offered several contro
versial additions to the pact. They
also refrained from criticizing Re
publican conservatives, who have
threatened to torpedo the INF
agreement with crippling amend
ments.
Amid the political maneuvering,

administration officials warmed
up for the meetings between
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev by
issuing strong praise for the So
viet leader.
"In terms of tone, it is quite
apparent that he (Gorbachev)
wants to see things move forward,
and I think that is good," said
Secretary of State George Shultz
in a television interview. He added
that it is "certainly possible" that
the two superpowers could reach
an agreement on a proposal to
reduce their arsenal of strategic
nuclear weapons before Reagan
leaves office next January.
Given the political deadlock in
the Senate, however, there are
growing doubts whether Reagan
and Gorbachev will be able to ex
change documents ratifying the
INF pact when they meet. Few
Senate leaders believe that the
treaty will be approved by Wed
nesday, when Reagan departs for
two days in Finland, before
proceeding on to Moscow for of
ficial meetings beginning Monday,
May 30.
