## Ending inequity 
### 
Equity could finally
reach the Stanford housing
system.
The Returning Resident Priority
has been abolished. However, some
details have yet to be addressed.
The Housing Operation Advisory
Committee, which recommended
that the priority be dropped,
should have dealt more explicitly
with the issue of continuity in co
ops, self-ops, theme houses and Al
pha Sigma, a coed fraternity whose
residents are selected through the
Draw.
The committee's two-paragraph
plan to eliminate the priority
points out only that ways must be
found to "ensure adequate conti
nuity in those houses with special
or unique programmatic and/or
operational needs." The clause
refers to the "programmatic
needs" of academic and ethnic
theme houses, including organiz
ing house seminars and speakers
series. Those houses with "opera
tional needs" are co-ops and self
ops, which each year have monu
mental tasks of organizing how to
run their houses.
However, there is already a way
to deal with the problem of conti
nuity: Draw-exempt spaces in the
houses for house managers, kit
chen managers and theme as
sociates.
Those Draw-exempt spaces —
and the number of students who
will return, without the Returning
Resident Priority, to their residen
ces through the random operation

of the Draw — will be enough to
provide continuity.
Individual houses can work with
the Housing Center and the Office
of Residential Education if they
feel that more Draw-exempt posi
tions are needed to support their
themes or operations, but no major
deviations from the overall policy
should be allowed. The Returning
Resident Priority should not be
retained in any house.
For many houses, the Special
Priority Two, which is available to
everyone who meets certain objec
tive criteria, ensures that students
who have an interest in furthering
the theme and/or operations of a
house receive preference in assign
ment to that house.
Because Priority Two will now
be the most powerful priority in
the Draw, special care should be
taken to ensure that it is not
abused and that it truly measures
a student's interest and enthusi
asm.
Returning Resident Priority was
unfair because it overly rewarded
those who drew well the first time
they drew. Students who liked the
first house they were assigned to
were set for the remainder of their
guaranteed years, while the un
lucky ones suffered for another
year.
Stanford students should have
equal opportunity each year to live
in the housing they desire. That's
the reason for having a housing
lottery in the first place.
