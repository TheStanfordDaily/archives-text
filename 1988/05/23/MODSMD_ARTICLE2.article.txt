# University eliminates returning residency
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Senior staff writer 
If the California lottery re
warded Lotto winners with a cash
prize and the numbers for next
week's jackpot, you would think
the game was a little strange. Ap
parently, University officials have
made a similar determination
about the Returning Resident Pri
ority.
After months of deliberation
and open campus forums, the
Housing Operations Advisory
Committee recommended to As
soc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson Friday that the Return
ing Resident Priority be elimi
nated for students who entered
Stanford this year. Robinson said
yesterday that he accepted the
recommendation Friday, essen
tially putting the policy into ef
fect.
Robinson said he "listened to
the pros and cons and . . . was
persuaded" to accept the change.

Students who entered Stanford
this year were given notice in the
fall that the priority might be
dropped.
The change means that stu
dents who wish to live in the same
house for more than one year will
no longer receive preferred status
in the Draw, but must apply in
the same pool as all other eligible
students.
The fairness of the priority has
been debated for some time.
Junior Marni Lum, chair of the
committee, said, "There was fi
nally the need to do something
about returning residency."
She added that "the inequities
have become very evident."
Reaction to the change was
mixed, though many agreed with
Toyon Resident Assistant Tim
Cochran, who said, "[The change]
is a good thing. It gives everyone
an opportunity to live in good
housing."
Cochran added that the elimi
nation of the priority makes sense

as long as students feel there is
such a disparity in the desirability
of different residences.
The committee also recom
mended that the Housing Center
work with Res Ed to ensure "ad
equate continuity in those houses
with special or unique program
matic and/or operational needs."
Included among these are co-ops
and theme houses.
Robinson said he and Rodger
Whitney, director of housing,
would work on implementing the
change and also determining how
many exempt spaces would be
provided in co-ops and theme
houses. Exempt spaces allow stu
dents to return to a given resi
dence without participating in the
Draw. They are provided for com
puter tutors, theme associates,
house officers and financial man
agers.
Residents of Alpha Sigma, a
coed fraternity whose residents
are subject to the Draw, expressed
a great deal of concern over the
change, as they had done at a
forum held on the issue May 10.
Steven Lurie, the RA at Alpha
Sig, said he understands the in
equities created by the priority
but feels that certain houses need
significant numbers of returning
residents to continue the tradi
tions that preserve the character
of the house.
"They should figure out a way
to save our house [because the
change] is going to kill Alpha Sig,"
he added.
Lurie expressed concern that an
insufficient number of exempt
spaces would be provided to
preserve the "nuances" of the
house.
But Andrea Contreras, house
president at Alpha Sig, said she
was "relatively confident that
something can be worked out."
She added that the University has
been very sympathetic to their
needs.
