## Abolish in-class finals 
### 
ON WEDNESDAY, May 18, 1988,
11:59:36 a.m., I dropped my pen,
closed my blue book and com
pleted the last in-class three-hour exam
ination of my academic career.
The champagne flowed, the high-fives
slapped and the information oozed. It
oozed out of my brain, out of my short
term memory and slowly dissipated into
the Intellectual Void. Another successful
cram mission completed.
After having taken over 50 college and
law school three-hour exams and having
spent roughly 1,200 hours of time cram
ming for them, I have come to one stark
conclusion: The in-class three-hour exam
is an unfair, poorly evaluative and educa
tionally ineffective tool that should be
abolished. In its place, we should have
one- to two-day take-home finals.
What has struck me recently is how
universities and law schools have brain
washed me to believe that the three-hour
exam represents the appropriate vehicle
to test my knowledge of course material.
While I have protested changes in the
curriculum, the faculty and the admin
istration's policies, I have silently left
unchallenged one of the most important
pedagogical devices affecting my aca
demic life: the final exam.
In addressing this issue, I initially ask
myself the question: "Why do we have
final exams at all?" Three purposes
spring to mind. First, a final exam pro
vides the chance to synthesize the course
material, interrelating the different con
cepts presented in the readings and lec
tures with our own thoughts.

Second, a final serves to fairly evaluate
our performance vis-&-vis our classmates.
Third, a final aids the learning process
when a professor corrects and comments
on the exam.
Measured against these purposes, the
three-hour in-class final is a failure in
all three respects. The three-hour exam
is far too short a time period to integrate,
summarize and present adequately the
hundreds of pages of information and
notebooks full of class notes.
It rewards fast and manually dexterous
writers who can spew forth superficial
and broad answers covering many differ
ent issues rather than those slow-handed
students who prefer to develop and sup
port their analyses more thoroughly.
The three-hour final places a premium
on the ability of a student to cram and
to figure out the few areas the professor
might ask questions on. Since professors
expect less out of the students due to
the time constraints, the professors are
less likely to require insight and more
likely to credit regurgitation. Only part
of the breadth rather than the depth of
our knowledge is being tested.
As a learning tool, the three-hour exam
fails to teach us anything significantly
useful. When in our lives are we going
to have to respond to a creative demand
without notes, without resources and
without time? While there will be a few
occasions, the great minority of our lives'
academic, vocational and social pursuits
will demand careful, well-thought-out
planning, not three hours of nerve
racking scribbling.

Thus, I propose that professors switch,
if they have not already done so, from
three-hour in-class finals to one- to two
day take-home exams. The advantages of
this change are clear. Students will have
more of an opportunity to demonstrate
the extent of their knowledge. Professors
will be encouraged to write more com
prehensive and challenging finals and ex
pect better products in return.
No longer will a significant part of a
student's academic performance be
judged on whether he was "on" for three
hours out of a 10-week quarter or a
14-week semester. While one or two days
is still a small amount of time, it provides
a better balance between giving the stu
dent enough time to structure and com
plete his thoughts and forcing the student
to do so within a reasonable amount of
time and number of pages.
The only excuse that professors and
students have for not adopting the take
home exam is that it will require more
work on both their parts. As one friend
said, "Three hours later and it still won't
be over."
