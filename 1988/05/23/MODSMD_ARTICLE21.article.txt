## Divestment supports moral objectives in S. Africa 
### 
I AM WRITING in response to the
May 16 letter in which Alex Grant
questions the effectiveness of di
vestment of shares in companies that
do business in South Africa.
Divestment is both an important
moral statement and an effective
policy. It strikes at the heart of the
problem in South Africa by contribu
ting to the end of foreign investment
— foreign investment which helps the
white minority brutally oppress the
black majority.
It is precisely because foreign invest
ment is so important to the South
African government that it spends
millions of dollars each year lobbying
this country to defeat divestment,
disinvestment and sanctions.
Second, divestment purely as a moral
action is significant because it states

clearly and unequivocally our opposi
tion to apartheid and our support for
the democratic forces in that country.
Such moral support expressed
through financial action has been
significant in this country. For exam
ple, in World War 11, American citizens
bought U.S. war bonds not because
that action alone would defeat Hitler
but because it contributed to a larger
effort.
In addition, we support divestment
because anti-apartheid leaders specifi
cally call for this action. We feel it is
particularly important not only to
speak against apartheid but to support
those organizations representing black
South Africans who are fighting for
democracy in their country.
We advocate total divestment be
cause it is the most immediate action
that we can take here at Stanford.

However, total divestment is only one
of Students for a Free South Africa's
objectives.
Other activities include national
lobbying for economic sanctions and
corporate disinvestment, educating the
public about South Africa and provid
ing material aid for the exiled South
African community.

It is through a combination of all
these actions that Stanford students
can best contribute toward democracy
in South Africa. Certainly the severity
of apartheid demands that we do all
we can.
