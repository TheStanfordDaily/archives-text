# Senior formal excluded students
## 
### 
It is unfortunate that many seniors
were unable to attend this year's
senior formal. Its $50 price tag coupled
with its location in San Francisco,
simply made this culminating event
infeasible to a disturbingly large num
ber of seniors.
We appreciate the effort of this
year's energetic senior presidents, but
we are disappointed they did not en
sure the accessibility of the event to
all seniors. The senior formal should
not be an exclusive engagement, but

rather one to be enjoyed by every
member of the senior class.
Also, the prohibitive ticket price plus
the inevitable additional costs of cos
tumes, dinner and transportation can
only detract from the enjoyment of
those barely able to find the necessary
$50-plus for the evening.
Four years and $70,000 later (that's
dollars, not lire), it is truly a shame
that we all cannot come together to
celebrate at least once before gradua
tion.
