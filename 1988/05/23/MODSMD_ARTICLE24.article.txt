# Farm's atmosphere is anti-intellectual
## 
### 
I was outraged at the negative re
sponse of the anonymous freshman
who won the Dean's Award for Aca
demic Achievement. For whatever rea

son, the May 10 article focused on this
student's response, a response that
makes all Stanford students look bad.
A representative Stanford student
appears to suffer from "intellectual
phobia." Stanford's biggest drawback is
its non-intellectual atmosphere.
I am not suggesting that Stanford be
an "Fastern school" (as the freshman
fears) or an Oxford. However, as we
celebrate Stanford's diversity we should
also realize that our university lacks
some elements which would contribute
to this diversity.
The purpose of a university is to
educate; the people who take their
education seriously deserve to be com
mended. The university would not
automatically become competitive, up
tight and nerdy if people would trea
sure what they learn here. Instead, we
as students would benefit from Stan
ford as a contemplative and therefore
unique Disneyland.
