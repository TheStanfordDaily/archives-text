## Population research booms 
### Todd Pierce Staff writer 
Elbow room. It's hard to find now, and it's going
to get worse.
By the year 2000, nearly six billion people will
be sharing the Earth. The high rate of population
growth in many countries will accelerate the deple
tion of resources and endanger economic develop
ment. Researchers at the University's Institute for
Population and Resource Studies are working
toward solutions for these new problems and pro
moting awareness of our interdependent world.
"In a world dominated by trade, you can't hide
anywhere. Problems like acid rain and nuclear emis
sions have enforced a global responsibility on us.
Our environment, resources and economies are in
terdependent, and all agitated by rapid population
growth," according to Dr. Fred Pinkham, associate
director of the Institute.
Pinkham explained that experts from many dis
ciplines are needed to meet new and complex prob
lems, so the Institute draws faculty from many
University departments and auxiliary schools.
"Professors in one department often don't talk
to other professors despite similarities in their work.
We want to bring chemists in contact with biologists
and vice versa — we need to be interdisciplinary
because the problems are interdisciplinary," said
Pinkham,
Calling himself the "principal investigator" for
the Institute, Pinkham referred to the droughts
and desertification in East Africa, the phoenix-like
cycles of poverty on the hurricane-prone Bangladesh
delta and the worldwide problem of erosion as ex
amples of problems which cannot be classified as
purely economic, environmental or demographic.
"Population growth, environmental degradation
and exhaustion of resources like water and soil

affect each other" and form complex problems, he
said. To increase awareness of the issues, the In
stitute sponsors several courses for undergraduates
and graduate students.
Pinkham hopes to expand population studies here
by adding a visiting fellows program that would
bring in outside experts and encourage further re
search in environmental issues. In addition, Uni
versity graduate students may soon be able to
pursue advanced work at the Institute for academic
credit.

A paper describing the purpose and goals of the
Institute reported these steps will help researchers
focus on all aspects of a particular problem in de
velopment, such as fertility control methods in
African countries.
Pinkham expressed hope that the Institute would
stimulate awareness of international interdepen
dence as well as promote research. He praised the
Institute's summer program, which will send 15
students to Costa Rica to help restore depleted rain
forests.
"We want to bring realism to campus," he said.
