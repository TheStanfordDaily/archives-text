# Judging the rape threat
## 
### Erika Ryst 
In an attempt to understand
the threat of rape here, Stan
ford's Rape Education Project
has asked some very serious
questions about "attitudes,
awareness and personal experi
ence . . . with sexual violence,"
according to Ted Desmaisons,
Stanford's REP press represen
tative.
Saying that REP hoped to
"root" down assumptions about
campus rape into flfcct, Des
maisons, a sophomore, ex
plained that his group sent sur
veys to about 20 percent of the
student body last week.
Because some of the survey
questions are sexually explicit
and personal, respondents will
remain anonymous and partici
pation is voluntary.
Although the survey might be
upsetting to some, Desmaisons
said that REP members spent
many hours laboring to make
"each question right on target."
"We wanted to know why we
were asking [the question],
whether it would give what we
wanted to know and whether it
was necessary," he said.
Through response to the
questions REP can put "a net"

over theories and determine to
what extent a rape problem
exists on campus, Desmaisons
predicted.
"Nobody can say yes (rape is
a problem), however, I assume
it is. If anything happens, it is
a problem. The survey will tell
for sure if it is," Desmaisons
said.
Established 10 years ago,
REP is a student group fighting
to change and challenge atti
tudes about sexual violence and
sexism. And most REP mem
bers said that sexual violence
does indeed exist at Stanford.
Claiming that there are "at
titudes and behaviors that are
a problem (at Stanford)," REP
member Michelle Finkel said
she "would get angry when
[dormmates] made sexist re
marks."
Finkel and other REP mem
bers have reached out to the
campus throughout the year,
leading discussions, setting up
workshops and showing films in
dorms and fraternities.
"Rethinking Rape," a film
made by a Stanford graduate in
1983, deals with "the contin
uum of sexism and rape," and
has made an impact in the
dorms, Desmaisons explained.

All royalties from the film go
to funding REP's projects and
workshops.
Some of the most rewarding
REP workshops have occurred
at fraternities, Desmaisons said.
At first, it was "really hard for
me just to listen to what the
men were saying," he said about
his experience with one frater
nity.
According to Desmaisons, fra
ternity members' attacks on
feminism and their denial of the
date rape problem were upset
ting. But tension between Des
moines and the other men even
tually "washed away," he said.
"We were all teaching each
other by the end.
"They (the fraternity mem
bers) wouldn't have said all the
things they said if there had
been women there," Des
maisons said. "There are things
men need to do [and talk about]
with men."
With its new survey, REP
might "develop national net
works" for changing attitudes,
according to REP treasurer
Heather McClure. The survey
will "be printed up in some
major magazines . . . and will
open possibilities," said
McClure, a sophomore.
