## Netters fight to semifinals; face USC today 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Responding to the
intesity of play at the 104 th NCAA
Tennis Championships, the top
seeded Stanford men's tennis team
eked out an emotional 5-2 quarter
final win yesterday over the Ken
tucky Wildcats at the Henry Field

Stadium.
With the victory, the Cardinal advanced to today's
2 p.m. semifinal round against No. 3 seed USC.
Saturday, the Cardinal didn't drop a set in any
match, blanking Texas 5-0.
"You've got to give them a lot of credit," said
Kentucky Coach Dennis Embry, whose team was
the seventh seed entering NCAA play with a 23-5
record. "We have a great team and they beat us.
They are the best-coached team with the most tal
ent. It will take a monumental effort for someone
out here to beat them."
With Kentucky players pumping their fists, yelling
to their fans and jeering at their opponents after
every point won, the inspired Wildcats welcomed
the Cardinal to its first test at NCAA competition.
"Matches like these aren't won by luck," Stanford
Coach Dick Gould said. "They're won by gutty
performances. I've got to credit our guys for pulling
it out."
At No. 2 singles — the first match off the courts
— sophomore Jeff Tarango and his Wildcat oppon
ent, Mario Rincon, let their tempers get the best
of them.
After Tarango edged Rincon 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), Rincon
refused to shake hands with his opponent. Tarango
said some words to Rincon and the Wildcat junior
dropped his racquet and pushed Tarango. Stanford
Asst. Coach John Whitlinger rushed over and
quickly stopped the fight.
"There's a lot of emotion out there." Tarango
said. "Things got said out there; things got a little
too heated. It went too far. I was just trying to
defend myself."
Tarango was suspended from yesterday's doubles
competition, while Rincon was suspended from the
rest of the tournament.
Heated play continued at No. 3 singles as Wildcat
junior Rich Benson fist-pumped his way to a 6-2
second-set victory after bowing to senior Patrick
McEnroe in the first set. But McEnroe was to steady




Ken Beer — Dally
In addition to winning both his singles matches at the No. 2 slot
this weekend, sophomore Jeff Tarango posted a draw in a post
match fight against Kentucky's Mario Rincon.
