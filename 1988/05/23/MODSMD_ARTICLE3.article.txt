# Freshman loses housing for insensitive conduct
## Oteran evicted for 'homophobic, racial and sexual' slurs 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
An Otero resident was kicked
out of University housing Friday
for his numerous belligerent and
homophobic actions since last fall,
when he moved into the all
freshman dorm, Otero resident
assistants said yesterday.
Kenny Ehrman, a freshman,
was suspended from housing after
he got drunk and vandalized the
house lounge March 15 and then
insulted both Otero Resident Fel
low Dennis Matthies and RA Jeff
Sloan immediately afterward.
Ehrman called Sloan, who is
openly gay, a "faggot," culminat
ing months of verbal abuse of the
RA.
Under the sentence, handed

down Wednesday
by Residential
Dean Juan Yni
guez, Housing Di
rector Rodger
Whitney and As
soc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs
Norm Robinson,
Ehrman has been
suspended from

housing for the rest of this quar
ter and will have to petition next
year to be eligible for housing.
Ehrman has decided not to appeal
the decision.
Damage to the lounge was not
substantial, consisting of a torn
down calendar and other posters,
fliers and announcements. Police
were not involved.
Ehrman, who cursed Matthies

and called him a "fucking wimp"
for deferring the disciplinary re
sponsibility to Yniguez, said last
night that he sent a letter of apol
ogy to Matthies and that while
he has not apologized to Sloan,
he is sorry for what he called him.
Robinson said yesterday that
Ehrman violated the Residence
Agreement. The agreement
specifies that a student will "be
considerate of others" and "re
spect the rights of others at all
times."
Robinson said the suspension
was not unusual. "It has occurred
many times," he said, noting that
the same discipline has already
been applied this year in at least
one case, which he would not dis
