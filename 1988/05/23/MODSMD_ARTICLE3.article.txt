# Freshman loses housing for insensitive conduct
## Oteran evicted for 'homophobic, racial and sexual' slurs 
### David Dirks Staff writer 
An Otero resident was kicked
out of University housing Friday
for his numerous belligerent and
homophobic actions since last fall,
when he moved into the all
freshman dorm, Otero resident
assistants said yesterday.
Kenny Ehrman, a freshman,
was suspended from housing after
he got drunk and vandalized the
house lounge March 15 and then
insulted both Otero Resident Fel
low Dennis Matthies and RA Jeff
Sloan immediately afterward.
Ehrman called Sloan, who is
openly gay, a "faggot," culminat
ing months of verbal abuse of the
RA.
Under the sentence, handed

down Wednesday
by Residential
Dean Juan Yni
guez, Housing Di
rector Rodger
Whitney and As
soc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs
Norm Robinson,
Ehrman has been
suspended from

housing for the rest of this quar
ter and will have to petition next
year to be eligible for housing.
Ehrman has decided not to appeal
the decision.
Damage to the lounge was not
substantial, consisting of a torn
down calendar and other posters,
fliers and announcements. Police
were not involved.
Ehrman, who cursed Matthies

and called him a "fucking wimp"
for deferring the disciplinary re
sponsibility to Yniguez, said last
night that he sent a letter of apol
ogy to Matthies and that while
he has not apologized to Sloan,
he is sorry for what he called him.
Robinson said yesterday that
Ehrman violated the Residence
Agreement. The agreement
specifies that a student will "be
considerate of others" and "re
spect the rights of others at all
times."
Robinson said the suspension
was not unusual. "It has occurred
many times," he said, noting that
the same discipline has already
been applied this year in at least
one case, which he would not dis


Ehrman
close.
According to Sloan, Ehrman's
recent conduct capped a long se
ries of "sexist and homophobic"
actions. Ehrman, with the sup
port of a few other Otero resi
dents, organized the printing of
party fliers that were sexist, Sloan
said, because they pictured a
woman and used crude terms to
label her body parts.
Also, Ehrman and his room
mate, Turner Bauer, made T
shirts stating "WASP by popular
demand," Sloan said. Around the
same time, another T-shirt pro
claiming "Aryan by the grace of
God" appeared in the house
through the encouragement of
Ehrman and a student outside Of
Otero.
The penalty "sends out a very
clear signal," Sloan said. "We re
spond harshly to racist comments
and abuse to gay students."
Matthies agreed with Sloan.
"The University does not and
should not tolerate, under any cir

cumstances, derogatory remarks
that are sexist, racist, homophobic
or directed toward any one indi
vidual," he said. ,
Ehrman, who is currently
staying at the Holiday Inn in Palo
Alto, said he felt the suspension
was too harsh. Calling Matthies
a wimp "was a blurt-out thing, I
didn't mean it,"he said, adding,
"I apologized. I was drunk, and
not intentionally mean."
He also accused the RAs of
being biased and uncommunica
tive throughout the year. Attack
ing the RAs' attitudes toward him
and his group of friends, he said:
"They never wanted to hear your
side; they would never even talk
to you."
He added, "The selection of RAs
was pretty bad; there was no one
we could relate to."
But RA Michael Lu, a senior,
said the staff had "tried to be
open" all year.
Sloan also disputed that there
was any bias, saying, "My behav
ior toward him was a result of
his initial antics. I was never
predisposed to single him out for
any reason."
Freshman Matt Rogers, a friend

of Ehrman's who moved to Otero
from Roble this year and sup
ported Ehrman's actions, charged
that the residential education sys
tem in Otero was poor. "There
was severe tension and an
tagonism, and the house seemed
divided between residents and res
idential education," he said.
Freshman Kevin Malloy, also a
resident of Otero who moved from
Roble and was sympathetic to
Ehrman, said Ehrman was a rebel
who couldn't fit Res Ed's mold of
a completely "tolerant" atmos
phere. "They were going to foster
a certain environment at all costs,
and would do what was necessary
to preserve this environment," he
said.
Sloan countered that the toler
ant atmosphere needed to be up
held and Ehrman was given
several ultimatums to tone down
his behavior.
Matthies said he was concerned
about students in Otero who may
be gay or lesbian. "Unfortunately
the biggest losers in all this have
been the gay women and men in
Otero who, thoughout the year,
have been silent and anonymous,
out of fear," he said.
