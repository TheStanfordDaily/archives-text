# Card hoping to pull off hat trick
## No. 3 Trojans pose a stern test 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — After three
regular season battles and four
rounds of NCAA play, Pacific 10
Conference rivals Stanford and
USC find themselves preparing
for the war — with the winner
qualifying for the NCAA Tennis
Championship Finals.
USC won battle number one in
February, routing the Cardinal
(minus freshman David Wheaton)
5-1 at the National Indoor Team
Championships.
Stanford won battles two and
three during the Pac-10 regular
season, winning 6-3 at Stanford
and 5-4 at Los Angeles.
Unlike the others, though,
today's match before 4,267 fans
at Henry Field Stadium is the
war. It could well determine the
1988 NCAA team champion.
"This is it," Stanford's Jeff
Tarango said. "It doesn't matter
who won during the regular
season. If you don't win the
NCAAs, no one cares."
"Both teams are so close," he
added. "Their players are solid on
down the line. It's all emotion out
here. Anyone can win at anytime.
Everyone knows that and tries
their hardest every second."
If past behavior between the
Cardinal and the Trojans is any
indication, in addition to a tight
match, some heated debates over
line calls, finger pointing and fist
pumping are in the cards.
Against USC in Los Angeles,
USC junior Eric Amend started
a scuffle with Stanford freshman
Martin Blackman after Blackman
won their match in three sets. In
Athens, both USC and Stanford
— with the NCAAs on the line
— have been more emotional on
the court than ever.
USC has looked impressive in
its two wins and is an improved
team with senior Swede Jonas
Wallgard healthy and playing well
at number five singles.
USC coach Dick Leach, who has
never guided an NCAA champi
onship team, took his team down
for "boot camp"in Palm Springs
for two weeks prior to the NCAAs.
Attempting to simulate the heat
and humidity of Athens, Leach
put his team through two three
hour sessions a day in 112-degree
heat.
"We are going to have to play
the best match of our year to beat
Stanford," Leach said. "We are a
better team now than when we
last played Stanford."
Here's a look at today's lineup:
No. 1 singles: David Wheaton vs.
Scott Melville In a real power vs.
power matchup, Melville has the
edge in this contest, though
Wheaton haa the talent to beat
him. The senior Melville, from
San Marino, is ranked second in

'We are going to have
to play the best match
of our year to beat
Stanford. We are a
better team now than
when we last played
Stanford.'
— Dick Leach

the nation, is an NCAA veteran
with the 1987 NCAA doubles
championship to his credit (with
Rick Leach), and is 3-0 against
Stanford this season.
No. 2 singles: Jeff Tarango vs.
John Carras Tarango is the fa
vorite in this one, but has a pulled
stomach muscle that hurts his
serve. Though he's not serving at
full strength, Tarango is too men
tally tough for Carras. "I'm play
ing a lot on guts," Tarango said.
"But when it gets to the tight
points, the injury doesn't really
matter."
No. 3 singles: Patrick McEnroe
vs. Byron Black McEnroe will
win. He's a senior, a better player
than Black, and won't buckle un
der pressure. Plus, Black is win
less against Stanford this year.
No. 4 singles: Martin Blackman
vs. Eric Amend This one's a toss
up. Blackman beat Amend twice
during the season, but both times
lost 6-0 in the first set. In a pivotal
match, Blackman has the advan
tage on talent, but Amend the
edge on experience. Blackman, a
real clutch performer, will eke this
one out.
No. 5 singles: Jeff Cathrall vs.
Jonas Wallgard Based on their
match in Los Angeles, Cathrall is
an easy pick. But Wallgard is a
quality player who qualified for
the NCAA singles draw last year.
He just hasn't been healthy. Now
he's back at full strength and will
beat Cathrall.
No. 6 singles: (Jlenn Solomon vs.
Scott Brownsberger USC is heav
ily favored in this one. Browns
berger is 3-0 against Stanford,
and Solomon has had trouble at
number six in big matches.
No. 1 doubles: Wheaton-Tarango
vs. Melville-Amend Wheaton and
Tarango have a 2-1 record against
the Trojan pair, but while Ta
rango can get away with a
mediocre serve in singles, he can't
in doubles. Melville and Amend
should prevail.
No. 2 doubles: Blackman-
McEnroe vs. Brownsberger-
Murphy Jensen McEnroe and
Blackman are 2-0 against the
Trojan pair and should win again.
McEnroe is just too tough on big

points.
No. 3 doubles: Cathrall-Eric Peus
vs. Carras-Hlack This is Stan
ford's match. Though the two tan
dems split the two season match

es, Peus played his best tennis of
the year yesterday against Ken
tucky, arid he will provide the dif
ference here.
Prediction: Stanford 5, USC 4.


Ken Beer — Dally
Sophomore Jeff Cathrall has been perfect for the Cardinal so far
In the NCAA Championships. He has won both his No. 5 singles
matches In straight sets and teamed with classmate Eric Peus to
sweep the No. 3 doubles match against Kentucky yesterday to
clinch the 5-2 victory.
