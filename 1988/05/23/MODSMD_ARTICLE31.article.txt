LOS ANGELES
— Even though
the Stanford
men's and wom
en's track and
field teams both
finished in sixth

place, exactly as expected, at
the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships, there were
still many surprises.
On Saturday Junior Erica
Wheeler came up with the big
gest, surprising everyone — in
cluding herself — by launching
her javelin 192 feet, 2 inches,
the best mark in the nation
this year.
Senior Brian Marshall also
surprised, winning the high
jump at 7-534. The personal
best breaks the Stanford and
Pac-10 meet mark of 7-4V4
Marshall set in winning the
event two years ago.
"I really didn't have any ex
pectations today," he said.
"This was only my fourth out
door meet this year and my
best outdoor (jump) was 7-1. I
was a little nervous but I jump
well at times when I feel that
way. After I cleared the bar at
2.20 meters [7-2Vi] I became
very confident and I knew I
could jump a lot higher."
Additionally, sophomore
Carol Gray ran rampant in the
10,000 meters and junior Patty
Purpur placed second in the
shot put.
Wheeler came up for her first

throw Saturday and sent the
javelin 174-11, less than three
feet off her personal best and
almost good enough to win the
meet. On her next throw, she
launched a rocket that came
down after flying 192 feet.
"I was in shock," she said
afterward. "I thought it was a
good throw, but I didn't think
it was a record throw until they
announced it."
The women's 10,000 fol
lowed, with Gray running all
alone to victory. She started
the race with a fast first lap
and built a 70-meter lead after
the first mile. The early
pacesetters usually fall back in
the later stages of long races,
but Grey has built her racing
career on consistent splits.
After doing just that to post
the easy victory, Gray was a
little surprised with her suc
cess. "I didn't really have any
strategy, since it was my first
10,000-meter run," she said. "I
just wanted to stay relaxed and
in control."
Senior John Gash made the
most of a unpredictable pole
vault event to finish second.
The top qualifiers all dropped
out early, leaving Gash and the
others in a wide-open contest.
Gash cleared 16-4Vfe, but
missed in his three attempts
at 16-8.
The men's mile relay team
of freshman James Cramton,
Strang, Skoog and freshman
Darrell Armstrong turned in a
season-best time of 3:09.65 to
finish fifth.
