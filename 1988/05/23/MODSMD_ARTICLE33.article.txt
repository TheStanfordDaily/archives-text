# Crews beat the heat, opposition

UCLA's varsity
men and Wash
ington's varsity
women had little
trouble defending
their respective
Pacific 10 Con-

ference rowing titles at the
Pacific Coast Rowing Champion
ships on Sacramento's Lake
Natoma.
However, Stanford's close
third-place finish in the men's
varsity event and the success of
first-year Cardinal women
rowers give indications that
Stanford will seriously challenge
for a title next year.
UCLA's varsity men, who cap
tured their preliminary heat Sat
urday, led from the opening
strokes in yesterday's Grand
Final, capturing the event in six
minutes, 10 seconds.

The battle for second place
proved to be extremely tight.
After a slow start through the
first 1,000 meters, Stanford
gained nearly a boatlength on
Washington in the last half of
the race. After racing 2,000
meters in 63-foot shells, Stan
ford's varsity was edged for sec
ond place by a mere four inches
by Washington.
"We didn't have our rhythm
— our swing — at the start,"
junior Jim Fox said. "Halfway
through the race we had Cal and
Davis on either side of us when
we starting picking it up. Our
sprint was the best sprint of the
year. If we would've had one
more stroke, we would've had
[Washington]."
Stanford's varsity men typi
cally start quickly, and their
poor start yesterday may have
been attributed to both the op
pressive Sacramento weather
and starting delays in both of

Stanford's heats. Saturday's
preliminary heat was held up for
more than an hour while crews
baked in 100-plus degree weath
er.
Stanford won its opening heat
Saturday, defeating second-place
UC-Davis by three seconds.
However, the heat — and the
heat — took its toll on most of
the rowers. Fox noted that one
of the Stanford rowers was sick
following Saturday's race, and
many were dehydrated.
Stanford men's Coach Ken
Dreyfuss said the close finish
was disappointing for the crew,
but he said Stanford has signif
icantly narrowed the gap against
top opponents, such as UCLA.
Stanford's varsity men have
beaten California in three of four
meetings this year — including
a dramatic victory in the annual
Big Row. With five varsity
starters and nearly an entire
junior varsity boat returning,

the varsity men will be eyeing
a Pac-10 title next year.
Stanford's junior varsity men
finished fourth in its Grand
Final heat, but finished a strong
second in its preliminary heat
to eventual junior varsity cham
pion Washington Saturday. The
freshman-eight boat suffered a
setback in its race yester
day, breaking an oarlock 700
meters into the race and finish
ing sixth in a frustrating final
heat. «
Stanford's novice women
proved to be the best of the West,
winning their preliminary heat
and defeating perennial favorite
Washington in the Grand Final
by seven seconds. Women's
coach John Davis was obviously
pleased with the success of the
undefeated novice-eight boat,
guided by his assistant coach and
wife, Wendy.

Wendy Davis had returned to
coaching duties this season after
taking a year off to train for the
national team. With the help of
assistant Debbie Knoblock, a
recent graduate of the Syracuse
rowing program, Davis guided the
women's novice crew to an unde
feated season and gold medals at
the San Diego Crew Classic and
a Pac-10 title. The novice-four
boat added a silver medal, losing
by less than a boat-length to
Puget Sound.
Stanford's varsity women, beset
with injuries and illness through
out the season, managed a fourth
place finish in yesterday's Grand
Final. Washington led from the
opening strokes, winning by 13
seconds over second-place Califor
nia.
Washington also finished ahead
of Stanford in the women's junior
varsity final. However, the Car
dinal's second-place finish
avenged an earlier loss to third
place California.
