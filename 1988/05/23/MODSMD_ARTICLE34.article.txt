"The high jump is 90 percent
mental, once one has reached the
elite level. If you don't have the
confidence that you can do it,
you 're not going to be successful."
— Lisa Bernhagen
"The high jump is a violent
event."
— Stanford Asst. Coach
Dave Wollman
The truth is that many of us
rarely think much about track
and field, or even less, the high
jump. Most people do not know
who the premier world high
jumpers are, or what serious high
jump competition involves. Nor do
most of us understand the phys
ical pitfalls and dangers inherent
in the high jump or the mental
toughness that the high jumper
must possess.
A good place for all of us to
begin our high jump education is
with senior Lisa Bernhagen, the
Stanford track and field team's
own world-class high jumper.
The origins of this lesson date
back to when Bernhagen tried the
event for the first time in eighth
grade. A left-hander, Bernhagen
unknowingly began running the
event from the wrong side, equiv
alent to a basketball player at
tempting a layup off the wrong
foot. However, it was one of the
most fortuitous mistakes of her
life.
"Everybody was in line to do
the high jump. . . . Everybody was
on the right-hand side so I started
there. It came very easily."
Upon trying the left-hand ap
proach later on, Bernhagen found
it very awkward, and to this day
she has not tried a left-side jump.
But why tamper with success?
That very year Bernhagen won
the national title for her age group
with a formidable jump of five
feet, six inches. Not bad for a girl
from the small town of Hailey,
Idaho, to be nationally known
before entering high school.
Bernhagen's success in the high
jump continued to grow. In 1983
she was honored as the Track and
Field News High School Athlete
of the Year. By the end of her
high school career Bernhagen had

jumped an incredible 6-3.
"Every year I'd improve a cou
ple of inches, which was nice,"
Bernhagen said. "Put a little into
it and get a lot out of it. Now I
put a lot into it and if I get a
little out of it I'm happy. So it's
catching up with me."
Indeed the high jump required
an amazingly small amount of
practice time for Bernhagen in
high school. "In high school I
didn't spend that much time at
all doing high jump. I did it about
once a week maybe, working on
technique and jumping. ... It was
pretty easy."
Bernhagen's high jump practice
time was cut short through ne
cessity. Bernhagen spent much of
her time working at her sprints,
as Wood River High School's track
team needed points in the running
events as well. This hard work
was not without reward — Bern
hagen attained a 100-meter sprint
time of 12.1 seconds.
She is quick to attribute part
of her early development to her
high school coach. "It was good
because we learned the event to
gether. So he was my friend and
he was my coach and he under
stood me. He understood the fears
I had about it, which weren't
many in high school."
As all Stanford students find,
however, Bernhagen discovered
that college involves many
changes and a whole new level of
competition.
"It was easy in high school
when I was number one. ... I
didn't really have a lot of pres
sure; I didn't have to compete
that much. I just competed
against myself," said Bernhagen.
"But now people are there with
me at six feet, 6-2. It's a totally
different situation. It takes a lot
to adapt to. It's just been a big
mental game, getting through it."
Bernhagen seems to be 100 per
cent in control of this mental
game, however. In 1985, Bern
hagen set the Stanford freshman
high jump record at 6-0 and qual
ified for nationals. In 1986, she
broke her own school record,
clearing and went on to
win the NCAA Indoor Champion
ship with a jump of 6-3V4.
Perhaps the peak of Bern
hagen's collegiate track career oc

curred in February 1987 when
she leaped 6-sVfc, setting a new
indoor collegiate record.
Bernhagen retains a very real
istic view of things, despite her
meteoric success. More impor
tantly, she successfully performs
that most difficult balancing act
with which all Stanford athletes
must cope — the competing de
mands of schoolwork and athletic
practice.
Bernhagen currently is com
pleting a degree in sociology,
focusing on organizational
behavior, and considering the pos
siblity of a Master's degree in the
program. Bernhagen also spends
three or more hours a day prac
ticing the high jump, conditioning

her body and fighting injuries and
pain in the training room.
Bernhagen takes her classwork
seriously. "Track's not going to
get me very far in life," she said.
"I want to do both well. I think
having a B average and being an
athlete here is doing well."
She has the Cardinal's goals in
mind as well as her own.
"In track, support for the team
shows at practice, because at the
meet everyone is alone in their
own event," Wollman said. "Bern
hagen is very supportive during
practice for the rest of the team."
This atmosphere, Wollman
said, is necessary for developing
the younger athletes on the team.
"Her influence on the younger

kids is very, very positive. She
doesn't hold back any," Wollman
said. "They look up to her. It is
very inspiring."
Wollman is a coach with whom
she can work well, benefiting from
his experience and retaining her
own style and personality in the
event.
Wollman may be a rare find for
what Bernhagen calls the high
jumper type. "We (high jumpers)
are more individualistic," said
Bernhagen. "We think on our own
and we don't go with the flow.
We need an outlet to question,
and we need a coach that will let
us do that."
Wollman will be the coach who
accompanies Bernhagen to the

1988 Olympic Summer Games,
should she qualify. Both Wollman
and Bernhagen have the Olympics
on their minds every day now.
The Olympic trials are in In
dianapolis on July 23, and Bern
hagen and her coach know that
there is only one thing that will
keep her from putting forth her
best effort to make the three
person Olympic squad.
In May of 1987, at the Modesto
Relays track meet, Bernhagen
severely sprained the ankle of her
take-off foot during warmups.
"At first I didn't think it was
a big deal," Bernhagen said. "I
got up and was walking over to
