# Researchers bemoan equipment loss after colleague's exit
## 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Some Stanford researchers are worried
that Electrical Engineering Prof. John
Madey's plans to leave the University
will halt their research.
It became public last week that Madey,
inventor of the free-electron laser, will
move his full-time research to Duke Uni
versity by this fall. He announced plans
to take several members of his research
ing staff with him, as well as what he
estimated to be $20 million of equipment
owned by the federal government. How
ever, Robert Byer, director of research
and applied physics, estimated the value
of the equipment to be $7 million.
Madey's announcement brought atten
tion to the recent controversy in the Stan
ford community about the amount of

overhead costs the University charges its
researchers.
Madey has been unavailable for com
ment since last week because he is at an
electrical engineering convention in Salt
Lake City.
The quantity and quality of available
equipment are the biggest concern for
Stanford researchers, according to Byer.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Richard
Pantell said Madey's departure with the
equipment will "certainly be a disrup
tion." Pantell studies the interaction be
tween particle beams and waves, and
relies on the facilities Madey has as
sembled.
The University has been working to
reassemble equipment for Pantell since
last fall, when Madey privately notified
the University that he would be quitting
and taking the equipment.

It is a loss because Madey is an original, creative
scientist.... Hopefully we will attract others.'
— Theodore Geballe

Madey is currently working on an
electron storage ring, an oval that holds
electrons for use in experiments. The
Mark 111 linear accelerator, an application
of the free-electron laser that is 85 per
cent complete, would act as an iryector
for the storage ring, according to Byer.
Madey's research has potential uses in
medicine, chemistry, pharmaceuticals,
electronics, energy and beam weaponry.
Pantell said the removal of the equip
ment, which may include the Mark 111,
will impede his work. Pantell is currently

applying for grants to reassemble the
equipment, which he expects will cost
around $400,000 and will delay his work
for six months to a year.
Although assembling the equipment
will require a lot of money and expertise,
Pantell does not plan to leave the Uni
versity.
Another researcher whose work may
be squeezed soon is Electrical Engineer
ing Prof. William Spicer, who said his
current work is not directly affected by
Madey's departure but that future plans

will be affected. Spicer said he had
planned to use Madey's storage ring when
it was done, but now will have to continue
to use the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Laboratory, a federal facility located
on Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
property.
Applied Physics Prof. Theodore Geballe
said research may go in other directions
without the Mark 111. He speculated
there will be less emphasis on high
powered infra red research.
But Geballe said the loss goes beyond
the equipment. "It is a loss because
Madey is an original, creative scientist,"
he said. "Hopefully we will attract
others."
According to Geballe, the University is
currently looking to fill Madey's position.
The replacement will not neces
sarily do the same type of re
search, however.
But there is concern that it will
be difficult to attract top profes
sors to Stanford because of its
high overhead costs. Madey said
a main reason he decided to leave
Stanford was its high research
overhead costs, known as indirect
costs.
Indirect costs include adminis
trative costs, capital depreciation,
libraries, student services and op
erations and maintenance. At 73
percent, Stanford currently has
one of the highest indirect cost
rates in the nation, second only
to Columbia. Duke's rate is 50
percent.
Since 1983, Madey has received
more than $11 million in grants
— more than any other Stanford
professor — to work on applica
tions of the free-electron laser,
which is a key component of the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
The exact number of Madey's

estimated team of 30 researchers
who will leave with him is unclear,
according to Susan Hill, Madey's
administrative assistant. Hill said
she plans to follow Madey if Duke,
which is now making formal of
fers, gives her a position.
