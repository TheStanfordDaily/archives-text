# Candidates clash over defense spending cuts
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Six of the seven candidates for
the 12th Congressional District
seat said they agree that defense
spending must be cut to reduce
the deficit, but differed on where
those cuts should be made during
a candidates' forum held here this
weekend.
Stanford Law Prof. Tom Camp
bell, the only representative from
the Republican camp, and all five
Democratic candidates were fea
tured in a Saturday morning dis
cussion in Kresge Auditorium.
The Democratic contenders in
clude Clary Bond, Anna Eshoo,
Jim Garrison, Ernest Marias and
Sylvia Simmons.
Incumbent Republican Ernie
Konnyu declined to appear, saying
that his position on defense
spending is well known, according
to Nancy Rodgers, a representa
tive from Common Cause, one of
the sponsors of the debate.
While Konnyu has voted for
every defense program that has
come before him in Congress, ac
cording to Campbell, the Repub
lican challenger said he would

work to trim the budget deficit
by paring down defense spending.
According to Campbell, the re
duction of the budget deficit is
the key economic concern for the
future of the American economy.
Reducing the deficit will "mean
cuts, both of defense and social
spending," Campbell said. But, he
urged that the cuts be made
proportionately in both aspects of
the budget.
Eshoo likened problems in the
defense budget today to those she
has wrestled with as a Santa Clara
County supervisor. She said she
wants to increase congressional
oversight of defense programs
once they are underway. Accord
ing to Eshoo, her experience shut
ting down inefficient, govern
ment-financed programs would
help her decide where to make
cuts in federal programs.
Eshoo said she would vote
against specific defense programs,
including the Strategic Defense
Initiative and the MX missile be
cause they are unnecessary pro
grams which waste federal funds.
In addition, she said the develop
ment of an SDI system violates
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
that the United States and the
Soviet Union signed in 1972.
Instead of arguing for changes
in defense spending on a yearly
basis, Garrison said there needs
to be a fundamental change in
how the government views de
fense spending.
According to Garrison, the gov
ernment needs to decide which
particular programs it wants to
support instead of arguing over
how much it wants to spend over
all.
Congress should put "the Pen
tagon on a competitive level" by
increasing competition among
companies seeking defense con
tracts, he said.
Specifically, Garrison said he
would seek to reduce the United
States' nuclear arsenal by 75 per
cent, increase competitive bidding
on defense contracts and intro
duce a weapons warranty system.
A weapons warranty system

would make defense contractors
liable for any defects in systems
they developed.
Simmons proposed that the
United States force its allies to
assume a greater portion of re
sponsibility for their own defense.
For example, Simmons said
U.S. allies should help pay for
U.S. operations in the Persian
Gulf. Japan, in particular, must
be responsible in paying for
the protection of Kuwaiti tankers
bringing oil to its shores.
The forum was sponsored by
the Economics of National Secu
rity Project, a joint project of the
Center for Economic Conversion,
Common Cause, the New Forum
and Physicians for Social Respon
sibility.
Both University President
Donald Kennedy and Sidney
Drell, associate director of SLAC,
sit on the project's advisory board.
The project was founded "to ex
amine defense contracting in
Santa Clara County as a compo
nent of the economy as a whole,
and its relationship to the social,
educational and cultural needs of
the county," according to its
literature.
