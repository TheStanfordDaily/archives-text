They phoned home, they phoned friends and they phoned alumni all over the United States to raise money for
Stanford at the Sixth Annual Spring Telethon. They phoned fur fun as well as fur funds.
More than 500 Stanford students, alumni and friends gathered amidst balloons and bells for a sulid week of
calling May 9 through May 15, 1988.
We'd like to thank our special coaches who made guest appearances to cheer on the callers: Roy Anderson, '47,
one of the Centennial Campaign Co-Chairs; Hank Higgs 57, Vice President for Development; and John Ford "71,
incoming Vice President for Development.

enough to earn easily the $100,000 matching grant offered as a challenge by Contessa Bonin Longare, '32, whose
Stanford history extends back to her mother's graduation in 1896!
Individuals and groups vied for numerous prizes donated by many generous Bay Area merchants and
organizations, including lunches hosted by Stanford faculty members and a hot-air balloon ride offered by
alumnus Al Amsbaugh, '60. Callers walked away not only with a tangible prize but also with the satisfaction of
knowing that they had contributed to something important.
The Office of Development wishes to thank all those who helped make the Sixth Annual Telethon a resounding
success. In particular, grateful thanks to student Telethon Chair Karin Fahlman, '88, members of the student
telethon committee, the callers, the clerks and other Telethon helpers for the many hours they donated to
support Stanford.
