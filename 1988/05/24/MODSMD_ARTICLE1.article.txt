# AIDS test counseling problems
## Cowell treats test inequities 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
In response to suggestions from medical experts
and students, Cowell Student Health Center this
week took steps to reach students tested for AIDS
last year who may not have received proper coun
seling.
In an attempt to rectify the'lack of post-test
counseling for students who took AIDS antibody
tests at Cowell before October, 1987, Cowell ad
ministrators yesterday placed an advertisment in
The Daily advising persons who did not receive
counseling to discuss their test results with the
doctors who administered the tests.
Dr. Alejandro Martinez, University manager of
Student Health Services, said the advertisement
was largely a response to concerns raised by students
about the Cowell AIDS testing program prior to
October of 1987. There were concerns that the
students tested "had not been thoroughly advised
of the implications" of their results, he said. Cowell
currently has both pre-test and post-test counseling
for students who take the AIDS test.
Post-test counseling is important because there
is often confusion about what an antibody test
result means. Positive test results do not necessarily
mean a person has AIDS, but instead indicate only
that he or she was exposed to the AIDS virus and
the body produced antibodies to it. Negative results
may mean that a person has not been infected with
the virus or that he or she was infected and the
body has not yet produced antibodies.
Martinez said there is a "general consensus that
very thorough pre-test counseling ... and some
post-test counseling" did take place at Cowell, al
though the post-test counseling was not provided
consistently.
Dr. Richard Keeling, chair of the American College
Health Association Task Force on AIDS, visited
Stanford last October and suggested to Cowell of
ficials counseling procedures for students tested for
AIDS, Martinez said. He said Keeling "made us
aware" of the lack of post-test counseling and senior
Daniel Bao, director of the AIDS Education Project,
pressed for a post-test counseling procedure.
Bao said the advertisement in The Daily was good
but does.not solve the entire problem, particularly
for those graduated seniors who took the test and
may not read The Daily anymore. He said the only
proper solution would be to have all the doctors
who administered the tests call their patients and
offer to discuss the test results. However, Bao said
Cowell was reluctant to do this because of the
financial costs.
However, Cowell Director Paul Walters said that
confidentiality prevented doctors from making those
calls. In order to track down all those students,
some of whom probably changed their residence,
the doctor would have to work with the help of
others, thus revealing the identity of the students.
Bao questioned the purpose of AIDS testing at
Cowell, saying that state and county agencies al
ready provide those services with complete
anonymity. At Cowell, the test results are placed
in a confidential file that is available to physicians.
Bao said testing at Cowell poorly
duplicates public services and the
money devoted to such tests could
better be used for education pro
grams.
Walters said Cowell is consid
ering action to give the test
results to the student, rather than
keeping the records on file. He
emphasized, however, that it is
impossible to achieve "complete
anonymity" at Stanford because
of the small size of the commu
nity.
Walters said AIDS testing at
Cowell is a necessary service to
the community. "If a student
wants to go to his doctor, we'll
do it,"he said. He said Cowell
"offers a full range of medical
services" and Student Health
Services should allow the student
to "feel that they can get their
care at Cowell."
Junior Susan Charette, who
with medical student Jonathan
Mermin helped Cowell officials ar
range the advertisement, said the
display was not meant to solve
the problem, but was an effort to
reach some of the people who did
not receive adequate counseling
last year.
