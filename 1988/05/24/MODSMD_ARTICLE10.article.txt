# Meyer library goes on self-improvement kick

### Kevin Wacknov 
Meyer Library, long the target
of jokes and student criticism,
continues to undergo renovation
and reappraisal as University of
ficials attempt to improve the li
brary's structure and operations.
The 19-year-old library has
been undergoing redesign and re
evaluation for the past two years.
Further improvements are
planned, with the possibility of
structural renovation be
ginning in five years.
Library officials have a multi
faceted vision for Meyer. The
plans for the library include the
following:
• Reducing the number and
raising the quality of the books
in the collection;
• Creating a media center that
will serve the entire library sys
tem;
• Distinguishing clearly be
tween social areas and study
areas.
These so-called "programmatic
changes" for Meyer have already
been approved by the Stanford
library system.
In addition, one change already

made this year — limiting public
access to the library — will remain
in effect, and Meyer will continue
to serve as the reserves center for
all courses.
Meyer Office Assistant Kathy
Fern cited a number of problems
with the library, including poor
janitorial service; noisy study
areas; offices, books and comput
ers all vying for space and "com
pressed audio-visual equipment
and old language-lab equipment
isolated from the reference
people."
Estimated to begin around
1993, changes to Meyer library
may include moving audio-visual
services near the reference desk
on the second floor, adding a 24-
hour study area, student lounge
and snack bar, and establishing
classrooms in the upper floors of
the library that could be used and
scheduled by library staff. All the
classrooms on the bottom floor of
Meyer currently are scheduled by
the University Registrar.
Susan Periy, chief librarian at
Meyer, said that library officials
have just begun to talk to ar-
chitects about renovations.
Michael Ryan, director of col
lections development for the Stan
ford library system, said the proc
ess of reducing the number of
books at Meyer might entail as
much as a 50-percent cut in the
collection.
"We're going to weed the col
lection radically, from about
200,000 to about 100,000
volumes," he said.
Ryan said he sees the Meyer
collection as a set of "introduc
tory, key, basic, indispensible
texts" for all the disciplines
taught on campus, at all academic
levels.
The library has undergone a
few other changes in recent years.
Office space has been reallocated,
and Macintosh computers have
been installed in and around the
stack and studying areas.
This year the Forum Room,
Meyer 124, was equipped with so
phisticated presentation equip
ment for medium-sized groups.
The largest change in Meyer in
the past 15 years was the instal
lation of the fourth-floor IBM PC
classroom, which is "paid for and
controlled by the Registrar's Of
fice," according to Fern.
