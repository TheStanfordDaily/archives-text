# Correction

### 
Because of an editor's error, a
story in yesterday's Daily
misquoted Otero Resident Assis
tant Jeff Sloan as saying that
freshman Kenny Ehrman helped
make a T-shirt that said "WASP
by popular demand." Ehrman did
not make the shirt, and Sloan did
not say that he did. The Daily
apologizes for the error. Also,
Ehrman vandalized of the Otero
lounge May 15, not March 15.
