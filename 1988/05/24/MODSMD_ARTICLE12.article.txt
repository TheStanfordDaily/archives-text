Ligachev hacks reform policies
MOSCOW — The Soviet Communist Party
gave Mikhail Gorbachev, the party's general
secretary, a far-reaching mandate yesterday
to pursue his policies for the country's radical
political, economic and social transformation
despite widespread opposition within the
party's own ranks.
Yegor Ligachev, the party's chief ideologist
and an occasional critic of the scope and speed
of Gorbachev's reforms, said after a two-hour
meeting of the party's policy-making Central
Committee that it had adopted Gorbachev's
program with its sweeping commitment to
change.
"Important decisions were made," Ligachev
declared, referring to plans to convene a special
party conference beginning June 28 to map a
reform strategy that will carry the country
into the 21st Century while accelerating its
political and economic restructuring.
Because Ligachev made the announcement,
the assumed split within the leadership over
reforms appeared to have been healed, and
the conservative opposition to Gorbachev was
left without a significant power base, a leader
or a press representative.
In terms of Kremlin politics, Gorbachev
seemed to have won a particularly significant
victory — one that could determine the fate
of his reforms and, eventually, the future of
the Soviet Union.
Gorbachev, in an interview last week with
editors of The Washington Post and Newsweek
magazine, had left little doubt of his intention
to firmly establish his authority within the
party's ruling Politburo, the Central Commit
tee and the whole power structure. But he
had acknowledged widespread "resistance"
from those doubting the wisdom of his course
and others opposed to the speed of change.
West Bank schools reopened
RAMALLAH, Israeli-Occupied West Bank —
Israel's military administration reopened
elementary schools in the occupied West Bank
yesterday, but Palestinian educators and an
Israeli legislator charged that soldiers had
damaged property in about 30 schools.
Nearly 200,000 Arab children streamed back
to classes at 612 elementary schools and kin
dergartens without incident in what Israeli
officials said was the best indication yet that
the 5-month-long Palestinian uprising is run
ning out of steam. Attendance ran at 70 to
90 percent, authorities said.
Many Palestinians also seem eager to keep
schools reopened, however, and a new leaflet
issued by a shadowy steering committee that
has guided the protests called the reopenings
a "glorious victory" for Palestinians and di
rected students to return peacefully.
The schools have been among the many
battlefields in the conflict that began last De
cember between the army and Palestinian
youths for control of the streets of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. But some of the same
dirty-faced 10 and 12-year-olds who a month
ago were wielding rocks and bottles and com
manding the alleys of this West Bank town
and others like it this morning looked well
scrubbed and neatly dressed, wielding only
school books and bookbags.
