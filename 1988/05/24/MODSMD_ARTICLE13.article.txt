# Shultz asks for INF treaty vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Secretary
of State George Shultz and
Senate Republican leaders
called on GOP conservatives
yesterday to abandon delaying
tactics and allow the Senate to
vote on the Intermediate-
Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty in time for ratification
at the Moscow summit starting
Sunday.
But GOP critics of the pact
continued offering amend
ments that were defeated by
lopsided margins, and Senate
leaders conceded that complet
ing action on the pact will be
impossible before President
Reagan leaves tomorrow for a
stopover in Finland en route
to the Soviet Union.
Instead, pro-INF strategists

expressed hope that the Senate
will give its expected approval
by late this week, which would
allow time for formal ratifica
tion by Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev
before the summit ends June 2.
After meetings with Senate
Republicans that included
mostly treaty supporters,
Shultz said Senate failure to
ratify the treaty before the
summit could "take a little of
the edge off" of the meeting,
during which both superpow
ers have said they hope to make
further progress on arms con
trol.
"There's a time to inquire,
and there's a time to vote,"
Shultz said.
