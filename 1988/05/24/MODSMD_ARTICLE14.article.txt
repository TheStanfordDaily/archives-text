# Panama talks resume

### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan
sent his envoy back to Panama yesterday
in a new bid to induce Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega to step aside, and, despite Reagan's
denial that there is a deadline, U.S. officials
said they hoped that a deal could be reached
before the president leaves tomorrow for
the Moscow summit.
The goal, the officials said, is an agree
ment that would see Noriega leave Panama
until the presidential elections scheduled
next May in exchange for the United States
dropping drug-trafficking indictments
against him. But the officials also admitted
that the deal would permit Noriega's hand
picked representative to run Panama dur
ing his absence.
In a bow to Noriega's domestic opposi
tion, the United States would continue to
recognize Eric Arturo Delvalle, deposed by
Noriega in February, as Panama's legal
president until a transitional "national rec
onciliation government" is formed.
However, Delvalle's ambassador here,
Juan Sosa, told The Washington Post yes
terday that Elliott Abrams, assistant sec
retary of state for inter-American affairs,
told him that, as part of this arrangement,
the United States would bow to Noriega's

insistence that Manuel Solis Palma, in
stalled as provisional president after Del
valle's ouster, would continue to exercise
presidential powers until the transitional
government is established.
Sosa charged that this would enable Nor
iega, working through Solis Palma, to con
trol the ostensible reconciliation govern
ment.
The ambassador released a statement by
Delvalle, who is in hiding in Panama, warn
ing that he would reject any unilateral U.S.
deal that allows Noriega to continue to
exert power. He charged that the kind of
deal being pursued by the administration
"would mortgage the future of Panama for
a long time to come."
Reagan, in a brief exchange with
reporters at a White House ceremony,
denied that Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State Michael Kozak, who left for Panama
early yesterday, had been instructed to
press for a deal before the president departs
for Moscow.
"We're not going by time; we're going
by quality," Reagan said. "Nothing's been
settled; it's still in the works."
