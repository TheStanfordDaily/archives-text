# Panel releases report on status of minorities
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - A panel of polit
ical, business and education leaders
issued a bleak assessment yesterday
of the status of minorities in this coun
try and warned that "America is mov
ing backward" in efforts to achieve
equality for blacks, Hispanics and Na
tive Americans.
"In education, employment, income,
health, longevity and other basic meas
ures of individual and social well
being, gaps persist — and in some
cases are widening — between mem
bers of minority groups and the
majority population," the report said.
The commission, whose honorary
chairmen were former presidents
Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, rec
ommended several strategies, includ
ing renewed efforts to recruit minority
students into higher education, "a new
vision" of affirmative action and ex

panded leadership within the minority
community.
The Commission on Minority Par
ticipation in Education and American
Life, formed by the American Council
on Education and the Education Com
mission of the States, released its
report at a news conference. It recom
mended as a goal that the nation
achieve equality of life for minorities
within 20 years.
While similar messages have been
issued in the past, commission mem
bers said theirs was the first to reflect
a heightened, bipartisan concern about
the problem. It also marked the be
ginning of an ongoing program by the
sponsoring organizations to close the
gap between the minority and majority
populations, panel members said.
"We're in this for the long haul,"
council President Robert Atwell said.

contending that educators like himself
"will be involved in this issue for the
rest of our professional lives."
The commission report pointed to
rapid growth in the minority popula
tion: By the year 2000, 42 percent of
the nation's public school students will
be minority children.
But significant disparities exist in
economic and social welfare between
minority and msyority populations, the
report said. Poverty rates among
blacks and Hispanics, for example, are
nearly three times that for whites,
according to 1986 figures. Also, the
unemployment rate among blacks in
1986 was 14.5 percent, more than
twice the 6 percent figure for whites.
The panel, while noting improve
ments in minority status during recent
decades, cited "stalled progress" in
higher education.

Between 1975 and 1985, while the
college participation rate of young
whites climbed to 55 percent, the rate
for blacks dropped to 44 percent. The
rate increased to 47 percent for blacks
in 1986 but remains below the 1975
rate of 48 percent, according to the
report.
"After examining all the available
evidence," said Cornell University
President Frank Rhodes, who headed
the commission, "we have reached this
disturbing conclusion: We're moving
backward, not forward, in our efforts
to achieve the full participation of mi
nority citizens in the life and
prosperity of the nation."
Two commission members, Missouri
Gov. John Ashcroft and former Sec
retary of State William Rogers, refused
to sign the report.
