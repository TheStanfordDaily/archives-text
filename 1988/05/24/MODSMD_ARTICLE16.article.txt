# Jackson unveils five-year federal budget plan
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO — Jesse Jackson
yesterday unveiled a five-year federal
budget that would shift hundreds of
billions of dollars in spending from
defense to domestic programs, would
raise hundreds of billions in taxes on
corporations and wealthy individuals,
and would reduce the deficit by about

two-thirds.
He said it was a
document Demo
crats could "rally
around" as they
head toward their
convention in At
lanta this summer.
"We cannot be
fooled into think
ing the Reagan-
Bush deficits make

social justice impossible," Jackson said
at a press conference here, as he pre

sented a budget blueprint far more
detailed than those offered by other
presidential candidates this season. It
was studded with graphs, footnotes
and line-item descriptions of new pro
grams.
He also stepped up his attacks on
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
whom he accused of taking a "radically
conservative" approach to such social
needs as housing, education, drug
rehabilitation and infrastructure in
vestment.
Jackson said he hoped that by high
lighting his differences with Dukakis
he would enhance his chances of pull
ing off an upset in the June 7 primary
here. But aides acknowledge that the
realistic goal of their campaign at this
stage is lobbying Dukakis and trying
to influence the party platform.
In that effort, they face in Dukakis

a Democratic nominee-presumptive
who often talks in expansive language
— he says, for example, that college
scholarships and decent housing are
"birthrights" of every American — but
has offered less than $1 billion in new
domestic spending proposals. He ap
pears reluctant to commit to much
beyond that, out of fear of being
branded a big-spender by Republicans
in the fall.
Several Jackson aides said they do
not yet have a sense of how hard their
candidate will push these issues at the
covnention, but added that he is more
likely to take on these basic issues of
spending priorites than he is on "proc
ess" issues such as party rules.
Even though Dukakis has navigated
his way through 46 state primaries
and caucuses with his modest agenda,
Jackson said Monday he was "con

vinced that (Dukakis's) cautious ap
proach is not very well understood by
the American public."
Jackson proposed $32 billion in new
domestic spending in the first year of
his budget plan, and $344 billion over
five years. He would increse funding
for a war on drugs by 71 percent,
double the education budget, spend
$57 billion more on various welfare
and income assistance payments, $11
billion more to find a cure for AIDS,
$53 billion more on housing, $40 bil
lion more on health and nutrition pro
grams, and $26 billion more to provide
child care programs to 3 million more
children.
Jackson's blueprint would decrease
the federal budget deficit to under $50
billion by 1993.
