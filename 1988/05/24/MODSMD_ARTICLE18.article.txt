## Keep the spirit 
### 
CLARITY of language is es
sential for agreement and
understanding â€” especially
for faculty members formulating
CIV legislation.
Last week, another amendment
to the Cultures, Ideas and Values
legislation was proposed to the
Faculty Senate. This time, the
bone of contention is an existing
clause requiring that race, eth
nicity and gender be considered as
factors in the hiring of new faculty.
Before this debate goes any fur
ther or gets blurred, it needs to
be cleared up.
As the hiring clause currently
reads, it conflicts with the Univer
sity's non-discrimination clause.
The Academic Freedom states that
an applicant's race, sex or ethnic
origin should not be taken into
consideration as hiring criteria.
However, much like the CIV leg
islation itself, the hiring provision
must be read for its intent and
not literal meaning.
The spirit of the hiring clause
is not to simply consider a faculty
applicant's pigmentation, accent,
surname or chromosomes in their
evaluation.
What is meant is to consider the
applicant's ethnicity, race and
gender as it applies to their intel
lectual and academic perspective.
This is a perfectly legitimate cri

terion for evaluation.
To resolve this legislative con
flict of interpretation, the CIV wor
ding should be clarified.
The CIV hiring clause should re
quire that an applicant's perspec
tives on race, ethnicity and gender
be factors in their evaluation.
This is a direct product of the
philosophy of the CIV compromise.
At the heart of the CIV legislation
is the firm belief that how a work
or theme is taught is even more
important than what the work or
theme is.
This interpretation of the CIV
hiring clause is consistent with the
overall spirit of the document.
Then, with the emphasis on in
tellectual perspective, the spirit of
CIV will be ensured through fac
ulty hiring and any confusion over
quotas or politics will be avoided.
Those faculty senators who are
calling for the removal of "race,
ethnicity and gender" from the
CIV hiring clause must be called
into question. They must be asked
whether they think those three fac
tors are essential to the spirit of
CIV.
If these factors are not impor
tant, the senators' opportunity to
express this ended with the pas
sage of CIV.
If they are, why not clarify the
wording of the clause?
