## Drugs affect everyone 
### 
WHEN, AT A Coast Guard grad
uation last week, President
Reagan declared drugs to be
"America's number one problem," he
may have been exaggerating but he was
certainly reflecting a new trend among
public officials.
Getting tough on drugs is the hot new
political issue. The expected party
nominees are rushing to show their com
mitment to preventing drug use and
abuse, and Congress has recently taken
steps to give the military a more active
role in reducing the flow of narcotics into
this country.
The increased attention that the drug
problem is getting this election doesn't
come as a surprise. Polls show that most
Americans view with increasing concern
the effects illegal drugs of all kinds are
having on our society.
The adverse consequences of America's
huge dope intake are felt in two basic
and disparate ways. On the one hand,
there is the growth of massive criminal
networks being supported by illegal sub
stance trade.
Average law-abiding citizens fear being
victims of the violent crimes bred by the
illegal transactions — if you're from a
city you read daily about drug/gang
related killings, often of innocent
bystanders or the attacks (muggings, as
saults and killings) by drug addicts des
perate to support their habits.
And our treasury could sorely use the
uncountable sums of money that are cur
rently being siphoned out of our country
to fill the pockets of drug bosses from
Columbia to Brooklyn.

On the other hand, there is the tragic
loss of human potential. The young poor
of our country are being attracted in
increasing numbers to the financial
benefits of dealing. An even larger per
centage of our population is being drained
of its productive capacity.
While most of the country is convinced
of the growing seriousness of the drug
problem, many Stanford students retain
a schizophrenic attitude toward the sub
stances themselves.
Viewed at the societal level, most stu
dents are as unhappy about the growing
abuse of drugs in this country, and the
resultant violence, as anyone else.
However, for most of us, it is easy to
separate drug use at Stanford from the
greater problems of drug use throughout
the nation. Most of the drugs used by
students are not immediately addictive,
so those who have tried them know that
it is possible to snort or smoke occasion
ally and not have their world fall apart.
In fact, the Stanford student's use of
ecstasy or cocaine to enhance a weekend
experience couldn't seem further from
the poor gang kids who live and die to
peddle the stuff.
But it is only a convenient illusion of
conscience that separates the two. By
choice or not, use of drugs here is inex
tricably linked to the national problem
of drug abuse and the disastrous side
effects.
Yes, we the upper-middle-class (or
soon-to-be) of America — I know you
hate to admit that's you but it is —
provide the profit that sustains the drug
world.

On a concrete level, buying drugs
finances the same network of thugs that
commits the crimes we all fear being
victims of. The money we pay for drugs
is the incentive to the nation's poor youth
to leave school and deal.
Moreover, for a group of people aspir
ing to leadership positions we set a pitiful
example in the art of self-restraint. If as
students, with every advantage of the
world waiting for us and with an abun
dance of activities ready to fill our leisure
time, we can't sacrifice the most frivolous
of our fancies — getting high — how can
we expect the poor and the down and
out to resist the temptations of escape
that the drugs have to offer?
Don't get me wrong, this is not a Nancy
Reagan morality lecture on the evils of
doing drugs. It is a reminder though that
while abstinence or consumption of drugs
is a personal choice, it is naive or blind
to believe it doesn't have widespread con
sequences.
From our idyllic community, we look
out and see the drug problem housed in
the poor dirty neighborhoods where we
will never live and think that somebody's
got to clean up the mess. But, the truth
is, our drug habit is the drug problem.
