## Quotas should not be used in fight against racism 
### 
CCf HAVE A DREAM that my
I four little children will one day
Alive in a nation where they will
not be judged by the color of their
skin but by the content of their char
acter."
Martin Luther King, Jr., who
believed in these words in 1963 was
considered "liberal," or "progressive."
One who believes in them today risks
being branded at best, naive, at worst,
racist.
Last week, protesters at Stanford
Law School demanded that the Law
School judge professors not on the
content of their character but on the
color of their skin.
They were following Harvard stu
dents (when will we learn?) who
demanded that in hiring decisions for

seven new professors, race should be
the sole factor in their selection. Law
School Dean Paul Brest is to be com
mended for resisting the legitimization
of such racism.
The other day, I overheard a friend
commenting on Law School admissions.
He used the term "good racism." Naive
reactionary that I am, I had always
considered all forms of racism and
prejudice to be wrong.
Apparently, prejudice is neither bad
nor good. It all depends — on which
ethnic group it is helping, and which it
is hurting.
Unfortunately, there is not a suffi
cient supply of Caucasians to sacrifice
to quotas. As recent events at Berkeley
have shown, racial engineering for
statistical purposes that helps certain

minority groups will come at the ex
pense of others.
As California becomes more than 50
percent "minority" in the 21st century,
it is foolish to limit anyone because of
his or her ethnic background.
Why not examine the qualifications
of all people equally, giving special
consideration to those whose back
ground has been characterized by
disadvantage — something to which no
race, religion or creed is immune?
As an undergraduate, I have been
fortunate to have heard both a minor
ity and female member of the .Law
School faculty. They are people of
exceptional ability. But they are here
not for their race or for their gender,
but for their ideas.

The obstacles to minority success are
both formidable and deplorable. But we
must realize what the goal of a just
society is. It is not to have a fixed
percentage of success (income, profes
sorships, etc.) attained by each and
every ethnic group according to its
fertility rate.
It is to have a color-blind society
where the criterion in a hiring decision
is merit, not race.
To be sure, we are not there yet.
But by formalizing such race
consciousness through the means of
hiring quotas, we are institutionalizing
previous ways of prejudice, and delay
ing the achievement of Martin Luther
King's dream.
