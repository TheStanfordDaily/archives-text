# Don't downplay role of campus research
## 
### 
In arguing his "pro" position on the
question of Stanford's relationship to
defense funding May 12, Angelo
Codevilla makes several questionable
assertions.
I have to object most strongly to
one: that "university research played
almost no role in the development of
ballistic missiles between 1955 and
1961." If this notion were true, it
would certainly change the way we
understand the development in univer
sities of material science, electronics,
guidance servomechanisms, the
aerodynamics of re-entry and apparatus
— conceptual and instrumental — for
calculating ballistic paths.
But the statement is false. To cite
one example is to run the risk of mini
mizing the extent to which universities
across America contributed to weapons
development. Still, substituting any one

of a number of specific cases for
Codevilla's blanket claim — say,
"Charles S. Draper and MIT played
almost no role in the development of
ballistic missiles between 1955 and
1961" — shows its absurdity.
I hope "this yuppie factory" exists in
part because of the idea that a com
munity of scholars should be commit
ted to the truth. I think Codevilla's
wishful confusion of assertion and fact
does us all a disservice.
