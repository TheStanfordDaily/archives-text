Stanford's move to fire W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the Hoover Insti
tution, is an intolerant and, above all,
partisan act by leading elements in the
Stanford administration and the trus
tees.
What University President Donald
Kennedy, supported by Warren Chris

topher, president of the Stanford
Board of Trustees, doesn't like about
Hoover is that it is a home to a num
ber of conservative scholars, some of
whom have served in the Reagan ad
ministration. Campbell's departure
would open the door to an intellectual
witch hunt.
Kennedy is a long-time Democrat
who was a political appointee in the
Carter Administration. In 1986 he
publicly urged voters to retain Rose
Bird as Chief Justice of the California
Supreme Court.
He presides over a faculty with a
heavy, and growing, "liberal" cast. A
recent study by George Marotta, senior
research fellow at Hoover, showed that
of 218 professors in nine departments
and schools at Stanford, 80 percent of
those registered to vote are Democrats,
10 percent are independents, and only
10 percent are Republicans.
Increasingly, academic freedom at
Stanford is defined in practice as the
freedom to agree — but not to dis
agree — with the liberal majority.

The proper role of a university presi
dent is to defend intellectual diversity
by maintaining an environment in
which all voices can be heard. In con
doning, if not orchestrating, this attack
upon Hoover's director, Kennedy is
narrowing the range of permissible
discourse at Stanford.
Such blatantly political acts can only
damage Stanford's academic reputation,
especially among its alumni, whose
continued support is essential.
