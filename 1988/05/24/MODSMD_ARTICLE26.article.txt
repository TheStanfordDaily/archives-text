## Book review misleading 
### 
IN LIGHT of Martin Eternal's May
11 visit to Stanford, I would like to
reply to the review of Bernal's
book which was run Feb. 4.
In studying Western culture at
Stanford, what are we really studying?
That is the question which Prof. lain
Boal set out to address when he sub
mitted his review of "Black Athena:
The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical
Civilization," by Martin Bernal.
The Daily took advantage of its
position as the newspaper for the
Stanford campus, taking for granted
that its readers would understand the
conflict Boal was addressing.
Through the use of headline, layout
and illustration, The Daily distorted
the tone of Boal's argument, making it
appear as a new issue in the Western
Culture conflict rather than a straight
forward essay about a book by Martin
Bernal, which was what it was in
tended to be.
Boal first presents the central argu
ment of Bernal's book: The idea that
the roots of Classical Greece lie actu
ally in Egypt and Phoenicia, but that
scholars today do not recognize that
fact.
Boal goes on to give us an account
of who Bernal is, calling him an "out
sider" because he is Jewish and radi
cal, but saying that he has "insider"
credentials.
I do not think that Boal is trying to
discredit Bernal by calling him an
outsider; instead he is identifying him
as knowing something about what it
feels like to be denied roots, linking
him with the subject he deals with and
giving him credit that outweighs even
his credentials.
At the beginning of the next para
graph, Boal calls Bernal's assertion of
the Egyptian roots of Greek culture
"iconoclastic." This might seem at first
glance to be denying the value of the
assertion, yet on closer inspection
iconoclastic fits in that sentence.
Boal has just finished identifying
Bernal as an iconoclast, someone very
capable and qualified to look at an
issue from a different viewpoint.

Bernal's viewpoint, then, would of
course by iconoclastic, because it
belongs to Bernal the iconoclast, Ber
nal the radical Jew who is a
Cambridge Fellow, Bernal who is
breaking down conventional misconcep
tions in exchange for ultimate truths.
It now seems very appropriate that
Bernal's assertion be iconoclastic, not
in the sense that it is brand new and
full of wonder, but in the sense that it
is leading away from the popular myth
of Western isolationism toward a truer
and more universal theory of history.
Boal goes on to talk about the ac
ceptance in Classical Greece of this
"iconoclastic" theory. He says that
Plato and friends would have agreed
exactly with Bernal.
Here he is not drawing from Ber
nal's book, he is making his own
assertion that Bernal is exactly right
and that Classical civilization would
have agreed with him.
It was not until the colonization of
the Americas, he says, that color preju
dice developed in Europe. This would
mean that Europeans before that were
not biased in their dealings with East
ern people of color.
That is certainly something Stanford
students have learned in Art 5, Greek
and Roman art, studying the immense
Eastern influence that changed vase
painting in the seventh century and
the Egyptian influence that began
Greeks sculpting marble in the sixth
century.
The New York Kouros, incidentally
one of the illustrations included with
the article, owes much to Egyptian
roots. No ancient Greek would have
disagreed with Bernal, and neither
does Boal. He suggests instead that we
should break down the false Aryan
models embedded in our Western
Culture program.
He continues his argument along
this line, claiming that historically
people outside of formal Classical
studies have made the major break
throughs in the area.
He is not shouting Bernal's name
from the rooftops, claiming his to be a

mtyor breakthrough; rather he is
suggesting that from people like Ber
nal, who have taken a step, will come
the breakdown of the prejudice and
stereotyping that lead to regarding
Western culture as exclusively Western.
He is praising the questioning of the
basic premises of the system, no mat
ter who is doing the questioning.
In the last paragraph, Boal uses the
phrase, "This ought to give pause to
all" but he does not mean that Ber
nal's book should make us all stop and
rethink our heritage.
He means the idea of Bernal's book,
the idea that our roots are essentially
Eastern, the idea that Western culture
cannot be grasped by wearing blinders,
should cause all of us to stop and
think about who we are and where we
came from.
He does not end with "this ought to
give pause to all"; to quote just that
much of his sentence is to misquote
him. He says, "This ought to give
pause to all those in the 'Western
Culture' fracas."
His "Western Culture" is in quotes
because he does not believe in "West
ern Culture," but he believes in world
culture.
In going on to say that Allan Bloom
and his cohorts "gather at the pure
springs of Greek rationality and sci
ence," he is criticizing Allan Bloom
and followers for the worst crime an
educated person can commit: closing
his or her mind to the idea that all
cultures are interconnected, that all
people are people, that all people have
something to give to one another.
Hopefully Stanford has been able to
take that step suggested by both Ber
nal and Boal.
