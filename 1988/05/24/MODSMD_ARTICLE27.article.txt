# SIDO funds carefully
## 
### 
ON BEHALF of the Stanford
International Development
Organization, we would like to
thank Brent Williams for voicing his
apprehensions May 20 about the SIDO
fast. We share Williams' concern for
the underprivileged.
However, we take great offense to
his completely unfounded accusation
that we are using hunger as bait to
entrap innocents such as himself into
giving money for liberal, leftist causes.
SIDO is not sending money to the
Sandinista military, nor is it covertly
financing black liberation groups in
South Africa. The money raised from
the fast is going to help the uned
ucated (who in this case happen to be
blacks in South Africa) and the eco
nomically deprived (women in Nicara
gua).
We did not choose to sponsor Nica
raguans and South Africans specifi
cally; rather, we chose to sponsor
effective grassroots development proj
ects quite independently of their loca
tion.
The word "hunger" immediately
evokes painful images of emaciated
children in the hands of parents with
tears in their eyes. What is SIDO
doing about this, Williams asks. Why
are we funding co-operatives in Nicara
gua and colleges in South Africa in
stead of helping the hungry?
Firstly, I wish to point out that
SIDO does in fact give a sizeable
fraction of funds raised to Oxfam
America and the Ecumenical Hunger
Project. This year alone, we gave about
$1,600 (half the money raised from the
fall fast) to Oxfam.
However, if Williams had done his
homework on Oxfam, he would have
learned that what they do with this
money is surprisingly similar to what
we do with the remainder of the
money we raise — fund grassroots
development projects.
Why then does SIDO choose to raise
money for grassroots development
instead of doing something more direct
and immediate to feed the hungry? It

is our belief that hunger is only a
painfully visible symptom of the much
more deep seated disease of under
development.
The systemic factors which keep the
hungry from two meals a day are
inextricably tied to those factors which
keep women economically deprived in
Nicaragua and blacks unemployed and
uneducated in South Africa.
To suggest that development and
politics constitute separate realms, as
Williams does, could politely be de
scribed as naive.
Moreover, we believe that sending
food is a short-term, band-aid solution
to the serious problem of under
development. The problem is too severe
to be solved by sending over petty cash
in the form of indirect aid.
Instead, we choose to sponsor proj
ects proposed by people in under
developed areas themselves. It is our
conviction that the underprivileged
themselves know what obstacles are in
their way to economic dignity.
Communities proposing projects have
always carefully thought out their
long-term needs, and the money we
give thus goes to building a long-term
economic base in underdeveloped
regions.
Williams' suggestion that funding
grassroots development is "not even
tangentially related to the alleviation of
world hunger" is extremely myopic.
So, as is clear, the fast is not a
sinister plot to support partisan politi
cal interests, but our way of helping
the hungry by helping fund long-term
solutions to underdevelopment.
We would like to thank all those
who participated in our Spring Fast
and to invite them to join us in our
efforts to learn more about develop
ment.
