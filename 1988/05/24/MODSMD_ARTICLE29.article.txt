## The 						Bug's definitive Star Trek phaser manual 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
An alert reader sends us our
News Item of the Week from the
Modesto Bee. According to the
April 21 article, Calaveras County
lawyer Clark Head will appeal his
client's felony conviction because
the prosecutor repeatedly passed
gas during the four-week trial.
"He farted about 100 times,"
Head told the Bee, "He even lifted
his leg several times." Head went
on record to protest his oppon
ent's tactics after Tuolumne
County Asst. District Attorney
Ned Lowenbach passed gas during
his closing arguments.
"The closing argument is sup
posed to be sort of sacred," said
Head. "It's like the defendant's
last chance, and you aren't sup
posed to interrupt it. Certainly
not by farting and making the
jury laugh."

Dear Bug,
Ever since I graduated from the
academy and assumed my first
fleet command, I have wondered
about the operation of the hand
held phaser. I missed the lectures
and they were not on tape. Luck
ily, I took the class pass/no clue.
How does a phaser "know " how
much of an object to vaporize? It
can't be based on material unifor
mity because when I shoot a Klin
gon with my phaser set to kill,
his whole body disappears; his
boots, his clothes, even his ugly
face. On the other hand, it can't
be based on volume of material

because sometimes small objects
such as the ugly slug thing that
crawled out of Chekov's ear can
be destroyed without affecting the
surroundings. What if I were to
miss my target and hit the
bulkhead of the ship? How much
of the bulkhead would disappear?
Just a part of the wall or the
whole outer hull?
Could you please explain these
inconsistencies ?

I believe it was Franklin
Roosevelt who said "We have
nothing to fear but fear itself,"
to which I might add, "We should
also fear people who have nothing
better to do than sit in LOTS and
debate via the Sci-Fi bulletin
board whether the creature in
Star Trek episode 39 was brown
or green."
Not that there is anything
wrong with watching Star Trek
for goodness sakes. Why even I
myself can think of several pow
erful episodes of the show which
I am unable to forget, although
I'm in counseling now to try to
do so.
But on to the question at hand,
which, if I understand it correctly,
is how come Chekov didn't get
his head melted in Star Trek 11,
"The Wrath of Mr. Rourke." Now
if we would just take a moment
to reflect on the fact that this is
all make-believe, I think we'll get
along just fine.
The hand phaser (also known
as "Phaser I" for those of you
keeping score at home) is carried
when the obvious display of
weaponry would be inappropriate,
such as on a landing mission to
a friendly planet, or in bed. On
board the ship the hand phaser
is carried only by security person
nel and whatever random charac
ter is going to go berserk that
week.
Shaped like a garage door
opener (wouldn't it be fun if your
garage door opener had a "Stun"
setting), the hand phaser has a
power grid, setting wheel, charge
indicator dial, warning light, rec
tangular trigger button, and

sideburn trimmer. No, wait,
that's my shaver. It has six (count
'em) fun settings ranging from
Stun to Puree.
Stun affects the nervous system
of the target, rendering it uncon
scious. Obviously, this setting can
only be used against targets which
have nervous systems. Humans
and animals, for example, are af
fected by this setting — my ex
girlfriend is not.
Wide-Angle Stun is used to im
mobilize many targets spread over
a wide area, such as a hostile
crowd or The Osmond Family.
Heavy Stun is a stronger setting
used to immobilize larger or
stronger life-forms. There is no
Wide-Angle Heavy Stun, meaning
that if the crew of the Enterprise
were ever attacked by a sorority
they would be annihilated.
The Heat setting excites the
molecules within an object,
causing it to — surprise — heat
up. On this setting the phaser can
be used as a welding torch or to
start fires, depending on whether
the molecules in the object get
excited or just plain aroused.
Disrupt lethally disrupts the
nervous system, or breaks down
the crystalline structure of non
living objects. This is the setting
you use when you want to kill
somebody or shatter something
without making it completely dis
appear. This is just one illustra
tion of how even Star Trek's tech
nology is not perfect. A perfect
technology would allow one to
make a target disappear without
killing it. ("Spock, you ignorant
Vulcan you, I hereby zap you to
Cleveland, heh, heh, heh.")
Which brings us to the number
one fun setting: Disintegrate!
This setting completely breaks
down the molecular structure of
a man-size target or smaller. The
Disintegrate setting is used both
to blow away Klingons and the
little slug-like creature on
Chekov's face.
Luckily, the phaser has power
settings which can be used to de
termine how strong a beam will
be emitted. It isn't the case that

a Disintegrate beam ia simply a
stronger kind of Stun beam.
Rather, it is a completely different
type of beam that can be set to
various strengths. Set to its full
strength, the Disintegrate beam
will blow away an entire Klingon
and his clothing. Set to a lesser
strength, the beam can be used
to disintegrate smaller objects.
The phaser wouldn't do too
much damage to the hull of the
ship because it isn't powerful
enough to melt the whole thing.
It should be fairly evident here
that we are dealing in almost pure
conjecture. All my evidence is
gleaned from the "United Feder
ation of Planets Cadet's Orienta
tion Sourcebook" from the Star
Trek Role Playing Game. Anyone
who doubts my "facts" are wel
come to send nasty letters to me
on LOTS (Bug-Me @ Tragedies).
I will respond to any doubters

just as soon as I get my com
municator fixed.
Greetings,
I've got big money and a big
ego riding on a wager. Hope you
can resolve the dispute. Do you
speak your piece or speak your
peace 1 ? Do you cite your referees
or references ? My arch-nemesis in
this matter will only accept the
highest authority. Half my friends
will opine one way, half the other.
We need it explained in books,
man. That's it.
— Awaiting your next column
I submit that it's safe to say
that any moron knows it is "speak
your piece" and "cite your refer
ences." In fact, all us morons at
The Daily are in complete agree
ment on this point, which is the
first time everyone at The Daily
have agreed on anything since we

decided to start simply making up
all our news stories to save time.
Obviously, when you "speak
your piece" you are getting across
a "piece" of your opinion and not
trying to make "peace." Further
more, "citing your references"
means "to state where you got
your facts," while to "cite your
referees" means "to give a ticket
to the man in the striped shirt."
I am phenomenally amazed that
half your friends opined in favor
of "peace" and "referees." Go
ahead and tell 'em that it's "spear
your peas" and "sight your
refrigerators," they'll never know.
In fact, this isn't even the kind
of topic I would bring up with my
friends, although my ex-girlfriend
and I used to discuss such
trivialities. I wouldn't ever use
the word "opine" in the same sen


BUG
ME

tence as her name, however, al
though "bovine" would not be out
of the question.
Since you didn't tell me which
side of this torrid debate you are
on, I will have to restrain myself
from making ruthless fun of you.
You did mention that you have
big money and a big ego riding
on this, so I can only assume that
if you lost the bet there is some
one on campus walking around
with all your money and your ego
in his pocket. If I see anyone in
the next few days with two egos
I'll know you lost the bet.
Either that, or the person I'm
seeing is actually a Democrat. You
never know.
Yo Bug Me,
Why is it the portal Nazis at
Green library won't take your meal
card (with picture) for ID, but will
accept the standard bogus, no pic
ture ID which any [random per
son] with a pulse could use?
— Severely discontented
Dear Bug Me,
When you try to enter Meyer
library, do they really read your
ID card?
— Gearhead
I think you should think twice
before using the term "portal
Nazis." The employees are, after
all, only following orders.
There are two problems with
using meal cards as ID. First,
mealcards don't have any kind of

a date on them, so even if you
have long since left Stanford, your
trusty mealcard stays with you.
Second, mealcards are issued dur
ing the summer to random people
who come here for on-campus
conferences. Since these meal
cards look the same and aren't
picked up after the conference is
over, there's no way of telling true
students from someone who was
just here at the International
Plumbers of America Conference.
The regular student IDs, how
ever, aren't much more of a bar
gain, because despite the fact that
they are issued only to students,
and updated each quarter, they
don't have a photo. If you can get
your hands on a Stanford ID, you
can use it for just about anything.
In fact, it doesn't even have to
be an ID from the current quar
ter. In another of my grand sci
entific experiments, I was able to
get into both Meyer and Green
without a second glance by flash
ing Stanford IDs from Fall 1986
and Winter 1987.
I, for one, am not going to object
to this carelessness by the library
checkers, because I'd rather be
able to get in by flashing my ID
than have to wait while they ex
amined everyone's ID closely.
Luckily, all of these problems will
be solved when the ASSU Senate
finally gets us those Laminated
Universal ID Cards that they've
been promising.
Or when Hell freezes over,
whichever comes first.

The final Bug Me of this volume
will appear in the Dead Week
Issue on June 1: mark your calen
dars.
