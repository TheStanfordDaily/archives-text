# Financial aid law taps summer pay
## 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
As students scramble to round
up summer jobs, the federal gov
ernment is preparing to imple
ment legislation that may dis
courage summer work.
New legislation on student aid,
slated to go into effect for the
1988-89 academic year, states
that university financial aid of
fices must require students to
contribute 70 percent of their
earnings from the previous 12
months — minus taxes and
money earned from work-study
jobs.
In the past, if a student had a
summer job financial aid officials
assumed $900 — or $700 for in
coming freshmen — as the max
imum a student would be ex
pected to contribute.
The new 70-percent figure will
be used only if it is greater than
$900 — or $700 for incoming
freshmen. If the 70-percent figure
is lower, financial aids officials
will assume a minimum of $900
or $700.
Because larger student re
sources result in decreased finan
cial aid offers, the new system
will penalize students on financial
aid who work in high paying sum
mer jobs.
The new legislation is actually
an amendment to the Higher Ed
ucation Act of 1965 which covers
many issues related to financial
aid. It is reauthorized by Congress
every five years. The amendment
on student resources was ap
proved on Oct. 16, 1986.
Junior Miguel Marquez, a mem
ber of next year's Council of Presi

dents, criticized the law saying
that it was not well-publicized
before it was passed and that it
eliminates incentives to work
hard.
He said by counting a percent
age of earnings as resources, stu
dents who work harder may have
to pay more than those who do
not work as hard.
He also said the legislation was
"placed on people" and enacted
without much student input.
Roberta Johnson, associate di
rector of Stanford's Financial
Aids Office, acknowledged that
the new amendment might stifle
motivation, but said Stanford is
taking the law in stride because
it has no choice. She said the law
has been actively studied over the
past few years and has been the
subject of some political debate,
adding that Stanford lobbied ac
tively against parts of the amend
ment.
Johnson said the Financial Aids
office may be able to find a loop
hole in the interpretation of this
part of the legislation that will
allow them to continue with their
usual $900 contribution assess
ment.
She said many aspects of the
act are vague and interpretation
from the U.S. Department of Ed
ucation is necessary for its imple
mentation.
Johnson said the entire act
places a "tremendous burden on
schools to incorporate all aspects
of the legislation" into school
policy.
Though Johnson was unable to
say whether the legislation will
affect the amount of aid Stanford
allots to students, she said the
new policy on calculating student
resources will make the determi
nation of financial aid at Stanford
more difficult and time
consuming.
Although the University will
continue to "show sensitivity and

exercise professional judge
ments," the amendment will re
quire financial aids officers to pay
more attention to detail and to
explain in writing the logic of the
decision they make in each and
every decision, she said.
Johnson declined to speak for
the Financial Aids Office in ex
pressing an opinion of the amend
ment, and said the office will
make a formal review of the new
legislation after it is applied for
the first time.
