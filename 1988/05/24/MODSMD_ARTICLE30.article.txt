# A 						family crisis
## Mother needs immediate lung transplant 
### Bryan Cooperrider Staff writer 
There is a great deal of wis
dom to the saying, "Live every
day as if it were your last." But
for Joan Storey, that aphorism
is all too real.
Although Storey is only 48
years old, her doctors have in
formed her that she has only
three months to live if she
doesn't receive a unilateral lung
transplant.
Storey is a victim of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, or Hamman-
Rich syndrome, a hereditary dis
ease that progressively scars and
destroys the lungs.
"It feels as if you're drown
ing," explained Sandy Storey,
Joan's daughter.
The Storey family's medical
insurance will cover 80 percent
of the costs for the very expen
sive surgery, but they must raise
an additional $35,000, excluding
relocation costs, just to make the
operation possible.
With the help of Joseph Zel
mer, a San Francisco lawyer, and
the United Methodist Church in
Los Altos, Sandy has set up a
trust fund entitled "I Love Life"
to help raise the needed $35,000.
They have raised only $3,000 to
date.
But it is not only a question
of money — it is also a question
of time. The urgency of her

mother's illness has sparked
Sandy to move quickly. She has
been contacting all forms of
media in a desperate attempt to
help her mother. Loretta Greene
of the Palo Alto Times Tribune
responded by writing her Feb.
22 column on the Storey's situ
ation.
"The media is the only way
to generate the funds needed,"
Sandy said. "It's our last resort."
Storey has already been ac
cepted by the Toronto General
Hospital, which has the best suc
cess rate for single-lung trans
plants. Before they will perform
the operation, however, Storey
must provide proof that she can
pay for the surgery.
Despite the enormous amount
of money that needs to be raised,
Storey remains hopeful and op
timistic that they will be able to
generate the funds needed to
help pay for her surgery.
Sandy said the surgery would
give her mother at least nine
years of "normal life," a luxury
that she has not enjoyed since
she was first stricken with the
disease.
Dr. Charles Lombard, a
pulmonary pathologist at the
Stanford Medical Center, is cur
rently researching the complex
disease. "For some unknown
reason the lung tissue becomes
inflamed, meaning there is some
destruction of the lungs by the

person's own body," he ex
plained in the Times Tribune
column. "Her own immune sys
tem, instead of destroying an in
fectious agent, turns on the body
itself and destroys the lungs —
and only the lungs, for whatever
reason."
Joan Storey has already
watched the lives of three uncles,
a cousin and her mother claimed
by the deadly disease, which had
not been named before striking
the older generation. Now her
daughter Sandy, while witness
ing the pain of her mother's suf
fering, is frightened by the fact
that she too is afflicted with it.
Sandy is currently in remis
sion, but her situation could
change with the invasion of an
other serious illness. If she con
tracts pneumonia, for instance,
her condition will most likely fol
low the same course as her
mother. Joan caught pneumonia
at 19, and at that point it was
clear that she had inherited the
disease.
Lombard is trying to find a
genetic marker for the disease
to determine if Sandy's children
are also carrying it. Lombard
said that if she had known the
full implications of Hamman-
Rich earlier, she would * have
reconsidered having children.
"Now it is apparent to me
more than ever, the severity of
this disease," Sandy was quoted

as saying in the Times Tribune.
"If I had known before, my
choice [to have childrenl might
have been different."
Although Joan must rely on
a respiratory machine for her
breathing, she still goes to her
part time bookkeeping job at
Audio-Visual Corporation in
Palo Alto.
"She can't sit around, do noth
ing and think about what's
around the corner," said Sandy.
"She's trying to continue with
a normal life."
But normal things are a chore
for Joan — just walking from
the bedroom to the kitchen is
exhausting.
Although the Storey's trust
fund has been established
mainly to raise the money
needed for the transplant, Sandy
appreciates the need to help
others with similar diseases.
"There is a lot of help for
people who have diseases such
as cancer," explained Sandy,
"but there is no one out there
to help those with hereditary dis
eases."
Hopefully for Joan Storey,
there are people who will help.

odist Church at 655 Magdalena

"The media is the only way
to generate the funds needed,"
Sandy said. "It's our last resort."
Storey has already been ac
cepted by the Toronto General
Hospital, which has the best suc
cess rate for single-lung trans
plants. Before they will perform
the operation, however, Storey
must provide proof that she can
pay for the surgery.
Despite the enormous amount
of money that needs to be raised,
Storey remains hopeful and op
timistic that they will be able to
generate the funds needed to
help pay for her surgery.
Sandy said the surgery would
give her mother at least nine
years of "normal life," a luxury
that she has not enjoyed since
she was first stricken with the
disease.
Dr. Charles Lombard, a
pulmonary pathologist at the
Stanford Medical Center, is cur
rently researching the complex
disease. "For some unknown
reason the lung tissue becomes
inflamed, meaning there is some
destruction of the lungs by the

person's own body," he ex
plained in the Times Tribune
column. "Her own immune sys
tem, instead of destroying an in
fectious agent, turns on the body
itself and destroys the lungs —
and only the lungs, for whatever
reason."
Joan Storey has already
watched the lives of three uncles,
a cousin and her mother claimed
by the deadly disease, which had
not been named before striking
the older generation. Now her
daughter Sandy, while witness
ing the pain of her mother's suf
fering, is frightened by the fact
that she too is afflicted with it.
Sandy is currently in remis
sion, but her situation could
change with the invasion of an
other serious illness. If she con
tracts pneumonia, for instance,
her condition will most likely fol
low the same course as her
mother. Joan caught pneumonia
at 19, and at that point it was
clear that she had inherited the
disease.
Lombard is trying to find a
genetic marker for the disease
to determine if Sandy's children
are also carrying it. Lombard
said that if she had known the
full implications of Hamman-
Rich earlier, she would * have
reconsidered having children.
"Now it is apparent to me
more than ever, the severity of
this disease," Sandy was quoted

as saying in the Times Tribune.
"If I had known before, my
choice [to have childrenl might
have been different."
Although Joan must rely on
a respiratory machine for her
breathing, she still goes to her
part time bookkeeping job at
Audio-Visual Corporation in
Palo Alto.
"She can't sit around, do noth
ing and think about what's
around the corner," said Sandy.
"She's trying to continue with
a normal life."
But normal things are a chore
for Joan — just walking from
the bedroom to the kitchen is
exhausting.
Although the Storey's trust
fund has been established
mainly to raise the money
needed for the transplant, Sandy
appreciates the need to help
others with similar diseases.
"There is a lot of help for
people who have diseases such
as cancer," explained Sandy,
"but there is no one out there
to help those with hereditary dis
eases."
Hopefully for Joan Storey,
there are people who will help.
