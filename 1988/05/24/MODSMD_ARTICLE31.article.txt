## Stanford bends but doesn't break vs. USC Down 3-2 and match point in No. 1 singles, netters rally 
### Matthew Hodman Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. -
Two champion
ship-caliber teams
traded blows yes
terday, with the
USC men's tennis
team winning five

of six first sets in singles play and
knocking Stanford down for the
count.
The Trojans got their punches
in early, while the Cardinal got
off to a perilously slow start.
But Stanford got back up, and
USC couldn't deliver the knock
out blow,
Freshman David Wheaton
rescued the Cardinal in singles
play and sophomores Jeff Cathrall
and Eric Peus clinched the tre
mendous come-from-behind 5-3
win that put Stanford into the
NCAA Tennis Championship
finals.
"They really had our backs
against the wall," Stanford Coach
Dick Gould said. "We were out of
it. If you had asked the guys to
look you straight in the eye and
tell you we would win, they'd have
said no."

"We always seem to come up a
point short of Dick (Stanford
Coach Dick Gould) in Georgia,"
said USC Coach Dick Leach, who
has still never coached an NCAA
team champion. "Dick just has
the Midas touch in Athens."
The top-seeded Cardinal faces
No. 2 seed Louisiana State today
at 1 p.m. The match marks the
first time the top two seeds will
meet in the finals of the NCAA
tournament since 1983.
"Everyone stayed togther and
played on complete guts," sopho
more JefTTarango said. "It shows
we want this thing so badly. We
are going to keep fighting until
the last point is over."
Yesterday, it was a long way to
that last point. Here's how it
went, match-by-match.
USC 1, Stanford 0.
On Court 6, USC raced off to
a 1-0 lead with senior Scott
Brownsberger taking freshman
Glenn Solomon 7-5, 6-1.
Solomon was ahead 4-2 in the
first set, but couldn't hold his
serve consistently. Brownsberger
grew more confident as the match
progressed, winning the last six
games of the match.

'We were out of it. If you had asked the guys
to look you straight in the eye and tell you we
would win, they'd have said no.'

USC 1, Stanford 1
At No. 4 singles, freshman Mar
tin Blackman was too tough for
USC's Eric Amend on the big
points, winning 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 to
pull Stanford to a short-lived tie.
USC 2, Stanford 1
On Court 3 meanwhile, USC
freshman Byron Black was busy
shocking senior Patrick McEnroe
6-2, 6-4.
Black's two-handed forehands
and backhands were landing con
sistently near the baseline, while
McEnroe was uncharacteristically
wilting under pressure. Serving
to stay in the match at 4-5 in the
second set, McEnroe double
faulted on match point to give
Black the match and USC the
lead.
USC 2, Stanford 2
Soon after USC took its lead,

however, Cathrall eked out a
heart-throbbing 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 win
over Jonas Wallgard on Court 5.
With both players nailing
forehand and backhand
groundstrokes, Cathrall and Wal
lgard traded baseline winners
throughout the match.
But on a 3-3 point at 5-5 in
the pivotal third set, Cathrall
forced a Wallgard error, breaking
the USC senior's serve. Cathrall
held serve to close out the match
and knot the team score.
On Courts 1 and 2, it looked
like USC would take a command
ing 4-2 lead going into doubles
competition.
USC 3, Stanford 2
Trojan John Carras won the
first nine games of his contest
against Jeff Tarango at No. 2
singles. But, like the rest of his
Stanford teammates, Tarango
may have been down, but he
wasn't out.
Having difficulty serving be
cause of a pulled stomach muscle,
Tarango relied on the velocity of
his groundstrokes. Down 5-2 in
the second set after bowing 6-0
in the first, the Stanford sopho
more won five straight games on
the strength of his baseline win
ners to take the second set 7-5.
But Carras showed the mental
toughness that characterized
USC's play yesterday, bouncing
back to win the third set and the
match 6-0, 5-7, 6-3.
"It's just a couple points here,
a couple points there," Tarango
said. "I was trying as hard as I
could out there."
USC 3, Stanford 3
With USC up 3-2, the Wheaton-
Scott Melville match became the
pivotal match. If Melville won,
USC would only need one doubles
win to take the team match.
But, mirroring the tenacity of
the Stanford team effort, it was
USC's Melville that landed the
early blows, while it was Stan
ford's Wheaton that came back
from the dead to deliver the
knock-out punch.
Melville took the first set 6-4
and was serving for the match at
5-4 in the second. But Melville
couldn't register on his first
serves, and Wheaton jumped all
over his second balls to take the
10th game and salvage a quick
exit.
In the second-set tiebreaker,
Melville was again the early
puncher, opening up 6-5 and 7-6
leads for two match points.
But the relentless Wheaton
kept attacking, coming into net
on Melville's second serves and
forcing errant passing shots.
Wheaton pulled out the tiebreaker
9-7 and the second set 7-6.
Again in the third set, it looked
like Wheaton was down and out.
With both players serving ace
after ace, a break would decide
the match. Wheaton was down
1-2 in the deciding set and 1-3
on his service game. But Wheaton
roared back with three straight

aces, the last coming on a second
serve right down the middle to
tie the set at 2-2.
At 5-5 in the set, Melville was
down 0-2 on his serve and came
back with two aces of his own to
make the game score 2-2. But an
unforced error put Wheaton up
3-2 and Melville double-faulted
the set's 11th game to the Stan
ford freshman.
Wheaton then served out the
match, winning 4-6, 7-6 (9-7), 7-5
and keeping the Cardinal in the
team contest at 3-3.
"I thought for sure I was going
to lose," Wheaton said. "When
you're down match points and
Melville is serving, it's tough not
to think you will lose."
"Melville winning at No. 1
would have given us a good shot,"
Leach said. "We had beaten all
their doubles teams before and
would have only needed one win."
Stanford 4, USC 3
At No. 2 doubles, an inspired
McEnroe and Blackman tandem
took a solid 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory
from USC's Brownsberger and
Murphy Jensen. McEnroe hit win
ner after winner from his back
hand side to spur the Cardinal
win.
With Wheaton and Tarango
trailing Melville and Amend 6-4,

0-1 at No. 1 doubles, eyes from
both teams' players wandered to
the No. 3 doubles match.
Stanford 5, USC 3
After winning the first set 6-4,
Cathrall and Peus found them
selves in a dogfight in the second
set against Carras and Black.
At 3-3, a Cathrall passing shot
put Stanford up a break at 4-3.
But Carras and Black broke right
back against Peus to knot the con
test at 4-4. At 4-5 with Cathrall
serving on a 3-3 game point, a
Peus volley knotted the second
set at 5-5.
As happened with so many of
the sets and matches were decided
yesterday, the No. 3 doubles
match was decided on a tie
breaker.
Each team traded points —
with Cathrall and Peus letting one
match point slip away — until a
Carras misfire at the net gave
Stanford the match 6-4, 7-6 (9-7)
and the gutwrenching 5-3 team
win.
"It's such a great feeling (to
win the deciding match)," Peus
said. "We both went in thinking
our match is the match. Playing
No. 3 we don't play all the best
teams and we're not in the NCAA
doubles draw. But winning this
match is our glory right here."
