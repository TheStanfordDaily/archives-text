# Lichti is still climbing Mt. Olympics
## 
### 
At times Todd Lichti's feats on the
basketball court have seemed posi
tively Olympian to Stanford fans, and
apparently U.S. Olympic Coach John
Thompson feels the same way so far,
as he included Lichti in the elite
group of 40 players still in the run
ning for a trip to Seoul.

Stanford junior Howard Wright
was among the more than 50 players
cut and has returned to campus, but
classmate Lichti will continue at the
Colorado Springs camp until today.
Then, Thompson will pare the squad
down to roughly two dozen players,
who will be invited back to a mid
summer camp at Georgetown.
Lichti is among a group of about
15 off-guard/swingman types that in
cludes such top players as Kentucky's
Rex Chapman, Bradley's Hersey
Hawkins and Temple's Mark Macon.

Obviously the competition is stiff
when these players could be consid
ered almost shoo-ins for the squad,
and players like Mitch Richmond of
Kansas State and Jeff Grayer of lowa
State are waiting in the wings.
Still, Lichti has proven that he
belongs at this level, and keys for
him will be to play strong defense
and shoot the ball well. Thompson
stresses defense heavily and another
priority for the U.S. team is outside
shooting.

Fifth-year senior Marc Olesen
struggled to a disappointing sixth
place finish in the 1,500 meters at
the Pacific 10 Conference track
championships but look for him to
bounce back at the NCAAs. Both
Olesen and the track team could be
the big surprise at the NCAA cham
pionships in Eugene, Ore., June 1-4.
The Cardinal did not have the
depth to crack the top five at the
Pac-lOs, but it has the quality ath
letes to make some noise at the na
tionals. Olesen leads a strong dis
tance corps and is priming for an
epic battle with Arkansas superstar
Joe Falcon in the 1,500 final. Senior
Brian Marshall could also score big
in the high jump.

Stanford Coach Jack Elway has
just begun going over applicants for
the assistant coach position that
opened when Jimmy Walsh resigned.
A replacement should be named soon
as will a new recruiting coordinator.
The football team is in the middle
of an important recruiting period
now. All the coaches are on the road
for the last two weeks of May. The
NCAA allows coaches to recruit off
campus during this period, and it is
an important time for visiting
recruits and analyzing prospects in
order to set the groundwork for next
year's class.
The coaches also had 47 juniors
and their families on campus two
weeks ago for the Cardinal/White
scrimmage. The staff invite those
players they rate as "super-blues"
and "reds" up to Stanford for a day
of visiting the Farm and viewing the
scrimmage.
The recruits pay their own ex
penses, and these trips are not to be
confused with the expense-paid, 48-
hour recruiting visits that take place
during the athletes' senior year. Still,
they show what an involved and
drawn-out process the college football
recruiting game has become.

Stanford swimmer Laurie McLean
has stopped out and gone to Arizona
to train with Wildcat Coach Dick
Jocumb. McLean is coming off a dis
appointing sophomore season and is
marshaling her energy for an Olym
pic bid away from the distractions of
Stanford.
The immensely talented McLean
came to Stanford as one of the top
young individual medley swimmers
in the country, and she is also a fine
backstroker. However, like classmate
Michelle Griglione (who returned to
Virginia to train), McLean is looking
to regain her form away from the
pressures of classes and the like. Both
should be back next year.

Ground-breaking on the new ten
nis facility is slated to begin soon,
and the remodeled stadium will give
the Stanford tennis program a fitting
home. Not only will facilities for
players and fans be better, but the
new stadium will allow Stanford
Coach Frank Brennan to bid for host
ing the NCAA women's champion
ship.
The championship rotates from
one site to another every two years,
and Brennan will look to bring the
NCAAs to Stanford in the 1990s
