New England for NCAA regional play, but the
playoffs will be no tea party for the Cardinal.
Stanford (37-21 overall and 18-12 in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division) is seeded second
in the Northeast Regional, to be played in New
Britain, Conn. The Cardinal will open tournament
play at 11:30 a.m. PDT Thursday against No. 5
seed St. Johns (28-18-1), the NCAA announced yes

winner of the Kentucky-Rutgers opening-round
game.

elimination game at 7 p m. Friday against the loser
of the Clemson-Fordham opening-round game.
