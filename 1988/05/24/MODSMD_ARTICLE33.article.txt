# Baseball is headed for Northeast
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team will be traveling to
New England for NCAA regional play, but the
playoffs will be no tea party for the Cardinal.
Stanford (37-21 overall and 18-12 in the Pacific
10 Conference Southern Division) is seeded second
in the Northeast Regional, to be played in New
Britain, Conn. The Cardinal will open tournament
play at 11:30 a.m. PDT Thursday against No. 5
seed St. Johns (28-18-1), the NCAA announced yes
terday.
Clemson is the No. 1 seed in the regional field,
which also includes No. 3 seed Kentucky, No. 4
seed Rutgers and No. 6 seed Fordham.
If Stanford wins Thursday, it will be idle Friday
and will play at 4 p.m. EDT Saturday against the
winner of the Kentucky-Rutgers opening-round
game.
A loss Thursday would put the Cardinal in an
elimination game at 7 p m. Friday against the loser
of the Clemson-Fordham opening-round game.
The tournament bracket becomes more confusing
after that, changing depending on how many teams
remain. The championship game will be played on
Monday, with the winner advanc
ing to the College World Series,
scheduled for June 3-11 in
Omaha, Neb.
The Cardinal, ranked ninth na
tionally by Baseball America and
11th by ESPN/Collegiate Base
ball, has to be one of the favorites
in the Northeast.
"This is the best thing that
could happen to us," sophomore
rightfielder Paul Carey said.
"We're playing some good teams
there — Kentucky is a good team,
and Clemson is no slouch . . . but
nobody will have the homefield
advantage."
"I think it's going to be good
for us — there's some good com
petition, obviously, but it's one of
the places we wanted to play,"
junior third baseman Ed Sprague
said. "We got a No. 2 seed, and
I think in some of the other
regionals we might not have been
able to get that. ... I think every
one's really excited about it —
it's someplace we've never been,
so we'll have that fresh attitude
going in."
For a few players, at least, the
trip to Connecticut will be a
homecoming of sorts. Four Stan
ford players are from the East
Coast: Carey (Weymouth, Mass.),
junior first baseman Ron Wit
meyer (West Bayshore, N.Y.),
sophomore pitcher Mark Carper
(Highland, Md.) and freshman
pitcher Mike Mussina (Mon
toursville, Pa.).
"It's nice — it feels like going
