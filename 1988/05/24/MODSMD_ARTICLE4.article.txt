# Round Two cut offs hit lowest in three years
## 
### Burke Smith Senior staff writer 
Despite some predictions that this
year's Round Two cut offs for under
graduate housing would plummet
dramatically because of the closing of
Roble Hall last winter, the cut offs,
made public today, actually increased
about 150 points to 3,892 for women
and 3,676 for men.
Director of Housing Rodger Whitney
said the increase was not surprising
because of factors such as the
decreased number of people in the
Draw this year, the same amount of
offered undergraduate spots as last

year, and the opening of new graduate
student housing next year.
Over the last three years, there have
been cont«rsten*ly low Drav cut offs
due to the unusually large class of
1988, which participated in the Draw
for the last time in the spring of 1987.
Whitney said large classes generally
have this effect, and expects a similar
crunch with the large incoming class
of 1992.
According to Whitney, 275 students
who did not receive assignments in
Round One were assigned in Round
Two, increasing the total of assigned
students to 81 percent of those who
originally entered the Draw.

The house with the lowest cut off
for men remained 558 Mayfield at 104.
For women, the cut off number for
the new American Indian house (for
merly Lathrop House) dropped from
2,201 to 179, edging out 558's cut off
of 191.
The houses that had no new male
assignments are American Studies,
558 Mayfield, Granada, Slavianskii
Dom (formerly Hurlburt House),
Storey, Theta Chi and Yost. No new
female assignments were made to
ATO, Cardenal, the French House,
Haus Mitt, Lamda Nu, Loro, Phi Sig
and the Suites.
The new graduate housing complex,

the Raines Houses, was "enormously
popular," Whitney said.
Although the number of students
entering the graduate student lottery
was very close to the number of avail
able spots, 150 assignable spaces
remain in Escondido Village and
Crothers Memorial Hall. Whitney at
tributed the spots to "picky" students
who were only willing to live in Raines.
The 150 spots in Escondido and
Crothers will first be offered to any
graduate students who join the waiting
list, and then may be filled with un
dergraduates from the waiting list.
Whitney said that all students
who participated in Round Two
of the Draw must take some ac
tion by June 3. Students can
either accept their assignment,
decline their assignment, accept
their assignment and join the
waiting list, or just join the
waiting list.
Groups that have been split in

the Draw can file a "split-group
petition" to be reunited, Whitney
said.
There are still a few unassigned
spots in undergraduate housing.
EAST House has four unassigned
spots for men, and Slavianskii
Dom has a few open spots. Whit
ney said those open spots will not
jeopardize those residences as
theme houses because EAST is
well above 90 percent occupancy
and Slavianskii is a new theme
house.
