# Law schools tackle concerns over faculty diversification issue
## 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
Law students and faculty members
both want a more diverse faculty, with
a higher percentage of minority and
female professors. Yet, student demon
strations here and at Harvard Law School
show a marked disagreement between
students and administrators over the
means of diversifying their faculties.
Minority student groups at both
schools have charged in demonstrations
during the last two weeks that the schools
are indifferent to affirmative action.
The student groups argue for numer-

ical quotas to bolster affirmative action,
while sympathetic administrations say a
vigorous search for minorities is needed,
using traditional hiring methods but
without the restraint of quotas.
But many students and faculty ques
tion the hiring methods used by the na
tion's pre-eminent law schools, and the
criteria that determine who gets tenure.
They argue that unwritten rules system
atically prevent most minority and female
candidates from getting tenure.

Currently, five female faculty and four
ethnic minority faculty — including two
blacks and two Latinos — are tenured
at Stanford Law School. Harvard's track
record is worse, with no women and only
four black men serving on the faculty,
and only two of them are tenured.
The traditional criteria
Law Prof. Charles Lawrence, one of
two black tenured professors at Stanford,
described the requirements for obtaining
tenure-track entry level positions at the
nation's foremost law schools — includ
ing Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Chicago,
UCLA, Virginia and Columbia:

• Attending the nation's
top law schools;
• Receiving the highest
grades in the school;
•Working on the
school's scholarly law
review; and
• Clerking for a U.S. Su
preme Court justice or
another high court, or
holding a prestigious job

in government or private practice.
Lawrence based his conclusions on the
career patterns observed from the faculty
of the most prestigious law schools. He
said the four criteria perpetuate the

status quo in law school faculties because
historically few minorities and women
have come through this track.
For example, until this year, in the
nearly 40-year history of the Stanford
Law Review, there has been only one
female editor. No blacks had ever served
on the Virginia Law Review until this
year.
And the Supreme Court has had the
same problems, an article in the San Jose
Mercury News charged last month. The
court keeps no records of the race or
gender of clerks, but the article found


Lawrence
that the first female clerk was
appointed to the court in 1944,
and that appointments in follow
ing years were slight. Currently,
eight of 33 clerks at the court are
women.
Criticism of the old methods
Harvard Law Prof. Derrick Bell,
a visiting professor at Stanford
two years ago, acknowledged that
clerking for a Supreme Court jus
tice and excelling at a top law
school and private practice are
valid criteria for consideration in
tenure cases, but claimed that
they should not be the only ones.
Bell received an apology from
Law School Dean Paul Brest last
December for mistreatment he
suffered while teaching here. A
course Bell taught on constitu
tional law was undermined by
supplementary lectures arranged
by faculty when students com
plained that Bell's course focused
too much on issues of race.
Bell said the hiring criteria are
based more on tradition than
reality and are insensitive to di
versity.
"There is the strong presump
tion among many faculty at the
elite schools that applicants with
these traditional credentials are

the ones with the greatest teach
ing and scholarly potential." Bell
said. "The problem is, there is a
multiplicity of excellences, and
these are often overlooked in ad
hering to tradition."
Questioning scholarly excellence
Decisions for tenure are subjec
tive. A school tailors its recruit
ment to meet specific needs.
Schools call upon faculty to look
at a candidate's writings, teaching
ability and reputation and evalu
ate whether the applicant fits the
spot.
But many students and faculty
question the validity of these
standards. How is top-level schol
arship evaluated? Lawrence
pointed to one sticky example,
Stanford's controversial denial of
tenure to Robin West. West, a
white woman, was a visiting pro
fessor at Stanford a few years ago
and was considered a foremost
feminist legal scholar.
Feminist scholarship, like mi
nority scholarship, is difficult for
traditional faculty at the elite
schools to evaluate, Lawrence
said.
"What is the kind of writing
that we will consider as ground
breaking?" Lawrence asked.
"Many of the articles turned out
by minority and women lawyers
come out of an intellectual exper
ience, perspective that is not
mainstream."

Yet the criteria persist for his
torical and psychological reasons,
Bell said, claiming that faculties
need to "reaffirm their sense of
esteem" by appointing people like
them.
Two answers
One answer to the dilemma is
a quota system with a commit
ment to leaving tenured positions
open until the school changes its
criteria or finds quality minority
and female faculty who meet Uni
versity standards.
Brest and Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal contend, though, that
more aggressive recruitment of
minorities in the entry-level posi
tions is the answer. They argue
that the criteria used to evaluate
candidates for tenure are valid.
Student demands for a quota sys
tem are shortsighted and
endanger the quality of an insti
tution, Friedenthal and Brest say.
Friedenthal denied that there
are no unwritten criteria for ten
ure. "There's no question you
have to be a substantial re
searcher. ... I don't care who you
are." Research and teaching are
the major criteria, he said.
The real question students
should ask, Friedenthal said, is
not how but how hard the Uni
versity tries to hire minority and
female faculty. "They have no idea
how hard we try to find quality
faculty," he said.

Criticism of the old methods
Harvard Law Prof. Derrick Bell,
a visiting professor at Stanford
two years ago, acknowledged that
clerking for a Supreme Court jus
tice and excelling at a top law
school and private practice are
valid criteria for consideration in
tenure cases, but claimed that
they should not be the only ones.
Bell received an apology from
Law School Dean Paul Brest last
December for mistreatment he
suffered while teaching here. A
course Bell taught on constitu
tional law was undermined by
supplementary lectures arranged
by faculty when students com
plained that Bell's course focused
too much on issues of race.
Bell said the hiring criteria are
based more on tradition than
reality and are insensitive to di
versity.
"There is the strong presump
tion among many faculty at the
elite schools that applicants with
these traditional credentials are

the ones with the greatest teach
ing and scholarly potential." Bell
said. "The problem is, there is a
multiplicity of excellences, and
these are often overlooked in ad
hering to tradition."
Questioning scholarly excellence
Decisions for tenure are subjec
tive. A school tailors its recruit
ment to meet specific needs.
Schools call upon faculty to look
at a candidate's writings, teaching
ability and reputation and evalu
ate whether the applicant fits the
spot.
But many students and faculty
question the validity of these
standards. How is top-level schol
arship evaluated? Lawrence
pointed to one sticky example,
Stanford's controversial denial of
tenure to Robin West. West, a
white woman, was a visiting pro
fessor at Stanford a few years ago
and was considered a foremost
feminist legal scholar.
Feminist scholarship, like mi
nority scholarship, is difficult for
traditional faculty at the elite
schools to evaluate, Lawrence
said.
"What is the kind of writing
that we will consider as ground
breaking?" Lawrence asked.
"Many of the articles turned out
by minority and women lawyers
come out of an intellectual exper
ience, perspective that is not
mainstream."

Yet the criteria persist for his
torical and psychological reasons,
Bell said, claiming that faculties
need to "reaffirm their sense of
esteem" by appointing people like
them.
Two answers
One answer to the dilemma is
a quota system with a commit
ment to leaving tenured positions
open until the school changes its
criteria or finds quality minority
and female faculty who meet Uni
versity standards.
Brest and Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal contend, though, that
more aggressive recruitment of
minorities in the entry-level posi
tions is the answer. They argue
that the criteria used to evaluate
candidates for tenure are valid.
Student demands for a quota sys
tem are shortsighted and
endanger the quality of an insti
tution, Friedenthal and Brest say.
Friedenthal denied that there
are no unwritten criteria for ten
ure. "There's no question you
have to be a substantial re
searcher. ... I don't care who you
are." Research and teaching are
the major criteria, he said.
The real question students
should ask, Friedenthal said, is
not how but how hard the Uni
versity tries to hire minority and
female faculty. "They have no idea
how hard we try to find quality
faculty," he said.
Law students and faculty members
both want a more diverse faculty, with
a higher percentage of minority and
female professors. Yet, student demon
strations here and at Harvard Law School
show a marked disagreement between
students and administrators over the
means of diversifying their faculties.
Minority student groups at both
schools have charged in demonstrations
during the last two weeks that the schools
are indifferent to affirmative action.
The student groups argue for numer-

ical quotas to bolster affirmative action,
while sympathetic administrations say a
vigorous search for minorities is needed,
using traditional hiring methods but
without the restraint of quotas.
But many students and faculty ques
tion the hiring methods used by the na
tion's pre-eminent law schools, and the
criteria that determine who gets tenure.
They argue that unwritten rules system
atically prevent most minority and female
candidates from getting tenure.

Currently, five female faculty and four
ethnic minority faculty — including two
blacks and two Latinos — are tenured
at Stanford Law School. Harvard's track
record is worse, with no women and only
four black men serving on the faculty,
and only two of them are tenured.
The traditional criteria
Law Prof. Charles Lawrence, one of
two black tenured professors at Stanford,
described the requirements for obtaining
tenure-track entry level positions at the
nation's foremost law schools — includ
ing Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Chicago,
UCLA, Virginia and Columbia:

• Attending the nation's
top law schools;
• Receiving the highest
grades in the school;
•Working on the
school's scholarly law
review; and
• Clerking for a U.S. Su
preme Court justice or
another high court, or
holding a prestigious job

in government or private practice.
Lawrence based his conclusions on the
career patterns observed from the faculty
of the most prestigious law schools. He
said the four criteria perpetuate the

status quo in law school faculties because
historically few minorities and women
have come through this track.
For example, until this year, in the
nearly 40-year history of the Stanford
Law Review, there has been only one
female editor. No blacks had ever served
on the Virginia Law Review until this
year.
And the Supreme Court has had the
same problems, an article in the San Jose
Mercury News charged last month. The
court keeps no records of the race or
gender of clerks, but the article found

that the first female clerk was
appointed to the court in 1944,
and that appointments in follow
ing years were slight. Currently,
eight of 33 clerks at the court are
women.
