# Law schools tackle concerns over faculty diversification issue
## 
### Bobby Schrader Editorial staff 
Law students and faculty members
both want a more diverse faculty, with
a higher percentage of minority and
female professors. Yet, student demon
strations here and at Harvard Law School
show a marked disagreement between
students and administrators over the
means of diversifying their faculties.
Minority student groups at both
schools have charged in demonstrations
during the last two weeks that the schools
are indifferent to affirmative action.
The student groups argue for numer-

ical quotas to bolster affirmative action,
while sympathetic administrations say a
vigorous search for minorities is needed,
using traditional hiring methods but
without the restraint of quotas.
But many students and faculty ques
tion the hiring methods used by the na
tion's pre-eminent law schools, and the
criteria that determine who gets tenure.
They argue that unwritten rules system
atically prevent most minority and female
candidates from getting tenure.

Currently, five female faculty and four
ethnic minority faculty — including two
blacks and two Latinos — are tenured
at Stanford Law School. Harvard's track
record is worse, with no women and only
four black men serving on the faculty,
and only two of them are tenured.
The traditional criteria
Law Prof. Charles Lawrence, one of
two black tenured professors at Stanford,
described the requirements for obtaining
tenure-track entry level positions at the
nation's foremost law schools — includ
ing Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Chicago,
UCLA, Virginia and Columbia:

• Attending the nation's
top law schools;
• Receiving the highest
grades in the school;
•Working on the
school's scholarly law
review; and
• Clerking for a U.S. Su
preme Court justice or
another high court, or
holding a prestigious job

in government or private practice.
Lawrence based his conclusions on the
career patterns observed from the faculty
of the most prestigious law schools. He
said the four criteria perpetuate the

status quo in law school faculties because
historically few minorities and women
have come through this track.
For example, until this year, in the
nearly 40-year history of the Stanford
Law Review, there has been only one
female editor. No blacks had ever served
on the Virginia Law Review until this
year.
And the Supreme Court has had the
same problems, an article in the San Jose
Mercury News charged last month. The
court keeps no records of the race or
gender of clerks, but the article found
