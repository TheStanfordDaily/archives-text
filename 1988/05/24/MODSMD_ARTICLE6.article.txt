# Med School group seeks reform in curriculum quality, planning
## 
### Dean Chisiu 
Students at the Stanford Med
ical School have been circulating
a letter for the past three weeks
calling for increased faculty
student dialogue to modify and
re-evaluate that school's curricu
lum.
A large number of medical stu
dents have formed the group, Stu
dents for an Improved Curricu
lum, with the aim of increasing
student input in the Med School's
curriculum-planning process.
For the past three weeks, the
group has been circulating a letter
calling for the following:
• a more thorough process of
course evaluation;
• increased coordination within
and between courses, with a re
duction in redundancy in course
content;
• a serious review of the re
quired course list — tagged the
"grid system" — in order to res
tore more flexibility; and
• more meaningful student in
put into shaping the curriculum
at all levels.
Student and faculty response to
the group and to the letter has

been favorable. First-year medical
student Janet Shen, one of the
group's organizers, said that al
though the core group consists of
25 students, about 50 have come
to the group's impromptu meet
ings and 150 of the approximately
450 students at the Med School
have signed the group's letter.
In addition, a forum organized
by SIC and held last Wednesday
was well attended by both stu
dents and faculty.
An audience of over 100 atten
ded the discussion, which featured
a student-faculty panel that
talked about the Med School cur
riculum.
The faculty members on the
panel included Assoc. Dean for
Student Affairs Robert Cutler;
Ross McDougall, chair of the Fac
ulty Senate; Ron Rosenfeld, chair
of the Committee on Courses and
Curriculum; and Med School
Profs. Robert Chase and Paul
Berg.
Cutler described the forum as
"a very cordial and productive
meeting."
According to Chase, the curric
ulum at the Med School is based
on students' suggestions more so

than at most other schools. "Just
like a good physician has to listen
to patients, a good medical school
listens to its students," he said.
However, Chase added, "profes
sionals should have a good deal
to say about the curriculum."
One of the main issues dis
cussed at the forum was the pos
sibility of creating "some sort of
mechanism for more meaningful
input by students," Shen said.
She said that the only mecha
nism existing now in many
courses, the course evaluation at
the end of the term, is inadequate.
SIC is starting its own evalua
tions of courses, focusing mainly
on first-year, required bourses.
The new process involves evalua
tions of each individual lecture in
the course, and a face-to-face
meeting with faculty at the end
of the quarter.
Another problem that SIC has
been addressing is the apparent
lack of communication between
different departments. Nat Kuhn,
a member of SIC, said that no
one has an overall picture of the
curriculum at the Med School,
with the result that some courses
overlap. A new office with the
specific task of overseeing the en
tire curriculum should be created,
Shen and Kuhn said.
The third problem which SIC
is focusing on is the required core
curriculum — a buzzword at
Stanford. Although Shen agrees
with Chase's assertion that Stan
ford offers a large selection of elec
tive courses, she said she feels,
as do many students, that "the
core curriculum is so overwhelm
ing that it is pretty hard to take
elective courses."
"It is time for a serious review
of the grid system in order to
restore more flexibility to Stan
ford's curriculum," the SIC letter

states.
According to Chase, who has
been at the Med School for more
than 20 years, the feelings of stu
dents about the flexibility issue
run through a cycle. Not many
years ago, when* it was entirely
elective, the studerts asked for
more guidance. The current grid
system was introduced four years
' ago and is up for review next year.
"The faculty and the adminis
tration have been extremely
receptive so far," Shen said. Cut
ler confirmed that, saying, "[SIC
membersl will try to implement
the new ideas and we will try to
honor that. ~ . We do not resist
our students."
There is a consensus among the
participants in the dialogue about
the Med School curriculum that
"there is no hostility whatsoever
among students and faculty."
