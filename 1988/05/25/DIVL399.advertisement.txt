AUTOGRAPHING
A HISTORY OF SEXUALITY IN AMERICA
A unique and comprehensive history
of sexuality in America—from the
English colonists and Native Americans
to today's bitter clashes over abortion,
homosexuality, and teenage pregnancy.
"the first venture of its kind that I know of, Intimate Matters
comprehensively surveys the history of sexuality in
America, covering an astonishing array of material while
never losing organizational coherence or conceptual
clarity.. .. The writing is so clear and vivid the reader does
not get bogged down Rather, one is coined along from
section to section with rapt attention I am especially im
pressed that in a book jointly authored, theie seem to be so
few examples of disparity of stylo or awkward transitions. I
am especially pleased with the attention the book gives
to differences of race and class Always attuned to issues
of political sensitivity, D'Emilio and Freedman convey
throughout a sense of compassion and empathy for those'
they are writing about, together with a strong commitment
to fairness.... A wonder ful book "
