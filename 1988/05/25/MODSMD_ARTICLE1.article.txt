# Men's tennis grabs another NCAA title

ATHENS, Ga. — Two minutes after
Louisiana State's Mike Hammett edged
Glenn Solomon 2-6, 7-6 (11-9), 7-6 (7-5)
to bring Louisiana State University to
within 4-2, Stanford's David Wheaton
and Jeff Tarango "ro sham boed" for
the right to strike the shot that clinched
the Cardinal's 1988 NCAA Tennis
Championship.
Wheaton came up rock, Tarango scis
sors. Then, with LSU's Jeff Brown serv
ing on a sudden death 3-3 point at 5-6
to stay in the match, Wheaton nailed
a topspin backhand that snakebit Brown
at the net.
Wheaton and Tarango had beaten
Brown and Felix Barrientos 7-6 (10-8),
7-5 yesterday at Lindsey Hopkins In
door Courts and top-seeded Stanford
had won the NCAA title 5-2 over No.
2 seeded Louisiana State.
"Winning the NCAAs is an in
describable feeling," said Wheaton, a
freshman. "It's such a long year to the
NCAAs. Everyone has to play well to
win; it's a real team effort. It's the
greatest thing by far in college tennis.
I'll always remember this."

The Cardinal, ranked No. 1 in the
preseason poll with Georgia, finished
25-1. LSU ended 27-2.
"I had a few tears," said Stanford
Coach Dick Gould, who has now guided
nine NCAA champions on the Farm.
"A lot of emotions built up during the
match. If I looked calm, I wasn't."
"It feels great," said senior Patrick
McEnroe, who also was a member of
the Stanford national championship
winning team in 1986. "It's special to
come out and finish the year the way
we thought we should."
Because of rain, the match was moved
indoors and started over an hour late.
According to the bitter LSU Coach Jerry
Simmons, moving the match indoors
may have cost his team the title.
"Playing indoors hurt us," said Sim
mons, even though his team reached
the final of the National Indoor Team
Championships in February. "It hurt
us at No. 2 (singles). That (outdoor)
surface is made for Uribe. It hurt us
at No. 4. We probably would have won
No. 4, 5 and 6 outside — and maybe
two and three."
Simmons' sour grapes notwithstand
ing, Stanford flat outplayed LSU.
Indeed, Solomon had two match points

against Hammett in the second set and
a win at No. 6 singles would have elim
inated the Tigers after singles play.
Tarango smoked Uribe 6-2, 6-3 at
No. 2 singles to get the Cardinal off to
a fast 1-0 start.
Wheaton followed with a controver
sial 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-0 win at No. 1
singles over LSU's Jeff Brown to put
Stanford up 2-0.
With Wheaton up 2-0 in the final set
and serving at on a sudden death 3-3
point, he hit an overhead that Brown
called out. Wheaton questioned the call,
and Umpire Bill Gutteridge overruled
Brown's call.
Brown rushed the net, argued with
the umpire and was assessed a game
penalty. What could have been a 2-1
Wheaton lead on serve in the deciding
set suddenly became an insurmountable
4-0 Wheaton advantage.
"It's hard enough to beat David
Wheaton without having to beat a 70-
year-old senile man with dark glasses
on," Brown snapped.
"That call was out of left field," Sim
mons complained. "Giving a game
penalty was way out of line."

"If a guy was sitting in the
chair with a telescope focused in
on the line, that's one thing, but
he made the decision from clear
on the other side of the court,"
he added. "That call really turned
the momentum of the whole
match."
Barrientos cut the Cardinal lead
to 2-1 by outslugging McEnroe
1-6, 7-5, 6-1.
Freshman Martin Blackman
chipped and charged his way to
a 1-6, 6-2, 6-3 win over Donny
Leaycraft at No. 4 singles to ex
tend Stanford's lead to 3-1.
After staying on the baseline in
the first set, Blackman seized con
trol of the net in the second and
third.
"I decided I needed to get to
the net as soon as possible,"
Blackman said. "After I knew
what I had to do, it was just a
matter of doing it."
Sophomore Jeff Cathrall fol
lowed with a 6-4, 6-4 win over
Roland So at No. 5 singles.
Cathrall was the aggressor
throughout, winning the big
points at the net.
With Stanford ahead 4-1, a
Solomon victory could have
ousted the Tigers in singles play.
But Hammett wouldn't budge
an inch on big points, coming up
with winner after winner when
Solomon had him down. In a
showcase of the determination
and talent each team displayed at
every position yesterday, neither
player gave in, nor held anything
back.
LSU breathed momentarily at
4-2.
Five hours and 20 minutes after
the match began — with Cathrall
and sophomore Eric Peus winning
in the third set against Uribe and
Leaycroft at No. 3 doubles —
Wheaton struck the shot that
brought the Cardinal its seventh
NCAA title since the team format
was instituted in 1977.

According to the bitter LSU Coach Jerry
Simmons, moving the match indoors
may have cost his team the title.
"Playing indoors hurt us," said Sim
mons, even though his team reached
the final of the National Indoor Team
Championships in February. "It hurt
us at No. 2 (singles). That (outdoor)
surface is made for Uribe. It hurt us
at No. 4. We probably would have won
No. 4, 5 and 6 outside — and maybe
two and three."
Simmons' sour grapes notwithstand
ing, Stanford flat outplayed LSU.
Indeed, Solomon had two match points

against Hammett in the second set and
a win at No. 6 singles would have elim
inated the Tigers after singles play.
Tarango smoked Uribe 6-2, 6-3 at
No. 2 singles to get the Cardinal off to
a fast 1-0 start.
Wheaton followed with a controver
sial 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-0 win at No. 1
singles over LSU's Jeff Brown to put
Stanford up 2-0.
With Wheaton up 2-0 in the final set
and serving at on a sudden death 3-3
point, he hit an overhead that Brown
called out. Wheaton questioned the call,
and Umpire Bill Gutteridge overruled
Brown's call.
Brown rushed the net, argued with
the umpire and was assessed a game
penalty. What could have been a 2-1
Wheaton lead on serve in the deciding
set suddenly became an insurmountable
4-0 Wheaton advantage.
"It's hard enough to beat David
Wheaton without having to beat a 70-
year-old senile man with dark glasses
on," Brown snapped.
"That call was out of left field," Sim
mons complained. "Giving a game
penalty was way out of line."

"If a guy was sitting in the
chair with a telescope focused in
on the line, that's one thing, but
he made the decision from clear
on the other side of the court,"
he added. "That call really turned
the momentum of the whole
match."
Barrientos cut the Cardinal lead
to 2-1 by outslugging McEnroe
1-6, 7-5, 6-1.
Freshman Martin Blackman
chipped and charged his way to
a 1-6, 6-2, 6-3 win over Donny
Leaycraft at No. 4 singles to ex
tend Stanford's lead to 3-1.
After staying on the baseline in
the first set, Blackman seized con
trol of the net in the second and
third.
"I decided I needed to get to
the net as soon as possible,"
Blackman said. "After I knew
what I had to do, it was just a
matter of doing it."
Sophomore Jeff Cathrall fol
lowed with a 6-4, 6-4 win over
Roland So at No. 5 singles.
Cathrall was the aggressor
throughout, winning the big
points at the net.
With Stanford ahead 4-1, a
Solomon victory could have
ousted the Tigers in singles play.
But Hammett wouldn't budge
an inch on big points, coming up
with winner after winner when
Solomon had him down. In a
showcase of the determination
and talent each team displayed at
every position yesterday, neither
player gave in, nor held anything
back.
LSU breathed momentarily at
4-2.
Five hours and 20 minutes after
the match began — with Cathrall
and sophomore Eric Peus winning
in the third set against Uribe and
Leaycroft at No. 3 doubles —
Wheaton struck the shot that
brought the Cardinal its seventh
NCAA title since the team format
was instituted in 1977.

The NCAA Championship Trophy was awarded to the entire Stanford team yesterday
but freshman David Wheaton played a big part in capturing it by hitting the winning
shot.

ATHENS, Ga. — Two minutes after
Louisiana State's Mike Hammett edged
Glenn Solomon 2-6, 7-6 (11-9), 7-6 (7-5)
to bring Louisiana State University to
within 4-2, Stanford's David Wheaton
and Jeff Tarango "ro sham boed" for
the right to strike the shot that clinched
the Cardinal's 1988 NCAA Tennis
Championship.
Wheaton came up rock, Tarango scis
sors. Then, with LSU's Jeff Brown serv
ing on a sudden death 3-3 point at 5-6
to stay in the match, Wheaton nailed
a topspin backhand that snakebit Brown
at the net.
Wheaton and Tarango had beaten
Brown and Felix Barrientos 7-6 (10-8),
7-5 yesterday at Lindsey Hopkins In
door Courts and top-seeded Stanford
had won the NCAA title 5-2 over No.
2 seeded Louisiana State.
"Winning the NCAAs is an in
describable feeling," said Wheaton, a
freshman. "It's such a long year to the
NCAAs. Everyone has to play well to
win; it's a real team effort. It's the
greatest thing by far in college tennis.
I'll always remember this."

The Cardinal, ranked No. 1 in the
preseason poll with Georgia, finished
25-1. LSU ended 27-2.
"I had a few tears," said Stanford
Coach Dick Gould, who has now guided
nine NCAA champions on the Farm.
"A lot of emotions built up during the
match. If I looked calm, I wasn't."
"It feels great," said senior Patrick
McEnroe, who also was a member of
the Stanford national championship
winning team in 1986. "It's special to
come out and finish the year the way
we thought we should."
Because of rain, the match was moved
indoors and started over an hour late.
According to the bitter LSU Coach Jerry

may have cost his team the title.
