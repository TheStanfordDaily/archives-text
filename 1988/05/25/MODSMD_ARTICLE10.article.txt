# Despite a rocky road, COP meets objectives
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
This year's ASSU Council of Presidents
has taken the bumpy road to achieving its
campaign goals, with some success and a
lot of strife.
Petty politics have plagued the workings
of the whole ASSU and one COP member
has been alienated from the other three,
preventing the council from achieving
much more than its original campaign
agenda.
Today is the last official day of the cur
rent COP, known as the Equalizers. The
new COP, A New Slate of Mind, will take
over the ASSU executive branch tomorrow.
COP member Roechelle Smith said "po
litical games," combined with difficulty in
approaching the other three members, have
alienated her and hurt relations between
the COP and the rest of the ASSU.
Leonard Adler, Jim Durkin and Maria
Canas, the other COP members, admit that
relations with Smith have been difficult
and regret that she feels isolated.
Relations with the ASSU Senate have
been no easy ride, either. Many senators
supported the COP, but Stacey Leyton,
deputy senate chair and a member of A
New Slate, said there have "definitely been
some tensions" between the COP and sen
ate, resulting in a "counterproductive" re
lationship. "We've felt like COP members
have not been working with us," she said.
Many of the COP-senate problems stem
from the polarizing effect of the People's
Platform, which dominated the senate this
year but lost the COP election last year.
Despite the problems, all COP members
agree that most of their original campaign
goals, which centered around student serv
ice, have been fulfilled. The accomplish
ments include:
• Improved outreach through regular office
hours and a table in White Plaza;
• The establishment of straw polls to in

crease student input;
• More student services including condom
dispensers, change machines and organized
entertainment options; and
• Administrative streamlining of the ASSU.
Even Leyton, a People's Platform mem
ber who often spearheads senate opposition
to the COP, said the current COP has
"done a good job of promoting student
needs," in spite of what she called "petty"
infighting. Leyton said the COP's greatest
asset is a "high level of dedication and
commitment."
"Overall, it was a good year," Canas
agreed. Canas couldn't recall any failed
projects but admitted that it was a "definite
learning year" for the COP. The COP could
have narrowed its goals and worked more
closely on projects, she said.
The four started out the year with the
philosophy that they could accomplish
more as individuals targeting special proj
ects than as a unified group. Durkin said
division may have resulted, but that indi
vidual project management was a plus, all
things considered.
Durkin took the role of administrator in
the ASSU; Adler was student service co
ordinator; Canas pushed women's issues;
and Smith focused on minority relations.
The theory ran into problems this spring,
though, when some tough issues hit the
ASSU, and the COP could have used a
unified front. When the BSU charged rac
ism at a senate meeting in April, Smith,
who is black, agreed that institutional rac
ism exists in the ASSU. The other three
disagreed vehemently.
The most glaring example of the crippled
relations occurred four weeks ago, when
Canas, Adler and Durkin temporarily
vetoed the appointment of black junior Ra
chel Wiesen as director of ASSU Public
Affairs without consulting Smith. Only
three signatures were needed for a veto,
and Smith had not been in the office for
a week due to illness.

Smith strongly opposed the veto when
she learned of the action. But although
she disagreed with the other three on racial
issues this spring, she did not fault the
others because she said she is more sen
sitized to institutional racism through her
experience as a black student.
Canas, who is Latino, said she has never
experienced racism in the ASSU.
Nevertheless, the racism charges accen
tuated the COP split. "Since I spoke up
[about my perceptions of racism] I feel like
I have been shunned," Smith said.
"My name is not on most of the bills
that are proposed by the COP," Smith said,
adding that the omission of consulting her
on the Wiesen veto was not unusual. "It's
a matter of telling me what is going on

. . . they could have easily told me when I
was there," she said.
Adler and Durkin responded that the
communication gap resulted because of the
different work habits of the four. While
Smith does most of her work in the com
munity and on the senate appropriations
committee, Durkin said, "The rest of us
spend most our time in the office."
Although the group originally decided to
work individually, Smith said the relation
ship grew into a 3-to-l division. "They
tended to leave me out unless I was needed
for a decision."
Adler replied that the alienation is "not
something we've actively done." He said
most decisions are made by the members
in the office at the time, and he expressed
regret that Smith feels alienated.

The Equalizers, junior Leonard Adler and seniors Maria Cartas, Jim Durkin and
Roechelle Smith, celebrate together the day after winning the Council of Presidents
race last spring. The slate's plan to work on individual projects — while mostly
successful — eventually led to division among their ranks.
