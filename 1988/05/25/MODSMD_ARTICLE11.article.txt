Japan's foreign assets: 1 trillion
lOKYO — Japan's net foreign assets rose
last year to more than $240 billion and its
claims against the rest of the world rose by
47.3 percent to exceed $1 trillion for the first
time, finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa re
ported yesterday.
Claims against Other countries, in the form
of Japanese loans and investments in securi
ties, foreign-based corporations and foreign
real estate, totaled $1.07 trillion, up from
$727.3 billion at the end of 1986, Miyazawa
said. Other countries' claims against Japan,
ho said, were $830.9 billion, up from $546.9
billion.
I he $240.7 billion surplus, an increase of
$60 billion, is expected to make Japan the
world's richest nation in terms of net foreign
assets for the third year in a row.
In contrast, the United States, at the peak
of its overseas wealth in 1981, had net foreign
assets of $140.7 billion. By the end of 1986,
the United States had plunged into a net
foreign debt amounting to $263.6 billion.
Although other nations have not yet an
nounced their net foreign asset figures for last
year, Miyazawa said it appears certain that
Japan will be the world's No. 1 creditor for
the third year in a row. Britain ranked second
in 1986, with $169.6 billion.
On May 16, University of Southern Califor
nia Prof. Richard Drobnick forecasted in a
speech that average annual surpluses of $70
billion in Japan's current accounts, which
roughly equal additions to net foreign assets,
will continue for the next five years. If so,
Japan's net foreign assets will more than
double by 1992.
NJ. seizes Jersey city schools
NEW YORK — New Jersey officials moved
yesterday to seize control of Jersey City's
public schools, saying that "political patronage,
union pressure and cronyism" have imperiled
the education of its 30,000 students.
Citing principals who cannot control their
schools, students who cannot pass a state
proficiency exams and audits that show finan
cial irregularities, state Education Commis
sioner Saul Cooperman ordered the nation's
first takeover of a failing school district.
The takeover would take at least a year to
implement and is likely to be delayed far longer
if school offlcials carry out their pledge to
challenge the move in court. A handful of
other states have laws authorizing such
takeovers, but the Education Association of
the States said the power has never been
exercised.
Jersey City Mayor Anthony Cucci (D), who
has been criticized for promoting his step
daughter, a school board clerk, said he wel
comed the state's intervention. "Twenty years
of neglect in our school system cannot be
turned around completely in the less than
three years I have been in office," he said.
