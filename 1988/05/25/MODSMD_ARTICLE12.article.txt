# House votes to override trade bill veto
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan, criticizing a provision to guar
antee workers of advance notice of
plant closings and layoffs, vetoed the
omnibus trade bill yesterday, and
within four hours the Democratic
controlled House voted to override the
veto by a 308-113 margin.
The fate of the massive bill now lies
in the Senate, where Republicans are
confident that they have more than
the votes needed to uphold the veto.
The Senate's original vote in favor of
the bill was 63-36, three votes short
of the two-thirds majority that will be
needed to make the bill law over
Reagan's veto.
Senate leaders delayed the override
vote until after the Senate returns
June 6 from its Memorial Day recess.
In his message explaining his veto,
Reagan said little about the bill's main
provisions to tighten procedures for
retaliating against trading practices by
other nations that are found to be
unfair.
Instead, he concentrated on the
provision requiring companies with
more than 100 employees to give 60
days' notice of plant closings and m^jor

layoffs.
Democrats promptly injected the
issue into the presidential election
campaign. Massachusetts Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis, the all-but-certain
Democratic presidential nominee, told
reporters that "to veto this bill because
it will give people and their families
60 days' notice before they're laid off
seems to me to be unconscionable."
Reagan, aware that the plant closing
issue would be turned against him,
also listed other objectionable features,
including a limit on Alaskan oil exports
and provisions calling for official study
commissions on industrial competi
tiveness and Third World debt.
He also mentioned two provisions
that had never before been raised as
major problems.
One, unpopular in farm states,
would allow expanded ethanol imports
from Caribbean sugar-producing
countries â€” even though that provi
sion is in harmony with the adminis
tration's own Caribbean Basin Initia
tive. The other would reduce executive
authority to label foreign-made films,
tapes and recordings with a political
content as "propaganda."

In addition to these provisions, the
bill would imposes a 0.15 percent im
port fee to provide job training for
those left jobless in industries beset
by import competition.
Reagan soft-peddled earlier admin
istration objections to provisions of the
bill that many Republicans and some
economists had decried as protec
tionist. Instead, he asserted his desire
to sign a trade bill this year and called
on Congress to pass a second bill with
out the objectionable features.
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said that Reagan would
"probably" sign a bill if only the plant
closing and Alaska oil provisions were
excised. House Ways and Means Com
mittee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-111., chief House architect of the bill,
told reporters that he was "convinced"
that Reagan would sign a bill stripped
of only those provisions.
But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-
Ohio, the strongest Senate supporter
of the plant-closing provision, has
threatened to filibuster and almost
certainly kill anv new trade bill that
does not contain the plant-closing

provision.
In his veto message, Reagan ap
proached the plant-closing issue in gin
gerly fashion, describing it as a well
meaning gesture that would in practice
reduce employment, just as similar leg
islation in Europe has dampened
hiring and business formation.
"I support voluntarily giving
workers and communities as much ad
vance warning as possible before a
layoff or a closing becomes necessary,"
Reagan added.
However much Reagan tried to
hedge his message, Democrats saw in
the veto message a golden opportunity
to woo back blue-collar voters who
have voted for Reagan in the past two
presidential elections.
Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., re
ferring to the administration's effort
to force Panamanian strongman
Manuel Noriega from power in return
for dropping drug-trafficking charges
against him in Florida, told Reagan
from the House floor: "You are giving
Noriega six months' notice. Why won't
you give the American worker 60
days?"
