# Reagan moves to fill two top justice posts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Nearly
two months after two top-level
Department of Justice officials
resigned to distance themselves
from Attorney General Edwin
Meese Ill's legal difficulties,
President Reagan yesterday
nominated replacements for
Deputy Attorney General Ar
nold Burns and Assistant At
torney General William Weld.
Harold Christensen, a vet
eran Utah lawyer, has been
named to replace Burns in the
department's No. 2 post. Ed
ward Dennis Jr., the U.S. at
torney in Philadelphia, has
been named to head the Crim
inal Division, succeeding Weld.
Their nominations end
several weeks of difficult ef
forts to seek candidates who
were qualified and willing to
take the high-ranking jobs.
Several earlier choices either
rejected initial approaches or
withdrew their names from
consideration — at least one
of whom declined an offer be
cause he feared being tainted
by Meese's problems, depart
ment sources said.
Meese, talking with
reporters in his office, said that
he could not "imagine any rea

son" that Christensen or Den
nis would encounter any diffi
culties in Senate confirmation
proceedings.
After the report by indepen
dent counsel James McKay is
released, the committee has in
dicated that it will seek tes
timony from Burns and Weld,
as well as the attorney general
himself, as part of its own in
vestigation of why the two top
officials quit.
In a meeting last month,
sources have said, both officials
told Reagan that Meese should
resign for the good of the de
partment. Burns reportedly
told Reagan that Meese had
"lost his moral authority to
lead the department," and
Weld is said to have presented
Reagan with "an oral indict
ment" of the attorney general.
It has not been decided
whether the Judiciary Commit
tee will delay confirmation
hearings for Christensen, Den
nis and Francis Keating, who
has been nominated to the No.
3 post of associate attorney
general.
