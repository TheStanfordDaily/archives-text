# Senate moves on INF treaty
## Leaders try to end treaty debate before Moscow summit 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Senate leaders moved
to end the laborious debate on the medium
range missile treaty yesterday by filing a
procedural petition that could produce a
final vote in time for the pact to be sealed
by President Reagan and Mikhail Gorba
chev at the Moscow summit.
For the first time since the debate
reached the Senate floor a week ago, leaders
were optimistic that they could wind up
the ratification fight in time for the treaty
documents to be exchanged between the
president and the general secretary of the
Soviet Communist Party.
The leaders met with Reagan at the
White House yesterday morning, and Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said Majority
Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia gave
the president his assurance that the treaty
will shortly get the long-awaited Senate
approval.
Reagan leaves Washington Wednesday
en route to Helsinki, Finland, for a stopover
on his way to the Soviet capital, but White
House chief of staff Howard Baker Jr. will
remain behind to keep tabs Senate's
deliberations.
If all goes according to the plan devised
by Senate leaders yesterday, Baker will
take the Senate's approved resolution of
ratification with him when he leaves to
join the presidential party in Moscow Sun
day.
The petition to end debate bore the name
of 22 senators, including the leaders of
both parties. Under Senate rules, a formal
motion will probably be introduced some
time around 1 a.m. EDT Thursday, with
60 votes needed to approve it.

If it passes, 30 hours of debate would
then be allowed before the pact, under
negotiation between the U.S. and Soviet
governments for nearly eight years, would
come to a vote.
The resort to a cloture petition came
reluctantly and even after the petition was
filed some senators still held out hope that
compromises could be reached to avoid im
posing a cutoff of debate.
Although the use of such a tactic in a
treaty debate is unusual, it has notable
precedents.
In 1919, the Senate invoked cloture in
the debate on the Treaty of Versailles,
which ended World War I, and in 1972 it
used the device to shut off debate on the
resolution of ratification accompanying the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
Both Byrd and Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., said yesterday afternoon that
they still hope the holdouts will agree to
wind up their amendments to the treaty
text so the Senate can begin consideration
of the resolution of ratification, where
there is a sharp division among Republi
cans and Democrats over a provision added
by the Foreign Relations Committee. There
was no sign of compromise, however.
The controversial provision, sponsored
by Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., asserts
that the meaning of the treaty is deter
mined by the Senate's interpretation based
upon the authoritative testimony it has
received from Reagan administration wit
nesses. It also seeks to prevent any rein
terpretation of the agreement by a future
administration.
