Twin sisyphuses with
their rock, English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz and Political
Science Prof. John Manley are still
trying to depoliticize the Hoover
Institution.
They deserve our support, but
they must not adopt a short
sighted view of Hoover that may
drive an excellent resource away
from Stanford.
Stubborn as ever, Hoover
refuses to agree to their drive to
bring the institution under normal
academic governance or, failing
that, to sever ties with the Uni
versity.
Manley and Rebholz have not
budged the University Trustees on
Hoover-Stanford relations. Last
week they submitted their third
petition in the last five years ur
ging the Faculty Senate to pass a
strong resolution influencing the
Trustees. Nothing much has
changed in actual policy.
Hoover remains partisan,
despite its protests to the contrary.
President Reagan, an honorary
Hoover fellow, counts on the con
servative think tank for policy ad
vice and has personally honored
its fellows on numerous occasions.
Fellowships at Hoover are ap
pointed not just with scholarship
in mind, but also ideology. And
Hoover's stated mission is to com
bat Marxism — a mission un
tenable in an open-minded univer
sity that purports to uphold aca
demic freedom at all costs.
Clearly Manley and Rebholz are
right: Something must be done to
rectify the Hoover-Stanford rela
tionship. The University's reputa
tion will suffer without immediate
action.
But the means for reconciliation
need to be examined. Lately Man
ley and Rebholz have favored
bringing Hoover under "normal ac
ademic governance," rather than
splitting from the institution.

Normal academic governance
means that the Trustees would
have final approval over appoint
ments and Hoover would function
as a department within the Uni
versity, subject to constraints on
partisan activity.
However, it is unclear how
"severing ties" — the second al
ternative — could be accomplished.
Hoover's library, scholars and
buildings — of course the tower
— are inextricably bound to the
campus and the University's
image. Manley claims that the "po
litical arm" of Hoover can be iso
lated from the institution's re
sources, but that is impossible. As
long as the political arm remains
on campus, it will be high-profile
and coordinated with the re
sources.
Normal academic governance,
then, is the best answer. But it
must happen gradually, without
bitterness and without inflam
matory statements from liberal
professors. Hoover fellows, many
of whom are world-class scholars,
should have every opportunity to
stay here and contribute to the
University.
First, the mission's reference to
Marxism should be eliminated.
Second, Hoover fellows should
be brought in to teach undergrad
uates. Some teach now, but not
enough.
Third, chairs should be estab
lished for important senior fellows,
to give them credibility in the Uni
versity.
Next, Hoover's voluminous ar
chives should be fully integrated
into the University Libraries Sys
tem and access to them should be
made easier for all.
Only then, should the Trustees
step in and assume oversight of
the Institution.
Hoover must become non
partisan, without being emasc
ulated.
