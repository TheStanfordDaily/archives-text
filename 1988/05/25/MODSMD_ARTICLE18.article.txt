## Say bye-bye to slander 
### 
THIS IS MY final column, which
should come as welcome news to
a great many of you. There'll be
no more right-wing political diatribes, no
more obnoxious slanders and no more
geeky photos of me waving.
Here, then, some final tidbits:
• Is anyone else sick of the bogus polls
showing Mike Dukakis beating George
Bush in November?
I can't wait for the inevitable Presi
dential debates, where people will finally
see my "esteemed" governor for what he
really is — an inexperienced, stubborn,
naive dove whose economic policies would
make Jimmy Carter's double-digit infla
tion, interest and unemployment rates
seem rosy by comparison. Can you say
49 states? Bush can, and will.
• Have you ever taken a good, long
look at the quarterly catalogue for Inno
vative Academic Courses? The title may
as well be "Liberal Garbage: How to
Protest and Study Left-Wing Social
Causes for Credit."
I mean, how many different classes on
"The Central American Struggle" (read:
Communism is cool) can be taught? Al
most without exception, these courses
seem thoroughly ideological, unbalanced
and, in two words, deadly dull. How about
some opposing views, folks? (And they
talk about Hoover!)
• Let's get all of the TAs from Fresh
man English and Western Culture, sit
them down at the Coffee House (where
they all seem to hang out anyway) and
finally put an end to the tremendous
disparity of grade curves between sec

tions.
Good God, within some sections
(within the same class) an A is tougher
to get than an ASSU fee refund, while
in another section As and Bs are handed
out as freely as "Poison Oak" leaflets at
Cowell.
• Also in Western Culture, let's stop
pretending the course is about history
and finally call a spade a spade — it's a
reading course! And since it's a reading
course, why are the lectures always so
disjointed and irrelevant to the books?
Every track should emulate Conflict
and Cake, er, Change, with two sections
and (possibly) one lecture a week. If there
is a lecture, it should deal with the week's
author. By trying to be too much to too
many, Western Culture now fails
miserably across the board.
• This campus needs more speakers.
I'm not pointing any fingers, but rather
I'm saying that every student group
should persevere and get some news
makers to come to Stanford. Believe me,
they want to have an audience at Stan
ford as much as we want to hear them!
• It's good to see that Returning
Residency is gone. I thought we were in
trouble when the "open forum" on the
subject was in the Storey House lounge
a few weeks back. Talk about a "home
field advantage" for keeping the system
unchanged!
Still, though, I think my column's pro
posal of four weeks ago is the most fair:
Have two pools for guaranteed students,
one with the numbers 1 to 1,500 and
one with the numbers 1,501 to 3,000.

You pick which pool you'll choose from,
and you choose from the other pool the
next guaranteed time around.
• Can we finally stop the "We're not
as intellectual as the Ivies" self
flagellation, which is (a) boring and (b)
just plain wrong. My friends at Harvard
and Yale seldom even go to classes and
I remember seeing a Harvard Crimson
front-page headline over Christmas break
that said "Students, Professors Satisfied
with Anti-IntellectuaJism of Houses."
Those pseudo-intellectuals may discuss
T.S. Eliot superficially over Espresso, but
who's kidding whom? We're praised
nationwide for our "intellectual" houses
and our dorm programming, but we seem
to be the only ones who don't know it.
• We also need fewer groups with con
fusing acronyms. I mean, what is SCIRE?
How about AASA? And then there's
SCAAN, to make things even worse. I've
got a new one: It's called Parents Against
the Development of Acronyms and
Palindromes — PADAP.
• One final quote, for all you obnoxious
lowans: You'll get no farm aid and like it!
