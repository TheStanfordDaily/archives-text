## Hawai'i Club members protest pig/fish charges 
### 
SINCE MARY POXON, co-manager
of Stanford Recycling, attempted
in her May 18 letter "to relate an
incident which exemplifies many stu
dents' lack of awareness regading
recycling," we believe that it is neces
sary to relate an incident regarding
Poxon's lack of awareness of the ac
tions of the Stanford Hawai'i Club.
In her letter, she accuses the
Hawai'i Club of disposing of "the
entire head of a pig": and "an entire
raw fish" in the cardboard recycling
dumpsters in the Cowell Cluster.
She states that she found these
articles as she loaded cardboard into
the baler. So she finds a pig's head
and a fish among cardboard boxes and
assumes not only that they came from
the Cowell Cluster but also that they

were leftovers form the Hawai'i Club
Luau on May 7. That's an honest
mistake, Mary.
But Poxon's public accusation of the
Hawai'i Club is not so forgiveable. We
would suggest that Poxon confirm her
accusations before displaying her ignor
ance in public. Had she only contacted
any officer of the Stanford Hawai'i
Club, including Maile Loo, whose
number is listed with the Hawai'i Club
in the Stanford Student Directory and
at Student Organizational Services, she
would have been told the following:
• All of the fish that was used at
the Hawai'i Club Luau was shipped,
shredded and frozen. As one might
expect, our shredded meat did not
include "the entire head of a pig."
• All of the fish that was used at

the Hawai'i Club Luau arrived in the
form of boneless filets. We confirm
that the "entire raw fish" which Poxon
spotted was not a product of the club's
luau.
Since recycling dumpsters are found
throughout the entire Stanford
campus, it would be interesting to see
why Poxon incorrectly singled out the
Stanford Hawai'i Club. Certainly, we
are not the only Stanford organization
that sponsors a luau (although ours is
the only authentic one), nor are we
the only organization that serves fish.
Moreover, we are disheartened that
Poxon implied that Hawi'i Club mem
bers "can't read" and that club mem
bers are not conscientious about recy
cling. In fact, we can confirm that our
members were careful to place nearly

all of the cardboard boxes left over
from the luau in the cardboard recy
cling bin outside of Whitman and that
the garbage problem was taken care of
within two days.
Again, we are not sure how Poxon
arrived at her conclusions, but we
strongly believe that they are unsub
stantiated and are certain that they
are false.
The Stanford Hawai'i Club believes,
as Poxon does, that recycling is a
worthy cause. We do not believe, how
ever, that false public accusations will
further this cause.
