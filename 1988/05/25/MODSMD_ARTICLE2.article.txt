# Night vigil causes racial scare
## 
### Bob Michitarian Glen Tripp Senior staff writers 
Unintentionally evoking the
image of the Ku Klux Klan early
yesterday morning, seven stu
dents — wearing masks in a silent
candlelight vigil — protested the
"unfair" eviction of freshman
Kenny Ehrman from Otero last
week.
The seven refused to identify
themselves throughout the pro
test, but they were identified yes
terday as members of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity.
They are: sophomore Kirk Fer
guson, junior Dave Filgaa, senior
Scott Lindus, senior Dave Look,
senior John Naporano, senior
John Romero and junior Tim Wal
ter. All spoke to The Daily yes
terday except Lindus and Walter,
who were unavailable.
Their midnight vigil protested
what they called the University's
"overreaction" in the eviction last
Friday of Ehrman for insulting
his resident fellow and vandaliz
ing the dorm lounge May 15. Uni
versity officials said Ehrman's
eviction was also the result of his
sexist and homophobic actions.
Speaking in whispers at the
protest, Lindus said the group in
tended a "non-violent message"
in support of Ehrman's right to
free speech.
The message, however, was per
ceived as one of racism. The
protest mimicked several methods
historically used by the KKK:

wearing masks, maintaining
anonymity and arriving late at
night with fire.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said last night: "At the
very least, they did not under
stand the history of violence
against people of color. And while
the candle is a symbol of protest,
[fire] is associated with the reign
of terror against minorities in this
country."
Pisano said the protesters
"demonstrated group responsibil
ity" when they came on their own
to his office yesterday to discuss
the issue. But he said their actions
are "very serious" and expressed
frustration about how to respond,
saying, "What was going through
these men's minds that they
didn't understand what they were
doing?"
The protesters admitted yester
day that they were "ignorant" of
the historical connotations of
their methods. "We understand
that it came off as really poor,"
Look said. "None of us realized
that it would evoke such a reac
tion."
The protesters said they wore
masks because they did not want
to be associated with their frater
nity and they did not want to be
connected to Ehrman.
Phi Delt President Russ
Pangborn, a junior, said last night
that the protest "was not a house
doing. They used poor judgment."

Masked members of Phi Delta Theta hold a candlelight vigil at Otero between about 12:15 a.m. and
1:15 a.m. yesterday to protest the suspension of freshman Kenny Ehrman from University housing.
About 60 onlookers massed at the protest. Wearing a hockey mask at upper right is Scott Lindus,

the students after hearing reac
tions from Otero, the BSU and
the University.
The seven arrived at Otero at
about 12:15 a.m. yesterday, just
after a tense two-and-a-half-hour
house meeting called to discuss
Ehrman's eviction.
Ehrman was at the meeting but
left before the protesters arrived,
residents said. Ehrman said last
night he was not connected to the
protest and did not know those
involved.
Shortly after the house meeting
broke up, Otero residents cried,
"Oh, my God" and "What's going
on" as they noticed the masked
protesters standing outside the
glass doors at the dorm's east en
trance.

Residents crowded into the en
trance way. At that point, none
went outside.
At least two callers reached
police, fearful that the protest
might be a KKK-like racial as
sault, Sgt. Chris Lefferts said.
Two officers were sent to the
scene but left almost immediately
because the protesters had vio
lated no laws.
Shortly afterward, about 10
students, mostly minorities, ar
rived inside Otero. Former BSU
Chair Amanda Kemp, a senior,
had been contacted when the pro
testers arrived, and brought
friends and dormmates with her
to witness the protest.
Soon, about 20 more students
gathered and the crowd moved
outside.
As the crowd grew to about 60
students, some taunted the pro
testers, calling them "racists" and
asking "Where are the marshmal

lows?" in reference to the protest
ers' candles.
BSU Vice Chair Cheryl Taylor
called University President
Donald Kennedy to inform him
of the protest. Taylor relayed a
message from Kennedy just before
1 a.m. that the crowd should leave
the protest.
But students jeered Kennedy's
request, and tension increased as
the crowd challenged the protest
ers to remove their masks.
The confrontation nearly be
came violent when one student
yelled, "Let's take off their
masks," but the threat ceased
when another shouted, "No! If
they don't have the guts to take
them off themselves, let's not give
them the guts."
Steve Phillips, a former chair
of the BSU who observed the
protest, tried to explain why it
was perceived as racist. "By
wearing those masks they are

really evoking the image of the
KKK. . . . They are parading
around here in junior Klan outfits
and (therefore) they are embrac
ing that entire legacy."
Soon after, at about 1:15 a.m.,
the protesters stood up and left.
Most Otero residents stayed be
hind, but about half the crowd,
mostly black students, followed.
"We felt very threatened," Look
said later. But most observers
were calm, and tried to discuss
the event with the protesters.
As they crossed Wilbur Field,
some of the protesters removed
their masks but did not name
themselves.
And, in fact, at about 2 a.m.
several students convinced
Naporano and Romero of the im
portance of their actions, and the
two made public, albeit anony
mous, apologies to the Stanford
community because their protest
had racist overtones.

Their midnight vigil protested
what they called the University's
"overreaction" in the eviction last
Friday of Ehrman for insulting
his resident fellow and vandaliz

eviction was also the result of his
sexist and homophobic actions.
Speaking in whispers at the
protest, Lindus said the group in
tended a "non-violent message"
in support of Ehrman's right to
free speech.
The message, however, was per

protest mimicked several methods
historically used by the KKK:

wearing masks, maintaining
anonymity and arriving late at
night with fire.

country."
Pisano said the protesters
"demonstrated group responsibil

the issue. But he said their actions
are "very serious" and expressed
frustration about how to respond,

didn't understand what they were
doing?"
The protesters admitted yester
day that they were "ignorant" of
the historical connotations of
their methods. "We understand
that it came off as really poor,"
Look said. "None of us realized

The protesters said they wore
masks because they did not want
to be associated with their frater

connected to Ehrman.

Masked members of Phi Delta Theta hold a candlelight vigil at Otero between about 12:15 a.m. and
1:15 a.m. yesterday to protest the suspension of freshman Kenny Ehrman from University housing.
About 60 onlookers massed at the protest. Wearing a hockey mask at upper right is Scott Lindus,
at lower right is Dave Filgas.


the students after hearing reac
tions from Otero, the BSU and
the University.
The seven arrived at Otero at
about 12:15 a.m. yesterday, just
after a tense two-and-a-half-hour
house meeting called to discuss
Ehrman's eviction.
Ehrman was at the meeting but
left before the protesters arrived,
residents said. Ehrman said last
night he was not connected to the
protest and did not know those
involved.
Shortly after the house meeting
broke up, Otero residents cried,
"Oh, my God" and "What's going
on" as they noticed the masked
protesters standing outside the
glass doors at the dorm's east en
trance.

Residents crowded into the en
trance way. At that point, none
went outside.
At least two callers reached
police, fearful that the protest
might be a KKK-like racial as
sault, Sgt. Chris Lefferts said.
Two officers were sent to the
scene but left almost immediately
because the protesters had vio
lated no laws.
Shortly afterward, about 10
students, mostly minorities, ar
rived inside Otero. Former BSU
Chair Amanda Kemp, a senior,
had been contacted when the pro
testers arrived, and brought
friends and dormmates with her
to witness the protest.
Soon, about 20 more students
gathered and the crowd moved
outside.
As the crowd grew to about 60
students, some taunted the pro
testers, calling them "racists" and
asking "Where are the marshmal

lows?" in reference to the protest
ers' candles.
BSU Vice Chair Cheryl Taylor
called University President
Donald Kennedy to inform him
of the protest. Taylor relayed a
message from Kennedy just before
1 a.m. that the crowd should leave
the protest.
But students jeered Kennedy's
request, and tension increased as
the crowd challenged the protest
ers to remove their masks.
The confrontation nearly be
came violent when one student
yelled, "Let's take off their
masks," but the threat ceased
when another shouted, "No! If
they don't have the guts to take
them off themselves, let's not give
them the guts."
Steve Phillips, a former chair
of the BSU who observed the
protest, tried to explain why it
was perceived as racist. "By
wearing those masks they are

really evoking the image of the
KKK. . . . They are parading
around here in junior Klan outfits
and (therefore) they are embrac
ing that entire legacy."
Soon after, at about 1:15 a.m.,
the protesters stood up and left.
Most Otero residents stayed be
hind, but about half the crowd,
mostly black students, followed.
"We felt very threatened," Look
said later. But most observers
were calm, and tried to discuss
the event with the protesters.
As they crossed Wilbur Field,
some of the protesters removed
their masks but did not name
themselves.
And, in fact, at about 2 a.m.
several students convinced
Naporano and Romero of the im
portance of their actions, and the
two made public, albeit anony
mous, apologies to the Stanford
community because their protest
had racist overtones.
Unintentionally evoking the
image of the Ku Klux Klan early
yesterday morning, seven stu
dents — wearing masks in a silent
candlelight vigil — protested the
"unfair" eviction of freshman
Kenny Ehrman from Otero last
week.
The seven refused to identify
themselves throughout the pro
test, but they were identified yes
terday as members of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity.
They are: sophomore Kirk Fer
guson, junior Dave Filgaa, senior
Scott Lindus, senior Dave Look,
senior John Naporano, senior
John Romero and junior Tim Wal
ter. All spoke to The Daily yes
terday except Lindus and Walter,
who were unavailable.
