# Night vigil causes racial scare
## 
### Bob Michitarian Glen Tripp Senior staff writers 
Unintentionally evoking the
image of the Ku Klux Klan early
yesterday morning, seven stu
dents — wearing masks in a silent
candlelight vigil — protested the
"unfair" eviction of freshman
Kenny Ehrman from Otero last
week.
The seven refused to identify
themselves throughout the pro
test, but they were identified yes
terday as members of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity.
They are: sophomore Kirk Fer
guson, junior Dave Filgaa, senior
Scott Lindus, senior Dave Look,
senior John Naporano, senior
John Romero and junior Tim Wal
ter. All spoke to The Daily yes
terday except Lindus and Walter,
who were unavailable.
Their midnight vigil protested
what they called the University's
"overreaction" in the eviction last
Friday of Ehrman for insulting
his resident fellow and vandaliz
ing the dorm lounge May 15. Uni
versity officials said Ehrman's
eviction was also the result of his
sexist and homophobic actions.
Speaking in whispers at the
protest, Lindus said the group in
tended a "non-violent message"
in support of Ehrman's right to
free speech.
The message, however, was per
ceived as one of racism. The
protest mimicked several methods
historically used by the KKK:

wearing masks, maintaining
anonymity and arriving late at
night with fire.
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano said last night: "At the
very least, they did not under
stand the history of violence
against people of color. And while
the candle is a symbol of protest,
[fire] is associated with the reign
of terror against minorities in this
country."
Pisano said the protesters
"demonstrated group responsibil
ity" when they came on their own
to his office yesterday to discuss
the issue. But he said their actions
are "very serious" and expressed
frustration about how to respond,
saying, "What was going through
these men's minds that they
didn't understand what they were
doing?"
The protesters admitted yester
day that they were "ignorant" of
the historical connotations of
their methods. "We understand
that it came off as really poor,"
Look said. "None of us realized
that it would evoke such a reac
tion."
The protesters said they wore
masks because they did not want
to be associated with their frater
nity and they did not want to be
connected to Ehrman.
Phi Delt President Russ
Pangborn, a junior, said last night
that the protest "was not a house
doing. They used poor judgment."
He said the house will discipline
