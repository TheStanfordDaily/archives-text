# Make negotiations accountable to all
## 
### 
Negotiations between United Stan
ford Workers and the Administration
are rapidly approaching. The Union
contract covering 1,300 workers expires
August 31.
The outcome of these negotiations
will affect the entire Stanford commu
nity. For this reason, we believe that
both the Union and the Administration
have an obligation to be honest with,
and accountable to, the community.
Previous negotiations have been
closed. We believe that the University
Legal Office, which negotiates the con
tract for the Administration, has been
neither honest nor accountable to the
community in the past; however, we
feel there is a way to ensure honesty
and accountability in the future. We
would like to open up negotiations to
community observers.

First, let's look at the issue of
honesty. During the '85 negotiations,
for example, we in the union reported
that the Legal Office's negotiator, Pris
cilla Wheeler, had proposed contract
language changes that would remove
our job security.
Wheeler simply denied this. Since
negotiations were closed, some in the
community were left confused and
couldn't tell who was telling the truth.
By opening negotiations, community
members can judge the truth for them
selves.
Second, let's look at the issue of
accountability. In the past, Wheeler
has gutted health and safety, reduced
affirmative action language and has
tried to reduce job security and union
security.
We believe that those attacks,
carried out in closed negotiations,
would have been unacceptable to the
Stanford community. We believe that
the Legal Office's hard-line tactics
belong in the 19th century and that
the community would have recognised

just how destructive they were.
For example, Wheeler's recent hard
line stand against nurses who needed
relief from workload pressures, was
destructive to the nurses and their
families, to the community and to
health care.
With open negotiations, the Legal
Office will find it difficult to operate in
such a destructive manner.
Now, what do we mean by "open
negotiations"? Are we suggesting a
Roman Circus? Of course not. We are
proposing that various campus organi
zations and constituencies can send
silent observers.
These observers could be limited in
number. If the Administration has
nothing to hide, it should welcome this
proposal.
Finally, we feel that open and honest
negotiations will benefit everyone. In
fact, we would like to see labor rela
tions in general taken out oF the
closet, where it has been put by the
Administration and brought into the
light of day.

Our hope is that this exposure will
cause the Legal Office to develop a
more enlightened labor relations ap
proach, one more in tune with the
community's outlook, and one more in
line with the 20th century.
