# Fiscal Fidelity
## Summer heats up with sound financial investments 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Attention shoppers: the blue light
is on and the bargains are boundless.
Finally, after a three-month dearth
of quality, the record company gurus
have decided to start up summer with
a bang by releasing some really good
stuff.
In this light, we at Fiscal Fidelity
have decided to give you, the reading
and listening public, two bonus extras
— that's right, not one but two. So
hang on, folks, and prepare to raid
the aisles at Tower Records, once again
our store of reference.
May Picks
• Michelle Shocked, "The Texas
Campfire Tapes" ($6.99, LP/Cassette)
— Recently reviewed in The Daily,
this may be an unexpected avenue to
success for the young folk-blues singer.
Recorded entirely on a Sony Walkman
in front of a campfire at a Texas folk
festival, the album showcases
Shocked's witty song writing, vocal
style and lively guitar. It is available
on compact disc as well. But why waste
the dough for the higher fidelity when
all you'll hear clearer are the crickets?
• Peter Murphy, "Love Hysteria"
($14.99, CD) — It appears that Peter
Murphy may finally crawl out from
underground. Previously acclaimed for
its contributions to the cult band
Bauhaus, Murphy has recorded a solo
album with material that does justice
to his amazingly rich voice.
Another big plus is that the first
single released, "All Night Long," is
not the records apogee. "Indigo Eyes"

(which will probably be the second
single) is an upbeat and addictive song,
and "Dragnet Drag" comes really close
to audio nirvana. With the richness
and the range, it's a disc worth grab
bing.
• Sinead O'Connor, "I Want Your
(Hands On Me)" ($3.99, 12" Single)
— Yes, my favorite bald Irishwoman
is back. This is the second single off
of her highly-acclaimed debut album
"The Lion and the Cobra," which has
to be the surprise success story of the
year. Featuring three versions of
"Hands," plus the LP's finale "Just
Call Me Joe," this 12-incher will be
welcome in almost anyone's home.
Bonus #1: Gritty Guitar
I recently spent the early hours of
a morning in the room of my next
door neighbor, Will Stocker, with
electric guitar afficionado Paul Duffy,
a man that knows more about the
instrument than I know about myself.
After receiving a thorough audio
tutorial, I recommend the following
recent releases:
• Joe Satriani, "Surfing With The
Alien" ($12.99, CD) — Quite simply,
the man can play. Though sitting
through the whole album may be a
little tough, guitar lovers will readily
relish the style, speed and sheer ex
pressiveness that Satriani, teacher to
such musicians as David Lee Roth's
guitarist Steve Val, draws out of the
half-dozen strings.
• Scorpions, "Savage Amusement"
($14.99 CD) — As an album in general
it leaves much to be desired — the
spiffy production has removed most
of the raw edge that makes Scorpions

music powerful. However, for the
guitar connoisseur, a gem lies within
the rough, as Rudy Schenker's leads
command notice. If Duffy, a man who
has heard many solos in his lifetime,
drops his mouth after several of the
licks, the record must be something
special.

An "Expert" Opinion
As the final bonus, Fiscal Fidelity
opens up the page to a real expert .. .
well, sort of. Manning the counter in
Tower's cassette department clad in
dark clothing and a Chairman Mao
cap, Scott Kuiper comes into contact
with everything that's hip. So, for an
other perspective, here are his selec
tions:
• The Cure, "Faith/Carnage Vi
sions" ($8.44, Cassette) — In the ap
proximate words of Kuiper, "Carnage
Vision" is about 30 minutes of good
instrumentals that make a fine flipside
to "Faith," which he terms "a pretty
good album." Besides, it's a two-on-one
tape, giving you twice the music for
the moolah.

• Skinny Puppy, "Mind the Per
petual Intercourse" ($8.44, Cassette)
— As should now be readily apparent,
Kuiper's musical selections won't lull
the listener to sleep. This choice is no
exception. In the brief portion he
played for me, raucous rock lept off
of the tracks and attempted to strangle
everyone in the vicinity of the stereo.
Good stuff, Maynard!
• The soundtrack to "The Serpent
and the Rainbow" ($9.44, Cassette)
— Believe it or not, people are buying
this album as if they were hypnotically
commanded to. Though he didn't tell
me exactly what is on it, based on the
commercials I saw on television for
the flick, I have a strong hunch that
this is not the album to play when
the grandparents come to visit.
As an aside, Kuiper recommended
his most recent purchase, a two-CD
collection of the best by Bauhaus. With
any valuable and large book included,
it makes a nice collector's item for
anyone who is willing to drop $85.99
on it. Hurry — there's only one left!

his most recent purchase, a two-CD
collection of the best by Bauhaus. With
any valuable and large book included,
it makes a nice collector's item for
anyone who is willing to drop $85.99
on it. Hurry — there's only one left!

Attention shoppers: the blue light
is on and the bargains are boundless.
Finally, after a three-month dearth
of quality, the record company gurus
have decided to start up summer with
a bang by releasing some really good
stuff.
In this light, we at Fiscal Fidelity
have decided to give you, the reading
and listening public, two bonus extras
— that's right, not one but two. So
hang on, folks, and prepare to raid
the aisles at Tower Records, once again
our store of reference.
May Picks
• Michelle Shocked, "The Texas
Campfire Tapes" ($6.99, LP/Cassette)
— Recently reviewed in The Daily,
this may be an unexpected avenue to
success for the young folk-blues singer.
Recorded entirely on a Sony Walkman
in front of a campfire at a Texas folk
festival, the album showcases
Shocked's witty song writing, vocal
style and lively guitar. It is available
on compact disc as well. But why waste
the dough for the higher fidelity when
all you'll hear clearer are the crickets?
• Peter Murphy, "Love Hysteria"
($14.99, CD) — It appears that Peter
Murphy may finally crawl out from
underground. Previously acclaimed for
its contributions to the cult band
Bauhaus, Murphy has recorded a solo
album with material that does justice
to his amazingly rich voice.
Another big plus is that the first
single released, "All Night Long," is
not the records apogee. "Indigo Eyes"

(which will probably be the second
single) is an upbeat and addictive song,
and "Dragnet Drag" comes really close
to audio nirvana. With the richness
and the range, it's a disc worth grab
bing.
• Sinead O'Connor, "I Want Your
(Hands On Me)" ($3.99, 12" Single)
— Yes, my favorite bald Irishwoman
is back. This is the second single off
of her highly-acclaimed debut album
"The Lion and the Cobra," which has
to be the surprise success story of the
year. Featuring three versions of
"Hands," plus the LP's finale "Just
Call Me Joe," this 12-incher will be
welcome in almost anyone's home.
Bonus #1: Gritty Guitar
I recently spent the early hours of
a morning in the room of my next
door neighbor, Will Stocker, with
electric guitar afficionado Paul Duffy,
a man that knows more about the
instrument than I know about myself.
After receiving a thorough audio
tutorial, I recommend the following
recent releases:
• Joe Satriani, "Surfing With The
Alien" ($12.99, CD) — Quite simply,
the man can play. Though sitting
through the whole album may be a
little tough, guitar lovers will readily
relish the style, speed and sheer ex
pressiveness that Satriani, teacher to
such musicians as David Lee Roth's
guitarist Steve Val, draws out of the
half-dozen strings.
• Scorpions, "Savage Amusement"
($14.99 CD) — As an album in general
it leaves much to be desired — the
spiffy production has removed most
of the raw edge that makes Scorpions

music powerful. However, for the
guitar connoisseur, a gem lies within
the rough, as Rudy Schenker's leads
command notice. If Duffy, a man who
has heard many solos in his lifetime,
drops his mouth after several of the
licks, the record must be something
special.

An "Expert" Opinion
As the final bonus, Fiscal Fidelity
opens up the page to a real expert .. .
well, sort of. Manning the counter in
Tower's cassette department clad in
dark clothing and a Chairman Mao
cap, Scott Kuiper comes into contact
with everything that's hip. So, for an
other perspective, here are his selec
tions:
• The Cure, "Faith/Carnage Vi
sions" ($8.44, Cassette) — In the ap
proximate words of Kuiper, "Carnage
Vision" is about 30 minutes of good
instrumentals that make a fine flipside
to "Faith," which he terms "a pretty
good album." Besides, it's a two-on-one
tape, giving you twice the music for
the moolah.

• Skinny Puppy, "Mind the Per
petual Intercourse" ($8.44, Cassette)
— As should now be readily apparent,
Kuiper's musical selections won't lull
the listener to sleep. This choice is no
exception. In the brief portion he
played for me, raucous rock lept off
of the tracks and attempted to strangle
everyone in the vicinity of the stereo.
Good stuff, Maynard!
• The soundtrack to "The Serpent
and the Rainbow" ($9.44, Cassette)
— Believe it or not, people are buying
this album as if they were hypnotically
commanded to. Though he didn't tell
me exactly what is on it, based on the
commercials I saw on television for
the flick, I have a strong hunch that
this is not the album to play when
the grandparents come to visit.
As an aside, Kuiper recommended
his most recent purchase, a two-CD
collection of the best by Bauhaus. With
any valuable and large book included,
it makes a nice collector's item for
anyone who is willing to drop $85.99
on it. Hurry — there's only one left!
