# Stage Review
## Good perfomances highlight Taper Angels' 
### James Lujan Editorial staff 
The plight of Chinese immi
grants placed in the Angel Island
Immigration Center while waiting
to come to the United States is
dramatized in "Paper Angels," a
play presented by the Asian Amer
ican Theater Association and the
Residential Arts Program.
Angel Island, a prison-like
detention center, was where hope
ful Chinese immigrants were kept
between 1910 and 1940. While at
the center, they endured intensive
interrogations and medical tests
before either entering the United
States or being deported. This is
the play's setting, and the story
begins as a new group of immi
grants comes to Angel Island.
The men and women in the
group are immediately parted,
housed in separate barracks and
not allowed to see each other. The
separation sets the stage for the
rest of the play which switches
back and forth from the men to
the women where we witness how
both groups deal with the frus
tration, anger and fear of being
bottled up in the penitentiary-like
environment.
The main strength of the play

comes from the young Asian ac
tors who play the immigrants. Di
rector Jim Cadena has done a fine
job of taking several Stanford stu
dents, most of whom have had no
acting experience, and encourag
ing them to bring something from
within themselves out into their
roles, all of which gives the play
an authentic intensity.
The fact that Cadena was work
ing with a double-cast makes his
accomplishment even more im
pressive. On the night I was there,
cast members Ken Chan, Joe
Chee, Paul Gager, Alvin Lee,
Laura Chi, Helen Park and Anne
Chang did a particularly good job
of bringing their characters to life.
The play is most interesting
when it shows us the interaction
of these characters as they try to
keep from going crazy, but too
often playwright Genny Lim tries
to make her script seem more po
etic and "theater-like" by saddling
her characters with overlong
soliloquies.
This device only seems to
detract from the bitter, realistic
message that Lim is trying to
state and makes the play longer
than it needs to be. The feelings
brought out by her characters in
these speeches could have been

more dramatic, rather than con
trived, if expressed through inter
action with other characters.
She also bogs the play down
with too many scenes with racist
guards and uncaring bureaucrats.
Sure, there was racism, which
basically was the reason for Angel
Island, but the statement against
racism would have been more ef
fective if she had made those char
acters less cartoon-like and

cliched.
Despite these shortcomings,
"Paper Angels" is well worth
seeing for the good performances
and for a look at a chapter in
history â€” a chapter unfamiliar to
most.

"Paper Angels " will be performed
today through Saturday at 8 p.m.
in Elliot Program Center.
