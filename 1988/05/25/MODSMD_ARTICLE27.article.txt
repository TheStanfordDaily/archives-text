# Album Review
## Circus up in 'Smoke' 
### Bernardo Silva 
Breaking Circus — "Smoker's
Paradise"
This Mineapolis band has
been a regular on college turn
tables since "The Very Long
Fuse" EP — meaning the
average Stanford student has
probably never heard of them.
Harsh reality aside, Breaking
Circus' follow-up to last year's
dense and disturbing "The Ice
Machine" LP features the same
lean and mean production and
the patented bass/drum
whirlwind that has defined
their sound for the past four
years.
As its cover art — a snow
white hammer with the busi
ness end aimed straight at the
viewer's temple — suggests,
the six songs on this EP are
an all out assault on the frontal
lobe. The title cut opens the
record with a simple bass and
drum track with a little synth
riff. Moist and meaty guitars
eventually join in, earning the

song a spot on the soundtrack
for Armageddon.
The song "Emperor Calvin"
melds the power-chording of
the Who with the power
machinery of Big Black (I just
had to mention them), and
anyone who questions the
musicality of such "alterna
tive" groups should listen to
the machine-gun-like bass line
and sizzling drum fills on "Eat
Lead."
As for the vocals, be warned:
Steve Bjorklund's croak of a
voice can at one point lull the
listener into a subdued state,
then unexpectedly change into
a screaming thrash, lurching
at the listener's ears. Choose
your poison.
It has been said that the soul
is not fed by happiness alone;
it needs pain and discomfort
to maintain a happy, balanced
diet. In this sense, Breaking
Circus is the food of cham
pions. Wait. One more literary
image: these dudes can chew
razorblades better than anyone
- 'cept maby Big Black.
