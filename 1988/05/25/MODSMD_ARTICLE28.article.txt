# Carey returns home
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
The Stanford baseball team's trip this
week to New Britain, Conn., for NCAA
regional play is a journey into the past
for Cardinal sophomore rightfielder Paul
Carey.
About 120 miles to the northeast of
New Britain is Weymouth, Mass., where
Carey grew up and made a name for
himself as a baseball and hockey star
at Boston College High School.
About 250 miles to the northwest of
New Britain is Cooperstown, N.Y., home
of the National Baseball Hall of Fame,
where Carey's 1987 Stanford jersey is
on display — a symbol of his glorious
and heroic freshman year on the Farm.
Last year was an altogether amazing
one for Carey, as he moved out of the
nest of his hometown into the hot light
of national exposure and collegiate star
dom.
Admittedly homesick at the beginning
of his freshman year, Carey caught fire
when baseball season rolled around in
late winter. He batted .353 for the year
and swatted 12 home runs with 62 RBI.
The last of those home runs came in
a College World Series game against
LSU on June 5. With the Cardinal
peering hard into the abyss of elimina
tion — having lost the day before and
now trailing 5-2 in the bottom of the
10th inning against the Tigers — Carey
hit a grand-slam home run to win the
game and propel Stanford to the na
tional championship.
Carey was named the Most Outstand
ing Player of both the West I Regional
and the College World Series, and was
also Baseball America's Freshman of the
Year.
Having set such a standard for him
self, Carey entered this season carrying
a heavy burden of great expectations.
Early on, he stumbled under the
weight.
"I had a lot of expectations on myself
personally, the team had a lot of expec
tations for me, and the coaches and even
the fans did, too," Carey said. "The fans
were expecting a lot from me — if I
didn't get a home run or a base hit here
or there or every time up, they were
going to say 'What's wrong with Paul?'
and I could hear it.. .
On April 5 — 34 games into the 1988
season — Carey was batting .267 with
no home runs and 14 RBI. On May 16,
at the completion of the Cardinal's 58-
game regular-season schedule, Carey
was batting .337 with 11 home runs
and 51 RBI. He batted well over .400
the last 24 games of the season.
"I feel like two different people,"
Carey said. "I struggled and batted .250
the first half of the season, and I've
been hitting .450 in the second half."
There are any number of explanations
for Carey's sudden turnaround:
• he got a new haircut;
• he was benched for the first time in
his Stanford career;
• he made yet another adjustment in
his batting stance.

"Something just clicked," Carey said.
"It could have "been the haircut, just a
different attitude, it could have been
moving my hands (in my batting stance).
But I think it was mental, it was a fresh
new beginning. ... I got a couple base
hits, I got my confidence back a little
bit, and then everything just fell into
place for me."
The turning point seemed to come on
April 5, when Carey hit his first home
run of the year in a 20-5 romp over
Santa Clara. Two things were different
about that game: Carey didn't start, and
his hair was a lot shorter than usual.
To preface the haircut story for those
who may be unfamiliar with it, after 24
games of the season, Carey hadn't hit
a home run. Carey made a bet with one
of his teammates, sophomore pitcher
Mark Carper: If Carey didn't get a home
run in the next 10 games, he would get
a buzz cut like the one Carper has.
Ten games later, Carey still hadn't
homered, so on the morning of April 5,
he got the haircut. That afternoon, he
got his first home run.
In addition, that April 5 game was
only the second time this season that
Carey hadn't started in right field. The
day before, for a game against St.
Mary's, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
had removed Carey from the lineup in
favor of hot-hitting sophomore Tim Grif
fin.
"I think I started to realize that the
team could win without me, which is
good," Carey said. "Tim Griffin was hit
ting the ball well, so I wasn't upset at
him or the coach that he was there, but
I was upset at myself for letting someone
else get a shot."
Carey was back in the starting lineup
on April 8 for the first game of a series
at Arizona. He went l-for-4 with a
single. The next day Marquess moved
Carey to the eighth place in the batting
order, and Carey responded by going
3-for-3 with four RBI.
Carey shifted into high gear the next
weekend at UCLA. He went 3-for-5 in
the second game of the series, slugging
his second homer of the year and knock
ing in three runs. In the final game of
the series, he hit a three-run home run
in the top of the 12th inning to power
the Cardinal to a 5-2 win.
In essentially half a season, Carey has
nearly equalled the remarkable numbers
he put up last year.
Carey isn't surprised by that. "I feel
a lot better than I did last year," he
said. "Last year I didn't know what to
expect — I had never seen the pitching,
I didn't know what to expect in the
regionals, and I didn't know what I'd
see in the World Series. We were going
up against the best, and I didn't know
what the best was — I had always seen
it on TV, and I didn't know what it was."
