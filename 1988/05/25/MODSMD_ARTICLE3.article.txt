### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
In response to yesterday's
early morning vigil in sup
port of Otero freshman
Kenny Ehrman. both Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy and Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons
yesterday defended
Ehrman's suspension from
University housing because
of his sexist and homophobic
actions.
In an official statement,
Kennedy said he wanted to
"emphasize that residential
communities here are built
on mutual respect and con
sideration. We cannot and
wall not tolerate statements
or expressions that demean
or threaten others or that
are racist, sexist and homo
phobic."
Ehrman's case is unusual,
but not unique. According
to Diana Conklin, director
of residential deans, about four
to five students a year have their
housing privileges revoked for dis
ciplinary reasons.
Speaking to students at a pre
viously scheduled appearance at
Branner Hall yesterday, Kennedy
also said the vigil was not neces
sarily a racial incident, but pos
sibly a response only to the Uni
versity's actions.
"Owing to the circumstances
which led up to it, it is natural
for people to interpret that this
candlelight demonstration was ra
cially motivated," Kennedy said,
adding that he had not received
any definite reports about the mo
tivations of the protest at that
time.
In a four-page prepared state

ment, Lyons agreed that it was
unclear whether the incident was
intended to be racial. He added,
however, that "what [was] clear
[was | that it was a very inappro
priate means to make a point and
a protest because it invoked some
of the worst historical fears and
traditions."
Neither Kennedy nor Lyons
thought the University had
abridged Ehrman's First Amend
ment rights by its actions, as
those who held the vigil had main
tained.
The line is drawn "when one
person exercises what they believe
to be their rights and begins to
intrude and override the rights of
others," Lyons said. "One is not
free to harass another student,"
he said. "There is a basic right
at this University to be free from
[harassment]."
