You kinda wish they

such are the breaks.
Senior Kay Cornelius
and freshman Jodi
Figley will represent the
Stanford women's imlf

team this week at the NCAA Champi
onships at New Mexico State in Las
Cruces, NM.
I he Cardinal had hoped to receive
one of three at-large bids to compete
in the team competition, but the NCAA
selection committee gave the final berth
in the 17-team field to Kentucky, a team
that was ranked lower than Stanford.
However, Cornelius and Figley are
both entering the tournament with the

attitude that they can win the individual
championship. Last night both were
chosen Ail-Americans, with Cornelius
making the first team and Figley earn
ing honorable mention.
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin, though
unhappy with the NCAA's choice of
Kentucky, was very pleased with the
performances this year from his two
standout players. "This is the first time
in the history of Stanford women's golf
that we've had two All-Americans in
the same year," he said.
Figley, who came to the Farm last
fall with what Baldwin called "the big
gest slice this side of the Mississippi,"
has developed a draw which has not
only improved her hitting distance but
her accuracy as well.
Cornelius, who played in only eight

tournaments because she caught a viral
flu at the Arizona Intercollegiate, re
corded seven top 10 finishes, including
her first individual championship, won
by defeating Figley in a sudden-death
playoff at the Rainbow Intercollegiate
in Hawaii.
For Figley and Cornelius to have a
shot for the individual title, however
they will have to play their most con
sistent golf of the year. While both have
played well overall in tournaments,
there always seems to be one round or
nine holes during a tournament where
their concentration lapses for a mo
ment. However, according to Baldwin,
"that's what makes the NCAA Cham
pionships the NCAA Championships. To
win against all of the top players in the
country requires four rounds of the best
golf you can play," he said.
