# Lichti survives Olympic cut; reaches final round
## 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Yesterday afternoon, Todd
Lichti returned to Maples Pavil
ion and smiled.
"I felt real comfortable all
week," he said. "I'm right there."
Indeed, earlier on Tuesday
morning in Colorado Springs,
Colo., Lichti's name was right
there on the list of 17 top players
who survived the first round of
tryouts for the U.S. Olympic bas
ketball team.
Lichti and at least 16 other
players will spend six weeks at
Georgetown University this sum
mer with Olympic and George
town Coach John Thompson.
Nine other players and the Navy's
David Robinspn will form the
USA Select and will tour
Europe in June. Approximately
four or five of those nine will then
join the sweet 17 beginning July
10 for the summer sessions in
Georgetown.
At the end of the summer, 12
players will be selected to repre
sent the United States at the
Summer Olympics in Seoul.
Various national media referred
to Lichti as a surprise selection,
but here at Stanford not many
were caught off guard.

"When they were putting up
the names, I wasn't really that
nervous," Lichti said. "I mean I
wasn't confident I'd make it, but
I felt I had played well enough to
be on the list."
"Todd fits right in with that
group," Stanford Coach Mike
Montgomery said. "I'm not sur
prised he made it. I think he
learned from the Pan Am trials

last year that you have to go out
and bust it and take your
chances."
The 6-foot-4 junior off-guard
from Concord stressed his
strengths during the tryouts,
blitzing on offense and gutting it
out under Thompson's full-court
man-to-man defense. Lichti
scored 14 points in the showcase
scrimmage on Sunday, and said
he averaged about 11 or 12 points
in the closed scrimmages.
"I was pretty consistent all
week. I think I was over 50 per
cent from three-point range, and
I hit jumpers pretty consistently
and drove to the bucket well,"
Lichti said yesterday as he was
taping himself up for a Cardinal
scrimmage. "I was being aggres
sive offensively and making things
happen, and I was playing fairly
aggressive defense
The original field of 90-plus
players was pared to 48 on Sat
urday, and then down to the
remaining 26 yesterday. The in
tense week consisted of drills at
six stations for an hour and a
half in the morning and then
some full court play for about a
half hour.
After lunch, the players partic
ipated in games under the scru
tiny of the coaches and hordes of

NBA scouts. The nights were left
free for recuperation.
"Everyone's legs were sore. It
was really intense full-court pres
sure all the time, picking up your
man full court â€” you just had to
suck it up out there," Lichti said.
"Everyone was sucking air. I don't
know if you could have really
prepared for it. I was talking to
some of the trainers and they
were saying the same thing. This
isn't the type of thing you could
really prepare for."
At the tryouts, Lichti played al
most exclusively at off-guard (in
hoops jargon that's the "two" po
sition), where he feels the most
comfortable. And after a short ad
justment period, he began to ap

predate Thompson's go-go style
of basketball.
"It was kind of an open court,
fast-paced game," Lichti said. "I
drove a lot of times and drew
some fouls, and took my share of
outside shots. It's non-stop action,
but once you get used to it you
enjoy it a little more."
Lichti's stifTest competition at
the off-guard spot this summer
will probably come from Bradley's
Hersey Hawkins, lowa State's Jeff
Grayer and maybe Kentucky's
glamour boy Rex Chapman,
among others. Over the six-week
summer sessions, the hit-or-miss
pressure of this past week's
tryouts will give way to long-haul
performance.
According to Cardinal team
mate Howard Wright, who also
participated in the tryouts, the
six-week span should favor Lichti.
"I think Todd is a more com
plete player than guys like Grayer
or Rex Chapman or (Kansas
State's Mitch) Richmond, and I
think and hope that over the sum
mer the coaches will see how
diversified his talents are,"
Wright said.
So Todd Lichti is going to spend
the next few weeks catching up
on classes and getting ready for
a mucky, humid summer in

Georgetown. He says he knows
more of what to expect from the
workouts, and he feels comforta
ble with the marquee players he'll
be living with.
"I think everyone is on a pretty
even keel, and it'll all depend on
what we do for the six weeks,"
he said.
And with that he went out to
play some more ball at Maples.
Lichti is right there with the best
in the nation, and he could very
well be right there in Seoul come
September.
