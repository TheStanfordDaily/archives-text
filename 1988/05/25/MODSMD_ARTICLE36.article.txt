An article in yesterday's Daily
incorrectly reported that there are
five tenured female faculty mem
bers at the Stanford Law School.
While there are five female law
professors, only two of them are
tenured.
Also, while it is true that in
the nearly 40-year history of the
Stanford Law Review there has
been only one female editor, the
article failed to mention explicitly
that the current editor is a female
and that another woman will hold
the position next year.
Finally, Law Prof. Charles
Lawrence was misinterpreted as
saying that Robin West was
denied tenure in the Law School.
In fact, West was never formally
considered for tenure at the Law
School.
