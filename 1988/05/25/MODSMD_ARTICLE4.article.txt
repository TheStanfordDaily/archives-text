# Union might file class action suit
## 
### Brent Hitler Staff writer 
Charging that the University treats
some of its employees "almost like a
servant class," the United Stanford
Workers announced yesterday that they
might file a class action suit against
the University, according to Linda
Crouse, chief steward for the USW.
The first of its kind pursued by the
USW, the class action suit would be
filed on behalf of all USW workers
rather than for individual employees.
Howard Moore, a renowned civil rights
lawyer from the Bay Area, will represent
the USW if the suit is in fact filed.

"We're bringing in the big guns,"
Crouse said of Moore.
According to Crouse, the catalyst for
filing the suit came when Stanford
Linear Accelerator employee Charlie
Barnard was suspended by SLAC man
agement on April 22 after protesting
that he was treated unfairly. SLAC con
tends that Barnard was suspended for
insubordination.
Barnard has won three grievances
against the University in the last two
years. Most recently, on April 13, Bar
nard won a workman's compensation
suit for loss of hearing on the job.
Crouse also cited alleged cases of Uni
versity racism as a reason for filing the

suit. She pointed to one incident where
junior Darrel Daniels, who works as a
University technician, was allegedly
called a "slave" on the job. Daniels con
firmed the allegation.
Despite Crouse's charges, USW rep
resentatives said they would only file
the suit as a last resort after all other
negotiating methods with the Univer
sity have been exhausted.
"In an ideal world we would expect
that a great University like Stanford
would take the initiative" to enter into
negotiations, Moore said.
For the present, however, union rep
resentatives said they are are still gath
ering information regarding the suit.
