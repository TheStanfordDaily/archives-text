# Coalition seeks to help minority grad students
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
The United Graduate Students' Alliance,
a newly-formed coalition of graduate mi
nority groups here, yesterday sent a pro
posal to University President Donald Ken
nedy which addresses specific "problem
areas" in graduate minority life at Stanford
and makes several suggestions for improve
ment.
The group is asking Kennedy to "commit
himself to a meeting and to address these
problems," said George Yeltatzie, UGSA
organizer and president of the Stanford
Native American Graduate Students.
According to Yeltatzie, Kennedy is inter
ested in arranging a meeting.
The multi-facted proposal identifies
problem areas including underrepresenta
tion of minorities within the graduate pop
ulation and among Stanford faculty and

staff, lack of financial aid for minorities
and decentralization of services to the grad
uate minority community.
The proposal suggests traditional reme
dies to expand minority recruitment of fac
ulty members.
New suggestions were also made to
create a graduate minority theme house,
a graduate center for minority students
and a centralized office of minority affairs.
Yeltatzie said support for the proposal
came from a wide group of minority grad
uate organizations such as the Black Grad
uate Students' Association, the Native
American Law Students' Association and
the Asian American Graduate Students'
Association.
Yeltatzie said the letter was motivated
by "a desire to pinpoint the graduate mi
nority community."
Although graduate minority
students "identify with and sup
port undergraduate minority
groups," he said he feels that
graduate students experience
some "unique problems" because
they have less time and fewer
members with which to make
their concerns known.
He said all the groups feel they
have common problems. For ex
ample, some groups are experi
encing a lack of financial support
that discourages minority gradu
ate students from pursuing their
studies. Yeltatzie explained that
most minority students come to
graduate school without familial
support, thereby having greater
financial problems than most
white students.

Yeltatzie also said that many
minority students feel it is un
usually hard to meet other mi
norities because there is little con
tact between the various graduate
schools and "there is no special
sense of community" among grad
uate minorities.
This is largely a result of "a
lack of coordination and a duplica
tion of efforts between schools
and departments in their service
to minority students," he added.
He said the proposal for a grad
uate minority theme house and a
center for minority students
would address this problem.
Maynard Holliday, vice chair of
the Black Graduate Students' As
sociation, said one of the coali
tion's strongest concerns is that
the University develop a
centralized body to oversee and
monitor all minority programs.
