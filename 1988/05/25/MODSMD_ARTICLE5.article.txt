# Coalition seeks to help minority grad students
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
The United Graduate Students' Alliance,
a newly-formed coalition of graduate mi
nority groups here, yesterday sent a pro
posal to University President Donald Ken
nedy which addresses specific "problem
areas" in graduate minority life at Stanford
and makes several suggestions for improve
ment.
The group is asking Kennedy to "commit
himself to a meeting and to address these
problems," said George Yeltatzie, UGSA
organizer and president of the Stanford
Native American Graduate Students.
According to Yeltatzie, Kennedy is inter
ested in arranging a meeting.
The multi-facted proposal identifies
problem areas including underrepresenta
tion of minorities within the graduate pop
ulation and among Stanford faculty and

staff, lack of financial aid for minorities
and decentralization of services to the grad
uate minority community.
The proposal suggests traditional reme
dies to expand minority recruitment of fac
ulty members.
New suggestions were also made to
create a graduate minority theme house,
a graduate center for minority students
and a centralized office of minority affairs.
Yeltatzie said support for the proposal
came from a wide group of minority grad
uate organizations such as the Black Grad
uate Students' Association, the Native
American Law Students' Association and
the Asian American Graduate Students'
Association.
Yeltatzie said the letter was motivated
by "a desire to pinpoint the graduate mi
nority community."
