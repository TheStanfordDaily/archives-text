# Committee's initial findings
## Report says quality of minority life here poor 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Characterizing the campus environ
ment as one of "tension, frustration and
aggravation," the University Committee
on Minority Issues today called on the
University to improve the quality of mi
nority life at Stanford.
In its interim report, the UCMI says
that a "lack of effective leadership in
the Dean of Student Affairs (Office) is
perceived by minorities to be among the
most important causes of multicultural
and multiracial problems." The commit
tee suggests several methods of improv
ing minority relations within the Stan
ford community.
The "progress" report, as UCMI Chair
A 1 Camarillo calls it, assesses student,
faculty and staff perceptions of minority
life at Stanford. The committee has been
at work since the beginning of the school
year and will issue a final report next
October.
Camarillo, Fernando de Necochea and
Faye McNair-Knox (both staff members
of the UCMI) stressed that the interim
report is not the final product of the
committee's work.
For the interim report, the committee
examined and made recommendations
in the areas of curriculum, student life
and undergraduate and graduate
recruitment, admissions, student aid
and retention. It also assessed faculty
and staff recruitment, hiring, promotion
and development policies.
In the area of student life, the com
mittee made four recommendations for

action:
• The establishment of ongoing financial
support for each ethnic student center,
to be considered by the dean of Student
Affairs and the provost;
• "Continued institutional recognition of
ethnic theme house dormitories for their
special contributions to multiracial and
multi-ethnic diversity at Stanford";
• "The development of pilot projects
within and across student residences to
foster greater multicultural and multi
racial appreciation and understanding";
