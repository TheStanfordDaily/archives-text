LYMAN VAN SLYKE
~ AUTHOR OF
YANGTZE:
NATURE, HISTORY, AND THE RIVER
Originated as a Stanford Alumni Association Portable
Stanford Book. Trade edition published by Addison Wesley, $14.95.
"I have found Van Slyke's a really fascinating
experience-the combination of his broad vision over time
and space, of the geography of the river system with the
technology of transport and the technique for producing major
commodities, and his invocation of historical persons and
events. It is a superb achievement to approach Chinese life
and history through the vital medium of the river and all its
aspects."
John King Fairbank, Professor of History, Emeritus,
Harvard University
"This is a wonderfully graphic, exciting, and articulate
account of one of the world's most famous rivers. Professor
Van Slyke's highly informative Yangtze blends the river's
lacinating history with the important changes already made
and contemplated that will alter the face and future of China.
1 recommend it to both scholars and curious travelers."
Rober Shaplen, The New Yorker
