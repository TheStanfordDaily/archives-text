# Protesters apologize for masked vigil
## Students, Kennedy meet to discuss incident 
### John Pollack Senior staff writer 
Six Phi Delta Theta fraternity members
who participated in a controversial candle
light vigil outside Otero early Tuesday
morning apologized to members of campus
minority groups yesterday at a gathering
outside the Black House.
Standing quietly, the six listened as BSU
members explained the racial implications
of their actions and questioned the frater
nal system's commitment to educating its
members about minority concerns.
After the gathering, the Phi Delts and
about 40 other concerned students walked
to the Quad, where they were met by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy. At the
Quad, BSU Chair Mary Dillard read a
prepared statement urging President Ken
nedy and the University administration to
"take a strong stand against the types of
offensive and aggressive incidents that have
occured recently on campus." Kennedy
then met for almost an hour with repre
sentatives of the BSU, MEChA, the Asian-
American Student Association and Stu
dents United for a Democratic Education
to discuss recent events.
The Phi Delts, who came to the gathering
at the Black House on their own initiative,
presented the minority groups with a letter
from their fraternity apologizing for the
Otero incident, in which seven masked Phi
Delts, without the knowledge of the house
leadership, held a candlelight vigil outside
the freshman dorm to protest what they
considered the unfair expulsion of fresh
man Kenny Ehrman from Otero. The Uni
versity evicted Ehrman after a series of
incidents that culminated when he van
dalized his dorm's lounge and insulted his
resident fellow May 15.
Members of the BSU who spoke at the
gathering were less than forgiving for the
vigil, however, which evoked — uninten
tionally, claim the seven participants —
images of the Klu Klux Klan.
"If you wear masks and carry fire . . .
that equals the Klan," said former BSU
chair Bill King, a senior.
But junior Dave Eilgas, one of the par
ticipants in the vigil, said h« and the other

demonstrators were "ignorant that [their
actions] could be taken that way."
Several participants explained that they
did not intend the vigil as a demonstration
of support for Ehrman's actions, but only
as a protest of the University's decision to
evict him from Otero.
Phi Delt Vice President Clinton Payne,
who did not participate in the vigil, dis
avowed the actions of the participants and
expressed hope that the incident would not
be used to indict the entire fraternity. "I
don't think its right to punish the house
because seven people in the house were
uneducated," Payne said.
Dillard, a sophomore, and Black Greek
Letter Council President Mark Garner, a
senior and a member of Alpha Phi Alpha
fraternity, accused the Phi Delts — and
the housed fraternity system in general —
of insensitivity toward minority concerns.
Praising individual exceptions to this in
sensitivity, Dillard said fraternities should
take it upon themselves to sensitize their
members about the problems of racism and
homophobia.
"I want you all to be responsible for
educating yourselves," Dillard said, ex
plaining that campus minority groups are
tired of trying — with little success — to
do the job themselves.
Concluding her statement at the Quad,
Dillard thanked the Phi Delts for their
"dignity" in the face of such harsh public
scrutiny and criticism.
Kennedy, who had earlier requested a
meeting with the minority students, said
last night that while the Otero incident
was very unfortunate, subsequent events
have shown that Stanford has "some real
capacity as a community to deal with these
problems constructively."
At a house meeting in Otero Tuesday
night, the seven Phi Delts involved in the
vigil apologized for their actions. But ac
cording to Otero resident Lydia Sandoval,
a freshman, many residents found it dif
ficult to believe the participants' explana
tion that they did not foresee the racial
implications of their actions.
"It was really hard to believe. Some of
the things the [Phi Deltl spokesperson said
kind of untrue," Sandoval said.
