# Stanford Democrats endorse Garrison
## Group fights apathy toward 12th Congressional District election 
### Jason Bloomstein Staff writer 
The Stanford Democrats last night
endorsed candidate Jim Garrison for
the 12th Congressional District primary
election, which will take place June 7.
The 12th District includes Stanford and
much of the Silicon Valley area.
Garrison, along with Democratic op
ponents Gary Bond, Ernest Macias and
representatives for candidates Anna Es
hoo and Sylvia Simmonds squared off
in a two-hour debate hosted by the Stan
ford Democrats last night at Tresidder
Memorial Union.
Approximately 40 students, faculty,
alumni and supporters of the candidates
attended the meeting. Students, faculty
and alumni who are registered Demo
crats in this district cast ballots for the
endorsement following the meeting.
Garrison won 50 percent of the ap
proximately 30 votes and Eshoo came
in second with 25 percent. Garrison's
victory assures him "whole-hearted"
support from the 300-member Stanford
Democrats, according to chair Subodh

Chandra, a junior. But
he added that the or
ganization will support
whichever candidate
wins the upcoming pri
mary.
Chandra said the
debate and endorse
ment are designed to
fight the Stanford com
munity's unfamiliarity

with the candidates, allowing people to
"make an informed judgement" about
the election.
The endorsement of Garrison was the
first that Stanford Democrats have ever
made, according to Chandra. He said
the endorsement is important because
the Democratic primary is "highly con
tested," and if Stanford Democrats vote
as a block, they can have a "tremendous
impact" on the outcome of the primary.
Garrison said this endorsement is the
most important one. "I am reliant upon
people with conscience and vision," he
said after the results were released.
"These are overwhelmingly the stu
dents."

The Democratic Primary
is 'highly contested.'

In his opening remarks in the debate,
Garrison, who was born in China and
holds degrees from Santa Clara, Har
vard and Cambridge Universities, said
he supports an increase in international
corporate agreements. He also supports
improvements in health and child care,
more protection of the environment and
more "creative interaction" in dealing
with the Soviet Union.
The low attendance at the debate was
due to many factors, according to junior
David Cline, vice chair of the Stanford
Democrats. He said many students are
busy preparing for finals and the na
tional diversity of Stanford causes many
students to be unconcerned about local
elections.
Last night's meeting also conflicted
with a televised debate between Demo
cratic presidential hopefuls Michael Du
kakis and Jesse Jackson, Cline said.
