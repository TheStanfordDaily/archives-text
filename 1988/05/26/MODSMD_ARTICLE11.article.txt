# Final senate resolution: broadcast future meetings

Pizza, beer, EANABS and an ASSU
Senate meeting — it does not get any
better than this.
In addition to the abnormal proce
dures listed above, the 18th ASSU Sen
ate unanimously approved two bills in
its final meeting last night. The first
bill, which passed 12-0, was next year's
ASSU operating budget. The second —
to dissolve the 18th senate — passed
after no debate.
The 19th senate will take over in its
first official meeting tomorrow night.
A third bill, approved with one dis
senting vote, allocates funds so Public
Access Television can continue live
cablecasts of senate meetings on SUNet,
the University channel. The ASSU will
purchase its own camcorder, tripod,
microphone and cables at a total cost
of $1,500.

Alex Danel, co-founder of PAT, has
broadcast the last three senate meetings
using PAT-owned cameras. He said the
ASSU money will allow PAT to provide
"consistent performance" in televising
senate meetings with two cameras. He
said coverage of the biweekly meetings
will serve to "increase representative
government."
In the process of approving the
budget, the senate decreased the number
of straw polls scheduled for next year
from 13 to nine. The straw polls began
surveying students about ASSU projects
and student issues this year, under the
direction of COP member Jim Durkin
and coordinator Patty Marby.
Seven random student polls occurred
this year, and the proposed 13 would
make the ASSU straw poll a biweekly
survey. Durkin said limiting next year's
coordinator to nine polls will "destroy
the potential usefulness and timeliness
of the organization."
