Meese launches defense effort
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 launched a full-scale defense cam
paign yesterday three weeks before an inde
pendent counsel's report on his legal problems
is scheduled to be completed, an aggressive
drive that Meese aides say shows that he in
tends to stay on despite widespread calls for
his resignation.
"He'll be the one to turn the lights off,"
predicted one Department of Justice official
who contends that Meese will leave Washing
ton with President Reagan next January.
Meese, who told conservative Republican
senators last week that there is no reason for
him to step down, held three meetings yes
terday to state his case. He first met with a
group of GOP House members known as the
Conservative Opportunity Society and then
had lunch with the Wednesday Group, a
Capitol Hill group of conservative congressmen
and organizations.
Finally, Meese held a session at the Depart
ment of Justice with the Washington Times'
editorial board, which broke with conservative
ranks earlier this month by calling for Meese's
resignation.
"This is a prelude to the push we will make
once the independent counsel's report comes
out," said Patrick Korten, Meese's new chief
press representative, who is mapping out the
counteroffensive along with Assistant Attorney
General William Bradford Reynolds and Meese
aide Mark Levin.
INF treaty survives attacks
WASHINGTON — Senate leaders cleared a
major hurdle yesterday in their drive to ap
prove the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INK) Treaty before the Moscow summit Sun
day after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., conceded
that he is "licked" in his fight against the pact.
Under a partial agreement between Helms
and treaty proponents, the Senate halted
debate on proposed "killer amendments" to
the treaty text and moved to a final series of
struggles about its resolution of ratification.
Senate leaders said it will be approved by
Saturday at the latest.
This would allow time to fly the official
papers to Moscow for final ratification of the
pact, which would eliminate ground-based
weapons with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles.
As the Senate worked into the night, its
leaders neared agreement with Helms on a
broader compromise to avoid a protracted
showdown over cloture and bring the treaty
to a final vote as early as tomorrow.
Participants in the negotiations said Helms
is no longer an "obstacle" to a final treaty
vote. They said he would abandon opposition
to a pre-summit vote on the treaty in exchange
for votes on key proposals of his own and
leadership support for some of them.
