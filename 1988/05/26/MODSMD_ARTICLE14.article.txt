# Administration-Noriega deal collapses
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan ad
ministration angrily broke off negoti
ations with Gen. Manuel Noriega yes
terday, admitting failure in its attempt
to talk the Panamanian general into
relinquishing power but vowing to con
tinue diplomatic, economic and, per
haps, new types of pressure to drive
him out of the nation.
Secretary of State George Shultz an
nounced that Noriega balked at a deal
— which had been accepted by his
representatives — that would have re
quired him to step down next August
in exchange for dismissal of American
drug-trafficking charges against him.
It also would have allowed his hand
picked president to remain in power.
"No further negotiations are con
templated," Shultz said. "All proposals
addressed during these negotiations
have been withdrawn. No offers

remain on the table."
Shultz, who delayed his departure
for the Moscow summit meeting by
about eight hours to direct the last
gasp of the negotiations with Noriega,
said the United States would continue
its economic sanctions against Panama
and would take other steps — which
he refused to spell out — "to get Nor
iega out of power and out of Panama."
Shultz refused to say whether mil
itary steps were contemplated, but an
other senior official said a U.S.-backed
coup within the Panamanian military
was a possibility.
Law enforcement officials and
hardline members of Congress hailed
the collapse of the deal, which they
had denounced as being too generous
to Noriega. Panamanian opposition
leaders, who had long complained that
the plan would allow Noriega to hold

onto power from behind the scenes,
reluctantly accepted the administra
tion's position Tuesday night only to
see it collapse less than 24 hours later.
The end of the talks saved Vice Pres
ident George Bush from an embar
rassing dilemma that would have
forced him to choose between appear
ing disloyal to the administration or
appearing soft on drugs. Bush has
made it clear that he opposed dropping
the drug-trafficking indictments that
were brought against Noriega in
Florida, but he has been reluctant to
attack the administration.
President Reagan, arriving in Hel
sinki, Finland, on his way to his Mos
cow summit meeting with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev, said he did
not feel weakened in any way by the
failure to remove Noriega from office.
"It seemed for a time as if he had

some plan .. . but he changed his mind
about that," Reagan said.
U.S. officials apparently believed
Tuesday night that Noriega would ac
cept the U.S. proposal. The State De
partment arranged to receive a direct
broadcast of Radio Panama's main
early morning newscast, apparently
believing that Noriega's acceptance of
the plan would be announced at that
time. State Department officials also
solicited approval of the deal from Pan
amanian exile leaders in Washington.
When the plan began to go sour
Tuesday morning, Michael Kozak, the
chief American negotiator, continued
his talks in Panama City, hoping to
put it back on the track. U.S. officials
said the talks finally broke off at about
4 p.m. EDT. Shultz made his an
nouncement less than an hour later.
