# Soviets estimate Afghanistan casualties
## 
### 
MOSCOW â€” The Soviet Union said
yesterday that 13,310 soldiers had
been killed in Afghanistan since the
Kremlin sent troops there more than
eight years ago.
General Alexei Lizichev said 35,478
soldiers had been wounded and 311
were missing, but he did not disclose
how many soldiers Moscow had
deployed in the country.
Soviet authorities had spoken of "a
limited military contingent," while
Western experts estimated that
120,000 troops were stationed in Af

ghanistan.
So far, 9,500 soldiers and about
1,000 "units of military equipment"
have been pulled out of Afghanistan,
Lizichev said.
First Deputy Minister of Foreign Af
fairs Yuly Vorontsov said that the pul
lout was proceeding in accordance with
last month's Geneva agreement.
Vorontsov warned that Moslem
rebels attacking withdrawing Soviet
forces would be "decidedly trounced"
and said Moscow reserved the right
to take "appropiate" steps if Pakistan

did not disband rebel military bases.
The Soviet Union expects Islamabad
to correct its stance and abide by the
non-interference agreements con
tained in the Geneva accords,
Vorontsov said.
If Pakistan fails to comply, "it could
be that we will call another press con
ference like this one to announce how
we will react," the minister said.
Last week Vorontsov met with his
Pakistani counterpart, Zain Noorani,
in Moscow and conveyed the Soviet
Union's concern about Pakistan's at

titude, Soviet sources said.
Vorontsov described reports by Af
ghan rebels that they controlled 18
provinces and surrounded the city of
Jalalabad as "inventions of fantasy."
He accused Islamic rebel groups
allied with Gulbuddin Hikmetyar of
wanting to establish an Islamic
fundamentalist dictatorship.
Soviet troops began their with
drawal from Afghanistan by pulling
out of Jalalabad on the Pakistani bor
der May 15.
