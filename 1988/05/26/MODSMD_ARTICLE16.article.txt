# Widened health care bill advances
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - House
and Senate conferees yesterday
unanimously approved the
most sweeping expansion of
Medicare since its creation in
1965,. one designed to protect
33 million elderly and disabled
beneficiaries from "catastroph
ic" hospital and doctor bills and
outpatient drug costs.
The conferees applauded as
House Ways and Means Chair
man Dan Rostenkowski, D-111.,
told Health and Human Serv 4
ices Secretary Otis BoweifJ
"You were the linchpin" in the
fight for the bill.
Bowen two years ago pro
posed "catastrophic" legisla
tion and won President
Reagan's endorsement. But
when Congress added numer
ous benefits, Bowen and other

administration spokesmen
warned they might recommend
a veto.
After the vote, however,
Bowen said that as a result of
last-minute changes, "I person
ally will endorse" the final ver
sion.
The bill is expected to go to
the House floor for final ap
proval next week and then to
the Senate.
The existing Medicare pro
gram provides a wide range of
benefits. But people who have
long hospital stays, very large
doctor bills and big outpatient
drug payments or who go into
nursing homes for long-term
care can be hit with bills that
exceed what Medicare will pay
by tens of thousands of dollars.
