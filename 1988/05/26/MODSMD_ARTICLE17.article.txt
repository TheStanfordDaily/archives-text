### 
JERUSALEM — In the second assault
this month against pro-Iranian guerrillas,
Israeli jets, helicopter gunships and ar
tillery hammered guerrilla strongholds in
side Lebanon yesterday to support an at
tack by allied Lebanese militia.
Guerrillas of the Shia Moslem fundamen
talist group Hezbollah were attacked in
three Lebanese villages by tank-led troops
of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
Reports from Beirut indicated that 45 guer
rillas had been killed or wounded.
A military press representative said that
no Israeli infantry had taken part in the
attack. Israeli fire, they said, came from
the air and from armor and artillery within
the so-called security zone that Israel con
trols along the Lebanese side.«f the border.
Lt. Gen. Dan Shomrom, the army chief
of staff, told a hews reporter that Hezbollah
had created several strongholds just beyond
the zone "for attacks into the zone and
against Israel." The fighting took place in
the same area that Israel invaded May 4,
about 30 miles south of Beirut. The earlier
incursion lasted two days and left 40 guer
rillas and three Israeli soldiers dead.
Israeli officials say that guerrilla pres
sure and attempts at infiltration across the

border are calculated gestures of Arab sup
port for the Palestinian unrest that has
been going on since December in the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Troops shot and killed a 45-year-old Arab
protester in Gaza late Tuesday, and at
least two other people were wounded in
sporadic clashes during a general strike,
the latest in a series, that paralyzed the
territories yesterday.
A curfew was reimposed on at least four
refugee camps and villages in Gaza and in
the largest camp on the West Bank after
protests to commemorate the assassination
last month in Tunisia of the Palestinian
military leader Abu Jihad.
Shomrom, whose meeting with reporters
been scheduled in advance, defended
the performance of troops in the occupied
territ&riei, but said that "several 10s" of
soldiers had been been punished for exces
sive use of force and other abuses since
the unrest began.
Reports from Beirut last night said that.
400 to 600 troops of the mostly Christian
South Lebanon Army attacked three vil
lages about a mile outside the zone after
the Israeli bombardment.
