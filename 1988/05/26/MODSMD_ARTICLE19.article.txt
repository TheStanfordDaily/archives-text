## Keep incentives 
### 
RELAX. If you're on financial
aid, don't bother earning a
lot of money this summer.
You won't benefit from it.
That's the message the federal
government is sending students
through a new law that takes effect
in the 1988-89 academic year.
The law requires all students re
ceiving financial aid to contribute
70 percent of their earnings — mi
nus taxes and minus work-study
money — from the previous 12
months to their education.
The rule, passed by Congress
two years ago to amend the 1965
Higher Education Act, differs from
the current federal financial aid
system in that it imposes an
across-the-board levy on student
earnings.
Under the old system of award
ing aid, financial aid officials
merely established $900 ($7OO for
incoming freshmen) as the stand
ard amount a student would be
expected to contribute. Now, any
income higher than these two fig
ures is automatically subject to the
70 percent blanket "tax."
The rule assumes that all stu
dents can contribute the same pro
portion of their earnings directly
to their tuition with equal ease. It
does not account for the varying
economic backgrounds of the par
ents of students who apply for ty
nancial aid.
And since the measure takes a
straight percentage (after the $700
and $900 minimums) out of wages,
it necessarily discourages students
from finding high-paying jobs.
What incentive will students
have to look for a higher-salaried
job when they know the extra
money they earn will go directly
toward tuition? Most students
would rather spend half of the
summer earning their $900 and
then spend the rest of their time

having fun.
Besides reducing incentive to
work, the system perpetuates
stratification between students in
different income brackets. Al
though upper-class students will
not be affected, disadvantaged stu
dents — who depend on summer
income to pay for living expenses
over the school year — will be
forced to put that money toward
tuition. They might not have other
means to provide for living ex
penses.
In effect, the law will keep poor
students poor, and rich students
rich.
The new system also complicates
an already thick, sluggish bureau
cracy.
Any financial aid applicant
knows the system is encumbered
by lengthy criteria that must be
considered in awarding packages.
Because each student will have
to contribute a different amount
of money (rather than just one
figure of $700 or $900), the mea
sure compounds an already over
complicated system.
As a result, the University fi
nancial aid office will suffer, since
it — not the federal government
— is responsible for determining
financial need, after which the gov
ernment makes its awards.
If the legislation indicates the
government's desire to decrease
the large number of student loan
defaults, it is clearly the wrong
approach.
In attempting to be more frugal,
the government should act more
like a bank, basing financial aid
awards on a person's proven ability
to pay back loans.
Students on financial aid should
be encouraged to earn extra
money, not penalized for efforts to
better their position.
