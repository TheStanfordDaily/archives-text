# Focus on homophobia issue fades
## 
### Lori Silver Eric Young: Senior staff writers 
The role homophobia played in the
eviction of freshman Kenny Ehrman
and Monday's midnight vigil at Otero
may have been overlooked in an event
that has become a conflict largely cen

Seven members of Phi Delta Theta,
wearing masks and holding lighted
candles, conjured images of the Ku

what they saw as an infringement
upon Ehrman's freedom of speech.
Sophomore Steven Sassaman and
senior Barb Voss, members of Stan

disregarded by both Ehrman and the
vigil participants, who yesterday
delivered letters of apology to the
Black Student Union.
Ehrman's eviction, handed down by
Residential Education last week, came
as a result of a string of offensive
actions, including numerous homo

openly gay dorm resident assistant.
Freshman Matt Rogers, a friend of
Ehrman's who lives in Otero, said
homophobia was definitely the main

issue behind Ehrman's actions.
Neither Ehrman nor the Phi Delts
have apologized to the gay communi

Russ Pangborn, a junior, said there
were no plans to apologize specifically
to the gay community.
Pangborn released a statement yes
terday apologizing to the BSU for the
"ignorance" of the protesters in bring
ing out images of the Klan. Although
the gay community was not men

plied to all groups.
Ehrman was not available for com

Phi Delts who participated in the vigil
supporting Ehrman will release a
