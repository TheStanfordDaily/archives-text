# Focus on homophobia issue fades
## 
### Lori Silver Eric Young: Senior staff writers 
The role homophobia played in the
eviction of freshman Kenny Ehrman
and Monday's midnight vigil at Otero
may have been overlooked in an event
that has become a conflict largely cen
tered on racial issues.
Seven members of Phi Delta Theta,
wearing masks and holding lighted
candles, conjured images of the Ku
Klux Kian in a protest held to oppose
what they saw as an infringement
upon Ehrman's freedom of speech.
Sophomore Steven Sassaman and
senior Barb Voss, members of Stan
ford Organzation for Lesbian and Gay
Equality, said the gay community felt

as threatened as the black community
by the vigil because "hate groups"
like the KKK endanger not only
blacks, but also gays and other mi
nority groups.
Members of Stanford's gay commu
nity said their concerns have been
disregarded by both Ehrman and the
vigil participants, who yesterday
delivered letters of apology to the
Black Student Union.
Ehrman's eviction, handed down by
Residential Education last week, came
as a result of a string of offensive
actions, including numerous homo
phobic remarks directed toward an
openly gay dorm resident assistant.
Freshman Matt Rogers, a friend of
Ehrman's who lives in Otero, said
homophobia was definitely the main

issue behind Ehrman's actions.
Neither Ehrman nor the Phi Delts
have apologized to the gay communi
ty, Sassaman said. Phi Delt President
Russ Pangborn, a junior, said there
were no plans to apologize specifically
to the gay community.
Pangborn released a statement yes
terday apologizing to the BSU for the
"ignorance" of the protesters in bring
ing out images of the Klan. Although
the gay community was not men
tioned, Pangborn said the apology ap
plied to all groups.
Ehrman was not available for com
ment last night. The seven masked
Phi Delts who participated in the vigil
supporting Ehrman will release a
statement today explaining their
actions, according to junior John
Romero, a vigil participant.
Other participants declined to
comment.
The steering committee of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford released a statement last
night in support of gays and les
bians at Stanford who face homo
phobia.
"We don't consider harassment
of gays to be a First Amendment
right," Sassaman said.

However, SOLGE supports the
First Amendment rights of people
to question and criticize the gay
community or to be homophobic,
Voss said.
But she added that Ehrman's
and the protesters' actions
crossed the line between free
speech and verbal harassment.
Sassaman and Voss charged the
University to make students re
sponsible for educating students
about homosexuality.
The University should "respond
to action with action," they said.
In order to prevent future in
cidents, SOLGE issued the Uni
versity four demands. They asked

it to:
• Create an aggressive Res Ed
program to educate students
about acceptable behavior in Uni
versity housing;
• Set up a support mechanism
for students, faculty and staff who
encounter harassment. The body
should be well publicized, easily
accessible and empowered to act
upon complaints;
• Provide greater financial and
public support for minority com
munities; and,
• Investigate the structural
problems within the University
that allowed the current contro
versy to occur.
