Millions of hours of work in
cluttered laboratories across the
nation — laboratories similar to
those found at Stanford — have resulted
in the sort of applied technologies that
gives us compact disc players,
microwaves, artificial hearts and national
defense systems.
But it is only through years of work
and billions of dollars that ideas can be
come products capable of changing our
quality of life. Stanford, as one of the
major research universities in the U.S.,
will ultimately play a substantial role in
the advancement of future technology. It
is unfortunate therefore that institutions
like Stanford still feel financially strained
by insufficient research funding.
Just earlier this month, for example,
one emminent researcher, Engineering
Prof. John Madey, announced his depar
ture to Duke University because of the
outrageous costs of doing research at
Stanford.
At Stanford, researchers find that their
grants quickie dwindle away to nothing
because of the high costs of working at
an institution that has so many other
finanicial obligations, programs and
sources of overhead. These indirect costs
detract greatly from the funding available
to do scientific work.
This is unfortunate, both because these
huge overheads drive way otherwise
devoted faculty and because it is these
overhead costs that are responsible for
the student services, libraries and admin
istrative costs that are essential to run
ning a university. It is not possible to
greatly reduce these costs without in
some way detracting from the quality of

education that we expect from Stanford.
So, we are left in a seemingly ines
capable bind — a situation where we
must cut off one hand to foster the
growth and development of the other.
This is not, however, the only alternative.
There are at least two other avenues that
can be approached to encourage scientific
research while maintaining a high level
of undergraduate resources. One of these
is the government and the other, more
promising one, is American industry.
The government should be more gen
erous and less bureaucratic in its support
of academic research. While Stanford
remains among the most well-endowed
universities nationwide, much of our
funding is tied up in complicated bureau
cratic processes, full of contingencies, red
ink and constraining stipulations.
Academia does not function best under
these conditions.
Furthermore, the last five years have
seen, on the average, 32 percent of the
private sector's research and develop
ment directly subsidized by federal funds.
In these same years, federal grants and
subsidies to universities have fallen
markedly.
Because government has supported in
dustry over academia, universities should
consider building alliances with econom
ically well-equipped industries. It is no
secret that industries are a vast source
of wealth for academic fields with poten
tially marketable research. We should
take advantage of this mutually beneficial
situation as have Japan, Germany and
England.
The long-standing taboo against indus
try intermingling with academia should

be abandoned. Researchers worry that
monetary support from industry will
drown the tradition of free exchange of
ideas and information. They worry that
truths will be concealed because of pos
sible stipulations that data be classified
as secret. But, as long as universities can
maintain their "intellectual detachment"
and committment to truth and shared
knowledge, they can benefit immensely
from this type of working relationship.
Clearly, we cannot dive into such a
relationship without examining its impli
cations, but as long as an oversight com
mittee is established and strict guidelines
to ensure the honest exchange of infor
mation are decided upon, there can be
very little inherent danger in combining
forces to solve the problem of shrinking
resources and research monies.
Universities are a rich source of ideas
and abilities. We should use this attrac
tion to foster our growth and to help in
creating more applied technologies. In
the long run, this is the best way to
ensure that we'll attract and produce the
kind of scientists that will continue to
improve the quality of our lives and the
caliber of our knowledge.
