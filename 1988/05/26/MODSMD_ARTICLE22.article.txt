## ASSU Does institutional racism exist within the ASSU? 
### 
PRO

Many members of the
ASSU claim to be insulted
and outraged by the ac
knowledgement of the
ASSU Senate Chair's
Task Force that institu
tional racism exists within

the ASSU and affected our decisions in
staff selection.
We are members of the ASSU who
stand by the task force report and feel
that such an outcry is nothing more than
a defensive overreaction.
First of all, we need to clarify what
we mean by institutional racism. Insti
tutional racism is not blatant. It is not
the fault of individuals. Institutional rac
ism is simply when an institution finds
itself affected by the racism that pervades
our entire society.
Our report never claimed that ASSU
members engaged in blatanly racist at
tacks in staff selection. We never singled
out individuals as deserving attention for
their racism.
We simply pointed out that, like most
other institutions on this campus and in
this society, we are troubled by the prob
lem of institutional racism. It is a prob
lem that we need to remedy through
educating ourselves and adopting stricter
procedures for staff selection.
Many point to the large number of
minority students in ASSU positions as
evidence that we could not have a prob
lem with institutional racism. We are all
very proud of this record. We feel that
in the past few years the participation
of students of color in the ASSU has
expanded tremendously, and our efforts
have contributed to this trend.
Task force critics also point to our
hiring statistics and claim, "Numbers
don't lie." But statistics taken at face
value don't tell the whole story.
While 11 of 12 black candidates re
ceived positions, the quality of black can
didates applying for posistions rendered
such an approval rate appropriate. Be

cause there is currently such extensive
involvement of ethnic minorities in the
ASSU, their communities produced many
more qualified applicants than did the
general student body.
For example, the recently selected Pro
gram Board is made up entirely of stu
dents of color. The reason for this is that
almost all of the applicants were students
of color.
But these statistics also divert us from
the real issue. The controversy was not
that black students had a lower selection
rate than other students. As a matter of
fact, in two of the controversial cases,
the black students actually received po
sitions.
What then was the problem? Black ap
plicants were often assumed to be
"biased" while white applicants were not.
Black candidates were questioned about
being focused on "special interest con
cerns," while other applicants were not.
Many positions that black students re
ceived became subjects of controversy and
back-room dealing .within the ASSU,
while other positions did not.
We did not feel that these occurances
were coincidental or because of extenuat
ing circumstances that task force critics
cite, but that they were symptomatic of
a larger problem which demands atten
tion and careful remedy.
We are certainly not trying to attack
or condemn the ASSU. We are all part
of the ASSU and feel proud of our con
tributions to opening it up to Stanford's
diverse student body. But when we find
ourselves unconsciously participating in
institutional racism, we have to admit it.
We have to admit it first in order to
change it.

Racism is wrong. Racism
is evil. There are no two
ways about it. But the
ASSU is not racist. Those
in the People's Platform
and others who charge the
ASSU with racism had

better take a good look at themselves
and at the situation.
These people have labeled the ASSU
racist, either directly or as being a part
of "institutional" racism that exists
throughout society. They have cited a
few instances to support their positions.
They cite the ASSU staff selection process
and questioning of minority groups' spe
cial fees in claiming that minorities are
held to a "higher standard" than non
minorities.
This is simply not the case.
First, the claim that the staff selection
process was racist is hogwash. Skills and
individual qualifications (not race) were
what determined who recieved positions.
When the individual cases were ex
plained td The Daily and the ASSU Sen
ate, it was clear that race was not a
factor. In fact, two of the three candidates
whose cases have been debated received
their positions in the ASSU, and the
third candidate, Terri James, herself told
The Daily that racism was not involved.
The BSU and others who have leveled
these charges have done an excellent job
of exaggerating and overreacting to the
situations.
The claims that minorities are "held
to higher standards" than others is ri
diculous. First, we haven't seen any proof
so far in any of the discussions. Who
sets these mysterious standards — the
selection committees, most of which were
composed of minority students? Get real.
Just because someone is a minority
does not mean he or she has a bias, but
if a minority is involved in other organ
izations, that person will be questioned
just like anyone else.
Now let us take a look at the statistics

in the supposed "racist" ASSU.
Numbers don't lie. On the whole, eth
nic minority students had a better chance
than white in obtaining positions. For
example, the Program Board staff is made
up of five blacks and one Asian.
In fact, next year's ASSU staff is made
up of 56 percent minorities. Yes, it's true
— minorities are a majority in the ASSU!
This is almost about twice the level of
minorities enrolled at Stanford.
When discussing the purported racism
in the ASSU, those antagonists con
veniently ignore and/or dismiss these
hiring statistics. They claim that the high
level is due to the high level of involve
ment of blacks. On the contrary, this is
a clear example of the success of the
ASSU's continued outreach and recruit
ing to minority communities.
We thank God that people have been
able to see through these empty charges.
Before writing its excellent editorial (BSU
Cries Wolf, April 18), The Daily editorial
board spent two days interviewing people
from both sides of the issue. The Daily
came to the conclusion that racism was
not involved in the ASSU hiring proce
dure.
Furthermore, the ASSU Senate last
week overwhelmingly rejected (by 13-1
vote) the recently released Senate Chair
Task Force on Staff Hiring report stating
that racism existed in the staff hiring
process.
Smell the roses. We definitely agree
that there are racial injustices in many
parts of the world. But the ASSU is not
the place to be attacking your fellow stu
dents or to be looking for racism — in
stitutional or otherwise. We are proud
to say that we are a part of the ASSU
— an organization with a hiring and
funding record that serves as a model
for other departments of Stanford.

Racism is wrong. Racism
is evil. There are no two
ways about it. But the
ASSU is not racist. Those
in the People's Platform
and others who charge the
ASSU with racism had

better take a good look at themselves
and at the situation.
These people have labeled the ASSU
racist, either directly or as being a part
of "institutional" racism that exists
throughout society. They have cited a
few instances to support their positions.
They cite the ASSU staff selection process
and questioning of minority groups' spe
cial fees in claiming that minorities are
held to a "higher standard" than non
minorities.
This is simply not the case.
First, the claim that the staff selection
process was racist is hogwash. Skills and
individual qualifications (not race) were
what determined who recieved positions.
When the individual cases were ex
plained td The Daily and the ASSU Sen
ate, it was clear that race was not a
factor. In fact, two of the three candidates
whose cases have been debated received
their positions in the ASSU, and the
third candidate, Terri James, herself told
The Daily that racism was not involved.
The BSU and others who have leveled
these charges have done an excellent job
of exaggerating and overreacting to the
situations.
The claims that minorities are "held
to higher standards" than others is ri
diculous. First, we haven't seen any proof
so far in any of the discussions. Who
sets these mysterious standards — the
selection committees, most of which were
composed of minority students? Get real.
Just because someone is a minority
does not mean he or she has a bias, but
if a minority is involved in other organ
izations, that person will be questioned
just like anyone else.
Now let us take a look at the statistics

in the supposed "racist" ASSU.
Numbers don't lie. On the whole, eth
nic minority students had a better chance
than white in obtaining positions. For
example, the Program Board staff is made
up of five blacks and one Asian.
In fact, next year's ASSU staff is made
up of 56 percent minorities. Yes, it's true
— minorities are a majority in the ASSU!
This is almost about twice the level of
minorities enrolled at Stanford.
When discussing the purported racism
in the ASSU, those antagonists con
veniently ignore and/or dismiss these
hiring statistics. They claim that the high
level is due to the high level of involve
ment of blacks. On the contrary, this is
a clear example of the success of the
ASSU's continued outreach and recruit
ing to minority communities.
We thank God that people have been
able to see through these empty charges.
Before writing its excellent editorial (BSU
Cries Wolf, April 18), The Daily editorial
board spent two days interviewing people
from both sides of the issue. The Daily
came to the conclusion that racism was
not involved in the ASSU hiring proce
dure.
Furthermore, the ASSU Senate last
week overwhelmingly rejected (by 13-1
vote) the recently released Senate Chair
Task Force on Staff Hiring report stating
that racism existed in the staff hiring
process.
Smell the roses. We definitely agree
that there are racial injustices in many
parts of the world. But the ASSU is not
the place to be attacking your fellow stu
dents or to be looking for racism — in
stitutional or otherwise. We are proud
to say that we are a part of the ASSU
— an organization with a hiring and
funding record that serves as a model
for other departments of Stanford.

Many members of the
ASSU claim to be insulted
and outraged by the ac
knowledgement of the
ASSU Senate Chair's
Task Force that institu
tional racism exists within

the ASSU and affected our decisions in
staff selection.
We are members of the ASSU who
stand by the task force report and feel
that such an outcry is nothing more than
a defensive overreaction.
First of all, we need to clarify what
we mean by institutional racism. Insti
tutional racism is not blatant. It is not
the fault of individuals. Institutional rac
ism is simply when an institution finds
itself affected by the racism that pervades
our entire society.
Our report never claimed that ASSU
members engaged in blatanly racist at
tacks in staff selection. We never singled
out individuals as deserving attention for
their racism.
We simply pointed out that, like most
other institutions on this campus and in
this society, we are troubled by the prob
lem of institutional racism. It is a prob
lem that we need to remedy through
educating ourselves and adopting stricter
procedures for staff selection.
Many point to the large number of
minority students in ASSU positions as
evidence that we could not have a prob
lem with institutional racism. We are all
very proud of this record. We feel that
in the past few years the participation
of students of color in the ASSU has
expanded tremendously, and our efforts
have contributed to this trend.
Task force critics also point to our
hiring statistics and claim, "Numbers
don't lie." But statistics taken at face
value don't tell the whole story.
While 11 of 12 black candidates re
ceived positions, the quality of black can
didates applying for posistions rendered
such an approval rate appropriate. Be

cause there is currently such extensive
involvement of ethnic minorities in the
ASSU, their communities produced many
more qualified applicants than did the
general student body.
For example, the recently selected Pro
gram Board is made up entirely of stu
dents of color. The reason for this is that
almost all of the applicants were students
of color.
But these statistics also divert us from
the real issue. The controversy was not
that black students had a lower selection
rate than other students. As a matter of
fact, in two of the controversial cases,
the black students actually received po
sitions.
What then was the problem? Black ap
plicants were often assumed to be
"biased" while white applicants were not.
Black candidates were questioned about
being focused on "special interest con
cerns," while other applicants were not.
Many positions that black students re
ceived became subjects of controversy and
back-room dealing .within the ASSU,
while other positions did not.
We did not feel that these occurances
were coincidental or because of extenuat
ing circumstances that task force critics
cite, but that they were symptomatic of
a larger problem which demands atten
tion and careful remedy.
We are certainly not trying to attack
or condemn the ASSU. We are all part
of the ASSU and feel proud of our con
tributions to opening it up to Stanford's
diverse student body. But when we find
ourselves unconsciously participating in
institutional racism, we have to admit it.
