## Casa Zapata Resident Assistant Charlie Montoya Renaissance senior gives quality time to all 
### Maryellen Driscoll 
Look out Leonardo, here comes Charlie.
Although fifth-year senior Charlie Mon
toya has yet to paint the Mona Lisa, he
has become the Renaissance man on
campus, according to several very diverse
members of the Stanford community.
As director of a campus choir, a Casa
Zapata resident assistant and student di
rector for intramural sports, Montoya pro
vides guidance not only for serious singers
but for anxious athletes and frenzied fresh
men as well.
"He is kind of a Renaissance person,"
according to Russel Roid, director of the
campus ministry for Stanford's Catholic
community. Roid, who has known Montoya
for four years, explained that Montoya co
directs the Newman Center choir, organ
izing singers for the two Catholic masses
held on campus every Sunday.
"People kind of rally around him," Roid
said, praising Montoya for recruiting nu
merous singers for the choir.
"He is really inspiring. . . . [Montoya] lets
people feel good enough about themselves
to sing," Roid added.
When Montoya is not inspiring
spirituality in Memorial Chuch, he is out
on the athletic fields, psyching up athletes.
During his freshman year, Montoya
worked as an IM referee and umpire. For
the following three years he was on the
IM staff and is now IM student director.
As the student director, Montoya spends
10 hours a week supervising IM games
and 15 hours organizing events from the
IM office.
"When you spend 10 hours a week
(watching IM games) you get to meet a lot
of students," he said.

Tm always amazed how
many people Charlie has
touched outside of the
dorm.'
— Cecilia Burciaga

Montoya admitted that although he takes
IMs as seriously as some of the "compet
itive" graduate students participating, they
sometimes criticize him for being "pretty
lax" on the job.
For example, he will wait for a team
that is 20 minutes late rather than cancel
a game. Also, if he needs one more umpire,
he will take on the job himself.
Susannah Robins, former IM coordinator
for the Graduate School of Business de
scribed Montoya as "very fair," "really con
siderate" and "incredibly helpful."
As a second-year resident assistant in
Zapata, Montoya applies his diplomacy on
the playing fields and in the dorms.
Describing her RA as the "upbeat social
architect," Zapata Resident Fellow Cecilia
Burciaga said that Montaya's diversity
makes him a role model for the residents.
"External involvement adds to Charlie's
credibility and substance," she said. "I'm
always amazed how many people Charlie
has touched outside of the dorm."
According to Zapata freshman Diane
Scott, Montoya is a visible dorm leader
despite his other commitments. Often
found playing guitar in the center of a
circle of Zapata residents, Montaya "still
finds time to hang out," she said.
"He gives so much of his time — quality
time," Scott added.
