# Mexican-American students: on campus and in culture
## 
### Lisa Brooks Staff writer 
One of the fastest growing minorities
in the country, and at Stanford, Mexican-
Americans often face cultural difficulties
that other students here would not en
counter.
"Some people confused me for one of
the Mexican food service workers," said
one freshman about his first week at
Stanford. The student, a Mexican-
American who wished to remain anony
mous, said that the assumptions fellow
students made about him "really hurt."
Family ties
Other students explained that the es
pecially close family ties associated with
their culture often discourage Mexican-
Americans — especially women — from
attending college.
"It's a big thing that you're not sup
posed to leave the house until you get
married," junior Julie Martinez said.
Martinez was the first person from her
high school in El Paso, Texas, to attend
Stanford.
"My parents were really happy about
me coming here, but they are more un
derstanding than most," Martinez said.
Sophomore Maria Gandera is one stu
dent of Mexican-American descent who
did not receive family support when she
decided to apply to colleges. Gandera,
who lived with her grandparents, said
did not tell them she applied to Stanford
until after she was admitted.
"It's like [my grandparents] don't care
that I'm going to college," Gandera said.
"They're glad I'm getting a good educa
tion, but my grandmother would be so
happy if 1 called her and told her I was
coming home tomorrow."
Deciding to leave her home in San
Fernando for Stanford was difficult, but
Gandera said she was determined to
succeed here.
"My aunts and uncles are factory
workers — I wanted something more
than that. I wanted to buy my

Upbeat Admissions
Despite some of the special difficulties
Mexican-Americans face, the number of
Mexican-American students at Stanford
has increased from 6 to 10 percent since
1981, according to Assistant Dean of Ad
missions Chris Ponce. Mexican-American
enrollment at Stanford is substantially
higher than the enrollments at Ivy
League colleges, Ponce said. In this year's
freshman class 126 of the students are
Mexican-American.
Ponce attributed the recent increases
in enrollment to the University's more
rigorous attempt to reach Chicano stu
dents through special outreach programs.
For example, in April, various student
groups sponsored Project Motivation, a
weekend where prospective freshman of
Mexican-American descent became ac
quainted with Stanford.
In addition, Admissions has stepped
up its efforts to recruit in areas with
large Mexican-American populations, in
cluding El Paso, East Los Angeles and
Chicago, Ponce said.
Admissions also mailed a special packet
of information about Stanford to minor
ity high school students who scored well
on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude
Tests in high school, hoping to encourage
them to apply to Stanford.
While the University has traditionally
sent letters to qualified minority stu
dents, this was the first year that stu
dents actually received a tabloid of in
formation.
"The number of students responding
to our search increased this year," Ponce

said, attributing the rise to the new pack
et.
In addition, minority students who
demonstrated sufficient financial need
were offered travel grants enabling them
to visit Stanford.
"It's a pilot program and it's something
we'd like to extend to more students in
the future, if possible," Ponce said about
the travel grants.
He went on to stress that Admissions
does not have lower standards for mi
norities but that it does look for special
factors in applicants' backgrounds that
set them apart from other candidates.
More targeting
While students acknowledged that Ad
missions tries to reach out to Mexican-
Americans, they said that not enough of
them are being targeted.
"There's just not enough recruit
ing. ... I had never even heard of Stan
ford before my senior year in high
school," Martinez said.
According to junior Jon Inda, Admis
sions "tries with what they have, but
they have a small staff. They miss a lot
of rural areas and minorities."
Inda, who was born in Mexico and
grew up in Santa Ana, said he believed
that Mexican-Americans at his high
school did not receive adequate attention
from school supervisors.
"I was one of two Mexicans in advanced
placement or honors-type classes," said
Inda about his high school, where there
was a substantial number of Spanish
speaking students.
"There were four counselors for 2,500
people. You lose track of a lot of people
that way," he said.

Inda said that his peers — not his high
school teachers or parents that "only
graduated from the sixth grade" —
sparked his interest in college.
Zapata
But for the Mexican-Americans who
do in fact opt for Stanford, Casa Zapata,
the Mexican-American Chicano theme
house, often becomes a home away from
home.
"Zapata has always served as a good
place to alleviate cultural shock," Zapata
Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga said.
While the house gives students a
chance to learn about Mexican-American
culture and recognize problems facing

Mexican-Americans, Burciaga said that
the cultural issue is not the house's main
concern.
"It's a home first of all," he said.
"We are very group-oriented people,
and it's part of this group-orientedness
that has made us a support system and
deemphasized the political nature of the
house," Burciaga explained.
Inda agreed that what Zapata gives is
a supportive environment for Mexican-
Americans.
"Casa Zapata is a good place for
Chicanos to come because there is a really
close family network and bonding here,"
Inda said.

Chicago, Ponce said.
Admissions also mailed a special packet
of information about Stanford to minor
ity high school students who scored well
on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude
Tests in high school, hoping to encourage
them to apply to Stanford.
While the University has traditionally
sent letters to qualified minority stu
dents, this was the first year that stu
dents actually received a tabloid of in
formation.
"The number of students responding
to our search increased this year," Ponce

said, attributing the rise to the new pack
et.
In addition, minority students who
demonstrated sufficient financial need
were offered travel grants enabling them
to visit Stanford.
"It's a pilot program and it's something
we'd like to extend to more students in
the future, if possible," Ponce said about
the travel grants.
He went on to stress that Admissions
does not have lower standards for mi
norities but that it does look for special
factors in applicants' backgrounds that
set them apart from other candidates.
More targeting
While students acknowledged that Ad
missions tries to reach out to Mexican-
Americans, they said that not enough of
them are being targeted.
"There's just not enough recruit
ing. ... I had never even heard of Stan
ford before my senior year in high
school," Martinez said.
According to junior Jon Inda, Admis
sions "tries with what they have, but
they have a small staff. They miss a lot
of rural areas and minorities."
Inda, who was born in Mexico and
grew up in Santa Ana, said he believed
that Mexican-Americans at his high
school did not receive adequate attention
from school supervisors.
"I was one of two Mexicans in advanced
placement or honors-type classes," said
Inda about his high school, where there
was a substantial number of Spanish
speaking students.
"There were four counselors for 2,500
people. You lose track of a lot of people
that way," he said.

Inda said that his peers — not his high
school teachers or parents that "only
graduated from the sixth grade" —
sparked his interest in college.
Zapata
But for the Mexican-Americans who
do in fact opt for Stanford, Casa Zapata,
the Mexican-American Chicano theme
house, often becomes a home away from
home.
"Zapata has always served as a good
place to alleviate cultural shock," Zapata
Resident Fellow Tony Burciaga said.
While the house gives students a
chance to learn about Mexican-American
culture and recognize problems facing

Mexican-Americans, Burciaga said that
the cultural issue is not the house's main
concern.
"It's a home first of all," he said.
"We are very group-oriented people,
and it's part of this group-orientedness
that has made us a support system and
deemphasized the political nature of the
house," Burciaga explained.
Inda agreed that what Zapata gives is
a supportive environment for Mexican-
Americans.
"Casa Zapata is a good place for
Chicanos to come because there is a really
close family network and bonding here,"
Inda said.

One of the fastest growing minorities
in the country, and at Stanford, Mexican-
Americans often face cultural difficulties
that other students here would not en
counter.
"Some people confused me for one of
the Mexican food service workers," said
one freshman about his first week at
Stanford. The student, a Mexican-
American who wished to remain anony
mous, said that the assumptions fellow
students made about him "really hurt."
Family ties
Other students explained that the es
pecially close family ties associated with
their culture often discourage Mexican-
Americans — especially women — from
attending college.
"It's a big thing that you're not sup
posed to leave the house until you get
married," junior Julie Martinez said.
Martinez was the first person from her
high school in El Paso, Texas, to attend
Stanford.
"My parents were really happy about
me coming here, but they are more un
derstanding than most," Martinez said.
Sophomore Maria Gandera is one stu
dent of Mexican-American descent who
did not receive family support when she
decided to apply to colleges. Gandera,
who lived with her grandparents, said
did not tell them she applied to Stanford
until after she was admitted.
"It's like [my grandparents] don't care
that I'm going to college," Gandera said.
"They're glad I'm getting a good educa
tion, but my grandmother would be so
happy if 1 called her and told her I was
coming home tomorrow."
Deciding to leave her home in San
Fernando for Stanford was difficult, but
Gandera said she was determined to
succeed here.
"My aunts and uncles are factory
workers — I wanted something more
than that. I wanted to buy my

grandparents a nice house," she ex
plained.
Upbeat Admissions
Despite some of the special difficulties
Mexican-Americans face, the number of
Mexican-American students at Stanford
has increased from 6 to 10 percent since
1981, according to Assistant Dean of Ad
missions Chris Ponce. Mexican-American
enrollment at Stanford is substantially
higher than the enrollments at Ivy
League colleges, Ponce said. In this year's
freshman class 126 of the students are
Mexican-American.
Ponce attributed the recent increases
in enrollment to the University's more
rigorous attempt to reach Chicano stu
dents through special outreach programs.
For example, in April, various student
groups sponsored Project Motivation, a
weekend where prospective freshman of
Mexican-American descent became ac
quainted with Stanford.
In addition, Admissions has stepped
up its efforts to recruit in areas with
large Mexican-American populations, in
cluding El Paso, East Los Angeles and
Chicago, Ponce said.
Admissions also mailed a special packet
of information about Stanford to minor
ity high school students who scored well
on the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude
Tests in high school, hoping to encourage
them to apply to Stanford.
