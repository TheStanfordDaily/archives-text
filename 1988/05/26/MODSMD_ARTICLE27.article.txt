## The 						other shoe drops — singles eliminated 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — Just a
day after the Stanford
men's tennis team won
the 1988 NCAA Tennis
Championships, each Car
dinal entry in the NCAA
Singles Championships

was eliminated yesterday.
With each player not showing the
tenacity that characterized the team
hunt, sophomore Jeff Tarango, senior
Patrick McEnroe, freshman Martin
Blackman and freshman David Wheaton
bowed quietly out of the tournament.
"(Not playing up to par) is a natural
combination of being physically tired and
emotionally drained from the team title,"
Stanford Coach Dick Gould said.
In doubles play late last night,
McEnroe and Blackman advanced 3-6,
6-3, 6-3 over No. 4 seeded Ed Nagel and
Malivai Washington of Michigan. The
Cardinal duo plays again this afternoon
— its opponent has yet to be determined.
Wheaton and Tarango play their first

round match against Wake Forest's
Dallwitz-Greenan pair today at 7 a.m.
PUT.
Because of rain, play moved from
Henry Feild Stadium to Lindsey Hopkins
Indoor Courts again yesterday. Michigan
was the Cardinal killer, as Wolverine
Nagel ousted Wheaton, 7-6 (8-6), 6-0 and
Washington dumped Tarango 4-6, 6-4,
6-1.
In the first set, Tarango, the No. 6
seed, broke Washington to go up 5-4 and
served out the set. His forehand
groundstrokes were finding their marks.
But after the Cardinal sophomore sal
vaged a break in the second set to come
within 4-4, it was Washington — the
Wolverines' No. 3 singles player — who
was the aggressor when the match was
on the line.
"I should have taken the offensive
more," Tarango said. "He went for his
shots on the big points. He played better
than I did today."
McEnroe, playing in his last amateur
tournament before he turns professional
this.summer, bowed to Louisiana State's
Donny Leaycraft 6-4, 6-1. Like Tarango,

McEnroe lost in the opening round.
The contest was deadlocked at 3-3 in
the first set, but Leaycraft won nine of
the last 11 games to close out the match.
Leaycraft is LSU's No. 4 singles player.
"I lost a little confidence the last couple
of days," said McEnroe, who lost to USC's
Byron Black and LSU's Felix Barrientos
in the team competition. "For some rea
son I haven't had the same fight in me
1 normally have."
"It's tough to go out not playing as
well as I know I can."
Blackman upset Texas Christian's
Clinton Banducci 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 in the first
round, but lost to UC-Irvine's Mark
Kaplan 6-4, 6-1 in the second round.
Against Banducci, the Stanford fresh
man was able to start slowly and fight
his way back into the match. Blackman
began serving and volleying well and wore
down TCU's No. 1 player.
But after starting slowly again against
Kaplan, Irvine's No. 1 player who reached
the NCAA singles semifinals last year,
Blackman couldn't bounce back a second
time.

'[Not playing up to par] is a natural combination
of being physically tired and emotionally drained
from the team title.'
— Stanford Coach Dick Gould

At 4-5 in the first set with Kaplan
serving, Blackman fought to a 3-3 sudden
death point. But Kaplan aced Blackman
on a second serve to end the set.
In the second set, Kaplan really got
into gear. His return of serve and his
own kick serve to Blackman's backhand
proved too much for Blackman.
Wheaton was the final Cardinal to go
down, though he led the tiebreaker 5-2
before rain forced play inside. But for
the rest of the match, Wheaton looked
sluggish, giving up the tiebreaker and
not winning a game in the second set.
"David wasn't serving well and Nagel
played a great match," Gould said. "I

knew it would be really hard for David
to lose the first set and come back."
Card notes
Five of the singles tournament's top eight
seeds were eliminated yesterday. USC's Scott

Cannon, seeded fourth, bowed to Greenan
7-6, 6-7, 7-6, and No. 6 Tarango made his
