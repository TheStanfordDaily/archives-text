# NCAA Northeast Regional
## Card nine relives high school 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
NEW BRITAIN, Conn. - A
sign above the entrance to New
Britain High School reads,
"Through these doors walk the
finest teachers."
Yesterday, the doors of the
school also opened to some of

the finest collegiate baseball players in the
nation.
With the NCAA Northeast Regional sched

uled to begin today, the six teams in the
tournament were supposed to practice at
Beehive Field, the regional site, yesterday.
But a steady rain here forced Stanford and
two other teams to practice in the New Britain
High gymnasium.
The Cardinal stretched out in the gym foyer
— near the school's cluttered trophy case and
underneath student body election posters —
then took hitting practice in a batting cage
in the gym. The pitchers, meanwhile, ran laps
in the school's hallways.
For freshman pitcher Mike Mussina (9-2,

4.34 ERA), who is scheduled to make his first
postseason start today when the Cardinal
plays St. John's at 11:30 a.m. PDT, practicing
inside was just like old times.
"This is nothing new," said Mussina, who
prepped at Montoursville High School in Mon
toursville, Pa. "The last two years (in high
school), we only got to practice outside about
four times before the season began in late
March or early April."
But as Mussina and his teammates worked
out indoors late yesterday afternoon, there
was some question as to whether they would
have a chance to play ball outdoors today.
It rained most of yesterday in New Britain,
and with weather forecasts calling for partial
clearing and scattered showers in the area
today, it will take a Herculean groundskeeping
effort to get the field ready for the scheduled
tournament opener between Clemson and
Fordham at 8:30 a.m. PDT.
However, because Beehive Field is or
dinarily a minor-league park, it has a profes
sional grounds crew that may be able to get
the field into playing condition.
"1 think we'll be able to play," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said. "It will take three
or four hours of work to get the field ready,
but I think we'll get a game in."
The left-handed Marquess threw batting
practice yesterday because St. John's is likely
to start a lefty of its own, freshman Thomas
Singer (3-3, 2.70).
The Redmen, though, are largely a mystery
for Stanford. "They're definitely an unknown
commodity," Marquess said.
St. John's, champion of the Big East Con
ference, enters the regional with a record of
28-19-1. Offensively, they are led by speedy
junior second baseman Walter "The Roadrun
ner" Heckel, who is batting .306 with 33
stolen bases in 41 attempts. Junior outfielder
Robert Lambraia comes in with a .353 average
and a team-leading eight home runs.
Mussina said he didn't expect postseason
play to be much different from the regular
season. "I think the competition we've faced
all year is at least as tough as anything we'll
run into here," he said. "There's no new
pressure — except that we have to win every
game from here on out. I don't think the
hitters are going to be any better than the
ones we faced during the regular season."
Card notes
Today's game and all subsequent regional games
involving Stanford will be broadcast live on KZSU,
90.1 FM, with the Scullyan John IMatz and the
Garagiolian Randy Chappcl providing play-by-play
and commentary.
The third opening-round game, pitting Kentucky
against Rutgers, is scheduled for 4 p.m. EDT to
morrow.
Several New Britain High School students poked
their heads into the gym during the Cardinal's
workout yesterday. "These cats 12th grade?" one
student asked. No, they're from Stanford Univer
sity, he was told. "Oh, I was going to say. .he
replied.
Twenty-three of the 29 players listed on the
Redmen roster are from the state of New York.
