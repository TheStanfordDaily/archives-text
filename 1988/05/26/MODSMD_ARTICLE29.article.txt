# The
						choice: see baseball or make tools
## 
### 
One of my old high school
buddies had a summer job in
specting smokestacks, and he
spent a good amount of time in
New Britain, Conn.

And if it keeps raining in the
Hardwnre City, the Stanford base
ball team might want to take their
own tour of the circular brick
spouts, because there just isn't
that much to do in New Britain.
Except watch baseball and make
tools.

A few years ago the Red Sox
moved their AA franchise from
Muzzy Field in Bristol to the
Beehive. It was a step up from a
top-10 worst city in the country
to live in to a top-30.
I grew up two towns over, and
we rarely traveled up Route 72
and across the Berlin Turnpike.
Actually, I think some of the
various types of drive-ins and
wholesale stereo stores we used
to frequent on the Pike may have
been in New Britain proper. The
Hardware City popped up on the
local news with stories of corrup
tion, and most recently fixed elec
tions. The umpires in the North
east Regional will surely hail from
elsewhere.
But there are good baseball fans
at the Beehive, and they won't
leave in the seventh inning. My
guess is they will be pulling for

the most local team, or the team
with the most Polish names.
Could be St. John's or Fordham.
No chance for Clemson or Ken
tucky — maybe Rutgers.
Stanford sports names like Rob
bins, Carey, Carey and Plemel.
Sounds like a hoity law firm, not
a group of foremen at the Stanley
Works factory.
It may rain today, but tomor
row it could be 85 degrees and
90 percent humidity, which is why
guys used to call Muzzy Field
muggy field. Then again, it'll
probably rain.

I know I've pounded this Car
dinal basketball stuff into the
ground, but here's one last pump.
Stop and think about the things
happening in the Stanford bas
ketball program. The women's
team played in the NCAA tour

nament, and with Coach Tara
VanDerveer stockpiling blue-chip
recruits, the Cardinal shall return
often.
The men's side has Olympics
coming out of its ears. Andrew
Vlahov is a good bet to be playing
for the Australian squad in Seoul.
Howard Wright was invited to the
trials to mix it up with guys like
Danny Manning and Carrier Rob
inson.
And of course Todd Lichti is in
the thick of the battle for the
final spots on the U.S. Olympic
team. All this has got to help
recruiting.
"The rap has always been that
if you come to Stanford, you can't
be a premier player. You have to
be something else," Cardinal
Coach Mike Montgomery said on
