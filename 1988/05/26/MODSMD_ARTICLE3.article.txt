# High retirement rate opens doors for new faculty
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
"If you look around, you'll
notice that the Stanford faculty
is aging."
This observation by English
Prof. Lawrence Ryan may seem
self-evident. But it takes on
deeper meaning when coupled
with the fact that over one-third
of the Humanities and Sciences
faculty faces retirement before
the year 2000, according to a
report presented by Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Norm Wes
sells to the Faculty Senate early
this month.

Humanities and Sciences is not
the only school facing the retire
ment crunch. According to Asst.
Provost Noel Kolak, 36 faculty
members from across the Univer
sity will retire at the end of this
year, including some who opt for
early retirement as well as some
required by the University to
retire at the age of 70.
The number of faculty opting
for early retirement this year is
"significantly larger" than those
being retired due to mandatory
retirement rules, Kolak said.
The University in fact encour
ages early retirement with a spe
cial plan for faculty who retire

between the ages of 62 and 70.
The plan offers an "interim re
tirement allowance" to give fac
ulty incentive to step down early.
Provost James Rosse said the
faculty turnover rate is indeed
going up, but he called the in

crease a "gradual" evolution.
"It's not like we are changing
into a pumpkin, " Rosse said.
The problem of aging faculty
has been a ticking timebomb since
the University's explosive growth
in the 1950s and 19605. Many

faculty were hired in those
decades to meet the growing de
mands of the inquisitive, college
age, baby-boom generation. These
demands, combined with then-
University President Wallace
Sterling's high-growth policies,
brought many young faculty to
Stanford.
As the average age of the United
States has grown, so has the
average age of the Stanford fac
ulty. It's a fact of life. People grow
old.
Still, the high number of
retirees worries many faculty.
Ryan said he was "disturbed,
but not surprised" by the high

retirement figures.
Ryan pointed to the lack of
junior faculty in his department
and added that "the University
should try to get more junior fac
ulty members."
"First of all, senior faculty are
more expensive," Ryan said.
"Hiring more senior faculty mem
bers keeps young blood out of the
University and inhibits the devel
opment of strong faculty leader
ship."
In fact, Wessells cited the lack
of junior faculty at the University
as a msyor problem.

correct exams.'
