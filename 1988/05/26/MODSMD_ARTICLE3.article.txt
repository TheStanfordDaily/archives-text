# High retirement rate opens doors for new faculty
## 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
"If you look around, you'll
notice that the Stanford faculty
is aging."
This observation by English
Prof. Lawrence Ryan may seem
self-evident. But it takes on
deeper meaning when coupled
with the fact that over one-third
of the Humanities and Sciences
faculty faces retirement before
the year 2000, according to a
report presented by Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Norm Wes
sells to the Faculty Senate early
this month.

Humanities and Sciences is not
the only school facing the retire
ment crunch. According to Asst.
Provost Noel Kolak, 36 faculty
members from across the Univer
sity will retire at the end of this
year, including some who opt for
early retirement as well as some
required by the University to
retire at the age of 70.
The number of faculty opting
for early retirement this year is
"significantly larger" than those
being retired due to mandatory
retirement rules, Kolak said.
The University in fact encour
ages early retirement with a spe
cial plan for faculty who retire

between the ages of 62 and 70.
The plan offers an "interim re
tirement allowance" to give fac
ulty incentive to step down early.
Provost James Rosse said the
faculty turnover rate is indeed
going up, but he called the in

crease a "gradual" evolution.
"It's not like we are changing
into a pumpkin, " Rosse said.
The problem of aging faculty
has been a ticking timebomb since
the University's explosive growth
in the 1950s and 19605. Many

faculty were hired in those
decades to meet the growing de
mands of the inquisitive, college
age, baby-boom generation. These
demands, combined with then-
University President Wallace
Sterling's high-growth policies,
brought many young faculty to
Stanford.
As the average age of the United
States has grown, so has the
average age of the Stanford fac
ulty. It's a fact of life. People grow
old.
Still, the high number of
retirees worries many faculty.
Ryan said he was "disturbed,
but not surprised" by the high

retirement figures.
Ryan pointed to the lack of
junior faculty in his department
and added that "the University
should try to get more junior fac
ulty members."
"First of all, senior faculty are
more expensive," Ryan said.
"Hiring more senior faculty mem
bers keeps young blood out of the
University and inhibits the devel
opment of strong faculty leader
ship."
In fact, Wessells cited the lack
of junior faculty at the University
as a msyor problem.


'I will also do everything but
correct exams.'

According to Wessells, the num
ber of junior faculty in the School
of Humanities and Sciences is
"distressingly small, especially in
comparison with our peer insti
tutions across the nation." By
"junior faculty," Wessells meant
untenured faculty.
Among peer institutions, Stan
ford has the lowest percentage of
junior faculty at 19.7 percent.
Yale has the highest number at
43.5 percent.
Both Rosse and Wessells said
the University's main thrust now
is hiring junior faculty.
"Hiring young professors is
good for teaching and good for
the health of University depart
ments," Wessells said.
"Every time there is an opening
we have the opportunity to lower
the average faculty age, and we
have the chance to hire a woman
or a minority," he added.
Civil Engineering Prof. James
Gere, who is retiring early this
year after 34 years here, said the
School of Engineering is hiring
"almost only" junior faculty now,
causing major changes in the
school.
"There is a new kind of en

gineer out there," Gere said. "We
are recruiting them, and they are
developing into the new leaders
of their departments."
Some new junior faculty have
raised concern in the administra
tion, however, because they are
unwilling to participate in the
Stanford Contributory Retire
ment Plan.
Most professors contribute a
percentage of their salaries to the
SCRP. When they retire, profes
sors draw money annually from
the plan in proportion to the
amount they contributed over the
years.
Clara Bush, academic secretary
to the University, said she was
"disturbed" that many junior fac
ulty are not contributing to the
fund. Bush speculated that "more
immediate economic pressures"
keep the junior faculty from con
sidering future finances.
Wessells called the lack of
junior faculty contributions "a
terrible problem threatening the

future of the University."
"Since it is such a bad problem,
I am confident that the University
will address it," Wessells added.
Today's junior faculty members
will never be subject to mandatory
retirement, though, because the
requirement will be repealed in
1994.
A few years ago, in the last
revision to the U.S. Retire
ment Code, the federal govern
ment eliminated mandatory re
tirement for tenured professors
across the nation, effective 1994.
Retiring faculty members do
not fade away as old soldiers do.
Some retiring professors will
teach in the University's new
"continuing studies" program,
Rosse said, and many have other
plans.
Gere plans to begin work on
two general engineering
textbooks. He has already signed
contracts for the textbooks with
McGraw-Hill Publishing Co.
Wessells, who will retire at the
end of this year, will move on to
serve as provost at the University
of Oregon.
Ryan said he will "continue to
do research."
Ryan concluded, saying, "I will
also do everything except correct
exams, give lectures and sit on
department committees."
