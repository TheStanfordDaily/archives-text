# Figley pars at NCAA tourney
## Cornelius struggles to a 78 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
Sometimes they
just don't want
to fall.
Such was the
case with the
putts of Stan
ford freshman

golfer Jodi Figley yesterday. Al
though she hit all 18 greens in
regulation, she managed only
an even-par 74, and sits tied
for 14th place in the NCAA
Women's Golf Championships
at the 6,084-yard New Mexico
State University Golf Course
in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
"She (Figley) shot beautiful
golf," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said, "but ran several
putts over the edge (of the cup).
Hopefully Jodi can hang on to
her very solid play of late."
Senior Kay Cornelius, the
other member of the Cardinal
contingent, was the victim of
two delays in play due to
lightning and bogeyed the final
three holes en route to a dis
appointing 4-over-par 78. "I
thought they never should
have let us back out (after the
first delay) with the wind so
high," she said.
When the players returned
after the first delay, winds were
upwards of 50 miles per hour,
according to her.
"1 fully expect her (Cor
nelius) to move up rapidly,

starting tomorrow," Baldwin
said.
Cornelius is 10 shots off the
lead pace set by Eva Dahloff
of Oklahoma State, who played
the course early in the morn
ing, before the winds and
delays came. Her 68 places her
two shots ahead of New
Mexico's Michelle Wooding and
Tracy Wright of Troy State.
Behind Wright and Wooding
are four players, all at 71: Sue
Ginter of Texas, Kentucky's
Kate Rogerson, Jacquie Vigil
of host New Mexico State and
Lana Perhacs of UCLA.
Led by DahlofTs six-under
par taming of the course, Okla
homa State leads the team
competition by six strokes at
'291. Tied for second at 297 are
San Jose State and Kentucky,
with New Mexico State another
two strokes back.
New Mexico is in fifth at an
even 300, with Duke (301),
Georgia (302) and UCLA (302)
all close behind.
The course, situated near the
base of the Rocky Mountains
at an elevation of 3,500 feet,
is subject to high winds which
build up as the day goes on.
Thus, according to Baldwin,
teams and players which are
in the lead and tee off later
will be subject to these winds
over more of their round than
those who tee off earlier. So,
much see-sawing in the stand
ings will be expected through
out the tourney.
