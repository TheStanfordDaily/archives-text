Cycling
They made it in the big leagues.
In the first-ever National Col
legiate Road Championships, held
May 21-22 at Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, the Stanford cycling team
finished seventh out of 24 teams
and 12 individuals. The Cardinal
team of eight cyclists competed
successfully in three races — a
road race, a team time trial and
a criterium — over the two days.
In Saturday's blistering 100-
degree weather, graduate student
Brock LaPorte was Stanford's
only men's finisher, coming in
just out of the points. Graduate
student Kaye Wagner scorched
the high-caliber women's field

with a fourth-place showing,
while freshman Ellen Austin
scored points with a tenacious
16th-place finish.
Sunday morning dawned cool
but windy for the 10-mile team
time trial. The Cardinal's men's
team, which was composed of
LaPorte, senior Dave Louden,
freshman Coulter Richardson,
senior Robert Borchers and junior
Steve Miller, scored 13th despite
a freak two-tire blowout on Mil
ler's bicycle. Stanford's women's
team of Wagner and Austin put
in a supreme effort and flew to
a third-place finish.
The cyclists had only a few
hours to recover before Saturday
afternoon's criteriums. The Car

dinal men competed well in the
preliminary qualifying heat.
LaPorte placed sixth and scored
well in several primes while Miller
took 10th despite a back which is
still healing from a previous cy
cling injury. Richardson also cap
tured a few prime points. In the
final criterium, LaPorte sped to
second place and Richardson and
Miller finished with points in the
top 20.
In the women's race, the field
split up immediately and all of
the riders save the top seven were
quickly lapped. Wagner managed
to score with a 16th-place finish.
The Cardinal came in seventh
out of a total of 36 teams from
across the country.

Running
The Stanford running club
overcame searing heat to domi
nate last weekend's Palo Alto
Recreational 5K and 10K road
race.
David Mitzi coasted to an un
challenged first place in the 10K
with a winning time of 32:47. Dan
Fernandez took second with 34:07
and Chip Bartlett followed
through with a strong sixth-place
finish.
In the SK, Andrew Pearson
took third overall with a time of
16:42, which placed him second
in his age division.
