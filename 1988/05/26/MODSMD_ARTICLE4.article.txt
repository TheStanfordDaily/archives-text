# USW urges student scrutiny of negotiations
## 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
Amid charges of chronic dis
crimination and unfair bargaining
practices, Stanford union negoti
ators have requested that bar
gaining sessions be opened to
public scrutiny, a proposal that
has drawn support from numer
ous student organizations includ
ing the Council of Presidents.
COP member Stacey Leyton
said the ASSU Senate will con
sider a resolution tonight request
ing that the University and the

United Stanford Workers open
their bargaining sessions to
neutral student observers. The
move by the ASSU followed a visit
from union officials who decided
this week to call for open bargain
ing as a possible solution to prob
lems with the University's past
record in negotiating labor con
tracts.
Leyton, who became involved
with the union as a member of
the student-labor support com
mittee, said the resolution will re
quest that students be allowed to
observe the negotiations because

they are of concern to the com

versity and the union often try
to persuade students to support
their side. Under current closed
bargaining, students have no way
of knowing the truth about nego
tiations, she said.
In the past, union officials have
approached the ASSU for support
in dealing with the University,

dismissed worker Long On

said she has also received support

from the Black Student Union,
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford, the Asian American
Student Association, Students
United for a Democratic Educa
tion, the Women's Center and
MEChA, a Chicano student or
ganization.
Crouse claims that open nego
tiations would protect the union
from University negotiators,
whom Crouse accuses of denying
truths and distorting facts in past
bargaining.
University spokesman Mike
Vartain says contract discussions

should take place in closed session
and that the University will con
tinue the practice of holding
closed bargaining sessions until it
hears directly from the union.
Both the University and the un
ion would have to agree to an
ASSU Senate resolution in order
for the proposal to take effect.
Negotiations over a new contract
to replace the current one —
which expires August 31, 1988 —
are expected to be held this sum
