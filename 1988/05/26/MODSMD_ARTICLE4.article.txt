# USW urges student scrutiny of negotiations
## 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
Amid charges of chronic dis
crimination and unfair bargaining
practices, Stanford union negoti
ators have requested that bar
gaining sessions be opened to
public scrutiny, a proposal that
has drawn support from numer
ous student organizations includ
ing the Council of Presidents.
COP member Stacey Leyton
said the ASSU Senate will con
sider a resolution tonight request
ing that the University and the

United Stanford Workers open
their bargaining sessions to
neutral student observers. The
move by the ASSU followed a visit
from union officials who decided
this week to call for open bargain
ing as a possible solution to prob
lems with the University's past
record in negotiating labor con
tracts.
Leyton, who became involved
with the union as a member of
the student-labor support com
mittee, said the resolution will re
quest that students be allowed to
observe the negotiations because

they are of concern to the com
munity and because both the Uni
versity and the union often try
to persuade students to support
their side. Under current closed
bargaining, students have no way
of knowing the truth about nego
tiations, she said.
In the past, union officials have
approached the ASSU for support
in dealing with the University,
most recently in the April case of
dismissed worker Long On
the issue of open negotiations, un
ion Chief Steward Linda Grouse
said she has also received support

from the Black Student Union,
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford, the Asian American
Student Association, Students
United for a Democratic Educa
tion, the Women's Center and
MEChA, a Chicano student or
ganization.
Crouse claims that open nego
tiations would protect the union
from University negotiators,
whom Crouse accuses of denying
truths and distorting facts in past
bargaining.
University spokesman Mike
Vartain says contract discussions

should take place in closed session
and that the University will con
tinue the practice of holding
closed bargaining sessions until it
hears directly from the union.
Both the University and the un
ion would have to agree to an
ASSU Senate resolution in order
for the proposal to take effect.
Negotiations over a new contract
to replace the current one —
which expires August 31, 1988 —
are expected to be held this sum
mer, but the union has not yet
contacted the University on the
subject.
"We have nothing to hide, we
don't want secrecy in negotia
tions," Crouse said. "We feel that
the community, which is so af
fected by the negotiations, has a
right to see what is going on."
"We feel that [open
negotiations] will protect us," she
added. "What happens during ne
gotiations when they're closed is
that we say one thing and (Uni

versity negotiator Priscilla)
Wheeler says another. In 1985,
she proposed things which would
have seriously hurt our job secu
rity, and then she denied it and
said it was not true."
Wheeler was unavailable for
comment and deferred a response
to Vartain, who said the charges
raised against Wheeler are about
issues that have already been re
solved. He said the complaints ad
dress provisions of an agreement
signed by union leaders and
ratified by the union membership.
Moreover, Vartain said that the
proper forum for the union to

raise complaints would be within
the framework of collective bar
gaining.
"I will be happy to respond in
the first instance directly to the
union about negotiations, includ
ing a response about how those
negotiations should be con
ducted," Vartain said. "It is cor
rect that in the past the Univer
sity and the union have conducted
negotiations in the normal
framework, which is not as a
media event, but as a serious and
diligent discussion attended exclu
sively by the two parties who are
parties to the agreement."
