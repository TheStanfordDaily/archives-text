# Kappas offend Native Americans
## Sorority 'Cowboy and Indian' party held outside SAIO offices 
### Nick Anderson Editorial staff 
Just outside the Native Amer
ican Center, about 50 members
of the Kappa Kappa Gamma
sorority danced and sang in "Wild
West" Indian fashion last night
for a half hour at the Old Union
fountain, angering representa
tives of the Stanford American
Indian Organization.
Senior William Thompson,
sophomores Tracey Leßeau and
Todd Michael and freshman
Cassie Nordstrand — all members
of SAIO — observed the Kappas
dance in a circle and cry out what
they termed "Hollywood war
whoops." The dance, which took
place from 8:30 p.m. to 9 p.m.,
previewed a party held later that
night at the Phi Delta Theta
house.

Thompson said he approached
a Kappa member who wore a
mock headband and feather and
asked why the sorority chose the
"Cowboy and Indian" theme. He
said he was told that the theme
"goes with 'Kappas.' "
Contacted at the Phi Delt house
later yesterday evening, Kappa
President Laura Lewis, a junior,
said the group "certainly didn't
mean to ofTend" the Native Amer
icans. "We have a lot of respect
for them," she said. "Definitely
we apologize." Lewis said there
were no war whoops at the dance.
The Kappas hold weekly meet
ings in the Old Union Clubhouse
nearby. Lewis said it had not oc
curred to the sorority that the
theme for the party, which was
planned by the Kappa pledges,
might demean Native Americans.

missed the apolop'. "I'm ex
asperated," she said. "It seems
like they never learn."
Thompson agreed. "They al
ways plead ignorance," he said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons issued a strong statement
yesterday criticizing ignorance of
cultural insensitivity. "Members
of the Stanford community must
know that conduct which seeks
to or has the effect of discouraging
the full participation in the life
of this University by any student
on account of ... ethnic origin is
in violation of University principle
and policy. Such conduct cannot
and will not be tolerated."
