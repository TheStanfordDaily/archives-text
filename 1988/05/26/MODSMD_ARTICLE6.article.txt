# Greenhouse effect spurs heated debate
## 
### Ingrid Wickelgren Science editor 
If you have had trouble
predicting the weather from
one day to the next this spring,
just imagine how difficult it is
to forecast hundreds of years
into the future. Scientists and
evironmentalists cannot even
agree on the basics: is the earth
getting warmer or colder?
The majority of scientists
hold the opinion that high
levels of carbon dioxide and
other "greenhouse gases" are
warming the earth, but a small
minority believe carbon dioxide
works in other ways to cool the
earth and that the cooling ef

fects are dominating.
Fossil fuel use, such as the
burning of petroleum and coal,
adds some 5.4 billion tons of
carbon to the atmosphere an
nually, while deforestation
adds another 1 to 2.6 billion
tons. These processes are the
contributors to rising
carbon dioxide levels, according
to Ivester Brown and Christo
pher Flavin in "State of the
World 1988."
Other greenhouse gases —
chlorofluorocarbons, methane
and nitrous oxide — in addition
to carbon dioxide, warm the
earth by improving the ability
of the atmosphere to radiate heat
back to the earth.
The improved radiation ability
of the atmosphere will return to
the surface of the earth, warmed
by the sun, some of the heat the
surface has lost through its own
radiation.
Water vapor, the most efficient
radiator of all the gases in the
air, amplifies the warming effect
of carbon dioxide.

When carbon dioxide warms the
atmosphere, larger quantities of
water evaporate from the oceans,
further increasing the radiation
capacity of the earth's atmos
phere.
But increased water vapor also
may increase cloud cover. These
clouds, which travel from the
equator to the polar regions, could
work to cool the earth in two
ways. First, the clouds deflect
some of the the sun's rays which

would otherwise melt the snow
on the ice cap.
Second, water vapor fails as
snow in the polar regions, and
more snow also produces more
cold.
The latter hypothesis, first de
veloped in the 1930s by British
meteorologist Sir George Simp
son, explains how increasing
levels of carbon dioxicde could
cause "differential global warm
ing," making it hotter around the
equator, but colder in the polar
regions.
A small international network
of scientists and activists inspired
by ecologist John Hamaker place
great faith in the differential
global warming theory, but it is
far from clear whether Simpson's
logic is accurate.
The more widely accepted the
ory, overall global warming, is
supported by computer models of
the earth's climate, according to
Michael McElroy, Chairman of
Earth and Planetary Sciences at
Harvard.
The models are imperfect, how
ever, and do not fully account for
the effects of cloud cover, oceanic
heat transfer and regional rain
fall, according to Patrick Michaels
in a June, 1986 article in The
Washington Post.
If the earth were to become
much cooler or warmer, all life
on the planet would be dramati
cally affected.
"Human civilization has
evolved within a narrow range of
climate conditions. Any major
departure from those conditions

will cause enormous hardship and
require incalculable investments
during the adjustment," Brown
and Flavin wrote.
Global warming is likely to
change rainfall patterns, prevail
ing winds and ocean currents. The
most significant effect would be
rising oceans due to melting of
the ice cap.
Projections of the U.S. Envi
ronmental Protection Agency
show a rise in sea level by the
22nd century of between 1.4 and
2.2 meters. Before the end of the
next century, large fractions of
states such as Louisiana and
Florida could be under water, ac
cording to Brian Toon, Associate
Fellow at the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration Re
search Center.
Proponents of differential
global warming point to expand
ing glaciers, droughts in Africa
and South America and increas
ingly harsh Northern winters as
proof of this theory.
Although there may be a few
isolated cases of expanding
glaciers, the bulk of them are in
retreat, according to Toon. Fur
ther, the droughts in the South
ern Hemisphere are more likely
due to cyclical rainfall patterns,
and are not an indication of a
trend toward more drought.
In addition, climate models and
preliminary scientific measure
ments suggest that the elevated
level of carbon dioxide produced
by the industrial revolution have
already raised the earth's average
tempeature by about a half-degree

Celsius.
"Even without any additional
carbon dioxide buildup, scientists
believe that these changes ensure
another 1-degree increase during
the next few decades — enough
to make the earth far warmer
than at any time since civilization
began," Brown and Flavin wrote.
"All the data I've looked at sug
gest there's a warming," McElroy
said, referring to the cooling the
ory as "exceedingly speculative."
Toon described differential global
warming as more of a "religious
doctrine" than a developed scien
tific theory.
In addition to clouds, water
vapor carries with it a lot of heat
energy, which increases the tem
perature in the polar regions. A
doubling of atmospheric carbon
dioxide will raise the temperature
at the equator about two degrees
Celsius and that at the poles
about five degrees, according to
Toon.
According to the most advanced
global models, at current levels of
carbon dioxide release the global
temperature will increase by be
tween 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius
by between 2030 and 2050.
In addition, historical evidence
suggests that levels of carbon
dioxide increase with very warm
climates and decrease during an
ice age, Toon said.
If one were to take all of the
coal and petroleum out of the
ground and burn it, there would
be about 10 times the present
level of carbon dioxide in the
earth's atmosphere, similar to the

situation 65 million years ago. At
this time there were no ice sheets
and the earth was much warmer
than it is now, according to Toon.
Twenty thousand years ago,
most of the earth's high latitudes
were covered in ice. Chicago was
covered in a mile of ice and the
Rockies supported a vast series of
glaciers. The carbon dioxide levels
were much lower during the ad
vanced stage of the ice age than
they are today, Toon said.
But others dispute the overall
warming trend. "The Northern
latitudes, from 24 through 90
degrees, have actually cooled off
since 1930," reports Michaels,
deriving his data from tempera
ture curves of the National Re
search Council's 1983 report,
"Changing Climate."
"No graphic in the report indi
cates significant warming of the
northern latitudes of our hemi
sphere since 1930," Michaels
wrote. "Meanwhile, the Southern
hemisphere has been much with
the program, warming up in a
fashion that no one doubts."
Different interpretations of the
same data, lack of concrete
evidence and historical reasons
may explain the cdntroversy.
One scientist, Irving Kaplan,
president of the San Diego-based
International Institute for In
tegrative Technology, attaches
very little significance to small
warming trends such as a .6 to
.8 degree warming since 1900,
data from a study in the April 28
issue of Nature journal.
Kaplan believes that the 40 per

cent increase in carbon dioxide
since industrialization should
have produced a much stronger
warming trend if carbon dioxide
is in fact responsible for the
warming.
Because there is not a great
deal of concrete scientific evidence
to support either the warming or
cooling theory, it is not surprising
there are people supporting each.
Until 1977, the cooling theory
was the "established climatologi
cal viewpoint," according to
Kaplan. In 1977, the federal gov
ernment decided that the earth
was warming and told clima
tologists to keep their cooling the
ory "low profile," Kaplan said.
The Department of Energy then
proceeded to pump millions of dol
lars into warming research,
Kaplan said.
Toon said that the climate
warmed between 1900 and 1940,
but then cooled for a few decades.
From 1970 to the present, there
has been a clear warming trend.
Kaplan believes that because
carbon dioxide works both to cool
and warm the earth, its net effect
on global temperature is zero.
Kaplan believed the earth is
cooling, but not because of carbon
dioxide.
"We've had ice ages for 2.4 mil
lion years, and all of these have
occurred without high levels of
carbon dioxide," Kaplan said.
"The amount of carbon dioxide
doesn't have much to do with
whether it cools or it warms."

dioxide will raise the temperature
at the equator about two degrees
Celsius and that at the poles
about five degrees, according to
Toon.
According to the most advanced
global models, at current levels of
carbon dioxide release the global
temperature will increase by be
tween 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius
by between 2030 and 2050.
In addition, historical evidence
suggests that levels of carbon
dioxide increase with very warm
climates and decrease during an
ice age, Toon said.
If one were to take all of the
coal and petroleum out of the
ground and burn it, there would
be about 10 times the present
level of carbon dioxide in the
earth's atmosphere, similar to the

situation 65 million years ago. At
this time there were no ice sheets
and the earth was much warmer
than it is now, according to Toon.
Twenty thousand years ago,
most of the earth's high latitudes
were covered in ice. Chicago was
covered in a mile of ice and the
Rockies supported a vast series of
glaciers. The carbon dioxide levels
were much lower during the ad
vanced stage of the ice age than
they are today, Toon said.
But others dispute the overall
warming trend. "The Northern
latitudes, from 24 through 90
degrees, have actually cooled off
since 1930," reports Michaels,
deriving his data from tempera
ture curves of the National Re
search Council's 1983 report,
"Changing Climate."
"No graphic in the report indi
cates significant warming of the
northern latitudes of our hemi
sphere since 1930," Michaels
wrote. "Meanwhile, the Southern
hemisphere has been much with
the program, warming up in a
fashion that no one doubts."
Different interpretations of the
same data, lack of concrete
evidence and historical reasons
may explain the cdntroversy.
One scientist, Irving Kaplan,
president of the San Diego-based
International Institute for In
tegrative Technology, attaches
very little significance to small
warming trends such as a .6 to
.8 degree warming since 1900,
data from a study in the April 28
issue of Nature journal.
Kaplan believes that the 40 per

cent increase in carbon dioxide
since industrialization should
have produced a much stronger
warming trend if carbon dioxide
is in fact responsible for the
warming.
Because there is not a great
deal of concrete scientific evidence
to support either the warming or
cooling theory, it is not surprising
there are people supporting each.
Until 1977, the cooling theory
was the "established climatologi
cal viewpoint," according to
Kaplan. In 1977, the federal gov
ernment decided that the earth
was warming and told clima
tologists to keep their cooling the
ory "low profile," Kaplan said.
The Department of Energy then
proceeded to pump millions of dol
lars into warming research,
Kaplan said.
Toon said that the climate
warmed between 1900 and 1940,
but then cooled for a few decades.
From 1970 to the present, there
has been a clear warming trend.
Kaplan believes that because
carbon dioxide works both to cool
and warm the earth, its net effect
on global temperature is zero.
Kaplan believed the earth is
cooling, but not because of carbon
dioxide.
"We've had ice ages for 2.4 mil
lion years, and all of these have
occurred without high levels of
carbon dioxide," Kaplan said.
"The amount of carbon dioxide
doesn't have much to do with
whether it cools or it warms."

If you have had trouble
predicting the weather from
one day to the next this spring,
just imagine how difficult it is
to forecast hundreds of years
into the future. Scientists and
evironmentalists cannot even
agree on the basics: is the earth
getting warmer or colder?
The majority of scientists
hold the opinion that high
levels of carbon dioxide and
other "greenhouse gases" are
warming the earth, but a small
minority believe carbon dioxide
works in other ways to cool the
earth and that the cooling ef

fects are dominating.
Fossil fuel use, such as the
burning of petroleum and coal,
adds some 5.4 billion tons of
carbon to the atmosphere an
nually, while deforestation
adds another 1 to 2.6 billion
tons. These processes are the
contributors to rising
carbon dioxide levels, according
to Ivester Brown and Christo
pher Flavin in "State of the
World 1988."
Other greenhouse gases —
chlorofluorocarbons, methane
and nitrous oxide — in addition
to carbon dioxide, warm the
earth by improving the ability
of the atmosphere to radiate heat
back to the earth.
The improved radiation ability
of the atmosphere will return to
the surface of the earth, warmed
by the sun, some of the heat the
surface has lost through its own
radiation.
Water vapor, the most efficient
radiator of all the gases in the
air, amplifies the warming effect
of carbon dioxide.

When carbon dioxide warms the
atmosphere, larger quantities of
water evaporate from the oceans,
further increasing the radiation
capacity of the earth's atmos
phere.
But increased water vapor also
may increase cloud cover. These
clouds, which travel from the
equator to the polar regions, could
work to cool the earth in two
ways. First, the clouds deflect
some of the the sun's rays which

would otherwise melt the snow
on the ice cap.
Second, water vapor fails as
snow in the polar regions, and
more snow also produces more
cold.
The latter hypothesis, first de
veloped in the 1930s by British
meteorologist Sir George Simp
son, explains how increasing
levels of carbon dioxicde could
cause "differential global warm
ing," making it hotter around the
equator, but colder in the polar
regions.
A small international network
of scientists and activists inspired
by ecologist John Hamaker place
great faith in the differential
global warming theory, but it is
far from clear whether Simpson's
logic is accurate.
The more widely accepted the
ory, overall global warming, is
supported by computer models of
the earth's climate, according to
Michael McElroy, Chairman of
Earth and Planetary Sciences at
Harvard.
The models are imperfect, how
ever, and do not fully account for
the effects of cloud cover, oceanic
heat transfer and regional rain
fall, according to Patrick Michaels
in a June, 1986 article in The
Washington Post.
If the earth were to become
much cooler or warmer, all life
on the planet would be dramati
cally affected.
"Human civilization has
evolved within a narrow range of
climate conditions. Any major
departure from those conditions

will cause enormous hardship and
require incalculable investments
during the adjustment," Brown
and Flavin wrote.
Global warming is likely to
change rainfall patterns, prevail
ing winds and ocean currents. The
most significant effect would be
rising oceans due to melting of
the ice cap.
Projections of the U.S. Envi
ronmental Protection Agency
show a rise in sea level by the
22nd century of between 1.4 and
2.2 meters. Before the end of the
next century, large fractions of
states such as Louisiana and
Florida could be under water, ac
cording to Brian Toon, Associate
Fellow at the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration Re
search Center.
Proponents of differential
global warming point to expand
ing glaciers, droughts in Africa
and South America and increas
ingly harsh Northern winters as
proof of this theory.
Although there may be a few
isolated cases of expanding
glaciers, the bulk of them are in
retreat, according to Toon. Fur
ther, the droughts in the South
ern Hemisphere are more likely
due to cyclical rainfall patterns,
and are not an indication of a
trend toward more drought.
In addition, climate models and
preliminary scientific measure
ments suggest that the elevated
level of carbon dioxide produced
by the industrial revolution have
already raised the earth's average
tempeature by about a half-degree

Celsius.
"Even without any additional
carbon dioxide buildup, scientists
believe that these changes ensure
another 1-degree increase during
the next few decades — enough
to make the earth far warmer
than at any time since civilization
began," Brown and Flavin wrote.
"All the data I've looked at sug
gest there's a warming," McElroy
said, referring to the cooling the
ory as "exceedingly speculative."
Toon described differential global
warming as more of a "religious
doctrine" than a developed scien
tific theory.
In addition to clouds, water
vapor carries with it a lot of heat
energy, which increases the tem
perature in the polar regions. A
