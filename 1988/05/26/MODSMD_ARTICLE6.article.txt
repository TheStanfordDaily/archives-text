If you have had trouble
predicting the weather from
one day to the next this spring,
just imagine how difficult it is
to forecast hundreds of years
into the future. Scientists and
evironmentalists cannot even
agree on the basics: is the earth
getting warmer or colder?
The majority of scientists
hold the opinion that high
levels of carbon dioxide and
other "greenhouse gases" are
warming the earth, but a small
minority believe carbon dioxide
works in other ways to cool the
earth and that the cooling ef

fects are dominating.
Fossil fuel use, such as the
burning of petroleum and coal,
adds some 5.4 billion tons of
carbon to the atmosphere an
nually, while deforestation
adds another 1 to 2.6 billion
tons. These processes are the
contributors to rising
carbon dioxide levels, according
to Ivester Brown and Christo
pher Flavin in "State of the
World 1988."
Other greenhouse gases —
chlorofluorocarbons, methane
and nitrous oxide — in addition
to carbon dioxide, warm the
earth by improving the ability
