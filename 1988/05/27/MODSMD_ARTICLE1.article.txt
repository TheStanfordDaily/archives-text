John Cuerva - Daily
On the edge of his seat
Sailing TA Dave Smolen, erstwhile former ASSU Senate chair, hikes himself over the side of his boat to avoid
tipping over into Lake Lagunita yesterday. Sailors who do this on the lake often find themselves with a wet
bottom when the erratic winds decide to blow in a different direction. Lag will be open for recreational sailing
and windsurfing until Wednesday.
