## Ninety students and 9 staff will tour Japan, Singapore and Korea 
### Dennis Lee 
The Stanford Symphony Or
chestra will take its first-ever
international tour this summer
in a Far East swing through
Kyoto, Japan; Singapore; and
Seoul, Korea.
Ninety students and nine
staff members will participate
in the two-week tour from June
15 to July 3, which was de
scribed as "one of the largest
student organizational efforts in
the last decade or so at Stan
ford" by Andor Toth, the sym
phony's principal conductor and
music director.
At Kyoto the orchestra will
rehearse with the Kyoto Uni
versity Orchestra and Choir, fol
lowed by performances at the
university and at Nagaokayko
Memorial Hall. University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy specifi
cally requested that the or
chestra play at Kyoto, instead
of Tokyo, because of the Stan
ford campus established there
last year.
The orchestra will then go to
Singapore, where the group will

perform at the International
Festival of the Arts held there
annually. An active Stanford
alumni club there encouraged
the orchestra to come.
At the final stop in Seoul, the
group will play for Yonsei Uni
versity and the Korean Science
and Engineering Foundation at
Chungnam.
The trip will cost $164,000.
The orchestra itself has raised
all but about $20,000 through
a variety of fund-raisers. The
Centennial Committee, the
School of Humanities and
Sciences and President Ken
nedy's office all donated money.
Also, the orchestra has raised
over $20,000 from outside
performances, and orchestra
members have personally con
tributed about $42,000.
The orchestra plans to
produce the remaining cost
through a concert June 10 in
Memorial Auditorium with Stan
Getz, the famous tenor sax art
ist.
Toth said preparation for the
tour "has brought the group to

gether through the existence of
a common goal."
Sophomore Heather Hinds, a
violinist in the orchestra, said,
"We're all pretty excited. .. . Be
cause of the planning involved,
people have gotten to know each
other much better."
Paul Nghiem, chair of the
symphony, said the objectives
of the tour are "to build the
orchestra's self-image and ex
ternal image through taking on
an immense challenge. Rising
to that challenge will build
friendships and organizational
structure that will last for a long
time."
Nghiem, a second-year medi
cal student, continued, "We've
tried to maximize interactions
between people in the coun
tries." He noted that musicians
from the other countries will
perform with the orchestra.
"People in the community are
inviting us to stay at their
homes, which would help in
crease cultural exchange," he
said. Members of the orchestra
will also spend time sightseeing
with people in Kyoto, Singapore
and Seoul.
