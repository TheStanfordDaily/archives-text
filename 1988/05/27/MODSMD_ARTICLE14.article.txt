Noriega vows to ride out storm
PANAMA CITY, Panama — Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, appearing before Panama's
legislature to explain talks with the United
States, indicated yesterday he has no intention
of stepping down as military commander while
the country remains in turmoil.
Responding to a legislator's question about
his possible resignation as commander of the
Panama Defense Forces, Noriega said, "No
commander abandons ship during a storm."
The audience, packed with his supporters,
cheered and chanted slogans demanding that
he remain in power.
During a rambling, one-hour speech and a
question-and-answer session that followed,
Noriega repeatedly accused U.S. presidential
candidates of using the issue of his departure
from power to further their political ambitions.
Noriega charged that the U.S. government
was seeking to protect the campaign of Vice
President Bush and hinted that it could be
damaged by the Panama issue. But he made
no mention of any specific information detri
mental to Bush.
Noriega later referred to Bush and Demo
cratic Party candidate Michael Dukakis by
name, asserting that Panama's internal mat
ters were none of their business.
The general avoided discussion of why talks
with the United States broke down Wednesday,
but repeated demands for the lifting of U.S.
economic sanctions, the withdrawal of "exces
sive" reinforcements of U.S. troops stationed
here and the recognition by the United States
of the president he installed in February.
Syria signs pact with Hezbollah
DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria has reached
agreement with an Iranian-backed militia
group in Lebanon to end the recurrent fighting
in Beirut's southern suburbs and impose a
Syrian security plan in the beleaguered area,
a high-ranking Syrian official announced yes
terday.
The announcement significantly buoyed
hopes for the freedom of the 16 foreign
hostages, including nine Americans, who are
believed to be held by Moslem fundamentalists
in the slums south of Beirut.
The Syrian official, who asked that he not
be further identified, told reporters that the
agreement was reached between Syrian Pres
ident Hafez Assad and leaders of the pro-
Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in an
unprecedented meeting Wednesday in the
northern Syrian port of Latakia.
He would not disclose the details of the
accord but said that it provided for a halt to
all fighting in the southern suburbs yesterday
and implementation of the security arrange
ments today.
Beirut's southern suburbs encompass 14
square miles that have been the scene of fierce
fighting for the last two weeks between Hez
bollah fundamentalists and the more moderate
militia group called Amal. Both groups are
made up of Shia Moslems. The Amal has been
supported by Syria and the Hezbollah by Iran.
The Syrian official said that the agreement
had been approved by all parties in Lebanon.
When asked about Iran's consent, he said, "It
is very well known that Hezbollah's support
comes from Iran."
2 S. African policemen to hang
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Two
white South African policemen were sentenced
yesterday to hang for the murder of a black
youth in an eastern Cape Province township
after beating him so severely during interroga
tion that they concluded they could not let
him go without risking disciplinary action.
If the executions are carried out, the two
policemen would be the first to be hanged in
South Africa for killing a black while on duty
in a black township.
The sentences were handed down in a
provincial Supreme Court in Grahamstown,
east of the Indian Ocean city of Port Elizabeth,
as liberal white South Africans mounted a
nationwide campaign against capital punish
ment.
The campaign has hinged largely on the
scheduled executions of the "Sharpeville Six,"
five black men and a black woman sentenced
to death for the murder of a black township
councilman in 1984. Their executions were
stayed on a technicality in March only hours
before they were to have been hanged.
