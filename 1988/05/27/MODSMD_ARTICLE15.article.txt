# Soviet leaders propose sweeping reforms
## 
### 
MOSCOW — The leadership of the
Soviet Communist Party yesterday
proposed far-reaching political reforms
that would remove the party from the
day-to-day administration of the gov
ernment and the economy in an effort
to broaden democracy and increase
productivity.
Put forward by Mikhail Gorbachev,
the party's general secretary, and ap
proved by the policy-making Central
Committee, the proposals would to
tally transform Soviet society in what
Gorbachev has called "a revolution
without bullets."
The heart of reform would be "the
transfer of power in its entirety, from
the bottom through the top," from the
party to strengthened governmental
bodies, enterprises and other institu
tions. The party thus would attempt
to shape policy through the influence
of its members and effectiveness of its

policies.
If approved at a national party con
ference next month and then success
fully implemented, the proposals
would bring profound changes to the
daily life of every Soviet citizen, so
pervasive is the party's control now.
The lengthy document is at once an
indictment of the party's past leaders
and policies, a manifesto for radical
change and a program for action in
tended to accelerate the reforms and
make them "irreversible" despite the
gathering opposition to them.
Under the proposals, party commit
tees would no longer attempt to
manage factories, run local govern
ments, administer schools and univer
sities or assume other operating re
sponsibilities.
Party committees, including the
Central Committee, would be barred
from issuing directives to government

bodies, enterprises or other groups,
although today such orders supersede
even the country's laws.
Power would pass to elected govern
ments, to duly hired enterprise man
agers and to a proliferation of public
organizations, including the thousands
of rapidly emerging special-interest
groups.
Party officials, long accustomed to
sweeping powers, unquestioned au
thority and lifetime tenure, would
have to be elected by secret ballot in
competitive, multicandidate elections
— and then most would be limited to
two terms of five years each.
The reforms envision the party
working through its members, who
number nearly 20 million nationwide,
in governmental, economic and other
organizations and then extending its
influence by winning support for its
policies among non-members and

demonstrating its ability to lead.
But many of the measures — and
the process as a whole — have already
encountered strong resistance from
the entrenched bureaucracy, unwilling
to join this voluntary retreat from the
direct power it has accumulated over
70 years,
The immediate effect of the
"theses," as the proposals are called,
will be a further intensification of the
political struggle on the country's fu
ture now under way across the Soviet
Union.
"Perestroika is a conflicting process,
proceeding as it does through difficul
ties and the struggle between old and
new," the party declaration says, ac
knowledging opposition to the process
of political, economic and social re
structuring begun under Gorbachev.
