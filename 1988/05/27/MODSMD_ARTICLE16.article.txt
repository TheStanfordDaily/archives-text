# Syria's top 4 generals escape death in Beirut

### 
BEIRUT, Lebanon â€” Gunmen
tried to assassinate Syria's four
top generals in Beirut last night
on the eve of a Syrian-backed ef
fort to end 20 days of fighting
between rival Shiite Moslem
militias in Beirut's southern sub
urbs.
The Syrian generals' six-car
motorcade came under a hail of
machine-gun fire as they drove
back from a meeting with the spir
itual leader of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah militia, Shiite cleric
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
The assassination attempt,
which came only hours after the
announcement of plans to deploy
a security force of Syrian troops
and Lebanese police on today in
the battered Shiite slums south
of Beirut, exposed the vul
nerability of the Syrian forces
here.
The Syrian motorcade was on
its way out of the Hezbollah
controlled Ghobeiry district, with
the commander of Syrian troops
in Lebanon, Gen. Saeed Bairaq
dar, in the front seat of bul

letproof Mercedes 500 driven by
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, chief
of Syrian military intelligence in
Beirut. Two other generals, Brig.
Gen. Ali Hammoud, the chief of
Syrian military observers here,
and Brig. Gen. Zuheir Mustat,
were in the back seat.
A dozen gunmen raked the car
with bullets, piercing its fuel tank
and radiator, but Kanaan sped on
to his headquarters. None of the
generals was injured, although
one of Kanaan's guards was
wounded in the elbow.
Hammoud insisted that the in
cident would not affect Syria's
plan to deploy its forces in the
Shiite suburbs, where Hezbollah's
fighters have driven the Syrian
backed Amal militia out of 80 per
cent of the area.
Political sources returning last
night from Damascus, the Syrian
capital, said Syria had agreed with
the Iranians to deploy its troops
without "eliminating Hezbollah's
role."
