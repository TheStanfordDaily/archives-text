# Sandinistas reject Contra plan to change constitution
## 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua â€”
Breaking sharply with the terms
of a preliminary peace agreement,
Contra leaders yesterday offered
to lay down their arms by Feb
ruary under a new plan that calls
for rewriting Nicaragua's consti
tution.
The Sandinista presidential
press representative, Manuel
Espinoza, dismissed the proposal
as "damaging, provocative and to
tally senseless" and said it was
unacceptable as a basis for nego
tiations.
Rebel leaders outlined their
proposal at the start of three
scheduled days of talks aimed at
reaching a political settlement of
the six-year Nicaraguan war. This
is the third round of high-level
talks here growing out of the pre
liminary peace agreement signed

March 23 at the southern border
outpost of Sapoa.
Since then, the rebel move
ment, already deprived of U.S.
military aid, has been severely
weakened by a leadership struggle
and by its failure to achieve a
follow-up agreement allowing
non-lethal U.S. aid to reach its
12,000 troops inside Nicaragua.
At least a third of those forces
have retreated to base camps in
Honduras.
With their new proposal, the
rebels tried to regain the political
initiative from the Sandinistas,
who have outmaneuvered them
in previous rounds of talks and
now appear content to prolong the
negotiations in the belief that the
Contra movement is disintegrat
ing.
