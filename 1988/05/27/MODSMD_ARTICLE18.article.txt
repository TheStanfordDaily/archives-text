## Senate OKs amendment on pact interpretation 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Senate cleared
the decks for ratification of the historic
treaty banning medium-range missiles
yesterday, making a strong assertion
that its interpretation of the agreement
is permanently binding.
After hours of intense behind-the
scenes negotiations and a sharp floor
debate, a compromise pushed by Dem
ocrats settled a partisan dispute that
had simmered ever since the treaty was
signed by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in December
at their summit meeting in Washington.
The compromise amendment, offered
by Majority Leader Robert Byrd, I)-
W.Va., was adopted by a vote of 72-29,
removing the last major obstacle to ap
proval of the treaty. With a dozen minor
amendments still to be addressed, a final
vote on the treaty was possible late yes
terday.
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
noting that Republicans were unhappy
that the bitter turf fight between the
Senate and the government's executive
branch had become embroiled in the
treaty argument, hailed the compromise
as a sensible step to avoid "a partisan
blood-letting."
Twenty Republicans joined the Dem
ocrats in adopting Byrd's amendment,
bringing ratification within grasp, nearly
five months after the pact was submitted
for approval. Only one Democrat — Sen.
Ernest Hollings of South Carolina —
opposed the amendment, which Byrd
contended was more important than the
treaty itself.
The amendment declares that the
United States shall interpret the treaty
in accordance with the common under
standing of it by the president and the
Senate at the time of ratification. If a
dispute arises in the future over the
treaty's interpretation, it says, it will be
settled in accordance with U.S. law.
Removed was an earlier notation that
directly referred to a constitutional man
date for Senate interpretation of the
treaty.
Completed ratification documents are
expected to be in Moscow awaiting
Reagan when arrives Sunday for his six
day summit with Gorbachev.
Under terms of the treaty, the United
States and the Soviet Union must dis
mantle all of their ground-launched mis
siles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles.

For the Soviets it means getting rid
of 650 triple-warhead SS-20s targeted
on Western Europe. The United States
will remove from Europe and dismantle
429 Pershing 2 ballistic missiles and
ground-launched cruise missiles.
Approval of the treaty was a foregone
conclusion, but last-minute confusion
over language and conservative opposi
tion extended the Senate debate until
there was doubt that the ratification
documents would be ready to be ex
changed by Reagan and Gorbachev next
week.
Ten attempts to change the treaty
text were turned back during nine days
of debate on the Senate floor.
Democrats, angry over what they re
garded as the Reagan administration's
reinterpretation of the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile Treaty, also insisted
upon putting language in the Resolution
of Ratification asserting the Senate's
right to interpret treaties, and foreclos
ing any re-interpretation by future ad
ministrations.
Republicans yesterday labeled the
Byrd amendment, a compromise sub
stituted for stronger language earlier
approved by the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, as a naked power grab by the
Senate.
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., called adop
tion of the measure "an unconditional
surrender by the administration" and
"an unconscionable rush to judgment
by the Senate."
White House chief of staff Howard
Baker Jr., who remained in Washington
after Reagan's departure for Moscow via
Helsinki, conferred with Republican and
Democratic senators Wednesday night
and yesterday morning.
But Dole, who, citing the importance
of compromise, joined in voting for the
amendment, said the compromise did
not have the endorsement of the admin
istration.
Specter, insisting the amendment
issue was one of the most important to
reach the Senate floor in a decade,
declared that the Senate was launching
a "doctrine of two treaties," in which
American presidents will negotiate one
agreement with foreign powers and an
other with the Senate.
