# Justice Dept. expects second in command to resign soon

WASHINGTON â€” Assistant Attor
ney General Charles Cooper, one of
Attorney General Edwin Meese Ill's
most influential and trusted advisers,
is having job discussions with private
law firms and is expected to announce
his resignation soon, department
sources said yesterday.
The sources said Cooper, in an ap
parent attempt to distance his depar
ture from the report expected early
next month by Independent Counsel
James McKay, plans to announce his
resignation before the report but to

remain on the job until after its
release. They said Cooper has nar
rowed his choices to two Washington
law firms.
Cooper's expected departure, com
bined with resignations of two top de
partment officials and Meese's firing
this month of his chief press repre
sentative, would leave few experienced
officials among Meese's senior ad
visers.
As President Reagan's selections to
replace those who have resigned or
departed await Senate confirmation,

the department's second- and third
ranking positions are filled by
nominees serving in an acting capacity,
as is the head of the criminal division.
Cooper did not return repeated tele
phone calls yesterday. Justice Depart
ment press representative Patrick
Korten said that he had "no knowledge
of what Chuck's plans are" but that,
if reports of his imminent departure
are true, "it would scarcely be unusual
at this point in the administration.
"Take a look around at a dozen

Cabinet agencies around town, and
you will find a number of presidential
appointees have already departed for
the private sector," Korten said.
"Frankly, we're in far better shape
than most agencies." A Washington
Post-ABC News poll released yester
day found that Meese's popularity has
sunk to a record low, with a majority
of Americans viewing him unfavorably
and nearly two in five concluding that
he should resign.
