# Vigil participants explain actions
## 
### Jeff Album Staff writer 
In the wake of lingering resentment
over a masked vigil held Tuesday at
Otero, the seven participants attempted
to explain their actions in a written
statement released to the Daily yester
day.
Comments made by the protesters on
the night of the vigil that alleged the
violation of an Otero resident's First
Amendment rights were left off the
statement and retracted i)y group mem
bers during interviews yesterday.
The statement was signed by sopho
more Kirk Ferguson, juniors Dave
Filgas, Scott Lindus, John Romero and
Tim Walter, and seniors Dave Look and
John Naporano â€” all Phi Delta Theta
members who acted independently of
their fraternity.
The protest vigil occurred four days
after freshman Kenny Ehrman was

evicted from Otero for homophobic and
belligerent actions.
According to the statement, the vigil
was intended to draw attention to the
protesters' belief that other measures
short of eviction should have been taken
by Residential Education. "The resident
staff should have made more construc
tive efforts to address his insensitive
prejudices," the statement reads.
But the statement is also apologetic,
conceding that the vigil's methods were
insensitive.
"Our method backfired," the state
ment reads. The letter states that the
group's decision to wear masks and
bring candles to the vigil, evoking
images of the Ku KJux Klan, was not
intended to offend blacks or other mi
nority groups.
Members of the Stanford gay com
munity yesterday continued to voice
their displeasure that protesters have
made no explicit apology for being in

sensitive to gay people. Sophomore
Steven Sassaman, a member of the
Stanford Organization for Gay and Les
bian Equality, said that while he ap
preciates that the vigil was not intended
to promote homophobia, the protesters'
intention does not excuse the effects of
their tactics.
"Homophobia was inherent in the
means that they chose," Sassaman said.
"Even if their tactics were out of ig
norance, it doesn't change the fact that
I was offended."
Look said in an interview yesterday
that he understands why gay people
might be offended by the Otero incident.
But he had no comment when asked
why the group did not issue the gay
community a special apology.
Ferguson stressed that he and his
fellow protesters had never protested
before and that the experience at Otero
will have a chilling effect on any
future attempts. "I will never
protest anything again," he said.
But Black Student Union Chair
Mary Dillard, who told the pro
testers Wednesday it is their
responsibilty to educate them
selves on racial issues, said yes
terday that refusing to protest is
not a lesson that she wants the
seven to learn.
