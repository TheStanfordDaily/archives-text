## Prevent ignorance 
### 
Reactions, rumor,
publicity and controversy
following the eviction of
freshman Kenny Ehrman have
clouded the issues that lie at the
heart of the case. We should look
at the incident — and the subse
quent midnight demonstration
that has caused almost as much
furor — in terms of the questions
they raise for the Stanford com
munity.
As Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons pointed out in a state
ment Tuesday, one crucial ques
tion is "the extent to which behav
ior which seeks to abridge the
rights of others is protected by the
right to free speech."
Because the University keeps
disciplinary actions confidential,
the exact reasons for Ehrman's
suspension may never be known.
Clearly, though, he engaged in ho
mophobic verbal attacks on his res
ident assistant throughout the
year, making the RA's home un
liveable.
Such behavior is intolerable. It
violates the residence agreement
and creates a climate in which it
is impossible for an RA to do his
or her job. Freedom of speech does
not translate to freedom to harass
and to infringe on the rights of
others.
A second question, perhaps more
important: What conditions made
these events possible? How can the
University and students ensure
better dialogue in residences be
tween people with diametrically
opposed points of view?
The University strongly sup
ports gay and lesbian rights in its
non-discrimination policy. The Of
fice of Residential Education has
had limited success implementing
that policy by encouraging openly
gay and lesbian students to become

RAs and by training RAs about
these issues. Unfortunately, events
like the Otero incident may dis
courage other openly gay and les
bian students from becoming RAs
in the future.
In the residences, the burden of
education and fostering tolerance
falls largely on the RAs themselves,
with the help of the Lesbian, Gay
and Bisexual Speakers Bureau, a
student group.. The speakers
bureau went to both Otero and
the Phi Delta Theta house this
year; apparently the program did
not dispel the hostile attitudes of
some residents.
The University should devote
more of its considerable resources
to fostering programs and experi
ences that break down homopho
bia. Openly gay and lesbian RAs
are in the trenches, proving by ex
ample that they are good, "normal"
and valuable people. Even under
the best of conditions they are
likely to suffer enormous stress.
Res Ed should not assume that
simply because the University has
a non-discrimination policy, its job
is done. It should be more sup
portive of the RAs it hires.
Stanford, including Res Ed, has
failed to educate many students
about their own history. Why
didn't the students who partici
pated in the vigil — particularly
the members of ethnic minorities
— realize the significance of masks
and candles at midnight? Similarly,
why didn't the Kappa Kappa Gam
mas realize Wednesday that hold
ing a "Cowboys and Indians" party
would insult Native Americans?
Some students still believe that
homosexuality is wrong, and they
have as much right to free speech
and belief as the rest of society.
However, no exercise of free speech
justifies persecution. Period.
