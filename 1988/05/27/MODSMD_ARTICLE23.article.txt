## Some last predictions 
### 
FOR 15 WEEKS I've been fighting
this urge to write my column Larry
King style. Just think of what this
guy gets away with.
He gets to discuss umpteen different
topics (no need for attention span) . . .
and use lots of ellipses (no need for punc
tuation) . . . and put anything remotely
important in boldface (no need for
reading glasses). I envy the guy. Still, I
never felt justified in taking the King
plunge.
Ah, but this week I have an excuse. I
have three columns' worth of fact, opin
ion and utter fabrication yet to deliver,
but I only have one last column to deliver
them in. So here goes.
Presidential politics are heating up in
California as the June 7 primary draws
near, and I can't help thinking that also
ran Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., is still the
best qualified fellow for the job. . . . Only
four weeks ago, I finally got used to the
idea of Gov. Michael Dukakis edging out
George Bush come November.
And now, after talking to many de
pressed Republicans (yes, they're around,
you just have to know where to look)
and inspecting poll after poll giving The
Duke some 10 points on Bush, I'm ready
to predict a Dukakis landslide.
.. . Kudos to Rev. Jesse Jackson for a
race well run. He's got his faults, and
he may never be president, but you've
got to admit — as George Bush would
put it — Jackson kicked a little patootie
in 1988. . . .
My picks for the Dukakis cabinet? No
sweat . . . Gore for secretary of state,
even if he's also vice president . . . Jack

son for housing and urban development
or labor . . . Good ol' Bruce Babbitt for
interior . . . Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
for defense . ..
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., for
health and human services . . . House
budget chairman William Gray 111, D-
Pa., for treasury ... and, to replace
sleazemaster Edwin Meese as attorney
general, look for former federal judge
Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine.
Congressional primary races here in
California's 12th district are also warm
ing up ... On the Republican side, Stan
ford Law Prof. Tom Campbell has moved
into a nine-point lead over incumbent
Rep. Ernie Konnyu, who is apparently
still wondering just what he said that
ticked off that broad with the small
boobs.
Prediction for June 7: Campbell 60
percent, Konnyu 40.
In the Democratic camp, consultant
Jim Garrison's clear superiority in most
issues has begun to take its toll on front
running San Mateo County supervisor
Anna Eshoo.
Conversely, Eshoo is sharp on local
goings-on, but a clumsy novice at the
national and international questions.
Prediction: despite late gains by Gar
rison, the better-funded Eshoo will hold
on for the nomination.
A final hot spot: The eviction of self
styled Great White Hope Kenny Ehrman
has everyone buzzing with controversy
... As far as I know, and I may not
know it all, this chap was bounced be
cause he "insulted" some fellow Oterans
with "sexist and homophobic" expres

sions.
Ehrman also vandalized the dorm
lounge, but I get the distinct impression
that the University punished him only
for the filthy mouth, period. . . . I'm no
lawyer; I'm sure the University does
indeed have the legal right to chuck him.
Philosophically, though, the eviction is
hypocritical. Freedom of speech applies
to bigots too . . . Remember Skokic, Il
linois? The ACLU, led in Illinois by the
Jewish daughter of Nazi gas chamber
victims, defended the American Nazi
Party's right to march in the streets of
heavily Jewish Skokie. And lest we forget:
Ehrman's Jewish, and there is no
evidence he really printed that Aryan by
the Grace of God T-shirt . . .
Lesson: If we're trying to engender
tolerance, then we must tolerate every
one, including the intolerant. ... So, Ken
ny, if you're reading this, I hope you
return to University housing really soon.
Short of unambiguous invitations to
fight, please say anything you like about
them, whoever they may be. The truth
will out, as the saying goes . . . and so
do I.
