## Trustees should reconsider dismissal of Campbell 
### 
I WRITE TO register strong objec
tion to the Board of Trustees'
recent decision to retire W. Glenn
Campbell as Director of the Hoover
Institution.
I, and I am sure all of those persons
whom have had the pleasure and
privilege of working with Campbell,
recognize with profound admiration his
distinguished record of leadership at
Hoover and certainly regard his leader
ship as inexpendable.
In the short time that I have been
at Stanford, I have gained the utmost
respect for Campbell and the scholars
at Hoover. I am particularly glad to
have had the chance to get to know
him on a personal level.
The Board's decision to remove

Campbell is based, ostensibly, on an
agreement made between Stanford and
Hoover back in 1959 which stipulates
that the Director of the Hoover shall
relinquish his position upon reaching
the age of 65.
It seems rather silly to invoke the
agreement's "fine print" when in fact
many Stanford professors, distin
guished professors I might add, are
much older than 65.
I strongly urge the Board of Trus
tees to reconsider the terms of the
agreement. But if this idea does not
appeal to the Board, then I call on the
Board to apply those same standards
used to judge Campbell's situation to
the rest of Stanford faculty and admin
istration.

Moreover, it seems equally ridic
ulous, regardless of what the agree
ment dictates (any agreement can be
reconsidered or amended) that a per
son so exceedingly qualified to direct
the Hoover, as is Campbell, should be
forced to step down simply because of
his age.
Having made these contentions, I
urge Campbell to stand fast by his

principles when he is negotiating with
the University; he can rest assured he
will have strong support from myself
and the Stanford College Republicans
in his effort.
