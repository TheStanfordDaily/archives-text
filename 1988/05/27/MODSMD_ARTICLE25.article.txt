# Vigil not intended to be racially based
## 
### 
Through out years at Stanford, the
seven of us have all personally known
individuals who have had University
housing privileges revoked. The May
24 article explaining Ken Ehrman's
eviction from Otero sparked discussion
among us throughout the day.
Although not fully understanding the
situation any more than what was
written in The Daily, we wanted to let
the Stanford community and especially
Residential Education know that we
felt this course of action was not pro
ductive.
None of us involved knew the indi
vidual, but we felt the resident staff of
Otero should have made more con
structive efforts to address his insensi
tive prejudices.
Expulsion from housing before at
tempts are made at correction will only
exacerbate the problem, increase the
tension and cause confusion.

After some debate, the seven of us
chose to protest in front of Otero,
rather than write a letter to The Dai
ly. We called The Daily to try to get
coverage in the next day's edition,
hoping our point would be popular
among students in the dorms.
Having no prior experience in pro
testing, we decided to carry candles, as
we have seen other groups on campus
do in the past. As we are all members
of the same fraternity and realize how
the community would react to frater
nity members, we decided to wear
masks or goggles so that our view
would be seen as that of individuals
and not of our fraternity.
Our method backfired. Our precise
views were not conveyed properly, but
more importantly this method of
protest evoked unintended reactions.
We realize now that we upset many
people with the unawareness of our
methods.
If there is anything beneficial to be
derived from this misunderstanding, it
is a heightened awareness that individ

uals and groups must carefully con
sider how others in the community
will perceive their actions.
We see the need to educate ourselves
and a need within the University com
munity for fostering greater awareness
of racial issues. This event clearly
reflects the need to open lines of com
munication and incresae discourse be
tween minority groups and the rest of
the Stanford community.
We hope this situation will be used
as a springboard to launch positive
actions for others as it has done for
us.
We in no way support or condone
Ehrman's actions, but we were protest
ing what we perceived to be, based on
a misleading Daily article, unfair and
unjust punishment by the University.
We apologise to all for the method of
our protest and for our unawareness of
the sensitivity of such matters.
