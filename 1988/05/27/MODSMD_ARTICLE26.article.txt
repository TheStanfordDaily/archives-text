# Otero freshman not linked to racism
## 
### 
We wish to clarify that freshman
Kenny Ehrman's expulsion from Otero
was not prompted by any racist actions
or racist remarks made by him. He
never made or wore T-shirts with the
words "Aryan by the Grace of God" or
"WASP by popular demand," and he
was evicted for reasons other than
racism. While we in no way condone
the actions that led to his expulsion,
we feel it was wrong for The Daily to
make any implicit or explicit connec
tions between Kenny's expulsion and
unfounded charges of racist behavior.
