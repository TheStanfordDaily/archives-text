## Homophobic, racist and sexist actions violate University policy 
### 
IN THE VERY early morning hours
of Tuesday, May 24, an incident
occurred at Otero house that has
generated a lot of reaction among
students and others.
The event transpired shortly after
the conclusion of a house meeting
called to discuss the recent removal
from the residence of a student for
conduct in violation of the Residence
Agreement.
The student had verbally attacked
the resident fellow and a resident
assistant, had vandalized the dorm and
had repeatedly engaged in behavior
which insulted and violated the rights
of others.
According to the information I have
at the moment, the following is what
happened next.
Not long after the house meeting
ended, a small group of students
(about a half dozen) appeared in front
of the dorm, wearing masks and carry
ing lighted candles.
To at least one observer, it appeared
at first that they were wearing white
sheets, but that proved not to be the
case. Someone called a member of the
Black Students Union, who contacted
other members. Some 30 BSU mem
bers arrived at the dorm shortly there
afterr, as curious residents gathered at
the front of the dorm to see what was
going on.
After some questioning, the masked
individuals explained that they were
holding a silent vigil in support of the
evicted student's First Amendment
right to free speech. A conversation
ensued, eventually the individuals
removed their masks, and the talk
continued for some time. Ultimately,
everyone dispersed.
Some extremely important issues
have been raised in this event, and in
what led up to it. Perhaps the most
crucial is the question of the extent to
which behavior that seeks to abridge
the rights of others is protected by the
right to free speech.
Central to what has gone on at
Otero are the sentiments of a small

group of residents that they should not
be expected to tolerate the presence of
homosexual students on the residence
staff.
Stanford has stated as a matter of
policy that the University
. . admits students of either sex
and any race, color, religion, sexual
, orientation, or national and ethnic
original to all the rights, privileges,
programs, and activities generally
accorded or made available to
students at the University. It does
not discriminate against students
on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, or national and ethnic origin
in the administration of its educa
tional policies, admissions policies,
scholarships and loan programs,
and athletic and other University
administered programs.

Bulletin, 1988, p. 24
Clearly, among the University
administered programs is the presence
in the residences of resident fellows
and resident assistants.
Indeed, those programs are and must
be open to all students who apply and
are chosen to fill the RA positions in
the residences. Out of a commitment
to the educational merit of plurality,
the University actively seeks to foster
diversity in the residence staff.
Based on preliminary reports of what
transpired early Tuesday morning, one
is faced with the inescapable interpre
tation that the actions of some few
residents of the dorm and of the mem
bers of the masked group represent
support for the position that some
Stanford students don't belong here as
much as others do, or should not enjoy
the same rights as others do.
The symbolism of the group's mem
bers choosing to mask their identities
and approach silently in the dead of
night bearing small "torches" cannot
escape the notice of anyone who is at
all aware of the history of blaick people
in the United States.

Indeed, a member of the BSU was
one of the first people contacted when
the group showed up at the dorm.
Consequently, actions aimed at sup
porting the behavior of a student who
has repeatedly directed hurtful re
marks, epithets and actions at a
homosexual student had the effect of
harming racial minority students as
well.
According to some witnesses, the
masked group members expressed
sincere surprise that their "simple
vigil" had symbolized anything other
than support for a few students' free
dom of speech.
Accepting that their surprise was
sincere, I ask whether ignorance can
be an excuse in an instance like this.
The event serves to remind us all of
the necessity of thinking through
potential outcomes of our actions and
not just intended outcomes.
The response of the members of the
BSU was remarkable for its self
restraint and calmness in the face of
provocation and for that I want to
thank them. A situation that was
volatile in the extreme was turned into
a rational and thoughtful exchange by
the efforts of BSU leaders and mem
bers.
I have to wonder, though, whether
the day will ever come when the re
sponsibility for that kind of restraint
and that kind of teaching will not fall
only to black students.
Will the day come in our lifetimes
when all students, whatever their color
or background, will step forward and
challenge those who, out of ignorance
and insensitivity or out of pure malice,
would deny full participation in the life
of this university to some of their
fellow students?
I have heard that the students who
wore the masks did so because they
feared reprisals. Assuming that is true,
I must wonder what we need to do to
foster the sharing and discussion of
unpopular opinions in an atmosphere
of mutual respect.

We have to work to make that form of
communication more prevalent, espe
cially in areas where misunderstanding
can happen so easily.
For the past several years the Office
of Residential Education and various
student groups have sought, in RF and
RA training and in programs in the
residences, to help students learn how
to talk more comfortably and openly
about race, sex, sexual preference and
other matters that are highly charged
with feeling and opinion. Clearly,
there's more work to do.
Some students have charged that the
University, and especially Residential
Education, has a particular political
agenda. In a sense that is true — the
University is not morally neutral.

This is a place that values the
feeling of members of the community
and that finds repugnant acts of vi
ciousness or even ignorant insensitivi
ty. In other words, yes, Stanford does

and with only a preliminary report to

of Residential Deans, to conduct a full

hope to have received her report before
the end of the school year, that will
not be the end of the matter either.
We will use what we learn from this
experience not only in deciding how
best to respond to the students who
were involved but also in developing
plans for community discussion next
year of the context in which these
events occurred, of what gave rise to
what happened.
For now, though, let me put it as
simply and directly as I can: Members
of the Stanford community must know
that conduct which seeks to or has the
effect of discouraging the full participa
tion in the life of this University by
any student on account of his or her
sex, race, color, religion, sexual orienta
tion, or national and ethnic origin is in
violation of University principle and
policy.
Such conduct cannot and will not be
tolerated.

James Lyons

IN THE VERY early morning hours
of Tuesday, May 24, an incident
occurred at Otero house that has
generated a lot of reaction among
students and others.
The event transpired shortly after
the conclusion of a house meeting
called to discuss the recent removal
from the residence of a student for
conduct in violation of the Residence
Agreement.
The student had verbally attacked
the resident fellow and a resident
assistant, had vandalized the dorm and
had repeatedly engaged in behavior
which insulted and violated the rights
of others.
According to the information I have
at the moment, the following is what
happened next.
Not long after the house meeting
ended, a small group of students
(about a half dozen) appeared in front
of the dorm, wearing masks and carry
ing lighted candles.
To at least one observer, it appeared
at first that they were wearing white
sheets, but that proved not to be the
case. Someone called a member of the
Black Students Union, who contacted
other members. Some 30 BSU mem
bers arrived at the dorm shortly there
afterr, as curious residents gathered at
the front of the dorm to see what was
going on.
After some questioning, the masked
individuals explained that they were
holding a silent vigil in support of the
evicted student's First Amendment
right to free speech. A conversation
ensued, eventually the individuals
removed their masks, and the talk
continued for some time. Ultimately,
everyone dispersed.
Some extremely important issues
have been raised in this event, and in
what led up to it. Perhaps the most
crucial is the question of the extent to
which behavior that seeks to abridge
the rights of others is protected by the
right to free speech.
Central to what has gone on at
Otero are the sentiments of a small

group of residents that they should not
be expected to tolerate the presence of
homosexual students on the residence
staff.
Stanford has stated as a matter of
policy that the University
. . admits students of either sex
and any race, color, religion, sexual
, orientation, or national and ethnic
original to all the rights, privileges,
programs, and activities generally
accorded or made available to
students at the University. It does
not discriminate against students
on the basis of sex, race, color,
handicap, religion, sexual orienta
tion, or national and ethnic origin
in the administration of its educa
tional policies, admissions policies,
scholarships and loan programs,
and athletic and other University
administered programs.
— Stanford University Information
Bulletin, 1988, p. 24
Clearly, among the University
administered programs is the presence
in the residences of resident fellows
and resident assistants.
Indeed, those programs are and must
be open to all students who apply and
are chosen to fill the RA positions in
the residences. Out of a commitment
to the educational merit of plurality,
the University actively seeks to foster
diversity in the residence staff.
Based on preliminary reports of what
transpired early Tuesday morning, one
is faced with the inescapable interpre
tation that the actions of some few
residents of the dorm and of the mem
bers of the masked group represent
support for the position that some
Stanford students don't belong here as
much as others do, or should not enjoy
the same rights as others do.
The symbolism of the group's mem
bers choosing to mask their identities
and approach silently in the dead of
night bearing small "torches" cannot
escape the notice of anyone who is at
all aware of the history of blaick people
in the United States.

Indeed, a member of the BSU was
one of the first people contacted when
the group showed up at the dorm.
Consequently, actions aimed at sup
porting the behavior of a student who
has repeatedly directed hurtful re
marks, epithets and actions at a
homosexual student had the effect of
harming racial minority students as
well.
According to some witnesses, the
masked group members expressed
sincere surprise that their "simple
vigil" had symbolized anything other
than support for a few students' free
dom of speech.
Accepting that their surprise was
sincere, I ask whether ignorance can
be an excuse in an instance like this.
The event serves to remind us all of
the necessity of thinking through
potential outcomes of our actions and
not just intended outcomes.
The response of the members of the
BSU was remarkable for its self
restraint and calmness in the face of
provocation and for that I want to
thank them. A situation that was
volatile in the extreme was turned into
a rational and thoughtful exchange by
the efforts of BSU leaders and mem
bers.
I have to wonder, though, whether
the day will ever come when the re
sponsibility for that kind of restraint
and that kind of teaching will not fall
only to black students.
Will the day come in our lifetimes
when all students, whatever their color
or background, will step forward and
challenge those who, out of ignorance
and insensitivity or out of pure malice,
would deny full participation in the life
of this university to some of their
fellow students?
I have heard that the students who
wore the masks did so because they
feared reprisals. Assuming that is true,
I must wonder what we need to do to
foster the sharing and discussion of
unpopular opinions in an atmosphere
of mutual respect.

respectful ways for people who disagree
with each other to talk to each other.
We have to work to make that form of
communication more prevalent, espe
cially in areas where misunderstanding
can happen so easily.
For the past several years the Office
of Residential Education and various
student groups have sought, in RF and
RA training and in programs in the
residences, to help students learn how
to talk more comfortably and openly
about race, sex, sexual preference and
other matters that are highly charged
with feeling and opinion. Clearly,
there's more work to do.
Some students have charged that the
University, and especially Residential
Education, has a particular political
agenda. In a sense that is true — the
University is not morally neutral.
The sentiments expressed in the
foregoing quote from the Information
Bulletin reflect carefully thought out
and deeply held values of the institu
tion, as well as expectations for the
behavior of the members of this com
munity.
This is not a place that values intim
idation tactics; this is a place that
values learning and the rational and
thoughtful discourse that leads to
learning. This is a place that finds
cloaked secrecy at odds with our com
mitment to the open exchange of ideas.
This is a place that values the
feeling of members of the community
and that finds repugnant acts of vi
ciousness or even ignorant insensitivi
ty. In other words, yes, Stanford does
have certain values.
I have responded like this — quickly,

and with only a preliminary report to
go on — because the issues raised by
the events of Tuesday morning demand
an immediate response. However, this
is not the end of it.
I have asked Diana Conklin, Director
of Residential Deans, to conduct a full
investigation into the incident and the
events that led up to it. Although I
hope to have received her report before
the end of the school year, that will
not be the end of the matter either.
We will use what we learn from this
experience not only in deciding how
best to respond to the students who
were involved but also in developing
plans for community discussion next
year of the context in which these
events occurred, of what gave rise to
what happened.
For now, though, let me put it as
simply and directly as I can: Members
of the Stanford community must know
that conduct which seeks to or has the
effect of discouraging the full participa
tion in the life of this University by
any student on account of his or her
sex, race, color, religion, sexual orienta
tion, or national and ethnic origin is in
violation of University principle and
policy.
Such conduct cannot and will not be
