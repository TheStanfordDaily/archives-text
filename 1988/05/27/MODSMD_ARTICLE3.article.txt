# New asbestos plan
## Health and Safety to speed clean-up 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
After several unexpected
findings of asbestos this spring,
the University Department of
Health and Safety has an
nounced several new programs
to speed and simplify cleanup
of the potentially carcinogenic
fiber.
The measures establish a
core of specialized asbestos
workers and a shop at Bonair
Siding, a maintenance building
on the west side of campus,
that will remove and maintain
campus asbestos without out
side help. The programs will
supplement an ongoing survey
of asbestos at Stanford, now
conducted by outside contrac
tors.
Additionally, Health and
Safety will conduct a program
that will teach employees how
to work around asbestos, ac

cording to Health and Safety
specialist Jeffrey Bramlett,
who heads the program.
Noting more campus aware
ness of asbestos, Bramlett said
the Stanford community has
shown active interest in help
ing to control it. His office re
ceived nearly 180 requests for
inspection or information be
tween January and April.
Complaints by Tresidder Un
ion workers and a suggestion
by a baker that his lung cancer
may be linked to asbestos ex
posure prompted the removal
of an asbestos-covered pipe in
the Tresidder bakery in April.
While cleaning up that site,
more asbestos was discovered
in the Tresidder kitchen.

Workers, which seized upon
the bakery incident to criticize
