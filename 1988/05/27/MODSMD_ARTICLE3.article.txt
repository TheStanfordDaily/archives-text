# New asbestos plan
## Health and Safety to speed clean-up 
### Susan McKean Staff writer 
After several unexpected
findings of asbestos this spring,
the University Department of
Health and Safety has an
nounced several new programs
to speed and simplify cleanup
of the potentially carcinogenic
fiber.
The measures establish a
core of specialized asbestos
workers and a shop at Bonair
Siding, a maintenance building
on the west side of campus,
that will remove and maintain
campus asbestos without out
side help. The programs will
supplement an ongoing survey
of asbestos at Stanford, now
conducted by outside contrac
tors.
Additionally, Health and
Safety will conduct a program
that will teach employees how
to work around asbestos, ac

cording to Health and Safety
specialist Jeffrey Bramlett,
who heads the program.
Noting more campus aware
ness of asbestos, Bramlett said
the Stanford community has
shown active interest in help
ing to control it. His office re
ceived nearly 180 requests for
inspection or information be
tween January and April.
Complaints by Tresidder Un
ion workers and a suggestion
by a baker that his lung cancer
may be linked to asbestos ex
posure prompted the removal
of an asbestos-covered pipe in
the Tresidder bakery in April.
While cleaning up that site,
more asbestos was discovered
in the Tresidder kitchen.
The United Stanford
Workers, which seized upon
the bakery incident to criticize
the University's asbestos
policy, is satisfied with the new
program, according to Linda
Crouse, chief steward of the USW.
Alain Decleve, director of
Health and Safety, said these in
cidents indicate that a more direct
line is needed for people to alert
his department about asbestos on
campus. "We count on people to
identify situations" where as
bestos poses a hazard, he said.
The training program, slated to
begin in two months, will educate
all Operations and Maintenance
employees who work with as
bestos, as well as concerned com
munity members, about the dan
gers of asbestos, proper handling
methods and University reporting
and removal policies.
In formulating the new pro
gram, Bramlett found that
campus construction and re
modeling — both authorized and
unauthorized — requires a uni
form notification policy that en
sures unqualified students and
staff do not inadvertantly damage
intact asbestos or risk greater con
tamination by improperly remov
ing the material.
"People removing asbestos
without knowing what they are
doing run a very high risk of con

tamination," Decleve said.
The hiring of new employees
just to clean up asbestos will speed
up removal of small amounts of
the substance and save money be
cause the University will no
longer have to employ outside
contractors.
"It's very costly and takes a lot
of time to get a contractor to come
in," Bramlett said.
Two or three people will be
hired to complete the campus as
bestos survey, which was begun
two years ago. "It became appar
ent that it would be much quicker,
and we would get better informa
tion, if we could do it with people
who worked for Stanford,"
Decleve said.
He said the survey will take 10
to 15 years to complete. "There's
a lot of asbestos material now in
good shape that will eventually
decay and need attention."
The levels of asbestos checked
in the survey are stricter than
the National Institute of Safety
and Health standards, according
to Bramlett. He said the NISH
recommends a maximum level of
.1 fibers of asbestos per cubic cen
timeter, while Stanford prohibits
more than .01 fibers per cubic
centimeter at any location.
"We've gone a tenth below the
occupational level in an effort to
to make the best guess of what
is safe," Bramlett said.
