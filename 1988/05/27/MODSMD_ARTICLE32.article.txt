Below are a series of puzzles that your
eighth grade physics teacher might have
given you to test your mechanical apti
tude and conceptual skills. They can all

1. How would this letter A appear when
rpflected on the back of a silver spoon?
a.A b.V c . < d . >

2. The two gear wheels are connected
by a worm. If A is the driving wheel
and it turns in the direction of the arrow,
in which direction will B turn?
a. direction 1
b. direction 2
c. it will not turn

be solved with a little common sense,
or an equation or two.
If you are frustrated with these ques
tions, you should stay clear of the Me
chanical Engineering Department. See
if you can solve them!

3. These four wheels are driven at the
same speed by an electric motor. When
the motor is turned off, which wheel
will continue turning the longest? Each
black ring weighs five pounds.
a. A c. C
b. B d. D

4. As the ice melts, the water level in
the glass will:
a. rise
b. fall
c. remain the same
