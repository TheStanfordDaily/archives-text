## Profile Director Genatt lives on theater 
### Frank Lester Staff writer 
There are those who think
the thespian experience is a
bowl of cherries, a tasteful
divan, a Cezanne portrait
brought to life, an Ibsen cham
ber full of mannered still-lifes.
Not Simone Genatt.
Genatt, a fifth-year senior in
drama and sociolinguistics, says
she wants the audience to come
out of the theater reeling. If not
reeling, at least brimming with
enough thoughts to fill up hours
of conversation. She is a woman
who loves the epic, the grand
theme, the surreal, the icono
clast. She is a woman with a
goal.
A disaffected politico, Genatt
says she turned to the theater
because she saw it was a place
that would not put her in the
position of "having to give up
my morals." She diverted her
morals into her own theatrical
troupe, American International
Players, which is now 50 to 60
strong and includes several
Stanford students.
Now, Genatt says, she is so
full of the stage that she walks,
breathes and dreams about it.
And more often than not, those
dreams wind up, in a funny
Mobius twist, playing front
stage in future productions.
Genatt means business about
art imitating life. Or is it the
other way around? One can
never tell, at least not with
Genatt, and that's the way she
likes it."I want to tingle
people's imaginations," she says
with a grin.
Genatt, as mentioned, is a
woman with a goal. Actually,
one or two goals. Her first one
is to pull off the production she
is currently working on — a
"performance art rock musical,"
in her words — "Temple of
Fire." The show is based on a
Borges story, and when pressed

Now, Genatt says, she is so full of
the stage that she walks, breathes,
and has dreams about it.

for other influences, Genatt
rattles off names from all over
the map of surrealist thought,
including Kandinsky, Calvino
and lonesco.
After she puts the burning
surrealist temple to bed, Genatt,
who hails from New York City,
wants to go to Aspen, Colo., to
follow through on long-distance
plans she and her partners have
been cultivating to open a cul
tural center in the ski resort
town. Aspen, evidently, despite
its cachet and chicness, still does
not boast a single spot its arts
enthusiasts can funnel their as
sets into. Genatt wants to
change that.
Genatt has been toiling over
"Temple of Fire" since the day
two months ago when she sat
down and wrote the blueprint
for the show in no more than
two hours. Her whole premise
is to launch an attack on the
notion that the theater must be
a stodgy, suit-and-tie affair, an
occasion for the solemn absorp
tion of haute culture. "We're
creating as we go along," she
says."The process is like a jour
ney. The end doesn't come till
we actually perform it. I want
the audience to experience
something slightly outside what
they'd expect from a night at
the theater."
The troupe itself runs on the
ambitious assumption that art
ists can both perform and avoid
Chapter 11 in the process. "You
just have to be smart enough
to do what you want to do and
think about the fact that you
need money to live," she says.

This is why a number of the
people in the company are
tutored in such distinctly un
aesthetic trades as marketing
and accounting, and it is also
why Genatt is going with her
partners (Sheila Riley, Brigid
Tuescher and Eric Godtland) to
Aspen only with the knowledge
that the fund-raising they've
pursued is going to pan out. "All
of our contacts are there, and
the organization's there," ac
cording to Genatt. "All we need
to do is just get it together."
Genatt has no trouble with
the fact that her company is, in
her words, a "business/art ven
ture." She actually relishes the
fact. Being self-sufficient means
not having to be beholden to
bureaucrats, and if there's one
thing that drives Genatt up the
wall, it's bureaucrats. "Bureau
cracy works contrary to art,"
she says. "Bureaucracy takes
passing a letter through 30
hands. Our interest is that we
want to produce art."
Still, Genatt, as she smokes
her cigarette and reflects, knows
she's at a crossroads. The show
this week is the "culmination,"
she says, of the five years she's
put into the theater. And then
it's off to the Rockies.
She laughs at the uncertainty
of it all; she seems to enjoy it.
"Who knows what it'll be in the
next five years?" she asks. "A
box in the middle of the stage
doing nothing?"
Somehow you gather that
even if it's a motionless cube
on a blank stage, Genatt will
make it sing.

And more often than not, those
dreams wind up, in a funny
Mobius twist, playing front
stage in future productions.
Genatt means business about
art imitating life. Or is it the
other way around? One can
never tell, at least not with
Genatt, and that's the way she
likes it."I want to tingle
people's imaginations," she says
with a grin.
Genatt, as mentioned, is a
woman with a goal. Actually,
one or two goals. Her first one
is to pull off the production she
is currently working on — a
"performance art rock musical,"
in her words — "Temple of
Fire." The show is based on a
Borges story, and when pressed

Now, Genatt says, she is so full of
the stage that she walks, breathes,
and has dreams about it.

for other influences, Genatt
rattles off names from all over
the map of surrealist thought,
including Kandinsky, Calvino
and lonesco.
After she puts the burning
surrealist temple to bed, Genatt,
who hails from New York City,
wants to go to Aspen, Colo., to
follow through on long-distance
plans she and her partners have
been cultivating to open a cul
tural center in the ski resort
town. Aspen, evidently, despite
its cachet and chicness, still does
not boast a single spot its arts
enthusiasts can funnel their as
sets into. Genatt wants to
change that.
Genatt has been toiling over
"Temple of Fire" since the day
two months ago when she sat
down and wrote the blueprint
for the show in no more than
two hours. Her whole premise
is to launch an attack on the
notion that the theater must be
a stodgy, suit-and-tie affair, an
occasion for the solemn absorp
tion of haute culture. "We're
creating as we go along," she
says."The process is like a jour
ney. The end doesn't come till
we actually perform it. I want
the audience to experience
something slightly outside what
they'd expect from a night at
the theater."
The troupe itself runs on the
ambitious assumption that art
ists can both perform and avoid
Chapter 11 in the process. "You
just have to be smart enough
to do what you want to do and
think about the fact that you
need money to live," she says.

This is why a number of the
people in the company are
tutored in such distinctly un
aesthetic trades as marketing
and accounting, and it is also
why Genatt is going with her
partners (Sheila Riley, Brigid
Tuescher and Eric Godtland) to
Aspen only with the knowledge
that the fund-raising they've
pursued is going to pan out. "All
of our contacts are there, and
the organization's there," ac
cording to Genatt. "All we need
to do is just get it together."
Genatt has no trouble with
the fact that her company is, in
her words, a "business/art ven
ture." She actually relishes the
fact. Being self-sufficient means
not having to be beholden to
bureaucrats, and if there's one
thing that drives Genatt up the
wall, it's bureaucrats. "Bureau
cracy works contrary to art,"
she says. "Bureaucracy takes
passing a letter through 30
hands. Our interest is that we
want to produce art."
Still, Genatt, as she smokes
her cigarette and reflects, knows
she's at a crossroads. The show
this week is the "culmination,"
she says, of the five years she's
put into the theater. And then
it's off to the Rockies.
She laughs at the uncertainty
of it all; she seems to enjoy it.
"Who knows what it'll be in the
next five years?" she asks. "A
box in the middle of the stage
doing nothing?"
Somehow you gather that
even if it's a motionless cube
on a blank stage, Genatt will
make it sing.
