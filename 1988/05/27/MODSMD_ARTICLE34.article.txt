# Stage Review
## Uneven 'Temple' feeds on its fire 
### Frank Lester Staff writer 
Peformance art, if nothing else,
is a cannibalistic medium. In con
stant search of new ideas to main
tain its status as the true avant
garde sector of the arts commu
nity, performance art ends up
rehashing all the oldest concepts
in the book and dishing them out
to you (like Chicken Chalupa) as
if they are the cutting edge of life
itself.
Simone Genatt's "Temple of
Fire," a self-styled combination of
performance art and rock musical,
is no exception to this rule. In
fact, it glories in its cannibalism.
Genatt's piece, which runs
about an hour in length, is a free
form "dream within a dream
within a dream within a dream"
— something Lewis Carroll might
have written had he been on
amphetamines. It takes place on
a stage that we are given to as
sume is a "ruined circular
temple," as one of the characters
puts it in song. (The score, written
by a member of the local group
Walkabout, is a dated amalgam
of Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel
and Laurie Anderson.)
Let's talk themes. Genatt, as
evinced by her remarks in an in
terview, is highly charged with
the idea of bringing large themes
to the stage. Genatt's twist is that
her ideas come by way of Eugene
lonesco and Sigmund Freud.
lonesco's two big obsessions
were dreams and words. Words,
he said, were "chaos," meaning
less attempts by human pawns to
make sense of an incomprehensi
ble universe, and dreams were the
expressions of the essential truths
(our fear of death foremost among
them), which our conscious words
tried to hide: Thus, lonesco's
theater of the absurd.
lonesco relished in turning con
ventional symbols on their heads.
The father, which is traditionally
a benefactor and mentor, is in
lonesco's mind a "tyrant" and
"monster." In Genatt's hands,

then, the father figure, in the
form of Dreamer M, becomes a
"man from the south" played by
a woman (Jennifer Arnold). M im
maculately (magically) conceives
a child (Andy Ropp). This child
springs — as Athena sprung from
the brow of Zeus, full-grown, rip
pling muscles, punk hairstyle and
all (the New Wave Oedipus:
Freud's ultimate nightmare) —
into being as not only M's son
but as his sexual object as well.
Thus we have the approprate
symbolic subversion. The
androgynous and ostensibly
homoerotic Dreamer M also ful
fills the conventional performance
art fantasy of uniting the male
and female aspects of the human
being in one entity. The performer
Meredith Monk calls such unity
"satisfying," but Genatt, not as
enthusiastic, conceives the her
maphrodite as monstrous and
vacillating. Genatt has compared
Dreamer M to Huck Finn, but
he/she is more like Hamlet in
drag.
Bill King, who allegorizes fire,
fulfills the lonescan obversion of
warmth into destruction. As

Genatt conceives him, he is a
sooty shaman, evil powermonger
and leering carnivore. He is the
one whose dream everyone really
is a product of, but he lets M
think the world is her hand of
cards as long as it suits his ul
timate Hitlerian purpose.
You should by now be getting
the impression that this is quite
a masterpiece of disjunction and
disorganization, an impression
which will be confirmed should
you go see the show. There is
very little balletic about the
choreography, in keeping with
Isadora Duncan's injunction to
dance from the solar plexus and
not the spine. There is a mocking
lack of rhyme in the libretto, a
mockery lonesco would either ap
plaud or deride, depending on his
mood.
All in all, Genatt's aim is to
exact violence on the world of
Stanfordite solidity and angular
ity. It is easy to imagine that
Genatt views life here as
epitomized by a combination of
self-righteous Frisbee and
football-throwing rectitude, fash
ionable conformity and ideological
purity which most students, es
pecially males, have bought into
while they are still nursing Ori
entation hangovers. The primal
fantasy Genatt enacts here is ap
parently meant to counteract that
syndrome, but her piece, a Grand
Guignol pottage of incantatory
mass-media est, makes little sense
outside Genatt's head, and it
indeed almost takes an indepen
dent pride in that fact.
The events which act them
selves out on this stage are dream
like in every sense of the word,
except that dreams are, in gener
al, either more exciting or more
frightening. This dream was more
like a holding pattern before REM
sleep.

the idea of bringing large themes
to the stage. Genatt's twist is that
her ideas come by way of Eugene
lonesco and Sigmund Freud.
lonesco's two big obsessions
were dreams and words. Words,
he said, were "chaos," meaning
less attempts by human pawns to
make sense of an incomprehensi
ble universe, and dreams were the
expressions of the essential truths
(our fear of death foremost among
them), which our conscious words
tried to hide: Thus, lonesco's
theater of the absurd.
lonesco relished in turning con
ventional symbols on their heads.
The father, which is traditionally
a benefactor and mentor, is in
lonesco's mind a "tyrant" and
"monster." In Genatt's hands,

then, the father figure, in the
form of Dreamer M, becomes a
"man from the south" played by
a woman (Jennifer Arnold). M im
maculately (magically) conceives
a child (Andy Ropp). This child
springs — as Athena sprung from
the brow of Zeus, full-grown, rip
pling muscles, punk hairstyle and
all (the New Wave Oedipus:
Freud's ultimate nightmare) —
into being as not only M's son
but as his sexual object as well.
Thus we have the approprate
symbolic subversion. The
androgynous and ostensibly
homoerotic Dreamer M also ful
fills the conventional performance
art fantasy of uniting the male
and female aspects of the human
being in one entity. The performer
Meredith Monk calls such unity
"satisfying," but Genatt, not as
enthusiastic, conceives the her
maphrodite as monstrous and
vacillating. Genatt has compared
Dreamer M to Huck Finn, but
he/she is more like Hamlet in
drag.
Bill King, who allegorizes fire,
fulfills the lonescan obversion of
warmth into destruction. As

Genatt conceives him, he is a
sooty shaman, evil powermonger
and leering carnivore. He is the
one whose dream everyone really
is a product of, but he lets M
think the world is her hand of
cards as long as it suits his ul
timate Hitlerian purpose.
You should by now be getting
the impression that this is quite
a masterpiece of disjunction and
disorganization, an impression
which will be confirmed should
you go see the show. There is
very little balletic about the
choreography, in keeping with
Isadora Duncan's injunction to
dance from the solar plexus and
not the spine. There is a mocking
lack of rhyme in the libretto, a
mockery lonesco would either ap
plaud or deride, depending on his
mood.
All in all, Genatt's aim is to
exact violence on the world of
Stanfordite solidity and angular
ity. It is easy to imagine that
Genatt views life here as
epitomized by a combination of
self-righteous Frisbee and
football-throwing rectitude, fash
ionable conformity and ideological
purity which most students, es
pecially males, have bought into
while they are still nursing Ori
entation hangovers. The primal
fantasy Genatt enacts here is ap
parently meant to counteract that
syndrome, but her piece, a Grand
Guignol pottage of incantatory
mass-media est, makes little sense
outside Genatt's head, and it
indeed almost takes an indepen
dent pride in that fact.
The events which act them
selves out on this stage are dream
like in every sense of the word,
except that dreams are, in gener
al, either more exciting or more
frightening. This dream was more
like a holding pattern before REM
sleep.
