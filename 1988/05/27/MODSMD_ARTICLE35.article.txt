# Movie Review
## 'Willow' not perfect but not a disappointment 
### M.J. Shay Staff writer 
George Lucas' new movie "Wil
low" beat the summer rush to the
box office. It is the first
movie of the summer and may
turn out to be the best of the
"top three."
"Willow" has been stirring in
terest for months. Rumors spread
about how exorbitant the cost was
getting, about the lack of
prudence in casting several
midgets and just about anything
and everything connected to
Lucas and his newest creation.
"Willow" has a lot riding on it.
Some bigwigs in the industry say
this is the movie that will make
or break Lucasfilm Ltd. and at
the very least establish if "Star
Wars" was just a fluke for Lucas.
Actually, it is just another
movie trying to cash in on the
summer vacation crowd (most of
the world is finished with school).
Willow's release date was ad
vanced to May 20. It was sched
uled to open May 25 along with
the other superpowers of the sum
mer, "Rambo III" and "Crocodile
Dundee II."
Lucasfilm said the reason for
the change was in part to get a
week's worth of non-competition,
but mainly because they didn't
want to release it on the same
date that "Star Wars" was re

leased 11 years ago. They wanted
to lessen comparisons between
the two.
That, of course, triggered a lot
of comparisons, many unjust.
Maybe I was wrong, or maybe a
little of Spielberg rubbed off onto
Lucas. You could see the early
trends in the Ewoks and their
antics. The too-cute teddy bears
left a bad taste in my mouth years
ago and "Willow" smacks of Ewok
cuteness.
Also, there are a couple of silly
brownies who beat on each other,
and Madmartigan (Val Kilmer) is
a abusive rogue who falls in love
with the evil Sorsha (Joanne
Whalley) via pixie dust.
Lucas' early films were unclut
tered by such cuteness (if pugna
cious brownies are cute). There
was humor (remember Chew
bacca howling at a little robot?)
but it was played straight and not
nearly so heavy-handed.
With "Willow," Lucas is in a
different genre then any of his
previous works. He is also work
ing in a genre that hasn't
produced a solid movie in many,
many years. "The Sword and Sor
cery" field is littered with the
remains of movies from "Conan"
to "Dragonslayer" to a deluge of
movies that only made it to video
tape.
For a fantasy movie, "Willow"
is well done, competently acted,

with reasonably understandable
motivations and a feeling of
simplicity. Some argue against the
simplistic nature of the movie.
Both the plot and the actions of
the minor characters are very,
well . . . simple. At times innocent
and naive.
The innocence and naivete help
this movie. They almost offset the
dozens of close-up shots of a baby
making faces. The baby is on film
so often they had to use twins
because of child labor laws. One
baby couldn't legally be worked
that much.
Seriously, though, the actions
of Willow (Warwick Davis) should
confer the innocence of the film.
The oh-so-cute baby pics didn't
need to be used to establish the
fresh, baby-like character of the

movie. Maybe parents love looking
at babies. I don't. They make too
much noise and have to be
changed too often.
This movie is for children and
their parents. It is not an intel
lectual affair, nor is it a puzzler
that keeps you guessing motiva
tions and plot twists.
Judging by all the press about
"Willow", it seems like it is time
to bash Lucas. It is the"in" thing
to do. I disagree.
"Willow" is a fine attempt at a
sword-and-sorcery fantasy. I just
don't believe the big screen works
for elfin characters from un
pronounceable places with un
pronounceable names scampering
around pastoral woodlands throw
ing magic spells.
