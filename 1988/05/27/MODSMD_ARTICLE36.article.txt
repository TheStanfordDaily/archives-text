# Movie Review
## Same old Croc again 
### M.J. Shay Staff writer 
A couple of years ago the
first Croc movie was a hit. No
one knew what "puttin' shrimp
on the barbie" meant. Now it's
old stuff, and the new Croc has
to come up with new glimmers
of Australian life to intrigue
the jaded American audience
in "Crocodile Dundee II."
This time the authentic
Australia is the outback and
the glimmer is a pseudo
aboriginal series of tricks to do
away with a group of nasty
drug smugglers. First Dundee
(Paul Hogan) has to show how
well-liked he is in New York.
He does this by fishing with
dynamite and offering the
police who try to drag him off
a fish. Then he goes home and
decides he wants to get a job.
Next he goes to the bar,
where everyone knows him and
he is called Mick and an
nounces he wants a job. He
gets one from a friend. He also
plays in the park with a group
of kids and shows them how
neat it is to throw stones at
cans and what animal foot
prints look like.

In short, everyone in New
York is Mick's best friend. Well
almost. There is a guy who
smuggles drugs and he doesn't
like the Aussie. Throughout his
adventures in the Big Apple,
he is still saying things like
"Who was Nixon?" This shows
just how innocent the Austral
ians are.
If you go to this movie, don't
expect anything new. It is the
same Mick Dundee doing his
thing, pulling his knife on bad
guys and sounding mystical
and omnipotent.
The movie is an action
comedy. There is lots of action,
a lot of neat knife throwing
and a dead snake or two. You
giggle as Dundee tries out per
fume in a department store and
he gets startled when he finds
a guy is about to jump off a
building because another guy
jilted him. The movie is a lot
of vignettes with Hogan at the
center.
But what the hell, Hogan is
a likeable guy, and he has
promised not to try to rip us
off with a Croc 111. See it, sneak
in a Foster's to get in the mood,
but don't sound like an Aussie
after the movie, okay? G'day.
