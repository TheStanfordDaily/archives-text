## Double doubles KOs end men's tennis season 
### Matthew Bodman Senior staff writer 
ATHENS, Ga. - The final
chapter in a storybook
season for the Stanford
men's tennis team didn't
end quite the way it was
expected.
After the Cardinal won

ihe 104 th NCAA Tennis Championship
here three days ago, each doubles tandem
bowed out yesterday in the NCAA Dou
bles Championships. Wednesday, all four
Stanford entries lost in the NCAA Singles
Championships.
"I don't think we played badly," Stan
ford Coach Dick Gould said. "But I don't
think we played well. The main disap-

pointment is that not doing well in the
individual tournaments took a little
luster off of winning the team title."
Freshman David Wheaton and sopho
more Jeff Tarango, the tournament's No.
2 seeds, dropped a 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 decision
in the first round to Wake Forest's Chris
tian Dallwitz and Mark Greenan.
Not competing at their best, Wheaton
and Tarango didn't show the fight when
the match was on the line that usually
makes them one of the nation's best
teams.
"We were hitting the ball well, but we
lacked the flair and energy out there,"
Tarango said. "We just went out to play
and not to kill. Instead of a take-no
prisoners attitude, we had a complacent
attitude. After winning the team title,

of a take-no-prisoners attitude, we had a com
placent attitude.' _ jeff Tarango

we were too content. That pretty much
sums it up for all of us."
Senior Patrick McEnroe and freshman
Martin Blackman also lost yesterday, slip
ping 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 to Mississippi's Jamie
Borras and Dave Randall in the second
round.
With the Stanford duo ahead a break
at 4-3 in the deciding set and McEnroe
serving, Borras hit a backhand winner

on a 3-3 point to even the match at 4-4.
Borras and Randall broke McEnroe
again in the 12th game of the final set
to close out the match.
"I definitely feel a little bit down,"
McEnroe said. "I didn't play near my
capabilities. It's been a tough week for
me here. It seemed like I got worse with
each match. It would have been nice to
play a little better."

Card notes
Because of their seeding in the singles and
doubles championships, Whcaton (seeded in
the second group of eight in the singles) and
Tarango (the No. 5 seed in singles) are 1988
All-Americans.
Wheaton, Tarango and Blackman are three
of the members of the 1988 Junior Davis Cup
Team. They join such players as UCLA's Buff
Farrow, USC's Scott Melville and Georgia's
A 1 Parker in a program that provides coach
ing, practice and professional tournament ex
penses for the players over the summer.
Pepperdine's Robbie Weiss, UCLA's Brian
Garrow, Farrow and Parker reached the
NCAA's Singles Championship semifinals yes
terday. Weiss plays Parker, and Garrow faces
Farrow today.
