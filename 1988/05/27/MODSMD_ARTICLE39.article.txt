# Baseball called due to marathon

### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
NEW BRITAIN,
Conn. — Stan
ford's regularly
scheduled game
yesterday died a
hero's death.
The Cardinal

was supposed to play St. John's
at 11:30 a.m. PDT yesterday in
the NCAA Northeast Regional at
Beehive Field. But Stanford's
game was called off because the
two teams in yesterday's first
game, Fordham and No. 1 seed
Clemson, played the longest game
in NCAA Division I playoff his
tory.
Fordham and Clemson began
playing at 8:30 a.m., and didn't
stop until five hours and 18
minutes later, with Clemson
prevailing 3-2 in 19 innings.
That was three innings longer
than the two previous longest
playoff games in Division I his
tory. In 1972, Connecticut beat
Harvard 8-5 in 16 innings in the
District 1 Regional (the forerun
ner of the Northeast Regional);
and in the 1979 Atlantic Regional,
Miami beat The Citadel 3-1 in 16.
The Clemson-Fordham game

was also the eighth longest base
ball game, regular season or
playoff, in Division I history. The
longest was a 1974 game in which
Colorado beat Nebraska 2-1 in 22
innings.
Yesterday's game ended at
about 1:45 p.m., and with the
Class AA New Britain Red Sox
(the normal occupants of Beehive
Field) and Albany Yankees sched
uled to play at 4 p.m., there wasn't
time for Stanford's game.
The Cardinal and St. John's
now will meet at 9 a.m. PDT
today. It will be a game of double
jeopardy, because the loser must
play again at 4 p.m. tonight in
an elimination game against
Fordham.
"I don't think [the resched
uling] favors either team," Stan
ford senior catcher Doug Robbins
said. "But whoever loses tomor
row is going to be in trouble. . . .
It could put you at a big disad
vantage."
Fordham, on the other hand,
seems to thrive on such tests of
endurance. Yesterday's marathon
was the fourth extra-inning con
test in less than a week for the
Rams, who played two 10-inning
games and a 14-inning game in
the East Coast Athletic Confer
ence Tournament (also at Beehive
Field) last week.
Ironically, yesterday's game
was the first extra-inning contest
of the entire season for Clemson,
now 53-12 on the year.
The Tigers used seven different
pitchers, including one two differ
ent times. First baseman Mike
Milchin, who doubles as Clem
son's late-inning reliever, was
moved from first to the mound
in the eighth inning, went back
to first in the ninth, returned to
the mound in the 11th and went
back to first base in the 14th.
"He (Milchin) has been our
closer all year, and when I
brought him out that first time,
I thought it was closing time,"
Clemson Coach Bill Wilhelm said.
"And when I brought him out the
second time, I thought it was
closing time then, too. But I mis
calculated. I made a lot of mis
calculations today."
Wilhelm did, however, get a
chance to give a lot of pitchers a
good workout. "After a day of
travel (Tuesday) and a day off
(Wednesday), I wanted all my
pitchers to get a chance to throw
hard and throw off a mound —
but I didn't want them all to do

it in a game," he said, grinning.
"I was wondering where in the
hell he (Wilhelm) was getting all
those pitchers," Fordham Coach
Dan Gallagher said. "I think there
was a hole in the ground in the
dugout that he was pulling them
out of."
Gallagher, for his part, chose
to conserve pitchers, using only
two. Bob Aylmer, a reliever all
season, made his first start of the
year and went BV3 innings, and
Paul Darrigo, ordinarily a starter,
came on in relief and threw 10%.
Darrigo threw the equivalent of
a complete-game shutout between
the ninth and 19th innings (a 10-
inning period during which both
teams were scoreless), but weak
ened a bit in the top of the 19th.
With two outs in that frame, Dar
rigo walked pinch-hitter David
Tripp, who then stole second.
Rusty Charpia then doubled into
the right-center gap to drive in
Tripp and give the Tigers a 3-2
lead.
Not content merely to score the
game-winning run, Tripp took the
mound for Clemson and closed
out the game to pick up his first
save of the season. The win went
to Mike Kimbrell.
For Gallagher, the hard-fought
game was a vindication of college

baseball in the Northeast, which
is generally considered to be a few
notches below the caliber of col
legiate play in the West and
South. "The worst thing about
this game is that there has to be
a loser," he said. "But at least
Clemson knows that Fordham
alive and that baseball in the
Northeast is not as bad or as weak
as they think it is."

NEW BRITAIN,
Conn. — Stan
ford's regularly
scheduled game
yesterday died a
hero's death.
The Cardinal

was supposed to play St. John's
at 11:30 a.m. PDT yesterday in
the NCAA Northeast Regional at
Beehive Field. But Stanford's
game was called off because the
two teams in yesterday's first
game, Fordham and No. 1 seed
Clemson, played the longest game
in NCAA Division I playoff his
tory.
Fordham and Clemson began
playing at 8:30 a.m., and didn't
stop until five hours and 18
minutes later, with Clemson
prevailing 3-2 in 19 innings.
That was three innings longer
than the two previous longest
playoff games in Division I his
tory. In 1972, Connecticut beat
Harvard 8-5 in 16 innings in the
District 1 Regional (the forerun
ner of the Northeast Regional);
and in the 1979 Atlantic Regional,
Miami beat The Citadel 3-1 in 16.
The Clemson-Fordham game

was also the eighth longest base
ball game, regular season or
playoff, in Division I history. The
longest was a 1974 game in which
Colorado beat Nebraska 2-1 in 22
innings.
Yesterday's game ended at
about 1:45 p.m., and with the
Class AA New Britain Red Sox
(the normal occupants of Beehive
Field) and Albany Yankees sched
uled to play at 4 p.m., there wasn't
time for Stanford's game.
The Cardinal and St. John's
now will meet at 9 a.m. PDT
today. It will be a game of double
jeopardy, because the loser must
play again at 4 p.m. tonight in
an elimination game against
Fordham.
"I don't think [the resched
uling] favors either team," Stan
ford senior catcher Doug Robbins
said. "But whoever loses tomor
row is going to be in trouble. . . .
It could put you at a big disad
vantage."
Fordham, on the other hand,
seems to thrive on such tests of
endurance. Yesterday's marathon
was the fourth extra-inning con
test in less than a week for the
Rams, who played two 10-inning
games and a 14-inning game in
the East Coast Athletic Confer
ence Tournament (also at Beehive
Field) last week.
Ironically, yesterday's game
was the first extra-inning contest
of the entire season for Clemson,
now 53-12 on the year.
The Tigers used seven different
pitchers, including one two differ
ent times. First baseman Mike
Milchin, who doubles as Clem
son's late-inning reliever, was
moved from first to the mound
in the eighth inning, went back
to first in the ninth, returned to
the mound in the 11th and went
back to first base in the 14th.
"He (Milchin) has been our
closer all year, and when I
brought him out that first time,
I thought it was closing time,"
Clemson Coach Bill Wilhelm said.
"And when I brought him out the
second time, I thought it was
closing time then, too. But I mis
calculated. I made a lot of mis
calculations today."
Wilhelm did, however, get a
chance to give a lot of pitchers a
good workout. "After a day of
travel (Tuesday) and a day off
(Wednesday), I wanted all my
pitchers to get a chance to throw
hard and throw off a mound —
but I didn't want them all to do

it in a game," he said, grinning.
"I was wondering where in the
hell he (Wilhelm) was getting all
those pitchers," Fordham Coach
Dan Gallagher said. "I think there
was a hole in the ground in the
dugout that he was pulling them
out of."
Gallagher, for his part, chose
to conserve pitchers, using only
two. Bob Aylmer, a reliever all
season, made his first start of the
year and went BV3 innings, and
Paul Darrigo, ordinarily a starter,
came on in relief and threw 10%.
Darrigo threw the equivalent of
a complete-game shutout between
the ninth and 19th innings (a 10-
inning period during which both
teams were scoreless), but weak
ened a bit in the top of the 19th.
With two outs in that frame, Dar
rigo walked pinch-hitter David
Tripp, who then stole second.
Rusty Charpia then doubled into
the right-center gap to drive in
Tripp and give the Tigers a 3-2
lead.
Not content merely to score the
game-winning run, Tripp took the
mound for Clemson and closed
out the game to pick up his first
save of the season. The win went
to Mike Kimbrell.
For Gallagher, the hard-fought
game was a vindication of college

baseball in the Northeast, which
is generally considered to be a few
notches below the caliber of col
legiate play in the West and
South. "The worst thing about
this game is that there has to be
a loser," he said. "But at least
Clemson knows that Fordham
alive and that baseball in the
Northeast is not as bad or as weak
as they think it is."
