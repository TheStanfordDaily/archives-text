# Black fraternities: an enigmatic tradition
## 
### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
Wearing bright gold gloves,
boots, purple T-shirts and black
berets, toting lanterns and
shields, three Omega Psi Phi
pledges marched about campus
for several hours last Friday. This
marked the final day of pledge
activities for these men. They
would now "cross" into the ranks
of one of Stanford's three tradi
tionally black fraternities.
In all, 11 students were initi
ated into black fraternities during
the past two weeks, pushing the
organizations' total membership
to 44.
Because so much attention is
given to the mainstream frater
nities on campus, many students
don't realize that a separate,
traditionally black fraternal sys
tem co-exists here.
These black fraternities, the
first of which was founded in 1906

at Cornell University, exist at uni
versities across the country. The
original black fraternities were
started because their leaders were
shunned at established white fra
ternities. Today, however, these
groups are not exclusively black.
Stanford's first black fraternity,
Alpha Phi Alpha, was founded in
1978, and currently has 13 mem
bers. Kappa Alpha Psi and Omega
Psi Phi, with 21 and 10 members
respectively, have since joined the
Alphas as organizations that pro
vide brotherhood and opportunity
for public service to black men on
campus.
Because the only contact most
students have with the black fra
ternities is witnessing their vis
ually striking pledge rituals, many
misconceptions and questions
have been bred. Most notably,
rumors of hazing have plagued
the system.
