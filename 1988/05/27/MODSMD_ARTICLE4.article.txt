# Black fraternities: an enigmatic tradition
## 
### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
Wearing bright gold gloves,
boots, purple T-shirts and black
berets, toting lanterns and
shields, three Omega Psi Phi
pledges marched about campus
for several hours last Friday. This
marked the final day of pledge
activities for these men. They
would now "cross" into the ranks
of one of Stanford's three tradi
tionally black fraternities.
In all, 11 students were initi
ated into black fraternities during
the past two weeks, pushing the
organizations' total membership
to 44.
Because so much attention is
given to the mainstream frater
nities on campus, many students
don't realize that a separate,
traditionally black fraternal sys
tem co-exists here.
These black fraternities, the
first of which was founded in 1906

at Cornell University, exist at uni
versities across the country. The
original black fraternities were
started because their leaders were
shunned at established white fra
ternities. Today, however, these
groups are not exclusively black.
Stanford's first black fraternity,
Alpha Phi Alpha, was founded in
1978, and currently has 13 mem
bers. Kappa Alpha Psi and Omega
Psi Phi, with 21 and 10 members
respectively, have since joined the
Alphas as organizations that pro
vide brotherhood and opportunity
for public service to black men on
campus.
Because the only contact most
students have with the black fra
ternities is witnessing their vis
ually striking pledge rituals, many
misconceptions and questions
have been bred. Most notably,
rumors of hazing have plagued
the system.
Charges of hazing have historically
been a problem for black fraternities
on a national level. The worst incidents
have included harsh beatings and
branding the skin of pledges with a
fraternity's insignia.
At North Carolina A&T, for example,
the Omega Psi Phi pledge class of 1986
was brutally hazed. According to Steven
Jones, the dean of pledges of the A&T
Omegas at the time, "dirt was poured
on the floor. Kerosene and charcoal fluid
were then poured on the dirt and it
was lit, . . . and they (the pledges) were
directed to walk through it."
Says Jones of hazing, "It's deeply em
bedded within black fraternities." But,
he added, "that might be different at
Stanford."
Fraternal Affairs Adiviser Joe Pisano
said that although he has heard
"rumors" of hazing in black fraternities
here, he hasn't "come across anything
concrete." He added that he "doesn't
have a problem with pledges dressing
alike."
Alpha Phi Alpha member Mark
Garner, who presides over the Black
Greek Letter Council (BGLC), says
hazing is not a problem at Stanford.

According to Garner, hazing is much
more of an enigma for black fraternities
in the South.
Garner said no complaints of physical
harm being inflicted upon pledges have
been brought before the BGLC, which
governs the three black fraternities and
two black sororities here.
In black fraternities, "the line," or
group going through the pledge process,
is often required to wear identical cloth
ing or march in silence to build unity.
Garner said this "does not constitute
hazing anymore than making a pledge
run naked through campus," something
that pledges in traditional fraternities
have had to do.
The process is a trial of a person's
ability to commit to brotherhood, ac
cording to Stanford Omega Psi Phi
President Brian Bryant, who claimed
rumors of hazing are false. "The pledges
are exposed to the elements deemed
necessary for fraternity life," he said.
The pledge classes of each fraternity
are also required to do at least one
service project.
Still, the image of unusual pledge
rituals was almost enough to scare
Kappa Alpha Psi member Francois
Charles away from joining a black fra
ternity. He envisioned the black frater
nal pledge process as "something in
tense" and considered rushing Sigma

Chi and Theta Delta Chi fraternities,
two predominantly white fraternities.
But, after meeting several members
of Kappa Alpha Phi, he felt their fra
ternity was "more a representative of
myself." In retrospect, Charles says"the
pledge process was worth it."
Senior Brett Mahoney, also a Kappa,
agreed, saying the process is not in
tended to attract attention, but "some
thing we feel needs to be and
something we suffer the consequences
for reputation-wise."
If a pledge successfully completes this
two-month test, he is "inducted onto
line."
But how does a black fraternity go
about selecting the individuals that end
up pledging? Their process is much dif
ferent than the one employed by main
stream fraternities, and it is no easy
task.
Instead of attending parties and social
activities, students interested in joining
black fraternities complete a written ap
plication and an interview.
Although traditionally black, these
brotherhoods are not closed to non
black students. Both Kappa Alpha Phi
and Alpha Phi Alpha have Latino mem
bers, and whites have been members of
black fraternities at other colleges.
If, after reviewing an applicant, a
black fraternity wants to invite a stu
dent to join its organization, it offers
an "acceptance to line" to the student.
The student can accept or decline the
offer. Upon acceptance, he becomes part
of a line, similar to the pledge class of
traditional fraternities, and begins
pledge activities.
Because black fraternities emphasize
civic involvement over social interac
tion, they contribute a great deal of
time to both local and national public
service programs. Alpha Phi Alpha, for
instance, focuses on providing service
to senior citizens of the East Palo Alto
community, while Omega Psi Phi helps
coordinate the Omega Boys Club in Val
lejo.
Charles, who serves with his brothers
as mentors in the East Palo Alto Youth
Development Center, said he found
public service with his fraternity valu
able. "It's probably not something I
would have done on my own," the soph
omore said. "Having the fraternity's
name behind you makes it much easier
to get things done."
Accoding to Garner, "Our focus is
public service, but the system is built
on the tenet of brotherhood."

ated into black fraternities during
the past two weeks, pushing the
organizations' total membership
to 44.
Because so much attention is
given to the mainstream frater
nities on campus, many students
don't realize that a separate,
traditionally black fraternal sys
tem co-exists here.
These black fraternities, the
first of which was founded in 1906

at Cornell University, exist at uni
versities across the country. The
original black fraternities were
started because their leaders were
shunned at established white fra
ternities. Today, however, these
groups are not exclusively black.
Stanford's first black fraternity,
Alpha Phi Alpha, was founded in
1978, and currently has 13 mem
bers. Kappa Alpha Psi and Omega
Psi Phi, with 21 and 10 members
respectively, have since joined the
Alphas as organizations that pro
vide brotherhood and opportunity
for public service to black men on
campus.
Because the only contact most
students have with the black fra
ternities is witnessing their vis
ually striking pledge rituals, many
misconceptions and questions
have been bred. Most notably,
rumors of hazing have plagued
the system.
Charges of hazing have historically
been a problem for black fraternities
on a national level. The worst incidents
have included harsh beatings and
branding the skin of pledges with a
fraternity's insignia.
At North Carolina A&T, for example,
the Omega Psi Phi pledge class of 1986
was brutally hazed. According to Steven
Jones, the dean of pledges of the A&T
Omegas at the time, "dirt was poured
on the floor. Kerosene and charcoal fluid
were then poured on the dirt and it
was lit, . . . and they (the pledges) were
directed to walk through it."
Says Jones of hazing, "It's deeply em
bedded within black fraternities." But,
he added, "that might be different at
Stanford."
Fraternal Affairs Adiviser Joe Pisano
said that although he has heard
"rumors" of hazing in black fraternities
here, he hasn't "come across anything
concrete." He added that he "doesn't
have a problem with pledges dressing
alike."
Alpha Phi Alpha member Mark
Garner, who presides over the Black
Greek Letter Council (BGLC), says
hazing is not a problem at Stanford.

According to Garner, hazing is much
more of an enigma for black fraternities
in the South.
Garner said no complaints of physical
harm being inflicted upon pledges have
been brought before the BGLC, which
governs the three black fraternities and
two black sororities here.
In black fraternities, "the line," or
group going through the pledge process,
is often required to wear identical cloth
ing or march in silence to build unity.
Garner said this "does not constitute
hazing anymore than making a pledge
run naked through campus," something
that pledges in traditional fraternities
have had to do.
The process is a trial of a person's
ability to commit to brotherhood, ac
cording to Stanford Omega Psi Phi
President Brian Bryant, who claimed
rumors of hazing are false. "The pledges
are exposed to the elements deemed
necessary for fraternity life," he said.
The pledge classes of each fraternity
are also required to do at least one
service project.
Still, the image of unusual pledge
rituals was almost enough to scare
Kappa Alpha Psi member Francois
Charles away from joining a black fra
ternity. He envisioned the black frater
nal pledge process as "something in
tense" and considered rushing Sigma

Chi and Theta Delta Chi fraternities,
two predominantly white fraternities.
But, after meeting several members
of Kappa Alpha Phi, he felt their fra
ternity was "more a representative of
myself." In retrospect, Charles says"the
pledge process was worth it."
Senior Brett Mahoney, also a Kappa,
agreed, saying the process is not in
tended to attract attention, but "some
thing we feel needs to be and
something we suffer the consequences
for reputation-wise."
If a pledge successfully completes this
two-month test, he is "inducted onto
line."
But how does a black fraternity go
about selecting the individuals that end
up pledging? Their process is much dif
ferent than the one employed by main
stream fraternities, and it is no easy
task.
Instead of attending parties and social
activities, students interested in joining
black fraternities complete a written ap
plication and an interview.
Although traditionally black, these
brotherhoods are not closed to non
black students. Both Kappa Alpha Phi
and Alpha Phi Alpha have Latino mem
bers, and whites have been members of
black fraternities at other colleges.
If, after reviewing an applicant, a
black fraternity wants to invite a stu
dent to join its organization, it offers
an "acceptance to line" to the student.
The student can accept or decline the
offer. Upon acceptance, he becomes part
of a line, similar to the pledge class of
traditional fraternities, and begins
pledge activities.
Because black fraternities emphasize
civic involvement over social interac
tion, they contribute a great deal of
time to both local and national public
service programs. Alpha Phi Alpha, for
instance, focuses on providing service
to senior citizens of the East Palo Alto
community, while Omega Psi Phi helps
coordinate the Omega Boys Club in Val
lejo.
Charles, who serves with his brothers
as mentors in the East Palo Alto Youth
Development Center, said he found
public service with his fraternity valu
able. "It's probably not something I
would have done on my own," the soph
omore said. "Having the fraternity's
name behind you makes it much easier
to get things done."
Accoding to Garner, "Our focus is
public service, but the system is built
on the tenet of brotherhood."


A "line" of Omega Psi Phi pledges march past the Post Office last week during
the last phase of the pledge process.
Wearing bright gold gloves,
boots, purple T-shirts and black
berets, toting lanterns and
shields, three Omega Psi Phi
pledges marched about campus
for several hours last Friday. This
marked the final day of pledge
activities for these men. They
would now "cross" into the ranks
of one of Stanford's three tradi
tionally black fraternities.
In all, 11 students were initi
ated into black fraternities during
the past two weeks, pushing the
organizations' total membership
