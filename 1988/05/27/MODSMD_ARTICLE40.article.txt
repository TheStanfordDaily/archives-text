# Odd fortunes of women's golf continue at Championships
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
For the second
straight day,
Stanford fresh
man golfer Jodi
Figley was, in
golfing terms,
"knocking down

the stick."
Figley hit 16 greens in regula
tion yesterday en route to her
second straight even-par 74, and
sits six strokes out of first place
with two rounds to play at the
NCAA Championships at the
New Mexico State Golf Course
in Las Cruces, N.M.
"It's crazy," a surprised Figley
said. "It was just hit-it-on and
two-putt all day long."
Figley was hitting the ball
much closer to the flagstick than
Wednesday, when she hit every
green on the course in regula
tion.

'It's not that I'm
doing anything
wrong, but I'm
really not doing
anything right.'
— Kay Cornelius

"I just couldn't get the putts
to drop," she said. "It's not that
I'm misreading greens, and my
putting stroke isn't bad, it's just
that they're not falling."
According to Stanford Coach
Tim Baldwin, Figley had a birdie
opportunity "on practically
every hole."
"I think the putts will start
dropping," Figley said. "I just
have to keep hitting it the way
I am."
A bit less fortunate than
Figley was senior teammate Kay
Cornelius, who opened with a
bogey and a double-bogey on the
first two holes, then shot even
par the rest of the way, finishing
with 77 to put her at 155 midway
through the tournament.
"It's not that I'm doing any
thing wrong," Cornelius said,
"but I'm really not doing any
thing right."
Thirteen strokes ahead of Cor

nelius and sitting atop the leader
board again today is Eva Dahloff
of Oklahoma State. Although
she managed to shoot only even
par yesterday for a two-day total
of 142, she maintains a one
stroke lead over Jacque Vigil of
host New Mexico State.
Also in the hunt are Lana Per
hacs of UCLA and Evelyn Orley
of Duke, who are tied for third
at 144. One more stroke back is
Buffy Klein of Miami (Fla.).
A total of seven players are
tied for sixth, but all are well
within striking distance of the
leader. Denise Philbrick of San
Jose State, Tulsa's Melissa
McNamara, Jean Bartholamew

of Duke, defending World
Amateur Champion Michiko
Hattori of Texas, Arizona's Kris
Hoos, Sarah Nicklin of Florida
State and Jayne Lohr of Ken
tucky all have two-day totals of
146.
The team standings are al
most equally bunched, as lighter
winds yesterday permitted some
teams to play catch-up after
being buried by two hours of
delays Wednesday. Oklahoma
State, thanks to its opening
round of 291, still leads, but only
by two strokes, as the Cowboys
shot 301 yesterday and stand at
592. New Mexico State came
back with a 295 to pull within

two strokes of the lead. Tulsa
came back after being hurt by
delays on the opening round
with a 292 and is in third at 596.
Kentucky is trying to show
that it deserved the final at-large
bid, and is succeeding. The
Wildcats, who shot 300, are tied
with Duke at 597. The Blue
Devils rebounded from a disap
pointing 301 Wednesday with a
296 yesterday.
Georgia and Texas are tied at
598, with San Jose State and
Arizona another stroke back.
Top-ranked Arizona State pulled
to within striking distance yes
terday with a 295 and finished
out of the leader board at 600.



Senior Kay Cornelius got off to a slow start yesterday at the NCAA Championships, bogeylng and
double-bogeying her first two holes on the way to a 77. Cornelius is 13 strokes out of first place
with two rounds remaining.
