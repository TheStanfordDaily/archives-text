# Men's spikers nab blue-chip recruits
## 
### Chris Crader Editorial staff 
After ending an up-and-down season, the
Stanford men's volleyball team scored per
haps its biggest victory of the season this
month. Stanford Coach Fred Sturm an
nounced he has signed eight top high school
players to come to the Farm as members
of the class of 1992.
Topping the list that Sturm called "the
best recruiting class we have ever had" are
six blue-chippers. John Bezmalinovic, Dun
can Blackman, Dave Goss, Ryan Moos, Doug
Walquist and Chris Wrede all join the Car
dinal with impressive high school creden
tials. Additionally, John Hribar and Vincent
Smith said they will attend Stanford next
year.
The Cardinal was ranked 14th in the na
tion at the end of the 1988 season but
finished eighth in the 10-team Western In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association. Stanford
loses two starters to graduation but has
Scott Fortune returning for his senior
season next year in addition to the incoming
freshmen. Fortune stopped out this year to
train with the U.S. National Team and is
one of 16 players in camp vying for 12
Olympic spots on the world's top-rated
men's squad.
"We needed more passers," Sturm said.
"We need to improve the quality of passing,
our size and our depth. I think we were
pretty successful in accomplishing our goals.

"Their impact will be to raise the level
of play on the court, both in practices and
in matches. Everyone's going to become bet
ter because of this class."
Bezmalinovic, a 6-foot-5 middle blocker
from Fresno, is considered one of the top
four recruits in the nation at his position.
He is a very physical player with good
leaping ability.
Blackman is the brother of sophomore
Parker Blackman, the starting setter for the
Cardinal the past two seasons. Duncan
Blackman is a 6-4 outside hitter who will
"just get better and better physically," ac
cording to Sturm. He is a two-time high
school All-America and his Loyola (Los An
geles) High School teams have won the Cal
ifornia Interscholastic Federation state 3A
title the past two years.
Cross, who began his volleyball career as
a high school freshman, is a 6-4 middle
blocker. The explosive Santa Barbara native
had a very strong senior season.
Moos, a southpaw, is a two-time All-
America at Santa Monica High School,
which spent most of the season as the na
tion's top-ranked team. A 6-5 outside hitter,
Moos is a strong back-row hitter and a good
passer and just completed what Sturm called
a "great senior year."
Walquist is a 6-3 outside hitter from
Rancho Palos Verdes who, like the other
five, was heavily recruited by other national
powers. Sturm calls him "a pretty complete
player" who is very strong physically.

Their impact will be to raise
the level of play on the
court, both in practices and
in matches. Everyone's
going to become better be
cause of this class.'

Wrede, the only setter in the incoming
class, is a high school teammate of Black
man's at Loyola. At 6-3 he becomes the
biggest setter at Stanford since the 1985
season. He, Blackman and Moos attended
the U.S. Junior Elite training camp last
summer, held to develop the talents of the
top 36 high school players in the hopes they
may someday play for the U.S. National
Team.
Hribar, from Pittsburgh, Pa., is an outside
hitter with good leaping ability while Smith,
a West Islip, N.Y., native, has a limited
volleyball background but has good size and
athletic ability.
Although the quality of play in WIVA
continues to improve year after year, the
return of Fortune combined with this
recruiting class, called "right near the top,
if not at the top" nationally by Sturm, could
put Stanford right in the thick of things
next year.
