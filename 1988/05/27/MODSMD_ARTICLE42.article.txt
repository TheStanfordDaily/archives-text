### 
EDMONTON, Alberta — The Edmonton
Oilers, with Wayne Gretzky leading the way,
beat the Boston Bruins 6-3 yesterday night,
completing a four-game sweep to win the Stan
ley Cup for the fourth time in five years.
In establishing themselves as one of the
great teams in NHL history, the Oilers took
their place behind the Montreal Canadiens,
who won five straight Cups in the 1950s and
four straight in the 19705, and the New York
Islanders, who won four straight in the early
1980s.
The Oilers' four Cups have come in just
nine years of existence in the NHL. The
Bruins, by comparison have won only five in
64 years.
The Canadiens lead all Cup winners with 23.
Gretzky, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy
as the most valuable player in the playoffs,
had a goal and two assists as the Oilers scored
five straight goals to win the title they were
denied by Tuesday night's power failure that
blacked out Game 4 in Boston.
Gretzky, who also won in 1985, became
only the third player to win the Conn Smythe
twice. Bobby Orr and Bernie Parent were the
other two.
Gretzky now has 252 career points, by far
the most in NHL playoff history.
The Bruins led twice before Esa Tikkanen
tied the score with a power-play goal late in

the first period.
Ex-Bruin Mike Krushelnyski put Edmonton
ahead to stay 6:38 into the second period,
converting Kevin McClelland's passout, before
Gretzky made it 4-2 with his 12th goal of the
playoffs and 81st career tally.
Craig Simpson then scored with two seconds
left in the second period, chopping Gretzky's
pass out of the air and past Boston goaltender
Andy Moog.
The assist was Gretzky's second of the game
and 31st overall in the playoffs, breaking his
own playoff record.
In the third period, Tikkanen scored at 1:21
to give the Oilers a 6-2 lead before Kasper
scored his second goal of the night at 6:35.
As the final seconds counted down, the sel
lout crowd of 17,502 at the Northlands
Coliseum rose as one, cheering the Oilers,
who have won all four of their Cups at home.
Gretzky, one of nine Oilers who have been
on all four championship teams, was presented
with the Stanley Cup by NHL President John
Ziegler, and began the first of numerous vic
tory laps.
The crowd was still settling into their seats
when the Bruins jumped in front on Steve
Kasper's 11th goal of the playoffs just 43
seconds into the game.
Kasper fielded Randy Burridge's pass across
the slot and rammed it past goaltender Grant

Fuhr.
But Norm Lacombe tied it for Edmonton
when he took a pass from Craig Muni and
beat Moog from the right faceoff dot at 6:07.
Each team then scored a goal on the power
play, with Boston scoring during a two-man
advantage.
Ken Linseman gave the Bruins their last
lead by scoring his 13th goal of the playoffs,
knocking his own rebound through Fuhr's
pads at 9:44.
But the Oilers tied it at 15:03 when Tik
kanen's shot from a sharp angle hit Boston
defenseman Gord Kluzak, then deflected off
Moog and into the net.
Gretzky's assist was his 30th, tying his own
playoff record.
The Oilers went ahead to stay when Mike
Krushelnyski scored at 6:38 from the bottom
of the left circle, converting a perfect passout
from behind the net by Kevin McClelland and
beating Moog on the glove side.
Gretzky then gave the Oilers a two-goal
lead when he scored on the power play at 9:44.
Fans at the Northland Coliseum began
chanting, "Sweep, Sweep," following
Gretzky's goal.
The Oilers put the game away when Gretzky
set up Craig Simpson's goal with two seconds
remaining in the period.
