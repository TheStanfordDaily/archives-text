last 1:25 of the second overtime
yesterday night and the Boston
Celtics tied the NBA Eastern
Conference final series at 1-1
with a 119-115 victory over the
Detroit Pistons.
Johnson's heroics came after
Kevin McHale made only the
second 3-point basket of his
eight-year NBA career tying
the score 109-109 with five
seconds left in the first over
time.
A basket by Joe Dumars with
1:39 remaining in the second
overtime gave the Pistons a
115-113 edge, but Johnson tied
it with 1:25 to go, then hit two
free throws with 43 seconds
and two more with nine
seconds left to clinch the vic
tory.
The Celtics narrowly avoided
a 2-0 deficit in the best-of
seven series after having a 21-
game winning streak over the
Pistons at Boston Garden bro
ken Wednesday night.
The third and fourth games
of the series will be at the Pon
tiac Silverdome on Saturday
and Monday afternoons, with
Game 5 at Boston Garden on
Wednesday night.
Robert Parish had 26 points
for the Celtics, McHale 24,
Johnson 22 and Bird 18. Isiah
Thomas had 24 to lead the Pis
tons and was followed by
Vinnie Johnson with 21 and
Adrian Dantley with 20.
The Pistons didn't score a
point in the first two minutes
of the first overtime, but fell
behind only four points.
Thomas then had a free
throw and a three-point play,
tying the score with 1:04 to go,
then hit a 3-pointer with seven

seconds remaining for a 109-
106 lead.
McHale, l-for-21 in his eight
year career from behind the
3-point line, then tied the score
with five seconds left. He shot
the ball with his right foot
either on the line or very close
to it, but after several minutes'
of discussion by the officials,
the goal was ruled good and
worth three points.
The Celtics trailed 96-91
with 4:07 remaining as Pistons
backup center James Edwards
scored eight of his 18 points
to bring Detroit back from a
three-point deficit at the start
of the fourth quarter.
But Boston scored six
straight points, four of them
by a slumping Bird, to pull
ahead 97-96 with 1:55 left. The
lead changed hands four more
times, including a scoop shot
by Danny Ainge that put Bos
ton ahead 102-101 with 28
seconds left.
Dantley made one of two free
throws with 11 seconds left,
tying the score and setting up
the overtime. Bird, 6-for-18
from the field in regulation,
missed a jumper just before the
buzzer ending regulation.
Reserve guard Jim Paxson
had eight points in the second
period, doubling the number of
points the entire Celtics bench
scored in Boston's Game 1
defeat and helping the Celtics
grab a 53-46 halftime lead.
