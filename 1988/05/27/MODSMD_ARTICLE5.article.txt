# Fac Sen amends CIV
## Kennedy praises minority reaction to vigil 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
In response to questions raised over the
committee selection provision in the Cul
tures, Ideas and Values legislation, the Fac
ulty Senate voted yesterday to amend that
portion of the legislation.
Questions about the committee selection
provision were raised on April 28, when
Carlos Camargo, associate professor of
medicine, noted that it contradicted selec
tion criteria outlined in the Faculty Hand
book's Statement of Academic Freedom.
The statement specifies that an appli
cant's race, sex or ethnic origin will not
be considered as hiring criteria.
With the adoption of the amendment,
members of the Area One Committee will
now be selected on the basis of "academic
discipline, field of expertise and sensitivity
to issues of gender and ethnicity," instead
of "gender, ethnicity, academic discipline,
and field of expertise."
The amendment was proposed by the
senate's Committee on Committees after
a month of intensive study.
In other business, University President
Donald Kennedy addressed the senate on
Tuesday's Otero vigil and its aftermath.
Kennedy praised members of the Black
Student Union and others who encoun
tered the masked protestors at Otero for
their "extraordinary restraint" in respond

ing verbally rather than physically.
ASSU Graduate Senator Michele
Chiavacci asked Kennedy "how seven
people with candles can be considered a
threat when they're simply expressing
what they're distressed about."
Kennedy said that, given the context of
the situation, the vigil could be considered
"a threat" and that the community was
not comfortable with it.
Kennedy also called the protestors' apol
ogy issued on Wednesday a "courageous
and welcome one."
In response to questions by Council of
Presidents member Miguel Marquez, Ken
nedy agreed that the University needs to
educate students more about issues of race.
Also yesterday, the senate voted unani
mously to continue the undergraduate and
graduate programs in Humanities and
Latin American Studies.
Controversy over the coherence of the
Graduate Humanities Program prompted
the Committee on Graduate Studies to sug
gest that a task force be established to
address the concern.
The senate also voted to revise the re
quirements for the conferral of master's
and co-terminal master's degrees.
The revisions were adopted to ensure
that the master's degree retains its identity
as a graduate degree and not as a fifth
undergraduate year, according to
Russell Berman, chair of the Com
mittee on Graduate Studies.
Provost James Rosse also un
veiled a report summarizing Stan
ford's proposed building plans
from now until the year 2000,
including the $250 million
Campus Near West project.
Rosse said the report is "the
outer envelope of what we expect
to build." New plans may be pro
posed and some of the plans out
lined in the report may fall
through, but the report is the Uni
versity's "best guess," Rosse
added.
