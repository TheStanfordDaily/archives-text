# ASSU asks for student observers in USW talks
## 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
Students should be allowed to observe
contract negotiations between the Uni
versity and the United Stanford
Workers, the 19th ASSU Senate decided
last night in its inaugural meeting.
After hearing USW arguments in fa
vor of the idea, the senate unanimously
approved a bill urging the University to
allow neutral student observers during
contract talks. University officials did
not attend the meeting but have previ
ously said that the negotiations should
remain closed.
The bill does not seek any active
negotiating role for students, who would

only be observers. The student observers
would be selected by the ASSU Execu
tive Committee.
Negotiations for a new contract are
expected to occur this summer, as the
current contract expires Aug. 31.
Council of Presidents member Stacey
Leyton, co-author of the bill, said stu
dents should watch the negotiations to
ensure that "all members of Lhe com
munity are treated fairly." If contract
talks fail, as they did six years ago forc
ing a strike, she said students will "ob
viously" be affected and hurt.
In the past, Leyton said, both union
representatives and the University have
lobbied students during contract
negotiations. Leyton explained
that student observers would
"communicate to the student
body" the realities of negotiation,
so students could make an in
formed decision instead of being
forced to decide "which side of
the story we believe."
Linda Crouse, chief steward for
the USW, said student observers
would "make the negotiations
open and honest" and force the
University to be "accountable to
all elements of the community"
during negotiations. Crouse said
three workers currently observe
the talks, adding that "a few more
people as silent observers would
not disrupt anything."
However, former chief Univer
sity negotiator Patricia Wheeler
told The Daily yesterday that stu
dent observers would "give a fish
bowl atmosphere which would not
be conducive to negotiations." She
added that union representatives
and University officials together
provide the "most productive ne
gotiations," and that "non
involved people" lead to "a lot of
grandstanding."
Mike Vartain, the new Univer
sity negotiator, made similar
statements Wednesday arguing

against student observers.
Crouse was unsure whether
student observers are prece
dented, but USW field represen
tative Rodney Barnett said the
union is "not pinning up a new
concept for bargaining — they're
just observers."

In other business, the senate
chose freshman Aimee Allison as
deputy senate chair over sopho
more Frank Quaratiello and grad
uate student Chele Chiavacci.
Allison, a People's Platform
senator, said the deputy chair
should act as a "liaison between
all different components of the
ASSU." She said her main goal
is to ensure informed senate de
cisions, providing more back
ground for bills and improving
communication with committees.
The senate also allocated $2,000
of reserve money to send six stu
dent delegates to the U.S. Student
Association conference in Connec
ticut during July. Another $1,150
had previously been allocated or
donated.
