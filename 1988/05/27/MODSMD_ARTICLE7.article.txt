# Report calls for more student office space
## 
### Rob Burwell Staff writer 
The Committee on Student Or
ganizational Services last week
recommended a reorganization of
student activity facilities and new
construction to alleviate a short
age of student office space.
In a long-awaited report, the
committee stressed the impor
tance of giving student groups of
fice space, and stated that stu
dents "should not be unneces
sarily or arbitrarily hampered in
their efforts by the shoddy or the
inadequate."
Specific recommendations in
clude various short-term repairs
to existing facilities, which the
committee estimates will cost
$300,000, and long-term reorgan
ization and construction for which
no cost estimate was made.
SOS Director Michael Ramsey-

Perez, who authored the report,
said the short-term repairs will
be made as the money becomes
available. Plans include remodel
ing the outside of the Old
Firehouse and milking the Bridge
more structurally sound.
Ramsey-Perez said the commit
tee divided the campus into "three
neighborhoods" called the periph
ery, edge and the center of
campus. He added that several
offices are poorly located, noting
that offices such as the Women's
Center (now located in the Stan
ford Eating Clubs) would be bet
ter placed toward the center of
campus.
The report calls for the eventual
grouping of community centers
near the center of campus, office
and resource space on the edge
of campus and recreational and
technical activities toward the pe
riphery.

The report will be finalized next
fall after the committee receives
public feedback. It will then go to
the Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs for further review. "It will
ultimately be a tool for the Dean
of Student Affairs Office as a plan
for the future," he said.
The report calls for the creation
of "hubs" of related activities. As
an example, KZSU would be
moved out of the basement of
Memorial Auditorium and into a
building constructed on some land
behind the Storke Student Pub
lications Building, making a
"media and communications
hub." The basement of Memorial
Auditorium would then be avail
able for use as a performing arts
center.
The committee also hopes that
an addition to the Tresidder deck
will be converted into either office
and conference room space or

rooms suitable for exercise and
social activities. In addition, the
report recommends that both
LOTS and the Computer Science
offices now located in Tresidder
should be housed elsewhere.
Ramsey-Perez also stressed the
need for a new approach to man
agement of student activity space.
"Student activities are as im
portant as anything in the dorms.
They deserve support and to have
their space adequately main
tained," he said. "If we have them,
we should take care of them."
Another of the committee's
goals is to expand the proportion
of groups with office space from
one sixth to at least one half of
the approximately 335 groups on
campus, Ramsey-Perez said. In
cluded in this estimate are the
unhoused fraternities and sorori
ties that are presently not allotted
office space.
