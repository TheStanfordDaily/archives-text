Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch
or oven burner to turn or, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues
this facinating and ingenious book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that
ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology.
The author, a professor and the Director of the Institute for Cognitive Science at the
University of California, San Diego, has written a book aimed at raising the
consciousness of both consumers and designers to the delights of products that are
easy to use and understand.
