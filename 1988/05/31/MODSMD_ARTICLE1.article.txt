"The Rise and Fall of Great
Powers:
Economic Change and Military
Conflict from 1500 to 2000"
By Paul Kennedy
Random House, 1987
$24.95

Books about the erosion of
American power and standing
are popular items in these un
settled times. We can't seem to
get enough books about the
sorry state of the economy, the
end of American global suprem
acy, pedagogical mediocrity and
rampant "cultural illiteracy."
As a current cynical joke goes,
the study of the country's
decline is the only growth in
dustry left in the United States.
Unlike other pundits dissect
ing the nation's ills, Yale his
torian Paul Kennedy takes a
giant step away from the ex
amining table to see what is
happening to us in the sweep
of what he calls modem history,
the past 500 years of the (pri
marily European) Great
Powers.
From this vantage point and
without minimizing the actual
dilemma for policymakers, he
gently admonishes us that the
erosion of American preemi
nence is not unique, but rather
the unavoidable fate of all world
powers.
"It simply has not been given
to any one society to remain
permanently ahead of all the
others," he writes. In a comical
vein, he paraphrases a George
Bernard Shaw quip about the
decline of imperial England:
"Rome fell; Babylon fell;
Scarsdale's turn will come."

Lest there be any misun
derstanding, however, relatively
few pages of Kennedy's best
selling book are devoted to the
United States. His ambitious
work begins with a survey of
the world in 1500, when several
previously inconsequential (to
world history) European
kingdoms are about to become
great powers, and the ancient
empires of Asia and the Middle
East are in decay. The remain
ing pages recount the rise and
fall of the handful of states that
came to dominate international
affairs for the next 400 years
— the Astro-Hungarian empire,
Spain, Portugal, France, Ger
many and England. In the 20th
century, Russia, the United
States and Japan rise to replace
the aging imperial powers of
Western and Central Europe.
What accounts for this
parade of actors on and off his
tory's center stage?
Kennedy offers two inter
related arguments. One, and
the most basic for him, is that
economic and technological ad
vances inevitably provoke
changes in the social structures,
political systems, military might
and positions of individual
states in the world system.
But because these develop
ments in productive capacities
do not occur simultaneously in
all states nor with equal conse
quence (the revolution in
navigational science obviously
favored maritime nations like
England), Kennedy draws a sec
ond conclusion. Uneven eco
nomic growth affects the "rel
ative military power and
strategical position of the mem
bers of the states system." All

"major shifts in the world's
military-power balances have
followed alterations in the pro
ductive balances."
Even Great Power wars like
the Crimean War or World War
I did not alter, but only con
firmed, the underlying patterns
of international economic
strength — victory in these
wars, Kennedy writes, always
went to the side with the
greatest material resources.
It is not that military power
is irrelevant to Kennedy. It ob
viously helped acquire and
protect economic wealth for the
Great Powers. But the dilemma
for national leaders, as Kennedy
sees it, is that they must try
to avoid having military expen
ditures sap the very economy
that the military ostensibly
serves and protects.
For those to whom this tradi
tional concern sounds familiar,
Kennedy has little encourage
ment. The historical record, as

he sees it, shows that as the
relative economic strength for
previously "No. 1" countries
ebbed, "growing foreign chal
lenges to their position have
compelled them to allocate more
and more of their resources into
the military sector, which in
turn squeezes out productive in
vestment." The result is a self
induced downward spiral of
vitiated economic, and eventu
ally, military' power.
These gloomy implications
for the United States are much
of the reason "The Rise and
Fall of the Great Powers" has
attracted such attention. On the
one hand, conservative Jeanne
Kirkpatrick lambasted Ken
nedy's cautionary lesson about
the dangers of extravagant mil
itary spending as threatening
to U.S. security. On the other
hand, many liberals find that
Kennedy's argument supports
their own calls for efforts to
"reindustrialize" America.

Kennedy, who is from Eng
land, is no radical or iconoclast.
His views are of a British po
litical tradition that emphasizes
the mercantile over the mili
tary. Moreover, he is Eurocen
tric, despite his efforts to ex
pand his considerations beyond
that of a few states on one con
tinent. Japan's modernizaton
and rise as a world power, for
example, are poorly incor
porated into his presentation.
But particularly glaring is Ken
nedy's neglect of the revolt of
what we now call the Third
World, and its part in weaken
ing the European colonialists of
the 19th and 20th centuries.
Kennedy's favor of the term
"imperial overstretch," his eu
phemism for the increasing dif
ficulty of the Great Powers in
dominating those they have
conquered, betrays his
penchant for seeing the world

of the Great Powers. Their de
cisions, wise and foolish, wholly
determined international his
tory, it would seem from
reading this book. (Neither do
domestic politics, class struggles
and social movements play a
large role in his interpretation.)

But in fact it was the oppo
sition of the colonial and semi
colonial peoples to the imperial
powers that helped make em
pire and the need for ever
increasing military expendi
tures so costly, and eventually
so debilitating. Further marring
Kennedy's effort is his per
petuation of certain insulting
views of non-Europeans. Ac
cording to Kennedy, for exam
ple, the Japanese developed a

"habit" of launching military
surprise attacks, but also are
"discreet and subtle" in
diplomacy; a citizen of China is
called a "Chinaman."
Kennedy's strained treat
ment of the Vietnam War es
pecially reveals the weakness of
his effort to reduce the question
of national power to economics
alone. That a relatively poor
and technologically backward
nation such as North Vietnam

defeated the most economically
advanced country in world his
tory obviously does not serve
his thesis well.
The ruling classes of past
Great Powers thought that they
alone made world history. That
"Great Power mentality" was
part of their problem. As we
anticipate a future of greater
international interdependence
and multiple economic centers,
however, it would be better for

scholars to promote a point of
view that was more sensitive to
the widening distribution of
world power in its various pro
ductive, military, social and ide
ological aspects.

Lest there be any misun
derstanding, however, relatively
few pages of Kennedy's best
selling book are devoted to the
United States. His ambitious
work begins with a survey of
the world in 1500, when several
previously inconsequential (to
world history) European
kingdoms are about to become
great powers, and the ancient
empires of Asia and the Middle
East are in decay. The remain
ing pages recount the rise and
fall of the handful of states that
came to dominate international
affairs for the next 400 years
— the Astro-Hungarian empire,
Spain, Portugal, France, Ger
many and England. In the 20th
century, Russia, the United
States and Japan rise to replace
the aging imperial powers of
Western and Central Europe.
What accounts for this
parade of actors on and off his
tory's center stage?
Kennedy offers two inter
related arguments. One, and
the most basic for him, is that
economic and technological ad
vances inevitably provoke
changes in the social structures,
political systems, military might
and positions of individual
states in the world system.
But because these develop
ments in productive capacities
do not occur simultaneously in
all states nor with equal conse
quence (the revolution in
navigational science obviously
favored maritime nations like
England), Kennedy draws a sec
ond conclusion. Uneven eco
nomic growth affects the "rel
ative military power and
strategical position of the mem
bers of the states system." All

"major shifts in the world's
military-power balances have
followed alterations in the pro
ductive balances."
Even Great Power wars like
the Crimean War or World War
I did not alter, but only con
firmed, the underlying patterns
of international economic
strength — victory in these
wars, Kennedy writes, always
went to the side with the
greatest material resources.
It is not that military power
is irrelevant to Kennedy. It ob
viously helped acquire and
protect economic wealth for the
Great Powers. But the dilemma
for national leaders, as Kennedy
sees it, is that they must try
to avoid having military expen
ditures sap the very economy
that the military ostensibly
serves and protects.
For those to whom this tradi
tional concern sounds familiar,
Kennedy has little encourage
ment. The historical record, as

he sees it, shows that as the
relative economic strength for
previously "No. 1" countries
ebbed, "growing foreign chal
lenges to their position have
compelled them to allocate more
and more of their resources into
the military sector, which in
turn squeezes out productive in
vestment." The result is a self
induced downward spiral of
vitiated economic, and eventu
ally, military' power.
These gloomy implications
for the United States are much
of the reason "The Rise and
Fall of the Great Powers" has
attracted such attention. On the
one hand, conservative Jeanne
Kirkpatrick lambasted Ken
nedy's cautionary lesson about
the dangers of extravagant mil
itary spending as threatening
to U.S. security. On the other
hand, many liberals find that
Kennedy's argument supports
their own calls for efforts to
"reindustrialize" America.

Kennedy, who is from Eng
land, is no radical or iconoclast.
His views are of a British po
litical tradition that emphasizes
the mercantile over the mili
tary. Moreover, he is Eurocen
tric, despite his efforts to ex
pand his considerations beyond
that of a few states on one con
tinent. Japan's modernizaton
and rise as a world power, for
example, are poorly incor
porated into his presentation.
But particularly glaring is Ken
nedy's neglect of the revolt of
what we now call the Third
World, and its part in weaken
ing the European colonialists of
the 19th and 20th centuries.
Kennedy's favor of the term
"imperial overstretch," his eu
phemism for the increasing dif
ficulty of the Great Powers in
dominating those they have
conquered, betrays his
penchant for seeing the world

ple, the Japanese developed a

surprise attacks, but also are

diplomacy; a citizen of China is

Kennedy's strained treat
ment of the Vietnam War es
pecially reveals the weakness of
his effort to reduce the question
of national power to economics
alone. That a relatively poor
and technologically backward
nation such as North Vietnam

defeated the most economically
advanced country in world his
tory obviously does not serve
his thesis well.
The ruling classes of past
Great Powers thought that they
alone made world history. That
"Great Power mentality" was
part of their problem. As we
anticipate a future of greater
international interdependence
and multiple economic centers,
however, it would be better for

scholars to promote a point of
view that was more sensitive to
the widening distribution of
world power in its various pro
ductive, military, social and ide
ological aspects.

"The Rise and Fall of Great
Powers:
Economic Change and Military
Conflict from 1500 to 2000"
By Paul Kennedy
Random House, 1987
$24.95

Books about the erosion of
American power and standing
are popular items in these un
settled times. We can't seem to
get enough books about the
sorry state of the economy, the
end of American global suprem
acy, pedagogical mediocrity and
rampant "cultural illiteracy."
As a current cynical joke goes,
the study of the country's
decline is the only growth in
dustry left in the United States.
Unlike other pundits dissect
ing the nation's ills, Yale his
torian Paul Kennedy takes a
giant step away from the ex
amining table to see what is
happening to us in the sweep
of what he calls modem history,
the past 500 years of the (pri
marily European) Great
Powers.
From this vantage point and
without minimizing the actual
dilemma for policymakers, he
gently admonishes us that the
erosion of American preemi
nence is not unique, but rather
the unavoidable fate of all world
powers.
"It simply has not been given
to any one society to remain
permanently ahead of all the
others," he writes. In a comical
vein, he paraphrases a George
Bernard Shaw quip about the
decline of imperial England:
"Rome fell; Babylon fell;
Scarsdale's turn will come."
