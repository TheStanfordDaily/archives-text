The occupants of 11 Rue
Simon-Crubellier, a 100-room
apartment complex in Paris,
provide the raw material for a
truly novel approach to litera
ture.
Georges Perec, fascinated by
the possibilities of a literary ad
aptation of the jig-saw puzzle,
has retrieved in "Life, A User's
Manual," an organizing princi
ple that serves him well. The
denizens of the apartment com
plex emerge in 99 chapters to
become the pieces in an enor
mous puzzle. The plan is
nominally offered as a painting
project by one of the resident
artists, Serge Valene, who at
tempts to portray the life of the
complex on a single large
canvas. From this material,
Perec shapes his pieces.
A jig-saw is, after all, an ad
equate analog for the task of
the modern writer. This form
of puzzle is first and foremost
an accumulation of details,
some trivial, some important,
that have been organized in ad
vance by the artist.
The jig-saw has at its base a
pre-defined cast of familiar
characters. According to Perec,
the basic shapes can be divided
into three essential categories:
the little chaps, essentially
shaped like traditional gin
gerbread men; the double
crosses, spread-eagled gin
gerbread men with tails making
them cruciform when viewed
from above or below; and lastly,
the crossbars, those rarer but
useful pieces that serve to link
and bind the remaining char
acters. The reader then sorts
through the collection until the
dominant themes of the work
are perceived in their complete
ness.
By linking the basic figures,
the characters fall into place as
puzzle pieces in the pages of
the novel. The little chaps are
appropriately the minor char
acters, who are distinguished by
perhaps a single meaningful
trait. Their existence adds tex
ture and substance only to the
background of the novel. The
double crosses are the ironies
of life, the unforeseen results
that contradict expectations.
The crossbars are the mqjor
characters that tie together the
lesser characters, providing a
foreground for the work.
The lesson appears to be that
life is perceived and understood

only in fragments: isolated mo
ments of more or less associated
experience, reducing complex
data into meaningful units like
pieces of a puzzle. In just such
a way, Perec presents his char
acters in a series of epiphanies.
The most minor appear as little
chaps, the high point of whose
lives can be summed up in a
single episode. Often they are
united by an ominous linkage
to a double cross that adds
pathos to their existence. The
larger characters present a
richer and more intriguing
image, frequently provoking
our interest and our wonder.
The larger characters include
the eccentic artist Barltebooth.
Independently wealthy, Bar
tlebooth decides to endow his
life with an organizing principle
that is at once meaningless and
complete. In the absence of any
notable talent for the art of
watercolor, he subjects himself
to 10 years of tutelage under
the stern eye of an adept.
Thereafter, he proposes to paint
500 seascapes of identical for
mat in order to have them
turned into hand-crafted jig
saw puzzles. The next 20 years
would then be devoted to the
reassembly of the puzzles, res
toring them to the original in
tact, only to have each
destroyed at site of original
compostion with bleach.
The circularity of the project,
moving from creation to re
creation, destruction and finally
restoration to the starting point
of a blank sheet, proceeds with
manic insistence throughout
the novel. The project requires

a nemesis, the
master crafts
man, Gaspard
Winck 1 e r ,
who exercises
his consider
able talents to
the fabrica
tion of sur
perbly com
plex puzzles.
The two art
ists thus duel
to a dramatic
conclusion
and finally
triumph.
The double

crosses are often nasty in char
acter. The sad story of a little
chap, "good old" Dr.Dinteville,
the local G.P., is a case in point.
A chance finding of a 300-year
old medical tract by a distin
guished ancestor stirs his
curiosity about the historical
development of knowledge of
kidney function. Seeking out a
very distinguished former

teacher for guidance, he is pro
vided with contacts and sources
who can advance his project.
In the course of his research,
Dinteville uncovers serious
flaws in the texts of the most
eminent authorities in the field.
His academic adviser displays
little enthusiasm for the results
when, four years later, a 300-
page annotated manuscript is
completed. The professor re
gretfully informs Dinteville that
the scholarship is overstuffed,
the individual sections of the
book are each defective in their

own particu
lar way.
U ncowed
by the chilling
review, Din
teville circu
lates the
manuscript
among the
principal pub
lishers, who
universally
reject it. In
the face of
unanimous
disregard,
Dinte vi 11 e
abandons in

terest not only in the medical
research he had ambitions of
performing, but even in
medicine itself. The academic
adviser then proceeds to misap
propriate Dinteville's work,
turning it into four separate re
search papers that are widely
acclaimed.
The individual pieces of
Perec's puzzle are riddled with

innumerable mind games.
Literary references abound,
from the names of characters,
to whole texts borrowed from
great authors. An example is
the invocation voiced by the
pseudo-clairvoyant Ingeborg,
who earns her bread conjuring
the spirit of Mephistopheles to
permit the rich and powerful
to sell their souls to the fiend.
She recites verbatim Panurge's
greeting in the language of the
Antipodes that appears in chap
ter nine of the second book of
Pantagruel.
Indeed, like Rabelais, Perec
has an extraordinary fondness

for inventories, insistent recita
tions of the trivial physical sur
roundings of the characters.
Again, these serve as the busy,
meaningless pieces of the puzzle
that act as a frame for the sig
nificant events. Perhaps the in
ventories serve also as songs of
the diversity of life, or even of
the futility of materialism.
Whatever ultimate purpose
they may fulfill, they are the

only dull spots ill what is other
wise a spirited book.
Ironically, this is the author's
last novel, published six years
before his death in 1982. The
title, "Life, A User's Manual,"
aptly auggests that the process
of living is not self-explanatory.
Perec's characters are in dire
need of a guidebook, for the
puzzle of life is not easily solved,
particularly in view of the all
too frequent apppearance of the
double cross. Perec has shown
us its effect on the 100 odd
tenants of 11 Rue Simon-
Crubellier.

David Bellos has managed to
provide a seamless translation
that includes puns and word
games. Perhaps the greatest
puzzle of all is why it took 10
years for the English transla
tion to appear.
