"Emperor of the Air"

$15.95

Ethan Canin's first book both runs
against and embraces expectations,
much like the characters in his carefully
crafted short stories. The most unex
pected thing about "Emperor of the Air,"
perhaps, is that it has been lodged in
the upper boughs of the New York
Times best-seller list for a couple of
months now — quite an accomplishment
for a book of this type.
More expected is the fulfillment of
the impression anyone would get
opening this book and knowing that
Canin, now a fourth-year medical stu
dent at Harvard, took classes aplenty at
both the lowa Writers' Workshop and
in Stanford's Creative Writing Depart
ment. We're in for some heavy-duty
humanistic minimalism here. The
shadow of Raymond Carver practically
darkens the pages as you turn them.
To be fair, Canin's book is hardly the
empty, bloodless mansion David Leavitt
made it out to be in his review a few
months back. Leavitt fills his own fiction
with chic, gay angst-peddlers who, in

the manner of Horatio Alger, find their
orientations to be pleasurable com
modities after all, and with housewives
going through chemotherapy whose
epiphanies come, during lulls at philan
thropic parties, in the form of midgets
ex machina in their suburban kitchens.
So Leavitt is hardly an exemplar
against whom to compare Canin — in
spite of other faults, Canin manages to
leaven sentimentality with at least a
notion of what honest doubt and pain
mean.
Canin tries to run the fictional gamut
and doesn't quite succeed. His fictional
voice stays much the same throughout
the collection, still and small, but that
consistency is at odds with the range of
characterizations and situations Canin
is trying to exploit.
There are nine stories. One is about
a Jewish medical student (I wonder
where that idea came from?), two are
about geriatrics in existential throes,
four are about 16- or 17-year-old boys.
One is told in a woman's voice. The
ninth is told in the character of a high
school gym teacher.
This might not seem like much of a
range of characters, especially consider
ing that all the stories are set either in
lowa, New York or Southern California,

but when you stop to remember that
roughly the same touch is brought to
both the old-man tales and to all four
of the young-boy tales, you begin to
wonder about the depth of the mastery
Canin had over these stories as he wrote
them.
The uniform touch I refer to here is
the sort of warm-souled, populist, no
frills tack on fiction that has been the
rampage — some would say the scourge
— of short stories and fiction depart
ments all over the country ever since
Raymond Carver appeared on the scene.
The only person I've come across who's
made this kind of unadorned fiction
mean anything is Richard Ford, who
has, unlike Leavitt and others, managed
to maintain the strength of his voice
over the length of an entire novel ("The
Sports writer").
In general, however, the device seems
a contrivance, especially in the case of
Carver. His fictions, lauded as they are
in creative writing departments for their
economy and discipline, turn out in the
main to be intensely imaginative shells.
This is not to say every story should be
lavishly appointed, but I always come
out at the end of a minimal story feeling
gypped. It's not hard to guess
why. It's the same reason that
listening to Windham Hill
music is such a shortchanging
experience.
The theme of most of these
stories is the breach (of trust,
or communication, or security)
that comes to every human re
lationship of anj' reasonable
duration. The best story, the
title piece, has to do with an
elderly astronomer who con
fronts his own mortality one
day when an obnoxious neigh
bor threatens to cut down his
200-year-old elm tree because
it's infested with ants that could
harm the neighbor's own elms.
The breach here is with the old
man's view of himself — as a
reasonably secure person in a
reasonably comprehensible
world, as a man who never
thinks about taking risks be
cause it doesn't seem necessary.
Another excellent story is
"American Beauty," which pits
a young, wistful, dreamy adoles
cent (there are many of these
in this volume), Edgar, against
his older brother, Lawrence, the
proverbial family dark horse.
The catalyst for their conflict
is their in-between sister,
Darienne, a moody epileptic,
whom Lawrence teases to the
point of near-violence.
As the layers of the story un
fold, they reveal the darkness
in a family that, on the initial
page, seems merely like any
other family about to lose its
eldest son (Lawrence is leaving
home). More to the point,
Lawrence reveals something to
Edgar about himself; as the
summer progresses, he keeps
reminding his brother to "think
about what's important," that
he's going to tell him what that
something is at season's end.
When he finally does, Edgar
realizes his occasional internal
rumblings over Darienne aren't
exactly the out-of-the-way phe
nomena he's always assumed
they were.
There are many sparkling
things to "Emperor of the Air,"
but you you get tired, in spite
of the craftsmanship, of being

reminded of Canin's hovering,
avuncular presence. Stories are
supposed to pull you into their
world, like Alice into the
looking-glass, before you know
you've been moved. Canin
merely trips you up with the
awareness that what you are
reading is, after all, a story; and
you can see the earnestness as
his fingers poise themselves
tensely above the typewriter, as
he strives for the perfect bal
ance between cloying sentiment
and bare-bones brutalism, rhap
sodic description and poignant
omission, blunt dialogue and
passionate monologue.
This is probably a problem
endemic to all writers who take
Carver as their main influence.
The premise of minimalist fic
tion is that traditional, expan
sive stories, with their frequent
omniscient narration, sprawling
syntax and involved emotional
crises, are just too dandified for
the starkness of latter-day
feelings and conflicts.
In an era of crack wars and
international terrorism, the
dominant ethos here says it is
best to hone in on the lowest
common denominator, put it
under the microscope and find
out all we can about it.
The problem is that this sort
of approach usually ends up
producing something less than
art and something closer to a
mundane adherence to the
"slice-of-life" ethic. There is
nothing wrong with showing
simple people with simple con
flicts struggling through a
deceptively complex world, but
minimalism's line of attack is
to coerce the reader into con
cluding that a writer's charac
ters deserve either sympathy or
recognition, or that his worlds
deserve appreciation.
This is not the same thing
as having such appreciation
come almost as an afterthought,
as a quiet surprise an hour afler
having put the book down and
gone onto something else, as a
payment made for an earned
wage. Minimalists strike for
salaries they generally haven't
worked for.
