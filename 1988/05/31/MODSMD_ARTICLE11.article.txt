"Emperor of the Air"
By Ethan Canin
Houghton Mifflin, 1988
$15.95

Ethan Canin's first book both runs
against and embraces expectations,
much like the characters in his carefully
crafted short stories. The most unex
pected thing about "Emperor of the Air,"
perhaps, is that it has been lodged in
the upper boughs of the New York
Times best-seller list for a couple of
months now — quite an accomplishment
for a book of this type.
More expected is the fulfillment of
the impression anyone would get
opening this book and knowing that
Canin, now a fourth-year medical stu
dent at Harvard, took classes aplenty at
both the lowa Writers' Workshop and
in Stanford's Creative Writing Depart
ment. We're in for some heavy-duty
humanistic minimalism here. The
shadow of Raymond Carver practically
darkens the pages as you turn them.
To be fair, Canin's book is hardly the
empty, bloodless mansion David Leavitt
made it out to be in his review a few
months back. Leavitt fills his own fiction
with chic, gay angst-peddlers who, in

the manner of Horatio Alger, find their
orientations to be pleasurable com
modities after all, and with housewives
going through chemotherapy whose
epiphanies come, during lulls at philan
thropic parties, in the form of midgets
ex machina in their suburban kitchens.
So Leavitt is hardly an exemplar
against whom to compare Canin — in
spite of other faults, Canin manages to
leaven sentimentality with at least a
notion of what honest doubt and pain
mean.
Canin tries to run the fictional gamut
and doesn't quite succeed. His fictional
voice stays much the same throughout
the collection, still and small, but that
consistency is at odds with the range of
characterizations and situations Canin
is trying to exploit.
There are nine stories. One is about
a Jewish medical student (I wonder
where that idea came from?), two are
about geriatrics in existential throes,
four are about 16- or 17-year-old boys.
One is told in a woman's voice. The
ninth is told in the character of a high
school gym teacher.
This might not seem like much of a
range of characters, especially consider
ing that all the stories are set either in
lowa, New York or Southern California,

but when you stop to remember that
roughly the same touch is brought to
both the old-man tales and to all four
of the young-boy tales, you begin to
wonder about the depth of the mastery
Canin had over these stories as he wrote
them.
The uniform touch I refer to here is
the sort of warm-souled, populist, no
frills tack on fiction that has been the
rampage — some would say the scourge
— of short stories and fiction depart
ments all over the country ever since
Raymond Carver appeared on the scene.
The only person I've come across who's
made this kind of unadorned fiction
mean anything is Richard Ford, who
has, unlike Leavitt and others, managed
to maintain the strength of his voice
over the length of an entire novel ("The
Sports writer").
In general, however, the device seems
a contrivance, especially in the case of
Carver. His fictions, lauded as they are
in creative writing departments for their
economy and discipline, turn out in the
main to be intensely imaginative shells.
This is not to say every story should be
lavishly appointed, but I always come
out at the end of a minimal story feeling
