A granite turret in the north
ern moors of Scotland, the ideal
location for a gothic novel, turns
out to be the setting for begin
ning of this exciting, scientific
adventure tale. The adventure
is the race to discover endor
phins — morphine-like chemi
cals that naturally occur in the
human body and are responsi
ble for such common phenom
ena as "runner's high."
These discoveries, which oc-

Goldberg's tale also
demonstrates — as is
so often true in sci
ence — that people of
varying backgrounds,
nationalities, and
religions can be in
volved in the develop
ment of a significant
idea which has the
potential for enor
mous benefit to all of
human kind.

curred in the 19705, are well
chronicled from both a scientific
and a "human interest" or "ad
venture story" perspective by
JefT Goldberg, who bases his
book on interviews with the key
scientists. More importantly,

they serve to acquaint the lay
reader with one of most exciting
and important developments in
recent biology.
Goldberg tells his story in a
way that makes it accessible
and interesting to readers with
curiosity but no particular sci
entific knowledge. He deals di
rectly with the dreams, courage,
patience, boredom, hard work,
mistakes, frustrations, human
ity and avarice that comprise
the scientific endeavor.
Goldberg's tale also demon
strates — as is so often true in
science — that people of vaiying
backgrounds, nationalities and
religions can be involved in the
development of a significant
idea that has the potential for
enormous benefit to all of
humankind.
Adding local interest is the
fact that many aspects of the
stoiy and its development in
volve Stanford.
The discovery of the endor
phins stems from the work of
Hans Kosterlitz, a relatively
obscure pharmacological re
searcher working in difficult cir
cumstances in Aberdeen, Scot
land, where he settled after
fleeing Hitler's Germany.
In Aberdeen, in a small room
in an austere, cold, granite
building, Kosterlitz had previ
ously worked on the relation
between the structure of chemi
cal compounds and the way in
which they influenced muscle
contraction — good, thorough
science, but hardly portentious
of the revolutionary discoveries
to come.
For, indeed, Kosterlitz had a
revolutionary idea: He believed
that it was just possible that
the body naturally contained a
morphine-like compound. At

Tyr — Gly — Gly — Phe — Met

The chemical formula for enkephalin, the flve-amlnl acid long peptide shown here, is the "prize" of
one of the most exciting scientific "races" of the last decade.

the time, in the 19605, this now
mundane idea was so new that
Kosterlitz avoided even writing
about it for fear of being called
a crank.
Along with a young post
doctoral fellow, John Hughes,
Kosterlitz began to search for
the substance he posited.
Goldberg vividly describes the
persona] and physical agony of
the process for Hughes, who,
working in primative condi
tions, tried to isolate this "sub
stance X" from brain tissue.
Kosterlitz's insight sparked a
slew of new developments. Av
ram Goldstein, a brilliant pro
fessor of pharmacology at Stan
ford, postulated that the brain
might have receptors ("locks")
that could receive morphine
(the "key" that would fit into
the "lock").
Meanwhile, Huda Akil, a
Syrian working at UCLA, dis
covered that direct electrical
stimulation to parts of the brain
of animals greatly relieved the
perception of pain. Believing
that this new form of pain relief
might be similar to that which
was occasioned by morphine,
Akil injected the animals with
naloxone, a drug used to treat
heroin overdoses. Indeed, the
naloxone did reverse the effects
of the electrical stimulation.
Kosterlitz, hearing of Akil's
results, saw them as proof that

the brain produced its own mor
phine.
Goldberg details the race that
ensued among a series of sci
entific teams scattered across
the globe to be the first to ac
tually find this morphine of the
brain. That Hughes and Kos
terlitz did, in fact, "win" the
race serves poetic justice.
We now know that there are
in fact three families of genes
responsible for the production
of natural morphines, and that
from them are produced per
haps 20 different substances
which are somehow "like" mor
phine. These compounds are
still a mystery; but they have
been shown to be active in
regulating blood pressure,
breathing and many other vital
functions. One of these three
major families of endorphins
was discovered at Stanford by
Avram Goldstein.
One of the most interesting
aspects of the book is the in
sight into scientific communi
cation it imparts to the general
reader. The rush to find out
about these new chemicals was
a huge process; appropriately,
it acts as a case study in how
individuals, laboratories and
disciplines play off of each other
and interact in an almost or
ganic manner.
Goldberg is fascinated by sci
entific competition, the soap
opera part of science. Unfortu

nately, he does not deal with
the subject except as a search
for fleeting glory. It is quite a
bit more. The real "winner"
from such "races for discovery"
is the public. Each different
group found different things;
each added a thread to the
fabric of the mosaic which is
scientific knowledge. That their
efforts partially overlapped is
good — it is one of the checks
and balances scientists employ
to insure the validity of their
discoveries.
Moreover, each group per
ceived the problem differently.
Even though two people may
have the same idea, they ap
proach it in a variety of ways.
From the variety comes the dif
ferentiation which is part of the
power and richness of scientific
thought.
The book is a fast but fasci
nating read, and, from my ex
periences, it provides a gener
ally accurate depiction of both
the events and the passions in
volved. This general accuracy is
fortunate, for in all probability
the book has "set" the history
of the discovery. It is recom
mended reading to scientists
and humanists alike.
