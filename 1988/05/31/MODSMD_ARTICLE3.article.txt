"Becoming a Doctor:
A Journey of Initiation in Medical
School"
By Melvin Konner, M.D.
Viking, 1987
$19.95

"Becoming a Doctor" is Melvin Kon
ner's account of his rigorous clinical
training at Harvard Medical School.
Konner's brings to life
his rather unusual background.
Before entering medical school in his
mid-30s, Konner was a professor of an
thropology at Harvard. His successful
teaching career had included two years
of field work among the Kung San or
Bushmen, hunter-gatherers of the
African Kalahari.
However, even as a child Konner had
always wanted to be a doctor. Medical
school enabled him to satisfy both of
his professional desires: to train to be
a doctor and to immerse himself in a
new culture. His story can be read as
an anthropologist's field report on the
culture of medical school. As such, Kon
ner's report is an engrossing and critical
look at the third year of medical school.
Konner's retelling of the events of
clinical training is accurate. The training
is "hands on." Although heavily super
vised, medical students become directly
responsible for the care of patients.
He describes the daily routine on the
wards — rounds, "working up" patients,
procedures. He captures the pace, the
long hours, the frustrations of having
too little to offer chronically ill patients

and the joys of having a patient do well.
His dialogue is so realistic that he in
cludes a glossary of medical lingo.
Konner does not merely document
this process; he also criticizes it. He
chides physicians for being more con
cerned with protecting themselves than
offering health care. He relates instances
of attending physicians evading
legitimate questions, thereby shirking
teaching responsibilities. Konner also
criticizes his colleagues for not being
friendly (or interested in his prior career
and accomplishments).
Although this cold attitude may
prevail at Harvard, it is not consistant
with my experience at Stanford. Clinical
medicine is extremely social. Each day
is spent talking with people — patients,
nurses, other doctors. In addition, the
team on call will generally eat together
during its shift. This naturally leads to

social situations outside of the hospital.
Of course, sometimes you click with
your fellow workers — and sometimes
you do not. And, as in any environment,
there are people who are not friendly,
or worse, jerks. Konner appears to have
come across more than his share of the
latter.
Perhaps it is a reflection of the East
Coast, where, in contrast to here, med
ical training reflects less of a concern
for the welfare of the future physician.
For example, "call" — an institutional
ized all-nighter — tends to be every
third or forth night during residency at
Stanford versus every second or third
night at Harvard. It is also possible,
however, that Konner's personality
might have played a part in his negative
attitude.
Interestingly, Konner has chosen not
to pursue medicine as a career. After
graduating from medical school, he
spent a year at Stanford writing this
book. Then, he accepted at position in
anthropology at Emory University near
Atlanta. He continues to write on med
ical subjects and is a frequent con
tributor to the "Body and Mind" column
in the Sunday New York Times Maga
zine. His by line includes his M.D., and
he is described as "an anthropologist
and nonpracticing physician."
It is too bad that he did not chose to
complete an internship and residency.
It would be interesting to read his
thoughts on that process.
