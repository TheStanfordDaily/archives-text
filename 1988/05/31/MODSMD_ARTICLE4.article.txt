"When I came back on to
the ward that morning after
X-ray rounds, I found ... a
woman (patient) with multi
ple illnesses and a difficult
personality crying in the
arms of a nurse. None of
the nurses or residents
really liked her, but crying
made her suddenly endear
ing. Through her tears she
was talking about fear — of
the breast biopsy she had
unexpectedly been sched
uled for. She was not
afraid of the procedure but
of 'what they're gonna find.'
The nurse was simply com
forting this difficult lady —
touching, talking, saying
whatever was necessary,
including, at many mo
ments, nothing. Out in the
hall, after the patient had
settled down, I praised the
nurse and said, M have yet
to see a doctor do some
thing like that.'
