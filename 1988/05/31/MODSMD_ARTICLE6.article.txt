Here we have the Warholiza
tion of the American novel.
Since 1984, when Jay
Mclnerney hyped himself into
notoriety with the best-selling
"Bright Lights, Big City," the
New York publishing scene has
been besieged by a goony cadre
of young, suit-wearing fiction
writers who think the key to
the good novel is the number
of oblique references to hot
brand names they can drop in
the cauldron. They have been
called the Brat Pack by those
who do not share this particular
notion of the way fiction works
— those, in other words, who
still hold stock by the tried-and
true device of strong charac
terization.

Lauren and Paul and
Sean and Lorna and
Beba and Rupert
must smoke enough
Kents and pop
enough ludes to keep
the tobacco and phar
maceutical industries
in business for the
next quarter century.

The fiction itself is suppos
edly ideally geared for the big
screen, with its slick pacing and
cynical odor, but judging from
the paleness of films like "Less
than Zero," even that supposi
tion stands on slippery ground.
The only good thing the move
ment has produced, in fact, has
been a halfway listenahle movie
soundtrack ("Bright Lights"
again). If someone tells you to
go buy "A Cannibal in Manhat
tan" or "Less than Zero," go
buy the soundtrack instead. Or,
better yet, buy a collection of
Bukowski or Richard Ford to
serve as an antidote to this
proliferant yuppie-angst genre.
Ellis' second novel is
moderately more interesting
than his first, but only because
he grounds it in an environ
ment he seems to know (or is

able to pretend knowing) some
thing about — the college
campus. Ellis went to Ben
nington, folks, and he's not
going to let us forget it. His
photo on the inside of the dust
jacket is clearly meant to convey
the image that he is a disciple
of Camus — the lighting is
packed with grim shadow, the
expression on the dimpled face
is ferociously morose. The only
thing lacking is the cigarette.
The characters make up for
that, though. Lauren and Paul
and Sean and Lorna and Beba
and Rupert must smoke enough
Kents and pop enough ludes to
keep the tobacco and phar
maceutical industries in busi
ness for the next quarter cen
tuiy. The characters, let's make
it clear from the start, are not
anything like the typical college
student — that'd be boring.
Ask yourself a question or
two before you decide to read
this novel:
• Do I really want to read a
book that's written as a series
of rambling (drug-induced,
natch) monologues and which
therefore goes to the least
trouble possible to convey any
sense of the physical world the
characters inhabit?
• Do these characters notice
things like clouds changing
shape in the firmament or oak
trees dropping leaves?
No. That'd be boring. The
limit of Ellis' descriptive powers
goes to the following: "From
where I stood in the darkened
living room of Booth I could
see him in the light coming
from the bathroom down the
hallway."
• Do I really want to read a
book in which each and every
character witnesses sex as a
commodity to be exchanged at
the behest of whatever whim
strikes him at the moment?
But sex with passion, pain
and pleasure would be boring.
So every narrator in the novel
is good-looking, terrified that
people will only like him for his
good looks (a typically disgust
ing Brat Pack theme), inter
ested in other human beings
only when they fulfill the cri
terion of "gd bod" (personals'
style) and couldn't care less
about said specimen after the
sack has been warmed up with
the spillage of their bodily fluids
all over its sheets.
Let's assume, for the sake of
casual argument, that I wanted
to read a novel full of sexual
boredom. I'd go buy Jackie Col
lins' new book. Let's further
assume I wanted to read a novel
in which every character wears
his heterosexuality on his

sleeve, as something to be
changed for less conventional
orientations every time the
mood strikes (and frequently
even when no mood strikes at
all — these characters aren't
exactly human, remember).
I'd go look for an author who
could convince me he knew that
something as consequential as
sexual orientation is not some
thing that one changes like a
brand of deodorant. (David
Leavitt would at first appear to
fit this bill, but with the sen
timental overload his last novel,
"The Lost Language of
Cranes," dumps on its reader,
you realize how deceptive ap-

pearances can be.)
Ellis wants us to be shocked
by his world, full of its self
referential language, its
hedonistic rituals, its pseudo
collegiate thrashings and gnash
ings. He wants us to sympathize
with the character (her
monologues are written in
italics) who commits suicide at
the end because the bisexual
guy ignores her. He wants us
to be drawn in by his use of
ultra-trendy laconic dialogue
and chic-beyond-chic run-on
sentences to make his point
about the narcotized alienation
of his mythical Eastern campus.
But Ellis' earnestness is as
fake as it sounds. Reading "The
Rules of Attraction" is exactly
like taking drugs, minus the ad
diction.
Most books start with the
premise that they are going to
contribute something to ex
panding the reader's picture of
reality, whether it's by letting
him know something he didn't
know before, or by cluing him
in to something that was
lurking below the threshold of
his consciousness.
Ellis' novels are the first I've
ever read that start from the
mirror image of that premise.
They suck from you and impose

on your patience like a leech
with their overreliance on slack
language and lazy characteriza
tion, and leave you feeling like
a dried-out shell by the time
their last page ends (usually
with a sentence fragment). Ellis
thinks he's letting you in on
some vast secret about the
youth of America, but he's
really taking away from your
knowledge of it by replacing
true experience with shuck
sterish cons, overdramatized
metaphors and hopeless cliches.
There is, granted, a certain
unexplainable intrigue about
reading a book so unrelentingly
hostile about human nature

that reading it saps your faith.
But you are left with nothing
from this book's conclusion but
a sour taste in your mouth —
like you've just woken up hung
over on one of the tattered
couches at Ellis' fictional insti
tution of higher learning.
Saperstein, one of whose ear
lier novels bears the classic title
"Mom Kills Kids and Self
(sounds like a song Big Black
would write), is a far more
promising author, partly be
cause he writes a book that,
rather than buying into the
Brat Pack's self-conscious atti
tudes, satirizes them.
"How Old Was Lolita?" is a
book about a group of self
satisfied yuppie pals (the type
you could visualize watching
"thirtysomething" every Tues
day night) who constantly get
together and play Trivial Pur
suit and sip cappuccino and con
gratulate one another's suc
cesses. One's a ghostwriter,
one's a computer trouble
shooter, one's an ad planner,
one's a paralegal, one's a
epidemiologist and the nar
rator, Roger, is a jazz musician
who's thinking of going into
film consulting. In his words,
"We all have jobs or specialties
that did not exist 10 years ago.

We forced the world to create
these jobs by how important
and impressive and indispen
sable we made our specialties
look on our resumes."
The crux of the novel's drama
is that the circle of perfect
friends gets torn to shreds by
the narrator's brother, a
decidedly untrendy type who
shows up out of Roger's dark
past, plunks his dirty trunk in
the middle of the friends' lives,
and goes to work farting, belch
ing, and grunting his way into
Roger's wife's extramarital af
fections.
Basically, it's the old per
sonification of evil gimmick, but

it works well here. Roger goes
nuts trying to prove that his
brother's actually bedding his
wife, and he keeps a computer
file that he enters to list every
irrational thing his wife does.
(She loses a ring he buys her
in a jacuzzi and doesn't bother
to look for it afterward!) He
stands by helplessly while weird
things (things he suspects his
evil brother is behind) start
happening to not only his pre
viously scintillating spouse, but
his pert friends as well. The
computer troubleshooter's
daughter starts getting on
drugs; the epidemiologist starts
making untoward career
changes. You're drawn in by
the relentless pathology of
Roger's brother and by the
equally pathological inability of
Roger to do anything about the
chaos his brother has wrought.
"Lolita" is a good book to
read at the beach. It's breezily
written, almost too breezily at
times. But it tells a neat story,
and it tells it without any of
the coyly jaded gunk that Ellis'
book waves in your face. It's
also pleasantly sardonic. What
more could you want?
