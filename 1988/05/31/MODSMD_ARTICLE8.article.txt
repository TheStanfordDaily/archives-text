"Season Ticket"

When I was younger — late
in grade school and early in
high school — two authors
helped me expand my vocabu
lary.
One was famous English
novelist Charles Dickens; the
other was not-so-famous Amer
ican baseball writer Roger An
gell.
Both authors, with their huge
vocabularies and complete will
ingness to use a big word when
a smaller one would do just fine,
sent me scurrying to the dic
tionary once a page or so. Be
cause of that, Dickens and An
gell, though they are strange
bedfellows, are somehow linked
in my mind.

And maybe the connection
isn't so strange after all. Angell,
really, is the Dickens of baseball
writing: erudite, expansive and
witty. Like Dickens, Angell is
an elegant prose stylist.
The comparison is not meant
to trivialize Dickens, but rather
to laud Angell for the literary
flair and sensitivity he brings
to the diamond. Unlike so many
people who write books about
baseball, Angell is a writer who
happens to love baseball, not a
baseball player who decided
he'd give writing a try, just for
the fun of it or to make a quick
buck.
And it shows. Sure, Angell is
sometimes a bit too egg headed
for his own good, but it's
refreshing to find a writer who
loves baseball enough to invest
this much style and thought in
it.
Any baseball fan has got to

envy the life Angell leads. He
wanders the nation —
seemingly at his own discretion
— observing baseball games,
and then every three months
or so he summarizes his obser
vations in a lengthy article in
The New Yorker magazine.
Then, every five years or so, he
puts those lengthy articles to
gether in a lengthy book.
"Season Ticket" is his fourth
book of this kind. The others
are "The Summer Game,"
"Five Seasons" and "Late In
nings."
Angell's pieces sometimes
seem disjointed when put to
gether in book form, and certain
favorite vocabulary words —
like "effulgent" and "epochal"
— pop up repetitively, as they
wouldn't if he were writing all
the pieces at once.
But more oflen one gets the
impression that Angell's
smooth, image-laden writing is
more suited to books than to
magazines anyway.
He continuously dazzles:
• Of New York Yankees first
baseman Don Mattingly, he
writes, "Mattingly is not
notably burly or overmuscled
.. . but, watching him at the
plate, you notice that he is a
package of triangles — neck,
arms, torso, thighs — that to
gether mesh and turn on a pitch
like a drill press."
• Of the Chicago Cubs, he
writes, "This famous rustbuck
et, the good ship Cubbie, last
dropped anchor in the shining
harbor of the World Series in
1945."
• Of the ofT-season, he writes,
"Baseball is well into its wing
less, or black-tie, dormant
phase, and the only sound from
within the cocoon is the cus
tomary late-autumn murmura
tions of rumors and awards,
plus a steady low whine of com

plaint about the season just
past."
Angell has a special knack for
casting his eye on undiscovered
or overlooked parts of the game
— he devotes a chapter here to
the art of catching, and another
to playing the infield — and for
getting inside the minds of
players, managers and other
people associated with baseball.
That ability is probably most
obvious in a funny and poignant
chapter on Kansas City Royals
reliever Dan Quisenberry, an
odd, submarine-style thrower
who dominated American
League hitters in the early
1980s but has lost his form in
the last few seasons.
Quisenberry clearly is one of
Angell's favorites — Angell
makes no bones about these
kinds of things — and the au
thor paints a lovely portrait of
a player who is seemingly un
affected by his tremendous suc
cess, and who is just as mys
tified by that success as he is
by his later struggles.
Angell describes Quisenberry
as "quick and comical, and
much given to startingly free
form images and put-ons during
interviews."
Quisenberry takes Angell on

a hilarious tour of the bullpen
area in Royals Stadium and ex
plains his "agreement with the
ball":
"On another day," Angell
writes, "he (Quisenberry) sud
denly asked, 'Have I ever told
you about my agreement with
the ball?' I said no, and he said,
'Well, our deal is that I'm not
going to throw you very hard
as long as you promise to move
around when you get near the
plate, because I want you back.
So if you do your part we'll get
to play some more.' He watched
my reaction to this with con
siderable relish, and then
elaborated in less Oz-like fash
ion."
"Season Ticket" is liberally
sprinkled with such moments
of humor and radiance. Love of
baseball is really what Angell's
book is about, and if the au
thor's prose sometimes turns
purple, it's only because his pas
sion for the game gets the better
of him. That's excusable.
Angell's writing takes base
ball off the sports pages and
the television sets and lifts it
into the realm of the uncom
mon.

The game endures: Willie Mays, in Game One of the 1954 World
Series, running to snag Vic Wertz's 460-foot drive to deep center.
Mays' catch saved the game for the Giants.
