"Baseball is not life itself, although
the resemblance keeps coming up.
It's probably a good idea to keep the
two sorted out, but old fans, if they're
anything like me, can't help noticing
how cunningly our game replicates
the larger schedule, with its beguiling
April optimism; the cheerful rough
house of June; the grinding, serious,
unending (surely) business of mid
summer; the September settling of
accounts, when hopes must be
traded in for philosophies and brave

smiles; and then the abrupt running
down of autumn, when we wish for
— almost demand — a prolonged
and glittering final adventure just
before the curtain. But nowhere is
this metaphor more insistent than in
baseball's sense of slippage; our rue
ful, fleeting awareness that we tend
to pay attention to the wrong things
— to last night's rally and tomorrow's
pitching match-up — while lesser and
sweeter moments slide by unper
ceived."
