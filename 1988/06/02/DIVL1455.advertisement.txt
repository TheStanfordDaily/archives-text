YOUR CREDIT UNION VISA -
MORE FOR LESS
In addition to convenience, a VISA
from Stanford Federal Credit Union
means savings. It's one of the most
cost-effective credit card programs
around.
LOW FINANCE CHARGES
Because we're a nonprofit financial
institution, and because our members
are more conscientious about making
their payments than the average
cardholder, we can afford to charge
much less in interest than other
institutions - just 15% APR.
LOW ANNUAL FEE
At Stanford Federal Credit Union, you
pay a low annual fee — just $12 —
substantially less than most financial
institutions. Even if you have more
than one card on your VISA account,
you pay no additional annual fee. And
the Credit Union never charges a
per-transaction fee on your purchases.

GENEROUS GRACE PERIOD
The Credit Union gives you a 25-day
grace period on your VISA, meaning
the payment-due date is 25 days from
the date of posting. If you pay your
outstanding balance by the due date,
you will not be charged interest. Of
course, if you're unable to take
advantage of this feature, you re still
saving a great deal with our low
interest rate.
EASY TO GET
Every Credit Union member who is at
least 18 years of age is eligible to apply
for a VISA card. Applications are
available at all of our Credit Union
branches. Call or stop by today!
