SENIORS!
It seems like just a few days
ago we were camped out in
White Plaza, begging you to
vote for us. We promised
good times. Great times.
Some fifty-six Senior Events
later ... we hope you've en
joyed your Senior year as
much as we have.
Graduation is a scant ten
days away. These ten days,
though, are likely to be the
most intense days of your
Stanford career.
We urge you to take time out
and come spend time with
The Class. After all —when
all is said and done, after
your bags and boxes are
packed, after your finals are
taken, after you've heard the
last strains of All Right
Now —your friends are what
you will miss most.
