"Whatever you do will seem insignificant.
But the important thing is that you do it."
— Mahatma Gandhi
During commencement graduating students will have the
opportunity to privately and voluntarily sign the Graduation
Pledge which will be handed out before the processional outside
the stadium. Signing the pledge is only a beginning.
Its significance arises from the commitment you make
to follow through on it.
The pledge is intended to help create an atmosphere in which
social and environmental responsibility play a more central role in
career decisions so that students can have a
positive impact on society.
Sponsored by the Public Service Center,
Memorial Church, and the Graduation Pledge Alliance
