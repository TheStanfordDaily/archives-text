Dearest Pumpers: My celebration on June 12th is with our Precious Lord
and you. My desire to share this day with you is rooted and grounded in
the love he has so painfully refined. With tears I pray you might be at
my graduation ... with joy 1 am finally convinced that He is sufficient.
All praise to Him for the severe mercy he has shown us in causing our
gaze to be fixed upon Him alone. I love you, my treasure of darkness. Let
us press on to know Him in hidden ways forever ...
- Your very littlest Pumpers
from Stanford. CA
