Congratulations Rich! Well Done!
As you prepare for Harvard in the Fall,
remember the words of Longfellow:
Lives of great men all remind ns
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time;
Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing
Learning to labor and to wait.
P.S. Stanford was on us — Harvard I aw is you.
We Love You, Mom and Dad
