from l-oi Gatos, CA
POSITION AVAILABLE
Hard-working Stanford student wanted to bring sunshine into our lives, invite
well-mannered friends to our home, share the joy of an exciting class, call
collect, discuss grades, borrow money for parking tickets, show us pictures, pet
the cats, tell jokes, argue about politics, turn up our stereo, send us postcards
while on Spring Break, thank us for CAKE packages, casually drink a little
beer and a lot of Diet Pepsi, give advice about good pizza places,
enthusiastically promote Stanford sports, go shopping with us when the styles
change, and cry when it is time to say goodbye. No experience necessary.
Please contact Frank and Judy Dodge. (Linda '88)
