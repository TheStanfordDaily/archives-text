# Minority report lacks thorough fact-finding
## 
### Alicia Kent Senior staff writer 
Although the preliminary
report of the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues succeeds
in getting at the root of minority
concerns, the final report will not
be effective unless it makes more
use of University data and re
sources rather than simply the
opinions of students, faculty and
staff.

News analysis

Characterizing the campus en
vironment as one of "tension,
frustration and aggravation," the
report, released last week, is a
first step toward finding "a course
for the University to follow in
establishing an interactive, mul
tiracial and multicultural environ
ment."
The report is ground-breaking
because of its purpose: to examine
minority issues and concerns svs

tematically and in-depth. The
report aims to go beyond tradi
tional answers to minority con
cerns, covering minority issues
and policy changes in all aspects
of the University.
The committee's efforts since
its formation last spring by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
and Provost James Rosse reflect
this effort to take an in-depth look
at policies affecting minorities.
The report attempts to gather
data from throughout the Univer
sity; collect and assess student,
faculty and staff opinions, and in
some areas, such as faculty issues
and student life, make sugges
tions for change.
A large majority of opinions in
the report come from students;
some were solicited from faculty
and staff.
These efforts to centralize in
formation about minority life
have successfully identified con
cerns of minority students, fac
ulty and staff. Through public
forums, dormitory discussions
and interviews, the committee has
targeted five areas of concern:
• Recruitment, hiring, promo
tion and development of faculty;
• Recruitment, hiring, promo
tion and development of staff;
• Curriculum;
• Student life and the perform
ance of the Office of Student Af
fairs; and
• Undergraduate and graduate
recruitment, admissions, student
aid and retention.
Identifying the problems, how
ever, is only the first step toward
improving campus minority life.
The preliminary report relies
mostly on student, faculty and
staff opinions and perceptions. To
make recommendations for policy
changes would be difficult with
such limited information.
Although the report is only a
preliminary "progress" report its
conclusions — especially in the
area of student life — seem
premature, according to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
Lyons said he was "disap
pointed" with the committee's
conclusions about student life.
The report criticizes Lyons' office,

stating that a "lack of effective
leadership (there) is perceived by
minorities to be among the most
important causes of multicultural
and multiracial problems."
Lyons said the committee did
not interview him and his key
staff members. The committee
only tried once to obtain data
from the Office of Student Affairs,
Lyons said. The data, however, is
spread throughout the campus
and cannot be found in one "Stu
dent Affairs drawer marked 'mi
nority issues,' " he said.
Lyons suggested seeking more
detailed information from resi
dent assistants, resident fellows,
Judicial Affairs, Cowell Health
Center, Fraternal Affairs, Career
Planning and Placement Center,
Residential Education, the
Housing Center, Tresidder Union,
Administrative Services, Counsel
ing and Psychological Services,
the Athletic Department, the
Police/Student Relations Panel
and the Student Affairs Commit
tee on Minority Affairs.
Before the final report comes
out next fall, the committee will
face a summer of hard work. If
the committee can augment its
opinion-gathering with fact
finding from all sectors of the Uni
versity, the final report will carry
more weight and sensitive policy
changes can be implemented.
