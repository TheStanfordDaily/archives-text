# The
						trivial side of Commencement exposed at last

### 
The history of the University's
Commencement exercises may
serve no real purpose other than
being great material for a Stan
ford trivia bowl. But what's the
difference? Go ahead — read on
and bone up on the University's
Commencement history. ..
Where were most Commencements
held prior to 1938? Clue: Its small
size became a problem as enroll
ment grew.
Memorial Church. From 1938
until 1983 Stanford held Com
mencement in Frost Amphithea
ter; in 1984, the ceremony was
held at Sunken Diamond, and in
1985 it moved to Stanford Stadi
um.
Where was the first Commence
ment held?
Roble Gym. According to Fred
Glover, Class of '33 and former
executive assistant to the Univer
sity president, evergreens and
flowers decorated what was then
a temporary frame building.
Who was the speaker in 1935,
when Commencement was held in
the Stadium? Clue: He was a
member of the first class that
graduated from Stanford, and his
wife — also a Stanford grad —
was named Lou Henry. While a
student here, this speaker forgot
to bring the football to the first
Big Game.
Former U.S. President Herbert
Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon,
Class of '28, Commencement mar
shal from 1934-72 and 50-year
resident of the white house with
the roses at the corner of Mayfield
Avenue and Campus Drive, esti
mated that more than 15,000 at
tended the Hoover speech in the
90,000 capacity arena. "A lot left"
after Hoover gave his speech,
Bacon said.
According to Donald Winbigler,
former registrar, academic secre
tary and dean of students for 17
years, "It was a very good talk.
It was brief and to the point."
Incidentally, Winbigler attended
every Commencement from 1940-
1975.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s,
there was always a chronic short
age of Commencement tickets.
Why was the University so reluc
tant to hold Commencement exer
cises in the Stadium?
University officials maintained
that the Stadium's atmosphere
was wrong for Commencement.
"It was too big a place," Bacon
said. Frost Amphitheater, on the
other hand, was loved by faculty
and students alike; Bacon called
it the "ideal place."
In 1984, however, officials
relented and decided to try
Sunken Diamond as a Commence
ment site. When that was deemed
too small as well, some faculty
and students considered holding
the ceremony in the Oval. Even
tually, though, Stanford Stadium
got the nod because of its virtually
unlimited capacity.
By the way, the Graduate
School of Business holds its cer
emony in Frost.
How difficult was it to obtain
Commencement tickets before the
move to the Stadium?
Very difficult, according to
Bacon. Thousands of ticket re
quests were routinely denied each
year.
Has Commencement ever been
rained out?
Amazingly, it never has.
Have students always received
their diplomas at department cer
emonies?
No. Up until about 12 years
ago — during Richard Lyman's
presidency — the University pres
ident awarded the diplomas in the
large ceremony. But the ceremony
grew too long.
Historical Society President
Ray Lyman Wilbur Jr., Class of
'33 and son of third University
President Wilbur (1916-43), said
his father spoke at every Com
mencement and personally gave
every graduating student his di
ploma.
According to Eric Hutchinson,
a chemistry professor here for 36
years, the ceremony became cum
bersome. "We all fried in Frost
Amphitheater," he said. "The

present arrangement is much bet
ter. It no longer looks like an
assembly line. We have more in
timate ceremonies."
He added, "there were many
mistakes in the old days." For
example, students occasionally re
ceived the wrong diplomas.
"People were swapping them
around," Hutchinson said.
The registrar and the academic
secretary gave the diplomas to the
University president. For many
years students told their names
— or sometimes fictitious names
— to "readers." As a result, the
name of Warren G. Wonka, a fic
titious campus mischief-maker
similar to World War ll's Kilroy,
was called at one Commencement.
Has the University ever enforced
a strict time limit on speeches?
No. But someone once gave an
hour-long speech.
Did professors and students al
ways wear robes at Commence
ment?
No. According to Gover, the en
tire class did not wear caps and
gowns until 1906. Students ap
parently considered the custom
"medieval." In 1899 a female stu
dent started the cap and gown
movement, ordering herself and
other women caps and gowns.
Where was Commencement held
1906-14, when the earthquake
damaged Memorial Church?
Birge Clark, Class of '14, said
his Commencement was held in
the Auditorium (also called the
Assembly Hall) which currently
houses the Communications De
partment and formerly housed
the Business School. A class pic
ture was taken in the Inner Quad,
however, which has led some to
think Commencement was held
in the Quad that year.
Glover added that in 1906 the
University postponed Commence
ment until Sept. 15 because of
the earthquake.
Has a live band always provided
the music for the ceremony?
No. Prior to 1906, organ music
was used. Before the late '40s,

organ music was piped into the
Amphitheater from Memorial
Church. Then after Music Prof.
Herber Nanney came here as Uni
versity organist in 1947, he played
a rented electric organ in the Am
phitheater. "They decided it was
easier if I had eyeball contact,"
he said.
How did The Daily treat Com
mencement?
Well, in 1941 — back when a
year's tuition was a whopping
$345 — The Daily printed the
names of everyone who graduated
with distinction. That same year
class orators — along with Uni
versity President John Branner
— gave speeches at Commence
ment.
Back then The Daily printed
the full text of the main speech,
apparently always given by a top
University official, in the Com
mencement issues.
Who designed the Commencement
flags?

Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry
professor here for 36 years, de
signed them.
The banners used in the Sta
dium to cover up the empty seats
on the east side of the Stadium
are emblazoned with the Univer
sity's Centennial logo.
Have most Commencement
speakers been political figures?
Contrary to recent popular
belief, the majority of Commence
ment speakers are not political
figures. University presidents
(both of Stanford and of other
universities), particularly Wilbur,
have been the most "prolific"
speakers. Other speakers have in
cluded a secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, a former sec
retary of Labor and a UC-
Berkeley chancellor. In 1986
"Nightline" anchorman Ted Kop
pel, a Stanford graduate, gave the
Commencement address.
Political speakers have included
Watergate Special Prosecutor Ar
chibald Cox in 1974 (three

months before President Richard
Nixon resigned), U.N. Ambassa
dor Daniel Patrick Moynihan in
1975, U.N. Ambassador Andrew
Young in 1979, Deputy Secretary
of State Warren Christopher in
1981, Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor in 1982,
Secretary of State George Shultz
in 1983 and New York Governor
Mario Cuomo in 1984.
And the speeches have not al
ways been serious. In 1967, John
Fischer, editor in chief of Harper's
magazine, included in his "four
choices" for graduating students
"dropping out" and "trying to
change the world gradually."
Are disruptions common'?
The silent protestors in 1983
were not the first to "disrupt"
the generally sedate — except for
the champagne — Commence
ment exercises. Bacon said minor
distractions are the rule: "There
usually was a dog in Frost Am
phitheater that would dash across
the stage."
