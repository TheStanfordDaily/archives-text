# A
						mother-daughter odyssey: Taking wing and keeping root
## 
### 
It's almost May 22, Jodi, and
your 22nd birthday. Then on June
12 you'll be graduating. Egads!
Another one of life's biggies is
about to kick me in the stomach.
My firstborn, my baby is gradu
ating from college! Where has the
time gone? I simply find it all
impossible to believe.
It really seems as if it were just
a few months ago that you left
for Stanford. Late fall 1984.
Everyone else had not only left
for their first, second or whatever
choice of college, but they were
nearing their fall break — our
first inkling that there's more
than just a three-hour difference
between East and West coast
schools.
Because of a severe illness in
1981, I was still not well enough
to take you to college as, I was
sure, every mother in the world
was doing. You said goodbye with
tears in your eyes and promised
to call and promised to write.
Then off to the airport with your
dad and stepmother. I couldn't
believe you were gone.
It had been just you, your sister
and me for six years, the last three
of which were concerned with
sickness, survival and surviving.
It was not the average high school
experience for you. You took over
for me, but now you were gone.
My "eyes" were oft to college. Cal
ifornia. You couldn't have gone
much farther away from Boston
except, as we joked, to Guam. We
knew we could manage; your
sister would fill your shoes for
me. She did.

It has been said that as parents
we've done our job if we can give
our children roots and wingß.
Damn if it wasn't time to use
those wings. You try to prepare
them for the time when they
leave. And then they do! You for
get to prepare yourself.
The days flew by. The lingo fil
tered home. Orientation. Otero.
AAs. RAs. The Quad. Mem Aud.
Meyer. Green. Big Game (that's
the Harvard-Yale game, isn't it?)
First roommate, Mary. Her horse.
How do they ever match people
up? Western Culture. New meyor.
Leslie. Jessie. Alison. Bryn. Carla.
Brian. Kay. Kirsten. Kim. Patrice.
Dave. Liz. Diane. Heather. Sherri.
People. So many people. Your let
ters and calls were about campus
life, dorm life, classes, the City,
but always people.
Then Thanksgiving. Every col
lege student in the northern
hemisphere came home but you!
You explained that there were in
vitations to several homes, that
some kids stayed in the dorm; it
was too far to travel coast to coast
for a long weekend; you'd be home
in three weeks for Christmas; you
had two papers due; etc. etc. All
I knew was that everyone was
home and that you weren't and
I was upset. I recovered as soon
as the other kids went back to
school!
After Christmas break I really
began to adjust to your visitor
status. I insisted you come home
over spring break and that first
summer between freshman and
sophomore years. Then I let you

decide yourself, and off you went.
Roots and wings.
The next two summers were
spent at Oxford and working in
Washington, D.C. I spent two
spring breaks with you "out
West," driving down the coast one
year and going to Bcya the next.
You were always home for
Christmas, although your break
was the shortest of any school.
East Coast. West Coast . . . Yeh,

I know; there's more than a time
difference.
It can't be over. Dear un
declared sophomore. Find a
major. Change your msyor. Ori
entation volunteer. Am Stud
house. Lively arts. Mary (it
worked out, even with the horse!)
There. Bob. Alex. Martha. Nat
han. Julie. Michelle. Mark.
Your sister graduated from high
school in June 1986. You couldn't

be there. Finals. Start late, finish
late. Everyone's home again. Not
you. East Coast. West Coast. Will
1 ever get used to it?
Fall 1986. Both girls will be off
to college, one in California and
the other in Florida. We sell our
home. Move to Chicago. Back
home for Mom. Only lived in Bos
ton 25 years. Only. Trauma time.
We manage. We adjust.
Dear undeclared junior. Better
find a major very soon. More
Lively Arts ushering. Little Sister.
Head Advising Associate. Rape
Education Project. Tutoring in
East Palo Alto. Cultural czar for
the house. Women's Center. Paul.
Steve. Michael. Tammy. Shirley.
Lauren. Steve. Rose marie.
Senior year. Serra RA. Jeff, Kel
ly, Susan plus 90! Have major for
sure now. Really could have
finished five quarters ago in terms
of credits. Just no rmgor. Need a
job. What to do? Write a resume.
Career and counseling center. Not
a lot of ads in The Daily for
fuzzies. Grad school? Don't know.
Yes. No. Maybe later. GREs?
LSATs? Yes. No. Maybe later.
How am I ever going to get all
this stuff home, Mom? I don't
want to live in the suburbs, Mom.
Graduation. Make reservations.
First grandchild on both sides and
all four grandparents want to
make the trip, ages 73 to 81. Is
there shade in the stadium?
What now, what next? For four
years, I've received appeals for
money from Stanford, been of
fered a chance to become a
lifetime Stanford alumna (no mat

ter that I went to that other place
back East). Been given the oppor
tunity to purchase Stanford
recipes, pot holders and calendars.
Been offered memberships in the
Mothers' Club, Stanford Club of
Boston, and the Stanford Club of
Chicago. When you graduate is
my name removed from all thest
lists? Is yours put on?
Roots and wings. The young
woman that entered Stanford that
so short time ago emerges this
June quite different, quite
changed. She is probably smarter
and undoubtedly wiser. She is
more competent, more confident,
and determined. She has more —
more ideas, more interests, more
knowledge, more insight, more
people. Dennis and Diane have
had as great an impact on her as
I have had.
She'll touch the lives of others
and make the world a better place.
I am so proud. I love her so. Roots
and wings.
OK, world, here she is. I hope
she gets a job.

After two careers and raising two
children, Bonnie Bader is an un
declared mom living in Chicago.
She, too, needs a job. Her
daughter, Jodi Epstein, is grad
uating today. Jodi has majored
in or seriously considered major
ing in English, Comparative
Literature, Anthropology, Human
Biology, History, International
Relations, Third World Hunger
and Women's Studies. Her degree
is in Political Science.
