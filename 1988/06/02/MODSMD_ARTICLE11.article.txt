# Stanford police ride-along program
## Officer reveals secrets of police beat 
### Brent Bigler Staff writer 
On many nights at Stanford, stu
dents gear up for parties that often
consist of little more than loud music
and alcohol. To Stanford Police Offi
cer Tim Schreiner, these parties cause
"genuine concern" for student safety.
His job, he says, is to protect party
goers, and this often means making
sure students "drink responsibly."
"We don't want another drowning,"
he says, referring to the death of Da
vid Dunshee in April 1987. Dunshee,
then a junior, drowned in Lake La
gunita after leaving a fraternity party
where he drank heavily.
In a recent four-hour ride-along
with Schreiner, the officer revealed to
The Daily some of the more surpris
ing, hidden aspects of a Stanford
police officer's daily beat.

Available to the Stanford commu
nity for many years, the ride-along
program was emphasized in May by
the Panel on Student and Police Re
lations in an effort to improve com
munity relations with campus police.
The panel met for the first time
Feb. 25 after a two-year delay in its
formation. It is designed to bring
safety and security matters to the at
tention of the police, make policy rec
ommendations to the University pres
ident and facilitate communication be
tween the University community and
the police.

All Stanford police officers have col
lege degrees, according to Schreiner.
One benefit of this, he says, is to keep
officers from being intimidated by stu
dents.
Schreiner says that if preventing
problems at parties means arresting
underage drinkers, then he will have
done his job. Students, he says, often
ask whether arresting such people
really helps prevent the problem, and
he asserts, "We think so."
If this year's lack of serious acci
dents is any indication of the police's
success in controlling parties, then
Schreiner can feel justified. But con
trary to the claims of many students,
the police have no new alcohol policy,
says Schreiner. The police do not "go
out and do counter-intelligence" to
find parties, nor are they trying to
stop students from having fun.
Rather, as Schreiner reiterates, the
police are public safety officers,
"trying to do a job ... to protect
people."
However, students have complained
about police "crackdowns" on parties.
Last month, students of legal drinking
age at dorm parties were singled out
to take responsibility for any alcohol
served to underage people.
Nonetheless, police projection of the
Stanford community goes far beyond
merely policing parties and protecting
party-goers. Even on a relatively quiet
night, a police officer has many duties.
Schreiner and his comrades operate

from a small trailer behind the main
police station located at Campus Drive
and Serra Street. This annex houses
lockers, offices and other cubicles. Be
hind the annex, about 100 bicycles
and 13 kegs of conflsicated beer are
impounded.
Contrary to popular belief, the
police do not always stop cyclists who
run stop signs. On the beat, Schreiner
stakes out a stop sign and watches
several cyclists pedal straight through.
"We don't have quotas," he says, add
ing, "It's more important to be visible"
than to stop every cyclist. A group of
three pedals past the sign, but
Schreiner says he especially does not
like to stop cyclists in groups, because
then he has to cite each separately,
and the last may have to wait a half
hour to get the citation.
A call comes over the radio describ
ing a man who has knocked on a
resident's door at Casa Zapata and
frightened a woman inside. Another
officer is there to look for the man,
but Schreiner also watches for the
transient. This is the method of many
burglars at Stanford, Schreiner says.
"They knock on doors to see if anyone
is home," he says. If not, and the
door is open, they break in and take
jewelry, wallets, money and other
small items. There is rarely evidence
of forced entry in a burglary, he says,
because so many students leave their
doors unlocked.
