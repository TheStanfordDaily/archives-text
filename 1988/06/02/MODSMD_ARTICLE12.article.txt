# Maximizing utility
## Lomita Mall faces major summer construction 
### Dennis Lee 
Lomita Mall, located between the Physics
Tank and the west side of the Quad, will
be torn up this summer in one of the
largest utility projects ever undertaken at
Stanford. New utility lines will be installed
to support the Near West Campus devel
opment and upgrade the University's pres
ent utilities.
The project, which should cost $4.7 mil
lion, will be funded through a loan from
the University Trustees and donations to
the Near West Campus fund. John Ken
nedy, a facilities project manager coordi
nating the construction, said the project
will pay for itself through slightly increased
utility rates over the next one or two years.
The $250 million Near West Campus, a
science and engineering development that
will be completed over the next 10 to 15
years, will use the utilities.
An outside construction firm, not yet
selected, will do the project.
Construction is set to begin the first
week after Commencement. All visible
work should be done before Fall Quarter,
though the project probably won't be done
until December 1988, Kennedy said.
A trench will be dug across the entire
length of the mall, new utility lines tying
into existing lines will be laid down and
the holes will be refilled. A fence will block
off the mall during the project, with
openings every 300 feet to allow passage.
The trench will run directly under the site
of George Segal's "Gay Liberation" statue,
which has been in storage since it was
vandalized last summer and should be

repaired and installed after the utility lines
are in place.
The utilities include chilled water, steam,
high voltage electricity, storm drainage and
telephone and data lines. The lines will
connect utilities on Serra and Panama
Streets, replacing outdated utilities on Via
Crespi.
A 30-feet-deep tunnel will be dug from
the intersection of Panama and Samuel
Morris Way to Skilling Auditorium, closing
off through traffic at the intersection dur
ing the summer. Passing between Durand
and Terman, the tunnel will take a 90
degree turn, pass between Mitchell and
Durand, take a 45 degree turn and end up
at Skilling. The tunnel will link there to
the Lomita trench.
"A tunnel of this length is unusual be
cause of the costs," Kennedy said. Most
projects use burial and refill, he said.
