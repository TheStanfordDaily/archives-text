Bush won't tell spending plans
KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine - Top eco
nomic advisers to Vice President Bush said
yesterday that Bush will not outline details
of federal spending cuts he would impose until
after the election, and they disclosed that
Bush's "flexible freeze" plan to balance the
budget in five years depends on a $55 billion
windfall from what they hope will be lower
interest rates.

After two days of meetings
with Bush here on economic
matters, the advisers said
Bush has adopted a broad plan
under which the deficit
shrinks in large part because
of economic growth, and what
ever austerity is required in
spending would not be
revealed to voters this au
tumn.

"I assume the vice president is going to
want to wait until he sits down with the
Congress to negotiate those details," said econ
omist Martin Feldstein, a Bush adviser. He
was responding to questions about when Bush
would tell voters about spending cuts he might
propose in politically sensitive programs, such
as Medicare and farm price supports. He has
previously announced that one of his first
actions would be to open negotiations with
Congress on the deficit.
Israel faces new W. Bank crisis
JERUSALEM — Israel's military occupation
authorities in the West Bank are running out
of money and suspending many government
services because of the refusal of Palestinians
to pay taxes and a general economic decline
during the nearly 6-month-long uprising, a
senior administrative official said yesterday.
The military administration has stopped
making welfare and hospital payments to
needy families, laid off workers and cut off
funds for local authorities, health services,
sewage and drinking-water systems, road
building and electricity grids while it searches
for funds, according to the official, who briefed
Israeli reporters on condition of anonymity.
Meanwhile, during a day of Arab protests
marking International Children's Day, an 11-
year-old Palestinian boy died last night in the
West Bank town of Tulkarm when he waa
crushed by a concrete-filled metal drum that
was part of a barricade built by the army to
seal off a road.
Arab demonstrators were attempting to tear
down the barricade when one the barrels
landed on the boy, identified as Majdi Abu
Safaka, according to Palestinian witnesses.
The army said it was checking the story.
Israeli officials have said that tax revenues
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have dropped
at least 30 percent in recent months because
of an organized campaign of nonpayment led
by Palestinian activists seeking to cripple the
military occupation.
