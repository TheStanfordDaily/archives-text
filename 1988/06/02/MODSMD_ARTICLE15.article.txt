# Gorbachev to keep number two official

MOSCOW â€” Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev said yester
day that Yegor Ligachev, the
Communist Party's chief'
ideologist and a conservative
opponent of Gorbachev's radi
cal reforms, would retain his
position in the party's ruling
Politburo despite calls for his
replacement.
Gorbachev, in a rare public
discussion of internal party
politics, told a news conference
that Ligachev was not blocking
the reform program, known as
"perestroika," and that his po
sition as the party's No. 2 of
ficial was secure despite recur
rent rumors that he would
soon be ousted.
But Gorbachev, the party's
general secretary, said that
Boris Yeltsin, the former party
chief in Moscow, would be
asked to explain his public
demand this week that Ligac
hev be replaced.
Yeltsin, who lost his own po
sition in the Politburo after
clashes with the conservative
party bureaucracy, had said
that Ligachev should be
removed as a Central Commit
tee secretary "because the
processes in the party are too
slow, because the party is still
lagging behind, because the
process of democratization is
not developing . . . and Com
rade Ligachev is the main per
son responsible."
While such sentiments have
been expressed by other
liberals within the party,
Yeltsin made his comments in
interviews with ABC and the
British Broadcasting Corp.,
and that use of the foreign

news media has drawn consid
erable criticism.

"We at the
Central Com
mittee will
demand from
Comrade
Yeltsin expla
nations as to
what it is all
about and
what he is
after," Gorba-

chev said, speaking very em
phatically.
"As for Comrade Ligachev
and his resignation, no such
problem exists, either at the
Central Committee or in the
Politburo. That is all. That is
what you should proceed from,
and that is the way it will be."
Gorbachev's comments were
carried quickly and promin
ently by Soviet news media in
a major political innovation
here: He had both discussed
internal party politics in a
public forum and submitted to
the questioning of Soviet and
foreign newsmen.
Never before had a Soviet
party leader held a formal news
conference in Moscow, al
though they have done so
abroad and given interviews
here.
"Our leaders have always
thought it unseemly to submit
to such public questioning," a
prominent Soviet journalist
remarked. "Gorbachev, how
ever, thinks it is quite proper,
and having so many foreign
journalists here for the Soviet-
American summit gave him a
chance to start this."
