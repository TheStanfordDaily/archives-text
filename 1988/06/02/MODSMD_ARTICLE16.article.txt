# Summit ends smoothly
## Little progress made on strategic arms treaty 
### 
MOSCOW — President Reagan and So
viet leader Mikhail Gorbachev concluded
their fourth summit yesterday with scant
gains on strategic arms control, but they
said progress on improving U.S.-Soviet re
lations had, in Gorbachev's words, "dealt
a blow at the foundation of the Cold War."
In a joint communique and in separate
news conferences, the leaders of the world's
superpowers said they had also made con
crete progress on human rights and
regional conflicts.
Tacitly conceding that the minimal prog
ress achieved here on the strategic arms
reduction agreement raises serious doubts
that it can be completed before Reagan's
term ends in January, the president and
the Soviet leader declared it is vital for the
START negotiations to continue under
Reagan's successor.
"I would hope that before the year is
out that we could eliminate the differences
that still exist" on START, Reagan said at
his news conference yesterday afternoon.
"But if not, I would hope that my successor
would continue, because here we are get
ting at, I think, the most important reduc
tion that should take place in nuclear weap
ons."
And Gorbachev, asked if it would be
important to have regular meetings with
the next president, responded that it would
be "vitally necessary."
Indeed, in appraising what had been ac
complished during Reagan's dramatic trip
to Moscow — the first by an American
president since the Nixon administration
— both leaders stressed the importance of
regular summit meetings as part of a
framework for stabilizing and improving
U.S.-Soviet relations.
"Serious differences remain on impor
tant issues" and "will continue to charac
terize the U.S.-Soviet relationship," they
acknowledged in their final statement.
But they declared that the dialogue es
tablished by the four summits "can serve
as a constructive basis for addressing not
only the problems of the present, but of
tomorrow and the next century."
Administration officials said that their
closed-door discussions with Soviet officials

on human rights were highly productive
and moved forward smoothly. In public,
however, the issue continued to prove
sensitive and difficult for both Reagan and
Gorbachev.
The Soviet leader was clearly still nettled
by the president's highly publicized meet
ings with dissidents and refuseniks.
And Reagan, apparently seeking to avoid
rubbing salt in the wound as the summit
ended, put himself in the awkward position
of contending that much of the problem
over Jewish emigration from the Soviet
Union stems not from Kremlin policy but
from stubborn bureaucrats.
On a more positive note, the two leaders,
in ceremonies at the Kremlin, exchanged
the ratification documents of the Interme
diate Nuclear Forces treaty, which provides
for elimination of all medium-range nuclear
missiles.
"Historians who will one day describe
and evaluate what is now being done have
probably not yet been born," Gorbachev
declared. "But every day, babies are being
born who will live in the 21st century, and
to them we must bequeath a safe and
humane world."
Reagan said the INF treaty "makes pos
sible a new dimension of cooperation." But,
he said, "We must not stop here. . . . We
must try to move forward in the months
ahead to complete this START treaty as
soon as possible.
"So let us continue to expand the fron
tiers of trust, even as we verify, Mr. Gen
eral Secretary, even as we verify," Reagan
said.
Although both leaders were relatively op
timistic in their concluding comments, Gor
bachev was outspoken in expressing disap
pointment that the summit had not ac
complished more.
And, seeking to lay the blame directly
on Reagan, he suggested that some of their
closed-door, one-on-one sessions had been
more heated than Kremlin and White
House briefers had led reporters to believe
during the summit, particularly concerning
Reagan's planned Strategic Defense Initi
ative.
