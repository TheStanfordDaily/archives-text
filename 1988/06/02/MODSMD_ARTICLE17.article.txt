# Scientists warn:
## AIDS programs for drug abusers are inadequate 
### 
WASHINGTON - Federal efforts
to combat AIDS are crippled by the
"gross inadequacy" of programs for
intravenous drug abusers, a pres
tigious panel of scientists warned yes
terday.
Their report, sponsored by a com
mittee of the National Academy of
Sciences and the Institute of Medicine,
updates an influential 1986 document
entitled "Confronting AIDS," which
warned that AIDS was a potential
catastrophe and castigated federal
leadership and educational efforts as
"woefully inadequate."
The update contains similar criti
cisms and new recommendations, in

eluding support for a federal law that
would ban AIDS discrimination, the
establishment of a national commis
sion that would "formulate a coherent
national policy" on AIDS, and small,
controlled studies of the effectiveness
of clean-needle programs among drug
addicts.
"We think that one of the major
changes since 1986 is the growing
awareness of the magnitude of the
problem of drug abuse and AIDS,
which we clearly underestimated in
the earlier report," said Dr. Samuel
Thier, president of the Institute of
Medicine.
The issuing of the report is the first

in a series of events over the next two
weeks that are intended to focus
renewed attention on the AIDS
epidemic.
Today, retired Adm. James Watkins,
chairman of the presidential AIDS
commission, is scheduled to release
recommendations that will form the
basis for that panel's report to the
White House.
Watkins, who stunned critics last
February when he proposed sweeping
new multi-billion dollar programs to
fight AIDS and drug abuse, is expected
to echo the academy's report by sup
porting a federal law to ban AIDS
discrimination, a measure the Reagan

administration opposes.
In the meantime, federal health of
ficials, facing mounting criticism of
their handling of the epidemic, began
meeting yesterday in closed session in
Charlottesville, Va., to develop a strat
egy for combating AIDS into the
19905.
"I think the convergence of all these
events reflects a developing sense of
how serious the situation is," said Dr.
June Osbom, dean of the School of
Public Health at the University of
Michigan. "We're going to see a mtyor
escalation (in cases) that will blow your
mind."
