From arcane Faculty Senate
deliberations over the future
of the Western Culture pro
gram to a small blip in a seismic
survey of University residences,
Stanford University made news at
home and across the country this
year.
A courtroom confrontation over
urine samples of Stanford athletes
also made national news.
Some notables left the Universi
ty, announced plans to leave or
were just plain told to leave. None
were more prominent than the di
rector of the Hoover Institution,
who was unceremoniously eased
out of power by the University
Trustees.
A preacher-turned-politico with
surpassing oratorical skill moved

2 Roble Hall
shuts down
At a most inopportune time for
its residents — during finals week
of fall quarter — the University
announced the closing of the
oldest dormitory on campus be
cause of an unacceptable risk it
would collapse in a earth
quake.
The University housing system
somehow absorbed all 294 dis
placed "Roble refugees." Makes
hift doubles, triples and quads
popped up all over campus, and
Stanford did the best it could to
make the abrupt transition easy
for all.
Questions remained, however,
about those hollow clay tiles dis
covered in the 70-year-old dorm
last summer in the course of a

routine seismic survey. The Uni
versity admitted in January it
"could have and should have"
acted sooner to determine
whether Roble was safe. It took
the November discovery of a pho
tograph in University archives
showing that the whole dorm was
built with the brittle clay tiles to
force the University to act.
A publicity drive by a Roble
alumnus asking the University to
renovate Roble rather than tear
it down succeeded. In April, the
administration decided to
renovate the dorm at a cost of
between $6 million and $7 million,
with construction expected to be
completed in September 1989.
3 Drug-testing
exemption
Two Stanford athletes beat the
NCAA in court.
Canying on a legal fight begun
in January 1987 by then-senior
Simone LeVant, senior soccer
player Jennifer Hill and junior
linebacker Barry McKeever con
vinced a Santa Clara County Su
perior Court judge that the

NCAA's mandatory drug-testing
program violated their right to
privacy under the California Con
stitution.
McKeever testified in court last
October that he was embarrassed
and humiliated in December 1986
when he was forced to undergo
testing before the Gator Bowl
with an NCAA official standing a
few feet behind him.
Judge Conrad Rushing issued
a preliminary injunction Nov. 19
exempting Stanford athletes —
except for football and men's bas
ketball players — from participat
ing in the program, writing that
it treats athletes like criminals.
The NCAA pressed the case fur
ther, and the final verdict is still
pending in court.
4 Safety
scandal
University safety management
is beset with corruption, a former
top health and safety official at
Stanford charged in December,
prompting a full in-house inves
tigation.
Charges that safety officials in

timidated employees and covered
up serious accidents, brought to
Kennedy's attention by Univer
sity safety official Jon Moldestad,
are still being investigated by a
University auditor.
In March, SRI International, a
Menlo Park consulting firm, re
leased a preliminary report con
firming charges by Moldestad that
many University buildings are in
need of immediate repair and that
the University's Department of
Health and Safety gets short
shrift from higher management
and researchers alike.
The report identified a conflict
of interest at the University be
tween research and safety. Ken
nedy, who said he was impressed
by the report, is currently looking
at ways to implement its recom
mendations.

W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution since 1960,
was told by the Trustees May 17
that he must step down from his
position next year.

Questions remained, however,
about those hollow clay tiles dis
covered in the 70-year-old dorm
last summer in the course of a

routine seismic survey. The Uni
versity admitted in January it
"could have and should have"
acted sooner to determine
whether Roble was safe. It took
the November discovery of a pho
tograph in University archives
showing that the whole dorm was
built with the brittle clay tiles to
force the University to act.
A publicity drive by a Roble
alumnus asking the University to
renovate Roble rather than tear
it down succeeded. In April, the
administration decided to
renovate the dorm at a cost of
between $6 million and $7 million,
with construction expected to be
completed in September 1989.

exemption
Two Stanford athletes beat the
NCAA in court.
Canying on a legal fight begun
in January 1987 by then-senior
Simone LeVant, senior soccer
player Jennifer Hill and junior
linebacker Barry McKeever con
vinced a Santa Clara County Su
perior Court judge that the

NCAA's mandatory drug-testing
program violated their right to
privacy under the California Con
stitution.
McKeever testified in court last
October that he was embarrassed
and humiliated in December 1986
when he was forced to undergo
testing before the Gator Bowl
with an NCAA official standing a
few feet behind him.
Judge Conrad Rushing issued
a preliminary injunction Nov. 19
exempting Stanford athletes —
except for football and men's bas
ketball players — from participat

it treats athletes like criminals.
The NCAA pressed the case fur

pending in court.
4 Safety
scandal
University safety management
is beset with corruption, a former
top health and safety official at
Stanford charged in December,
prompting a full in-house inves
tigation.
Charges that safety officials in

timidated employees and covered
up serious accidents, brought to
Kennedy's attention by Univer
sity safety official Jon Moldestad,
are still being investigated by a
University auditor.
In March, SRI International, a
Menlo Park consulting firm, re
leased a preliminary report con
firming charges by Moldestad that
many University buildings are in
need of immediate repair and that
the University's Department of
Health and Safety gets short
shrift from higher management
and researchers alike.
The report identified a conflict
of interest at the University be
tween research and safety. Ken
nedy, who said he was impressed
by the report, is currently looking
at ways to implement its recom
mendations.
