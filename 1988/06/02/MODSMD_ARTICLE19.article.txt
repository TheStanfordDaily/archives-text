# 1987-88 in review
## 
### 
The reason given for the deci
sion was that Campbell will soon
turn 65, the University's tradi
tional retirement age. Campbell,
however, had planned to work un
til age 70 and showed all signs of
being fully productive at the time
of the decision.
Campbell, who has been at
tacked by some professors here
for his close ties to the Reagan
administration, has not yet said
whether he will fight the ouster.
But all indications suggest that
the University has not heard the
last of Campbell.
A month before the decision,
Campbell threatened to slap the
University with a lawsuit if it
tried to remove him from office.
Relations between Campbell and
Kennedy have been cool in the
best of times and may deteriorate
further.
6 Jackson
action
The Rev. Jesse Jackson juiced
a White Plaza crowd of 7,000 on
a sweltering Saturday in May.
On the stump for the Democra
tic presidential primary June 7 in
California, Jackson brought the
crowd to a standing ovation many
times, calling for greater federal
investment in education to help
thwart drugs and crime.
It was Jackson's second visit to
The Farm in as many years. The
nation's first serious black presi
dential contender poked jibes at
both his Democratic rival, Massa
chusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,

and his Republican foe, Vice Pres
ident George Bush. And he
praised "an educational bill of
rights" drafted by a statewide co
alition of minority groups that
will be presented to the Democra
tic National Convention.
7BSU's year:
trial by fire
In its 20th anniversary year,
the BSU succeeded in rallying for
the passage of CIV and in making
"institutional racism" a promi
nent item on the University's
agenda. Institutional racism is
commonly defined as benign, un
conscious discrimination at the in
stitutional level.
The BSU had a tough time win
ning broad student support,
though, despite the triumphs. It
lost its ASSU special fee assess
ment by eight votes in a prelim
inary count, then won in May by
less than 100 votes, the closest
election in years. Also, when the
BSU charged the ASSU in April
with racism in its conduct of in
terviews for three bureaucratic
posts, it failed to win popular sup
port.
The players in question admit
ted that all three interviews had
nothing to do with racism. A sen
ate chair task force report in May,
however, stated that there is in
stitutional racism in the ASSU.
The senate later disavowed the
report by a near-unanimous mar
gin because of "inadequate" in
vestigation, but the BSU took a
measure of satisfaction from the

report, saying it had been vind
icated.
8 Returning
residency
The Draw became a real lottery
this year, rather than the rigged
game of years past, as the Office
of Student Affairs finally agreed
to get rid of the priority enabling
students to return to their house,
no matter how they fared in the
housing lottery.
In May, Assoc. Dean of Student
Affairs Norm Robinson an
nounced that he would not stand
in the way of a report by a student
committee recommending the
elimination of the Returning Res
ident Priority.
Some residences, especially spe
cial priority and theme houses,
argued in favor of keeping the
priority in order to maintain tra
dition and continuity.
But the Housing Center ap
peared willing to compromise on
plans to allow more students to
gain draw-exempt spots in those
houses as theme assistants and
managing staff.
9 Discrimination
and Law School
The Law School struggled with
two related discrimination prob
lems:
• How to balance its faculty with
more minorities and women; and
• How to establish a fair enforce
ment procedure for its non
discrimination policy, which
prohibits any organization using
its facilities — particularly on
campus recruiters — from dis
criminating in any way.
The first problem exploded at
the school when Harvard Law
Prof. Derrick Bell, a black visiting
professor here two years ago who
was mistreated because he em
phasized race issues in his
courses, returned to campus in
November.
At a public forum, Law Dean
Paul Brest apologized to Bell on
behalf of the school for undermin
ing his academic freedom. Brest
pledged to develop better affirm
ative action in hiring of law fac
ulty to avoid such problems in
the future, but brushed aside calls
for quotas from minority student
groups.
The second issue was resolved
last month as the administration
and minority groups reached a
compromise establishing an en
forcement procedure that called
for mandatory publicizing of firms
found to discriminate during on
campus interviews, and other
discretionary punitive steps for
firms that may have discrimi
nated off campus.

Ilft Miracle of
Maples
The top-ranked Arizona Wild
cats rolled into town in February
with an undefeated record in the
Pacific 10 Conference, but left
smarting as the Cardinal
hoopsters held them scoreless for
the last five minutes to win 82-74.
Being No. 1 for a night high
lighted a season in which the bas
ketball team finished third in the
Pac-10, won its first postseason
game since 1942 in the National
Invitational Tournament and
came within a game of landing
an at-large berth in the NCAA
tournament.
Stanford had lost its previous
matchup with Arizona in Tucson
by a score of 90-65. No one ex
pected Stanford to stay in the
same arena with the Wildcats.
But guard Todd Lichti and for
ward Howard Wright carried the
Card this night with 23 and 22
points, respectively. Sean Elliott,
Arizona's All-America forward,
was held to 22 points, including
a quiet 4-for-10 in the second half.
Delirious fans stormed the floor
after the game. The crowd, which
emerged during the season to in
spire the team more than ever
before, was on its feet throughout
the entire second half.
Basketball Coach Mike Mont
gomery later wrote a letter thank
ing the fans for their vociferous
support of the team and urging
more of the same for the rest of
the year.
The day after the game, the
only question on anyone's lips was
"Were you there?"

Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn Campbell, who has drawn fire
and praise during his 28-year tenure for recruiting world-class
researchers of conservative stripe, was told by Trustees In May
that he must step down next year.

Cultures, Ideas and Values March 31 in the Faculty Senate.
