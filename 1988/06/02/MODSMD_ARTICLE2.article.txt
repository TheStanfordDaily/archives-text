# Inner campus growth planned
## Foothill development to be kept at bay 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Stanford's construction plans
up to the year 2000 call for de
velopment of the inner campus,
not sprawl in the foothills, accord
ing to a University report released
last week.
Private consultants, hired by
the University to complete an en
vironmental impact report, will
look at the 18-page summariza
tion of the University's construc
tion plans this month as Stanford
attempts to obtain a new land-use
permit for its unincorporated
lands.
Ransom Bratton of the Santa
Clara County planning office said
the new land-use permit will bet
ter define Stanford's power to
decide upon development of areas
south of Junipero Serra Boule
vard, along Willow Road and along
El Camino Real. It will also at
tempt to clear up any jurisdiction
questions between the University
and surrounding communities by
putting "interpretive things in
writing," he said.
The University's planned build
ing expansion and land-use permit
have attracted criticism from

some local residents.
One such resident is Palo Altan
Enid Pearson, president of the
1,000-member Committee for
Green Foothills.
She said her committee, which
has monitored Stanford develop
ment for 26 years, believes Stan
ford's desire for money eclipses
its concern for the "great
resource" of the land.
"Stanford is totally out of con
trol," she said. She predicted if
the University gets the new land
use permit it "will not have to
answer to anyone" when it decides
to build.
University Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Freelen con
tested Pearson's statements that
the University will have complete
autonomy in its plans to build.
"Things will essentially function
the way they do now," he said.
"All plans have to be submitted
to the county for review."
Freelen said developing the in
ner campus is the best way to
"shepherd" the finite amount of
Stanford land. The University's
land is part of its endowment,
which gives money for research
