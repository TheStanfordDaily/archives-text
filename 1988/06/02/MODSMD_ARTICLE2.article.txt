# Inner campus growth planned
## Foothill development to be kept at bay 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Stanford's construction plans
up to the year 2000 call for de
velopment of the inner campus,
not sprawl in the foothills, accord
ing to a University report released
last week.
Private consultants, hired by
the University to complete an en
vironmental impact report, will
look at the 18-page summariza
tion of the University's construc
tion plans this month as Stanford
attempts to obtain a new land-use
permit for its unincorporated
lands.
Ransom Bratton of the Santa
Clara County planning office said
the new land-use permit will bet
ter define Stanford's power to
decide upon development of areas
south of Junipero Serra Boule
vard, along Willow Road and along
El Camino Real. It will also at
tempt to clear up any jurisdiction
questions between the University
and surrounding communities by
putting "interpretive things in
writing," he said.
The University's planned build
ing expansion and land-use permit
have attracted criticism from

some local residents.
One such resident is Palo Altan
Enid Pearson, president of the
1,000-member Committee for
Green Foothills.
She said her committee, which
has monitored Stanford develop
ment for 26 years, believes Stan
ford's desire for money eclipses
its concern for the "great
resource" of the land.
"Stanford is totally out of con
trol," she said. She predicted if
the University gets the new land
use permit it "will not have to
answer to anyone" when it decides
to build.
University Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Freelen con
tested Pearson's statements that
the University will have complete
autonomy in its plans to build.
"Things will essentially function
the way they do now," he said.
"All plans have to be submitted
to the county for review."
Freelen said developing the in
ner campus is the best way to
"shepherd" the finite amount of
Stanford land. The University's
land is part of its endowment,
which gives money for research
needs, Freelen explained. Con
stricting the area of development
for teaching and research pur
poses will benefit the academic
program by centralizing those ac
tivities, he said.
According to the report, inner
campus construction will add ap
proximately 3.8 million square
feet of buildings. Some of the pro
posed buildings are a drama
theater; housing for undergradu
ates, graduates and members of
faculty and staff; an athletic com
plex; and an addition to the Med
ical Center.
Most of the proposed campus
development will add to already
existing buildings, the report
states.
It also states that over two-

Over two-thirds of
Stanford's 8,200
acres will remain
open or only lightly
used.

thirds of Stanford's 8,200 acres
will remain open or only lightly
used, even if all the proposed fa
cilities are built.
The only proposed construction
in the foothills are a Westin Hotel
— near the junction of Interstate
280 and Sand Hill Road in Menlo
Park — and art studios, to be
built south of Junipero Serra
Boulevard, across from Lake La
gunita.
The proposed hotel has been
controversial because it would
take up land in the foothills, an

area some people want to remain
free of construction. Pearson said
she fears the hotel may set a prec
edent that "begs to have the
of the land developed.
However, Freelen said there is
no more commercial-zoned land
in that area so the hotel "would
not act as a magnet" for more
building. He added that a hotel
on that site would bring in reve
nue to Stanford's endowment for
teaching and research.
Provost James Rosse, who pre
sented the report to the Faculty
Senate last week, said it was
drafted now in order to update
the Santa Clara County planning
office in its work to determine
the feasibility of a new land-use
permit.
Bratton said public opinion will
be included in the EIR. It is then
up to the county's planning com
mission to adopt the permit.
