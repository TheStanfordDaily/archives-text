Midnight vigil goes awry
Seven students used masks,
candles and whispers in a mid
night vigil last week with the
stated intent of supporting the
right to free speech of an Otero
freshman evicted from Univer
sity housing.
But the seven evoked images
of the Ku Klux KJan, not the
Bill of Rights, although later
said they were ignorant of the
history implied in their protest.
Campus minorities con
demned the vigil and met with
University President Donald
Kennedy to discuss how to avoid
such problems in the future.
Date rape revealed
When Dr. Ruth Westheimer

came to campus in the fall of
1986, she dismissed date rape
as a "bandwagon" phenomenon.
But the good doctor took a fall
this year as the date rape stories
of three Stanford students were
revealed in January.
The stories told to The Daily
by the three women, who re
quested anonymity, took place
at Stanford fraternities, but
clearly fraternities were not the
only problem spot. A survey of
colleges across the country
showed that one woman in eight
had been raped, and 90 percent
of those were by acquaintances
or intimate friends.
Few women ever report such
rapes to the police.

A pair of champs
Stanford's streak of grabbing
at least one NCAA title in every
year of the 1980s was in jeopardy
going into May. The women's
and men's tennis teams were
both highly ranked â€” but be
cause the women would be play
ing without their season-long
No. 1 player and the men had
yet to put together a solid match
top-to-bottom, optmism did not
reign.
But in two weeks time, Stan
ford nabbed both the men's' and
women's titles, and (ho, hum)
the streak was still on. Despite
the loss of freshman Tami Whit
linger to injury, the women
knocked off Florida 5-2 to win
their unprecedented third

straight NCAA crown, and a
week later, the men capsized
Louisiana State's title dreams by
the same score.
Computer thief nabbed
A Stanford senior was ar
rested in early May on several
counts of larceny and grand
theft for a series of Stanford
Bookstore computer thefts total
ing nearly $60,000.
Jose Fernandez, former pres
ident of the Theta Xi fraternity,
allegedly used trash bins to re
move up to 20 computer systems
and a considerable amount of
other merchandise from the
store for a period of approxi
mately six months.
