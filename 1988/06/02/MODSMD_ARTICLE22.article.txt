## Editor's farewell 
### 
MOST OFTEN on my mind
these last days as editor of
The Daily has been the
recent candlelight vigil at Otero.
It captures an important question
of this school year: Are we too
sensitive to racial issues at Stan
ford?
This year our community has
become more conscious of, and
more sensitive to, situations with
racial implications. Many argue
that we see racism where there is
none; that we are fryper-sensitive.
We are. It's understandable be
cause of the racial tension here.
But in some ways, it's a problem.
Some cautioned after the vigil
that candles and masks do not nec
essarily equal racism. In another
place, at another time, that may
be true. Candles are not burning
crosses. And a hockey mask may
call to mind Friday the 13th movies
faster than it does the KKK. But
in the climate here and now, the
incident could only be perceived as
racist.
I was in Otero when the seven
protesters arrived. They stood out
side the dorm's glass doors. The
first students to notice them
screamed. Others ran away. One
cried. Several said the words "Ku
Klux Klan."
The protesters said they didn't
know the implications of their
protest. In a year that Stanford
news was filled with race-related
stories, in a year of forums and
discussions, in a year that The New
York Times framed our Western
Culture revision as a race issue,
in a year that Jesse Jackson and
William Bennett discussed race on
campus, the protesters said they
didn't know.
Many doubt the protesters'
claim of ignorance. Others accept
it and argue that it proves we need
classes on minority experiences.
Some slam fraternities, saying the
seven Phi Delts were ignorant be

cause they live in a "vacuum."
Where to place blame is a question
sure to be raised next year.
We will also ask the "too sensi
tive" question: Did we overreact
to what may have been a prank?
Yes and no. Yes, because the
seven wanted publicity. They called
our news offices before the protest,
looking for coverage. Local and na
tional media jumped on the story.
Yes, because it's questionable how
sincere the seven were in their
protest.
No, because the protesters
scared the hell out of a lot of
people. They should have been
aware of how this community
would react to their protest meth
ods. No, because there is mistreat
ment at Stanford due to race. For
example, people still assume some
students were admitted because of
skin color and respect them less.
We have to decide if oversen
sitivity is good or bad. An ex
tremely sensitive smoke alarm will
protect you from fire, but it also
will make you panic when your
toast is burning.
Our oversensitivity to the vigil
caused us to overlook other ques
tions raised in Otero. How do we
feel about living with openly gay
people? Does Res Ed have a "left
wing political agenda"? In order to
ensure the "open exchange of
ideas," should the University allow
even abusive speech, or should it
prevent speech that "discourages
students' full participation" in dis
course?
These issues affect our daily
lives, just as racial issues do. They
shouldn't get lost in the hype.
