## Hoover is needed to counter Stanford's liberal bias 
### 
ONCE AGAIN a Daily editorial
has called for the "depoliticiz
ing" of the philosophically con
servative Hoover Institution. The May
25 editorial was an absurd criticism of
an institution which has done more to
keep Stanford in the mainstream of
American political thought than any
other on campus.
Wake up, guys. Stanford is not just
liberal, it's superliberal. Hoover has a
much more even political distribution
than either Prof. John Manley's Politi
cal Science Department or Prof. Ron
Rebholz's English Department.
But critics respond, "Hoover has ties
to the Reagan administration (gasp)."
Of course it does. As The Daily points
out, the Hoover Institution has many

"world-class scholars."
It would be immoral for our coun
try's top social scientists to shirk their
responsibilities as citizens when asked
to assist the duly elected executive
branch of government.
So what is the real source of Hoover
bashing? I think it lies in the fact that
Stanford leans so far to the left that
Hoover makes people at Stanford
uneasy.
It's easy to feel secure when a phi
losophy has no competition. It makes
policy choices obvious, the competition
seem ridiculous and the path to
righteousness clear and wide.
The logic used in such reasoning is
appallingly simple: If we believe that is
in society's interest for the government

to ensure financial equality, then a
policy of income redistribution seems
unambiguously good.
People who favor policies that don't
ensure income redistribution are either
unenlightened or evil. What if someone
else argues that income redistribution
is not in society's interest â€” that it
will drive our standard of living back
to the stone age? There the choices
aren't so easy.
I think many at Stanford do not
want to hear the down side of a liberal
approach. But at a university the free
exchange and competition between
political philosophies is healthy and
essential.
If Stanford had an even distribution
of liberal and conservative professors,

then a conservative Hoover would be
bad. Unfortunately the distribution of
professors is skewed to the left.
Hoover creates a sort of philosophi
cal pluralism which ensures that the
level of debate goes beyond Marxists
and socialists arguing about how to
carve up the capitalist pie.
