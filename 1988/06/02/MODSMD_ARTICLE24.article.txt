# Quit whining about financial aid law
## 
### 
When will Stanford students appreci
ate the easy life they have? We are
writing in response to the May 24
article about the increase in the
amount that students on financial aid
must pay out of their own pockets.
The new legislation requires students
to contribute 70 percent of their earn
ings or $900, whichever is more,
toward the payment of their own edu
cation.
Roberta Johnson of the Financial
Aids Office indicated that Stanford was
trying to find a loophole in the law so
that students would have to pay $900
maximum.
Why try to find a loophole? Why not
follow the spirit of the law and make
Stanford students face their responsi
bility?
Miguel Marquez stated it eliminated
incentive to work hard. Why? Why
would someone work less hard when

they have the opportunity to repay
their debt to society?
Society is providing many students
with the opportunity to gain an educa
tion that they could not have other
wise. Yet these same students do not
want their leisure money taken away,
calling it a penalty.
Too bad. You have a tough life.
Maybe you would like to find out what
it is like to pay for your whole educa
tion, then you would apprciate any
assistance, no matter how small.
There are a lot of people who would
like to ei\joy a sunny California after
noon, but can't because they are in a
steel mill working.
Meanwhile their tax money is fund
ing your day in the sun, so that you
can complain that the government
takes away so much money, you can't
buy that Stanford T-shirt and cup of
fro yo.
Stop crying, Stanford, and think
about the real world."
