# Residence priority benefited students
## 
### 
It is unfortunate that the University
has decided to eliminate the Returning
Resident Priority. The May 23 editorial
stated the Draw, with the priority, was
unfair because people who drew into a
"good" house (as defined by how low
their Draw number was) were allowed
to stay there "the rest of their
guaranteed years."
How many years was that exactly?
One. We are all given a freshman
dorm and then we draw the next year.
Freshman year did not guarantee a
Returning Resident Priority and our
unguaranteed years did not give us a
priority.
The priority was something we got
once and only once. To me that did
not seem to be the undeniably evil
thing that people, specifically the
editors of The Daily, made it out to
be.
The editorial also states that any
continuity in the house can be main-

tained by the returning kitchen mana
ger, house manager and theme associ
ate.
Thank God houses will still have the
same food and the same bureaucracy.
There is more to a house's identity
than a theme associate and kitchen
manager. This is not to mention the
houses without theme associates.
I'm talking more about learning
about and developing a character in a
house, instead of having random roofs
that we can all live under. We should
all live in identical apartments if
equity is what Res Ed is all about.
I have found the experience of living
in the same place two years in a row,
regardless of which one it is, to be
more useful and more in the spirit of
Residential Education than forcing us
to hop about from new house to new
house every year.
It is sad that the Returning Resident
Priority is gone, but at least now we
can be thankful that there is no more
University-sponsored oppression in the
Stanford housing system.
