## Some final reflections 
### 
WELL, HERE we are. The end of
finals soon approaching, the end
of college for some of us, the end
of Volume 193 of The Daily — in short,
the end of another year.
So what parting words shall we leave
with?
We'll start with something lighthearted
— the good and the bad at Stanford.
These things are good at Stanford: the
sun in our faces, the people we meet,
the palm trees all swaying, jazz in the
Coffee House and the classes and words
that spark our fire.
These things are bad at Stanford: the
tension of Dead Week, the pressure to
succeed, the conflicts that tear the
campus, the Stanford Review and, often,
Boathouse Rock.
As for the good, after spending my
first year on campus here, I have to say
that I've really enjoyed it. As a columnist
this quarter, I have encountered more
interesting people and ideas than I ever
expected to.
It has been fascinating to debate with
liberals, conservatives, communists, pro
fessors, nudists and Zen Buddhists alike.
For all those friendly but frankly very
weird graduate students that have ap
proached me in the Coffee House, just a
small personal message for you: I'm a
columnist, not a dating service. (This, of
course, is not the main issue of conflict
on campus.)
Next year we must once again face real
conflicts on campus — more pressing
issues such as racism, homophobia, di
vestment, Western culture and student
responsibility.
So many people have said that univer
sities are a source of change, a force of

growth for the nation. Hopefully, after
a summer of reflection, we will be a little
bit wiser, a little bit more prepared to
take on this role of educating ourselves,
our community and our nation.
As E. E. Cummings said, "The seeker
of truth follows no path, all paths lead
to the truth. . . . Truth is here." Maybe
at Stanford, maybe not at Stanford, but
here nonetheless.
Truth has an existence independent of
experience, it sits quietly, waiting for our
eager minds, never waning, a constant
source of stability in an ever-changing
world.
In some ways, Cummings' quote sums
up our reasons for being here rather than
at the beach or in an office. We come to
Stanford to learn, to experience and to
grow.
What should we leave with, then, at
the end of every year? Carl Sagan once
said that in all his education, what was
most valuable to him was learning one
field thoroughly, his mastery of a disci
pline and sense of accomplishment at
doing so.
Similarly, when we leave here, we
should leave with the feeling that we
have mastered something. Not necessar
ily theoretical physics; in fact, not even
an entire discipline. Just enough to feel
fulfilled.
Sculptress Louise Nevelson, at age 88,
expressed this sentiment well, saying,
"The work I do, I've done basically for
me ... because I've wanted to give mean
ing to my life. It's the very best way I
know how to live my life. How else could
I live it? Every day I've lived I've wanted
to flower more and more."
One of my favorite quotes, in The
Desiderata, echoes this notion: "Keep in

terested in your own career, however
humble. It is a real possession in the
changing fortunes of time. Exercise cau
tion in your business affairs; for the
world is full of trickery. But let this not
blind you to what virtue there is; many
persons strive for high ideals; and every
where, life is full of heroism."
Hopefully, we will have learned here
that finding a career is not a stagnant,
deadening process. Like the artist, we
should strive to seek the life of growth
and development, of change and the
flowering of our creative beings.
Every day of our lives should be an
experience in and of itself — fresh and
new. The experiences of our lives should
refresh and revitalize — every day a
rebirth. Cummings wrote as such: "We
can never be born enough. We are human
beings; for whom birth is a supremely
welcome mystery, the mystery of
growing, the mystery which happens only
and whenever we are faithful to our
selves."
So when we leave this institution of
higher learning, with our achievements
and our plans, we should realize as Alfred
North Whitehead did that every day will
be a new challenge. "It is the business
of the future," he said, "to be dangerous."
So, be careful. Strive to be happy.

flowering of our creative beings.
Every day of our lives should be an
experience in and of itself — fresh and
new. The experiences of our lives should
refresh and revitalize — every day a
rebirth. Cummings wrote as such: "We
can never be born enough. We are human
beings; for whom birth is a supremely
welcome mystery, the mystery of
growing, the mystery which happens only
and whenever we are faithful to our
selves."
So when we leave this institution of
higher learning, with our achievements
and our plans, we should realize as Alfred
North Whitehead did that every day will
be a new challenge. "It is the business
of the future," he said, "to be dangerous."
So, be careful. Strive to be happy.
