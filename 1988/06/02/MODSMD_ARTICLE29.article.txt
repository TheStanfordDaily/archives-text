Graduation pledge
won't be enough
A graduation pledge calls upon grad
uating seniors to examine the "social
and environmental" consequences of
prospective jobs. However well
intentioned the effort, the pledge is an
ineffectual strategy for creating social
awareness among Stanford's graduates.
How can students who have not
examined the social and environmental
ramifications of jobs in the past be
expected to change their behavior after
uttering a two-sentence resolution
before entering the business world?
If a change in attitude is to occur,
social awareness must be incorporated
into the job search itself. Why
shouldn't the Career Planning and
Placement Center's corporate bro
chures include articles (or a relevant
bibliography) that' question companies'
social and environmental performances?
Social awareness begins with having
the available information to make re
sponsible, informed choices. It's time
we stop pledging and take the steps to
make ourselves aware before we are
confronted with a "fait accompli" of
complicity and ignorance.

4 Homophobic' is
a misleading term
I wish to question the apparently
casual use of the word "homophobic"
by University officials and The Daily
in connection with the recent eviction
of Otero freshman Kenny Ehrman
from University housing. The term
seems to be thrown around with little
regard to the image engendered.
Although a check of several dic
tionaries confirmed my suspicion that
"homophobic" is not a real word,
clearly the term carries an intended
connotation: an irrational fear of ho
mosexuals.

But to apply this word to any indi
vidual who personally dislikes
homosexual lifestyles or homosexual
activities is unfair. Merely because one
disapproves of homosexuals is no rea
son to apply a word that has a con
notation of irrational fear.
1 do not know what Ehrman's views
on homosexuals are. One can assume
that, at the very least, he views
homosexuality as "wrong" — perhaps
morally wrong.
He has every right to hold this view,
just as any student has a right to feel
that abortion, capital punishment,
apartheid or aid to the Contras is
"wrong." That this student chose to
hold this opinion is not sufficient to
label him, in essence, an irrational
person.
Perhaps Ehrman did indeed hold
irrational fears toward homosexuals.
However, it seems that only a psychol
ogist or someone who knew Ehrman's
views extremely well and had his confi
dence would be in a position to judge
whether Ehrman was really "homopho
bic."
While the Otero resident assistants
and resident fellow might have been in
this position, it seems that the term
was used too casually and without
sufficient consideration for the image
created of Ehrman by people connected
with the incident.
And certainly University officials,
including University President Donald
Kennedy, who are at least one step
removed from the freshman's actions,
cannot so carelessly label Ehrman "ho
mophobic" without having personal
insight into his views.
It is unfortunate many people
presupposed that an attitude of fear
was necessarily an element in this
student's personal views on
homosexuality.

Combat ignorance
through education
The seven men who protested re
cently with masks and candles claimed
ignorance as their excuse for conjuring

up images of the Ku Klux Klan.
I think, to make an understatement,
their ignorance points to a fundamen
tal flaw in our educational system —
We are not being educated about the
real world.
Whether we understand it or not,
most people do not actually live in
Disneyland, and Stanford should pro
vide us with more than a Disneyland
education.
Let's expand ethnic and gender
studies programs, institutionalize such
courses as requirements and forcefully
implement the new Cultures, Ideas and
Values course so that understanding
and mutual respect will replace ignor
ance on this campus.

Labor negotiations
should be opened up
As students involved in community
and social justice issues on campus, we
are concerned about the upcoming
negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers.
These negotiations have a profound
impact on the Stanford community:
faculty, students, staff and the workers
themselves.
In the past, there has been much
confusion over the issues in negotia
tions. We want to see negotiations
opened up as a way to bring this
serious campus issue out of the closet
and allow the Stanford community to
be well-informed about an issue that
affects us all.
The negotiations cannot be con
ducted in a three-ring circus. However,
having a few silent observers from the
campus groups and the ASSU
will not create this kind of problem.
In the past, three union workers
have been allowed to be overservers;
we see no problem with having student
observers as well. The ASSU Executive
Committee could select the student
representatives.
Historically, the University has dis
couraged interaction between students
and workers. Before the union,
workers were sometimes disciplined for

speaking with students.
The University has also in the past
used its resources to promote its view
of negotiations without equal time for
the union's side. In 1985, the Univer
sity administration used the Residen
tial Education system of resident fel
lows and resident assistants to dis
tribute management literature
downplaying workers and their needs.
We are concerned that this year's
negotiations be fair and visible to the
Stanford community. Workers are an
important part of the Stanford commu
nity and one that we respect.
We see University support for open
negotiations as the first step in admin
istrative commitment to treating the
union in a fair and just fashion.

Students' behavior
indicates bigotry
It disturbs me that a fellow Stanford
student would rack up a history of
saying and doing bigoted things, but it
doesn't surprise me. After all, there's
one in every crowd, right?
However, it blows me away that
there were seven more of them to
protest the disciplinary action leveled
at freshman Kenny Ehrman for his
antagonistic and homophobic behavior.
The "candlelight vigil" on May 24 at
Otero sounds awfully familiar to me,
and I imagine that the protestors
chose candles and masks only because
they couldn't get their hands on
torches and didn't want to cut eye
holes in their pillow cases.
These guys were Stanford students?

It doesn't really make any difference.
Stanford students, like the rest of the
human race, come in every sex, color,
religion, sexual orientation fluid yes —
variety to hate.
Stanford students learn about other
kinds of people by interacting with
them and that includes learning about
bigots. It's a shame that this peu*t of
the lesson has to be so negative, but
perhaps by seeing these people in ac
tion, students can learn how to deal
with them.
Perhaps the demonstration that
hatred and bigotry still exist can help
to bring about their ultimate elimina
tion.

Offensive incidents
need explanations
A May 17 letter was printed from
two students who were disturbed by
portrayals of women at two fraternity
parties that they perceived to be sexist
and misogynous.
The letter described a mural at the
Taxi house "of a gladiator holding a
whip and a sword with the words, 'I'm
a gladiator, where's my wench?' " An
even more alarming accusation de
scribed a red-stained and naked female
mannequin on the floor of the Kappa
Alpha house.
Since the printing of the letter, nei
ther the KAs nor the Taxis have
responded to these accusations. The
Stanford community deserves an expla
nation for these incidents, if there is
one, and an apology for such ignorance
if there is not.
Furthermore, if the Greek system at
Stanford is truly concerned with break
ing down sexist stereotypes, it must
discuss openly occurrences like these
which loudly confirm these stereotypes.
Sexism will never be defeated if it is
simply ignored. It must be confronted
directly.

Graduation pledge
won't be enough
A graduation pledge calls upon grad
uating seniors to examine the "social
and environmental" consequences of
prospective jobs. However well
intentioned the effort, the pledge is an
ineffectual strategy for creating social
awareness among Stanford's graduates.
How can students who have not
examined the social and environmental
ramifications of jobs in the past be
expected to change their behavior after
uttering a two-sentence resolution
before entering the business world?
If a change in attitude is to occur,
social awareness must be incorporated
into the job search itself. Why
shouldn't the Career Planning and
Placement Center's corporate bro
chures include articles (or a relevant
bibliography) that' question companies'
social and environmental performances?
Social awareness begins with having
the available information to make re
sponsible, informed choices. It's time
we stop pledging and take the steps to
make ourselves aware before we are
confronted with a "fait accompli" of
complicity and ignorance.

4 Homophobic' is
a misleading term
I wish to question the apparently
casual use of the word "homophobic"
by University officials and The Daily
in connection with the recent eviction
of Otero freshman Kenny Ehrman
from University housing. The term
seems to be thrown around with little
regard to the image engendered.
Although a check of several dic
tionaries confirmed my suspicion that
"homophobic" is not a real word,
clearly the term carries an intended
connotation: an irrational fear of ho
mosexuals.

But to apply this word to any indi
vidual who personally dislikes
homosexual lifestyles or homosexual
activities is unfair. Merely because one
disapproves of homosexuals is no rea
son to apply a word that has a con
notation of irrational fear.
1 do not know what Ehrman's views
on homosexuals are. One can assume
that, at the very least, he views
homosexuality as "wrong" — perhaps
morally wrong.
He has every right to hold this view,
just as any student has a right to feel
that abortion, capital punishment,
apartheid or aid to the Contras is
"wrong." That this student chose to
hold this opinion is not sufficient to
label him, in essence, an irrational
person.
Perhaps Ehrman did indeed hold
irrational fears toward homosexuals.
However, it seems that only a psychol
ogist or someone who knew Ehrman's
views extremely well and had his confi
dence would be in a position to judge
whether Ehrman was really "homopho
bic."
While the Otero resident assistants
and resident fellow might have been in
this position, it seems that the term
was used too casually and without
sufficient consideration for the image
created of Ehrman by people connected
with the incident.
And certainly University officials,
including University President Donald
Kennedy, who are at least one step
removed from the freshman's actions,
cannot so carelessly label Ehrman "ho
mophobic" without having personal
insight into his views.
It is unfortunate many people
presupposed that an attitude of fear
was necessarily an element in this
student's personal views on
homosexuality.

Combat ignorance
through education
The seven men who protested re
cently with masks and candles claimed
ignorance as their excuse for conjuring

up images of the Ku Klux Klan.
I think, to make an understatement,
their ignorance points to a fundamen
tal flaw in our educational system —
We are not being educated about the
real world.
Whether we understand it or not,
most people do not actually live in
Disneyland, and Stanford should pro
vide us with more than a Disneyland
education.
Let's expand ethnic and gender
studies programs, institutionalize such
courses as requirements and forcefully
implement the new Cultures, Ideas and
Values course so that understanding
and mutual respect will replace ignor

Labor negotiations
should be opened up
As students involved in community
and social justice issues on campus, we
are concerned about the upcoming
negotiations between the University
and the United Stanford Workers.
These negotiations have a profound
impact on the Stanford community:
faculty, students, staff and the workers
themselves.
In the past, there has been much
confusion over the issues in negotia
tions. We want to see negotiations
opened up as a way to bring this
serious campus issue out of the closet
and allow the Stanford community to
be well-informed about an issue that
affects us all.
The negotiations cannot be con
ducted in a three-ring circus. However,
having a few silent observers from the
campus groups and the ASSU
will not create this kind of problem.
In the past, three union workers
have been allowed to be overservers;
we see no problem with having student
observers as well. The ASSU Executive
Committee could select the student
representatives.
Historically, the University has dis
couraged interaction between students
and workers. Before the union,
workers were sometimes disciplined for

speaking with students.
The University has also in the past
used its resources to promote its view
of negotiations without equal time for
the union's side. In 1985, the Univer
sity administration used the Residen
tial Education system of resident fel
lows and resident assistants to dis
tribute management literature
downplaying workers and their needs.
We are concerned that this year's
negotiations be fair and visible to the
Stanford community. Workers are an
important part of the Stanford commu
nity and one that we respect.
We see University support for open
negotiations as the first step in admin
istrative commitment to treating the
union in a fair and just fashion.
