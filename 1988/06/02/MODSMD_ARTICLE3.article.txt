has been the least successful of the four
featured objectives of the Centennial
Campaign and is presenting an obstacle
in building new undergraduate housing.
Director of Student Housing Rodger
Whitney said the University plans to
build about 400 new undergraduate
spaces either on Manzanita Park or on
the driving range near the Stanford Barn.
Centennial Campaign officials hope to
have the housing available by the fall of
1992 and expect it to cost about $21
million, according to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Norman Robinson.
Robinson stressed, however, that such
estimates are highly optimistic and the
project could cost substantially more and
take longer to complete. Bennett said the

Facing problems in the area of new
student housing, the University Centen
nial Campaign's five-year mission to seek
out more funds for new buildings and
professors has so far received mixed
results.
The campaign, currently in its 15th
month, is broken down into a number
of target categories. One such objective,

Robinson said a committee for choosing
the site of the proposed buildings needs
more time to determine which location

to use. He said the Centennial Campaign
will still raise some preliminary funds
without the project being "site-specific."
The University publicly announced the
beginning of the campaign in February
1987 and so far has reached about half
of its fund-raising goals, accumulating

$536 million out of a goal of $1.1 billion,
Bennett said. However, he said, the cam
paign announcement was made only after
the University already collected over $300
million, thus making the net gain of the
Centennial Campaign from last year only
about $200 million.
Bennett said this stockpiling procedure
is normal in a large fund-raising cam
paign and ensures that the drive will
begin on a steady foot.
The Campaign has been most success
ful in raising funds for faculty support
and academic endowments. According to
Bennett, the category for this objective
has raised $100 million out of a goal of
