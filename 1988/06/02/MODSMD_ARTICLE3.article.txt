# Fund-raising problems cramp housing development

has been the least successful of the four
featured objectives of the Centennial
Campaign and is presenting an obstacle
in building new undergraduate housing.
Director of Student Housing Rodger
Whitney said the University plans to
build about 400 new undergraduate
spaces either on Manzanita Park or on
the driving range near the Stanford Barn.
Centennial Campaign officials hope to
have the housing available by the fall of
1992 and expect it to cost about $21
million, according to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Norman Robinson.
Robinson stressed, however, that such
estimates are highly optimistic and the
project could cost substantially more and
take longer to complete. Bennett said the

Facing problems in the area of new
student housing, the University Centen
nial Campaign's five-year mission to seek
out more funds for new buildings and
professors has so far received mixed
results.

The campaign, currently in its 15th month, is broken
down into a number of target categories. One such
objective, undergraduate education, currently has
raised $32 million, about 30 percent of its expected goal
of $106 million.

Office of Development is having problems
raising funds for the project because a
suitable location has not yet been selec
ted.
Robinson said a committee for choosing
the site of the proposed buildings needs
more time to determine which location

to use. He said the Centennial Campaign
will still raise some preliminary funds
without the project being "site-specific."
The University publicly announced the
beginning of the campaign in February
1987 and so far has reached about half
of its fund-raising goals, accumulating

$536 million out of a goal of $1.1 billion,
Bennett said. However, he said, the cam
paign announcement was made only after
the University already collected over $300
million, thus making the net gain of the
Centennial Campaign from last year only
about $200 million.
Bennett said this stockpiling procedure
is normal in a large fund-raising cam
paign and ensures that the drive will
begin on a steady foot.
The Campaign has been most success
ful in raising funds for faculty support
and academic endowments. According to
Bennett, the category for this objective
has raised $100 million out of a goal of
$206 million. Bennett sAid Cam
paign officials hope to pledge
enough funds for 100 new profes
sorships. So far, 35 new profes
sors have been pledged, with five
humanities positions already
filled, he said.
Besides the objectives of under
graduate education and faculty
support, other objectives include
money for new science and engi
neering buildings and "un
restricted" funds.
The push for science facilities
funding has earned $68 million
out of a goal of $180 million and
the unspecified funds, which the
University can use at its discre
tion, tally at $32 million out of a
goal of $75 million.
With regard to the new housing,

Robinson pointed out a number
of problems that are delaying the
committee's decision on the loca
tion of the buildings. The Man
zanita Park site currently houses
about 350 students, and building
on it would displace these stu
dents as well as eliminate revenue
from the rent which would nor
mally be paid while the building
is under construction, Robinson
said.
Whitney said the new residen
ces would be placed in Manzanita,
however, if the committee deter
mined that enough graduate stu
dents could be housed elsewhere,
mainly in the new Rains Houses.
The committee is also hesitant
about placing the buildings on the
driving range, said Robinson, be
cause of the loss of the range to
the athletic department and be
cause of concern that such resi
dences would be too far from the
rest of the campus.
