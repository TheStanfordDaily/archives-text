# BSU chair attacks student ignorance, passivity and racism
## 
### 
IT IS an unfortunate fact of life
that most students at Stanford are
white, middle class, privileged,
sheltered and apathetic. These attri
butes are usually considered advanta
geous in this world.
However, this student generation
must face the reality that the new
world is populated by dark, poor,
underprivileged, attacked and fervent
peoples who are quickly running out of
patience.
Having been at the helm of one of
the only student organizations on this
campus which is committed to making
waves instead of damping waves, I
have seen the reactions of our "leaders
of the future" to change.
Sorry boys and girls, you all failed
miserably in the "Stanford Stress
Response Test," also known as the
BSU fee assessment vote.
You say "How did we fail? All we
were trying to do was teach you all a
lesson. You black people are always
griping and moaning, and we're not
going to pay you to gripe and moan.
Use someone else's money."
What the 51.1 percent of students
on campus who voted against the BSU
fee assessment were voting against
were community service programs,
dorm outreach programs, Jesse Jack
son and Yolanda King speeches, libra
ries for East Palo Alto kids and "chill
outs" in White Plaza.
All of the marches, rallies, yelling,
screaming, protesting and general
wavemaking cost between $75 and
$200, out of a total budget of $18,000.
The cost of one ASSU election would
fund 35 years of political agitation,
which is just a small portion of the
BSU agenda.
"How could we have been so ignor
ant to vote against community service
when all we wanted to stop was the
griping and moaning of a special inter
est group?"
Why, because the average Stanford
student, like the average U.S. citizen,
does not care enough to face reality
when he or she can be given a simple
explanation for a very complex problem
like racial prejudice. It seems easy for
a Stanford student or other privileged
member of society to sit and wait for
the problems to go away and collect
his ticket to the suburbs. Unfortunate-

ly, the problem is you.
Before I continue, I will take a
moment to help you overcome the
ignorance, which most students have,
of political terminology. The BSU has
had 20 years of training — most of
y'all haven't. Here are the definitions 1
use, just so you know from where I'm
coming:
Black — an African person or a mem
ber of the diaspora of African peoples
throughout the world.
Persons of Color — any of the non-
Caucasion peoples, including Africans,
Asians, Chicanos/Latinos, American
Indians or other ethnic groups. Com
monly called minorities, Third World
people or other inaccurate names.
Prejudice — to judge a person's attri
butes based on a set of preconceived
notions or stereotypes.
Discrimination — to treat an individ
ual or group differently and disadvan-
due to distinct arbitrary
characteristics.
Racist — one who actively oppresses
or mistreats a group of people based
on race.
Racism — to experience mistreatment
or oppression based on race.
Institutional racism — racism per
petuated by the passive and active
action of a social institution. Does not
require individual action to perpetuate,
but is experienced by individuals.
Progressive — a person committed to
active change of a social system to
favor those on the bottom levels of a
socio-economic system.
Conservative — a person committed to
conserving present social conditions,
which favor those in control of a
socio-economic system.
Activist — one who acts for change.
Reactionary — one who reacts to
change.
Protest — to actively disagree with a
policy or situation.
To be political — to use structured
social forums, institutions and organ
ized individuals to impact a social
group.
Passivity — the act of not responding
to stimuli, usually in order to preserve
a favorable situation or emotional
state.

You can argue with the BSU, but
you cannot accuse us of not under
standing exactly what we are doing.
People thought I was the only black
person yelling "racism and protest" on
campus, or worse, I was the head of a
monolithic body of black militants. The
fact of the matter is that there are at
least 700 people, of all races and back
grounds, yelling the same thing.
Unfortunately, the media like to
single out one leader, and they picked
me. The BSU, MEChA, Students
United for a Democratic Education,
Asian-American Students Association,
Stanford Organization for Lesbian and
Gay Equality and a few other organi
zations on this campus are actually
trying to change this campus.
My role in the activist student move
ment is a very minor part of the
massive student movement building
across the nation. I am a 140-pound
pre-med, for heaven's sake, so if a
nerd like me can bring fear into the
hearts of provosts just imagine what a
bunch of real, intimidating, committed
students of color could do.
The student movement is often lead
by black students, because we have
been exposed to the ostracism,
mistrust, misunderstanding and hatred
associated with trying to change soci
ety, merely by being black in a racist
society.
However, black students are only the
most organized, not the sole, group.
Women, Chicanos, Asians, ethnic mi
norities and progressive whites have
been involved in change; they just
don't get their pictures in the paper.
Unfortunately, for blacks, we only get
our pictures in the paper when we
protest or fail and not when we
succeed.
My response, and you may quote me,
is "Kiss my black behind!" In the
BSU, to be attacked is to be effective,
since most of the attackers are the
very people we are trying to change.
Anyone who actually knows me, has
seen that 1 am actually a very soft
spoken, polite, shy and studious young
man. However, this year I have been
seen as aggressive and militant because
I was the chair of the BSU.
Don't get me wrong. I am assertive,
loud and outspoken when I need to be,

but I wouldn't use those terms to
describe my personality. Now, all of
the middle-class white people reading
this, say "black man" and then the
first five adjectives that come into your
mind. I suffer from the same
stereotypes and caricatures forced upon
all blacks.
The fact of the matter is, that we,
like any other political organization,
use proposals, committees, petitions,
budgets, speeches, letters and meetings
in our work.
However, what most students and
Daily writers see are rallies, protests
and marches. Why? Because they are
blinded by this racist environment to
see blacks as aggressive.
This distorted view is institutional
racism at its best. No, we didn't cry
wolf, you all haven't experienced rac
ism and therefore don't know when it
does and doesn't exist.
I am about to say something which
will be misquoted and misunderstood
.. . ready ... I do not like most white
people. Now don't get excited if you're
white and a friend of mine or are
actively committed to helping people.
Most white students at Stanford
don't care or act on anything except
their own experience, and I don't like
people who don't care. To overcome
the effects of living in a racist, sexist,
exploitative society calls for active
people, not passive ignorant fools who
don't mind their own apathy.
If you are fuming mad at me, you
are probably one of those fools that
most students of color don't like or
even worse are a student of color who
is not planning on helping their own
people.
If you don't understand what I'm
talking about you probably also voted
against the BSU, SaLSA or Jesse
Jackson. We don't like you because
you have all the advantages in the
world and aren't trying to help or even
understand the plight most of the
world which is of color, is exploited
and is hungry.
How can you fight against hunger,
homelessness or apartheid if you can't
even walk into a black theme house? If
you can't handle a little discomfort for
being different, how can you handle
nuclear war?

There are a lot of problems for our
generation to solve and as Malcolm X
said, "If you're not a part of the solu
tion, you are a part of the problem."
Face it folks, we are in a messed-up
world where most of its inhabitants
don't like us and for good reason.
If you are a conservative or reaction
ary I hope you are in love with your
self because most of the world doesn't
like you. Why not? Because you are in
favor of "every man for himself,"
healthy competition and supply-side
economics while people are having
trouble eating and staying alive, due to
your Keynesian economics and "evil
empire" defense policies.
If you are insulted by my "attacks"
on "whites" and "people with other
views," you have missed my point
again. I am trying to stimulate you to
action, to involvement and to change
of the world for the better instead of
the preservation of your few advan
tages.
I hope we can all see that in this
world the only way we can preserve
our future is to preserve everyone's
future, not just our own.
It is fine to disagree with the philos
ophy or tactics of the BSU; it is wrong
to vote against the BSU because it has
always been misunderstood and mis
represented, like most organizations of
students of color which are outspoken.
You decrease your chances of being a
solution for the future every time you
react negatively to a novel idea, view
point or action.
If you're white and expect to be a
part of the BSU without helping,
understanding or even saying hello,
you are the radicals, not we. The black
community will continue to assert its
cultural autonomy, its right to exist
and its right to help other black people
escape the dismal conditions facing
most people of color.
Not all black people will be involved
and not all those involved will be
black, but we, as the black community,
will continue to struggle, loud and
proud, until this campus becomes an
institution which serves and respects
all peoples.

waves instead of damping waves, I
have seen the reactions of our "leaders
of the future" to change.
Sorry boys and girls, you all failed
miserably in the "Stanford Stress
Response Test," also known as the
BSU fee assessment vote.
You say "How did we fail? All we
were trying to do was teach you all a
lesson. You black people are always
griping and moaning, and we're not
going to pay you to gripe and moan.
Use someone else's money."
What the 51.1 percent of students
on campus who voted against the BSU
fee assessment were voting against
were community service programs,
dorm outreach programs, Jesse Jack
son and Yolanda King speeches, libra
ries for East Palo Alto kids and "chill
outs" in White Plaza.
All of the marches, rallies, yelling,
screaming, protesting and general
wavemaking cost between $75 and
$200, out of a total budget of $18,000.
The cost of one ASSU election would
fund 35 years of political agitation,
which is just a small portion of the
BSU agenda.
"How could we have been so ignor
ant to vote against community service
when all we wanted to stop was the
griping and moaning of a special inter
est group?"
Why, because the average Stanford
student, like the average U.S. citizen,
does not care enough to face reality
when he or she can be given a simple
explanation for a very complex problem
like racial prejudice. It seems easy for
a Stanford student or other privileged
member of society to sit and wait for
the problems to go away and collect
his ticket to the suburbs. Unfortunate-

ly, the problem is you.
Before I continue, I will take a
moment to help you overcome the
ignorance, which most students have,
of political terminology. The BSU has
had 20 years of training — most of
y'all haven't. Here are the definitions 1
use, just so you know from where I'm
coming:
Black — an African person or a mem
ber of the diaspora of African peoples
throughout the world.
Persons of Color — any of the non-
Caucasion peoples, including Africans,
Asians, Chicanos/Latinos, American
Indians or other ethnic groups. Com
monly called minorities, Third World
people or other inaccurate names.
Prejudice — to judge a person's attri
butes based on a set of preconceived
notions or stereotypes.
Discrimination — to treat an individ
ual or group differently and disadvan-
due to distinct arbitrary
characteristics.
Racist — one who actively oppresses
or mistreats a group of people based
on race.
Racism — to experience mistreatment
or oppression based on race.
Institutional racism — racism per
petuated by the passive and active
action of a social institution. Does not
require individual action to perpetuate,
but is experienced by individuals.
Progressive — a person committed to
active change of a social system to
favor those on the bottom levels of a
socio-economic system.
Conservative — a person committed to
conserving present social conditions,
which favor those in control of a
socio-economic system.
Activist — one who acts for change.
Reactionary — one who reacts to
change.
Protest — to actively disagree with a
policy or situation.
To be political — to use structured
social forums, institutions and organ
ized individuals to impact a social
group.
Passivity — the act of not responding
to stimuli, usually in order to preserve
a favorable situation or emotional
state.

You can argue with the BSU, but
you cannot accuse us of not under
standing exactly what we are doing.
People thought I was the only black
person yelling "racism and protest" on
campus, or worse, I was the head of a
monolithic body of black militants. The
fact of the matter is that there are at
least 700 people, of all races and back
grounds, yelling the same thing.
Unfortunately, the media like to
single out one leader, and they picked
me. The BSU, MEChA, Students
United for a Democratic Education,
Asian-American Students Association,
Stanford Organization for Lesbian and
Gay Equality and a few other organi
zations on this campus are actually
trying to change this campus.
My role in the activist student move
ment is a very minor part of the
massive student movement building
across the nation. I am a 140-pound
pre-med, for heaven's sake, so if a
nerd like me can bring fear into the
hearts of provosts just imagine what a
bunch of real, intimidating, committed
students of color could do.
The student movement is often lead
by black students, because we have
been exposed to the ostracism,
mistrust, misunderstanding and hatred
associated with trying to change soci
ety, merely by being black in a racist
society.
However, black students are only the
most organized, not the sole, group.
Women, Chicanos, Asians, ethnic mi
norities and progressive whites have
been involved in change; they just
don't get their pictures in the paper.
Unfortunately, for blacks, we only get
our pictures in the paper when we
protest or fail and not when we
succeed.
My response, and you may quote me,
is "Kiss my black behind!" In the
BSU, to be attacked is to be effective,
since most of the attackers are the
very people we are trying to change.
Anyone who actually knows me, has
seen that 1 am actually a very soft
spoken, polite, shy and studious young
man. However, this year I have been
seen as aggressive and militant because
I was the chair of the BSU.
Don't get me wrong. I am assertive,
loud and outspoken when I need to be,

but I wouldn't use those terms to
describe my personality. Now, all of
the middle-class white people reading
this, say "black man" and then the
first five adjectives that come into your
mind. I suffer from the same
stereotypes and caricatures forced upon
all blacks.
The fact of the matter is, that we,
like any other political organization,
use proposals, committees, petitions,
budgets, speeches, letters and meetings
in our work.
However, what most students and
Daily writers see are rallies, protests
and marches. Why? Because they are
blinded by this racist environment to
see blacks as aggressive.
This distorted view is institutional
racism at its best. No, we didn't cry
wolf, you all haven't experienced rac
ism and therefore don't know when it
does and doesn't exist.
I am about to say something which
will be misquoted and misunderstood
.. . ready ... I do not like most white
people. Now don't get excited if you're
white and a friend of mine or are
actively committed to helping people.
Most white students at Stanford
don't care or act on anything except
their own experience, and I don't like
people who don't care. To overcome
the effects of living in a racist, sexist,
exploitative society calls for active
people, not passive ignorant fools who
don't mind their own apathy.
If you are fuming mad at me, you
are probably one of those fools that
most students of color don't like or
even worse are a student of color who
is not planning on helping their own
people.
If you don't understand what I'm
talking about you probably also voted
against the BSU, SaLSA or Jesse
Jackson. We don't like you because
you have all the advantages in the
world and aren't trying to help or even
understand the plight most of the
world which is of color, is exploited
and is hungry.
How can you fight against hunger,
homelessness or apartheid if you can't
even walk into a black theme house? If
you can't handle a little discomfort for
being different, how can you handle
nuclear war?

There are a lot of problems for our
generation to solve and as Malcolm X
said, "If you're not a part of the solu
tion, you are a part of the problem."
Face it folks, we are in a messed-up
world where most of its inhabitants
don't like us and for good reason.
If you are a conservative or reaction
ary I hope you are in love with your
self because most of the world doesn't
like you. Why not? Because you are in
favor of "every man for himself,"
healthy competition and supply-side
economics while people are having
trouble eating and staying alive, due to
your Keynesian economics and "evil
empire" defense policies.
If you are insulted by my "attacks"
on "whites" and "people with other
views," you have missed my point
again. I am trying to stimulate you to
action, to involvement and to change
of the world for the better instead of
the preservation of your few advan
tages.
I hope we can all see that in this
world the only way we can preserve
our future is to preserve everyone's
future, not just our own.
It is fine to disagree with the philos
ophy or tactics of the BSU; it is wrong
to vote against the BSU because it has
always been misunderstood and mis
represented, like most organizations of
students of color which are outspoken.
You decrease your chances of being a
solution for the future every time you
react negatively to a novel idea, view
point or action.
If you're white and expect to be a
part of the BSU without helping,
understanding or even saying hello,
you are the radicals, not we. The black
community will continue to assert its
cultural autonomy, its right to exist
and its right to help other black people
escape the dismal conditions facing
most people of color.
Not all black people will be involved
and not all those involved will be
black, but we, as the black community,
will continue to struggle, loud and
proud, until this campus becomes an
institution which serves and respects
all peoples.

IT IS an unfortunate fact of life
that most students at Stanford are
white, middle class, privileged,
sheltered and apathetic. These attri
butes are usually considered advanta
geous in this world.
However, this student generation
must face the reality that the new
world is populated by dark, poor,
underprivileged, attacked and fervent
peoples who are quickly running out of
patience.

What the 51.1 percent of students
on campus who voted against the BSU
fee assessment were voting against
were community service programs,
dorm outreach programs, Jesse Jack
son and Yolanda King speeches, libra
ries for East Palo Alto kids and "chill
outs" in White Plaza.
All of the marches, rallies, yelling,
screaming, protesting and general
wavemaking cost between $75 and
$200, out of a total budget of $18,000.
The cost of one ASSU election would
fund 35 years of political agitation,
which is just a small portion of the
BSU agenda.
"How could we have been so ignor
ant to vote against community service
when all we wanted to stop was the
griping and moaning of a special inter
est group?"
Why, because the average Stanford
student, like the average U.S. citizen,
does not care enough to face reality
when he or she can be given a simple
explanation for a very complex problem
like racial prejudice. It seems easy for
a Stanford student or other privileged
member of society to sit and wait for
the problems to go away and collect
his ticket to the suburbs. Unfortunate-

ly, the problem is you.
Before I continue, I will take a
moment to help you overcome the
ignorance, which most students have,
of political terminology. The BSU has
had 20 years of training — most of
y'all haven't. Here are the definitions 1
use, just so you know from where I'm
coming:
Black — an African person or a mem
ber of the diaspora of African peoples
throughout the world.
Persons of Color — any of the non-
Caucasion peoples, including Africans,
Asians, Chicanos/Latinos, American
Indians or other ethnic groups. Com
monly called minorities, Third World
people or other inaccurate names.
Prejudice — to judge a person's attri
butes based on a set of preconceived
notions or stereotypes.
Discrimination — to treat an individ
ual or group differently and disadvan-
due to distinct arbitrary
characteristics.
Racist — one who actively oppresses
or mistreats a group of people based
on race.
Racism — to experience mistreatment
or oppression based on race.
Institutional racism — racism per
petuated by the passive and active
action of a social institution. Does not
require individual action to perpetuate,
but is experienced by individuals.
Progressive — a person committed to
active change of a social system to
favor those on the bottom levels of a
socio-economic system.
Conservative — a person committed to
conserving present social conditions,
which favor those in control of a
socio-economic system.
Activist — one who acts for change.
Reactionary — one who reacts to
change.
Protest — to actively disagree with a
policy or situation.
To be political — to use structured
social forums, institutions and organ
ized individuals to impact a social
group.
Passivity — the act of not responding
to stimuli, usually in order to preserve
a favorable situation or emotional
state.

You can argue with the BSU, but
you cannot accuse us of not under
standing exactly what we are doing.
People thought I was the only black
person yelling "racism and protest" on
campus, or worse, I was the head of a
monolithic body of black militants. The
fact of the matter is that there are at
least 700 people, of all races and back
grounds, yelling the same thing.
Unfortunately, the media like to
single out one leader, and they picked
me. The BSU, MEChA, Students
United for a Democratic Education,
Asian-American Students Association,
Stanford Organization for Lesbian and
Gay Equality and a few other organi
zations on this campus are actually
trying to change this campus.
My role in the activist student move
ment is a very minor part of the
massive student movement building
across the nation. I am a 140-pound
pre-med, for heaven's sake, so if a
nerd like me can bring fear into the
hearts of provosts just imagine what a
bunch of real, intimidating, committed
students of color could do.
The student movement is often lead
by black students, because we have
been exposed to the ostracism,
mistrust, misunderstanding and hatred
associated with trying to change soci
ety, merely by being black in a racist
society.
However, black students are only the
most organized, not the sole, group.
Women, Chicanos, Asians, ethnic mi
norities and progressive whites have
been involved in change; they just
don't get their pictures in the paper.
Unfortunately, for blacks, we only get
our pictures in the paper when we
protest or fail and not when we
succeed.
My response, and you may quote me,
is "Kiss my black behind!" In the
BSU, to be attacked is to be effective,
since most of the attackers are the
very people we are trying to change.
Anyone who actually knows me, has
seen that 1 am actually a very soft
spoken, polite, shy and studious young
man. However, this year I have been
seen as aggressive and militant because
I was the chair of the BSU.
Don't get me wrong. I am assertive,
loud and outspoken when I need to be,

but I wouldn't use those terms to
describe my personality. Now, all of
the middle-class white people reading
this, say "black man" and then the
first five adjectives that come into your
mind. I suffer from the same
stereotypes and caricatures forced upon
all blacks.
The fact of the matter is, that we,
like any other political organization,
use proposals, committees, petitions,
budgets, speeches, letters and meetings
in our work.
However, what most students and
Daily writers see are rallies, protests
and marches. Why? Because they are
blinded by this racist environment to
see blacks as aggressive.
This distorted view is institutional
racism at its best. No, we didn't cry
wolf, you all haven't experienced rac
ism and therefore don't know when it
does and doesn't exist.
I am about to say something which
will be misquoted and misunderstood
.. . ready ... I do not like most white
people. Now don't get excited if you're
white and a friend of mine or are
actively committed to helping people.
Most white students at Stanford
don't care or act on anything except
their own experience, and I don't like
people who don't care. To overcome
the effects of living in a racist, sexist,
exploitative society calls for active
people, not passive ignorant fools who
don't mind their own apathy.
If you are fuming mad at me, you
are probably one of those fools that
most students of color don't like or
even worse are a student of color who
is not planning on helping their own
people.
If you don't understand what I'm
talking about you probably also voted
against the BSU, SaLSA or Jesse
Jackson. We don't like you because
you have all the advantages in the
world and aren't trying to help or even
understand the plight most of the
world which is of color, is exploited
and is hungry.
How can you fight against hunger,
homelessness or apartheid if you can't
even walk into a black theme house? If
you can't handle a little discomfort for
being different, how can you handle
nuclear war?

There are a lot of problems for our
generation to solve and as Malcolm X
said, "If you're not a part of the solu
tion, you are a part of the problem."
Face it folks, we are in a messed-up
world where most of its inhabitants
don't like us and for good reason.
If you are a conservative or reaction
ary I hope you are in love with your
self because most of the world doesn't
like you. Why not? Because you are in
favor of "every man for himself,"
healthy competition and supply-side
economics while people are having
trouble eating and staying alive, due to
your Keynesian economics and "evil
empire" defense policies.
If you are insulted by my "attacks"
on "whites" and "people with other
views," you have missed my point
again. I am trying to stimulate you to
action, to involvement and to change
of the world for the better instead of
the preservation of your few advan
tages.
I hope we can all see that in this
world the only way we can preserve
our future is to preserve everyone's
future, not just our own.
It is fine to disagree with the philos
ophy or tactics of the BSU; it is wrong
to vote against the BSU because it has
always been misunderstood and mis
represented, like most organizations of
students of color which are outspoken.
You decrease your chances of being a
solution for the future every time you
react negatively to a novel idea, view
point or action.
If you're white and expect to be a
part of the BSU without helping,
understanding or even saying hello,
you are the radicals, not we. The black
community will continue to assert its
cultural autonomy, its right to exist
and its right to help other black people
escape the dismal conditions facing
most people of color.
Not all black people will be involved
and not all those involved will be
black, but we, as the black community,
will continue to struggle, loud and
proud, until this campus becomes an
institution which serves and respects
all peoples.
