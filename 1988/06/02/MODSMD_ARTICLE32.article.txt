Seen as a steely, outspoken leader of
the Black Student Union, a sidekick to
Jesse Jackson and an unwavering
crusader against the Western Culture
program, senior Amanda Kemp has
known poverty, alienation and opposi
tion.
And she knows how to fight.
Describing the neighborhood she grew
up in as "tough" and "poor," Kemp be
came a ward of New York City when she
was six and lived in a foster home in the
South Bronx. At 13 she moved to another
foster home in Manhattan.
Kemp said she learned how to cope by
reading "anything and everything I could
get my hands on," which she maintained
broadened her view of the world very
early on.

professional she had ever known.
"He made me proud of myself," Kemp
said. But she went on to admit that her
mentor's high hopes often left her
"feeling a lot of pressure" to succeed.
However, as a past BSU chair and as
a force behind the change in Western
Culture, succeed she has.
After a year of fighting the Western
Culture program and attacking institu
tional racism at Stanford, Kemp said the
battle "stretched" her "politically and
emotionally."
"It was a very difficult struggle to lead.
The depth to which people understood
what we were talking about was ex
tremely shallow, and the backlash against
the black community this year has been
difficult," she said.
But Kemp said she prides herself on
having cultivated an increased "solidarity
in the black community" at Stanford.

'Whatever I have gained I am going to use to
open up and expand the sector that now has all
the privileges.'

"Reading transports you, forms who
you are," she said.
Despite her love of reading, Kemp com
plained that she "went to a black school
with almost no exposure to black au
thors." She saw her early education as
foreshadowing the issues of the Western
Culture debate here.
For high school, Kemp earned a full
scholarship to a private boarding school
in New York. Recollecting her first day
there, Kemp said she had never been
around so many whites and "just wanted
to scream."
"I was overwhelmed with the sea of
women with blonde hair," she recalled.
But at the predominately white board
ing school Kemp said she found a mentor.
Empowering her with confidence that she
was "special," that she would "change
the world," the first black administrator
at the boarding school was the only black

Describing the BSU as a "catch-all
watchdog of injustice" that keeps tabs
on all aspects of the University, Kemp
said she is "very proud" of the student
group and has faith in its future.
Largely responsible for Jackson's visits
to Stanford this year and last, Kemp
showed dauntless determination coaxing
him to visit Stanford last January. After
several unsuccessful attempts to bring
him here through the standard channels,
she and several members of the BSU
launched a nationwide campaign to con
vince him to come, trailing him across
the country, pestering him.
Amanda herself drew a promise from
Jackson. At a fund-raising dinner for the
presidential candidate in San Francisco,
Kemp stood up and pledged a $5,000
honorarium if he would come to Stanford.
He agreed. Kemp and her "band of an

gels," as he once called them, kept Jack
son to his word.
Kemp spoke before both of Jackson's
speeches here. According to History Prof.
Clay Carson, after each of Jackson's ap
pearances, more people approached him
with praise for Kemp's speech than for
Jackson's.
Kemp's dynamism is evident in the
dorm as well. As an Ujamaa House res
ident asistant, Kemp "can take a lot of
crap with a great sense of humor," ac
cording to senior Brett Jarvis, a fellow
RA.
Freshman Nomi Martin, a freshman
in Ujamaa, praised Amanda for being
"very nurturing."
"Her loving, caring and concern ex
tends beyond color, spreads across all
people," Martin said.
Looking back at her four very visible
years at Stanford, Kemp said that as a
freshman she often felt "guilty about the
opportunities [she] had."
"At the same time I had close family
living much harder lives," she explained.
"I felt I was somehow leaving them be
hind."
But after four years here, Kemp said
she is "settled and resolved ... to help
break the vicious and deliberate cycle"
of inequality she said blacks face.
Kemp will graduate this June with a
double in Afro-American studies
and history. Although she has also
pursued theater and poetry at Stanford,
she said her "calling is politics." In 15
years, Kemp imagined herself settled in
the South working on public issues with
a national organization or as a state legis
lator.
This July she will venture down to
Atlanta, Ga., acting as a delegate for
Jackson at the Democratic convention.
Awarded the Gardener Public Service
Fellowship earlier this spring, Kemp is
currently exploring the possibility of
working with Jackson during the fellow
ship next year.
Although Kemp will soon leave a
campus she has shaken up for the past
four years, she said that her Stanford
experiences will influence her future
struggles.
"Whatever I have gained I am going
to use to open up and expand the sector
that now has all the privileges," she said.
