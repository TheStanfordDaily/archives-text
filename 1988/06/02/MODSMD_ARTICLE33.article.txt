# You've come a long, long way, Bug Me
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
Reader with the same format as
Bug Me. "The Straight Dope" is
a compilation of his best columns
over the years, and is simply fun
nier and racier than Bug Me.
Before I sign off for one last
time, there are a few people who
I would like to thank. First, I am
deeply indebted to Bruce Wiggins
of University Operations and
Maintenance for all his time and
help. Mr. Wiggins simply knows
everything about everything on
this campus and has been cheer
fully assisting The Daily Bugs for
years. Many, many thanks, Mr.
Wiggins.

On September 29, 1972, a new
feature made its debut in The
Daily. Sandwiched between an ad
vertisment for a Miles Davis con
cert (tickets were $3.50 at Tick
etron) and a review of a new tele
vision show called "Maude," it
was a column, written by Bob Lit
terman and The Daily's consumer
affairs department, devoted to
helping readers with serious ques
tions about campus life. That
column was called "Bug Me."
This column is called "Bug Me"
too, although it bears only a fleet
ing resemblance to the original
concept. Over the past 16 years
it has evolved from "When can
we sell back our books at the
Bookstore?" to "How big is a
whale's penis?"

I would also like to thank all
of my editors for putting up with
copy that often bordered on libel,
inappropriateness or just plain
grossness. They did an admirable
job editing out the stuff that
would get me into serious trouble,
while still leaving enough goodies
to send The Daily to new heights
of questionable taste.
Special thanks to everyone who
took the time to send in the ques
tions — more than 500 of 'em by
my count. Every single question
I answered this year was written
down and sent to me by a real
person; I did not make up any of
them.
But most of all I would like to
thank you, the reader. There are
writers out there who claim they
write out of love and not because
they want people to read their
stuff. They are lying through their
teeth. We write to be read, and I
appreciate your taking the time
to read this column. It really
means a lot to me.
So 31 columns, nine libraries,
eight obnoxious midnight phone
calls from drunk grad students,

And they say society isn't
making progress.
It's been a great privilege and
a hell of a lot of fun carrying on
the tradition of The Bug this year.
In fact, The Bug has become
something of a second persona for
me. I get introduced by my friends
at parties simply as "The Bug";
one reference librarian at Meyer
greets me with "Hey, Bug!"
whenever I visit that library; even
my girlfriend calls me "Bug,"
which, under the right circum
stances, is about the most roman
tic thing in the world.
If you have eryoyed Bug Me
this year, I strongly recommend
that you pick up a copy of "The
Straight Dope" by Cecil Adams
(available in paperback at slimier
bookstores everywhere). Adams
writes a column for the Chicago

five editors, three printer ribbons
and hundreds of phone calls later,
I bid a fond farewell to the best
job on campus. No longer will I
write this column, but I suppose
a part of me will always be The
Bug.
Now, for a behind the scenes
look at some of the things that
didn't quite make it into the
column, I am proud to present
here the 1987-88 Bug Me Awards.

tions? (Nope! None of 'em.)
• Who is your ex-girlfriend?
(You don't want to know.)
• How many bathrooms are
there on campus? (Why do people
keep asking this?)
Most Irate Reader: One reader
was so angered by the Jan. 12
column on amputations that he
sent The Bug a copy of the article
with those sentences underlined
that he found "particularly cal
lous." There were four sentences
that weren't underlined.
Most Incompetent Reader #1:
The student who keeps acciden
tally sending his complaints about
LOTS to The Bug instead of the
LOTS consultants.
Most Incompetent Reader #2:
Everyone who sent questions to
The Bug that were already an
swered the week before.
Most Incompetent Reader #3: All
LOTS geeks. Hey, if you can't
punctuate English sentences,
don't even try — it just ends up

being embarrassing.
Most Disappointed Administra
tor: At a Daily luncheon, Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to University
President Donald Kennedy, ex
pressed his disappointment with
this year's Bug Me. It seems that
there weren't enough useful ques
tions being answered, such as
ones about the origin of bollards.
Best Telephone Call Made: Pro
fessor Emeritus of Electrical En
gineering William Shockley, best
known for his views on race and
hereditary intelligence, hung up
on The Bug before he was even
asked whether he had ever
donated sperm to a Nobel prize
sperm bank.
Best Telephone Call Received:
Two (probably drunk) students
called The Bug at home, at mid
night, .to ask, "Has anyone ever

made love in the Quad at Noon
on Friday? How about the Oval?"
Best Unanswered Questions (I
am not making these up):
• What and where is my "groove
thing"? How do I shake it?
• How many orifices does a
woman have? I say that it is nine,
but some of my friends say that
it is 11.
• Why does getting kicked in
"the nuts" hurt so much? P.S.
Rephrase the question if you
want.
• Is it true that when you hold
a weenie over the campfire too
long it's skin will shrivel up and
it'll start screaming "beat the hot
lungs"?
° Where is the easiest place for
me to get a bong as a Christmas
present? Are there any head shops
in the area? I tried asking at Phi
Psi and Synergy, but they didn't

have the answer.
• When you were in junior high
did you ever hear the rumor about
Rod Stewart being rushed to the
hospital to have his stomach
pumped? Supposedly, they
retrieved copious quantities of a
mysterious, protein-rich sub
stance. My question is: Did this
really happen? Was it really
semen? And most importantly, ex
actly how much was there? I was
told one pint, my roommate
swears it was a quart, and our
friend next door says a gallon.
Oh yeah, how did it get there?
If by the usual method, does this
mean Rod is not necessarily
female-oriented in his sexual ap
petites?

For those who enjoy Andrew
Berkowitz's particular brand of
writing, he'll be back next fall in
The Daily with an all-new weekly
humor column.
