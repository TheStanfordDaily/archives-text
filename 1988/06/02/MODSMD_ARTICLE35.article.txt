## 'Great debate' over Area One highlights year 
### Frank Quaratiello Senior staff writer 
An exciting chapter in Stanford history
will close June 9 when the 20th Senate of
the Academic Council holds its final meet
ing.
This year's Faculty Senate has tackled
many tough issues in addition to the
routine business of setting University
policy.
The Western Culture "great debate" was
undoubtedly the high point of the senate's
year. The debate over the Area One cur
riculum attracted national media attention.
All eyes focused on the biweekly gathering
in Room 180 of the Law School as the
events unfolded.
The climax came March 31, when the
senate's 39-4 vote with 5 abstentions
marked the beginning of a new era at
Stanford and perhaps the beginning of a
new outlook toward education in America.
The senate has also focused on the prob
lems caused by the high overhead costs of
research, which endanger the University's
ability to gain federal research funds and
helped drive top Electrical Engineering
Prof. Ken Madey to announce his departure
to Duke last month. It has looked at the
shortcomings of the University's affirma
tive action hiring policy and discussed long
range plans for Stanford's growth and de
velopment.
The agenda for the senate's final meeting
is relatively small. The senate will discuss
Stanford's professoriate, consider a plan

The 20th Senate of the Aca
demic Council will probably
go out quietly, but its legacy
will linger.

from the Committee on Research to estab
lish five "minilabs" that will provide shared
facilities for professors and scientists from
outside corporations, and discuss next
year's dietribution requirement course
lists.
There will be no national news coverage.
The 20th Senate of the Academic Council
will probably go out quietly, but its legacy
will linger.
When the senate kicks in next fall after
a summer recess, Law Prof. John Kaplan
will take over for Senate Chair Gerald
Lieberman, professor of operations re
search. The chair is a revolving one-year
position.
Kaplan seems to have inherited the
timely wit that made Lieberman a succr.ss
ful wielder of the senate gavel.
Appraising next year's senate, Kaplan,
tongue-in-cheek, said, "They are an out
standing bunch of wonderful people acting
responsibly on behalf of the University and,
of course, the students."
Kaplan had little to say about his future
role as senate chair.
"I haven't received my secret orders from
Lieberman yet," Kaplan said.
