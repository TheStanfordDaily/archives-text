# 12th Congressional District primaries
## Prof, leads by a nose in the stretch 
### Tim Marklein Senior staff writer 
The crunch time is here for
the 12th Congressional District
races.
With only five days remaining
before the California primaries,
the race between Republican in
cumbent Ernie Konnyu and
Stanford Law Prof. Tom Camp
bell remains a dead heat, but
polls show Campbell pulling out
with a slight edge.
A May 24 poll conducted by
California pollster John
Shumate shows Campbell with
38 percent of the vote while Kon
nyu has dropped to 29 percent.
The tide has continuously
shifted Campbell's way since
Shumate's Feb. 15 poll showed
Konnyu with a lead of 41 percent
to Campbell's 30 percent. Camp
bell's campaign manager Karin
Miranda said "nothing has hap
pened to change that trajectory."
Konnyu declined to release his
latest poll results but said they
also show a very close race be

tween the two Republican can
didates.
Tuesday's Republican and
Democratic primaries, which
coincide with the presidential
primary, are the first hurdles of
a race that has been touted as
one of the hottest congressional
battles in the nation. Democratic
congressional leaders have tar
geted the seat as a possible "in"
for the party, which has not been
filled by a Democrat in over 20
years.
Five people are vying for the
Democratic congressional nomi
nation to determine who will
meet the Campbell-Konnyu win
ner. San Mateo County Super
visor Anna Eshoo and interna
tional business consultant Jim
Garrison are the front-running
Democrats.
Mountain View business con
sultant Gary Bond, Morgan Hill
attorney Ernest Macias and Hil
lsborough attorney Sylvia Sim
mons round out the field.
Although early reports showed
Campbell with a large monetary
lead over Konnyu, the incum

bent said positions have reversed
in the past weeks. As of May
18, the latest Federal Elections
Commission reporting date,
Konnyu said he had "twice as
much money in hand" as Camp
bell. While Konnyu had $62,814
cash on hand, Campbell reported
only $35,207.
However, Miranda said the
statistics are "deceptive" be
cause a lot of Campbell's cam
paign money was contributed
during fundraisers after the
filing deadline. Overall, reported
statistics show Campbell has
raised $460,232, compared to
Konnyu's $311,020.
Miranda spoke of a number
of signs favoring her candidate,
emphasizing that he has re
ceived "the endorsement of
every newspaper that has en
dorsed so far." She added that
Campbell has been endorsed by
a number of voter groups, in
cluding the California College
Republicans.
Miranda said the final week
will be important because "tradi
tionally a lot of people wait until

the end [to decide J." She said
the Campbell campaign will
"contact every identified Camp
bell supporter" to make sure
they vote. She added that the
expected low turnout will be an
other advantage, as there has
been a "very high level of inter
est in the Campbell campaign"
among voters.
Konnyu also emphasized the
importance of the final campaign
week, as there are "more people
undecided than decided for
either Campbell or myself." The
focus of Konnyu's final cam
paign push will be to refute "the
lies spread by Campbell about
me," adding that he hopes
"voters will make [Campbelll
pay for it."
Konnyu has been trailed by a
number of controversial state
ments he allegedly made during
his term, many of which Camp
bell has exploited to emphasize
the need to unseat Konnyu.
Konnyu yesterday said there was
"no harassment" of female em
ployees, as many people includ
ing Campbell have claimed.
