A May 23 headline stating
that freshman Kenny
Ehrman had been evicted
from Otero house for "ra
cial" slurs was inaccurate.
The University did not cite
racism as a reason for evict
ing Ehrman. Also, the ac
companying article incor
rectly stated that Ehrman
encouraged others to wear
a T-shirt printed with the
words "Aryan by the grace
of God." He never did so.
