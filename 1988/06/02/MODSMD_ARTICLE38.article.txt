## Forget finals — Card's going to Omaha 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
NEW BRITAIN,
Conn. — The
Stanford baseball
team on Tuesday
wrote a fittingly
odd ending to a
verv odd NCAA

n — vcij uuu nvnn
Northeast Regional.
It was a regional that featured,
among other things, a one-armed
umpire, a 19-inning game, a ball
park that seemed to laugh in the
faces of power hitters, a downpour
of practically Biblical proportions,
a quirky schedule that forced each
of the top three seeds to play two
games in a day and sprinklers
that came on without warning.
The regional also featured the
Cardinal, which, like the
sprinklers, came on without warn
ing, storming out of the loser's
bracket to beat Kentucky twice
— in a 6-5 spine-tingler on Mon
day and a 16-2 runaway on Tues
day — to earn a trip to the College
World Series.
Perhaps oddest of all, the Car
dinal was led by three of its most
unheralded players: junior second
baseman Frank Carey, junior first
baseman Ron Witmeyer and
freshman pitcher Stan Spencer.
Carey, who came into the
regional batting .282, went nuts
in the tournament, going 9-for-19
with 10 runs, five RBI and seven
stolen bases. In Tuesday's cham
pionship game, he got on base all
six times at bat, going 4-for-4 with
two walks and two doubles. Carey
was named the Most Valuable
Player of the Northeast Regional.
"He really kind of carried us,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
said of Carey. "He seemed to be
on base all the time, with a walk
or a base hit or whatever it took."

If Carey provided the spark,
then Witmeyer provided the
horsepower. He was 7-for-13 with
seven walks, five runs and eight
RBI in the regional. Most impres
sive of all, he had two key homers
— a two-run shot against
Fordham on Friday night and a
three-run rocket against Ken
tucky on Monday — in what is
decidedly a pitcher's park, with
massive power alleys and 15-foot
high fences. Witmeyer now has
11 home runs on the year.
Spencer, the Cardinal's No. 3
starter all year, turned in two out
standing outings, going six in
nings and allowing only one

earned run against Fordham on
Friday, and quieting the rowdy
Kentucky bats on Tuesday with
a complete-game seven-hitter.
Carey, Witmeyer and Spencer,
along with left-fielder Brian
Johnson (who was 8-for-16 with
3 RBI) all were named to the all
tournament team. Shortstop Troy
Paulsen probably should have
been, after going 8-for-13 with a
home run, a triple, two doubles
and eight RBI in the last three
games.
Now, the Cardinal heads to
Omaha for the fifth time in the
last seven years.
The Cardinal returns to
Rosenblatt Stadium with the nu
cleus of the team that won the
national title last year. It's a
seasoned, playoff-tested squad
that subsitutes power for the
speed it lacks.
One problem Stanford won't
have in the World Series is fear
of the unknown: Of the seven
other teams in the Series, Stan
ford played five — Miami, Arizona
State, California, Fresno State
and Fullerton State — during the
regular season. Wichita State and
Florida are the other two teams
in the Series.
The College World Series has
been reorganized into two four
team double-elimination brackets,
with the winners of the two brack
ets meeting in the championship
game June 11.
Stanford, seeded seventh, will
open play at 2:10 p.m. PDT Sat
urday against No. 2 seed Fresno
State. That and all subsequent
games will be broadcast live on
ESPN television and on KSZU,
90.1 FM.
Third seed Miami and sixth
seed Fullerton State are the other
two teams in Stanford's bracket.

The Cardinal played all three
of the teams in its bracket during
the regular season, losing two
games to each.
But Marquess said the previous
record isn't that important. "It's
a different setting, a different
field," he said. "One thing is that
we know what we're playing
against. But it will be difficult.
It's probably the strongest field
they've ever had at the World Se
ries."
Senior Lee Plemel probably will
start the opener for the Cardinal,
Marquess said.
That Stanford is going to
Omaha at all is something of a
surprise, given the teun's shaky
start in the regional.
The Cardinal seemed to be on
the express train to elimination
after dropping its opener 5-2 to
St. John's last Friday afternoon
and falling behind early, 3-0,
against Fordham later that night.
Stanford had to play twice Fri
day because its game against St.
John's, originally scheduled for
Thursday, was rescheduled after
Clemson and Fordham dueled for
19 innings — the longest playoff
game in NCAA Division I history
— in the opening game of the
regional.
So after falling flat against the
Redmen Friday afternoon, the
Cardinal had to come back and
face Fordham in an elimination
game that night. Stanford spotted
the Rams three runs early, but
came back behind Ron Witmeyer's

two-run homer in the third in
ning, eventually winning 6-5
when Witmeyer scored on a hair
raising suicide squeeze by Eric
DeGraw in the eighth inning.
Fordham outhit the Cardinal
13-8, but also made a whopping
four errors, which proved to be
the difference.
"I look at the scoreboard, and
I see our boys outhit them,"
Fordham Coach Dan Gallagher
said. "But then I look at the
column to the right of that, and
I see we made four errors, and
that was the deciding factor."
The narrow win gave Stanford
a bit of breathing room.
"There's no question about it
— that was a big turning point
for us," Marquess said. "You have
a game which you're going to lose
and then you bounce back .. .
from then on, we seemed to play
much more relaxed, much looser
and with a lot more confidence
— I don't think we did that the
first two games."
With Rutgers surprising Clem
son on Saturday, Stanford got the
day off, but came out on Sunday
and beat the Scarlet Knights 8-1
behind a superb complete-game
pitching performance by senior
Lee Plemel. He gave up six hits,
walked three and struck out five
in improving his record to 10-8.
That game was played Sunday
afternoon under overcast but non
threatening skies. Clemson and
Kentucky, playing in the Sunday
night game, began under a fair

sky. But a few batters into the
game, huge clouds rolled in, and
the rain came down hard.
It was almost a flash flood, and
because there is no tarp at
Beehive Field (rats ate holes in it
last year, according to local
folklore), the infield was several
inches deep in water within about
20 minutes.
The Kentucky-Clemson game
was completed Monday morning,
with Kentucky holding off a late
Clemson charge to win 8-7 and
eliminate the Tigers.
That left the Wildcats unbeaten
and in the driver's seat in the
tournament. The Cardinal would
have to beat Kentucky twice to
win the regional.
The teams played first on Mon
day afternoon. Stanford jumped
out to a 4-2 lead on Witmeyer's
three-run homer in the third in
ning, then held on behind an ex
cellent relief performance by
Steve Chitren. Frank Carey
delivered the game-winning hit —
a two-out single to left that scored
pinch-runner Jack Hollis to put
Stanford up 6-5.
Things were equally close for
most of the game on Tuesday,
with Stanford clinging to a 5-2
lead before exploding for five runs
in the eighth inning and six in
the ninth.
Up to that point, the two teams
had been like a pair of thorough
breds going neck-and-neck down

Sophomore Troy Paulsen shut down Kentucky in the final game
with both glove and bat. He drove in six runs in Wednesday's 16-2
rout.
