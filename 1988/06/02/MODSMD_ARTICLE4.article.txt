# Native American sites saved
## University to preserve archaeological digs on Stanford land 
### Pia Ali-Salaam Staff writer 
Citing the importance of
preserving Native American cul
ture, the University recently
decided to protect over 50 sites
where Native Americans lived
more than 5,000 years ago, ac
cording to a University official.
No buildings will be con
structed on top of the valuable
artifacts in the forseeable fu
ture, said Jean Barnes, a staff
assistant at the Office of Plan
ning and Management. This

policy is in response to a
recently-completed three-year
archaeological survey of Stan
ford's lands off campus.
The artifacts found at the
sites are "very important to
Stanford because they are
unique treasures" which offer
many research opportunities,
Barnes said.
Barbara Bocek, a campus ar
chaeologist for the Provost's of
fice and overseer of the sites,
said she was pleased with the
new policy and added that "the
University realized that tempo

rary preservation doesn't make
sense." â€¢
Stanford has known that sites
like these existed since the
1950s when Emeritus Anthro
pology Prof. Bert Gerow discov
ered one area on campus where
prehistoric Native Americans
lived.
In recent years, Stanford
decided to go ahead with a com
prehensive investigation of the
University lands and in 1985,
Bocek, then a graduate anthro
pology student, began to survey
and categorize the University's
known sites as well as discover
new ones.
Working with her former advis
er, Anthropology Prof. John Rick,
the 1986 Stanford doctoral grad
uate has so far found 53 sites,
the oldest of which is 5,130 years
old. The bulk of the sites they
have uncovered, however, are only
2,000 to 3,000 years old.
Though the sites are old, they
still offer new information about
the ancient communities that
lived there. Bocek theorizes that
the ancient communities physi
cally separated activities such as
cooking, done near the home, and
making stone tools, conducted at
the village perimeter, for safety
reasons.
This division ensured that the
sharp stone flakes, which would
be produced when making tools,

would not contaminate food or
cut their feet.
Not only have archaeologists ex
cavated artifacts relating to an
cient Native American life, but
they have discovered burial
grounds which preserved their
dead.
The importance of respecting
sacred burial grounds is foremost
among researchers concerns. Law
requires that when working with
prehistoric sites, researchers
must identify the most likely des
cendants of the ancient people so
that they can help decide whether
the cultural value of the site is
high enough to merit excavata
tion.
Stanford will not release the lo
cation of the sites for fear of ar
tifact thefts.
The modern descendants of the
prehistoric Native American com
munities who lived at the Stan
ford sites are the Ohlone Indians
who still live on the Peninsula
and in San Jose. The Ohlones

work closely with the site remains
and visit Stanford every year,
according to Bocek.
"It is important to produce in
formation that is important for
the Ohlones," said Bocek, "not
just my archaeological career."
Since 1980, Stanford students
have had the opportunity to help
excavate the Stanford sites under
the direction of Bocek and Rick
by taking Anthropology 91.
"The Stanford students are
good," according to Bocek. "They
learned quickly to identify" arti
facts in the class.
For electrical engineering grad
uate student Chris Fisher, though
the course is interesting because
"it's totally in the field," it is also
difficult because the process by
which artifacts are excavated "is
long and tedious."
And it will take a long time to
uncover all that the Stanford sites
have to offer. The site students
are currently excavating is 5 by
12 meters.
