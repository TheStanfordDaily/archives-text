# Spencer is a significant 'other'
## 
### Chris Myers Senior staff writer 
NEW BRITAIN, Conn. - All season
long, Stan Spencer has been"the other
freshman pitcher" on the Stanford baseball
team.
With pro scouts and the media buzzing
about fellow freshman Mike Mussina —
the top high school recruit in the nation
last year — Spencer doesn't get too much
attention. And that's just fine by him.
"A lot of times during the season, I think
people would overlook me," Spencer said.
"They'd say, 'Plemel's really good' and
'Mussina's really good,' and they wouldn't
really expect much from me."
But with the Cardinal heading for the
College World Series beginning Saturday,
Spencer may have blown his cover.
The right-hander from Vancouver,
Wash., turned in two fine performances in
the Northeast Regional, including a
complete-game seven-hitter — arguably his
finest outing of the year — against hard
hitting Kentucky in the championship
game, earning himself a spot on the all
tournament team.
The win over Kentucky, which raises his
record to 6-2, was standard-issue Spencer:
trim, workmanlike, unspectacular. He
threw a lot of strikes, kept hitters off
balance with a mix of fastballs, changeups
and breaking balls, and didn't make any
big mistakes.
"Stan has probably been our hardest
working pitcher all year, and in the biggest
game of the season, he pitches just a gem,"
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess said,
Of the 108 pitches Spencer threw, only
31 were balls. He issued only one walk
and struck out three.
Most importantly, Spencer was throwing
pitcher's pitches.
"He was keeping the ball away and down
and hitting the corners consistently," Ken
tucky shortstop Billy White said. "I don't
think I saw more than two or three good
pitches to hit in my four times at bat."

Stan has probably been
our hardest-working
pitcher all year, and in
the biggest game of the
season, he pitches just
a gem.'

That's crucial to Spencer's strategy. "I'm
not a real strikeout pitcher. My game plan
is to work the corners," he said after the
Kentucky game. "Spot the fastball and keep
them off balance with off-speed stuff. . . .
Today, whenever I missed a spot, it seemed
like I'd miss in a good spot — like I'd be
trying to go low and outside and I'd miss
high and inside."
So Spencer may not have the flashy
radar-gun readings of fire-balling team
mate Mussina, but oftentimes he is just
as effective.
And as roommates on road trips. Spencer
and Mussina have been able to share the
experience of being highly touted new
comers on one of the nation's best collegiate
teams. "We get along great," Spencer said
of Mugsina. "It's great to have someone
to talk to who understands where you're
coming from."
Spencer said he decided in his sophomore
year of high school that he wanted to go
to Stanford. Still, he was recruited bv
several other schools, including baseball
powerhouses Oklahoma State and Florida.
He chose to go to Stanford because of
the "balance between academics and ath
letics," he said. M I thought that if I went
to a place like Oklahoma State, I'd be a
piece of meat — just there to play baseball."
