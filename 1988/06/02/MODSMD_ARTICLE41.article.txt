# Consistent Figley shines at NCAAs

Things are looking up for the future
of women's golf at Stanford.
, Freshman Jodi Figley's 13th-place
finish at last week's NCAA Champi
onships has put a lot of spark into
the hopes for a strong future for the
J women's golf program on the Farm.

Figley played a very consistent tournament at
the New Mexico State University Golf Course in
Las Cruces, New Mexico, shooting 74-74-73-74 over
the four-day event. She hit 65 greens in regulation
of the 72 holes she played.
"Jodi played solid golf," Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin said. "She beat an awful lot of excellent
players."
Overall, 102 players competed, with 29 of them
from foreign counties. Most of these foreign entries,
according to Baldwin, are those nation's respective
national amateur champions. "The field here is
much stronger than at the U.S. Amateur," he said.
While Figley's first three rounds were very similar
in that she hit at least 16 greens in regulation each
day, she found the going a little tougher in the
final round, turning the front nine two over par
and having to scramble for pars.
She rebounded with a birdie on the 15th hole,
but made a "stupid" bogey on 16, putting her back
to two over par with two holes to play. "I said to
myself, 'I don't care what it takes, I'm going to
birdie the last two holes,' " she said.
Indeed she did, sinking a downhill 25-foot putt
in front of a substantial gallery on the final hole
of what has been a sensational season for her.
But the end of this year's college season doesn't
mean a halt to Figley's playing golf. As she has
done in the past, Figley plans to play tournaments
throughout the summer. However, she will no
longer be playing the junior circuit, but rather will
join the amateur circuit immediately after final
exams.
Senior Kay Cornelius had a bit more difficulty
negotiating the 6,100-yard mountain layout. Despite
what Baldwin called "a beautiful round of golf' on
the third round, Cornelius shot 78-77-70-75 to tie
for 32nd.
Baldwin termed her performance "solid, just as

she has been over her entire col
legiate career."
Cornelius plans to join former
Stanford teammate Adrienne Gil
martin next month on the "mini
tour" before attending the Ladies

Professional Golf Association
qualifying school next fall.
The NCAA individual champi
onship was left up for grabs on
the final round as Oklahoma
State's Eva Dahloff, who had led
from the beginning of the tour
nament, ballooned to a final
round 78 and finished 12th, one
stroke ahead of Figley.

Melissa McNamara of Tulsa,
who also led her team to the na
tional title, emerged from the
pack with a four-under-par 70 on
the final round to capture a two
stroke victory over Duke's Jean
Bartholomew. Bartholomew's
final-round 69 gave her a 289
total, edging teammate Evelyn
Or ley by one stroke.
