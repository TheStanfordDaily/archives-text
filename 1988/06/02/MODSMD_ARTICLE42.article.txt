pions, 1988
Olympians and
several other
strong candi
dates for NCAA

All-America honors will lead
Stanford's contingent at the
NCAA Track and Field Cham
pionships this week at Oregon.
The best bet for a national
title will be junior javelin
thrower Erica Wheeler, whose
throw of 192 feet, 2 inches May
20th at the Pac-10 Conference
Championship meet set a na
tional high for the year.
Wheeler, an All-American last
year along with classmate
Patty Purpur, will throw in the
qualifying rounds this after
noon, with the final slated for
Saturday.
"She will definitely be the
favorite," according to Stan
ford Asst. Coach Scott Chisam.
Stanford Coach Brooks
Johnson has made the NCAA
meet one of his main priorities
throughout the season. "Our
big meets are the Cal dual
meet, the Pac-10 Champion
ships and the NCAA Champi
onships," Johnson said.
Another strong bet will be
Canadian Marc Olesen in the
1,500-meter run. Olesen, the
Stanford school record holder,
will be running his last race in
the Cardinal and white and

hopes to bounce back from a
disappointing sixth-place finish
at the Pac-10 meet.
Olesen would also like a shot
at the 3:37.96 Canadian Olym
pic qualifying time for a berth
at Seoul.
The high jump is an uncer
tain event, even with Stanford
seniors Lisa Bernhagen and
Brian Marshall representing
the Cardinal this year. Bern
hagen injured her foot before
the NCAA outdoor meet in
1987 after setting an indoor
collegiate record of 6-5 Vi and
has been working to regain her
form and confidence. "I'd love
to get a good meet in before
the (Olympic) trials," Bern
hagen said.
Marshall came through at
Pac-lOs to win the men's high
jump at 7-5%. Marshall, an
other Canadian resident, has
made his country's Olympic
team and set a new school
record as well. The men's final
will be Saturday, while the
women finish Friday.
The other Stanford men
competing will be senior Dave
Pickett and junior Glenn
Schneider throwing the javelin
and discus, respectively, and
freshman Dave Strang in the
800 meters. The women will
be represented by sophomore
Carol Gray, a 1986 cross
country All-American, in the
women's 10,000 meters and
two-time All-American Patty
Purpur in the shot put and
discus.
