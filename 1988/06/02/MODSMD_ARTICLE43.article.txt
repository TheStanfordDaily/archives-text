# Intensity in Athens
## 
### 
Intensity characterized the Stanford men's
tennis team's hunt for another NCAA Cham
pionship victory in Athens, Ga. â€” intensity
of crowd support, emotions, effort, coaching,
play and jubilation.
From the "woofing" calls of the crowd (top
right), the fire of freshman David Wheaton
and sophomore Eric Peus (right), the talent
of senior Patrick McEnroe (bottom right), the
determination of sophomore Jeff Tarango
(bottom center), the urging of Stanford Coach
Dick Gould (bottom left), the acrobatics of
Wheaton (left) to the victory celebration on
Lindsey Hopkins Indoor Courts (top left),
the Cardinal's unyielding desire brought it
its ninth NCAA Championship in 17 years
May 24.
After it was all over, freshman Martin Black
man (above, center) felt so cool, he had to
wear shades.
