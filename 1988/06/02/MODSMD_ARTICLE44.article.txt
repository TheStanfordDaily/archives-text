# How sweet it is... Farm memories

After hundreds and hundreds of
hours of watching Stanford sports
over the past four years, the memories
flash strongest as specific fleeting mo
ments, so get comfortable for a corny
sentimental stroll.

Three moments stand above the
rest for me, for three different
reasons, I think. They say the first
one is always the best, so that must
be why I can't shake the feeling of
standing on the University of San
Francisco soccer field trying to inter
view Cardinal star Giancarlo Feruzzi.
As a clueless sophomore reporter,
I didn't know what I was doing, but
I knew that Feruzzi had just teamed
with Angel Vasquez to score the win
ning goal in overtime over the tradi
tionally powerful Dons. But Feruzzi
just answered every question the
same, saying "How sweet it is!" over
and over again until I started laughing
and gave up.

A year and a half later, a less clue
less reporter sat at a Roble Hall picnic
table eating dinner and listening to a
walkman as the Stanford baseball
team faced elimination in the 10th
inning against Louisiana State at the
College World series. The Cardinal
trailed by three runs and my buddies
chuckled at my insistence on listening
to the last three outs.
So I sat quietly as Stanford loaded
the bases and then Paul Carey lofted
a ball to left field. I stood straight up
and when KZSU's Susan Slusser fi
nally said "grand slam" I went
bonkers, yelling "grand slam, grand
slam, Stanford won, Stanford won,"
and spouting bits of hamburger as no
one in the courtyard believed me but
I didn't care. It ain't over 'til it's over,
thanks to Paul.
Then, of course, there is the view
from the Maples Pavilion press box
on Thursday, February 4, 1988. Stan
ford's Todd Lichti lets the ball roll
away as the crowd chants, "Two,
0ne..." and then the masses melt
onto the floor in a madcap celebration.
Stanford 82, Arizona 74, and the Car
dinal is No. 1 for a day.
Lichti jumps into Howard Wright's
arms like Yogi Berra into Don Lar
sen's before they get bowled over by
the throng of students, who pour out
of the bleachers with abardon. Fellow

reporter Erik Sten and I try to keep
our decorum in the supposedly unbi
ased press box, and continue to marvel
at the crowd, which had rocked all
night, and would continue to rock
throughout the next three home
games. Stanford fans discovered that
it's hilariously fun to holler your lungs
out, and visitors had better beware
next season.
There are other moments that
didn't get reported but made up much
of the fun of covering Stanford sports.
I remember Athletic Director Andy
Geiger pacing in a circle behind the
statue of Hank Luisetti at Maples as
Stanford lost a heartbreaker to Santa
Clara. And then later Geiger wearing
a walkman listening to the Cardinal
vs. USC baseball game while he
watches Stanford host Oregon State.
Mr. Geiger is at the helm of an in
comparable college athletic program,
and he's a heckuva fan too.
Two years ago, when it was obvious
that Dr. Tom Davis, former Stanford
basketball coach, was going to leave
for greener (green paper, that is) pas
tures, Daily sports editor Tom Senf
wrote a convincing April Fool's Day
story about how Bobby Knight wanted
the Stanford job badly. It made a lot
of sense — burned-out coach wishes

country club refuge — but when
Davis delayed his decision until
after April 1, The Daily couldn't
run the story.
That same spring, then
sophomore Patrick McEnroe
snuck in between four senior All-
Americas and just went out and
won repeatedly in the number
three singles spot. In one match
at the varsity courts against
UCLA's Tim Trigueiro, McEnroe
acknowledged an umpire's scoring
mistake and gave a game to
Trigueiro out of sheer sportsman
ship. And then Patrick dusted
him.
Later, at the NCAA Champion
ships in Georgia, McEnroe faced
Trigueiro again and in one game
Mac won despite the fact the
Trigueiro served three straight
aces. Finally, with McEnroe as
team captain this year, the Car
dinal men's team won yet another
national title.
I regret that I never went to a
Stanford swim meet. But I was
fortunate enough to sit next to
Pablo Morales my sophomore year
here at The Daily as we worked
on our respective stories. Morales
covered women's basketball, and
I substituted for him for one
game. The day after the game he

called to thank me for covering
for him and he gave me pointers
on the story I had written. There
is a list of Pablo's athletic and
community service achievements
a mile long, but what I'll remem
ber is the courtesy of that phone
call.
Ooooh, some things still make
me mad. Like why Coach Steve
Axeman was whisked right out
from under Jack Elway's nose to
become the UCLA offensive coor
dinator, when in my opinion El
way could use an offensive coor
dinator himself.
It's too bad that funding was
cut for wrestling, fencing, field
hockey and softball. And why isn't
there a 24-hour field house on
campus, where we could play
some 3 a.m. pick-up hoops? Don't
worry, it's in the works.
Losing the axe in 1986 was not
a good thing. But three out of
four isn't bad.
A few of the most exciting mo
ments happened at Sunken Dia
mond. In the 1985 West Regional
cornerback-left fielder Walt Har
ris plowed down a Nebraska
catcher in the bottom of the ninth
for the winning Cardinal run, and
Stanford later went to Omaha.
Thanks to that Omaha-bound
Cardinal baseball team, our
careers as Stanford student fans
aren't over yet. I'll see you Friday
at some establishment that has
ESPN and refreshments.
After hundreds and hundreds of
hours of watching Stanford sports
over the past four years, the memories
flash strongest as specific fleeting mo
ments, so get comfortable for a corny

trailed by three runs and my buddies
chuckled at my insistence on listening
to the last three outs.
So I sat quietly as Stanford loaded
the bases and then Paul Carey lofted
a ball to left field. I stood straight up
and when KZSU's Susan Slusser fi
nally said "grand slam" I went
bonkers, yelling "grand slam, grand
slam, Stanford won, Stanford won,"
and spouting bits of hamburger as no
one in the courtyard believed me but
I didn't care. It ain't over 'til it's over,
thanks to Paul.
Then, of course, there is the view
from the Maples Pavilion press box
on Thursday, February 4, 1988. Stan
ford's Todd Lichti lets the ball roll
away as the crowd chants, "Two,
0ne..." and then the masses melt
onto the floor in a madcap celebration.
Stanford 82, Arizona 74, and the Car
dinal is No. 1 for a day.
Lichti jumps into Howard Wright's
arms like Yogi Berra into Don Lar
sen's before they get bowled over by
the throng of students, who pour out
of the bleachers with abardon. Fellow

reporter Erik Sten and I try to keep
our decorum in the supposedly unbi
ased press box, and continue to marvel
at the crowd, which had rocked all
night, and would continue to rock
throughout the next three home
games. Stanford fans discovered that
it's hilariously fun to holler your lungs
out, and visitors had better beware
next season.
There are other moments that
didn't get reported but made up much
of the fun of covering Stanford sports.
I remember Athletic Director Andy
Geiger pacing in a circle behind the
statue of Hank Luisetti at Maples as
Stanford lost a heartbreaker to Santa
Clara. And then later Geiger wearing
a walkman listening to the Cardinal
vs. USC baseball game while he
watches Stanford host Oregon State.
Mr. Geiger is at the helm of an in
comparable college athletic program,
and he's a heckuva fan too.
Two years ago, when it was obvious
that Dr. Tom Davis, former Stanford
basketball coach, was going to leave
for greener (green paper, that is) pas
tures, Daily sports editor Tom Senf
wrote a convincing April Fool's Day
story about how Bobby Knight wanted
the Stanford job badly. It made a lot
of sense — burned-out coach wishes

country club refuge — but when
Davis delayed his decision until
after April 1, The Daily couldn't
run the story.
That same spring, then
sophomore Patrick McEnroe
snuck in between four senior All-
Americas and just went out and
won repeatedly in the number
three singles spot. In one match
at the varsity courts against
UCLA's Tim Trigueiro, McEnroe
acknowledged an umpire's scoring
mistake and gave a game to
Trigueiro out of sheer sportsman
ship. And then Patrick dusted
him.
Later, at the NCAA Champion
ships in Georgia, McEnroe faced
Trigueiro again and in one game
Mac won despite the fact the
Trigueiro served three straight
aces. Finally, with McEnroe as
team captain this year, the Car
dinal men's team won yet another
national title.
I regret that I never went to a
Stanford swim meet. But I was
fortunate enough to sit next to
Pablo Morales my sophomore year
here at The Daily as we worked
on our respective stories. Morales
covered women's basketball, and
I substituted for him for one
game. The day after the game he

called to thank me for covering
for him and he gave me pointers
on the story I had written. There
is a list of Pablo's athletic and
community service achievements
a mile long, but what I'll remem
ber is the courtesy of that phone
call.
Ooooh, some things still make
me mad. Like why Coach Steve
Axeman was whisked right out
from under Jack Elway's nose to
become the UCLA offensive coor
dinator, when in my opinion El
way could use an offensive coor
dinator himself.
It's too bad that funding was
cut for wrestling, fencing, field
hockey and softball. And why isn't
there a 24-hour field house on
campus, where we could play
some 3 a.m. pick-up hoops? Don't
worry, it's in the works.
Losing the axe in 1986 was not
a good thing. But three out of
four isn't bad.
A few of the most exciting mo
ments happened at Sunken Dia
mond. In the 1985 West Regional
cornerback-left fielder Walt Har
ris plowed down a Nebraska
catcher in the bottom of the ninth
for the winning Cardinal run, and
Stanford later went to Omaha.
Thanks to that Omaha-bound
Cardinal baseball team, our
careers as Stanford student fans
aren't over yet. I'll see you Friday
at some establishment that has
ESPN and refreshments.
After hundreds and hundreds of
hours of watching Stanford sports
over the past four years, the memories
flash strongest as specific fleeting mo
ments, so get comfortable for a corny
sentimental stroll.

Three moments stand above the
rest for me, for three different
reasons, I think. They say the first
one is always the best, so that must
be why I can't shake the feeling of
standing on the University of San
Francisco soccer field trying to inter
view Cardinal star Giancarlo Feruzzi.
As a clueless sophomore reporter,
I didn't know what I was doing, but
I knew that Feruzzi had just teamed
with Angel Vasquez to score the win
ning goal in overtime over the tradi
tionally powerful Dons. But Feruzzi
just answered every question the
same, saying "How sweet it is!" over
and over again until I started laughing
and gave up.

A year and a half later, a less clue
less reporter sat at a Roble Hall picnic
table eating dinner and listening to a
walkman as the Stanford baseball
team faced elimination in the 10th
inning against Louisiana State at the
College World series. The Cardinal
trailed by three runs and my buddies
chuckled at my insistence on listening
to the last three outs.
So I sat quietly as Stanford loaded
the bases and then Paul Carey lofted
a ball to left field. I stood straight up
and when KZSU's Susan Slusser fi
