# Sailors host nationals

During the next seven days,
on the windswept waters of
San Francisco Bay, this
year's 18 best college sailing
teams will battle through
two regattas at Richmond
in an effort to capture the

silver at the 1988 Sperry Topsider/ICYRA
National Collegiate Sailing Championships.
Serving both as the regatta's host and
as one of the Pacific Coast's two represen
tatives at the regatta, the Stanford sailing
team faces a particularly difficult challenge
in the coming week. For each of the team's
sailors, the question of the day will be how
they can host an unforgettable regatta, win
all of its races and still earn passing grades
on their final exams.
The championships will match the best
dinghy racing teams and the best team
racing teams against each other in two
regattas that will determine this year's
champions. The two regattas are conducted
under different formats, with dinghy racing
pitting all of the teams together at once
in one large fleet, and team racing matching
schools one-on-one in a series of dual races.
Since qualifying for both parts of the
regatta at the Pacific Coast Championships
four weeks ago, the Cardinal squad has
been practicing intensely for what will be
many of the sailors' last collegiate regatta.

It's no secret we're out to
win this regatta. It will be
tough just to finish in the
top five, but after sailing as
a team for four years, we're
doing it for each other, and
that makes us even more
motivated.'

and junior Rita Snape, seniors Dan Buck
staff and Kathleen Mallery, and senior
Drew Gashler and freshman Kevin Hagan
stand in a good position to join what will
inevitably be an intense battle for the top
five spots.
"It's no secret we're out to win this
regatta," Buckstaff said. "It will be tough
just to finish in the top five, but after
sailing as a team for four years, we're
doing it for each other, and that makes us
even more motivated." The dinghy racing
championship will be held from today
through Saturday, and the team racing
event will run from Sunday to Tuesday.
If all goes perfectly well, the Cardinal
sailors will be able to return to Stanford
with their trophies just in time for their
last finals next Wednesday.
