"Rambo III," to put it quite
simply, is a triumph.
Sylvester Stallone has fash
ioned a suprisingly intelligent
screenplay that astutely or
chestrates a variation on the
Faustian theme with Kierkegaar
dian overtones. What this all boils
down to is a genuinely profound
story with none of the grandeur
and firepower of the first two
movies.
As Rambo, Stallone displays a
remarkable range of depth never
seen before. He has cut down on
the action scenes in order to fur
ther develop the enigmatic char
acter of Rambo, and he turns in
what is truly a moving perform
ance.
His Rambo character is no
longer a man of few unintelligible
words, but a complex, intelligent
and articulate individual who, for
the first time, shows that he is
capable of genuine warmth,
humor and affection.
All right, cut! No, pre-final
angst hasn't driven me silly, but
just what did you expect me to
say about a Rambo movie? The
point is that trying to review a
Rambo movie is like trying to stop
the world from spinning on its
axis.
In other words, it's a fruitless
task because the fact that the
earth will spin is as sure-fire a
bet as a Rambo movie. No matter
what you say or do, millions of
people will see the movie and it
will make millions and millions
of dollars, and current box office
receipts show that it is doing just
that.
This will be a relief to the pro
ducers, especially since the movie
allegedly cost $63 million,
catapulting it to the ranks of just
about the most expensive movie
ever made. Most of the money

went toward Stallone's Olympian
salary, and the rest went toward
blowing up helicopters and engi
neering all sorts of action stunts.
As far as action-adventure
movies go, "Rambo III" is pretty
decent. Granted, you have to be
in the right kind of mood to see
a movie like this, but once you
do see it, you won't be disap
pointed. It's basically a live-action
cartoon.
In his latest adventure, Rambo
goes to Afganistan to rescue Col.
Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna),
because Trautman was the only
person who was ever nice to him.
Rambo fights his way through the
evil Red Army and, well, you can
probably guess the rest.
Rambo has never been one to
mines words and neither does the

movie. The flick dispenses with
anything that might weigh it
down, like a plausible plot and
character development, and just
concentrates on action, which it
does very well.
This film won't win any major
awards, but to Stallone's credit,
he seems to know what the au
dience wants. He operates his
movies at a gut level and is able
to get the audience cheering by
knowing which buttons to push.
I, personally, have never liked
this sort of manipulative filmmak
ing, but it leaves the audience
feeling satisfied to see that Rambo
has overcome the "odds" to wipe
out half the Russian army regard
less of the fact that everyone
knows full well the outcome
before thev even walk into the

theater.
The phenomenon of Rambo's
popularity is basically similar to
the appeal of comedian Sam Kin
ninson. Kinnison screams out his
jokes in such away that it serves
as a catharsis for us to release
our own hostilities, frustrations
and aggression about politics, re
ligion or sex.
In tandem, Rambo uses
firepower and primal belligerence
in such away that it helps us
release our latent aggressive
feelings about Vietnam in partic
ular as in "Rambo II" or about
life in general as in the current
film.
Or something like that. One can
also say that Rambo movies are
so popular because, like it or riot,
they're entertaining.
