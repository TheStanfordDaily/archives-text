Sade — "Stronger than Pride"

My roommate and I were ar
guing about Sade's new album
the other day.
"I can't believe you still lis
ten to this mind-numbing
stuff," he said. "But I guess
anyone who thought 'Promise'
was the best album of 1985
would fall for anything."
"Come on, this ain't that
bad," I said. "Sure, it's Quiet
Storm in a msyor way, but it's
really high-potency stuff. It's
like getting coca leaves straight
from Medellin. Anyway, I defy
you to name one good album
that was released in 1985."
"This is crap, man! She can't
sing her way out of a paper
bag! At least this time she
doesn't try to go for all those
high notes she tried on the last
album. She clearly had visions
of grandeur. Nina Simone.
Billie Holiday. No way."
"Gotta admit, her musicians
are tight as hell this time. They
got those bass lines going like

something out of George Clin
ton goes to Beach Blanket
Babylon."
"Yeah, but this is still KBLX
stuff. They're pretentious as
Dukakis thinking they can grab
some of the Bird's sunshine
and take it to its limit. They're
strictly amateurs."
"I disagree. If you'd really
listened to 'Siempre Hay
Esperanza' and 'Paradise' in
stead of staring off into space,
you'd realize that the constipa
tion from the last two albums
is gone, all the fey calypso
songbird pretensions are out
the window, and the band's
just loose and having a good
time. They've been off the
charts so long now they don't
have anything to prove."
"What you say may very well
be, my friend, but they've been
gone too long to contend with
all the straight-ahead, hard
line crap on the airwaves now.
I haven't heard anything from
this album on any station but
Quiet Storm."
"Yeah, and that's too bad.
'Promise' went to the top, and
it sucks compared to this one.
Just goes to show you."
