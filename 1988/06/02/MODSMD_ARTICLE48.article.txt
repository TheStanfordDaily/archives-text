Mia's Dead Week Hang-Out:
When you've just got to get away from the
books (or you need some motivation to open
them) do what I do and head to Cool Licks
in downtown Palo Alto. For a good selection
of frozen yogurt and an even better choice of
tempting toppings, this "institution" of a yo
gurt shop can't be beat. Trust me.
A Flickering Farewell:
It just doesn't matter how many times
you've seen it or that you're only a freshman.
No excuses will be accepted for not going to
see "The Graduate" — this season's last flick.
Summer Diversions:
Only a few finals separate us from the free
dom of summer. Yes, summer is in the air
(figuratively, if not literally, these days).
Whether you're heading to Europe, taking the
LSAT, entering the real world or planning to
spend your summer playing your guitar by
Lake Lag (like someone I know), facts are facts.
Another school year is coming to a close.
Good luck with finals and have a fantastic
summer. See you in September.
