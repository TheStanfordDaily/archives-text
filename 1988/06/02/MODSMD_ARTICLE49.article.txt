# Album Review
## Marillion causes sensory overload with great music 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Marillion — "B'sides Themselves"

Marillion may very well be the most
overlooked band of the decade. Enjoy
ing a momentary gasp of fame in 1985
with the British top-10 song
"Kayleigh" (off of their equally suc
cessful "Misplaced Childhood" album),
the group has for some mysterious
reason remained virtually unknown to
the masses.
It is not surprising, then, that their
best release is only available on an
import CD. (Translated into regular
English, this means "it is extremely
hard to find, and once you do you'll
have to hock the wife and kids, get a
second mortgage and stop eating for
a week to aftord it." Well, maybe it's
not all that bad, but the disk will still
cost more than one precious penny
once you find one.)
In spite of all this, "B'sides Them
selves" is well worth the lengthy quest,
as it contains nine tracks of the finest
stuff ever put on a single compilation.
Quite simply, the disk is awesome.
For the many who missed the band's
illusory bit of fame, Marillion's music
sounds like a mix of Pink Floyd and
Led Zepplin and draws heavily from
Genesis' older material, like the classic
song "Supper's Ready" that makes the
album "Foxtrot" one of rock's
masterpieces. Lead singer/songwriter
Fish (yes, that's right, the man calls
himself Fish) consistently pens bril
liant lyrics and melody lines that give

style and structure to the oft
independent guitar and keyboard lines.
All of these elements come to a head
in Marillion's masterpiece "Grendel,"
the opening track to "B'sides" that
retells the Old English epic "Beowulf
from the perspective of Grendel.
The result is 17 minutes of densely
textured music and lyrics that are
sometimes serene, sometimes graphi
cally violent — but always intriguing.
After the first couple listenings you
are not really sure exactly what's going
on, since the production causes inten
tional sensory overload, but it is easy
to see that this song is something spe
cial. Besides, where else can you get
musical pleasure and a literature les
son at the same time?
"Charting the Single" provides some
relaxation after the tempestuous
"Grendel." Fish and the boys make
no attempt to shock anyone here, but
merely perform a mellow yet happy
tune. The repeated line "Home is
where the heart lies, but if the heart
lies where is home is where the heart
lies ... but where is home?" is a great
mental tounge twister, but the song
never gets very deep.
At least until "Market Square
Heroes," that is. Few songs exude the
power and fierceness of Fish's
portrayal of a politician. The opening
stanza starts with a bang, and the
music only gets stronger form there.
He goes more than just a little over
board near the end.
Fish keeps up the heat into the next
cut. A friend and Marillion fan tells
me that "Three Boats Down From the

Candy" describes a routine trip to his
cocaine dealer. Let's leave it at that.
"Cinderella Search" pulls the lis
tener out of the fire and eases into
some beautiful, thought-provoking
music. Dipping into his bag of favorite
folklore and finding the Cinderella
story, Fish creates a song about his
quest for the perfect mate mirrored
by the tale's prince:
Maybe it was infatuation or the thrill
of the chase
Maybe you were always beyond my
reach and my heart was playing safe
But was it love in your eyes I saw,
or a reflection of mine?
I'll never really know for sure, you
never really gave me time
Great lyics and great music make this

a great song.
"Lady Nina" is another quotable
gem, harshly depicting the life of a
shallow rich woman who has an affair
with the narrator. By the middle of
the second stanza, Fish's cynicism
reaches its peak:
Your little sister babysits, your hus
band picks you up at six
The make-up hides the bruises and
the tears so they never show
Because your beauty is the only thing
you'll ever own
It's the only way you'll ever know
to make your marks
The next two tracks continue in this
mold. "Freaks" is a fun song about
unusual people ("All the best freaks
are here, please stop staring at me"),
while "Tux On" describes a young rock
star's meteoric rise to fame in almost
too-graphic detail.
The conclusion, however, insures
that the listener walks away contented
as well as a little wiser. Recorded live
at a December 1983 Marillion concert
at the Edinburgh Playhouse, "Mar
garet" is one of the liveliest songs ever
chosen to end an album, fusing Irish
and Scottish folk songs into a master
ful display of musicianship and spon
tenaity. Each band member gets the
chance to strut his stuff, resulting in
a magnificent effort.
"B'sides Themselves" is clearly not
for everyone, as its hard-driving music
and graphic, sometimes-depressing
lyrics can be a little hard to handle.
However, if this review hasn't scared
you off, embark on a quest for this
great disk; you won't be sad you did.

Marillion — "B'sides Themselves"

Marillion may very well be the most
overlooked band of the decade. Enjoy
ing a momentary gasp of fame in 1985
with the British top-10 song
"Kayleigh" (off of their equally suc
cessful "Misplaced Childhood" album),
the group has for some mysterious
reason remained virtually unknown to
the masses.
It is not surprising, then, that their
best release is only available on an
import CD. (Translated into regular
English, this means "it is extremely
hard to find, and once you do you'll
have to hock the wife and kids, get a
second mortgage and stop eating for
a week to aftord it." Well, maybe it's
not all that bad, but the disk will still
cost more than one precious penny
once you find one.)
In spite of all this, "B'sides Them
selves" is well worth the lengthy quest,
as it contains nine tracks of the finest
stuff ever put on a single compilation.
Quite simply, the disk is awesome.
For the many who missed the band's
illusory bit of fame, Marillion's music
sounds like a mix of Pink Floyd and
Led Zepplin and draws heavily from
Genesis' older material, like the classic
song "Supper's Ready" that makes the
album "Foxtrot" one of rock's
masterpieces. Lead singer/songwriter
Fish (yes, that's right, the man calls
himself Fish) consistently pens bril
liant lyrics and melody lines that give

style and structure to the oft
independent guitar and keyboard lines.
All of these elements come to a head
in Marillion's masterpiece "Grendel,"
the opening track to "B'sides" that
retells the Old English epic "Beowulf
from the perspective of Grendel.
The result is 17 minutes of densely
textured music and lyrics that are
sometimes serene, sometimes graphi
cally violent — but always intriguing.
After the first couple listenings you
are not really sure exactly what's going
on, since the production causes inten
tional sensory overload, but it is easy
to see that this song is something spe
cial. Besides, where else can you get
musical pleasure and a literature les
son at the same time?
"Charting the Single" provides some
relaxation after the tempestuous
"Grendel." Fish and the boys make
no attempt to shock anyone here, but
merely perform a mellow yet happy
tune. The repeated line "Home is
where the heart lies, but if the heart
lies where is home is where the heart
lies ... but where is home?" is a great
mental tounge twister, but the song
never gets very deep.
At least until "Market Square
Heroes," that is. Few songs exude the
power and fierceness of Fish's
portrayal of a politician. The opening
stanza starts with a bang, and the
music only gets stronger form there.
He goes more than just a little over
board near the end.
Fish keeps up the heat into the next
cut. A friend and Marillion fan tells
me that "Three Boats Down From the

Candy" describes a routine trip to his
cocaine dealer. Let's leave it at that.
"Cinderella Search" pulls the lis
tener out of the fire and eases into
some beautiful, thought-provoking
music. Dipping into his bag of favorite
folklore and finding the Cinderella
story, Fish creates a song about his
quest for the perfect mate mirrored
by the tale's prince:
Maybe it was infatuation or the thrill
of the chase
Maybe you were always beyond my
reach and my heart was playing safe
But was it love in your eyes I saw,
or a reflection of mine?
I'll never really know for sure, you
never really gave me time
Great lyics and great music make this

a great song.
"Lady Nina" is another quotable
gem, harshly depicting the life of a
shallow rich woman who has an affair
with the narrator. By the middle of
the second stanza, Fish's cynicism
reaches its peak:
Your little sister babysits, your hus
band picks you up at six
The make-up hides the bruises and
the tears so they never show
Because your beauty is the only thing
you'll ever own
It's the only way you'll ever know
to make your marks
The next two tracks continue in this
mold. "Freaks" is a fun song about
unusual people ("All the best freaks
are here, please stop staring at me"),
while "Tux On" describes a young rock
star's meteoric rise to fame in almost
too-graphic detail.
The conclusion, however, insures
that the listener walks away contented
as well as a little wiser. Recorded live
at a December 1983 Marillion concert
at the Edinburgh Playhouse, "Mar
garet" is one of the liveliest songs ever
chosen to end an album, fusing Irish
and Scottish folk songs into a master
ful display of musicianship and spon
tenaity. Each band member gets the
chance to strut his stuff, resulting in
a magnificent effort.
"B'sides Themselves" is clearly not
for everyone, as its hard-driving music
and graphic, sometimes-depressing
lyrics can be a little hard to handle.
However, if this review hasn't scared
you off, embark on a quest for this
great disk; you won't be sad you did.
