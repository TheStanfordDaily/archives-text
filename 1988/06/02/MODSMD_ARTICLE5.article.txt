# Slow grievance system may spur USW lawsuit
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
The inefficiency of the griev
ance procedure for workers here
haa played a large part in con
vincing members of the United
Stanford Workers to consider
filing a class action suit against
the University, according to a
press representative for the un
ion.
The union announced last week
that it might file a class action
suit against the University be
cause a widespread "discrimina
tory pattern" has come to charac
terize much of Stanford's employ
ment practices and policies, ac
cording to Rodney Harnett, a field
representative for the USW Un
like individual claims, a ruling in
a class action suit would affect all
Stanford workers, including non
union members.
Barnett said that filing a suit
is the only way the union would
be able to address this problem
adequately because the employee
grievance procedure — which has
a backlog of several years — "haa
broken down."
"If we had a grievance proce
dure that worked smoothly, there
wouldn't be a need for a suit,"
he said.
While he admitted that a large

backlog of grievances exists, Mi
chael Vartain, staff counsel for
the University, said that the
grievance procedure can operate
efficiently.
"We think the grievance proce
dure could work well, and does
work well, up until the stage of
arbitration" when problems with
scheduling make it difficult to find
enough time to argue each case,
he said.
"No grievance procedure can
work with such an extensive num
ber of cases as we have," said
Vartain, adding that the union
routinely files an "extraordinarily
large number" of grievances,
which the University addresses
"in a timely manner" before they
go to arbitration. According to
Vartain, approximately 400 griev
ances have been filed since the
end of 1985, when the current
contract took effect.
Vartain also said that while it
is the union's responsibility to
schedule arbitration, they "have
not been diligent in scheduling
cases." He stressed that the griev
ance procedure was agreed upon
by both the union and the Uni
versity in their current contract.
Barnett disagreed that the un
ion is the source of the backlog.
