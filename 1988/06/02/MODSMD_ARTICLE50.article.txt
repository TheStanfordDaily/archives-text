## Return 'Raintown' for a refund 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Deacon Blue — "Raintown"

Tower Records set the chal
lenge, and Deacon Blue failed
miserably.
Every so often, the promotional
gurus at Tower find an album
that they deem so irresistable that
they refund your money, no ques
tions asked, if you really dislike
the selection. Cleverly enough,
they term this prime piece of mu
sical merchandise a No-Risk Disk.
Ordinarily, they seem to make
reasonably good decisions, since
no capitalist in his or her right
mind wants to refund money to
customer after customer. With
Deacon Blue's debut, however,
the bigwigs extended themselves
a bit too far. If not for the guar
antee, I would have been more
than just a little bummed out that
I wasted cash on this sad venture.
In fact, the only thing worth
while about the record is its pack
aging. Depicting a cloudy day en
veloping an unnamed British city,
the scene on the front cover of
"Raintown" evokes more thought
and emotion than all of the
record's 11 songs combined.
Basically, this album is a tragic
bore. Deacon Blue, a sextet from
the United Kingdom, fails
miserably in its attempt to lift
the rich, mellifluous sound made
famous by critically acclaimed
countrymen, The Dream Acade

my. Rather than aural ecstacy,
Deacon Blue incites indifference.
"Raintown" begins with the
mellow "Born in a Storm" fading
into the title track. The music is
calm and relaxing, but after a
while it grows tranquilizing.
The lyrics are equally uni
mpressive. Lead singer Ricky Ross
penned verses that sound quite
nice but are almost totally devoid
of meaning or signifigance. The
opening stanza of "Raintown"
tells it all:
It's a rain-dirt-town-job hurts,
but it don't pay
All these calls they're making
been driving you insane
But don't you see, don't you un
derstand
I'm waiting for my phone to
ring to make me all I am.

Suffice it to say that Ross will
not be contending for a spot in
the Lyricist Hall of Fame.
And then there are the vocals.
Whoever told Ross that he had
talent should be taken to the
stables, drawn and quartered,
then quartered again. Few voices
are more annoying than Ross', so
much so that the dull instrumen
tal provide a welcome respite for
the weary listener.
The bottom line is this: If you
really like The Dream Academy
and would like to hear a pale im
itation, go out and pick this up;
if you like it, great, but if you are
like me you can always make good
use of the No-Risk Disk refund.
What the heck — you've got noth
ing to lose!
