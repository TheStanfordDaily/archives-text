# Album Review
## Laing should go back to 'South' 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Shona Laing — "South"

Shona Laing has emerged
from Down Under, and I wish
she would return there imme
diately.
In a year highlighted by the
release of a brilliant debut by
Sinead O'Connor (a precocious
Irish performer) and Michelle
Shocked (a witty American
folksinger), fans and critics alike
seem eager to jump at the in
troductory effort of a new and
daring female artist. Unfortu
nately, Laing's first record sim
ply rings flat on overexpectant
ears.
Rather than demonstrating
the creativity that brought her
sister artists acclaim, New
Zealand's rookie singer/song
writer relies on uninteresting
and uninventive melody lines —
spit out by two synthesizers —
to compliment her equally hack
neyed lyrics. As many listeners
have been discovering in the
wake of Ryuchi Sakamoto's all
synth orchestrations on "The
Last Emperor" soundtrack, no
synthesizer can replace the
feeling or the sound of a real
band with actual bass guitars
and old-fashioned percussion.

"South" opens with "Drive
Baby Drive," a lively song with
out any substance. As the album
progresses and the yawns com
mence, Laing's weaknesses as a
songwriter overshadow her
prowess as a vocalist.
In fact, the first single re
leased provides the only light
on this sadly eclipsed release.
"(Glad I'm) Not a Kennedy"
manages to somewhat overcome
the sterility of the synth-rock
format to provide a modicum of
entertainment on the first few

listenings; however, on the
fourth or fifth time around, the
pleasant amenities (like the
snippets of JFK speeches
liberally sprinkled through the
last verses) lose their spark.
"The Migrant and the Refu
gee" and "Dockyard on a River"
also have their moments, but
these momentary lapses of
quality cannot compensate for
the general drivel that the al
bum offers. "South" may be the
dawning of a sadly inauspicious
career.
