Karl Kaussen, proprietor of
Cafe Mozart, taught philology at
UC-Berkeley before he opened his
Bush Street restaurant. But one
step into the elegant rooms of his
establishment, and one is con
vinced that Kaussen spent a great
deal of time in the university's
Department of Music. For in as
sembling the atmosphere for Cafe
Mozart, Kaussen has taken as its
theme — as you can quickly
gather — the work of Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart.
• Mozart enjoys exclusive
privileges in Kaussen's chambers,
where cantatas, quartets, and
symphonies mix with a decor of

red velvet drapes, oil paintings, a
fireplace and table settings of
white china, candles and roses.
Only 10 tables are located in the
restaurant's front dining rooms,
providing a setting decidedly in
timate. In the back, Kaussen has
two rooms available for private
functions.
Dinner at Cafe Mozart happens
six times a week (the restuarant
is closed on Sundays and does not
serve lunch), and it is presented
in a prix fixe scheme that includes
appetizer, entree, salad, dessert
and coffee. One's meal is hardly
limited by this plan, as the menu
is varied and has selections of
fresh seafood, poultry and beef.
Several daily specials, such as
venison, were also offered on the
night of our visit. Wine is sepa
rate, and Cafe Mozart cellars
many Californian and French
labels, with some German ones
as well — a nod to Salzberg is in
line of course.

We ordered appetizers of escar*
got with shiitake mushrooms in
pastry, and gravlax (portions of
salmon) in a dill mustard sauce,
served with finger toast. Both
dishes were in all ways excellent,
and in portions surprisingly
sizable for a first course. Encour
aging signs these were, and when
our entrees followed they proved
our expections well-founded.
Lambchops were covered in a
tarragon butter sauce and accom
panied by asparagus, carrots and
thinly sliced potatoes. The meat
was cooked to a perfect medium
rare, and though nicely flavored
with the tarragon, was not over
whelmed by it. The superb medal
lions of pork, prepared in a mus
tard sauce, also arrived with an
assortment of vegetables.
Dinner is leisurely at Cafe
Mozart, and it was quite a while
before we finally parted with our
entree plates. A lettuce and
vinaigrette salad was next before

us, and then dessert, a highlight
at the caf£. White and dark choc
olate mousse for one, a chocolate
gateax for the other; these were
rich and delightful, and we en
joyed them through several cups
of coffee.
A three-hour affair and at a
cost of $45 per person without
wine, this prix fixe plan is so well
orchestrated that at no time does
one feel too full or unable to face
another dish; each arrives at
precisely the right moment, and
with service professional and at
times smartly unobtrusive — Caf§
Mozart is a place for long con
versations, for Mozartish mus
ingß.
Cafe Mozart strikes fine chords
with its decor, warmth and
cuisine. One could not choose bet
ter for an end-of-the-school-year
evening in the City, or for those
of us filing through Stanford Sta
dium later this month, for a grad
uation celebration.
