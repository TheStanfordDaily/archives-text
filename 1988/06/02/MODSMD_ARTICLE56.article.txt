peating for The Stanford Daily,
which disposed of an over
matched Okada squad like trash
into a compactor, 4-0, to win
its second straight C-League
softball crown.
'Twas a languid but merry
bastion of staffers that went
into the second game of the im
promptu Friday doubleheader
against the heady but harmless
Okadans. But behind the efful
gent arm of senior pitcher Cy
Fialko, The Daily added another
win to its penumbra of tri
umphs.
Fialko, who shut down the
blighted Erector Set nine for the
final five innings in The Daily's
5-3 semifinal win, completed his
string of 12 scoreless innings
against Okada, recording
several called strikeouts while

aided by fielding that was more
solid than obsidian and more
fluid than lemonade.
Though no one asked for it,
the second coming of ancient
third-baseman Graig Nettles
materialized in the form of Daily
hot-corner specialist Mark
Lawrence, who repeatedly swal
lowed up any potential extra
base hits like Mikey eating Life
cereal.
Second-sacker Brendan "Rock
'n' Fire" Healey was no slouch
himself, fielding his position
with aplomb and verve. Junior
Mark "BugMe2Be" Smoyer
showed his intelligence if not
his arm by tagging a runner out
between first and second bases.
And one rookie, after rotating
from position to position like a
gyroscope run awry, found a
home in left field, raising his
fielding average above the Men
doza line.
But were it not for timely hit
ting, all these defensive efforts,
which culminated with Ken
Stevens ranging far behind
shortstop to record the game's
final out, would have been

egregiously wasted. Certainly
the squad went into Friday's
mercurial battles knowing it
would miss the sonorous and
epochal hits of Chris "Dude"
Myers wafting into the outfield.
The team responded, how
ever. In the penultimate game,
Fialko helped his own cause
with a pair of RBI raps. First
sacker Mikematt Bodnewman,
whose identity was still a mys
tery to many teammates, helped
with hits to the right side to
keep the opposing fielders
honest.
The key blow emerged from
the cannon bat of A.J. Thomas,
who lofted a chromatic drive in
the nightcap beyond the reach
of the outfield to record a triple,
The Daily's longest hit of the
year.
The dynasty of The Daily may
be in jeopardy, for as many as
eight members may graduate.
But hopes still reign high for a
hat trick in 1989, according to
outfielder Ken Fenyo.
"If The Daily can survive
without us, so can this team,"
he said.
