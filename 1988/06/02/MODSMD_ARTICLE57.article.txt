# Women cagers head to China
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The players on this year's Stanford
women's basketball team thought
that the Midwest Regional of the
NCAA Tournament at Austin, Texas,
was as far as they would go this
season. They were only off by 10,000
miles.

Afforded an opportunity that might have seemed
unheard of last year, the Cardinal squad has been
invited to compete against the national teams of
the Soviet Union, Poland, Japan, the People's Re
public of China, Bulgaria and several other Eastern
Bloc countries in a tournament to be held next
month in Wuhan, China.
In addition, sophomore guard Jennifer Azzi and
freshmen Sonja Henning and Trisha Stevens have
been invited to try out for U.S. select teams. Azzi
has the opportunity to join the U.S. Select Team,
essentially the B squad of the U.S. National Team,
while Henning and Stevens have received invites
to the Junior National Team tryouts.

Should any of the three earn a spot, they would
compete in a seperate tournament in Taipei, held
at the same time as the Wuhan competition. Thus,
it seems that all of the Cardinal returners are
China-bound.
"I think it could be a really good experience for
everyone," Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"It can really help us, because it is almost like
playing a mini-season in terms of basketball.
"We don't know what to expect in terms of caliber
of play, but it sounds like it could be very, very
good competition. International basketball is very
fast-paced, so there'll be a lot of running, a lot of
up-and-back."
International basketball also uses a men's ball
(which is bigger) and a longer three-point line than
the one adopted by the NCAA this year. Those are
the biggest worries the women will have, because
as guests of the Chinese government, they will have
all expenses but air fare paid for.
"You get the opportunity to know the other mem
bers on your team in a different environment from
Stanford and traveling in the Pac-10," VanDerveer
added.
