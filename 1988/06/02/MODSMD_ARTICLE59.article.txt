However, now that four
years spent at the same
university have passed, at
tempts to define the char
acter of this year's 1,841
seniors still seem as im
possible as when they ar
rived.
According to Dean of
Student Affairs James
Lyons, "first impressions
I of the class] probably last
until about the first mid
terms." Final impressions
of the class, however, are
shaped by the jumble of
intellectual and social chal
lenges encountered by
seniors during their under-

On a hectic September
night four years ago, over
1,500 starry-eyed mem

packed Memorial Audito

for the first time.
Looking around, they
saw a diversity of back
ground and talent few had
ever seen before. But they
all had something in com

ahead of them. And when

graduate years.
In his annual "Welcome
to Stanford" address on
that September night, Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy challenged the
Class of 1988 to consider
some of the more profound
choices this class would
confront.
"Stanford has much to
offer, but what you will
take away from it depends
in large part on how much
you put in, . . . This is a
very rich place, but it
rewards best those who are
willing to invest the energy
and time in exploring it
fully. We leave the choice

in that matter almost en
tirely up to you."
The challenge of making
tough choices did not end
after the first frenzied
weeks of nam e
memorizing and note
taking. Beyond the
challenges in the class
room or on the playing
field, the Class of 1988 has
acquired a reputation for
a subtle restlessness of
spirit that has sparked
renewed interest in "prag
matic" activism and public
service.
"I think this class, as

well as this student body at the
moment, is far more 'adven
turesome than one saw four years
ago," Lyons said.
According to Keith Archuleta,
a Stanford graduate who now
serves as assistant director of the
Row, activist members of this
year's class have helped lay the
ground for a "democratic educa
tion for everyone."
"It's becoming more of a norm
to question," he said.
The new commitment to public
service may not be unique to Stan
ford, but it is a "distinctive" fea
ture of the University, Lyons said.
"One sees signs of it across the
country, but we sure saw it first
here," he said.
But the class known for its
eagerness to promote change
seems in other ways remarkably
at ease, according to Audrey
Bernfield, who has watched its
four-year passage as director of
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter. Although she does not believe
that all graduates are getting
"great" or "greater" jobs,
Bernfield has encountered little
of the usual last-minute panic
symptomatic of a graduating
class.
"We've had much less 'frantic
ness' and much less fear of what's
outside," she said. "I think that
students seem to be taking in
stride whatever they are doing."
"As you look around you, you
will see students from all corners
of the globe, of all sorts of intel
lectual and religious convictions,
and of all shades of color. ... It
is a treasured quality, one that
we pursue actively as a matter of
institutional policy. It offers you
an opportunity to know the full
range of the great, mixed national

culture that is America. You are
likely never to have as good an
opportunity again."
Although Stanford continues to
attempt to create a racially and
ethnically diverse community,
even University officials admit
that progress has been painfully
slow, particularly in faculty and
administrative hirings. While the
wait goes on, the frustration and
impatience accrues.
A "growing number" of Stan
ford students, Archuleta said, are
"interested in exploring the real
issue of diversity" and multi
culturalism, a trend most evident
in this year's unprecedented and
highly publicized examination of
the University Western Culture
requirement. Spurred on by stu
dent protests, the Faculty Senate
this spring voted to change the
year-long course to integrate more
extensively the works of women,
minorities, and non-Western au
thors.
Stanford recognizes that this
critical re-examination of minor
ity life here is not a short-term
problem or challenge, Lyons said.
"We need to position ourselves
for this being part of our formal
and informal educational agenda
for the rest of our and your
lifetimes," he said. "If cultural
pluralism is to have meanings, we
must embed in the community
opportunities for the diverse cul
tures to celebrate themselves, to
find each other, and to have a
sense of place."
"It is easy to tolerate differences,
and it is also not worth very much.
It is much harder to explore and
to understand those differences,
but the personal growth that will
afford you is truly worthwhile.
The choice is yours."
Understanding of differences
requires more than just a diverse

community, a fact that the Uni
versity now recognizes, Lyons
said. "1 think there is an absolute
awareness that an earlier theory
of inter-group relations — 'If you
put people who are different from
each other together, good things
will happen by themselves' — that
probably operated here as well as
all other institutions, isn't work
ing," he said.
While Stanford attempts to en
courage openness to difference,
Lyons said he is constantly con
cerned that a backlash of in
tolerance to difference may be
growing, in part because of the
national political mood and the
policies of the Reagan administra
tion that can stifle attempts to
promote cultural understanding.
Stanford students apparently
have reached a mutual under
standing of the responsibilities of
being members of a residential
community. The perception of
Stanford as a markedly "quieter"
place than four years ago can be
attributed to "less tolerance of so
cial excesses within the student
body," Lyons said.
Lyons pointed to the student
led effort to curb alcohol con
sumption in Stanford Stadium
last fall as an example of how the
University can now deliberately
"hold back" on behavior directives
and let student opinion run its
course. "At that point, we were
counting on students to want to
take responsibility, and it paid
off," he said. "There was a time
when you couldn't count on that."
Although the issues have not
changed, the methods of protest
have evolved from mass demon
strations to more highly organized
and sophisticated campaigns.
Gone are the days when thou
sands of students protested in the
Quad, perhaps a subtle recogni

tion by this generation of students
of the disappointing results of the
unabashed activism of the 19705.
"Students are mixing activism
with pragmatism," Archuleta
said. "Why do the same things
they did before if they didn't
work."
But activism is now an
entrenched part of University life.
Even though the majority of stu
dents still prefers to concentrate
on scholarship and landing a good
job, Archuleta said today's grad
uates are "more than ever aware
of the issues."
"I think they will be a lot more
sensitive going out into the real

world," he said.
This sensitivity has been ap
plied by many members of the
Class of 1988 into commitments
to public service. "If somebody
four or five years ago said Stan
ford is going to have a student
body that is substantially commit
ted to the ideals of public service,
I wouldn't have predicted what
we have now," Lyons said. "I see
people who are doing just ex
traordinary things just because it
feels good to them to do it."
"What it represented to me and
to others was that there was an
awareness in the student body —
an eagerness to get out and do
something both concrete and
pragmatic to make their world a
little better and themselves better
in the process."
The interest in public service
has been encouraged by heavy
promotion of public service oppor
tunities by the undergraduate ad
vising system, career counseling,
and the establishment of a special
Public Service Center, which now
enjoys the fruits of solid institu
tional support.
"Whenever students offer any
option, we talk about the public
service aspects," Bernfield said.
"We're especially interested in
grabbing onto any student that is
interested in education and en

couraging him or her. If we send
Stanford students out to teach,
we're going to do something won
derful for the educational sys
tem."
More graduates are also apply
ing to law school and fewer to
medical school, reflecting a
nationwide trend, she said. "We
think we have as many people
applying to medical school as
before, but suddenly we have this
influx of people in law."
Seniors also seem more aware
of the diverse opportunities in
traditional graduate education
rather than professional degrees.
"The difference is that we have
more students that we're seeing
who are interested in in general
graduate education — getting a
PhD. versus an M.D. or a J.D. or
a M.8.A.," Bernfield said. "That's
exciting. I think it's a trend, and
we're very pleased about it."
"The choices you now will make
will determine how well you take
advantage of those opportunities.
I hope that as you make each
choice, you will find time to think
of the chance you have been given,
and the responsibility that goes
with it. ... I hope that at Com
mencement — the next great tran
sition in your life — you will be
able to look back with satisfaction
and joy at the choices you have
made."

Two Orientation Volunteers got more than they bargained for when
were assigned to baggage duty during Orientation '84. Now, the
class of '88 must carry its own baggage.

"Five thousand dollars?" asks a surprised frosh during registration
'84. Now, $70,000 later, that initial shock has probably given way
to resignation.
