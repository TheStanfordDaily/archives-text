## Student staff scurries to set up 97th Commencement 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
As some 30,000 parents, relatives and
friends pass through the Palm Drive gates
Sunday to attend the 97th Stanford Com
mencement ceremonies, they will see a Stan
ford that has put its best foot forward, spend
ing hundreds of thousands of dollars to get
the campus into top shape for graduation.
But what those 30,000 visitors won't see
is the work that goes on behind the scenes
— including the hours of labor spent setting
up and cleaning by the 65-student graduation
crew, working an eight-day, 52-hour week to
make graduation possible.

Over the course of the Commencement
Week, student crews will set up and take
down 27,000 chairs, 400 tables, 743 banners,
and 300 garbage cans in events for the 4,200
graduates anticipated this year. Stanford had
to rent 9,000 chairs — in addition to the
18,000 the University owns — in order to
provide for 15 different graduation-related
events. The events include Phi Beta Kappa
ceremonies, the Senior Day Party and Bacca
laureate, as well as the 48 separate departmen
tal degree-granting ceremonies after Com
mencement in Stanford Stadium Sunday.
"Each year, because of the larger parent
turnout, even more needs to be done," said
Operations Coordinator for University Events
and Services Bill Cleveland, noting that this
year's turnout could be the largest ever. "The
thing to keep in mind is that a whole bunch
of people are responsible for making this hap
pen.
"A lot of people don't realize that this is
put on by student support and student staff.
They are the ones who are setting up the
trash cans, doing clean up, being ushers, act
ing as flagbearers or whatever," Cleveland
said.
Although students work up to 16 hours
Saturday and Sunday, most of them, like
freshman Eliseo Padilla, say they enjoy the
opportunity to earn time-and-a-half or double
time wages early in the summer. Sophomore
Eric Jones, who worked on the chair crew
last year, said the work became a big game,
even though each student had to set up and
tear down about 1,500 chairs.
"We developed a whole gang mentality to
get the work done," Jones said. "One day we
worked right through lunch to get done and
one of the guys almost caused a riot when
he found this huge box of donuts in a garbage

can and started eating them in front of a mob
of hungry people on the crew who had been
working all day in the hot sun without any
thing to eat."
As the leftovers found in trash cans suggest,
food is a big part of the Commencement out
put. The 48 departments and schools will
spend something like $150,000 on catering
for the Sunday degree conferral ceremonies.
For example, the History Department, with
about 100 graduates, spent $3,000 last year
and will probably exceed that total this week
end.
"Campus is like this floating sea of garbage
afterward," Jones remembered. "All the pomp
and circumstance is over, but there is a ton
of food left from the caterers. It was like a
barbarian horde, feasting on leftover brownies
and everything."
The clean-up after Commencement overlaps
into the next week and total work for the
busiest students could entail 76 hours of labor
in eight days, according to Vince Foecke of
