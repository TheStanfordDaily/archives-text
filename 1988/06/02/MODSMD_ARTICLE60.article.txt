## Student staff scurries to set up 97th Commencement 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
As some 30,000 parents, relatives and
friends pass through the Palm Drive gates
Sunday to attend the 97th Stanford Com
mencement ceremonies, they will see a Stan
ford that has put its best foot forward, spend
ing hundreds of thousands of dollars to get
the campus into top shape for graduation.
But what those 30,000 visitors won't see
is the work that goes on behind the scenes
— including the hours of labor spent setting
up and cleaning by the 65-student graduation
crew, working an eight-day, 52-hour week to
make graduation possible.

Over the course of the Commencement
Week, student crews will set up and take
down 27,000 chairs, 400 tables, 743 banners,
and 300 garbage cans in events for the 4,200
graduates anticipated this year. Stanford had
to rent 9,000 chairs — in addition to the
18,000 the University owns — in order to
provide for 15 different graduation-related
events. The events include Phi Beta Kappa
ceremonies, the Senior Day Party and Bacca
laureate, as well as the 48 separate departmen
tal degree-granting ceremonies after Com
mencement in Stanford Stadium Sunday.
"Each year, because of the larger parent
turnout, even more needs to be done," said
Operations Coordinator for University Events
and Services Bill Cleveland, noting that this
year's turnout could be the largest ever. "The
thing to keep in mind is that a whole bunch
of people are responsible for making this hap
pen.
"A lot of people don't realize that this is
put on by student support and student staff.
They are the ones who are setting up the
trash cans, doing clean up, being ushers, act
ing as flagbearers or whatever," Cleveland
said.
Although students work up to 16 hours
Saturday and Sunday, most of them, like
freshman Eliseo Padilla, say they enjoy the
opportunity to earn time-and-a-half or double
time wages early in the summer. Sophomore
Eric Jones, who worked on the chair crew
last year, said the work became a big game,
even though each student had to set up and
tear down about 1,500 chairs.
"We developed a whole gang mentality to
get the work done," Jones said. "One day we
worked right through lunch to get done and
one of the guys almost caused a riot when
he found this huge box of donuts in a garbage

can and started eating them in front of a mob
of hungry people on the crew who had been
working all day in the hot sun without any
thing to eat."
As the leftovers found in trash cans suggest,
food is a big part of the Commencement out
put. The 48 departments and schools will
spend something like $150,000 on catering
for the Sunday degree conferral ceremonies.
For example, the History Department, with
about 100 graduates, spent $3,000 last year
and will probably exceed that total this week
end.
"Campus is like this floating sea of garbage
afterward," Jones remembered. "All the pomp
and circumstance is over, but there is a ton
of food left from the caterers. It was like a
barbarian horde, feasting on leftover brownies
and everything."
The clean-up after Commencement overlaps
into the next week and total work for the
busiest students could entail 76 hours of labor
in eight days, according to Vince Foecke of

Events and Services. But even
toward the end of the job, stu
dents say they are still having fun.
"You get to knock down all the
chairs when it's done and that is
a whole release which is wonder
ful after finals," Jones said. "You
get pretty tired of setting up
chairs exactly in the right place
to the inch, so knocking them over
is a great way to get out all your
frustrations."
In addition to the 65-student
work crew and a contingent of 84
student ushers, Events and Serv
ices provides 30 full-time support
personnel as supervisors,
Cleveland said. Countless other
University employees, contrac
tors, and local business people
also get in on the act of making
graduation a memorable experi
ence.
For example, Supervisor of
Grounds Larry Atwater has his
crew plant 8,800 flowers in the
Oval, planning to have them all
bloom by graduation time. Be
cause of the water shortage this
year, Atwater said his crews have
had to "rob Peter to save Paul."
They have diverted water to each
of the 48 degree-conferral sites
while leaving other campus areas

dry in order to cut back 35 percent
on the University's water use dur
ing the drought.
Similarly busy, the office of
Margarita Ibarra, who is coordi
nating Commencement this year,
has been swamped with informa
tion in recent days. Ibarra and
her staff have approved all aspects
of graduation, from the placement
of 4,400 chairs on the graduation
stage, which will be shaped like
a Grecian temple, to the guide
lines for a new outdoor smoking
policy this year.
Her office will spend approxi
mately $170,000 coordinating the
administrative and technical side
of the graduation ceremonies.
Commencment is also a big
weekend for local businesses.
Hotels, like the Stanford Park and
the Holiday Inn Palo Alto, have
been booked since October and
reservations personnel say the
hotels filled up especially fast this
year. Even though many local
hotels upped their room rates 10
to 15 percent for Commencement
weekend, national reservation
networks like Best Western's re
ported last week that the nearest
hotel vacancies for June 11 to 13
were across the Bay in Fremont.
Local restaurants with banquet
facilities also have been booked
for weeks, and bakeries like the
Prolific Oven in Palo Alto report
a run on graduation cakes al

ready. Even clothiers and gift
shops report a slight increase in
business during Commencement
as parents buy their graduating
children business suits or brief
cases as graduation gifts.
But for the 65 non-graduates
who work on the student crews,
there will be not gifts after Sun
day's ceremony. Their compensa
tion will be aching muscles, a

chance to raid the graduation lef
tovers, and a hearty paycheck.
"A job like this afforded you
the opportunity to see that it is
a lot harder than it appears to
put on Commencement," Jones
said. "There are a lot of things
that you don't see when you are
a student here or a parent and it
gives you a lot of perspective to
work on graduation crew."


As a sea of caps and gowns flows into the stadium Sunday, parents
and friends in the stands will be straining to find their special
speck of black among the tide of graduates taking their seats. For
all the pomp and circumstance, they may miss the 'little touches'
that make commencement seem smooth and elegant.

As the leftovers found in trash cans suggest,
food is a big part of the Commencement out
put. The 48 departments and schools will
spend something like $150,000 on catering
for the Sunday degree conferral ceremonies.
For example, the History Department, with
about 100 graduates, spent $3,000 last year
and will probably exceed that total this week
end.
"Campus is like this floating sea of garbage
afterward," Jones remembered. "All the pomp
and circumstance is over, but there is a ton
of food left from the caterers. It was like a
barbarian horde, feasting on leftover brownies
and everything."
The clean-up after Commencement overlaps
into the next week and total work for the
busiest students could entail 76 hours of labor
in eight days, according to Vince Foecke of

Events and Services. But even
toward the end of the job, stu
dents say they are still having fun.
"You get to knock down all the
chairs when it's done and that is
a whole release which is wonder
ful after finals," Jones said. "You
get pretty tired of setting up
chairs exactly in the right place
to the inch, so knocking them over
is a great way to get out all your
frustrations."
In addition to the 65-student
work crew and a contingent of 84
student ushers, Events and Serv
ices provides 30 full-time support
personnel as supervisors,
Cleveland said. Countless other
University employees, contrac
tors, and local business people
also get in on the act of making
graduation a memorable experi
ence.
For example, Supervisor of
Grounds Larry Atwater has his
crew plant 8,800 flowers in the
Oval, planning to have them all
bloom by graduation time. Be
cause of the water shortage this
year, Atwater said his crews have
had to "rob Peter to save Paul."
They have diverted water to each
of the 48 degree-conferral sites
while leaving other campus areas

dry in order to cut back 35 percent
on the University's water use dur
ing the drought.
Similarly busy, the office of
Margarita Ibarra, who is coordi
nating Commencement this year,
has been swamped with informa
tion in recent days. Ibarra and
her staff have approved all aspects
of graduation, from the placement
of 4,400 chairs on the graduation
stage, which will be shaped like
a Grecian temple, to the guide
lines for a new outdoor smoking
policy this year.
Her office will spend approxi
mately $170,000 coordinating the
administrative and technical side
of the graduation ceremonies.
Commencment is also a big
weekend for local businesses.
Hotels, like the Stanford Park and
the Holiday Inn Palo Alto, have
been booked since October and
reservations personnel say the
hotels filled up especially fast this
year. Even though many local
hotels upped their room rates 10
to 15 percent for Commencement
weekend, national reservation
networks like Best Western's re
ported last week that the nearest
hotel vacancies for June 11 to 13
were across the Bay in Fremont.
Local restaurants with banquet
facilities also have been booked
for weeks, and bakeries like the
Prolific Oven in Palo Alto report
a run on graduation cakes al

ready. Even clothiers and gift
shops report a slight increase in
business during Commencement
as parents buy their graduating
children business suits or brief
cases as graduation gifts.
But for the 65 non-graduates
who work on the student crews,
there will be not gifts after Sun
day's ceremony. Their compensa
tion will be aching muscles, a

chance to raid the graduation lef
tovers, and a hearty paycheck.
"A job like this afforded you
the opportunity to see that it is
a lot harder than it appears to
put on Commencement," Jones
said. "There are a lot of things
that you don't see when you are
a student here or a parent and it
gives you a lot of perspective to
work on graduation crew."


As a sea of caps and gowns flows into the stadium Sunday, parents
and friends in the stands will be straining to find their special
speck of black among the tide of graduates taking their seats. For
all the pomp and circumstance, they may miss the 'little touches'
that make commencement seem smooth and elegant.
As some 30,000 parents, relatives and
friends pass through the Palm Drive gates
Sunday to attend the 97th Stanford Com
mencement ceremonies, they will see a Stan
ford that has put its best foot forward, spend
ing hundreds of thousands of dollars to get
the campus into top shape for graduation.
But what those 30,000 visitors won't see
is the work that goes on behind the scenes
— including the hours of labor spent setting
up and cleaning by the 65-student graduation
crew, working an eight-day, 52-hour week to
make graduation possible.

Over the course of the Commencement
Week, student crews will set up and take
down 27,000 chairs, 400 tables, 743 banners,
and 300 garbage cans in events for the 4,200
graduates anticipated this year. Stanford had
to rent 9,000 chairs — in addition to the
18,000 the University owns — in order to
provide for 15 different graduation-related
events. The events include Phi Beta Kappa
ceremonies, the Senior Day Party and Bacca
laureate, as well as the 48 separate departmen
tal degree-granting ceremonies after Com
mencement in Stanford Stadium Sunday.
"Each year, because of the larger parent
turnout, even more needs to be done," said
Operations Coordinator for University Events
and Services Bill Cleveland, noting that this
year's turnout could be the largest ever. "The
thing to keep in mind is that a whole bunch
of people are responsible for making this hap
pen.
"A lot of people don't realize that this is
put on by student support and student staff.
They are the ones who are setting up the
trash cans, doing clean up, being ushers, act
ing as flagbearers or whatever," Cleveland
said.
Although students work up to 16 hours
Saturday and Sunday, most of them, like
freshman Eliseo Padilla, say they enjoy the
opportunity to earn time-and-a-half or double
time wages early in the summer. Sophomore
Eric Jones, who worked on the chair crew
last year, said the work became a big game,
even though each student had to set up and
tear down about 1,500 chairs.
"We developed a whole gang mentality to
get the work done," Jones said. "One day we
worked right through lunch to get done and
one of the guys almost caused a riot when
he found this huge box of donuts in a garbage
