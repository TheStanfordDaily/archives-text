# Time warp: Seniors encapsulated until 2088
## 
### Lori Silver Editorial staff 
When Stanford's class of 2088
digs up a time capsule prepared
by the class of 1988, videotapes,
quotes from seniors and other
sorted memorabilia will paint a
picture of an unusually active
group of graduates, says Ed
Goines, one of this year's four
senior class presidents.
"We're known for (being) an
especially active class. We've had
a good turnout for events," adds
Keith Yamashita, also a senior
class president.
Unlike other classes who have
decided to open their capsules at
their 50-year reunions, the class
of 1988 has specifically requested
that their capsule touch a future
generation when Stanford gradu
ates unearth it 100 years from
now.
The capsule, which will be sunk
beneath the bronze senior plaque
bearing the numbers '88' during
a ceremony Saturday, will contain
momentos of the many senior
class activities. Videotapes that
record The Senior Talent Show
and The Senior Event will accom
pany flyers, articles and t-shirts
from class activities. Pictures of
different graduates and a letter
to the class of 2088 will also be
included.
This year's senior class presi
dents — Goines, Yamashita, Liz
Marks and Stacy Estrella — have
organized over 50 activites in the
space of a year, upholding tradi

tions and creating new ones in
the process.
"Our objective was to plan an
array of innovative activities that
would cater to diverse interests
and promote class unity," Marks
said.
"We wanted activities that
would involve active, constructive
participation and would deem
phasize alcohol — that would go
beyond pub nights," she said.
Senior Dis-Orientation and The
Senior Event, both of which took
place October 10, were two new
events designed to promote class
unity. During afternoon Dis-
Orientation, seniors participated
in a Twister game, square-dancing
and played volleyball. That eve
ning, over 600 seniors gathered
in Mem Aud to hear speeches by
former Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon and several Stanford
alumni.
"We wanted to set the mood
and tempo of the year," Yama
shita said. "It was good event."
Another new event was the
senior service project, which
matched over 50 seniors each with
a child from a big brother/big

sister program in Palo Alto. "It
was a chance for seniors to get
involved in public service and give
something back to the communi
ty," Yamashita said.
While the four presidents
placed emphasis on new and
original events, they were careful
to retain traditions.
The Halloween party held at

the masoleum, where Leland and
Jane Stanford are buried, was
"well-attended" according to
Yamashita, despite the absence of
alcohol. And the Senior Formal
attracted over 1,000 people, twice
last year's number.
The traditional senior class gift
will be "publication distribution
centers," which Marks described
as "nice, wooden racks" designed
to hold campus publications for
students to read. The racks will
be located in Stern dining halls
and will make student publica
tions more accessible, Marks said.
"It's been a fantastic year,"
Goines said. "I've made a lot of
friends. I just hope we continue
to be as close as we were here."
