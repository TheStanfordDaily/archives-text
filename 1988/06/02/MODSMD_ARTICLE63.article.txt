# Commencement speaker focuses on family, journalism
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
His career in journalism began
with free-lance work for black
owned weekly papers in the New
York area. He then decided to ap
ply for a staff writer position on
a traditionally white daily news
paper.
Hundreds of resumes and rejec
tions later, Maynard landed a spot
on the York Gazette and Daily in
Pennsylvania, where he covered
the beginnings of the civil rights
movement in the South.
In 1966 Maynard applied for
and received the prestigious Har
vard University Nieman Fellow
ship, awarded annually to distin
guished journalists. The following
year he became the White House
correspondent for The Washing
ton Post, where he eventually be
came an associate editor.
Maynard married Nancy Hicks
in 1975 when she was a science
and medical writer for the New
York Times. She has since become
the vice president of The Tribune,
securing the position in only the
last few months.
Along with his wife, who is a
Stanford graduate, Maynard left
the newspaper business in 1977
to found The Institute for Jour
nalism Education at UC-Berkeley.
Dedicated to training minority

Robert Maynard is a man who
has not taken the traditional
routes to success.
Nevertheless, his gritty ambi
tion, business savvy and love for
the Oakland community have all
helped this year's Commence
ment speaker become the first
black editor, president and owner
of a mfyor metropolitan newspa
per, The Tribune of Oakland.
Interviewed in his Oakland
home, Maynard said his success
"springs from his curiosity to
learn" — a desire which has been
one of the prime motivating forces
behind his many achievements.
His unusual story begins long
before he set out to revitalize the
daily paper's circulation and cov
erage of the East Bay area.
Born in Brooklyn in 1938 to
immigrant parents from Bar
bados, Maynard dropped out of
high school as a teenager. His
dream of becoming a writer led
him to New York's Greenwich Vil
lage where he met such well
known writers as Langston
Hughes and James Baldwin, both
of whom encouraged him to "keep
writing."

journalists, the Institute is often
credited for raising the number
of black journalists in predomi
nantly white newspapers across
the nation.
Still intensely interested in the
advancement of those who aspire
to become journalists, Maynard's
advice is to "work hard to be
curious, work even harder to be
humble."
Maynard began newspaper
work again in 1979 when he asked
Gannett Co., the national news
paper chain which also owns USA
Today, for the editor position on
The Tribune. Since then, he has
worked to revamp the paper's
staff, its reputation in the com
munity and its circulation. He
eventually bought the paper from
Gannett in 1983.
In addition to his work at the
Tribune, Maynard has had an
even more direct hand in affecting
public opinion as a television com
mentator and as a nationally syn
dicated columnist.
Maynard often appears on
"This Week with David Brinkley"
and the "MacNeil/Lehrer News
Hour," where he provides his per
spective on national develop
ments.
In his national column,

Maynard is known for his insights
on a concern crucial to him spe
cifically as a parent of three, and
to the nation at large — the state
of education in this country.
Maynard called education the
"principal solution" to the na
tion's weighty problems with
drugs and poverty. He added that
the the country must go beyond
its "Just Say No" campaign
against drugs and investigate the
underlying causes of drug addic
tion.
Last July, Maynard was faced
with an entirely new kind of chal
lenge when he was diagnosed with
prostate cancer.
Four months of radiation
therapy sapped his energy and

'At the core of my life is, first, my family. I
want to help each member achieve their
goals. Next is the newspaper... and then my
growth as a writer. If things do not relate to
those goals, you will not see me doing it.'
— Robert Maynard

Maynard said "the illness helped
me understand that I was spread
ing myself too thin." Aside from
his work at The Tribune,
Maynard regularly devotes time
to making many public appear
ances and sitting on no less than
24 boards, including the Pulitzer
Prize Board and the Board of
Directors for the Associated
Press.
Maynard has since reduced his
involvement in many areas and
says his health and sense of
priorities have improved as a
result.

it," Maynard said.
While some may consider
Maynard, now 50, a candidate for
retirement, he scoffs at the idea.
"What does [retirement]
mean?" he asked. "I don't regard
myself as a candidate for retire
ment ever. I will never formally
conclude one phase of life to begin
another. If something is out there
to be done, L'm doing it."

has not taken the traditional
routes to success.
Nevertheless, his gritty ambi
tion, business savvy and love for
the Oakland community have all
helped this year's Commence
ment speaker become the first
black editor, president and owner
of a mfyor metropolitan newspa
per, The Tribune of Oakland.
Interviewed in his Oakland
home, Maynard said his success
"springs from his curiosity to
learn" — a desire which has been
one of the prime motivating forces
behind his many achievements.
His unusual story begins long
before he set out to revitalize the
daily paper's circulation and cov
erage of the East Bay area.
Born in Brooklyn in 1938 to
immigrant parents from Bar
bados, Maynard dropped out of
high school as a teenager. His
dream of becoming a writer led
him to New York's Greenwich Vil
lage where he met such well
known writers as Langston
Hughes and James Baldwin, both
of whom encouraged him to "keep
writing."

journalists, the Institute is often
credited for raising the number
of black journalists in predomi
nantly white newspapers across
the nation.
Still intensely interested in the
advancement of those who aspire
to become journalists, Maynard's
advice is to "work hard to be
curious, work even harder to be
humble."
Maynard began newspaper
work again in 1979 when he asked
Gannett Co., the national news
paper chain which also owns USA
Today, for the editor position on
The Tribune. Since then, he has
worked to revamp the paper's
staff, its reputation in the com
munity and its circulation. He
eventually bought the paper from
Gannett in 1983.
In addition to his work at the
Tribune, Maynard has had an
even more direct hand in affecting
public opinion as a television com
mentator and as a nationally syn
dicated columnist.
Maynard often appears on
"This Week with David Brinkley"
and the "MacNeil/Lehrer News
Hour," where he provides his per
spective on national develop
ments.
In his national column,

Maynard is known for his insights
on a concern crucial to him spe
cifically as a parent of three, and
to the nation at large — the state
of education in this country.
Maynard called education the
"principal solution" to the na
tion's weighty problems with
drugs and poverty. He added that
the the country must go beyond
its "Just Say No" campaign
against drugs and investigate the
underlying causes of drug addic
tion.
Last July, Maynard was faced
with an entirely new kind of chal

prostate cancer.

'At the core of my life is, first, my family. I
want to help each member achieve their
goals. Next is the newspaper... and then my
growth as a writer. If things do not relate to
those goals, you will not see me doing it.'
— Robert Maynard

Maynard said "the illness helped
me understand that I was spread
ing myself too thin." Aside from
his work at The Tribune,
Maynard regularly devotes time
to making many public appear
ances and sitting on no less than
24 boards, including the Pulitzer
Prize Board and the Board of
Directors for the Associated
Press.
Maynard has since reduced his
involvement in many areas and
says his health and sense of
priorities have improved as a
result.
"At the core of my life is, first,

"If things do not relate to those

it," Maynard said.
While some may consider
Maynard, now 50, a candidate for
retirement, he scoffs at the idea.
"What does [retirement]
mean?" he asked. "I don't regard
myself as a candidate for retire
ment ever. I will never formally
conclude one phase of life to begin
another. If something is out there
to be done, L'm doing it."

Robert Maynard
His career in journalism began
with free-lance work for black
owned weekly papers in the New
York area. He then decided to ap
ply for a staff writer position on
a traditionally white daily news
paper.
Hundreds of resumes and rejec
tions later, Maynard landed a spot
on the York Gazette and Daily in
Pennsylvania, where he covered
the beginnings of the civil rights
movement in the South.
In 1966 Maynard applied for
and received the prestigious Har
vard University Nieman Fellow
ship, awarded annually to distin
guished journalists. The following
year he became the White House
correspondent for The Washing
ton Post, where he eventually be
came an associate editor.
Maynard married Nancy Hicks
in 1975 when she was a science
and medical writer for the New
York Times. She has since become
the vice president of The Tribune,
securing the position in only the
last few months.
Along with his wife, who is a
Stanford graduate, Maynard left
the newspaper business in 1977
to found The Institute for Jour
nalism Education at UC-Berkeley.
