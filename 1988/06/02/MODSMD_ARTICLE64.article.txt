As Stanford spiffs up in prep
aration for the 97th annual
Commencement ceremonies
Sunday, some observers fear it
may rain on the University's
parade, forcing a scramble to
seven different sites around
campus.
The National Weather Serv
ice reports there is a slim
chance of rain for Sunday. Al
though organizers say they
cannot remember Commence
ment ever being rained out, the
unusually prevalent clouds and
light showers of the past week
give signs of an unseasonal
rainstorm brewing.
If it does rain Sunday, Com
mencement will follow an in
tricate rain plan, distributed to
all seniors with their gradua
tion packets, according to Mar
garita Ibarra, Commencement
coordinator.
Under the rain plan, the
main ceremony for Commence
ment — including the Com

mencement address, announce
ment of awards, and President
Kennedy's remarks — will be
held in Maples Pavilion. Un
dergraduates and graduates in
the School of Humanities and
Sciences will watch the
proceedings live in Maples but
graduates in other depart
ments will hear the proceed
ings via KZSU broadcast to six
different campus auditoriums.
Baccalaureate would be held
in Memorial Church, the Class
Day Luncheon would move to
Maples and the President's
reception would be held in
Roble Gym in case of rain.
Showers would also wreak
havoc with the locations for In
dividual diploma award cere
monies.
"It would be a problem (if it
rains on Commencment), but
I'm pretty positive that we
won't have to worry about
that," Ibarra said.
The 4,200 graduates and
their 30,000 visitors expected
for Commencement hope she
is right.
