# Pledge aims to raise awareness
## 
### Jennifer Schmid Staff writer 
Many students marching
through graduation will carry
more than just a program listing
Sunday morning's events.
Some will also have in hand a
plain diploma-size sheet of paper
that reads: "I pledge to
thoroughly investigate and take
into account the social and envi
ronmental consequences of any
job opportunity I consider." A
place appears at the bottom of
the sheet for the bearer to sign
his or her name.
The Graduation Pledge of En
vironmental and Social Responsi
bility, the first ever to be intro
duced into Commencement cere
monies here, was designed by stu
dents at Stanford and other uni
versities around the country to
increase societal responsibility
among graduates as they enter
the workforce.
Each of the approximately
4,000 students expected at grad
uation will get a chance to pick
up a copy of the pledge when they
enter the stadium before ceremo
nies, according to graduate stu
dent Diane Honigberg, coordina
tor of the Graduation Pledge Al

liance.
The Graduation Pledge Alliance
is a coalition of 19 student organ
izations at Stanford who intro
duced the pledge as a referendum
in this spring's ASSU general
elections. Sixty-five percent of the
voting students approved the ref
erendum, providing graduates
with the opportunity to sign the
pledge.
Honigberg said the pledge will
remain voluntary and strictly per
sonal, as students simply sign
their card and keep it.
According to Graduation Pledge
Alliance representative Linda
Yates, a graduate student, the
pledge does not mean "that every
one should work for a nonprofit
organization or decline the oppor
tunity to make money. Rather it
means, for example, that if your
company is involved in a process
resulting in toxic wastes then you
will help make sure those wastes
are disposed of safely."
Stanford is not the first nor the
only university to include the
pledge in its graduation ceremo
nies.
The pledge was introduced at
Humboldt State University last
year and since then has spread
across the nation to schools such

as MIT and San Francisco State
University.
According to Honigberg, at least
six schools in California — includ
ing UC-Berkeley and UC-Santa
Cruz — are including the pledge
in their commencement ceremo
nies.
Stanford alumnus Matt Nico
demus, a leader of the National
Graduation Pledge Alliance and a
political science professor at
Humboldt State, said that over
700 of the 893 students who grad
uated from Humboldt State last
year picked up pledge cards.
University President Donald
Kennedy has said he supports the
pledge and, according to Honig
berg, he will refer to it in his
Commencement speech.
Honigberg said the size of the
pledge makes it a perfect fit for
each student's diploma folder and
"hopefully that's where people
will put it."
She also said the Public Service
Center, which along with
Memorial Church provided the fi
nancial support for the pledge ef
fort, suggested that members of
the GPA survey graduates as they
pick up the pledge to see whether
they might sign it.
