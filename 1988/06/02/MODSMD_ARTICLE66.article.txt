# Graduation without cap, gown once used as political protest
## 
### Andrew Berkowitz Staff writer 
Take a look around this Sun
day at the academic tradition
wrapped up in the caps and
gowns worn by the graduating
students. Now imagine a grad
uating class without this garb.
The "No Cap and Gown"
movement which changed the
look of Stanford's Commence
ment ceremonies in 1970 seems
far off today.
While this year's graduates
ponder over whether to sign the
"Senior Pledge of Environmen
tal and Social Responsibility,"
graduates puzzled over more
serious political concerns in
1970 — the year America's cam
puses turned into a bat
tleground.
It was that year that more
than 300 Stanford students
passed up graduating in the
traditional cap and gown as a
protest of the United States'
presence in Southeast Asia.
To Stanford students today it
seems that 1970 could hardly
have happened. In May of that

year the University was virtu
ally shut down for two weeks
as club-wielding, rock-throwing
students protesting the pres
ence of the Air Force ROTC at
Stanford at a time when Pres
ident Richard Nixon was send
ing troops to Cambodia. Pro
testers battled police and shat
tered windows across campus.
As violent student riots across
the country swelled that month
to epidemic proportions, Stan
ford was swept along on the
wave of social conciousness.
Hardly a student was to be
found on The Farm who was
not deeply concerned by the in
tense political issues of the day.
Other campuses were hit even
harder. Four protesting stu
dents were killed at Kent State;
California Governor Ronald
Reagan ordered the entire Uni
versity of California system
closed for four days so students
could reflect on the violence of
the past weeks in the UC sys
tem. Some schools, such as Bos
ton University, simply canceled
the final weeks of school, send

ing students away from campus
and canceling graduation.
Even as the rioting at Stan
ford gave way to a more peaceful
strike, classes were canceled or
virtually empty as students con
cerned with the war continued
to protest the presence of ROTC
on campus. It was not until Uni
versity President Kenneth Pit
zer announced that the ROTC
programs would be moved off
campus in 1971 that classes
were fully able to resume.
Still, Stanford students re
mained intensely political, and
as a part of that activism the
No Cap and Gown movement
was started for the senior class.
Seniors had the opportunity to
commit the rental fee for their
graduation vestments to a fund
which would be used to support
candidates committed to peace
in the upcoming elections.
Although Pitzer had person
ally issued a statement con
demning the U.S. policy in Cam
bodia, he urged seniors not to
reject their opportunity to grad
uate in full academic regalia.

Though graduation garb looks much the same today as it did in 1935, over 300 Stanford students
once protested U.S. intervention in Southeast Asia by declining to wear their robes at 1970
Commencement Ceremonies.
