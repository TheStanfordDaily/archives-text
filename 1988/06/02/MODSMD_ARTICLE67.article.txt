# Commencement speakers across nation impart wisdom
## 
### 
With final farewells, cham
pagne popping and all-out celebra
tions, graduating seniors still find
time to listen. And while Stan
ford's soon-to-be graduates listen
to Robert Maynard, editor and
president of The Tribune of Oak
land, other notables have already
spoken at college commencements
throughout the country.
From a Texas tycoon to the
Doonesbury cartoonist, the fol
lowing is a collection of notable
words from this year's commence
ment speakers:
President Ernest Boyer of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching — Trinity
University, San Antonio, Texas:
An incompetent teacher is even
worse than an incompetent sur
geon because a surgeon can only

cut up one person at a time.
Barnard President Ellen Futter
— Barnard College, New York,
N.Y.:
Education is empowerment —
individual and national. ... For
the United States of America to
be populated by a citizenry that
is uneducated, is a prescription
for disaster and a sentence to
everlasting mediocrity.
Education Secretary William
Bennett — University of South
ern Mississippi, Hattiesburg,
Miss.:
If a kid has to choose between
physics and Mickey Mouse, more
than likely he is going to choose
Mickey Mouse math. When you
look at schools that are successful

with disadvantaged children, you
will find highly structured class
rooms and emphasis on the basics.
Tycoon T. Boone Pickens —
George Washington University,
Washington, D.C.:
Don't fall victim to what I call
the ready-aim-aim-aim-aim
syndrome. You must be willing to
fire.
Novelist Cynthia Ozick — Bryn
Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pa.:
In the possession of a heritage,
there are no princes and no
paupers. Every reader is a poten
tial citizen of influence with a
claim on patrimony and on the
widest and most inclusive recesses
of the culture.

Cartoonist Garry Trudeau —
Duke University, Durham, N.C.:
If our society becomes a society
intolerant of failure and uncom
passionate in the face of suffering,
then surely we are all lost. . . .
The best your college education
can do for you now is remind you
that it's one thing to be self
absorbed and quite another to be
self-aware.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon
Peres — Jewish Theological Sem
inary of America, New York,
N.Y.:
We don't want to dominate the
Arabs because the Arabs don't
want to be dominated. . . . And
believe me, it is so difficult to
govern the Jewish people, why
should we try and govern some
body else, anyway?

Vietnamese Refugee Vu Thanh
Thy — Marist College, Pough
keepsie, N.Y.:
Surprising as it may seem, the
daily struggle of making a living
in America is more difficult to
cope with than all of the events
we went through in prison and
at sea. The reason is that there
is nothing heroic about surviving
the never ending problems of daily
life.
National League President A.
Hartlett Giamatti — MIT,
Cambridge, Mass.:
The enemy of the university is
not dissent, not disagreement, not
disagreeableness. Gentility is the
mark of a great finishing school,
not a university; a great univer
sity cares not for the gentile. It
cares for the blood and sinews of

ideas in non-coercive combat with
other ideas.
Vice President George Hush —
West Point Military Academy,
West Point, N.Y.:
The liberal elite do not under
stand — they never understood
— the common sense behind the
consensus. They act as if they
believe that strength is the preoc
cupation of bullies — as if they
believe that our desire to remain
strong is proof that we are the
agressor. They are so blinded by
ideology that they cannot see
what Americans have understood
for 40 years: that peace flows from
strength.
