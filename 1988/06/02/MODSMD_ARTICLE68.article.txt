# Public sector outweighs pin-striped

### 
1 oday, graduation looks ua squarely in the
eye. After four years of lectures, seminars,
labs and problem sets we must — finally —
face reality. And the world awaits, indeed
desperately needs, the problem-solving skills
we ve learned here. Domestic poverty, our
threatened environment and the volatile in
ternational climate all pose us daunting chal
lenges.
I believe we are uniquely capable of meeting
these challenges. Unfortunately, I fear many
of us will never even make the attempt.

To be sure, there are those among us who
plan to enter government, to work for public
interest law firms or go to medical school in
hopes of later developing public health pro
grams for the impoverished both here and
abroad. We should applaud them. But there
are many, many more of us who are heading
off to join the pin-striped ranks of corporate
America.
All of us have heard our classmates explain,
at one time or another, why we deserve high
salaries after graduation. Frankly, I'm tired
of hearing this. To be fair, many of us are
leaving Stanford saddled with large debts that
demand a sizeable income. Therefore, the high
cost of a Stanford education discourages work
in the public sector after graduation.
Ultimately, however, we students are re
sponsible for the ends to which we put our
education. We who have had the privilege of

studying here have a responsibility to give
back to society. Stanford's founding charter
states that the University should "promote
the public welfare by exercising an influence
on behalf of humanity and civilization."
Out in the world, we graduates should keep
this founding purpose in mind. We must fulfill
this commitment to the public good.
I've often been characterized as an idealist.
I take this as a compliment: Ideals are goals,
and idealistic goals provide us with moral
direction. If we have no ideals, we resign
ourselves to the world's problems instead of
trying to solve them.
Of course, most Stanford students do set
goals. But unfortunately, these goals are often
purely material, no loftier than the purchase
of a condo or a BMW. Given that we are
graduating from what some say is the best
university in the nation, the prevalence of
such materialism among students here is a
tragedy.
A desire for financial security is certainly
understandable. Money itself is no evil. But
the singular pursuit of it invariably breeds
insensitivity to the public good.

I discern this selfishness among us already.
I sense it in the conversations we have, in
the questions we don't ask and in the careers
we now so eagerly pursue.
We must beware of such callousness. We
must appreciate the great opportunities we
have had here. Most of all, however, we must
recognize the responsibility we have to put
our education to good use — to improve both
our society and the world.

John Pollack is a senior who will graduate
Sunday with a degree in American Studies.
