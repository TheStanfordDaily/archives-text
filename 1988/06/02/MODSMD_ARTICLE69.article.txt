# Dean Fred bids good-bye; Dean Jean still on high

### Vivian Rogers Kathy Lachenauer Staff writers 
school students were indeed considering Stanford
for their college education.
"By my last year there, there had been a growth
in the number of students applying and in the
number of high schools sending students to Stan
ford," Hargadon said.
Fetter said that one of her contributions was to
have the application process reviewed so that "ref
erences to the student's personal qualities could be
added."
While both deans have made quite an impact on
undergraduate life, students recognized their dis
tinct personalities.
Senior Class President Liz Marks, who worked
on the Alumni Executive Board with Hargadon
throughout the year, remembered the past dean as
a tall, big man who cruised about campus on a
motor scooter. Hargadon had "a style" all his own,
she said.
He could point to students and remember what
states they were from. His car's license plate read
"ADMIT." And when it came time for sending out
April's acceptance letters, Hargadon insisted on
walking to the mailbox and dropping them in him
self.
While Marks praised Hargadon's unique style,
she was equally enthusiastic about how "warm and
personable" Fetter is.
"Her warmth is a different kind of warmth than
Fred's — it is more one-on-one."

Back in 1984, excited freshmen arrived at Stan
ford only to learn that the man responsible for
bringing them to the University was gone.
They could not say thank you and hello to the
enthusiastic Fred Hargadon, Stanford's dean of un
dergraduate admissions for 16 years. Instead, a
refined British woman named Jean Fetter greeted
the new class.
But both deans will be at this year's Commence
ment ceremonies, and seniors will have a chance
to thank Hargadon.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Jean Fetter
replaced Hargadon in 1984 when he accepted an
executive position with the Educational Testing
Service, a New Jersey-based non-profit education
group that provides testing services to colleges. Har
gadon will return to the Farm this weekend to
speak at the senior's Class Day.
"If there was any class he had to speak to, this
class is it." Senior Class President Keith Yamashita
said. "We made an appeal for him to come."
The appeal came to Hargadon in a small, brown
package that gave him quite a surprise.
"All four of [the senior class presidents] recorded
a statement that it was important for him to finish
our year, and in a few days we received a tape
back," Yamashita explained.
On the cassette tape was a New Age song, "On
Your Way to Another Place," and then Hargadon's
short statement, "As you wish." The tape ended
with "All Right Now" — the Stanford Band's theme
song.
While both deans agreed that they tried to bring
to Stanford a "good mix of academically capable
students" by looking at students' backgrounds,
aspirations and academic interests, both admitted
that they have their own style.
"The students I picked were a stock portfolio.
There were the steady performers, the blue chip
and the high-risk, high-gain group," joked Har
gadon.
"Seriously, I looked for the student's ability to
perform succesfully, a high energy level and the
benefits each student could gain from one another,"
he said.
With a published statement on approved criteria,
Fetter's admission policy differs from Hargadon's
— now high school seniors can read that academic
excellence and personal achievement outside the
classroom are the two highest determining factors
for admission to Stanford.
"Nothing had ever been published before that,"
Fetter said.
Although there is a general admissions committee
to determine Stanford's admission policy, both Har
gadon and Fetter believe that as deans they changed
Stanford admissions.
After spending his first year at Stanford trying
to understand how and why the process operated,
Hargadon said he then decided to ensure that high

Hargadon could point to students and remember what states they
were from. His car's license plate read 'ADMIT.' And when it came
time for sending out April's acceptance letters, he insisted on walking
to the mailbox and dropping them in himself.

But Marks went on to assert that Hargadon's
"funny" and "jovial" personality is reflected in the
seniors — a class she saw as more lively than the
three below it.
"You do get the feeling that he's not uptight and
that is how I would characterize our class," she
said. "Our class has a lot of pretty free types."
"We are a little more relaxed. Our class definitely
is more active in a lot more activities" than the
other classes, Marks said, pointing to the high num
ber of seniors who appplied for resident assistant
jobs and participated in senior-sponsored social
events.
Junior Julie Lythcott, who is one of next year's
senior class presidents, agreed that their is a marked
difference between the seniors and the younger
classes, which were admitted by Fetter's admissions
staff.
"I have seen a definite difference in commitment,"
said Lythcott, an RA at Branner. According to Mar

tinez, the younger classes are "very into academics"
while the seniors were more involved in activities
like club sports and The Daily.
Calling the junior class "the engineering of a new
era," Martinez was proud that her own class was
the first one admitted by Fetter in 1985.
"As for the juniors, we are something special in
that we are Dean Jean's first," she said.
While Fetter is coming into her own at Stanford,
Hargadon realized that he, too, is meant for uni
versity life.
"I missed students and university life in general",
he said. Hargadon recently accepted the position as
dean of admissions at Princeton University.
But according to Marks, Hargon's heart will al
ways be with Stanford. He once admitted to Marks
that the Princeton faculty members he works with
"have kids who are in [the senior] class here" at
Stanford.

Though pictured here is University President Donald Kennedy's goodbye to Dean Fred when he left
his Stanford post in 1984, the admissions celebrity will say hello at graduation, much to the delight
of this year's class — the last group of Stanford students he admitted.
