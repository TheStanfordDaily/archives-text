### 
Sandra Day O'Connor, Su
preme Court justice; B.A. '50, eco
nomics, LLB. '52:
Favorite memory: Those classes
that revealed new horizons of
learning and the excitement of
discovery; and those golden
Californian afternoons and spring
and fall around the campus.
Skill learned: Perhaps the most
important thing I learned was in
law school — how to identify the
issues in a particular problem and
how to go about finding some so
lutions.

Anthony Kennedy, Supreme
Court justice whose son Greg is
graduating Sunday; B.A. '58, po
litical science:
Favorite Memory: Those end
less discussions with fellow Stan

ford students — sometimes point
less, sometimes productive, but al
ways absorbing creative energy.
They would occur unpredictably,
after class, after dinner, after mid
night, after any sensible point of
endurance.
Skill gained: That the secret joy
of isolated thought (which is
Holmes' phrase) is a reality; but
beyond the reality lies the duty
to transmit our thought to other
peoples, to other generations.

William Hewlett, co-founder of
the Hewlett-Packard Corpora
tion, B.S. '34, engineering; School
of Engineering '39, electrical en
gineering:
Favorite memory: The opportu
nity to work in the radio labora
tory on projects of my own and
with the enthusiastic support of
Professor Frederick Terman.
Skill gained: A thorough under
standing of the field of radio en
gineering — now known as
electronics.
Senator Kent Conrad, D-North
Dakota; B.A. '72, political sci
ence:
Favorite memory: I have so
many favorite memories. It's hard
to choose but I do remember one
particularly exciting football game
when Stanford defeated USC with
a last minute field goal in Los
Angeles. It was a great game. I'll
never forget it.

1: What is your favorite memory from your time
at Stanford?
2: What did you learn at Stanford that helped
you most later in life?

Skill gained: I learned to do my
homework. By that I mean I
learned to lay the groundwork,
develop the strategy and an
ticipate problems that could arise
in a given situation. The kind of
painstaking, careful approach
that I learned at Stanford has
served me very well over the
years.

Tom Peters, author of "In
Search of Excellence," "A Pas
sion for Excellence" and "Thriv
ing on Chaos," to be featured in
a PBS special this August titled
"The Leadership Alliance";
M.B.A. '72, Ph.D. '77, business:

Favorite memory: Stanford is
my favorite memory of Stanford.
There is such a vibrancy to the
place, such a sense of excitement.
Today, my office is in Palo Alto,
just blocks from campus. When
I'm in the dumps, or faced with
a tough problem, I often walk over
to campus. Just touching the soil,
and regaining the feel of the place,
silly as it may seem, is a big deal
and a big help.
Skill gained: I came to Stanford
in 1970 to get "a professional
degree," an M.B.A. Seven years

later, with a little time off in the
middle, I left with a PhD. Except
I've never really left. I learned a
respect for scholarship and metic
ulous research that has trans
formed my life. I came "on the
make" and left with "a mission"
and a wonderful network of col
leagues who have continually sup
ported me along the way.

Dianne Feinstein, former
mayor of San Francisco; B A. '55,
history:
Favorite memory: Being elected
vice president of the student body
and also attending the Rose Bowl
with Stanford vs. Illinois. (We lost
44-0).
Skill gained: I learned my aca
demic strengths and weaknesses.
The broad curriculum allowed me
to explore many areas and then
concentrate in those areas where
I was best and which I enjoyed
the most. Those subjects were his
tory and political science. I also
learned how to learn.
Tom Watson, professional gol
fer; Bj\. '71, psychology:
Favorite memory: I think the

memory of the very first week,
being so-called "indoctrinated"
into the Stanford life. I was in
Arroyo. All the activities that hap
pened the first week were all so
new to me. It was laying the
grounds for a life change.
Skill gained: I think the main
thing was to always seek the
truth.

Jim Hampton, editor and edi
torial page editor of the Miami
Herald; M.A. '60, communication
and journalism:
Favorite memory: Standing out
in front of Memorial Church on
a warm evening. I spent many an
evening gazing at Memorial
Church and I think the spirit of
Stanford is embodied there.
Skill gained: Probably the thing
that is most helpful has been the
ceaseless questioning I associate
with education at Stanford. It has
taught me to examine and look
at all sides of questions and not
just the simple answer, which is
usually wrong.
Edward Ginzton, chair of
Varian Corporation; School of
Engineering '38, electrical engi
neering, PhD. '41, electrical en
gineering:
Favorite Memory: Working in
a laboratory with a leaky roof. I
was working with goldfish.
Skill gained: On Professor Ter
man's advice, not to be hesitant
in approaching successful people.

John Gardner, founder of Com
mon Cause Magazine; B.A. *35,
psychology, M.A. '36, psychology:
Favorite Memory: Working as
a lifeguard at Lagunita in the
spring.
Skill gained: In my senior year
after three years of heroic loafing,
I learned to focus my energies on
serious matters.

Ken Kesey, author of "One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest",
B.A. '59, English:
Favorite memory: 0000000 . ..
I can't tell you that.
Skill gained: Respect for fellow
laborers in the same craft.
