## Fitting in at Stanford: the pastime of pontification 
### 
As June begins, the days at this collegiate citadel
get more and more like a blueprint of the way
Monet thought the world should look — pastels
leaking from the sky, tans leaping from brazen
limbs. The time is just right for snap judgments.
I have always wondered why generalising is such
a sport of decathlon intensity here. Maybe
"generalizing" isn't the right word. People prefer
to think of it as being opinionated. It's supposedly
a form of proving your self-worth, the human
(mostly male) equivalent of a mountain cat ter
ritorially marking a tree with urine.

You are derided here, thought of as passive,
strange, uninvolved, if you refuse to venture a
thoughtful-sounding monologue (no matter how
hastily you have to come up with it, and how
actually thoughtless your response therefore is) on
any spitball the world of Stanford discourse throws
you. You are seen as impotent if you are unwilling
to terrorize conceptual targets. Stammerers, waf
flers and equivocators might as well not even apply
here, because they're going to hit the shark den of
their lives if, by some weird twist of fate, they get
accepted.
One of those twists of fate is what brought me
here. That first afternoon, once the Mousketeer
Orientation volunteers had deposited me in front
of Alondra, I wandered in a daze back to the patio,
where a mob of my peers was exchanging airy
platitudes (punctuated by ebullient bursts of
laughter) about every piece of conversational flotsam
under the sun, no matter how arid.
So this was the big glittering marketplace of
undergraduate truisms. It felt more like a conference
of accountants.
Anyway, I just stood there, my brain sputtering
like a flooded battery in a late-model Chevy, feeling
like a pariah because I couldn't think of a damn
thing to pigeonhole. I began to wonder whether
this wasn't all some form of Martian chess whose
rules had, in my acceptance packet, been con
veniently replaced with one campus map too many.
That's what it is, this phenomenon — one big
hoot of a game. It's like Thumper without the
booze. Why not lump Savonarola or Mozambique
or speed metal or Reeboks or the Boston Celtics
into simple, tight categories that can be analyzed,

for our intellectual and emotional comfort, to
sanctimonious shreds? Why not reduce the world
to a pile of rancid cant for your discussion leader,
and then again, at the dinner table, for your rapt
(or so it would seem, until one of their opinions
turns yours to sawdust) audience of peers?
It's just a pastime. Come on. What else is there
for bare-chested college men and bare-legged college
women to do on languid spring afternoons, but to
shishkebab existence?
Reserving judgment is a fine piece of work. Es
pecially here. It's a way of paying sacrifice to the
world, reminding it (before it gets pissed at your
presumption and crushes you beneath its fist) that
you know it's ambiguous out there, you know that
life can't be reduced to a couple of dismissive pon
tifications over a cup of frozen yogurt.
But once I had been through enough discussion
sections and hallway arguments, I learned to dis
abuse myself of the hope that I was part of a silent
majority who — just maybe — didn't think it was
right to deliver thundering pronouncements on
things they knew nothing about.
And I started to dogmatize too. (As you have no
doubt unpleasantly noticed.) I began venturing lofty,
banal, bullshit opinions at the dinner table, about
this, that and nothing. More arrogantly still, I began
writing for The Daily.
When I got called "judgmental," I couldn't help
but wonder what made my opinions any more of
fensive to the sensibilities than those of any group
of chatterboxes you overhear in White Plaza every
day.
This dizzying logic is part of the point of Stanford
life. We have none of the snarling contradictions
the real world has: dropouts driving by in beat-up
Cadillacs and bashing in people's skulls with golf
clubs, teenagers with Uzis and beepers and vials of
crack.
These would be scary, not suburban. So we thrive
on good old double standards. And we inflate to
the point of nonsense our adolescent ambiguities
— the sort you would find on a Pet Shop Boys
album. It's OK to be coy about your words, your
state of mind, your politics, even your sexuality, as
long as it advances your pawn so much farther,
and as long as the move doesn't entail any real
risk — emotional or otherwise.

Stanford, in sum, is a castle lost in the mist, a
quixotic dream house full of people anxious to prove
that their reality is as immediate as the reality of
the world they aspire to join, or, more frequently,
to change. But, as everyone knows, college is the
ultimate vacation from reality; and illusions of
change, in this spa of higher learning, are the gid
dying strawberry daiquiris.
The Class of 1988, you will remember, despite
all its disingenuous commotion for the demolition
of the status quo, was one of the first to startle
Gallup pollsters when a good majority of the re
spondents said that getting a cushy job was more
important to them than finding the good life.
Yet we are labeled a "liberal" campus, and all
among us, even the most clownish frat boys, know
how to press all those bleeding-heart buttons. In
justice? Yeah, sure, babe, the world's uryust, just
as long as it's not to me. Unequal distribution of
resources? Yeah, whatever you say, dude, but you
touch my slice of the pie and I'll bite your ass off.
A friend once made what must have been the
most galloping generalization I have heard in four
years here. He said, "When you think about it,
we're all geeks. How would we have gotten in this
place if we hadn't been intense, insecure or intro
verted in high school?" I hastened, looking at all
the yammering, bright-garbed fitness freaks bus
tling around us, to correct him, but then I realized
something:
My friend's comment might just have been an
other hastily formed generalization, but when you
think about the Machiavellian posturings and
Molierian displays of mannered plumage that make
this university tick, you have to honestly wonder.
Dicking people over is hardly an art form, though
you wouldn't know that here. The charade of com
pleting those smooth operations is the neurotic Stan
fordite's last refuge from the real world.
And that world, to those of us about to hit the
asphalt, looks like the maw of Jonah's whale. Beach
shorts and flirtatious sunglasses just aren't going
to cut it anymore. Guess we can't dismiss the world's
masses with a wave of the hand after June 12. Yep,
the Bastille has been nuked to bits.
It can be argued that, despite everything I have
said, it is hardly the sin of sins to weave a few
fables if it helps the absurdity of life seem that
much more distant. And, yes, if there is to be any

modicum of credibility to our diplomas, most of us
will by this time have learned to tell the difference
between our generalizations and the reality of the
world they purport to dispense with in such short
order.
I just worry sometimes that one day, when we're
jogging down the primrose path, life will finally
catch up with us. We'll find ourselves sitting in
bars, nursing nasty vodkas, wondering why the
Stanford years were the best of our lives.
And that, my friends, if it gets beyond the level
of passing fancy, will be the sickest generality of
the lot.

Frank Lester is a senior who will graduate Sunday
with a degree in political science.
