# An 'A' for Mom: Sons graduate with parent
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
If two's company — three's a
celebration.
While most proud parents will
be beaming in the grandstand as
their children receive their Stan
ford diplomas, 53-year-old Bar
bara Kelly will be on the field,
celebrating with her two sons.
In 1953, after her sophomore
year, Barbara Kelly married her
Stanford sweetheart, Paul Kelly,
and stopped out of school to sup
port her new husband. While he
graduated with the class of '56,
she waited to take her turn with
the class of '88 alongside her sons,
seniors Brendan and John Kelly.
Although they have since
divorced, Paul Kelly returned
Barbara's 25-year-old favor and
paid for all of her tuition.
Brendan Kelly, an engineering
mtyor, who is 17 months older
than John Kelly, a political sci
ence mfyor, stopped out for a year
the summer before his senior year
to travel through the South
Pacific and earn his glider pilot's
license. This one-year hiatus gave
John Kelly the opportunity to
catch up to his brother.
And when their mother learned
that her two sons would receive
diplomas on the same day, she
joined in on the fun.
"I had been always planning
eventually to go back and finish
. . . but I did not realize it (grad
uating with my sons) was going
to work," Barbara Kelly says. She
had 25 units to complete, which
she spread over two quarters,
before graduation.
But her trip to a diploma meant
a lot of hard work. Leaving her
home and job in Seattle, Wash.,
Barbara Kelly re-enrolled at Start
ford this fall and took the maxi
mum unit load — 20 units in the
American Studies Department.
Although she had been taking
couses on and off at Washington
University, because of financial
constraints Barbara Kelly knew
she would have to complete all
the units in one quarter to earn
her Stanford degree in American
studies.
"I was scared to death the first
month," she confesses. "But I
knew I had to do it in one quarter

because of my work and home."
Barbara was not the only Kelly
who had some doubts about her
undertaking. "I was concerned for
her," Brendan Kelly admits. She
had been out for 34 years. ... It
could have been a real disappoint
ment" if she couldn't complete
the work.
But with meticulous study
habits that few students here
could match, Barbara Kelly
proved that her 34-year break
from academia had not lessened
her determination to do well. Ac
cording to her sons, she would
type the notes she had taken dur
ing lecture. She often reread
books from her courses two or
three times and never missed a
lecture.
"I would read and write until
I just dropped," Barbara Kelly
says."I treasured every day and
just could not imagine cutting a
class."
And Mom's study habits set
quite an example for her sons. "It
was inspiring. . .. She made us

appreciate this place more," John
Kelly says.
Although Barbara Kelly spent
most of her time as a bookworm,
she did find time to meet other
undergraduates, and some of her
new-found friends already knew
her sons.
"My girlfriend was taking two
classes with my mom," John Kelly
says.
According to Brendan Kelly,
"random people" would inform
him that "they had a research
paper or debate team" with his
mother. "Then I saw my mom in
a different light," he says.
In fact, the two quickly learned
to accept their mom as a fellow
student — and not as a parent
figure.
"She never made us dinner, and
she told us that she was not going
to type our papers," Brendan
Kelly says.
Fall was a whirlwind quarter
for the Kelly trio. While Barbara
Kelly was busy with a heavy
course load, both her sons were

cast members in "Gaieties," a mu
sical comedy traditionally held
before Big Game. In addition,
Brendan Kelly was this year's
Tree, the Stanford Band's mascot,
and John Kelly was cramming for
law school examinations.
When winter quarter rolled
around and her sons' schedules
eased up a bit, Barbara Kelly's
life became even more hectic. She
had returned to Seattle and to
her job as a legal secretary but
flew down to Stanford every Tues
day to complete her last class, an
American Studies seminar.
Barbara Kelly praised her em
ployer, who is also a Stanford
graduate, for being encouraging
and understanding throughout
the undertaking. "I am very lucky
to have him for a boss," she says.
"He has not hung up his diploma
(in the office); he is waiting for
me to have mine."
Aside from her employer, Bar
bara Kelly's sons say she is also
grateful to her ex-husband for his
support.

"There has been a true effort
to do a lot of good together," John
Kelly says about his father's ges
ture in paying for her tuition.
"Dad knew it was important to
finish things. He is very proud of
the fact that he could [help]," ac
cording to Brendan Kelly, who
predicted that his father would
be "crying as much as anyone"
at the graduation celebration.
And what a celebration it will
be. Brendan and John Kelly are
the fourth generation in Barbara
Kelly's family to graduate from
Stanford. Their great grandfather
was once the chair of the English
Department and all their great

uncles and aunts attended Stan
ford.
"There's going to be a big family
reunion in Palo Alto," Brendan
Kelly says, adding that all three
Kellys would receive their
diplomas at the American Studies
ceremony so that relatives would
not have to split up among dif
ferent departments.
For Barbara Kelly, these family
ties are what have made Stanford
and going back for the degree spe
cial.
"The biggest thrill returning
was just walking into the Inner
Quad, looking and realizing that
so much of my family had been
there before," she says.
