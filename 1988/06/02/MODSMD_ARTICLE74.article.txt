# Senior's plan to STOP drunk driving is working
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Editorial staff 
As an active member of his fra
ternity, senior Charlie Ahern had
certainly been exposed to alcohol.
Yet he never seriously reflected
upon the effects of drinking out
side the party environment until
his two sisters — in separate in
cidents — were badly injured in
accidents involving alcohol.
It was then, in August of 1986,
that Ahern, graduating Sunday in
history, recognized a need to
prevent drinking and driving on
an institutional level.
"There had been a couple of
nights when I've driven when I
shouldn't have driven," says
Ahern, who is a member of the
Reserve Officer Training Corp in
addition to being this year's pres

ident of Sigma Chi.
After "throwing around some
ideas" about how to prevent
drinking and driving, Ahern ap
proached Officer of Judicial Af
fairs Sally Cole with his ideas.
Ahern's discussions with Cole,
and later on with Fraternal Af
fairs Adviser Joe Pisano, cul
minated in the Stanford Students'
Safe Transportation Program, or
STOP, a student-run and -op
erated volunteer outfit that pro
vides rides home from bars or
parties for students unable to
safely drive themselves.
"I was terribly enthused about
it," Cole says."It fits in so well
with our institutional enthusiasm
of students helping other stu
dents."
Cole adds that the proposal
came just after the University had

decided that drunk driving was a
violation of University rules as
well as state law. "There was an
increase in arrest reports of drunk
driving on campus," she says.
Cole says that since the admin
istration began considering drunk
driving a University offense in
1985, at least six cases of drunk
driving have been brought before
the Judicial Council annually.
But this year, 1987-88, markes
the first time since then that no
drunk driving case came before
the council.
"Now, people know about
STOP and use it," she says.
While Ahern credits Pisano
with offering valuable advice
about advertising, funding and of
fice space, Pisano maintains that
STOP — which Pisano says
started on a "shoestring" budget

until it won its first fee assess
ment in 1987 — has succeeded
largely as a result of Ahern's "ded
ication, sincerity and complete
soundness of his idea."
"It made you wonder why no
one had thought of it before.
[Charlie] not only conceived of it
but was willing to put it together,"
Pisano says.
Indeed, according to both Ahern
and Pisano, the program seems
to be unique among universities
throughout the nation.
While he plans on attending law
school next fall at either UCLA
or Harvard, Ahern will spend the
summer at Stanford promoting
STOP to other institutions
nationwide via a mass mailing of
a general information packet on
the program.
"Obviously not every campus

has an environment conducive to
this," he says, explaining that the
spread-out nature of the Stanford
campus in relation to where
people drink (in Palo Alto, for
example) made it ideal for such
a program.
"We're in the forefront of this.
It's pretty neat," says Ahern, who
won the Dean's Service last fall
in addition to the Balfour Award
in April for the most outstanding
Sigma Chi in the Northern Cali
fornia province, which encom
passes about nine other schools.
Ahern is currently a finalist for
a national Sigma Chi award.
Despite the criticism fraterni
ties here have received regarding
their policies on alcohol, Ahern
says his membership in Sigma Chi
facilitated initiation of the pro
gram.

"It was really easy talking to
the guys in the house," he says.
"You had an organized group
right there."
Sophomore Tigger May, who
has volunteered for STOP, says
the organization is "a way for the
fraternal system to show that
drinking and driving is a concern
of [the Greek system]. Because
alcohol and the Greek system
seem to go together, the Greek
system is aware of the negative
aspects of alcohol maybe even
more than people in the dorms."
Ahern says the continuity and
collective nature of fraternities
and sororities are what make
them so useful to the program,
although he added that he wishes
to expand the volunteer pool to
persons outside of the Greek sys
tem next year.
