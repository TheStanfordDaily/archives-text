# Class of 1988 boasts five consecutive Daily editors in chief
## 
### 
The Class of 1988 has
a lock on the editorship
of The Stanford Daily.
Since the summer of
1986, four class mem
bers have held the posi
tion of editor in chief,
and this week, yet an
other will take over for

a half-year term. The
five gained no course
credit for their work —
no one at The Daily does
— because the company
is independent of Stan
ford University. But
they managed to learn a
bit anyway.
