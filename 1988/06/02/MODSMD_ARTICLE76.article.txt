At first blush,
staying up until
the wee hours of
the morning and
editing a newspa
per, while school
books linger un
touched at home
on a dusty shelf,
may not seem a

highly profitable way to get a
Stanford education. But like so
many Daily colleagues and
predecessors over the paper's 95-
year history, I found during my
first week as a freshman that the
college experience means much
more than books, exams and
classes.
The team of students that has
produced The Daily over the past
four years has worked incredibly
hard, often against tight deadlines

and against long odds. Sometimes
we failed, but most often we
succeeded delightfully. Most im
portantly, in the process, I think,
we gained something that made
our experiences at Stanford infi
nitely richer than those of stu
dents who never look beyond the
classroom,
In addition to reading more
than our required shares of Plato,
Austen and Nietzsche, we also in
terviewed football coaches, grilled
University administrators, ques
tioned fellow students and, hope
fully, contributed to a better
informed and higher-quality com
munity. For me, this range of ex
perience has contributed to an in
describably wonderful Stanford
career. I think we learned to
gether how to spend our time
profitably and to find fulfillment
in more than one aspect of life
— an ability I hope we will take
with us long after our Stanford
days are over.
