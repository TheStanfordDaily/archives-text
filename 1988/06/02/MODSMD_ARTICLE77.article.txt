When I was
editor of The
Daily last spring,
there was a lot of
big news: Stan
ford celebrated its
centennial; the
Ronald Reagan
Library pulled up
stakes and began

looking elsewhere; the Western
Culture debate intensified; former
President Jimmy Carter and Sec
retary of State George Shultz both
spoke on campus; the baseball and
women's tennis teams won NCAA
titles.
But my memories of these
stories are blurry and incomplete,
as if I watched them through the
window of a speeding train. I
guess in many ways I did; The
Daily is like that sometimes.
Other times, though, it isn't so
hectic. 1 remember once in par
ticular; it was the Friday of Cor
nerstone Weekend, and it seemed
like everyone on campus had
migrated to the Quad for the fes
tivities marking the beginning of
the celebration.
Everybody, that is, except me
and a few others who "held down
the fort" here at The Daily. Well,
after a few minutes of this we
started to get restless.
