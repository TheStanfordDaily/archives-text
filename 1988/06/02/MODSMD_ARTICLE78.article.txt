If there's one
thing I've picked
up at The Daily
over the past four
years, it's been an
appetite for the
unexpected. As a
cautious fresh
man, fond of
making lists and

planning ahead, I was initially ter
rified by the chaotic hustle and
bustle of the Daily's newsroom.
These people, I thought, are crazy.
Then I became one of them.
The hours were hellish and the
work routinely frustrating. But
still I came back for more.
Part of what's made life at The
Daily so delightfully unpredicta
ble has been the fact that every
issue is the collective, albeit some
times contentious, effort of over
100 very different people.
So much of what we do as stu
dents — from studying to job hun
ting — we do for ourselves. The
Stanford experience stresses in
dividualism, not teamwork. Un
fortunately, that bluebook oath,
"No unauthorized help given or
received," applies to more than
just final exams.
The Daily, however, is one place

on campus where cooperation is
a way of life. Putting out a paper
every day would be impossible if
stubborn writers, demanding
editors and free-spirited photog
raphers didn't find ways to work
together. The Daily has taught
me how to rely on others, as well
as on myself.
I'll get my degree from Stanford
University, but I've gotten my ed
ucation at The Stanford Daily.
