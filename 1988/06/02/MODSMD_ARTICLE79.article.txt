"Why don't you
write for The Dai
ly?" I asked a
friend who
wanted to become
a journalist.
"It's too in
timidating," she
said.
"Is not," I said.

"I bet you couldn't do it," she
retorted.
I took the bet, but only on the
condition that she join The Daily
with me.
We did — it was the first week
of spring quarter our sophomore
year. I never intended to stay with
The Daily. But like so many of
our staff. I was hooked.
Working at The Daily is far
more interesting than attending
classes. It's great to know the
news before anyone else does. It's
even better to know news that is
too sensational to print. The
newsroom atmosphere — the fast
pace, the team spirit of people
working under deadline — is ex
hilarating. No lecture at Stanford
compares.
And nowhere could I have
learned more — about my
strengths and weaknesses, my
values, my school and my com
munity.

Intimidating? Sure, damn in
timidating. It's intimidating when
you have only minutes to decide
whether to run an important
story, even though it might hurt
somebody. It's intimidating to
field questions from 20 angry
members of a political faction who
believe the paper mischarac
terized their group. It's intimidat
ing to put your name on an article
and know you have to be able to
back up every assertion.

That intimidation forces you to
learn. I learned to trust myself,
and those who worked for me. I
learned to be true to myself. I
learned that in a business, you
have to treat your stafT like people
first and employees second. I
learned that a newspaper,
likewise, has to treat newsmakers
like people instead of symbols,
considering their feelings while
covering them.
My successes and my many mis
takes at The Daily have helped
me grow. I couldn't have asked
for a better "accidental" educa
tion. I'm glad I took that bet.
