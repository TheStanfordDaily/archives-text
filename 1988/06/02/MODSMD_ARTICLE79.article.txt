"Why don't you
write for The Dai
ly?" I asked a
friend who
wanted to become
a journalist.
"It's too in
timidating," she
said.
"Is not," I said.

"I bet you couldn't do it," she
retorted.
I took the bet, but only on the
condition that she join The Daily
with me.
We did — it was the first week
of spring quarter our sophomore
year. I never intended to stay with
The Daily. But like so many of
our staff. I was hooked.
Working at The Daily is far
more interesting than attending
classes. It's great to know the
news before anyone else does. It's
even better to know news that is
too sensational to print. The
newsroom atmosphere — the fast
pace, the team spirit of people
working under deadline — is ex
hilarating. No lecture at Stanford
compares.
And nowhere could I have
learned more — about my
strengths and weaknesses, my
values, my school and my com
munity.
