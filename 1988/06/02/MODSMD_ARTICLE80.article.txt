I feel rather
awkward discuss
ing the most im
portant lesson
The Daily has
taught me be
cause I have an
overwhelming
fear that my big
gest lessons still

lie ahead. However, I do know
that learning how best to manage
people will be at the crux of any
future discoveries.
When I took the job of manag
ing editor last February, I worried
that my style was rusty, that I
wasn't a good enough writer, and
that I might not like the job.
Managing people was certainly
not what I thought was going to
top my worries after day one.
But how do you tell peers,
friends whom you respect tremen
dously, that they are doing a less
than adequate job? How do you
explain to people assertively, but
not rudely, that they have to try
harder, give more time and do a
better job?
How do you explain it a third
time to the same person? Why
didn't the message get across the
first two times?
I've learned a tremendous
amount so far, but check back in
six months — I'll have more
pearls of wisdom to offer.
