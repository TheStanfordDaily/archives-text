# Wedding bells sound for Stanford sweethearts
## 
### Pia Ali-Salaam Senior staff writer 
Senior JefT Colen gave senior
Judy Koong a real surprise at her
birthday party two weeks ago. He
delivered a cake that read, "Will
you marry me?"
Matt Ehlan, a senior at San
Jose State, got down on bended
knee in front of Memorial Church
during the Viennese Ball, pulled
a ring from his tuxedo jacket
pocket, and in a more traditional
manner asked senior Anamary
Smith the same question.
Jim Chestnut, a Stanford grad
uate, popped the question to
senior Karin Fahlman last sum
mer. According to her roommate,
senior Monica Van Campen, who
is also engaged, Karin's response
was to burst out laughing.
After the laughter subsided,
though, Karin, like the rest of the
women in this story, said "Yes."
In this modern day of careers,
condo buying, traveling the world
and writing novels — all before
getting married — getting en
gaged while still in college, at least
at Stanford, is an anamoly.
In fact, through the highly ef
ficient research method of word
of mouth, The Daily discovered a
total of 15 seniors who are en
gaged to be married. That
represents about 1 percent of the
senior class.
Though the number is low,
seniors, both those engaged and
those not, were surprised that
there were even this many, as
their responses revealed.

While most parents
and friends from
home supported
these students' en
gagements, the re
sponse from Stanford
students was
shocked,' according
to most couples.

"What are they thinking?" said
senior Enrique Alvarez.
"Marriage is death," declared
senior Annie Tillery.
Senior Michelle Oshima, who is
engaged to Michael Burke, a 1987
graduate, said, "There was such
a strong reaction from our friends
that we thought no one else was
getting married."
"I didn't know there were that
many," said Kym Croft, a senior
engaged to fellow class member
Tim Miller. "We should have
started a support group."
A support group might not be
a bad idea. For while most parents
and friends from home supported
these students engagements, most
Stanford students — even those
who were expecting their friends
to one day get married — were
"shocked," according to most cou
ples.
Anna Mary Smith said that
while her parents thought it"was

great I was getting married be
cause they think I'm too wild,"
her Stanford friends think she's
too young.
Smith attributes this attitude
to the fact that Stanford students
"are very career-oriented."
However, some students do not
see marriage as a hindrance to
their careers or education. As of
winter quarter 1988, there were
21 married undergraduate cou
ples living in University housing,
according to the Housing Office.
That number stays relatively con
stant.
So, the only thing constant is
change. Stanford students in the
pursuit of happiness are getting
engaged and giving up those
swinging single days.
Some are in more of a rush
than others. Senior Brook Thom
son, engaged to sophomore Jenny
Erickson, will miss Commence
ment exercises to attend his wed
ding in Utah.
The future looks bright for
Brook and Jenny. They have al
ready survived a test many rela
tionships fail: the overseas exper
ience.
Brook sent postcards to Jenny
every day he was in Europe last
fall. When he returned, he asked
Jenny to string together the first
letter of every postcard. And what
it spelled out was a marriage pro
posal.
Other couples are not getting
married quite as soon as Brook
and Jenny, but instead, are savor
ing their engagement, waiting a
while before they tie the knot.

Seniors Kim Thomason and
John Kunstle found that though
their "anti-marriage friends were
still in shock at their engagement,
most were surprised at their long
engagement." Kim and John, en
gaged since October 1987, will not
marry until June 1991.
Couples with shorter engage
ments usually have known each
other a long time, sometimes even
years, before they promise their
hands in marriage.
Senior Lisa Weinstock met 1987
graduate Mark Weinrich when
she was a freshman. "He was a
hasher in Stern," said Lisa. "Later
we were in a Chinese philosophy

class together. Then we started
running together."
Three years after they met
Mark asked Lisa to marry him.
In a horsedrawn carriage, on Feb
ruary 13, Mark gave Lisa a locket
which read "Will you marry me?"
He was unable to wait 24 hours
for Valentine's Day.
And some people, not as tradi
tionally romantic, took a more
sporting approach to their future.
John Kunstle asked Kim
Thomason to marry him during
the Stanford-UCLA football game
"when we were losing 40-0," ac
cording to Thomason.
Tim Miller, after the Big Game,

popped the question to Kym
Croft. After the Stanford-Cal
match, the two went out dinner
with some friends and followed
that up with a romantic stroll on
the dish.
"Before the walk I told Kym,
'If you think I'm going to propose
to you before we do anything ro
mantic, you'll be disappointed,' "
said Tim. But Kym was not dis
appointed on this occasion, and
she accepted his marriage offer.
Kym was left with one nagging
question, though. Would Tim
have asked her if Stanford had
lost Big Game? According to Tim,
"Of course."


While Brook Thomson and Jenny Erlckson, right, code love In the mall, Tim Miller and Kym Croft
found the "support."

Though Stanford football may not have benefited from the toss, John Kunstle and Kim Thomason
are planning their very own kick-off.
