# Profiles in struggle: Stanford's minority students
## 
### 
These are a few of the
faces at Stanford who
have sought to pro
mote a new American per
spective, one that will rec
ognize the many faces of its
citizens, in all colors, reli
gions and sexual prefer
ences.
Over the last four years,
as in the past, Stanford's
minority communities have
struggled to introduce this
perspective. The voices of
the black, Chicano, gay and
lesbian, Native American,
Jewish and Asian-American
communities are now some
of the most influential —
and the most hoarse — at
Stanford.
The work of these groups
is the combination of the
efforts of individuals like
the graduates on these
pages.
Because of the diversity
of each community, the
portraits here could never

hope to paint a complete pic
ture of each group.
Indeed, many minority
students from at Stanford
will find no representative
among these six.
However, their individual
experiences here provide in
sight into important aspects
of minority life at Stanford.
The University Commit
tee on Minority Issues,
formed one year ago, re
cently released a prelimi
nary report on minority life
at Stanford. Its grim results
were "predictable" to some
members of the Stanford
community, "shocking" to
many others.
The struggle to improve
minority life at Stanford is
really just beginning.
But these students, often
lost as individuals in the
larger picture of protest, are
the leaders, the spirit and
the cnutches of their organ
izations now.
