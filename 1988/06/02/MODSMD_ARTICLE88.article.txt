# Asian-American student pushes for action
## 
### Susan McKean Senior staff writer 
When a Vietnamese worker at
Stanford was fired in an action
that many believed was unfair,
members of Stanford's Asian-
American Student Association
decided to do something about it.
Spurred on by AASA Presi
dent Fidelia Butt, AASA mem
bers interviewed the worker and
consequently pressured the Uni
versity with numerous letters
and a petition calling for
Quach's reinstatement with
back pay.
Only a month after the stu
dents began their efforts, the
University unexpectedly rehired
Quach in another capacity. "We
didn't get him his job back, but
the administration heard the
student voice," said Butt, who
is graduating with a double
major in biology and music.
For Butt, who has led AASA
since the beginning of this school
year, the University's change of
heart says something about the

growing power of the Asian-
American community at Stan
ford.
Butt says she has seen signif
icant growth in AASA since she
became involved with the group
as a freshman. At that time the
group's general meetings drew
only five members on average,
but today at least 35 of the
group's 70 active members come
to each meeting. On paper, the
organization boasts more than
200 members.
By improving recruitment,
running meetings more effi
ciently and delegating
responsibilities to more mem
bers, Butt has reestablished
AASA as a viable student organ
ization, according to junior
Derick Lin, this year's AASA
vice president.
Butt, who is mild and unas
suming in person, has vigorously
contributed to the growing sig
nificance of AASA on campus.
After leading AASA through a
year of transition and restruc
turing, Butt says she feels con

fident that she is leaving a
healthy organization to next
year's leaders.
Many of Butt's co-workers in
AASA agree. AASA members
praise her strong dedication to

the group, as well as her organ
izational skills and ability to
work with others. "[Butt] is al
ways very busy, but always un
der control," Lin says. "She is
always there when she is
needed."
Aside from increasing its
membership, AASA under
Butt's leadership has made
strides this year in convincing
Stanford to provide it with more
support from within the Univer
sity superstructure.
This fall marked the opening
of a new Asian-American Activ
ities Center in the Old Union
Clubhouse as well as the es
tablishment of a dean of Asian-
American affairs. Both of these
developments have been
"tremendously helpful" in
strengthening the Asian-
American community and im
proving its communication with
the administration, Butt says.
Although the group has be
come more active on campus,
