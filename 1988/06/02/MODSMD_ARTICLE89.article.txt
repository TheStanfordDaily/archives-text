# Preserving her identity: One Jewish student's quest
## 
### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
Four years ago, a freshman who is Jewish
might have had a harder time maintaining
a strong religious identity at Stanford than
today.
Because it was dominated by graduate
students, Hillel, Stanford's Jewish student
organization, scared away many would-be
undergraduate members, who were left
without a center for their Jewish student
community.
It was just the situation Fredrica Smith
line feared she might encounter when she
arrived at Stanford as a freshman.
Smithline, who is largely responsible for
revitalizing the undergraduate Jewish com
munity at Stanford over the past four
years, says she was afraid of losing her
Jewish identity on the West Coast where
Jewish communities have not been as
strong traditionally as they are in the East.
Before college, "I lived in a very Jewish
community and I knew Stanford wasn't
one," says Smithline, who is from Stam
ford, Conn.

"From the mo

the moment I went
to bed I was aware
that I was Jewish,"
she says."I didn't
want to lose that."
After sizing things
up at Stanford,
Smithline says she
found the situation

"pretty grim. I didn't see very many op
portunities to be religiously fulfilled."
Disappointed but undaunted, Smithline
decided that the logical starting place was
at the Jewish student center. "From then
on I was determined to make an impact
and increase involvement in Hillel," says
Smithline, who is graduating with a B.S.
in biology Sunday.
Trying to "drag" her Jewish dormmates
to the center was the beginning.
Largely due to her efforts, the member
ship has jumped tremendously in the or
ganization Smithline calls the "intellectual,
social and religious outlet for Jewish stu-
