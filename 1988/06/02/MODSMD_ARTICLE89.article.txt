# Preserving her identity: One Jewish student's quest
## 
### Glen Tripp Senior staff writer 
Four years ago, a freshman who is Jewish
might have had a harder time maintaining
a strong religious identity at Stanford than
today.
Because it was dominated by graduate
students, Hillel, Stanford's Jewish student
organization, scared away many would-be
undergraduate members, who were left
without a center for their Jewish student
community.
It was just the situation Fredrica Smith
line feared she might encounter when she
arrived at Stanford as a freshman.
Smithline, who is largely responsible for
revitalizing the undergraduate Jewish com
munity at Stanford over the past four
years, says she was afraid of losing her
Jewish identity on the West Coast where
Jewish communities have not been as
strong traditionally as they are in the East.
Before college, "I lived in a very Jewish
community and I knew Stanford wasn't
one," says Smithline, who is from Stam
ford, Conn.

"From the mo
ment I woke up to
the moment I went
to bed I was aware
that I was Jewish,"
she says."I didn't
want to lose that."
After sizing things
up at Stanford,
Smithline says she
found the situation

"pretty grim. I didn't see very many op
portunities to be religiously fulfilled."
Disappointed but undaunted, Smithline
decided that the logical starting place was
at the Jewish student center. "From then
on I was determined to make an impact
and increase involvement in Hillel," says
Smithline, who is graduating with a B.S.
in biology Sunday.
Trying to "drag" her Jewish dormmates
to the center was the beginning.
Largely due to her efforts, the member
ship has jumped tremendously in the or
ganization Smithline calls the "intellectual,
social and religious outlet for Jewish stu-


Smithline
dents" at Stanford.
With only a few dedicated
leaders four years ago, Hillel now
has a core of 35-40 "very in
volved" students. The Hillel mem
bership roster has jumped to
nearly 1,000 students, making it
one of the largest organizations
on campus.
"She brings people in with her
warmth," says Hillel Program Di
rector Jocelyn Reisman. "There
is more of an undergraduate focus
now."
Since freshman year, Smithline
has been elected to Hillel's council

of presidents twice and continues
to be involved in many unofficial
events.
For instance, Smithline says
that for two years in a row she
has invited her dormmates in the
French House to join in lighting
Hanukkah candles during the
holiday season.
Glenn Starkman, a graduate
student in physics who was a Hil
lel council of presidents member
last year with Smithline, says she
is "a lot of fun to work with."
"She's always bubbly, always
full of energy fand she] gets things
done when she says she will," he
says.
From the start, one of Smith
line's goals for Hillel has been to
provide a place that "makes it a

little bit easier to be Jewish."
"Hillel is a sort of surrogate
mother," Smithline said, adding
that a family atmosphere is an
important part of Judaism. "It's
hard to be Jewish alone in your
dorm room."
This is especially true consid
ering Stanford's low Jewish pop
ulation. According to Reisman,
there are 1,500 Jewish students
among Stanford's 12,000 stu
dents. This is a low 10.2 percent,
compared to 30 to 40 percent at
many Eastern schools.
However, the University has re
cently become "much more recep
tive to Jewish concerns," Reisman
said.
Through talks with University
President Donald Kennedy and

other University officials, Smith
line helped convince the Univer
sity to change the dates of fresh
man orientation so it would no
longer conflict with the Jewish
holidays — either Yom Kippur or
Rosh Hashanah — that have fal
len on those dates.
Another example of the Univer
sity's increased responsiveness to
Jewish concerns is this year's es
tablishment of a kitchen on
campus where Jewish students
may maintain their Kosher eating
habits.
Now, she says,"the energy of
the group has become much more
inspiring."
"My involvement has reinforced
my commitment to my religion. I
have not lost my Jewish identity."
