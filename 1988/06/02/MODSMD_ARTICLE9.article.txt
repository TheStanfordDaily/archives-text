# Forum faults minority life here
## 
### Eric Richardson Staff writer 
Adding a new concern to the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues' interim report, mem
bers of Stanford's black, Latino,
Native American and Asian-
American communities have told
members of the UCMI that the
quality of minority life at Stanford
does not live up to expectations
of "an environment where minor
ities can really be comfortable."
Hoping to receive feedback from
the 15 students and staff who
attended an open forum Tuesday,
UCMI Chair A 1 Camarillo and
members of the UCMI spent
much of the forum explaining the
response of Stanford minority
communities to last week's in
terim report. One of the new
items that the committee now has
on its agenda is a concern, echoed
by students at the forum, that
Stanford presents "unrealistic ex
pectations" to incoming students
about the quality of minority life
at the University, Cama
rillo said.
Opinions voiced at the forum
suggested that publications like
"Approaching Stanford" — which
incoming freshmen receive the
summer before they arrive at the
University — give minority stu
dents an inaccurate impression of
minority life at Stanford. Minor
ities think "of coming here and
finding an environment where
they can really be comfortable in
diversity," which is misleading,
according to Camarillo.
Over the past two weeks, UCMI
members have met with represen
tatives of Stanford minority com
munities to discuss the report,
Camarillo said. Complaints
generated from these meetings
centered on five aspects of student
life at Stanford.
The five complaints, which
Camarillo said were repeated
"over and over again," focused on:
• Professors presenting insensi
tive attitudes in the classroom;
• Stereotypical treatment of mi
norities by support staff in Uni
versity offices;
• Inadequate financial aid to
minority students;
