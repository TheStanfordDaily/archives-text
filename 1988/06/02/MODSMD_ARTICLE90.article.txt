# Gay and lesbian leader: spirited activist
## 
### Kay Devgan 
When Barb Voss took her required
Western Culture course at Stanford
freshman year, she was shocked to
discover that her lecturer entirely dis
counted both the theory that Virginia
Woolf was a lesbian â€” and the validity
of homosexuality in general.
"I was appalled," says Voss, who
confronted him after class. "He
denigrated everything that was part
of [Woolfs purported] homosexual
background. It angered me and made
me aware of the prejudiced attitudes
that exist about homosexuals."
It also inspired Voss to become in
volved with Stanford's gay community
and other campus activists.
Since that point three years ago,
very few incidents of discrimination
of any sort have escaped her notice.
After "coming out" in the middle
of her freshman year, Voss, a senior
in anthropology with a concentration
in archaeology, became involved with
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford in the fall of her junior year.
Voss, who is taking her degree after

only three years, says her involvement
with the gay community here has
helped both to break down her own
stereotypes and to build positive
feelings about her own sexuality. In
the meantime, Voss has also become
a force for change and progress in
Stanford's gay community in the
short period of her involvement.
According to sophomore Elizabeth
Howton, who is also a GLAS member,
the gay community and the Stanford
community in general would be "sig
nificantly behind if it wasn't for
[Voss'] strong activism."
In her three years at Stanford, Voss
has invested time and energy in a
variety of areas. Currently co
managing Stanford's recycling center,
she also has participated in the Task
Force to review the Area One Western
Culture requirement, the People's
Platform of the Rainbow Agenda,
protests on Stanford's investments in
South Africa and the fight for in
creased sensitivity about the needs of
gay people at Stanford.
One of her most important contri
butions, however, was her work to

form the Stanford Organization for
Lesbian and Gay Equality. SOLGE,
formed in May 1987 as separate from
GLAS, was created "to deed with the
political needs on campus, locally and
nationally of gay communities, and to
cooperate with other political organi
zations on campus," according to


Barb Voss
