# Gay and lesbian leader: spirited activist
## 
### Kay Devgan 
When Barb Voss took her required
Western Culture course at Stanford
freshman year, she was shocked to
discover that her lecturer entirely dis
counted both the theory that Virginia
Woolf was a lesbian — and the validity
of homosexuality in general.
"I was appalled," says Voss, who
confronted him after class. "He
denigrated everything that was part
of [Woolfs purported] homosexual
background. It angered me and made
me aware of the prejudiced attitudes
that exist about homosexuals."
It also inspired Voss to become in
volved with Stanford's gay community
and other campus activists.
Since that point three years ago,
very few incidents of discrimination
of any sort have escaped her notice.
After "coming out" in the middle
of her freshman year, Voss, a senior
in anthropology with a concentration
in archaeology, became involved with
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stan
ford in the fall of her junior year.
Voss, who is taking her degree after

only three years, says her involvement
with the gay community here has
helped both to break down her own
stereotypes and to build positive
feelings about her own sexuality. In
the meantime, Voss has also become
a force for change and progress in
Stanford's gay community in the
short period of her involvement.
According to sophomore Elizabeth
Howton, who is also a GLAS member,
the gay community and the Stanford
community in general would be "sig
nificantly behind if it wasn't for
[Voss'] strong activism."
In her three years at Stanford, Voss
has invested time and energy in a
variety of areas. Currently co
managing Stanford's recycling center,
she also has participated in the Task
Force to review the Area One Western
Culture requirement, the People's
Platform of the Rainbow Agenda,
protests on Stanford's investments in
South Africa and the fight for in
creased sensitivity about the needs of
gay people at Stanford.
One of her most important contri
butions, however, was her work to

form the Stanford Organization for
Lesbian and Gay Equality. SOLGE,
formed in May 1987 as separate from
GLAS, was created "to deed with the
political needs on campus, locally and
nationally of gay communities, and to
cooperate with other political organi
zations on campus," according to


Barb Voss
Voss,
"It was important to form
SOLGE," she says, "because in
the past, when GLAS tried to
make political statements, many
members didn't agree with them.
It was a source of alienation for
some members, but now SOLGE
is available to make political state
ments and GLAS is primarily a
social, support network."
Many of the gay community's
most significant advances in
recent years have been the result
of SOLGE's activism and coopera
tion with other student activists
groups on campus.
Among other things, SOLGE
has demanded changes in Stan
ford policies such as increased
visibility of gay resident assistants
and changing married student
housing to provide equal housing
opportunities for gay couples and
single mothers. SOLGE has also
sought to prevent the Career
Planning and Placement Center
from allowing employers who dis
criminate against homosexuals —
such as the military and the gov
ernment — to recruit on campus.
In order to educate the com
munity about gay issues, SOLGE

also runs a Gay and Lesbian
Speakers Bureau, which routinely
sends groups of students to dor
mitories to discuss issues related
to homosexuality.
According to senior Daniel Bao,
who is also an activist in the gay
community, "When you want
something done, you go talk to
Barb. A lot of the work that she's
done and the time that she's put
in will come to flourish soon."
While Voss says more work
needs to be done to create honest,
clear communication between the
administration and student
groups on campus, she still feels
that she has had a positive exper
ience with GLAS. "Through
GLAS, I have gained more confi
dence in knowing who I am, what
I stand for and what I believe in,"
she says.
Voss says the organization
needs to grow to continue to rep
resent the growing diversity of its
members — to answer the differ
ing needs of lesbians and gay men
of all races.
"The only way that the gay
community at Stanford will sur
vive," Voss says, "is working in
coalition with other student
groups on campus — our oppres
sion is not isolated. No oppression
is isolated. We all have to work
together to build solidarity."
