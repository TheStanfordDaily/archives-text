# Chicano organizer: a voice of renewal
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
When Gina Hernandez first came to
Stanford as a freshman in 1984, one of
the first things she noticed was the lack
of a broad social, political and cultural
organization for Chicano students.
Refusing to accept this deficiency, she
had an idea about how to change it.
In winter quarter of her sophomore
year, Hernandez and a few other stu
dents resurrected the Movimiento Es
tudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, commonly
known as MEChA. The organization —
though it has had its latent periods —
has been active at Stanford for about
20 years.
Since the renewal, the organization
has grown from a handful of dedicated
students to a strong force on campus
with over 30 members regularly attend
ing meetings, and Hernandez has been
a stalwart member.
Hernandez, a history concen
trating in American history, is one of
seven children born to Mexican-
American parents from East Los An
geles. Although neither of her parents
went to college, both Hernandez and
her oldest sister have attended Stan

ford.
Hernandez was raised in Whittier, a
suburb of Los Angeles, where she at
tended what she calls "a mainstream,
suburb high school." Looking back on
her days in high school, she can re
member counselors telling her, "up un
til the day (she] got her letter (of ac
ceptance)," that if she wanted to go to
Stanford she had to be involved in ex
tracurricular activities because she is
Chicana. "It upset me and I didn't know
why," Hernandez says, adding that she
now sees that attitude was a form of
institutional racism.
When she first arrived at Stanford,
Hernandez says she felt similar tension.
Many Chicano students, according to
Hernandez, sensed "that things were a
little bit discriminatory or unfair but
that [they] just had to stick together
and keep our chins up." Changing the
conditions that produce such feelings is
the main reason Hernandez says she
became involved in MEChA.
In her four years at Stanford, Her
nandez says she has seen the Chicano
community become much more active
and vocal. "People are realizing the dif
ferent limitations that [ChicanosJ are
under at Stanford and other places,

wanting to do something about that
and recognizing that they actually can
do something."
However, before MEChA regrouped
three years ago, it was more difficult
