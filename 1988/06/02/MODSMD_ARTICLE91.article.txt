# Chicano organizer: a voice of renewal
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
When Gina Hernandez first came to
Stanford as a freshman in 1984, one of
the first things she noticed was the lack
of a broad social, political and cultural
organization for Chicano students.
Refusing to accept this deficiency, she
had an idea about how to change it.
In winter quarter of her sophomore
year, Hernandez and a few other stu
dents resurrected the Movimiento Es
tudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, commonly
known as MEChA. The organization —
though it has had its latent periods —
has been active at Stanford for about
20 years.
Since the renewal, the organization
has grown from a handful of dedicated
students to a strong force on campus
with over 30 members regularly attend
ing meetings, and Hernandez has been
a stalwart member.
Hernandez, a history concen
trating in American history, is one of
seven children born to Mexican-
American parents from East Los An
geles. Although neither of her parents
went to college, both Hernandez and
her oldest sister have attended Stan

ford.
Hernandez was raised in Whittier, a
suburb of Los Angeles, where she at
tended what she calls "a mainstream,
suburb high school." Looking back on
her days in high school, she can re
member counselors telling her, "up un
til the day (she] got her letter (of ac
ceptance)," that if she wanted to go to
Stanford she had to be involved in ex
tracurricular activities because she is
Chicana. "It upset me and I didn't know
why," Hernandez says, adding that she
now sees that attitude was a form of
institutional racism.
When she first arrived at Stanford,
Hernandez says she felt similar tension.
Many Chicano students, according to
Hernandez, sensed "that things were a
little bit discriminatory or unfair but
that [they] just had to stick together
and keep our chins up." Changing the
conditions that produce such feelings is
the main reason Hernandez says she
became involved in MEChA.
In her four years at Stanford, Her
nandez says she has seen the Chicano
community become much more active
and vocal. "People are realizing the dif
ferent limitations that [ChicanosJ are
under at Stanford and other places,

wanting to do something about that
and recognizing that they actually can
do something."
However, before MEChA regrouped
three years ago, it was more difficult


Glna Hernandez
says.
One of the results of minority
demands last year was the forma
tion of a University committee
charged with evaluating the
quality of minority life at Stan
ford. Hernandez, who has worked
with the University Committee on
Minority Issues before it released
its first report this spring, says
the initial findings are "ironic and
a little bit frustrating."
According to her, the committee
has uncovered concerns which mi
nority students have been voicing
for years. However, if students
remain persistent in pressing the
University for action, the results
could be "promising," she says.
The fact that it has taken the
University so long to recognize
that problems exist for minority
students here is an indicator of
how difficult it can be to promote
change at Stanford, Hernandez
says.
One of the best ways for Stan
ford to become more responsive
to minority students, Hernandez
says, is by increasing the numbers
of minority faculty, by
strengthening recruitment of mi
nority students and by adding
courses which deal with minority
issues.
"The majority of people at this
University aren't recognizing the
contributions of minorities in this
country, which makes [minority]
students feel that what they have

for students to voice their con
cerns to the University.
For instance, a mtyor contro
versy arose four years ago over
whether theme houses — such as
the Chicano theme house Casa
Zapata — have a valid place at
Stanford.
Hernandez, who lived in the
black theme house Ujamaa her
freshman and sophomore years,
says the issue sensitized people
to numerous other concerns
voiced by campus minority
groups.
"Uncovering that small issue at
the beginning uncovered a lot of
bigger issues that people are ex
periencing — a lot of racism on
campus that comes out most
against black students, but is still
felt by a lot of other minorities."
However, recently there has
been an increased effort by mi
nority students to "take respon
sibility for their education and the
education that Stanford pro
vides," says Hernandez, who adds
that this has been the most re
warding development in her time
working with the Chicano com
munity. The idea that minority
students "have something impor
tant to say about their education"
has grown tremendously, she

to contribute isn't worth much,"
she says.
"A lot of what we're not taught
is what leads us to feeling inferior
.. . and feeling like we don't have
a right to be here," Hernandez
says.
Unfortunately, minority stu
dents spend a great deal of time
and energy educuating people,
something the University should
be doing itself, according to Her
nandez.
Increasing the number of mi
nority faculty would mark prog
ress, Hernandez says. "If you see
that there are hundreds of faculty
and the majority of them are
white male and there's only four
or so that are of your race, it
doesn't give you incentive that
you're even supposed to be striv
ing for those kinds of goals."
Besides numerical increases in
minority faculty and minority
classes, the most important thing
minority students need from the
University is support in combat
ting ignorance and racism on
campus.
Hernandez, who through her
mayor has studied the history of
the Chicano community in the
United States, would like to be a
Chicano Studies professor herself
and plans to apply to the doctoral
program in ethnic studies at
either UC-Berkeley or UCLA this
fall.
Hernandez says she might like

to return to Stanford someday to
develop the first Chicano Studies
program at Stanford. "We
definitely need one here," she
says.
Junior Marc Pizarro, who has
known Hernandez for 2Vi years,
calls her "one of the hardest work
ing members of MEChA that [he]
has ever worked with." Hernan
dez is a "really, really powerful
person," he says. "She has a tre
mendous impact on what people
think."
Hernandez demonstrated this
power in an impassioned speech
as one of the announcers for last
month's education conference,
which featured Democratic pres
idential candidate Jesse Jackson.
In the fall of 1986 she was co
coordinator and keynote speaker
at the largest MEChA statewide
conference in history, which drew

'The majority of people at this University
aren't recognizing the contributions of
minorities in this country, which makes
[minority] students feel that what they
have to contribute isn't worth much.'

over 900 people to the Stanford
campus.
Hernandez says she considers
these two statewide conferences
highlights of her four years of
involvement in the Chicano com
munity.
Aside from purely political ac
tivities, Hernandez danced with
Ballet Folklorico, a Mexican dance
group at Stanford, during her first
two years here. The group, which
has more than a 20-year history
here, is "a good way of making
sure our culture gets around the
campus," Hernandez says.
After graduation, Hernandez
says she thinks she will miss the
size and diversity of the Chicano
community as well as the oppor
tunity to see how Stanford will
change as a result of the UCMI'S
work.
Looking back on her first years

here, the hardest things she had
to deal with at Stanford was the
"feeling that maybe [she] couldn't
cut it academically, and the
feeling of not really knowing
where to go for help." She re
members these feelings becoming
so strong at one point in her soph
omore year that she felt she might
just give up and leave.
As a shy, quiet freshman, she
said she viewed herself as a person
who "really didn't have much to
say and [who] wasn't really worth
being taken notice of." Hernandez
considers it one of her greatest
personal triumphs that she has
changed since coming here, to be
come one of the most active and
respected members of the Chicano
community.
"If there's a problem, you call
Gina," says junior Miguel Mar
quez, a member of next year's
Council of Presidents, who has
known Hernandez since his fresh
man year. "Everyone admires her
and respects her opinion."
"Gina won't let herself be
walked over by the administra
tion. She can handle herself at a
meeting with the big wigs and
not be intimidated."
Pizarro agrees that Hernandez
has become a powerful presence
on campus. "Gina's ability and
knowledge of how to get things
done may have increased, but her
fervor for doing things has always
been at a very high level."
