# Native American battles stereotyping

### Nick Anderson Editorial staff 
Senior Lesley Jackson comes from the
Crow Indian Reservation in southern
Montana, an area just under 4,000
square miles in the Big Horn Valley,
population 7,000, the historic site of
the defeat of Colonel George Custer in
1876.
She is proud of her home and her
heritage, but says she was lucky to have
the chance to leave the reservation to
go to high school.
Being able to study at a private board
ing school in the East softened the cul
ture shock that hits many other Native
Americans when they arrive on The
Farm — up until 1972 home of the
"Indian" mascot.
Because the socio-economic strain of
jumping into the often elitist intellec
tual world is so great, the national col
lege drop-out rate for Native Americans
hovers near 50 percent. The Stanford
drop-out rate, which is not officially
calculated, is much better than the na
tional, but still higher than figures for
other ethnic groups here.
But Jackson, who will graduate Sun

day with a bachelor's degree in anthro
pology, refuses to quit, and refuses to
let what he calls Stanford's "completely
inadequate" understanding of Native
Americans encourage others enrolled
here to quit.

Stanford's Native American commu
nity is perhaps the smallest and least
known of all campus ethnic groups, with
about 15 active undergraduate members
in the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization, and another 20 or 30 mem
bers in other Native American organi
zations here.
SAIO has no formal hierarchy, no
chair, no president, and thus far less
visibility than other ethnic groups. De
cisions are made by a council on a con
sensus basis. Even so, Jackson is seen
as both a behind-the-scenes leader and
an outspoken political force.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Larrimore, who works closely with the
Native American community here and
is himself a Comanche, calls Jackson
"one of the most committed and deter
mined people I've ever met." Jackson
has especially been "a driving force in
getting students outside the communi
ty" involved in projects, he says.
One of Jackson's accomplishments —
intended to make Stanford more ac
comodating to Native Americans — was
working successfully with four other
