# Native American battles stereotyping
## 
### Nick Anderson Editorial staff 
Senior Lesley Jackson comes from the
Crow Indian Reservation in southern
Montana, an area just under 4,000
square miles in the Big Horn Valley,
population 7,000, the historic site of
the defeat of Colonel George Custer in
1876.
She is proud of her home and her
heritage, but says she was lucky to have
the chance to leave the reservation to
go to high school.
Being able to study at a private board
ing school in the East softened the cul
ture shock that hits many other Native
Americans when they arrive on The
Farm — up until 1972 home of the
"Indian" mascot.
Because the socio-economic strain of
jumping into the often elitist intellec
tual world is so great, the national col
lege drop-out rate for Native Americans
hovers near 50 percent. The Stanford
drop-out rate, which is not officially
calculated, is much better than the na
tional, but still higher than figures for
other ethnic groups here.
But Jackson, who will graduate Sun

day with a bachelor's degree in anthro
pology, refuses to quit, and refuses to
let what he calls Stanford's "completely
inadequate" understanding of Native
Americans encourage others enrolled
here to quit.

Stanford's Native American commu
nity is perhaps the smallest and least
known of all campus ethnic groups, with
about 15 active undergraduate members
in the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization, and another 20 or 30 mem
bers in other Native American organi
zations here.
SAIO has no formal hierarchy, no
chair, no president, and thus far less
visibility than other ethnic groups. De
cisions are made by a council on a con
sensus basis. Even so, Jackson is seen
as both a behind-the-scenes leader and
an outspoken political force.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Larrimore, who works closely with the
Native American community here and
is himself a Comanche, calls Jackson
"one of the most committed and deter
mined people I've ever met." Jackson
has especially been "a driving force in
getting students outside the communi
ty" involved in projects, he says.
One of Jackson's accomplishments —
intended to make Stanford more ac
comodating to Native Americans — was
working successfully with four other


Lesley Jackson
students last year to establish
Lathrop House as a permanent
theme house for the community
beginning next year.
As a Lathrop resident in this
transition year, Jackson helped
develop the house theme and pro
gramming, which will formally
begin after she leaves.
Finding the right house was a
struggle, she says.
Other houses proposed in the
past for theme status were "dis
asters," says Jackson. Robinson
House in Sterling Quad was a
"priority house" two years ago, a
notch below theme house. Before
that, Roble Hall was the targeted
residence. Both failed, Jackson
says, because they were too large,
making them overwhelming to
the needs of Stanford's small com
munity of Native Americans, few
of whom lived in those residences.
But Lathrop, with just 30 res

idents, is just the right size. "Set
ting up Lathrop has been the most
visible area of progress in the last
four years at Stanford," Jackson
says.
Jackson has also helped organ
ize the Stanford Powwow for each
of the last four years. The Pow
wow, which each May draws a
crowd of 10-15,000 and has a
$30,000 budget, gets no funding
from the University and little
from the ASSU. Yet, somehow
SAIO manages to pull it off,
mainly through selling advertis
ing and soliciting contributions
from departments and residences.
Another of Jackson's quiet jobs
this year was working as a student
representative to a faculty com
mittee on Ethnic Studies. The
committee evaluated the curricu
lum and recommended the es
tablishment of an ethnic studies
class for next year and perhaps
an ethnic studies concentration
within the American Studies
major in later years.
While these areas of progress

are encouraging, Jackson becomes
incensed when discussing the per
petual misunderstandings of Na
tive American life here.
For example, on the outpouring
of alumni sentiment following the
death last March of former Stan
ford Indian mascot Harry Delmar
"Prince Lightfoot" Williams:
"He was just a poor puppet.
[His death] made me wonder what
all the other non-Indian people
who used him as a justification
[for trying to reinstate the old
mascot] are going to do now."
The most insensitive thing
Jackson says she has heard about
during her four years on The
Farm occurred one night a few
weeks ago, when the Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority staged a
"Kappa and Indians" Wild West
dance just outside the Native
American Center at Old Union.
The Kappas have since
apologized; they went to the cen
ter last week to discuss the misun
derstanding with SAIO. Jackson
says she has been impressed with

the effort of the Kappas since the
incident, calling their visit to the
center afterward a "landmark
thing to do" because they took
the initiative to educate them
selves.
But like many Native Ameri
cans and other minority students
here, Jackson says she is tired of
shouldering the whole responsi
bility of educating others about
her culture. "The level of absurd
ity gets so extreme," she says.
"No matter what you do, some
people will not change."
Larrimore says he shares Jack
son's frustration.
Jackson's post-graduation
plans are still up in the air, but
she says she may teach or practice
law in the near future. Studying
anthropology here appealed to her
in particular, she says, because
traditionally Native Americans
have been studied and lectured
about by people of other ethnic
backgrounds. "Indian culture
needs to be looked at from an
Indian perspective," Jackson says.

One of Jackson's accomplishments —
intended to make Stanford more ac
comodating to Native Americans — was
working successfully with four other


Lesley Jackson
students last year to establish
Lathrop House as a permanent
theme house for the community
beginning next year.
As a Lathrop resident in this
transition year, Jackson helped
develop the house theme and pro
gramming, which will formally
begin after she leaves.
Finding the right house was a
struggle, she says.
Other houses proposed in the
past for theme status were "dis
asters," says Jackson. Robinson
House in Sterling Quad was a
"priority house" two years ago, a
notch below theme house. Before
that, Roble Hall was the targeted
residence. Both failed, Jackson
says, because they were too large,
making them overwhelming to
the needs of Stanford's small com
munity of Native Americans, few
of whom lived in those residences.
But Lathrop, with just 30 res

idents, is just the right size. "Set
ting up Lathrop has been the most
visible area of progress in the last
four years at Stanford," Jackson
says.
Jackson has also helped organ
ize the Stanford Powwow for each
of the last four years. The Pow
wow, which each May draws a
crowd of 10-15,000 and has a
$30,000 budget, gets no funding
from the University and little
from the ASSU. Yet, somehow
SAIO manages to pull it off,
mainly through selling advertis
ing and soliciting contributions
from departments and residences.
Another of Jackson's quiet jobs
this year was working as a student
representative to a faculty com
mittee on Ethnic Studies. The
committee evaluated the curricu
lum and recommended the es
tablishment of an ethnic studies
class for next year and perhaps
an ethnic studies concentration
within the American Studies
major in later years.
While these areas of progress

are encouraging, Jackson becomes
incensed when discussing the per
petual misunderstandings of Na
tive American life here.
For example, on the outpouring
of alumni sentiment following the
death last March of former Stan
ford Indian mascot Harry Delmar
"Prince Lightfoot" Williams:
"He was just a poor puppet.
[His death] made me wonder what
all the other non-Indian people
who used him as a justification
[for trying to reinstate the old
mascot] are going to do now."
The most insensitive thing
Jackson says she has heard about
during her four years on The
Farm occurred one night a few
weeks ago, when the Kappa
Kappa Gamma sorority staged a
"Kappa and Indians" Wild West
dance just outside the Native
American Center at Old Union.
The Kappas have since
apologized; they went to the cen
ter last week to discuss the misun
derstanding with SAIO. Jackson
says she has been impressed with

the effort of the Kappas since the
incident, calling their visit to the
center afterward a "landmark
thing to do" because they took
the initiative to educate them
selves.
But like many Native Ameri
cans and other minority students
here, Jackson says she is tired of
shouldering the whole responsi
bility of educating others about
her culture. "The level of absurd
ity gets so extreme," she says.
"No matter what you do, some
people will not change."
Larrimore says he shares Jack
son's frustration.
Jackson's post-graduation
plans are still up in the air, but
she says she may teach or practice
law in the near future. Studying
anthropology here appealed to her
in particular, she says, because
traditionally Native Americans
have been studied and lectured
about by people of other ethnic
backgrounds. "Indian culture
needs to be looked at from an
Indian perspective," Jackson says.
Senior Lesley Jackson comes from the
Crow Indian Reservation in southern
Montana, an area just under 4,000
square miles in the Big Horn Valley,
population 7,000, the historic site of
the defeat of Colonel George Custer in
1876.
She is proud of her home and her
heritage, but says she was lucky to have
the chance to leave the reservation to
go to high school.
Being able to study at a private board
ing school in the East softened the cul
ture shock that hits many other Native
Americans when they arrive on The
Farm — up until 1972 home of the
"Indian" mascot.
Because the socio-economic strain of
jumping into the often elitist intellec
tual world is so great, the national col
lege drop-out rate for Native Americans
hovers near 50 percent. The Stanford
drop-out rate, which is not officially
calculated, is much better than the na
tional, but still higher than figures for
other ethnic groups here.
But Jackson, who will graduate Sun

day with a bachelor's degree in anthro
pology, refuses to quit, and refuses to
let what he calls Stanford's "completely
inadequate" understanding of Native
Americans encourage others enrolled
here to quit.

Stanford's Native American commu
nity is perhaps the smallest and least
known of all campus ethnic groups, with
about 15 active undergraduate members
in the Stanford American Indian Or
ganization, and another 20 or 30 mem
bers in other Native American organi
zations here.
SAIO has no formal hierarchy, no
chair, no president, and thus far less
visibility than other ethnic groups. De
cisions are made by a council on a con
sensus basis. Even so, Jackson is seen
as both a behind-the-scenes leader and
an outspoken political force.
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Larrimore, who works closely with the
Native American community here and
is himself a Comanche, calls Jackson
"one of the most committed and deter
mined people I've ever met." Jackson
has especially been "a driving force in
getting students outside the communi
ty" involved in projects, he says.
