# Vivacious black leader reaches out to educate

"All Stanford minorities should grad
uate with two degrees — one in their
major, and one in education," says grad
uating senior Mwenda Kudumu. "That's
because they spend so much time telling
people what it is that they are."
Kudumu, a vibrant member of the
black community, says too much of her
time at Stanford has gone to educating
other students about her perspective as
a minority.
The biology major, who has a keen
interest in marine biology, says she feels
the University should be responsible for
administering this sort of cross- cultural
education, and minority students should
not "have to be somebody's educational
experience."
Nonetheless, education is very impor
tant to Kudumu, who is this year's pres
ident of the Delta Sigma Thetas, one of
two black sororities at Stanford. And
the public service work she has done
with the Deltas shows that.
Kudumu has devoted much of her
time to the Shule program in East Palo
Alto, a network of three small indepen
dent schools that focus specially on
meeting the educational needs of minor
ity students.
Because of her interests in science,
Kudumu has helped bolster the school's
science program. With the help of the
ASSU and the biology department here,
six microscopes and approximately
$2700 were donated to Shule this year.
Ignorance is something that upsets
the independent-minded senior, and she
has strong feelings about the insensitiv
ity to minorities she has seen at Stan
ford, particularly in view of a pair of
incidents this spring that she believes
were racially insulting. In both of these
incidents, and in general, Kudumu
refuses to accept students' claims of ig
norance as an excuse for their actions.
" 'I just didn't mean it' and 'I didn't
know' are not valid excuses," she says.
"Hiding behind ignorance — it's ridic
ulous. The information is right in your
face," she says.
For example, resources like Ujamaa,
the Afro-American theme house, provide
an "opportunity to get to know a cul
ture," as do the cultural and information
programs sponsored by the Black Stu
dent Union, Kudumu says.

Though she feels strongly that non
black students need to make efforts to
get to know black culture, Kudumu ac
knowledges that some people are in
timidated by events that are sponsored
by the black community and attended
by mostly black students. But this is no
excuse either, she says.
"People don't think about how in
timidating it is for a black person to
come to Stanford, or to sit in class and
be the only black person," she says,
adding that mutual "consciousness" is
needed to enable students to get to know
each other more easily.
But Kudumu remembers that intim
idation, particularly in what she calls
her worst Stanford experience — fulfill
ing the controversial Western Culture
requirement.
As a child, Kudumu was schooled in
Swahili and African history in an inde
pendent summer school run by her
mother, and for her the Western Culture
program was difficult — to say the least.
"The only thing they teach you in
that class is that Egyptians are not
black, that Egypt is only an extension
of Greece and that Greece made all the
contributions," says Kudumu, whose
Swahili name means "beloved."
Since that year, she has spent much
energy working for the recently passed
Cultures, Ideas and Values legislation,
