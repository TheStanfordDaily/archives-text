# Vivacious black leader reaches out to educate
##

"All Stanford minorities should grad
uate with two degrees — one in their
major, and one in education," says grad
uating senior Mwenda Kudumu. "That's
because they spend so much time telling
people what it is that they are."
Kudumu, a vibrant member of the
black community, says too much of her
time at Stanford has gone to educating
other students about her perspective as
a minority.
The biology major, who has a keen
interest in marine biology, says she feels
the University should be responsible for
administering this sort of cross- cultural
education, and minority students should
not "have to be somebody's educational
experience."
Nonetheless, education is very impor
tant to Kudumu, who is this year's pres
ident of the Delta Sigma Thetas, one of
two black sororities at Stanford. And
the public service work she has done
with the Deltas shows that.
Kudumu has devoted much of her
time to the Shule program in East Palo
Alto, a network of three small indepen
dent schools that focus specially on
meeting the educational needs of minor
ity students.
Because of her interests in science,
Kudumu has helped bolster the school's
science program. With the help of the
ASSU and the biology department here,
six microscopes and approximately
$2700 were donated to Shule this year.
Ignorance is something that upsets
the independent-minded senior, and she
has strong feelings about the insensitiv
ity to minorities she has seen at Stan
ford, particularly in view of a pair of
incidents this spring that she believes
were racially insulting. In both of these
incidents, and in general, Kudumu
refuses to accept students' claims of ig
norance as an excuse for their actions.
" 'I just didn't mean it' and 'I didn't
know' are not valid excuses," she says.
"Hiding behind ignorance — it's ridic
ulous. The information is right in your
face," she says.
For example, resources like Ujamaa,
the Afro-American theme house, provide
an "opportunity to get to know a cul
ture," as do the cultural and information
programs sponsored by the Black Stu
dent Union, Kudumu says.

Though she feels strongly that non
black students need to make efforts to
get to know black culture, Kudumu ac
knowledges that some people are in
timidated by events that are sponsored
by the black community and attended
by mostly black students. But this is no
excuse either, she says.
"People don't think about how in
timidating it is for a black person to
come to Stanford, or to sit in class and
be the only black person," she says,
adding that mutual "consciousness" is
needed to enable students to get to know
each other more easily.
But Kudumu remembers that intim
idation, particularly in what she calls
her worst Stanford experience — fulfill
ing the controversial Western Culture
requirement.
As a child, Kudumu was schooled in
Swahili and African history in an inde
pendent summer school run by her
mother, and for her the Western Culture
program was difficult — to say the least.
"The only thing they teach you in
that class is that Egyptians are not
black, that Egypt is only an extension
of Greece and that Greece made all the
contributions," says Kudumu, whose
Swahili name means "beloved."
Since that year, she has spent much
energy working for the recently passed
Cultures, Ideas and Values legislation,

which may counter some of the
alienation felt by minorities at
Stanford. The victory not only
brought a tremendous feeling of
pride to Kudumu, who says she
felt deeply that the battle, in a
certain sense, was "her fight." It
also brought that same feeling of
accomplishment to the Black Stu
dent Union.
"Now that we (the BSU) have
won something, we'll have the
strength to fight harder the next
time," she says. "There is a light
at the end of the tunnel now."
Kudumu says she believes that
the BSU has "come into its own"
in recent months, and says that
the high number of upperclass
men who joined the 20-year-old
organization this year are proof
of that.
In Kudumu's eyes, the future
looks even better because of the
many freshmen who have become
committed to the BSU. "The
people here did the footwork, and
now the freshmen are just run
ning with it."

An active member of the BSU,
Kudumu says the organization is
constantly making itself a better
support system for black stu
dents. This year's Friday "chill
outs," weekly lunchtime breaks
in White Plaza, were one way the
organization has tried to encour
age students to "enjoy the com
munity," and not just "get to
gether over something controver
sial."
Kudumu praised this year's
BSU chair Bill King for his relent
less devotion to the black com
munity, shown in his active lob
bying for the CIV proposal.
"The black community here is
a family," says Kudumu, who ad
mits that she "needed her friends
to keep it cool," for her.
Kumudu says she looks to Stan
ford's black students to "pay back
into" the community by doing
something to "move blacks
ahead."
The Stanford senior also says
she has a "real problem" with
black students who come to Stan
ford and feel they "made it on
their own."
This is not the case "by any
means," she says. "Somebody had
to die for [blacks] to get here."

And Kudumu says she wants
to make it easier for others to
make it here too. Public service
is one way the three-year Delta
member hopes black students will
help the community. The black
Greek fraternal system, commit
ted to public service and "brot
herhood and sisterhood," has
been an outlet for Kudumu and
her desire to help other people.
Kudumu says she is proud of
her 18-member sorority, and
believes they work hard to avoid
elitism by not separating them
selves from the rest of the black
community.
"We are the community," she
says.
In the last four years, divisions
between blacks who belong to a
fraternities or sororities and those
who do not have substantially
decreased, according to Kudumu.
The image of elitism seen a few
years ago is fading, she says. "We
are more together because of
criticism," she says. "We con
stantly check each other to be
sure the right direction — the
direction of the community as a
whole — is there."
Kudumu has found many ways
to be a part of that direction.

Along with her leadership skills
go talents in art and dancing.
A two-year member of the
Kuumba dance troupe and an avid
social dancer, Kudumu is thank
ful for the "dancing, the music,
and the good times — it kept me
sane."
The oldest of five children,
Kudumu's many activities take a
lot of time, and she says her
boundless energy is hereditary.
"'Go' is the middle name in our
family, when you say it,
everybody's eyes light up."
With plans to spend the sum
mer at Hopkins Marine Station,
Kudumu says she then hopes to
work for a few years before doing
graduate work in marine biology.
Pointing to the fact that people
often call Stanford students "the
leaders of the world," Kudumu
says she is not sure whether she
wants such a leadership role.
But while she plans to make a
career of marine biology research,
Kudumu says she does hope stu
dents of all races will work toward
understanding each other.
"Life is learning," she says.
"Stanford is not all candy and it's
not all gloom. It's a lot of what
you make of it."
