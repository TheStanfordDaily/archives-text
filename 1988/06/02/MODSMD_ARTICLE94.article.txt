Nick Anderson

As a news editor and news
writer at The Daily who was in
timately involved with the front
page all year, I am often asked
why The Daily covers the things
it does, and why it covers them
the way it does. Sometimes "crit
icized" is a more apt description
than "asked."
The above are valid questions.
I'd like to offer some answers.
In response to the fourth ques
tion. . .
The sources for our front-page
news are relatively few. Minority
groups, dorms, police, fraternities,
the United Stanford Workers, the

Faculty Senate, the student gov
ernment and the University ad
ministration supply the bulk of
our information. From that small
pool, we come up with a high
number of stories, which always
have a new angle to them.
In general, we cover a few
stories a lot in order to flesh them
out. You probably got tired of
reading about the Western Cul
ture debate or the NCAA drug
testing case, but The Daily would
have done a disservice to its
readers if it let those stories sit
unwatched until a final decision
was made.
Besides, newspapers are identi
fied by the ongoing stories they
choose to carry from day to day.
In that regard, The Daily is no
different from any other paper
because it covers certain ongoing
Stanford stories.
For the third question —
We cover minorities often be
cause they make news. News, of
course, means something new, an
obvious but oft-forgotten distinc
tion. These groups challenge the

status quo, and for that they
deserve coverage.
Take the word "racism," which
has been bandied about often on
campus these days. It's a chal
lenging word. People are afraid of
it; it takes guts to call it like you
see it. As a journalist, I'll cover
that word whenever it comes up
— and always look for substan
tiation, of course.
If the campus is sick of seeing
the word "racism" in The Daily,
or of seeing the affairs of minority
groups covered in such detail,
then it has probably become
desensitized to these important is
sues. That's terrible.
Question No. 2 —
Fraternities, likewise, are seen
as a favorite whipping boy of the
paper. They are, however, a con
troversial group, often in turmoil,
viewed with skepticism by much
of the community and watched
closely by the University admin
istration. So we cover them. We've
tried to give them a fair shake
with a special beat writer who
came to know their point of view.

Another word of explanation.
Both fraternities and minority
groups — an odd couple indeed
to mention in the same breath —
complain that we only cover the
"negative" and not the "positive"
on the front page.
It is a fact of journalism every
where, though, that hard news is
often sad, bitter or controversial.
Protests, raised fists, wins and
losses are the stuff of all front
pages.
We try to separate news and
features into different depart
ments. By "news" I mean, for ex
ample, coverage of protests and
by "features," coverage of com
munity developments. However,
that is not to imply that all news
is negative or all features positive.
But often the positive develop
ments of these groups are treated
in depth in features that either
jump off the front page or merit
an entire page inside the paper.
Finally, to answer the first
question — the charge of sen
sationalism. We cover change at
The Daily, and we try to cover it

sensitively.
Headline size, story placement
and story assigning aJI determine
the proportionality of events. In
selecting all these variables every
day, news editors become a pow
erful force shaping events and
community perceptions of them.
A banner headline for a story au
tomatically gives it a legitimacy
in the community that it might
never have otherwise, and may
very well make a few people irate.
These decisions have to be made
each night, without fail. There is
no such thing as selecting two
lead stories because none was im
portant enough to display prom
inently.
The news is instinctual. Some
times our instincts fall short of
the mark. Sometimes things are
out of proportion.
Sensationalism is a serious
charge, but the paper can accept
the criticism.
However, if students are angry
that the paper gets so excited
about change, then I have to ask
whether the students want

change, or whether they just want
to keep sailing on the good ship
Stanford.
This campus is too damn status
quo.

Nick Anderson is a senior who
will graduate Sunday with a
degree in English.
