## Exceeding his expectations After 4 years running over Bears, Muster to become one 
### Susan Slusser Senior staff writer 
In August 1983, a freshman run
ning back named Brad Muster ar
rived on the Stanford campus for
fall practice.
He didn't attract much attention.
The lanky Novato (Ca.) native stood
6-foot-2 but weighed only 185 pounds
and was not highly touted coming
out of a San Marin high school in a
small conference.
Stanford had a number of running
backs who were thought to be the
future of the Cardinal that year.
Kaulana Park was a junior, Kevin
Scott and Brian Morris were sopho
mores and both freshmen Marshall
Dillard and Thomas Henley played
extensively in 1983.
"I came here hoping to play as a
fifth-year senior and maybe start,"
Muster says.
"Marshall Dillard and Thomas
Henley were going to be the stars,"
Morris says. "Brad was playing on
the scout team. Nobody even noticed
him."
The next year, Stanford running
back coach Jimmy Walsh put Muster
on a weight training program to in
crease his size and durability ("It
wasn't very fun," Muster says) and
discussed a possible position change
with the second-year back because
of the plethora of talented runners
on the Stanford squad.

"There was no doubt about Brad's
athletic ability," Walsh says."It was
just a matter of where we wanted
to play him."
According to Walsh, Muster could
have played in the defensive second
ary "without a doubt" and also could
have handled outside linebacker,
wide receiver and tight end.
It might have been hard to believe
then, but four years later and over
40 pounds heavier, Muster has be
come the unquestioned star of the
Stanford offense for three years and
the object of close scrutiny by the
National Football League.
"He has what people look for," Los
Angeles Raiders scout Ron Wolf says.
"He has a great ability to catch the
ball and a knack for hitting the open
spot on the line.
"Everyone in this business is
trying to get good football players,
but they're a rare breed," Wolf says.
"Brad is among them."
On April 24, the Chicago Bears
acquired this rare breed of player
when they selected Muster with the
23rd pick in the first round of the
NFL draft. Muster will follow in the
footsteps of one of his idols, Walter
Payton, as a Bear running back.
"I feel happy that I'm going to the
Bears," Muster says. "They're a
great team. My family is a big Bear
family. My mom (Loretta) is from
Chicago, and I've always loved the
Bears. That's why I'm so excited."

It's been a spring of big days for
Muster. A month after being chosen
by the Bears, on May 28, Brad
married his long-time girlfriend,
Vicki Chiamparino, in Novato.
Muster first received national at
tention playing against the Bears —
the California Golden Bears, that is
— rushing for an incredible 204
yards on 34 carries in the 1984 Big
Game. Fittingly, Muster capped off
his career with another outstanding
performance against Cal, gaining 90
yards and one touchdown on 22
carries and catching seven passes for
56 yards in the 1987 Big Game.
Not that there weren't plenty of
highlights in between. In the 1986-87
season, Muster rushed for 1,053
yards and caught 61 passes while
leading the Cardinal to the Gator
Bowl. In the process, he was named
Pacific 10 Conference Offensive
Player of the Year and made numer
ous All-America teams. Muster was
also named to the conference all
academic team for the second
straight year.
At the beginning of the 1987-88
season, Muster was considered a can
didate for the Heisman Trophy, but
missed five games with an ankle in
jury suffered on the first day of fall
practice.
"It's kind of frustrating," Muster
says."I wanted to improve as a
