# At 'winnin' time,' Kay Tittle plays tall
## 
### Ken Stevens Senior staff writer 
Standing only 5-feet, 3-inches
tall, Kay Tittle has been the
shortest player on the Stanford
women'd tennis team for the past
four seasons. But each May at
the NCAA team championships,
the senior from Irving, Texas, was
nothing short of a giant.
For when it came to "winnin'
time," as Magic Johnson calls the
postseason, Tittle was winnin'
with regularity, and as a result,
the Cardinal women were winnin'
championship trophies in 1986,
1987 and 1988.
Playing on teams that have in
cluded Stanford tennis greats
such as Linda Gates, Patty Fen
dick and Lisa Green, Tittle easily
could have been overshadowed
during her Stanford career.
But every time something big
was happening at the nationals,
Tittle seemed to be the one oc
cupying center stage. Tittle, who
is graduating Sunday with a B.A.
in international relations, will not
play any more competitive tennis.
Yet, her mind will probably never
wander far from the game, and
the trail of successes she has had
at Stanford.
In the 1986 championships in

Austin, Texas, the local girl made
good in the final against USC.
With the Cardinal leading 3-2, the
only singles match still being
played was on Court 5, where
Tittle and the Trojans' Ginny
Purdy were engaged in a three-set
battle.
Both teams crowded the adja
cent courts to watch the end of
this tremendously important
match. If Tittle won, Stanford
would lead 4-2 and USC would
have to sweep the doubles match
es. If Purdy won, the Trojans
would pull even and have the mo
mentum when the doubles began.
Tittle abandoned the baseline
in the third set, and her aggres
sive net game netted her a 6-3,
3-6, 6-4 victory. The Cardinal
went on to dethrone the defending
champs 5-4.
A year later in Los Angeles,
Tittle once again provided one of
the most memorable moments of
the NCAA tournament. In the
quarterfinals against the home
town UCLA Bruins, the Cardinal
led 4-1. The entire stadium
watched as Tittle attempted to
close out the match by defeating
UCLA's Allyson Cooper.
It was a classic David vs.
Goliath confrontation, as the tal
ler and bigger Cooper towered

over Tittle. Confronted with
Cooper's arsenal of powerful
groundstrokes, Tittle didn't
budge an inch. She matched her
opponent shot-for-shot, outslug
ging the Bruin junior and giving
Stanford the team victory.
Just over a month ago, Tittle
again displayed her NCAA tour
nament prowess in Los Angeles
at the 1988 team championships.
After losing in the quarterfinal
match against Georgia (her first
loss in four years of play at the
team championships), Tittle came
back with a vengeance, winning
in straight sets in the semifinals
and finals.
"The two weeks at nationals
were the best I've seen her play,"
said Caryn Copeland, assistant
coach for the women's tennis
team.
Tittle's success was a by
product of her tremendous com
petitiveness and her will to over
come injuries to both knees. "Her
knees just aren't meant to be
doing the pounding," Copeland
said.
Tittle has played with pain in
her knees since she was 16, but
the pain escalated last year, forc
ing her to undergo arthroscopic
surgery on both knees last
Thanksgiving. "After Thanksgiv

ing, when I had them both scoped,
I was pretty discouraged," she
said. "I really wasn't sure how
things would turn out."
But Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan's motto for Kay Tittle
turned out to be correct again. At
one point this season, Brennan
said of Tittle, "If she can walk,
she can play. And if she can play,
she will win."
Even on those days when she
could barely walk this season,
Tittle was usually victorious.
The most vivid example of
Tittle's gutsy character came
April 21 at the Pac-10 Conference
Championships in Ojai. In her
second-round match against Cal
ifornia's Sharon Fletcher, Tittle
was hobbling so badly that at one
point she leaned against the fence
at the side of the court and looked
like she was about to crumble.
Yet, three hours after the start
of the match, she limped off the
court with a 7-6, 6-7, 7-6 victory.
On the season, Tittle won 32
of 37 singles matches. And for
the first time in her Stanford
career, she earned All-America
honors by advancing to the third
round of the NCAA singles tour
nament. "| Being an All-Americanl

years at Stanford, but made a habit of causing opponents pain in
big matches.
was a goal that I had set four years ago,"
said Tittle. "For me, it was really impor
tant."
Despite the team's unparalleled success
during her four years, what Tittle said she
will remember most are the things she and
her teammates did to get pumped up for
big matches — for example, making alli
gator earrings with nooses on them prior
to playing the Florida Gators in this year's
final.
In fostering team unity, Tittle provided
the rallying point. "She was a leader even

when she first came here," said Copeland.
"She's got a lot of spirit. It just sort of
seeps over to everybody else."
Following graduation, Tittle will work
as a tennis instructor at the Stanford Sierra
Camp during the summer. In the fall, she
will be studying with Stanford's program
in Tours, France to finish up the last re
quirement for her international relations
Then, she hopes to attend law school
the following fall.
Competitive tennis is not in the future
for Tittle, who has decided the time has
come to give her knees a long rest. Not
playing tennis is "going to be really tough,"
she said. "It's probably going to drive me
to scream. Tennis has been the focus of
everything for the last 12 years."

everything for the last 12 years."
Standing only 5-feet, 3-inches
tall, Kay Tittle has been the
shortest player on the Stanford
women'd tennis team for the past
four seasons. But each May at
the NCAA team championships,
the senior from Irving, Texas, was
nothing short of a giant.
For when it came to "winnin'
time," as Magic Johnson calls the
postseason, Tittle was winnin'
with regularity, and as a result,
the Cardinal women were winnin'
championship trophies in 1986,
1987 and 1988.
Playing on teams that have in
cluded Stanford tennis greats
such as Linda Gates, Patty Fen
dick and Lisa Green, Tittle easily
could have been overshadowed
during her Stanford career.
But every time something big
was happening at the nationals,
Tittle seemed to be the one oc
cupying center stage. Tittle, who
is graduating Sunday with a B.A.
in international relations, will not
play any more competitive tennis.
Yet, her mind will probably never
wander far from the game, and
the trail of successes she has had
at Stanford.
In the 1986 championships in

Austin, Texas, the local girl made
good in the final against USC.
With the Cardinal leading 3-2, the
only singles match still being
played was on Court 5, where
Tittle and the Trojans' Ginny
Purdy were engaged in a three-set
battle.
Both teams crowded the adja
cent courts to watch the end of
this tremendously important
match. If Tittle won, Stanford
would lead 4-2 and USC would
have to sweep the doubles match
es. If Purdy won, the Trojans
would pull even and have the mo
mentum when the doubles began.
Tittle abandoned the baseline
in the third set, and her aggres
sive net game netted her a 6-3,
3-6, 6-4 victory. The Cardinal
went on to dethrone the defending
champs 5-4.
A year later in Los Angeles,
Tittle once again provided one of
the most memorable moments of
the NCAA tournament. In the
quarterfinals against the home
town UCLA Bruins, the Cardinal
led 4-1. The entire stadium
watched as Tittle attempted to
close out the match by defeating
UCLA's Allyson Cooper.
It was a classic David vs.
Goliath confrontation, as the tal
ler and bigger Cooper towered

over Tittle. Confronted with
Cooper's arsenal of powerful
groundstrokes, Tittle didn't
budge an inch. She matched her
opponent shot-for-shot, outslug
ging the Bruin junior and giving
Stanford the team victory.
Just over a month ago, Tittle
again displayed her NCAA tour
nament prowess in Los Angeles
at the 1988 team championships.
After losing in the quarterfinal
match against Georgia (her first
loss in four years of play at the
team championships), Tittle came
back with a vengeance, winning
in straight sets in the semifinals
and finals.
"The two weeks at nationals
were the best I've seen her play,"
said Caryn Copeland, assistant
coach for the women's tennis
team.
Tittle's success was a by
product of her tremendous com
petitiveness and her will to over
come injuries to both knees. "Her
knees just aren't meant to be
doing the pounding," Copeland
said.
Tittle has played with pain in
her knees since she was 16, but
the pain escalated last year, forc
ing her to undergo arthroscopic
surgery on both knees last
Thanksgiving. "After Thanksgiv

ing, when I had them both scoped,
I was pretty discouraged," she
said. "I really wasn't sure how
things would turn out."
But Stanford Coach Frank
Brennan's motto for Kay Tittle
turned out to be correct again. At
one point this season, Brennan
said of Tittle, "If she can walk,
she can play. And if she can play,
she will win."
Even on those days when she
could barely walk this season,
Tittle was usually victorious.
The most vivid example of
Tittle's gutsy character came
April 21 at the Pac-10 Conference
Championships in Ojai. In her
second-round match against Cal
ifornia's Sharon Fletcher, Tittle
was hobbling so badly that at one
point she leaned against the fence
at the side of the court and looked
like she was about to crumble.
Yet, three hours after the start
of the match, she limped off the
court with a 7-6, 6-7, 7-6 victory.
On the season, Tittle won 32
of 37 singles matches. And for
the first time in her Stanford
career, she earned All-America
honors by advancing to the third
round of the NCAA singles tour
nament. "| Being an All-Americanl

years at Stanford, but made a habit of causing opponents pain in
big matches.
was a goal that I had set four years ago,"
said Tittle. "For me, it was really impor
tant."
Despite the team's unparalleled success
during her four years, what Tittle said she
will remember most are the things she and
her teammates did to get pumped up for
big matches — for example, making alli
gator earrings with nooses on them prior
to playing the Florida Gators in this year's
final.
In fostering team unity, Tittle provided
the rallying point. "She was a leader even

when she first came here," said Copeland.
"She's got a lot of spirit. It just sort of
seeps over to everybody else."
Following graduation, Tittle will work
as a tennis instructor at the Stanford Sierra
Camp during the summer. In the fall, she
will be studying with Stanford's program
in Tours, France to finish up the last re
quirement for her international relations
Then, she hopes to attend law school
the following fall.
Competitive tennis is not in the future
for Tittle, who has decided the time has
come to give her knees a long rest. Not
playing tennis is "going to be really tough,"
she said. "It's probably going to drive me
to scream. Tennis has been the focus of
everything for the last 12 years."
