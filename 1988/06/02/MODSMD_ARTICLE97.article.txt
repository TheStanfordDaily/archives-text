Success in women's golf has been the
standard in the Cornelius family since the
19505, and graduating senior Kay Cor
nelius has been no exception.
Cornelius, who was selected to the Sec

her first collegiate tournament victory and
finished among the top-10 in seven of the
nine tournaments she entered during her
senior campaign. She finished the season

on the tour with Mom and was constantly

surrounded by it (golf)," she said.
"I took my school work on the road with

until fourth grade."
Her mother, Kathy, won the U.S. Open
in 1956.
Kay Cornelius entered her first national
tournament, the U.S. Public Links
Amateur, at age 12. The following year
she won the World Junior title in the 13-
and 14-year-old flight. Then, at the very
young age (for a junior) of 14, she won
the U.S. Junior Championships, beating
the best 18-year-old players in the country.
Cornelius entered Stanford as the co
number one recruit in the nation (along
with Kim Saiki, who went to USC). Until
her recruit trip during February of her
