# Golfing is a family affair for pro hopeful Cornelius
## 
### Win Reis Staff writer 
Success in women's golf has been the
standard in the Cornelius family since the
19505, and graduating senior Kay Cor
nelius has been no exception.
Cornelius, who was selected to the Sec
ond Team All-America this year, picked up
her first collegiate tournament victory and
finished among the top-10 in seven of the
nine tournaments she entered during her
senior campaign. She finished the season
ranked seventh in the nation.
Cornelius, who is graduating with a
degree in sociology, developed most of her
golf skills at a very young age, with help
from her mother, then a touring profes
sional, and her father, a teaching pro. Cor
nelius found it only natural that she
learned to play golf: "I grew up traveling
on the tour with Mom and was constantly

surrounded by it (golf)," she said.
"I took my school work on the road with
me," she added. "I didn't really go to school
until fourth grade."
Her mother, Kathy, won the U.S. Open
in 1956.
Kay Cornelius entered her first national
tournament, the U.S. Public Links
Amateur, at age 12. The following year
she won the World Junior title in the 13-
and 14-year-old flight. Then, at the very
young age (for a junior) of 14, she won
the U.S. Junior Championships, beating
the best 18-year-old players in the country.
Cornelius entered Stanford as the co
number one recruit in the nation (along
with Kim Saiki, who went to USC). Until
her recruit trip during February of her
senior year in high school, a very late time
for such a sought-after player, she had

never seriously considered coming
to the Farm. Originally she was
tending toward playing for Ari
zona or Arizona State and remain
ing closer to her home in Phoenix.
However, as is the case with a
lot of people who are unsure about
attending Stanford, "as soon as I
got here I knew this was where
I wanted to go. I loved the
campus, but more importantly,"
Cornelius said, "I knew the
players well and felt very com
fortable with them."
As is the case with many top
recruits, particularly in their first
year of college, Cornelius fell vic
tim to the pressure she felt was
placed on her. "I think a lot of
that was self-inflicted," she said.
"I had trouble adjusting to trav
eling and studying, and I ended
up worrying about it too much
and not getting anything done."
Once comfortable with the life
style of collegiate golf, however,
Cornelius' play improved. She

with a bang, finishing second at
the University of New Mexico's
Dick McGuire Invitational. Her
solid play throughout her junior
season earned her a preseason All-
America selection this year.
After such a strong year at
Stanford, however, Cornelius be
came frustrated with the lack of
improvement in her play and even
contemplated quitting golf during
the summer before her senior
year. "I was very down on golf at
the time," she said of her difficult
summer. "I knew something was
wrong (with my swing), but every
one around me saw me hit every

day and couldn't figure it out. I
needed a new perspective."
Cornelius got considerable help
from Phil Rodgers, a well-known
teaching pro. He made some dra
matic changes to her swing which,
she feels, will enable her to play
professional golf in the future.
The results speak for them
selves. "She has played solid golf,
just as she has throughout her
entire Stanford career," said a
proud Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin. "Her senior year has
been a great one, and we can only
look for bigger and better things
from her in the future."
Three months ago Cornelius
picked up the first tournament
victory of her collegiate career,
defeating freshman teammate
Jodi Figley on the first hole of
sudden death at the Rainbow In
tercollegiate in Hawaii.
Other outstanding finishes
have been at the Stanford Inter
collegiate last fall, where she
finished third among a field of
more than 15 of this year's Ail-
Americans, and at the Lady Sun
Devil in April, where she opened
with a blistering 68 and finished

one stroke off the winning score.
In addition to having such a
strong final year individually,
Cornelius has also handled the
burden of being the lone senior
on what was a very young and
inexperienced Cardinal golf
squad. She was the team leader
throughout the year and served
as a role model to her younger
teammates.
"I think she's a great team
player," freshman Michele Lyford
said. "She's very supportive of all
of us. Everything about her is
positive."
