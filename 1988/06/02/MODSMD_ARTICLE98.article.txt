# Greg Butler's Farewell Tour is over
## 'The Force,' after four years of antics, will no longer be with Card hoops 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
Alas, with a mixture of sadness, pride and
goofiness, the Greg Butler Farewell tour is
now just a fading memory.'
The Force — as his Cardinal basketball
teammates call him — spent the months of
December through March pulling his careen
ing caravan of chuckles up and down the West
Coast for the final games of his storied career.
And now Butler, the only graduating senior
on the Stanford team, will move on to future
endeavors, either in the NBA, the World Wres
tling Federation or possibly as Larry "Bud"
Mel man's replacement on the David Letter
man Show.
But seriously, folks. . . .
Indeed, it was often hard to take Greg But
ler seriously during his first few years on the
Farm. Befuddled Stanford fans wondered why
the gangly 6-foot-11 blond tower shunned the
inside game and instead fired 15- to 18-foot
jump shots with all the arc of someone spitting
gum.
The answer, of course, was that Butler
usually sank 'em. During his senior year, the
Force moved inside and added a jump-hook
to his arsenal. By the end of the season,
everyone took him seriously.
Butler averaged 12.8 points per game and
5.9 rebounds, and while the media focused
on his junior teammates Todd Lichti and
Howard Wright, opposing coaches were invar
iably concerned about Butler.
Even before Butler's metamorphosis was
complete, however, his tour was an institu
tion. Whenever the team bus pulled into or
out of a city for the last time, one of Butler's
teammates requested a moment of silence to
commemorate that leg of the tour.
"I guess the tour idea started at halftime
of the Arizona State game (at Arizona) when
Greg already had 22 points and was just going
off," teammate Scott Meinert says. "Somebody
said that Greg was starting his final tour with
a vengeance."
The happy-go-lucky Butler doesn't mind the
attention. "We compare it to the Dr. J farewell
tour (last year)," he says."In every town we
wonder what ceremonies they'll have, whether
they'll give me a rocking chair or something.
I'm still waiting."
The Force's storied career is made up of,

Once GB makes his final
bows and finishes eating, he
would like to move on to a
more professional tour...

well, stories. The one his teammates auto
matically remember was not a road trip tale,
but rather a freshman stroll through Meyer
Library.
It seems Butler's frosh buddies dared him
(for an unconfirmed monetary sum) to do his
best imitation of E.T. as a bookworm. So Greg
donned an extraterrestrial mask and one other
slight article of clothing and romped through
the stacks. He collected his dough.
More recently, Butler and his teammate
Stuart Thomas wrought destruction on an
Arizona hotel bed.
"Being the big fan of pro wrestling that I
am, well, one time I was resting when Stu
decided to perform a flying reverse elbow to
the head," Butler says, choosing his words
carefully. "At the last minute I moved and
Stu came down and broke the bed in two. I
pinned him for three."
Those wrestling moves may have helped
Butler in his transformation from bomber to
bruiser. After two years under Coach Tom
Davis, Butler was forced to move inside by
new Coach Mike Montgomery and his staff.
"I wasn't thrilled with (the move). My pro
duction really fell off, and this year could
have been a disaster," Butler says. "But it
has turned out well. I think in the end I'm
better off."
Butler still thinks of himself as primarily
an outside shooter. Every day after practice
he spent 20 minutes practicing his outside
shot. But at the coaches' request, he buckled
down and learned to play with his back to
the basket.
"I really respect what he has done because
it probably wasn't as fun for him," says Eric
Reveno, who is a natural inside player.
Fun is one of Butler's favorite pastimes.
Thomas describes him as a "fun-loving guy"
and Reveno adds that "away from practice
Greg can be the life of the party — he doesn't
mind the attention he gets from being 6-11."

True to form, the Force, who reportedly
got the nickname because Coach Davis was
always yelling "Don't force it, Greg," showed
off one of his many talents at the Apple In
vitational banquet in December.
"It was probably one of the greatest mo
ments of live entertainment in Stanford Uni
versity history," Meinert said. "Somebody
yelled for Greg to sing, and (emcee) Bob
Murphy made the mistake of handing Greg
the mike. He reeled off a couple of stanzas
of 'You Ain't Nothing But A Hound Dog.' It
was incredible."
Even when Butler is asleep, he is a threat
to leave you in stitches.
According to legend, one night Butler, who
admits to walking in his sleep, woke up in
the wee hours and ripped the headboard off
the wall. He then lifted it over his head and
threw it at his traveling roommate, Andy Fis
cher.
"If he hadn't been awake and dodged it, I
would have killed him," Butler says. "You
might want to take some insurance out when
you room with me."
You also might want to hide any food you
have. The Force, whose other nicknames in
clude GB, Gree, G-Force, Gorgeous and G-Bow
(for his lethal elbows), can definitely force
down the chow.
"He used to be better, but he's still quite
an eater," Wright says.
The story goes that in one restaurant on
a road trip in Austin, Texas, the waiter
brought the raw steaks out for the patrons
to choose. Butler chose a two-pounder.
Once GB makes his final farewell bows and
finishes eating, he would like to move on to
a more professional tour, either in Europe or
preferably the NBA.
"I guess Marty Blake (NBA superscout) is
pretty high on my future in the NBA," Butler
says. "That's nice to hear, but I'm just going
to go to camps and work hard this summer."
Butler's chances might be better than some
people think. There are not many 6-11 players
who can shoot that well from the perimeter.
Wright thinks the Force can do it.
"You look at some of the pros in the NBA
and compare, and with the right coach at the
right time with the right team, Greg can make
it."
Seriously folks, Greg Butler in the NBA.
Now that would be a tour.

would have killed him," Butler says. "You
might want to take some insurance out when
you room with me."
You also might want to hide any food you
have. The Force, whose other nicknames in
clude GB, Gree, G-Force, Gorgeous and G-Bow
(for his lethal elbows), can definitely force
down the chow.
"He used to be better, but he's still quite
an eater," Wright says.
The story goes that in one restaurant on
a road trip in Austin, Texas, the waiter
brought the raw steaks out for the patrons
to choose. Butler chose a two-pounder.
Once GB makes his final farewell bows and
finishes eating, he would like to move on to
a more professional tour, either in Europe or
preferably the NBA.
"I guess Marty Blake (NBA superscout) is
pretty high on my future in the NBA," Butler
says. "That's nice to hear, but I'm just going
to go to camps and work hard this summer."
Butler's chances might be better than some
people think. There are not many 6-11 players
who can shoot that well from the perimeter.
Wright thinks the Force can do it.
"You look at some of the pros in the NBA
and compare, and with the right coach at the
right time with the right team, Greg can make
it."
Seriously folks, Greg Butler in the NBA.
Now that would be a tour.

Greg Butler hit from the inside and the outside and jump-hooked
his way into the hearts of Cardinal fans during his senior year.
Alas, with a mixture of sadness, pride and
goofiness, the Greg Butler Farewell tour is
now just a fading memory.'
The Force — as his Cardinal basketball
teammates call him — spent the months of
December through March pulling his careen
ing caravan of chuckles up and down the West
Coast for the final games of his storied career.
And now Butler, the only graduating senior
on the Stanford team, will move on to future
endeavors, either in the NBA, the World Wres
tling Federation or possibly as Larry "Bud"
Mel man's replacement on the David Letter
man Show.
But seriously, folks. . . .
Indeed, it was often hard to take Greg But
ler seriously during his first few years on the
Farm. Befuddled Stanford fans wondered why
the gangly 6-foot-11 blond tower shunned the
inside game and instead fired 15- to 18-foot
jump shots with all the arc of someone spitting
gum.
The answer, of course, was that Butler
usually sank 'em. During his senior year, the
Force moved inside and added a jump-hook
to his arsenal. By the end of the season,
everyone took him seriously.
Butler averaged 12.8 points per game and
5.9 rebounds, and while the media focused
on his junior teammates Todd Lichti and
Howard Wright, opposing coaches were invar
iably concerned about Butler.
Even before Butler's metamorphosis was
complete, however, his tour was an institu
tion. Whenever the team bus pulled into or
out of a city for the last time, one of Butler's
teammates requested a moment of silence to
commemorate that leg of the tour.
"I guess the tour idea started at halftime
of the Arizona State game (at Arizona) when
Greg already had 22 points and was just going
off," teammate Scott Meinert says. "Somebody
said that Greg was starting his final tour with
a vengeance."
The happy-go-lucky Butler doesn't mind the
attention. "We compare it to the Dr. J farewell
tour (last year)," he says."In every town we
wonder what ceremonies they'll have, whether
they'll give me a rocking chair or something.
I'm still waiting."
The Force's storied career is made up of,

bows and finishes eating, he
would like to move on to a
more professional tour...

well, stories. The one his teammates auto
matically remember was not a road trip tale,
but rather a freshman stroll through Meyer
Library.
It seems Butler's frosh buddies dared him
(for an unconfirmed monetary sum) to do his
best imitation of E.T. as a bookworm. So Greg
donned an extraterrestrial mask and one other
slight article of clothing and romped through
the stacks. He collected his dough.
More recently, Butler and his teammate
Stuart Thomas wrought destruction on an
Arizona hotel bed.
"Being the big fan of pro wrestling that I
am, well, one time I was resting when Stu
decided to perform a flying reverse elbow to
the head," Butler says, choosing his words
carefully. "At the last minute I moved and
Stu came down and broke the bed in two. I
pinned him for three."
Those wrestling moves may have helped
Butler in his transformation from bomber to
bruiser. After two years under Coach Tom
Davis, Butler was forced to move inside by
new Coach Mike Montgomery and his staff.
"I wasn't thrilled with (the move). My pro
duction really fell off, and this year could
have been a disaster," Butler says. "But it
has turned out well. I think in the end I'm
better off."
Butler still thinks of himself as primarily
an outside shooter. Every day after practice
he spent 20 minutes practicing his outside
shot. But at the coaches' request, he buckled
down and learned to play with his back to
the basket.
"I really respect what he has done because
it probably wasn't as fun for him," says Eric
Reveno, who is a natural inside player.
Fun is one of Butler's favorite pastimes.
Thomas describes him as a "fun-loving guy"
and Reveno adds that "away from practice
Greg can be the life of the party — he doesn't
mind the attention he gets from being 6-11."

True to form, the Force, who reportedly
got the nickname because Coach Davis was
always yelling "Don't force it, Greg," showed
off one of his many talents at the Apple In
vitational banquet in December.
"It was probably one of the greatest mo
ments of live entertainment in Stanford Uni
versity history," Meinert said. "Somebody
yelled for Greg to sing, and (emcee) Bob
Murphy made the mistake of handing Greg
the mike. He reeled off a couple of stanzas
of 'You Ain't Nothing But A Hound Dog.' It
was incredible."
Even when Butler is asleep, he is a threat
to leave you in stitches.
According to legend, one night Butler, who
admits to walking in his sleep, woke up in
the wee hours and ripped the headboard off
the wall. He then lifted it over his head and
threw it at his traveling roommate, Andy Fis
cher.
"If he hadn't been awake and dodged it, I
would have killed him," Butler says. "You
might want to take some insurance out when
you room with me."
