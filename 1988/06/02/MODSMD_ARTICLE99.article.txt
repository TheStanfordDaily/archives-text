# Four years of champions
## 
### 
In its four years on the Farm, this
year's graduating class has been
treated to one of the most successful
NCAA Division I athletic programs
in the country. Stanford has won 11
national team championships over the
past four years, with last year's four
titles leading the nation.
At the same time, the seniors have
seen the Stanford football program rise
from the depths to win three of the last
four Big Games and in 1986 participate
in the Gator Bowl, its first bowl game
since 1978.

The longest current dynasty belongs
to the women's tennis team. They have
won the last three consecutive NCAA
team crowns, with senior Patty Fendick
also capturing the individual champion
ship in 1986 and 1987.
The men's swim team, led by seniors
Pablo Morales and Jeff Kostoff, rolled
to its third straight team victory last
season. Morales and Kostoff combined
for a whopping 16 individual NCAA titles
in their Cardinal careers.
Coach Dante Dettamanti is building a

dynasty of his own in the Stanford men's
water polo team. Heading into this
season, the group had garnered the last
two NCAA championships.
Stanford men's tennis is currently in
an every-other-year assault on the NCAA
team title. The Cardinal, led by seniors
Dan Goldie and Jim Grabb, dominated
the tournament in 1986 to bring the
championship trophy home to the Farm.
Last year the Cardinal failed to make it
to the NCAA tournament for the first
time since 1982, but the netters
rebounded this year to grab the title and

make it the second Stanford sweep of
collegiate tennis in the last three seasons.
Then, in the crowning achievement of
all, an underdog Cardinal baseball team
traveled to Omaha, Nebraska, last season
for the 1987 College World Series. A
lOth-inning Paul Carey grand slam saved
Stanford from elimination against Lou
isiana State. Then Stanford went on to
crush Oklahoma State, the team that
had kept the Cardinal out of the World
Series the year before, and captured
Stanford's first NCAA baseball champi
onship.
