"Karate is the best
thing I ever did for
my child!"
Mrs. Drnise Watson, San /ose
Although we often receive
comments like Mrs. Watson's, we
continually strive to do even
better because every child
deserves the very best chance at
life. And, we know that our
programs can greatly improve
our students' chances for
happiness and success.
"My son was a real handful. He
wouldn't mind me or his teachers. I'm a
single mother and needed help with him.
Master Mather gave him self discipline
and control. I can't tell you what a
change it's made in his life ... and mine."
Estelle Connor, Santa Clara
"I was already a black belt when I
moved here, so I knew what to look for I
visited every club in the valley. I chose
CKA because they were clearly superior
— there was no comparison."
