# Christopher steps down as top Trustee
## 
### David Cline 
Board of Trustee's President
Warren Christopher will turn over
his position as head of the Uni
versity's 29-member governing
body to the current vice president,
James Gaither, on July 1.
Christopher's decision to relin
quish the board presidency this
year sparked speculation that the
former U.S. deputy secretary of
state would seek appointment to
political office after the national
elections in November.
But Christopher — who helped
mediate the Iran-Hostage Crisis
during the Carter Administration
— explicitly denied that he has
plans "beyond the state of Cali
fornia" in the immediate future.

Christopher said he plans to
complete his five-year term on the
Board of Trustees, which ends in
February, 1991. He has been pres
ident of the Board since 1985 and
has been a University Trustee for
12 years.
"Changing Board presidents is
not unusual, one person just can't
do it every year," said Assistant
to the President Bob Hamrdla.
Christopher noted that Gaither
is "relatively youthful, but very
experienced." He is an "absolutely
ideal choice" as a replacement, he
said.
Gaither, 50, has been vice pres
ident of the trustees since 1984,
and has served on almost every
board committee during his six
years as a trustee.

Currently chairman of the trus
tees' Special Committe on Invest
ment Responsibility, Gaither has
chaired both of the other two
standing committees — Finance
and Administration, as well as Ac
ademic Affairs and Development.
As Chair of the SCIR, Gaither
favored "selective divestment" of
University holdings in South
Africa as the best way to combat
apartheid in that country.
A 1959 Princeton graduate,
Gaither received his J.D. from
Stanford Law School in 1964,
where he was note editor of the
Stanford Law Review. He has also
served as a law clerk to then-Chief
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court
Earl Warren and as a staff assis
tant to President Lyndon
Johnson.
