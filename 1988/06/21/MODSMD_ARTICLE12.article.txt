# Namphy names self head of Haitian government

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, swiftly gripping power
after escaping arrest to stage a dramatic
overnight coup, formed a solidly military
government yesterday, proclaiming himself
as president.
At the same time, civilian President
Leslie Manigat, ousted following the
Haitian strongman's surprise occupation
of the presidential palace Sunday night,
was secretly taken to Port-au-Prince air
port and flown with his wife and children
to the neighboring Dominican Republic.
Unconfirmed reports said that three
members of Manigat's Cabinet, including
Information Minister Roger Savain, had
been jailed. With one notable exception,
the other members of Manigat's ousted
government slipped from public view in the
early hours yesterday, when it became clear
that Namphy was firmly in control.
The exception was Mfy. Gen. Williams

Regala, who took leave from his army post
as Namphy's right-hand man last February
to serve as Manigat's civilian defense min
ister. Regala's role during the six-day crisis
between Namphy and Manigat that led to
the coup had been unclear until he appeared
beside his victorious army commander yes
terday to accept the No. 2 job in the new
military government as minister of interior
and defense.
After a night of heavy gunfire but no
confirmed casualties around the massive,
double-domed palace, it became clear that
Regala was not the only military man whose
loyalty to Manigat evaporated with
Namphy's unexpected escape Sunday night
from house arrest at his residence just
north of the capital.
Controversial Col. Jean-Claude Paul, the
powerful commander of Haiti's toughest
infantry unit, apparently did nothing to
halt the coup although he had backed

Manigat through last week's confrontation
with Namphy.
Paul, under indictment in the United
States for drug-trafficking, was shown on
national television yesterday morning
ceremonially emerging with a smile from
his unscarred barracks to embrace a senior
officer of the presidential guard that helped
Namphy capture the adjacent palace. It
clearly was not a surrender ceremony. One
of Paul's officers said that his Dessalines
unit did not fire a single shot during the
night.
The palace also appeared from the out
side to be unscathed by the night of gunfire,
which occurred during a deliberately staged
power blackout of much of the capital.
Yesterday, it was guarded by two artillery
mounted armored vehicles, a half-track and
a pair of anti-aircraft guns.
"If Paul's soldiers didn't shoot and no
bullets hit the palace or the Dessalines

barracks, then what was all the shooting
about?" asked one skeptical Port-au-Prince
businessman. He speculated that
Namphy's own loyalists, who freed him
from the house arrest ordered by Manigat
and escorted him into the palace, raised
the din themselves by firing into the air
for effect.
"It looks as if the old shoot-up was pure
theater," one Western diplomat concurred.
Namphy's action caught U.S. officials by
surprise. In Washington, the Reagan ad
ministration condemned the coup, although
the United States had been far from en
thusiastic about the election that brought
Manigat to the presidency last January.
In Toronto, where he is attending the
economic summit, President Reagan
adopted a cautious stance. "It's something
we are going to have to assess," he said.
