# Defense fraud evidence ignored, senator charges
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The inves
tigation of military procurement
practices became embroiled in po
litical controversy yesterday when
a senator charged that the Justice
Department and Pentagon consis
tently "turned their backs" on
evidence of defense fraud while
Attorney General Edwin Meese
111 defended the handling of the
cases.
In a Senate floor speech and
news conference afterwards, Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-lowa, charged
that Defense and Justice officials
ignored evidence of massive
procurement fraud in 1984 that
would have "produced four years
ago what we are just now begin
ning to see unfold."
Now, he said, "the public must
be made aware of the fact that
our Justice Department has been
asleep at the switch."
Meese responded by calling his
own news conference to contest
what he termed "misinformation"
by Grassley and others alleging
that the department had been lax

in going after defense fraud.
"We're very proud in the
Reagan administration of our
record of prosecuting defense
procurement fraud, as part of the
general crackdown ordered by the
president on fraud, waste and
abuse throughout the govern
ment," Meese said. "And this
latest investigation is just one
more example of the fine work
that is being done by tough, ex
perienced, professional
prosecutors."
The dispute came as new details
emerged about the origins of the
probe into allegations that defense
consultants bribed Pentagon offi
cials to obtain inside information
to help their contractor clients ob
tain lucrative military contracts.
A grand jury in Alexandria, Va.,
is to be impaneled Tuesday to
review allegations in the case, and
275 subpoenas have been issued
for documents and testimony be
ginning in mid-July.
