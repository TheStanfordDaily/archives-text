Court bans
all-male clubs
WASHINGTON - The Su
preme Court, in a ruling likely
to bolster efforts to ban discrim
ination by large, all-male private
clubs, unanimously upheld a
New York City law that barred
business-oriented clubs from
discriminating against women
and minorities.
The court rejected arguments
from an organization of private
clubs that a 1984 New York City
law, similar to one passed last
year by the District of Columbia,
violated club members' First
Amendment right to freedom of
association by forcing them to
admit women or minorities.
The closely watched case was
the third time in the last five
years that the court has consid
ered what criteria should distin
guish private clubs that are free
to discriminate from public ones
that may not do so. In all three

cases, the justices have unani
mously upheld broad state and
local antidiscrimination laws
aimed at breaking down barriers
at all-male private clubs.
Yesterday's ruling in New
York State Club Association,
Inc. v. City of New York came
just two days after the exclusive
Cosmos Club here — whose
members included Justice An
tonin Scalia and, until recently,
Justice Harry A. Blackmun —
voted overwhelmingly to change
its male-only policy.
Ex-CIA chief
indicted for
Contra aid
WASHINGTON - A former
Central Intelligence Agency sta
tion chief in Costa Rica was in
dicted yesterday on charges of
conspiracy to provide illegal aid
to the Nicaraguan rebels, a sign

that independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh has extended
his investigation of the Iran-
Contra scandal to focus on the
actions of several CIA officials.
Joseph Fernandez, 51, was
charged with helping then-
White House aide Oliver North
deliver guns to the Contras in
1986, during a period when
Congress had banned U.S. mil
itary aid to the rebels. The five
count grand jury indictment also
accused Fernandez of lying to
his superiors, to the ClA's in
spector general and to a White
House commission in an at
tempt to conceal his operation.
Fernandez, who used the nom
de guerre Tomas Castillo on his
secret operations in Costa Rica,
was the first CIA official to be
indicted on charges stemming
from the secret operation to
resupply the Contras.
