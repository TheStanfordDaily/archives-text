## Editor's Welcome 
### 
The first thing many
faithful Daily readers will
notice about the summer
Daily is that it lodes about
half as big as a normal Dai
ly.
Indeed the size of the
paper mimics many of the
other changes The Daily un
dergoes during these hot
months on the Farm.
Other things halved (or
more than halved) include:
the Daily staff that turns
out at painfully low levels
every year at this time, our
advertising revenues and
the number of frenzied pro
duction nights that drop
from five to two during the
summer.
These correspond, of
course, with the fewer num
ber of Dailys that appear —
on Tuesdays and Fridays in
stead of five days a week —
at various points on campus.
While each of these par
ticular variations may not
be beneficial for The Stan
ford Daily Corporation, the
general shift from high to
low gears is as welcome as
the warm weather for the
overall Daily spirit.
What we hope will result
from the expanded work
windows we enjoy over the
summer is a more finely
honed publication filled with
more carefully chosen
stories.
In fact, the story possibil
ities will be as large as the

paper is small with a num
ber of ongoing stories just
coming to a boil under the
summer sun.
Our entertainment, sports
and features pages will tap
both the fast-paced and
leisurely sides of summer
life at Stanford.
Perusing summer Dailys
past — and this column in
particular — I noticed
leisure is often the theme
set by the editor.
One summer editor in
June 1951, took such a
leisurely approach as to
make "no rash promises to
cover the campus or to
strike a happy medium be
tween campus and world
events. . . . (to) ask for no
suggestions, invite no
criticism and request no let
ters to the editor."
While we won't be so lack
adaisical in 1988, we hope
you'll set aside some of your
leisure time to take up, or
to continue, a Daily habit as
a reader or as a contributor
to our opinions pages.
As they said in the sum
mer of '51 "The Daily sin
cerely welcomes you to the
Farm."
