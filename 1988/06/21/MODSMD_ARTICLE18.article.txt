## Media too tough on Jackson 
### 
More interesting than all
the post-mortems on
Jesse Jackson in recent
weeks is the almost palpable sense
of relief driving them. As long as
the reverend was in the race the
media had to fight to contain his
success, no matter how limited it
was. Now all that's left is to mop
up the blood.
"You're exaggerating," you say.
"Conspiracy theories will get you
nowhere. Even if you are a
liberal." But I'd like you to hear
me out before you pass judgement
on this particular conspiracy the
ory. Then pillory me all you like.
First of all, let's completely ig
nore the issue of whether Jackson
is qualified to be president, or
even, as his most rabid aides are
demanding, vice-president. I defy
anyone to show me anything in
Jackson's past that makes him
signifigantly less qualified for the
presidency than Dukakis or Bush.
Many of you are no doubt think
ing of Jackson's less than stellar
performance as the head of
PUSH, or of his less than forgiv
able moments of anti-Semitism.
But as you laugh up your sleeve,
I ask you to compare Jackson's
record to those of the two long
tenured officials he ran against
and see whether their resumes
stand up to scrutiny. They don't.

What politicians would? Yes, my
friends, Jesse is a man, an often
opportunistic, manipulative man
at that. But what politician isn't?
I am not denying any of the
fears people have about what
would happen to this country if
Jackson got into a position of na
tional influence. The fact that
Jackson has done diddly-squat
with the only corporation he ever
ran seems in most Americans'
minds to equal permanent sym
bolic bankruptcy. The fact that
Jackson has never held office, that
he is an outsider in a place where
connections and greased wheels
count for the better part of valor
seems to forbode chaos.
But just how much experience
and culture must a candidate have
before he is called qualified?
Enough to make him white would
be my guess.
"Wait a minute," you say.
"Charging racism is a cop-out, a
way to avoid discussing Jackson's
weaknesses. Perhaps. But I have
seen enough columns patting
Jackson on the head for his spunk
and then telling him to take his
corn pone back to Greensborough.
I seriously wonder. As others
point out, Jackson says
Hymietown and it dogs him for
the rest of his days. Bush calls
Jackson a Chicago hustler and

nothing happens. Please under
stand: I am not glossing over
Jackson's embraces of Arafat and
Farrakhan, nor am I forgetting
his references to Zionism as the
"weed choking Judaism." But
where is the outcry over Dukakis
when he says, in so many words,
that he can just as well do without
the fag vote? Where is the op
probrium when Bush praises
Latinos for dropping out of high
school to become janitors? I see.
These people are white.They're
"electable." The color of their skin
is teflon.
Just remember, as these two
honchos go around the country,
appropriating Jackson's themes
to make their campaigns shine:
Jesse said it all first, and with a
great deal more gusto. Ail this
hogwash about Jackson's
"history-making effort" just goes
a long way to show how inept the
media is in the face of real history.
Come Judgement Day, the big
headline will be: What does Christ
want?
