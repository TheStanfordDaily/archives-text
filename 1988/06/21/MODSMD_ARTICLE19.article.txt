## Golden Knights offer Oski/Stanford Tree hostage swap 
### 
To whom it may concern:
Approximately five
weeks ago at a band
review involving Stanford and
Davis a great tragedy fell upon
the Stanford Cardinal. During
that review, the newly acquired
Stanford mascot (the tall tree
who will be referred to as S.M.)
was taken from the Stanford
Band. Over the next few weeks
the search for S.M. continued,
but all attempts to locate him
failed.

S.M. has been found, but
unfortunately for the Stanford
Cardinal S.M. is held captive by
the mighty claws of certain
honorable California Bears. This
letter is intended to inform the
Stanford student body and any
other Stanford supporters, that
if they ever want to see S.M.
again the following demands
must be met.
1: The California Bear which
was stolen approximately two
years ago from UC Berkeley,

will be returned in exchange for
S.M.
2: The exchange will take
place at Memorial Stadium on
the day of the Big Game thirty
minutes prior to the start of
the contest.
3: A sincere letter of apology
to the Berkeley alumni, faculty
and students will be printed in
the Daily Cal the Friday before
the Big Game by the party or
parties who took the California
Bear.

If these demands are not
acknowledged and met, we will
be forced to turn S.M. over to
Oski. Oski could always use a
new claw sharpener, especially
during Big Game Week.
Further proof will be provid
ed, i.e. a picture or a piece of
S.M., if Stanford denies that the
events described are true. We
await your reply and expect
communication to take place
through the school papers.
