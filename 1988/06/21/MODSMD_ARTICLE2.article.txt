# Campbell debate intensifies
## Hoover director says he might file lawsuit against Stanford 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn Campbell
said Friday that he refuses to let the University
buy him off in its attempt to retire him next year
and is consulting lawyers about possibly suing Stan
ford.
"I am up to the top of my nose [in lawyers],"
Campbell said.
The 28-year director said he will announce in
July whether he will take legal action or accept
Stanford's lucrative retirement offer that would al
low him to stay at the institution as a senior fellow
and director emeritus.
"If I were to file a lawsuit it would probably
destroy the University," a bitter Campbell said.
However, University Provost James Rosse said
he was "not aware" of what Campbell could use as
a basis for a lawsuit against Stanford. Rosse also
declined to speculate on the University's reaction
to a lawsuit.
On May 17, Campbell learned that the Stanford
University Board of Trustees unanimously in
structed him to step down as director when he
turns 65 next year.
In a letter to Campbell, the trustees offered him
retirement benefits ranging from a "generous salary"
in his new role, to a sabbatical of one or two years
with a travel and research stipend, to office space
and insurance benefits.
"I am amongst the first people to get a roughly
25 percent increase in salary if
I'd just bow out," Campbell said
jokingly.
He added that Stanford's at
tempt to entice him with money
is not an ethical way to run a
university and sets a bad example
for students. He said that if he
does decide to file suit against the
University he will do it for

Hoover's sake — not his own.
Campbell said he wants to en
sure that "the integrity of the ac
ademic practice be protected" and
that Hoover scholars continue
their research without "harass
ment."
"What's at stake is the issue of
control and who gets to spend all
our money," he said.
Campbell, who is Hoover's fifth
director, said he is also frustrated
by the trustees' decision to retire
him on the basis of age.
"I simply don't know what

these people are talking about,"
he said in reference to the trus
tees' decision. According to Camp
bell, an older, more experienced
director is needed to run Hoover
successfully.
Campbell called the wording in
a 1959 resolution between Her
bert Hoover and the University
that established 65 as the retire
ment age for Hoover directors
"ambiguous" and said no one can
know what a proper retirement
age should be for a Hoover direc
tor.

He went on to cite several men
who are older than 65 but still
serve important roles in society.
"Ronald Reagan is almost 78,"
Campbell pointed out. "If you had
an age 65 retirement he wouldn't
even have been able to run for
the presidency."
In regard to his own retirement
and the longstanding tension be
tween Hoover and the University,
Campbell likened himself to an
ancient warrior who will fight gal
lantly to the bitter end."l have
been coming back with my shield
for 40 years," he said.
