# Don't install waste facilities at Stanford
## 
### 
On Monday, July 11, the Palo
Alto City Council will review
the Santa Clara County pro
posed plan to permit hazardous
waste disposal facilities (in
cinerators) to be placed in the
Stanford Research Park.
This neighborhood organiza
tion agrees with the Barron
Park Association, the College
Terrace Association and other
organizations, that it is inappro
priate to site these extremely
hazardous facilities in such a
populated area as Palo Aito.

The location of any hazardous
waste incinerators must be
placed in unpopulated areas and
not next to populated residential
neighborhoods or businesses. It
is only sensible to locate these
dangerous chemical burners
where they will have little to no
direct impact on the public.
We support the concept that
a 2,000 foot buffer zone be
implemented in Santa Clara
County. The intent is to protect
the public, children, elderly,
workers, and the mass of popu
lation that could not be
evacuated in the likely event of
an incinerator mishap. Addition
ally, who wants to add to the

already unhealthy air in North
ern Santa Clara County?
Please follow the lead of other
individuals and organizations
and express your convictions to
the City Council and the Santa
Clara County Tanner Commis
sion.
