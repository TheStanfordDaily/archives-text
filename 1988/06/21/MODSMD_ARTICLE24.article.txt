## Stanford theater one acts fill summer's cultural void 
### Todd Pierce Editorial staff 
The cultural void of a Stanford
summer awaits us. But things
may improve, there is that dan
ger.
The danger is the six week
repertory season of the Stanford
Summer Theater, which will fea
ture short pieces from Samuel
Beckett, David Mamet, Bertolt
Brecht and Thornton Wilder. Re
member to bring your lunch —
performances will be at noon from
Tuesday to Friday in addition to
evening shows on Friday and Sat
urday.
The Summer Theater, a cul
tural staple for campus summers
before 1985, has returned thanks
to three doctoral students in the
Drama department and Michael
Ramsour, the new acting chair of
the department. All three are ex
perienced directors who wanted to
do summer productions with ac
tors from the Stanford communi
ty.
"We are an all-volunteer organ
ization operating under the aus
pices of the Drama department.
Everybody is working for free.
We're not out to make a buck;
we're out to turn the campus on,"
said Ed Isser, director of the three

Beckett pieces. Isser also directed
last winter's acclaimed production
of "The Normal Heart."
Isser explained that the daring,
exciting material convinced many
of the actors to stay on campus
and work on the plays without
compensation this summer.
"We're not really summer stock
because we're not doing stock pro
ductions. These are 20th century
classical pieces. .. . We wanted
obscure, uncommon work by well
known authors," Isser said.
Which is why the playwrights
seem more familiar than the
plays. Viewers expecting the usual
Beckett fare, for example, may be
surprised by the choice of "Play,"
"Not I," and "Rockaby," — three
arresting and original works.
"Doing Beckett is the ultimate
technical challenge for actors.
There's a process of giving your
self up to the material — the self
discipline required is incredible.
The actors have to surrender to
the Beckett script rather than
embrace it."
"Not I" certainly embodies this
challenge. Isser estimated that the
monologue, delivered at regular
speed, would take 40 minutes. In
the Beckett piece a spotlighted
"mouth on fire" spews forth the
script in 11 minutes.
The other productions call for
different types of acting. Oliver
Garland, another graduate stu
dent, is directing the two plays by
David Mamet — "The Water En
gine" and "Mr. Happiness" — and
"The Jewish Wife" by Bertolt
Brecht. He praised the artistic
range of the productions, which
celebrate the diversity of 20th cen
tury drama.
"The Mamet plays are radio
drama, sort of a multi-media mix.
They're a lot different from the
sustained images of Beckett. And
the Wilder pieces are very frag
mented — the characters flit in
and out; the plays are snapshots
of different regions," Garland
said.
He sees a definite link between
the Mamet and Brecht plays:
"Brecht is going to be recognized

as excellent 20th century theater.
The political tension in his work
doesn't dominante his dramatic
gift.... (In my productions) I
wanted to explore the relation of
the individual and the revolu
tion," a prominent theme in"The
Water Engine" and Brecht's "The
Exception and the Rule."
Geoffrey Proehl, the third doc
toral student responsible for the
Summer Theater, wanted to
direct a production before leaving
to teach at Villanova University
in the fall.
"These are American classics,
relatively frequently performed,
which use music, comedy and
drama. Wilder is interested in our
taking the time to see the
everyday, see the world rather
than marching through head
long," he said. "These are beau
tiful plays, beautifully written."
The two Wilder pieces, "Pul
lman Car Hiawatha" and "Happy
Journey," are both "journey
plays," according to Proehl. In

"Pullman Car," passengers on a
train represent people and things
from a character's life.
"Happy Journey" looks at a
family on a car trip, on the way
to visit relatives. Without conde
scension or false humility, Wilder
makes these prosaic journeys —
usually considered the means to
some destination — assume a
magical quality in themselves.
The one-act format works es
pecially well for spotlighting these
moments. Isser remarked that
"Play" can be seen as the exposure
of the three characters before an
invisible interrogator. The
staging, reminiscent of Sartre's
"No Exit," suggests the eternity
of the plight of three liars: each
buried in an urn up to the neck,
staring bug-eyed at the audience.
Isser saw the play as "the
momentous moment when the
change comes," when the charac
ters recognize their desperation.
Several dramatists have used the
one-act form to portray one event

or moment; the one-act has in
fact been Beckett's dominant dra
matic form for the last three
decades.
Garland said the directors
picked one-act plays because they
wanted to do noon theater. "Full
lengths are obviously better
known than one acts," he said,
but added that the plays are writ
ten by acknowleged masters of the
form. Proehl emphasized that the
plays are " 20th century classics."
"People don't have a chance to
see some of these great one-act
plays," he said.
The three graduate students
will teach an acting class together
this summer and want to continue
student productions. Garland and
Proehl have even left parts open
in the scripts for students in the
acting course.
Perhaps this summer we can
say, along with one of Beckett's
characters, that there are en
durable moments.

surprised by the choice of "Play,"
"Not I," and "Rockaby," — three
arresting and original works.
"Doing Beckett is the ultimate
technical challenge for actors.
There's a process of giving your
self up to the material — the self
discipline required is incredible.
The actors have to surrender to
the Beckett script rather than
embrace it."
"Not I" certainly embodies this
challenge. Isser estimated that the
monologue, delivered at regular
speed, would take 40 minutes. In
the Beckett piece a spotlighted
"mouth on fire" spews forth the
script in 11 minutes.
The other productions call for
different types of acting. Oliver
Garland, another graduate stu
dent, is directing the two plays by
David Mamet — "The Water En
gine" and "Mr. Happiness" — and
"The Jewish Wife" by Bertolt
Brecht. He praised the artistic
range of the productions, which
celebrate the diversity of 20th cen
tury drama.
"The Mamet plays are radio
drama, sort of a multi-media mix.
They're a lot different from the
sustained images of Beckett. And
the Wilder pieces are very frag
mented — the characters flit in
and out; the plays are snapshots
of different regions," Garland
said.
He sees a definite link between
the Mamet and Brecht plays:
"Brecht is going to be recognized

as excellent 20th century theater.
The political tension in his work
doesn't dominante his dramatic
gift.... (In my productions) I
wanted to explore the relation of
the individual and the revolu
tion," a prominent theme in"The
Water Engine" and Brecht's "The
Exception and the Rule."
Geoffrey Proehl, the third doc
toral student responsible for the
Summer Theater, wanted to
direct a production before leaving
to teach at Villanova University
in the fall.
"These are American classics,
relatively frequently performed,
which use music, comedy and
drama. Wilder is interested in our
taking the time to see the
everyday, see the world rather
than marching through head
long," he said. "These are beau
tiful plays, beautifully written."
The two Wilder pieces, "Pul
lman Car Hiawatha" and "Happy
Journey," are both "journey
plays," according to Proehl. In

"Pullman Car," passengers on a
train represent people and things
from a character's life.
"Happy Journey" looks at a
family on a car trip, on the way
to visit relatives. Without conde
scension or false humility, Wilder
makes these prosaic journeys —
usually considered the means to
some destination — assume a
magical quality in themselves.
The one-act format works es
pecially well for spotlighting these
moments. Isser remarked that
"Play" can be seen as the exposure
of the three characters before an
invisible interrogator. The
staging, reminiscent of Sartre's
"No Exit," suggests the eternity
of the plight of three liars: each
buried in an urn up to the neck,
staring bug-eyed at the audience.
Isser saw the play as "the
momentous moment when the
change comes," when the charac
ters recognize their desperation.
Several dramatists have used the
one-act form to portray one event

or moment; the one-act has in
fact been Beckett's dominant dra
matic form for the last three
decades.
Garland said the directors
picked one-act plays because they
wanted to do noon theater. "Full
lengths are obviously better
known than one acts," he said,
but added that the plays are writ
ten by acknowleged masters of the
form. Proehl emphasized that the
plays are " 20th century classics."
"People don't have a chance to
see some of these great one-act
plays," he said.
The three graduate students
will teach an acting class together
this summer and want to continue
student productions. Garland and
Proehl have even left parts open
in the scripts for students in the
acting course.
Perhaps this summer we can
say, along with one of Beckett's
characters, that there are en
durable moments.



(iina Schmeling and Jeffrey Schwartz stare blankly from their urns in (he Stanford Summer Theater
production of I lay by Samuel Beckett. Respites of silence rarely occur during this fast paced,
haunting and frighteningly funny drama.
The cultural void of a Stanford
summer awaits us. But things
may improve, there is that dan
ger.
The danger is the six week
repertory season of the Stanford
Summer Theater, which will fea
ture short pieces from Samuel
Beckett, David Mamet, Bertolt
Brecht and Thornton Wilder. Re
member to bring your lunch —
performances will be at noon from
Tuesday to Friday in addition to
evening shows on Friday and Sat
urday.
The Summer Theater, a cul
tural staple for campus summers
before 1985, has returned thanks
to three doctoral students in the
Drama department and Michael
Ramsour, the new acting chair of
the department. All three are ex
perienced directors who wanted to
do summer productions with ac
tors from the Stanford communi
ty.
"We are an all-volunteer organ
ization operating under the aus
pices of the Drama department.
Everybody is working for free.
We're not out to make a buck;
we're out to turn the campus on,"
said Ed Isser, director of the three

Beckett pieces. Isser also directed
last winter's acclaimed production
of "The Normal Heart."
Isser explained that the daring,
exciting material convinced many
of the actors to stay on campus
and work on the plays without
compensation this summer.
"We're not really summer stock
because we're not doing stock pro
ductions. These are 20th century
classical pieces. .. . We wanted
obscure, uncommon work by well
known authors," Isser said.
Which is why the playwrights
seem more familiar than the
plays. Viewers expecting the usual
Beckett fare, for example, may be
surprised by the choice of "Play,"
"Not I," and "Rockaby," — three
arresting and original works.
"Doing Beckett is the ultimate
technical challenge for actors.

self up to the material — the self
discipline required is incredible.
