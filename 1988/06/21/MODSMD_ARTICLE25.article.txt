# Diverse visitor crowd makes summer campus sparkle
## 
### Heather Goodspeed 
With temperatures hitting a
scorching 90 degree mark over the
past few days, it seems Stanford
is the hot place to be this summer.
In fact, visitors from abroad,
students from other universities,
high school students, conference
participants, tourists and Stan
ford students will all mount suc
cessive invasions of the Farm over
the next three months.
Over 190 conventions will take
place on campus this summer, ac
cording to Summer Conference
Manager Lois Fariello. Baroque
musicians, a Swedish student
chorus group and visitors from
NASA are just some of the con
vention participants visiting Stan
ford.
Last year, the University raised
more than $4.6 million through
the number of conferences held
on campus, Fariello said, adding
that the money raised will go to
lowering student housing costs
during the year.
Fariello said it is difficult to
entice convention groups to live
in student dorms because there
are no private baths. But "top
grade" bedspreads, "big" towels,
pictures hanging on the walls and
a "crash clean-up" effort in dorms

upgrade the residences for sum
mer.
In the realm of academics, high
school students, foreign students
as well as students from other
universities will all take part in
summer school programs here.
Undergraduate classes range from
English literature and chemistry,
to special programs in time man
agement and reading rate im
provement.
Most summer school residents
will stay in Wilbur Hall or Ham
marskjold House. According to
summer resident assistant Kelly
Bullard, visitors "seem apprehen
sive" but also seem "happy to be
here." Bullard, who was an RA
last year, said most of the summer
RAs have previous experience.
Some RAs supervise houses
reserved for the 90 high school
students living on campus. Sum
mer Residence Program Director
Kriss Ferrier described the high
school program as "very struc
tured." Students sign a summer
residence agreement which "for
bids" the use of "alcohol and ille
gal drugs," Ferrier said.
"I'm dying to see if it (the drug
policy) works," RA Terry Yen said.
Yen said that with "time away
from home to develop your own
personality" and fewer credit

hours than during the academic
year, high school students "will
have more fun than they expect."
Students from Japan make up
the largest group of foreign stu
dents coming to Stanford this
summer. Korean, Chinese, Euro
pean and South American stu
dents will also be on the campus,
according to Rozanne Stonham,
secretary of the English for
Foreign Students program.
About 130 undergraduate and
graduate students will enroll in
the English for Foreign Students
programs this summer. The eight
week graduate program provides
an intensive study of English for
foreign students who will enroll in
U.S. graduate schools in the fall.
The program also prepares for
eigners for "the culture shock" of
attending a university in the
United States, Stonham said.
There are also eight-week and
six-week programs for undergrad
uates — many of whom will
return to their foreign univer
sities in the fall.
For the tourists who travel to
the Farm, Stanford Tour Guide
Kari Bohlke said student guides
work longer hours during the
summer than in the school year
to accommodate the higher num
ber of summer visitors.
