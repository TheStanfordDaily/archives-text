# Inventor displays 'stolen' beam
## Cupertino man claims Stanford ripped off experiments 
### Heather Goodspeed 
Cupertino engineer Larry Bosch conducted an
unusual experiment outside of the Storke Student
Publications Building Friday, hoping to receive
recognition for what he said was unfair treatment
by Stanford faculty.
Claiming that Stanford, Disney Corp., NASA and
other research groups have "ripped off' his experi
ments, Bosch said he "wants justice" and hopes that
through public demonstrations he will receive the
attention he said he deserves.
Bosch's Friday demonstration featured a specially
designed 10-foot-long wooden beam which was able
to support the combined weight of 11 participants.
The beam itself weighs only 37 pounds. The par
ticipants, from Wilcox and Saratoga high schools,
took part in the experiment as part of an after-school
science project.
The column, which Bosch said he believes will

revolutionize the construction of earthquake safe
structures, bent only slightly under the weight of
the students.
Bosch, who does not have a college degree, said
he is "up against very educated and crooked people"
who have stolen experiments from him which were
conducted in his own home.
The beam used in Friday's demonstration was
made out of a special mixture of balsa wood, fiber
glass and high-strength tape that Bosch said he
developed.
Despite the severity of his charges, Bosch said
Friday's demonstration "was a day for the kids."
He said he enjoys the "optimism" of youngsters
who have not yet bought into the notion that
"academia exists for industry."
And 17-year-old Mark Thomson said his "interest
in advances" in science and technology led him to
help Bosch build Friday's beam.

Inventor Larry Bosch demonstrates the strength of his ultralight "earthquake proof' beam, an invention
he claims has been stolen by Stanford and various major corporations. Bosch says his technology will
be used to build the bridges, guardrails, and space stations of the future.
