# Coffee House smoking extinguished by new guidelines

### Laura Jacobson 
Some customers are fuming
over the Coffee House's new no
smoking policy, saying it will drive
away graduate students, foreign
students and the older clientele
who traditionally gather there.
The policy, which goes into ef
fect July 5, will restrict all
smoking inside the Coffee House
but will continue to allow some
smoking on the back patio.
Because it was originally de
signed as a recreation center, the
Coffee House's ventilation does
not meet the requirements of the
University's updated smoking
policy that went into effect last
March, according to Paul
Szczesiul, assistant director of
Tresidder Union.
Furthermore, the results of a
March survery conducted by the
Coffee House showed that out of
300 customers 70 percent favored
a smoking ban.
The ban "serves the needs of
students," Coffee House Manager
Jeff Lougee said, adding that only
six percent of graduate students
are smokers and only four percent
of undergraduates.
Coffee House student manager
Amy O'Brien said she was "hap
py" the smoking restriction

passed. "The survey reaffirmed
what [Tresidder Union] already
wanted to do," she said.
O'Brien, who is allergic to
smoke, said the ban will not only
make for healthier air but will
eliminate ashes and facilitate
cleaning.
However, Jerome Barraquand,
a visiting postdoctoral scholar
from France who smokes, said he
does not agree with the ban al
though he has become accustomed
to smoking restrictions.

"As long as I don't bother them,
they should let me die slowly," he
said.
Other Coffee House customers

said they feared the no-smoking
policy will change the Coffee
House's atmosphere, chasing
away the "Bohemian types" and
liberal arts students known for
frequenting the cafe.
"(The ban] is defying the whole
cultural tradition of the Coffee
House," said graduate student
Kelly Massey, who doesn't smoke.
"Jazz just won't be the same."
Yet, junior Jill Johnson said the
cultural atmosphere will not
change at the Coffee House, only
the "quality of air atmosphere"
will be different.
Several Coffee House customers
wondered what would happen to
smokers during the winter when
it becomes too cold and wet to
smoke outside.
Kathy Hochmann, a University
employee who does not smoke, ob
jected to the ban, saying smokers
would have to "sit outside while
it's raining." However, she added
that it was her right as a non
smoker "not to have to put up
with smoke."
Engineering graduate student
Changiz Khoda said he hoped a
compromise could be reached at
the Coffee House. "The place is
large. ... I would like to see
smokers and non-smokers live to
gether in peace."
