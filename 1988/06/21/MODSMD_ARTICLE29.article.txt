## Summertime releases swamp record shoppers 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Howdy, folks, step right up for
this month's presentation of Fis
cal Fidelity, the column for people
with money to burn but nothing
to set fire to. If you are loaded
with cash but low on ideas, keep
your eyes peeled on this page for
pleasant suggestions for your
music selections.
With the summer season now
fully in swing, the record com
panies have released a plethora of
products designed to make your
Walkman sizzle hotter than the
sand. To help you get a handle
on this mass of music, Fiscal
Fidelity is proud to branch out
and give you not just one, but a
whole host of options for your cash
and coin, as well as tips for hun
ting down the always elusive bar
gain recording.
Without further ado. . ..

Option One: Albums/Cassettes
Various artists, "Live for
Ireland" — This should win some
kind of award for Best Charity
Album of the Year. Featuring a
host of artists ranging from
megastars U2 and Elvis Costello
to closet celebrities like the
Pogues, Boomtown Rats and the

perennially-popular Irish
band Clannad, this lively compi
lation will fit quite nicely in al
most anyone's collection.
Besides, it's for a good cause,
they tell us, so at the very least
you can get the warm feeling from
the charitable act of purchasing
it. Then, if you do not like it at

all, you can slip it next to your
USA for Africa record on the
dusty shelf in the back corner of
your room and deduct it from
your taxes.
Ziggy Marley and the Melody
Makers, "Conscious Party" —
Yes, Ziggy is Bob Marley's son,
and no, this album is not like
Beatlemania. Though possessing
a voice similar to his father, the
younger Marley has chosen to
move away from a strict reggae
style to blaze new trails.
The result is an exciting release
boding well for Ziggy's future.
Though the first side seems to
lack a little something, the second
simply takes off and soars.
Michelle Shocked, "The Texas
Camp fire Tapes" — Now I know
I've already recommended this
cut, but I think it is a suggestion
worth repeating in light of some
new information. -
In the past few months since

the album's first release,
Shocked's popularity has in
creased astonomically. "Tapes"
hit No. 5 on the U.K. charts,
prompting PolyGram Records to
sign her and offer a $130,000 ad
vance to produce a studio album.
No studio production, however,
can match the warmth of the fire
she sat around at the Kerrville
Folk Festival in 1986, where an
Englishman's Walkman recorded
the dozen gems that comprise the
"Tapes." Charming and surpris
ingly crisp and clear, the im
promptu debut remains one of the
freshest recordings released this
year.
Option Two: Compact Discs
As I discovered last week during
my trip to Los Angeles, the com
pact disc market has grown a life
of it's own, separate from the
traditional LP and cassette. Spe
cial CD-only compilations have

been springing up frequently, as
have the silly array of CD singles
that clutter record store check
stands.
Fortunately for bargain
hunters, the market has also
widened to include used CD sales.
Safer bets than used records or
tapes because compact discs just
don't wear out, CDs are a budget
audiophile's dream.
Here are a few discs that not
only tower above the rest, but
with a little comparison shopping
can also be found for less than
$13:
The Beatles, "Abbey Road" —
This may arguably be one of the
most solid, complete albums ever

released. Almost every song fea
tured has become a classic,
showing how incredibly far the
Lennon-McCartney genius
reached. Amazing on album,
awestriking on disc.
Pink Floyd, "A Collection of
Great Dance Songs" — This is
the closest this band has come to
releasing a greatest hits album.
Although each of the songs re
quires its original companions to
have their full impact, this collec
tion is still a nice disc to have.
The Rolling Stones, "Still Life
(American Tour 1981)" — Next
to some Grateful Dead bootlegs,
this may be one of the top "feel
good" records available.
The Sisters of Mercy, "First and
Last and Always" — Get 'em
while they're hot, folks.

Option Three: Classic, Costly
Compilations
Regardless of the format pur
chased, the following two master
pieces are musts for any collec
tion:
Eric Clapton, "Crossroads" —
The undisputed czar of guitar has
finally been immortalized. This
five-album, three-tape and three-
CD release contains enough classic
Clapton to please even his most
loyal fans. Quite simply, it's in
credible.
Joe Jackson, "Live 1980/86" —
Though not nearly as large as
"Crossroads," "Live" delivers a
comparably potent punch. Fusing
jazz with rock to form a lively
hybrid, Jackson has created a host
of tunes that just shine in a live
performance.

of tunes that just shine in a live
performance.
Howdy, folks, step right up for
this month's presentation of Fis
cal Fidelity, the column for people
with money to burn but nothing
to set fire to. If you are loaded
with cash but low on ideas, keep
your eyes peeled on this page for
pleasant suggestions for your
music selections.
With the summer season now
fully in swing, the record com
panies have released a plethora of
products designed to make your
Walkman sizzle hotter than the
sand. To help you get a handle
on this mass of music, Fiscal
Fidelity is proud to branch out
and give you not just one, but a
whole host of options for your cash
and coin, as well as tips for hun
ting down the always elusive bar
gain recording.
Without further ado. . ..

Option One: Albums/Cassettes
Various artists, "Live for
Ireland" — This should win some
kind of award for Best Charity
Album of the Year. Featuring a
host of artists ranging from
megastars U2 and Elvis Costello
to closet celebrities like the
Pogues, Boomtown Rats and the

perennially-popular Irish
band Clannad, this lively compi
lation will fit quite nicely in al
most anyone's collection.
Besides, it's for a good cause,
they tell us, so at the very least
you can get the warm feeling from
the charitable act of purchasing
it. Then, if you do not like it at

all, you can slip it next to your
USA for Africa record on the
dusty shelf in the back corner of
your room and deduct it from
your taxes.
Ziggy Marley and the Melody
Makers, "Conscious Party" —
Yes, Ziggy is Bob Marley's son,
and no, this album is not like
Beatlemania. Though possessing
a voice similar to his father, the
younger Marley has chosen to
move away from a strict reggae
style to blaze new trails.
The result is an exciting release
boding well for Ziggy's future.
Though the first side seems to
lack a little something, the second
simply takes off and soars.
Michelle Shocked, "The Texas
Camp fire Tapes" — Now I know
I've already recommended this
cut, but I think it is a suggestion
worth repeating in light of some
new information. -
In the past few months since

the album's first release,
Shocked's popularity has in
creased astonomically. "Tapes"
hit No. 5 on the U.K. charts,
prompting PolyGram Records to
sign her and offer a $130,000 ad
vance to produce a studio album.
No studio production, however,
can match the warmth of the fire
she sat around at the Kerrville
Folk Festival in 1986, where an
Englishman's Walkman recorded
the dozen gems that comprise the
"Tapes." Charming and surpris
ingly crisp and clear, the im
promptu debut remains one of the
freshest recordings released this
year.
Option Two: Compact Discs
As I discovered last week during
my trip to Los Angeles, the com
pact disc market has grown a life
of it's own, separate from the
traditional LP and cassette. Spe
cial CD-only compilations have

been springing up frequently, as
have the silly array of CD singles
that clutter record store check
stands.
Fortunately for bargain
hunters, the market has also
widened to include used CD sales.
Safer bets than used records or
tapes because compact discs just
don't wear out, CDs are a budget
audiophile's dream.
Here are a few discs that not
only tower above the rest, but
with a little comparison shopping
can also be found for less than
$13:
The Beatles, "Abbey Road" —
This may arguably be one of the
most solid, complete albums ever

released. Almost every song fea
tured has become a classic,
showing how incredibly far the
Lennon-McCartney genius
reached. Amazing on album,
awestriking on disc.
Pink Floyd, "A Collection of
Great Dance Songs" — This is
the closest this band has come to
releasing a greatest hits album.
Although each of the songs re
quires its original companions to
have their full impact, this collec
tion is still a nice disc to have.
The Rolling Stones, "Still Life
(American Tour 1981)" — Next
to some Grateful Dead bootlegs,
this may be one of the top "feel
good" records available.
The Sisters of Mercy, "First and
Last and Always" — Get 'em
while they're hot, folks.

Option Three: Classic, Costly
Compilations
Regardless of the format pur
chased, the following two master
pieces are musts for any collec
tion:
Eric Clapton, "Crossroads" —
The undisputed czar of guitar has
finally been immortalized. This
five-album, three-tape and three-
CD release contains enough classic
Clapton to please even his most
loyal fans. Quite simply, it's in
credible.
Joe Jackson, "Live 1980/86" —
Though not nearly as large as
"Crossroads," "Live" delivers a
comparably potent punch. Fusing
jazz with rock to form a lively
hybrid, Jackson has created a host
of tunes that just shine in a live
performance.
