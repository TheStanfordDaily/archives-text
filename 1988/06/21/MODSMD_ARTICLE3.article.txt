In a statement sent to the Stanford Board
of Trustees, 64 Hoover Institution scholars
denounced the trustees' decision to remove
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell on the
basis of age rather than performance.
Reacting to the trustees' unanimous vote
in May that Campbell step down as director
when he turns 65 next year, the scholars said
they found the decision "puzzling."
"We think that the issue of Campbell's con
tinuation should rest on his current perform
ance, not on his age" the scholars said in the
statement that was sent to the trustees on
June 8. There are approximately 85 scholars
at Hoover.
The letter raises the question of whether a
required retirement age actually exists for
Hoover directors.
The trustees base their decision on a 1959
trustee resolution approved by
Herbert Hoover which establishes
65 as the retirement age for
Hoover directors. The resolution
states that the director "should
be of an age which gives him a
substantial period of service
before the retirement age of 65."
But Senior Research Fellow
George Marotta argued that the
1959 resolution is vague and out
dated. In today's society the re
tirement age is "rapidly extending
to 70" and the trustess should
recognize this change, he wrote.
The resolution does "not chisel
in marble" 65 as a retirement age

and there "is no reason" for
Campbell to step down, he added.
"I think he's being fired,"
Marotta said in an interview.
Campbell, who turned 64 in
April, has said in the past that
he wants to remain director until
he is 70.
However, according to Trustee
President Warren Christopher,
University policy stipulates that
Stanford executives should retire
at 65. Christopher said the trus
tees will adhere to the 1959 re
tirement resolution.
"The University continues to
feel that age 65 is the right time
for people with executive respon
sibility to give up their responsi
bility," Christopher said, adding
that retirement policy does not ap
ply to faculty members.

"There obviously comes a point
to have a change and to provide
a new and different approach to
executive responsibility," Christo
pher said. "After 28 years it seems
to us that it is time for that
change."
But Marotta questioned how
Christopher could ask Campbell
to give up his position while at
the same time appoint former
University President Richard
Lyman, who is slightly older than
Campbell, to head Stanford's new
Institute of International Rela
tions this fall. Lyman's appoint
ment was made at the same May
10 trustee meeting where Camp
bell's retirement was approved.
"It is ironic that in the same
meeting where they showed
Campbell the door they initiated

Lyman," said Marrota. He added
that these two decisions con
stitute a "double standard."
But Lyman said his new posi
tion at Stanford was "not compa
rable" to Campbell's and that
there is no basis for comparison.
Christopher also said that
Lyman's position is "more aca
demic" than executive and should
not be compared to Campbell's.
Whereas it is "justifiable" for
Lyman to take on a position at
Stanford although he is nearly 65,
it is not acceptable in Campbell's
case, Christopher said.
Lyman, who is currently presi
dent of the Rockefeller Founda
tion in New York City, said he is
coming to Stanford because the
Foundation also has a mandatory
retirement age of 65.
