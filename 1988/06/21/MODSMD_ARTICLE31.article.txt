# New Age novice scores a hit

"Neverland"
"Neverland" has made me feel
like I'm a psychic reviewer.
While browsing through a
record store last weekend, I en
countered an album by Suzanne
Ciani, an artist whom I had not
heard of before, signed to an
equally mysterious "Private
Music" label. Even more ethereal
was the cover illustration, an air
brushed, soft focus photograph
(presumably of Ciani) spinning in
a long, white gown. Several Coc
teau Twins records, adorned with
equally beautiful pictures, quickly
popped into mind.
All in all, the cover conveyed a
sense of tranquility, giving the
viewer/potential listener a pleas
ant first impression of "Never
land." The psychic reviewer in me
said, "Pick up this album â€” it's
probably New Age, and if not it
will still be mellow. You need
some quiet music and are feeling
adventurous, so what have you
got to lose?"
With this dose of self-instilled
confidence, I eagerly picked up a

cassette, the result: I was not even
slightly disappointed. Though I'm
not a New Age fanatic, Ciani's
music relaxed me in a way that
only George Winston's "Decem
ber" had previously been able to.

In fact, "Neverland" and "De
cember" sound about as similar
as a piano album and a syn
thesizer record can sound. Aug
mented by "Texture" synthesizers
which provide just that, Ciani's
Winston-like digital piano lines
reach out and soothe the listener's
soul. Synthesizers can rarely cap

ture the essence of actual
musicians, but somehow she man
aged to make it all work.
The two opening songs, the title
track and "Tuscany," are the
finest cuts on "Neverland," while
the moody "Lumiere" provides a
nice ending to the endeavor. If
something to soothe you on warm
afternoons is the object of your
quest, you'll get nothing but good
vibrations from Ciani.
