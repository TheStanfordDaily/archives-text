Bourgeois Tagg "YOYO"
Listening to Bourgeois
Tagg's latest album, "YOYO,"
reminds me of dinner at grand
mother's house. You see,
grandma is a health food nut,
and every time we would have
dinner at her place, she man
aged to make a salad that
would make even the hungriest
of herbivores think twice
before chowing down.
Furthermore, the dressing
was always tasteless. So, when
ever grandma made salad, I
was forced to pick out the let
tuce and carrots with my fork
while desperately trying to
avoid those semi-hard white
balls — God only knows what
they're called — that were scat
tered around my plate.
This record is just like
grandma's salad. There are a
couple of tasty vegetables in
side, but it is just too much

work trying to pick them out
from all of the other assorted
garbage served on the plate;
one could conceivably wear out
the fast forward button on
one's tape deck in this endeav
or.
Yet, there is one very sweet,
very tasty cherry tomato in this
menagerie, titled "I Don't Mind
at All." Don't get me wrong,
it is not a classic by any means;
however, it is the kind of song
that would be almost as pleas
ant to listen to if sung in
Bhutanese.
Simply put, the song is just
like bacon bits, which make a
delightful topping but insub
stantial meal. Considering that
the rest of the album is nothing
more than sprout-covered
vinyl, "Mind" provides a
refreshing change of pace.
The rest of the album isn't
thoughtful, isn't inspiring nor
even senselessly commercial. If
you like minimalism, this is the
album for you.
My recommendation: eat out.
