# World Series Extra
## Champs Again 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — Stanford
catcher Doug Robbins
couldn't sleep.
"Trying to go to sleep last night
was like when you were a little
kid, trying to go to sleep before
Christmas morning."
When he awoke, bright and ear
ly, the next morning, the sky was
sunny and the air was warm. The
grass was a rich sun-kissed green.
It was in fact the morning kids
and baseball players (a redundant
grouping, perhaps) dream about
all year.
It was June 11. Christmas
morning.
Stanford had not been the best
baseball team it could be all year.
It's behavior had been, well, in
consistent.
But when the players and
coaches went down and looked un
der a tree called Rosenblatt Sta

dium, the present they had wished
for all year was waiting for them.
Funny, it was the same gift they
had gotten last year.
They were NCAA College World
Series champions.
Stanford jingle-belled five runs
in the first inning off Arizona
State starter Rusty Kilgo and
glided on to a 9-4 victory over the
Sun Devils to win its second
straight NCAA crown in front of
16,071 fans.
Senior Lee Plemel, who pitched
two complete-game wins, was
named CWS Most Outstanding
Player. Robbins and first baseman
Ron Witmeyer were also named
to the all-CWS team.
Other than USC from 1970-74,
Stanford is the only school ever
to repeat as CWS champion. The
NCAA title was the third this year
for Stanford, after men's and
women's tennis, and gives the uni
versity 11 NCAA titles in three

years — more than any other
school in the nation.
Yet at 46-23, Stanford has the
worst winning percentage of any
CWS champion ever. The baseball
team finished second in the
Pacific 10 Conference Southern
Division to ASU, lost five of six
regular-season games to the Sun
Devils and faced eight elimination
games in postseason play.
But for some reason, Santa jtill
came — again.
"No way," junior Ed Sprague
said when asked if he thought in
midseason that the team would
repeat. "(But) as the season went
along, guys started turning it on.
We just had so much adversity —
ups and downs — we just weren't
playing that well. But finally we
put things together."
Stanford put it all together for
five runs in the bottom of the
first inning — against Kilgo, who
was 4-0 with a 1.95 ERA in the
postseason.
Junior Frank Carey, who batted
.364 in postseason play, led off
and singled to right-center field.
One out later, Sprague pulled an
outside breaking ball for his third
CWS home run. Stanford led 2-0,
and Santa's sleigh was on its way.
Sophomore Paul Carey ripped
the next Kilgo pitch to right for
a single, and senior Doug Robbins
walked on four pitches. Kilgo then
got ahead of Witmeyer 0-2 but
the junior first baseman singled
to center, scoring Carey.
Kilgo, who was stellar as a
starter in the CWS after being a
reliever all season, was taken out
after one-third of an inning.
"[Stanford] seemed to be a
much more confident team than
they have been earlier," Kilgo
said. "I think when they lost their
regional opener and then fought
their way to the World Series, it
really helped their character and
their confidence."
Bias Minor replaced Kilgo. The
next batter, sophomore Brian
Johnson, batting .067 in the CWS
at the time, drove a 3-2 pitch to

ASU shortstop Pat Listach singled with
two out in the ninth. But Finn popped up
between first and second. The clock
counted down. . . . Witmeyer gloved it and
Sprague led charge to the 'Look out
below!' pileup in the infield.

the wall in left center. Robbins
and Witmeyer scored and Stan
ford led 5-0.
Still, Stanford could not un
wrap its present yet. ASU was a
team that just the day before had
scored 19 runs, including nine in
just one inning.
"A five-run lead against these
guys is like a 2-0 lead or some
thing like that," Frank Carey said,
"Especially with the wind blowing
out, they've got so many guys that
can just hit it out of the park."
"We just had to get a good pitch
ing performance," Marquess said.
Enter Stan Spencer. A fresh
man in the biggest game of his
life since . . . pitching and winning
the NCAA Northeast Regional
title game 11 days earlier, he had
already survived one test in the
top of the first when he stranded
ASU's John Finn at third.
Now he had a five-run lead.
What would he do with it?
"I just wanted to come in and
throw strikes, spot the fastball
and go right at them," Spencer
said. "Once you've got a lead you
don't want to walk anybody, you
want to make them hit you."
Spencer allowed only six hits
and walked none in his first seven
innings. He was challenging the
Sun Devil "hitters — and succeed
ing.
When he finally faltered in the

eighth, giving up a three-run
homer to ASU's Steve Willis to
cut the lead to 9-4, junior Steve
Chitren, who had gone four in
nings for a save the night before,
came in to relieve.
Chitren inherited a runner on
first, but on the second pitch Sun
Devil designated hitter Martin
Peralta lined into a 4-3 double
play.
Then, center fielder extraor
dinaire Eric DeGraw banged into
the wall in center field to haul in
a 410-foot drive by Tim Spehr to
end the inning.
The play was stunning but
that's no surprise; DeGraw has
been regarded as the team's best
defensive outfielder all year. But
DeGraw, who actually came in as
a replacement for right-handed
hitting freshman Mike Eicher
when the left-handed Kilgo was
removed from the game, had been
l-for-13 in the CWS before getting
two hits, a stolen base, and a run
this day.
"It seemed like the whole time
the only thing I was contributing
was my defense," DeGraw said.
"For once everything came to
gether and that makes me happy."
With two out in the ninth, Stan
ford still up 9-4, ASU mounted
its last threat of the season. Short
stop Pat Listach singled with two
out. But Finn popped up between
first and second. The clock

counted down. . . . Witmeyer
gloved it and Sprague led charge
to the "Look out below!" pileup
in the infield.
"We knew we could beat them,"
Spencer said. "Both times they
played us we weren't going real
well. The first time we played
down there, we really did bad . ..
it was just a terrible series. They
had never played us when we've
played well.
"Yeah, I felt quite a bit of pres
sure — a freshman coming into
a championship game," Spencer
added. "It's kind of like a dream
come true."

Richard Murphy — Daily
Freshman Stan Spencer (above) proved indispensable in his final
start of the season, the championship game. Junior third baseman
Ed Sprague (33) led the Cardinal's offensive explosion with a two-run
homer in the first inning en route to Stanford's second national
title in a row.
