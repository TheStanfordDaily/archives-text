# Card executes well in executing Fresno
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — Deep in the
lazy heart of the Midwest, where
the plains sprawl for miles and
the Holiday Inn miniature golf
course has no windmills, it's easy
to get a little laid-back.
This was proven true by both
the Stanford and Fresno State
baseball teams in the opening
round of the NCAA College World
Series.
Fresno St. laid back and played
loosely. And Stanford laid back
and pounded the Bulldogs into
temporary oblivion, otherwise
known as the losers' bracket.
Before over 12,000 fans at

Rosenblatt Stadium, the Cardinal,
seeded seventh, knocked off the
second-seeded Bulldogs for the
first time in three tries this year,
10-3, on a lazy June 4 afternoon.
Stanford advanced in the CWS to
play Fullerton State, winners over
Miami 9-3 in the nightcap.
"I was very pleased with our
execution," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said. "We played a good
game in all phases. Our last five
games (stretching back to the
Northeast Regional) are the best
complete games we've put to
gether all year. We are playing
our best baseball and 1 hope it
continues."
For the second straight year,
Stanford defeated a previously un

beaten pitcher, Bulldog John
Salles, who was previously 15-0,
to open the CWS. And for the
second straight game, Frank
Carey sparked the Cardinal to vic
tory.
The junior second baseman,
Most Valuable Player of the
NCAA Northeast Regional,
homered, tripled and singled
against Fresno St., raising his
average to .500 in postseason play.
"Don't talk too loud," junior
third baseman Ed Sprague cau
tioned. "You'll wake him up."
"I'm just hot right now," Carey
said. "I'm in a bubble and I hop r
it doesn't pop."
The Carey bubble propelled
senior Lee Plemel (11-8), who took
advantage of some lazy Bulldog
bats to record his second complete
game and sixth straight win.
"The fact that they had a lot
of right-handed hitters was a big
plus," Plemel said. "I think they
were a little tentative at the start.
The big thing for us was to get
that big lead."
That was Carey's department.
He started the Cardinal off in the
first with a long drive down the
line in right, arriving at third base
standing as right fielder Steve
Hosey was slow in retrieving the
ball.
Moments later, with the Bull
dog infield back, conceding the
run, sophomore Troy Paulsen
grounded to second, scoring Carey
and putting Stanford ahead 1-0.
Then with one out in the third
and sophomore designated hitter
Tim Griffin on second following
a double, Carey was the man
again.
Now, the fence in right-center
field is 370 feet away. Carey hit
a lazy fly ball that ended up going,
well, about 371 feet.
At first glance, the ball was
eminently playable and Hosey
drifted back easily with the ball,
but there was little he could do.
The ballpark just wasn't built to
his specifications, and Carey had
his second home run of the year
— Stanford 3, Fresno St. 0
Three-run leads, however, do
not daunt Fresno St., which came
in averaging 10 runs per game.
So, buoyed by third baseman Mike
Burton's two-run homer to left
center in the top of the fourth,

his 16th, the Bulldogs were still
playing their infield back in the
bottom of the fourth.
That laid-back attitude allowed
sophomore Paul Carey, who
doubled, to score on two
grounders, the last by junior Ron
Witmeyer to make it 4-2.

Three straight singles by Jeff
Mott, Tom Goodwin and Eddie
Zosky, again with two out, cut
the lead to 4-3, but Plemel got
Pacific Coast Athletic Association
MVP Lance Shebelut to foul out
to first to escape further damage.
Shebelut, a transfer from Stan
ford, was 6-for-8 with three
homers against the Cardinal going
into the game.
And then, Frank Carey reached
base for the ninth straight time
by leading off the bottom of the
fifth with a single to center. Carey
stole second and went to third on
Paulsen's bloop single to right.
This time, Fresno St. wasn't so
relaxed. It had its infield in and
14-2 Eric Schullstrom warming
up in the pen.
But even though they threw
Carey out on Sprague's grounder
to third, the Bulldogs could not
relax — Salles wild-pitched the
runners to second and third. Paul
Carey wound up on first after an
intentional walk, and Salles was
out of the game.
Fortunes continued to flip-flop.
With the bases loaded now, Hosey
nabbed a shot to the warning
track in right by Robbins, scoring
Paulsen and making it 5-3.
But then Hosey misplayed a
similar drive by Witmeyer. It went
for a triple, scoring Sprague and
Paul Carey to break open the
game.
"[Hosey] opened up right away
(on the ball) but the ball didn't
hook and he didn't make a real
good adjustment on it," Fresno
St. Coach Bob Bennett said.
The 7-3 lead was both extended
and defended well by Stanford in

the final innings. Sprague hit his
20th home run in the seventh in
ning and the Cardinal capitalized
on Burton's two eighth-inning er
rors for a pair of insurance runs.
Meanwhile, Stanford sported fine
plays in the field, the most
noteworthy came when Paulsen
roamed to deep short to field a
carom off of Sprague and threw
out Bulldogs' Steve Vondran.
With that kind of support,
Plemel was on cruise control.
"[Plemel] pitched a whale of a
ball game," Marquess said. "He
kept them off-balance. He's tough
to beat (with a lead) because he
won't beat himself."
On the other hand, Salies
wasn't at his best against Stan
ford, which handed Texas' Curt
Krippner his first loss in 14 de
cisions in the opening round of
the 1987 CWS.
"You know [Salles] is going to
be around the plate," first base
man Ron Witmeyer said. "You
have it in your head to be ready
to swing the bat (and not wait
for a walk). I think that helps
this team."
Salles made no excuses.
"I didn't make good pitches and
it hurt me," Salles said. "I just
didn't do the job.
"They were setting up for my
slider and I didn't have my slider
where I wanted it — I couldn't
pinpoint it. It's not hard to hit a
fastball a long way," Salles said.

Richard Murphy — Daily
This may have been the easiest catch junior center fielder Eric
DeGraw had during the entire College World Series. He spent most
of the time turning difficult plays into defensive gems.
