# Sprague taketh and Sprague giveth away

When third baseman Ed
Sprague hit a three-run home run
to give Stanford a 3-2 third-inning
lead over Fullerton State in the
second round of the NCAA College
World Series June 6, Cardinal
fans held their breath.

In the sixth inning, Stanford's
fielders kicked their faithful in
the gut, and left them gasping.
Four errors in that sixth, three
by erstwhile hero Sprague, gave
three unearned runs to the Bull
dogs, who then rode the four-hit,
13-strikeout pitching of Mark
Beck to a 5-3 win.
Stanford fell into the loser's
bracket, where they would face
Miami (Fla.) in an eliminaion
game the next day.
Beck (10-6), pitching the biggest
if not the best game of his career,
overpowered the Cardinal.
"Mark pitched extremely well,"
Fullerton St. Coach Larry Cochell
said. "He was getting three (dif
ferent) pitches over for strikes.
That's what makes him so effec
tive — when he gets that change

over, they can't sit on his fast
ball."
"The ump was giving me the
outside corner, so I was just
throwing it there," Beck said. "All
my pitches were working. I've had
a couple games like this, but this
one seems like the peak because
its in the World Series."
Still, if it hadn't been for Stan
ford's problems (the Cardinal
made a total of six errors in the
game) in the sixth, Beck could
easily have gone out a 3-2 loser.
Stanford freshman Mike Mus
sina (9-4), after giving up single
runs in the first two innings, was
sailing along. He had retired 11
batters in a row before giving up
what seemed like a harmless
single to the Titans' ShaneJHores.
Harmless, it seemed, because
the next hitter, Brent Mayne, hit
what appeared to be his third con
secutive double-play ball to Stan
ford sophomore Troy Paulsen at
short. But the ball ran up Paul
sen's arm, and Mayne, who was
batting .404 going into the game,
was aboard. It was Paulsen's sec
ond error of the game.
Titan second baseman Mike
Ross then grounded sharply to
Sprague, who couldn't handle it.
Two errors, and the bases were
loaded.
Stanford sophomore left fielder
Brian Johnson then came up with
the Cardinal's best defensive play
of the game — a dazzling catch
of Keith Kaub's grand-slam bid
well above the seven-foot left field

wall. The sacrifice fly knotted the
score at 3-3, with Mayne and Ross
also advancing a base.
"It didn't seem that tough at
the time," Johnson said of the
catch. "I got back in enough
time. ... It seemed to come

straight down rather than at an
angle."
Jim Osborn then hit another
grounder at Sprague. He hobbled
the ball as Mayne scored — and


Game 2


Richard Murphy — Daily
Junior third baseman Ed Sprague's three-run homer in the third
inning put Stanford up 3-2 over Fullerton St. Unfortunately, three
sixth-inning errors by Sprague contributed to Fullerton's comeback
5-3 win.
