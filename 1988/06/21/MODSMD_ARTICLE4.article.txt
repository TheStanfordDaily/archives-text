# Assistant dean quits; cites lack of racial progress
## 
### Ted Nierras 
Saying that she had been unable to "af
fect Stanford's sensitivity and responsive
ness to the needs of minority people," Linda
Wells, assistant dean for student affairs in
the School of Engineering, resigned June
10.
In her 10 years working at Stanford,
Wells said she had been excluded from
policy decisions within the School of Engi
neering, and that her efforts to improve
the quality of minority life within the school
were futile. Instead, she said she became
an advocate for minority students' con
cerns.
Engineering Dean James Gibbons said
Wells' resignation is "a great loss for Stan
ford."
He named Cheryll Hawthorn, presently
director of the engineering school's Math
ematics, Engineering, and Science Achieve
ment Program, as acting assistant dean to
replace Wells. Both Wells and Hawthorn
are black.
Wells has now taken a position at the

National Consortium for Graduate Degrees
for Minorities in Engineering (GEM> at
the University of Notre Dame in South
Bend, IN.
Wells said "a successful education
enables one to get a feel for living with
others" but that Stanford has been unable
to provide such an education. She noted
that the racially charged incident at Otero
late in the spring indicated that Stanford
is an institution that "does not truly deal
with diversity."
Prompted by Wells' resignation, Gibbons
and University Affirmative Action Officer
Santiago Rodriguez met with several stu
dents from the Society of Black Scientists
and Engineers and the Society of Chicano
Engineers and Scientists to discuss future
programs for minorities in the school.
Gibbons said the school would give full
consideration to the student's demands.
Among other things, the students requested
that the school:
• immediately begin a "national search"
for Wells' permanent replacement,
• upgrade Wells' former position to asso

ciate dean for minority affairs,
• appoint a separate director for the Mi
nority Engineering Program,
• provide "more financial assistance and
better recruitment for minority graduate
students," and
• allot more building space to student or
ganzation offices.
In the past, Gibbons had said he would
like to "set up a committee that would
have significant representation from the
minority community to study the status
of minority programs in the engineering
school and make recommendations about
what the role of the senior officer should
be in them."
Asked about the effectiveness of such a
committee, Wells recalled a similar com
mittee formed in 1984, whose recommen
dations "were not put into action."
On the other hand, she said she believes
"Stanford is a great institution, and it can
and should take the lead in minority en
gineering."
She said many individuals were support
ive of her programs, but institutional sup

port for minorities was necessary to make
the University "a better place for the suc
cessful education of all students."
Following Wells' resignation, Gibbons
reaffirmed that the school's primary con
cern was "to provide the best environment
for excellence in academic work — instruc
tion and research — to all students."
He said now, the engineering school must
"pick up and continue to work for the best
education (we can provide our students)"
and that Hawthorn has "exactly the exper
ience needed" to fill Wells' position.
He said he was "personally concerned"
with minorities in engineering, and pointed
out that progress has been made for mi
nority students.
He pointed out that the school had
upgraded Wells' position from part-time to
full-time during his term as dean, besides
significantly increasing administrative sup
port for the position.
He noted that the engineering school in
creased expenditures on minority student
fellowships from about $100,000 a year to
just under $400,000 a year.
