# Plemel finds Paradise in Omaha
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
People may talk about "The
Road to Omaha." For Stanford
and Lee Plemel, the road to
Omaha was like a not-so-Divine
Comedy.
That road did end happily in
Paradise when Stanford won its
second-straight NCAA College
World Series, defeating Arizona
State, and Plemel was named the

CWS Most Outstanding Player.
But, that road began some
where in the midst of a midseason
Inferno during a three-game se
ries with — surprise, Arizona St.
Stanford was making a last
ditch effort for the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division title,
and was off to a good start when
it ended ASU's 23-game wining
streak April 23 to move into a tie
for the Six-Pac lead with the Sun
Devils.
On the mound the next day was
Lee Plemel. In perhaps the Car
dinal's biggest game of the season
to that point, the senior from
Laguna Hills, Calif., was knocked
out after 2-and-l/3 innings —
pasted for six hits and seven runs.
The defeat sent Stanford into a
tailspin in which it would lose
four of its next five Pac-10 games
and fall out of the race.
Plemel was already in a tailspin.
The loss was his fourth in five
decisions, dropping his record to
6-7.
It would get worse. Against
Fresno State in a non-conference
game, Plemel, demoted to the
bullpen, threw a ball into left field
trying to nail a runner at third
in the 10th inning and Stanford
lost, 6-5.
But a mere six weeks later,
Plemel is the MVP of a national
champion team. How? Previously,
there were not thought to be any
express lanes through Purgatory.
"I don't think I've done any
thing different with my ap
proach," Plemel said. "I think I
went through a period in the
middle of the season when I
wasn't as sharp as I was even at
the beginning. I think I've (since)
been a little bit sharper, had more
control of my pitches."

Plemel's midseason slump
rekindled his feast-or-famine rep
utation, which began in the 1987
CWS when he pitched a complete
game 6-1 win in the second round
but got knocked out of his next
start after just one-third of an
inning.
Fans stated this more simply
as, "Which Plemel will be pitching
today?"
"We had already had one loss,"
Plemel said of that his CWS game
in '87. "He (Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess) wasn't going to leave
me in. As soon as anything went
wrong he was going to get some
one else out there.... In that sit
uation, I did come out kind of
quick. But if it were a normal
game I wouldn't have come out
so soon.
"As far as this year," Plemel
said, "I've had outings where I
have gone out in the first inning
and I've done very poorly, or I've
gone out and pitched well and
been able to maintain it through
the game."
Plemel put an end to all the
questions after the Fresno St.
game. He pitched four scoreless
innings to gain a win over Pacific.
Then, as California made a bid to
knock the Cardinal out of second
place in the Six-Pac, Plemel
started and went all the way,
giving up only two earned runs.
Those two wins were the first
of a six-game streak with which
he closed out the season.
"Toward the end of the year I
started throwing a straight
change, which kind of gave me a
fourth pitch that I was getting
over the plate," Plemel said. "I
don't think it was a mental thing.
It was just kind of the way things

went in the games in the middle
of the season.
"Also there was the physical
part of it — I don't think I was
throwing as well at that time."
Rest seems to have been a key
for Plemel. Normally the opening
game starter of each series the
Cardinal played, Plemel was held
back until the third game of the
NCAA Northeast Regional against
Rutgers so that he would not be
called upon to come back quickly
and pitch again.
Plemel pitched a complete-game
8-1 win over the Scarlet Knights,
and when the Cardinal went on
to make the CWS, Plemel was
more than 100 percent ready. At
one point, Plemel said he was fully
capable of coming back and pitch
ing on two days rest in relief if
Stanford needed him.
"My arm is fully recovered from
any elbow soreness that I had,"
Plemel said.
Plemel won two complete-game
starts in Omaha, giving that once
sore elbow four complete games
out of its last six. He allowed only
four runs in 18 innings while
walking just five and striking out
10.
And as he sat on the bench
cheering on his teammates to the
title-clinching win, the media was
voting him Most Outstanding
Player.
"It's great. I've pitched in some
big games in the past, but this is
great coming into the series and
being the No. 1 pitcher."
Plemel leaves Stanford ranking
third all-time in wins, and second
in innings pitched and strikeouts,
to head for the St. Louis Car
dinals' organization, which picked
him in the eighth round.

game I wouldn't have come out
so soon.
"As far as this year," Plemel
said, "I've had outings where I
have gone out in the first inning
and I've done very poorly, or I've
gone out and pitched well and
been able to maintain it through
the game."
Plemel put an end to all the
questions after the Fresno St.
game. He pitched four scoreless
innings to gain a win over Pacific.
Then, as California made a bid to
knock the Cardinal out of second
place in the Six-Pac, Plemel
started and went all the way,
giving up only two earned runs.
Those two wins were the first
of a six-game streak with which
he closed out the season.
"Toward the end of the year I
started throwing a straight
change, which kind of gave me a
fourth pitch that I was getting
over the plate," Plemel said. "I
don't think it was a mental thing.
It was just kind of the way things

went in the games in the middle
of the season.
"Also there was the physical
part of it — I don't think I was
throwing as well at that time."
Rest seems to have been a key
for Plemel. Normally the opening
game starter of each series the
Cardinal played, Plemel was held
back until the third game of the
NCAA Northeast Regional against
Rutgers so that he would not be
called upon to come back quickly
and pitch again.
Plemel pitched a complete-game
8-1 win over the Scarlet Knights,
and when the Cardinal went on
to make the CWS, Plemel was
more than 100 percent ready. At
one point, Plemel said he was fully
capable of coming back and pitch
ing on two days rest in relief if
Stanford needed him.
"My arm is fully recovered from
any elbow soreness that I had,"
Plemel said.
Plemel won two complete-game
starts in Omaha, giving that once
sore elbow four complete games
out of its last six. He allowed only
four runs in 18 innings while
walking just five and striking out
10.
And as he sat on the bench
cheering on his teammates to the
title-clinching win, the media was
voting him Most Outstanding
Player.
"It's great. I've pitched in some
big games in the past, but this is
great coming into the series and
being the No. 1 pitcher."
Plemel leaves Stanford ranking
third all-time in wins, and second
in innings pitched and strikeouts,
to head for the St. Louis Car
dinals' organization, which picked
him in the eighth round.

victories to capture CWS Most Outstanding lMavcr honors.
People may talk about "The
Road to Omaha." For Stanford
and Lee Plemel, the road to
Omaha was like a not-so-Divine
Comedy.
That road did end happily in
Paradise when Stanford won its
second-straight NCAA College
World Series, defeating Arizona
State, and Plemel was named the

CWS Most Outstanding Player.
But, that road began some
where in the midst of a midseason
Inferno during a three-game se
ries with — surprise, Arizona St.
Stanford was making a last
ditch effort for the Pacific 10 Con
ference Southern Division title,
and was off to a good start when
it ended ASU's 23-game wining
streak April 23 to move into a tie
for the Six-Pac lead with the Sun
Devils.
On the mound the next day was
Lee Plemel. In perhaps the Car
dinal's biggest game of the season
to that point, the senior from
Laguna Hills, Calif., was knocked
out after 2-and-l/3 innings —
pasted for six hits and seven runs.
The defeat sent Stanford into a
tailspin in which it would lose
four of its next five Pac-10 games
and fall out of the race.
Plemel was already in a tailspin.
The loss was his fourth in five
decisions, dropping his record to
6-7.
It would get worse. Against
Fresno State in a non-conference
game, Plemel, demoted to the
bullpen, threw a ball into left field
trying to nail a runner at third
in the 10th inning and Stanford
lost, 6-5.
But a mere six weeks later,
Plemel is the MVP of a national
champion team. How? Previously,
there were not thought to be any
express lanes through Purgatory.
"I don't think I've done any
thing different with my ap
proach," Plemel said. "I think I
went through a period in the
middle of the season when I
wasn't as sharp as I was even at
the beginning. I think I've (since)
been a little bit sharper, had more
control of my pitches."

Plemel's midseason slump
rekindled his feast-or-famine rep
utation, which began in the 1987
CWS when he pitched a complete
game 6-1 win in the second round
but got knocked out of his next
start after just one-third of an
inning.
Fans stated this more simply
as, "Which Plemel will be pitching
today?"
"We had already had one loss,"
Plemel said of that his CWS game
in '87. "He (Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess) wasn't going to leave
me in. As soon as anything went
wrong he was going to get some
one else out there.... In that sit
uation, I did come out kind of
quick. But if it were a normal
game I wouldn't have come out
so soon.
"As far as this year," Plemel
said, "I've had outings where I
have gone out in the first inning
and I've done very poorly, or I've
gone out and pitched well and
been able to maintain it through
the game."
