# Miami muff gives Card 9th-inning win
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. - Miami (Fla.)
second baseman Jose Trujillo
threw away a potential inning
ending double play ball in the bot
tom of the ninth June 7 to hand
Stanford a 2-1 victory in the
NCAA College World Series.
The loss before 12,461 at
Rosenblatt Stadium eliminated
the Hurricanes from the CWS,
while it gave Stanford a chance
to pursue an almost impossible
dream — win three games in three
days in order to defend its na
tional title.

With the score 1-1, Stanford
senior Doug Robbins led off the
bottom of the ninth with the kind
of shot that makes one think twice
about allowing aluminum bats in
college baseball.
The ball shorthopped just in
front of Miami substitute third
baseman Mike Tosar and drilled
him inside his right knee. Tosar,
himself playing in place of the
injured Rob Word, crumpled to
the ground in pain.
Tosar was able to stay in the
game, but the hit, which landed
Robbins at first, did knock Miami
starter Will Vespe (5-1) out. Pete
Joseph came in from the bullpen.
Junior Ron Witmeyer sacrificed
Robbins to second, and Joseph
walked sophomore Brian Johnson
intentionally. That brought up
left-handed hitting designated hit
ter Jeff Saenger, who entered the
game earlier to bat against the
righthanded Vespe but now had
to face Joseph, a southpaw.
The ball Saenger hit to Trujillo,
who had made only six errors all
season, was an infielder's dream.
But if the CWS proved anything,
it proved that dreams die hard.
Trujillo side-tossed the ball over
to shortstop Jorge Robles, but the

toss was wide. Robles' momentum
carried him past the hall, which
went into left field.
Rohbins was waved home with
the winning run and the season
was over for Trujillo und the Hur
ricanes.
"I told |Trujillo] to pick his head
up," Miami Coach Ron Fraser
said. "Some of the plays he made
this year defensively ... if he

didn't make those plays we
wouldn't be here today."
It was an ironic ending in many
ways. It came one game after the
Cardinal made four sixth-inning
errors to allow Fullerton State to
come from behind and win, 5-3
on June 6. And it ended a game
that, until the last play, had been
defensive gem.
"It seemed when either team

would hit the ball well," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said,
"someone would make a great
catch."
The loss also gave a third
postseason win to perhaps Stan
ford's most "ironic" pitcher,
junior Steve Chitren.
Chitren (8-7) relieved freshman


Game 3


Richard Murphy — Daily
Senior Dour Bobbins can't believe he's out, but Miami center fielder John Viera did in fact run down
Kohhins' long drive to the warning track in the fourth inning of Stanford's 2-1 win over the Hurricanes.
starter Stan Spencer with two on
and two out in the seventh and
the score tied 1-1. In inimitable
Chitren feast-or-famine style, he
threw gas on this fire and started
two others before putting them
out.
After running the count to 3-2
and finally walking Tosar to load
the bases in the seventh, Chitren
wore down center fielder John
Viera, who watched strike three
go by.
In the eighth inning roller
coaster ride, Chitren struck out
Robles, walked Trujillo and Mike
Fiore, struck out Frank Domin
guez, and finally got pitcher
designated hitter Vespe to ground
out.
And in the ninth, Chitren went
walk, strikeout, walk to the first
three batters, but still managed
to escape.
Over half of Chitren's 41
pitches in preserving the tie (and
stranding seven Miami runners)
were balls.
"That's Chitren," Marquess
said. "To be honest with you, I
don't like to bring Chitren in un
less people are on base, because
if there's not anyone on base, he'll
put them there. I think he just
does it on purpose.
"But the thing about Chitren
that makes him difficult," Mar
quess went on, "is ... he puts the
offense at a predicament. [They]
say, 'Well, let's start taking a few
of these, and then [they] get be
hind. He's just wild enough to be
effective."
The game was scoreless until
the sixth when Viera led off and
sent a 2-2 Spencer offering over
the right-field wall. Miami led 1-0
and ESPN probably began pre
paring its Player of the Game
montage for Viera, who had al
ready made two great catches in
center.
The Cardinal's answer to Viera
came in the bottom of the inning
from both a likely and unlikely
source — call him ironic. Sopho
more Paul Carey was last year's
CWS Most Outstanding Player,
but was l-for-9 in the 1988 CWS
when he hit the first pitch of the
inning over the center field wall
to knot the score.
The drama continued to unfold
and then refold when Sprague
walked in the bottom of the eighth
and Carey sent a high fly to left

— similar to his heroic 1987 CWS
grand slam that had brought him
national notoriety.
But Miami's Mike Fiore caught
the ball just above the "You Can't
Beat the Feeling" sign in left, suf
fering a gash on his arm in the
process when it banged down
against the fence. Sprague was
then caught stealing to end the
inning.
Fiore's catch capped a game of
great defensive plays.
Stanford junior center fielder
Eric DeGraw opened the show in
the first. With Trujillo on third
and two out, DeGraw took advan
tage of the long 420-foot distance
to the wall in center to run down
a fly ball by Dominguez with a
runner on third to end the inning.
In the fourth, Stanford sopho
more Troy Paulsen was moving
from his shortstop position to
cover second on a steal attempt
when Dominguez sent a ground
ball behind him.
Paulsen dove back to glove the
ball and threw out the luckless
Dominguez. Vespe then struck out
to end the Hurricane threat.
In the fourth, Viera made an
even longer run than DeGraw's
to flag down Stanford senior Doug
Robbins' bid for extra bases. Rob
bins stood at second for several
moments, not believing he could
be out.
In the next inning, with two
out and DeGraw at third (he
reached base when hit by a pitch
in the back of his batting helmet),
Viera ran the other way to end
the inning by reaching Ed
Sprague's long drive. Both of
these drives probably would have
left Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
