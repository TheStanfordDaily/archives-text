# Miami muff gives Card 9th-inning win

### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. - Miami (Fla.)
second baseman Jose Trujillo
threw away a potential inning
ending double play ball in the bot
tom of the ninth June 7 to hand
Stanford a 2-1 victory in the
NCAA College World Series.
The loss before 12,461 at
Rosenblatt Stadium eliminated
the Hurricanes from the CWS,
while it gave Stanford a chance
to pursue an almost impossible
dream — win three games in three
days in order to defend its na
tional title.

With the score 1-1, Stanford
senior Doug Robbins led off the
bottom of the ninth with the kind
of shot that makes one think twice
about allowing aluminum bats in
college baseball.
The ball shorthopped just in
front of Miami substitute third
baseman Mike Tosar and drilled
him inside his right knee. Tosar,
himself playing in place of the
injured Rob Word, crumpled to
the ground in pain.
Tosar was able to stay in the
game, but the hit, which landed
Robbins at first, did knock Miami
starter Will Vespe (5-1) out. Pete
Joseph came in from the bullpen.
Junior Ron Witmeyer sacrificed
Robbins to second, and Joseph
walked sophomore Brian Johnson
intentionally. That brought up
left-handed hitting designated hit
ter Jeff Saenger, who entered the
game earlier to bat against the
righthanded Vespe but now had
to face Joseph, a southpaw.
The ball Saenger hit to Trujillo,
who had made only six errors all
season, was an infielder's dream.
But if the CWS proved anything,
it proved that dreams die hard.
Trujillo side-tossed the ball over
to shortstop Jorge Robles, but the

toss was wide. Robles' momentum
carried him past the hall, which
went into left field.
Rohbins was waved home with
the winning run and the season
was over for Trujillo und the Hur
ricanes.
"I told |Trujillo] to pick his head
up," Miami Coach Ron Fraser
said. "Some of the plays he made
this year defensively ... if he

didn't make those plays we
wouldn't be here today."
It was an ironic ending in many
ways. It came one game after the
Cardinal made four sixth-inning
errors to allow Fullerton State to
come from behind and win, 5-3
on June 6. And it ended a game
that, until the last play, had been
defensive gem.
"It seemed when either team

would hit the ball well," Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess said,
"someone would make a great
catch."
The loss also gave a third
postseason win to perhaps Stan
ford's most "ironic" pitcher,
junior Steve Chitren.
Chitren (8-7) relieved freshman


Game 3


Richard Murphy — Daily
Senior Dour Bobbins can't believe he's out, but Miami center fielder John Viera did in fact run down
Kohhins' long drive to the warning track in the fourth inning of Stanford's 2-1 win over the Hurricanes.
