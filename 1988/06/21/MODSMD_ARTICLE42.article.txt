# Fullerton felled by twin killing

OMAHA, Neb. — Stanford
turned the double play it didn't
turn before to get the victory it
didn't get before.
On the brink of elimination
from the NCAA College World Se
ries for the second game in a row,
Stanford avenged its earlier loss
in the CWS by defeating Fullerton
State 4-1 before 13,945 fans June
9 at Rosenblatt Stadium.

With the win, the Cardinal
forced a third contest the follow
ing night against Fullerton St. for
the right to play in the CWS title
game.
Senior Lee Flemel (12-8) capped
his Stanford career with a vir
tuoso performance — scattering
eight hits over nine innings to
win his sixth consecutive game.
In postseason play, Plemel was
3-0 with three complete games
and an ERA of 1.67.
Plemel induced — and com
pleted — the 3-6-1 double play
from .402-hitting Hrent Mavne
with the bases loaded and one out
in the eighth inning that closed
out the biggest Titan threat.
Fullerton St. already had one
run across on four hits and junior
Steve Chitren was warm in the
bullpen.
"I have a tendency to stay
(longer) with Lee," said Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess, citing
Plemel's experience as a factor.
"He had thrown some good
pitches to Mayne, and Mayne
hadn't gotten good swings off him.
