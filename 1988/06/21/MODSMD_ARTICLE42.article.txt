# Fullerton felled by twin killing

### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — Stanford
turned the double play it didn't
turn before to get the victory it
didn't get before.
On the brink of elimination
from the NCAA College World Se
ries for the second game in a row,
Stanford avenged its earlier loss
in the CWS by defeating Fullerton
State 4-1 before 13,945 fans June
9 at Rosenblatt Stadium.

With the win, the Cardinal
forced a third contest the follow
ing night against Fullerton St. for
the right to play in the CWS title
game.
Senior Lee Flemel (12-8) capped
his Stanford career with a vir
tuoso performance — scattering
eight hits over nine innings to
win his sixth consecutive game.
In postseason play, Plemel was
3-0 with three complete games
and an ERA of 1.67.
Plemel induced — and com
pleted — the 3-6-1 double play
from .402-hitting Hrent Mavne
with the bases loaded and one out
in the eighth inning that closed
out the biggest Titan threat.
Fullerton St. already had one
run across on four hits and junior
Steve Chitren was warm in the
bullpen.
"I have a tendency to stay
(longer) with Lee," said Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess, citing
Plemel's experience as a factor.
"He had thrown some good
pitches to Mayne, and Mayne
hadn't gotten good swings off him.


Game 4
1 was going to at least give him
that hitter."
Plemel knew Mayne might be
his last batter.
"1 was mostly thinking just to
get an out," Plemel said. "I got
two strikes on him, so the idea
was not to give him a good pitch
to hit. I got him to hit a curveball
that was down."
As easy as the double-play ball
that Mayne hit in the first
Cardinal-Titan CWS matchup
June 6 was to handle, this one
was tough. But while Stanford
fouled up the easy one to open
the floodgates of a disasterous in
ning, junior first baseman Ron
Witmeyer fielded this one smooth
ly-
On an 0-2 pitch, Mayne
grounded sharply to Witmeyer.
With Shane Flores, the runner on
first, almost directly in his path,
Witmeyer made a perfect throw
to sophomore Troy Paulsen at
short.
"It was a very difficult play that
Witmeyer made," Marquess said.

"That runner (Shane Flores) is
right in line with second base.
The safe thing is to go for first
base, but he went for the gusto
— and I'm glad he did." Paulsen
then threw back to Plemel at first,
who did the splits to nab Mayne.
"You only get one or two op
portunities (to beat good pitch
ing)," Fullerton St. Coach Larry
Cochell said. "When you've got
him on the ropes you've got to
put him away."
Though Plemel struggled
slightly at the end, he was phe
nomenal in the beginning. He al
lowed only one hit before the sixth
inning and used a mere 31 pitches
from the second through the fifth.
"He was going through real
quick innings," Flores said, "so
we wanted to take some pitches,
to make him work a little harder
— and then, he got ahead of us.
"He threw a great game. I ha
ven't seen much tougher all
season," he added.
Plemel had to be tough, because
since its opening-round 10-3 win
over Fresno State, Cardinal bats
were dormant. In the three fol
lowing games, Stanford hit just
.156 (14 for 90).
But Stanford benefited from

Titan errors in the field and on
the mound to score three un
earned runs on just one hit in
the second inning.
Sophomore Paul Carey reached
first when his grounder rolled
through Fullerton St. first base
man Keith Kaub's legs. One out
later, Witmeyer singled him to
second.
Titan starter Longo Garcia (10-
6) then walked sophomores Brian
Johnson and Tim Griffin to force
in the first run, and junior Eric
DeGraw reached base on a
fielder's choice to score Witmeyer.
On a 1-1 pitchout with junior
Frank Carey up, DeGraw broke
for second. Titan catcher Mayne
failed to look Johnson back to
third. DeGraw managed to dive
safely back into first while
Johnson stole home uncontested
to make it 3-0.
Paulsen, who made the error
on Mayne's grounder in the
teams' previous meeting, came up
with a big play in the sixth. With
Bobby Jones on first and one out,
Flores singled to right. Jones
made a wide turn at second with
Paulsen on the grass inside short
stop.
Paulsen charged in toward the

bag in front of Jones, grabbed a
perfect throw by Paul Carey and
tagged out Jones. Plemel then
struck out Mayne to end the in
ning.
Paulsen said he first learned
the play as a sophomore in high
school, but this was "the first time
it's worked in four years. I'll have
to give [my coach] a call and tell
him about it,"he said.
Stanford stranded six runners
after Witmeyer's homer, allowing
Fullerton St. to stay in the game.
And the Titans were very much
in it in the eighth.
With one out, Paul Carey dove
for but couldn't get Razook's
drive, which went for a double.
Jones and left fielder Greg Man
nion followed with singles to score
the Titans' only run.
As Chitren heated up in the
Cardinal bullpen, Flores singled
to load the bases, but then Plemel
got Mayne, who went hitless in
the game for only the second time
in his last 42.
"Really, that (double play) was
the key to the ballgame," Cochell
said.
Four teams — Stanford, Fuller
ton St., Arizona St.and Wichita
St., each with one loss — were

still left fighting for the title. Un
like Los Angeles Lakers Coach Pat
Riley, Marquess wasn't making
any guarantees about repeating
as champions. He was still
philosophical, however, about his
squad's chances.
"I don't think (playing under
the gun) bothers us," he said. "We
may get beat or not play well, but
we're not going to be tight.
"But I've never been able to
figure this team out."

OMAHA, Neb. — Stanford
turned the double play it didn't
turn before to get the victory it
didn't get before.
On the brink of elimination
from the NCAA College World Se
ries for the second game in a row,
Stanford avenged its earlier loss
in the CWS by defeating Fullerton
State 4-1 before 13,945 fans June
9 at Rosenblatt Stadium.

With the win, the Cardinal
forced a third contest the follow
ing night against Fullerton St. for
the right to play in the CWS title
game.
Senior Lee Flemel (12-8) capped
his Stanford career with a vir
tuoso performance — scattering
eight hits over nine innings to
win his sixth consecutive game.
In postseason play, Plemel was
3-0 with three complete games
and an ERA of 1.67.
Plemel induced — and com
pleted — the 3-6-1 double play
from .402-hitting Hrent Mavne
with the bases loaded and one out
in the eighth inning that closed
out the biggest Titan threat.
Fullerton St. already had one
run across on four hits and junior
Steve Chitren was warm in the
bullpen.
"I have a tendency to stay
(longer) with Lee," said Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess, citing
Plemel's experience as a factor.
"He had thrown some good
pitches to Mayne, and Mayne
hadn't gotten good swings off him.


Game 4
1 was going to at least give him
that hitter."
Plemel knew Mayne might be
his last batter.
"1 was mostly thinking just to
get an out," Plemel said. "I got
two strikes on him, so the idea
was not to give him a good pitch
to hit. I got him to hit a curveball
that was down."
As easy as the double-play ball
that Mayne hit in the first
Cardinal-Titan CWS matchup
June 6 was to handle, this one
was tough. But while Stanford
fouled up the easy one to open
the floodgates of a disasterous in
ning, junior first baseman Ron
Witmeyer fielded this one smooth
ly-
On an 0-2 pitch, Mayne
grounded sharply to Witmeyer.
With Shane Flores, the runner on
first, almost directly in his path,
Witmeyer made a perfect throw
to sophomore Troy Paulsen at
short.
"It was a very difficult play that
Witmeyer made," Marquess said.

"That runner (Shane Flores) is
right in line with second base.
The safe thing is to go for first
base, but he went for the gusto
— and I'm glad he did." Paulsen
then threw back to Plemel at first,
who did the splits to nab Mayne.
"You only get one or two op
portunities (to beat good pitch
ing)," Fullerton St. Coach Larry
Cochell said. "When you've got
him on the ropes you've got to
put him away."
Though Plemel struggled
slightly at the end, he was phe
nomenal in the beginning. He al
lowed only one hit before the sixth
inning and used a mere 31 pitches
from the second through the fifth.
"He was going through real
quick innings," Flores said, "so
we wanted to take some pitches,
to make him work a little harder
— and then, he got ahead of us.
"He threw a great game. I ha
ven't seen much tougher all
season," he added.
Plemel had to be tough, because
since its opening-round 10-3 win
over Fresno State, Cardinal bats
were dormant. In the three fol
lowing games, Stanford hit just
.156 (14 for 90).
But Stanford benefited from

Titan errors in the field and on
the mound to score three un
earned runs on just one hit in
the second inning.
Sophomore Paul Carey reached
first when his grounder rolled
through Fullerton St. first base
man Keith Kaub's legs. One out
later, Witmeyer singled him to
second.
Titan starter Longo Garcia (10-
6) then walked sophomores Brian
Johnson and Tim Griffin to force
in the first run, and junior Eric
DeGraw reached base on a
fielder's choice to score Witmeyer.
On a 1-1 pitchout with junior
Frank Carey up, DeGraw broke
for second. Titan catcher Mayne
failed to look Johnson back to
third. DeGraw managed to dive
safely back into first while
Johnson stole home uncontested
to make it 3-0.
Paulsen, who made the error
on Mayne's grounder in the
teams' previous meeting, came up
with a big play in the sixth. With
Bobby Jones on first and one out,
Flores singled to right. Jones
made a wide turn at second with
Paulsen on the grass inside short
stop.
Paulsen charged in toward the

bag in front of Jones, grabbed a
perfect throw by Paul Carey and
tagged out Jones. Plemel then
struck out Mayne to end the in
ning.
Paulsen said he first learned
the play as a sophomore in high
school, but this was "the first time
it's worked in four years. I'll have
to give [my coach] a call and tell
him about it,"he said.
Stanford stranded six runners
after Witmeyer's homer, allowing
Fullerton St. to stay in the game.
And the Titans were very much
in it in the eighth.
With one out, Paul Carey dove
for but couldn't get Razook's
drive, which went for a double.
Jones and left fielder Greg Man
nion followed with singles to score
the Titans' only run.
As Chitren heated up in the
Cardinal bullpen, Flores singled
to load the bases, but then Plemel
got Mayne, who went hitless in
the game for only the second time
in his last 42.
"Really, that (double play) was
the key to the ballgame," Cochell
said.
Four teams — Stanford, Fuller
ton St., Arizona St.and Wichita
St., each with one loss — were

still left fighting for the title. Un
like Los Angeles Lakers Coach Pat
Riley, Marquess wasn't making
any guarantees about repeating
as champions. He was still
philosophical, however, about his
squad's chances.
"I don't think (playing under
the gun) bothers us," he said. "We
may get beat or not play well, but
we're not going to be tight.
"But I've never been able to
figure this team out."
