In the end, it was as
easy as catching a
pop fly and falling
all over each other, but
rarely did Stanford have
it that easy in the 1988
NCAA College World Se
ries. After making six
errors in a game against
Fullerton State, Stan
ford was four games
from repeating as cham
pions but just one game
from elimination. An
errant toss by a Miami
infielder spawned a
change in the Cardinal's
fortunes, however. From
there, consistently great
pitching kept Stanford
in the hunt until the
Cardinal bats finally
propelled Stanford to
the top of the heap.
