# Card comes out on top in clash with Titans
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
OMAHA, Neb. — Breaking out
of a severe batting slump, the
Stanford baseball team scored in
all but three innings to earn its
place in the NCAA College World
Series title game with a 9-5 win
over Fullerton State June 10
before 15,103 onlookers at
Rosenblatt Stadium.
Stanford's win was the second
in two days over Fullerton St.,
having beaten the Titans 4-1 the
night before.

Perhaps inspired by its
championship-game opponent, Ar
izona State, which blasted Wichita
State in the afternoon semifinal
game, 19-1, the Cardinal broke
out for 10 hits after batting just
.169 in its last two games. And
the Cardinal hitters did it against
a pitcher, Mark Beck, who had
reduced them to four hits and 13
strikeouts just four days before.
"We were kind of laughing,"
junior Ron Witmeyer said. "They
had 23 hits in one game. We had
25 all series."
The offensive spurt was an en
couraging sign. Last year in
Omaha, through its first four
games en route to the 1987 CWS
title, Stanford batted just .222,
but leaped to a .338 average over
the final two games. The 1988
CWS nearly paralleled this, as
Stanford batted .200 in the first
four games, but moved up to .313
in this game.
Yet with all this renewed life
at the plate, Stanford did not take
the lead over Fullerton St. until
the bottom of the fifth inning.
With the score tied 3-3 sophomore
Tim Griffin singled to center to
lead off the inning. Junior Eric

DeGraw then laid down a sacrifice
bunt in front of the mound, but
Beck threw the ball too far inside
first base. By the time right fielder
Jim Osborn retrieved it, runners
were at second and third.
Junior Frank Carey, who was
in a l-for-12 mini-slump after a
month-long hot streak, stroked
the next Beck pitch into left for
an RBI single. Sophomore Troy
Paulsen followed with a sacrifice
fly to center to score DeGraw and
make it 5-3.
Fullerton St. came back in the
sixth with Mike Ross' 15th home
run of the year and a single by
Keith Kaub to knock out junior
middle-reliever Brian Keyser (who
relieved freshman starter Mike
Mussina in the fourth inning) and
close to within a run. But once
more, great pitching and defense
saved the Cardinal.
Junior relief ace Steve Chitren
came in and Brent Mayne tried
to sacrifice Kaub to second. His
bunt went right back to Chitren,
who threw down to Paulsen to
force Kaub. Paulsen's throw to
first was wild, but Frank Carey
came over to rebound the richoc
het off the wall to the right of
first base, fire back to Paulsen
and nab Mayne who was trying
to advance on the errant throw.
On the next pitch, Carey made
a diving stop of Osborn's
grounder and threw him out to
cap the inning.
Stanford did not loosen its grip
on the Titans. Sophomore Paul
Carey singled past a diving short
stop in the sixth and senior Doug
Robbins, previously 2-for-16 in
the CWS, doubled to the base of
the left field wall to score Carey
and make it 6-4.
Robbins later hit a three-run
home run, his 11th of the year,
to left field in the eighth to break
the game open and finally excise
Beck from the Cardinal's
memory.
"I did a bad job with the pitch
ing staff," Cochell said. "Common
sense told me [Beck] was done. I
gambled and lost; that was a mis
take on my part. You don't make
an emotional decision — you
make a factual decision."
Chitren gave up an unearned
run in the ninth but still finished
the game, going four innings —
and allowing no walks — to earn
his 10th save.
That's right, Chitren didn't
walk anybody. "I might throw a
party for myself later on," he said.
"It's quite unlike me."
Over the first three innings,
Fullerton St. threw up a picket
fence, scoring once in each against
Mussina.
With two out in the first, Titan
second-baseman Ross launched a
fly ball into the twilight sun in
right field. Rightfielder Paul
Carey got to it but obviously
couldn't see it well, as the ball
glanced off his glove. Ross was
credited with a double, and scored
on Kaub's single.
Osborn blasted an 0-1 fastball

high off the light-tower behind
the left- center field fence leading
off the second inning to make it
2-0.
Fullerton St. made a lot more
noise in the third but again settled
for one run. Greg Mannion led
off and doubled into a wide-open
right-center field gap. Hot-hitting
Shane Flores then singled him
home.
After a long conference at the
mound, Mussina stayed in and
worked the count to 3-2 to Ross.
Ross then took a called strike
three inside and Robbins threw
out Flores attempting to steal for
an unusual double play — it was
the fifth time out of six that Rob
bins had nailed daring runners
thus far in the CWS.

"Doug Robbins is as fine a
catcher as we've had at Stanford,"
Marquess said, "and we've had
some great catchers. Our pitchers
hold runners on well, but I think
the credit goes to Doug. He's got
a quick release and an accurate
throwing arm."
Meanwhile, Stanford twice
came back to forge ties. In the
second, Paul Carey reached on an
error by Ross. Carey stole second
and a soft liner by Witmeyer put
runners at the corners.
Sophomore Brian Johnson
popped out, but Witmeyer stole
second and sophomore Tim Grif
fin bounced a seeing-eye single
betwen first and second to tie the
game at 2-2.

Then, with Stanford down 3-2
with two out in the bottom of the
fourth, Witmeyer got his fifth hit
in his last seven at bats — his
team-leading eighth triple to right
— and Beck subsequently wild
pitched him home.
"It was critical that we let them
get back into the ballgame," Coc
hell said.
Marquess agreed. "Those runs
were real important. They gave
us a big lift — especially the way
we scored them."
Mussina was finally knocked
out in the fourth — the earliest
exit of his career — after giving
up a leadoff double to Mayne. But
Keyser sparkled in relief, retiring
the next three Titans in order to
keep Stanford close.

DeGraw then laid down a sacrifice
bunt in front of the mound, but
Beck threw the ball too far inside
first base. By the time right fielder
Jim Osborn retrieved it, runners
were at second and third.
Junior Frank Carey, who was
in a l-for-12 mini-slump after a
month-long hot streak, stroked
the next Beck pitch into left for
an RBI single. Sophomore Troy
Paulsen followed with a sacrifice
fly to center to score DeGraw and
make it 5-3.
Fullerton St. came back in the
sixth with Mike Ross' 15th home
run of the year and a single by
Keith Kaub to knock out junior
middle-reliever Brian Keyser (who
relieved freshman starter Mike
Mussina in the fourth inning) and
close to within a run. But once
more, great pitching and defense
saved the Cardinal.
Junior relief ace Steve Chitren
came in and Brent Mayne tried
to sacrifice Kaub to second. His
bunt went right back to Chitren,
who threw down to Paulsen to
force Kaub. Paulsen's throw to
first was wild, but Frank Carey
came over to rebound the richoc
het off the wall to the right of
first base, fire back to Paulsen
and nab Mayne who was trying
to advance on the errant throw.
On the next pitch, Carey made
a diving stop of Osborn's
grounder and threw him out to
cap the inning.
Stanford did not loosen its grip
on the Titans. Sophomore Paul
Carey singled past a diving short
stop in the sixth and senior Doug
Robbins, previously 2-for-16 in
the CWS, doubled to the base of
the left field wall to score Carey
and make it 6-4.
Robbins later hit a three-run
home run, his 11th of the year,
to left field in the eighth to break
the game open and finally excise
Beck from the Cardinal's
memory.
"I did a bad job with the pitch
ing staff," Cochell said. "Common
sense told me [Beck] was done. I
gambled and lost; that was a mis
take on my part. You don't make
an emotional decision — you
make a factual decision."
Chitren gave up an unearned
run in the ninth but still finished
the game, going four innings —
and allowing no walks — to earn
his 10th save.
That's right, Chitren didn't
walk anybody. "I might throw a
party for myself later on," he said.
"It's quite unlike me."
Over the first three innings,
Fullerton St. threw up a picket
fence, scoring once in each against
Mussina.
With two out in the first, Titan
second-baseman Ross launched a
fly ball into the twilight sun in
right field. Rightfielder Paul
Carey got to it but obviously
couldn't see it well, as the ball
glanced off his glove. Ross was
credited with a double, and scored
on Kaub's single.
Osborn blasted an 0-1 fastball

high off the light-tower behind
the left- center field fence leading
off the second inning to make it
2-0.
Fullerton St. made a lot more
noise in the third but again settled
for one run. Greg Mannion led
off and doubled into a wide-open
right-center field gap. Hot-hitting
Shane Flores then singled him
home.
After a long conference at the
mound, Mussina stayed in and
worked the count to 3-2 to Ross.
Ross then took a called strike
three inside and Robbins threw
out Flores attempting to steal for
an unusual double play — it was
the fifth time out of six that Rob
bins had nailed daring runners
thus far in the CWS.

"Doug Robbins is as fine a
catcher as we've had at Stanford,"
Marquess said, "and we've had
some great catchers. Our pitchers
hold runners on well, but I think
the credit goes to Doug. He's got
a quick release and an accurate
throwing arm."
Meanwhile, Stanford twice
came back to forge ties. In the
second, Paul Carey reached on an
error by Ross. Carey stole second
and a soft liner by Witmeyer put
runners at the corners.
Sophomore Brian Johnson
popped out, but Witmeyer stole
second and sophomore Tim Grif
fin bounced a seeing-eye single
betwen first and second to tie the
game at 2-2.

Then, with Stanford down 3-2
with two out in the bottom of the
fourth, Witmeyer got his fifth hit
in his last seven at bats — his
team-leading eighth triple to right
— and Beck subsequently wild
pitched him home.
"It was critical that we let them
get back into the ballgame," Coc
hell said.
Marquess agreed. "Those runs
were real important. They gave
us a big lift — especially the way
we scored them."
Mussina was finally knocked
out in the fourth — the earliest
exit of his career — after giving
up a leadoff double to Mayne. But
Keyser sparkled in relief, retiring
the next three Titans in order to
keep Stanford close.


Game 5

Junior Steve Chitren and senior Dour Kobhins (foreground) exchange high-fives after Chitrcn's dazzling
four-inning relief effort preserved Stanford's 9-5 victory over Fullerton St. The win catapulted the
Cardinal into the championship game.
OMAHA, Neb. — Breaking out
of a severe batting slump, the
Stanford baseball team scored in
all but three innings to earn its
place in the NCAA College World
Series title game with a 9-5 win
over Fullerton State June 10
before 15,103 onlookers at
Rosenblatt Stadium.
Stanford's win was the second
in two days over Fullerton St.,
having beaten the Titans 4-1 the
night before.

Perhaps inspired by its
championship-game opponent, Ar
izona State, which blasted Wichita
State in the afternoon semifinal
game, 19-1, the Cardinal broke
out for 10 hits after batting just
.169 in its last two games. And
the Cardinal hitters did it against
a pitcher, Mark Beck, who had
reduced them to four hits and 13
strikeouts just four days before.
"We were kind of laughing,"
junior Ron Witmeyer said. "They
had 23 hits in one game. We had
25 all series."
The offensive spurt was an en
couraging sign. Last year in
Omaha, through its first four
games en route to the 1987 CWS
title, Stanford batted just .222,
but leaped to a .338 average over
the final two games. The 1988
CWS nearly paralleled this, as
Stanford batted .200 in the first
four games, but moved up to .313
in this game.
Yet with all this renewed life
at the plate, Stanford did not take
the lead over Fullerton St. until
the bottom of the fifth inning.
With the score tied 3-3 sophomore
Tim Griffin singled to center to
lead off the inning. Junior Eric

Over the first three innings,
Fullerton St. threw up a picket
fence, scoring once in each against
Mussina.
With two out in the first, Titan
second-baseman Ross launched a
fly ball into the twilight sun in
right field. Rightfielder Paul
Carey got to it but obviously
couldn't see it well, as the ball
glanced off his glove. Ross was
credited with a double, and scored
on Kaub's single.
Osborn blasted an 0-1 fastball

high off the light-tower behind
the left- center field fence leading
off the second inning to make it
2-0.
Fullerton St. made a lot more
noise in the third but again settled
for one run. Greg Mannion led
off and doubled into a wide-open
right-center field gap. Hot-hitting
Shane Flores then singled him
home.
After a long conference at the
mound, Mussina stayed in and
worked the count to 3-2 to Ross.
Ross then took a called strike
three inside and Robbins threw
out Flores attempting to steal for
an unusual double play — it was
the fifth time out of six that Rob
bins had nailed daring runners
thus far in the CWS.

"Doug Robbins is as fine a
catcher as we've had at Stanford,"
Marquess said, "and we've had
some great catchers. Our pitchers
hold runners on well, but I think
the credit goes to Doug. He's got
a quick release and an accurate
throwing arm."
Meanwhile, Stanford twice
came back to forge ties. In the
second, Paul Carey reached on an
error by Ross. Carey stole second
and a soft liner by Witmeyer put
runners at the corners.
Sophomore Brian Johnson
popped out, but Witmeyer stole
second and sophomore Tim Grif
fin bounced a seeing-eye single
betwen first and second to tie the
game at 2-2.

Then, with Stanford down 3-2
with two out in the bottom of the
fourth, Witmeyer got his fifth hit
in his last seven at bats — his
team-leading eighth triple to right
— and Beck subsequently wild
pitched him home.
"It was critical that we let them
get back into the ballgame," Coc
hell said.
Marquess agreed. "Those runs
were real important. They gave
us a big lift — especially the way
we scored them."
Mussina was finally knocked
out in the fourth — the earliest
exit of his career — after giving
up a leadoff double to Mayne. But
Keyser sparkled in relief, retiring
the next three Titans in order to
keep Stanford close.
