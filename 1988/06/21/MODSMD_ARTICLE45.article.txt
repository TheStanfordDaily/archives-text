# College World Series Notes

### 
In order to ensure receiving the $500,000
CBS paid to televise the CWS champion
ship, the NCAA had to guarantee that the
game would be played at a specific time,
unlike past years when double elmination
left that in doubt.
So the NCAA Division I baseball sub
committee, of which Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess is a member, devised the two
bracket formula used this year.
People objected to the new format for
two reasons. It meant that a team that
won the first game only needed to win
three straight over six or seven days to
win the CWS, but a team that lost the
first game had to win five straight over
the same time.
The second objection with the division
format was that teams didn't play a variety
of opponents as in past years. Marquess,
however, said playing a team repeatedly
creates fan interest, and that further down
the road the championship affair may be
come a best-of-three.
Last year, Stanford played five of the

other seven teams in the CWS, playing
only one (Oklahoma State) twice. This year,
Stanford and Fullerton State (and Arizona
State and Wichita State) played each other
three times — the Titans and Shockers
played only one other opponent each.
CBS announcer Brent Mils
burner was in the stands June 8 and was
introduced to the crowd by the public ad
dress announcer, Jack Payne. Musburger
was soundly booed. Payne then suggested
over the PA that Musburger not attempt
to run for public office in Omaha.
In an opening-round game June 3, top
seed Arizona State took advantage of Cal
ifornia's trust, or perhaps naivete, to notch
a 4-2 win.
ASU Coach Jim Brock had said in the
pre-CWS news conference that he would
"dance with the guy that brung him,"
which to everyone meant he would be start
ing right-hander Linty Ingram, who led
the nation in 1988 with 17 wins.
Cal prepared to face the righty, but just

hours before the game, ASU an
nounced that its starter would be
lefty Rusty Kilgo, who hadn't
started in over a year.
That left Cal Coach Bob Milano
fuming after the game not just
over the three Bears thrown out
on the basepaths, but over the
ploy by Brock.
Brock denied any unsportsman
like conduct but also said, "If it
meant sacrificing 20 years of good
relations to win this game, I
would have done it."
Ingram, as it turned out, was
a poor choice as a starter. In two
starts against Wichita State, In
gram lasted two innings total, al
lowing 13 of 19 batters to reach
base and compiling an ERA of
36.00
In this year of Dave Pallone

and the umpire wars, it was sur
prising to see the CWS umpires:
Jon Bible, Jim Carman, Ron
Craham, Rusty Herring, Bob
Jones and Dale Williams, play
such enthusiastic foils to the an
tics of the Miami Maniac, the
CWS official mascot/nuisance.
Twice the Maniac and the umps
teamed up to dance the "Hokey
Pokey" of all things.
In the first championship game
meeting ever between two teams
from the same conference, ASU
became only the second team to
lose four CWS Championship
games. The other is Oklahoma
State, which was top-ranked most
of 1988 but was eliminated by
Wichita St.in the Midwest Re
gional.
Finally, to answer the thought
to-be-unanswerable question,
Rosenblatt Stadium was named
Johnny Rosenblatt, former mayor
of Omaha.
