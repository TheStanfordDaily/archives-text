In order to ensure receiving the $500,000
CBS paid to televise the CWS champion

unlike past years when double elmination
left that in doubt.
So the NCAA Division I baseball sub
committee, of which Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess is a member, devised the two

People objected to the new format for

a 4-2 win.
ASU Coach Jim Brock had said in the
pre-CWS news conference that he would
