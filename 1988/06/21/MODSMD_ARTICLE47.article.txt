"In the middle of
the year . . . we'd
play great one day
and horrendous the

to put it together

out."

"I remember the
coaches saying to us
after a couple of
really hard losses
toward the end of
the year, 'If you
guys think it's just
going to come to

regional starts, you
guys got another
thing coming — it
doesn't work that
way.' But the funny
thing is, it did. We
put it together the
last weekend of the
season."

"It was harder for

end, though. At the

we could win
games. Plemel

come out each day
and I could see we
were playing well
and ready to go.
