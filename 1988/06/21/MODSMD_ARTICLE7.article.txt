# Maynard tells grads: 'Learn about equity'
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Commencement speaker Robert
Maynard urged the graduating
class of 1988 to continue learning
about the issues of race, age and
gender equity to improve society
in the 21st century.
Speaking before a crowd of
about 4,400 graduates and 30,000
wellwishers gathered in the Stan
ford Stadium .June 12, the editor
and publisher of the Tribune in
Oakland stressed that the un
finished work begun in the civil
rights movement of the 1960s
must be completed by the next
generation.
"The 1940s and 1950s were
decades of terror for people of
color all over the United States.
It may be difficult for those of
you wiio were born in a later dec
ade ... to know that there was
a time in the 1940s and 1950s
when citizens routinely lost their
lives in lynchings. particularly in
the Deep South and southwestern

part of the United States, where
the denial of fundamental human
rights was a way of life."
Fighting against centuries of
prejudice has made the United
States a better place, Maynard
argued.
At one of the several points in
his speech that drew applause,
Maynard urged graduates to re
memher that "to preserve that
liberty means to preserve the ed
ucated and learned society that
can appreciate the blessings of
freedom that have been passed on
to us."
The crowd also burst into an
enthusiastic show of support when
Maynard likened the struggles of
women in society to those of
"peoples of color."
"It was common in my mid
century upbringing for people to
say, and be serious, that a wom
an's place is in the home. It never
occurred to them to think of a

as a meeting at the "crossroads" of two centuries, Maynard told
graduates that as they enter the 21st century they must carry the
battles begun by his own generation with them.
the Senate or the White House,"
he said.
"Just as it is true that the res
olution of problems of race in our
society has just begun, so it is
true that the full participation of
women in our society has only
just begun to be recognized for
the rich potential it will be in
making us a better society."
Maynard also stressed that new
problems — including child and
elder care — promise to pose un
precedented quandries for the
leaders of the next generation.
"I am particularly struck as I
see the new shape of the family,
by the desperate need for under
standing how we will provide ap
propriate child care and early
childhood development training in
an entirely different arena from
the one in which I was raised."
Saying that "the times have
changed" from the period when
mothers were expected to stay at
home while fathers went to work
each day, Maynard added that
"the preservation of family under
these new circumstances will re
quire us to engage in some careful
policy planning as well as some
rethinking of our own private
agendas as we get to understand
how to become a more inclusive
society."
Maynard also told graduates
that when they cross the line into
the 21st century "the issue of age
will become ever more important
as a social and political and eco
nomic challenge to our society."
"Now I have to tell you the
issue of age in our society is
remarkable in the degree to which
one's perspective on it changes
over time. Those in their 20s are
less likely to recognize the ur
gency of these questions as per

sons my age or older," he said.
Maynard said the issue boils
down largely to the question of
the distribution of health care in
society. "The rise of the new tech
nologies that make extension of
life possible raise questions as to
whether you in your generation
will face a new set of policy deci
sions called 'who shall live and

"Your generation will
face a new set of policy
decisions called 'who
shall live and who
shall die.' "

who shall die.' "
Maynard said the only way
graduates can adequately prepare
themselves to make these deci
sions is by continuing to educate
themselves about the issues.
"When you see a society in
which the video screen has become
the great teacher and the univer
sity and the high school are strug
gling to find ways to attract the
attention of students, you must
worry about the erosion of that
fundamental tenet that reading
and learning are the precursors
to any effective reasoning and
that in a free society, a self
governing society, where the cit
izen is sovereign, an ill-informed
and ignorant citizen may very well
be a danger to all of us."
Impressing graduates with
their obligation to use and share
the blessings of their own educa
tions, Maynard exhorted students
to remember that "every human
being, regardless of color or
gender, who is denied an oppor
tunity in our society is a resource
gone to waste, and we cannot af
ford to waste resources."

about 4,400 graduates and 30,000
wellwishers gathered in the Stan
ford Stadium .June 12, the editor
and publisher of the Tribune in
Oakland stressed that the un
finished work begun in the civil
rights movement of the 1960s
must be completed by the next
generation.
"The 1940s and 1950s were
decades of terror for people of
color all over the United States.
It may be difficult for those of
you wiio were born in a later dec
ade ... to know that there was
a time in the 1940s and 1950s
when citizens routinely lost their
lives in lynchings. particularly in
the Deep South and southwestern

part of the United States, where
the denial of fundamental human
rights was a way of life."
Fighting against centuries of
prejudice has made the United
States a better place, Maynard
argued.
At one of the several points in
his speech that drew applause,
Maynard urged graduates to re
memher that "to preserve that
liberty means to preserve the ed
ucated and learned society that
can appreciate the blessings of
freedom that have been passed on
to us."
The crowd also burst into an
enthusiastic show of support when
Maynard likened the struggles of
women in society to those of
"peoples of color."
"It was common in my mid
century upbringing for people to
say, and be serious, that a wom
an's place is in the home. It never
occurred to them to think of a
woman's place in the House, or

land, urged 1«»SS graduates to fight racial, gender and age inequality.
Describing his speech at Stanford's 97th Commencement exercises
as a meeting at the "crossroads" of two centuries, Maynard told
graduates that as they enter the 21st century they must carry the
battles begun by his own generation with them.
the Senate or the White House,"
he said.
"Just as it is true that the res
olution of problems of race in our
society has just begun, so it is
true that the full participation of
women in our society has only
just begun to be recognized for
the rich potential it will be in
making us a better society."
Maynard also stressed that new
problems — including child and
elder care — promise to pose un
precedented quandries for the
leaders of the next generation.
"I am particularly struck as I
see the new shape of the family,
by the desperate need for under
standing how we will provide ap
propriate child care and early
childhood development training in
an entirely different arena from
the one in which I was raised."
Saying that "the times have
changed" from the period when
mothers were expected to stay at
home while fathers went to work
each day, Maynard added that
"the preservation of family under
these new circumstances will re
quire us to engage in some careful
policy planning as well as some
rethinking of our own private
agendas as we get to understand
how to become a more inclusive
society."
Maynard also told graduates
that when they cross the line into
the 21st century "the issue of age
will become ever more important
as a social and political and eco
nomic challenge to our society."
"Now I have to tell you the
issue of age in our society is
remarkable in the degree to which
one's perspective on it changes
over time. Those in their 20s are
less likely to recognize the ur
gency of these questions as per

sons my age or older," he said.
Maynard said the issue boils
down largely to the question of
the distribution of health care in
society. "The rise of the new tech
nologies that make extension of
life possible raise questions as to
whether you in your generation
will face a new set of policy deci
sions called 'who shall live and

"Your generation will
face a new set of policy
decisions called 'who
shall live and who
shall die.' "

who shall die.' "
Maynard said the only way
graduates can adequately prepare
themselves to make these deci
sions is by continuing to educate
themselves about the issues.
"When you see a society in
which the video screen has become
the great teacher and the univer
sity and the high school are strug
gling to find ways to attract the
attention of students, you must
worry about the erosion of that
fundamental tenet that reading
and learning are the precursors
to any effective reasoning and
that in a free society, a self
governing society, where the cit
izen is sovereign, an ill-informed
and ignorant citizen may very well
be a danger to all of us."
Impressing graduates with
their obligation to use and share
the blessings of their own educa
tions, Maynard exhorted students
to remember that "every human
being, regardless of color or
gender, who is denied an oppor
tunity in our society is a resource
gone to waste, and we cannot af
ford to waste resources."
