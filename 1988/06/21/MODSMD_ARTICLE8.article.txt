# County approves research facility
## Foes of animal research worry about environmental issues 
### Eric Richardson Editorial staff 
After a year-long dispute be
tween the University and oppo
nents of animal research, Stan
ford won unanimous approval
last week from the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors to
build a new $18 million animal
research facility on the West
Campus.
The facility, to be called RAF
11, will be a state-of-the-art ex
tension of the current under
ground facility near the Stan
ford Medical Center. The facility
will consolidate research — pri
marily on rodents — now con
ducted at 15 different campus
locations.
County approval means that
construction of the facility can
begin August 1.
Representatives of the Uni
versity and the Palo Alto
Humane Society used last
week's hearing as a final chance

to throw verbal daggers at each
other in the course of a lengthy
battle — which Stanford claims
has cost it $1.3 million in con
struction delays and additional
research costs, including the
preparation of an Environmen
tal Impact Report.
Lise Giraud, a member of the
Humane society and a former
University employee, accused
Stanford of "a worrisome lack
of commitment to health and
safety issues." On the other side
of the aisle, Gwendolyn Creary,
a member of the patients' rights
group Incurably 111 for Animal
Research, called members of the
Humane Society "bag women
for terrorists and murderers."
In an effort to heal the rift
between the University and op
ponents of the new facility, Su
pervisor Dianne McKenna pro
posed a "Good Neighbor Com
mittee" to improve relations be
tween Stanford and the local
community.

McKenna said the committee
should help to improve commu
nity relations for the opening of
RAF II and other facilities at
Stanford over the next several
years. The committee would in
clude representatives from the
University, the Humane Society
and local homeowners's groups;
McKenna's staff would serve as
a mediator for the groups.
But Helen McCloskey, presi
dent of the Palo Alto Humane
Society, said she was unsure
whether the non-binding com
mittee would sufficiently meet
the society's interest in halting
construction of the facility.
"The Good Neighbor Commit
tee is not going to get to the
issues," McCloskey said. "The
groups are supposed to get to
gether to watch the building go
up."
Stanford Project Manager
Kyle Glenn said the EIR proves
"conclusively that RAF II will
not cause these hazards."
