### William Kasumi 
As the first black dean of a
major school here, newly ap
pointed Humanities and Sciences
Dean Ewart Thomas said he hopes
to create a more egalitarian at
mosphere for minorities at Stan
ford.
Replacing former Dean Norm
Wessells, who will become the
University of Oregon's provost
this fall, Thomas will serve as act
ing dean this summer and offi
cially step into his role Sept. 1.
With 452 faculty members, Hu
manities and Sciences is the larg
est of Stanford's seven schools.
A native of Guyana, Thomas
received his doctorate from
Cambridge University. Thomas
said he will try to hire more mi
nority faculty members while
recognizing the limits of a dean's
power.
He pointed to hiring difficulties
he experienced in the past when
he was chair of Stanford's Depart
ment of Psychology. The 45-year

old Thomas said the failure of
some undergraduate programs to
encourage minorities contributed
to the shortage of qualified mi
nority candidates.
