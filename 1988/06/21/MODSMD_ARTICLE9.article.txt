### William Kasumi 
As the first black dean of a
major school here, newly ap
pointed Humanities and Sciences
Dean Ewart Thomas said he hopes
to create a more egalitarian at
mosphere for minorities at Stan
ford.
Replacing former Dean Norm
Wessells, who will become the
University of Oregon's provost
this fall, Thomas will serve as act
ing dean this summer and offi
cially step into his role Sept. 1.
With 452 faculty members, Hu
manities and Sciences is the larg
est of Stanford's seven schools.
A native of Guyana, Thomas
received his doctorate from
Cambridge University. Thomas
said he will try to hire more mi
nority faculty members while
recognizing the limits of a dean's
power.
He pointed to hiring difficulties
he experienced in the past when
he was chair of Stanford's Depart
ment of Psychology. The 45-year

old Thomas said the failure of
some undergraduate programs to
encourage minorities contributed
to the shortage of qualified mi
nority candidates.

However, he added that the
University's new Cultures, Ideas
and Values requirement will help
Stanford recruit minority faculty.
Thomas also said that he will
try to work with the University
Committee on Minority Issues —
which is currently investigating
the state of minority life on
campus — to help solve race
related problems.
When asked if his own minority
status contributed to his promo
tion, Thomas said his appointment
was "too important to give to
someone based on his race, or for
that matter, his height."
"[Thomasl has been associate
dean, the representative for the
University in the national Centen
nial celebrations and chair of the
Psychology Department," Rosse
said.
"The deanship of the School for
Humanities and Sciences is an im
portant position. .. .We take into
account all possible criteria, most
important of which is leadership,
in which [Thomasl has demon
strated great capacity."
Despite the executive duties as
sociated with his new role,
Thomas said he sees himself more
as a teacher than an administra
tor.
