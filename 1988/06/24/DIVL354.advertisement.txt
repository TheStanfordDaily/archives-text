"Karate is the best
thing I ever did for
my child!"
Mrs. Denise Watson, San Jose
Although we often receive
comments like Mrs. Watson's, we
continually strive to do even
better because every child
deserves the very best chance at
life. And, we know that our
programs can'greatly improve
our students' chances for
happiness and success.
"My son was a real handful. He
wouldn't mind me or his teachers. I'm a
single mothe. and needed help with him.
Master Mather gave him self discipline
and control. I can't tell you what a
change it's made in his life ... and mine."
Estelle Connor, Santa Clara
"I was already a black belt when I
moved here, so I knew what to look for. I
visited every club in the valley. I chose
CKA because they were clearty superior
— there was no comparison."
Fred Stewart, San Jose

"I drive my son all the way in from San
Mateo because Master Mather teaches
so much more than just self defense.
And in this day and age, our kids
desperately need what he gives them."
Mrs. Judy Morgan, San Mateo
"All my friends at school were doing
drugs — cocaine and pot mostly You
were a chicken if you didn't. Karate
helped me become strong enough to
stay off it so I could keep working
towards getting into college "
Greg Pegilow, Milpitas
