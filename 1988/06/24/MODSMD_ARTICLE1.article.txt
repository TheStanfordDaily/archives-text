# University criticizes Otero vigil
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Refusing to accept ignorance of
racial matters as an excuse, a com
prehensive University report
criticizes seven students whose
protest evoked images of the Ku
Klux Klan in May.
The protestors' presumed ig
norance is "a kind of passive
malice," said Director of Residen
tial Deans Diana Conklin in her
report, which is based on inter
views with the Stanford police,
vigii protestors and eye-witnesses.
Released and updated in early
June, the report responds to the
continued confusion surrounding
the actions of seven members of
the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity
who congregated outside of Otero
House on May 24 to protest the
University's eviction of an Otero
resident, Kenny Ehrman. Ehrman
was evicted for making homopho
bic and sexist remarks throughout
the year.
Protesting what they saw as an
infringement of Ehrman's free
dom of speech, the students wore
masks, carried burning candles
and held a silent midnight vigil
outside the dorm. The demonstra
tors said they did not realize their
protest might be considered
racist.
But unlike Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons' May 24 report
on the vigil, Conklin's report does
not conclude that the allegedly
racist method of protest was un
intentional.
Conklin's report urges the Uni
versity to "combat ignorance"
which continues to jeopardize "the
dignity of the individual."
Conklin said the recent resig
nation of Asst. Dean of Engineer
ing Linda Wells is "part of the
same issue" as the the night vigil.
Wells said she resigned because
Stanford does not respond to the
needs of minorities on campus.
Conklin's report calls for the
establishment of "more formal
and informal courses that will
combat ignorance and insensitiv
ity."
Over the summer, Conklin and
other University officials will
brainstorm to create better edu
cational methods to "combat ig
norance," she said.
According to Fraternal Affairs
Advisor Joe Pisano, presidents of
both the interfraternity and the
intersorority councils will work
with him this summer to compile

a "cross-cultural presentation"
that fraternity pledges will see
during the first week of school.
The presentation "will address
what the climate is for people of
color and other minority groups"
on campus, Pisano explained. "As
soon as they walk in the door, a
message will be sent to new
pledges."
To counteract the hype sur
rounding the Otero vigil, Pisano
said "we know we have a lot of

work to do."
According to Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson, the
University must develop a more
"anticipatory response" to dis
crimination.
Robinson said he has difficulty
targeting where problems exist at
Stanford because the campus is
large and "decentralized." A pri
mary goal this summer to develop
educational programs that re
spond to discrimination before it
spreads, he said.
