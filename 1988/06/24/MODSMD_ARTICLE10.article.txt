### 
WASHINGTON - The wife of
former Asst. Navy Secretary Mel
vyn Paisley was paid by a defense
consulting firm established by a
key figure in the Pentagon con
tract fraud scandal, while her hus
band still was the powerful chief
of Navy procurement in the Pen
tagon, the Los Angeles Times has
learned.
Federal and state records show
that Vicki Paisley received as
much as $50,000 in 1986 from
VAMO, Inc., a Virginia consulting
company formed early that year
by William Galvin, a defense con
sultant whose offices were
searched recently by FBI inves
tigators.
At the time, Mrs. Paisley was
receiving what financial dis
closure documents described as
"compensation for services" from
his company, Galvin was repre
senting a number of defense con
tractors doing business with the
Navy Department.

Mrs. Paisley also worked aa an
employee and consultant for BDM
International Corp., a major
Virginia-based defense contractor,
beginning less than two years
after her husband took the Pen
tagon post as top deputy to Navy
Secretary John Lehman.
In a memorandum dated Feb.
5, 1987, and turned over to
reporters by the Navy this week,
Melvyn Paisley said that he had
disqualified himself from partici
pation "in any matters involving
BDM Company" at the time his
wife joined BDM in April 1983.
The Navy did not provide the
memorandum that Paisley said he
had prepared then.
Paisley is the highest-ranking
former or current Pentagon offi
cial known to be a target of the
investigation, which involves
widespread fraud and bribery
across all branches of military
service.
