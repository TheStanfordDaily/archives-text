Soviet Mideast policy questioned
WASHINGTON â€” The Reagan administration,
breaking sharply with a long-standing U.S. policy
of trying to minimize Soviet influence in the
Middle East, is urging Moscow to help mediate
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Such a step could require the Soviets to make
the same sort of controversial choices that the
United States frequently has had to make in
recent years.
Frustrated administration officials maintain
that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has been
able to pose as a potential peacemaker without
having to advance specific proposals that might
alienate pro-Soviet regimes in the Arab world.
These officials contrast the Soviet performance,
which they say consists largely of slogans and
generalities, with Secretary of State George F.
Shultz's Middle East peace plan, which was de
signed to set out specific compromises that Israel
and its Arab adversaries could accept. The plan
turned out to be so evenly balanced that both
sides objected to it on grounds that it was too
favorable to the other.
"We should get the Soviets to be more specific

about what kind of peace process they want,"
one official said. "If they refuse to give answers,
the people in the region should know that."
Experts: Mars was a greenhouse
In its early history, Mars was a warm planet
with a much denser atmosphere than it has today,
according to scientists who say the discovery con
stitutes strong evidence that the red planet could
have supported some form of primitive life in its
early years.
The scientists, who reported their findings in
today's issue of the journal "Science," determined
that hydrogen escaped from Mars' atmosphere
at a much faster pace in the early years than it
does today.
The discovery should fuel a growing suspicion
among scientists that Mars and Earth were very
much alike during the first billion or so years
when life began to develop on Earth. If life
emerged so early on Earth, many scientists now
believe, it could well have done so on Mars when
conditions there were similar.
