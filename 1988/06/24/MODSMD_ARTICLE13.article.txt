Students stressed
by end-of-year rush

Your mission, should
you choose to accept it,
is to take four finals
in six days while also
frenetically packing your
belongings into boxes and
suitcases. After your last
final you will have only 14
hours to be out of your Stan
ford dorm. Good luck. . . .
Stanford must stop forc
ing students to accept thjs
Mission Impossible.
For students across the
country it is hard enough to
take successive finals over
short periods of time, but
Stanford increases this pres
sure exponentially by re
quiring students to pack
their bags when they should
be studying.
Graduating seniors face
even tighter schedules in the
spring.
For many seniors, gradu
ation ended Sunday at 5
p.m. with a 10 a.m. checkout
time the following morning.
While the evening should
have been spent enjoying the
day's once-in-a-lifetime
event, many spent it pack
ing.
And for the rest of the
student body who have
finals until 10 p.m. Wednes
day, it just isn't enough to
get an extension to Thurs
day at 4 p.m. from the nor
mal noon deadline. Aside

from the hassle of applying
for this privilege, the extra
hours only add up to 18,
less eight hours sleeping
time, for a student to tie up
loose ends, pack and get out.
By clearing the way for
new students and top-dollar
summer conference partici
pants, University officials
are sending the message
that economics come before
academics.
Furthermore, they ignore
the fact that students have
already paid more than
enough to claim sufficient
time in University housing.
Granted, the money Stan
ford makes from confer
ences is used to reduce stu
dents' room rates, but fos
tering an environment con
ducive to studies should be
one of the University's pri
mary concerns.
A solution to this time
crunch may be the empty
day at the start of spring
quarter.
Though classes currently
start on a Tuesday, the Uni
versity could bump this date
up to Monday by making
registration services avail
able to students the preced
ing Sunday. Finals would
then end on a Tuesday, al
lowing students an extra day
to mop up after finals.
.. . the taped message is
winding down toward self
destruct, and with its explo
sion, student sanity may
evaporate in a cloud of
smoke and flame.
