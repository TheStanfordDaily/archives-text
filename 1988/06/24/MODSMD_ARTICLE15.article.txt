## Reflecting on the lazy summer ahead 
### 
I love the feeling of the first
day of summer. Kinda like
your first bite into a nice juicy
peach knowing you've got a whole
box left to eat.
On my first day home from
school last week (which for me is
always the official start of sum
mer), I was driving to my old job,
drooling over'the gorgeous weath
er. It was one of those days Stan
ford students write home about,
where spring meets summer and
they chat over a late lunch. I was
going to my old job because my
three large donations to Stanford
over the last nine months had left
me kind of short on cash. I was
hoping my old boss remembered
me.
Coming off the freeway I shifted
into third gear, as a brand new
convertible rabbit sporting a
"Noriega/Bush 88" bumper
sticker zoomed by in the right
hand lane. You'll never guess who
was driving it . . . Jim Steyer, lec
turer for the popular spring quar
ter class U.S. Civil Rights and
Civil Liberties.
Jim flys by shirtless (nice tan),
laughing with someone on the
other end of his cellular phone.
Where was he headed? Some

liberal function? My reporter's in
stinct kicked way into overdrive.
I put the pedal to the metal of
my Japanese tin can (i.e. Datsun
pickup) and tried to catch up.
One mile, two miles, three
miles, where was he headed?
When we hit the countryside I let
out a good laugh at myself. Where
else would one take a brand new
convertible on the first day of
summer? The beach, of course.
So there we were, just cruising
on into summer. It felt like high
school. "Following someone for no
reason," I said, thinking aloud.
"What a typical summer goal." I
have always had relatively simple
goals in the summer. More like
whims. Things like playing bas
ketball on the hot pavement,
swimming in the public pool,
talking with your buddies on hot
summer nights: this is what sum
mer has always meant to me.
But college changes summer.
The longer you're in college the
more the meaning of summer is
distorted. You are going to be a
senior in college next fall, John.
Summers aren't for playing,
they're for internships, career
building, or making enough
money so you can go back to

school. Work hard in the summer,
then if there's time you can play.
Work first, play second — delayed
gratification is what I'm talking
about.
"Naaww!" I yelled, so loud that
Jim almost heard me. Maybe I do
have to work hard this summer,
lay the foundations for a career,
make money so I can go back to
school. But I'm not going to give
up my desire to be outside, to
play. Maybe I do have to work
most of the time, but I'm not
going to give up my simple goals.
I refuse to reliquish the kid in me.
By now Jim and I had reached
the highway and the last turn
towards the beach. Now that I
was certain of Jim's destination,
I gave him a honk and turned
around. I had to figure out what
my goal for the summer should
be. Perhaps I should learn how
to cook Chinese food, or learn how
to swim the butterfly, or ... .
To all you Cardinals out there
(and to Jim Steyer, who may still
be at the beach) — have a great
summer.
