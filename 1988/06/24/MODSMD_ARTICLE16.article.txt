## Hoover Fellow criticizes faculty for their partisanship 
### 
I have been frustrated over
the past decade trying to
explain to people that my
Institution is not "conserva
tive." We just look conservative
because we are part of a very
liberal University.
I refer to the Hoover Institu
tion at Stanford University. A
few liberal Stanford professors,
who I describe as "illiberal,"
claim we are "partisan" and
therefore do not belong on a
college campus. For the third
time in five years, two Stanford
professors have circulated a
petition against us. They say we
are hurting Stanford's "non
partisan" image.
They do not like the fact that
scholars from Hoover have
advised and served the Republi
can Reagan administration. But
there is nothing wrong with
that. I recall that John F. Ken
nedy received massive academic
advice from Harvard in the
60's, as does Dukakis today.
Fifty-seven Stanford profes
sors signed the current petition.
They want to bring the semi
independent Hoover Institution
under their control. Failing that,
they would like to divorce us
from the University. It is inter
esting to note that of the 57

professors who signed the peti
tion to protect Stanford's non
partisan image, 94 percent are
registered Democratic, 2 percent
Republican, and 4 percent inde
pendent.
Politics also played a major
role in the recent controversy
involving the change in the
required Western civilization
course. I surveyed the party
registration of a large number
of professors who pushed for
the change in Western "civ"
and found that all are Demo
crats except one. In another
group of professors who I
thought were "middle of the
road" because they wanted a
less radical solution, again they
were all Democrats except one.
There seems to be a pattern
developing here that proves that
it is not Hoover that is hurting
Stanford's non-liberal image,
but rather the massive liberal
tilt of the faculty and adminis
tration. If Stanford wants to
preserve its non-partisan image,
it should stop the harrassment
of the Hoover Institution.
Maybe (tongue-in-cheek) Stan
ford should inaugurate an af
firmative action program to hire
some Republican professors.
Politics in academe can get

very vicious. For many years
extreme salary discrimination
has been practiced by the Uni
versity against Hoover Director
W. Glenn Campbell, as well as
several attempts to "retire" him
early. Sensing that the Hoover
director was being unfairly har
rassed, the Hoover fellows
signed a letter in January
unanimously supporting his
continued services.
We were shocked therefore
when the Board of Trustees
announced recently that 64-
year-old Campbell was "retiring"
next year and the search for his
successor would begin immedi
ately. What was even more
shocking was to learn that at
the same May 10 Trustee's
meeting where they showed
Campbell the door, they wel
comed back to Stanford an older
64-year-old, former Stanford
president Richard Lyman, for a
five-year term to head up a new
international institute on
campus.
Campbell's fault is that
he is "controversial." What they
mean by that is that he had
refused to hand over the keys
of the Institution to the liberal
faculty. But we never expected
the Stanford Board of Trustees

to practice intolerance against
our director in the form of age
discrimination.
Former Harvard Prof. Henry
Kissinger once remarked that
campus politics are vicious be
cause the stakes are low. I can
ccnfirm the vicious part, but
the stakes are not low. Aca
demic freedom is at stake. A
campus such as Stanford should
tolerate (and welcome) all points
of view.
