## Former BSU chair's remarks set a bad example for black community 
### 
As one who deplores racism
at Stanford and in the United
States, I demand an apology
from Bill King, former chair of
the Black Student Union, for
his letter in the June 2 edition
of The Daily titled "BSU chair
attacks student ignorance, pas
sivity and racism." The letter
contained statements that are
false, morally repugnant and
dangerous. We cannot allow
such statements to remain un
challenged, especially when they
come from a source that many
look to for intellectual and
moral leadership.
Any anti-racist would be as
hamed to acknowledge Mr.
King's letter — if only for its
dull-witted and cowardly presen
tation. The letter parades
elementary errors in grammar,
for example a persistent confu
sion between what is a noun
and what is a verb. The letter

wallows in factual errors, such
as the breath takingly bizarre
identification of Keynesian with
supply-side economics. The let
ter encourages leaps of logic
(i.e., "If you can't handle a
little discomfort for being differ
ent, how can you handle a nu
clear war?") that would make
the March Hare shudder. What
Stanford-educated man could
claim to be upholding his
people's pride while writing
such a shamefully uneducated
letter?
Mr. King finds it necessary to
insult his readers ceaselessly,
addressing them as "boys and
girls" and "fools," and finally
inviting us to kiss his black
behind.
This pugnacious and irra
tional diatribe could only have
been in a passion — which
might excuse its technical and
tactical offenses were it not for

the ugliness of the passions
revealed. Here is the passionate
Mr. King — who should be the
sworn enemy of racial
stereotypes and the champion of
nonviolent protest — revelling
in the image of a group of
physically intimidating students
of color striking fear into the
hearts of Stanford administra
tors.
Here is the passionate Mr.
King — who should be working
to bring all people to a greater
understanding of racial issues
— making the absurd claim
that whites can never identify
when racism has occurred. The
passionate Mr. King would do
well to remember the words of
the Afro-American Encyclopedia
of 1869 — "He who blames too
many blames himself."
And, worst of all, here is the
passionate Mr. King proclaim
ing, "I do not like most white

people." Mr. King pleads not to
be misunderstood, but fails to
tell us why we should not un
derstand this statement the
most obvious way. This state
ment is a statement of racism
by every definition of that term
Booker T. Washington was
known to say that, "the black
man who cannot let love and
sympathy go out to the white
man is but half free." It is
tragic that someone in Mr.
King's position has enslaved his
mind to predjudice.
We all bear the burden of
racist passions — but we must
have the strength to be both
reasonable and just in spite of
them. The spasms of distaste
common both to oppressors and
oppressed must not be allowed
to crush our attempts at
reform. Most important of all,
our leaders must have the
moral integrity to guide us to

the goals that freedom and jus
tice demand.
I hope that organizations such
as the BSU will rid themselves
of the hate-filled rhetoric found
in Mr. King's letter. In addition
to an apology from Mr. King, I
request that the BSU publish a
policy statement clearly
repudiating the views of Mr.
King, which the majority of
BSU members surely do not
share.
Such a statement from the
BSU is imperative — but will
only go so far in healing the
tremendous wound Mr. King
has made in racial relations at
Stanford. Racist vendettas can
not be tolerated from any
source. As a far different King,
Martin Luther King, Jr., once
said: "An eye for an eye leaves
the whole world blind."
