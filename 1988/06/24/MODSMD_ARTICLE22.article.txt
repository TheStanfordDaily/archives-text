## Classic car show: A drive down memory lane 
### Tal Wongse-Sanit 
Imagine yourself in a Bugatti, racing
past sleepy French farmhouses to meet
Valentino on the Norman coast.
Or in a muted green Lincoln Continental
driving to Jay Gatsby's house at twilight.
Or even think of yourself on a 1914
Harley-Davidson motorcycle, whizzing
through Cannes as guest host for "Lifes
tyles of the Rich and Famous."
These fantasies and more can be yours
at the 21st Annual Palo Alto Concours
d'Elegance this Sunday at the Stanford
Intramural Fields. Viewers are sure to in
dulge in pipe dreams galore when they see,
thanks to the Palo Alto Lions Club, some
of the most stylish and elegant automobiles
that ever graced the roadways of the United
States and Europe.
The upcoming show will give us the rare
chance to see transportation not merely as
a means of getting from point A to point
B, but as a piece of history. Marshall Math
ews, a car collector and restorer, calls the
200 cars featured in the Concours "an
excellent display of the first 100 years of
automobile history . . . from the infancy of
the automobile until today."
There are 29 categories of competition
for the "Best of the Show" honor. Sports
Cars, Retired Race Cars, Imported Cars,
Horseless Carriages and French Art Deco
coachworks, which Mathews describes as
vehicles with a "color and line never seen
before or after in automobiles," are just a
few of the categories represented.
This year's theme car is the Lincoln.
There will be an assortment of Lincolns
presented at the show — from classics like
the Zephyr and the Phaeton V-12 Coach
work by Brunn, to award-winning Lincoln-
Continentals seen in the "Godfather"
movies, to a 1988 Lincoln Continental. A

special history of the car will also be on
exhibit at the show.
The University National Bank and Trust
company of Palo Alto will be presenting
two special features at the Concours: the
Gallery of the Greats, and four super
charged 1930s Bugattis from the Thomas
J. Perkins Private Collection. The Gallery,
a compilation of 10 unique and exciting

cars of different purposes and periods, will
give an exciting overview of the history of
driving in style. The Bugatti quartet,
referred to by Mathews as "the finest me
chanical art ever built," includes the
"Bluebird" owned by famous land and
water speed record holder Sir Malcolm
Campbell.
But the Concours d'Elegance, like trans
portation, does not stop at automobiles —
a selection of vintage motorcycles and
bicycles will also be on display. Motorcycles
from the turn of the century, such as a
1912 Indian and a 1914 Harley-Davidson,
can be seen at the show.
Some 20 bicycles from the collector,
Ralph Igler, will also be exhibited. This
collection will include a boneshaker from
the 1860s, High-Wheelers from the 1870s
like the one Thomas Stevens rode on his
20,000 mile ride around the world, a

Coventry Rotary, the side-by-side tandem,
the cycle Eric Heiden rode in the Tour de
France, and other classic cycles.
Organizers have dedicated this year's
Concours to the memory of Craig Calkins,
one of the founders of the charity show.
The co-directors, Erv Austin and George
Paddleford, both worked with Calkins on
previous Concours. Austin and Paddleford,
a 1931 graduate of Stanford, belong to the
Palo Alto Lions Club.
The show benefits the Peninsula Center
for the Blind, the Community Association
for Retarded, the Children's Hospital at

Stanford, the Ear of the Lion Foundation,
the Peninsula Children's Center, the Lions
Eye Foundation, the Jackson Hearing Cen
ter and the Stanford Buck/Cardinal Club
for men's and women's athletic scholar
ships.
Sunday's Concours d'Elegance is an ex
perience for everyone, from the automobile
afficionado to "the guy who doesn't know
anything about old cars," says Mathews.
So for a change of pace, forget about miles
per gallon for an afternoon, head out to
the Intramural Field, and take a much
needed break to appreciate the miracle of
transportation.

France, and other classic cycles.
Organizers have dedicated this year's
Concours to the memory of Craig Calkins,
one of the founders of the charity show.
The co-directors, Erv Austin and George
Paddleford, both worked with Calkins on
previous Concours. Austin and Paddleford,
a 1931 graduate of Stanford, belong to the
Palo Alto Lions Club.
The show benefits the Peninsula Center
for the Blind, the Community Association
for Retarded, the Children's Hospital at

Stanford, the Ear of the Lion Foundation,
the Peninsula Children's Center, the Lions
Eye Foundation, the Jackson Hearing Cen
ter and the Stanford Buck/Cardinal Club
for men's and women's athletic scholar
ships.
Sunday's Concours d'Elegance is an ex
perience for everyone, from the automobile
afficionado to "the guy who doesn't know
anything about old cars," says Mathews.
So for a change of pace, forget about miles
per gallon for an afternoon, head out to
the Intramural Field, and take a much
needed break to appreciate the miracle of
transportation.
