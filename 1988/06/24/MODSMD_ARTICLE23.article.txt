# Summer Institute explores media

Cut. Take 46.
For the 46th summer in a row, the Communica
tion department is offering the Mass Media Institute,
a program introducing students to broadcast news,
film and journalism. From June 20 to August 13,
students will focus on one of four areas: film pro
duction, broadcast news, radio and television, and
journalism.
Jules Dundes, lecturer and director of the Insti
tute, said the 60 students in the program get a
great deal of hands-on experience as well as hours
of classroom instruction. An awareness of the
media's social responsibility makes the Stanford
Institute unique, he said.
"Students don't just learn how to work the hard
ware," he said. Such instruction would leave "no
reason for our existence."
"No prior technical or professional experience" is
required, according to the administrator, Jo-Ann
Roman. Although students must have finished their
sophomore year or be over 21 years old, they are
not expected to have a complete resume. Richard
Tullis, a TA for the film program, said he finds
working with the beginners rewarding. After all,
he was enrolled in the Institute last summer.
Despite their lack of experience, however, many
students are ambitious and eager to pursue a career
in the media. The success of many Institute grad
uates puts dreams of joining studios, newspapers
and eyewitness news teams within reach.
One recent graduate, Ken Boxer, now interviews
politicians and celebrities as a TV talk show host
in Santa Barbara. The success of former student
Kate Kelly, now with Channel 5 in San Francisco,
will surely inspire this summer's students to soar.
Geographical diversity and a wide range of ages
make studying at the Institute especially interesting.
Roman said many students come to the Center to
explore a second career, mentioning that the oldest
student is 50 years old. In addition, students from
Tunisia, Zimbabwe, England and Denmark bring
fresh perspectives to learning about the American
media.
Places fill up quickly. Roman said that many
students, though qualified, are "turned down" sim
ply because each program "stresses getting to know
instructors well" within the bounds of manageable
class size and access to equipment.
Individual motivation plays a significant role in

a student's progress. "Some students get a whole
lot out of the program while others working in the
same class got nothing out of it." Those who take
advantage of equipment and studios on campus get
the most out of the program. Roman said she at
tributes Boxer's success to his persistence and
curioisity. On the Fourth of July while most of the
students were at the beach, "he was learning about
the editing equipment on his own."
"That impressed me ... and showed me where
the effort is. It all hinges on how devoted the student
is to learning."
The intensive schedule both in and out of class
demands significant dedication. Students take nine
units in one of the workshops and three units of
Communications electives.

"Students don't just learn how
to work the hardware." Such
instruction would leave "no
reason for our existence."

During the eight week workshop, students in
broadcast news will produce a news packet that
serves as a resume for finding jobs in the field.
Participants in the film program, meanwhile, work
on two minute films. Students sometimes spend
more than $300 filming and editing their short
masterpieces.
And the most popular genre? Drama. Roman said
one of last year's students presented "Spokes," a
hilarious two minute film about a woman attacked
by ten speed bikes at Stanford. Inspired by an
episode in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds," the film
had creepy overtones and spooky music.
"Often students save such productions and present
it as a resume on VHS tape," she added.
Dundes hopes that students will have a great time
in the "exceedingly intense" workshop. Stanford
senior Jose Martinez agreed, saying the film pro
gram seems like a great way to learn with students
from other universities. Humphrey Gyde came to
the Institute from England and was glad that com
petition between students is relaxed, with pass-fail
grades that allow "everyone to root for everyone
else."
