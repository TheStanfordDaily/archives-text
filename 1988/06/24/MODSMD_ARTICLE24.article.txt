# Laugh in the summer at a Frost pique-nique
## 
### Todd Pierce Editorial staff 
Chuckle, chortle, snicker and giggle. Even guffaw.
At Stonehenge, druids march and hippies riot to mark the
arrival of summer. But Stanford welcomes summer in a more
gentle manner. This Saturday at Stanford, hordes of students
and families will invade Frost Amphitheater for the second
annual South Bay Comedy Picnic.
Comedians and singers from the Bay Area and beyond will
entertain the crowd of supine revelers from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.
But have no fear of wretched excess, for the Jaycees will donate
all the profits to the Neo-natal Intensive-care Unit at Stanford
Hospital.
Sponsored by the Palo Alto Jaycees and the San Jose Mercury
News, the show will feature several award-winning comedians.
Michael Pritchard, winner of the 1980 International Stand-Up
Comedy Competition, and four entertainers from "Late-Night
with David Letterman" will appear with San Francisco comedy
duos and more than fift'jen other comedians.
"The show was a big success last year," according to Steve
Cramer, the director of the ASSU Concert Network. "And it's
the same program this year."
Cramer seemed rixcited about the three bands that will play
to the crowd for the first hour: Bob Brozman, Duck Baker and
(unconventionally enough) Elgian Marbles and the Alley Boys.
Cramer did not speculate on the problem of filling the acid
washed shoes of the Grateful Dead, who performed at Frost last
month.
Last year the comedy picnic drew an audience of 3,000 people
and raised $15,000 for charity.
