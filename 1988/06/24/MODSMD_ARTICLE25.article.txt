Baby You Can Drive My Car
I have had two fantasies about cars in my life.
The first occurred on June 13, 1984, the day I crashed our
family car into our garage. The doors weren't open.
The second was about my first formal date's dad's car. You
see, he owned a 1948 MG-TC red and black convertible, which
he granted us permission to escort to the Sunnyvale Hilton for
the evening. I imagined emerging from the sleek auto, cameras
flashing, like some movie star at a Hollywood shindig.
Unfortunately, a faulty alternator spoiled my visions of gran
deur. The next morning I spent a good twenty minutes sitting
in the front seat of that car, dreaming of the entrance that
could have been. Needless to say, we pulled into the Hilton
parking lot in an orange Pinto.
If you also have a fascination for unique and show-stopping
automobiles, be sure not to miss the Concours D' Elegance this
Sunday at Stanford. But don't blame me if they won't let you
sit in the front seat.
Funnier Than This
If the office jokes are getting stale and you can't wait for the
Sunday Funnies, go see the Comedy Picnic at Frost Ampitheater
on Saturday. The picnic is from 2 'til 6 p.m. — prime time to

sit back, relax and be entertained.
The show features various com
edians from late-night and cable
comedy shows, plus Comedy Com
petition winners. Also advertised
are "special surprise celebrity
guests," so you definitely
shouldn't miss it.
Throw That Hammer
If the above activities don't
make your toes tingle, or you are
searching for heartier entertain
ment, drive over to the Solano
Fairgrounds, across from Marine

World in Villejo.
There you will find skirted men,
jigging girls, wild fiddlers and har
pers, dancers and singers; there
you'll find the Scottish and Irish
Festival, which opens at 10 a.m.
Saturday and continues through
Sunday. The Irish and Scottish
brew their own distinctive brand
of traditional merriment, so I
guarantee you will be swept into
the festivities. Be wary of falling
Cabers.
For all of you making non
backyard barbeque plans for the
Fourth, I suggest you plan ahead
— like now. You will save yourself
and your children a lot of hassle.
