# Palate-pleasing Chinese cuisine
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Palo Alto may very well be one
of the restaurant capitals of the
world. No matter what type of
cuisine you wish to place on the
tip of your tongue, there is at
least one place, usually more,
ready to serve it.
In that light, welcome to the
first installment of Dining Out,
the column that separates the
great restaurants from the merely
good or mediocre and presents
them on a silver platter.

Palo Alto

Next to the great little hole-in
the-wall places prevalent in
Chinatown, Jing-Jing offers some
of the best Chinese food in the
Bay Area. The menu claims they
cook their fare "the way it should
be," which after any meal eaten
proves to be a statement not of
self-aggrandizement but of
honesty.
Some of the finest dishes not
listed in red type (which
delineates the scaldingly spicy
Szechwan dishes, too hot for me
to handle) include cashew chicken,
beef and scallops on a sizzling
plate and mu-shu chicken (the

traditional mu-shu ingredient
pork is available, as is beef, but
poultry provides an unusual
change of taste).
Moreover, Jing-Jing's $3.95
lunch special of hot and sour soup
with a choice of two dishes out of
about a dozen is one of the best
gourmet bargains around, provid
ing tasty vittles for the price of
a slimy burger and fries. Check
it out.
Hsi-Nan
203 University Ave.
Palo Aito
326-6065
If you don't look carefully, you
might very well overlook a small
but sumptuous Chinese restau
rant. Tucked away incon
spicuously next to the University
Creamery (from where, inciden
tally, the soft drinks and ice cream
served here actually come), the
12-table Hsi-Nan is one of Palo
Alto's buried treasures.
As strange as it may seem, I've
yet to go beyond one dish in all
of the times I've eaten there, not
because of lassitude but satiation.
Basically, the sweet and sour
prawns are heavenly, so good that
even after three consecutive meals
of them I was still in culinary
ecstasy.
At $8.50 for the prawns and

comparable prices for other
dishes, Hsi-Nan is not a cheap
place, probably one of the reasons
that I've never encountered more
than a handful of patrons any
time I've gone there. However,
since each of these people seemed
to have enjoyed their feast, as
have all the guests I've dined
with, the spot seems to be a safe
bet for prawn-lovers and non
prawn-lovers alike.
By the way, the last person I
went there with ordered chicken
in Peking sauce and really enjoyed
it — it's a little heavy on the
onions but well worth a try if you
come with a pack of Certs as the
needed after-dinner mint.
O'Mei Restaurant
1438 EI Camino Real
Menlo Park
323-2700
Another great little spot.
Owned by a Japanese man and
his Chinese wife, O'Mei provides
elegant food in a less than formal,
but still pleasant, environment.
The menu is quite extensive,
and after dining there on over a
dozen occasions, I've yet to get a
bum dish. I've come to the con
clusion that you just can't lose.
Go give it a try — the place
will speak for itself.
