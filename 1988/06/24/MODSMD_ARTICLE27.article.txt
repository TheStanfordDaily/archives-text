"Big Business"

The team of Bette Midler and Lily Tom
lin have restored my faith in the motion
picture industry. While many movies these
days take a potentially good plot idea and
fail miserably with it, "Big Business"
begins with a pretty unoriginal plot and
turns it into a very entertaining movie.
The film begins sometime in the early
'40s, when a rich New York City woman
gives birth to twins in the West Virginia
town of Jupiter's Hollow. Unfortunately,
a local also has twins in the same hospital,
and the babies get mixed up; each family
gets one of their own and one of the other
couple's.
The movie then jumps to the present.
Sadie and Rose Shelton (Midler and Tom
lin) are the high-powered chief executives
for the New York corporation Moramax
while Sadie and Rose Ratliff (again Midler
and Tomlin) reside in Jupiter's Hollow.
Now this would be a great sociology ex
periment — studying the relative impor
tance of one's instinct and one's environ
ment — but it sure sounds like a dumb
flick. How many jokes can one person stand
about confusing one person with another?

Well, with Midler and Tomlin starring, the
number is pretty darn high.
Anyway, Rose Ratliff goes to New York;
Sadie RatlifF, who has always dreamed of
bright lights, tags along with her, and all
hell breaks loose. The Ratliffs and the Shel
tons end up staying in the same hotel and

everyone gets really confused.
The next hour or so of the movie shows
countless people misidentifying the two sets
of twins. Believe it or not, the jokes were
funny every time. In addition to Midler
and Tomlin starring, Fred Ward (the star
of "Remo Williams") plays a great country
bumpkin/world-class miniature golfer
named Roone Dimmick. With his West Vir
ginia accent and country mannerisms, Ward
shows he can hang with big-time com
ediennes Midler and Tomlin.
Despite a rather ridiculous plot, the ac
tors play their roles well, leading to big
laughs in "Big Business." Hey, even Siskel
and Ebert might like it. — Chris Cruder
"Rambo III"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101

"Who is he, God?"
"No, God has mercy; he won't."
That's right, John Rambo is back and
fighting mad, vying for the title of "Most
Violent Man With a Conscience." After his
former commander, Col. Troutman, is cap
tured by the Soviets during a mission into
war-torn Afghanistan, the man who gave
new meaning to the expression "I'm your
worst nightmare" launches a one-man res
cue/war against an entire battalion occupy

ing this desolate terrain.
As is immediately obvious, "Rambo III"
is not big on realism. Hcyvever, after
"Rambo," viewers have learned to auto
matically suspend their sense of disbelief
as the opening credits roll and just
hedonistically enjoy the action that
Sylvester Stallone and company readily
deliver.
The result of this endeavor is a fast
paced, visually appealing and exciting
movie that even attempts to convey a mes
sage about the Vietnam War-like conflict
in Afghanistan that only recently the Soviet
Union has sought to end. It's not all that
deep of a maxim, but at least it's something.
The most surprising thing this movie
delivers is character development.
Throughout two films, Rambo has killed
at will but remained a mysterious and
seemingly unfathomable character. Apart
from being resistant to pain but not mili
tary orders, the audience is not shown any
of the gladiator's basic personality traits.
This time around, however, Stallone
fleshes out not only Rambo's mind but
also his psyche, making the most aggressive
man in film appear compassionate and per
plexed as well as loyal and deadly. As Trout
man (well-played by Richard Crenna) dis
covers, a Rambo is a man's best friend.
