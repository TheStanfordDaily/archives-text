## Laker win marks end of an era 
### 
As if by Magic, the Los Angeles Lakers survived
three straight seven-game series and proved
themselves Worthy of becoming the first team
to win back-to-back NBA championships since the
1969 Boston Celtics.
A year ago, Los Angeles Lakers Coach Pat Riley
"guaranteed" his team would repeat this season,
and in the early days of 1988 it seemed certain
that they would.

The Lakers were on such a roll in the winter that
there was speculation they might even win 70 games.
Then a series of injuries slowed the run-and-gun
Lakers and Showtime began to look more like a
dress .rehearsal in which all the stars were replaced
by their understudies.
The Coach rested his wounded warriors at
season's end in an attempt to prepare them to do
battle in the playoffs.
It was a sound strategy, yet it seemed like it
might not be enough to prevent Riley from eating
his guarantee with a side dish of crow as the Utah
Jazz, Dallas Mavericks and Detroit Pistons gave
the Lakers all they could handle.
And it was thrilling. What a great final game in
a great series.
And I'm glad it's over. It's time for America's
love affair with Boston and L.A. to come to an end.
It is apparent that a changing of the guard is
afoot in the NBA — despite the Lakers' eventual
triumph — and nothing could be better for basket
ball.
Who will dominate in the future? Teams like the
Chicago Bulls, who may very well add free-agent
center Moses Malone to a talented young contingent
led by the incomparable Michael Jordan, versatile
Scottie Pippen and potential superstar Horace Grant.
Add to that list the Mavericks, who will most
certainly install Roy Tarpley (he had an amazing
year coming off the bench) to the starting lineup,
the Jazz, that has two of the best at their respective
positions in point guard John Stockton and power
forward Karl Malone, the Atlanta Hawks, who are
a pivot man away from challenging the Pistons and
the Cleveland Cavaliers, who Magic Johnson has
already proclaimed the "team of the '905."

And what of the Lakers? Magic, while still an
amazing player, has logged a lot of miles in
all these 90-plus game seasons. He's not ex
actly on his way out by any means. But, he's not
getting any younger either.
Worse still for L.A. is they have no one to play
center even if Kareem Abdul-Jabbar returns for
another year. Jabbar, the Truly Great One once
known as Lew Alcindor, the most prolific scorer in
NBA history, the man who perfected one of the
most unstoppable offensive weapons ever in the sky
hook is, in a word, through.
Jabbar was regularly exploited by Utah's oafish
Mark Eaton, Dallas stiff James Donaldson and
Detroit's ancient James Edwards. Don't be surprised
if Akeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing light up the
scoreboard for 50 against Jabbar next year.
Edwards' ability to exploit Jabbar brings an ob
servation to mind. While the Lakers ultimately tri
umphed on the strength of James Worthy's best
game ever, better strategy by Pistons' Coach Chuck
Daly could have obviated Game 7 altogether.
For starters, Daly should have banged the ball
into Edwards in the low post in the second half of
Game 6. Isiah Thomas was having an amazing night
but the bottom line is the whole Detroit offense got
out of synch as they sat around letting him shoot
the lights out from all over the floor. When Thomas
finally cooled off, there was no one ready to pick
up the slack.
If Edwards had been given the ball down low he
could have posted up Jabbar at will, thereby mixing
up the offense and perhaps carrying Detroit to vic
tory.
Daly can be faulted on another count as well. In
the closing seconds of Game 6 he spent his timeouts
way too early. At game's end, Detroit was forced
to try and push the ball up court, and score, in
five seconds because they had burned their last two
timeouts following made baskets by the Lakers in
the game's final minute.
With the ball at mid-court and five ticks left the
Pistons would have had a plethora of options. If
any one of them netted Detroit two or more points,
the Pistons would be NBA champs today.
What about the Celtics? Their age was even
more apparent than the Lakers. Robert Par
rish and Dennis Johnson have played as
many years as can be expected — they'll both be
out of the league within two years. Larry Bird has
said he'll hang it up after two more seasons as well.
That leaves Kevin McHale. He's a monster talent
to be sure, but won't be able to carry a team that's
composed of Danny Ainge, Brad Lohaus, Reggie
Lewis and Mark Acres.
