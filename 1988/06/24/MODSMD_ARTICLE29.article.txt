# Grabb wins, McEnroe falls at Wimbledon
## 
### 
In a day of shocking upsets
at the All England Club, Jim
Grabb, who graduated from
Stanford in 1986, shocked
11th-seeded Anders Jarryd of
Sweden and John McEnroe's
Wimbledon comeback was
ended abruptly by Wally Masur
in a flurry of missed chances
and disputes over a couple of
crucial line calls.
Grabb was impressive in his
four set win over Jarryd,

knocking him off 3-6, 7-6, 6-3,
6-0. "I've had some other wins
over big names, but the venue
of this one is a little more at
tractive," said Grabb, ranked
63rd in the world.
McEnroe, playing at the
grass-court Grand Slam for the
first time since 1985, blew set
points in the first and second
sets and lost his second-round
match to the Australian Masur
7-5, 7-6, 6-3.
