# Harassment threatens RFs
## Burciagas may leave Zapata 
### Eric Richardson Editorial staff 
Repeated incidents of possibly
racially motivated harassment at
Casa Zapata may drive Resident
Fellows Cecilia and Tony Burciaga
out of their home in the Chicano
and Mexican-American theme
house.
On Wednesday, Tony Burciaga
said he and his wife might leave
Zapata as a result of the latest
incidence of vandalism Sunday
morning. At 6:30 a.m. Sunday,
the Burciagas found two-dozen
raw eggs broken over their cars
in the Stern Hall parking lot.
Over the past month, the Bur
ciagas said they have received
several threatening phone calls
and a fire extinguisher was
emptied into their convertible car.
Moreover, a vandal or vandals
sprayed a fire extinguisher on a
first-floor Zapata room in late
May, Zapata resident Jerilyn
Lopez Mendoza said.
In the past year, the Burciagas
have also had oil dumped on their
home and two expensive plants
stolen from the resident fellow cot

their two children live.
Following Sunday's egg
breaking incident, Tony Burciaga

painted a sign in bright red letters
on the fence outside Zapata.
"To the Vandals: You are gut
less, cowardly . . . protected by the
darkness of night and your own
ignorance," read the message.
The message will hopefully
"scare" and "embarrass" the van
dals so they "realize what the hell
they are doing," Burciaga said,
adding that similar "public" mes
sages were effective in stopping
racist hate-mail that he received
while working for the San Jose
Mercury News several years ago.
Originally, Burciaga said he
thought the vandalism "was noth
ing but a prank." He began to
suspect racial motivation and re
ported the incident to police after
the May 24 vigil at Otero, which
allegedly evoked Images of the Ku
Klux Klan.
Assoc. Dean fjtoident Affairs
Norm Robinson saitf the incident
is "terribly troubling." However,
Robinson speculated that the in
cident was "personal, rather than
racially motivated."
On the other hand, Mendoza
said she felt the incident was an
attack on Zapata itself. "After I
heard about the event with Tony
and Cecilia's car, i connected it
