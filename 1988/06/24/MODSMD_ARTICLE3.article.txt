# Harassment threatens RFs
## Burciagas may leave Zapata 
### Eric Richardson Editorial staff 
Repeated incidents of possibly
racially motivated harassment at
Casa Zapata may drive Resident
Fellows Cecilia and Tony Burciaga
out of their home in the Chicano
and Mexican-American theme
house.
On Wednesday, Tony Burciaga
said he and his wife might leave
Zapata as a result of the latest
incidence of vandalism Sunday
morning. At 6:30 a.m. Sunday,
the Burciagas found two-dozen
raw eggs broken over their cars
in the Stern Hall parking lot.
Over the past month, the Bur
ciagas said they have received
several threatening phone calls
and a fire extinguisher was
emptied into their convertible car.
Moreover, a vandal or vandals
sprayed a fire extinguisher on a
first-floor Zapata room in late
May, Zapata resident Jerilyn
Lopez Mendoza said.
In the past year, the Burciagas
have also had oil dumped on their
home and two expensive plants
stolen from the resident fellow cot
tage, where the Burciagas and
their two children live.
Following Sunday's egg
breaking incident, Tony Burciaga

painted a sign in bright red letters
on the fence outside Zapata.
"To the Vandals: You are gut
less, cowardly . . . protected by the
darkness of night and your own
ignorance," read the message.
The message will hopefully
"scare" and "embarrass" the van
dals so they "realize what the hell
they are doing," Burciaga said,
adding that similar "public" mes
sages were effective in stopping
racist hate-mail that he received
while working for the San Jose
Mercury News several years ago.
Originally, Burciaga said he
thought the vandalism "was noth
ing but a prank." He began to
suspect racial motivation and re
ported the incident to police after
the May 24 vigil at Otero, which
allegedly evoked Images of the Ku
Klux Klan.
Assoc. Dean fjtoident Affairs
Norm Robinson saitf the incident
is "terribly troubling." However,
Robinson speculated that the in
cident was "personal, rather than
racially motivated."
On the other hand, Mendoza
said she felt the incident was an
attack on Zapata itself. "After I
heard about the event with Tony
and Cecilia's car, i connected it
with the fire extinguisher incident
on the first floor. Someone is
harassing the house," she said.
"If Tony and Cecelia leave be
cause of these incidents, there
would be a lot of backlash in the
community," Mendoza predicted.
According to Robinson, "it
would be a terrible blow" if the
Burciagas choose to leave their
positions as resident fellows at
Zapata. He noted that the theme
house has developed an excellent
reputation during their tenure.
Emphasizing his own uncer
tainty, Burciaga said he does not
know if all the incidents are
linked. Neither he nor his family

are sure of the culprit's identity
or motivation.
Burciaga speculated that an in
cident in early June may be linked
to the vandalism. He said he is
confused and uncertain whether
this incident was racially
motivated.
In the June incident, a group
of Chicano students who were
drinking in the Zapata parking
lot disturbed and harassed Zapata
resident assistant Margaret
O'Shea when she requested that
they leave.
One of these students — who
was later disciplined by Cecilia
Burciaga — "continued to raise
the issue" for the remainder of
the school year, O'Shea said, ex
plaining that she also received a
threatening phone call shortly
thereafter.

Police are reportedly investigat
ing to see if the student, a 1988
Stanford graduate, was on or near
the campus on Sunday.
"Having something like this
happen, puts fear into you and
your family. It makes you feel
vulnerable, violated. It really
started to work on our minds,"
Tony Burciaga said.
"We're not safe anywhere," he
added about himself and his wife.
Cecilia Burciaga is associate dean
of graduate studies, director of
the summer program and a mem
ber of the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
"We're both active and out
spoken one way or another and
we will continue to be
spokespeople for the Latino-
Chicano community," he said.

Despite his active involvement at Casa Zapata, Resident Fellow Tony
Kurciaga, seen here working on a Zapata mural with a fellow
resident, may soon leave the dorm. Repeated incidents of vandalism
and phone threats might drive Burciaga and his family out of the
Chicano and Mexican-American theme house.
