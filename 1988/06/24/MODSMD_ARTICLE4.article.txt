# Two Phi Delts quit; cite 'intolerance'

### Andrew Patzman Senior staff writer 
Calling the "attitudes and behavior" of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity at Stanford "in
consistent with our personal values," two
members of the organization — one of them

concern had been building for a long time."
Stressing that he and Patrick consider their
resignations to be "a personal matter between

us and the house," Driscoll declined to discuss

to do was make a public denunciation," he
said. "A lot of our good friends still live in

Seven Phi Delts donned masks and appeared
with candles outside of Otero House May 24
to protest the eviction of an Otero freshman
for homophobic and belligerent actions. The
vigil, which for many evoked images of the

paleontological dig in Tanzania, was unavail-
