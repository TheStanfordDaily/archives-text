# Two Phi Delts quit; cite 'intolerance'
## 
### Andrew Patzman Senior staff writer 
Calling the "attitudes and behavior" of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity at Stanford "in
consistent with our personal values," two
members of the organization — one of them
a 1988 Rhodes scholar — formally severed
their ties to the fraternity last month.
Hugh Driscoll and Rhodes scholar Stewart
Patrick, both 1987 graduates of Stanford, an
nounced their intention to "deactivate" as Phi
Delts in a joint letter to the fraternity May 25.
Driscoll and Patrick's decision to resign was
the culmination of more than two years of
growing "dissatisfaction" with the fraternity,

Driscoll said yesterday. He explained that he
and Patrick were disturbed by the "sexism"
of some Phi Delt members, as well as by an
atmosphere of "intolerance toward groups out
side the fraternity." He added that the fra
ternity's "anti-intellectual, uncritical approach
to life at Stanford" also contributed to their
decision to resign.
Driscoll said a controversial masked vigil
held last month by seven Phi Delt members
played only a marginal role in his and Patrick's
decision to leave the fraternity. "The incident
made us think even harder about things we'd
already thought a lot about," he said. "Our
concern had been building for a long time."
Stressing that he and Patrick consider their
resignations to be "a personal matter between

us and the house," Driscoll declined to discuss
the matter further. "The last thing we wanted
to do was make a public denunciation," he
said. "A lot of our good friends still live in
the house."
Seven Phi Delts donned masks and appeared
with candles outside of Otero House May 24
to protest the eviction of an Otero freshman
for homophobic and belligerent actions. The
vigil, which for many evoked images of the
Ku Klux Klan, stirred controversy on campus
and brought negative attention to the frater
nity.
Patrick, who is spending the summer on a
paleontological dig in Tanzania, was unavail-
able for comment.
Former Phi Delt president
Vinnie Frost said he was "disap
pointed" at Driscoll and Patrick's
decision, but said he "understood
where they were coming from."
"I understood [their resig
nations] to be a reaction to the
Otero incident," Frost explained,
"and a lot of people — not just
them — felt that that was inex
cusable."
According to Frost, who gradu
ated last quarter, many Phi Delts
are "very upset" at Driscoll and
Patrick for deactivating. "Stewart
and Hugh never tried to approach

the members to talk about this,"
Frost said.
"Personally, I was offended by
it," said Phi Delt member Ted
Gildred, a 1988 graduate.
"They've been gone for a year,"
he said of Driscoll and Patrick.
"They are hardly ever there;
they're ignorant of what's really
going on in the house."
Arguing that Driscoll and
Patrick "don't have any first-hand
knowledge (of the house) any
more," Gildred called their obser
vation of sexism in the fraternity
"ridiculous."
"We don't have any type of
sexist attitudes," Gildred said.
"This year we've done everything
we could to improve our image
about that."

Frost, however, conceded that
sexism at the Phi Delt fraternity
is "definitely a problem."
"Sometimes a whole bunch of
guys living together just let sexist
remarks go unchecked," he said.
Frost said he disagreed with
Driscoll and Patrick that the fra
ternity fosters an anti-intellectual
atmosphere. "We work hard, and
we play hard," he said. "There's
a lot of academic support in the
house, and a lot of people are very
motivated."
"Frankly, I'm astonished that
they (Driscoll and Patrick) would
be so un-understanding," Gildred
said. "I think even now, if they
were to talk about it with us, they
would realize that what they did
was a tremendous mistake."
