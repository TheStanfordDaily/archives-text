To get rid of wooden bleachers plagued by
termites and splinters, the 62-year-old Stan
ford tennis stadium will undergo a long
overdue reconstruction beginning in early
July.
Because of Stanford Men's Tennis Coach
Dick Gould's fund-raising efforts, and the ef
forts of others in the tennis office, the Stan
ford Board of Trustees approved a $2.6 million
project for the new tennis complex that will
open in February.
The new complex, which will replace the
old stadium built in the 19205, will have steel
framed bleachers, lockers and showers for the
players, restrooms with handicapped access
and court lighting for evening tennis. In ad
dition, there will be three-times more office
space, 38 box seats and an underground tennis
court.
Athletic demonstrations, tennis team
celebrations and big-screen television viewing
will all take place in the underground complex.
The facility will also serve as a locker room
for visiting celebrities and will provide tem
porary housing for Stanford tennis recruits.
Seeking out long-time graduates in old Stan
ford yearbooks and spending "26-hours a day"
on the phone, Gould said he and his staff
were able to raise $2.3 million of the $2.6
million necessary to upgrade the tennis facil
ities from tennis team alumni and fans.

The stadium "is needed and will be increas
ingly needed as the years go on," Gould said.
During his 22 years at Stanford, Gould has
lead his team to nine national championships.
Saying that a philosophy of "self-help"
exists in the Athletic Department, Jeff Urdan,
director of development for the Stanford crew
team, explained that determined coaches like
Gould must spark alumni interest and raise
the money themselves if they want special
athletic facilities.

In the case of the crew team, Urdan said
the Athletic Department funds only one-fourth
of the team's budget and the balance comes
from alumni donations, fund raising and team
members' volunteer work.
Director of Athletic Development John
Kates also recognized Gould's fundraising ef
fort as a "single-handed" one and praised the
tennis coach's determination.

Jnoufh this is only a preliminary model, with an underground tennis court, box seats and
lighting for evening tennis. Stanford's new $2.6 million tennis complex is sure to he a hit
( obstruction will swinjj into action this July.
"He didn't have to go out and
raise the money. It was totally on
his own initiative," Kates said.
According to Gould, his goal for
the tennis program is to be as
"self-sufficient as possible."
"The more self-sufficient we can
be, the greater chance the pro
gram will keep existing," he said.
Because of the University's
Centennial campaign and other
fundraising projects, Gould said
the tennis department could only
approach a limited number of con
tributors.
