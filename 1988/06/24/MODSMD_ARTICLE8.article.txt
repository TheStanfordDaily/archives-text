# Engineering school opens quake center
## 
### Nicholas Anderson 
Stanford and the U.S. govern
ment have joined forces to study
the mysterious powers that cause
earthquakes and to search for
ways to lessen earthquake damage
to population centers.
In the tradition of cooperation
between industry, government
and academia, on Tuesday the
School of Engineering opened the
Stanford/U.S. Geological Survey
Center for Research in Earth
quake Engineering and Seismol
ogy.
Before 100 representatives of
USGS and the University, newly
appointed Director of the Center
Helmut Krawinkler said he hopes
the joint venture will have "a large
impact" in reducing earthquake
hazards. The center's annual
budget is anticipated to reach $1
million in combined funds from
USGS and Stanford.
The new center will be located
in building 540, along with the
fourteen-year old John A. Blume
Earthquake Engineering Center.
Prof. James Gibbons, dean of the
School of Engineering, said the
center will add to Stanford's "long
history of leadership" in the study
of earthquakes.
In 1986, Stanford offered over
$1 million to bring the national
earthquake engineering center to
California but was foiled when the
National Science Foundation
awarded the center to Buffalo,
New York.

Prof. Ann Karemidjian, co
director of the Blume Center, said
the USGS center was not a re
placement for the national earth
quake center but that Stanford
researchers "can think of it as a
consequence" of the decision to
send the national center else
where.
Although the center will host
seminars and workshops for both
University and USGS researchers,
it will focus mainly on earthquake
hazard mitigation. Research at
the center will emphasize earth
quake analysis, interpretation of
ground motion and structural re
sponse.
Comparing the new earthquake
center to the Center for Integrated
Systems, Gibbons stressed the sig
nificance of Stanford's coopera
tion with industry and govern
ment.
The CIS was founded by former
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Meindl as an industry
education joint venture to develop
integrated circuits. Gibbons noted
that a similar kind of technology
sharing between government and
education will characterize the
new earthquake center.
Prof. Haresh Shah, chair of the
Department of Civil Engineering,
said the center is particularly im
portant because of the unusual
cooperation between geologists,
seismologists and structural en
gineers towards mitigating the
damage caused by earthquakes.
