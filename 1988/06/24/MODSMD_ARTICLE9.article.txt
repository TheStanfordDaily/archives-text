CHICAGO — With time run
ning out for grain-belt crops to
survive the worst drought since
the Dust Bowl, Midwestern gover
nors heard more bad news yes
terday, ranging from a forecast of
at least one" more hot, dry, critical
week to grim estimates about the
damage so far.
Warning that an official assess
ment of the drought damage is
still weeks, if not months away,
Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng told the 10 governors and
their staffs thrft the federal gov
ernment will "replace a substan
tial part of lost income that farm
ers are going to have."
"We are determined to do what
ever the government can do," said
Lyng, declaring that "this drought
is too important to play politics
with." But the secretary cau
tioned that it is still too early to
determine the impact.
"A rain next week or the fol
lowing week can make some dif
ference," Lyng said. "We'll need
a little time to fully evaluate what
the consequences are."
Vice President George Bush in
Washington echoed Lyng, saying
that "if conditions continue to
deteriorate, money that has been
saved in this year's farm pro
grams will be redirected to farm
families as disaster relief for the
rural economy." Currently
economists estimate that the gov
ernment will save about $5 billion
in subsidy costs because the

drought has driven up commodity
prices. Most such relief would
have to be authorized by Congress
and signed by the President.
Already 20 percent of the na
tion's 1988 corn crop, 18 percent
of its combined winter and spring
wheat crop and 10 percent of the
soybean crop — the nation's three
main farm commodities — have
been lost, reported Gail Martell,
agricultural meterologist for
Shearson Lehman Hutton.
"It is utter and complete disas
ter in North Dakota," she said,
estimating that "two-thirds of the
(spring wheat) crop is gone. And
blowing dust is sandblasting
(remaining) plants."
"Unless we receive substantial
rain by the 30th of this month
we risk loss of our corn crop and
loss of our soybean crop," said
Illinois Gov. James Thompson
who welcomed the 10 governors
to "the heart of the drought land."
Rain is particularly important
to the corn, which is rapidly ap
proaching the time when kernels
are formed. This coincides with a
period of rapid growth when the
plant 3 move from needing about
one-tenth of an inch of water each
day to about a third of an inch.
Corn is the country's biggest ex
port commodity and is used
domestically for products ranging
from animal feed to cooking oil
to laundry starch.
"We are running out of time
for the corn crop," said Martell.

"lf it stays dry and we get heat,
we could lose up to a third of the
crop."
Yet hot and dry is exactly what
the National Weather Service pre
dicted for the Midwest through

the end of the month.
"Rainfall for the period is ex
pected to be subnormal from the
Central Plains to Illinois and In
diana," the Weather Service's first
"drought advisory" of the year re

ported. The report said that since
April 1, an area reaching from
the Gulf states to the Canadian
border received less than 50 per
cent of normal percipitation.
