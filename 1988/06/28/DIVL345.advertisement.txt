At the insistent urging of my oldest brother, I
began the TM technique at age thirteen with the
rest of my family. Throughout high school, the TM
program established a stability and intimate ap
preciation of myself during what are generally char
acterized as 'awkward years' by certain adult
authorities on the subject. They were productive
years of unbelievable growth for me, both in factual
knowledge and in the deepening quality of human
relationships

The pressure of dealines and constant influx of new
experiences in college can disorient a student; as a
meditator, I am not too worried by all that. At
exam time, people around me arc always anxious,
but I don't feel the same pinch. With this freedom,
I succeed regularly: I was named the 'most intel
lectually promising freshman.' Last fall, I went out
for cross-country and amazed everyone by running
second on the varsity squad without ever have run
for a team before. My rapid improvement and con
sistent performance were due the the same
stability.

The basis of personal growth is not gained by an
act of the intellect or as an emotional apprehen
sion; growth is more basic than any form of action
The TM technique, because it works holistically on
mind and body alike, enriches all thought and ac
tion with increased clarity, precision, and effective
ness. It provides in our daily experience a basis for
integration of ourselves and for a growing internal
strength that frees and enlivens our relationships
with others.
