MOSCOW â€” Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
will open a special conference of the Communist
Party today with a call for the party to end its
70-year monopoly on power and instead to lead the
Soviet Union from within the government, the en
terprises and the other institutions it commands.
Gorbachev also will outline a program that, ac
cording to senior party officials, will broaden and
accelerate the process of perestroika, the political,
economic and social reform with which he began
to transform the country within weeks of coming
to power in 1985.
And he will push the promotion, within a much
reorganized party, of other reformers committed to
speeding perestroika and ending the nation's
prolonged stagnation.
Gorbachev's speech will be a sharp break with
the past, senior party officials predicted yesterday
in briefing newsmen on the special party conference.
They said that it will offer a vision of a new and
much different future for the Soviet Union.
"Our intention is to create a human face for
socialism, and that means making over socialism
to serve the human being," Naili B. Bikkenin, editor
of the party journal Kommunist, said, reflecting
the optimism of most of Gorbachev's supporters.
The focus of Gorbachev's speech, according to the
party officials, will be the urgent need for a sharp
separation of the party as a political organization
from the government bodies, economic enterprises

and social institutions that until now it has tightly
controlled.
The special Kremlin conference, expected to last
four or five days, will be a summing up of the first
three years of perestroika and the launching of the
next phase of reform, according to the party officials,
who predicted that it would become a turning point
in Soviet history.
"The main question to be discussed at the con
ference is the restructuring of our political system,
which is, of course, obsolete, absolutely obsolete,"
Bikkenin said. The party is now "in search of de
mocracy," he added.
The conference, to be attended by 5,000 delegates
from across the country, is expected to issue a series
of instructions to party organs, including the policy
making Central Committee, to expand the reform
process with all possible speed. Legislation will then
be put to the Supreme Soviet, the parliament, for
enactment later this year.
In political terms, Gorbachev is expected to use
both his speech and the conference as a whole to
renew the momentum of his reform program, over
coming the opposition of party conservatives to the
pace and scope of perestroika. He had decided a
year ago that he could not wait for the next party
congress, scheduled for 1991, to renew his mandate
for reform.
