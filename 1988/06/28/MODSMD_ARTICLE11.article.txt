# Activists may not picket before private homes

WASHINGTON - The Su
preme Court yesterday restricted
the ability of social activists to
demonstrate at the homes of their
opponents, ruling 6-3 that anti
abortion picketers may be
prevented from protesting in front
of the house of a doctor who per
forms abortions.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
writing for the court, upheld an
ordinance in Brookfield, Wis., a
small Milwaukee suburb that
banned picketing in residential

areas. She rejected arguments
from an unusual coalition of anti
abortion groups, the American
Civil Liberties Union and organ
ized labor that said the ban vio
lated the free speech rights of
protestors.
In another decision announced
Monday, the court greatly
broadened the protections given
government contractors from law
suits resulting from accidents
caused by defective products.
