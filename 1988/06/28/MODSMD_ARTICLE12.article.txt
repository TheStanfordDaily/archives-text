Junior trader riabbed in NYC
NEW YORK — A 24-year-old trainee at Morgan
Stanley & Co. was accused yesterday of leaking
secret details of mergers and other deals in what
the Securities and Exchange Commission says is
the second-biggest insider trading case ever filed.
The SEC suit, brought in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan, accuses Stephen Sui-Kuan Wang
Jr., 24, the Morgan Stanley employee, and a
Taiwanese businessman, Fred Lee, of collaborat
ing in a scheme that netted at least $19 million
in illegal profits.
Wang, a participant in Morgan Stanley's two
year "junior analyst" training program, had been

assigned since March 1, 1987 to the investment
firm's mergers and acquisitions department.
Bishops sign AIDS document
COLLEGEVILLE, Minn. — Ending a "fester
ing" division among themselves, U.S. Catholic
bishops decided unanimously yesterday to retain
a controversial statement on AIDS but to develop
another, updated document that would include
new facts and Vatican input.
The compromise was reached by about 175
bishops in a three-hour closed session at St.
John's University here.
