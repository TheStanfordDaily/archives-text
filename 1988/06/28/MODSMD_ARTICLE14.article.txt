## Editorial Support Burciagas 
### 
Zapata RFs deserve
community backing

After close to a
year of repeated at
tacks on his home by
anonymous vandals, Casa
Zapata Resident Fellow
Tony Burciaga painted a
sign on his fence that read:
"You are gutless, cowardly
. . . protected by the dark
ness of night and your ig
norance."
Tony and Cecilia Burciaga
should no longer have to
stand alone against the
"gutless" pranksters.
While many feel that res
ponding to vandals lends
credibility to their crimes,
the possibility that the Bur
ciagas may be forced to leave
Zapata must override this
concern, inspiring a commu
nity response to support the
resident fellows in holding
their ground.
Acts of vandalism like last
Sunday's egg-breaking inci
dent are obviously more
than just pranks. They have
wreaked havoc with the
Burciagas' sense of security.
"Pranksters" have
damaged the Burciagas'
cars, used a fire extin
guisher to attack the Zapata
dormitory, and threatened
Cecilia Burciaga by making
prank telephone calls.
While no person should
have to undergo this har

assment, losing two such im
portant community mem
bers to vandalism is partic
ularly distasteful.
Zapata residents have ex
pressed concern for the fu
ture of their house without
the leadership of the Bur
ciagas, who have been resi
dent fellows there for three
years.
Norm Robinson, director
of Residential Education,
has said there is little the
University can do to help
the Burciagas.
While this limited re
sponse may have been ap
propriate months ago when
the attacks seemed less
ominous, it is now time for
the University to publicly
support the resident fellows
and help rally the commu
nity behind their cause.
Stanford does not want to
be known for letting its
most valuable people be
driven away by acts of
chicanery.
According to Tony Bur
ciaga, "the support of the
community over the past
few days has in many ways
overwhelmed the bad things
that happened."
As resident fellows in
Stanford's Chicano-Latino
theme house, the Burciagas
have labored to make count
less students feel at home
in the Stanford community.
It's time that the commu
nity and the University
return the favor.
