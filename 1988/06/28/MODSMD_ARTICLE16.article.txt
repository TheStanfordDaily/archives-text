BSU almost loses fee assess
ment. Seven Phi Delts stage
a silent protest reminiscent
of Ku Klux Klan demonstrations.
Tony and Cecilia Burciaga, resi
dent fellows of the Chicano-Latino
theme house, are harassed in
what may or may not be personal
incidents.
The "usual" racial incidents,
bound to take place at a campus
as culturally diverse as Stanford?
I hope not.
But it does appear, as a spring
issue of Newsweek's Campus
Report recently suggested, that
racism is getting worse on college
campuses, or at least is experi
encing a troublesome resurgence.
And, I would add, the problem is
a result of actions among both
minority and non-minority stu
dents.
Many issues of this year's Daily
contained "racism" stories. The
BSU tended to dominate, with the
Western Culture debate coming
to a close and the BSU's charges
of institutional racism in the
ASSU.
These issues, it seems to me,
are legitimate gripes that the BSU
had every right to pursue. What
stunk about the whole thing was
both the BSU's attitude towards
non-blacks, or non-minorities.

and the reaction of most non
minorities.
The BSU, for its part, showed
a tendency towards abrasiveness
that alienated many otherwise
sympathetic bystanders. Bill
King's June 2 letter to the Daily
is a prime example of this with
statements such as "kiss my black
behind!" and "if you are fuming
mad at me, you are probably one
of those fools that most students
of color don't like." Another ex
ample of this abrasiveness — not
to mention hypocrisy — are the
"Black by Popular Demand"
sweatshirts that many black stu
dents wear.
My roommate this past year,
who is black, calls this slogan "sil
ly." However, to most non-black
students I know, it is offensive.
If white students imitated this —
i.e. by wearing a shirt that read
"White by Popular Demand," —
they would immediately be
branded "racist," and rightly so.
In fact, some students did have
the "tact" (cough) to try and
match the BSU at its own game
by printing up t-shirts that said
"Aryan by the Grace of God."
These t-shirts — in the same vein
as "White by Popular Demand"
— were in one of the Daily's more
spectacular "racism" articles, the

infamous Otero vigil story. And
while most people I know did
criticize those who held the vigil
(heartily) and question their ig
norance in their Ku Klux Klan
type methods (sarcastically), I did
not hear a whole lot of people
jumping to condemn those t
shirts.
Many students I talked to made
comments like: "I can understand
that. Those BSU shirts really bug
me," or "But it's just a joke."
Just a joke? A pretty sick joke,
in my opinion.
What the "Aryan by the Grace
of God" t-shirts symbolize to me
is the sad truth that racism still
runs rampant among the average
Stanford student.
My point is that I don't think
the BSU is helping to eliminate
racism with such heavy-handed
measures as wearing shirts that
say "Black by Popular Demand."
White students, for their part,
are making little effort to under
stand where the BSU is coming
from, and interpret many BSU
actions as unwarranted, offensive
criticism that they try to ridicule.
