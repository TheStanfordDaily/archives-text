## Former Stanford Tree vetoes Big Game hostage swap 
### 
Okay, boys. Let me tell
you a story. It's about
reality.
Once upon a time there was
a remarkable university. Besides
being the premier school in the
United States, including the
great state of California, this
institution was also home to the
world's largest rock and roll
band, hereafter known as the
Band.

In 1972, when this University
changed its mascot from the
Indian to the Cardinal, the
Band chose Sequoia Gigantis,
the giant redwood so plainly
seen on the university's seal, to
be its mascot. From then on
the Band would ask an under
graduate to join their ranks in
the guise of a redwood. That
chosen person would have to
redesign and build their own
costume for their year-long ad
venture.
In March of 1987, I was cho
sen to be the LSJUMB Tree.
My design and attitude was
somewhat different than previ
ous Trees, but let this not blind
you from this simple idea: the
LSJUMB Tree is nothing with
out the Band. Without the
music, the Tree costume is just
a random collection of foam and
cloth.
During my yearlong tenure I
was witness to no less than 15
athletic contests where the blue
and yellow weenies from
Berkeley were trounced in
everything from basketball to
tennis to swimming. Also, we
are the national champions in
baseball for the second year in
a row.
I guess my biggest pleasure
was at the 90th annual Big

Game when I saw three Cal
students (including a cheer
leader) get arrested for behavior
resembling that of British soc
cer fans.
And, of course, we do have
the Axe and will continue to
hold on to it until Cal buys
another football team. But all
this is superfluous.
Last March my Tree responsi
bilities came to an end after our
men's and women's basketball
teams finished their post-season
play. The Band then chose
William Thomas, a hyperactive
frosh, to succeed me and he
soon was working on his new
costume.
But, alas, the Band's schedule
did not allow time for William
to finish his costume in time
for his debut. Instead of donat
ing the old Tree costume to the
San Francisco Home for Or
phaned Handicapped Children
as we had planned, I loaned
William my Tree costume to
use until his costume had been
completed.
In April, the Band went to
Davis and the retired Tree was
to be dropped off at the
children's home on the return
trip. With impeccable timing,
UC-Berkeley students took the
costume from the Band's bus.

The difficult part for the
Band was having to explain to
little Cindy that her friend the
Tree had been taken by the Cal
Bears. On top of her other
problems, Cindy now has a
psychotic condition when it
comes to her teddy bear collec
tion. But I guess that doesn't
bother the Yellow Knights.
So the question remains:
what if someone stole a Tree
costume and no one cared? No
one unless you count little
Cindy and an anonymous group
of students from Berkeley.
As for their demands on ex
changing Oski for a Tree cos
tume (a smelly Tree costume!),
that means absolutely nothing
to anyone except the aforemen
tioned parties. . . .
You've got to be joking!
As for Oski, I have never
seen it (grin), and I don't know
what the plans are for Big
Game Week (gentle laughter).
It's safe to say that Oski has
been reprogrammed and it's
never too late to teach an old
bear new tricks.
So boys, we made another
Tree; you should have gone out
and killed another bear.
