## Americans should rethink our Central America policy 
### 
Last week, with a cavalier
disregard for truth, Secre
tary of State George
Shultz pointed to Nicaragua as
the only "bad, rotten apple" in
the Reagan administration's
otherwise "successful" effort to
promote democracy in Central
America. In fact, U.S. interven
tion has brought only increased
poverty and bloodshed to what
Reagan calls the "emerging
democracies" — El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras. In all
three countries the Un
supported military holds ultim
ate power over fragile civilian
governments, with the result
that political dissenters, jour
nalists, union organizers and
others who dare to challenge
the system are likely to end up
either in detention or as mut
ilated corpses.
In El Salvador, the United
States spends a million dollars a
day to continue a war that has
uprooted half the population
and left the economy in a
shambles. Honduras, with one
of the lowest standards of living
in the Western Hemisphere, is
now a U.S. base for the Contra
war and is run by a military

that has been implicated in
corruption, torture and drug
trafficking. In Guatemala, the
military has killed tens of thou
sands of suspected leftists and
peasants since a U.S.-sponsored
coup overthrew the elected gov
ernment in 1954. Today
Guatemala has the highest con
centration of property ownership
and the lowest wage scale in
Latin America and the military
is once again threatening to
take over the government.
By comparison, Shultz's one
"bad, rotten apple" is a relative
oasis of freedom. The Sandi
nista government has attempted
to improve health facilities and
education, there are no death
squads or torture chambers and
despite the fact that the coun
try has been under armed at
tack since 1981, the opposition
press is allowed to openly sup
port the Contras. Nevertheless,
the Reagan administration is
determined to get rid of the
Sandinista government and the
next few months will determine
whether American dollars will
continue to fuel death and
destruction in Nicaragua.

negotiations between the
Nicaraguan government and the
Contras broke down last month

nation of the entire Supreme
Court, dismantling of the army
and release from prison within
five days of all members of the
former National Guard. The
new demands were the work of
Col. Enrique Bermudez, a top
military commander under the
Somoza regime. He was res
tored to Contra leadership with

the support of the State Depart
ment and"the decisive help of
the CIA," according to the New
York Times. Bermudez bitterly
opposes the peace process, in
sisting that the Sandinistas
must be destroyed by military
force.
The men who tortured and
murdered for Somoza's dictator
ship and who have carried out
equally brutal atrocities as Con
tra leaders obviously have no
interest in democracy, only in
restoring their own power to
oppress and exploit the people
of Nicaragua. If their deliberate
sabotage of the peace negotia
tions is rewarded by continued
U.S. military aid, the people of
Nicaragua will be condemned to
endless war. A few votes in
Congress could make a differ
ence. We should act accordingly
by pressuring candidates and
members of Congress to oppose
aid to the Contras and to reject
once and for all the policies of
the Reagan administration that
have turned Central America
into a cauldron of human
misery.
