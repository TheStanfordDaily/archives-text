# Contract negotiations set to begin
## Stanford workers seek support 
### Laura Jacobson 
Charging the University with
discrimination and trying to
"choke" the union, the United
Stanford Workers yesterday made
a public appeal to rally support
before submitting contract pro
posals to University negotiators
today.
Today's proposals constitute
the first official movement toward
renegotiating the union's current
three-year contract that expires
August 31. USW Steward Linda
Crouse said the main issues the
proposal will address are the in

adequate grievance procedure and
the University's policy of "job
shopping" — contracting jobs to

'They're going to do
everything possible to
bust the union.'

workers outside the union.
Representatives from the ASSU
Council of Presidents, the Black
Student Union, the local Central

Labor Council of the AFL-CIO
and the Rainbow Coalition gath
ered outside union offices yester
day at noon to support the USW
proposal.
In addition to the contract pro
posal, the USW wants neutral ob
servers from the community and
"every major campus group" to
be present at negotiation sessions
to ensure "just and reasonable"
negotiations, according to USW
President Raghib Haqq.
However, Michael Vartain,
from the University's legal office,
said negotiations should not be
open to parties other than the
union and the University. Treat
ing negotiations as a "spectator
sport" will not help the partici
pants reach an early agreement,
he said.
Negotiations should, instead, be
conducted in a "business-like"
manner, he said. "Federal Labor
laws provide that negotiations be
conducted in a private way. . . .
not as a grand debate but as a
serious dialogue."
However, Law Prof. William
Gould said negotiators are free
under U.S. labor law to bargain
in "secret or in the open" as long
as the form of the negotiations
does not impede the free flow of
discussion.
Besides open negotiations,
Crouse said other key issues ad
dressed in the union's proposal
are:
• job security, including the issue
of "job shopping";

• an improved pension plan;
• better medical coverage for un
ion members' dependents;
• an effective health and safety
committee;
• a workable grievance procedure;
and
• a pay raise that provides infla
tion protection.
Because of the current backlog
of grievances, it takes between
three and six years to process
complaints, according to Crouse.
"Job shopping" is another cri
tical issue threatening the union,
Crouse said.
The University's tendency to
give union jobs to outside contrac
tors without the union having the
first chance to fill them is worse
than ever at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator, she said.
Vartain responded that the Uni
versity is abiding by existing
agreements.
"We have acted consistently
with those provisions that deal
with the right to purchase services
from firms in neighboring com
munities outside SLAC," Vartain
said.
