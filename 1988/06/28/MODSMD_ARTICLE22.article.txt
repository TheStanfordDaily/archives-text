## In search of the Dish: A monument to time 
### Heather Goodspeed 
Why did the chicken cross the
road? To get to the satellite dish
on the other side, of course.
No one's chicken to cross the
road and visit the Dish — Stan
ford's very own satellite in the
Foothills above campus. The
spacey looking Dish seems more
appropriate for an episode of "In
Search Of' than the sandstone
and tile tranquility of the Stan
ford campus.
"I think it's a landmark on the
skyline," said Roy Long, assistant
to the director of geoscience and
engineering at the Stanford Re
search Institute and the Wizard
of Dish.
Built in 1962 for space research,
today's Dish only gets "very oc
casional use," according to Long.
It was formally deactivated in
1975.
The Dish has a diameter of 150
feet. Since its construction, NASA
has built four more satellite
dishes with imposing 210 foot
diameters. According to Long, the
world-wide tracking system of the
newer models makes them "far
more accurate and fancy."
During the '60s and '70s, how
ever, scientists used it frequently
for research on the space pro
gram, including extensive study
of electron density in space and
analysis of the planetary atmo
spheres of the moon and Venus.
The first experiments tracked
satellites from the Pioneer pro
gram. Later the Dish followed the
flight of the Mariner space craft
to collect data on Venus' atmos
phere and ionosphere. Unfortu
nately, the Dish found no green
men.

Yet the Dish, like so many Stan
ford activists of the 60s and 70s,
has settled down. "It's essentially
dormant," said Long. He ex
plained that new research pro
grams are possible but, unlike the
Dish, are not on the horizon.
Like a piece of china on an enor
mous scale, it belongs to a match
ing set. The Stanford Dish is one
of a family of four — one, born
in Scotland, now lives in Ger
many, another pierces the skyline
near Boston and a third looks out
on the Chesapeake Bay.
"To the casual observer they
look the same," he commented.
Each one has retired, except for
the one in Germany, which enjoys
regular use. Fast-paced American
technology has pushed the state
side dishes into a life of idleness.
Formerly controlled by the Uni
versity, it is now managed by the
independent Stanford Research
Institute. SRI still runs a regular
maintenance program to keep the
facility operational.
Operational, not aesthetic, the
Dish "does need painting badly,"
said Long. He estimated that it
would cost approximately
$150,000 for a new coat of paint.
The original color was a blue cho
sen to "blend in with the sky."
Its present whiteness, while not
creating a disturbing cacophony
with its surroundings, certainly
stands out.
Long said observers either like
the Dish as a "great attraction"
or hate it as something that
"messes up the skyline."
Many members of the Stanford
community judge for themselves
by heading for the hill in a sturdy
pair of athletic shoes.
