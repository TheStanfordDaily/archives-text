# A
						brighter form of radiation promises many applications

In conjunction with researchers
around the world, Stanford scien
tists have developed an intensely
bright form of radiation that may
open the door to a wide range of
scientific applications.
Although scientists say the full
range of the radiation's uses can
not be known at this point, this
development may help to deter
mine the structures of proteins
and other complex molecules for
the first time.
The tests open the way for ra
diation that is 1,000 times
brighter than previous forms that
scientists have produced. Accord
ing to Herman Winick, deputy di
rector of Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratories, bright
ness is a concern of his
team.
Radiation "can also be power

ful, but power is not necessarily
a condition," said Winick. "Power
can be important, but in many
scientific and technical applica
tions, brightness is more impor
tant."
Brightness is dependent on flux,
which is the number of photons
emitted per second within a given
bandwith, or set of wavelengths.
Scientists define brightness in
terms of the flux, the angle
through which the radiation is
emitted, and the cross-sectional
area of the source of that radia
tion.
Using the technology available
at storage rings such as the Stan
ford Positron Electron Accelerat
ing Ring, and the Positron
Electron Project, scientists have
been able to produce a beam of
electrons of high flux in a small
angle, generating a beam much
brighter than ever before.

The extreme brightness of the
beam is achieved through a phe
nomenon known as "synchrotron
radiation," a type of radiation
produced when a stream of elec
trons is accelerated, usually in a
circle. As the electrons circulate,
each one throws off a beam of
radiation that is emitted in the
shape of a narrow cone.

'The radiation was
once regarded as a
nuisance.'

Ironically, this radiation was in
itially an unplanned side effect of
early experiments in particle
physics.

"The radiation was once re
garded as a nuisance," said
Winick, explaining that an early
synchrotron was "basically a
garden-variety atom smasher. The
original purpose was to bring elec
trons to as high energy as possible
and smash them into nuclei."
By accelerating electrons in a
circle, synchrotrons bring elec
trons to appropriately high energy
levels. In this manner, research
ers were able to gain insights into
the fundamental nature of matter.
However, the fact that this un
desired radiation was produced
led scientists to look for another
method of accelerating particles.
With this in mind, the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center was de
signed.
"SLAC was the answer to
synchrotron radiation," Winick
said.
Although the move from

synchrotron to linear accelerators
was motivated by a desire to avoid
the radiation, scientists have since
found it useful. They developed
storage rings such as SPEAR and
PEP. The advantage of using a
ring such as PEP is tha£ it pro
vides a much stabler and more
constant intensity beam than a
synchrotron.
This radiation is further
boosted by using additional sets
of powerful magnets called "wig
gle™" and "undulators," which
cause the stream of electrons,
while moving in their circular
path, to literally wiggle and und
ulate. This extracts additional en
ergy from the electrons, which in
turn increases the power of the
radiation they emit.
Once synchrotron radiation is
emitted, a specific wavelength of
