Bobby McFerrin
"Simple Pleasures"
Studio musicians rejoice that there is only
one Bobby McFerrin. Gifted with the most
versatile voice around today, McFerrin needn't
ever employ a musician whose instrument he
can readily imitate himself.
This leaves a total of zero musicians needed
and zero musicians used on his brand-new
record "Simple Pleasures." More than just an
a capella album

or a simple jazz
release,
"Pleasures" is a
healthy mix of
lively remakes
and fresh
originals that
pleases the ear
and amazes the
mind. Though it
soon becomes
apparent that
McFerrin is not
a human syn
thesizer, he
reproduces the
instruments he
wish.es (ranging
from drum ma
chine to guitar
to saxanhone)

Though it soon be
comes apparent
that McFerrin is
not a human syn
thesizer, he
reproduces the in
struments he
wishes with an ac
curacy that is un
canny and
awestriking.

with an accuracy that is uncanny and awestrik
ing.
Though his new tunes are interesting
enough, his remakes are inspired. "Drive My
Car" is instantly infectuous and as invigorating
as the Beatles' original version. "Good Lovin' "
is another highlight, where the backing vocals
alone demonstrate McFerrin's impressive
range — somehow, he can hug the bass clef
like Jeffrey Osborne and fly higher than Philip
Bailey.
"Suzie Q" is another great tune
made all the better by McFerrin,
as is the hopping "Sunshine of
Your Love."
But the album's real treasure
is "Don't Worry, Be Happy." With
the possible exception of "Mor
nin' " on A 1 Jarreau's "Jarreau,"
there is not another opening tune
as lively as this one. McFerrin's
creation ensures that even a lis
tener in the foulest of moods will
feel a lot better. If you are living
or working with a real grouch, a
little of this happiness will work
some wonders.
Though the remainder of his
original songs are less engaging
and more abstract, "Simple
Pleasures" as a whole is quite sim
ply pleasant. For those who feel
that synthesizers and glitsy pro
duction techniques have replaced
true talent, McFerrin begs to dif
fer.
