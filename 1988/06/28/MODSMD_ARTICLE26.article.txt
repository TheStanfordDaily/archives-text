Steel Pulse
"State of Emergency"
Mixing rap and reggae might sound as
horrific as blending pickles and ice cream,
yet Steel Pulse manages to pull it off mag
nificently. Sounding like it was made for
what Jacko (the irritating Aussie who pol
lutes Energizer battery ads) terms a "boom
box," the group's hot-off-the-presses cross
over record, "State of Emergency," gives
anyone in its path a funky lift to their day
and a snap to their step.
This is far from a feel good album, how
ever. Made "to commemorate the
Australian Bicentennial Year of Aboriginal
Oppression" and dedicated to the memory

of Steve Biko among others, "State" packs
a serious lyrical punch along with its mu
sical kick.
Purists of either rap or reggae will prob
ably be unimpressed, as this is not a stellar
example of either genre. The laid-back bass
line that defines reggae is often drowned
by the synthesized steel drum, giving the
music a reggae feel but not a wholly reggae
sound. To serious sunsplash fans, the effort
is unimpressive, as it is for rap fans who
hear just glimmers of the music they love.
For the folks who are not afficionados,
however, Steel Pulse creates a solid album.
The hybrid sounds fine to me â€” it is not
the best blend ever, but it certainly works
well here. There are no real surprises as
the album unfolds, but I'll take consistent
quality over rollercoaster records any day.
