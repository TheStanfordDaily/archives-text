"Roll With It"
Steve Winwood seems to have joined
the elite group of superstar artists who
enjoy such stature and support that any
thing they release, whether awesome or
abominable, automatically hits the Bill
board Top 10 and goes platinum. Over
and over, the disincentive for quality
that sudden success instills has turned
creative performers into mere hit fac
tories, spewing out spunky junk at
alarming rates.
Riding on the coattails of his two
straight smashes, "Back in the High
Life" and "Chronicles," the man who
seemed unable to err has unfortunately
done so with his latest outing, "Roll
With It." Diverging from his recent path
of intriguing and exhilirating creations,
Winwood has created an eight-song piece
of pulpish pop that is as uninspired as
it is uninteresting.

Quite simply, the Winwood spark has
vanished. Songs like "Higher Love," the
Grammy Award winner for Record of
the Year two years ago that combined
meaningful lyrics with an infectious
rhythm and ornate harmony, somehow
did not find their way onto this album.
Seeking to fit this formula, "Roll With
It" (the title track, album opener and
first single) attempts to grab the listener
with its polish and pizazz but has little
to offer once it does. Apart from pro
viding an lively beat perfect for doing
household chores to, this song and its
seven cousins cannot muster the spunk
to escape the category of laundry music.
The record's finale, "Shining Song,"
is a lively and palatable song, but it is
sadly too little and far too late to earn
any respect.
In spite of the glaring weaknesses,
"Roll With It" will undoubtedly make
Winwood several million dollars over the
summer. It is too bad that no one else
will get their money's worth.
