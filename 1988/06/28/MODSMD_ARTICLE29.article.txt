## Tyson takes it 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff With wire reports 
Ninety-one seconds.
That's all it took for Mike Tyson to buty Michael
Spinks and retain his undisputed heavyweight cham
pionship last night.
It was the fourth-shortest heavyweight champi
onship fight in history.
A minute into the fight Tyson knocks Spinks to
one knee with a right to the body. Spinks got up
quickly but Tyson was on him like a cat. He con
nected with a left and a right to Spinks' jaw. Spinks
went down on his back.
It was obvious he was not getting up. Referee
Frank Capuccino counted him out and the fight
billed as "Once and for All" was over and out.
"No one on the planet can come near me," Tyson
had boasted. Certainly no heavyweight who is cur
rently campaigning.
