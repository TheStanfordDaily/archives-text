# Drug testing
## Last shots fired in NCAA drug case 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
If police and fire officers cannot
be tested for drugs then college
athletes should not undergo man
datory drug testing, attorney
Susan Harriman argued during
the final hearings of two Stanford
athletes' case against the NCAA
Friday.
Representing Stanford football
player Barry McKeever and soccer
player Jennifer Hill, Harriman
and University lawyer Debra
Zumwalt asked Santa Clara
County Superior Court Judge
Conrad Rushing to find the entire
NCAA drug-testing program in
violation of the constitutional
right of privacy under California
law.
On Dec. 9, Rushing granted a
preliminary injunction that ex
empts all NCAA athletes — except

football and men's basketball
players — from mandatory test
ing.
Although Rushing heard attor
neys' closing statements in March,
he reconvened court on Friday to
discuss other types of drug testing
cases, not involving athletes, that
were decided in the last few
months.
Harriman cited what she called
"key cases" involving fire fighters
and police officers in which it was
ruled that drug-testing was un
constitutional, violating officers'
right to privacy.
"There is a trend that manda
tory drug-testing is unconstitu
tional — which is what the NCAA
engages in," Harriman said in an
interview yesterday. In the case
of police and fire officials, the
courts have ruled that banning
drug testing is justifiable because
the risk against society is not as
great as the infringement of per
sonal rights, according to Har
riman.
"In the case of athletes, the risk
is absolately zero," Harriman
added, saying that "the only per
son that could be harmed is the
athlete himself."
During the hearing, NCAA at
torney Kristina Hanson did not
cite any recent court decisions to

defend the organization's policy.
Hanson was unavailable for
comment yesterday. However,
Rushing himself pointed to a nu
clear power plant case where the
court ruled in favor of testing em
ployees for drug use.
Harriman argued that while
public safety justified testing nu
clear power plant workers, drug
use among athletes poses no risk
to society. "Using a slide rule to
measure risk, our case doesn't
even reach the scale," she said.
During the hearing, NCAA at
torneys cited 11 NCAA athletes

who recently tested positive for
drugs including marijuana,
cocaine and steroids. Zumwalt
and Harriman both questioned
the reliability of the NCAA test,
saying that past tests have been
inaccurate.
Rushing gave Zumwalt and
Harriman 10 days to verify the
tests before officially admitting
them as evidence.
Although Rushing will not
reach a final verdict for at least
10 more days, Harriman said the
judge indicated that an end to the
eight-month-old case "might be
soon."
