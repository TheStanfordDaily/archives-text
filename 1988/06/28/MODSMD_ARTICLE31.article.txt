# NBA draft sure to be full of surprises
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
There are two things certain about
today's NBA draft.
Danny Manning will be selected by
the Los Angeles Clippers with the first
pick.
And, at the end of the day, each
and every team will hold a press con
ference where they will state, "We got
exactly what we wanted."
There are very few impact players
available this year according to the
experts. What that means to you and
I is that there are destined to be at
least as many surprises as usual.
For better or worse, here goes: yet
another draft preview.
1. L.A. Clippers — Danny Manning,
6-10 forward, Kansas. It's unlikely
Manning will have the impact people
think he will. He came of age in the
NCAA Tournament this year, but
parts of his game disappear now and
again. Nonetheless, he does have su
perstar potential.
2. Indiana Pacers — Rik Smits, 7-4
center, Marist. This flying Dutchman
is a project to be sure, but the talent
is there.
3. Philadelphia 76ers — Hersey
Hawkins, 6-3 guard, Bradley. The
Sixers need a shooting guard which
means Hawkins, Rex Chapman or
Mitch Richmond. Hawkins seems the
likely choice because of his incredible
ability as a pure scorer.
4. New Jersey Nets — Chris Morris,
6-8 forward, Auburn. The Nets need
a little of everything and Morris fills
the bill. He's considered the best ath
lete and the best all-around player in
the draft.
5. Golden State Warriors — Tim
Perry, 6-9 forward, Temple. The War
riors need a big forward who can score
and rebound unlike Larry Smith, who
can only rebound, and Tellis Frank,
who can only score.
6. L.A. Clippers — Rex Chapman,
6-4 guard, Kentucky. The Clippers
have stockpiled a number of talented
young forwards recently including
Manning, Ken Norman, Reggie Wil
liams and Joe Wolf — a talented young
guard would be a nice addition to the
ballclub.

7. Phoenix Suns — Charles Smith,
6-10 forward, Pittsburgh. The Suns
could use just about anything and
seem likely to go with a big man.
Smith can do just about anything —
when he wants to. He was missing
in-action often at Pitt.
8. Charlotte Hornets — Mitch Rich
mond, 6-5 guard, Kansas State. As
Dick Vitale would say, Richmond is a
prime-time-player. Expansion teams
need players who can make things
happen without an immensely talented
supporting cast. Richmond is an ex
cellent choice.
9. Miami Heat — Rony Seikaly,
6-11 forward-center, Syracuse. Expan
sion teams also need big men — who
doesn't? — and Seikaly is definitely
big. Whether he'll fare any better than
Bill Wennington, Uwe Blab and other
similarly clunky foreigners is unclear,
but he might.
10. San Antonio Spurs — Derrick
Chievous, 6-7 forward, Missouri.
Chievous is an unknown commodity
in this draft. The bottom line, though,
is that Mis-Chievous, as he's known,
can play basketball.
11. New York Knicks — Harvey
Grant, 6-9 forward, Oklahoma. The
Knicks need a forward who can score
from either the power or small for
ward position. Grant, oddly enough,
can score from either of those loca
tions.
12. Washington Bullets — Will
Perdue, 7-0 center, Vanderbilt. When
Moses Malone takes the free agent
route and heads elsewhere (see below),
the Bullets will have a gaping hole at
center.
13. Milwaukee Bucks — Mark
Bryant, 6-9 forward, Seton Hall.
Bryant is a money player. With Sidney
Moncriefs future in doubt the Bucks
could use one.
14. Phoenix Suns — Jeff Grayer,
6-5 guard, lowa State. Grayer was
brilliant for the Cyclones in his senior
year.
15. Seattle Supersonics — Gary
Grant, 6-3 guard, Michigan. The
Sonics really need a center with more
talent than Alton Lister but there isn't
one available. Grant gives them some
depth at the guard position.
16. Houston Rockets — Willie An

derson, 6-7 guard, Georgia. The Rock
ets need a guard to bolster their ques
tionable back court. Anderson is
multi-talented and should fit in nicely.
17. Utah Jazz — Eric Leckner, 6-11
center, Wyoming The Jazz need a
backup for center Mark Eaton. Leck
ner is a wide body who can provide
the same defensive muscle as Eaton
albeit without the shot-blocking.
18. Atlanta Hawks — Ricky Berry,
6-8 guard-forward, San Jose State.
The Hawks need a center but one
isn't available so they'll go with Berry,
another enigma in this year's draft.
19. Chicago Bulls — Brian Shaw,
6-6 guard, UC-Santa Barbara. The
Bulls need a center (is there an echo
in here?) but are likely to chase free
agent Moses Malone, and are also
likely to sign him. Given that, they'll
go with the best player regardless of
position — that's Shaw.
20. Miami Heat — Jerome Lane,
6-6 forward, Pittsburgh. They got this
pick from Dallas in exchange for pass
ing on Blab, Wennington and Steve
Alford in the expansion draft. That
could turn out to be a great move.
Lane is a poor man's Charles Barkley
— small, but a great rebounder and
possessing a great inside game.
21. Portland Trail Blazers — Dan
Majerle, 6-6 forward, Central Michi
gan. Talk about unknowns, this guy
was virtually unheard of before the
Olympic trials where he came on
strong.
22. Cleveland Cavaliers — Kevin
Edwards, 6-9 forward, Southern Mis
sissippi. The Cavs need some depth
and Edwards should provide it.
23. Denver Nuggets — Charles
Shackleford, 6-10 forward, North
Carolina State. The Nuggets could use
some size up front.
24. Boston Celtics — Everette Step
hens, 6-3 guard, Purdue. With Dennis
Johnson near retirement, the Celts
really need a young guard and should
nab Stephens.
25. Los Angeles Lakers — Rolando
Ferreira, 7-1 center, Houston. Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar is going to play one
more year. After that the pivot will
be empty. The Lakers will take Fer
reira because he's big and may
develop.

6-8 guard-forward, San Jose State.
The Hawks need a center but one
isn't available so they'll go with Berry,
another enigma in this year's draft.
19. Chicago Bulls — Brian Shaw,
6-6 guard, UC-Santa Barbara. The
Bulls need a center (is there an echo
in here?) but are likely to chase free
agent Moses Malone, and are also
likely to sign him. Given that, they'll
go with the best player regardless of
position — that's Shaw.
20. Miami Heat — Jerome Lane,
6-6 forward, Pittsburgh. They got this
pick from Dallas in exchange for pass
ing on Blab, Wennington and Steve
Alford in the expansion draft. That
could turn out to be a great move.
Lane is a poor man's Charles Barkley
— small, but a great rebounder and
possessing a great inside game.
21. Portland Trail Blazers — Dan
Majerle, 6-6 forward, Central Michi
gan. Talk about unknowns, this guy
was virtually unheard of before the
Olympic trials where he came on
strong.
22. Cleveland Cavaliers — Kevin
Edwards, 6-9 forward, Southern Mis
sissippi. The Cavs need some depth
and Edwards should provide it.
23. Denver Nuggets — Charles
Shackleford, 6-10 forward, North
Carolina State. The Nuggets could use
some size up front.
24. Boston Celtics — Everette Step
hens, 6-3 guard, Purdue. With Dennis
Johnson near retirement, the Celts
really need a young guard and should
nab Stephens.
25. Los Angeles Lakers — Rolando
Ferreira, 7-1 center, Houston. Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar is going to play one
more year. After that the pivot will
be empty. The Lakers will take Fer
reira because he's big and may
develop.
There are two things certain about
today's NBA draft.
Danny Manning will be selected by
the Los Angeles Clippers with the first
pick.
And, at the end of the day, each
and every team will hold a press con
ference where they will state, "We got
exactly what we wanted."
There are very few impact players
available this year according to the
experts. What that means to you and
I is that there are destined to be at
least as many surprises as usual.
For better or worse, here goes: yet
another draft preview.
1. L.A. Clippers — Danny Manning,
6-10 forward, Kansas. It's unlikely
Manning will have the impact people
think he will. He came of age in the
NCAA Tournament this year, but
parts of his game disappear now and
again. Nonetheless, he does have su
perstar potential.
2. Indiana Pacers — Rik Smits, 7-4
center, Marist. This flying Dutchman
is a project to be sure, but the talent
is there.
3. Philadelphia 76ers — Hersey
Hawkins, 6-3 guard, Bradley. The
Sixers need a shooting guard which
means Hawkins, Rex Chapman or
Mitch Richmond. Hawkins seems the
likely choice because of his incredible
ability as a pure scorer.
4. New Jersey Nets — Chris Morris,
6-8 forward, Auburn. The Nets need
a little of everything and Morris fills
the bill. He's considered the best ath
lete and the best all-around player in
the draft.
5. Golden State Warriors — Tim
Perry, 6-9 forward, Temple. The War
riors need a big forward who can score
and rebound unlike Larry Smith, who
can only rebound, and Tellis Frank,
who can only score.
6. L.A. Clippers — Rex Chapman,
6-4 guard, Kentucky. The Clippers
have stockpiled a number of talented
young forwards recently including
Manning, Ken Norman, Reggie Wil
liams and Joe Wolf — a talented young
guard would be a nice addition to the
ballclub.

7. Phoenix Suns — Charles Smith,
6-10 forward, Pittsburgh. The Suns
could use just about anything and
seem likely to go with a big man.
Smith can do just about anything —
when he wants to. He was missing
in-action often at Pitt.
8. Charlotte Hornets — Mitch Rich
mond, 6-5 guard, Kansas State. As
Dick Vitale would say, Richmond is a
prime-time-player. Expansion teams
need players who can make things
happen without an immensely talented
supporting cast. Richmond is an ex
cellent choice.
9. Miami Heat — Rony Seikaly,
6-11 forward-center, Syracuse. Expan
sion teams also need big men — who
doesn't? — and Seikaly is definitely
big. Whether he'll fare any better than
Bill Wennington, Uwe Blab and other
similarly clunky foreigners is unclear,
but he might.
10. San Antonio Spurs — Derrick
Chievous, 6-7 forward, Missouri.
Chievous is an unknown commodity
in this draft. The bottom line, though,
is that Mis-Chievous, as he's known,
can play basketball.
11. New York Knicks — Harvey
Grant, 6-9 forward, Oklahoma. The
Knicks need a forward who can score
from either the power or small for
ward position. Grant, oddly enough,
can score from either of those loca
tions.
12. Washington Bullets — Will
Perdue, 7-0 center, Vanderbilt. When
Moses Malone takes the free agent
route and heads elsewhere (see below),
the Bullets will have a gaping hole at
center.
13. Milwaukee Bucks — Mark
Bryant, 6-9 forward, Seton Hall.
Bryant is a money player. With Sidney
Moncriefs future in doubt the Bucks
could use one.
14. Phoenix Suns — Jeff Grayer,
6-5 guard, lowa State. Grayer was
brilliant for the Cyclones in his senior
year.
15. Seattle Supersonics — Gary
Grant, 6-3 guard, Michigan. The
Sonics really need a center with more
talent than Alton Lister but there isn't
one available. Grant gives them some
depth at the guard position.
16. Houston Rockets — Willie An

derson, 6-7 guard, Georgia. The Rock
ets need a guard to bolster their ques
tionable back court. Anderson is
multi-talented and should fit in nicely.
17. Utah Jazz — Eric Leckner, 6-11
center, Wyoming The Jazz need a
backup for center Mark Eaton. Leck
ner is a wide body who can provide
the same defensive muscle as Eaton
albeit without the shot-blocking.
18. Atlanta Hawks — Ricky Berry,
6-8 guard-forward, San Jose State.
The Hawks need a center but one
isn't available so they'll go with Berry,
another enigma in this year's draft.
