## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Stanford's former Vice Provost
for Academic Planning and De
velopment William Chace may be
chosen as the next president of
Wesleyan University in Connecti
cut.
After a seven-month-long
search involving hundreds of can
didates from around the country,
both Chace and Dean of Admis
sions Jean Fetter were selected
among the three final candidates
for the job, according to a reliable
source who asked to remain anon
ymous.
However, Fetter, who said she
was "very happy to confirm" her
candidacy, withdrew from the
running just over a week ago
citing "a variety of personal and
professional reasons."
Chace was not available for
comment. He is currently in Siena,
Italy, leading a walking tour for
Stanford alumni.

Bobby Clark, director of Public
Affairs at Wesleyan, said the uni
versity would choose a new pres
ident "relatively soon," but
declined to name a date or elab
orate on the proceedings of the

[presidential
search commit-
Itee. He added
that the commit
tee must meet
again before
making a final de
cision.
In March,
Chace, who is also
an English pro-

fessor, was one of four final can
didates interviewed for the
presidency of Reed College in
Oregon. Although he was not se
lected for the job, at that time
Chace expressed interest in a job
at a small liberal arts college.
Contacted in Italy, Chace's wife
Joan agreed that Wesleyan fits

the description of a liberal arts
college. She would not speculate
further on her husband's interest
in or chances for the Wesleyan
presidency.
Tom Moser, currently the act
ing chair of the English Depart
ment, said he was unaware of
Chace's job prospects at Wes

leyan. He added, however, that he
thinks "Bill is terrific. Wesleyan
would be lucky to get him."
Chace, who strongly supported
retaining the core list in Stan
ford's controversial Western Cul
ture debate, was a vice provost
here between 1985 and 1988. He
stepped down in May when the
term of his office expired.
'In March, Chace said if he was
ever to leave Stanford, "it would

not be out of resentment (stem
ming from the Western Culture
controversy). Stanford has treated
me with great respect."
If Chace is chosen for the job,
he would replace Colin Campbell
as the president of Wesleyan.
Campbell, who has been president
there for 18 years, is leaving the
post to become the president of
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in
New York.
