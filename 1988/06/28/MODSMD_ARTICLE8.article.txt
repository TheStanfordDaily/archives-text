# All shook up
## 
### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
Many Hay Area residents were startled yesterday
at 11:43 a.m. by the shake, rattle and roll of an
earthquake that measured 5.0 on the Richter scale.
According to Jan Berry of San Jose's Public In
formation Office, the quake was centered 16 miles
south of San Jose on the San Andreas fault. She
said that no aftershocks and "not even minor
damage" had been reported to either San Jose's
police or fire departments.
On campus, the quake gave buildings in the Main
Quad a stiff jolt â€” the same buildings that were
declared vulnerable to earthquakes in a report ear
lier this year.
Janice Lew, a secretary in the Geology Corner
that was declared unsteady earlier this year, said
"no one reported any damage." She did say that
she felt the quake and that "pictures were shaking
for about 10 seconds."
According to the University's Work Control Cen
ter, the only damage reported on campus occurred
in Building 310, which houses the Office of Planning
and Management, where a light fixture fell.
Jonathan Ryan, project manager for Facilities
Project Management, said late yesterday that the
reinforcement of the Quad has not yet been com
pleted. Ryan described the project as still being in
the analysis stage, noting that the buildings in the
Quad vary in types and strength of construction.
