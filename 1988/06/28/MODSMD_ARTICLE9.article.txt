## 
### David Cline 
The contest for the congressional seat
in the 12th District race is looking to be
come a battle between "the intellectual"
and"the hands-on politician."
With no incumbent in the running and
no recognized front-runner, Republican
Tom Campbell and Democrat Anna Eshoo
are in Washington D.C. this week, garner
ing financial and political support.
Here at home, the local campaigns are
seeking to separate the candidates by em
phasizing their very different political back
grounds and experiences.
While Eshoo is a local politician who has
been the San Mateo County Supervisor for

six years, Campbell is a Stanford law pro
fessor who has experience at the national
level with the Federal Trade Commission
and the Attorney General's Office.
"Eshoo is a proven problem solver who
has held elective office and has been suc
cessful in choosing things for her constit
uents," said Yvonne Ryzak, Eshoo's cam
paign consultant.
"Campbell has almost no experience in
government," she said, adding that there
is a "clear difference" between the two
candidates.
On the other side, Campbell's Campaign
Manager Karin Miranda declined to com
ment on the differences between the can
didates.

"While Eshoo is talking about Tom
Campbell, Tom Campbell is going to be
busy talking about Tom Campbell,"
Miranda said, noting Campbell's experience
as director of the Federal Bureau on Com
petition and his work on the trade deficit.
"Tom Campbell represents the kind of
leader the district is used to having in Ed
Zschau. He reflects this district," she said.
A former congressmen from this district,
Zschau was popular with voters, according
to Miranda.
Miranda said charges that Campbell does
not understand the issues of the district
are "ridiculous."
She added that one of his strengths is
his ability to motivate people.

"An outsider isn't able to generate the
support that we've been seeing. Tom Camp
bell inspires in people a level of commit
ment that you don't see in other cam
paigns," Miranda said.
Rysak said Eshoo also has a broad basis
of support — "not limited to Democrats."
"It'll be a grassroots campaign. We will
be taking it to the streets," Rysak said.
Central to the campaign are women's
issues, and both candidates have promised
to spend extensive time on the issues if
elected.
While in office, Eshoo worked on
childcare issues for San Mateo County. Ac
cording to Rysak, Eshoo has a "proven
record" on women's issues.
