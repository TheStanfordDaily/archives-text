Go ahead. Live it up while you can.
Eat anything and everything
you want, from those processed
meats to fatty dairy products
to that extra measure of salt. But
do it soon. Because poor eat
ing habits can lead to high blood
cholesterol, which can result
in clogged arteries, a damaged
heart, and an early death. The
American Heart Association urges
you to eat sensibly. Avoid food
high in fat, salt and cholesterol.
Avoid eating too much. It could
keep you from an early grave and
let you live it up a little longer.
