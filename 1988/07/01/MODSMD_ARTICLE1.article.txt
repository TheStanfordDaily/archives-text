# U.S. Senator comes to Campbell's defense

Controversy surrounding the retirement
of Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell hit the U.S. Senate floor Wed
nesday.
Calling Campbell's ouster a "closing of
the American mind," Republican Senator
Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming said if Camp
bell is forced to retire then "the United
States will be the loser."
In May, the Stanford Board of Trustees
unanimously voted that the 28-year Hoover
director step down from his post when he
turns 65 next year. Campbell, who has
threatened to sue Stanford, said he wants
to remain director until he is 70.
"This is not a matter of putting retired
horses out to pasture. Nor is this a matter
of blind enforcement of a retirement at 65,"
Wallop said.
"The problem quite starkly is that the
people who run Stanford are obviously not
satisfied with the political balance that's
overwhelmingly on their side."
Wallop pointed to University President
Donald Kennedy and Stanford Board of
Trustees President Warren Christopher as
"perpetrators of this act of intolerance."
He said both men hope to rid Stanford of
conservative thinkers to further their own
political gains.
Wallop urged the Senate to follow the
ongoing controversy between Campbell and
Stanford because decision makers here
have the potential to affect national policy.
Christopher is an "obvious candidate" for
secretary of state, and Kennedy is also in
line for a cabinet position under the next
presidential administration, according to
Wallop.
Wallop said he would bring Campbell's
case up again if either Kennedy or Chris
topher comes before the Senate as
nominees seeking confirmation. "If and
when that happens," Wallop predicted both

men will have "much explaining to do."
Under the Carter Administration, Chris
topher was deputy secretary of state and
Kennedy was commissioner of the Food
and Drug Administration. Both men have
denied any intention of pursuing a cabinet
post.
Calling Wallop's prediction a "threat that
is not at all credible," Kennedy said he has
"no interest" in a cabinet post.
Kennedy said he was not surprised by
Wallop's speech because U.S. senators often
bring up personal matters — including
farewells — during Congressional sessions.
"The Congressional record is a receptacle
for almost anything," he said.
Kennedy described Wallop as a politician
who is "as far right as Jessie Helms." Con
sidering the conservative source, Wallop's
charges against Stanford did not come un
expectedly, he said.
But Campbell predicted Wallop's speech
"may surprise Stanford trustees" and the
Senate might be in store for even more
speeches decrying Stanford's decision to
retire him.
"Fun and games can be played on both
sides," he said. "I know a lot of senators
well on both sides of the aisle."
Campbell and Wallop are not personal
friends, according to Campbell.
A strong advocate of the Strategic De
fense Initative, Wallop has worked closely
with Hoover Senior Research Fellows Ed
ward Teller and Angelo Codevilla.
Campbell agreed with Wallop's charges
that liberal politicians were forcing him
into retirement.
However, in a press statement released
yesterday, Christopher denied that political
motivation was behind the trustees' deci
sion.
"The decision regarding Dr. Campbell
was reached unanimously by a remarkably
diverse 30-person board of trustees reflect
ing a very wide spectrum of opinion," the
statement read.
