# Gorbachev battles for reforms
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
determined that his reform program will not be
weakened by conservatives, intervened forcefully in
the debate at a special Communist Party conference
Thursday to press for the radical reorganization of
the Soviet Union's political system.
Without sweeping reforms, Gorbachev told the
conference, the Soviet Union's socialist system will
be seriously endangered, and without sharing power
more widely, he implied, the Communist Party could
lose power altogether.
As party conservatives, working in the committees
drafting the conference documents, sought to reduce
the impact of the changes with vague language,
Gorbachev took his case to the conference itself in
a stirring, 40-minute appeal for the delegates' sup
port. •
"The people are called upon to place a decisive,
revolutionary role — not the party, its staff or any
other element of the Soviet political system," Gor
bachev declared. 'But some are afraid of the process
of democratization under way in the country and
the stirrings of social thought here, and they have
fallen into a panic."
The center of the political reforms, he told con
ference delegates, is the revival of the system of

local and regional councils, known as soviets, and
the establishment of a strong national legislature,
along with the separation of the party from admin
istration of the government and management of the
economy.
"Socialism, Leninism — that is the creative ac
tivity of the masses," Gorbachev said in an emotional
speech later broadcast on national television.
Taking the floor for the second time at the con
ference, he said there was a "certain lack of under
standing" of the proposals he had made Tuesday
at the conference opening, and he urged the
delegates to focus on the proposed political reforms.
While he was assured of winning the delegates'
endorsement of virtually the entire program he out
lined, Gorbachev apparently was encountering op
position in the committees where party sources said
conservatives were attempting to weaken the resolu
tions.
This back-room maneuvering, plus the desire of
261 more delegates to speak — only 44 have spoken
in the first three days — probably mean that the
conference will go into the weekend, rather than
closing Friday as planned.

Mikhail Gorbachev votes Tuesday at his party's first general con
ference in nearly 50 years. Gorbachev called for sweeping changes,
including the creation of a president with duties similar to those
of many Western heads of state.
