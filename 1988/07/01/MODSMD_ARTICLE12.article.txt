Probe focuses on Navy scandal
WASHINGTON — The criminal inquiry into
Pentagon corruption is centered predominantly
on present and former Navy officials and so far
has turned up no evidence against former Navy
Secretary John Lehman, a naval investigator re
portedly told members of Congress yesterday.
Sources who attended a closed-door briefing
for the House Armed Services Committee said
Rear Adm. J.E. Gordon, head of the Naval In
vestigative Service, and several other Department
of Defense officials told them that the investiga
tion centers "95 percent" on the relationships
between the Navy, consultants and contractors.
"I think we have a substantial scandal on our
hands," Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., said after
hearing from Hudson. He reported that Hudson
disclosed he was looking at 75 to 100 contracts

let by the Department of Defense.
Alpine ceremony marks schism
ECONE, Switzerland — An arch-conservative
French prelate consecrated four bishops in an
Alpine meadow here yesterday, provoking the
first major schism in the Roman Catholic Church
in more than a century.
Spurning a last-minute command from Pope
John Paul II to cancel the ceremony and go to
Rome, 82-year-old Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre
went ahead with the consecrations of the four
kneeling priests at 11:44 on a sultry mountain
morning. At that instant, he and they became
ecclesiastical outlaws in the Vatican's eyes, ex
communicated for rejecting papal authority.
