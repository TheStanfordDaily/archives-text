Age isn't the reason
for Campbell ouster

Fess up.
Hoping to look like
Mr. Nice Guy, Stan
ford is hiding behind a
"mandatory" retirement
policy for Hoover Director
W. Glenn Campbell that is
outdated, arbitrary and un
fair.
Stanford officials should
fess up and admit that they
are not retiring Campbell —
they're firing him.
On May 12, the Stanford
Board of Trustees sent
Campbell a letter packed
with praise for his "envi
able" achievements at
Hoover. The letter also told
Campbell he must step
down as director when he
turns 65 next April.
The trustees say their de
cision was based solely on a
1959 agreement between
Herbert Hoover and the
University that established
65 as the retirement age for
Hoover directors.
With the possibility that
today's retirement age is in
creasing to 70 — witness a
U.S. president who is 77 —
this 19-year-old policy is not
sufficient justification for
retiring Campbell.
Instead of citing an out
dated policy, the University
should acknowledge the
many valid reasons it has

for asking Campell to leave
— including his narrow
mindedness and aggressive
behavior that has often ex
acerbated problems between
the University and Hoover.
Here at Stanford the re
tirement age for professors
is 70. There is no logic for
allowing scholars five years
more freedom across the
board than executives.
Furthermore, at the same
meeting where the trustees
voted to oust Campbell, they
appointed former University
President Richard Lyman,
who is older than Campbell,
to head Stanford's new In
stitute of International Re
lations.
Trustee President Warren
Christopher said Lyman's
special qualifications make
him an exception to the age
65 policy.
Ironically, the trustees'
own actions acknowledge
that retirement should be
based on individual circum
stances .
The trustees are even of
fering a 25 percent salary
increase to entice Campbell
into leaving his post.
To avoid a Hoover direc
tor dynasty, the University
and Hoover could establish
a new policy stipulating that
directors would come up for
re-evaluation every 10
years.
Though perhaps cumber
some, at least a re
evaluation policy is an
honest one.
