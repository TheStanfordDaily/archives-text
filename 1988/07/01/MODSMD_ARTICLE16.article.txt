## Funnies aren't too funny 
### 
THERE WERE yuks galore
a couple of months back
when our Chief Executive,
to show nations how detached he
was from everyday affairs,
revealed what section of the paper
he read first.
"The funnies, like all Ameri
cans," he said.
The Village Voice's Jules Feiffer
had a field day with that remark
— he departed from his usual Joe
Blows and drew a couple of
anthropomorphic animals sitting
in a meadow with beanies and
neon ties on their "persons." The
punch line was the animals
screaming at Ronnie to wake up
and get the troops out of Hon
duras.
Canine demagogues aside, it al
ways interests me to see how
people react to that plum section
of the paper, the funnies page.
You can always tell an average
citizen by the company he keeps
among the cartoons, whether it's
Dagwood and Blondie or Pat Olip
hant.
Different papers obviously have
different tastes. Papers like the
Times-Tribune and my hometown
denizen, the Pasadena Star-News,
go bonkers over cutesy homespun
stuff, humor that won't make con
stipated old folks spill coffee on
their laps and call in angry sub
scription cancellations. You know

what I'm talking about because a
lot of you probably grew up on
the stuff: "Peanuts," "Broom
Hilda," ' Momma."
The creators of these venerable
strips are the men who call the
shots. They get the prominent
Sunday spots, the brightest colors,
the biggest sizes.
They say that Charles Schulz,
the Zeus of this Olympus, has
staying power because he captures
an essential element of the Amer
ican condition in his evergreen
kiddie cast. Could be. But Schulz
brings in the subscribers, who fig
ure any paper carrying Charlie
Brown must reflect solid home
town values, and though
"Peanuts" hasn't had an edge
since the fall of Saigon, Schulz
still stands at the top of the heap.
As I said, different papers have
different tastes. But some tastes
are more equal than others. I
think it's fairly amazing that
"The Far Side" and "Calvin and
Hobbes" have made the inroads
they have, or at least I used to
think so. Now even Larson and
Watterson are getting stale (not
to mention Garfield and Opus).
Oh well. There's always the oc
casional underground comic —
"Life in Hell" or "Ernie Pook's
Comic" — to serve as antidotes
to the anesthesia of institutional
ized cuteness. And, in a way, I

suppose the cuteness is inevitable.
After all, people turn to the
funnies to be amused, not
upbraided. But I find myself long
ing for at least one strip that
aspires to be something more than
a respite.
I read the funnies first thing
every day, like all Americans. But
when it all gets too gimmicky and
entrepreneurial for its own good,
I just want to retreat to the front
page. The company that manufac
tures those adorable (retch!) car
window Garfield dolls offers to re
imburse, free of charge, anyone
whose pet is stolen. (These dolls
are evidently favorite targets of
car thieves.) I'd like to break every
car window with a Garfield jeering
fatly out at me and bankrupt the
company. Funnies are supposed
to be funny, not free-market.
Maybe Hobbes will do some
thing about all this.
