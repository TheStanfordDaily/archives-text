## 'Black' shirts express pride and joy of being black 
### 
THE DAILY'S summer
editorial page editor, Jen
nifer Schmid, while some
how attempting to demonstrate
a need for more tolerance,
resurrected an issue that in my
mind had been settled long ago:
the wearing of "Black by
Popular Demand" sweatshirts.
Schmid's column opened with
several racially offensive inci
dents in which people of color
were primary victims. It ended

with about 30 words, concluding
that white students make little
effort to understand the BSU.
What lies between, however, is
an illogical diatribe about the
"abrasiveness" of the BSU, and
those black students who wear
those hypocritical sweatshirts.
What we have here is a non
sequitur. "Black by Popular
Demand" sweatshirts are no
more racist, no more hypocriti
cal, and should be no more
threatening to the average

white than a "Kiss me, I'm
Irish" button. It expresses the
pride and joy of being black.
"Black by Popular Demand"
sweatshirts are hardly
synonymous with an "Aryan by
the Grace of God" shirt.
"Aryan" has very strong racist
connotations. It has come to
mean Nazi, and anyone who
would equate the black civil
rights movement in this country
to the Nazi movement that
swept across Europe is beyond

rational thought.
Schmid's column follows a
reactionary blueprint. She, and
others who are so disturbed by
the shirts, must not blame the
wearers for their discomfort.
Their problems stem from
within, and until they can
wrestle with themselves to dis
cover what really bothers them,
then racial tolerance will remain
unreachable.
