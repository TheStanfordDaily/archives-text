# Burciagas thank their supporters

Every time something bad
happened our parents would tell
us, "No hay mal que por bien
no venga" â€” there is no wrong
from which goodness is not
reaped. These words never
sounded more true until after
the vandalism we suffered.
The response we received
from the Stanford community
was overwhelming. We would
like to take this opportunity to
thank all who called, wrote
notes and sent flowers. Some of
the people we had never met. It
made our ordeal less painful
and reminded us that this is a

community, not just a Universi
ty.
We never seriously considered
leaving our positions as Resi
dent Fellows but it was a reac
tion and message that no one
should have to live under such
circumstances. This was not
only cowardly vandalism, it was
terrorism.
We have found it not to be
true that "there is little the
University can do to help." The
"University" is the community,
not the administration and we
appreciate the community sup
port.
The attempt to minimize the
vandalism as personal and dis
associate it from the "Universi
ty" supports vandalism. One

suspected vandal involved in the
Zapata parking lot incident was
chastized by Cecilia for bother
ing and insulting one of our
Resident Assistants. This was
done in her capacity as a Resi
dent Fellow. We fail to see the
resulting vandalism as a per
sonal matter.
We do not know who the
vandals were and don't believe
the incidents were related. We
thought some of the incidents
were nothing more than pranks
and so were not reported. There
is also the hesitancy to cry
"Wolf!" every time we smell
racism. We tire of acting like
firemen, correcting, speaking
out in meetings and social occa
sions, running from one racist

incident to another.
For those quick to disclaim
racism, we quote these lines
from a poem on racism by
Lorna Dee Cervantez: "I know
you don't believe this, to you
this is nothing but faddish ex
aggeration. But they are not
shooting at you."
As painful as the ordeal has
been, we have been touched by
a community of people who
care. And as a community we
have moral and social obliga
tions. We must instill the idea
of community to students. Too
many arrive with a transient
state of mind of Stanford only
as a University, not as a com
munity.
