## Campus art centers alive and well during summer 
### Jessica Yates 
With difficult academic
schedules during the schoolyear,
many students never think to visit
the art gallery or the art museum
on the Stanford campus. Now that
summer has finally come and
there is time to relax, Stanford's
two museums beckon the uni
tiated as well as the art historian.
Both the art gallery and the
museum have something different
to offer; each caters to an entirely
different mood.
The Stanford University
Museum of Art, located in a
blazingly hot enclave off Palm
Drive, is spacious and austere in
structure. It has a collection rang
ing from antiquity to the present,
and its exhibition program
presents an equally varied series
of changing art shows.

This summer's temporary ex
hibitions include David Park's
"Works on Paper." The drawings,
collages and gouaches presented
in this collection span virtually
the full range of the Bay Area
artist's career.
However, the exhibit em
phasizes the works of his last five
years, completed after he discov
ered he had cancer. They commu
nicate his deliberate final state
ment, a statement that forms a
powerful artistic bequest. Some
of his final work on display is
considered to be his most power
ful. A free guided tour of the col
lection is being held on Thursdays
at 12:15 through August 14th.
Also on display at the museum
are some 30 examples of the
recent work of Anna Wu Weak
land, a contemporary artist born
in Shanghai and now residing in

the Bay Area. The exhibition dis
plays her current interest in
monotype and collograph. Her
prints are inspired by Chinese cal

forms and the symbols of Zen Bud
dhism and Taoism. The exhibit
will run through August 14th.

floor of the museum that displays
ivory pieces. Within a glass case
in the center of the room lurks
an ivory dragon. The detail is in
tricate with spindly skin, a curvy
tail, a fearsome red tongue and
livid eyes. For some, it will conjure
up childhood fears of fairytale
monsters.
The B. Gerald Cantor Rodin
Sculpture Garden is another
must-see in the Stanford vicinity.
The garden carries the name of

structure symbolic of the entrance
to Dante's "Inferno." Expect to
see a lot of shiny black figures
writhing under the glare of the
afternoon sun. Many of the fig
ures are derived from mythology,
though some are partial figures
with painfully twisted torsos. The

on the sculptures was anticipated

The garden has no fence and is

always illuminated, allowing art
afficionados to visit any time, day
or night. Museum docents give
tours of the collection weekly.
Secluded in a shady nest of
trees near History Corner is the
Art Gallery. One feels no desire
to yawn in the gallery; its two
intimate rooms allow one to view
an entire collection without having
to climb stairs or get lost in a
labyrinth of tiny rooms. Its tem
porary exhibitions promise never

to bore or exhaust even the
museum-weary student.
This summer the art gallery
presents eighty-four works on
paper by the internationally ac
claimed artist Wayne Thiebaud.
Expect to see a whole lot of the
everyday — cars, cupcakes with
pink icing, empty streets, naked
human figures. . . . But just be
cause the subject matter isn't re
vealing or shocking doesn't mean
it's boring. It's refreshing in its
lack of pretention and somewhat
lively and colorful. Tours are given
at 2 p.m. Sundays starting July
10 through August 14.
The art museum and the art
gallery are temptingly close, so on
a lazy Sunday when you have
nothing to do but read the paper,
why not explore art on campus?
You can even finish your cultural
outing with a picnic in the Rodin
Sculpture garden.
