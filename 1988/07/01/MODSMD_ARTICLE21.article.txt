schedules during the schoolyear,
many students never think to visit
the art gallery or the art museum
on the Stanford campus. Now that
summer has finally come and
there is time to relax, Stanford's
two museums beckon the uni

at 12:15 through August 14th.

are some 30 examples of the

in Shanghai and now residing in
