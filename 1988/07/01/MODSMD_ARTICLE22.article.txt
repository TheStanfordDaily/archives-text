"Ail right — let's light that big sucker."
"Go ahead Grandpa. Oh, and Suzie, keep that sparkler away
from the dog."
"Hey mom, where's the mustard?"
SSSPlTTtttsss
"There it goes: they call this one the Big Bomber. This'll be
great.
"My, this will be nice. Suzie, keep outta the pie. Wait for desert."
SPUT...SPUT...SPUT
"I dunno, dad, looks like a dud."
"Are you sure this thing is OK, Martha?"
"They told me just to light it. Stay back from the fuse, Johnny.
It may still be lit."
Fizzle...fizzle...fizz
"Reminds me of when I was just a youngster. 'Friend a mine
picked up some fizzlin' firecrackers. Nearly blew his face clear
off."
Piff.
"Well, we got some nice pie in the kitchen."

You know them, and you know them well. They are the
Fourth of July blues. Stubborn charcoal, obnoxious relatives,
messy condiments: Americana at its finest. Thankfully, relief is
just beyond your own backyard. Shake those relatives, douse
the barbeque and head out of the house for a hassle-free holiday.
All That Jazz
Frost Amphitheater is hosting the Preservaton Hall Jazz Band
on Monday for some New Orleans-style entertainment. You'll
see straw hats and pin-striped suits stepping to the beat of
bassoons and bass horns. This is as close to a traditional Inde
pendence Day celebration you'll find outside of the South. It's
a special occasion, so try not to miss it.
Real Chili Ain't Got No Beans
But if you want to sample different fare for the Fourth, go
by Mitchell Park and check out the Chili Cook-off, hosted by
Compadres Restaurant. They'll have lots of chili plus other
edibles, drinkables and music. The event is casual, but they'll
be sure to keep you entertained.
Spots For Tots
If you are toting little ones with you, you might want all-day
entertainment. The Marin County Fair, open the Fourth, is
showcasing "The Magic of Lucasfilm," in addition to typical Fair
activities. The behind-the-scenes exhibit will surely fascinate
even "difficult" children.
The Fair is also showcasing the Marin County Blues Festival
on the 2nd and 3rd, so don't think you have to wait until
Monday to get out of the house.
City Nights
If you are taking someone out
for that big dinner date in the
City on your day off, you'll
impress them if you actually know
something to do beforehand. Non
chalai >y suggest that you stroll
down Fillmore Street, and when
you happen on their Jazz & Art
Faire, you can suavely remark to
your date how there is always
something to do in the City if you
know it well.
Second Only To Souza
If you're looking for fireworks,
I recommend going to the Amer
ican Pops Concert & Fireworks
with the San Francisco Symphony
at Shoreline.

You can enjoy Gershwin,
Tchaikovsky and noteworthy
others in your jeans and tennis
shoes, and have front-row seats
for a "fantastic finale of phenom
enal fireworks."
Just Say No To Alliteration
But if you're like me, you don't
have the dinero to spend on an
extravagant outing. I suggest you
unload your books, refill your
backpack with some chips and
Buds, and head up to Cowhill.
Find the two cement water
tanks, (up the path across
Junipero Serra from Frenchman's
Road, to your left) and settle down
for the free panoramic display. If
it's a clear night, you can see five
different firework shows from this
cold but cozy seat. It's an un
beatable deal, so don't spoil it by
leaving Mr. Bud or Mr. Frito lying
around.
