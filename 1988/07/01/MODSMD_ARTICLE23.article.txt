ing on a couch this blistering sum
mer, unable to entertain yourself
with anything but musty reruns

Killer Tomatoes" your idea of a
classic? Did you sit through "Star
Trek: The Motion Picture" when
everyone else walked out, just so
you didn't miss any bit of trivia?

these questions, or even if you
demonstrate good taste, the Acad
emy of Science Fiction, Fantasy
and Horror will make a really cod
addition to your scalding summer.

to pass up.
