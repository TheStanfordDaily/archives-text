"The Presidio"
Palo Alto Square
3000 El Camino Heal
Palo Alto
With a sensuous duo like Mark
Harmon and Meg Ryan, plus
Oscar-toting master actor Sean
Connery, all starring in a single
movie how can a profit-minded
producer go wrong?
Well, he or she could make a
really crummy movie. But fortu
nately that isn't the case here.
"The Presidio," though not the
cream of this summer's crop, pro
vides a two-hour dose of action,
excitement, emotion and humor
large enough to warrant a
viewing.
Set in San Francisco, the story
revolves around a murder at the
officers' club on the bay front
army base, the Presidio. Detective
Jay Austin (Harmon), a former
MP there, lands the assignment,
much to his and his former boss
Col. Caldwell's (Connery) chagrin.
See, the two don't get along too
well, a situation not improved
when Austin falls for the colonel's
daughter (Ryan). Thus, the simple
mystery story grows steamy and
sordid, humorous and huffy.
On all counts, each of the three
stars puts in a fine, balanced per
formance that smooths out some
of the unevenness in the film's

pacing. Whether jesting or joust
ing, the portrayals always seem
pretty close to the mark.
But the real gem is Jack Warden
("Bad News Bears" among actual
masterpieces). As the crusty
Sergeant-Major McClure, Warden
is invigorating and amusing, add
ing key sparks and bits of humor
at just the right time.
If you have a few hours and a
few dollars to spend, catch "The
Presidio."

"Big"
Century- Cinema 10
Sticrlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
I had never been to Century
Cinema 10 before this movie. I
am still in awe of the place. I am
in awe of both the $6 ticket prices
and the airport-like cinema.
1 originally planned on seeing
the movie "Who framed Roger
Rabbit?," but when it sold out, I
just couldn't go home. I had to
stay and enjoy this great theater.
So I bought a ticket for "Big."
The plot of the movie "Big" is
less than original. When first set
tling into my seat at the theater,
I thought, "here goes another
cliched movie about a boy trapped
in a man's body."
But, somehow, Tom Hanks

pulled it off. "Big" is a thoroughly
entertaining movie. I probably
wouldn't see it again, but it is
the kind of movie that is worth
seeing once.
Hanks, playing the 12-year-old
Josh Baskin in a 35-year old body,
manages to capture the man
nerisms and character of a boy

with incredible skill.
The real gem of "Big", besides
Hanks, is Robert Loggia. Loggia
plays MacMillan, the owner of
MacMillan's Toys and Josh's first
boss.
All told, "Big" is definitely
worth a look.

"Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
Sometimes the greatest
pleasures come from adding just
a little extra to an old classic, like
Double Stuff Oreo cookies. "Who
Framed Roger Rabbit," a
Touchstone Pictures release
produced by Steven Spielberg,
blends a collection of the finest in
classic cartoons with modern tech
nology to create a real summer
treat.
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
stars Bob Hoskins as Eddie
Valiant, a washed-up, stereo
typical, alcoholic, 1940's private
eye who will take any case he can
get to pay back his barmaid
girlfriend.
What sounds like a bad Mike
Hammer episode becomes an
amazing cinematic feat when you
discover that Roger, Jessica and
a host of other personalities are
all animated cartoon characters
that live and breathe (literally)
alongside humans in the real
world. The cartoons are flawlessly
inserted into the film, making the
premise quite believable as well
as infinitely entertaining.

When 12-ycar-old Josh Buskin (Tom Hanks) suddenly finds himself in
35-year-old body, his best friend and favorite silly-string victim is just one
of the folks in for a "Big" surprise.
technical achievements for the
first five minutes or so, movie
goers will also quickly discover
that "Roger Rabbit" sports an en
tertaining plot as well as slick in
teraction between the human
characters and the animated
Roger, Jessica and such classic

stars as Mickey Mouse, Bugs
Bunny and Betty Boop.
The movie is crammed full of
allusions to classic cartoons, and
viewers who grew up with Bugs
and the gang will find these little
tags extremely enjoyable. Even if
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
doesn't evoke a twinge of nostal
gia, moviegoers will find passing
up summer reruns in favor of this
flick an incredibly wise choice.

army base, the Presidio. Detective
Jay Austin (Harmon), a former
MP there, lands the assignment,
much to his and his former boss
Col. Caldwell's (Connery) chagrin.
See, the two don't get along too
well, a situation not improved
when Austin falls for the colonel's
daughter (Ryan). Thus, the simple
mystery story grows steamy and
sordid, humorous and huffy.
On all counts, each of the three
stars puts in a fine, balanced per
formance that smooths out some
of the unevenness in the film's

pacing. Whether jesting or joust
ing, the portrayals always seem
pretty close to the mark.
But the real gem is Jack Warden
("Bad News Bears" among actual
masterpieces). As the crusty
Sergeant-Major McClure, Warden
is invigorating and amusing, add
ing key sparks and bits of humor
at just the right time.
If you have a few hours and a
few dollars to spend, catch "The
Presidio."

"Big"
Century- Cinema 10
Sticrlin Rd. at 101

I had never been to Century
Cinema 10 before this movie. I
am still in awe of the place. I am
in awe of both the $6 ticket prices
and the airport-like cinema.
1 originally planned on seeing
the movie "Who framed Roger
Rabbit?," but when it sold out, I
just couldn't go home. I had to
stay and enjoy this great theater.
So I bought a ticket for "Big."
The plot of the movie "Big" is
less than original. When first set
tling into my seat at the theater,
I thought, "here goes another
cliched movie about a boy trapped
in a man's body."
But, somehow, Tom Hanks

pulled it off. "Big" is a thoroughly
entertaining movie. I probably
wouldn't see it again, but it is
the kind of movie that is worth
seeing once.
Hanks, playing the 12-year-old
Josh Baskin in a 35-year old body,
manages to capture the man
nerisms and character of a boy

with incredible skill.
The real gem of "Big", besides
Hanks, is Robert Loggia. Loggia
plays MacMillan, the owner of
MacMillan's Toys and Josh's first
boss.
All told, "Big" is definitely
worth a look.

"Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101

Sometimes the greatest
pleasures come from adding just
a little extra to an old classic, like
Double Stuff Oreo cookies. "Who
Framed Roger Rabbit," a
Touchstone Pictures release
produced by Steven Spielberg,
blends a collection of the finest in
classic cartoons with modern tech
nology to create a real summer
treat.
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
stars Bob Hoskins as Eddie
Valiant, a washed-up, stereo
typical, alcoholic, 1940's private
eye who will take any case he can
get to pay back his barmaid
girlfriend.
What sounds like a bad Mike
Hammer episode becomes an
amazing cinematic feat when you
discover that Roger, Jessica and
a host of other personalities are
all animated cartoon characters
that live and breathe (literally)
alongside humans in the real
world. The cartoons are flawlessly
inserted into the film, making the
premise quite believable as well
as infinitely entertaining.

technical achievements for the
first five minutes or so, movie
goers will also quickly discover
that "Roger Rabbit" sports an en
tertaining plot as well as slick in
teraction between the human
characters and the animated
Roger, Jessica and such classic

stars as Mickey Mouse, Bugs
Bunny and Betty Boop.
The movie is crammed full of
allusions to classic cartoons, and
viewers who grew up with Bugs
and the gang will find these little
tags extremely enjoyable. Even if
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
doesn't evoke a twinge of nostal
gia, moviegoers will find passing
up summer reruns in favor of this
flick an incredibly wise choice.
