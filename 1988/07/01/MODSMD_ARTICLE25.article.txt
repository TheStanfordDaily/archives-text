## Greg Butler is big, battling and Broadway bound 
### 
As expected, Tuesday's NBA draft pro
vided the unexpected.
Some of the surprises however
were pleasant ones. Stanford's Greg Butler,
a 6-foot-ll center-forward was chosen 37th
overall by the New York Knickerbockers.
Obviously, getting drafted in the second
round is an achievement to be proud of,
but for Butler the news is even better. On
Monday, the Knicks traded their backup
center, Bill Cartwright, to the Chicago Bulls
for Charles Oakley. _

That trade means the Knicks are cur
rently without a player who can play second
string to Patrick Ewing. .. .
Enter Greg Butler. In his senior year
here, Butler developed a strong low-post
game that caught the attention of NBA
superscout Marty Blake. Blake spoke highly
of Butler, thereby bringing him national
attention.
Sometime between then and now Knicks
General Manager A 1 Bianchi and Coach
Rick Pitino caught an earful of Blake's
accolades. They liked what they heard

enough to pass on more well-known players
like Dean Garrett and Keith Smart of the
1987 National Champion Indiana Hoosiers
and select Butler instead.
Considering that Garrett is only an inch
shorter than Butler — and therefore could
have filled the backup center role — the
Knicks' choice of Butler over Garrett shows
just how far Butler has come.
It's even more amazing when you con
sider that not all that long ago then-junior
Greg Butler spent much of his time riding
the pine as he was unable to adjust to
first-year Coach Mike Montgomery's new
system.
But an injury to Eric Reveno in the
offseason between his junior and senior
years opened up an opportunity for Butler.
He worked hard to transform himself from
a jump-shooting forward whose favorite
shot was the 16-footer to a back-to-the
basket-take-it-to-the-hole center.
That transformation helped Stanford
overcome the loss of Reveno and earn its
first postseason berth since 1942. It also
has brought Greg Butler to the brink of
an NBA career — a notion that might have
been considered ludicrous only a year ago.
As a Stanford fan, and as a New Yorker
who has watched the Knicks all my life, I
hope Butler makes the team. He's certainly
earned a shot.
It seems a bit odd that the two best
rebounders in the game, Michael Cage
of the Los Angeles Clippers and Oakley
were so easily traded by their former teams.

But on closer examination the reasons
are clear. The Bulls acquired a proven cen
ter in Cartwright to fill the gaping whole
that has existed in the pivot of the Windy
City for years. On top of that, moving up
allowed them to draft Will Perdue who will
see time at big forward and could develop
into a fine NBA center by the time
Cartwright packs it in four or five years
from now.
The Clippers' reasons were even more
apparent. GM Elgin Baylor was masterful
in acquiring Danny Manning, Charles
Smith and Gary Grant in what may very
well be the single best draft of all time.
With rookies Manning, Smith, Grant and
second-year players Ken Norman and
Reggie Williams, the Clippers won't con
tend immediately. But, if they can ever get
center Benoit Benjamin motivated, they can
contend in the not-too-distant future.
Maybe it's just my imagination, but
it seems that despite the lack of
star-quality players this year's
draft was the deepest in years. Rarely are
so many of the second-round choices
familiar names like Charles Shackleford,
Vernon Maxwell, Steve Kerr, Tom Tolbert,
Fennis Dembo, Garrett and Smart.
Almost all these guys have a shot at
making the league, a rarity to begin with.
Rarer still is that Dembo, Maxwell and
some of the others could be stars if given
three or four years to develop.
