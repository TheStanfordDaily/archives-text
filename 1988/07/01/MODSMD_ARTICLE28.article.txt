# Father of artificial intelligence
## Scientist wins $350,000 award 
### Will Kasumi 
A Stanford computer science
professor, considered the father
of artificial intelligence, won the
$350,000 Kyoto .Prize — a
Japanese award honoring ad
vanced research in the fields of
basic science, frontier science
and philosophy.
John McCarthy was named a
prizewinner last Friday for his
pioneering work in computer
science. McCarthy first coined
the term "artificial intelligence"
in 1955 and is also the inventor
of computer time-sharing and
the LISP programming lan
guage.
The Kyoto Prize, established
by the Inamori Foundation of
Japan's Kyocera Corporation in
1984, is given to three scientists
each year. In addition to Mc-
Carthy, linguist Noam Chomsky
of MIT and West German phi
losopher Paul Thieme will

receive their awards in Kyoto
Nov. 10.
Recipients of the Kyoto Prize
receive $10,000 more than
Nobel Prize winners, but be
cause the Kyoto Prize has only
been in existence for four years,
it is not widely known. McCar
thy said because the Kyoto Prize

"covers differ
ent fields from
the Nobel Prize,
it should be
come interna
tionally recog
nized. ..
A graduate of
Cal Tech who
received his
doctorate in

mathematics at Princeton, Mc-
Carthy added that he hopes the
prize will give artificial intelli
gence greater prestige and en
courage more people to join the
field.
In honoring McCarthy, the In

amori Foundation called LISP
"the greatest invention in the
century in the field of computer
science." LISP is a program
ming language that uses sym
bolic rather than numerical ex
pressions.
Described by associates as
having a "twinkling sense of
humor," McCarthy said his own
work was mostly theoretical,
dealing in common-sense com
puter capabilities. Nonetheless,
he thinks humans will one day
have robot servants and com
puters supplementing human
intelligence.
Nils Nilsson, chair of the
Computer Science Department,
said McCarthy's work indicates
that scientists have "farther to
go than they have come" in de
veloping a computer that can
reason like the human brain.
But he added that "the possi
bilities of artificial intelligence
are limitless."
