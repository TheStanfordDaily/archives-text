In the wake of the rocky debate over the
University's forced retirement of Hoover In
stitution Director W. Glenn Campbell, Hoover
has released a book about retirement in modern
society.
Edited by Hoover Senior Fellows Rita
Ricardo-Campbell — who is married to W.
Glenn Campbell — and Edward Lazear, "Is
sues in Contemporary Retirement" explores
different retirement trends for women and men,
looks at the state of the social security system
in the United States and challenges the idea
that 65 marks old age.
The book is a report on the proceedings of
a conference sponsored by the National Insti
tute of Aging in February, 1987, according to
Ricardo-Campbell. She added that the book
and the conference, which was held at Hoover,
have "nothing to do with Dr. Campbell's re
tirement."
Ix>ng before any controversy emerged sur
rounding Campbell's own retirement, organi
zers agreed that the transcript would be pub
lished in the form of a book, she said.
Prominent economists, sociologists, his
torians and demographers from around the
country participated in the conference and con
tributed to the book.
According to Ricardo-Campbell the book is
significant because it provides pioneering in
formation about women and retirement, and
contributes to the ongoing debate about the
increasing age of contemporary society.
Ricardo-Campbell said this debate centers
largely around the question of whether people
who live longer stay healthy enough to ade
quately function in their jobs.
"Basically 65 as an age of retirement was
pulled out of the air" for the 1935
Social Security Act, she said, add
ing that life expectancy has
greatly increased since then.
Currently, federal law makes
mandatory retirement illegal ex
cept for particular professions, in
cluding firemen, policemen, aca
demics and executives who receive
pensions in excess of $44,000 per
year, Lazear said.
He added that mandatory re
tirement may be on its way to
extinction. By 1994, for example,
a provision of the 1974 Age Dis
crimination and Employment Act
will eliminate the mandatory re
tirement age of 70 for academics,
according to Lazear.
No parallel change in manda
tory retirement laws for execu
tives like Campbell is currently
on the horizon.
Referring to her husband's
scheduled retirement, Ricardo-
Campbell said, "I don't think it
has anything to do with his age."
