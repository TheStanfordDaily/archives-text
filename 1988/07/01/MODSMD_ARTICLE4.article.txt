# Engineering School controversy continues
## Minorities await dean's response 
### Ted Nierras 
The ball is in Dean Gibbons' court.
Following the resignation of black As
st. Dean Linda Wells from the SchorJ
of Engineering because of "lack of racial
progress," minority students in the
school say it is up to Dean James Gib
bons to appoint a committee to evaluate
minority concerns in the school.
Graduate student David Porter, a
member of the Society of Black Scien
tists and Engineers, said Wells' resig
nation is "not the kind of thing people
let go."
Porter was among the students from
the SBSE and the Chicano Society of
Engineers and Scientists who met with
Gibbons June 10, after Wells' resigna

tion. The students gave Gibbons a list
of concerns, including a demand to
strengthen the school's Minority Engi
neering Program.
Rather than address this list of con
cerns immediately, Gibbons agreed to

set up a committee to
evaluate minority life in
the school — a commit
tee which he had previ
ously proposed.
Porter said with a
working committee in
the fall, the relationship
between minorities and
the school's administra
tion would "be fine."

However, "if there is no response (from
the dean), many minority students will

be upset," Porter said.
According to senior Randy Lee
Johnson, a member of SBSE, minority
students expect "a recognition of mi
nority needs. That translates into a sup
portive environment — good relation
ships with the faculty, an academic sup
port system, financial assistance, more
respect for the minority office in the
school."
Co-terminal student Hector Porras of
the CSES said that he "felt good about
the meeting (with Gibbons)" and was
"optimistic . . . and looking forward to
progress (in the fall)."
He said minority students were "not
trying to be antagonistic, but (rather
were) trying to work with the admin
istration."
