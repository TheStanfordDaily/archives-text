# Experts debate second shock

Nostradamus, go home.
Despite an earthquake advisory issued
by the State Office of Emergency Services
and threatening headlines predicting more
earthquakes, Stanford professors are
skeptical that anyone can accurately predict
the next big one.
Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey
say there is one chance in 20 that an
earthquake measuring 5.0 or greater on
the Kichter scale will occur this week.
This "fact" may spark fears of crumbling
buildings and crashing light fixtures but
it is "purely a statistical statement" and
not a prediction, according to Haresh Shah,
chair of the Civil Engineering Department.
After a temblor, like the one before lunch
Monday that registered 5.0 on the Richter
scale, scientists say an aftershock is likely
to occur. Fifty percent of the time, that

second earthquake will be of equal or
greater magnitude, Shah said.
But wait. Don't run to New York yet.
According to Shah, there have been 27
earthquakes of magnitude five or above in
this area over the last 82 years. That's an
average of one earthquake every three
years, or one earthquake every 1,000 days.
Therefore, the chance that an earthquake
will occur on any given day is one in one
thousand. The likelihood of an aftershock
increases this probability to one-chance-in
twenty. "It's strictly numbers," Shah said.
"Our knowledge is not sufficient to
predict an earthquake," Shah said.
Anne Kiremidjian, co-director of the
John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center here, also said she was "very skepti
cal" when people make predictions about
earthquakes without probability models.
Predictions are meaningless over a short
time'period," she said.
