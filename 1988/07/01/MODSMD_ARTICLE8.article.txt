# Tree lover fights for symbol
## Palo Alto citizen urges city to save toppling redwood 
### Sally Hamaker 
Because of a recent rainstorm, Stanford's
most majestic symbol might topple over.
"El Palo Alto," a 1057-year-old redwood
tree that is shown on Stanford's seal and
is the model for the Stanford Band's mas
cot, is losing its grip on the ground that
surrounds it, according to James Johnson,
a local horticulture enthusiast.

The potential demise of the
aging tree has become a con
cern for Palo Alto citizens.

Johnson, who has lived within walking
distance of the tree for the past 15 years,
said the "natural symbol of wilderness and
of history" is not receiving adequate care
from the city of Palo Alto.
As a result, the potential demise of the
aging tree has become a concern for Palo
Alto citizens, city officials and the Stanford
community.
He said his concern for El Palo Alto
escalated in January, when a rainstorm
weakened the tree's hold to the ground.
According to Johnson, the tree is actually
tipping and is in danger of falling down
when another "wet, windy storm" strikes.
To keep the tree upright, Johnson has
urged the city to take decisive measures
to secure the tree to its mooring. "I
definitely think that cables are needed,"
he said.
However, Palo Alto Urban Forester Gary
Nauman, who has cared for the tree for
30 years, said cables are not necessary to
hold it up. According to Nauman, Palo Alto
will spend as much money as is necessary
to keep El Palo Alto alive.
The tree "has been a landmark for Stan
ford and Palo Alto for many, many years.
It has nothing to do with finances . . . the
cables aren't needed," he said.
According to Nauman, Palo Alto has re
cently spent about $3,000 to keep El Palo

Alto alive. Most of the restoration costs
went to an automatic sprinkler on the tree's
top. Simulating a fog, the sprinkler lightly
mists the tree for about one hour, four
times a week.
"We've explored everything that
[Johnson] was concerned with and we've
done everything that needs to be done at
this time," Nauman said.
Standing conspicuously alone across
from the Stanford Shopping Center, the
tree is next to the San Francisquito creek
and the Southern Pacific Railroad
tracks.The tree inspired the name for the
city of Palo Alto.
Spanish explorer Caspar de Portola's ex
ploration group named the tree and city
in the late 18th century when they camped
underneath it, about 100 years before the
founding of Stanford. In English, Palo Alto
means tall tree.
El Palo Alto used to have a double trunk,
but a storm in 1886 ripped out one of
them. The damage occurred about a year
after the death of Leland Stanford Junior,
Johnson said, noting that "trees often are
associated with important historical
events."
"Now it is just a shadow of what it was
before the storm," he said.
Weather is not the only cause of El Palo
Alto's deterioration. Soot from older coal
powered trains used to damage the tree.
In addition, the tree is located too close to
the train tracks and the creek, hindering
root expansion.
Andrew Doty, director of Stanford's com
munity relations, said it is Palo Alto's —
not Stanford's — responsibity to maintain
the tree. "It's not so much Stanford's tree
as it is the tree that is shown on the
University's seal," Doty said.
But 1987 graduate Brendan Kelly was
more empathetic to the tree's predicament.
Kelly, last year's tree mascot for the Band,
urged the University to help save the tree.
"It's Stanford's responsibility," Kelly
said. "They've got it on their seal ... they
should at least have it in their backyard."

El Palo Alto, the erstwhile provider of shade to
wayward Spanish explorers, may soon suffer the
fate of many other arboreal artifacts. The peril of
the 1,057-year-old redwood has moved local hor
ticulture enthusiast James Johnson to try and save
this Stanford landmark.
