### Eric Richardson Editorial staff 
A Friday night brush fire of
"suspicious origin" behind Casa
Zapata has renewed fears of van
dalism against Zapata Resident
Fellows Tony and Cecilia Bur
ciaga.
The Palo Alto Fire Department
reported a bush fire adjacent to
the Stern Hall parking lot behind
Zapata at 8:13 p.m. Friday, which
endangered two cars and ignited
a patch of ivy 25 feet long and
five feet high.
The blaze was of "suspicious
origin," fire department inves
tigators said, adding that wit
nesses reported a man running
away from the scene shortly af
terward.
Both police and fire department
investigators said they are uncer
tain if Friday's fire is related to
previous incidents of vandalism
against Zapata — Stanford's
Chicano-Latino theme house —
and the RFs there.
Since late May, the Burciagas
have been victims of repeated van
dalism. Vandals have dumped raw
eggs onto their car, attacked the
car and a first-floor room in

Zapata with a fire extinguisher
and made threatening phone calls
to Cecilia Burciaga.
"I don't think it (the Friday
night fire) was related to the in
cidents against the Burciagas be
cause we've had another similar
fire," Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington said. According to
the Fire Department, a fire was
set on Wednesday in the ivy out
side of Escondido Village's McFar
land high-rise.
Although the fire at Stern
might not be related to the past
problems at Zapata, Tony Bur
ciaga said he was uneasy because
the fire brought back memories
of the earlier vandalism.
"According to police and
firemen, it was set by someone.
It was a fire in ivy, and ivy just
does not burn by itself," he said.
After their car was vandalized
with eggs June 19, Tony Burciaga
said he and his wife considered
leaving their positions as RFs. He
said he feared the attacks might
have been racially motivated.
Last week, the Burciagas said
they had decided to remain at
Stanford and will return to Zapata
next year.
Yesterday, police also reported
that two primary suspects in the
earlier vandalism incidents could
not have set Friday's fire.
The suspects, a Stanford un
dergraduate and a 1988 graduate,
left the campus prior to the June

19 egg-breaking incident, Herring
ton said.
"We're right back to square
one," Herrington said. "We can't
come up with any particular in
teraction that they (the Bur
ciagas) have had with somebody
that would lead to something like
these incidents."
Herrington said police will con
tinue to take "extra precautions"
in the neighborhood around
Zapata.
