SACRAMENTO, Calif. - At
torney General Edwin Meese 111,
declaring that an independent
counsel's 14-month investigation
has "completely vindicated" him,
announced yesterday that he
would resign by early August "to
accept new opportunities in the
private sector."
Meese, the most controversial
attorney general since John
Mitchell headed the Department
of Justice under President Nixon,
said that the report by counsel
James McKay lifted "the burden
of false allegations," which made
the last year "enormously difficult
for my family and for me."
Although Meese said that nei
ther he nor his attorneys had seen
a copy of the 830-page report,
which was filed with a special
three-judge federal court only
hours before his press conference,
he stressed that McKay had "con
clusively determined that there is
no basis for criminal proceedings"
against him.
"I have refused to bend to the

constant drumbeat of political and
media pressure because I have a
responsibility to uphold an impor
tant principle, not only for myself
and this administration, but for
future government officials who
are subjected to untrue allega
tions," Meese said.
Meese had been under scrutiny
by McKay — the second indepen
dent counsel to investigate him
— for several matters, from his
involvement in the Wedtech Corp.
scandal to his role in a controver
sial $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline
project.
The unexpected announcement
by Meese — who participated in
a raid on a marijuana patch 70
miles northeast of here earlier in
the day — was welcomed by mem
bers of both parties. Democrats
hailed the resignation of a key
Reagan aide that they denounced
as an unethical public officia' who
refused to apply the laws • venly
and Republicans expressed relief
over the departure of a high
profile Cabinet officer who con

tributed significantly to the so
called "sleaze" issue used repeat
edly against the GOP in the pres
idential campaign.
In recent months, Meese's
refusal to resign had become a
extremely difficult issue not only
for the Republican Party but for
President Reagan himself, who
had refused to turn his back on
a friend of more than two decades
despite constant calls for Meese's
resignation.
Reagan, with whom Meese con
ferred by telephone shortly before
surprising reporters here with his
announcement, said that Meese
had been "a darned good attorney
general" and that he had no one
in mind to succeed him.
"The president wanted to be
sure 1 felt that this was something
in my best interests, and on the
basis that I felt that it was, then
he said he would agree," said
Meese, whose resignation comes
only weeks before the Democratic
National Convention.
Vice President George Bush,

whose campaign aides had com
plained about Meese's remaining
in office despite repeated ques
tions about his conduct, said in
a written statement: "Ed did the
right thing, and I wish him well."
In addition to limiting the ef
fectiveness of Democratic attacks,
Meese's resignation is bound to
blunt the impact of the indepen
dent counsel's report itself, which
government sources said raises
serious questions about his ethical
conduct.
During his press conference,
Meese's remarks were typical of
his style, in which he often uses
so-called "lawyer's arguments"
that take a narrow interpretation
of an issue.
Meese challenged, for example,
McKay's authority to make any
ethical judgments about his con
duct.
"The important thing to re
member is that the single duty of
the independent counsel was to
determine whether any of these
allegations that have been made

— false allegations that I referred
to — formed the basis for criminal
proceedings," he said. "... Any
thing that may be in the report
is merely commentary."
