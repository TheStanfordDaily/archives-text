# Jet's radio signals mixed, U.S. says

WASHINGTON - The Penta
gon, providing new details that
appeared to compound the mys
tery of the downing of an Iran
Air jetliner by an American war
ship in the Persian Gulf Sunday,
said yesterday that the plane was
emitting contradictory radio sig
nals, some identifying it as a ci
vilian aircraft and some identify
ing it as military.
This disclosure raised a host of
new questions because Navy offi
cials had said that the radio sig
nals picked up by the U.S. cruiser
Vincennes were among the critical
factors that led the ship's captain
to believe that the Iran Air Airbus
A-300 was a hostile Iranian F-14
fighter and to order it shot down.
Pentagon spokesman Dan
Howard, seeking to explain and
justify the downing of Iran Air
Flight 655, said that the Vin
cennes had received radio emis
sions from two transponders
aboard the Iranian plane, one
emitting military codes and one
emitting civilian codes.
Further compounding the un
certainties, however, Howard
conceded that a nearby U.S.
guided missile frigate, the John
H. Sides, picked up the civilian

transponder signals from the
aircraft but did not "hear" the
military signals.
A transponder is a transmitter
that responds to electronic ques
tioning by air traffic controllers
or other radar operators by emit
ting a code that identifies the
aircraft.
In early briefings on the inci
dent, military officials had refused
to discuss details of the electronic
signals picked up by the sophis
ticated Aegis-class cruiser, saying
that such information was classi
fied.
The Vincennes was in the Strait
of Hormuz at the time, about 50
miles south of Bandar Abbas,
Howard said. Radar operators
aboard the Navy ship sent
electronic queries to the uniden
tified aircraft, which responded
with signals from both a civilian
Mode 3 transponder and the ex
clusively military Mode 2
transponder.
U.S. military officials said Tues
day that they had never encoun
tered an aircraft that was
"squawking" — transmitting —
on both Mode 3 and Mode 2.
