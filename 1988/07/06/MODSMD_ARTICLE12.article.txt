Deal arranged in Pentagon case
LOS ANGELES — Government prosecutors,
convinced that Los Angeles aerospace-salesman
turned-lobbyist Fred Lackner was a "small fry"
in the massive Pentagon fraud scandal, offered
him a deal if he would help them build cases
against others, his lawyer told the Los Angeles
Times.
But the offer was rejected, Lackner's attorney,
William Dougherty, said in an interview, because
"my client never paid a cent to anyone." Doug
herty met last week with assistants to U.S. At
torney Henry Hudson, who is directing the crim
inal investigation from his office in Alexandria,
Va.
Dougherty's comments are the first indications
of the government's willingness to strike a deal
with defense industry lobbyists and others who
have figured in what is believed to be the largest
ever investigation into Pentagon procurement
bribery and fraud.
The implication of the suggested deal is that
the government is looking for cooperation from
some of the lower-profile consultants to help
build cases against more prominent individuals.
The deal called for Lackner to plead guilty to
two counts of bribery and stealing government
property and to cooperate in the continuing probe.
In exchange, government prosecutors offered to
"remain silent" at Lackner's sentencing, Doug
herty said. Government prosecutors were unavail
able for comment.
Lackner, along with about 275 others, has been
subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury

in Alexandria July 19.
Dougherty said that prosecutors are especially
interested in the friendships and business rela
tionships Lackner built with other defense con
sultants and, most particularly, Pentagon
procurement official Stuart Berlin.
Berlin, whose friendship with Lackner dates
back to the early 19705, was removed as a con
tracting official at Naval Air Systems Command
last month after his Pentagon office was searched
in connection with the probe. Berlin, a civilian
Pentagon employee, had worked his way up in
the Navy bureaucracy in Washington to a position
where he was drafting contacts for electronics
systems.
Reagan lashes out at Dukakis
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, pressing
his campaign effort for Vice President George
Bush, criticized Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis yesterday as an "out-and-out
liberal" governor who has raised taxes and favors
abortion.
"All that the American people need to do is a
little comparison shopping to see the truth" about
Dukakis' place in the political spectrum, Reagan
told an audience of conservative political leaders
summoned to the White House.
"The American people understand what
liberalism means and don't like it," Reagan said.
