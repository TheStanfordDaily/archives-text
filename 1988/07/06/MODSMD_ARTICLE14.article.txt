## Give to blood bank 
### 
Volunteers needed
during summertime

STANFORD Universi
ty's Medical Center ap
pears to have weath
ered the storm over the
weekend.
But, last week's precipi
tous drop in the blood
supply there should alert
community members that
they are needed to give
blood not only during such
extreme "droughts" — but
consistently throughout
both the school year and the
summer.
Last week, the blood bank
issued an emergency appeal
for donors. Turning out in
force, members of the Stan
ford community staved off
a crisis situation by resup
plying the blood bank which
had dropped below 150
pints.
While the Stanford com
munity gives close to 25,000
pints a year — a healthy
contribution — the supply
of donors drops off some
what during the summer.

Despite this lack, the
recent turnout at the blood
bank was an encouraging
demonstration of commu
nity awareness of the im
portance of maintaining an
adequate blood supply.
Yet this support should
not have to be solicited. And
the Medical Center's blood
supply should never have to
drop to such low levels.
Especially during summer
months, when blood dona
tions are seasonally under
par, the Stanford commu
nity must accept the on
going responsibility for
meeting the needs of the
Medical Center.
As always, the Stanford
community of students, fac
ulty and staff is a targetable
group that should be easily
able to meet the needs of
the Medical Center.
Along with permanent
residents here, summer
school students and visitors
from all over the country
should take a unique oppor
tunity to visit one of the
foremost medical facilities
in the world — and leave
something of themselves be
hind for posterity.
