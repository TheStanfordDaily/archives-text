## Stanford is inconsistent 
### 
MUCH HAS been written
and said about Stanford's
status as a top university
in the country, and I am certainly
proud of being a part of the Stan
ford community. But how the
University has reacted to two in
cidents this past spring has left
me both confused and disturbed.
The two incidents I am refer
ring to are the ones involving stu
dents Kenny Ehrman and Jose
Fernandez, the former an alleged
troublemaker, the latter an al
leged thief.
As far as I now know, the worst
action Ehrman is guilty of is ver
bally abusing the Otero Resident
Fellow while in a drunken state.
Ehrman has since apologized for
his behavior.
Ehrman has also been labeled
"homophobic" by various sources.
Apparently, he did not get along
with his four Resident Assistants,
one of whom is homosexual.
I am certainly not one to sym
pathize with bigots of any kind
because I am a black woman and
proud of my heritage. But I be
lieve that the University has
treated Ehrman unfairly by evict
ing him from University housing.
By contrast, the University has
been too lenient towards Jose Fer
nandez.

Fernandez was arrested in April
for allegedly stealing over $60,000
worth of computers from the
Stanford Bookstore. Yet the Uni
versity refused to expel him, even
though he was caught in the act
and had detailed records of the
stolen computers.
Ehrman's actions were cer
tainly less serious on a legal level,
yet he received a harsher punish
ment from the University. This
obvious hypocrisy has angered
me, and I am sure I am not the
only student who feels this way.
In the University's eyes, Fer
nandez may be innocent until
proven guilty but it is apparent
to me that Ehrman did not receive
the same fair-minded treatment.
Kenny Ehrman should be given
back University housing. It has
not been sufficiently proven that
he constitutes a physical threat
to the Stanford community, he
has apologized for his actions and
labeling him a bigot seems ques
tionable. Furthermore, for consis
tency's sake, Ehrman should be
allowed to live on campus because
a student who committed a worse
"crime" went virtually untouched
by the University.
Regardless of bow much (or how
little) time Jose Fernandez will
actually spend in jail, if he is found

guilty, lie should issue a formal,
public apology to the Stanford
community, restore all monetary
damages to the Stanford Book
store, and spend a reasonable
amount of time in community
service.
I still maintain that I am proud
to be a Stanford student. But the
Ehrman and Fernandez incidents
show that Stanford must have a
consistent way of dealing with up
setting student behavior. If not,
the Honor Code will surely be
considered a joke and/or the Uni
versity can dole out oppresive
punishment when it pleases.
After all, a school can have high
academic standards and a post
graduate success rate, but it does
not mean a thing if the school
cannot uphold its policies in a fair
and consistent manner.
