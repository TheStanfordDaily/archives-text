## Students must examine meaning of BSU chair's letter 
### 
IFEEL THAT I should take
a brief moment to respond
to the recent series of letters
in The Daily and place some of
the more controversial sections
of my original letter back into
the context in which they were
written.
At Stanford, as in much of
modern day America, contro
versy and disagreement are dis
couraged. When this isn't en
tirely successful, the goal is to
keep the differences at an un
obtrusive (i.e. comfortable) level.
Debate and discourse are reg
ulated as if there is a thermo
stat at each forum: whenever a
student becomes irate, impas
sioned or even agitated, the
immediate impulse is to turn
down the thermostat with such
phrases as "she's unreasonable,"
"he's emotional" or "they're
radical."
Most students at Stanford
have had some training in rhet
oric and hyperbole; unfortunate
ly, in many discussions the
rhetoric overwhelms the issues.
The discussion following my
letter seems to have
deteriorated into semantic in
stead of substantive arguments.
I would like to restate several
of the more "inflammatory"

sections of my letter and ask a
few questions about the impres
sions evoked.
"If a nerd like myself can
bring fear into the hearts of
provosts, just imagine what a
bunch of real, intimidating,
committed students of color
could do."
I wonder why this statement
was seen as inflammatory since
it was written as a plea to get
students involved in the "mas
sive student movement building
across the nation." Why weren't
there any questions about how
students can change universities
or why students of color are
typically seen to be more in
volved in activism than main
stream students?
"My response is, 'Kiss my
Black behind.' In the BSU, to
be attacked is to be effective,
since most of the attackers are
the very people we are trying to
change."
Obviously, this statement is
more than controversial, it is
obnoxious, but then so am I
when people become vicious in
their attacks upon a communi
ty. The appropriate response is
"Kiss my African-American der
riere." I wonder why no one
asked what would lead a nor-

mally discrete spokesperson to
respond so flippantly. I think
when dissenting students are
called "militant, radical rabble
rousers" by people who have
not met or been involved in
discussions with them, the only
appropriate response is a face
tious one.
"I am about to say something
which will be misquoted and
misunderstood ... ready ... I
do not like most white
people.. . . Most white students
at Stanford don't care or act
upon anything except their own
experience, and I don't like
people who don't care."
This statement is obviously
easily misunderstood, therefore
I took great pains to make
readers aware that the state
ment should be read within the
context of the whole letter. I
would ask those thoughtful
readers who have read this
statement out of context to
reread my letter. I am attempt
ing to describe in glaring black
and white two mtyor problems
in race relations — prejudice
and apathy.
I have observed prejudice and
apathy in very severe forms this
year, especially among main
stream students. The student

body has reacted to intense
arguments within the University
by labeling them "black,"
"feminist" or "radical" agitation
yet these discussions have con
tinually involved a huge diver
sity of people and viewpoints.
By saying "I don't like most
white people who don't care," I
am trying to tell the apathetic
mainstream community (which
is primarily white) to start
caring about the problems that
affect people unlike themselves.
If anyone's viewpoint is offen
sive, ask two questions. The
first is, "why does he or she
hold that offensive viewpoint
and can I help change that
point of view?" The more im
portant question is, "How can I
change the conditions which
promote that unproductive view
point?"
It is not prejudice that is
devastating our society and
world, it is more the lack of
concern for other people that
underlies the prejudice. You
have seen my biases. The ques
tion is how we can each over
come our own biases and help
solve the problems of our com
munities and world.
