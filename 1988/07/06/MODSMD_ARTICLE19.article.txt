University intends
to back Burciagas
I just read the editorial ur
ging support for the Burciagas
and appreciate the sentiment
and the effort. I do, however,
have a correction, or perhaps
clarification, to make.
In the editorial, you state
that I said that "there is little
the University can do to help
the Burciagas." I don't believe I
said that, nor do I believe it.
What I think I said, and cer
tainly meant to say, is that
there is little that the Univer
sity can do to stop the van
dalism and harassment unless
we can identify and catch the
peipetrator(s). Short of that, I
believe I said, there is little we
can do except be as supportive
of the Burciagas as possible.
In fact, I remember telling
you I thought the idea of an
editorial on the subject was just
the sort of thing that would be
useful because it would show
the Burciagas that they are not
the only ones concerned with
this type of reprehensible be
havior, even if they are the
current targets.
I hope this clarifies the com
ments attributed to me in last
Tuesday's editorial.

Taking a stand is
often unsuccessful
As Henry Riggß, vice president
for development, takes leave of
Stanford, I would like to wish
him well.
I was quite interested in his
advice to graduates on Class
Day. He said, in part:
"To borrow a phrase, there is
in this world far too much
'going along to get along.' We
get drawn into compromising
situations, to shading the truth,
to modest and then not-so
modest misrepresentations. Is
this because we don't know
right from wrong? In some
cases, it is. But more frequently
we are simply unwilling to face
the consequences of not 'going
along.' We are not willing to
put our jobs on the line for
what we believe in — par
ticulary when putting our jobs
on the line means putting our
careers on the 1ine...."
And later:
"Be alert for those situations
where you must take a stand —
whatever the risks — to be
faithful to your own integrity.
These situations occur on virtu
ally every job. And remember
that for most of us, taking a
stand is a lot tougher early in
our careers than later. . . ."
This is very thoughtful advice,
except I differ with the vice
president on the last sentence.
It is much tougher to take a

stand late in one's career, be
cause there is not as much time
or as many opportunities to
recover if "the stand" is unsuc
cessful. What the vice president
does not add is that most
"stands" are unsuccessful.
Unfortunately, most employ
ers favor those who "go along,"
but rarely do new ideas and
challenges come from such indi
viduals. And, those who do not
go along rarely receive recogni
tion and reward, much less
opportunities to advance in the
organization. This has been true
in the Office of Development. I
recall the vice president's per
plexed look early in his adminis
tration when I volunteered to be
the affirmative action officer for
the Office of Development. Obvi
ously, my services were rejected,
in spite of longstanding interest
in the program.
Nevertheless, I am very
pleased — and surprised — that
the vice president has these
views. I never knew he held
such values — or respected
those who practiced them. I
hope he will make these beliefs
known early to his staff at Har
vey Mudd. I believe the institu
tion will benefit enormously
from this philosophy.
And there are still no women
or black employees visible on
the construction site next to the
Encina tennis courts.

What's in a name?
While I applaud Paul Brendan
Kelly Ill's sentiments about the
return of his tree costume, I
should set the scientific record
straight: the tree on which the
University mascot is based is
not "Sequoia Gigantis, the giant
redwood so plainly seen on the
university's 5ea1...." In fact,
there is no Sequoia Gigantis. I
think he means Sequoia gigan
tea.
Whether or not that was
what he meant is moot, how
ever. The tree on the University
seal to which he refers is the
coast redwood, Sequoia semper
virens. This particular image is
of El Palo Alto, the historic
redwood on San Francisquito
Creek near El Camino Real.

Resident shouldn't

As in most wars, certainly
civil ones, there have been
atrocities on both sides in the
Nicaraguan conflict. This was
confirmed to me personally by a
high official of Amnesty Inter
national. A reliable reporter has
just given details of Sandini.«;ta
atrocities to Jack Andorson at
the Chronicle.
So why does Rachelle Mar-

shall defend the Marxist and
the anti-American side? Clearly
not on the basis of civil rights.
It can only be on ideological
grounds, a lefitwing bias which
transpires in everything she
writes.
One would think that some
one of Jewish background like
herself would have learned from
the Holocaust and World War II
that you cannot always afford a
puristic attitude toward allies
and still survive. Without Stalin,
that monster of cruelty, we
might not have subdued Hitler.
I am sure Marshall approves
of our current smiling on Gor
bachev. And yet he has gone
along with a policy of sowing
million of plastic toys from
helicopters over Afghanistan,
containing explosives which sys
tematically maim thousands of
children in order to slow the
repatriation of rebels from
Pakistan.
One needs a strong stomach
and some wisdom in these terri
ble matters. One must maintain
faith in the long-range wonder
ful cause of democracy and
freedom despite the many fail
ures of our governmental repre
sentatives and allied leaders.
George Schultz seems to me, in
light of these considerations, to
be one of the last to merit Mar
shall's condemnations.
I am entirely baffled by her.

the Burciagas." I don't believe I
said that, nor do I believe it.
What I think I said, and cer
tainly meant to say, is that
there is little that the Univer
sity can do to stop the van
dalism and harassment unless
we can identify and catch the
peipetrator(s). Short of that, I
believe I said, there is little we
can do except be as supportive
of the Burciagas as possible.
In fact, I remember telling
you I thought the idea of an
editorial on the subject was just
the sort of thing that would be
useful because it would show
the Burciagas that they are not
the only ones concerned with
this type of reprehensible be
havior, even if they are the
current targets.
I hope this clarifies the com
ments attributed to me in last
Tuesday's editorial.

Taking a stand is
often unsuccessful
As Henry Riggß, vice president
for development, takes leave of
Stanford, I would like to wish
him well.
I was quite interested in his
advice to graduates on Class
Day. He said, in part:
"To borrow a phrase, there is
in this world far too much
'going along to get along.' We
get drawn into compromising
situations, to shading the truth,
to modest and then not-so
modest misrepresentations. Is
this because we don't know
right from wrong? In some
cases, it is. But more frequently
we are simply unwilling to face
the consequences of not 'going
along.' We are not willing to
put our jobs on the line for
what we believe in — par
ticulary when putting our jobs
on the line means putting our
careers on the 1ine...."
And later:
"Be alert for those situations
where you must take a stand —
whatever the risks — to be
faithful to your own integrity.
These situations occur on virtu
ally every job. And remember
that for most of us, taking a
stand is a lot tougher early in
our careers than later. . . ."
This is very thoughtful advice,
except I differ with the vice
president on the last sentence.
It is much tougher to take a

stand late in one's career, be
cause there is not as much time
or as many opportunities to
recover if "the stand" is unsuc
cessful. What the vice president
does not add is that most
"stands" are unsuccessful.
Unfortunately, most employ
ers favor those who "go along,"
but rarely do new ideas and
challenges come from such indi
viduals. And, those who do not
go along rarely receive recogni
tion and reward, much less
opportunities to advance in the
organization. This has been true
in the Office of Development. I
recall the vice president's per
plexed look early in his adminis
tration when I volunteered to be
the affirmative action officer for
the Office of Development. Obvi
ously, my services were rejected,
in spite of longstanding interest
in the program.
Nevertheless, I am very
pleased — and surprised — that
the vice president has these
views. I never knew he held
such values — or respected
those who practiced them. I
hope he will make these beliefs
known early to his staff at Har
vey Mudd. I believe the institu
tion will benefit enormously
from this philosophy.
And there are still no women
or black employees visible on
the construction site next to the
Encina tennis courts.

What's in a name?
While I applaud Paul Brendan
Kelly Ill's sentiments about the
return of his tree costume, I
should set the scientific record
straight: the tree on which the
University mascot is based is
not "Sequoia Gigantis, the giant
redwood so plainly seen on the
university's 5ea1...." In fact,
there is no Sequoia Gigantis. I
think he means Sequoia gigan
tea.
Whether or not that was
what he meant is moot, how
ever. The tree on the University
seal to which he refers is the
coast redwood, Sequoia semper
virens. This particular image is
of El Palo Alto, the historic
redwood on San Francisquito
Creek near El Camino Real.

Resident shouldn't
criticize so quickly
As in most wars, certainly
civil ones, there have been
atrocities on both sides in the
Nicaraguan conflict. This was
confirmed to me personally by a
high official of Amnesty Inter
national. A reliable reporter has
just given details of Sandini.«;ta
atrocities to Jack Andorson at
the Chronicle.
So why does Rachelle Mar-

shall defend the Marxist and
the anti-American side? Clearly
not on the basis of civil rights.
It can only be on ideological
grounds, a lefitwing bias which
transpires in everything she
writes.
One would think that some
one of Jewish background like
herself would have learned from
the Holocaust and World War II
that you cannot always afford a
puristic attitude toward allies
and still survive. Without Stalin,
that monster of cruelty, we
might not have subdued Hitler.
I am sure Marshall approves
of our current smiling on Gor
bachev. And yet he has gone
along with a policy of sowing
million of plastic toys from
helicopters over Afghanistan,
containing explosives which sys
tematically maim thousands of
children in order to slow the
repatriation of rebels from
Pakistan.
One needs a strong stomach
and some wisdom in these terri
ble matters. One must maintain
faith in the long-range wonder
ful cause of democracy and
freedom despite the many fail
ures of our governmental repre
sentatives and allied leaders.
George Schultz seems to me, in
light of these considerations, to
be one of the last to merit Mar
shall's condemnations.
I am entirely baffled by her.

University intends
to back Burciagas
I just read the editorial ur
ging support for the Burciagas
and appreciate the sentiment
and the effort. I do, however,
have a correction, or perhaps
clarification, to make.
In the editorial, you state
that I said that "there is little
the University can do to help
the Burciagas." I don't believe I
said that, nor do I believe it.
What I think I said, and cer
tainly meant to say, is that
there is little that the Univer
sity can do to stop the van
dalism and harassment unless
we can identify and catch the
peipetrator(s). Short of that, I
