## Frost festival will feature computer music Center generates sounds for the next millenium

"Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine
trees and marmalade skies ..."
While the musical and lyrical imagination of "Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds" surprised and delighted audiences
in the 19605, composers at the Center for Computer
Research in Music and Acoustics find the same release
for the imagination in computer music.
"I felt the need for expansion of the possible colors in
music, and the computer is a tool I can use to explore
new sounds and actually compose space," said Composer
Stanislaw Krupowicz.
At CCRMA (pronounced "karma"), the distinction be
tween the roles of inventor, artist and composer often
blurs. Like the Beatles, researchers at CCRMA want to
reach the ears of listeners unsatisfied by traditional music.
Using computers rather than hallucinogens to express the
unexpressed, the composers draw from a wide range of
academic fields.
"CCRMA encourages students from multiple disciplines
such as electrical engineering, computer science and psy
chology to explore their interests in the application of
computers in art music," CCRMA Director John Chowning
said.
On the night of July 14, everyone will get the chance
to taste music recently composed at CCRMA. Three com
posers and their vast technological entourage will descend
on Frost Amphitheater for a Bastille Day concert
guaranteed to startle.
The show will be the first entirely live concert of com
puter music at Stanford. In previous years, performers
used some recorded material to supplement live — or

"real time" — material.
"The advantages of real time computer music are tan
gible. Tape is rigid and inflexible. . .. We're approaching
the time when the computer will be accepted as a real
time instrument," said Krupowicz, who is one of the
featured composers.
Krupowicz, who studied mathematics and composition
in Poland, said he found computer music a natural way
of combining the two disciplines. Krupowicz's "Concerto"
for tenor saxophone and computers merges the talents of
human and machine. The piece incorporates all 32 timbres
of the synthesizer's instrumental spectrum.
When asked what sparked his interest in computer
music, Composer Richard Karpen said he felt that some
thing was missing from traditional music.
"I heard sounds in my head that I didn't hear in
orchestras and decided to pursue it," explained the creator
of "Time Frames."
"I let my imagination run beyond what is audible," he
said. Karpen's pursuit of these sounds led him to Brooklyn
University, where he studied programming and eventually
computer composition. Karpen said he sees computer
music as a natural development in the musical tradition.
"The advent of computer music is equal to any event
in the history of music. It is a turning point that is still
in its forming stage and hasn't yet received full acceptance.
But why shouldn't it? People already have computers in
their homes, just like pianos."
David Zicarelli is the third musician featured at the
festival. Over a period of two years he developed Oval Tune,
a software program that allows the user to create and
perform music at the same time.
"It's not just me as a 'composer' playing to an audience.

Oval Tune is something that even little kids can use. My
audience is the people who use my program," he explained.
Zicarelli's composition, "The Sound of America Scream
ing," is performed with a mouse on a Macintosh computer.
The title comes from the last sentence in"The Ultimate
Evil," a highly sensationalized expose of satanic conspiracy
cults.
Hear the scream. Frost. July 14.
