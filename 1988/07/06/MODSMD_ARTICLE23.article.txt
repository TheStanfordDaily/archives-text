# A 						distant past echoes through yawning corridors of Knoll

The Knoll, home to the Center
for Computer Research in Music
has stood proudly
on its lakeside hill for 80 years.
With all the proud aloofness of
a grande dame the old mansion
outshines the slipshod moder
nism of its younger neighbors.
Perched above a strange neigh -
bor in Florence Moore Hall, the
Knoll has a commanding pres
ence matched only by the impos
ing serenity ol Memorial Church.
With its eight chimneys and pink
stucco exterior, the Spanish
Revival style manse intrigues
and mystifies passers-by.
Since its construction in 1918,
the building has lived many lives.

In its youth it served as the home
of each University president.
But the beauty of the newly
completed Lou Henry Hoover
House made then University
President Donald Tresidder
abandon the Knoll, whose unset
tling combination of magnitude
and ornamentation made it seem
a gaudy fortress.
In 1946, the Music Depart
ment moved in. Making the
grand staircases and cold marble
floors into a suitable working en
vironment was a difficult task,
and after 40 years, the Knoll
found itself abandoned again.
Enter CCRMA.
Originally housed in a labora
tory on Arastradero Road,
CCRMA (pronounced "karma")

moved to a refurbished Knoll in
March 1986.
While a $1.2 million facelift
improved the acoustics of the
building, nothing has muted its
basic spookiness.
And the juxtaposition between
a new research center and a for
midable old building makes for
a fascinating atmosphere.
The incongruity between the
innovations of CCRMA and the
curlicued elegance of the Knoll
puzzles many a wayward stroller.
Entering the Knoll on a summer
afternoon conjures up ghosts
from past presidential recep
tions, but the strains of synthetic
music emerging from the ball
room catapault one into the next
millenium.
