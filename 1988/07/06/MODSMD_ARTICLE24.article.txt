Editor's note: Although the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra re
turned from the Far East on Sun
day, cellist and sophomore Suha
Jhaveri filed this report after the
orchestra's stop in Kyoto.
KYOTO, Japan — On the first
stop of their tour, the 97 members
of the orchestra got a crash course
in Japan Today. Living with
families gave them a glimpse of
Japanese domestic life and play
ing with a Japanese orchestra
helped them discern the unique
aspects of their own style.
The tour began on June 16 after
27 hours of travel, when Stanford
students arrived at Kyoto's Utano
Youth Hostel, where most stayed
for the five days. A third of the
musicians stayed in Japanese
homes for up to three days.
The concert, held in the recently
completed Nagaokakayo Memorial
Cultural Hall, was the work of
both Stanford students and Kyoto
musicians. In Wagner's "Der
Meistersinger," Stanford students
were joined by Kyoto University
Orchestra members. The Kyoto
University Chorus also accompa
nied the SSO for the performance
of Beethoven's "Ninth Sym
phony."

Although some SSO performers
harbored mixed feelings about
their concert, it was extremely
well received by the audience, and
ended with two encore pieces. The
first was a Japanese lovesong,
written for the occasion by Asst.
Conductor Charles Barber. The
audience responded to the second
piece, "Stars and Stripes," by clap
ping enthusiastically to the beat,
much to the surprise of SSO mem
bers.
"It was the most inspiring eve
ning I've ever been a part of in
my life," said Prof. Andor Toth,
conductor of the SSO. "The
feeling of welcome they gave the
orchestra was superb. The occa
sion was thrilling."
This concert, the first of five
on the SSO's Far East tour,
marked the end of a busy stay in
Japan.
"It was interesting to see how
a Japanese family interacts," said
flautist Laurent Meister. "They
made a big effort to make me feel
at home."
Violinist Chliu-Mie Dick felt the
same way. "The families were so
generous. I think they try to em
ulate Westerners."
Although orchestra members
squeezed in as much sightseeing
as possible during their free time,
both U.S. and Japanese musicians

had some opportunities to become
better acquainted.
After rehearsal with the Kyoto
University Orchestra, students
ate lunch together on the tatami
mats of a nearby shrine.
"It was exciting to sit next to
them, communicating despite the
language barrier," said cellist
Becky Baron. Many said playing
with Japanese musicians was the
high point of their stay. After
lunch, Kyoto students gave SSO
members informal tours of the
area.

SSO players also attended the
Kyoto University Orchestra's con
cert, which gave them a chance
to compare musical performance
techniques.
"It was a very disciplined per
formance — technically perfect —
but not enough personality. They
took no chances with the music,"
said cellist Cindy Tignor.
Deborah Jue concurred, adding
that the Japanese orchestra was
"very technical, but didn't emote
as much."

Other highlights of the Japan
stay included a delegation of tour
members meeting the vice mayor
of Kyoto and visiting a workshop
for elementary music students.
The workshop evoked warm
feelings from those who attended.
The children ranged from ages
five to 16 and played a variety of
instruments.
"They were all so young, yet so
talented," said violinist Sarah
Brody. "It struck me how
seriously they take their music."
