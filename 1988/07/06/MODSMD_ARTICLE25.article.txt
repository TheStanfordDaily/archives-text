"Take for example this..."
If you are looking for the perfect music for a
peaceful summer picnic, something mild enough to
foster a mellow mood but not somniferous enough
to dampen your enthusiasm and quell your joie de
vivre, look no further than Billy Childs.
"Take for example this. . showcases some of
the sweetest saxaphone solos around, with the ex
cellent rhythm and percussion performances pro
viding an amazing backdrop to the featured
keyboards. Though none of the songs are mag
nificent, all are extremely enjoyable.
The record starts off with a bang called "Quiet
Girl," a healthy dose of fluid jazz that continues
right into "One Fleeting Moment." "Timeless," a
pretty, melodic song punctuated by crisp percussion,
keeps the initial flame alive and provides an inter
esting contrast to the frenetic fusion in "Room 101,"
the first side finale.
Equally exciting, the second stanza spotlights the
musicians in Childs' combo individually, giving each
a chance to strut his stuff clear through the upbeat

Take for example this:
if to the color of midnight
to a more than darkness(which
is myself and Paris and all
things)the bright
rain
occurs deeply, beautifully. .
— e.e. cummings

fadeout of "An Afterthought." The title track is
especially notable: based on a poem by e.e. cum
mings, the cool piano lines interspersed with up
tempo phrases show the full range of emotion that
the solo artist/arranger/producer can release
through his gifted fingers.
Kudos are also due to bassist Jimmy Johnson,
whose improvisations make "Afterthought" simply
electric, and to fiutist/saxaphonist Bob Sheppard.
Sheppard's smooth sax on the opening track steals
the listener's attention away from the solo artist —
a rare pleasure indeed.
