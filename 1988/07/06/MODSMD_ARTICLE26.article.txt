Andy Summers
"Mysterious Barricades"
Andy Summers has finally put out a
surprising album, but unfortunately not a
pleasant one. After releasing mounds of
masterpieces as one-third of The Police and
composing a dozen sterling soundtracks,
Summers has finally ventured into a genre
he has not mastered; if "Mysterious Bar
ricades" is a harbinger of his future New
Age attempts, he should quit while he still
has fans.
"Barricades" is quite honestly a fiat-out
flop, bogged down with slow and repetitive
instrumental that are utterly devoid of
life and abysmally empty of spirit. Much
like the Titanic, the record sinks soon after
it embarks on its maiden voyage.
Repetition seems to be Summers' favor
ite new writing technique. Every song lit
tering the collection is free form (meaning
that the artist elects to throw out any
semblance of order or structure for the
sake of absolute anarchy), yet each is sadly
based on very simple chord progressions
repeated ad nauseum.
The odious odyssey begins with "Red
Balloon." Rather than providing a pleasant
dose of light program music conveying an

audio impression of a small balloon floating
ever higher as it travels, the tune bombards
the listener with monotony that continues
straight through into the succeding title
track.
You know you are in trouble when you
lift the needle of your record player mid
song, place it down on a random spot on
the rotating disk and hear exactly the same
thing oozing out of your speakers. Not just
an audiophile's nightmare any more, this
in fact occurred last week while I listened
to the album for the first (and last) time,
spending the duration resisting the over
whelming urge to rip the LP off the turn
table and heave it into the nearest
dumpster.
Had Private Music Records (the same
label that just weeks ago released Suzanne
Ciani's outstanding album "Neverland")
not provided the disk as a complimentary
copy, I would have probably sued for dam
ages.
"When That Day Comes" is surprisingly
bearable in the wake of boredom, but
"Train Song" quickly puts the record back
on the wrong track. The listener is finally
put out of his misery twenty minutes later
with a wimper titled "How Can I Forget,"
an adequately a propos epithet for the
usually-excellent Summers. If ever an al
bum begged for audience amnesia, this is
the one.
