## Lichti gets official invite to train for Olympics 
### 
Stanford senior Todd Lichti is
among the 21 players who were
invited yesterday to begin training
later this month for berths on the
U.S. men's Olympic basketball
team.
The players are to report to
Georgetown University on July 17
and the final roster of 12 players
must be sent to the Seoul Olympic
Organizing Committee by Sept. 2.
The Games begin Sept. 17.
Not among those invited was
former Kentucky standout Rex
Chapman, who was made the
eighth pick overall in last week's
NBA draft by the Charlotte Hor
nets. Chapman was one of Lichti's
top competitors for an off guard
spot on the team.

Chapman announced his inten
tion to withdraw from the trials
last week so that he could con
centrate on his pro career. He
later said the announcement was
a "miscommunication" and was
seeking to reverse the decision.
Apparently Olympic Coach John

Thompson was not interested
enough in Chapman to invite him
to Georgetown, however.
Lichti's toughest competition is
expected to come from Hersey
Hawkins of Bradley, Mitch Rich
mond of Kansas State, Jeff Grayer
of lowa State and Brian Shaw of
UC-Santa Barbara all of whom
play his position, though Rich
mond may be moved to small for
ward.
Lichti was on the list of players
invited to the Georgetown camp
after the Olympic Trials in May.
Several others were added to that
list after playing with a USA
Select Team in Europe in June.
A nine-game exhibition
schedule including games against
teams comprised of NBA players
has been set. It begins in Provi
dence, R.I. on Aug. 7 and con
cludes in Los Angeles on Aug. 30.
Women's hoops
returns from China
The Stanford women's basket
ball team added new meaning to
the term "overseas studies" last
week, when the squad jetted off
to a sixth place finish in an in
ternational tournament in Wu
Han, China by posting a 1-6
record (including two warm-up
games) against competitors like
the Chinese national team,
ranked third in the world.
Playing in front of crowds rang
ing from 4,000 to 8,000 specta
tors, the Cardinal learned quickly
that international basketball is
quite different from NCAA con
tests. Apart from the basic logisti
cal differences — a wider lane,
heavier ball and a more difficult
three-pointer — the tempo of play
is much faster than on the col
legiate level.
Junior guard Jennifer Azzi had
quite a different overseas experi
ence with the U.S. Select Team
in Taiwan. Essentially the "B"
squad of the U.S. National Team,
the Select Squad fared well
against tough opponents like
South Korea to muster a spectac

ular second place finish in the
tournament.
Azzi, the leading scorer on last
season's 28-5 Stanford team,
proved a wise selection for the
United States, earning All-
Tournament status while leading
her team to the silver.
Stanford loses prize
baseball recruit
With two straight College World
Series Championships under its
belt and left-handed pitcher Steve
Avery of Taylor, Mich, signed to
a letter of intent to attend Stan
ford there was boundless anticipa
tion about what the Cardinal
could accomplish in the next few
seasons.
Though the Cardinal should
still be capable of accomplishing
a great deal in the upcoming
season, the enthusiasm has
quieted a bit since Avery signed
a contract with the Atlanta Braves
last week. The Braves made Avery
the third selection overall — and
the first high school player chosen
— in the June baseball draft.
Avery, a 6-foot-4 185-pounder,
was highly touted because of an
unbelievable high school career.
As a senior he averaged 21 strike
outs a game.
U.S. water polo team
knocks off Yugoslavia
Bringing back memories of the
Cardinal's back-to-back NCAA
Water Polo titles in 1980 and
1981, Stanford graduates James
Bergeson, Jody Campbell and
Alan Mouchawar led the U.S. Na
tional Team to a 6-5 victory over
Yugoslavia Saturday in front of a
packed house of 2,315 people at
deGuerre Pool.
The match marked the second
contest of a six-city West Coast
tour by the gold- and silver
medalists from the 1984 Olym
pics. Although the Yugoslavs took
the honors in Los Angeles and

are the world's top-ranked squad,
the United States is now 2-0
against them, having won 11-10
Friday night in Stockton.
Mouchawar, Class of '82 had
two goals, Bergeson, '83 had one
goal and two assists, and Camp
bell, '83 assisted once to offset a
three-goal performance by Yugos
lavia's 6-foot-8 holeman Tomislav
Paskvalin.
Goals by Olympians Terry
Schroeder and Peter Campbell
sandwiched a Paskvalin tally to
give the hosts a 2-1 lead after the
first quarter. Paskvalin tied it
again in the second quarter but
Bergeson and Mouchawar staked
the United States to a 4-2 lead
going into the fourth quarter.
In addition to Mouchawar, Ber
geson and Jody Campbell, 1987
graduates David Imbernino and
Craig Klass are also on the fourth
ranked U.S. team.

Patty Fendick falls
in mixed doubles semis
For the second straight year,
Patty Fendick, a two-time NCAA
singles champion while at Stan
ford, reached the semifinals of the
mixed doubles competition at
Wimbledon.

Fendick, playing with former
USC standout Rick Leach,
reached the semis by overcoming
Marcel Freeman and Lori McNeil
in the quarterfinals 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.
Fendick and Leach were tough in
the semis but eventually suc
cumbed to Kelly Jones and
Gretchen Magers by a score of 7-6
(7-1), 5-7, 6-4.
Another former Stanford star
made news Monday even though
he went down to defeat. Patrick
McEnroe, a June graduate, was
trounced 6-2, 6-1 by Jimmy Arias
in the first round of the U.S. Pro
Championships.
Ordinarily, such an event
wouldn't raise an eyebrow but
being John McEnroe's younger
brother has brought Patrick some
attention.
Trying to avoid comparisons be
tween the two, the younger
McEnroe said "No one should ex
pect me to play like my brother.
I'm like any other guy coming out
of college trying to make a name
for himself."
"There are things to learn and
I'll learn," he added.
Stanford may play
host to '94 World Cup
Now that the United Stated has
officially been selected as the host
nation for the 1994 World Cup,
speculation is further heating up
that Stanford stadium could be
selected as a site for the 24-nation
soccer tournament.
"We didn't say yes to having
World Cup games played at Stan
ford, but we also didn't say no,"
Senior Assoc. Director of Athletics
Alan Cummings said. "I'm confi
dent, based upon our experience
with the '84 Olympics, that we
could do a very good job of
presenting soccer matches."
Stanford drew over 450,000
spectators to nine Olympic soccer
matches in 1984 as well as playing
host to Super Bowl XIX in 1985.

The Games begin Sept. 17.
Not among those invited was
former Kentucky standout Rex
Chapman, who was made the
eighth pick overall in last week's
NBA draft by the Charlotte Hor
nets. Chapman was one of Lichti's
top competitors for an off guard
spot on the team.

Chapman announced his inten
tion to withdraw from the trials
last week so that he could con
centrate on his pro career. He
later said the announcement was
a "miscommunication" and was
seeking to reverse the decision.
Apparently Olympic Coach John

Thompson was not interested
enough in Chapman to invite him
to Georgetown, however.
Lichti's toughest competition is
expected to come from Hersey
Hawkins of Bradley, Mitch Rich
mond of Kansas State, Jeff Grayer
of lowa State and Brian Shaw of
UC-Santa Barbara all of whom
play his position, though Rich
mond may be moved to small for
ward.
Lichti was on the list of players
invited to the Georgetown camp
after the Olympic Trials in May.
Several others were added to that
list after playing with a USA
Select Team in Europe in June.
A nine-game exhibition
schedule including games against
teams comprised of NBA players
has been set. It begins in Provi
dence, R.I. on Aug. 7 and con
cludes in Los Angeles on Aug. 30.
Women's hoops
returns from China
The Stanford women's basket
ball team added new meaning to
the term "overseas studies" last
week, when the squad jetted off
to a sixth place finish in an in
ternational tournament in Wu
Han, China by posting a 1-6
record (including two warm-up
games) against competitors like
the Chinese national team,
ranked third in the world.
Playing in front of crowds rang
ing from 4,000 to 8,000 specta
tors, the Cardinal learned quickly
that international basketball is
quite different from NCAA con
tests. Apart from the basic logisti
cal differences — a wider lane,
heavier ball and a more difficult
three-pointer — the tempo of play
is much faster than on the col
legiate level.
Junior guard Jennifer Azzi had
quite a different overseas experi
ence with the U.S. Select Team
in Taiwan. Essentially the "B"
squad of the U.S. National Team,
the Select Squad fared well
against tough opponents like
South Korea to muster a spectac

ular second place finish in the
tournament.
Azzi, the leading scorer on last
season's 28-5 Stanford team,
proved a wise selection for the
United States, earning All-
Tournament status while leading
her team to the silver.
Stanford loses prize
baseball recruit
With two straight College World
Series Championships under its
belt and left-handed pitcher Steve
Avery of Taylor, Mich, signed to
a letter of intent to attend Stan
ford there was boundless anticipa
tion about what the Cardinal
could accomplish in the next few
seasons.
Though the Cardinal should
still be capable of accomplishing
a great deal in the upcoming
season, the enthusiasm has
quieted a bit since Avery signed
a contract with the Atlanta Braves
last week. The Braves made Avery
the third selection overall — and
the first high school player chosen
— in the June baseball draft.
Avery, a 6-foot-4 185-pounder,
was highly touted because of an
unbelievable high school career.
As a senior he averaged 21 strike
outs a game.
U.S. water polo team
knocks off Yugoslavia
Bringing back memories of the
Cardinal's back-to-back NCAA
Water Polo titles in 1980 and
1981, Stanford graduates James
Bergeson, Jody Campbell and
Alan Mouchawar led the U.S. Na
tional Team to a 6-5 victory over
Yugoslavia Saturday in front of a
packed house of 2,315 people at
deGuerre Pool.
The match marked the second
contest of a six-city West Coast
tour by the gold- and silver
medalists from the 1984 Olym
pics. Although the Yugoslavs took
the honors in Los Angeles and

are the world's top-ranked squad,
the United States is now 2-0
against them, having won 11-10
Friday night in Stockton.
Mouchawar, Class of '82 had
two goals, Bergeson, '83 had one
goal and two assists, and Camp
bell, '83 assisted once to offset a
three-goal performance by Yugos
lavia's 6-foot-8 holeman Tomislav
Paskvalin.
Goals by Olympians Terry
Schroeder and Peter Campbell
sandwiched a Paskvalin tally to
give the hosts a 2-1 lead after the
first quarter. Paskvalin tied it
again in the second quarter but
Bergeson and Mouchawar staked
the United States to a 4-2 lead
going into the fourth quarter.
In addition to Mouchawar, Ber
geson and Jody Campbell, 1987
graduates David Imbernino and
Craig Klass are also on the fourth
ranked U.S. team.

Patty Fendick falls
in mixed doubles semis
For the second straight year,
Patty Fendick, a two-time NCAA
singles champion while at Stan
ford, reached the semifinals of the
mixed doubles competition at
Wimbledon.

Fendick, playing with former
USC standout Rick Leach,
reached the semis by overcoming
Marcel Freeman and Lori McNeil
in the quarterfinals 6-4, 5-7, 6-4.
Fendick and Leach were tough in
the semis but eventually suc
cumbed to Kelly Jones and
Gretchen Magers by a score of 7-6
(7-1), 5-7, 6-4.
Another former Stanford star
made news Monday even though
he went down to defeat. Patrick
McEnroe, a June graduate, was
trounced 6-2, 6-1 by Jimmy Arias
in the first round of the U.S. Pro
Championships.
Ordinarily, such an event
wouldn't raise an eyebrow but
being John McEnroe's younger
brother has brought Patrick some
attention.
Trying to avoid comparisons be
tween the two, the younger
McEnroe said "No one should ex
pect me to play like my brother.
I'm like any other guy coming out
of college trying to make a name
for himself."
"There are things to learn and
I'll learn," he added.
Stanford may play
host to '94 World Cup
Now that the United Stated has
officially been selected as the host
nation for the 1994 World Cup,
speculation is further heating up
that Stanford stadium could be
selected as a site for the 24-nation
soccer tournament.
"We didn't say yes to having
World Cup games played at Stan
ford, but we also didn't say no,"
Senior Assoc. Director of Athletics
Alan Cummings said. "I'm confi
dent, based upon our experience
with the '84 Olympics, that we
could do a very good job of
presenting soccer matches."
Stanford drew over 450,000
spectators to nine Olympic soccer
matches in 1984 as well as playing
host to Super Bowl XIX in 1985.
