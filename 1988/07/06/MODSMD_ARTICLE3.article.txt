# Drought forces Stanford to switch to well water
## 
### Will Kasumi Helen Willey 
Drought conditions have forced Stanford to sup
plement its regular water supply with well water,
resulting in a milky-colored tap water which has
upset residents at several on-campus houses.
Because the City of San Francisco has cut back
on 40 percent of its water supply to Stanford and
surrounding communities, the University is now
using three wells to counteract the rationing.
Stanford water officials said there have been no
changes in the quality of the water — only a change
in the color.
According to Manager of Operations and Main
tenance Cheryl Jensen, the mineral content of the
water is higher but still meets Environmental
Protection Agency and state standards. The "milkier
color" of the water is due to the mixing of oxygen
by the well's pumping action; there is "nothing
bad" in it, Jensen said.
Stanford Safety Specialist George Seto confirmed
that the cloudines does not effect the water's quality.
When the water is retrived from the wells pres
surization occurs, Seto explained.
While the pressurization process causes a higher
content of oxygen and whiter water, the difference

is not dangerous, he said.
But residents complained that the Stanford water
tastes worse because of the shift to well water.
"The water now is just terrible," Donner Resident
Fellow Linda Paulson said. "I gave my cat the water
and she wouldn't drink it."
Describing the water as "really bubbly with a
nasty after taste," Sam Lu, a summer student living
in Stern Hall, said he was dissatisfied with the
quality.

The water now is just terrible. I
gave my cat the water and she
wouldn't drink it.'

Another Wilbur resident, Jon Kilcrease, said the
water "looks milky until all the air bubbles settle
out."
And according to Leslie Ballew, an office specialist
at the Palo Alto Water District, water from wells
does have a strange taste.
"Well water does not taste good
because it has more minerals in
it," she said.
Stanford has not only resorted
to using wells but has also
planned to cut back on water use
by about 38 percent over the sum
mmer.
Water restricters will be placed
on showerheads and water faucets
in dorm bathrooms and all water
fountains on campus will be shut
off, Jensen said.
Already, the Atheletic Depart
ment has significantly curtailed
water use — cutting back by 40
percent. The Residential Subdivi
sions, which provides housing for
Stanford faculty, has cut back on
water by more than 20 percent.
Jensen said that the University
will ration water until there is "a
lot" of rain. Stanford will continue
using well water for an indefinite
amount of time — at least until
April.
"This plan (the use of wells)
will be in effect until next April,
when San Francisco will reassess
the situation and make a deter
mination on what to do," Jensen
explained.
The especially long dry season
in the Bay Area and a lack of
snow in the Sierra Mountains
have caused San Francisco to ra
tion off water, according to Jen
sen.
