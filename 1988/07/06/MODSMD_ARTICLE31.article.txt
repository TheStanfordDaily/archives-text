# Frosh onslaught causes crunch
## University officials coping with housing and advising shortage 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Faced with an unexpected rise
in the number of freshmen who
have accepted this fall, Stanford
is scrambling to cope with prob
lems ranging from a housing
crunch to a shortage of fresh
man advisers.
The larger class will "have an
impact in all areas" of student
life, according to Assistant Dean
of Student Affairs Rodger Whit
ney.
Because the incoming fresh
man class has at least 100 more
students than expected, Stan
ford could not admit any appli
cants from the waiting list,
Whitney said, adding that the
University has cut back enroll
ment for transfer students, ad
mitting 25 fewer transfers than
usual.
Whitney, who is also director
of Student Housing, said a
larger class will add to Stan
ford's on-campus housing prob
lems. He said finding residences
for all of next year's freshmen
was difficult but not impossible.

"I wouldn't describe it as a
crisis," he said.
According to Whitney, the
opening of a new housing com
plex for graduate students
relieved some of the strain on
undergraduate housing. The
new complex, located off Bow
doin Street, opened up 100
housing spaces in Crothers,
Crothers Memorial and Escon
dido Village. The spaces are now
available to undergraduates.
But Whitney said a larger
freshman class will have both a
short- and long-term effect on
housing. With fewer spaces
available to upperclass students
who have been displaced by the
larger class, more people will be
competing for spaces in next
year's Draw, he predicted.
While Whitney was busy find
ing enough housing for the new
class, the Undergraduate Advis
ing Center has been scouting out
more faculty advisers for the
students.
Faced with the prospect of
falling short by about 50 ad
visers, the UAC sent out a
distress call to University fac

ulty and staff. They responded
in droves, easily filling all the
vacancies, according to Director
of Undergraduate Advising
Audrey Bernfield.
"We're ready for the
onslaught," Bernfield said. "We
even had to start an [adviser]
wait list."
Freshman English is also
gearing up for more students,
arranging for more class sec
tions than are usually neces
sary. The Department has "a
large pool of instructors" to
meet the demands of the incom
ing class, English Prof. Charles
Fifer said.
Because dorm occupancy re
mains constant from year to
year, University Food Service
will not be affected by a larger
freshman class. However, Food
Service will have more mouths
to feed at this year's Freshman
Orientation.
"We serve all the meals for
Freshman Orientation and have
worked very closely with the as
sistant dean of Student Affairs,"
said Food Service Asst. Manager
Lois Ohms.
