# Lake Lagunita water to fill irrigation gap
## 
### Stacey Estrella 
No longer filled with wind
surfers, sailboats or much
water, Lake Lagunita is under
going its annual drainage.
But as a result of this year's
drought, the lake's water will
not flow into the San Francisco
Bay as it has in the past. In
stead, the water is being
pumped back into Stanford's
groundwater system to replen
ish subsurface aquifers, accord
ing to Operations and Mainte
nance Manager Cheryl Jensen.
Shortly after Commence
ment, a drain in the lake is

opened. During a year of
average rainfall, water drains

through the
valve and into
an under
ground pipe
system. Pass
ing through
Stanford's
storm drain
age system,
the water
moves along
Palo Alto's un-

dergound system. Finally, the
water flows into the San Fran-

Cisco Bay.
But this year the water is
needed to help with the campus'
irrigation system Jensen said,
adding that irrigation was the
original reason for building the
lake.
Prior to the founding of the
University, Leland Stanford
decided to build a lake as an ir
rigation ditch for his stock farm.
By maintaining a surface supply
of water, Stanford hoped the
lake's water would "drip into the
groundwater system and replen
ish aquifers," Jensen said.

"He really didn't put it in there
for windsurfing," Jensen said of
Stanford's intentions for Laguni
ta.
According to Jensen, during es
pecially dry winters, the lake does
not always fill. She pointed to a
spring quarter in the late 1970s
when there was no water in the
lake.
Usually, natural rainfall and
the waters from the San Fran
cisquito Creek and Felt Lake fill
Lagunita. However, sometimes
Felt Lake, a water source located
off Alpine and Arastradero Roads,
does not fill. Consequently, the
lake cannot benefit from its runoff
and remains dry.
