# Donors replenish blood supply
## 
### Sally Hamaker 
This weekend over 200 donors responded to an
emergency appeal for blood, preventing a potentially
disastrous situation for the Stanford Medical Center.
On Thursday, the blood bank had a dangerously
low supply of blood — only 150 pints, and Medical
Center officials expressed concern that the supply
might run out over the three-day holiday weekend.
But by appealing through the media, the Medical
Center recruited 165 volunteers who donated 147
pints of blood on Friday.
"We had probably our biggest day ever last Fri
day," said Roger Svoboda, administrator for Stan
ford's Blood Bank. Donations were taken three hours
longer than on a typical day. Although the blood
bank is usually not open over the weekend, 66
volunteers gave 60 pints of blood on Saturday.
"We had to balance the response from the media
appeal with our resources here," Svoboda said.
The blood shortage was caused by an especially
high demand for large quantities of blood this week
end and by a typically low number of summer
donors.
According to Svoboda, the blood bank laces a

drop in donors over the summer
and holiday seasons. Often, the
bank will obtain extra blood from
other banks, a resource that was
not available last week.
"It is not routine that we do
appeals like this one," he said,
adding that the blood bank
usually appeals to the community
once or twice a year.
Svoboda said the hospital's two

year-old trauma center also in
creases the need for blood dona
tions. One of a few trauma
centers in the Bay Area, the Stan
ford trauma center uses a large
reserve from the blood bank for
emergency cases.
Stanford blood bank donations
comprise over 80 percent of the
blood used by the Medical Center,
while the rest is obtained from
other community blood banks.
