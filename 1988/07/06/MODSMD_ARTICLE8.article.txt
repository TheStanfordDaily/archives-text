# Skateboarding up!
## City law may increase on-campus truckin' 
### Lisa Mackey 
Already overcrowded with
hurried bicyclists, a plague of
skateboarders may descend upon
the Stanford campus if Palo
Alto's city council passes an or
dinance banning the use of
skateboards in residential areas
and on city streets.
City council members are con
sidering a new ordinance that
might encourage skateboarders
to migrate to the Stanford
campus from Palo Alto. The or
dinance would place a ban on
skateboarding anywhere in Palo
Alto, adding to the current law
against skateboarding down
town.
Stanford students and Palo
Alto City Council members alike
say they worry about the possi
bility of skateboarders causing
accidents and disturbance.
Senior Robin Davis called
skateboarders "rude" and "in
sensitive" and said the male
junior high and high school stu
dents who are mostly skateboar
ders would "be disruptive to the
normal atmosphere on campus."
But skateboarders like Brian
Kennedy, a high school sopho
more who is at Stanford for a
summer tennis camp, defended
skateboarders' rights within

Palo Alto. Kennedy said he
thinks "the whole ordinance is
pretty stupid."
Other students say they feel
an increase in the number of
skateboarders at Stanford would
not be a problem. Steve Phillips,
a graduating Ph.D student, said
"I think enough people
skateboard on campus now that
the increase (of skateboarders
from Palo Alto) won't be notice
able."
Police Chief Marv Herrington
agreed there have already been
a lot of skateboarders coming to
the campus from Palo Alto. "We
have responded (to the
skateboarders) by telling them
to leave," Herrington said.
One possible solution to the
skateboarding infusion would be
to provide a special "court" for
the skateboarding "rats," as
some people call them.
Skateboarding doctoral stu
dent Mike Fallavollita said
"maybe the city should consider
creating a skateboarding park so
that there would be a place other
than the city streets."
Councilman Frank Patatuchi
agreed. "There are tennis courts
for tennis players, basketball
courts for basketball players; no
one has built anything for
skaters," he said.

More daredevil skateboarders might zoom onto campus if Palo
Alto passes an ordinance banning the 2-foot-long vehicles from
residential areas.
