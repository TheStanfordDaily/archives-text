# Medical School safety program cleans up lab chemicals

### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
In the midst of increased con
cern this year over the Universi
ty's health and safety procedures,
a chemical clean-up of over 1,000
laboratories at the Stanford Med
ical School will begin July 11.
The large-scale chemical dis
posal effort at the Medical School
is part of a Summer Safety Project
to meet University guidelines and
address requirements of the 1986
Safe Drinking and Toxic Enforce
ment Act, according to David
Korn, vice president and dean of
the Medical School.
The Act, better known as
Proposition 65, requires labs to
post a list of known carcinogens
and reproductive toxins used in
each lab, Korn said.
A heightened awareness of pos
sible inadequacies in University
health and safety procedures was
prompted in December when op
erations manager in the Health
and Safety Department, Jon Mol
destad, wrote a letter to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy

charging the University with
"waste, mismanagement, legal vi
olations, unethical behavior,
cover-up and intimidation."
In response, a Menlo Park risk
management consulting firm, SRI
International, was contracted to
investigate these charges and
develop recommendations for cor
rective action.
Medical School director of
health and safety, John Fyfe, said
although Molestad's letter "raised
awareness of health and safety
issues," the Summer Safety Proj
ect at the Medical Center is "to
tally independent" of the
allegations and the SRI investiga
tion.
Chemical Safety Manager Peter
Burns agreed that the Summer
Safety Project was "not related"
to the investigation of recent
health and safety concerns.
"They've been under pressure for
some time from the fire and police
departments to improve safety
conditions," he said.
In February, the SRI report
stated that "no clear and present

dangers were found in the Medical
Center."
However, the report questioned
the adequacy of safety conditions
in several University buildings.
The report especially criticized the
lack of central administration of
health and safety policies.
The Medical Center's Summer
Safety Program will strengthen
University-wide cooperation on
health and safety issues, Fyfe
said, because it establishes the
dean's office as a "liaison" be
tween the University, the aca
demic departments, the Health
and Safety Office and the Medical
Center.
According to Program Director
for the Summer Safety Project,
Mitchell Caldwell, one technician
from each lab will be trained to
do the clean-up in their lab
through a 90-minute course.
Outfitted in safety goggles,
coats and gloves, these "lab
contacts" will dispose of unwanted
chemicals, take an inventory of
those remaining, and separate in
compatable chemicals. The tech
nicians will also learn to repair

equipment in their labs and to
identify potentially hazardous sit
uations.
A floor plan will then be placed
in yellow Life Safety Boxes out
side each lab for use in emergen
cies, Caldwell said. The floor plan
will include an inventory and clas
sification of chemicals and equip
ment according to the relative
danger to workers.
The administrative services
managers for Neurobiology and
Medical Microbiology would not
allow photographs to be taken of
the improvements, Caldwell said,
claiming this would disturb on
going experiments and busy lab
technicians.

Caldwell called the clean-up an
"unusual event because we will
be handling all our chemical stock
in a short period of time."
"A reduction in inventory will
accomplish an increase in safety,"
he added.
So far, Caldwell said, a test-run
last week of 20 labs has been suc
cessful.
With a budget of $150,000, and
1,000 labs set to be cleaned, the
project can be "overwhelming,"
Fyfe said. The project is scheduled
to take several months because of
its size.
According to Fyfe, we will
proceed "building by building,
floor by floor."
