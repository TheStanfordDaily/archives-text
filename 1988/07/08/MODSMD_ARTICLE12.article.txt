# Oil rig explodes in Scotland, kills 163
## 
### 
LONDON â€” In what was being
called the world's worst oil field
disaster, at least 163 persons were
feared dead yesterday after a vi
olent explosion and fire ripped
through an Occidental Petroleum
Corp. oil platform operating in
the North Sea.
By nightfall yesterday, Occiden
tal officials said, at least 69 of the
232 persons thought to have been
on the platform had been recov
ered alive from the water near
the still-burning wreckage of the
platform Piper Alpha, located 120
miles east of the town of Wick in
northern Scotland.
A day-long search by a small
armada of rescue vessels, assisted
by more than 20 helicopters, was
called off just after dark. A total
of 16 bodies had been recovered.
"To be honest with you, when
you look at what's out there,
there's very little hope indeed,"
Peter Morrison, Britain's Minis
ter of State for Energy, said of
the prospect of finding more sur
vivors after flying over the area.
At a news conference in Aber

deen, Scotland, where many oil
companies maintain their North
Sea drilling support operations,
an Occidental official said the dis
aster was apparently triggered by
a leak in the platform's gas com
partment just beneath the crew
quarters.
A rigger on the platform, Derek
Ellington, said he heard a gas leak
"screaming like a banshee" before
the first of a series of explosions.
"It was just bloody horrific, I
can tell you," he said.
Most of those who survived
were either blown off the platform
or leaped from one of the main
decks more than 100 feet into the
sea.
"It was a case of fry and die or
jump and try," survivor Roy
Carey said.
The intensity of the explosions,
which occurred shortly before 10
p.m. Wednesday, split the giant
steel platform in two and sent
flames hundreds of feet into the
air.
Of the platform's 200 perma
nent crew members, nearly half

were believed to have burned to
death in their quarters. Most of
those who survived were among
those at work on one of the two
12-hour shifts.
In addition to the normal crew,
some 30 construction workers
were on the platform installing
pipe.

In London, the secretary of
state for energy, Cecil Parkinson,
told a hushed House of Commons
that "a deep and very, very far
reaching public inquiry" would be
conducted into the disaster.
"The government is determined
to establish urgently the cause of
the explosion and the lessons to

be learned," he said.
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, also speaking in the
House of Commons, praised the
rescue effort and expressed sym
pathy to the families "of the very,
very many we seem to have lost."
