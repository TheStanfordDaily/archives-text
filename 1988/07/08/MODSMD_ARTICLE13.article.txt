TEHRAN, Iran — Iran's Air
Force commander said yesterday
night he has proof that Iran Air
Flight 655 was transmitting an
identifiable civilian radio signal at
the time it was downed by a U.S.
missile Sunday, and he said he
would make this and other infor
mation available to a Pentagon
team investigating the tragedy.
At a news conference here, Brig.
Gen. Mansour Satary constructed
his case against the USS Vin
cennes, which Washington has
said fired its missiles in the mis
taken belief that the airliner was
an Fl4 fighter.
Satary largely ignored the
Iranian government's charge that
the U.S. attack on the civilian
airliner, which killed all 290 pas
sengers and crew, was
premeditated.
But his appearance seemed
clearly designed to prove to world
opinion that Tehran's insistence
that the United States must be
held to account is baaed on more
than an emotional and ideological
belief in American perfidy.
Sticking largely to a military
oriented assessment, Satary criti
cized the U.S. Navy for not using
radio, intelligence and other in
formation he said was readily
available to it — as well as com
mon sense — that would have
identified the plane.
He charged the Americans with
"not having control" over their
own sophisticated systems, and

for amateurish reading of their
own communications.
Condemning American military
procedure during the incident,
and disputing the Pentagon's ac
count of what happened in a num
ber of specific areas, Satary con
tended that such lax behavior
would never have been allowed
"if this were the Gulf of Mexico.
They'd have investigators there
every day to make sure these mis
siles don't go up" into well
traveled civilian air corridors.
"Maybe the echelons of com
mand don't care if it's Iranian
lives," he said.
Dressed in a summer uniform
of blue shirtsleeves and trousers,
Satary, a trim man with salt-and
pepper hair, spoke calmly in Eng
lish. He occasionally lapsed into
wry humor to emphasize his im
plied perplexity over what he
clearly felt was American military
carelessness.
He acknowledged, in response
to a question, that he had received
"several weeks of training in the
United States" at some point in
his career, before the overthrow
of the previous pro-U.S. govern
ment here in 1979.
Satary contradicted the Penta
gon's original insistence that the
Iran Air plane, a wide-body A3OO
Airbus, did not identify itself as
a commercial plane using the IFF
device that automatically emits
identifying electrical pulses.
