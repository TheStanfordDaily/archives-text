The Duke strikes back at Bush
BOSTON — Massachusetts Gov. Michael Du
kakis struck back Thursday at Vice President
George Bush, whose attacks on Dukakis in recent
weeks have apparently raised doubts about Du
kakis among some voters.
Before heading West on a campaign swing,
Dukakis ridiculed Bush for supporting Reagan's
veto of a bill that would warn workers if their
plant is being shut down.
The Senate's passage of a new plant closing
bill, and Attorney General Edwin Meese Ill's
announcement that he will resign in 30 days,
provided the opening.
"I applaud the Senate action," Dukakis said
at a news conference in the Massachusetts
Statehouse. "Meese got 30 days' notice. I think
it is rather ironic that the president and vice
president don't think that honest, hard-working
American workers are entitled to at least what
Mr. Me?se is getting.
"Perhaps the vice president will change his
mind on this issue as he has on offshore drilling
and new taxes."
In the first example, Dukakis was referring to
Bush's break with the administration over plans
to sell oil leases off the California coast. But the
second charge surprised reporters, since Bush
recently pledged never to raise taxes as president.
When challenged yesterday, Dukakis argued,
"The no-tax pledge went out the window last
week. The president signed the catastrophic
health insurance bill. It's going to impose $6
billion in new taxes for elderly citizens and the
vice president supports it."
Kirk O'Donnell, a senior adviser to the Dukakis
campaign, said yesterday,"The Bush campaign
is displeased that the Democratic primary didn't
produce a standard liberal nominee ... Dukakis
has balanced budgets and cut taxes as governor.
So Bush has been banging him around on specific
issues to try to paint him as a liberal, and with
some success."
O'Donnell was referring to Bush's attacks in
the last month, in which he noted that Dukakis
had to raise some Massachusetts taxes recently
in a budget crisis, that he vetoed a law requiring
school children to say the pledge of allegiance
and that murderers were given furloughs under
a state program.
Hollywood writers strike eases
HOLLYWOOD — Striking members of the
Writers Guild of America voted approval of an
interim contract proposal intended to split the
ranks of Hollywood producers, union officials an
nounced yesterday, but the guild strategy suf
fered a blow as two independent producers who
had earlier accepted the terms moved to retreat
from the agreement.
Kings Road Entertainment and Carolco Pic
tures — believed to be the largest of the first
13 companies to accept the new contract — issued
statements yesterday distancing themselves from
the interim agreement after the major studios
and television networks made it clear they would

refuse to do business with companies that made
separate agreements with the guild.
Although the guild said both companies have
signed interim agreements, Carolco said it was
re-examining its position and Kings Road said it
had decided not to hire any writers for the dura
tion of the strike.
CBS yesterday joined NBC, ABC and the Fox
television network in saying it would not buy
programs from companies that signed the interim
agreement.
"We do not believe it is in the best interest of
any producer to sign the interim agreement the
WGA is offering," the network stated. "In support
of that position, we will not enter into new agree
ments for product produced under the interim
WGA agreement."
Separately, top executives of 20th Century Fox,
Walt Disney Pictures and Paramount Pictures
said in a response to a reporter's questions that
they would not accept movies and television shows
from any production companies that signed in
dependently with the guild.
Fifth grader follows Lindbergh
SAN DIEGO — Eleven-year-old Christopher
Lee Marshall whisked off yesterday morning from
San Diego's Montgomery Field on the First leg
of his planned journey to Paris, an effort that
would make him the youngest pilot ever to cross
the Atlantic.
"I'm very happy," Chris said just before the
8:30 a.m. take-off. "I am an ambassador to the
youth of America, and I want to show all the
youth that if I can do my dreams, anyone can."
Chris, who first began flying on his father's
lap at the age of 4, will spend five days in a
single-engine Moonie 252 with a co-pilot, retired
Navy Cmdr. Randy "Duke" Cunningham, trying
to recreate Charles Lindbergh's historic flight to
Paris in 1927. Federal Aviation Administration
regulations will not allow him to have the cockpit
all to himself until the sth grader reaches his
16th birthday.
Just 30 minutes into the flight, over El Centro,
the young pilot — who has logged over 200 flight
hours in 24 types of planes and trained for the
long-distance flight at Miramar Naval Air Station
— was already using an oxygen mask, required
when a plane flies reaches 11,500 feet in altitude.
However, they dropped in altitude when they
struck head winds and thunderstorms. The tur
bulance made Chris ill, but he nonethess flew
the whole way, according to Cunningham. The
pair were forced to make an unscheduled one
hour fuel stop in El Paso, Texas, before flying
on to Kerrville, Texas, their overnight stop.
Chris also flew by instruments for the first
time in his life. Cunningham said he talked Chris
through it and"he did a good job."
Friday's flight plan will take them from Texas
to St. Louis.
