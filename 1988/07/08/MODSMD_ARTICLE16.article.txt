## Stop wasting water 
### 
Faulty sprinklers
cause water loss

WATER, water every
where. . . .
In the dead of night
— when few may bear wit
ness — the Stanford com
munity and the University
are letting untold quantities
of water slip away into
oblivion.
After most Stanford folks
have turned in for the eve
ning, broken, or simply in
efficient sprinkler systems
routinely miss their targets
sending gallons and gallons
of water running down
walkways, street gutters
and even the barren banks
of Lake Lagunita.
At a time when San Fran
cisco Public Utilities Coun
cil is requiring Stanford to
reduce its total water usage
by 29 percent to counteract
a severe drought in North
ern California, wastefulness
in the University's water
system cannot be tolerated.
Though the University is
to be praised for watering
its grassy spots during the
cooler nightime hours, the
dark of night is hiding these
obvious and reparable flaws.
Possibly one of the worst
examples of this waste are
the sprinklers that line the
side lawns of Wilbur Hall
along Escondido Road.
Seventeen of the sprinklers
watering this small stretch

of greenery have become
miniature geysers, losing
the larger part of their
water to the street gutters
they border.
Officials in Operations
and Maintenance say van
dals may have stolen these
sprinkler heads, underscor
ing the important role local
residents must play in in
forming the department
about the conditions of their
equipment.
Closer to the center of
campus, the sprinklers be
tween Green and Meyer Li
braries also flood walkways
and send bicyclists swerving
to avoid surprise showers on
their way home.
Near the Boathouse, the
sprinkler system designed to
water the few grassy slopes
of Lagunita is misdirected
towards the bottom of the
lake.
While other watering sys
tems here — such as the
graceful sprinklers that
shower lawns near Encina
Gym on Campus Drive —
seem to be working well, the
University and the commu
nity must wake up to this
waste elsewhere on campus
despite the late hours.
Operations and Mainte
nance employees, who un
derstandably don't come to
work at 3 a.m. to monitor
sprinklers, need community
members' help in targeting
this waste and weeding it
out before the campus
drowns during one of the
worst droughts this century.
