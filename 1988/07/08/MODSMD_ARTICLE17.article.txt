Students need to learn meaning behind 'Black' shirts

I AM WRITING in response
to the column last Tuesday,
titled "Students need to
show more tolerance."
I feel that Jennifer Schmid
made the error of assuming
that a certain racial act was
transposable. One cannot base a
valid argument against wearing
"Black by Popular Demand"
shirts on the reasoning that
"Aryan by the Grace of God"
shirts would be considered
racist. This assumes that both

groups would wear their respec
tive shirts for similar reasons.
"Black by Popular Demand"
shirts are an expression of
black pride. Such outlets are
necessary because black culture
is consistently viewed and
treated in a derogatory manner
in this country.
Storybook heroes are never
portrayed as black. The leading
man is never black in popular
American films. Black history is
never required reading, although

white history is always required
reading. As a result, American
citizens do not evolve with black
role models.
That is why we remind our
selves of the good in ourselves
by wearing such shirts. The
purpose is not to change your
attitude about us; actually, we
don't care what you think
about the shirts. They are
meant to remind ourselves.
Aryanism, on the other hand,
has been used as a tool of ter
rorism and oppression. This
ideal provided Hitler with the
psychological lever to turn nor
mally sane Germans into blood
thirsty barbarians, with the
result being the unforgivable
torture and murder of over six
million Jews. As you see, the
slogans "Black by Popular
Demand" and "Aryan by the
Grace of God" have completely
different historical objectives. It
is only the negative images you
associate with blackness that
make you fear this slogan.
If you had grown up knowing
what true communal living was,
where the aged are not disposed
of in nursing homes like yes
teryear's broken dreams, you
would know why I love my
blackness. If you had seen her

bal medicine which I still trust
more than my medical knowl
edge when I'm in a pinch, you
would know why I love my
blackness.
But you will never know why
I love my blackness until you
take the time to listen, until
black American history is as
much a requirement at Stanford
University as white American
history. No one complains of
other cultures expressing pride
in themselves. I have never
seen an editorial asking for the
banning of buttons saying
"110% Irish and Proud of it."
That is because we know some
thing of the good in Irish cul
ture; we are taught European
culture since childhood. If you
had also studied black culture,
you would understand its beau
ty, too.
Come on, Stanford. We expect
more from the leader in higher
education. Follow the lead of
some of America's black uni
veristies, which teach all of
American history, as well as
world history. Maybe one day
you too will understand why I
am proud to be Black — by
Popular Demand.
