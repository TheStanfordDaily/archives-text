## The
						riddle of city gangs 
### 
MIKE TYSON felled Mi
chael Spinks in 91
seconds. That was scary.
Almost as scary was a recent
feature in the Los Angeles Times
on the increase in gang violence
in that metropolis. At least a per
son a day, usually a minority in
South Central L.A., gets hit these
days in random drive-by shoot
ings, the latest manifestation of
the chaos that is the relationship
between the Bloods and the Crips
— the two black gangs that have
turned the city into a target range.
People have a lot of theories
about why gang violence has been
on the upswing lately. There were
a lot of quotes in that article about
the lack of fathers in black homes
— that's the standard sociological
mumbo-jumbo, and no matter
how much evidence is presented
relating gang violence to the eco
nomic underpinnings determining
its vehemence, the theory never
seems to die off. It's easy. Just
point to the minorities and yell a
lot about their abnormal family
lives. Never mind the fact that
41 percent of all Americans these
days are unmarried. That's dif
ferent.
I grew up in Pasadena, a city
not too far from L.A., and gangs
are a fact of life there too, despite
the city's well-cultivated image as
a suburban flowerpot. I lived for

several years in a neighborhood
on the border of the Jungle — a
seedy section full of guns and
ramshackle tenements, primo
gangland turf. Nobody ever both
ered to come into my neighbor
hood and subdivide it with the
telltale graffiti, which was lucky
for me and mine; but there was
always that unsubtle charge in
the air, the rumors floating
around about who died last night
two blocks away.
I thought I was streetwise as a
kid, but I was always too much
of a bookworm to spend much
time on the street finding out
what was right and what wasn't.
I had no idea what the gangs
wanted, despite all my second
hand assumptions. Now I come
home every summer and make
sure my bike doesn't take me be
yond well-defined lines. I'm not
adventurous. And I don't wear my
Cardinal baseball cap. What
would be as innocuous as any
other fashion statement at Stan
ford is obviously an arrogation of
identity at home — baseball caps
are now as much of a show of
allegiance to your gang as low
riding pants and low-riding cars.
So there are a lot of theories
about gangs. Since Los Angeles
now holds the dubious honor of
being the gang capital of the
world, it has become a Mecca for

sociologists of the underclass. The
predominant truism is that if we
pour money into the poorest com
munities, the gang problem will
become a relic of the past.
But, the poor will always be
with us. And the more we let
poverty fester, the stupider our
decisions about how to handle it
become, and the angrier the poor
become. They are killing them
selves, but anyone who's ever
watched hungry rats in a cage
will see no mystery in that. And
the saddest part is that as long
as the gangs confine themselves
to places like South Central L.A.
and keep their visitations to
Westwood at the barest mini
mum, the white middle class will
be content to shake their heads
at the TV news every night and
wonder why those minorities are
so goddam self-destructive.
