# Student evicted from housing
## 
### Susan Wurlitzer 
A non-matriculated summer
student was forced to leave Uni
versity housing Wednesday be
cause of "belligerent behavior."
University officials have
prohibited William McCann from
re-entering any campus housing
or from having contact with any
of the residents in his former dor
mitory, Hammarsjkold.
Police were called in Wednesday
morning to observe as McCann,
age 31 and a resident of Oregon,
moved out of Hammarskjold
House after a series of incidents
in which he verbally abused fellow
residents, staff and University of
ficials.
Residential Dean Diana Conklin
said she recommended that
McCann be expelled from Univer
sity housing for repeatedly

abusive incidents, including a
"main incident" Monday, which
made her "feel a need to have
him out of there."
Conklin would not elaborate on
this final event.
Conklin described McCann's be
havior in general as "intolerable."
"He was aggressive, hostile and
belligerent to people in the house
including house officers. He
swore, cursed, shouted and was
belittling and some felt he was
threatening."
The incident called to mind a
similar incident in May when
freshman Kenny Ehrman was
removed from University housing
for repeatedly making sexist and
homophobic remarks.
Director of Housing Rodger
Whitney said McCann was
removed from his residence be
cause he "violated the terms of

the housing agreement" which re
quires "respect for the rights of
others, especially residence staff."
Hammarskjold residents, all of
whom asked to remain anony
mous, described McCann as "ir
rational and scary," saying he
would not let people leave when
he talked with them and that he
always talked about his dealings
with the police.
Residents also said McCann
made racially offensive statements
to Hammarskjold Residence Assis
tant Shauna Jackson.
While McCann has moved out
of housing, he is still enrolled in
a computer graphics course.
'He was unpredictable, we were
afraid of what might happen, and
people in the house felt threatened
for their safety," one student said.
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs

Norm Robinson said the Univer
sity has no uniform prescription
for removing a student from
campus housing, but emphasized
that McCann is not a regular
Stanford student.
