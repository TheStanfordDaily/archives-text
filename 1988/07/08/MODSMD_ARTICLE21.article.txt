## Politics at Stanford are responsible for attack on Hoover Institution 
### 
STANFORD'S attempt to
oust W. Glenn Campbell,
the widely respected direc
tor of the Hoover Institution, is
only the latest in a series of
intolerant and increasingly par
tisan acts by key figures at the
University.
Indeed, "partisan" may be the
best one-word epitaph of Stan
ford President Donald Kennedy's
eight years in office. He en
dorsed Rose Bird, a Democrat,
for chief justice of the Califor
nia Supreme Court. He led the
retreat from the Reagan Presi
dential Library, now lost to
Stanford. He faded away while
the Western Culture course was
gutted, reappearing to dismiss
complaints because they came
from "Republicans."
Now he is condoning, if not
orchestrating, an attack upon
the head of the only conserva
tive "department" left at Stan
ford, the Hoover Institution.
It is not hard to understand
what Stanford liberals don't like
about the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace.
Located in the center of the
sun-drenched Palo Alto campus,
it is home to a large number of
conservative scholars, more than
50 of whom have advised or

served in the Reagan Adminis
tration.
While it is common in the
United States for faculties to
have "liberal" majorities, at
Stanford, Democrats have
achieved an extraordinary
dominance. A recent study by
George Marotta, senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
showed that of 218 professors
in nine departments and schools
at Stanford, 80 percent of those
registered to vote are Demo
crats, 10 percent are Indepen
dents, and only 10 percent are
Republicans.
Democrats have overwhelming
majorities in English (93 per
cent), Sociology (88 percent),
Anthropology (87 percent), His
tory and Political Science (85
percent each). They are only
slightly less ascendant in Philos
ophy (77 percent), the School of
Education (77 percent), Econom
ics (71 percent), and the Law
School (64 percent).
In many departments Republi
cans are an endangered species.
They are already extinct in the
Sociology department, and only
one each is to be found in An
thropology, English and History.
These lone Republicans are sad,
isolated creatures. The one in

the Anthropology Department, a
Mormon with four children,
somehow keeps faith and family
alive among colleages who love
every culture but their own.
New committees and pro
grams that advance the liberal
agenda have proliferated in
recent years. Innovative Aca
demic Courses for example,
openly describes itself as "a
channel for political activism,"
and the cover of its Spring
1988 catalogue carries pictures
of students holding placards that
read "Hands off Nicaragua" and
"Block Bork." Students signing
up for a course on industrial
plant closings study what might
be called the Mondale Thesis:
"The myth of service sec
tor/high tech has been exposed
as a lie as millions of workers
and countless communities find
themselves in an economic was
teland."
Students wondering why
Johnny can't read will be
taught to "recognize the influ
ence of sexism, racism and
elitism on illiteracy." Students
do not come away from these
courses merely indoctrinated,
they receive credit for it. Com
plains the Stanford Review, a
student newspaper, "the I AC is

little more than a trade school
for protesters."
Several of the University's
more "mainstream" programs
seem to exist solely for the pur
pose of advancing a particular
political agenda. How many
members of the Program in
Feminist Studies are pro-life, as
opposed to pro-choice? How
many members of the Nuclear
Disarmament Center support the
SDI program? The answer is
few to none.
Despite its reputation as a
conservative think tank, the
scholars at Hoover are much
less monolithic in their views on
a wide range of issues than
many departmental faculties and
they don't offer students credit
for espousing them.
Even in the professional
schools, whose practical atmos
phere tends to inhibit political
flights of fancy, the left has
now gotten airborne. Critical
Legal Studies has gained a foot
hold in the Stanford Law
School, where its adherents
vigorously attack the very sub
ject they are supposed to be
teaching. To the "Critters," as
they call themselves, sounding
like an infestation of termites,
legal statutes have no fixed

meaning, legal precedent is irrel
evant and the rule of law itself
is nothing more than a tool by
which one class (guess which?)
oppresses the others. This is
merely Marxism by another
name, and many "crits" do
indeed advocate a radical re
structuring of U.S. society, be
ginning with the dismantling of
our legal system.
Stanford trustees might
reflect on which is the greater
threat to academic freedom: a
conservative think tank in
which reason rules and debate
is encouraged, or a liberal uni
versity administration dedicated
to the institutionalization of its
own ideology. They might also
consider whether Stanford
would be better off with a pres
ident who encourages reasoned
debate, refrains from publicly
supporting political causes and
candidates and strives to
preserve some balance in Stan
ford's programs and faculty.
To this last end, calling off
the attack on the Hoover Insti
tution would be a good place to
start.

School, where its adherents
vigorously attack the very sub
ject they are supposed to be
teaching. To the "Critters," as
they call themselves, sounding
like an infestation of termites,
legal statutes have no fixed

meaning, legal precedent is irrel
evant and the rule of law itself
is nothing more than a tool by
which one class (guess which?)
oppresses the others. This is
merely Marxism by another
name, and many "crits" do
indeed advocate a radical re
structuring of U.S. society, be
ginning with the dismantling of
our legal system.
Stanford trustees might
reflect on which is the greater
threat to academic freedom: a
conservative think tank in
which reason rules and debate
is encouraged, or a liberal uni
versity administration dedicated
to the institutionalization of its
own ideology. They might also
consider whether Stanford
would be better off with a pres
ident who encourages reasoned
debate, refrains from publicly
supporting political causes and
candidates and strives to
preserve some balance in Stan
ford's programs and faculty.
To this last end, calling off
the attack on the Hoover Insti
tution would be a good place to
start.

STANFORD'S attempt to
oust W. Glenn Campbell,
the widely respected direc
tor of the Hoover Institution, is
only the latest in a series of
intolerant and increasingly par
tisan acts by key figures at the
University.
Indeed, "partisan" may be the
best one-word epitaph of Stan
ford President Donald Kennedy's
eight years in office. He en
dorsed Rose Bird, a Democrat,
for chief justice of the Califor
nia Supreme Court. He led the
retreat from the Reagan Presi
dential Library, now lost to
Stanford. He faded away while
the Western Culture course was
gutted, reappearing to dismiss
complaints because they came
from "Republicans."
Now he is condoning, if not
orchestrating, an attack upon
the head of the only conserva
tive "department" left at Stan
ford, the Hoover Institution.
It is not hard to understand
what Stanford liberals don't like
about the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace.
Located in the center of the
sun-drenched Palo Alto campus,
it is home to a large number of
conservative scholars, more than
50 of whom have advised or

served in the Reagan Adminis
tration.
While it is common in the
United States for faculties to
have "liberal" majorities, at
Stanford, Democrats have
achieved an extraordinary
dominance. A recent study by
George Marotta, senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
showed that of 218 professors
in nine departments and schools
at Stanford, 80 percent of those
registered to vote are Demo
crats, 10 percent are Indepen
dents, and only 10 percent are
Republicans.
Democrats have overwhelming
majorities in English (93 per
cent), Sociology (88 percent),
Anthropology (87 percent), His
tory and Political Science (85
percent each). They are only
slightly less ascendant in Philos
ophy (77 percent), the School of
Education (77 percent), Econom
ics (71 percent), and the Law
School (64 percent).
In many departments Republi
cans are an endangered species.
They are already extinct in the
Sociology department, and only
one each is to be found in An
thropology, English and History.
These lone Republicans are sad,
isolated creatures. The one in

the Anthropology Department, a
Mormon with four children,
somehow keeps faith and family
alive among colleages who love
every culture but their own.
New committees and pro
grams that advance the liberal
agenda have proliferated in
recent years. Innovative Aca
demic Courses for example,
openly describes itself as "a
channel for political activism,"
and the cover of its Spring
1988 catalogue carries pictures
of students holding placards that
read "Hands off Nicaragua" and
"Block Bork." Students signing
up for a course on industrial
plant closings study what might
be called the Mondale Thesis:
"The myth of service sec
tor/high tech has been exposed
as a lie as millions of workers
and countless communities find
themselves in an economic was
teland."
Students wondering why
Johnny can't read will be
taught to "recognize the influ
ence of sexism, racism and
elitism on illiteracy." Students
do not come away from these
courses merely indoctrinated,
they receive credit for it. Com
plains the Stanford Review, a
student newspaper, "the I AC is

little more than a trade school
for protesters."
Several of the University's
more "mainstream" programs
seem to exist solely for the pur
pose of advancing a particular
political agenda. How many
members of the Program in
Feminist Studies are pro-life, as
opposed to pro-choice? How
many members of the Nuclear
Disarmament Center support the
SDI program? The answer is
few to none.
Despite its reputation as a
conservative think tank, the
scholars at Hoover are much
less monolithic in their views on
a wide range of issues than
many departmental faculties and
they don't offer students credit
for espousing them.
Even in the professional
schools, whose practical atmos
phere tends to inhibit political
flights of fancy, the left has
now gotten airborne. Critical
