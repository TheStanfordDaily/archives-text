## Summer science charms students 
### Anirvan Ghosh 
Joti Sandhu was holding a
human brain in her hands for the
first time in her life. She hesitated
for a moment, and then asked her
TA a question.
"By looking at a brain can you
tell if it belongs to a man or a
woman?"
The Stanford Medical Youth
Science program is buzzing with
questions like these. The 19 Bay
Area high school students in the
intensive five-week program seem
ambitious and restless. The syl
labus is filled with topics found
in many Stanford biology and

human biology courses: molecular
structure, genetic engineering,
human neuro-anatomy and bio
medical ethics.
And now they know you can't
tell the difference between the
brain of a man and a woman by
looking at it.
According to the directors and
undergraduate counselors in the
program, their primary concern
was to design a technically
rigorous course that would inspire
the participants, most of whom
come from underprivileged and
minority backgrounds. Students
also learn about medical careers
from the many counselors who

are mooring in one of the biolog
ical sciences.
Stanford undergraduates Mi
chael McCullough and Marc
Lawrence started the program
last year with funds from Stan
ford Hospital and other donors
for a pilot program that would
introduce underpriviledged stu
dents to health careers.
While students live in Durand
House on campus this year, last
summer the program had no res
idential base and students com
muted to Stanford. Eight students
from East Palo Alto and East

Stanford Hospital. Stewart and Montgomery assisted at the birth of the baby as part of the Youth
Science Program.
Menlo Park participated. But the
program's success attracted an
other sponsor, whose dona
tions have funded the establish
ment of a more elaborate and so
phisticated program, which in
cludes residential education.
Doris Cohen, who graduated
from an East Palo Alto high school
in June, said she was glad to be
challenged. "I am really excited
about going to Cal State Los An
geles this fall, and I think this
program will give me a
headstart."
Their lab session on the sub
divisions of the brain soon turned
into an animated discussion about
strokes, paralysis and mental ill
ness. In addition to labs and lec
tures, students get to work closely
with hospital staff. Juanita Mont
gomery, who will be a senior this
fall at an Oakland high school,
recalled an experience where she
helped deliver a baby:
"My eyes began to water. It was
like you could feel this pain she
was going through. I didn't even
notice when lunchtime came... .
I felt I had to be there for this
lady, so that if I could do some
thing a little extra that may help,
I would be there."

Stanford medical students act
as mentors to the program par
ticipants. They spend time with
them at Durand, which is also the
headquarters of the program. For
the student who said she wanted
to be a gynecologist because Bill
Cosby was one, the mentors are
living examples of what it really
takes to get there.
The establishment of a resi
dence program is the most impor
tant aspect of this year's program,
according to the directors. With
students living together as well as
studying, cooperation has a
chance over competition.
"What's really special about
being in a residential program is
that the students learn to work
together instead of being intensely
competetive. They experience a bit
of college life while still being in
high school," counselor Neal Rojas
said.
Evenings in Durand are much
like those in a college dormitory.
People play games and plan dorm
programming. Students prepare
for term projects on current med
ical and social issues such as AIDS
among adolescents and gene
therapy.
There are frequent evening dis
cussions on what they learned
during the day. Public speaking
workshops teach students how
gestures and eye contact can en
hance technical presentations.
