## Summer science charms students

Joti Sandhu was holding a
human brain in her hands for the
first time in her life. She hesitated
for a moment, and then asked her
TA a question.
"By looking at a brain can you
tell if it belongs to a man or a
woman?"
The Stanford Medical Youth
Science program is buzzing with
questions like these. The 19 Bay
Area high school students in the
intensive five-week program seem
ambitious and restless. The syl
labus is filled with topics found
in many Stanford biology and

human biology courses: molecular
structure, genetic engineering,
human neuro-anatomy and bio
medical ethics.
And now they know you can't
tell the difference between the
brain of a man and a woman by
looking at it.
According to the directors and
undergraduate counselors in the
program, their primary concern
was to design a technically
rigorous course that would inspire
the participants, most of whom
come from underprivileged and
minority backgrounds. Students
also learn about medical careers
from the many counselors who

are mooring in one of the biolog
ical sciences.
Stanford undergraduates Mi
chael McCullough and Marc
Lawrence started the program
last year with funds from Stan
ford Hospital and other donors
for a pilot program that would
introduce underpriviledged stu
dents to health careers.
While students live in Durand
House on campus this year, last
summer the program had no res
idential base and students com
muted to Stanford. Eight students
