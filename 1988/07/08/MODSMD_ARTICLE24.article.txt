# Intramurals relax in a slow, sweaty season
## 
### Perry Bechky 
Fewer participants. Fewer
leagues. Fewer sports. And
fewer controversies with more
fun. In Summer Intramurals,
less really is more.
IMs have always been played
during the summer. But just
as campus life has taken on a
different, more languid feel,
summer sports have also be
come more relaxed.
During the academic year,
the competitive attitudes and
fanaticism of intramural sports
confirms the "work hard/play
hard" reputation of Stanford
students. Though most of the
participants say they are play
ing for fun, the ferocity of some
of the games suggests that
many Sunday athletes also play
to win. A complex point system
which determines winners in
three divisions goads die-hard
intramural teams to athletic
excess.
After spring quarter finals,
however, the atmosphere
changes, becoming more stable,
in some peoples' opinions. Ac
ademic pressure relaxes (often
disappears) over the summer.
Summer jobs require more
patience than brain power. Stu
dents don't work as hard; nor
do they play as hard. Hundreds
of students are playing IMs this
summer, but most of them con
sider pleasure, not victory,
their top priority.
Senior Dave Shuey, student
coordinator of summer in
tramurals, said the new ap
proach is a nice change. "It's
so laid back. It makes my job
easy."

With the reduced intensity,
there are also fewer disputes
over rules and fewer com
plaints about the quality of the
referees.
Several factors contribute to
the slower pace over the sum
mer. The absence of a point
system eliminates any overall
winners and discourages the
drive to be successful in every
event. Furthermore, certain
teams noted for their intensity
do not participate in summer
IMs. Among these are the fra
ternities and the twin nemeses
of all intramural teams during
the academic year: "Biz 1" and
"Biz 2."
The two teams from the
Graduate School of Business
are perennially successful.
Every year both teams finish
among the top 10. Translating
the caveat emptor ethic of the
marketplace into a menacing
presence on the field, the two
teams have terrified opponents
with their intense dedication
and fierce competitiveness. IM
watchers agree on one point:
these athletes work harder and
play harder than any other
team.
Because of their absence
"there is still good competition,
but it's not as competitive,"
Shuey said.
Howie Dellmar, director of
intramurals, concurred with
Shuey's assessment. "It's very
informal during the summer.
It's enjoyable, as it is during
the school year, but it's less
competitive," he said.
Yet, not all of the successful
teams take summer off. Dirk's
Jerks, a team of graduate students
in physics, will hit the field this
summer. A consistent winner,
they came in fifth place overall
this year. The Jerks also hold the
1984 and 1985 co-ed summer
softball titles and will try to match
that accomplishment this year.
Jim McTiernan, a team member
since 1982, attributes the team's
continued success to the presence
of many committed and talented

athletes in the department. His
dedication seems prodigious:
while racing to finish his doc
torate in solar physics for a fall
quarter graduation, he is playing
both co-ed and B-league summer
softball. But McTiernan insists he
is not unique.
The EV (Escondido Village) All-
Stars, last summer's B-league
basketball champions, are return
ing this summer to defend their
title. Because of many approach
ing graduations, this summer will
be the team's last season together.
The All-Star's Basketball team
lost in the first round of the

playoffs during the academic year,
but captain David McConnell said
he believes the team can retain
its summer title.
Comparing the summer season
to the school year, McConnell ad
mitted that "the competition is of
lower caliber, but we enjoy it
(playing) more."
So IMs look like they'll flourish
in the sultry weather. And be
cause of the reduced intensity, it's
not likely anyone will practice
their Billy Martin or Pete Rose
imitations on good-natured
players.
