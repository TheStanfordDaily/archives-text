## Diversions 
### Karin McDonald Staff writer 
The clock you've been watching since 2:37 reads 4:58. With
just two minutes to play, you go for the long bomb out the
door and score for the home team: now you're into overtime.
Here's a play-by-play run of stuff to do for this weekend.
On your marks
You're all tensed up from the game-time action. You need to
relax with a frosty cold one, and the Tied House in Mountain

View is just the place to go. Set
in a renovated warehouse, the
Tied House brew pub has atmos
phere to burn and three types of
home-brew to boot. I suggest a
few pints of the Amber, and don't
forget the beer cheese.
Food for thought
After a reasonable stay at the
Tied House, you realize that man
cannot live on beer cheese alone.
And there are only two types of
food you can eat voraciously in
good conscience: Chinese and Ital
ian.
For Chinese food, Jing-Jing is
the place. Don't be afraid to try
•the hot dishes — they're the best
things on the menu. As for Italian,
Ramona's is a solid bet. Ask for
extra garlic on everything, and
you'll be closer to the real thing.
If Robyn is your hostess, say hello
to her.
Now that you have finished
your meal and are thoughtfully
sucking on that after-dinner mint,
you're probably saying to your

self, "My, wouldn't it be nice to
see an unconventional and
abstract internationally acclaimed
foreign film tonight?" Stray no
further than your downtown lo
cation and go see "Wings of
Desire" playing at the Aquarius
Theater.
For the non-thinking man
Sometimes, though, you just
don't have the energy to struggle
with the eccentricities and intel
lectualisms of a Cannes-favorite.
If this be your folly, then another
strong film, "Da," is also running
at this theater. No lines, no
parking problems and no pre
teens.
If your timing is rusty and you
have a few minutes to kill on the
clock before showtime, stroll into
Stacey's Bookstore. This literary
oasis is rarely crowded, open late
and they thankfully don't play to
the pretensions of an espresso ma
chine. Start in the humor section,
and the time will go by quickly.

And the clock ticks down
Coming down the post-movie
final stretch, you'll find yourself
with a dearth of options. It seems
that in their infinite wisdom, the
evil business coalition of Palo Alto
decided to cut down on overtime
by shutting the city down by 11
p.m.
One place that is open late (be
sides that light-eating palace,
Denny's) is the University
Creamery. They serve up a mean
chocolate shake, and you can catch
up on the newest mod fashions
of Palo Alto youths at no extra
cost. Hot dog.
For the hip and happenin'
A specialty this weekend at the
Last Day Saloon on Clement
Street in San Francisco: Zulu
Spear and Strictly Roots playing
rootsy-reggae and world beat
music. Zulu Spear is one of the
best bands around with their con
gas and steel drums, and their
music is impossible not to dance
to. Trust me — these guys hop.
