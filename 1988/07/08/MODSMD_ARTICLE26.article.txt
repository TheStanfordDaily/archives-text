# Delectables delight daring diners
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Next to Little Tokyo, Palo Alto may very well
have the largest concentration of excellent Japanese
restaurants in the Bay Area, maybe the state. With
such an awesome assortment of excellent eateries,
the inexperienced or indecisive diner sometimes
faces a formidable decision when the urge for a
Japanese meal hits. Thus, to help sort out the
incredible from the merely edible, this edition of
Dining Out highlights the most memorable and
mouthwatering spots for sushi as well as warmer
fare.
Fuki-Sushi
4119 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
494-9383
Offering just about any type of viand that pops
into mind, Fuki-Sushi is the best all-around
Japanese restaurant in the area. The sushi bar is
simply outstanding, serving tasty fishes at tempting
prices, while the luxurious dining rooms hold other

great surprises for the seeker of cooked cuisine.
The best bet here are the do-it-yourself dishes.
No, you don't get to do all of the fun stuff that
the chefs at Benihana's do, as insurance companies
are not overeager to cover restaurants that encour
age their customers to manipulate razor-sharp cut
lery at blinding speeds; however, the limited diner
participation in preparing shabu shabu (meat and
vegetables in a miso soup base) and chanko nabe
(seafood in a similar base), while not as thrilling,
yields equally delicious results.

The lucky customers that order
either of these dishes are pre
sented with a tureen of hot water,
an assortment of vegetables and
tofu plus a plate of meat or fish.
By combining the ingredients that
strike the eater's fancy into the
water, a tasty dish develops that
utterly destroys all of the sub
liminal warnings that advise,
"Don't play with your food."
Tokyo
448 University Ave.
Palo Alto
325-1605
Though it is a smaller restau
rant that leaves all of the cooking

to trained professionals, Tokyo is
another outstanding spot. The
sushi is greatly overpriced at ap
proximately $1.50 per piece (what
you can get a pair for at other
places), but the remaining sec
tions of the large menu make this
one of the best restaurants in all

of Palo Alto.
Teriyaki and tempura are the
tour de force here. Tokyo creates
an extremely pleasant teriyaki
sauce to cover a variety of meats
and seafood, and the light, fresh
tempura makes other restaurants
envious.
With mild miso and a crisp
salad with a great sesame dressing
served as a starter, every meal is
a fantastic feast.
Miyake
261 University Ave.
Palo Alto
323-9419
When you hear the staff yelling
at you upon your arrival, don't
take it as an insult or run away
pell mell. Just like many restau
rants in Japan, the 150-decibel

address is meant to serve as a
welcome to an establishment that
the workers take pride in.
At Miyake, they have every
right to pride. Serving pretty good
food at very good prices, this is
the place for budget hunters and
aficionados alike. The sushi is
consistently decent, while the
cooked food is always darn tasty.
The real bargain is the lunch
time specials, featuring miso, a
small salad, steamed rice and an
entree for $3.95. As a result, the
joint is jam-packed around noon
time, but don't let the masses
steer you away from the good food
for the clearly inferior but com
parably priced cuisine at a place
like Burger King; a Whopper is
good sometimes, but it just cannot
compare to a Miyake meal.

Watercourse Way
165 Channing Ave.
Palo Alto
329-8827
This is another place with a
surprising entrance but great, rea
sonable food. Watercourse Way is
a hot tub and sauna place with a
small sushi restaurant tucked
away in a corner, so tiny that
there is always at least a half-hour
wait for one of the dozen tables.
The patients find themselves
greatly rewarded for their
diligence, as this is unquestiona
bly the best sushi value in the
area if not the world. For about
$8, Watercourse serves a unique
miso (onions and other surprises
are nestled among the tofu and
soy), a small appetizer and enough
sushi to fill anyone with a normal
appetite.
