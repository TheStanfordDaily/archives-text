# Delectables delight daring diners

Next to Little Tokyo, Palo Alto may very well
have the largest concentration of excellent Japanese
restaurants in the Bay Area, maybe the state. With
such an awesome assortment of excellent eateries,
the inexperienced or indecisive diner sometimes
faces a formidable decision when the urge for a
Japanese meal hits. Thus, to help sort out the
incredible from the merely edible, this edition of
Dining Out highlights the most memorable and
mouthwatering spots for sushi as well as warmer
fare.
Fuki-Sushi
4119 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
494-9383
Offering just about any type of viand that pops
into mind, Fuki-Sushi is the best all-around
Japanese restaurant in the area. The sushi bar is
simply outstanding, serving tasty fishes at tempting
prices, while the luxurious dining rooms hold other

great surprises for the seeker of cooked cuisine.
The best bet here are the do-it-yourself dishes.
No, you don't get to do all of the fun stuff that
the chefs at Benihana's do, as insurance companies
are not overeager to cover restaurants that encour
age their customers to manipulate razor-sharp cut
lery at blinding speeds; however, the limited diner
participation in preparing shabu shabu (meat and
vegetables in a miso soup base) and chanko nabe
(seafood in a similar base), while not as thrilling,
yields equally delicious results.
