"Bull Durham"
Varsity Theatre
456 University Ave.
Palo Alto
As far as baseball movies go,
Bull Durham is a bottom of the
ninth, two outs, three balls, two
strikes game-winning RBI. . .
well, maybe not that great, but a
wonderful film nonetheless. Ron
Shelton, in his debut as a director,
successfully portrays the trials
and tribulations of minor league
baseball players without losing
the audience in the game's jargon
and without sacrificing the feel of
the game.
A large measure of the film's
success is owed to the fine
performances of its leading actors.
Kevin Costner, as Crash Davis, is
our tragic hero who has wallowed
in the minor leagues for more
than 10 years, a victim of his
tendency to rationalize his game.

Susan Sarandon, who is begin
ning to come into her own as a
genuine leading actress, plays
Annie Savoy with wicked aban
don. The Durham Bulls resident
expert, she is wonderful to behold,
bringing Annie to life with sultry
sex appeal seldom found among
the plastic beauties so often seen
in today's movies.
Anyway, every season she picks
a member of the Bulls with whom
to have an affair. The recipient
of her affections always has the
best season of his career. This
time around she chooses Ebby
Calvin Laloosh, the pitching
prospect whom Crash is called on
to "break in." Tim Robbins gives
an able performance playing the
klutzy young pitcher that repre
sents the Bulls' hope for a suc
cessful season. He exudes a cer
tain amount of charm in portray
ing an inexperienced young man
thrust into the limelight of pro

fessional sports.
Following the rollercoaster lives
of these three characters is
enthralling for its entertainment
value, and captivating as charac
ter studies of three very different
people whose lives are interdepen
dent.
Sht:lton's screenplay succeeds
with its economy of dialogue, de
pending not so much on what his
characters are saying, but what
they are doing. Whether its Ebby
philandering before his pitching
debut, or Crash torturing himself
before batting, or Annie's om
nipresence at the Bulls' games,
Shelton never fails to keep the
audience's attention glued on the
film's characters.
An added bonus is Max Patkin.
The cameo appearance of the
perineal clown prince of baseball
is alone worth the price of admis
