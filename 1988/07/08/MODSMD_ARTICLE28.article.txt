## Baseball season rounds second, stops for break 
### 
The last jump shot has merci
fully fallen through the net
at the Forum, the final
forehand has sailed beyond the
baseline at the All England Club
and the first touchdown scored
on the gridiron has yet to hit the
headlines.
Today, and for the next few
weeks, its nothing but our na
tional pastime, pure and simple.
With the Midsummer Classic, the
All-Star Game, upon us, let's for
get about all the talk of collusion
among the owners and just savor
the moment.

It's time for baseball to take
center stage. The season is half
over, a natural time to reflect on
what has transpired and to spec
ulate on what's yet to come.
As expected, the New York Mets
and Oakland Athletics are leading
their respective divisions. But not
all has gone according to plan in
the major leagues.
The Detroit Tigers, a team few
gave a chance to repeat, are atop
the American League East. And,
the Minnesota Twins, a team no
one gave a chance to repeat are
clipping the heels of the mighty
Athletics.
Perhaps most shocking of all:
The Los Angeles Dodgers are alive
and well and winning in Chavez
Ravine.
No team has distanced itself far
enough from the field to allow it
to cruise through the second half.
On the flip side, though, with the
exception of the Baltimore
Orioles, Seattle Mariners and At
lanta Braves, no one is completely
out of the race.

Fans in Pittsburgh, Cleveland
and on the north side of Chicago
are delighting in the return of
major league baseball to their
hometowns. The imposters of
recent years no longer don the
uniforms in the clubhouses of the
Pirates, Indians and Cubs. In
stead, the faithful get a chance to
marvel at the genuine article in
the likes of Bobby Bonilla, Joe
Carter and Rafael Palmeiro.
Before the 1987 season, Sports
Illustrated dubbed the Indians the
best team in the American
League. Needless to say, they
weren't.
But the Tribe came out like
gangbusters in 1988 and vaulted
to the top of the AL East. They've
struggled of late, due in large part
to the misfortune that has befal
len Greg Swindell.
Swindell had 10 wins under his
belt by May 30 and hasn't upped
his victory total since. If the gods
of baseball decide to rejuvenate
Swindell during those magical
three days known as the All-Star
break, as they have done for so
many before him, there's still a
chance that Municipal Stadium
will be filled to its capacity of
73,000 come September.
As far as I'm concerned, the
most exciting development
in baseball this year is the
return of pitching. The ridiculous
surge in home runs that made
baseball scores resemble the
tallies from arena football contests
last year is gone and forgotten.
(I think Peter Ueberroth had
the lively ball removed and
thereby created the power short
age. But, whatever the reason, I
don't miss the daily 13-12 games
one bit.)
There's nothing more exciting
than watching two of the league's
best hurlers duel it out in a low
scoring battle. I remember a game
a couple years back where Dwight
Gooden was facing Fernando
Valenzuela. Note that I identify
the game by the pitching
matchup, not by the teams play
ing.

Anyway, in the late innings
Gooden faced a bases loaded, no
out situation and retired the
Dodgers without allowing a run.
In the next inning, Valenzuela
faced the same situation and
couldn't work out of it. Gooden
emerged as the victor.
Classic stuff. The stuff of which
memories are made. Like a Dave
Righetti no-hitter on Indepen
dence Day. Or Roger Clemens
striking out 20 Seattle Mariners.
Rob Deer hitting three homers
with Dale Sveum adding two
more? Are you kidding?
Leading the charge back to
pitching greatness in the
National League are Greg
Maddux, David Cone and Orel
Hershiser. We've seen it before
from Hershiser, the Dodger ace
now that Fernando has mysteri
ously lost his magic.
But from Cone and Maddux it's
truly something special. It's only
the second year in the bigs for
both of them and, if the future
is anything like the present, op
posing batters should be scratch
ing their heads for years to come.
Cone related a story of being
in spring training in 1987 after
being traded from the Kansas City
Royals to the Mets. He knew he'd
have to make a good impression
in a brief period in order to avoid
demotion to Tidewater, the Mets
AAA affiliate. He figured he'd
show off the "Laredo," his
sidearm curveball and trick pitch,
when he got a chance.
That chance came when Cone
faced Jack Clark who was then
with the Cardinals. He threw him
two straight fastballs for strikes.
Then, Cone said, "It was the
Laredo and see you later." Clark
was a "K" victim and Cone earned
a stay with the big club.
Maddux had a rough rookie
season, but this year it's been
smooth sailing. While Cone's 9-2
record and 2.35 earned run
average are impressive, Maddux'
14-3, 2.15 ERA are otherwordly.
Maddux would be a sure bet to
start the All-Star Game were it

not for a scheduled start this
weekend. He should appear in the
contest as a reliever, though.
And by the way, the Houston
Astros' ageless wonder, Nolan
Ryan, is once again leading the
NL in strikeouts. Truly one of
the most incredible athletes of all
time.
In the AL, Roger Clemens is
seeking an unprecedented third
straight Cy Young award. Consid
ering the numbers he's putting
up — a 12-5 record, 2.43 ERA six

shutouts and a 300-plus strikeout
pace — he seems to be right on
track to pull off the hat trick.
But if the voting were done
today, Clemens might be nosed
out by the Twins Frank Viola.
Allowing one-tenth of a run less
than Clemens per game and pos
ting a 14-2 mark, Viola is leading
the Twins charge in the AL West.
Other performances in the AL
that can't be overlooked are the

Stanford ace has struggled so far this season.
awesome save totals of Oakland's
Dennis Eckersley (25), Minneso
ta's Jeff Reardon (23) and
Cleveland's Doug Jones (20).
Doug who? Jones was a jour
neyman minor leagure who finally
managed to stick with the big club
long enough to show his stuff. His
success story is one of those heart
warmers that all baseball fans,
not just Indians' supporters, can
appreciate.
Oh, and by the way, remember
that this was the "Year of the
balk"? Neither did I until I was
recently reminded of it. The ludi
crous crackdown on pitchers
deliveries has slowed quite a bit
from the feverish pace of April.
This "Spring of the Balk" will

soon be just another footnote in
the annals of the game.
Batters are also doing their
share to keep things inter
esting, even without threat
ening Roger Maris' single season
home run record. Slowed by inju
ries, Eric Davis has gone from a
Sporting News cover proclaiming
him "Eric the Great(est)" last
year, to virtual oblivion this
season.
At the same time, Andres
Galarraga, Darryl Strawberry and
Jose Canseco, appear to be estab
lishing themselves as three of the
most feared hitters in the game.
Galarraga ieads the pack with a
.345 batting average, 19 HR, 53
RBI. He's a legitimate Triple
Crown threat and could become
only the third man in history to
have 100 extra base hits in a

single season. Lou Gehrig and
Chuck Klein were the others.
Strawberry (21 HR, 55 RBI)
and Canseco (23 HR, 65 RBI)
strike terror in the hearts of the
opposition and are the hearts of
their respective division-leading
clubs.
Another distant memory from
April is George Steinbrenner's in
sane desire to unload Dave Win
field for a couple pair of socks
and a groundskeeper to be named
later. Winfield is merely hitting
.347 with 15 homers and 62 RBI.
Those are MVP numbers to be
sure.
Up in Boston, a kid named Mike
Greenwell (.342, 14 HR, 65 RBI),
however, is matching Winfield
step for step. Greenwell and Ellis
Burks (.328 batting average)
guarantee Boston will have a
strong outfield long after Jim Rice
is gone. With lifetime .350-plus
hitter Wade Boggs coming in at
.358, the Sox have a chance to
wind up with three .330 hitters.
Awesome.
Lest one forget the Twins Kirby
Puckett. The delightfully enthu
siastic center fielder isn't flashy

— he just produces. Once again
Puckett is among the batting
leaders with a .344 average and
he's also driven in 62 runs.
Okay, so no one's likely to hit
50 homers this season, nor rack
up 145 RBI. But that's alright.
Such feats should be reserved for
exceptional ballplayers having ex
ceptional seasons.
This year, everything is just,
well ... normal.
Perhaps the most disappoint
ing news is on the rookie
front. After being spoiled by
the Jose Cansecos, Mark
McGwires, Ruben Sierras and
Kevin Seitzers of the last few
years, this year is quite a letdown.
In the preseason, former Stan
ford star Jack McDowell was
touted by Sport magazine as the
likely AL Rookie of the Year. At
times this season McDowell has
been lucky to avoid demotion to
the minors.
Grilled on several occasions,
McDowell may have regained the
stellar form he showed last Sep
tember with a strong performance
Wednesday. McDowell allowed

but four hits in eight and one
third innings in defeating the
Orioles and raising his record to
4-6.
At this point the AL Rookie of
the Year spot is vacant with not
a single first-year big leaguer
deserving of the honor.
In the National League, things
are a bit brighter. While Cincin
nati has failed to live up to ex
pectations, Reds rookie third base
man Chris Sabo has gone far be
yond what he was expected to ac
complish.
When Buddy Bell went down
with an injury, Sabo got a chance
to play every day. He made the
most of it, winning the job by
pulling a "Lou Gherig" to Bell's
"Wally Pipp." Bell is now with
the Astros while Sabo has shown
a fine stroke at the plate (.307
batting average) and excellent
speed (24 SB).
With a similar second half, Sabo
should capture top rookie honors
unless . . . Mark "Amazing" Grace
keeps pouring it on in Chicago.
Grace displaced Leon "Bull" Dur
ham — he had the nickname
before the movie — at first base.
This kid makes contact with
nearly every pitch he goes after
and has an incredibly sweet swing.
Grace, Palmeiro and Maddux,
along with Ryne Sandberg and
Shawon Dunston, form the cor
nerstones of a Cubs team that
should contend in the not-too
distant future.
I love the All-Star Game in all
ways but one: The day off on
either end of the exhibition
means two days devoid of any and
all baseball action. But I'll survive
knowing there's a whole half of a
season yet to come.

recently reminded of it. The ludi
crous crackdown on pitchers
deliveries has slowed quite a bit
from the feverish pace of April.
This "Spring of the Balk" will

soon be just another footnote in
the annals of the game.
Batters are also doing their
share to keep things inter
esting, even without threat
ening Roger Maris' single season
home run record. Slowed by inju
ries, Eric Davis has gone from a
Sporting News cover proclaiming
him "Eric the Great(est)" last
year, to virtual oblivion this
season.
At the same time, Andres
Galarraga, Darryl Strawberry and
Jose Canseco, appear to be estab
lishing themselves as three of the
most feared hitters in the game.
Galarraga ieads the pack with a
.345 batting average, 19 HR, 53
RBI. He's a legitimate Triple
Crown threat and could become
only the third man in history to
have 100 extra base hits in a

single season. Lou Gehrig and
Chuck Klein were the others.
Strawberry (21 HR, 55 RBI)
and Canseco (23 HR, 65 RBI)
strike terror in the hearts of the
opposition and are the hearts of
their respective division-leading
clubs.
Another distant memory from
April is George Steinbrenner's in
sane desire to unload Dave Win
field for a couple pair of socks
and a groundskeeper to be named
later. Winfield is merely hitting
.347 with 15 homers and 62 RBI.
Those are MVP numbers to be
sure.
Up in Boston, a kid named Mike
Greenwell (.342, 14 HR, 65 RBI),
however, is matching Winfield
step for step. Greenwell and Ellis
Burks (.328 batting average)
guarantee Boston will have a
strong outfield long after Jim Rice
is gone. With lifetime .350-plus
hitter Wade Boggs coming in at
.358, the Sox have a chance to
wind up with three .330 hitters.
Awesome.
Lest one forget the Twins Kirby
Puckett. The delightfully enthu
siastic center fielder isn't flashy

— he just produces. Once again
Puckett is among the batting
leaders with a .344 average and
he's also driven in 62 runs.
Okay, so no one's likely to hit
50 homers this season, nor rack
up 145 RBI. But that's alright.
Such feats should be reserved for
exceptional ballplayers having ex
ceptional seasons.
This year, everything is just,
well ... normal.
Perhaps the most disappoint
ing news is on the rookie
front. After being spoiled by
the Jose Cansecos, Mark
McGwires, Ruben Sierras and
Kevin Seitzers of the last few
years, this year is quite a letdown.
In the preseason, former Stan
ford star Jack McDowell was
touted by Sport magazine as the
likely AL Rookie of the Year. At
times this season McDowell has
been lucky to avoid demotion to
the minors.
Grilled on several occasions,
McDowell may have regained the
stellar form he showed last Sep
tember with a strong performance
Wednesday. McDowell allowed

but four hits in eight and one
third innings in defeating the
Orioles and raising his record to
4-6.
At this point the AL Rookie of
the Year spot is vacant with not
a single first-year big leaguer
deserving of the honor.
In the National League, things
are a bit brighter. While Cincin
nati has failed to live up to ex
pectations, Reds rookie third base
man Chris Sabo has gone far be
yond what he was expected to ac
complish.
When Buddy Bell went down
with an injury, Sabo got a chance
to play every day. He made the
most of it, winning the job by
pulling a "Lou Gherig" to Bell's
"Wally Pipp." Bell is now with
the Astros while Sabo has shown
a fine stroke at the plate (.307
batting average) and excellent
speed (24 SB).
With a similar second half, Sabo
should capture top rookie honors
unless . . . Mark "Amazing" Grace
keeps pouring it on in Chicago.
Grace displaced Leon "Bull" Dur
ham — he had the nickname
before the movie — at first base.
This kid makes contact with
nearly every pitch he goes after
and has an incredibly sweet swing.
Grace, Palmeiro and Maddux,
along with Ryne Sandberg and
Shawon Dunston, form the cor
nerstones of a Cubs team that
should contend in the not-too
distant future.
I love the All-Star Game in all
ways but one: The day off on
either end of the exhibition
means two days devoid of any and
all baseball action. But I'll survive
knowing there's a whole half of a
season yet to come.

on the gridiron has yet to hit the
headlines.
Today, and for the next few
weeks, its nothing but our na
tional pastime, pure and simple.
With the Midsummer Classic, the
All-Star Game, upon us, let's for
get about all the talk of collusion
among the owners and just savor
the moment.

It's time for baseball to take
center stage. The season is half
over, a natural time to reflect on
what has transpired and to spec
ulate on what's yet to come.
As expected, the New York Mets
and Oakland Athletics are leading
their respective divisions. But not
all has gone according to plan in
the major leagues.
The Detroit Tigers, a team few
gave a chance to repeat, are atop
the American League East. And,
the Minnesota Twins, a team no
one gave a chance to repeat are
clipping the heels of the mighty
Athletics.
Perhaps most shocking of all:
The Los Angeles Dodgers are alive
and well and winning in Chavez
Ravine.
No team has distanced itself far
enough from the field to allow it
to cruise through the second half.
On the flip side, though, with the
exception of the Baltimore
Orioles, Seattle Mariners and At
lanta Braves, no one is completely
out of the race.

Fans in Pittsburgh, Cleveland
and on the north side of Chicago
are delighting in the return of
major league baseball to their
hometowns. The imposters of
recent years no longer don the
uniforms in the clubhouses of the
Pirates, Indians and Cubs. In
stead, the faithful get a chance to
marvel at the genuine article in
the likes of Bobby Bonilla, Joe
Carter and Rafael Palmeiro.
Before the 1987 season, Sports
Illustrated dubbed the Indians the
best team in the American
League. Needless to say, they
weren't.
But the Tribe came out like
gangbusters in 1988 and vaulted
to the top of the AL East. They've
struggled of late, due in large part
to the misfortune that has befal
len Greg Swindell.
Swindell had 10 wins under his
belt by May 30 and hasn't upped
his victory total since. If the gods
of baseball decide to rejuvenate
Swindell during those magical
three days known as the All-Star
break, as they have done for so
many before him, there's still a
chance that Municipal Stadium
will be filled to its capacity of
73,000 come September.
As far as I'm concerned, the
most exciting development
in baseball this year is the
return of pitching. The ridiculous
surge in home runs that made
baseball scores resemble the
tallies from arena football contests
last year is gone and forgotten.
(I think Peter Ueberroth had
the lively ball removed and
thereby created the power short
age. But, whatever the reason, I
don't miss the daily 13-12 games
one bit.)
There's nothing more exciting
than watching two of the league's
best hurlers duel it out in a low
scoring battle. I remember a game
a couple years back where Dwight
Gooden was facing Fernando
Valenzuela. Note that I identify
the game by the pitching
matchup, not by the teams play
ing.

Anyway, in the late innings
Gooden faced a bases loaded, no
out situation and retired the
Dodgers without allowing a run.
In the next inning, Valenzuela
faced the same situation and
couldn't work out of it. Gooden
emerged as the victor.
Classic stuff. The stuff of which
memories are made. Like a Dave
Righetti no-hitter on Indepen
dence Day. Or Roger Clemens
striking out 20 Seattle Mariners.
Rob Deer hitting three homers
with Dale Sveum adding two
more? Are you kidding?
Leading the charge back to
pitching greatness in the
National League are Greg
Maddux, David Cone and Orel
Hershiser. We've seen it before
from Hershiser, the Dodger ace
now that Fernando has mysteri
ously lost his magic.
But from Cone and Maddux it's
truly something special. It's only
the second year in the bigs for
both of them and, if the future
is anything like the present, op
posing batters should be scratch
ing their heads for years to come.
Cone related a story of being
in spring training in 1987 after
being traded from the Kansas City
Royals to the Mets. He knew he'd
have to make a good impression
in a brief period in order to avoid
demotion to Tidewater, the Mets
AAA affiliate. He figured he'd
show off the "Laredo," his
sidearm curveball and trick pitch,
when he got a chance.
That chance came when Cone
faced Jack Clark who was then
with the Cardinals. He threw him
two straight fastballs for strikes.
Then, Cone said, "It was the
Laredo and see you later." Clark
was a "K" victim and Cone earned
a stay with the big club.
Maddux had a rough rookie
season, but this year it's been
smooth sailing. While Cone's 9-2
record and 2.35 earned run
average are impressive, Maddux'
14-3, 2.15 ERA are otherwordly.
Maddux would be a sure bet to
start the All-Star Game were it

not for a scheduled start this
weekend. He should appear in the
contest as a reliever, though.
And by the way, the Houston
Astros' ageless wonder, Nolan
Ryan, is once again leading the
NL in strikeouts. Truly one of
the most incredible athletes of all
time.
In the AL, Roger Clemens is
seeking an unprecedented third
straight Cy Young award. Consid
ering the numbers he's putting
up — a 12-5 record, 2.43 ERA six

shutouts and a 300-plus strikeout
pace — he seems to be right on
track to pull off the hat trick.
But if the voting were done
today, Clemens might be nosed
out by the Twins Frank Viola.
Allowing one-tenth of a run less
than Clemens per game and pos
ting a 14-2 mark, Viola is leading
the Twins charge in the AL West.
Other performances in the AL
that can't be overlooked are the

of baseball decide to rejuvenate
Swindell during those magical
three days known as the All-Star
break, as they have done for so
many before him, there's still a
chance that Municipal Stadium
will be filled to its capacity of
73,000 come September.
As far as I'm concerned, the
most exciting development
in baseball this year is the
return of pitching. The ridiculous
surge in home runs that made
baseball scores resemble the
tallies from arena football contests
last year is gone and forgotten.
(I think Peter Ueberroth had
the lively ball removed and
thereby created the power short
age. But, whatever the reason, I
don't miss the daily 13-12 games
one bit.)
There's nothing more exciting
than watching two of the league's
best hurlers duel it out in a low
scoring battle. I remember a game
a couple years back where Dwight
Gooden was facing Fernando
Valenzuela. Note that I identify
the game by the pitching
matchup, not by the teams play
ing.

Anyway, in the late innings
Gooden faced a bases loaded, no
out situation and retired the
Dodgers without allowing a run.
In the next inning, Valenzuela
faced the same situation and
couldn't work out of it. Gooden
emerged as the victor.
Classic stuff. The stuff of which
memories are made. Like a Dave
Righetti no-hitter on Indepen
dence Day. Or Roger Clemens
striking out 20 Seattle Mariners.
Rob Deer hitting three homers
with Dale Sveum adding two
more? Are you kidding?
Leading the charge back to
pitching greatness in the
National League are Greg
Maddux, David Cone and Orel
Hershiser. We've seen it before
from Hershiser, the Dodger ace
now that Fernando has mysteri
ously lost his magic.
But from Cone and Maddux it's
truly something special. It's only
the second year in the bigs for
both of them and, if the future
is anything like the present, op
posing batters should be scratch
ing their heads for years to come.
Cone related a story of being
in spring training in 1987 after
being traded from the Kansas City
Royals to the Mets. He knew he'd
have to make a good impression
in a brief period in order to avoid
demotion to Tidewater, the Mets
AAA affiliate. He figured he'd
show off the "Laredo," his
sidearm curveball and trick pitch,
when he got a chance.
That chance came when Cone
faced Jack Clark who was then
with the Cardinals. He threw him
two straight fastballs for strikes.
Then, Cone said, "It was the
Laredo and see you later." Clark
was a "K" victim and Cone earned
a stay with the big club.
Maddux had a rough rookie
season, but this year it's been
smooth sailing. While Cone's 9-2
record and 2.35 earned run
average are impressive, Maddux'
14-3, 2.15 ERA are otherwordly.
Maddux would be a sure bet to
start the All-Star Game were it

not for a scheduled start this
weekend. He should appear in the
contest as a reliever, though.
And by the way, the Houston
Astros' ageless wonder, Nolan
Ryan, is once again leading the
NL in strikeouts. Truly one of
the most incredible athletes of all
time.
In the AL, Roger Clemens is
seeking an unprecedented third
straight Cy Young award. Consid
ering the numbers he's putting
up — a 12-5 record, 2.43 ERA six

shutouts and a 300-plus strikeout
pace — he seems to be right on
track to pull off the hat trick.
But if the voting were done
today, Clemens might be nosed
out by the Twins Frank Viola.
Allowing one-tenth of a run less
than Clemens per game and pos
ting a 14-2 mark, Viola is leading
the Twins charge in the AL West.
Other performances in the AL
that can't be overlooked are the

Stanford ace has struggled so far this season.
awesome save totals of Oakland's
Dennis Eckersley (25), Minneso
ta's Jeff Reardon (23) and
Cleveland's Doug Jones (20).
Doug who? Jones was a jour
neyman minor leagure who finally
managed to stick with the big club
long enough to show his stuff. His
success story is one of those heart
warmers that all baseball fans,
not just Indians' supporters, can
appreciate.
Oh, and by the way, remember
that this was the "Year of the
balk"? Neither did I until I was
recently reminded of it. The ludi
crous crackdown on pitchers
deliveries has slowed quite a bit
from the feverish pace of April.
This "Spring of the Balk" will

soon be just another footnote in
the annals of the game.
Batters are also doing their
share to keep things inter
esting, even without threat
ening Roger Maris' single season
home run record. Slowed by inju
ries, Eric Davis has gone from a
Sporting News cover proclaiming
him "Eric the Great(est)" last
year, to virtual oblivion this
season.
At the same time, Andres
Galarraga, Darryl Strawberry and
Jose Canseco, appear to be estab
lishing themselves as three of the
most feared hitters in the game.
Galarraga ieads the pack with a
.345 batting average, 19 HR, 53
RBI. He's a legitimate Triple
Crown threat and could become
only the third man in history to
have 100 extra base hits in a

single season. Lou Gehrig and
Chuck Klein were the others.
Strawberry (21 HR, 55 RBI)
and Canseco (23 HR, 65 RBI)
strike terror in the hearts of the
opposition and are the hearts of
their respective division-leading
clubs.
Another distant memory from
April is George Steinbrenner's in
sane desire to unload Dave Win
field for a couple pair of socks
and a groundskeeper to be named
later. Winfield is merely hitting
.347 with 15 homers and 62 RBI.
Those are MVP numbers to be
sure.
Up in Boston, a kid named Mike
Greenwell (.342, 14 HR, 65 RBI),
however, is matching Winfield
step for step. Greenwell and Ellis
Burks (.328 batting average)
guarantee Boston will have a
strong outfield long after Jim Rice
is gone. With lifetime .350-plus
hitter Wade Boggs coming in at
.358, the Sox have a chance to
wind up with three .330 hitters.
Awesome.
Lest one forget the Twins Kirby
Puckett. The delightfully enthu
siastic center fielder isn't flashy

— he just produces. Once again
Puckett is among the batting
leaders with a .344 average and
he's also driven in 62 runs.
Okay, so no one's likely to hit
50 homers this season, nor rack
up 145 RBI. But that's alright.
Such feats should be reserved for
exceptional ballplayers having ex
ceptional seasons.
This year, everything is just,
well ... normal.
Perhaps the most disappoint
ing news is on the rookie
front. After being spoiled by
the Jose Cansecos, Mark
McGwires, Ruben Sierras and
Kevin Seitzers of the last few
years, this year is quite a letdown.
In the preseason, former Stan
ford star Jack McDowell was
touted by Sport magazine as the
likely AL Rookie of the Year. At
times this season McDowell has
been lucky to avoid demotion to
the minors.
Grilled on several occasions,
McDowell may have regained the
stellar form he showed last Sep
tember with a strong performance
Wednesday. McDowell allowed

but four hits in eight and one
third innings in defeating the
Orioles and raising his record to
4-6.
At this point the AL Rookie of
the Year spot is vacant with not
a single first-year big leaguer
deserving of the honor.
In the National League, things
are a bit brighter. While Cincin
nati has failed to live up to ex
pectations, Reds rookie third base
man Chris Sabo has gone far be
yond what he was expected to ac
complish.
When Buddy Bell went down
with an injury, Sabo got a chance
to play every day. He made the
most of it, winning the job by
pulling a "Lou Gherig" to Bell's
"Wally Pipp." Bell is now with
the Astros while Sabo has shown
a fine stroke at the plate (.307
batting average) and excellent
speed (24 SB).
With a similar second half, Sabo
should capture top rookie honors
unless . . . Mark "Amazing" Grace
keeps pouring it on in Chicago.
Grace displaced Leon "Bull" Dur
ham — he had the nickname
before the movie — at first base.
This kid makes contact with
nearly every pitch he goes after
and has an incredibly sweet swing.
Grace, Palmeiro and Maddux,
along with Ryne Sandberg and
Shawon Dunston, form the cor
nerstones of a Cubs team that
should contend in the not-too
distant future.
I love the All-Star Game in all
ways but one: The day off on
either end of the exhibition
means two days devoid of any and
all baseball action. But I'll survive
knowing there's a whole half of a
season yet to come.

Mark Rogowsky is sports editor

The last jump shot has merci
fully fallen through the net
at the Forum, the final
forehand has sailed beyond the
baseline at the All England Club
and the first touchdown scored
on the gridiron has yet to hit the
headlines.
Today, and for the next few
weeks, its nothing but our na
tional pastime, pure and simple.
With the Midsummer Classic, the
All-Star Game, upon us, let's for
get about all the talk of collusion
among the owners and just savor
the moment.

It's time for baseball to take
center stage. The season is half
over, a natural time to reflect on
what has transpired and to spec
ulate on what's yet to come.
As expected, the New York Mets
and Oakland Athletics are leading
their respective divisions. But not
all has gone according to plan in
the major leagues.
The Detroit Tigers, a team few
gave a chance to repeat, are atop
the American League East. And,
the Minnesota Twins, a team no
one gave a chance to repeat are
clipping the heels of the mighty
Athletics.
Perhaps most shocking of all:
The Los Angeles Dodgers are alive
and well and winning in Chavez
Ravine.
No team has distanced itself far
enough from the field to allow it
to cruise through the second half.
On the flip side, though, with the
exception of the Baltimore
Orioles, Seattle Mariners and At
lanta Braves, no one is completely
out of the race.

Fans in Pittsburgh, Cleveland
and on the north side of Chicago
are delighting in the return of
major league baseball to their
hometowns. The imposters of
recent years no longer don the
uniforms in the clubhouses of the
Pirates, Indians and Cubs. In
stead, the faithful get a chance to
marvel at the genuine article in
the likes of Bobby Bonilla, Joe
Carter and Rafael Palmeiro.
Before the 1987 season, Sports
Illustrated dubbed the Indians the
best team in the American
League. Needless to say, they
weren't.
But the Tribe came out like
gangbusters in 1988 and vaulted
to the top of the AL East. They've
struggled of late, due in large part
to the misfortune that has befal
len Greg Swindell.
Swindell had 10 wins under his
belt by May 30 and hasn't upped
his victory total since. If the gods
of baseball decide to rejuvenate
Swindell during those magical
three days known as the All-Star
break, as they have done for so
many before him, there's still a
chance that Municipal Stadium
will be filled to its capacity of
