AL gets Ripken to replace Trammell
NEW YORK — Five players from the World Series
champion Minnesota Twins were among the Amer
ican League All-Star reserves named yesterday, a
day after no Twins were elected to start.
Pitchers Frank Viola and Jeff Reardon, catcher
Tim Laudner, infielder Gary Gaetti and outfielder

selected by AL President Bobby Brown and Twins
manager Tom Kelly.
Starters Roger Clemens of Boston, Mark Gubicza
of Kansas City, Dave Stieb of Toronto, Doyle Alex
ander of Detroit and Viola made the team.
