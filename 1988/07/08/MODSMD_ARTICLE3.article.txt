# Cowell Cluster braced to survive next quake

### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
While they won't notice any
changes in the appearance of their
residences, students moving into
Cowell Cluster dorms this fall will
live in sturdier, seismically
reinforced structures.
The buildings are currently un
dergoing upgrades designed to
anchor the dorms' ceilings and
floors to their concrete walls more
tightly.
Although a campus-wide survey
conducted this year did not re
quire the improvements, officials
in Facilities Project Management
(FPM) said they decided to go
ahead with the construction to
improve the structural strength
of the buildings The work "is

voluntary, not required," Project
Manager Marji Shaw said.
"1 think the University is just
aware of all the seismic work that
needs to be done" on campus,
Shaw said, adding that Stanford
"is smart enough to do it before
it is a mandate."
The entire project — which
began Tuesday — should continue
through mid-September and re
quire under $400,000 in funds
from the Housing Reserve, ac
cording to Shaw.
liOren construction admin
istrator with FPM, said it is dif
ficult to quantify the benefit of
the improvements because of the
constraints in accurately predict
ing earthquake damages. "We're
shining the car," Lau said.
The general purpose of the con
struction is "to decrease the
likelihood of the failure of the
buildings," according to Fouad
Bendimerad, the University's ad
viser for seismic risk.
According to Bendimerad, the
buildings were erected with a
"tilt-up construction" method,
whereby concrete molds of the
walls are poured and then "tilted
up" and connected to the wooden
ceilings and floors.
In an effort to prevent the walls
from tipping over during an earth
quake, the upgrade uses steel
bolts and metal plates to firmly
tie the walls to the building.
Constructed in 1967, the Cowell
Cluster was built according to the
then Uniform Building Codes.
However, the codes are con
siderably more stringent today,
according to Lau.
"What we have now in the codes
is different than what we knew
in the '605," Lau said. While the
buildings will not be brought up
to today's requirements with the
new improvements, Lau said "the
work will enhance the perform
ance ef the buildings to resist seis
mic occurrences."
Construction will shift between
the various buildings as
conference-goers and students
move into dorms for two week
periods and out again. "We're
doing the work in a sequential
schedule to accommodate the
schedules of the users," Lau said.

Workman Concetto Raiti removes paneling yesterday to make way
for steel braces under a roof overhang at Terra House in the Cowell
Cluster. The seismic upgrading of dorms there should be completed
by mid-September.
