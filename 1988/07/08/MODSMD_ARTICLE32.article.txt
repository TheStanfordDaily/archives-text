# Computer companies urged to invest in labs

In an innovative proposal to facilitate
technology transfer, Stanford will invite lo
cal companies to invest $25 million in new
"minilabs," helping to fund construction
of the Information Sciences Buildings on
the developing Near West Campus.
The minilab proposal will ask five com-

panies with "strong computer interests" to
invest $5 million each in research and in
the construction of new laboratories over
a five-year period. The facilities will connect
Stanford's academic resources to industrial
research by allowing corporate and Uni
versity scientists to work together.
Corporate scientists will be given
$100,000 a year by their sponsoring com
panies to conduct research in the minilabs.
One minilab will consist of at least two

Stanford faculty and at most three corpo
rate scientists.
According to Electrical Engineering Prof.
Gordon Kino, chair of the Committee of
Research, the minilabs will offer a "stable,
long-term source of money for both facil
ities and research" and an answer to dwin
dling government support.
"The government has not given us any
money to improve our facilities in 20
years," Kino said.
Moreover, the minilabs will offer stu
dents a chance to conduct summer research
with both faculty and industry scientists,
he said.
According to Kino, the emphasis of the
minilabs will be on graduate level research,
although there will be a "sprinkling of un
dergrads" involved. The focus of each min
ilab will vary, he said, but most will feature
projects related to computer science.
Although the University has not made
any final decisions on which five companies
will participate, Kino said Hewlett-Packard
and Digital Equipment Corporation are
probable choices.
After their initial five year investment
periods, the companies could still contrib
ute to the minilabs, but the company and
the University would have to sign a con
tractual agreement to do so.
