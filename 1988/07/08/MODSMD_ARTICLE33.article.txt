# Former dean chosen as academic secretary
## 
### Lisa Mackey 
A 70-year-old former dean of the
School of Education has been named the
14th academic secretary of the Univer
sity, replacing Clara Bush who is retir
ing.
Arthur Coladarci's appointment on
June 28 marks the second time this
summer that Stanford has appointed an
official over age 64 to a new post. These

appointments coincide
with the Stanford Board
of Trustees' decision to
ask Hoover Institution
Director W. Glenn
Campbell to retire when
he reaches 65 next year.
The mandatory retire
ment age for executives
at Stanford is 65.
Former University

President Richard Lyman was appointed
to head the new Institute of Interna
tional Relations in early June. Lyman
will turn 65 in October.
Coladarci will take over the adminis
trative role of coordinating the work of
the Stanford Faculty Senate at the start

of the next academic year.
While Coladarci declined to comment
on his age and the controversy surround
ing Campbell's retirement, he empha
sized that he has not always seen himself
as an administrator and that earlier in
his career, he was "coerced into admin
istrative roles" against his best wishes,
he said.
"I used to think that administration
was distracting," said Coladarci, sitting
with his leg propped up and a pipe in
his mouth.
"When they were searching for the
new academic secretary, they were
looking for someone with a weak ego
structure and a very strong death wish
and foolish enough to follow such com
petent people (Clara Bush, Eric Hutchin
son and Donald Winbigler)," he added,
laughing.
Coladarci served as dean of the School
of Education from 1970 to 1978 â€” a
period in which the school was repeatedly
ranked at the top of national surveys.
He has been part of the Stanford faculty
since 1952, graduating from Yale in
1950, with a doctorate in educational
psychology.
