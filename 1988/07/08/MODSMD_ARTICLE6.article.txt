# Hoover may offer Meese a position

U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese 111
might became a "distinguished visiting fel
low" at the Hoover Institution, Hoover Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell said yesterday.
Unknown to University President Donald
Kennedy, Campbell invited the controver
sial attorney general to come discuss an
affiliation with Hoover. As director, Camp
bell has the authority to invite visitors to
use the institution's resources for indeter
minate time periods.
"He and I have been discussing this for
months," Campbell said of the offer.
Meese's press secretary was not available
for comment.
Following a 14-month special prosecu
tor's investigation, Meese announced on
Tuesday that he would resign from his
post as attorney general by early August.
The investigation concluded that there was
no basis for criminal proceedings against
the attorney general.
Admitting that his invitiation to Meese
was "a controversial one," Campbell said
he was regretful the press learned about
the offer before Kennedy. Campbell said
he sent a letter to the president's office
yesterday, announcing his invitation.
In a press statement issued late yesterday
afternoon, Kennedy said a letter dated July
7 informed him of Campell's invitation.
According to Kennedy's statement, all
academic appointments at Hoover must be
reviewed by the University president or
provost and are then subject to the approval
of Stanford's Board of Trustees.
A long-standing critic of the University's
ties to Hoover, Political Science Prof. John

Manley cailed the invitation a "Meese
mess."
"It did not catch me by surpise," Manley
said. "Anticipating Hoover's strength
hardly takes a genius."
Manley has continually charged that
Hoover's conservative practices threaten
Stanford's national reputation. In May, he
and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz sent a
petition to the Faculty Senate, urging the
University to bring Hoover under stricter
academic governance.

ment goes or not, Donald
Kennedy . . . has to stop
playing Reagan roulette with
this University's reputation/
â€” Prof. John Manle\

"Whether Meese's appointment goes or
not, Donald Kennedy . . . has to stop playing
Reagan roulette with this University's rep
utation," Manley said. The offer to Meese
is another example of why the University
must end Hoover's autonomy; otherwise,
Hoover will continue "to smear" Stanford's
image, Manley said.
But Campbell insisted Meese's coming
to Hoover could only benefit the institution.
He pointed to Meese's unique position as
a scholar who could discuss the legacy of
the Reagan Administration while the pres
ident is still in office. Reagan became
Hoover's first honorary fellow
seven years ago.
Campbell said even though it's
beyond his authority to make cur
riculum decisions, he would like
to see Meese teach a class here.
"Since Stanford wants a diver
sity of views, if they could get
him to teach a course here it
would be great in the curricu
lum," he said.
Campbell said he was unsure

and could only hope Meese would
accept an affiliation with Hoover.
According to Campbell, the po
sition of visiting scholar does not
necessarily entail a large time
commitment.
"He could be a distinguished
visiting fellow as long as he visits
occasionally," Campbell said,
noting that Hoover scholars could
benefit by simply talking with
Meese during their coffee breaks.
"All we would be doing here is
having seminars and our famous
afternoon coffee," he said.
