# Nuclear arms policy faces renewed attack
## Scientist still battling launch on warning 
### Mike Horelick 
With the recent failure of a
computer to correctly identify
an Iranian airliner in the Per
sian Gulf, Data Center com
puter scientist Clifford Johnson
said he has new ammunition
to continue his lawsuit against
the U.S. Department of Defense
and the "launch on warning"
nuclear counterattack system.
Johnson has maintained that
the missile detection system —
which relies on computers in
stead of humans to launch a
nuclear retaliatory blow — is
unconstitutional. The Soviet
Union also relies on a comput
erized system.
On June 27, Johnson lost
what was billed as the last ap-

peal of his suit
against former
U.S. Secretary
of Defense
Caspar
Weinberger
before the U.S.
Ninth District
Court of Ap
peals in San
Francisco.

Despite the setback, Johnson
said he will alter his approach
and file a new complaint,
pursuing the case to the U.S.
Supreme Court if possible.
A new complaint would con
tinue Johnson's eight-year bat
tle against the Department of
Defense.
In the June 27 hearing, the
court decided that Johnson did
not have standing to sue as a
potential victim of a nuclear
war, statin*' that the injury

Johnson would receive in an
accidental nuclear war, due to
a failure of the launch on warn
ing system, is "speculative and
non-particular."
Johnson said he is pursuing
the suit because he hopes
federal courts will declare
launch on warning unconstitu
tional and, if necessary, issue
an injunction requiring the
military to stop using comput
erized detection as the sole
source of information in
launching a nuclear coun
terstrike.
According to Johnson,
launch on warning works in a
similar way to the detection
systems on U.S. Navy ships op
erating in the Persian Gulf: in
frared and radar sensors feed
into a computer that deter
mines whether or not the
United States is under attack
from hostile nuclear missies.
Within minutes, a decision
must be made about a nuclear
counterattack.
On Sunday, the U.S. Navy
cruiser Vincennes incorrectly
identified an Iranian passenger
plane as an F-14 using a com
puterized detection system.
Believing the passenger plane
was a hostile jet fighter, the
Vincennes shot down the com
muter plane, killing 290 people.
Johnson started his struggle
in 1983 when the United States
decided to base missies in his
home town of Greenham Com
mon in England.
He has also had experience
with U.S. courts before suing


Johnson
the Defense Department.
Nine years ago, Johsnon sued
the Bank of America for firing
him after he told the corporation
that their computers were was
ting money.
Because he is a British citizen
and cannot vote, Johnson said he
sees the federal courts as his only
channel for fighting the launch
on warning system.
Johnson, who holds a doctorate
in operations research from Sus
sex University in England, said
he recognizes that computers can

be effective in military situations.
However, he does not believe that
100 percent of the information on
an attack (missies are seen only
as blips) should be computer
based.
"I'm not against the use of com
puters," Johnson said. "I'm
against the abuse of computers."
Johnson said he feels the
United States should wait for a
nuclear hit to verify an enemy
attack before launching a coun
terstrike. Although he admits that
precious minutes will be lost and
U.S. missies could be destroyed
on the ground, he said he believes
U.S. attack submarines could ef
fectively retaliate.
