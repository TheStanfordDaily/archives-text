# Pentagon scandal
## Implicated firm has Stanford ties 
### William Kasumi 
Varian Associates, a Palo-Alto
based company with a 50-year his
tory of strong ties to Stanford,
has been brought into question in
a contract corruption scandal cur
rently engulfing the Defense De
partment.
Legal proceedings are underway
to bar Dallas-based Varian Con
tinental Electronics from all fu
ture Navy contracts because of
illegal weapons procurement prac
tices. The firm is a subsidiary of
Varian Associates in Palo Alto.
Varian Associates of Palo Alto
has donated more than $100,000
annually to Stanford over the last
five years in addition to donating
equipment.
Also, the $2.5 million physics
tank on campus is officially
named the Russell H. Varian
Physics Laboratory and was built
largely with proceeds from one of
Prof. Russell Varian's inventions
at Stanford.
Gary Simpson, head of Corpo
rate Communications at Varian
Associates, downplayed the im
pact of the scandal for Stanford
and Varian.
"Right now, there are only al
legations involving an outside con
sultant and one employee at a

branch of the company which was
acquired in 1985. Varian As
sociates had sales last year of $983
million. The defense contract busi
ness at risk is not financially sig
nificant and will not affect our
ties with Stanford," Simpson said.
Dean of the School of Engineer
ing James Gibbons concurred:
"The measures that will be
taken by the Department of De
fense probably will not affect
Varian's relation with Stanford in
the slightest."
In 1935, brothers Russell and
Sigurd Varian worked with
William Hansen of Stanford on
the development of the klystrom
vacuum tube which made possible
radar detection and guidance sys
tems for aircraft.
The Varians, both of whom
were Stanford professors, founded
Varian Adssociates in 1948 and
the company was the first to move
into the Stanford Industrial Park.
Stanford faculty have worked
with Varian Associates on a num
ber of special projects in semicon
ductor processing and in nuclear
physics. The founder of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center,
Edward Ginzcton, was a former
head of Varian Associates and is
now a member of its board of
directors.
