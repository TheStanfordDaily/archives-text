# Land-use plan looks to future
## 
### Jock Friedly 
Trying to cover its bases until
the year 2,000, the University re
leased a land-use report last week
that predicts a 14 percent popu
lation rise at Stanford and an in
crease of 20 percent in building
space by the turn of the century.
The environmental impact
report (EIR) replaces a 1962 land
use report. Complaining that the
old policy was outdated and con
fusing, residents of Palo Alto and
Menlo Park had been calling for
a new one for the past few years.
As a result, Stanford officials
began compiling a new report in
August and finished it last week.
To meet the demands of a larger
population, some of the proposals
in the EIR include a science quad
rangle, more undergraduate
housing and additional athletic fa
cilities, according to University
Planner Charlotte Strem.
Located on the near west side
of campus by the Varian Physics
Tank, the new science quad will
have various integrated science
buildings and special walkways
leading from one building to an
other.
"There will be main pedestrian
and bicycle corridors throughout
[the new quad]," she said, adding
that the new buildings in the quad
will cover over 716,684 square
feet.
The report also calls for the
construction of a new athletic fa
cility on the west side of campus
and the addition of more facilities
on the east side.
The new athletic facilites will
have a pool, tennis courts and a
weight room. In addition, much
of the office space in Old Pavilion
will be converted back into athle
tic facilities as well.
By the year 2,000, more under
graduate housing should also be
available, according to the report.
Although a definite site has not
yet been chosen, the land by Lake
Lagunita or in Manzanita Park
will most likely be allocated for
the housing.
