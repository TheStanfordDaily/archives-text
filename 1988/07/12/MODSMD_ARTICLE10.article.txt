# Democrat Eshoo on environment and government
## 
### David Cline 
Currently serving her second term on
the San Mateo County Board of Super
visors, Democrat Anna Eshoo said she
believes her experience as an elected official
makes her the better candidate in the 12th
Congressional District race.
"I don't just speak about the issues and
take a stand on them," Eshoo said. "I can
point to the fact that I have a record of
demonstrated leadership."
Eshoo is running against Stanford Law
Prof. Tom Campbell. Although he has
worked with national governmental agen
cies, Campbell has never held a local office.
As an example of her leadership, Eshoo
pointed out that she has turned in a
balanced budget each year since 1982 while
she has been a supervisor and has also
helped to design a 24-hour child care facility
for airport workers.
According to Eshoo, her "top priorities"
in Congress would be to maintain a clean
environment and to restore integrity in gov
ernment.
Stressing that the threat of toxic pollu
tion is growing in this area, Eshoo said
the Environmental Protection Agency must
be more effective in cleaning up toxic waste.
"Besides AIDS, toxics is one of the great
public health threats," she said. The 12th
district has some of the most harmful toxic
sights in the country, according to Eshoo.
Eshoo is also looking at corruption in
government. "The system is sick," she said,
referring to recent Defense Department
scandals.
"We need more accountability for dollars
spent," she said. "We need to restore in
tegrity into government."

Eshoo said she wants to improve the
budget process and supports a presidential
line-item veto and the Gramm-Rudman
deficit reduction plan.
"Gramm-Rudman brought about a
ceiling which I do not find unhealthy. There
is nothing wrong with a budget restraint,"
she said.
Like Campbell, Eshoo opposes across
the-board tax increases and would support
an increase in excise taxes on tobacco. She
acknowledged, however, that excise taxes
alone can not balance the budget.
For Eshoo, another key national issue is
providing assistance for the family.
"I understand the problems facing
families today," said Eshoo — a mother of
two.
