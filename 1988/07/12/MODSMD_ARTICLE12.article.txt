# Gorbachev proposes removing air bases
## 
### 
WARSAW - The Soviet Un
ion would be willing to remove
its air bases from Eastern Eu
rope if NATO forces would call
off plans to base F-16 fighter
bombers in Italy, Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev said yester
day.
Gorbachev made the pro
posal in a speech to the Polish
Parliament as he began a six
day trip to Poland. Departing
from his prepared text, he also
suggested informal talks with
Western powers — a sort of
European summit — in order
to find a way to break the im
passe in negotiations on a con
ventional arms agreement.
"I would like to state," Gor
bachev said, "that if (the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization)
shows such readiness, we can
discuss the problem of the lack
of balance (in conventional
forces) before the start of offi

cial talks about the data con
cerning troops."
The two sides have had 24
rounds of talks on the issue in
Vienna but have never agreed
on a formula to establish the
size of their respective military
forces in Europe. Western ne
gotiators say that Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact forces far out
number the NATO forces.
Gorbachev repeated a Soviet
proposal for an initial with
drawal of 500,000 troops on
each side, followed by further
talks and an exchange of data
on the number of troops
deployed by each side.
In Brussels, NATO
Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner issued a statement in
dicating skepticism about the
Gorbachev proposal on the
U.S.-built F-16s.
