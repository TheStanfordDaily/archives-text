# Pennsylvania governor tapped
## New attorney general named 
### 
WASHINGTON - President
Reagan has chosen former Penn
sylvania Gov. Richard
Thornburgh, a one-time federal
prosecutor from the moderate
wing of the Republican Party, to
replace Edwin Meese 111 as attor
ney general, senior White House
officials said Monday.
Thornburgh was expected to
meet with Reagan Tuesday to con
fer with him about the job, said
the officials, who added the deci
sion to nominate the Pennsyl
vanian had been all-but-officially
made.
If confirmed quickly by the Sen
ate, as expected, Thornburgh
would have barely six months to
serve as the nation's top law en
forcement officer, unless Vice
President George Bush wins the
presidency in November and
decides to keep him in the post.
Thornburgh, who is director of
the Institute of Politics at Har
vard University's John F. Ken
nedy School of Government, was

on vacation at Cape Cod, Mass.,
and was unavailable for comment,
his office said. White House offi
cials said that Thornburgh had
indicated that he would accept the
post.
Meese announced his resigna
tion a week ago, declaring that
he had been "completely vind
icated" by the as-yet-unreleased
report by independent counsel
James McKay on his investigation
into allegations about Meese's af
fairs.
The White House has been mov
ing quickly to find a successor to
finally quell the controversy that
has surrounded Meese's legal
troubles.
Thornburgh, who will turn 56
on Saturday, has a reputation as
an aggressive prosecutor who
served as the assistant attorney
general in charge of the criminal
division in the Ford administra
tion. His nomination can be ex
pected to move smoothly through
the Senate confirmation process.

Senate and White House officials
said, avoiding the embarrassing
confirmation fight triggered by
several previous Reagan appoin
tees such as Judge Robert Bork,
who was rejected for a Supreme
Court seat last year.
Avoiding controversy was a top
priority in this selection, White
House officials said.
They said they hope the Senate
Judiciary Committee staff can
begin its initial review of the nom
inee during the legislative recess
for the Democratic National Con
vention next week.
"I think he would be confirmed
very quickly" and would be "an
excellent attorney general," said
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a com
mittee member. He said White
House counsel A.B. Culvahouse
called him Monday morning to
clear Thornburgh's name with
him.
