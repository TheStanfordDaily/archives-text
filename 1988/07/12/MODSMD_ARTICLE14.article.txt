Two left after Mexican election
MEXICO CITY — Five days after the polls
closed, one major candidate conceded defeat yes
terday in Mexico's bitter presidential race, leaving
two others to fight it out.
Conservative Manuel Clouthier, candidate of
the National Action Party, told reporters, "I can
not affirm I have the victory." But Clouthier,
who said that the vote was riddled with fraud,
said that he was still uncertain about who did win.
"For the life of me, I can't say which of the
other contenders obtained the majority of votes,"
the flamboyant businessman from Sinaloa said.
"It's like we have been playing with a deck of
marked cards."
Still in the running, and both claiming victory,
are the government candidate Carlos Salinas de
Gortari and the leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.
Government figures made public Monday
showed Salinas to be widening his lead. As word
of this spread, Mexicans took to the streets for

scattered protests across the country.
In returns announced just before dawn, the
Federal Electoral Commmission gave Salinas al
most 53 percent of the vote, with 70 percent of
the total vote counted.
Prince to leave Cambodian Gov't
BANGKOK, Thailand (DPA) — Prince
Norodom Sihanouk in a surprise move yesterday
announced his resignation as head of an anti-
Vietnamese tripartite Cambodian government-in
exile, only two weeks before he was due to take
part in informal talks aimed at ending the Cam
bodia crisis.
The prince said he had "serious reasons" for
stepping down for the second time this year but
did not elaborate. He said he would go into exile
in France.
