## Wait to invite Meese 
### 
Doubt surrounds
his behavior

IT IS TOO early in the
game to invite Edwin
Meese 111 to come to the
Hoover Institution.
The attorney general
claims the failure of special
prosecutor James McKay to
serve him with a criminal
indictment shows ne has
been "completely vind
icated" of any wrongdoing
as head of the Department
of Justice.
Certainly it's true that
Meese may be found totally
innocent of the numerous al
legations of political and
ethical misconduct, but the
final report of the special
prosecutor, who has been in
vestigating him for almost
a year, has not yet been re
leased to the public or
Meese.
And until this report is
released and Meese truly is
vindicated, it is improper for
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell to offer Meese a
position as a visiting fellow
at the Hoover Institution.
Aren't Hoover scholars ex
pected to be honest and
upright individuals, with
ethically exemplary behav
ior? If they are, and surely
Campbell would agree, then
he should at least wait to
get the facts about Meese
before offering him a posi
tion.

And the fact is, an em
barrassing cloud of im
propriety has surrounded
Meese ever since his stormy
confirmation, leaving many
in doubt of his character.
Meese's inept handling of
the Iran-Contra investiga
tion allowed crucial docu
ments to be shredded, and
his involvement in an Iraqi
pipeline project with friend
and adviser E. Robert Wal
lach was highly unethical if
not criminal.
Numerous conflicts in
Meese's testimony to the
special prosecutor further
erode his credibility, yet
Meese remains unapologetic
and proclaims "complete
vindication."
Ironically, National
Public Radio, citing un
named sources, said the of
fice of the special prosecutor
had informed Meese's
lawyers that they could have
prosecuted him on two
felony charges but decided
not to do so.
A former attorney general
would undeniably provide
insightful and valuable his
torical perspective for the
Hoover Institution, and
Campbell has the right to
ask whomever he considers
suitable to become a visiting
scholar.
But until the special pros
ecutor's report is released,
and Meese is cleared not
only of criminal wrong
doing but of ethical and po
litical misconduct as well,
the invitation is premature.
