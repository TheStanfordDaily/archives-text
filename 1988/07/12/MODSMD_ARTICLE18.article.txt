## On acceptable addictions 
### 
ADDICTIONS: everyone has
at least one. We've all heard
about the bad ones: alcohol,
gambling, food, drugs, to name a
few.
But what about the acceptable
addictions? These are the ones
that really sneak up on us because
on the surface they seem so harm
less, worry-free, sometimes
trivial.
Take daytime soap operas.
("Please!" some people might
say.) Masterpiece Theatre they
are not, but regardless of what
we think of them, they are a na
tional addiction.
Obviously someone out there is
addicted because these "daytime
dramas" are on not just once a
week, but five days a week, some
of them for more than twenty
years. A lot of people can't even
put up with their spouses for that
long!
Addiction is also true for credit
cards. You know it's a problem
when you have your own 800
number so the credit card com
panies can call you.
I've witnessed people getting
their credit cards cut in half for
one reason or another. You'd
think the sales clerk was destroy
ing a birth certificate, a vital or
gan, or some other affirmation of

life, judging by the subsequent
trauma.
Yes, the good old plastic is nec
essary for identification, charging
tickets, or emergencies, but it gets
to be a bit much to see people
charging 30-cent phone calls left
and right.
Of course one can always be
original and pay cash.
"But cash is easy to steal. Credit
cards are safer." We've all heard
that before.
I don't know about you, but I
wouldn't exactly feel safe if I was
lying awake at night wondering
if those carbons I forgot to take
back during my credit card shop
ping spree might be stolen from
a back-street garbage can by a
couch-potato named Mathilda who
then used the numbers to order
important items such as gut
busters, Ginsu knives and tapes
proving Elvis really is alive.
I guess the scary and addicting
part about credit cards is think
ing: "The sky's the limit." At least
cash is reality. It most certainly
can bring one right back down to
earth.
Finally, there's this addiction
to youth. "What's wrong with
youth?" a lot of people might say.
Nothing, except it seems to be
the panacea for our culture.

Judging from all the beer com
mercials on television, no one over
the age of 30 in America drinks
beer.
Sure, and Dick Clark has never
gotten a gray hair in his life.
It can get to be a real problem
when we confuse youth with
health or happiness. But don't tell
plastic surgeons that.
For most people I know, the
thought of living in a nursing
home seems as foreign as a visit
to the Kremlin. As much as it is
pushed in the back of our minds,
it is a reality affecting millions of
people. It just won't happen to
any of us, right?
Maybe no one likes to admit
certain addictions, but like I said,
some of them are really easy to
get away with in this day and age.
The hard part is wondering if we
can live without them.
