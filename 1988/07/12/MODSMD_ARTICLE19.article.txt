## Supporting Contras doesn't uphold cause of democracy 
### 
ROBERT COHN'S defense
of U.S. policy in Nicara
gua (July 6) rested on
some shaky premises.
Both sides in the Nicaraguan
war have undoubtedly commit
ted atrocities, as he claims, but
the "reliable reporter" he cites
happens to work for the Na
tional Forum Foundation, which
supports aid to the Contras.
Every reputable human rights

organization has testified that
the Contras commit far more
acts of deliberate brutality than
the Sandinistas. Documented
cases describe rape, torture,
even disembowelment by the
Contras, in addition to kidnap
ping and the wanton killing of
thousands of civilians.
Common sense should tell us
that continued U.S. financing of
these activities can have no

desirable outcome. Cohn, how
ever, argues that support for
the Contras is justified because
"you cannot always afford a
puristic attitude toward allies
and still survive." And he adds:
"One must maintain faith in
the long-range wonderful cause
of democracy and freedom." But
he doesn't tell us how a country
of 3 million desperately poor
people, half of whom are

children, threatens the survival
of the United States. Nor does
he explain how support for the
torturers and killers of the
Somoza dictatorship can, by any
stretch of the imagination, fur
ther the cause of democracy
and freedom.
