# What constitutes a real conservative?
## 
### 
The Hoover Institution prob
lem has been aired both locally
and in the New York Times.
What is at the heart of this
conflict?
Conservatism has nothing to
do with Republican party
politics, or with extremism used
for financial profit and gain of
political power. But we all know
that some of America's most
unethical and selfish public
figures claim to be "conserva
tive" when they are merely
power-seeking cliques or fac
tions.
The true conservative is first
of all moral and unselfish and
patriotic, in the sense that he,

due to his high position in life,
will fight for those deserving
Americans who are victims of
injustice.
He fights for conservative
concepts and precepts that
preserve the individual; his fam
ily; his religion; his institutions;
his laws; his cultural advances;
in a civilized, humane, moral,
society. If he does not, he
knows in time chaos will result
to all that which was gained for
the good of his culture and
civilization.
Herbert Hoover clearly was
not a true conservative, because
he failed to conserve American
basic moral standards to prevent
and recoup the crash of 1929.
In fact, Franklin D. Roosevelt
was more conservative, because
he saved American self-respect

and patriotic love of country
