# Change freshmen advising system
## 
### 
When demand increases so
suddenly, as in the case of more
frosh coming in the fall than
we anticipated, it is sometimes
hard to meet the challenge. So,
it was good to hear that the
Undergraduate Housing Center
is prepared for the "frosh
onslaught."
However, I hope that this
increased load will not delay
needed innovations in the frosh
advising system. Some aspects

of advising need rethinking and
fresh change. In fact, perhaps
this period, with more advisors
than usual and maybe more ad
hoc departures in the advising
system, is a good time to begin
real change for the future.
