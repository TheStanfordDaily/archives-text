## Blood, sweat and tears fill summer language studies 
### Heather Goodspeed 
They're everywhere: the Quad,
Tresidder, even in University res
idences. They mumble to them
selves, carry tapes bound with
rubber bands and spend hours
daily in a laboratory with ear
phones.
Among the ranks of the Green
Berets of language learning, they
are participants in Stanford's in
tensive summer language pro
grams.
During the summer session
Stanford offers a variety of inten
sive language programs for those
students ambitious — or masoc
histic — enough to compress a
year of a language into eight
weeks. Nearly 200 students from
universities around the nation
pay between $2,000 and $3,500
for a summer scramble to lan
guage proficiency.
Each department takes a differ
ent tack to fluency. Classes in
African languages such as Chava-
Kivunjo and Hausa emphasize
speaking skills and the link be
tween language and culture. Asian

languages, however, stress
reading, memorization, writing
and composition at the expense
of cultural awareness.
Director of the African Studies
Department William Leben ex
plained that students have to
learn about Hausa culture as well
as grammar and syntax to under
stand the language completely. "It
is is a language inseparable from
culture. This is truer for African
languages than for European."
"There's real communication,"
he said. "Instead of spending time
on meaningless drills."
But no matter how faculty pack
age the courses, the reality re
mains: students have only eight
weeks to learn three quarters of
a language.
"It's initially very scary," said
Mark Csikszen, a student in first
year Japanese. "But it's taught
very well."
Csikszen belongs to the cadre
of students who will memorize,
drill and converse their way
through a year's worth of lan
guage study this summer.
When asked his opinion of first

year Chinese, one student
summed it up in a word: "anx
iety." David Miller, course TA for
second-year Chinese, hurried to
say that students shouldn't get
nervous despite the "grueling" na
ture of the course. After all, anx
iety attacks make four hours of
Chinese every morning all the
more difficult to take.
Louise Freeman, secretary for
the Italian department, gave a
sunnier view of the language pro
grams. "It's very positive to see
the students so positive. The
people are very keen on what they
are learning and really want an
intensive course of study."
Instructors said they relish
teaching the summer programs
because of the prodigious dedica
tion of the students and the inti
macy of the classes. Class sizes
range from three in Beginning
Hausa to 21 students in first-year
Chinese.
"I like to teach class as one big
family," said Lioba Moshi, who
teaches Chava-Kivunjo.

Certainly, members of some
classes spend as much (or more)
time together as any family.
Greeting each other when instruc
tion begins at eight or nine o'clock
in the morning, students often eat
meals together to improve their
conversational skills.
The tension inherent to such a
lifestyle seems especially distaste
ful during the summer, but many
students said the extra stress and
extra dollars are worth it. Several
Stanford students are preparing
for the overseas center in
Florence. Ann Tucker, a geology
in the first-year Spanish
program, will be attending the Na
tional Outdoor Leadership School
in Mexico City this fall. Moshi

said some of her Chaga-Kivunjo
students have immediate plans for
research or missionary work.
Academic diversity is another
feature of the summer language
programs. Medical students, en
gineers, biologists and linguists
study together are taking ac
celerated courses for a range of
academic or career goals, from
writing a dissertation to living and
working abroad.
Cultural activities outside of
class relieve the frenzy of learning
a language in such a short time.
Once a week the Japanese stu
dents enjoy a noodle lunch that
requires only an appetite for
foreign cuisine and a tongue for
Asian dispatch.
"There's also talk to have Chi
nese video tapes of current TV
movies. ... I'm pushing for that."
Hausa teacher Abdullahi Ba

ture said he incorporates cultural
songs into his classes — time per
mitting.
But time doesn't always permit.
"There's no time to play around,"
insists Hiroshi Sakamoto, senior
lecturer in Japanese and director

'There's no time to
play around.'

of the summer Asian Languages
program. Miller admits "that
some things don'i sink in and a
student will forget what he has
learned. You can't replace time
with intensity ... but the course

will give him the basics which, if
he ever studies again, will come
back to him."
Theoretically, all students in be
ginning courses are equal when
they arrive, but some are more
equal than others, according to
Sakamoto. Sakamoto explained
that students with a knowledge
of Korean already have an under
standing of basic Japanese syntax.
Sakamoto, who patrols the
aisles between desks shouting
"Memorize! Memorize!," often
quotes a Japanese proverb:
"The more you suffer, the more
you can learn."
According to Sakamoto, The
United States' quest for "an
easier way" is self-defeating when
it comes to the "painful hours"
of study necessary to master a
language as difficult as Japanese.
Susan Reinhold is witness to

many of these "painful hours."
Reinhold, a 1988 Stanford gradu
ate, works in the Language Lab.
"The Chinese students are just
amazing. They're a lot more in
tense than anyone else. ... I
wonder who struck the fear of
God in them."
Moshi said she hopes her stu
dents learn "that what is learned
in the classroom translates into
real life."
One of her former pupils, she
mentioned, now teachos French
and English in Nigeria. Another
student went to Africa after taking
first-year Chava-Kivunjo and was
fluent after a one month immer
sion in the culture.
"Teaching language is like
building a house, you must put
one brick at a time, slowly, pain
fully, and then the whole struc
ture. ... Decoration comes later."

"Teaching language is like
building a house, you must put
one brick at a time, slowly, pain

They're everywhere: the Quad,
Tresidder, even in University res
idences. They mumble to them
selves, carry tapes bound with
rubber bands and spend hours
daily in a laboratory with ear
phones.
Among the ranks of the Green
Berets of language learning, they
are participants in Stanford's in
tensive summer language pro
grams.
During the summer session
Stanford offers a variety of inten
sive language programs for those
students ambitious — or masoc
histic — enough to compress a
year of a language into eight
weeks. Nearly 200 students from
universities around the nation
pay between $2,000 and $3,500
for a summer scramble to lan
guage proficiency.
Each department takes a differ
ent tack to fluency. Classes in
African languages such as Chava-
Kivunjo and Hausa emphasize
speaking skills and the link be
tween language and culture. Asian

languages, however, stress
reading, memorization, writing
and composition at the expense
of cultural awareness.
Director of the African Studies
Department William Leben ex
plained that students have to
learn about Hausa culture as well
as grammar and syntax to under
stand the language completely. "It
is is a language inseparable from
culture. This is truer for African
languages than for European."
"There's real communication,"
he said. "Instead of spending time
on meaningless drills."
But no matter how faculty pack
age the courses, the reality re
mains: students have only eight
weeks to learn three quarters of
a language.
"It's initially very scary," said
Mark Csikszen, a student in first
year Japanese. "But it's taught
very well."
Csikszen belongs to the cadre
of students who will memorize,
drill and converse their way
through a year's worth of lan
guage study this summer.
When asked his opinion of first

year Chinese, one student
summed it up in a word: "anx
iety." David Miller, course TA for
second-year Chinese, hurried to
say that students shouldn't get
nervous despite the "grueling" na
ture of the course. After all, anx
iety attacks make four hours of
Chinese every morning all the
more difficult to take.
Louise Freeman, secretary for
the Italian department, gave a
sunnier view of the language pro
grams. "It's very positive to see
the students so positive. The
people are very keen on what they
are learning and really want an
intensive course of study."
Instructors said they relish
teaching the summer programs
because of the prodigious dedica
tion of the students and the inti
macy of the classes. Class sizes
range from three in Beginning
Hausa to 21 students in first-year
Chinese.
"I like to teach class as one big
family," said Lioba Moshi, who
teaches Chava-Kivunjo.

Certainly, members of some
classes spend as much (or more)
time together as any family.
Greeting each other when instruc
tion begins at eight or nine o'clock
in the morning, students often eat
meals together to improve their
conversational skills.
The tension inherent to such a
lifestyle seems especially distaste
ful during the summer, but many
students said the extra stress and
extra dollars are worth it. Several
Stanford students are preparing
for the overseas center in
Florence. Ann Tucker, a geology
in the first-year Spanish
program, will be attending the Na
tional Outdoor Leadership School
in Mexico City this fall. Moshi

said some of her Chaga-Kivunjo
students have immediate plans for
research or missionary work.
Academic diversity is another
feature of the summer language
programs. Medical students, en
gineers, biologists and linguists
study together are taking ac
celerated courses for a range of
academic or career goals, from
writing a dissertation to living and
working abroad.
Cultural activities outside of
class relieve the frenzy of learning
a language in such a short time.
Once a week the Japanese stu
dents enjoy a noodle lunch that
requires only an appetite for
foreign cuisine and a tongue for
Asian dispatch.
"There's also talk to have Chi
nese video tapes of current TV
movies. ... I'm pushing for that."
Hausa teacher Abdullahi Ba

ture said he incorporates cultural
songs into his classes — time per
mitting.
But time doesn't always permit.
"There's no time to play around,"
insists Hiroshi Sakamoto, senior
lecturer in Japanese and director

of the summer Asian Languages
program. Miller admits "that
some things don'i sink in and a
student will forget what he has
learned. You can't replace time
with intensity ... but the course

will give him the basics which, if
he ever studies again, will come
back to him."
Theoretically, all students in be
ginning courses are equal when
they arrive, but some are more
equal than others, according to
Sakamoto. Sakamoto explained
that students with a knowledge
of Korean already have an under
standing of basic Japanese syntax.
Sakamoto, who patrols the
aisles between desks shouting
"Memorize! Memorize!," often
quotes a Japanese proverb:
"The more you suffer, the more
you can learn."
According to Sakamoto, The
United States' quest for "an
easier way" is self-defeating when
it comes to the "painful hours"
of study necessary to master a
language as difficult as Japanese.
Susan Reinhold is witness to

many of these "painful hours."
Reinhold, a 1988 Stanford gradu
ate, works in the Language Lab.
"The Chinese students are just
amazing. They're a lot more in
tense than anyone else. ... I
wonder who struck the fear of
God in them."
Moshi said she hopes her stu
dents learn "that what is learned
in the classroom translates into
real life."
One of her former pupils, she
mentioned, now teachos French
and English in Nigeria. Another
student went to Africa after taking
first-year Chava-Kivunjo and was
fluent after a one month immer
sion in the culture.
