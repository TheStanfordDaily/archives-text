## Blood, sweat and tears fill summer language studies 
### Heather Goodspeed 
They're everywhere: the Quad,
Tresidder, even in University res
idences. They mumble to them
selves, carry tapes bound with
rubber bands and spend hours
daily in a laboratory with ear
phones.
Among the ranks of the Green
Berets of language learning, they
are participants in Stanford's in
tensive summer language pro
grams.
During the summer session
Stanford offers a variety of inten
sive language programs for those
students ambitious — or masoc
histic — enough to compress a
year of a language into eight
weeks. Nearly 200 students from
universities around the nation
pay between $2,000 and $3,500
for a summer scramble to lan
guage proficiency.
Each department takes a differ
ent tack to fluency. Classes in
African languages such as Chava-
Kivunjo and Hausa emphasize
speaking skills and the link be
tween language and culture. Asian

languages, however, stress
reading, memorization, writing
and composition at the expense
of cultural awareness.
Director of the African Studies
Department William Leben ex
plained that students have to
learn about Hausa culture as well
as grammar and syntax to under
stand the language completely. "It
is is a language inseparable from
culture. This is truer for African
languages than for European."
"There's real communication,"
he said. "Instead of spending time
on meaningless drills."
But no matter how faculty pack
age the courses, the reality re
mains: students have only eight
weeks to learn three quarters of
a language.
"It's initially very scary," said
Mark Csikszen, a student in first
year Japanese. "But it's taught
very well."
Csikszen belongs to the cadre
of students who will memorize,
drill and converse their way
through a year's worth of lan
guage study this summer.
When asked his opinion of first

year Chinese, one student
summed it up in a word: "anx
iety." David Miller, course TA for
second-year Chinese, hurried to
say that students shouldn't get
nervous despite the "grueling" na
ture of the course. After all, anx
iety attacks make four hours of
Chinese every morning all the
more difficult to take.
Louise Freeman, secretary for
the Italian department, gave a
sunnier view of the language pro
grams. "It's very positive to see
the students so positive. The
people are very keen on what they
are learning and really want an
intensive course of study."
Instructors said they relish
teaching the summer programs
because of the prodigious dedica
tion of the students and the inti
macy of the classes. Class sizes
range from three in Beginning
Hausa to 21 students in first-year
Chinese.
"I like to teach class as one big
family," said Lioba Moshi, who
teaches Chava-Kivunjo.
