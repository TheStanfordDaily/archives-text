# ...hits lively chords at Frost

For 5,600 fans at Frost Amphitheater Saturday, a
balmy summer afternoon became all the more pleasant
when the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band set foot on the
simple white stage and spun a captivating two-hour
web of music.
Sponsored by the Stanford Concert Network the
performance highlighted Garcia's solo works on acoustic
guitar mixing nicely with the tranquil mood of an
uncharacteristically mellow audience.
In fact, not until Garcia walked on stage did the
crowd rise above the heat-inspired languor of the af
ternoon. Hot Tuna, the opening act acoustic duo, played
an extremely enjoyable and relaxing first set, drawing
the spectators' appreciative applause though not bring

ing them to their feet.
Garcia and company changed this in a hurry. The
first notes of "Deep Elem Blue" sent a charge through
the audience that sustained an overwhelming enthusi-i
asm clear through to the set's last song, the perennially
popular "Ripple." 4
