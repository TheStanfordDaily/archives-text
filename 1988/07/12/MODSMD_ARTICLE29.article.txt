## Wheaton leaves Stanford to turn pro 
### 
Freshman tennis sensation Da
vid Wheaton, who helped lead
Stanford to an NCAA title this
year, is turning professional and
will not be returning for his soph
omore year.
Wheaton, out of Excelsior,
Minn., was good enough to play
No.l or No. 2 singles throughout
the year for the Cardinal and was
even ranked as high as No. 2 in
the nation by the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Assocication at
one point.

Still, he never seemed com
pletely comfortable on the court.
Many sensed he treated college
tennis as a stopgap to an eventual
pro career.
That eventuality has arrived.
The loss of Wheaton means that
the doubles team of Wheaton and
junior Jeff Tarango, once ranked
as high as No. 3, is no longer.
The ITCA also honored
Tarango and freshman phenom
Tami Whitlinger as the national
"Players to Watch" and named
June graduate Kay Tittle, who
played through countless injuries,
as the "Unsung Hero."
Tittle's gritty play was in
strumental in leading the Stan
ford women's team to three
straight NCAA titles.

Muster reports to
Bears' training camp
Brad Muster, one of the finest
running backs in Stanford his
tory, reported to the Chicago
Bears' rookie camp Thursday.
Muster skipped the team's
mini-camp in May on the advice
of his agent.
Describing his decision to skip
the mini-camp, Muster said, "The
negotiations weren't along far
enough ... So that put me in a
tough position. I wanted to be
here, but at the same time, if I
got hurt, I wasn't doing myself
any good. Now there are some
guarantees in case I slip out
there."
Card to host women's
hoops regional in '89
Stanford University was recom
mended as one of four host schools
for an NCAA Regional in women's
basketball in the 1989-90 season.
Though technically still subject
to approval by the NCAA Execu
tive Committee, Associate Athle
tic Director Cheryl Levick said she
is "extremely confident" it will be
approved when the commitee
meets August 15 and 16.
"We are very pleased to be host
ing an event of such magnitude,
especially in a year in which we
expect our women's basketball
team to be so competitive," Levick
said. She noted that Stanford's
dynamic backcourt duo of Jenni

fer Azzi and Sonja Henning will
be in their senior and junior sea
sons respectively at the time.
Stanford's 'M' team
shines at Santa Clara
Jay Mortenson, Sean Murphy,
Pablo Morales and Anthony Mosse
all made their presence felt at the
Visa International swim meet at
the Santa Clara International
Swim Center this past weekend.
Mortenson, a senior, broke a 16-
year-old meet record Friday in the
100-meter butterfly with a time

of 54.74 to nose out former team
mates Morales and Mosse.
On Saturday, Murphy broke an
other meet record. The All-
American swam the 200-meter
backstroke in 2:03.30.
Sunday, Mosse snatched a vic
tory in the 200-meter butterfly
with a 1:59.84. Morales finished
a disappointing eighth in the con
solation finals with a 2:09.12.
Murphy also took the 100-meter
backstroke in 55.74, the third
fastest time in the world this
season.
