## Concert draws drug busts 
### Eric Richardson Editorial staff 
Some 5,600 concert goers were back in the
high life this weekend at the Jerry Garcia
concerts in Frost Amphitheater, which police
say were sprinkled with the "usual handful"
of drug dealings and arrests for illegal sub
stance use and possession.
Most of the drug-related activity occured on
Saturday, police said, when they made two
arrests for drug sales and handled five other
drug-related incidents in the area of Frost
between 2:50 p.m. and 6:15 p.m. Saturday's
concert began at 2 p.m. and lasted for about
three hours.
Harvard sophomore Adam Koppel, who says
he enrolled as a Stanford summer student to
"experience California Dead shows," said the
"drug-scene was low" both Saturday and Sun
day.
"Sure a dude was selling drugs right next
to me but it was a real mellow atmosphere,"
said Koppel, a veteran of 12 Dead shows.
Police said one person was arrested for pos
sessing and selling LSD and other illegal drugs
at 3 p.m. just outside of Frost. They reported
two other arrests for possession and sale of
drug paraphenalia later that afternoon.
At 5:15 p.m., officers seized a small bag of
marijuana and arrested a concert goer for the
"selling and inhaling of illegal substances."
