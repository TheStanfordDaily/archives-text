# Research breakthrough helps to fight leukemia

Prof. Irving Weissman recently
announced an important ad
vance in bone marrow research
that improves chances for sur
viving leukemia, radiation and
post-chemotherapy sickness
and disorders of the blood and
immune system.
The achievement, which has
eluded scientists for 30 years,
could help patients better ac
cept bone marrow transplants.
Bone marrow transplanta
tion provides a fresh source of
blood and immune cells to a
person whose own marrow is
damaged or diseased, Weis
sman said.
A special cell type known as
a "stem cell" produces and
replaces short-lived blood and
immune cells and is crucial to
successful bone marrow trans
plants. For every 2,000 bone
marrow cells, there is only one
stem cell.
In the past, isolating stem
cells from other marrow cells

was difficult because the dif
ferent marrow cell types are
indistinguishable.
But Weissman's team has de
veloped successful methods for
isolating and purifying stem
cells in mice.
Now the team is working to
apply this technique to
humans. And they are well on
their way, Weissman said.
Once scientists purify human
stem cells and grow them in
the laboratory, bone marrow
transplantation will become
safer — and greater numbers
of patients could undergo suc
cessful transplants, Weissman
said.
Although he praised the
"good environment for re
search" at Stanford, Weissman
said he regretted that his
team's research was slowed
down by across-the-board
budget cuts for basic research.
According to Weissman, oppo
sition to the building of an ad
equate mouse research facility
at Stanford has also delayed
research.
