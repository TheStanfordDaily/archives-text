# Layoffs at SLAC spark USW outcry
## 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
Representatives from the
United Stanford Workers union
announced yesterday that they
will hold an open protest July 19
in support of union workers re
cently laid off at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator.
Five workers recently released
from their work at SLAC will send
a letter to University President
Donald Kennedy this week pro
testing Stanford's policies toward
union employees.
The upcoming protest will focus
on the recent SLAC layoffs as well
as the University's policies of job
shopping, and allocating union
jobs to labor from other compan
ies.
The protest comes in the midst
of increasing union discontent
about the University's alleged in
sensitivity toward labor concerns.
According to USW Representa
tive Reuben Serna, a major issue
the union will protest is the un
steady position of job-shoppers —
non-union workers hired on a
temporary basis who are not

protected by union wage-scales,
pensions and bargaining proce
dures.
According to Serna, there are
250 to 300 job-shoppers holding
positions that could be union jobs.
Many job-shoppers, initially

cause' under current

hired on a temporary basis, have
been at SLAC six or seven years,
Serna said, adding that they can
be "hired and fired at random
without just cause" under current
policy.
"We are not against the job
shoppers. We would like to make
them part of the union," Serna
said.
Another USW complaint is how
Stanford contracts out jobs to
non-union companies, leaving
little work for employees who are
subsequently laid off because
there is "nothing to do."
According to Serna, "the
workers know there is work there
and that the company (SLAC)
won't give it" to them.
One recently laid-off worker in
SLAC's Mechanical Fabrication
Department, Pete Temby, said he
does not believe that there is ac
tually any "lack of work" — a
reason given to him when he was
laid off by SLAC management.
"We had no lack of work. We
were quite busy," said Temby,
whose employment ended July 5.
But SLAC Director of Personnel
Douglas Dupen said "work in the
Mechanical Fabrication Depart
ment has been declining substan
tially in the past year or two."
According to Dupen, SLAC lays
off workers in order of seniority
"unless the skill and ability are
substantially unequal." If there is
no work, "job-shoppers go first,"
Dupen said.
He said SLAC has acted accord
ing to "the governing policies in
the mutually agreed contract,"
adding that he is "willing to

negotiate" the current contract,
which expires August 31.
Regarding the other complaints,
Dupen said SLAC contracts out
work because, as a federal labo
ratory, SLAC should not "compete
with private industry," and there
fore "uses their services" when
ever possible.
In addition, union and man
gagement representatives argue
about the cost to taxpayers of
maintaining union jobs. Dupen
said SLAC's unit cost on some
items is much less when it con-

work. We were quite
busy.'

tracts out work, thereby "saving
the taxpayers." However, Temby
said using contracted labor is
more expensive because of higher
overhead costs.
While it may be cheaper to con
tract an outside company to make
a large quantity of a product,
Temby said specialized work is
not up to the same standards as
work performed at SLAC.
According to Serna, work from
the Department of Energy which
is paid for by taxpayers is being
contracted out, and therefore
"supporting efforts to choke off
the union."
