Two Stanford students and a
member of the Stanford staff will
serve as delegates at the Demo
cratic National Convention July
18-22 in Atlanta, Georgia.
June graduate Amanda Kemp
and Keith Archuleta, an assistant
director of residential education,
are voting delegates pledged to
support Jesse Jackson, while
graduate student Steve Phillips is
an alternate delegate also for
Jackson.
None of the delegates for Du
kakis or Bush from the 12th Con
gressional District are Stanford
students.
Traveling as part of the dele

gation representing California's
12th Congressional District,
Kemp and Phillips will also serve
as coordinators of a student lob
bying group at the convention.
The lobbying group of some 50
California students and students
from other states will try to in
crease voter registration before
the national elections and make
education a higher priority of the
federal government.
According to a press release
from Students for Jackson, the
lobbying group wants to make the
U.S. educational system "meet
the needs of a multi-cultural so
ciety by ensuring access to every
one and transforming the curric
ulum to reflect the history of
people of color."
According to Kemp, the high
lights of the convention will be
the floor fights over minority com
plaints, Jackson's desire to double
the budget on education and the
presidential nomination night.
"Even though Jackson does not
have the necessary 2,000 delegate
votes, he is a key player of the
convention and will thrust his en
ergy behind Dukakis," Kemp said.
"Jackson prioritizes students
and the young. They are going to
be an active and vibrant student
component for the Convention,"
she added.
Kemp and Phillips, both former
chairs of Stanford's Black Student
Union, have long been active Jack
son supporters and activists for
numerous political causes prior to
the convention.
In addition, both students were
involved with an education con
ference in May which delivered an
"Education Bill of Rights" to
Jackson.
Kemp and Phillips also led a
delegation of Stanford students to
Alabama in January to assist with
a voter registration drive there.
