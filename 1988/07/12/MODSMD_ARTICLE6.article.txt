# Protests halt hotel plans

Plans to build a conference hotel on Stan
ford land near 1-280 have come to a
standstill as local residents and
municipalities are protesting the project
because of a projected increase in traffic
congestion.
Westin Hotel Company Vice President
John R. Olberg requested July 1 that the
Menlo Park Planning Commission "cease
proceedings until further notice" on Wes
tin's application to build a conference hotel
at the junction of Sand Hill Road and 1-280.
Olberg cited three reasons for Westin's
hesitation to proceed with the project:
• Menlo Park must "put in motion" the
Sand Hill Road extension project before
construction of the hotel begins;
• the city must guarantee that the project
will receive neceessary permits; and
• the city must guarantee support for
the hotel.
Planning commissioners in Menlo Park
and Palo Alto said the primary obstacle to
support of the project is a concern that
the hotel will increase traffic congestion.
Local residents have been vocal in express
ing this concern.
The hotel application process, which
began more than a year ago, has come
before the Menlo Park Planning Commis
sion several times but has not yet come
up for a public hearing. The hotel would
bring the City of Menlo Park $990,000 n
year in tax revenues.

Stanford Director of Community Rela
tions Andy Doty said he sees the traffic
problems associated with the Westin Hotel
as "an inescapable reason for delay."
Doty said the University is willing to
postpone development of the land, which
has been vacant since Stanford was
founded, until Westin reaches an agreement
with the local governments.
According to an environmental impact
report on the project, the hotel will generate
4,060 new auto trips per day. The traffic
would be distributed as follows: 25 percent
going north on 1-280, 40 percent going
south on 1-280, and 35 percent using Sand
Hill Road.
The increased traffic flow would also re
quire a change in the traffic signals along
Sand Hill Road, the report states. The Sand
Hill and Santa Cruz intersection would
have to be broadened to handle more traffic
and the stop sign at Orange Avenue and
Santa Cruz would have to be changed to
a traffic signal.
All of the members of the Palo Alto
Planning Commission said they found the
report unconvincing. The Commission
chairman expressed concern that much
more traffic than projected would come
through Palo Alto, especially from San Jose
and San Francisco airports.
Hotel plans include 14 buildings with
387 rooms, two restaurants, a bar, a ball
room, a lounge, two meeting rooms, a fit
ness center, five tennis courts, two pools,
a small store and 623 parking spaces.
