# Getting down to issues: the candidates face off
## Republican Campbell on economy and the deficit 
### David Cline 
With a Ph.D. in Economics, Republican
Tom Campbell, who is a Stanford law pro
fessor, is concentrating largely on economic
issues — including the national budget and
the trade deficit — in his campaign for a
Congressional seat.
The youngest tenured law professor at
Stanford, Campbell is running against
Democratic Candidate Anna Eshoo.
Campbell, who has worked with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Attor
ney General's Office, said the federal deficit
as well as the trade deficit are two of the
"most important issues" in his campaign.
To help balance the budget, Campbell is
proposing to increase taxes on alcohol,
tobacco and imported oil.

"I'm proposing 23 billion dollars [in
taxes] to match the 23 billion dollars in
cuts to go after the deficit twice as fast,"
he said.
Campbell said he does not want to tax
income or investment — only consumption.
To narrow the country's trade deficit,
Campbell is also proposing a duty on sub
sidized products from other countries. "We
ought to work in a global way to get every
country to reduce their subsidies," he said.
Currently a professor of international
trade, Campbell's doctoral thesis dealt with
a very different subject — discrimination
against women in the federal government.
"We are not treating discrimination
seriously" he said, explaining that current
violations of anti-discrimination laws are
now only civil offenses. If he were elected,
such violations would become "criminal"
offenses, Campbell said.
While Eshoo established childcare pro
grams in San Mateo, Campbell said he is
also concerned about childcare and will
work to make all childcare expenses tax
deductable.
"We need to obtain and maintain the
full deductibility of childcare expense by
employer and employee," he said.
Proud of his endorsement by the the
California League of Conservation Voters,
Campbell said he was "very environmen
tally oriented" as well.
"I believe the quality of life in this district
depends upon clean air and water, free of
toxins," he said.
A coast free of offshore oil rigs and a
preserved San Francisco Bay are also im
portant environmental concerns, according
to Campbell.
