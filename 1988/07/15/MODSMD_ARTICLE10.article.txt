# Bush says Iran must share blame

UNITED NATIONS — Vice President George
Bush yesterday called Iranian allegations that a
U.S. Navy cruiser deliberately fired on a commercial
airliner over the Persian Gulf "offensive and absurd"
and instead blamed Iranian officials for what he
said was their failure to divert the jet from the area.
Speaking to the U.N. Security Council, which is
considering a demand by Tehran for a formal con
demnation of the United States, Bush said that
Iran must bear "a substantial measure of respon
sibility" for the July 3 incident, which killed 290
passengers and crew members aboard Iran Air Flight
655.
"They allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with pas
sengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged
in active battle," Bush declared. "That was an ir
responsible and a tragic error."
The vice president, appointed by President Reagan
to deliver the high-profile address, also demanded
that both Iran and its foe Iraq agree to an immediate
cease-fire in their lengthy war. And he defended
the presence and behavior of U.S. forces in the gulf,
including the cruiser Vincennes, which fired the

missiles that hit the Iranian aircraft.
The downing of the jet, he said, would not deter
the United States from its active role in the region.
"I am here to reaffirm to those who depend on
us, and to those who would threaten us, that we're
not going to alter this course," he said.
The response delivered by Bush followed a 91-
minute rebuke of the United States by Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who challenged
the U.S. position that the cruiser fired two missiles
at the jet in the mistaken belief that the plane was
an Iranian F-14 fighter on attack.
"What was the USS Vincennes protecting itself
against?" Velayati asked. "Against the scheduled
flight of an Airbus jetliner filled with 290 passengers
and crew, flying within an internationally recognized
civilian airway?"
The foreign minister said that the shooting "could
not have been a mistake" and accused Reagan ad
ministration officials of engaging in a "deliberate
fabrication" in releasing its version of the events.
Velayati repeatedly referred to the shooting as a
"massacre" and to the victims as "martyrs."
