WASHINGTON - Timetables
for a Cuban withdrawal from An
gola and a South African with
drawal from Namibia could be
worked out by the end of the year
following an agreement in princi
ple among the countries involved,
State Department officials said
yesterday.
But the officials warned that a
settlement of Angola's 13-year-old
civil war, the conflict at the heart
of the U.S.-mediated negotiations
in southern Africa, remains to be
negotiated and will almost surely
take much longer.
The United States, South
Africa, Cuba and Angola reached
an "agreement in principle" Wed
nesday under which Cuba would
withdraw its approximately
60,000 troops from Angola, where
they have been defending the
Marxist government, while South
Africa would end its 73-year-long
rule of Namibia, the territory once
known as Southwest Africa.
"We believe it's possible that
we can work out timetables this
year," a State Department official

said. "A lot depends on whether
the momentum of these negotia
tions can be maintained."
U.S., South African and Cuban
officials all warned that is
sues remain unresolved, but they
confirmed that they had agreed
to work toward linked timetables
for troop withdrawals.
"It is not precise to say that an
agreement has been reached on
the withdrawal of Cuban troops,"
said Alcibiades Hidalgo, a member
of the Central Committee of
Cuba's Communist Party, who led
Havana's delegation at the three
days of talks in New York. "This
issue ... is part of all the discus
sions, is part of a process that is
continuing. It is our opinion that
we made substantial progress."
The governments of Angola,
Cuba and South Africa must first
approve the agreement reached by
their negotiators in New York. As
suming that they will, another
meeting has already been set for
the week of Aug. 1.
