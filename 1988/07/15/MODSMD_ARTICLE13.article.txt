Fraud alleged in Mexican vote
MEXICO CITY — Opposition political parties
yesterday repudiated electoral results showing a
narrow majority for ruling party candidate Carlos
Salinas de Gortari in last week's presidential
election and vowed a nationwide fight against
~11 i ...i. r i

alleged vote fraud.
Mexico's Federal Elec
toral Commission, citing
final results compiled by
its government-appointed
staff, Wednesday night
announced that Salinas
had won the July 6 elec
tion with 50.36 percent of
the vote.
Second was leftist op
position candidate
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
with 31.12 percent and a

distant third was Manuel Clouthier of the con
servative National Action Party, with 17.07 per
cent. Two minor-party candidates split less than
1.5 percent and appeared likely to lose their par
ties' legal status.
Salinas' percentage was the lowest ever re
corded for a presidential candidate of the Insti
tutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has
ruled Mexico for 59 years in the longest such

reign in a non-communist country. The 40-year
old economist received 9.6 million votes, according
to the electoral commission, compared with about
17 million for Miguel de la Madrid when he was
elected president in 1982.
The final returns released by the commission
also showed record congressional losses for the
PEI, leaving it with only 260 seats in the 500-
member Chamber of Deputies, well below the
two-thirds majority necessary to approve consti
tutional amendments, which are frequently re
quired for major political and economic reforms
here.

Marine pursues 146-mile trek
PANAMINT SPRINGS, Calif. - Despite
stomach cramps and searing heat, Marine Corps
Maj. John Bates said he was "emotionally high"
Wednesday as he neared the halfway mark in
his non-stop 146-mile run from the bottom of
Death Valley to the top of 14,464-foot Mount
Whitney.
"Emotionally, I feel very good," Bates said 15
hours into the run that began at 8 p.m. Tuesday
on a salt flat 282 feet below sea level. "But I
had stomach cramps and threw up at 2 a.m."
