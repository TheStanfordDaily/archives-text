## Get involved this fall 
### 
Students must
follow elections

THE presidential elec
tions are coming up
fast, and for many
Stanford undergraduates,
November will provide the
first or second occasion to
exercise their voting
privileges in a national elec
tion.
But how many will actu
ally do so?
If the present political
humdrum is any indication,
Stanford students probably
won't flock to ballot boxes
in the numbers expected of
them.
Before this becomes an in
evitability, it's time for stu
dents to take up the political
mantle and educate them
selves about the candidates,
the issues and the political
process in this country.
One obvious way to do
this is by becoming involved
in politics, and learning
more about the whole spec
trum of politics — both
liberal and conservative.
True, many students al
ready know where they lean
politically, and which politi
cal figures they admire. The
excitement and admiration
Jesse Jackson inspired dur
ing his spring visit to Stan
ford was a clear indication
of this.
But students supporting
other political figures — in

eluding conservative politi
cians — should follow the
lead of Jackson supporters
and throw some energy be
hind their favored candi
date.
The fact that Stanford
has the reputation for
having a liberal campus
should not deter those inter
ested in conservative action
from getting involved, espe
cially in this election year.
More activities like this
spring's mock caucuses at
Florence Moore Hall —■ a
program designed to edu
cate students about the elec
toral process, and the dif
ferent candidates at the
same time — would be wel
come now, and especially in
the fall, as the race heats up.
Residential Education
should jump on the band
wagon by sponsoring
campus debates and encour
aging the dissemination of
information about each can
didates' stance on issues
such as education, child care
or tax reform.
Yet, the greatest impetus
for political action rests with
individual students and stu
dent groups.
In order to encourage the
most free and open debate,
the University and the COP
must remember to make ef
forts to set up balanced non
partisan or bi-partisan pro
grams in order to accomo
date all beliefs.
The real ideological back
and-forth should be left to
the students.
