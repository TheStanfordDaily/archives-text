## Guest Columnist Jackson was shut out for good reasons 
### 
Michael Dukakis
snubbed Jesse Jackson
this week. Dukakis* se
lection of Lloyd Bentsen as his
running mate without conferring
with Jackson has left Jesse livid,
and 1 wouldn't have it any other
way.
The tiff brewing between Du
kakis and Jackson fills me with
glee for two very different reasons.
I'm a Republican, and the poten
tially divisive influence of Jackson
at next week's Democratic Con
vention can only help the can
didacy of George Bush.
Bush probably sleeps at night
with visions of a Jackson-Dukakis
fight on the floor of the Atlanta
convention swimming through his
head. With his amassed delegate
strength, Jackson has the power
to severely wound the Dukakis
candidacy.
But, the main reason I am glad
Jackson is being shut-out of the
Democratic party is that I am
afraid of Jesse Jackson. He is not
someone I want to see gain power
in the United States. And, Jack
son has the kind of political bag
gage that should preclude him
from assuming elected office in
this country.
Mainstream America and the
mainstream Democratic Party

should not and will not overlook
Jackson's many mistakes:
• From the early days of his career
as a civil rights activist, Jackson
was a political opportunist. Fellow
activists recall Martin Luther
King Jr. commenting that Jackson
had a knack for finding the tele
vision camera, and usually showed
up in the background of shots of
King.
• A more egregious example of
Jackson's willingness to do any
thing to gain attention occured
right after King's assassination.
Jesse showed up on television
wearing a blood spattered shirt
that he claimed held King's blood
and told the cameras that he was
the last one to hold the dying King
in his arms. In fact, confidantes
of King later confirmed that Jesse
did not hold the dying King in his
arms, and in fact was not near
King when he was shot.
• Jackson's infamous description
of New York as "Hymietown" is
easily discounted by some, but will
never be forgotten by many
Jewish people. As well, Jesse's
close association with the anti-
Semite Louis Farrakhan, who
rode Jackson's coattails to
prominence, raises serious doubts
about Jesse's attitude toward the
Jewish community. In fact, in his

first bid for the presidency Jack
son used Farrakhan's para
military Moslem guards as
bodyguards.
• Caught in another lie, Jackson
claimed in many campaign
speeches that he grew up poor in
South Carolina, much to the
chagrin of his stepfather. In fact,
Jackson lived in a neighborhood
that could only be described as
middle class and, according to his
stepfather, the young Jackson was
well provided for.
In fact, the best outcome for
the Republican party and the
Bush candidacy would have been
a Dukakis-Jackson ticket; it would
have locked up the election for
Bush.
I don't discount racism as a fac
tor in mainstream America's dis
approval of Jackson, but there are
other obvious grounds for the dis
approval. I think it is too bad
Jackson has become the standard
bearer for blacks in America, be
cause I think there are many
other career politicians less
scarred than Jackson and more
able to overcome the attitudes
that have kept a black man or
woman out of the White House.
