## Japanese consumers can help reduce our trade deficit 
### 
DURING THE last decade,
Japan has racked up
enormous surpluses in its
bilateral trade with the United
States. Japan now possesses the
world's largest international
reserves, is home to the largest
banks in the world and is the
world's largest overseas lender
and investor due to its massive
export earnings.
There is nothing new in this
tale. The persistence of the
trade deficit with Japan helps
explain protectionist sentiments
in the U.S. Congress. Indeed, a
trade bill came a handful of
senate votes from passing both
houses of Congress by the two
thirds majority required to sur
vive a presidential veto in April
and May of 19»e.
Periodic meetings between
U.S. and apanese trade negoti
ators, and between President
Reagan and Prime Minister
Nakasone and his successor
Takeshita, have failed to reverse
this trend. U.S. pressure on
Japan to open its domestic mar
ket to U.S. firms for bidding on
Japanese public works projects,
raising its quotas on beef and
agricultural crops and eliminat
ing other barriers to the sale of
U.S. goods and services has

made little headway. In their
own defense, the Japanese re
spond that Americans make
little effort to learn Japan's
language, customs and the in
tricacies of the country's
wholesale and retail distribution
network. They also insist that
U.S. goods are low in quality,
thereby meeting consumer resis
tance despite lower prices.
The solution to the trade
deficit is a consumer revolt in
Japan. The overwhelming
majority of Japan's 120 million
people are urban consumers,
who pay the highest prices in
the world for bare neccessities,
consumer durables and luxury
goods. U.S. exporters must con
vert the Japanese into a
veritable guerrilla army of 100
million shoppers who demand
their fundamental economic
rights to purchase goods and
services at reasonable prices.
Per capita income in Japan has
caught up with the United
States, but incredibly high
prices in Japan mean a lower
standard of living. Japan is
famous for $00 steaks, $10 can
talopes, and $2 oranges and
apples.
Japanese tourists who venture
into a U.S. supermarket or a

bulk discount store must
emerge shell-shocked when they
discover prices one-half to one
tenth those in Japan. One can't
help but wonder how many
Japanese know, and what they
would do if they did, that in a
typical supermarket Americans
pay about $6 for a hefty t-bone
or porterhouse steak, less than
a dollar per pound for can
taloupe or honeydew melon, $2
for a bag of a dozen apples or
oranges and ten cents for one
banana. No wonder Japan's
farmers want protection from
U.S. exporters!
What is needed is a long
range plan to inform Japanese
consumers about the beating
they are taking in their nation's
supermarkets and department
stores compared to the com
paratively low prices enjoyed by
U.S. consumers. Japanese con
sumers must be constantly bar
raged with the painful facts of
how much they are overcharged.
An alliance between U.S. ex
porters and one hundred million
mobilized angry consumers may
be the most effective way to
knock down some of Japan's
trade barriers.
I suggest that U.S. exporters
join forces to consider a whole

range of tactics: buy advertising
time on Japanese radio and
television, and advertisments in
newspapers and magazines bom
barding the Japanese with vi
sions of low-cost, high-quality
consumer goods, or perhaps
flash price comparisons on the
brilliant neon displays that light
up the Ginza or Shinjuku.
These tactics should gradually
raise the ire of Japanese con
sumers until they launch a full
scale consumer revolt that is
powerful enough to overcome
the special interests that block
increased, cheaper U.S. imports.
The Japanese consumer is
America's secret weapon in re
ducing the trade deficit.
Cooperation between U.S. sellers
and Japanese buyers would
replace conflict between the two
governments. Consumer
conscious Japanese would press
for a freer flow of U.S. imports
to Japan. There is no need for
protectionism or political bully
ing if Japanese consumers can
be fashioned into an effective
political force demanding more
open markets.
