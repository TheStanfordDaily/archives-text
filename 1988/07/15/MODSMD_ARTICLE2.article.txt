# Meese says he plans to come to Hoover
## 
### Kathy Lachcnauer Editorial staff 
U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese 111
announced yesterday that he will join the
Hoover Institution as a researcher.
Meese said he planned to become a full
time fellow at the Heritage Foundation of
Washington D.C. and a visiting fellow at
Hoover when he steps down from his
cabinet position in early August.
While the Associated Press and newspa
pers throughout the country reported that
Meese will definitely come to Hoover as a
visiting fellow, University Provost .James
Rosse said he had "no idea" of the circum
stances surrounding the appointment.
University President Donald Kennedy
left for his month-long summer vacation
yesterday and was not available for com
ment.
Last week, Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell disclosed to the press that he
had invited Meese to come to Stanford as
a "distinguished visiting fellow."
Responding to the offer, Kennedy noted
that Campbell alone can not make academic
appointments at Hoover. Such appoint
ments must be approved by the University
president or provost, Kennedy said.
Campbell was also not available for com
ment yesterday.
"I have had no contact with Dr. Campbell
on this," Rosse said yesterday. "If it turns
out that rules of the University are in
volved," the controversy might carry on.
Rosse said Campbell has the authority
as director to arrange for scholars to visit
Hoover but he cannot appoint them to
academic positions without consulting the
University.

One factor that could decide whether
Meese is considered a University employee
or a visitor is the compensation Campbell
has offered him.
Campbell has said Meese will receive "no
less than $10,000, no more than $20,000"
for a part-time affiliation with Hoover.
Rosse noted that the money Campbell has
offered Meese could be considered an
"honorarium" for a visitor and not payment
for a University employee.
Charging that Kennedy and Rosse have
"just roiled over and played dead," Political
Science Prof. John Manley said adminis
trators must prevent Meese from coming
and ensnaring the University in political
controversy. He predicted that when classes
reconvene in the fall, Stanford faculty and
students will fight to keep Meese from com
ing here.
"In the fall we can only expect that Stan
ford community members will speak to
force the administration to take action,"
Manley said.
But Vice President of Public Affairs Bob
Freelen said the University "ought not to
complain" about Meese coming to Hoover
because he will be here as a researcher —
not as a policy-maker.
"He is not coming here to change policy,
and I really believe that people can sort
out the difference. If they can't do it —
we'll do it for them," Freelen said.
Noting that controversial figures add
"fervor" to university environments,
Freelen said Meese's presence could benefit
Stanford.
"The more controversial a particular in
dividual is, the more valuable it is to have
him here," Freelen said.
