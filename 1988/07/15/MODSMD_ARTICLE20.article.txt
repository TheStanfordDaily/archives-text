## Examine the facts when deciding if the Contras deserve our support 
### 
A LETTER censuring Rac
helle Marshall's opposition
to current U.S. policy
against Nicaragua appeared July
6. This letter, attributed to
Robert Cohn, professor of
Erench, is a paroxysm of non
sequiturs.
Cohn claims that someone
(nameless) from Amnesty Inter
national and a "reliable

reporter" (again nameless) have
details of alleged Sandinista
atrocities (unspecified). Then he
asks: "Why does Marshall
defend the Marxist and the
anti-American side?"
Well, if we are merely mea
suring the atrocities committed
by either side, I'm afraid the
Sandinistas' peach pit won't tip
the scales too much when

weighed against the Somicista-
Contra avalanche. But the issue
isn't who is worse, it is inter
vention in sovereign territory.
Whether we like it or not, Nica
ragua is the sovereign territory
of the Sandinista government.
Cohn then shifts gears and
talks about the Holocaust and
booby-trapped toys in Afghani
stan, a trick the Contras use
and which they learned from
the CIA who tried it out in
Vietnam.
Jumping from Amnesty Inter
national, to Stalin, to the
Holocaust is something no
freshmen could get away with
in composition. We must beware
of the schizophrenic rhetoric
Cohn deploys in responding to
Marshall's facts, facts I will
reiterate.
First, the infant mortality
rate dropped over 50 percent
within the first three years of
the Sandinista government as
suming power.
Secondly, Contra support in
Nicaragua amounts to less than
10 percent, mostly from land
owners who enjoyed vast eco-

nomic privileges under Somoza.
Thirdly, the United States
and the Contras routinely bomb
and assassinate medical facilities
and personnel. The euphemism
is "low intensity warfare." As a
result, most surgery is per
formed without anesthesia and
vital medical equipment.
Amnesty International, the
Organization of American
States, Americas Watch (which
just published a report on
Cuban prisons), and even a
commission appointed by the
U.S. government (whose report
was suppressed) have all sub
stantiated these facts.
The real issue in Central and
Latin America was, and still is,
a matter of self determination.
The rhetorical frothing in the
United States that greets these
efforts is natural given the eco
nomic and political influence the
United States has enjoyed ever
since the mania of Manifest
Destiny and the Monroe Doc
trine took hold in the 1800's.
As for Cohn's insidious in
nuendo in alluding to the
Holocaust, try out these figures

from the last decade. El Sal
vador: 80,000 civilian deaths
and $900 million in U.S. aid;
Guatemala: 50,000 civilian
deaths and $750 million in U.S.
aid; Honduras: 15,000 civilian
deaths and $600 million in U.S.
aid.
Cohn then professes to be
baffled by Marshall's position.
Marshall obviously values
human life over dogma and
rhetoric. She has seen for her
self the lies and political mal
feasance the U.S. practices in
perpetuating its own economic
and political influence. Like
many Americans, she wants the
lies and the killing to stop.
As an apologist for orthodoxy,
Cohn is bound to be baffled. He
reminds me of the Red Cross
during WWII. After touring the
concentration camps in 1939
and 1940, the representatives of
the Red Cross came back vouch
ing for the humane conditions
of the camps and admonishing
us to keep in mind the
atrocities of "the other side."
