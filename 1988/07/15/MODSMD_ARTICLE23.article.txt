## Hoover carillons carol on to captive campus crowds 
### Liz Treynor 
At> the very top of Hoover
Tower, in a dimly lit storeroom,
carillonneur Tim Zerlinger brings
music to the masses twice daily.
While everyone hears the
beauty of the carillon, only a few
know who — or what — plays it.
Unlike the organist's back that
visitors may spy at Memorial
Church, nothing is ever seen of
the musicians who play the bells
of Hoover Tower.
"The best part about it is that
we can be fairly anonymous. We
come up here and play and no
one can see us doing it. We can
leave the tower and we can see
people eating their lunches but
they have no idea that we're re
sponsible. That's the best part,"
says Zerlinger, a professional or
ganist.
Zerlinger, along with Electrical
Engineering Prof. James Angell
and Stanford graduate Jeannie
Barton, are the musical master
minds who play the bells despite
the listless presence of an auto
matic system. Although Stanford
owns the only automatic playing
mechanism functioning in North
America, the hammer-dropping
device only plays three songs and
is rarely used.
The human operators don't
drop hammers, but throw levers
instead. A keyboard, coupled with
16 foot pedals, is located one floor
beneath the bells. Wires, running
through holes in the base of the
observation tower, connect each

key or pedal to a bell clapper
above. The clappers are just
inches from the bell rim; this
simple mechanism eliminates any
delay between punching down a
lever and actually ringing the bell.
"It's not incredibly complicated
to play the carillon," Zerlinger ad
mits. "If you happen to play the
organ it makes life a lot easier
up here in the carillon, because
we are using hands and feet at
the same time," he says. The proc
ess is similar to playing the piano
and driving a car simultaneously,
as most organists know.
Not all pieces are suitable for
this unusual instrument. The
choice of music is limited by the
fact that the carillon continues to
play a given note for a relatively
long time and can play only six
notes at once.
Barton has arranged some
Beatles tunes and Angell, the Uni
versity Carillonneur himself, also
adapts alternative music,
Zerlinger says.
According to Zerlinger, the
anonymity of playing in Hoover
Tower's 13th floor storage room
can be particularly comforting
when a performance doesn't go
well — which, he says, is not so
unusual: "We're always making
mistakes up here because we have
no way of practicing!" he com
plains. Hoover Tower's relatively
small number of out-of-tune bells
— 35 here at Stanford compared
to 61 at Berkeley — are also cause
for minor complaint.
