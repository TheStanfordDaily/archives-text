"Wings of Desire"
Aquarius Cinemas

Palo Alto
Short on action but very long
on meaning, the German film
"Wings of Desire," directed by
Wim Wenders, will probably not
endear itself to American
audiences. Set in contemporary
Berlin, "Wings" is a complex ex
cursion into the meaning of exis
tence and a lyrical examination of
how we often mistake the truly
beautiful for the meraly simple.
The movie opens with serious
questions from a child. "Why am
I me, and not you? Why am I
here, and not there? Is life under
the sun merely a dream?"
These innocent questions
mingle with the mental voices of
Berlin's inhabitants as we are
flown through the city on the

wings of an angel named Damiel
(yes, an angel, complete with
pony-tail instead of halo) whose
job is to listen to troubled souls
and offer invisible support.
The voices question and ques
tion and question, rising up to fill
Damiel's (Bruno Ganz) thoughts
with his own questions and
doubts. He's tired of an eternal
existence as a passive observer,
living without color and depth, un
able to interact with the mortals
whose existential plight constantly
intrigues him.
Provoked by descriptions of the
basic joys of living ("To drink cof
fee. To smoke. And when you do
it together, it's fantastic."), made
curious by one man's disbelief in
lost heritage and, finally, seduced
by a strange attraction to a
trapeze artist, Damiel decides to
walk the earth as a human and
let his voice mingle with the rest.

He throws his wings away forever,
then sets out to find the enigmatic
acrobat and begin his own quest
for answers.
Wenders won the Best Director
award at Cannes for his adroit
mix of childish questioning with
sophisticated inquiry. The movie
is a visual fairy-tale, stunningly
filmed for the most part in black
and-white, that asks and asks but
doesn't dare offer any answers.
This may sound rather pointless,
a movie full of questions and no
answers; but, by doing this, it mir
rors life.
And, like life, the film wasn't
all good. The interplay of color
and black-and-white photography
is jarring in some places, and, as
a thematic device showing the dif
ference between the lifelessness
of the angels' world and the
vibrancy of ours, it's rather
heavy-handed. Moreover, an un

bearably long and ridiculously
"meaningful" scene at the end al
most obliterates the worth of the
rest of the movie.
Nevertheless, do yourself a fa
vor and pass on Sly or Eddie,
prepare yourself for a little mental
activity and go see a couple of
unknowns (to Americans) live life
and not a fantasy. If you are open
minded and patient, "Wings of
Desire" can re-introduce you to
the notion of film as viable art,
not simply mundane entertain
ment.

"License to Drive" is the kind
of high school movie they used to
make, if by "used to" you mean

last summer and the summer
before. Corey Haim and Corey
Feldman (no relation) play two
Los Angeles brats whose lives
revolve around that endless wait
for the first chance to drive the
family sedan down Santa Monica
Boulevard at night and with a girl.
Les Anderson (Haim) turns 16
first, and when he fails his driver's
test there's no way he can tell his
friends or skip a fluke opportunity
to go out with the most seductive
girl in his school, Mercedes (Heat
her Graham).
What follows is a midnight-to
dawn comedy of errors, like an
L.A. version of "After Hours."
The plot follows the carefree
twists of chance and surrealism
seen in Flaubert, which gives tex
ture and style to what would
otherwise be heavy-handed at
tempts at zaniness.
