# 'Pullman Car Hiawatha' offers a smooth, brisk ride

To call the Stanford Summer Theater
ambitious would be an understatement.
The 28-actor company, sponsored by the
Department of Drama, is undertaking a
grueling repertory schedule this summer
presenting nine one-act plays by Samuel
Beckett, Bertolt Brecht, David Mamet and
Thornton Wilder in a revolving schedule
five days a week through August 6th.
By presenting a different show every
Tuesday through Friday at noon, the Stan
ford Summer Theater offers a great way
to spend a lunch hour at an unbeatable
price of $1. For those who prefer their
theater after dark, Friday and Saturday
evenings feature two or three of the one-act
plays in a combined 8 p.m. performance
costing $2.
Luckily, this rigorous schedule means

good news for theater fans around Stanford
this summer, if last Tuesday's performance
of Wilder's "Pullman Car Hiawatha" is any
indication of the quality of the project as
a whole.
Directed by doctoral student Geoff
Proehl, "Pullman Car Hiawatha" tells the
story of a group of people traveling from
New York to Chicago and the events that
transpire during their nighttime journey.
Especially affecting is Terra Vandergaw's
moving portrayal of the Insane Woman
who is traveling on the train with her two
attendants, and Kate Gallun's softspoken
Harriet who dies of heart failure during
the journey.
Together the two underscore one theme
of the play that only through death or
insanity can someone truly come to know
themselves, a message Vandergaw's char
acter almost explicitly states at one point.
At points the play begins to border on

the insipidly comical, such as when two
performers who represent points of interest
along the route transform into a pair of
Archangels who more than slightly
resemble the Blues Brothers.
But the cast manages to bring the pro
duction back to an insightful and biting
commentary as each character tells the Ar
changels why he or she should or should
not be taken with them, a scene the com
pany plays to perfection.

Stanford Summer Theater presents Beck
ett's "Play," "Rockaby" and "Not I",
Brecht's "The Jewish Wife" and"The Ex
ception and the Rule," Mamet's "The Water
Engine"and "Mr. Happiness"and Wilder's
"Pullman Car Hiawatha" and "Happ\
Journey." Both Wilder plays will be pre
sented this Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.
in the Nitery. For information, call 723-
