## George strikes (out) again 
### 
George Steinbrenner, the
wide-mouthed owner of
the New York Yankees,
was obviously bored.
It was the All-Star break and
he probably had nothing to do.
Then, all of the sudden, he had
an inspiration. . . .
"I could make some headlines,"
thought the millionaire shipping
magnate. "Blast Winfield ... or
Henderson ... or, dare I say it
. . . Mattingly, and the press will
eat it up. It's worked a dozen
times before, it'll work again."
So Steinbrenner called up one
of his journalist buddies and let
it be known that his "big-money"
players weren't producing up to
their potential.

Steinbrenner was annoyed that
Dave Winfield was out promoting
his book on the day of games. He
didn't think Rickey Henderson,
who had a number of ankle prob
lems this season, and Don Mat
tingly, who had been on the dis
abled list recently, should be off
playing in the All-Star game in
stead of resting. He also had some
choice words about how Mattingly
wasn't producing.
The press bought it hook, line
and sinker. Every sports page in
the country repeated George's
diatribes verbatim.
The players, for their own part,
seem unfazed. Winfield said he's
heard it all before. Henderson said

he was healthy and would play in
the game and have some fun. Mat
tingly, the consummate profes
sional, said nothing.
It seemed as if George could
pat himself on the back and
say "Mission Accomplished!"
Steinbrenner has said in the past
that he chastises his players to
motivate them. The Yankees play
has been lackluster of late and
Steinbrenner probably believed
his comments helped the Yankees.
But this time something went
awry. Steinbrenner told New York
Daily News' columnist Mike
Lupica that he was "backing off.
I've got to back off; so I'm off.
I'm clamming up."
Then he went further. He ac
tually apologized to Mattingly. He
said "I'm sorry that it came out
wrong about Don Mattingly and
you can quote me."
Then he even apologized to Win
field. "I keep telling everybody
that he has been absolutely Her
culean for me so far, even with
his recent slump," he said.
• This is the same Dave Winfield
who Steinbrenner tried to trade
earlier this spring. He was ready
to exchange him for a nobody like
Kevin Bass of the Astros. But
Winfield used the no-trade clause
in his contract to block any deals.
Ever since he came to the
Yankees, Winfield has done
everything he can to win
but Steinbrenner has always been
critical of the right-fielder's per
formance. The owner defines win
ning by pennants and World Se
ries titles. Winfield, he says,
doesn't bring these things to the
Yankees.
Steinbrenner fails to note that
his propensity to keep young
players on the "Columbus
shuttle" between the majors and

AAA ball, his history of bad trades
and his disruption of the ball club
have had a lot more to do with
the Yankees lack of success than
Dave Winfield.
All Dave Winfield gives to the
Yankees is 110 percent of
his enormous talent. He
hits, hits for power, runs, fields
and throws — the five facets of
the game at which one can excel.
Some consider the Oakland
Athletics* Jose Canseco to be "the
most complete player in baseball"
today because of his abilities in
those five areas. But when Can
seco was asked upon whom he'd
bestow that honor he didn't
hesitate with his answer.
"Dave Winfield," he said.
Indeed, Canseco is right. Win
field, at 36, has been having the
best offensive season of his career,
batting .346 with 15 home runs
and 62 runs batted in.
In the outfield, he is one of the
best in recent times with a cannon
arm and the ability to make many
a spectacular catch. Winfield
jumped over the wall to take away
opponents homers when Eric
Davis was a shortstop in the
rookie leagues.
Now, with the Yankees in an
excellent position to make a run
at the division title, George might
finally be learning that he should
keep his trap shut.
He said, "I mean it this time.
I'm off as of now. ... If they want
me to shut up, fine. I'll shut up."
The words have been hollow in
the past, but, if they ring true
this time, that could be good news
for the Bronx Bombers.
