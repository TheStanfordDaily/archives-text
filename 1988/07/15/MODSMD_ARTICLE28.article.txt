# U.S. spikers to take on S. Korea at Cal
## Three Stanford greats will be competing 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It may not be a contest, but
at least it will be fun.
The U.S. men's national vol
leyball team plays South Korea
tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m.
in California's Harmon Gym in
an Olympic tune-up. And while
the Koreans aren't much of a
match for the top-ranked U.S.
team, the game should provide
Northern California volleyball
fans a chance to see why the
men's volleyball team is this
country's surest bet for a gold
medal.
The match will also mark the
return to the Bay Area of three
former Stanford stars: Chris
Braun, Scott Fortune and Jon
Root. Braun and Root both
played for the Cardinal from
1983 to 1986, while Fortune
stopped out this past year and
will return for his senior season
in October.
The three are currently on a
15-man roster — one that will
be cut down to 12 for the Olym
pics — and Root and Fortune
have nearly guaranteed them
selves spots. Both have been
starting on the six-city tour
with the Koreans (the United
States won the first two
matches handily) due to inju
ries to the regular starters.
Fortune is replacing 6-foot-8
Craig Buck at middle blocker
and Root is filling in for Steve
Timmons at right-side hitter.
Braun, the newest member

of the national team, has also
seen some playing time at
middle blocker. "It's a totally
different game," he said. "Mul
tiply playing in college by
10. ... I'm really learning a lot
and it's really fun."
Fortune's first time on the
court in red, white and blue
came in the summer of 1986
in a match against the Soviet
Union, the second-ranked team
in the world. Timmons re
opened a gash between two fin
gers and had to leave play five
minutes into the match.
"I was very nervous," For
tune said, "going 'What am I
doing here?' Karch (Kiraly, the
team's captain), Timmons . . .
I've looked up to these guys
for so long. I was going 'Oh
my God.' I felt like a puppy
out there. Things were going
around me so quickly.
Root, who has been with the
team full-time since 1986, also
had his problems. "It was an
experience at first," he said.
"You always have the nerves
the first year, wondering: Am
I going to play at the level ex
pected. You just have to keep
playing your best. So far things
have worked out for the bet
ter."
All three are hoping to make
the final 12, and they feel con
fident about the USA's shot at
the gold. "We have the quality
of people that can do it, take
it into their own hands," Root
said. "Most of the teams know
that and fear that."
It may not be a contest, but
at least it will be fun.
