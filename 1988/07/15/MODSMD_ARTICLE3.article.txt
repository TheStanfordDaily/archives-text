# Advising Center struggles with charges of inefficiency
##

Steve Cummer could easily have gotten
lost academically when he arrived at Stan
ford, as his only adviser was a professor
from "an obscure part of engineering who
didn't know very much about undergrad
uate requirements."
Judging from recent complaints, Cum
mer, who was a freshman last year, was
probably not alone in being unsatisfied with
Stanford's undergraduate advising system.
More recently, a pair of resident fellows
have also questioned the quality of advising
and the University's Undergraduate Advis
ing Center and suggested ways to improve
its services.
"The UAC needs to concentrate less on

how wonderful it is for students to be af
filiated with a Stanford professor" and to
"more efficiently" train advisers in"the
nuts and bolts of academic information,"
according to Linda Paulson, the resident
fellow in Donner.
With an unusually high number of fresh
men expected this fall, the UAC has added
50 advisers and a number of student Ac
ademic Advisers, according to Audrey
Bernfield, director of undergraduate advis
ing at the UAC.
Bernfield admitted that the advising sys
tem "will never be perfect" but said the
UAC staff "cared desperately about the
students." However, she added that stu
dents need to take responsibility and con
tact their advisers if they need academic
help.

"Advisers are not supposed to be walking
catalogues," Bernfield said. "Its very hard
to teach and do research and chase some

kid who doesn't want to be found."
Kennell Jackson, resident fellow in Bran
ner, the largest freshman dorm on campus,

also questioned some of the philosophy be
hind the advising program.
"The adviser dinners are Hill right but I
wouldn't write home about them," Jackson
said.
"More emphasis should be put on
motivating students," he said. "I think
there are a lot of students who come here
with great dreams and then settle into a
sub-level of achievement."
Bernfield admitted some students do "get
lost" in the system and may go through
four years "without meeting faculty, taking
a seminar, doing research, or writing a
paper."
She agreed with Jackson that the advis
ing center "needs to put more pressure on
students to demand more."
"We're trying to reconstruct
and change the program to im
prove the quality and consistency
of advising," according to newly
appointed Student Director of Ac
ademic Advising David Kim.
"I don't know if things were
organized that well last year,"
Kim said.
In addition to a course held last
spring to train student AAs, Kim
said the program will have a
"really involved" orientation this
year, with 10 more head AA's
than last year in various dorms.
According to Kim, the AA office
"makes due" with a "skeleton
budget" which will cover the price
of weekly student-faculty dinners

and hopefully a "retreat" for the
advising faculty and staff.
Among improvements, Jackson
suggested there should be "more

intensive small-group discus
sions" between students and ad
visers about their experiences.
The discussions would "raise stu
dent consciousness" and "change
the way we think about" the ad
vising system.
"There are enough dedicated
and interesting people here that
the University can produce a
really fabulous system," Jackson
said.
