# Rough riding plagues Palm Drive

While more than $350,000
will go to beautify Palm Drive
this summer, potholes and
bumps will still be part of the
main entrance to the University
once this money is spent.
Although Stanford annually
spends 70 percent of its road
repair budget on Palm Drive,
Operations and Maintenance
Field Engineer Martin Beene
said this money cannot cure all
of the road's pothole problems.
"If you really wanted to fix it
you'd have to rip it up, then
you're talking half a million dol
lars," Beene said. "It's a lot of

money to spend and there's no
donor."
In addition, John Lerry, proj
ect manager for Palm Drive,
said more than pot holes plague
the road.
According to Lerry, the up
ward curvature of Palm Drive
makes the going especially dif
ficult for drivers. "It's a very
hard street and people object to
the crown or curvature of the
street. It makes it look odd and
slows people down," he said,
adding that Palm Drive has not
been repaved for at least 10
years.
In fact, the work currently un
derway on the road is more cos

metic than practical.
By fall, Lerry and his grounds
crew will have transplanted 13
palm trees — at $25,000 a trunk
— to fill gaps along the road.
Other planned landscaping will
clear overgrown plants from the
walls and archways along the
road.
But many feel Stanford
should concentrate more on the
road's maintenance and less on
its landscape. "People don't
really notice the gaps in the
palms bcause they're concen
trating on avoiding the pot
holes," said one official in the
Office of the Public Affairs.
