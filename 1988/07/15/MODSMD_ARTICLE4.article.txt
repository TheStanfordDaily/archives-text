# Seeking new frontiers
## Overseas Studies builds anew, changes the old 
### Cam Litsey 
If Overseas Studies Director Thomas
Heller had his way, the globe would soon
be studded with Stanford overseas cam
puses.
And indeed, Heller is working to make
his expansionist vision a reality.
Currently, organizers in the Overseas
Studies Program are working to set up
new centers in Japan and Argentina, while
programs in Berlin, Florence and Israel are
undergoing renovations.
Heller attributes much of this expansion
to a renewed "consciousness of a multipolar
world." He said the concentration of centers
in Western Europe no longer encompasses
the needs and curiosity of the Stanford
student body.
He also expressed interest in getting stu
dents from different majors involved in the
overseas programs. New course options in
the social sciences and engineering should
broaden the scope of study abroad, he said.
Changes have already taken place at the
Berlin and Krakow campuses. Students
may now choose a two semester program
in East-West relations, living in Berlin win

ter quarter and in Krakow spring quarter.
A field trip to the Soviet Union at the end
of spring quarter is designed to give stu
dents a taste of life under glasnost.
"The Soviet Union field trip gave them
a perspective better than they ever hoped
for," Heller said.
According to Heller, integrating an over
seas experience with course work at Stan
ford will attract more students to study
abroad. Professors from foreign univer
sities affiliated with Stanford will come to
campus and open up new fields for under
graduate work.
For example, faculty from the .Jagel
lonian University in Krakow will come to
Stanford this fall and teach classes in East
ern European politics and society.
Relocating the Florence campus from a
villa on the outskirts of the city to the
center of Florence will strengthen the cur
riculum by centralizing living and learning,
according to Heller. Students now live with
Italian families instead of in the isolated
villa and take classes in a palazzo by the
Arno.
Organizers said they hope by
studying the development of tradi
tional Florentine industries, the
possibility of European economic
unification and Italian politics and
economics, students will have a
more complete picture of Italy
today. The goal of this expansion
is to "overcome the idea that Italy
and Europe are a repository of
our history and to forge a new
relationship," Heller said.
Of the new campuses, the Kyoto
center has attracted the most at
tention from Stanford depart
ments. The engineering and busi
ness schools will fund faculty po
sitions in the new Japanese cen
ter, set to open next spring. Two
tracks will offer different curricula
for "fuzzies" and "techies."
"It should be easily ac
cesible. ... It will be trying to link
up academic fields at Stanford
University with the appropriate
focus study areas," Heller said.
He added that three new ex
pansions will help meet the de
mands of an increasingly diverse
faculty and student body. While
Overseas Studies will continue to
meet the traditional expectations
of classes in languages, history,
and art, the department will seek
new academic directions as well.
Course selections at the Berlin
and Kyoto campuses will encour
age engineering majors to leave
Terman for study abroad. Centers
at Krakow and Argentina will give
a different perspective to the
study of economics and political
science, according to Heller.

Overseas Studies Academic Ad
visor Edmundo Fuenzalida is
working on an Argentine campus
for the 1989-90 school year. The
program, to be located in Buenos
Aires, may move to Chile or
Mexico depending on its success.
"Buenos Aires is a cultural cap
ital of Latin America. Students
will experience the life of a great
metropolis," Fuenzalida said.
One of the attractions of this
campus is the "ability to find an
environment where the state and
military are learning to partici
pate in social structures," Heller
said.
The political and social events
of this decade have made Argen
tina an exciting prospect, accord
ing to Fuenzalida. But they also
pose a challenge.
Currency fluctuations could

wreak havoc with the relatively
small Overseas Studies budget.
"The situation of hyperinflation
is certainly one that recommends
prudence," Fuenzalida said.
The other major change will
come in Israel, where the Stan
ford campus will move from Haifa
to the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem in the fall of 1989. This
relocation should allow students
to savor the greater diversity of
cultural life in Jerusalem, Heller
said. The core classes will deal
with the politics and economies
of the Middle-East, Jewish
studies, the history of science, art
and languages in contemporary Is
rael. A faculty advisor will inform
students about research opportu
nities in Israel and elsewhere in
the Middle East.

River in the middle of the city. This year the Overseas Studies
Program decided to board students with families instead of housing
them in a Renaissance villa outside the city.

University with the appropriate
focus study areas," Heller said.
He added that three new ex
pansions will help meet the de
mands of an increasingly diverse
faculty and student body. While
Overseas Studies will continue to
meet the traditional expectations
of classes in languages, history,
and art, the department will seek
new academic directions as well.
Course selections at the Berlin
and Kyoto campuses will encour
age engineering majors to leave
Terman for study abroad. Centers
at Krakow and Argentina will give
a different perspective to the
study of economics and political
science, according to Heller.

Overseas Studies Academic Ad
visor Edmundo Fuenzalida is
working on an Argentine campus
for the 1989-90 school year. The
program, to be located in Buenos
Aires, may move to Chile or
Mexico depending on its success.
"Buenos Aires is a cultural cap
ital of Latin America. Students
will experience the life of a great
metropolis," Fuenzalida said.
One of the attractions of this
campus is the "ability to find an
environment where the state and
military are learning to partici
pate in social structures," Heller
said.
The political and social events
of this decade have made Argen
tina an exciting prospect, accord
ing to Fuenzalida. But they also
pose a challenge.
Currency fluctuations could

wreak havoc with the relatively
small Overseas Studies budget.
"The situation of hyperinflation
is certainly one that recommends
prudence," Fuenzalida said.
The other major change will
come in Israel, where the Stan
ford campus will move from Haifa
to the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem in the fall of 1989. This
relocation should allow students
to savor the greater diversity of
cultural life in Jerusalem, Heller
said. The core classes will deal
with the politics and economies
of the Middle-East, Jewish
studies, the history of science, art
and languages in contemporary Is
rael. A faculty advisor will inform
students about research opportu
nities in Israel and elsewhere in
the Middle East.

them in a Renaissance villa outside the city.
