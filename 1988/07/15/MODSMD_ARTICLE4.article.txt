# Seeking new frontiers
## Overseas Studies builds anew, changes the old 
### Cam Litsey 
If Overseas Studies Director Thomas
Heller had his way, the globe would soon
be studded with Stanford overseas cam
puses.
And indeed, Heller is working to make
his expansionist vision a reality.
Currently, organizers in the Overseas
Studies Program are working to set up
new centers in Japan and Argentina, while
programs in Berlin, Florence and Israel are
undergoing renovations.
Heller attributes much of this expansion
to a renewed "consciousness of a multipolar
world." He said the concentration of centers
in Western Europe no longer encompasses
the needs and curiosity of the Stanford
student body.
He also expressed interest in getting stu
dents from different majors involved in the
overseas programs. New course options in
the social sciences and engineering should
broaden the scope of study abroad, he said.
Changes have already taken place at the
Berlin and Krakow campuses. Students
may now choose a two semester program
in East-West relations, living in Berlin win

ter quarter and in Krakow spring quarter.
A field trip to the Soviet Union at the end
of spring quarter is designed to give stu
dents a taste of life under glasnost.
"The Soviet Union field trip gave them
a perspective better than they ever hoped
for," Heller said.
According to Heller, integrating an over
seas experience with course work at Stan
ford will attract more students to study
abroad. Professors from foreign univer
sities affiliated with Stanford will come to
campus and open up new fields for under
graduate work.
For example, faculty from the .Jagel
lonian University in Krakow will come to
Stanford this fall and teach classes in East
ern European politics and society.
Relocating the Florence campus from a
villa on the outskirts of the city to the
center of Florence will strengthen the cur
riculum by centralizing living and learning,
according to Heller. Students now live with
Italian families instead of in the isolated
villa and take classes in a palazzo by the
Arno.
