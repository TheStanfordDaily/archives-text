### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
Incumbent Congressman Ernie Konnyu yesterday
quelled a rumor that he might continue his quest
for a second term in Congress as an Independent
or write-in candidate.
According to Craig Travis, a field representative
for Konnyu, the congressman has been considering
the possibility of continuing the race since his loss
to Stanford Law School Prof. Tom Campbell in the
June Republican primary.
Quoted in a press release yesterday, Konnyu said
he was looking forward to "sitting out a general
election, and maybe just going fishing."
Campbell said he was "pleased that the congress
man has decided not to run."
Konny\i's decision removes a cloud over the Camp
bell campaign. A revitalized Konnyu candidacy po
tentially could have split the Republican vote in the
district, and given the contest to the Democratic
challenger Anna Rshoo. Travis said the decision
"certainly enhanced the party's chances of winning
the seat."
Campbell agreed, saying "it is better for the Re
publican Party to be united."
