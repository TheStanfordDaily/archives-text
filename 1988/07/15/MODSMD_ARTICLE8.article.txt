# COP gears up for fall voter drive, new discount store

### Sally Hamaker 
When Stanford students return to
campus this fall they can expect to find
voter registration booths, a student-run dis
count supply store and a redesigned course
guide waiting for them, according to mem
bers of the newly elected ASSU Council of
Presidents.
Winning a narrow victory last spring,
the COP ran on a progressive platform
that emphasized combining student serv
ices with political activism. And this sum
mer three of the four COP members, junior
David Brown, fifth-year senior Stacey
Leyton and junior Canetta Ivy are on
campus trying to implement their campaign
promises.
Although Brown, Leyton and Ivy all have
other summer jobs, they said they are
working a combined 80 hours a week at
the ASSU office in Tresidder Union. Senior
Miguel Marquez, the fourth COP member,
is spending the summer in Texas.
According to Brown, a planned voter reg
istration drive is a top priority for the COP
this summer. "Right now 18 to 20 percent
of all the students in California are regis
tered voters and only about half of them
are actually voting," Brown said. "For stu
dents to get more political power, they need
to get out and vote."
Hoping to motivate students before the
October 11th voter registration deadline,
the COP is initiating a dorm representative
program. Representatives from each dorm

will act as liasons between the COP and
the residences, giving information to stu
dents about registration and voting.
Voter registration materials will also be
under dormitory doors by the first week
of fall quarter, according to Brown.
In addition, the COP will target places
where people congregate during the first
few weeks of school and set up voter reg
istration booths there.
A student store is another project un
derway at the COP office this summer. Ivy
said the student-run store will sell discount
school supplies and telephones through a
mail-order service. At the end of fall quar
ter, the COP also hopes to organize a buy
back program for text books. Both student
service projects could provide competition
for the Stanford Bookstore, according to
Ivy.
A redesigned course guide is also a COP
summer project. COP members have been
gathering "a sampling of student quotes"
that summarize student opinions about
classes they have taken, Leyton said.
Brown said the COP will supplement this
new course guide with a free "course con
sultant" service that will be available dur
ing the first few weeks of each quarter.
Students who are academic advisers or
departmental peer advisers will act as
course consultants. They will sit in White
Plaza, giving free advice about classes.
"What we're about is giving students a
right to an education that teaches them
the truth." Leyton said.
