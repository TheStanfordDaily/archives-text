ATLANTA — Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis negotiated
a breakfast-table truce with his
most persistent rival, Jesse Jack
son, yesterday as the Democratic
National Convention opened with
high hopes that the new-found
party harmony can help boost the
Democrats back into the White
House in November.
Dukakis, the prospective nom
inee, apparently gained Jackson's
promise to campaign for the ticket
without altering his positions or
making more than the expected
gestures of inclusion to the black
civil rights leader and his follow
ers. The agreement ended a week
of increasingly tense maneuver
ings between the winner of the
primaries and the leader of the
party's most loyal constituency.
Last night, more than 4,000
delegates jammed into their seats
in the crowded Omni to hear
keynoter Ann Richards, Texas
state treasurer, skewer Vice Pres
ident Bush, whom the Republi
cans are expected to nominate

next month as Dukakis' Novem
ber opponent, as a privileged
plutocrat who is only now "dis
covering America.''
"Poor George," she jibed, "he
can't help it he was born with a
silver foot in his mouth."
Former president Jimmy
Carter, savoring political
rehabilitation eight years after
being defeated by Ronald Reagan,
was to tell the convention that
the Democrats can win as "the
party of change" pledged to curb
deficits, restore "a coherent
foreign policy" and improve ethics
in government if they just remem
ber the need for unity.
But the words that made the
day for the Democrats were ut
tered hours earlier when Dukakis
and Jackson emerged from break
fast with an agreement to settle
the conflict that had clouded the
Massachusetts governor's hopes
of showing the national television
audience that the Democrats
would go united, for once, into
the fall campaign.

Dukakis said Jackson had
agreed to "play a m£yor role in
this campaign," and the civil
rights leader expressed "the com
mitment to help build a team that
will expand our party and carry
us to victory in November."
Dukakis told a news conference
there had been "no deal," but
aides on both sides said Jackson
had won pledges that many of his
campaign workers would be hired
by the Dukakis organization and
the Democratic National Commit
tee's key panels would expand to
make room for Jackson.
Dukakis also renewed previous
pledges to support stiffer legisla
tion against South Africa, expand
child-care programs, give
statehood to the District of Co
lumbia, channel contracts to mi
nority businesses and allow Elec
tion Day voter registration. But
Jackson apparently got no prom
ises of exactly what role he or his
supporters would have in a Du
kakis presidential transition.
