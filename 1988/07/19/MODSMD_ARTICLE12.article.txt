Counsel won't prosecute Meese
WASHINGTON — Independent counsel James
McKay said yesterday that Attorney General Ed
win Meese 111 "probably violated the criminal
law" on four occasions since taking office, but
that prosecution was not warranted because of
extenuating circumstances.
In an 830-page report that wound up a 14-
month investigation, McKay said an unbiased
judge or jury would "probably conclude beyond
a reasonable doubt" that Meese had willfully
filed a false income tax return, failed to pay
capital gains taxes when they were due, and
committed twro violations of federal conflict-of
interest law by taking part in telephone industry
regulatory matters in which he had a financial
interest.
But McKay said he decided not to seek criminal
charges against Meese in the telecommunications
inquiry because "there is no evidence that Mr.
Meese acted from motivation for personal gain."
Although the attorney general held about $13,500
worth of stock in the seven regional "Baby Bell"
telephone companies, the report said, "there is
no evidence that he acted out of self-interest."
And while faulting Meese for failing to pay
taxes on capital gains of $20,706 that were due
in 1985 on the sale of securities and for failing

to disclose the transactions on his tax return
that year, McKay called the actions "a one-time
failure to comply in full with his tax obligations;
they were not part of a pattern of disobedience
to the tax laws."
The findings, made public by the three-judge
special court that appointed McKay last year,
were bitterly denounced by Meese, who two weeks
ago said McKay's decision not to bring charges
"completely vindicated" him and announced he
would be leaving the Justice Department by Au
gust.
Soviets say 'no' to Armenians
MOSCOW — In a decision that places the
Kremlin in direct confrontion with the largest
protest movement in recent Soviet history, the
Supreme Soviet yesterday rejected Armenian de
mands to take over the disputed Nagorno-
Karabakh region.
After an eight-hour meeting in the Kremlin,
the country's nominal parliament ruled that
Nagorno-Karabakh would continue to be part of
the republic of Azerbaijan, even though its people
are predominantly Armenian.
