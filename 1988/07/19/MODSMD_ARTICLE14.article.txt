## Fix student advising 
### 
Advising system
must be revamped

Attempting to
usher students
smoothly through
Stanford's morass of majors
and requirements, the Uni
versity's advising system is
almost as full of holes as
Palm Drive.
It's time University offi
cials started thinking about
what is going wrong. A com
mittee of faculty, students
and administrators should
be created to investigate ad
vising systems at other
major universities, looking
for innovations that could
improve the quality of aca
demic advis'ng here.
At Harvard, for example,
advisers track their ad
visees' undergraduate prog
ress by compiling a file of
the advisee's accomplish
ments from class to class,
including favorable com
ments from professors about
the student's work. Other
schools must have similarly
interesting innovations.
Armed with new informa
tion, officials would then be
in a better position to con
sider a comprehensive re
structuring of the advising
system. As part of this over
haul, the University should:
• Create a computerized in
formation network at the
Undergraduate Advising

Center. Through electronic
mail, this network would al
low students to seek advice
from any department.
Locating the computer ter
minals at the UAC would
also encourage students to
take advantage of its under
used resources.
• Facilitate changes if an
advisor-advisee match-up is
not working. Currently,
frosh are paired with their
first faculty advisers sight
unseen, before they have ar
rived at the University. If
advisees find better rapport
with another faculty mem
ber, the way for them should
be cleared to switch with a
minimum of red tape.
• Provide more support for
students placed on academic
probation. The current per
functory letter placing a stu
dent on probation does little
to remedy problems. Ad
visers should follow up with
the student to monitor prog
ress and offer encourage
ment.
Obviously, students share
a large part of the respon
sibility for flaws in the cur
rent advising system. Stu
dents need to seek out ad
vice, and currently they too
seldom take the initiative.
But the current system
provides little incentive for
student-faculty interaction.
It's time to take a look at
other programs so we can
get to work fixing our own.
