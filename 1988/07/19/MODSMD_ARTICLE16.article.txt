## Kids aren't for everyone 
### 
WHAT'S SCARIER than
living with your parents
until you're 42?
What's more financially deplet
ing than a charge account at Guc
ci?
What's the toughest job you'll
ever love? (And I don't mean the
Peace Corps.)
Having a kid!
I would really like to know what
was going through Christina
LoCasto's mind when she aban
doned her baby on that United
Airlines flight last week.
What was so scary about
keeping the child that she had to
risk everything in order to get rid
of it? Didn't she remember that
she was not a poor, unwed teen
ager who had never had a baby
before in her life?
But I'm not a parent, so what
do I know?
What I know is that if I had
to read LoCasto's mind, I'd see
something like this train of
thought:
"Let's see... . should I keep the
baby and face a few more bills
and another crying brat on my
hands? Or should I stuff it under
a sink somewhere, risk scorn from
my family and friends when I get
caught and maybe go to
prison. ..."

I figure if I just went through
excruciating labor the kid better
be worth keeping. Oh yes, and I
might remember I love the baby,
too.
Now Christina LoCasto wants
the baby back. 1 can hear her
now: "I knew I should've called
tails instead of heads."
Let's face it. Not everyone is
cut out to be a parent.
How do you know if you have
what it takes? Here are some ways
to find out:
• Imagine yourself at your worst
behavior during your adolescent
years. Now picture yourself with
a child at that age who acts the
exact same way — but worse.
If you can imagine re-living it,
figuring you probably won't end
up in a hospital, you're a good
candidate for parenthood.
• Volunteer to work at a day care
center for six months to a year.
If you can take care of more than
six restless kids at one time, you
can certainly handle one of your
own.
On the other hand, you proba
bly don't want to become a parent
right away when these conditions
describe you:
• If you believe the Cosby Show
is for real. (Dads never raise their

voices. Kids never do anything il
legal.)
• If your priorities in life are 1)
getting 2 MBAs 2) buying 4 BMWs
3) moving up to VP of IBM 4)
having a kid. In that order.
• If you believe the old parental
line "Do as I say, not as I .dp"
really works.
There are, of course, no instruc
tion guides on How To Be A Par
ent. Some people are better at it
than others, though.
The people who are better at it
treat their children as unique in
dividuals, not as carbon copies of
themselves.
They realize that kids are not
merchandise, and they do not
come with lifetime warranties.
And most of all, they know the
true meaning of unconditional
love.
