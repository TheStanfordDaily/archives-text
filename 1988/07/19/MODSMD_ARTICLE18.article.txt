# Minority opinions can be misleading
## 
### 
For several months now, The
Daily has published viewpoints
from members of minority com
munities on issues relating to
their interactions with "whites."
I belong to an ethnic minority,
and I agree with virtually none
of the minority stands expressed
lately in The Daily.
I think most of them have
contributed further to the ten
sion between majority and mi
nority students, instead of elimi
nating it. And it has happened
largely as a result of emotional
expressions from a few individ

uals who lost sight of (or didn't
care about) the fact that they
may lead to increased social
antagonism between the groups.
Expression of opinion from
individuals belonging to a group
can profoundly affect the per
ception of the group by society
as a whole. This power of per
sonal expression carries with it
a responsibility to the group it
represents. Irresponsible
generalizations of personal opin
ion can lead to inaccurate, and
sometimes negative stereotypes.
When I walk through the
Quad, I wouldn't want people to
look at my dark skin and think
that I am more comfortable
about the "Black by Popular
Demand" shirts than I am

about the "Aryan by the Grace
of God" ones, or that I like the
idea of a minority graduate
student clubhouse just because
some minority concerns commit
tee feels that we want one.
These are things that only
serve to polarize and segregate
the campus, and we don't need
any more of that. It is an opin
ion that might fall outside of
the realm of common minority
expression, but not necessarily
outside the realm of common
minority thinking.
For those of you who find
yourselves forming opinions on
"minorities" based on public
expressions, it is important to
realize that we are diverse
within the group, as we all are

within society.
