# Stanford researchers update space shuttle technology

While engineers at the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida struggle with a fuel leak
in the space shuttle Discovery, 13 profes
sors and their students here at Stanford
have developed a computerized system that
will enable NASA engineers to spend more
time researching — and less time repairing.
Stanford workers recently developed an
automated system that inspects the space
shuttle's heat shield tiles. While this inno
vation won't save the Sept. 6 launch date
of Discovery, it may speed up repair time
in the future.
The Associated Press reported yesterday
that a fuel leak may delay the launch of
Discovery by up to two months. In the
past, tile problems have plagued shuttle
launches.
Previously, each of the 31,000 heat shield
tiles, which protect the shuttle from ignit
ing as it travels through the atmosphere,
were individually inspected to ensure that
none were damaged or in the wrong posi
tion.
Through a research agreement with
NASA, Stanford workers have employed
voice-recognition computers, lasers and
other new equipment to speed up the old
process.
Shocked by how outdated NASA's tech
nology was, University Research Assoc. Mi
chael Wiskerchen established the research
agreement between Stanford and the space
center in 1987. The computerised process

for inspecting tiles is the first product to
arise from the agreement.
NASA's computer system "was 15 years
back," according to Wiskerchen — a former
NASA administrator who was chief scientist
for the ninth space shuttle mission.
According to Wiskerchen, the tile inspec
tion system was outdated because NASA
tends to get lost in its bureaucracy. For
example, it can often take three years to
get approval for a project, five years for
the building and eight for implementation.

NASA employees are un
der too much daily stress,
Wiskerchen said. They can
not keep up with current
research and write project
proposals that are often
statements of "accum
ulated ignorance," he
added.
To put NASA back on
the cutting edge of re-

search, Wiskerchen said he wanted to create
a program that would educate NASA per
sonnel and involve University scholars.
As a result of Wiskerchen's efforts, Stan
ford researchers now bypass much of
NASA's bureaucracy and are working on
several space programs — including the
space shuttle tile project.
With Stanford's new project, space
shuttle inspectors can now verbally
describe the location and possible damage
on each tile to computers. The computer
