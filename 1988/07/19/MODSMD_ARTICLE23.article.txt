Drunk with Love
A book of stories by Ellen Gilchrist
Little, Brown and Co., 1986
$7.95
An elderly woman who mail-orders "one
nice young man; color: white" from an L.L.
Bean catalogue, a beautiful and pragmatic
young woman with a talent for show tunes
and holding up banks, an overweight 31
year old whose diet drives her to suicide
in a story grimly titled "The Last Diet" —
such are the characters who pour out of
Ellen Gilchrist's newest book of short
stories, "Drunk With Love".
The new collection of short stories
succeeds Gilchrist's earlier book, "Victory
Over Japan", which introduced us to this
manic, predominantly southern world.
Gilchrist again arranges her stories into
four sections, but this time groups them
by theme rather than by character.
The result is potent: the book makes its
points with fierce economy. Gilchrist does
not rush, but she does not waste time
either; her stories flow with disarming ease
into one's consciousness and give no warn
ing of their inevitable jdt.
In "Drunk With Love", Gilchrist picks
and chooses characters from the "Victory
Over Japan" set. She extends the lives of
some — Nora Jane now appears pregnant
and in California — and alters those of
others — Rhoda is no longer a sexually
absorbed independent writer but a sexually
absorbed wife and mother of two (and
counting). Other characters have disap
peared altogether.
In their places come new, sharply drawn,
deeply disturbing characters. We meet Mae
Lauer Cheene, an idealistic German-
American woman who has just returned
from the Peace Corps to her home town
in Nebraska: "a city that wanted to be
good, had done good, and was going to
keep on doing good."

Her masochistic drive towards self
sacrifice leads her into a fatal marriage
with a passionately bitter Lebanese emigre.
He beats her methodically, injuring her
three times and killing her the fourth.
Similarly disturbing is Gilchrist's story
"Memphis." Baby Kate is a young white
woman out to test the integrity of her
pseudo-liberal father. She is, as her aunt
Allie succinctly remarks, "doing it with the
biggest black man who ever stood guest in
our entrance hall."
Baby Kate's father is furious but she
marries her lover anyway, staying with

him even after he begins to beat her. She
declares to the shocked southern town, "I
am his wife. I am going to sleep where he
is every night of my life. ... I am married
to him. I am his woman."
Her prophecy fulfills itself, for her life
ends abruptly when her husband crushes
her to death in his arms. When a stranger
standing in front of the house asks her
distraught aunt whether the neighborhood
is a bad one, she replies puzzledly "I don't
know.... I'm sorry. I just don't know."
In this way moral questions are repeat
edly raised and left unanswered. Actions
are driven by boredom, and ethical judge-

Gilchrist does not rush, but
she does not waste time,
either; her stories flow with
disarming ease into one's
consciousness and give no
warning of their inevitable
jolt.

ments are merely the result of a warped
society's consensus.
Gilchrist is a natural story teller and an
exuberant one; her stories overflow with
an ease and assurance that is viscerally
pleasant. Her themes tire those we've come
to recognize as particularly southern:
boredom, racial conflicts, alcoholism and
violence. In no way, however, should she
be confined to the regionalist writer cate
gory; she also addresses universal themes
of familial conflict, puberty, marriage and
death.
Aunt Allie remarks, "This is the real
story. Of whiskey and slaves and bored
women and death. Two hundred years of

slavery and still paying for it." Gilchrist
relays this "real story" oeautifully, main
taining a critical balance of empathy and
detachment. She neither belittles this dark
world of "whiskey and slaves," nor drags
her readers through the angst of its sor
didness. "Drunk With Love" is a delight,
and Gilchrist enjoys it with the rest of us.

And a Voice to Sing With
An Autobiography by Joan Baez
New American Library, 1987
$8.95
Few Stanford students probably realize
that singer and activist Joan Baez took her
first political stand as an eleventh grader
at Palo Alto High School in the 19505.
After it was announced that in coming
days there would be an air raid drill in
which students were supposed to calmly
walk home before a nuclear attack, Baez
set out to confirm a sinking suspicion.
In her newly released biography, "And
a Voice to Sing With", Baez writes that
she looked in physics books that belonged
to her father — who was then a professor
at Stanford — and learned that an im
pending nuclear onslaught would leave no
time for a calm walk home.
Days later, in protest of "misleading
propaganda," Baez refused to leave her
seat during the drill.
The event proved only a springboard for
the girl who was to become one of the
most outspoken political activists — and
one of the most popular folksingers — of
the next decade.
In a very personal memoir, Baez takes
the reader on a winding path not only
through her adolescence but into the heady
days of free living in the '60s and down
the road to her busy, reflective Kfe today,

in the "me-first" era of young profes
sionalism.
But getting there is the fun part; Baez
is a woman who has enjoyed life in all its
manifestations. As a result, she has created
a book that is as entertaining as it is
revelatory.
From her rise to fame as a beatnik
folksinger in small clubs at Harvard
Square, to the many men who have become
lovers, to the wild week-long party that
was Woodstock, to the long affair she had
with another woman — Baez has loved the
good times and the bad.
Most important perhaps is that she
doesn't divvy up this story of her life in
these two categories. For Baez the positive
and negative in life are inextricably tied
together.

Baez has created a book
that is as entertaining as
it is revelatory.

The charge that powers her onstage, for
example, is linked to the persistent bouts
of anxiety that often leave her doubled up
in fear and pain on the floor of her dressing
room.
The struggle of her divorce came from
the same union that gave her a son as
well as the inspiration to campaign for
draft resistance with her husband during
the war.
In the same way she avoids conventional
"good" and "bad" divisions, Baez is
similarly not bound by the confines of a
strict chronology in her book.
Meandering in a general direction from
childhood to middle age, the singer skips
easily from reporter-like description, to
first-person storytelling, to addressing
people directly. In letters written to them,
Baez settles scores and pays tribute to

several frienda, including fellow folkster
Bob Dylan and members of her family.
Despite the changing tone of the narra
tion, the book never becomes confusing.
The singer's story retains a refreshing el
ement of surprise in jumping from one
section to the next.

Written in an uninhibited style reminis
cent of the era for which she is famous,
Baez's book offers a captivating historical
perspective of a time period that has re
cently recalled the nation's attention.
More importantly, however, it captures
the unusual blend of Baez's sheer fearless
ness and raw vulnerability — a combina
tion of which many of today's younger
women should be envious.

A Batch of Pym: Excellent Women, A
Glass of Blessings and The Sweet Dove
Died
Perennial Library
$7.95
Barbara Pym'a fiction is delightful and
addictive. I first read Pym for a class last
quarter and now cannot stop. Her well
crafted stories convey the minor traumas
of twentieth century existence with humor
and eloquence. Her irresistibility comes
despite unpromising subject material: the
rather grey lives of middle-aged, middle
class inhabitants of London.
She describes the petty longings and
satisfactions that make monotony tolerable
in a tone that never turns acid or sen
timental. Her wit is perfectly tuned and
rarely misses.
Details assume tremendous significance
in the world of Pym. The change of seasons
and even the passing of day into night are
marked with mood shifts that seem almost
heroic. The reckless abandonment inherent
in the purchase of spring mimosa and the
melancixjly induced by their wilting leave
the reader surprisingly moved.
Like Pym's characters, we relish the
minor triumphs and dwell on the small
sadnesses: our immersion in the lives of
the characters implicates us. The comedy
takes hold when we realize how petty many
of these conflicts really are.
In her novels the big issues like birth,
sex and death are hidden by the formalities
that surround them. At the root of Pym's
humor lies an inversion of the expected
order: the magnification of the everyday
and the reduction of the monumental.
"Excellent Women" explores the church
bound world of Mildred Lathbury, whose
perceptive eye and loneliness make her a
quintessential Pym heroine. Mildred, a
woman approaching old maid status and
already "kept among the rows of excellent
women," busies herself with household
chores, the Society for Bereaved
Gentlewomen and, most importantly, the
Anglican Church. Helping aristocrats in
reduced circumstances and planning tag
sales for charity occupies most of her day,
if not her mind.

When Rocky Napier, a dashing young
man fresh from a stint in the Navy, moves
into a neighboring apartment with his
anthropologist wife, Mildred betrays her
status as an "excellent woman" and falls
in love. The relationship is, to say the least,
improbable, but she flirts with eagerness,
even attending a horrendously boring meet
ing on anthropology.
Subplots revolve arcund this story like
moons around Jupiter. Indeed, all three
novels display a startling intricacy of
design: characters from different episodes
are woven together by memory and coin
cidence. Pym resembles an alchemist in
her ability to spin tales of insight, wit and
pathos out of ordinary lives — even the
lives of excellent women.
"A Glass of Blessings" concerns another
lonely woman eager for love, only Rowena,
unlike Mildred, is married. Her civil servant
husband, Rodney, has apparently settled
down to an office routine and leaves her
alone all day. Love is hidden from Rowena
and her attempts to find it are funny and
touching.
In"The Sweet Dove Died" Pym takes a
darker look at the limits of love. Wealthy,
single and middle-aged, Leonora Price col
lects Victoriana for her apartment. At a
rare book auction she meets the antique
dealer Humphrey Boyce and his nephew,
Paul. Courted by the uncle, she loves the
son, blanketing the younger man with af
fection and gifts.
His infidelities wound her proud spirit
and she breaks down when he moves in
with his male lover. A summary makes the
book sound much racier than it really is
— under Pym the plot proceeds gently,
almost mournfully, to a bitter conclusion.
Philip Larkin, the poet laureate of Eng
land, has called Pym "the most underrated
writer of our century." Amid the great
convulsions of twentieth century literature
it is easy to miss Barbara Pym. But it is
a mistake. She is sensitive to lives of quiet
despair, and mature enough to find humor
in them.
