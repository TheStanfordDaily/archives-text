Drunk with Love
A book of stories by Ellen Gilchrist
Little, Brown and Co., 1986
$7.95
An elderly woman who mail-orders "one
nice young man; color: white" from an L.L.
Bean catalogue, a beautiful and pragmatic
young woman with a talent for show tunes
and holding up banks, an overweight 31
year old whose diet drives her to suicide
in a story grimly titled "The Last Diet" —
such are the characters who pour out of
Ellen Gilchrist's newest book of short
stories, "Drunk With Love".
The new collection of short stories
succeeds Gilchrist's earlier book, "Victory
Over Japan", which introduced us to this
manic, predominantly southern world.
Gilchrist again arranges her stories into
four sections, but this time groups them
by theme rather than by character.
The result is potent: the book makes its
points with fierce economy. Gilchrist does
not rush, but she does not waste time
either; her stories flow with disarming ease
into one's consciousness and give no warn
ing of their inevitable jdt.
In "Drunk With Love", Gilchrist picks
and chooses characters from the "Victory
Over Japan" set. She extends the lives of
some — Nora Jane now appears pregnant
and in California — and alters those of
others — Rhoda is no longer a sexually
absorbed independent writer but a sexually
absorbed wife and mother of two (and
counting). Other characters have disap
peared altogether.
In their places come new, sharply drawn,
deeply disturbing characters. We meet Mae
Lauer Cheene, an idealistic German-
American woman who has just returned
from the Peace Corps to her home town
in Nebraska: "a city that wanted to be
good, had done good, and was going to
keep on doing good."

Her masochistic drive towards self
sacrifice leads her into a fatal marriage
with a passionately bitter Lebanese emigre.
He beats her methodically, injuring her
three times and killing her the fourth.
Similarly disturbing is Gilchrist's story
"Memphis." Baby Kate is a young white
woman out to test the integrity of her
pseudo-liberal father. She is, as her aunt
Allie succinctly remarks, "doing it with the
biggest black man who ever stood guest in
our entrance hall."
Baby Kate's father is furious but she
marries her lover anyway, staying with

him even after he begins to beat her. She
declares to the shocked southern town, "I
am his wife. I am going to sleep where he
is every night of my life. ... I am married
to him. I am his woman."
Her prophecy fulfills itself, for her life
ends abruptly when her husband crushes
her to death in his arms. When a stranger
standing in front of the house asks her
distraught aunt whether the neighborhood
is a bad one, she replies puzzledly "I don't
know.... I'm sorry. I just don't know."
In this way moral questions are repeat
edly raised and left unanswered. Actions
are driven by boredom, and ethical judge-

Gilchrist does not rush, but
she does not waste time,
either; her stories flow with
disarming ease into one's
consciousness and give no
warning of their inevitable
jolt.

ments are merely the result of a warped
society's consensus.
Gilchrist is a natural story teller and an
exuberant one; her stories overflow with
an ease and assurance that is viscerally
pleasant. Her themes tire those we've come
to recognize as particularly southern:
boredom, racial conflicts, alcoholism and
violence. In no way, however, should she
be confined to the regionalist writer cate
gory; she also addresses universal themes
of familial conflict, puberty, marriage and
death.
Aunt Allie remarks, "This is the real
story. Of whiskey and slaves and bored
women and death. Two hundred years of

slavery and still paying for it." Gilchrist
relays this "real story" oeautifully, main
taining a critical balance of empathy and
detachment. She neither belittles this dark
world of "whiskey and slaves," nor drags
her readers through the angst of its sor
didness. "Drunk With Love" is a delight,
and Gilchrist enjoys it with the rest of us.

And a Voice to Sing With
An Autobiography by Joan Baez
New American Library, 1987
$8.95
Few Stanford students probably realize
that singer and activist Joan Baez took her
first political stand as an eleventh grader
at Palo Alto High School in the 19505.
After it was announced that in coming
days there would be an air raid drill in
which students were supposed to calmly
walk home before a nuclear attack, Baez
set out to confirm a sinking suspicion.
In her newly released biography, "And
a Voice to Sing With", Baez writes that
she looked in physics books that belonged
to her father — who was then a professor
at Stanford — and learned that an im
pending nuclear onslaught would leave no
time for a calm walk home.
Days later, in protest of "misleading
propaganda," Baez refused to leave her
seat during the drill.
The event proved only a springboard for
the girl who was to become one of the
most outspoken political activists — and
one of the most popular folksingers — of
the next decade.
In a very personal memoir, Baez takes
the reader on a winding path not only
through her adolescence but into the heady
days of free living in the '60s and down
the road to her busy, reflective Kfe today,
