## Sophie's Choice: continental cuisine with character

Sophie's Choice, located on
Emerson between Hamilton and
Forest, does not have Meryl
Streep. What it does have is a
delectable selection of French
specialities stongly influenced by
nouvelle cuisine.

Sophie herself prepares an im
pressive variety of dishes, ranging
from punchy dd French favorites
like rabbit in Dijon sauce to more
delicate dishes like pinguini pasta.
We started with a generous por
tion of house pate, elegantly
served against a leaf of lettuce.
Coarse and peppery, it went
beautifully with the fresh French
bread and the Cabernet wine our
waiter had recommended.
Next we proceeded to a scallops
mousse, a somewhat less exciting
choice. While the taste was pleas
ing, the consistency was a little
thin. Accompanying this second
appetizer was a decent Sauvignon
Blanc.
Each entree comes with a choice
of soup or salad. The day we were
there, Sophie offered both a hot
and a cold soup: a hot squash and
a cold fruit/wine concoction. We
sampled and enjoyed both; Sophie
obviously devotes much of her
love and attention to this part of
the menu. The fruity, refreshingly
cold soup was perfect for a sum
mer night and the hot squash
soup was a true masterpiece of

The wonderful soups were a fit

true stars of the evening. Sophie
graciously allowed us to sample
three: a grilled Petaluma duck
with honey and served with
plums, a rabbit sauteed in Dyon
sauce, and veal sweetbreads
prepared with port wine.
If one must make distinctions
in a world of sustained greatness,
then the duck would be declared
king of the meal. It was fresh and
succulent, simultaneously sweet

and tart. Somehow, Sophie had
managed to get rid of all the fat
tiness usually associated with
duck, while retaining the bird's
natural moistness.
The rabbit and sweetbreads,
though very different, were both
excellent. The rabbit was substan
tial and spicy while the
sweetbreads were tender, juicy
and subtle.
Not surprisingly, our venture
into Sophie's selection of desserts
was somewhat hindered by the
extraordinary amount we had al-

diligently pressed on, sampling the
fresh cheescake and chocolate

The chocolate decadence was rich

five dollars. Wines are reasonably
priced at $3 to $5 a glass and $12
to $30 dollars a bottle. Meat and

expensive. Sophie's divine
desserts are around $5.
