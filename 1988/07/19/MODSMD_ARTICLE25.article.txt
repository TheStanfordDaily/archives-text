Scritti Politti
"Provision"
Helium-vocal and synth-rock
fans rejoice — Scritti Politti is
back and just as hot as before.
After injecting a little soul
into the New Wave genre that
bands like the Pet Shop Boys
have since taken over, Scritti
Politti just vanished off the face
of the modern music scene.
With "Provision," the long
awaited follow-up to the sur
prisingly successful "Cupid and
Psyche '85" album that show
cases the top-10 single "Perfect
Way", this British dance duo
has re-established itself as the
primary purveyor of prettily
produced ear candy, providing
an 11-song meal of musically
insubstantial but consistently
enjoyable fare.
Just as with the first two
Scritti Politti releases, the
music here centers around
lyricist Green Gartside's lilty,
smooth vocals that scrape the
upper limits of the treble clef,
backed with snappy synthesizer
shots and the punchy percus

sion of arranger David Gam
son. This time around, how
ever, Gamson and Gartside
opted to take production en
tirely in their own hands, as
well as infusing the tunes with
more of a funky feeling than
the reggae-flavored "Cupid."
The result is ... well, an
other "Cupid." Like its
predecessor, "Provision" is zip
py, ecstatic and energetic from
note one and maintains the en
joyment level all the way
through. "Boom! There She
Was," the album opener and
first single, has the infectuous
appeal that launched "Perfect
Way" up the charts, encourag
ing feet to tap without demand
ing conscious minds to engage
in any serious cognition.
The real joy, however, comes
from a most unlikely place
called "Patti (Don't Feel Sorry
For Loverboy)." Not as exciting
as the typical dance fare, this
tune is lifted off of the floor by
the crisp muted trumpet solo by
legendary jazz explorer Miles
Davis.
Davis included his own rendi
tion of "Perfect Way" on his
album "Tutu," which is proba

bly the reason for his cameo
appearance on "Patti"; what
ever the cause, it is the listeners'
gain, as even the re-mix simply
soars thanks to his contribution.
All in all, "Provision" is a
pretty decent effort, though not
a masterpiece warranting the
three-year hiatus. If something
light and enjoyable sounds ap
pealing, the record is a "perfect
way" to augment an afternoon
of summer fun.
