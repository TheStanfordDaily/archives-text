# U.S. spikers thrash S. Korea
## Stanford graduate Root dominates in match Saturday 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Showing it is not only the best
team in the world but also one
of the deepest, the U.S. men's
national volleyball team defeated
the national team from South
Korea 15-3, 15-11, 15-17, 15-9
Saturday night in Berkeley's Har
mon Gym.
Coach Marv Dunphy used 12 of
13 healthy players as the Ameri
cans ran their 1988 record to 34-4.
The United States has been atop
the volleyball world since 1984
and became only the second team
ever to win the "triple crown" of
international volleyball, taking
the Olympics in 1984, the World
Cup in 1985 and the World Cham
pionships in 1986 (the Soviet Un
ion won the three quadrennial
events in 1980-1982).
Stanford graduate Jon Root,
Class of 1986, led the way for the

hosts. Filling in for Steve Tim
mons on this five-stop tour with
the Koreans, Root showed the
United States loses little even
with the world's best hitter rest
ing his injured elbow on the bench.
Root recorded kills on each of
his first seven swings in the match
and was a consistent force hitting
from both the front and back row.
The match also showcased Car
dinal senior Scott Fortune and
Root's classmate Chris Braun.
Fortune, who stopped out this
past year in an effort to make the
Olympic team, received consider
able playing time at middle
blocker as Dunphy rested veter
ans Craig Buck and Doug Partie.
Braun also played in the middle
throughout the third game.
The Koreans looked flat in the
first game, but rebounded to make
the Americans work to end the
match. With an improved block
and a never-say-die attitude, the

visitors frustrated the United
States by digging everything to
scrap to a third-game win. Finally,
though, the Americans' power and
the Koreans' passing problems
gave the home team the win in
the stifling Harmon heat.
Dunphy has only a few more
weeks to decide how to trim his
15-man roster to the 12 who will
travel to Seoul, but most of the
spots are just about taken. Buck,
the quickest and most agile 6-
foot-8 man in America not named
Magic, is a sure starter in the
middle, while Fortune appears to
be gaining on Partie for the other
starting spot.
Braun is battling Jeff Wells and
Mark Miller for the fourth middle
blocker spot on the roster, but he
lacks their experience. Wells, who
missed this trip due to a severely
sprained ankle, and Miller have
been with the team since 1985,
but a coach has to like Braun's
athleticism and 42-inch vertical
leap (he has hit his head on a
basketball rim).
Karch Kiraly and Bob Ctvrtlik,
both All-World selections in 1986,
will share the passing respon
siblities and will be backed up by
sometime started Dave Saunders
and Root. Newcomer Troy Tanner
looks like the odd man out at this
spot, even though he has the abil
ity to become a starter by 1990.
Jeff Stork and Ricci Luyties are
the setters and digmaster Eric
Sato (a 5-11 wonder with Spud
Webb's springs) will likely make
the team to back them up, while
Timmons will play right-side.
All in all, it looks like at least
two Cardinal will be going to
Seoul, with Braun a possible
third. Furthermore, Stanford
men's Coach Fred Sturm has been
traveling with the team as an ad
viser and may go to the Olympics.
Kim Oden, a 1986 graduate and
the captain of the U.S. women's
team, also adds to the Stanford
contingent, showing this Northern
California school is doing just fine
in keeping up with its Southern
California rivals.
