# Stanford rejects chance to host '94 World Cup
##

Although Stanford has hosted such high
profile events as the Olympic Soccer Games
in 1984 and the Superbowl in 1985, Uni
versity officials silenced rumors yesterday
that Stanford is in the running to sponsor
the 1994 World Cup Soccer Tournament.
The International Soccer Federation is
currently looking at 18 possible cites for
the games — including Pasadena's Rose
Bowl Stadium and the Los Angeles
Memorial Collesium.
But Stanford is not included in the list
because University officials were dis
satisfied with the United States Soccer Fed
eration's preliminary scheduling and finan
cial plans, according to Gary Bruener, a
marketing director for the Athletic Depart
ment.
The World Cup has never before been
held outside of Europe or South America.
Two weeks ago, the International Fed-

The USSF wanted Stanford
Stadium for four months
even though the tournament
only lasts for 30 days.

eration accepted the USSF's proposal for
hosting the tournament — but Stanford
was not on the USSF's list of prospective
World Cup sites. When, in 1986, the USSF
asked Stanford to participate in the selec
tion process, University officials rejected
the offer.
"The terms of the contract were too
vague," Bruener said, noting that the USSF
wanted Stanford's stadium for four months
even though the tournament only
lasts for 30 days.
Furthermore, Stanford could
not comply with the USSF's re
quest to reserve its stadium from
May to August because during
those months track meets, Com
mencement and summer pro
grams take place, Bruener said.
He also said the financial terms

of the contract were unclear and
did not seem to benefit Stanford
as much as the USSF.
"Financially the contract
seemed to favor the USSF," he
said.
Despite Stanford's refusal to
take part in the selection process,
Bruener added that Stanford still
has a chance to reenter the bid
ding.
"Things could change in the
next six years, we'll see what hap
pens," Breuner said. "It would be

a great event but it certainly
would have to fit into our plans."
It is now up to the University
or a third party group to initiate
a proposal, according to a USSF
official. For example, a Bay Area
committee, not affiliated with
Stanford, brought the Superbowl
here in 1985.
But Breuner was firm that the
University will not submit its own
proposal for sponsoring the event.
"We're simply not in the busi
ness of promoting international
sporting events. We are a univer
sity first and we have an obliga
tion to our own continuing pro
grams," he said.
However, Men's Varsity Soccer
Coach Sam Koch said the World
Cup's coming to Stanford could
benefit his programs by exposing
University athletes to interna
tional competition.
According to Koch, Stanford's
facilities are more than adequate
for hosting the tournament. "The
fact that we held the Olympics
proved that we have the facilities
and then some," he said.

Stanford Stadium hosted some Olympic soccer games without a
hitch in 1984, yet plans to host the 1994 World Cup games here ran
into insurmountable scheduling problems.
