# National Medal of Science
## Three given coveted honor 
### Mike Horelick 
Three Stanford scholars — economist
Milton Friedman, geneticist Stanley Cohen
and mathematician Joseph Keller — were
awarded the coveted National Medal of Sci
ence by President Reagan at the White
House Friday, July 15.
The Stanford researchers were among
30 recipients chosen as leaders in the fields
of science and technology for 1988 by the
President's Committee for the National
Medal of Science.
Each award winner receives a large
bronze medal and a small gold replica of
the medal from the President. Sponsored
by the National Science Foundation, the
Medal of Science is a non-monetary award.
Since the award's inception in 1962, 245
medals have been awarded in the science
category. Another 33 have been given out
in the technology division, which was set
up in 1985.
Notable past winners of the award in
clude Stanford Nobel Prize chemist Linus
Pauling and Apple computer gurus Steven
Jobs and Steven Wozniak.
In only the second year the award has
been won by an economist, President
Reagan honored Friedman, a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover Institution and
a member of his Economic Policy Board.
Both Stanford and Harvard had three
researchers who were among the Medal of
Science winners. However, Friedman noted
that Stanford might not want to claim his

medal as an award for the University be
cause of his association with the Hoover
Institution, rather than a department of
the University.
A 1976 Nobel Prize winner in economics,
the White House lauded Friedman for his
contributions to the field of economics and
for research in "problems critical to the
nation in general."
Although Friedman has served as an ad
viser to Reagan for several years, he said
he believes politics does not play a
role in the decision process. According to
Friedman, the panel that chooses award
winners is not political and he pointed out
that many 1988 recipients are Democrats.
Geneticist Cohen, a professor of medicine
and genetics at the Medical School, said he
was "surprised and pleased" to discover
that he was chosen for the Medal of Science.

invented the basic process of gene
splicing that pioneered genetic en
gineering research. In addition to
the National Medal of Science,
Cohen and Boyer recently won the
new Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuit
ton Prize given by the Institut de
la Vie in Paris.

Mathematics Prof. Keller was
honored for his invention of the
Geometrical Theory of Diffrac
tion. The theory, which solves
problems concerning waves, has
been successfully applied in optics,
radar and sonar.
Keller, who received the medal
in person from President Reagan,
said, "I was struck by the fact
that this award got very little
publicity." He said he believes
more publicity should be given to
scientific discovery in order to at
tract more young people to dif
ferent fields in science.
