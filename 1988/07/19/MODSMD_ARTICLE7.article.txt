# Hot as Hades

### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
One day does not a heat wave make, but the
scorching temperatures Sunday and the "cool" 90
degree temperatures that followed yesterday com
bined to bake Stanford and the rest of the Bay Area.
The National Weather Service registered a record
tempo'ature of 105 degrees at Moffett Field Sunday
and a high of 107 in Redwood City. The MofTett
temperature shattered the previous record of 89
degrees set in 1961.
San Francisco reached 103 degrees Sunday, the
hottest temperature on record since officials began
keeping track 125 years ago. The previous all-time
high for San Francisco was 102 degrees, set Oct. 5,
1987.
Even shady spots didn't provide relief from th<»
heat, as the Palo Alto Fire Department reported a
higher than usual number of heat-related first aid
calls. In the Stanford area, life slowed down and
many students flocked to the coast to escape 100-
plus degree temperatures inland.
According to National Weather Service Forecaster
Mike Smith, forecasters got what they expected
Monday — "a whole lot of cooling."
He added that the cooling trend that began Mon
day should continue today and tomorrow. In fact,
coastal fog is forecast to reduce coastal highs to
the low 60s later this week.
The high temperatures high
lighted concerns that the earth's
temperatures may be increasing
because of deterioration of the
ozone layer. But Smith said there
is "no way we can tell" if the
recent hot weather is a result of
this "greenhouse effect."
It is typical for the Bay Area
to experience very warm days dur
ing the summer, Smith said, but
noted that Sunday's high temper
atures were well out of the ordi
nary range.
Smith attributed the unusually
high mercury readings to a high
pressure ridge over the West
Coast that is funneling hot air
from Central California to the
west.
Palo Alto Fire Department
Capt. Dick Geranucci said the de
partment "did have a lot of first
aid calls yesterday (Sunday)."
Geranucci added that "normally
we have one [heat related call] a
week if that," but three calls for
heat stroke were taken on Sunday
alone. The cooler temperatures
Monday reduced the number of
heat stroke calls, he said.
In order to avoid heat stroke,
Geranucci suggested that "it is
best to curtail some of your ac
tivity, pull back and don't exert
yourself' during periods of hot
weather.
