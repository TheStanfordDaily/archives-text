# Japanese entry won't threaten U.S. research independence

A predicted wave of Japanese corpora
tions entering U.S. research universities
will not threaten the independence of
scholars at Stanford, according to profes
sors in the School of Engineering.
Although an article in the July 11 issue
of Business Week said Japanese corpora
tions have emerged as the largest source
of foreign research funding in universities
nationwide, Japanese companies do not ap
pear to influence the direction of research
at Stanford.
"Seldom does a [Japanese company]
bring in money to the research activity,"
said Electrical Engineering Prof. Tony
Siegman. "The most common situation is
that a fellowship will help pay for a re
searcher's salary, but not add to the fac

ulty's program or help start any new pro
gram."
According to the Business Week article,
a Japanese-endowed chair by Hitachi
America Ltd. in the School of Engineering
may give Hitachi the right to choose how
the money they donate will be spent. Yet,
Dwain Fullerton, associate dean for the
School of Engineering said this is not true.
"It is up to the dean and the board to
decide which professor receives the gift,"
Fullerton said. "He then has no responsi
bility to the company and his research is
not confidential."
In addition, Fullerton said U.S.-endowed
chairs in the School of Engineering out
number those from all other countries. The
money for the chair "is only a philanthropic
gift — no more, no less."
"As for researchers, all arrangements
have to go through faculty," Fullerton said.

"And the faculty determines its own re
search interest, not the dean or any com
pany."
While Japanese researchers have not
overwhelmed Stanford's laboratories, offi
cials at Bechtel International Center, who
often work with Japanese scholars, said
Japanese companies do sponsor the
majority of Japanese researchers who come
to Stanford.
"Between 50 and 75 percent of Japanese
scholars at Stanford are supported by
Japanese companies," according to Lee
Madden, advisor to foreign scholars at Bech
tel International Center. "I believe the
majority of these people are in the Elec
trical Engineering Department."*
Within the University, the Center for
Integrated Systems — a laboratory that
produces silicon chips — is currently trying
to improve U.S. competition with Japan.

CIS is the only center on campus which
allows researchers to use labs once their
company has contributed money. However,
all of the 20 companies who now have
researchers at CIS are U.S. organizations.
"Japanese companies have contributed
to our office," said John Linvill, director
of CIS. "However we haven't invited them,
as of yet, to do any research here."
"It is true we are seeing much more
interest with Japan but I haven't seen any
large sums of money," Siegman said. "Be
sides there is too much government and
company support in the U.S. that Japanese
companies would need to put in a lot more
money."
According to Siegman, most faculty
members would not allow a foreign country
to control them under any circumstance.
