# Saving lives with Eddie Endo
## Doctors hope dummy will reduce anesthesia-related mishaps 
### Lisa Mackey 
Plastic "Eddie Endo" may just be a
dummy who helps practicing anes
thesiologists at the Stanford Medical Cen
ter, but he will probably save lives by pre
venting anesthesia-related accidents, ac
cording to Eddie's creator, David Gaba.
Gaba, an assistant professor of anes
thesiology at the Medical Center, created
Eddie as a life-like simulator to teach anes
thesiologists and students to handle oper
ating room emergencies.
Gaba said he hopes Eddie will help
prevent some of the 2,000 incidents of death
or brain damage which occur annually as
a result of anesthesia mishaps.
Eddie "lives" without blood, but pulse
and blood pressure readings are simulated
on the screen of a portable computer at
tached to the dummy. Gaba created the
computer program to regulate Eddie's vital
functions.
In addition, carbon dioxide is pumped
into Eddie's lungs from a tank. He also
breathes through an endotracheal tube,
leading from his windpipe to an anesthesia
machine with tanks of oxygen and anes
thetic gases.
The medical students and other partici
pants monitor Eddie's blood pressure,
heartbeat and blood gases during the anes
thesia process. The setup allows Gaba to
create problems during a mock operation
to help participants learn to correct proce
dures in an emergency.
Gaba has also set up an operating room
environment in which students can work

with Eddie. His Comprehensive Anesthesia
Simulation Environment helps medical stu
dents, residents and experienced physicians
practice giving anesthesia in an operating
room atmosphere without risking human
life.
Kristi Peterson, a senior resident in anes
thesiology at the Stanford Medical Center
said seeing herself on video reacting to
emergency situations is the most rewarding
part of training with the dummy.
"The most educational aspect of the
whole simulation process is the tape at this
point," Peterson said.
"Accidents with anesthesia are largely
related to diseases," Gaba said, adding that
many of the operating room problems
which anesthesiologists face originate with
a disease — not the anesthesia.
The majority of operations proceed with
out accidents, but "almost no case goes by
without some problem that is not planned,"
said Gaba, who practices at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Medical Center.
Such minor problems may include a switch
not turned on, an abnormal monitor
reading or a kink in an intravenous line.
Gaba said an accumulation of small prob
lems could lead to a cardiac arrest.
In the future, Gaba said he hopes to use
Eddie as part of a course for practicing
anesthesiologists to help them manage
emergencies. He has applied to the Anes
thesia Patient Safety Foundation for a
grant to maintain the course.
"Regardless whatever causes the signif
icant problem, we will need to respond
quickly and effectively," he said.
