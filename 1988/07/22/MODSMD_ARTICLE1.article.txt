## 
### Eric Richardson Editorial staff 
A Stanford June graduate died
Tuesday when his twin-engine
airplane crashed into a Portola
Valley swimming pool shortly
after 9 p.m.
Edward Paul Nicholson, known
as Buster to his friends, perished
on impact when his Beechcraft
Duchess aircraft plunged into the
pool behind 120 Sausal Drive, ac
cording to the San Mateo County
Sheriffs Department. No pas
sengers were aboard the four-seat
plane.
The mysterious crash took place
less than half a mile from Nichol
sons' summer residence.
Nicholson — who had been
living at the home of friends John
and Margaret Griner at 155 Bear
Gulch Drive in Portola Valley —
flew over the Griner's house
shortly before 9 p.m. on his way
back to Palo Alto Municipal Air
port, Margaret Griner said.
"The engine sounded rough to
me and it was sputtering," ac
cording to Griner, who saw the
plane circle her house "a couple
of times" shortly before the crash.
"It sounded to me like he was in
trouble."

Griner said the circling ap
peared to be nothing out of the
ordinary.
Investigators at the San Jose
office of the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration said they do not yet
know what caused Nicholson's
plane to crash or what happened
during the flight after Nicholson
left Palo Alto Municipal Airport
around 7 p.m. The National
Transportation and Safety Board
is conducting a further investiga
tion.
Although the cabin of the plane
was submerged three feet below
the surface of the pool when in
vestigators arrived, the San Mateo
County Coroners' office confirmed
that Nicholson was killed by the
impact of the crash. A spokesman
at the coroner's office emphasized
that Nicholson did not drown.
Thomas Wittenbrock, the owner
of the house where Nicholson
crashed, made several unsuccess
ful attempts to pull the pilot from
the plane, according to Capt. John
Dellinges of the Woodside Fire De
partment.
"When we arrived on the scene
the homeowner (Wittenbrock) was
half in and half out of the pool,"

Investigators survey the wreckage of Tuesday's plane crash that killed Stanford graduate 'Buster'
Nicholson. Nicholson's hopes for a career as a Navy pilot were cut short when he crashed into a
backyard pool in Portola Valley.
Dellinges said. According to Del
linges, the tail of the plane was
sticking out of the pool and the
engines had broken off both wings
of the aircraft.
Investigators had few ideas
Wednesday and Thursday about
what could have caused the tragic
accident.
Nicholson was an "experienced"
pilot who had been flying for
"about three years," according to
Joe Oram, director of the Palo
Alto-based Sundance Flying Club
where Nicholson learned to fly and
was a member.
Friends who have flown with
Nicholson in the past described
him as a "very conscientious"
pilot. He had planned to join the
Navy for further flight training
this fall and worked at the Palo
Alto Airport.
Griner, who saw the plane just
minutes before the crash, empha
sized that "he was not doing
stunts or acrobatics."
Although investigators at the
San Jose office of the FAA would
not release details of the investi
gation, investigator T.R. Proven
noted that a pilot in such a situ
ation "would not normally be ex
pected to try to land in a pool.
You're better off if you hit dirt
because you'll skip along the top
of it."
Griner said Nicholson had
planned to take a normal two
hour flight. According to the Palo
Alto Municipal Airport, no flight
plan was filed because Nicholson
"was flying local."
"If everyone is patient and waits
for the result of the NTSA inves
tigation, then we can figure it
out," Oram said.
