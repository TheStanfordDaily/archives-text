### Eric Richardson Editorial staff 
A Stanford June graduate died
Tuesday when his twin-engine
airplane crashed into a Portola
Valley swimming pool shortly
after 9 p.m.
Edward Paul Nicholson, known
as Buster to his friends, perished
on impact when his Beechcraft
Duchess aircraft plunged into the
pool behind 120 Sausal Drive, ac
cording to the San Mateo County
Sheriffs Department. No pas
sengers were aboard the four-seat
plane.
The mysterious crash took place
less than half a mile from Nichol
sons' summer residence.
Nicholson — who had been
living at the home of friends John
and Margaret Griner at 155 Bear
Gulch Drive in Portola Valley —
flew over the Griner's house
shortly before 9 p.m. on his way
back to Palo Alto Municipal Air
port, Margaret Griner said.
"The engine sounded rough to
me and it was sputtering," ac
cording to Griner, who saw the
plane circle her house "a couple
of times" shortly before the crash.
"It sounded to me like he was in
trouble."

Griner said the circling ap
peared to be nothing out of the
ordinary.
Investigators at the San Jose
office of the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration said they do not yet
know what caused Nicholson's
plane to crash or what happened
during the flight after Nicholson
left Palo Alto Municipal Airport
around 7 p.m. The National
Transportation and Safety Board
is conducting a further investiga
tion.
Although the cabin of the plane
was submerged three feet below
the surface of the pool when in
vestigators arrived, the San Mateo
County Coroners' office confirmed
that Nicholson was killed by the
impact of the crash. A spokesman
at the coroner's office emphasized
that Nicholson did not drown.
Thomas Wittenbrock, the owner
of the house where Nicholson
crashed, made several unsuccess
ful attempts to pull the pilot from
the plane, according to Capt. John
Dellinges of the Woodside Fire De
partment.
"When we arrived on the scene
the homeowner (Wittenbrock) was
half in and half out of the pool,"
