# Dukakis highlights integrity in nomination speech
## 
### 
ATLANTA — Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, accepting
the presidential nomination of the
Democratic party, yesterday
heaped scorn on the Reagan ad
ministration's performance at
home and abroad, vowed to elim
inate corruption from govern
ment, and pledged to restore "a
new era of greatness to America."
"This election isn't about ideol
ogy. It's about competence," Du
kakis told more than 4,000
banner-waving and cheering Dem
ocrats who jammed Atlanta's
Omni convention hall to the
rafters.
"It's not about overthrowing
governments in Central America;
it's about creating good jobs in
middle America. ... It's not about
meaningless labels. It's about
American values. Old-fashioned
values like accountability and re
sponsibility and respect for the
truth,"he said.
And in a scathing reference to
the role of Vice President George
Bush, his presumed GOP oppon
ent, in the Iran-Contra scandal,
Dukakis declared:

"We're going to have a vice
president who won't sit silently by
when somebody at the National
Security Council comes up with
the cockamamie idea that we
should trade arms to the Ayatollah
for hostages; we're going to have
a vice president named Lloyd
Bentsen who will walk into the
Oval Office and say, 'Mr. Presi
dent, this is nuts."
Dukakis' sharp attacks, coupled
with pledges to help the needy
and disadvantaged by stimulating
a new era of economic progress,
came in a speech prepared for
delivery as he accepted the Dem
ocrats' nomination on the last day
of their 1988 convention here.
Earlier, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, in a speech accepting his
nomination by acclamation for
vice president, repeatedly referred
to "the Reagan-Bush administra
tion" and accused it of following
economic, trade, and energy poli
cies that have "devastated vast
areas of America."
Dukakis, although known for
making relatively unemotional
and impersonal speeches, chose

the most important address of his
political career to launch into a
poignant account of his back
ground as a son of Greek immi
grants, as well as an unusually
passionate portrayal of the issues-
Leaving no doubt that he con
siders corruption, the so-called
"sleaze factor" as a dominant
issue, the Democratic standard
bearer said that "in the Dukakis
White House, as in the Dukakis
State House, if you accept the
privilege of public service, you had
better understand the responsi
bilities of public service."
"If you violate that trust," he
said, "you'll be fired; if you violate
the law, you'll be prosecuted; and
if you sell arms to the Ayatollah,
don't expect a pardon from the
president of the United States."
"One very special goal" for a
Dukakis administration, he said,
is to make Americans "proud of
a government that sets high
standards not just for the Amer
ican people, but high standards
for itself."
