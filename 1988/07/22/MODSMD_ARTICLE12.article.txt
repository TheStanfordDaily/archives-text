### 
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq com
plained yesterday that Iran's
hesitation to agree to face-to-face
talks was endangering efforts to
begin a United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire in the gulf war.
Iraq's Undersecretary of
Foreign Affairs, Wisam al-Zahawi
said that comments by Iran's del
egate to the United Nations that
Iran preferred that the U.N. sec
retary general play a major role
in the talks constituted "a
categorical rejection" of parts of
the cease-fire resolution.
"If the Iranian side refuses
talks with Iraq, with whom does
it want to establish peace?" al-
Zahawi was quoted as saying by
the official Iraqi news agency.
"To say that the Iranians are
ready to cooperate with the sec
retary general while they refuse
direct talks with Iraq means un
willingness to abide by the real
commitments" of the U.N. reso
lution, he said.
The official Iraqi News Agency
said President Saddam Hussein

was astonished that Iran rejected
face-to-face peace talks with Iraq.
The agency said Hussein
stressed the U.N. resolution was
not a temporary formula for a
cease-fire, but part of a
framework for ending the war.
Al-Zahawi's comments did not
mean there was a breakdown in
the private negotiations continu
ing at the U.N. But his remarks
appeared to be a signal to both
Iran and the members of the U.N.
Security Council that Baghdad
still had doubts about Iran's in
tentions in accepting the cease-fire
resolution.
Iraq's foreign minister, Tareq
Aziz, proposed on Wednesday in
a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar that the
Security Council resolution, call
ing for a formal cease fire as well
as an immediate withdrawal of all
forces back to recognized interna
tional borders, go into effect only
after direct talks between Bagh
dad and Tehran.
