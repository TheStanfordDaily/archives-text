North plot suspect denies role
WASHINGTON — A lawyer for Mousa
Hawamda denied yesterday that his client was
involved in an alleged assassination plot against
former White House aide Oliver North and called
allegations that Hawamda, who runs a District
of Columbia travel agency, is a Libyan intelligence
agent "ludicrous."
"I know nothing about" the alleged plot against
North, said attorney Ray Hanna. The allegations
surfaced Wednesday when U.S. Attorney Henry
Hudson asked a federal magistrate in Alexandria,
Va., to detain Hawamda, along with five other
men, without bond on a charge of violating the
administration's trade embargo against Libya.
Hanna described Hawamda, a 42-year-old
naturalized citizen from Jordan who runs the
Manara Travel Agency, as a family man with
two children.
He said that his client was subpoenaed in 1985
before an Alexandria federal grand jury investi
gating allegations that some Libyans here
planned to kill Libyans opposed to the govern
ment of Col. Moammar Gadhafi. No charges were
ever brought.
Hudson declined yesterday to elaborate on his

allegations. The U.S. magistrate in Alexandria
has scheduled a detention hearing for the men
Friday and a grand jury in Alexandria will begin
hearing testimony Monday on the trade embargo
violations and the alleged assassination plan.
MIA remains may be recovered
WASHINGTON — The United States and Viet
nam announced yesterday a joint mission aimed
at recovering the remains of American servicemen
missing in Vietnam, a move that analysts say
could help resolve one of the thorniest issues
dividing the two nations.
The search, expected to focus on 70 high
priority cases of soldiers declared missing-in
action, will begin next month and would be only
the second such effort since U.S. troops pulled
out of Vietnam 13 years ago.
The State Department welcomed the agreement
as an "encouraging development" but downplayed
any broader policy implications. The Reagan ad
ministration has made resolving the fate of MIAs
a key element in any movement toward nor
malization of relations with Vietnam.
