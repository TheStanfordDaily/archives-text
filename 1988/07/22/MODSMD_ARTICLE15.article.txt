## Continue drug tests

Drug tests should
be kept but revised

COLLEGE athletics is
big business in this
country, with incredi
ble monetary incentives
driving coaches and athletes
to win at any cost. In this
environment, there must be
some form of drug testing
to keep competition fair.
In their fight to abolish
the NCAA's drug testing
program in California, Stan
ford is naive to believe a
drug education program
alone — without any testing
— can keep performance
enhancing drugs from
ruining college athletics.
While education about
drugs is essential, the peren
nial scandals involving
crooked coaches and recruit
ing violations demonstrate
the powerful disincentive
that exists for coaches and
athletes to compete fairly.
The fact that the greatest
sporting event in the world
— the Olympics — effec
tively employs a drug test
ing program that tests the
top placers in each event is
evidence that such a pro
gram can work.
In the process of revamp
ing its program, the NCAA
should take a hint from the
Olympics, and test only the
premier athletes or teams
in each sport. Testing com

peting athletes after finals
competition or bowl games,
with subsequent dis
qualification for teams and
athletes that test positive,
should be enough disincen
tive for drug use.
A hard line policy that
would take the laurels away
from victors who use
performance-enhancing
drugs would cause enough
panic to keep college athle
tics clean.
However, the NCAA's
current random drug testing
program is not the answer
and much of it needs to be
reworked.
For example, the NCAA
should stop testing athletes
for drugs not directly
related to competition, such
as marijuana or cold
medicine.
In addition, they must
change the testing proce
dures so they are no longer
a degrading invasion of an
athlete's privacy. Currently,
athletes are forced to
urinate in full view of offi
cials. Other precautions —
such as frisking — could be
used to ensure the integrity
of the tests.
Athletes must remember
that the ability to compete
in the NCAA, like a chance
to compete in the Olympics,
is a privilege.
Drug testing should be
just one of the responsibil
ities athletes must endure
in order to protect them
selves and the integrity of
their games.
