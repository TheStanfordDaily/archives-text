## Reagan got the last laugh 
### 
THERE IS widespread, even
self-congratulatory, agree
ment these days that
liberalism is no longer the dirty
business it used to be. Now that
even Ronald Reagan has proven
himself human (that is, prone to
both mistakes and unpopularity),
it is fashionable to predict that
Michael Dukakis will be the next
man to occupy the White House.
Thinkers of an historicist bent
like to attribute the turnaround
to tides. The electorate is suppos
edly apt to change its political
mood every dozen years or so,
from right to left and back again,
the same way the maple trees
back East change color according
to the seasons. So are we really
due for a sea change?
Not if the president has any
thing to say about it. And he does
— as he has amply shown ever
since the Iran-Contra scandal
broke and he had to start sprint
ing, not merely trotting, to get
the applause.
It suits the president's purpose
just fine for the media to drag in
all its pompous pundits to declare
that the New Liberalism is com
ing. Such smokescreens give him
plenty of room to maneuver be
hind the scenes to make sure his

legacy survives the changes in the
barometer.
The best way to do this is to
pack the Supreme Court with
people who share your ideological
bent. In the past seven years,
Stanford Law has had the dubious
honor of having three of its most
conservative alumni appointed to
the highest court in the land.
Sandra Day O'Connor, William
Rehnquist and Anthony Kennedy
were all appointed to the Supreme
Court under the guise of saving
the laws from the rampant social
tinkering the Warren and Burger
Courts allegedly undertook.
The claim put forward by sup
porters of recent Court decisions
is that they hold true to the
original intent of the framers of
the Constitution, which is one of
the chief tenets Robert Bork
promised to hew to if he were
approved by the Senate. It turns
out that Bork got his platform
for change smuggled into the
Rehnquist chambers without even
trying.
Anthony Kennedy was supposed
to be the great white hope, the
judge who would be the ideal re
placement for the Powell swing
vote.
It turns out now, according to
some minds, that O'Connor is

going to be this Court's swing
vote — a prospect which is enough
to make even the most buoyant
liberal skiffs run aground.
Both Reagan and his late attor
ney general have smiled that
Mona Lisa smile in interview after
interview these past two years,
saying that their rightist agenda
was safe from any prognostica
tions about its imminent demise
the media might make.
When you think about the
finality of a Supreme Court deci
sion, and about the ironic willing
ness of this particular Court to
rummage around and overturn
precedent if it sees a need to, you
begin to realize who's going to
have the last laugh.
And by the way — if the Elec
toral College has anything to do
with it come November, it sure
won't be Michael Dukakis.
