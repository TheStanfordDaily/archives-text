Hope for freedom
lies with Contras
RACHELLE MARSHALL is
characteristically mistaken
in charging that Prof.
Robert Cohn, in advocating aid
to the forces fighting for politi
cal freedom and democracy in
Nicaragua, is calling for support
of "the torturers and killers of
the Somoza dictatorship."
Marshall suffers from defec
tive political vision. In her
myriad of letters to the press,
she never sees "torturers and
killers" in communist forces —
not in Vietnam or Nicaragua or
Cuba or Afghanistan, or in the
terrorist PLO. The truth is the
vast majority of the Contras, as
is evident by their pictures and
reported ages, were obviously
mere children under Somoza.
They are largely made up of
young peasants, workers and a
few students who have fled from
the organized terror of the
avowedly Marxist-Leninist
regime, and of remnants of the
original Sandinista revolution
who have resisted the betrayal
of its democratic ideals by the
well organized communist fac
tion of Ortega and Borge.
Human beings do not risk life
and liberty lightly. The recent
demonstrations of many thou-

sands of citizens in Nandaime
and other cities in which the
defenseless participants were
brutally clubbed, including non
government photographers and
journalists, are evidence of how
widespread and endemic the
discontent is.
The Ortega regime has
shredded the Arias Plan. The
periodic suppression of La
Prensa and the Catholic Radio
Station and street gang attacks
on opposition forces illustrate
the familiar "salami tactics"
which all minority communist
regimes practice in consolidating
their power.
Fearful that the Soviet Union
would withdraw or reduce its
many billions of dollars in sub
sidies to Nicaragua, because of
its own progressively bankrupt
economy, Ortega eased up a bit
the pitch of repression in hope
of getting aid elsewhere. But as
soon as popular opposition in
creased, he reverted to the
familiar techniques of revolu
tionary terrorism. He is still
being armed to the teeth by
Cuba and the Kremlin with
modern weapons and boasts the
largest standing army in Central
America.
In the face of the massive
military and economic support
of Ortega by Cuba, the Soviet
Union and Warsaw Paot satel
lites, the libera] position is up-

held by Robert Cohn, not by
Rachelle Marshall. As John
Stuart Mill once put it:"The
doctrine of nonintervention, to
be a legitimate principle of
morality, must be accepted by
all governments. The despots
must consent to be bound by it
as well as the free states. Un
less they do, the profession of it
by free countries comes to but
this miserable issue, that the
wrong side may help the wrong
side but the right may not help
the right."
Ultimately the hope of peace
and democracy in Nicaragua
rests in the possibility of a free
and fair election with civil
rights guaranteed to all.
If the Ortega dictatorship is
to be prevented from liquidating
by open and concealed terror all
democratic opposition to it, the
Contras should receive whatever
help they need to remain alive
and active until the uncoerced
will of the majority is estab
lished.

Daily's description
was insensitive
Your July 19th issue has a
front page picture of a black
weight-lifter. The text under the

picture states that the medical
student, Riley Williams, clenches
his "pearly whites" for the big
lift.
I think the use of these
words is very insensitive, bor
dering on racism. I believe The
Daily owes Mr. Williams, and
the Stanford community, a
retraction and an apology.
