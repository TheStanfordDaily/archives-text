# Hoover dynasty ends
## Campbell steps down from directorship 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Claiming he felt "as happy
as a clam," Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell announced
yesterday that he is ready to
step down as director.
Speaking at a press confer
ence in the Hoover Memorial
Building, Campbell's an
nouncement marked a sharp
turnaround in the director's at
titude towards his impending
retirement.
When the Stanford Board of
Trustees' decision to retire him
came in May, Campbell said
that, like a warrior, he would
fight to keep his position —
even if it meant filing a lawsuit
against the University.
Earlier this week, Campbell

received a cablegram from
former U.S. President Richard
Nixon congratulating him on
his "fight" against "left wing
liberals."
But yesterday Campbell
spoke more like a peacemaker
than a warrior.
"I'm happy. I'm pleased,"
Campbell said of his decision
to retire when he turns 65 in
April. According to Campbell,
the agreement reached by he
and newly appointed Trustee
President James Gaither met
with his approval and would
satisfy his family as well.
Campbell stressed that while
he would remain active at
Hoover, he would focus his
energies on UC Berkeley, where
he is a member of the Board of
Regents.
Campbell, who was joined by
Gaither and new Chair of the
Hoover Board of Overseers Robert
Malott, made his announcement
after the annual meeting of the
Hoover Board of Overseers.
Malott was elected to his new po
sition at yesterday's meeting.
Gaither declined to comment on
the specifics of Campbell's new
role.
But Gaither did say that Coun
cilor for Life might be Campbell's

new title at Hoover. "It (the title)
is clearly a part of the package,"
Gaither said.
The agreement will also allow
Campbell to continue working
from his same eleventh floor office
at Hoover, Gaither said.
Neither Gaither nor Campbell
would speculate on who the new
director would be.
A search committee will begin
looking for a new director this
fall, and University President
Donald Kennedy will choose from
among the final nominees of the
committee. His choice must be ap
proved by the Hoover Board of
Overseers, the Board of Directors
of the Herbert Hoover Founda
tion and the University trustees.
Campbell will have no say in the

selection process.
"I'm sure I can depend on the
distinguished search committee
and Board of Overseers to pick a
successor who is totally acceptable
to me," Campbell said, adding
that he hopes to retain a strong
influence over Hoover activities.
However, "as far as power goes,
I'm going to transfer it to the
University of California," Camp
bell said.
But according to Malott, Camp
bell will continue to be the driving
force behind Hoover's fundraising
efforts.
"No other (institution) comes
as close as being as well endowed
as Hoover," Malott said, stressing
Campbell's role in raising the
money.
