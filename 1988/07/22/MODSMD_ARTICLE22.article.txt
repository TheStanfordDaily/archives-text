## New X-ray microscope developed 
### Jock Friedly 
Scientists may soon be able to
study the inner workings of live
cells with a desktop X-ray micro
scope, thanks to the work of John
Trail, a graduate student in ap
plied physics.
Currently, biologists must use
X-ray microscopes powered by the
radiation of synchrotrons, which
are giant circular accelerators
available only at a few national
laboratories.
Trail has developed a scanning
microscope that uses another
source, called plasma, to produce
X-rays with a wavelength measur
ing 140 angstroms, a very small
unit of measurement. The micro
scope achieves a resolution of
about 1 micron.
Plasma is a superheated gas of
atomic particles.
Although Trail's microscope
will not be useful to biologists for
several years, the five-foot appa
ratus should eventually be able to
fit in an average-sized lab.
Trail compared his innovation
with the development of the per
sonal computer from the main
frame system. "It's a big first step
in demonstrating that you can
build a scanning X-ray microscope

on a very small scale," Trail said.
The microscope uses a laser to
heat a copper plate so that it turns
to plasma. The excited plasma
emits the X-ray radiation.
According to Trail, synchrotron
microscopes will always have the
advantage of a brighter source of
X-rays. "As a result, they can af
ford more inefficient optics," he
said.
But Trail didn't have such
luxuries.
Despite the fact that only a
small percentage of the radiation
is directed towards the specimen,
Trail's use of precision mirrors
produced a 50 percent reflectivity,
uncharacteristically high for mir
rors used with such short
wavelengths.
The X-rays pass through the
focusing mirrors and then hit the
specimen. The X-rays which filter
through the specimen create the
necessary image.
The laser scans the specimen
with very short bursts of light,
creating one pixel, or dot, on the
output picture for every burst.
Currently, the process takes 15
minutes to create one picture,
however, increasing the repetition
rate of the laser will accelerate
the process. The repetition rate

of Trail's present laser is still
many times slower than what is
currently available.
In addition, it will be several
years before biologists have these
microscopes available in their lab
oratories, according to Trail. The
apparatus, which currently
operates at 140 angstroms, will
have to work at about 40
angstroms before the microscope
can differentiate between water
and protein.
In order to make this differen
tiation, scientists must get the X
ray wavelength into the "water
window," the range between 23
to 44 angstroms where the ab
sorption of X-rays by proteins and
water is vastly different. This will
allow scientists to observe living
cells.
A lower wavelength, however,
means a new level of engineering
problems with the optics, Trail
said.
Perhaps most challenging will
be the development of thinner
layers in the coating of the mir
rors to reflect the shorter
wavelength. The layers must be
made only several atoms thick.
"You're reaching a fundamental
limit there which is the size of
the atom." Trail said.
