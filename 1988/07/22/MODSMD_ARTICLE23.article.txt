# Stanford group teaches English to youth in Asia

David Givens, a 1986 gradu
ate in law and business, teaches
English — In Inner Mongolia.
Based for two years at the
University of Iron and Steel in
Bautou, China. Givens said he
relishes teaching grammar in
the homeland of Genghis Khan.
He moved there after gradua
tion as part of the Volunteers
In Asia program at Stanford.
Givens is one of 50 volunteers
in Asia who are bartering their
mastery of English for immer
sion in another culture. Based
in Taiwan, Indonesia, Japan
and China, VIA participants
live with familes, in boarding
houes, or in college dormitories
while they teach English at lo
cal schools or universities.
Volunteers In Asia sprouted
in the 1960s when a volunteer
service requested 20 college
students to teach English in
Hong Kong. During the 1970s
the program expanded to send
teachers to China, Japan, In
donesia and Taiwan.
This summer, 40 volunteers
from a wide range of majors
left for Asia after six months
of preparation at Stanford and
UC Santa Cruz. Volunteers
with backgrounds in engineer
ing, drama, computer science
and French studied the craft
of teaching English as a second
language before setting out for
another continent and culture.
"We look at it as an educa
tional experience — we feel the
benefits go both ways," said
Rich Walter, associate director
of the program. "They go to

teach English but definitely
gain much more."
VIA receives three applica
tions for every two positions
and accepts an average of 35
to 40 students each year. Close
to two-thirds of the partici
pants are Stanford students.
Volunteers can decide where
they want to go, with a few
restrictions. China, for exam
ple, insists that volunteers be
graduates willing to spend two
years in the country.
"We try to make the best
match between the individual
volunteer and a particular
post," Walter said.
Kathi Golden, a former vol
unteer who now works at VlA's
office in Old Union, said
demand for teachers often
exceeds the numbers VIA has
to offer. For example, she said
the Chinese Ministry of Mining
and Metallurgy requests 100
English teachers a year from
VIA, which can only send 20.
"We don't have enough
funds, manpower or re
sources," Golden said, adding
that "even if we did have those
resources, we wouldn't send
that many volunteers."
Walter said the organization
is supported primarily by
former volunteers, grants from
foundations or corporations
and VlA's own fund-raising ac
tivities.
A series of travel guides writ
ten by volunteers about their
host countries also helps fill the
coffers. Foreign schools and
non-governmental organiza
tions help arrange housing for
the volunteers.
