It's getting hot in Palo Alto.
Last Sunday it was really hot. I was at an outdoor symphony
concert at Frost and found it unbearable. When your Right
Guard melts off your body, its time to get out of the sun.
Don't move — it's the freeze police!
When the sun beats you down, there are only a couple of
choices for things to do. You could head for the freezer. I used
to do this when I worked at Food Service in the summers, until
my manager came looking for the raspberry sherbet.
But if you can't get into your freezer, you can get something
out of it. You can inexpensively make yourself some popsicles
to keep you cool. Remember that cartoon man that taught you
how to tell your mom to pour some grape juice into an icecube
tray with some toothpicks in it for a cold summer treat? Sure
you do, and so does your mom.
Mother knows best
But now that you've grown up, mom's got other ideas. In the
unwritten philosphy of my mother, when it's too hot to ,
go shopping. (Fill in the blank with any appropriate activity.)
Seriously, I hate shopping as much as the Joneses, but
storeowners always keep their room temperatures around a
chilly 68 degrees. Hence, they provide great places to hang out
in when the mercury's a'risin.
For interesting and unique shopping and an enjoyable after
noon, head over to the Allied Arts Guild in Menlo Park, west
of El Camino. The Allied Arts craft shops carry mostly hand-made
goods such as candles, glass-blown miniatures, and the like. A
beautiful and recently resculptured garden winds around the
low Spanish-style buildings that house the goods.
