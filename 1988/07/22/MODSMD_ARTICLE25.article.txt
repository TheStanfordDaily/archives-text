# Thiebaud tempts tastebuds
## Stanford Art Gallery displays mouth-watering exhibit 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
Painter Wayne Thiebaud's
unique flair for depicting colorful
— and seemingly flavorful —
foodstuffs, a task begun in the
early 19605, led to the somewhat
presumptuous labeling of his
work as "Pop Art."
An exhibit of his art, "Wayne
Thiebaud — Works on Paper,
1947-1987," on display at the
Stanford Art Gallery, proves
otherwise. As Thiebaud himself
would assert, his art — a

portrayal of everyday sights and
scenes — concerns itself with the
realist's tradition. Always impor
tant to the artist are commonplace
objects, so often overlooked in day
to-day life.
The Thiebaud exhibition, a col
lection of 84 works on paper, will
be at Stanford until August 14.
Thiebaud has used a wide va
riety of media, many of which are
seen in this exhibit. Works in ink,
charcoal, watercoior, acrylic, pen
cil and pastel, as well as litho
graphs and woodcuts, are repre
sented.

Still lifes make up the largest
portion of Thiebaud's work; and
with the artist's emphasis on food,
one could certainly describe this
exhibit as a "mouthwatering dis
play." Included in the current
show are "Four Cupcakes" (1971);
"Study of Desserts, Salads and
Sandwiches" (1964); "Dark Candy
Apples" (1985); "Pudding"
(1986); and "Parfait" (1984).
Not all of Thiebaud's still lifes,
however, glorify the edible. Both
"Cigar on Ashtray" (1073), an oil
painting, and "Yellow Dress"
(1974), using oil and charcoal, are
brilliantly colorful with sharp
clear lines, readily satisfying more
aesthetic appetities. The dress
depicted is of a by-gone era.
In the mid 1960s Thiebaud
began concentrating on painting
figures, a trend evident in the ex
hibit with such pieces as "Mallary
Ann" (1964) and "D0g"(1967).
His fascination with San Fran
cisco prompted several of the
works in this exhibit. "Diagonal
Ridge" (1987), "Toward 280"
(1978) and "San Francisco Hill"
(1958) explore the angles, hills
and curves of a picturesque city.
Whether it be "City Street"
(1952) or "Pie Cut" (1964),
Thiebaud has a style all his own.
His wide range of media, texture
and color reflect a variety of in
terests and a depth of talent.
The gallery is open Tuesday to
Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to
5 p.m. Docent tours are Sundays
at 2 p.m.
