"Die Hard"

When Bruce Willis ("Moonlight
ing") single-handedly takes on a
gang of German terrorists, you
wind up with "Die Hard," the
newest action-thriller — i.e.
macho movie — directed by
Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver
("Predator").
Willis plays New York cop John

McClane, who flies to Los Angeles
for a Christmas reunion with his
estranged wife Holly, played by
Bonnie Bedelia, and their two
children. John meets up with his
wife at the Nakatomi Corporation
building where Holly is an exec
utive. The annual office Christ
mas party — and the McClanes'
reconciliation — is disrupted by
a terrorist takeover of the high
rise.
Hans Gruber, portrayed by
Alan Rickman, leads the German

terrorists who look more like
wanna-be Calvin Klein models
than scheming villains. In fact,
former Russian ballet sensation
Alexander Gudunov plays Karl,
Gruber's right-hand man.
With a multitude of daring es
capes down elevator shafts and
enough shooting to keep the
blood-hungry sated, "Die Hard"
is big on violence. Although not
subscribing to the theory that
"less is more" when it comes to
action, a sparing use of dialogue
works to the film's advantage.
Although Willis does justice to
his part, the rather unbelievable
stamina of McCiane and the non
existent pain of his many wounds
is hard to swallow. As the film
moves towards its frenzied finale,
McClane's feats grow increasingly
phenomenal, proving that any
thing is possible in the movies.
While "Die Hard" fits the bill
for a typical macho movie, it
deserves some attention. Willis is
engaging as a reluctant — but
forceful — hero, and Reginald Vel
johnson as Sgt. A 1 Powell,
McClane's one ally on the outside,
turns in a fine performance, as
well. "Die Hard" is definitely high
on energy, if lacking in the
creativity department.

"Da-
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson St.

As the camera glosses over the
bedside props, the warm offwhite
curtains, the lace table coverlets,

the foggy spectacles and the can
of Irish tobacco, you get the
feeling that this might be just
another quaint English screenplay
with cold, low-key characters,
overcast skies and period cos
tumes.
Instead, "Da" — a musing, sen
timental story of a father/son rec
onciliation facilitated by an un
fading ghost and a grieved im
agination — well conveys the Irish
honesty, humor and punishing
love that mark the stubborn re
lationship between modern son
and simple father.
The sparkling performance of
Barnard Hughes as Da carries the
film. An undeniable master of
twinkling glances, brewing tan
trums, and simple charm, Hughes
adds hearty life to the film both
as the misunderstood, aging Da
and as the stubborn Irish ghost.
He provides both tears and
laughter, like when he predicts a
German victory to his son's future
employer, to the horrified embar
rassment of his proper wife, Mag
(Doreen Hepburn) who is fever
ishly trying to impress Mr.
Drumm with their upstanding,
conservative household.
Also worthy of acclaim is the
small-role performance of William
Hickey as Mr. Drumm. Despite
his modern, villainous hatred for
the ignorant class of laborers like
Charlie's father, Hickey's per
formance begs pity from us. The
lonely, cold life which causes
Drumm to take Charlie into his
confidence, shows us a dark con
trast to Charlie's caring home.
The one less-than sterling per

formance was given by Martin
Sheen as the grown-up Charlie.
While Sheen conveys the conflict
ing sentiments of grief and dis
respect and finally, forgiveness
with both appropriate Irish pride
and "American" impatience, his
delivery is sometimes stilted.

Sheen often sounds like he's
speaking the verses aloud to
remind himself of their meaning.
Perhaps Sheen was miscast as
the grown-up Charlie, for the ma
terial does not showcase Holly
wood glitz well.
Despite this minor flaw, "Da"
is a patient, involving movie that
excels with its characters and will
definitely please those who aren't
satisfied with the standard sum
mer sequel.
