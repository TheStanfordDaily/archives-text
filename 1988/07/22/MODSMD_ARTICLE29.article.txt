### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Brad Muster, a first-round pick
in the National Football League
draft, agreed to terms with the
Chicago Bears Wednesday. He
was on hand yesterday when
training camp officially opened.
Muster signed a series of one
year contracts. No specifics about
the deal were made available.
Muster, a 6-foot-4, 232-pound
fullback, skipped the Bears min
icamp in May because he feared
an injury would damage his
negotiating position. He did
report to the team's rookie
orientation camp on July 6.
Muster graduated in June with
a bachelor's in economics after
completing a spectacular career
at Stanford. His ability to excel
at all facets of his game — run
ning, catching and blocking — at
tracted a lot of attention among
NFL scouts and evenutally led to
his becoming a first-round selec
tion.
In other news, wide receiver
Jeff James, a classmate of
Muster's, received some kind
words in Inside Sports magazine.
In their NFL preview issue, In
side Sports did a sidebar on
players selected in the seventh
through 12th rounds of the draft

and do well. One of the players
highlighted was none other than
