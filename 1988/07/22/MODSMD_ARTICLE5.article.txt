### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
A popular Stanford student and
teacher, who many will remember
as "always flying," died Tuesday
in a tragic plane crash, leaving
family and friends in the Stanford
community traumatized.
Known as Buster to his frater
nity brothers at Stanford's Sigma
Chi house and others close to him,
Edward Paul Nicholson was a
June graduate who taught in the
Computer Science Department
and had been an active member
of his fraternity. He died at age
24.
Funeral services for Nicholson
will be held Saturday from 5 to
6 p.m. in Stanford's Memorial
Church. Nicholson's parents have
come to the Bay Area for this
weekend's services from their
home in Portland, OR.
Entering Stanford in 1981, Nic
holson earned his bachelor's
degree in political science in 1985

and completed his master's in in
ternational policy studies this
spring.
After finishing his bachelor's
degree, Nicholson remained in
volved in academics as both a stu
dent and teacher. A native of
Portland, OR, he has worked as
a teaching assistant and as a
teaching fellow for the Computer
Science Department since 1982.
This spring, he was a TAin Com
puter Science 105.
Friends said Nicholson's passion
for flying began three years ago,
inspired partly by the popular ad
venture movie, "Top Gun." Nic
holson watched it at least "30
times," according to fraternity
brother and senior John Sojka.
Recently accepted into a U.S.
Navy flight training school, Nic
holson wanted to make a career
of flying. He was scheduled to
begin naval training next month.
Members of his fraternity said
Nicholson shared his love of flying
with his friends. In order to ac

cumulate flight-hours toward his
pilot's license, Nicholson often
took fraternity brothers and their
dates on flights to Half Moon Bay
or San Francisco for a small fee
or in exchange for dinner.
