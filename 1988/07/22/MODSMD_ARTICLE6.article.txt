### Laura Jacobson Kathy Lachenauer Staff writers 
At a picnic/protest held Tuesday, more than 100
supporters for the United Stanford Workers gath
ered on the grass outside the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center to show their support for five union
workers recently laid off.
During the lunch-time gathering, a mixed crowd
of Bay Area union leaders, University employees,
concerned family members and Stanford students
came to protest what they claim to be mismanage
ment and unfair layoffs at Negotiations for
a new contract between the USW and Stanford open
on Tuesday.
Charging Stanford with financial irresponsibility,
San Mateo Labor Council Secretary Art Pulaski
said SLAC is firing union employees and replacing
them with cheap outside contractors who are not
as qualified.
"If Stanford wants to maintain a standard of high
quality, then we believe that they ought to pay
decently," Pulaski told the ralliers. "We don't want
a middleman. We want them to pay full-time
people."
Jeff Kot, one of the five workers SLAC recently
laid off, said he was once a full
time employee who "could not
compete with outside contrac
tors."
Blaming mismanagement for
his layoff, Kot said he had "a good
work record and a good attend
ance record" but lost his job be
cause of SLAC executives' "incom
petence."
But according to University
Lawyer Michael Vartain, it is
Stanford's policy to layoff tempo
rary help before permanent em
ployees. Vartain called the con
tract employees "an important as
set" that Stanford has the right
to take advantage of when work
levels increase. But according to
Vartain, the use of contracted em
ployees "has not caused any of
these layoffs."

He noted that large projects in
cluding the Stanford Linear Col
lider project cause "work loads to
rise and fall" and require addi
tional labor. Recent layoffs oc
cured once the project was com
pleted, he explained.
Laid off workers could have ap
plied for other technical jobs at
SLAC, Vartain added, saying that
one employee refused to take on
a position in a new department.
Several onlookers at the rally
were not aware of the recent
layoffs nor of the union's griev
ances. Kim Dillon, a secretary at
SLAC, was surprised to see a
protest occur during her outdoor
lunch break.
"I don't really know what's
going on here," Dillion said. She
questioned why the USW did not
try to inform non-union SLAC
employees of the protest. "I was
surprised that they didn't try for
more support. They could have
gotten it," she said.
