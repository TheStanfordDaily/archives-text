At a picnic/protest held Tuesday, more than 100
supporters for the United Stanford Workers gath
ered on the grass outside the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center to show their support for five union
workers recently laid off.
During the lunch-time gathering, a mixed crowd
of Bay Area union leaders, University employees,
concerned family members and Stanford students
came to protest what they claim to be mismanage
ment and unfair layoffs at Negotiations for
a new contract between the USW and Stanford open
on Tuesday.
Charging Stanford with financial irresponsibility,
San Mateo Labor Council Secretary Art Pulaski
said SLAC is firing union employees and replacing
them with cheap outside contractors who are not
as qualified.
"If Stanford wants to maintain a standard of high
quality, then we believe that they ought to pay
decently," Pulaski told the ralliers. "We don't want
a middleman. We want them to pay full-time
people."
