Although Stanford's animal
research facilities recently
passed an important inspection
by an animal care association,
plans for a new and better fa
cility are still moving forward.
The approval by the Ameri
can Association for the Ac
creditation of Laboratory Ani
mal Medicine is expected to
bolster Stanford's research pro
gram.
But because Stanford's aging
facilities "barely passed" the
association's inspection, the
University will concentrate its

efforts and money on building
a new research facility, rather
than renovating the old one,
according to Thomas Hamm,
director of the research facili
ties. The new $18 million an
imal facility will be built on
the West Campus.
"We need to have this build
ing remain accreditated. The
accreditation is a gold star on
live animal medicine," Hamm
said, noting that most research
facilities in the country do not
have a similar seal of approval.
Stanford now has the ap
proval of both the Department
of Agriculture and AAALAC.
