# Preserving Native American history
## Stanford policy aims to protect on-campus archaeological sites 
### Bill Shen 
In a landmark move emphasiz
ing University commitment to the
study of Native American history,
Stanford recently adopted a
pioneering policy to identify and
preserve more than 50 prehistoric
Native American sites on campus.
The new policy, approved by the
University's Administrative
Council in May, restricts the Uni
versity from building on any lands
of archaeological significance. It
covers all University lands con
tiguous to the central campus,
plus the Hopkins Marine Station
near Monterey.
"I don't think there is another
University in the country that is
devoting similar institutional re
sources to the identification and
preservation of such sites," said
Barbara Bocek, the University ar
chaeologist.
The University's decision not
to build on the sites represents a
loss of $9 to $12 million in land
value, according to acting campus
archaeologist Laura Leach-Palm.
The policy may also push Stan
ford to develop a museum of Na
tive American artifacts, according
to Anthropology Prof. John Rick.
During the past two years, most

Native American sites on
campus have already been found,
Rick said. But archaeologists and
University officials said they still
expect to find a few minor sites
in the future.

The campus sites con
tain primarily chips of
stone tools and shells,
. . . including some
items which are
'around 5,000 years
old.'

"What you have here is an ex
ceptional group of sites on a really
well-preserved piece of land in
comparison to other parts of Cal
ifornia," Rick said. "They repre
sent the only record we have on
human occupation on this land
during the prehistorical period."

marily chips of stone tools and
shells, Leach-Palm said, including

James Larimore, assistant dean
of student affairs for American
Indian affairs and a member of
the task force committee which
helped develop the policy, said he
was encouraged that the policy
represents University commit
ment and concern about Native
American history.
"Since I arrived here in 1985,
the University has devoted much
effort in protecting these sites.
With the passage of this enact
ment, the University furthered its
support of the preservation of
these landmarks," he said.
"Although some Indian descen
dants are somewhat skeptical
about it, most of us are very en
couraged about the policy," he
added.
"The measure is very humane,"
Rick agreed. "For instance, if it
is determined that human re
mains or artifacts are present, the
monitor can stop the excavation."
Although the sites are generally
well maintained, Rick said some
findings have suffered significant
destruction. "There is erosion
going on at some sites which is
difficult to control. Misuse of the
land is another attribute (of the
destruction)."
