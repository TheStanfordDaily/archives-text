# Cambodian factions meet but do not agree on much
## 
### 
BOGOR, Indonesia — Cam
bodia's warring factions began
unprecedented talks yesterday in
a search for peace but remained
locked in disagreement on how to
achieve it.
With all holding unbending po
sitions, their main accomplish
ment was to get through the day
without a walkout. Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who
organized the talks at this hilltop
resort outside Jakarta, said that
the proceedings were "on the
whole ... productive."
"What is important to note,"
he told reporters at the conclusion
of nine hours of discussions, "is
that for the first time the parties
directly involved, as well as others
concerned ... have been sitting
down and talking to one another,
rather than past one another."
Throughout nearly 10 years of
conflict, while Vietnamese troops
invaded Cambodia, ousted the
brutal Khmer Rouge regime and
installed a government allied with
Hanoi, the antagonists have never
before sat down together.
Alatas described as "quite good"
the atmosphere of the closed-door
talks, held in a former presidential
palace here. He said that they
would resume Tuesday morning.
The participants, he said, out
lined their positions Monday and
agreed on some general goals,
such as withdrawal of the remain
ing Vietnamese troops from Cam
bodia and establishment of a
neutral, non-aligned government.
According to the Indonesian min
ister, the participants will now try

to "narrow divergences" of how
to achieve those goals.
Politically, the initiative was
seized by Hun Sen, premier of the
Vietnamese-installed government
in Phnom Penh, who, alone
among the contending Cambodian
leaders here, held a press confer
ence at the end of the day. He
disclosed a seven-point peace plan
that contains little new except for
one wrinkle clearly designed to
appeal to former Cambodian
leader Norodom Sihanouk, who
was in Jakarta but not taking part
in the talks.
As part of his plan, which he
said he had presented in the talks
Monday morning, Hun Sen called
for the establishment of a Na
tional Reconciliation Council un
der Sihanouk which, after a cease
fire, would organize national elec
tions in Cambodia.
However, Hun Sen rejected a
demand by Sihanouk and the
leaders of two other resistance
groups, including the Khmer
Rouge, that the Phnom Penh gov
ernment be dissolved and replaced
by a four-faction provisional gov
ernment under Sihanouk.
"That is not acceptable," Hun
Sen told reporters.
His plan also accelerates the
target date for the withdrawal of
the estimated 100,000 remaining
Vietnamese troops. He said that
they would be pulled back across
the frontier by December 1989,
or at the latest by the end of
March 1990.
