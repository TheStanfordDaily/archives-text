# Marcos sets up bargain to return to Philippines

WASHINGTON - Former
Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos has offered to give back
$5 billion to the Philippines and
to support the government of
President Corazon Aquino if he
is permitted to return there and
be exempted from criminal pros
ecution, according to participants
in the negotiations.
Marcos' representatives are now
making a last-ditch effort to avert
his indictment in the United
States by promising American of
ficials that he will, for the first
time, promote "national reconcil
iation" in the Philippines if he is
not charged.
"If there is no indictment, he
will support the government of
the Philippines. There will be na
tional reconciliation," Col. Arturo
Aruiza, an aide to Marcos at his
current home in Honolulu, told
the Los Angeles Times.
Meanwhile, Acting Associate
Attorney General Francis Keating

disclosed Monday that the Depart
ment of Justice recently set up a
new policy to give special scrutiny
to federal criminal investigations
involving former chiefs of state,
such as Marcos, or current chiefs
of state such as Panamanian
strongman Manuel Noriega.
Keating said that whenever a
U.S. attorney recommends an in
dictment against such a foreign
leader, there will be first a special
review within the Department of
Justice and then a separate review
involving other U.S. agencies.
"This would include getting ad
vice from the intelligence commu
nity or the State Department on
what impact this (proposed indict
ment) would have on national se
curity," Keating said.
Representatives for Marcos
have entered into talks with
Philippine officials.
