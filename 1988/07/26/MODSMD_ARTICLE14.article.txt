Defense Dept. pulls clearances
WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense
has revoked the security clearances of six Pen
tagon employees implicated in the procurement
fraud scandal, Secretary of Defense Frank Car
lucci announced yesterday.
The officials whose clearances were lifted in
clude high-ranking Navy purchasing officer
James Gaines and Air Force procurement official
Victor Cohen, whose Pentagon offices were
searched by FBI agents in June.
After the Department of Justice defense fraud
investigation was disclosed last month, Carlucci
immediately lifted the six officials' contracting
duties and said their access to classified materials
was under review.
Federal investigators have said that the mas
sive inquiry involved the payments of "bribes and
gratuities" to Pentagon officials by defense con
sultants in exchange for confidential data on
lucrative military contracts. Documents in the
case have suggested that Gaines, Cohen and at
least four other Pentagon officials may have been
sources of such information.
One of the six, Navy civilian employee George
G. Stone, has been suspended without pay on
the basis of allegations, listed in a federal search
warrant, that he provided privileged data to a
defense consultant and to a Texas company bid
ding on a Navy electronics project.
In a press conference yesterday, Carlucci also
outlined a number of other steps the department
has taken in response to the ongoing investiga
tion.
Moving to curb the use of consultants by sup
pliers, the Pentagon now requires that a number
of rragor defense contractors certify that they did
not use consultants to illegally acquire inside
information about Pentagon contracts, Carlucci
said.
The Department of Defense edict, which affects
contracts worth $100,000 or more, applies to
most of the companies named so far in connection

with the investigation. The order affects 15 com
panies, including such msyor defense suppliers
as Litton Data Systems, McDonnell Douglas,
Teledyne Electronics, Unisys and United Tech
nologies.
Counsel clears Reagan, Bush
WASHINGTON — The independent counsel in
the Iran-Contra case asserted for the first time
yesterday that his investigation had produced no
evidence that President Reagan or Vice President
George Bush knew of the diversion of Iran arms
sales profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh, in briefs
filed in federal court, indicated that there will
be no action against the top two executive branch
officials, even though prosecution of more figures
in the arms sale affair is considered likely.
After 18 months of grand jury deliberations
on the scandal, Walsh said, his staff is "not aware
of any superior" of Lt. Col. Oliver North, aside
from former national security advisers Robert
McFarlane or John Poindexter, "who knew
enough about North's activities to have conveyed
even informal or implicit approval."
Walsh's assertion echoes the conclusions of the
two previous extensive investigations of the affair,
conducted by the presidentially appointed Tower
commission and by a joint congressional commit
tee, that there was no evidence of illegal conduct
by Reagan or Bush.
Walsh addressed the issue of knowledge by the
the president and vice president of the funds
diversion in a briaf that called on the court to
postpone a deadline for furnishing North with
more classified documents for use in preparing
his defense.
Walsh said that culling out the documents was
a time-consuming process, and that the material
was irrelevant anyway.
