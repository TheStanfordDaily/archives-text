Stanford and USW
must try harder

Negotiations be
tween Stanford and
the United Stanford
Workers are set to begin
today, and it is time the two
parties break the vicious cy
cle of bad faith bargaining
and acrimonious mudsling
ing.
Instead of focusing the ar
gument on who is to blame
for the current poor state of
relations, the two groups
should get together,
negotiate directly and
honestly and sign an agree
ment in the spirit of com
promise.
After all, Stanford Uni
versity — as one of the most
widely respected univer
sities in the country —
should hold itself to an ex
ceptionally high standard in
maintaining good labor/
management relations.
Sadly, rather than prepar
ing for the upcoming nego
tiations in an honest and
direct manner, both sides
appear to be posturing for
another hardline round of
talks. The state of affairs
can be witnessed by the wide
discrepancies that exist in
answers given by the two
sides to even the simplest
questions.
For example, the Univer
sity claims there have been

approximately 15 workers
laid off at SLAC over the
past three years. But, the
USW counters that that
number is greater than 100.
Clearly, the two sides are
counting different groups of
people.
To ensure that neither
side in the negotiating proc
ess attempts to take advan
tage of a pleasant, insulated
negotiating environment,
the ASSU's call for the in
troduction of some form of
external monitoring should
be implemented.
Allowing a third party to
sit in on the negotiations is
only one way to achieve this.
But, making a written
transcript of the negotia
tions available afterwards
might even better serve to
remove the bitterness from
the back and forth of bar
gaining. Such a system
would even allow either
party to have particularly
sensitive areas of negotia
tion stricken from the
record.
The goal of both sides in
the negotiations should be
to provide just and humane
salaries for University em
ployees within the con
straints of budgetary consid
erations.
Above all, it is the respon
sibility of both sides to see
that the acrimony of past
negotiations — which have
been marred by debilitating
union strikes — do not
recur.
