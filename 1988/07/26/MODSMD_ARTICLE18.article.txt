POLITICIANS ARE a lot
like famous actors.
They have press agents.
They do interviews. They try to
outdo one another by stealing the
show.
They must look good in front
of the camera. They smile when
they have to smile. The whole
world is their stage.
They have reputations to con
sider, images to create, audiences
to win over. They are masters of
negotiation.
They have to develop a distinc
tive personal style or remain
anonymous.
They have their share of entou
rages: the wardrobe, make-up and
publicity people as well as as
sorted sycophants.
And, like famous actors, politi
cians are ouen required to be
someone else, especially during
election time. The more convinc
ing the better. . . .
Step right up, ladies and
gentlemen, to the 1988 production
of "A Midsummer Night's Cam
paign," starring the four main
players:
Jesse Jackson as Robin Hood.
He allegedly steals from the rich
and gives to the poor. Or does he
really stand for economic
equality?

To some people, he is a hero.
To others, he is a villain.
Should he be the leader of our
land? What he lacks in govern
ment experience he more than
compensates for in charisma.
Michael Dukakis as Charlie
Brown. The kind of guy whose
face might get lost in the crowd
but in the long run did not get
trampled because of his staying
power. Boring but dependable, he
is seemingly free of major vices
and scandal.
Lloyd Bentsen as Linus, Charlie
Brown's best friend. These days
he is seldom seen without his se
curity blanket named Texas.
George Bush as The Shadow.
No one really knows what he is
like.
For now, he keeps a low profile,
choosing only to come out when
the conditions are right. There is
evidence of a shady past. It is
rumored that he is really the
shadow of someone named Ronald
Reagan.
Alas, these other players no
longer can participate due to un
fortunate circumstances:
Gary Hart as Romeo. His love
for the opposite sex caused him
to commit political suicide.
Robert Dole as Captain Ahab.
His attempts to harpoon Moby

Bush eventually turned against
him.
Paul Simon as Granny Goose.
An oddity among the young and
slick. Criticized for his fixation
with day care and its costs.
Pat Robertson as Dr. Franken
stein. A misguided soul with good
intentions and bad ideas that
would surely lead to the creation
of a monster.
Richard Gephardt as Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde. One personality
voted for one side of an issue in
Congress. The other personality
changed its mind during the cam
paign.
How will this production turn
out? It depends on how many in
terested citizens show up. We will
find out for certain on November
4.
