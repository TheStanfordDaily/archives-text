## In long run Sandinista regime threatens United States 
### 
THAVE been attacked, in
The Daily, for not Mentify-
JLing the sources of informa
tion about Sandinista atrocities.
The leading official of Am
nesty International whom I
quoted asked not to be identi
fied for obvious reasons; their
work depends on not being in
volved in politics.
Further conversation with
that person and a prominent
local authority on Central
America have revealed to me
their conviction that the lack of
a free press in Nicaragua has
loaded the dice of this kind of
information heavily in favor of
the dictatorial regime. Both
parties claim there is no issue
to be made in favor of one side
or the other, on these grounds.
The other source was Jack
Anderson in his column (San
Francisco Chronicle, July 1)
who interviewed a freelance
reporter named Gary Moore,
who used to be an admirer of
the Sandinista regime but
changed his views.
He recently spent three
months "combing the
Nicaraguan jungle documenting
human rights abuses on both
sides of the civil war." Ander
son obviously thought he was
"reliable," as I claimed, and it

sure sounds as if he were
pretty fair-minded.
Rachelle Marshall doubts it
on the basis of his working for
the conservative National
Forum Foundation (as Anderson
knew and informed us), as if
that automatically made him a
liar. That kind of blind par
tisanship smacks of theology
rather than open-minded
reasoning.
Moore documented his
charges, e.g. "that the Sandi
nista officers presided over the
torture of Nicaraguans, that
soldiers sometimes cut off
people's ears and smashed in
their faces." He interviewed a
grieving mother on camera. But
the government confiscated all
his materials and threw him in
jail.

claim they are more ruthless
than the Contras. But in my
letter I gave my opinion that,
given the unfathomable welter

of charges and counter-charges
in such cases of civil conflict,
the true issues lie elsewhere.
Allan King, in his response,
seems to agree when he claims
that it is not a question of
"who is worse" but one of
sovereignty.
Well, one does not deal lightly
with it, to be sure, among
civilized people, but unfortun
ately you cannot always depend
on nations playing fair. Spinoza,
in his Fractatus theologico
politicus, declared that interna
tional relations were generally
in a state of nature. He was an
Enlightenment optimist: he
hadn't seen the twentieth
century man!
In our "age of enormity," you
have to deal with maniacs like
Hitler, who happened to have
been elected democratically.
Surely, even my adversaries
would have to agree that some
judicious sovereignty-violation
was called for, say by the
Trench after the occupation of
the Rhineland. Surely the mil
lions who died in the camps or
fighting would have seen it that
way and would have welcomed
early intervention even by the
monster Stalin....
Accordingly, a near-unanimity
of our representatives would

approve our going in and
"taking out" any late model
Migs which show up in
Nicaraguan airspace. Of course,
ideologues on our lovely cam
puses will yell foul. . . .
The reason we will and
should intervene has almost
nothing to do with Ortega's
style of governing, deplorable as
it may be. Rather, it has to do
with the judgement that in the
long run his movement threat
ens our civilization.
Just before he died, the
greatest modern political
thinker, Raymond Aron, wrote
that if Central America goes
communist, it will have a dra
matic influence on Mexico and
change the whole geopolitical
picture for the United States.
Campus radicals would welcome
this, but some others may still
wonder what is in it for them.
The American people and
their representatives are slow to
react to this unpleasant news,
just as they were to enter the
European wars. Churchill was
pooh-poohed, we recall, but he
was one of the few who
emerged with his reputation as
a visionary and his honor intact.
