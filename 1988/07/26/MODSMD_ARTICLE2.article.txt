# Campbell retirement draws response
## 
### Mike Horelick 
W. Glenn Campbell's announce
ment last week that he will step
down as director of the Hoover
Institution met with a heated re
sponse â€” from friends and foes
alike.
And although reaction to Camp
bell's retirement was mixed, senti
ment seemed to divide along in
stitutional lines. Fellows at
Hoover expressed regret that
Campbell will retire, while profes
sors in the University hailed the
retirement as a productive move
for future Stanford-Hoover rela
tions.
Many Hoover fellows backed
Campbell across the board, saying
they will miss his helmsmanship
and that they found his forced
retirement "unfair."
Campbell will step down in
April, when he turns 65, as a

result of a decision by the Uni
versity Board of Trustees to en
force the established retirement
age for Hoover Institution direc
tors.
Hoover Senior Fellow Peter
Duignan said Campbell's decision
to step down was "best for him,
worst for us."
"He let us do what we wanted
to and raised the money to see
that we could do it," Duignan said
of Campbell's support for research
by Hoover fellows. "The next di
rector is not likely to be so open
and tolerant of scholarly work."
"For himself, it was a good
move," he added. "To be con
stantly attacked by liberal left
wing faculty for no reason other
than ideology is a very stressful
situation."
"He'll live a lot longer this
way."
On the other hand, some Uni

versity professors said they were
pleased that Campbell will be
relinquishing his post. They
viewed his resignation as a "turn
ing point" in relations between
Hoover and the University.
Martin Carnoy, professor at the
School of Education, said Camp
bell's forced retirement will be a
pivotal point in "Hoover's identi
fication with Stanford." He noted
that Campbell "saw himself more
as a representative of the Reagan
administration than Stanford."
Political Science Prof. John
Manley, long a critic of Campbell
and Hoover, also said he was
pleased about Campbell's decision
to retire.
However, he added that Camp
bell's decision to move into a re
tirement position as a Hoover
fund-raiser will continue to cause
problems between the institution
and the University.
"Whether Campbell stays or
goes, the problem of Hoover re
mains," Manley said, adding that
he believes the Hoover Institution
is "a politically active think tank
married to a non-partisan univer
sity."
On June 8, 64 Hoover scholars
sent a letter to the Stanford Board
of Trustees supporting Campbell
and urging the trustees to allow
Campbell to remain as director.
Manley said the letter was inef
fectual and was a move "not of
power but of desperation."
One of the signators of that
letter, Hoover Senior Fellow Mel
vyn Krauss, said Campbell's
forced retirement by the Univer
sity was "unfair" and "unwar
ranted."
"He's only 65 years old," Krauss
said. "I think it's a shame that a
productive man is leaving."
Senior Research Fellow
Kingsley Davis agreed. "I will be
sad to see (Campbell) go," Davis
said. "I've enjoyed his humor, his
interest and his support."
Some Hoover staff members
also said Campbell will be missed.
