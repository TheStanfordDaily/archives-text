## Suicide: a rare but persistent threat to Stanford students 
### Vivian Fu 
Despite the sunny skies on the
Farm and the apparently sunny
dispositions of many of the people
here, suicide is not unknown to
this community.
Although the suicide rate at
Stanford is slightly below the na
tional average for college students,
27 members of the Stanford com
munity have killed themselves in
the past 22 years, according to
Vincent D'Andrea, senior staff

psychologist at Counseling and
Psychological Services.
In fact, the number of suicide
attempts here is higher than
people tend to believe because
some cases occur quietly and are
not widely known outside of the
dormitory or house.
In real numbers, between 15
and 20 Stanford students are
hospitalized every year for psycho
logical reasons — mostly for de
pression, D'Andrea said. Of those
hospitalized, about half have prob
lems associated with paranoia and
psychotic behavior.
The other half of the
hospitalizations deal with suicidal

thinking, and about five of those
students have actually attempted
suicide.
D'Andrea said he does not be
lieve the atmosphere at Stanford
is responsible for an individual's
breakdown. "Stanford doesn't
drive people crazy — people bring
their own vulnerabilities to Stan
ford. Students bring with them
unresolved conflicts from home."
"Every school has its own style,
its own culture, its own ways of
behaving. People just learn to go
along with the norm. At Berkeley
it's being bizarre — at Stanford
it's being laid back and cool. But
underneath the coolness, every
one is a coiled spring here. It's
when people can't cope — that's
the trouble."
When the coil has wound too
tightly and may be in danger of
snapping, students often look to
the Bridge, the student-run peer
counseling network here. Jim
Fuendeling, a counselor at the
Bridge, said that "people have
their time so full here — it's hard
for them to establish support sys
tems like the ones they had in
high school." A common complaint
of students who call the Bridge is
unsatisfactory friendships, ac
cording to Fuendeling.
"A lot of people just don't feel
as close to their friends at Stan
ford as they did to their friends
in high school." Fuendeling added
that a lack of support could con
tribute to the desperation leading
to suicide attempts.
According to Aija Krusha, crisis
service manager of the Suicide
and Crisis Service of San Mateo
County, there is usually a

precipitating factor that brings on
the depression that often triggers
suicide attempts. "Many things
can cause a depression — conflicts
from childhood, a loss of some
kind, or lack of confidence due to
cumulative setbacks."
In order to counteract this de
pression, Stanford administrators
said they seek to provide both
academic and emotional support
for its students. In the dorms,
there is a residential hierarchy of
academic advisors, resident assis
tants and resident fellows who are
there to help students in need.
The Bridge also has a 24-hour
telephone service operated by
trained counselors, as well as a
drop-in consulting service.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson,
the "response (of Residential Ed
ucation) depends upon the nature
of the behavior. The more private
the act was, the more private the
reaction. But if it's a public act
it affects other people."
Alice Supton, associate dean of
student affairs for Residential Ed
ucation, added that the adminis
tration is especially concerned
with friends and neighbors of
someone who has committed or
attempted suicide. "We want to
protect people. People need to find
out what was going on and what
happened first. We want to make
sense of a senseless event."
According to Supton, all staff
members of Residential Education
are trained to take suicide threats
"extremely seriously."
For all suicide cases, the Uni
versity will only become involved
if the attempt is public. "The ad

ministration only steps in if the
suicide attempt has an effect on
the residence community of the
student — if other people know
about it," said Residential Dean
of the Row Diana Conklin.
"Otherwise, we would not even
know about it. Only CAPS would
know."

When attempts are public, then
the residential dean meets with
the resident assistants or the res
ident fellows involved, consults
with CAPS and talks to the stu
dent who made the attempt.
But across the board, Stanford
does not have a set policy con
cerning suicide attempts. "It's
really a case-by-case decision,"
Conldin said. "Sometimes it's a
real judgement call. We want to

know how the well-being of the
other people in the house has been
affected, and if the suicide at
tempt had a detrimental enough
effect for the person to be
removed from the house."
The residential dean plays a key
role in deciding if the student is
well enough to remain in school
and continue living at the same
residence, or if the student should
move off campus, or if the student
should withdraw from school al
together for a period of time.
However, a lot of consulting
goes on in the decision making
process, according to Conklin.
"Whoever is involved is consulted.
The medical decision is made by
CAPS. We focus only on the ad
ministrative one — the effect
upon the community. It's not a
decision that one person can
make."
On the national scale, Stanford
does pretty well at a time when
suicide among the nation's young
people has become a serious prob
lem.
During the past 30 years, the
rate of suicide among 15 to 24
year olds has more than tripled.
According to the Center for Dis
ease Control in Atlanta, suicide is
now the second leading cause of
death in this age group. Accidents
remain the primary cause of
death.
Sociologists theorize that an in
crease in the number of people
competing for the same amount
of opportunities is leading to a
greater proportion of dissatisfied
and unhappy people.

underneath the coolness, every
one is a coiled spring here. It's
when people can't cope — that's
the trouble."
When the coil has wound too
tightly and may be in danger of
snapping, students often look to
the Bridge, the student-run peer
counseling network here. Jim
Fuendeling, a counselor at the
Bridge, said that "people have
their time so full here — it's hard
for them to establish support sys
tems like the ones they had in
high school." A common complaint
of students who call the Bridge is
unsatisfactory friendships, ac
cording to Fuendeling.
"A lot of people just don't feel
as close to their friends at Stan
ford as they did to their friends
in high school." Fuendeling added
that a lack of support could con
tribute to the desperation leading
to suicide attempts.
According to Aija Krusha, crisis
service manager of the Suicide
and Crisis Service of San Mateo
County, there is usually a

precipitating factor that brings on
the depression that often triggers
suicide attempts. "Many things
can cause a depression — conflicts
from childhood, a loss of some
kind, or lack of confidence due to
cumulative setbacks."
In order to counteract this de
pression, Stanford administrators
said they seek to provide both
academic and emotional support
for its students. In the dorms,
there is a residential hierarchy of
academic advisors, resident assis
tants and resident fellows who are
there to help students in need.
The Bridge also has a 24-hour
telephone service operated by
trained counselors, as well as a
drop-in consulting service.
According to Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson,
the "response (of Residential Ed
ucation) depends upon the nature
of the behavior. The more private
the act was, the more private the
reaction. But if it's a public act
it affects other people."
Alice Supton, associate dean of
student affairs for Residential Ed
ucation, added that the adminis
tration is especially concerned
with friends and neighbors of
someone who has committed or
attempted suicide. "We want to
protect people. People need to find
out what was going on and what
happened first. We want to make
sense of a senseless event."
According to Supton, all staff
members of Residential Education
are trained to take suicide threats
"extremely seriously."
For all suicide cases, the Uni
versity will only become involved
if the attempt is public. "The ad

ministration only steps in if the
suicide attempt has an effect on
the residence community of the
student — if other people know
about it," said Residential Dean
of the Row Diana Conklin.
"Otherwise, we would not even
know about it. Only CAPS would
know."

When attempts are public, then
the residential dean meets with
the resident assistants or the res
ident fellows involved, consults
with CAPS and talks to the stu
dent who made the attempt.
But across the board, Stanford
does not have a set policy con
cerning suicide attempts. "It's
really a case-by-case decision,"
Conldin said. "Sometimes it's a
real judgement call. We want to

know how the well-being of the
other people in the house has been
affected, and if the suicide at
tempt had a detrimental enough
effect for the person to be
removed from the house."
The residential dean plays a key
role in deciding if the student is
well enough to remain in school
and continue living at the same
residence, or if the student should
move off campus, or if the student
should withdraw from school al
together for a period of time.
However, a lot of consulting
goes on in the decision making
process, according to Conklin.
"Whoever is involved is consulted.
The medical decision is made by
CAPS. We focus only on the ad
ministrative one — the effect
upon the community. It's not a
decision that one person can
make."
On the national scale, Stanford
does pretty well at a time when
suicide among the nation's young
people has become a serious prob
lem.
During the past 30 years, the
rate of suicide among 15 to 24
year olds has more than tripled.
According to the Center for Dis
ease Control in Atlanta, suicide is
now the second leading cause of
death in this age group. Accidents
remain the primary cause of
death.
Sociologists theorize that an in
crease in the number of people
competing for the same amount
of opportunities is leading to a
greater proportion of dissatisfied
and unhappy people.

Despite the sunny skies on the
Farm and the apparently sunny
dispositions of many of the people
here, suicide is not unknown to
this community.
Although the suicide rate at
Stanford is slightly below the na
tional average for college students,
27 members of the Stanford com
munity have killed themselves in
the past 22 years, according to
Vincent D'Andrea, senior staff

psychologist at Counseling and
Psychological Services.
In fact, the number of suicide
attempts here is higher than
people tend to believe because
some cases occur quietly and are
not widely known outside of the
dormitory or house.
In real numbers, between 15
and 20 Stanford students are
hospitalized every year for psycho
logical reasons — mostly for de
pression, D'Andrea said. Of those
hospitalized, about half have prob
lems associated with paranoia and
psychotic behavior.
The other half of the
hospitalizations deal with suicidal

thinking, and about five of those
students have actually attempted
suicide.
D'Andrea said he does not be
lieve the atmosphere at Stanford
is responsible for an individual's
breakdown. "Stanford doesn't
drive people crazy — people bring
their own vulnerabilities to Stan
ford. Students bring with them
unresolved conflicts from home."
"Every school has its own style,
its own culture, its own ways of
behaving. People just learn to go
along with the norm. At Berkeley
it's being bizarre — at Stanford
it's being laid back and cool. But
underneath the coolness, every
one is a coiled spring here. It's
when people can't cope — that's
the trouble."
