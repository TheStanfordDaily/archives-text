# Brides and grooms fill Memorial Church
## Summer weddings blaze with opulence and emotion 
### Lisa Mackey Staff writer 
When Karen Vickers and Cecil Hayle take
their vows in Memorial Church on Sep
tember 10, they will not only be consecrat
ing their union, but taking part in an 85-
year-old Stanford tradition.
The tradition dates back to February 22,
1903 when the newly-built and startlingly
opulent Memorial Church played host to
the first of many luxurious nuptials that
would take place here.
And, like Stanford football, the tradition
continues.
The brides and grooms, who flock to the
Church in heavy numbers during the sum
mer months, say the hushed splendor of
Mem Chu may be one of the most perfect
settings on the West Coast for a wedding
ceremony.
Weddings at Memorial Church symbolize
"elegance and create a formal and stunning
setting," said Betsy Koester, the wedding
coordinator of the church. "The most stun
ning moment of the wedding is seeing the
bride at the two middle doors in silhouette.
The audience is grabbed at that moment,"
she added.
But getting to get married at Mem Chu
is sometimes difficult. Ceremonies are
usually booked one year in advance, and
are limited to Stanford alumni, students
or staff members.
And, like most things at Stanford, it's
not free. Couples must pay $500 to reserve
Mem Chu, $150 for clerp\ $80 for a
vocalist, $30 for amplification and $8 for
recorded music.
Yet, for most, the end result is worth
the trouble. "There was special significance
to me as a student and employee here at
Stanford for eight years. It made my wed
ding more elegant and beautiful — it was
the most romantic setting for a wedding,"
said Raga Elim, a 1983 graduate, who was
married on May 29.
Once couples decide Memorial Church

suits them, Koester said she recommends
the appropriate clergy to conduct the cer
emony. Different clergy are available
through the church to conduct weddings
for people of any religious conviction.
Koester said she usually directs five wed
dings on Saturday and one wedding on
Sunday during the summer months. "It is
usually one of the busiest times of the
year."
According to Koester, in addition to of
fering a luxurious setting, Memorial
Church has a tradition of making sure each
couple knows exactly what marriage

'The most stunning moment
of the wedding is seeing the
bride at the two middle doors
in silhouette.'

means. The Church staff offers three ses
sions of marriage counseling, designed to
teach couples the "nature and responsibil
ities of marriage," she said.
"Couples take marriage so seriously and
are earnest, sincere and committed to
making the marriage work. Marriage is no
longer on the rocks," said Richard Thayer,
a congregational minister.
Some couples said they enjoyed the ses
sions while others said they felt nervous
telling strangers intimate feelings about
their future spouses.
"The counseling session is so fascinating.
Taking the (attitude and personality) tests
has helped immensely," said Hayle, who is
a visiting member of the Stanford faculty.
"I had apprehensions at first (in) telling
a stranger my personal feelings about my
bride, but I realized things were brought
up that needed to be discussed," said Ken
Chan, a 1983 graduate who will be married
this week.

Poised at the threshold of marriage, in the plaza before Memorial Church, a couple
exults after tying the knot. Matrimony — all the rage during summer months — has
