## Record stores blessed with bountiful bargains 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Well, record shoppers, August
is arriving, and with it the music
industry's equivalent of February
sweeps week on network televi
sion. With the biggest sales season
of the year soon to be but a
memory, the major labels have
inundated the market with a wide
variety of products in the hope of
wrestling a few more dollars out
of the hands of customers still
basking in the warmth and en
thusiasm of summer.
For the serious shopper, this is
a mixed blessing indeed, as the
ever-elusive masterpieces are hid
den amidst a more massive mound
of mediocre material than usual.
Never fear, Fiscal Fidelity is
here, ready as always to separate
the audible from the abominable.
After tireless explorations of local
record stores, here are some of
the best fruits in the current crop.
Album/Cassette
"The Door to their Dreams:
Arista's 1988 Black Music Month

Collection" — Yes, this compila
tion starts with a song by Whitney
Houston, immediately relegating
it to the critical abyss called pop
music. Nonetheless, there are
several solid reasons for recom
mending this collection, a snappy
sampler of the current state of
R&B.
The first is sheer value: marked
with a price tag of under $5,
"Door" is simply the best bargain
currently offered. Even better, all
of the proceeds not claimed by
the record stores are being
donated to the United Negro Col
lege Fund, making the purchase
worthwhile even if Whitney Hous
ton is not your cup of tea.
Oh, and by the way, the music
is pretty good, too.
Erasure, "The Innocents" — It is
hard to believe that, after four
albums cast from the exact same
mold, Erasure remains as exciting
as ever. The partnership of Vince
Clarke (the pioneer of the premier
synth band Depeche Mode as well
as half of the superduo Yaz) and
vocalist Andy Bell has produced

another dozen songs that some
how seem to transend the category
of ear candy that they fall into.
"Ship of Fools," the single cur
rently receiving airplay, is one of
the strongest cuts, but the snappy
remake of the classic "River Deep,
Mountain High" is the real jewel
in Erasure's crown, ending the
solid effort in a most sterling man
ner. Check it out — though "The
Innocents" is not the most mem
orable record, it is certainly one
of the more enjoyable.
Singles
Patti Smith, "People Have The

Power" — Though Patti Smith
faithful may have a bit of trouble
recognizing the woman affec
tionately known as the priestess
of punk, the first single off of her
first album in eight years, "Dream
of Life," is a definite delight.
Smith retains her characteristic
ally activist strain in this tune, a
snappy ditty that states just what
the title suggests. A nice concept,
a nice song.
10,000 Maniacs, "What's The
Matter Here" — The latest release
from the surprisingly successful
"In My Tribe" album, this tune

picks up lyrically where Suzanne
Vega's "Luka" left off and further
lambasts the prevalent social ill
of child abuse. Though the dense
instrumentation and mellow
melody tragically detracts from
the sheer poetic power of the
lyrics (seeming almost inap
propriately pleasant in a song
about unpleasantness), "What's
The Matter Here" nonetheless is
an effort worthy of acclaim, as
few songs state their point more
succinctly and eloquently than
this impassioned plea.
Shona Laing, "Soviet Snow" —
The woman seen as one of New
Zealand's brightest lights has fi
nally entered the realm of her bill
ing. Though her debut album
"South" was frightfully uninspir
ing and her first single sadly un
interesting, the follow-up to "I'm
Glad I'm Not. a Kennedy" possess
a certain unidentifiable charm
that grabs hold after about the
sixth or seventh listening. It is
not a masterpiece and makes no
amazing statement, but it is
promising as well as addictive.
