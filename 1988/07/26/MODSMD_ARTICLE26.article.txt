# Sting
## Brings on the night... 
### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
In a dazzling show Friday at
Shoreline Amphitheater, Sting
and his back-up band of virtuosos
thrilled a packed house with a no
frills stage show highlighting the
great fusion of jazz and rock that
is Sting's music.
Sting's solo material came alive
with the help of stunning work
by keyboardist Kenny Kirkland
and guitarist Jeff Campbell.
The show surprisingly featured
a great deal from the huge library
of hits from Sting's Police days,
including "King of Pain", "The
World is Running Down" and the
classic "Don't Stand So Close to
Me."
The skill and depth of Sting's
supporting cast seemed at times
to overpower the old Police tunes,
but I found myself enjoying some
of the oldies more with the new
cast.
A jovial Sting played two en
cores, and without the stage gim
micks of some performers put on
a great show of his talent.
