## Wonders never cease in a wild week in sports 
### 
You never know what will happen in
the world of sports.
Just when everything seems to be
going wrong or coming to an end it's sud
denly back on track and coming on strong.
Take for example, Pedro Delgado, the
Boston Red Sox and the America's Cup.
Delgado, a Spaniard, had a seemingly
insurmountable lead in the 2,000 mile Tour
de France bicycle race and was already
proclaiming victory.
But one of Delgado's random drug tests
turned up positive. The organizers of the
event were ready to slap him with a 10
minute penalty that would have virtually
destroyed his chances of winning the race.

But before the penalty minutes could be
added, the test results had to be confirmed.
Sure enough, Delgado was again found
guilty.
So it was time for Delgado to remove
the yellow jersey worn by the leader of the
race, right? Wrong! It seems the substance
Delgado used (or someone slipped him, if
you believe his version) is not yet banned
by the international federation in charge
of bicycle racing.
It won't be illegal until September so no
penalty was assessed. And, yes, the Tour
de France has a new champion named
Pedro Delgado.
I don't have a clue what performance

enhancing miracle the lab technicians
found in Delgado's specimen bottle but if
it's bad enough to be illegal in September
why not make it illegal now.
It seems the attitude of athletes toward
drugs is "use 'em until they ban 'em."
According to many in bicycle racing, track
and the like, use of performance-enhancing
drugs is the rule and not the exception.
That kind of information made it all the
more enjoyable to read about Larry
Myricks, the long jumper, in Sports Il
lustrated. Myricks made a point of men
tioning that his refusal to use drugs may
have kept him from reaching the pinnacle
of his sport. But, he was at peace with
himself because he knew he had played by
the rules.
Sadly, few athletes in amateur athletics
— one of the great oxymorons of the '80s
when one considers the million-dollar-a
year earnings of track stars like Carl Lewis
and Edwin Moses — have the will to resist
the use of drugs that might give them an
edge.
The sports federations do little to help
the problem by allowing grace periods for
the use of any performance-enhancing
drugs or techniques.
It's time for every international sports
federation to put their collective foot down
now — not September — before the integ
rity of their sport is further damaged.
Eventually a struggling baseball team
comes to grips with the fact that
they're not as good as they thought
they were.
But first, they fire the manager.
Case in point is the Boston Red Sox.
They canned John McNamara as they
limped to a mediocre 43-42 record. And,
as is par for the course these days, they
tabbed one of their own as an "interim
manager."

An interim manager is a nobody who can
keep the job until a somebody is found to
replace them.
The Red Sox gave Joe Morgan the du
bious distinction of warming the hot seat
as they went searching for a full-time suc
cessor. No, not the Joe Morgan, the future
Hall of Famer who played second base for
the Big Red Machine in the '70s, but Coach
Joe Morgan, the erstwhile skipper of the
Class AAA Pawtucket Red Sox.
The Red Sox got a bit more than they
bargained for as the Morgan-led crew won
seven straight. Falling over themselves
with glee, management rewarded Morgan
with a contract for the rest of the season.
After placing his John Hancock on the
newly inked deal, Morgan led the Sox to
four more wins through Sunday.
Morgan obviously learned almost every
thing there is to know about managing in
his long career. It's clear he has the team
making all the rights moves at all the right
times. Fortunately for the boys from Bos
ton, Morgan knows everything about base
ball save one small item — no one ever
taught him how to lose.
The Sox are a mere game-and-a-half be
hind the division leading New York
Yankees and Detroit Tigers and closing
fast.
But Red Sox haters can satisfy them
selves with this: No matter how close they
come to winning it all the Red Sox 70-
year-championship drought will continue.
Even if the Sox are one strike away from
winning the World Series, the ghost of
Babe Ruth will reach down from on high
— like he did most recently in 1986 —
and push a routine ground ball between
the legs of an infielder and snatch defeat
from the jaws of victory.
But for now, let them enjoy it in New
England. It's got to be fun while it lasts.

Shut off the stove, pack your bags and
head for San Diego — the America's
Cup races are actually going to hap
pen.
Yes, you read that right, New York State
Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick
ordered the San Diego Yacht Club and the
Mercury Bay Boating Club of Auckland,
New Zealand to begin racing Sept. 19 off
the cost of San Diego.
Ciparick's decision also cleared the way
for the San Diego club to use the contro
versial catamaran it build to defend the
Cup it reclaimed for the United States in
1987.
Her ruling ends temporarily the legal
wrangling that has made a mockery of a
yacht race no one gave a damn about until
1983 when American Dennis Conner lost
the Cup to Australia.
Previous to that defeat, the America's
Cup had been bolted to a pedestal in the
lobby of the New York Yacht Club for
many of the 125-plus years the United
States held onto the Cup.
In the light winds oft San Diego, watch
ing yacht racing is normally almost as ex
citing as watching paint dry. However, with
the matchup between the slick catamaran
and the New Zealanders' mammoth sloop
the race may provide an interesting diver
sion.
Then, after it's over, we can return to
the way things have been done for decades:
a proper multi-nation regatta in 12-meter
yachts can be used to determine a chal
lenger for the Cup every four years.
And, we can once again have "an inter
national race on a grand scale among boats
on the seas, and not a land-bound battle
among clever lawyers in the courthouse,"
as Ciparick put it.
