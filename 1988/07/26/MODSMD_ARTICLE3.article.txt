# Stanford's papers project unaffected
## Martin Luther King papers caught in legal dispute

Coretta Scott King is challenging Boston
University in two lawsuits over the per
sonal papers of her late husband, civil
rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., but
the suits should not threaten Stanford's
involvement in the ongoing Martin Luther
King, Jr. Papers Project here.
In December 1987, Coretta Scott King
filed a lawsuit against Boston University
in hopes of retrieving some 80,000 of the
original papers that her husband donated
to that university's library in 1964.
In April, Boston University filed a coun
tersuit in an effort to keep the papers.
Both suits are filed in Boston.
Martin Luther King Jr.'s papers, includ
ing his letters, speech transcripts, notes,
articles and other documents, were included
in the original gift to Boston University.
The rest of King's papers, numbering
around 100,000, are currently in the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent So
cial Change in Atlanta, Georgia.
Coretta Scott King wants to unite all of
the papers in one location — the King
Center of which she is president and chief
executive officer.

Both Boston University and the King
Center support their claim for the papers
by invoking the claim that Martin Luther
King Jr. would have sided with them. The
late civil rights leader's final intentions are
somewhat debatable since King, assas
sinated in 1968, did not leave a will.
Coretta Scott King asserts that the only
reason the papers were ever in Boston was
to protect the documents during the 19605,
a safeguard at a time when many arson
attempts were made upon civil rights
leaders' papers.
She claims that her late husband in
tended for the papers to eventually be re
turned to his home in the South.
Assoc. History Prof. Clay borne Carson,
director of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project that is located here at Stan
ford, said he would like to see the resources
consolidated. Carson flies routinely be
tween Stanford, the King Center and Bos
ton University to gather information for
the Stanford project.
However, Carson would not reveal his
preference for the location of the papers.

the papers all in one location,"
Carson said.
Carson was appointed director
and senior editor of the project at
its 1985 inception by King herself.
The Martin Luther King Jr.
Papers Project here is affiliated
with the King Center.
Melvin Miller, an attorney for
Boston University in the case and
a trustee there, claims that the
University has the right to all of
the King papers — including those
currently placed in Atlanta.
Before the lawsuit was filed, ac
cording to Miller, Boston Univer
sity offered to make high quality
copies of the papers and put them
at the King Center.
"It is our suggestion that there
be two complete collections, one
in Boston and one in Atlanta,"
Miller said. "Unfortunately, Mrs.
King isn't willing to make the
concession."
"The point is that Dr. King left
the papers with Boston Universi
ty," Miller added. "The man
(King) was a great leader and he
has expressed his wish. What
should we do? Trample his desire?
All we know is what he wanted
us to do, and we're happy to do
that."
