# Radioactive waste released into drain
## University says contamination is minimal 
### Helen Willey 
University officials announced
yesterday that between June 24
and July 19 Stanford illegally
dumped hazardous chemicals into
the local sewer system in amounts
which exceeded federal regula
tions.
According to University Senior
Health Physicist John Holmes,
the California Department of
Health Services may cite Stanford
for mistakenly piping radioactive
substances into a storm drain for
close to a month. The drain leads
directly into the San Francisco
Bay.
Amounts of calcium-45 in ex
cess of federally regulated con
centrations were piped into the
storm sewer along with carbon-14
and tritium. At concentrated
levels, these three radioactive
chemicals can increase the risk of
cancer, Holmes said.

Yet University officials contend
that the level of radioactivity in
the water is miniscule.
"The tests that we conducted
did not detect any amount of ra
dioactivity in the water other than
the background radioactivity
that's always there," Holmes said.
According to Holmes, if some
one drank the contaminated
sewage water, it would increase
the risk of cancerous death 10
times â€” from .0001 to .001. He
equated this risk of death with
the risk involved in driving a car.
University officials said the con
tamination began on June 24
when Operations and Mainte
nance personnel re-piped radioac
tive wastes into the storm drain
while attempting to fix a leaky
pipe in the Biological Sciences
Building.
Without contacting University
authorities, the plumbers diverted
waste from its normal flow into
the storm drain.
The University did not discover
that the radioactive chemicals
were emptying into the storm
drain until July 19 during a
routine inspection. On that date,
the pipe was fixed and is now
secure, according to Health and
Safety Specialist Jennifer Gates, .
"The plumbing department
didn't think it through or check
with anybody," said Phil
Hanawalt, chair of the Biological
Sciences Department where the
contamination began. "I saw the
pipe, but I just figured that they
must know what they're doing."
Hanawalt added that the inci
dent comes at a "touchy" time,
because the University must
prove that its activity is harmless
to the environment in order to
receive approval for several pend
ing environmental impact reports.
". . . Bay Area environmental
groups are looking for any oppor
tunity to say that Stanford Uni
versity is irresponsible," Hana
walt said. Yet, he insisted the in
cident "says nothing about how
responsible biologists are in
honoring environmental safety."
Hanawalt said the incident is

ironic and described Stanford's bi
ology department as the the "most
environmentally conscious in the
whole country."
University officials said they
are confident that the incident will
not recur.
"We are taking steps to see that
it does not happen again," Gates
said. She added that the Health
and Safety Department will edu
cate the plumbers who work in
chemical areas such as the Bio
logical Sciences Department to try
to prevent such mistakes from
happening in the future.
But local homeowners ques
tioned the effectiveness of Stan
ford's response to the water con
tamination.
"What is Stanford doing right
now beyond educating the plum
ber to see that it doesn't happen
again?" asked Inge Harding-
Barlow, vice-president of the Bar
ron Park Association. An environ
mental action group, the Barron
Park Association has often criti
cized Stanford for polluting sur
rounding communities.
Harding-Barlow said she is con
cerned because there have been
five similar incidents in the past
two years in which officials did
not take ample precautionary
measures to prevent further con
tamination. In those cases, con
tamination did occur again, she
said.
