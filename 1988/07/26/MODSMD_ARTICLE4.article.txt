# Radioactive waste released into drain
## University says contamination is minimal 
### Helen Willey 
University officials announced
yesterday that between June 24
and July 19 Stanford illegally
dumped hazardous chemicals into
the local sewer system in amounts
which exceeded federal regula
tions.
According to University Senior
Health Physicist John Holmes,
the California Department of
Health Services may cite Stanford
for mistakenly piping radioactive
substances into a storm drain for
close to a month. The drain leads
directly into the San Francisco
Bay.
Amounts of calcium-45 in ex
cess of federally regulated con
centrations were piped into the
storm sewer along with carbon-14
and tritium. At concentrated
levels, these three radioactive
chemicals can increase the risk of
cancer, Holmes said.

Yet University officials contend
that the level of radioactivity in
the water is miniscule.
"The tests that we conducted
did not detect any amount of ra
dioactivity in the water other than
the background radioactivity
that's always there," Holmes said.
According to Holmes, if some
one drank the contaminated
sewage water, it would increase
the risk of cancerous death 10
times â€” from .0001 to .001. He
equated this risk of death with
the risk involved in driving a car.
University officials said the con
tamination began on June 24
when Operations and Mainte
nance personnel re-piped radioac
tive wastes into the storm drain
while attempting to fix a leaky
pipe in the Biological Sciences
Building.
