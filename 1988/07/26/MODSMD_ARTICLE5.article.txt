# USW's negotiations with Stanford begin
## 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
Potentially heated negotiations
between the University and the
United Stanford Workers union
begin today, initiating a bargain
ing period which both parties hope
to resolve before the current con
tract expires August 31.
Earlier this month, both the
USW and the University submit
ted contract proposals for what
will be the sixth contract between
Stanford and the USW.
In 1982, negotiations resulted
in a 30-day union strike. And
recent tensions between the union
and the University suggest that
negotiations this time around will
also be disputed strongly.
Looking ahead to the negotia
tions, USW Representative
Reuben Serna said the University
— like any other large company
— will "want the union to roll
over and give back a lot of stuff
originally fought for."
University spokesman Michael
Vartain declined to comment on

the University's position or the
contents of its proposal.
Serna speculated that the Uni
versity will try to "curtail" union
access to its membership.
He also speculated that the Uni
versity will attempt to "interfere"
with the collection of union dues.
Vartain said the University has
been "studying the union's pro
posals" but refused to discuss
specifics of the contract. He said
negotiators will provide the Uni
versity position on both the union
and the University proposals "at
the bargaining table."
"If both sides work productive
ly, then there is a good chance
for agreement," Vartain added.
The main issues and concerns
voiced by the USW are as follows:
Grievance procedure
According to Serna, many em
ployee grievances can be handled
through union representatives
and supervisors. But the union
takes formal action when the
grievance involves the firing of
workers or discrimination.
Currently, the University hears
only two cases per month and
"scheduling is slow." Because of
the "backlog," a case may take as
long as four years to conclude,
Serna said.
Employee benefits
A workers' survey earlier this
year revealed that worker benefits
— especially the union pension
plan — are among the most im
portant issues in the contract for
union rank-and-file members.
Health and Safety
According to Serna, the Univer
sity has allegedly "violated basic
health and safety regulations set
down by the county, the state and
the government."
SLAC job-shopping
According to Serna, there are
200-300 bargaining unit jobs at
SLAC being performed by non
union workers, who the union
calls "job-shoppers." These job
shopppers have increased sub
stantially at SLAC since 1984,
when only 50 bargaining unit jobs
were performed by job-shoppers,
according to the USW.
