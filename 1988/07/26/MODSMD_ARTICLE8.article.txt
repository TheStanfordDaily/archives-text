# Stanford water cutback beats the heat wave
## 
### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
Despite the strain imposed
by the recent heat wave, Stan
ford appears to have met the
38 percent cutback in July
water usage imposed by the
San Francisco Water Depart
ment.
According to Cheryl Jensen,
manager of Operations and
Maintenance, during the period
that ended July 18 and in
cluded the hottest days of the
heat wave, Stanford actually
reduced water usage by 39 per
cent.
Jim Cooney, general mana
ger and chief engineer of the
San Francisco Water Depart
ment, said on July 17, the hot
test day of the heat wave, "we
were well over our allotment
system wide."
The target amount for the
whole department for the
month of July was 256 million
gallons per day. Cooney said
that on July 17 water usage
overreached that allotment and
peaked at 320 million gallons.
But, he added that "last year

we averaged 356 million gal
lons a day in July," so that
savings still occurred.
Jensen said the significant
savings made earlier in the
month of July allowed Stanford
to come in under its alloted
limit. Although usage at the
University did increase with
the temperature, the fact that
Stanford still came in at better
than a 38 percent cutback
"means that we were saving a
whole lot earlier," Jensen said.
If Stanford had not met its
cutbacks, Cooney said it would
have been fined. According to
Cooney, the Water Department
could not make special al
lowances for the unusual heat
nor increase its customers al
lowances.
"The fact is we don't have
any water up in the mountains.
I'd like to make allowances, but
Mother Nature just isn't let
ting us do it," Cooney said.
The University will have to
cutback 36 percent in the
month of August, but Jensen
said she feels "real comforta
ble" about Stanford's ability to
conserve if people return to
their pre-heat wave habits.
