# Making Giant dreams a reality
## E. Palo Alto still vying for stadium 
### Jock Friedly 
If some East Palo Alto officials
have their way, the new home of
the San Francisco Giants will be
relocated within 10 minutes of
Stanford.
Giants owner Bob Lurie said
yesterday he expects to have site
proposals for a new Giants sta
dium by August and that East
Palo Alto will be a compet
itor. Lurie said that Santa Clara
County is also expected to have a
proposal in by August and that
the City of San Francisco is also
investigating possibilities for
building a new Giants stadium in
the city.
The Giants will be leaving their
current home in Candlestick Park,
when Lurie's lease runs out in
1994. Lurie said yesterday that
he will definitely not renew the
lease because of Candlestick's bad
weather and lack of parking and
good access roads.
"I don't think Candlestick Park
is a major league ballpark," Lurie
said.
The City of East Palo Alto has
expressed interest in the stadium
as well as an industrial park to
boost tax revenues and promote
commerce in the city.
A task force, known as the the
Ravenswood Industrial Park
Master Plan Task Force, has set
up five committees to study the
possibility of building a stadium.
They will prepare a draft proposal
for the Giants that will be pre

sented at a public hearing before
a bid is submitted.
But according to Myrtle Walker,
chair of the task force, no date
has been set for the public hearing
on the stadium proposal. After
the public hearing, the task force
will revise the proposal and then
give it to the East Palo Alto City
Council.

"If the city council says yes that
we will do this, I think the chances
are good (that we will get the
stadium)," Walker said. She noted
that the city stands a good chance
because of low land prices and
good weather.
Earlier this year, East Palo Alto
residents objected to plans for a
new stadium and requested that
an industrial park also be built
to strengthen commerce in the
city. Current plans include both
an industrial park and a stadium.
In addition, Walker said she ex

pects that a very important factor
in the decision will be whether
the state legislature approves the
building of Highway 109, which
is expected to pass on the out
skirts of East Palo Alto. A new
highway would ease the greatly
increased traffic flow in the city,
she said.
However, Sunnyvale Mayor
Larry Stone said he is skeptical
that East Palo Alto will be able
to solve traffic problems stem
ming from a new stadium. Stone
is chair of the Santa Clara County
Stadium Task Force that is sub
mitting the other mtyor proposal
to the Giants.
Stone said he thinks that it will
be hard for East Palo Alto to com
pete because of Santa Clara's su
perior infrastructure of roads.
"It might have the best access
of any stadium in the country,"
Stone said, adding that Santa
Clara has a good economic base
on which to build a stadium.
In addition, he said that East
Palo Alto's motivation to build
the stadium as a catalyst for eco
nomic development is unwise.
Pointing to the experience of other
stadiums in the country, Stone
said that building new stadiums
has not been an effective way to
spark economic growth.
Contrasting Santa Clara's at
tempt to get the stadium with
East Palo Alto's, Stone said, "It's
like building the star on the top
of the Christmas tree rather than
the trunk."
