Stroking the keys of the world's most
imposing organ, Annette Richards
coaxes a resounding chord from the
monster of Mem Chu. Richards, a
graduate student who hails from
England, will play more of the music
to soothe the beast in concert this
Sunday evening, including 16th and
17th century Italian works.
