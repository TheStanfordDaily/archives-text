# 'Star Wars' defense boosted
## Secretary of Energy supports Teller, blasts Livermore critic 
### Jock Friedly 
Hoover Institution Senior Fel
low Edward Teller received a solid
boost in his battle over the
feasibility of a "Star Wars" missile
defense system when U.S. Secre
tary of Energy John Herrington
tried to silence one of Teller's
chief critics last Friday at the
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.
Herrington was on hand to
praise Teller and criticize Liver
more physicist Roy Woodruff, who
has sparred with Teller for several
years over the effectiveness of the
X-ray laser as a component of the
"Star Wars" system.
Herrington told reporters at
Livermore that the Hoover senior
research fellow is a "national as
set" whose "credibility is very,
very high."
Teller, known as the father of
the hydrogen bomb, was the
driving force behind President
Reagan's plan for a Strategic De
fense Intitiative, announced in
1983. Optimistic reports by Teller
that the X-ray laser would be an
effective weapon for destroying in

coming Soviet ICBMs convinced
administration officials to fund
the project.
Early on, Woodruff disputed
Teller's claims about the X-ray
laser. In 1983, Woodruff rejected
Teller's claim that the laser was
ready for the "engineering phase,"
the stage for building the weapon.
Today, the X-ray laser still has
not entered the engineering phase.
Similarly, Woodruff challenged
Teller's early assertion that a
desk-sized laser could destroy the
entire Soviet land-based missile
force.
The Woodruff-Teller contro
versy heightened last fall when a
letter written by Woodruff was
made public and came to the at
tention of U.S. Rep. George
Brown, D-Calif. Criticisms of Tel
ler in this letter triggered an in
vestigation by the Government
Accounting Office.
The GAO report was released
last week and supported many of
Woodruffs claims.
But at the press conference,
Herrington attacked Woodruff for
airing his dispute with Teller in

public. He said he would put
money on Teller.
"Woodruffs remarks are being
exploited and being used by anti-
SDI forces and interests, and
therefore is not to the good of the
program, nor to the good of the
laboratory. I do think he is being
used," Herrington said.
"I think there should be free
dom of expression within the lab
oratory, but I don't favor having
scientists go public on opposite
sides of the issue if it's going to
be damaging to the laboratory,"
the energy secretary added.
But Stanford Political Science
Prof. David Bernstein said the
public should know about both
sides of the debate since public
funds are used to fund the project.
"My own preference is that
people within the bounds of clas
sification should be free to speak
out," Bernstein said.
Rick Malespino, a spokesman
for UC Berkeley which oversees
the Livermore Lab, said the uni
versity sees its "management role
as being supportive of scientific
debate and dissent if possible."
