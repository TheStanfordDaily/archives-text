# Ask not for whom the siren wails...

### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Today, at 11 a.m., about 200
disaster warning sirens in Santa
Clara, Alameda and San Mateo
counties will be turned on for a
noisy two-minute safety test.
Although six sirens will sound
throughout Palo Alto, none will
ring at Stanford. According to

Police Services Assistant Director
Frank Jurian, there used to be a
siren at Stanford's fire station but
it was "totally ineffective" because
people living on the other side of
campus could not hear it. Jurian
said today's blast should not be
"all that distinct" on campus.
The sirens will sound for a one
minute blast, followed by a minute
of silence. Finally, a one-minute
wavering sound will end the test.

Every three months this test is
conducted by the counties to en
sure that their warning devices
work safely in the event of a major
disaster. During an actual emer
gency, the sirens would sound for
three to five minutes.
A steady blast would denote a
peacetime emergency while a
wavering tone or short intermit
tent blasts would signal an imme
diate attack.
