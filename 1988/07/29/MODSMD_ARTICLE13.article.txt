# Both houses pass drought aid bills
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - With strong
bipartisan support, the House and
Senate overwhelmingly approved
separate bills yesterday providing
nearly $6 billion in aid to farmers
hard-hit by the worst drought
since the Depression.
House members approved their
bill 368-29, while the Senate ap
proved its version 94-0.
The sweeping legislation, which
would compensate farmers for a
portion of the devastating crop
losses they have suffered in recent
months, now goes to a House-
Senate conference committee,
where members will attempt to
iron out differences in the two
bills.
Although President Reagan has
expressed strong concerns about
costly, "special interest" provi
sions in the drought legislation,
he has urged speedy passage of a
bill and is expected to sign one
into law.
"The need for this measure is
obvious," said Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., the ranking Republican on
the Senate Agriculture Commit
tee. "Our heartland has been
devastated by one of the worst
droughts in our history. Now, we

are trying to alleviate the worst
of its impacts."
Democrats and Republicans
joined in support of the legisla
tion, which would be financed
through federal price support pay
ments to farmers that !">ave gone
unspent while the drought per
sisted and the price of many crops
has increased.
"We are sending a strong mes
sage to the farmers of this country
today," said Rep. E. "Kika" de la
Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee.
"The message is: Hold on, help is
on the way, you will survive."
However, Reagan administra
tion officials put a damper on
Thursday's debate by releasing
discouraging news about the na
tion's budget deficit. They indi
cated that Congress might have
only $5.9 billion to spend this year
on "big ticket" items — including
the drought bill, welfare reform,
anti-drug legislation and other
proposals — before hitting the
deficit figure that would trigger
automatic, across-the-board
spending cuts in many programs.
Indeed, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-
N.M., the ranking Republican on
the Senate Budget Committee,

said the drought relief, welfare
reform and anti-drug bills now
pending before Congress might
trigger billions of dollars in cuts
under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. It was not
clear how the conflicting priorities
could be accommodated. The cost
of both the House and Senate ver
sions of the drought bill was es
timated at $5.8 billion.
"We don't have much wiggle
room this year," added Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan. "We can't load this
(drought bill) down with extra
spending and stay within our
budget limits."
But some members could not
resist the temptation. The House
held an angry debate, for example,
over an amendment that would
significantly increase the level of
the milk price supports that the
government pays to dairy farmers
for surplus production.
Members from non-dairy dis
tricts charged that the proposal,
authored by Rep. James Jeffords,
R-Vt., was a selfish attempt to
increase federal subsidies for
farmers who were already treated
generously by the drought legis
lation.
