# Iran softens its stance on direct peace talks with Iraq
## 
### 
UNITED NATIONS - Iraq ap
peared to be winning the first
round in its bid for direct peace
negotiations with Iran as Iranian
officials conceded yesterday that
they would accept face-to-face
talks if asked by U.N. Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
The Iranians made the conces
sion in public statements in which
they insisted that they have ac
cepted the demands of last sum
mer's Security Council Resolution
598 calling for a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq War.
Iran's acting ambassador,
Mohammed Ja'afar Mahallati,
was non-commital when asked
whether Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati would eventu
ally sit at the same table with his
Iraqi counterpart, Tarik Aziz. But
he said that "we will cooperate"
in any demand by Perez de Cuel
lar.
Perez de Cuellar voiced his pref
erence Thursday for face-to-face
talks rather than the indirect
talks he conducted Tuesday and
Wednesday, meeting separately

with the two foreign ministers.
Neither Velayati nor Aziz ap
peared at U.N. headquarters
Thursday as the secretary general
studied Iran's responses to his in
itial peace proposals. Iraq has not
yet provided its answers.
A U.N. official, speaking on con
dition that he not be identified,
predicted, "They should both be
in the same room by next week."
Perez de Cuellar has said he
hoped to be able to set a date for
a cease-fire after a military team
he dispatched to the region last
week returns to New York Tues
day.
"I am not stuck," the secretary
general said in reply to a reporter
who asked if the negotiations have
stalled. "The talks are making
progress."
In the war, the two sides con
tinued battling for advantages
that might help them in bargain
ing on an eventual cease-fire, news
agencies reported.
