Two senators decry 'setup'
WASHINGTON — Angry Democratic and Re
publican leaders of the Senate elect Committee
on Intelligence accused the Reagan administra
tion yesterday of a "heavy-handed" attempt to
"set up" Congress for blame as the source of
news reports that President Reagan has author
ized covert activities in Panama.
Committee Chair David Boren, D-Okla., and
Vice Chairman William Cohen, R-Maine, em
phatically denied that intelligence panel members
leaked information from a top secret briefing on
the operation Tuesday to The Washington Post
and other news organizations.
Instead, Boren suggested the administration
itself may have leaked the information to boost
prospects for Vice President Bush in the Nov. 8
general election. Cohen said blame for the leak
may have been laid on Congress to derail legis
lation to require notification of congressional
leaders within 48 hours of the start of a covert
operation.
At a news conference, Boren and Cohen also
sharply criticized the administration's policy on

Panama and said the administration may have
disclosed the operation to give the impression
that it was doing something concrete to topple
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
"We talk loudly and carry a small stick. . . .
What has been done obviously has failed," Boren
said.
Union has hurrahs for Bentsen
SAN FRANCISCO — Democratic vice presi
dential nominee Lloyd Bentsen basked yesterday
in the warmth of support from trade union mem
bers who fled his party in droves four years ago,
winning rousing cheers as he denounced "seven
years of do-nothing Republican indifference."
"It's been a tough time for American workers,
who are running just as hard as they can, barely
managing to stay even. ..." Bentsen told the an
nual convention of the 1.1 million member United
Food and Commercial Workers union here. "The
status quo has to go."
