## Meese not welcome 
### 
Meese's appointment
is an embarassment

WHEN HOOVER Di
rector W. Glenn
Campbell invited
Edwin Meese 111 to join the
Hoover Institution, the jury
was still out on the numer
ous allegations of political
and ethical misconduct
facing Meese.
Now the verdict is in, and
Meese should be out.
When the special prosecu
tor investigating Meese an
nounced that he would not
prosecute Meese on criminal
charges, Meese claimed vin
dication and began packing
his bags to save his admin
istration further embarass
ment. But when the facts
came out, it was announced
that Meese could indeed
have been prosecuted for
two separate felonies, and
that further investigation of
his conduct would occur.
To bring Meese to Hoover
is an embarassment to the
University as well as to the
Hoover Institution, and
should be eliciting strong ob
jections from students as
well as University officials.
Both President Kennedy's
and Provost Rosse's silence
on this travesty should end
and they, as well as the
Board of Trustees, should
issue vehement objections.
The objections to Meese
coming to Hoover do not

stem from his ideology, nor
from any desire to suppress
academic freedom. Instead
they stem from a recogni
tion that honesty and integ
rity hold precedence over
such attributes as historical
or controversial value and
national prominence.
While much is left to be
revealed about the ethics
and conduct of Meese,
enough has been exposed to
clearly disqualify him from
what should be an honorable
Hoover appointment.
But regardless of what the
investigation of Justice De
partment ethics officials
reveals, Meese should not be
honored with a position at
Hoover.
The Meese-Hoover affilia
tion that Campbell has in
stigated will undermine the
standing of the other
Hoover scholars, discredit
ing them in the eyes of the
public as well as diminishing
their respect among their
fellow academicians. These
scholars should question the
values and motives of their
retiring director, and if this
proves ineffective they
should call upon the new di
rector to undo this folly.
While Campbell prepares
to vacate his lengthy post
as Hoover director, he
should refrain from extend
ing obviously improper in
vitations to individuals who
so plainly disregard the pro
priety and respectability
that such honorable posi
tions warrant.
