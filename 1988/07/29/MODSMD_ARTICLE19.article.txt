SOME OF you are going to
read this column and think
I've gone off my rocker, be
cause nothing I say in it is going
to directly concern either Stan
ford, global politics or any of the
other intellectual topics you tradi
tionally see displayed in such
solemnity on the Opinions page.
No, my friends, this column is
going to be about an album.
I can hear it now: "Leave it on
the Entertainment page!"
It shakes people up to realize
that music can be something more
than an ethereal after-hours
leisure pursuit.
That's why Public Enemy's new
album, "It Takes A Nation of Mil
lions to Hold Us Back," is such a
mind-opener. Its music makes
every other so-called "political al
bum" released this decade look
like the equivalent of an Erma
Bombeck column. And yes, con
fessedly, its music is (despite the
disclaimers in the grooves) racist.
Public Enemy is a group of rap
pers from the mean streets of New
York City, and it shows in their
music. Everything is a blitz of
samples, staccato rhymes and un
settling background noise.
Beyond the music (which is so
frantic and inimical that even few
rappers, with their by now co

opted braggery and danceable
beats, would be generous enough
to call it that), which is disorient
ing enough in itself, lies the mes
sage — which to these rappers is
the entire point.
There are plenty of steely rants
against the music establishment
here — not white radio, which is
patently beneath contempt — but
black radio itself, where treacly
love ditties brainwash young
minds into torpor and com
placency.
It's all a conspiracy to these
dudes, who take their political
cues from the likes of Malcolm X
and Louis Farrakhan. The drug
problem is part of a century-old
design to ensure that the blacks
don't revolt against their in
humane conditions.
The white man, with his TV
ads of gold chains and sleek
BMWs, is constantly gorging the
black mind with the view that the
materialistic life is the only life
worth leading.
I'm certainly not condoning the
racist sentiments of Public
Enemy, if for no other reason
than two wrongs don't make a
right. What I'm saying is that this
music glosses nothing over. It
doesn't conveniently ignore
Howard Beach, or Mayor Koch or

anything else. Nothing is left on
the cutting room floor to please
the three-piece suits in the
boardroom.
If you are someone who holds
to the standard cant that we've
come a long way in race relations
and everything will be solved if
we just smile enough and broad
cast icons of Martin Luther King,
Jr., then this album — and the
message it puts forth — are
clearly not for you.
But it seems to me that the
first step in combatting prejudice
is confronting it. If that means
listening to an album that, in yell
ing about prejudice, itself commits
errors of the same category, so
be it.
"The truth is like rain, man. It
falls on everyone, no matter who
or where they are." This accord
ing to the group. I leave it to you
to listen to the album.
