# Victim's parents sue University
## Negligence alleged in drowning tragedy 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
The parents of Robert Yuan, a
Stanford senior who died in a
canoeing accident at the Stanford
Sierra Camp in May, have sued
Stanford, charging that the Uni
versity was negligent in not pre
venting their son's drowning.
Filed in the Santa Clara Supe
rior Court July 25, the suit names
Stanford University, the Stanford
Alumni Association and the Stan
ford Sierra Camp as defendants
and asks for an unspecified sum
of money.
According to Jack Slobodin, at
torney for the Yuans, the couple
decided to file suit because the
Stanford Sierra Camp staff was
"negligent in failing to provide ad
equate waterfront safety" during
a retreat when several seniors
took the camp's canoes onto Fal
len Leaf Lake.
During a brief interview in
which he broke down several
times, Mark Yuan said when he
and his wife went to retrieve the
body from the camp, they discov
ered that no safety measures had

been taken that could have saved
their son.
"We saw that there was
negligence on the part of the camp
and that's why we decided to sue,"
he said.
Known as the Stanford Senior
Weekend, the retreat at the camp
is sponsored annually by the Stan
ford Alumni Association.
After his canoe capsized May 8
in the turbulent waters near the
center of the lake, Robert Yuan
succumbed to hypothermia and
drowned. June graduate Terry
Bernstein, who was also in the
canoe, survived the accident.
Although no party has been
served with the suit, many Uni
versity officials expressed surprise
that the Yuans had decided to
sue. The officials, several of whom
had maintained close contact with
the Yuan family from the time of
the accident through graduation
this spring, said they had not been
forewarned.
"The announcement of the suit
was a surprise to us," said William
Stone, the director of the Alumni
Association. "Unfortunately no
one saw fit to inform us" about it.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons added that he was "sur
prised because the University
really went to great lengths to
respond to both the situation and
especially to the grief of the fam
ily, including Jennifer (Robert's
sister, who is a junior at Stan
ford)."
"I'm disappointed," Lyons said
"because the grief we saw in the
family — and felt — is only made
worse by a suit."
In the days and weeks following
the accident, Stanford officials
met with the Yuans several times,
helping them to organize a
memorial service in Memorial
Church and a candlelit vigil near
the Dish. The family has also ap
proached Stanford about building
a campus memorial to their son.
At his family's request, the Uni
versity also arranged for Robert
Yuan to receive his biology degree
posthumously and sent represen
tatives to his funeral in Southern
California.

"I think there was a lot of con
tact with the family basically be
cause Stanford meant a lot to the
family," said Ann Porteus, one of
Robert Yuan's resident fellows in
Roble. Porteus, who attended
Robert Yuan's funeral, added that
an "incredible number of caring
people" went out on a limb for
the Yuan family.
In order to prevent similar ac
cidents, Slobodin said the Yuans
may send a letter — written by
them and friends of their son —
to the University listing precau
tions staff members at the Sierra
Camp should take in the future.
However, Director of the Stan
ford Sierra Camp Chris Thomsen
said no changes have been made
in the camp's operating proce
dures.
"We believe we run a generally
safe operation," Thomsen said.
Although the Alumni Associa
tion's insurance company has al
ready conducted a private inves
tigation of the accident, Slobodin
said the prosecution now plans to
make its own investigation. He
added that he expects the case to
go to trial in nine months to a
year.
