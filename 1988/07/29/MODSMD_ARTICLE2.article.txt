### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
The parents of Robert Yuan, a
Stanford senior who died in a
canoeing accident at the Stanford
Sierra Camp in May, have sued
Stanford, charging that the Uni
versity was negligent in not pre
venting their son's drowning.
Filed in the Santa Clara Supe
rior Court July 25, the suit names
Stanford University, the Stanford
Alumni Association and the Stan
ford Sierra Camp as defendants
and asks for an unspecified sum
of money.
According to Jack Slobodin, at
torney for the Yuans, the couple
decided to file suit because the
Stanford Sierra Camp staff was
"negligent in failing to provide ad
equate waterfront safety" during
a retreat when several seniors
took the camp's canoes onto Fal
len Leaf Lake.
During a brief interview in
which he broke down several
times, Mark Yuan said when he
and his wife went to retrieve the
body from the camp, they discov
ered that no safety measures had

been taken that could have saved
their son.
"We saw that there was
negligence on the part of the camp
and that's why we decided to sue,"
he said.
Known as the Stanford Senior
Weekend, the retreat at the camp
is sponsored annually by the Stan
ford Alumni Association.
After his canoe capsized May 8
in the turbulent waters near the
center of the lake, Robert Yuan
succumbed to hypothermia and
drowned. June graduate Terry
Bernstein, who was also in the
canoe, survived the accident.
Although no party has been
served with the suit, many Uni
versity officials expressed surprise
that the Yuans had decided to
sue. The officials, several of whom
had maintained close contact with
the Yuan family from the time of
the accident through graduation
this spring, said they had not been
forewarned.
"The announcement of the suit
was a surprise to us," said William
Stone, the director of the Alumni
