## Conservatives should reconsider their method of debate 
### 
LIKE ALMOST anyone
confronted with a new
environment, I arrived at
Stanford amazed by what every
one else considered mundane.
However, despite differences
in climate, attitude and culture,
there are some striking
similarities between the West
and the East. Of these, the one
that fascinates me most is the
effect that modern thought has
had on the manner in which we
address political debate.
I believe that in the celebra
tion that ensued from our
release from the old standards
of truth, which would have us

believe that our perspectives are
in some sense categorical, we
forgot that behind our subjec
tive experience lies elements of
objectivity.
While both the left and the
right are guilty, conservative
rhetoric seems more ready to
appeal to this line of ar
gumentation. For example, con
servatives believe Stanford
needs to preserve the Hoover
Institution to provide the Uni
versity with all viewpoints, so
that students can accurately
make their own opinions.
Indeed, the more bold ones con
demn the University for missing

the opportunities the Reagan
library presented.
This type of logic leads con
servatives to ignore issues that,
as members of the University,
should concern them. Ronald
Reagan's policies have been
particularly vicious in their
attack on education. But those
in favor of a more developed
conservative community forget
to mention this. Instead, they
implicitly make the claim that
they are merely expressing a
point of view and all viewpoints
are equal.
In fact, they are not. As
members of the University,

conservatives, as well as every
one else, have a responsibility
to look at what the policies they
advocate mean to those who
want an education.
One of the most significant
achievements of U.S. thought
has been to develop subtle no
tions of what it means to argue.
Unfortunately, some have taken
this too far. They prevent real
debate by reducing contention to
perspective, and in the process,
they undermine the type of
debate that can lead to growth.
