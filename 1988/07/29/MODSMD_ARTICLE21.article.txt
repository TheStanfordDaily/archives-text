# Can 'pearly whites' be a sign of racism?

Maybe it would have been
more acceptable to Henry Organ
of the Office of Development if
the teeth of medical student
Riley Williams had been yellow.
The caption under his
weightlifting photograph then
would have mentioned his
clenching lemony yellows.
No, I suppose that could be
interpreted by the insightful

Organ as "bordering on racism"
as well.
Racism is a real problem at
Stanford, but statements such
as the one submitted by Organ
are counterproductive. They fail
to point out the true manifesta
tions of the racist attitudes on
campus, and serve only to
alienate many who might other
wise be inclined to join in the
fight against racism.
