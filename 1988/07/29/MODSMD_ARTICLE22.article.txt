# University police don't sell any bikes
## 
### 
Recently the Summer Visitor's
Guide stated that the Stanford
Police Department sometimes
sells used bikes. Please remove
this information from your files.
This is definitely not the case.
We collect and process found
or abandoned bikes in an at
tempt to locate the original
owners. After a holding period,
the unclaimed bikes are turned
over to the Marines, Goodwill

or an auction agency in Santa
Clara County.
We do not sell bikes â€” how
ever, we suggest that people
who would like to obtain one at
a low cost go to Goodwill, check
announcement boards and clas
sified ads, or ask at shops. If
you have any questions, please
call me at 723-9633. Thank
you!
