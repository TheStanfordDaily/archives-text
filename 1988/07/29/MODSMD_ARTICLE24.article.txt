## Dukakis' promise to reform nation's health care shows little promise 
### 
IN HIS recent acceptance
speech for the 1988 Demo
cratic presidential nomina
tion, Massachusetts Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis was long on
"American dreams" and short
on specifics.
This was a small concession
to reality, since, as Walter Mon
dale found out the hard way,
tax-and-spend liberalism is still
out of favor with the average
U.S. voter. The successful
Reagan administration tax re
forms and the unfortunate
federal budget deficit deadlock
have combined to put a crimp
in the pork barrel policy agenda
of free-spending Washington
liberals, at least for the near
future, regardless of who wins
in November.
Nevertheless, there is one
Dukakis dream that we all
should take very seriously; par
ticularly those of us who, at
some point, will get sick or pay
taxes. That is his promise to
reform the nation's health care
system.
At a time when countries like
Sweden and Canada are seeing
serious flaws in one-size-fits-all

nationalized health care pro
grams, Dukakis, as governor of
the one-party (Democratic) state
of Taxachusetts, has signed into
law the most far-reaching ex
pansion of state-financed health
care spending in decades.
By mandating a stiff 12 per
cent auxiliary payroll tax on
every salary paid by employers
who do not meet the state
defined criteria for health insur
ance coverage, that state's gov
ernment will be socking it hard
est to the small businesses and
low-skilled workers who can
least afford it.
Under Dukakis' program,
small businesses, which typically
have to pay significantly higher
per-person health insurance
premiums, will suffer higher
payroll costs and further erosion
of their competitive position.
While in principle, it is
laudable that part-time, low
skilled or low-wage workers be
offered guaranteed health insur
ance, the benefits to these
workers under the Dukakis
program are completely illusory.
Massachusetts businesses will
now have to decide which of

their employees are worth the
mandated additional $1,680
annual payroll hike. The answer
is not likely to be those who are
part-time, those who are inexpe
rienced, those who are receiving
low wages and those who are
low skilled.
In fact, this mandatory health
coverage is exactly equivalent,
from the employer's perspective,
to an 84-cent hourly pay raise
for those workers not covered
by health insurance meeting the
new state guidelines.
Many of these least
advantaged workers, specifically
the ones who belong to families
already covered by health insur
ance, would much prefer getting
an 84-cent per hour pay raise,
rather than having it to buy
someone else's health insurance,
but all of them will be lucky
indeed if they escape the Duka
kis health program with their
jobs intact.
Economists agree that an
84-cent per hour increase in
mandated payroll taxes will
reduce employment by 4-5 per
cent among those workers at
the lowest end of the pay scale.

The irony is that, once
thrown out of work or unable
to find a first job, these people
will be able to rely on the most
generous Medicaid program in
the nation. In 1986, Massachu
setts spent 172 percent of the
Medicaid average across all
states. But if the only thing
Massachusetts workers wanted
was health care and other wel
fare benefits, they wouldn't
have looked for a job in the
first place. The Dukakis pro
gram is like hitting a gnat with
a sledgehammer.
With this knee-jerk expansion
of health care coverage, Dukakis
has neglected the real failures
of U.S. health care. These fail
ures have more to do with the
financial incentives faced by
hospitals, doctors and other
providers than with consumers,
patients or taxpayers. What is
needed in health care is not
more money, but rather incen
tives to better spend the money
that is already there.
In strong liberal tradition,
there are only very weak and
fuzzy considerations of the
supply side impacts in the Du-

kakis program.
In his home state's Universal
Health Care program, Dukakis
has pulled together a distinctive
political contraption that we can
expect to see at the national
level if he is elected president.
Much of the cost of the pro
gram will never appear on the
state budget or show up in tax
hikes because it is paid for by
mandatory employee benefits.
Only workers who lose their
jobs or employers who can't
meet their payrolls will know
the difference.
Dukakis can take all of the
credit for the plan, and because
the program won't be imple
mented until 1992, the piper
won't be paid until after then.
In fact, as Dukakis and his
advisors are well aware, one of
the few things that would bail
out this costly health care ex
periment is if he succeeded in
convincing the rest of the coun
try to go along with a similar
program at the expense of all of
us taxpayers and patients.
