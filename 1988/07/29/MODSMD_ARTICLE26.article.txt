## A 						Desire Named Acting: project tests players' stamina 
### Seung Choi 
Stanley Kowalski lumbers
across the stage and stops in front
of his house on Cemetery Street.
He cries "Steellaaaaaa!" and,
catching sight of her, throws a
pack of raw meat in her direction.
So goes the opening of Tennes
see Williams's "A Streetcar
Named Desire," one of the classic
works of the modern stage. This
summer the Stanford Actor's
Project — the only professional
theater company affiliated with
Stanford — will present a "fresh
interpretation" of the work, ac
cording to the director, using
projected images and avant-garde
set design.
"The whole effect will be im
pressionistic, almost surrealistic,"
said Reid Edelman, artistic direc
tor of the company. He said the
sets will carry "suggestions of
rooms, suggestions of walls."
Experimentation is the lifeblood
of the Stanford Actors Project,
which was formed in 1986. Edel
man said he decided to form a
company when he saw that no
training ground existed for Stan
ford actors who were thinking of
going professional.
As a result, the project was
created to "bridge" inexperienced
actors with the professional envi
ronment they seek.
"It's a place where inexperi
enced students can learn from real
professionals, in a professional at
mosphere." Students interested in
pursuing careers in acting work
along side professionals — there
are an even number of profession

als and amateurs in the cast.
In return for this privilege,
Edelman said the actors work
long hours to improve their skills.
For the first year of its existence,
the core group of five actors
visited local high schools and pre
sented sketches from plays by Wil
liams. The troupe would act out
the scene and then talk with the
audience about what the play
meant.
"It was a means to get young
people excited about theater,"
Edelman said. He emphasized
that actors and audience alike had
learned from the intensive study
of the playwright.
After working together for a
year, Edelman said both he and
the cast felt the company was
ready for a challenge — hence
"Streetcar." The ambiguities and
thematic complexities of the play
open up a wide range of possible
interpretations, according to Edel
man.
" 'Streetcar' is really unique in
that it is at the same time an
actor's play and a director's play."
He said there is a great deal of
freedom for actors and directors
to influence the message of the
play.
Set in a seedy, working-class
section of New Orleans, "Street
car" examines the conflict be
tween illusion and reality in the
context of a struggle between two
in-laws. Blanche dußois, a faded
Southern belle with skeletons in
her closet, seeks refuge with her
sister Stella. Stella, married to the
bestial Stanley, remains powerless
as he assaults Blanche, first ver

bally and then physically.
According to Edelman, the play
has traditionally been interpreted
in two different ways. Some direc
tors view Blanche contemptuous
ly, considering her the insidious
serpent bringing deception and
unnecessary complexity into Stan
ley's simple Eden. Other critics
and producers have sided with
Blanche, seeing her as a victim of
Stanley's cruelty and insensitivi
ty.
Yet, the director said he hasn't
confined the players to either of
the two camps, but has adopted
a "wait and see" outlook on the
slant of the production, hinting
that the company would construct
its own interpretation.
"The amazing thing about this
play is that Williams won't really
let you dismiss either of his
characters," he said.
"Yes, Blanche is selfish, deceit
ful and destructive. But she's also
fighting for her survival, and the
play is her last chance at life.
"Likewise, while Stanley is
cruel, violent, and insensitive, his
actions stem from an instinct for
self-preservation. Blanche is a
dangerous threat to his world."
The actors are also tinkering
with the ambiguities of the play.
Jay Holland, who plays Blanche's
potential husband, said "it's hard
to say which interpretation we're
doing, because we're still formu
lating the possibilities."
The Actors Project will be per
forming "A Streetcar Named
Desire" in the Little Theater from
August 10 through 28.
