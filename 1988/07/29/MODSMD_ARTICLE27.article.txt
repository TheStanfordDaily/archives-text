# Center holds wealth of diverse public service opportunities

Beyond the manicured lawns of
Stanford an entire world awaits.
That world sometimes appears
frightening and unfriendly, but its
needs are pressing and complex.
At the Public Service Center, stu
dents can get involved in the com
munity and, according to staff at
the center, enrich their academic
experiences.
"I would like to have every stu
dent involved at one time, and to
recognize that they have a respon
sibility to their community," said
Catherine Milton, director of the
center.
Milton and Assoc. Director Tim
Stanton feel that Stanford stu
dents can sometimes forget about
the world beyond Palm Drive and
about the crucial role they can
play in helping less fortunate com
munities. Behind the diversity of
the programs at the center lies a
common goal: getting students to
reach beyond themselves, accord
ing to Milton.
Students offer similar reasons
for getting involved. "I wanted to
look beyond my school and my
social life.... I wanted to get
away from just focusing on me,"
said Smita Singh, a senior public
policy major, who is helping plan
this fall's "You Can Make a Dif
ference" conference on the envi
ronment.
Certainly Stanford President
Donald Kennedy would be thrilled
to hear that. In his commence
ment address to the class of 1983,
Kennedy urged graduates to con
sider the rewards of community
involvement. The following year
Kennedy asked Milton to help es
tablish a center on campus that
would make public service oppor
tunities more visible and more ac
cessible to students.

The center has since grown into
a bustling community, filling
Owen House with many different
types of service organizations. As
director of the center, Milton over
sees current activities and works
on developing new community
service programs. She said main
taining the quality of the pro
grams is the most important part
of her work.
Funding for programs such as
these comes from Stanford Uni
versity general funds, as well as
from personal donations and con
tributions from companies such
as Apple and the Rolm Corpora
tion.
Money from these companies
goes to fund a wide variety of
programs.
For example, the student-run
Stanford Volunteer Network has
been running community service
projects for over two years. One
of these takes Stanford students
to the Ravenswood Elementary
School in East Palo Alto, where
they tutor individuals who need
help.
A tutor training program en
sures that Stanford tutors will be
able to handle any situation that
may crop up. Tutors can receive
credit for their efforts but most
do it for personal satisfaction.
Reach Out Today, a massive
one-day annual service effort, in
volves hundreds of students in
community efforts. Students ren
novate community facilities, open
a temporary soup kitchen, visit
with the elderly and work with
the needy. This year Reach Out
Today will take place in October.
The Stanford Program On
Nutrition is a simple yet ingenious
idea that can be credited to two
concerned Stanford students.
Seniors Doug Abrams and Amira
Leifer each realized campus eating

establishments wasted a huge
amount of food every day. They
realized the food could easily be
saved and given away rather than
thrown out.
Now, thanks to the efforts of
Leifer, Abrams and other volun
teers, leftovers are taken regularly
from nine fraternities and row
houses, seven eating clubs and two
academic lounges. The food is
frozen, packaged and sent off once
a week to a variety of distribution
centers in the Palo Alto area.
Through the Public Service
Center, Stanford also puts on the
annual "You Can Make A Differ
ence" conference. Every year a
committee of Stanford faculty and
students decides on a topic and
works together to stage a confer
ence that will educate members
of the Stanford community about
the particular issue.
"I like doing this because it
gives me a feeling that I'm doing
something constructive. ... It
brings together a group of people
to work on a variety of issues,
and it's very inspirational." Singh
said.
The 1988 conference will focus
on environmental problems and
possible solutions. Speeches and
workshops will examine topics
such as clean air and water, urban
parks and open space, noise pol
lution and the production and dis
posal of toxics.
The center also coordinates in
ternships and a fellowship pro
gram to encourage students to try
public service. Stanford-In-
Government offers positions in
government at the state and na
tional level. Each year more than
100 students are sent to Washing
ton, D.C., where they observe
policy making firsthand.

renovated a home in East Palo Alto and opened a temporary soup
kitchen.
