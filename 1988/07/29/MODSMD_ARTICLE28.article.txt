# Discovery may repair nerves

An electronic microchip with
the potential for repairing
damaged nerves has been devel
oped at Stanford.
The application, which should
be ready in about 10 years, will
be able to permanently attach
prosthetic limbs to amputees
and to restore feeling and func
tion to organs or limbs that have
suffered damage, according to
Greg Kovacs, a doctoral student
in electrical engineering.
Kovacs has prepared "a one
sided chip which has 10,024
little electrodes on it." He ex
plained that the chip, which has
numerous tiny holes drilled in
it, is implanted in a patient so
that the fibers of damaged
nerves can grow through the
holes.
The chip then processes sig
nals from the nerve, allowing it
to function normally as a link
between an organ and the brain
or central nervous system.
Kovacs describes the chip as
"a general-purpose interface.
You could put it in like a probe
or radio antenna, and try to
make it small, so it doesn't dis
turb anything. So it's like stick
ing a probe into the brain."
In normal surgical procedure,
when a nerve is severed, each
of the many fibers, or axons,
that make up the nerve need to
be sewn together. Kovacs's
method would eliminate the
need for this. Instead, the chip
would reroute signals from
crushed or severed nerves.
"It's important to understand

that when you reroute, it's not
like rerouting calls on a
switchboard," Kovacs explained.
"Axons need to be functionally
grouped, but one-to-one remap
ping is not necessary."
The chips are made by a proc
ess known as "plasma etching."
Kovacs says the method has
been used before and that he
has only "fine-tuned existing
technology." In this method the
chips are placed in a vacuum
chamber, gases such as fluorine
are added and radio-frequency
energy is applied. This produces
"free radicals," or charged
atoms, which oscillate perpen
dicularly to the surface, creating
holes in the chip that go straight
up and down.
According to Kovacs, writing
the software that will interpret
the signals the chip recieves will
be as difficult as designing the
chip was. This is because when
the chip is implanted into neural
tissue, "you make a channel into
an information source that's in
credibly dense."
Once this channel is estab
lished and the source has been
tapped, a computer is used to
figure out the signals received.
Kovacs asserts, however, that
while this is a difficult task, it
is feasible.
"The rate that electronics
technology evolves is unbeliev
able," said Kovacs. "The proc
essing power of computers is
going up by leaps and bounds
now. Already, you could design
a computer the size of a loaf of
bread (that would have) easily
100 times the power of a Mac
intosh."

Kovacs said one of the poten
tial hazards involved in his
method is the undesirable heat
that would be generated by the
chip, once implanted and func
tioning.
"Any machine of any kind is
not 100 percent efficient,"
Kovacs said. "What that means
is, some of the energy ends up
being heat."
According to Kovacs, the so
lution is to keep the heat
generated by the chip at a min
imal level, rather than trying to
cool it.
"I've taken great pains to see
that the prototype runs on low
power," he said, explaining that
the current chip runs on 2/1000s
of a watt, which is a vanishingly
small amount.
"If you yell at the top of your
lungs, you can generate about
five watts of power," he added.
A great deal of work remains
to be done before the potential
benefits of the chip can be
realized, however. First, the chip
must be implanted in a test sub
ject, along with electrodes to
measure the properties of the
connection between nerves and
the chip.
Right now, Kovacs describes
his next step as designing an
improved chip, which would
have more complex circuitry on
it. However, he said he plans to
keep the design specification as
simple as possible, and expects
to have the new chip ready by
the beginning of next year.
"Now that I've learned, I'm
getting a better idea of what I
need to design," he added.
