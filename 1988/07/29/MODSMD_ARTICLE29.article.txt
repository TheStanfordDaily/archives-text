## Diversions 
### Karin McDonald Staff writer 
A dilettante is a dabbler, someone regarded not so highly as
being involved in everything, but never excelling in any one thing.
I have high regard for dabblers, and have, myself, enjoyed
dabbling every once and again. This week, there are smatterings
of different events and occasions you should extend yourself into
enjoying. Try a little dabble.
The Berkeley Buzz
The prime place to broaden your horizons is Berkeley, a mere
orange-line's ride away on BART. While there, there are three
things you have to experience: food, culture and food. For food,
the only way to do Berkeley is to reserve a spot at that pinnacle
of California Cuisine, Chez Panisse.
If you don't do cities, you'll probably be inclined toward
something less chic, something with less savoir faire — something
that requires a bib. Flint's Barbeque is the reigning palace of
messy food, and will provide you with a mighty meal. Come on,
aren't you tired of eating rabbit food?
Good For Your Soul
But for those of you who can't feast like a king, don't turn
to liposuction yet.
Saturday night go dance to the
African beat of O.J. Ekemode &
The Nigerian Allstars, all at the
Omni. If you are looking for a
more relaxing evening, you can
digest some great blues at Eli's
Mile High Bar in Oakland. It's
dark, small and has some of the
best blues in the area. Bring your
own T-Bird.
Artsy — Filmsy
On the cultural side of town, I
highly recommend going to the
Berkeley Museum of Modern Art.
It's just a neat place, period. The
building itself is an architectural
work of modern art. If you are
interested in a good movie, the
Pacific Film Archive is showing a
celebration of Argentinian Film
throughout the weekend. The
films range the gamut from po
litical documentary to satire, and
showcase the award-winning di
rection of Argentinian films since
1984.
From City to City
San Francisco has its share of
cultural nooks as well, mostly lo
cated in or around Golden Gate
Park. The De Young Museum, the

Japanese Garden and the
Aquarium are interesting places
to sightsee new and living art.
But whatever you do, don't forget
to go to the Exploratorium.
If a museum is neat, then this
place is neat-o. You're never too
old to go to the Exploratorium,
the original intellectual toy facto
ry. They have a new exhibit on
memory that should be unforget
table.
Low culture
On Sunday, you can die laugh
ing for nothing at the Free Com
edy Show, happening at the Polo
Fields at noon. Cheaper than
gumballs, this annual show is al
ways a popular event, so try to
go early. And because it's in San
Francisco, you'll probably see
Robin Williams or Whoopi
Goldberg show up as "surprise"
acts at some point.
Sunday's Sweetest Sounds
Finally, one of my favorite art
ists and the king of mellow,
George Winston is at Davies Sym
phony Hall Sunday night. Win
ston is the master of the new
classical folk concert music, which
brought Windham Hill into the
spotlight recently. His perform
ance at the beautiful Davies Hall
will be very special, so don't miss
it. Until next time, enjoy.
