## Diversions 
### Karin McDonald Staff writer 
A dilettante is a dabbler, someone regarded not so highly as
being involved in everything, but never excelling in any one thing.
I have high regard for dabblers, and have, myself, enjoyed
dabbling every once and again. This week, there are smatterings
of different events and occasions you should extend yourself into
enjoying. Try a little dabble.
The Berkeley Buzz
The prime place to broaden your horizons is Berkeley, a mere
orange-line's ride away on BART. While there, there are three
things you have to experience: food, culture and food. For food,
the only way to do Berkeley is to reserve a spot at that pinnacle
of California Cuisine, Chez Panisse.
If you don't do cities, you'll probably be inclined toward
something less chic, something with less savoir faire â€” something
that requires a bib. Flint's Barbeque is the reigning palace of
messy food, and will provide you with a mighty meal. Come on,
aren't you tired of eating rabbit food?
Good For Your Soul
But for those of you who can't feast like a king, don't turn
to liposuction yet.
