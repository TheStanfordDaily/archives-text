# Chace accepts presidency of Wesleyan University
## 
### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
After months of speculation, English
Prof. William Chace was chosen this week
to become the 14th president of Wesleyan
University.
Calling his decision to leave Stanford
after 20 years the "biggest case of mixed
feelings I've had in my life," Chace said
he would try to "tie up the ends" prior to
assuming the presidency some time before
Novemeber 1.
Both Chace and Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Jean Fetter were among the
final three candidates for the presidency,
but Fetter withdrew her name from con
sideration citing "personal and professional
reasons."
A graduate of Haverford College in Penn
sylvania, Chace has shown an ongoing in
terest in Haverford and small liberal arts
schools like it. Last March, he was one of
four final candidates in the running for

the presidency of Reed College in Oregon.
Like Haverford and Reed, Wesleyan has a
small undergraduate population — 2,700
students.
Located in Middletown, Conn., Wesleyan
is known for its emphasis on an under
graduate education in the liberal arts.
While at Stanford, Chace has played a
central role in emphasizing the University's
own commitment to a liberal arts educa
tion. In 1976, he introduced a resolution
to the Faculty Senate that established Stan
ford's Western Culture requirement.
This year, while he fought to retain the
essentials of the requirement, he also helped
fashion the compromise that altered the
core and changed the course's name from
Western Culture to Cultures, Ideas and
Values.
Chace later defended the compromise
from criticism by Secretary of Education
William Bennett. "I feel very happy about
the CIV thing being in very good shape,"
Chace said yesterday."I don't think I'm

leaving giant messes behind on the floor."
For four years, Chace also served as as
sociate dean of Humanities and Sciences
and chair of the Faculty Senate. Most re
cently, he has been the vice president for
Academic Planning and Development and
is partially responsible for raising $1.1 bil
lion as part of the University's Centennial
Fundraising Campaign. History Prof. John
Wirth will take over this position on Sept.
Provost Jim Rosse, acting University
president while Donald Kennedy is on va
cation, said of Chace's departure that "Wes
leyan is the winner, and Stanford the
loser." Chace "has always been a loyal and
very strong supporter of Stanford," he
added.
Although Chace said Wesleyan "does not
have any glaring problems," he added that
he plans to bring some new ideas to the


William Chacc
school. Among his goals at Wes
leyan are to meet a great number
of community members and to
foster a "greater sense of involve
ment in the university" on their
part, he said.
High on both Chace's and the
Wesleyan Board of Trustees' list
is "to help the university under
stand what a little university is."
Unanimous approval of Chace
by the Wesleyan Board of Trus

tees came at a meeting July 23
in New York City, according to
Public Affairs Officer Martin
Waters. The vote followed an ex
tensive search procedure that in
volved over 300 prospective can
didates.
Wesleyan President Colin
Campbell announced his resigna
tion last October, Waters said,
adding that the search for a new
president involved months of
"lengthy interviews" and re
search. Campbell has headed Wes
leyan for 17 years — his reign
will officially end on Aug. 1.
