# Break your fast with flair
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
Admit it — cold cereal with milk gets dull. Break
fast is the most important meal of the day, so why
not make it the best? It's not hard to do in the
Stanford area, as any of the following eateries are
sure to make your morning.
Hobee's
67 Town and Country Village
Palo Alto
With its country kitchen atmosphere and won
derful cinnamon orange tea, Hobee's is perhaps best
known for its coffeecake. And with good reason. A
large piece of homemade blueberry coffeecake with
crunchy brown sugar cinnamon topping and melted
butter is arguably a meal in itself... and a delicious
one at that.
Just as good as the coffeecake are the many egg
dishes that Hobee's offers. The Florentine scramble
— spinach, mushrooms and jack cheese in scrambled
eggs — is a particular favorite. All of the omelettes
are appealing. "Auntie's omelette" has sauteed
mushrooms and cheese and the "Hi Hat" has
hashbrowns, ham and cheese inside. All egg dishes
come with a choice of toast, coffeecake or home fries.
Home fries are something of a specialty here. My
favorite are the "Blissful Browns" — golden potatoes
topped with onions, mushrooms, and melted cheese.
In addition, Hobee's offers delicious granola with
walnuts and raisins, served with sliced bananas and
milk. The pancakes and french toast (with a variety
of bread to choose from) are also worth tasting.
If the aromatic tea isn't your beverage of choice,
why not try an "energy blend"? Hobee's combines
frozen yogurt, milk, honey and strawberries,

blueberries or bananas (or all three) in a thick cold
breakfast shake. Protein powder added on request.
Hobee's is open for breakfast every morning and
offers daily specials in addition to its regular menu.
It's all you can ask for in a breakfast restaurant.
Prices range from $3 to $8, with specials sometimes
higher.
Late for the Train
150 Middieficld
Menlo Park
A pretty Victorian dining room and the smell of
freshly brewed coffee greet breakfasters at Late for
the Train, where even old standbys like french toast
are never ordinary. (Their's comes smothered with

almonds using either whole wheat or challah, a
delicious egg bread.)
If big fluffy pancakes tempt you, prepare to in
dulge at Late for the Train. The whole grain pan
cakes with apples or other fresh fruit of your choice

baked in and accompanied by pure
maple syrup are delicious.
Eggs make up a good portion
of the menu here — omelettes
range from simple avocado or
veggie to a unique fresh fruit and
cheese combination. Choose from
toast, tamaried potatoes (Late for
the Train's own home fries) and
scones to complement your eggs.
Speaking of scones, these are a
specialty here. Freshly baked with
jam or apple butter on the side,
these cannot be beat. They are
perfect alone, with cantaloupe, the
chunky fruit salad, or a capuccino.
Late for the Train serves a variety
of espresso drinks, as well as reg
ular coffee and different teas.
Still can't decide? "Josh's Bus
Boy Special" gives you a chance
to sample the eggs, a pancake and

tamaried potatoes. And the "Lazy
Susan" offers a choice of three
from a list including eggs, scones,
fresh fruit, cottage cheese, toast
and juice. Bring a hearty appetite.
Open every day but Monday,
Late for the Train offers hearty
and delicious breakfast fare with
a flair. Prices range from $4 to
$13.
Suzanne's Muffins
176 Univeristy Avenue
Palo Alto
If you don't have the time for
a sit-down breakfast, but still feel
the need for something different,
Suzanne's offers freshly baked
muffins that will make you forget
the word "diet."
Think bran muffins are boring?
Then, you haven't tried Suzanne's
"Bran Bran Bran": deliciously
moist with a delicately crunchy
top, these are anything but basic.
Although the muffin selection

changes daily, you can usually
count on finding these.
Other "regulars" are the
blueberry (loaded with fresh
berries) and "A-maze-ing Corn,"
that definitely live up to their
name. Chunky apple (with hints
of cinnamon) and bran blueberry
also appear regularly.
Special muffins like zucchini
bran are interesting. The oatmeal
chocolate chip muffins are deca
dent — Suzanne's oatmeal muf
fins alone are sinfully delicious.
Lemon poppyseed, carrot pine
apple ... the list goes on.
Don't make the mistake of
missing the extra big cinnamon
rolls. With or without raisins,
these come warm with a sweet
drizzled glaze. All of Suzanne's
baked goods taste great with a
choice of coffees and teas.
Whether you eat in or take them
on the run, a quick stop at
Suzanne's Muffins will easily
make your morning.

these cannot be beat. They are
perfect alone, with cantaloupe, the
chunky fruit salad, or a capuccino.
Late for the Train serves a variety
of espresso drinks, as well as reg
ular coffee and different teas.
Still can't decide? "Josh's Bus
Boy Special" gives you a chance
to sample the eggs, a pancake and

tamaried potatoes. And the "Lazy
Susan" offers a choice of three
from a list including eggs, scones,
fresh fruit, cottage cheese, toast
and juice. Bring a hearty appetite.
Open every day but Monday,
Late for the Train offers hearty
and delicious breakfast fare with
a flair. Prices range from $4 to

Suzanne's Muffins
176 Univeristy Avenue
Palo Alto
If you don't have the time for
a sit-down breakfast, but still feel
the need for something different,
Suzanne's offers freshly baked
muffins that will make you forget
the word "diet."
Think bran muffins are boring?
Then, you haven't tried Suzanne's
"Bran Bran Bran": deliciously
moist with a delicately crunchy
top, these are anything but basic.
Although the muffin selection

changes daily, you can usually
count on finding these.
Other "regulars" are the
blueberry (loaded with fresh
berries) and "A-maze-ing Corn,"
that definitely live up to their
name. Chunky apple (with hints
of cinnamon) and bran blueberry
also appear regularly.
Special muffins like zucchini
bran are interesting. The oatmeal
chocolate chip muffins are deca
dent — Suzanne's oatmeal muf
fins alone are sinfully delicious.
Lemon poppyseed, carrot pine
apple ... the list goes on.
Don't make the mistake of
missing the extra big cinnamon
rolls. With or without raisins,
these come warm with a sweet
drizzled glaze. All of Suzanne's
baked goods taste great with a
choice of coffees and teas.
Whether you eat in or take them
on the run, a quick stop at
Suzanne's Muffins will easily
make your morning.
