# Break your fast with flair
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
Admit it — cold cereal with milk gets dull. Break
fast is the most important meal of the day, so why
not make it the best? It's not hard to do in the
Stanford area, as any of the following eateries are
sure to make your morning.
Hobee's
67 Town and Country Village
Palo Alto
With its country kitchen atmosphere and won
derful cinnamon orange tea, Hobee's is perhaps best
known for its coffeecake. And with good reason. A
large piece of homemade blueberry coffeecake with
crunchy brown sugar cinnamon topping and melted
butter is arguably a meal in itself... and a delicious
one at that.
Just as good as the coffeecake are the many egg
dishes that Hobee's offers. The Florentine scramble
— spinach, mushrooms and jack cheese in scrambled
eggs — is a particular favorite. All of the omelettes
are appealing. "Auntie's omelette" has sauteed
mushrooms and cheese and the "Hi Hat" has
hashbrowns, ham and cheese inside. All egg dishes
come with a choice of toast, coffeecake or home fries.
Home fries are something of a specialty here. My
favorite are the "Blissful Browns" — golden potatoes
topped with onions, mushrooms, and melted cheese.
In addition, Hobee's offers delicious granola with
walnuts and raisins, served with sliced bananas and
milk. The pancakes and french toast (with a variety
of bread to choose from) are also worth tasting.
If the aromatic tea isn't your beverage of choice,
why not try an "energy blend"? Hobee's combines
frozen yogurt, milk, honey and strawberries,

blueberries or bananas (or all three) in a thick cold
breakfast shake. Protein powder added on request.
Hobee's is open for breakfast every morning and
offers daily specials in addition to its regular menu.
It's all you can ask for in a breakfast restaurant.
Prices range from $3 to $8, with specials sometimes
higher.
Late for the Train
150 Middieficld
Menlo Park
A pretty Victorian dining room and the smell of
freshly brewed coffee greet breakfasters at Late for
the Train, where even old standbys like french toast
are never ordinary. (Their's comes smothered with

almonds using either whole wheat or challah, a
delicious egg bread.)
If big fluffy pancakes tempt you, prepare to in
dulge at Late for the Train. The whole grain pan
cakes with apples or other fresh fruit of your choice
