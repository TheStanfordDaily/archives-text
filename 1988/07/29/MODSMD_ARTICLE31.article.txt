"The Dead Pool"
Century Cinema 10

Dirty Harry is back and he's
into a whole new game. He's at
the bottom of the list in"The
Dead Pool," a morbid betting
game perpetrated by a schlock
movie director as well as a list of
people who are dying right and
left.
"The Dead Pool" is also the
newest movie to star Clint
Eastwood and a .44 Magnum.
Time has passed everyone's favor
ite tough guy — no one wants to
make his day. Worst of all, they
want to have his story.
It is the 80s and poor Dirty
Harry doesn't quite know how to
handle a world of pushy reporters
and image conscious police depart
ments. The police department
wants good copy on Inspector
Harry Callahan. They want him
to be understanding to reporters
who push cameras into his inves
tigations. The want him to stop
destroying police cars. They want
him to stop shooting people.
They want too much.
The department then gives him
a new partner (Evan Kim) and
tells him to be nice to TV reporter
Samantha Walker (Patricia
Clarkson) — oh, and by the way,
solve the murder of a doped-up
rock-and-roller.
Inspector Callahan is having a
calm lunch in Chinatown when a
couple crooks hold up a restaurant
across the street. He sends his
partner Quan for help while he

wanders into the restaurant and
seats himself. The bad guys of
course try to leave quickly. Cal
lahan reminds them they forgot
their fortune cookie and reads it
to them.
Expecting something like
"Make my day" or "Do you feel
lucky?" You're close. Do the let
ters SOL mean anything?
Dirty Harry then shoots the
tarnation out of the bad guys,
saving one for his partner. Quan
kicks and punches his opponent
and takes him into custody. Cal
lahan looks puzzled.
Callahan looks puzzled
throughout most of the movie.
Getting shot at seems a little
boring to him. Even the assas
sination attempts by Uzi-toting
baddies seems only to put a minor
dent in Harry's day. His car was
in much worse shape.
For a shoot-em-up this is a
pretty good movie. It is reasonably
well plotted, has a few novel twists
(especially the car chases), and
has the noble moralities one ex
pects of a crusader.
Dirty Harry is the quintessen
tial lawman; he always has been
and always will be.

"Phantasm II"
Fremont Hub 8 Cinema
.*{9400 Argonaut & Walnut Ave.

It took nine years for the sequel
to "Phantasm" to be released, and
the way Phantasm II turned out
maybe they should have spent a

few more years on it.
Everyone's favorite flying slice
and-dice machine is back with a
purpose — or at least the produc
ers want you to think the chrome
servants of the Thin Man have a
purpose.
Many years ago I remember a
very scary movie about kids
sneaking into a mortuary and un
covering inhuman activities along
with a couple of flying chrome
balls that seemed to have no fur

ther purpose than to suck the
brains of anyone they happened
to impale on their handy-dandy
attachments. After eight years (in
the movie, eight years have
elapsed) the balls are better, but
the rest of the movie could — no,
should — have stayed locked in
the vault where terrible TV pilots
go-
The best parts of Phantasm —
long labyrinthine corridors, the
reflections in the balls as they

flew around and the crotchety
Thin Man (Angus Scrimm) —
were stolen out of the first movie.
The new stuff was hoped to make
it more "mainstream" and it did
(if you think that 1,001 stories
about a pair of people wandering
around the country searching for
some great evil to fight is main
stream).
Mike (James Le Gros) survived
the first encounter with the Thin
Man, but he wound up in a mental
institution for eight years. Reg
(Reggie Banister) also survived
the first movie. Together they
travel the backroads of the West
in a supercharged Barricuda
(Hemicuda) searching for the
Thin Man and his hoard of
reanimated munchkins.
Almost half of the movie is of
Mike and Reg searching, playing
with homemade flame throwers
and trying to convince themselves
the Thin Man is real.
Finally they come to Perigord,
Oregon, a tiny town with a huge
cemetary. The kind of place the
Thin Man loves. Perigord, like
many small towns in tall-and
loathsome's path looks like a ghost
town and the cemetary is dug up.
At this point the movie picks
up somewhat. The balls make
their first appearance, the long
corridored mortuary reappears
and the answers to a few ques
tions are to be found beyond a
door only the balls can open.
Big deal. Do yourself a favor
and skip this movie. Go back to
Phantasm, a movie more in line
with it's title.
