## Cy Young battle: lefty vs. righty 
### 
Frank Viola and Roger Clemens are engaged
in a duel for the ages.
Both are having spectacular seasons on
the pitcher's mound — Viola for the Minnesota
Twins and Clemens for the Boston Red Sox.
Their respective teams are out of first place
but within striking range of the division leaders.
The two sport similar records. Viola, at 16-3,
is a notch ahead of Clemens, no slouch at 14-5.
They have allowed an identical number of hits
(134) and walks (34).
Their earned run averages are also quite
similar. Viola has logged a 2.32 ERA while
Clemens has chalked up a 2.25.

Despite these similarities, the two are very
different pitchers. Clemens, of course, is a right
hander and Viola is a southpaw.
Viola's loss yesterday ended a 19-game home
winning streak. He hadn't lost at the Metrodome
since May 22, 1987.
Clemens, despite his stellar numbers, has been
much more effective on the road. At Fenway, he
is a very mortal 3-5 with a 3.84 ERA.
Viola is a strikeout pitcher to be sure. He has
punched out 121, placing him third in the Amer
ican League.
Clemens, however, is The Strikeout Pitcher.
Rocket Roger, as he is known in Boston, has
sent 219 batters back to the dugout in disgust
already this season. He has a shot to become

only the second man ever to strike out more
than 350 in a season. The other is Nolan Ryan
— he K'd 383 once.
Viola allows only 9.79 baserunners per nine
innings, only 7.87 hits per nine innings and has
a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.56-to-l. Each of
these is an impressive stat.
Clemens allows 8.46 baserunners per nine in
nings, only 6.80 hits per nine innings and has
a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 6.44-to-l. Each of
these, particularly the last one, is a nearly un
believable stat.
The two premier pitchers in the American
League this year are going toe-to-toe, mano a
mano in the battle for the AL Cy Young Award.
If either man falters even slightly, the other
should walk away with it hands down.
Today, Roger Clemens seems a slight favorite
to bring home his unprecedented third straight
trophy, but you'd be a fool to completely count
out Frank Viola.
Another interesting race is shaping up for
AL Rookie of the Year.
After being spoiled in recent seasons by
Jose Canseco, Wally Joyner, Mark McGwire,
Kevin Seitzer, Danny Tartabull, Ruben Sierra
and the like, there is not a single player deserving
of the award this year.
Since someone has to win it, however, the best
rookie in the AL is Brian Harvey of the California
Angels. Working in relief, Harvey has compiled
a 4-3 record and a stellar 2.41 ERA. He has only
allowed 55 baserunners in 52 innings of work
and has struck out 43.
If the media gets caught up in the Walt Weiss
hype and gives him the trophy, perhaps the award
should be abolished. Despite his overblown rep
utation, Weiss is 13th in fielding among starting
AL shortstops and he's batting a miniscule .234
with only 28 RBI.
