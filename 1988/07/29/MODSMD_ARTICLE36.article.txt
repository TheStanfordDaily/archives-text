# Stanford professors smooth the way to Korean peace

### Aamer Hai 
With the Seoul Olympics just around the
corner, eight Stanford professors have been
working to settle a peace between North
and South Korea, two countries which have
been technically at war for the last 38 years.
At a June conference in Central Asia,
the professors met with scholars from both
the United States and the Soviet Union to
propose methods for ending the ongoing
tensions between the two Koreas.
According to International Strategic In
stitute member Gordon Chang, the confer
ence might be partially responsible for
recent encouraging developments between
the North and South.
Although the two countries have not met
face-to-face in more than two years, this

Extensive U.S.-Soviet
cooperation could potentially
resolve the 'explosive situa
tion' in the Koreas, accord
ing to the proposal.

week the South reportedly accepted North
Korea's proposal to discuss ways in which
the North could participate in the upcom
ing Olympic Games. In addition, North
Korea has offered a Non-Aggression Pact
as well as a plan for both Parliaments to
meet.

Chang, who coordinated the project, said
the conference set a "very successful prec
edent" by producing some significant pro
posals that could very well effect
governmental policy in both countries.
Chang added that he was optimistic that
the Olympics would be peaceful and would
"go on without incident."
A proposal written by members of the
conference suggests means for building
trust between the two countries. According
to the proposal, both countries should give
advance notification of any military exer
cises. The North and South should inspect
each other's military sites and foreign ob
servers could act as mediators during the
inspections, the proposal suggested.
In addition, the proposal stressed that

the United States and the Soviet Union
should take active — though non-intrusive
— roles and establish more "human con
tact" with the countries. Extensive U.S.-
Soviet cooperation could potentially resolve
the "explosive situation" in the Koreas,
according to the proposal.
Pointing to the Reagan admistration,
Chang said the government was "danger
ously shortsighted and complacent in not
seeking to reduce tensions in Asia." The
Asian-Pacific region is linked to the eco
nomic future of the United States and
stability there is crucial to this country's
own interest, according to Chang.
He noted that there has been "some im
provement" although the U.S. government
is still hesitant about becoming involved
with negotiations between the two Koreas.
