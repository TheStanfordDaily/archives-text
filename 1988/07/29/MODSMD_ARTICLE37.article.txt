# Disabled athlete off to Seoul
## 
### Mica Martin 
With three months to go until the Sum
mer Olympic Games, Stanford computer
analyst Ken Wright is busy working out
and raising money for a little-known kind
of world class competition.
Wright recently qualified for the
Paralympics — an international competi
tion for disabled athletes. In October,
Wright, a quadriplegic, will fly to Seoul to
compete against athletes from 50 different
countries in four different swimming
events: butterfly, backstroke, freestyle and
two individual medley events.
With competiton getting underway two
weeks after the Seoul Games, the Paralym
pics uses the same facilities as the Olympic
teams and has a similar ceremonies.
Wearing a racing jersey that reads: "I'm
going to eat Seoul food," Wright said he
is proud to represent the United States in
one of the most prestigious competitions
for disabled athletes. A victim of a drunk
driving accident 16 years ago, Wright uses
a wheelchair to conduct his life — except
when he is in the pool.
When he found out last month that the
U.S. disabled team had selected him as one
of 30 members of the swim team, Wright's
reaction was "yowza, yowza, yowza!"
Currently a member of a San Jose-based
swim team called the Water Wheels, Wright
said he was especially happy to learn that

four of his workout partners also made
the team.
"We are like a double family. Not only
do we have our sports in common, but we
have our disabilities in common," he said
of the special relationship between disabled
athletes.
For Wright, training for the Paralympics
means swimming and lifting weights two
or three days a week as well as frequently
engaging in aerobic exercises.
But for the moment maintaining his
health is not Wright's only concern. Raising
the $2,000 needed to cover the game's ex
penses is also taking a healthy chunk of
energy, he said, adding that he is accepting
donations from members of the Stanford
community.
Although he was paralized in 1972,
Wright did not take up swimming until
five years ago. According to Wright, swim
ming awakened his competitive spirit and
he immediately fell in love with the sport.
"My first time in the water we had life
jackets all over me and floats on my ankles
so my feet wouldn't sink. I just loved it."
Wright said his job at Stanford also helps
to motivate him by challenging his "brain
power."
"A physical disability does not have to
interfere with performance on the job; it's
the end results that count," he said.
Aside from his brain work, Wright's ath

letic interests go beyond swimming. He has
competed in several triathalons that com
bine swimming, hand-powered bike riding
and road races, and has even experimented
with snow skiing on a toboggan.

Estimating that he has entered about 50
sports competitions since he discovered his
love for swimming, Wright said he has also
raced in a six-mile races, half-marathons
and even a marathon.
