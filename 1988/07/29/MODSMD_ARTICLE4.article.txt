# String of thefts baffles police

Audio and video equipment worth an estimated
$1,700 was stolen from the basement of the Com
munication Department over the last two weeks,
baffling staff members who speculated that the bur
glary was "an inside job."
According to Stanford Police Sgt. Tim Hanrahan,
the Communication Department was burglarized
three times from July 10 to 25. There are no
suspects and no reported signs of forced entry, he
said.
But Brent Duisenberg, a senior engineer at the
Communication Department, said there was a def
inite pattern in the crimes committed and that the
burglar probably works in the Communication De
partment.
"I'm sure that whoever took the equipment from
the audio and video rooms had a master key,"
Duisenberg said.
He added that the thief or thieves were "very
selective of what they stole. They could have taken
much more and really wiped us out, but they decided
to just take two pairs of JBL speakers, a video
monitor and a double cassette dubbing deck."
The first incident occurred between 3 p.m. on
July 10 and 8 a.m. on July 11 when over $1,000
worth of equipment was taken.
