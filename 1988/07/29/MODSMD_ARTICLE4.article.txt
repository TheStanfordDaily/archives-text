# String of thefts baffles police

### Lydee Felipe 
Audio and video equipment worth an estimated
$1,700 was stolen from the basement of the Com
munication Department over the last two weeks,
baffling staff members who speculated that the bur
glary was "an inside job."
According to Stanford Police Sgt. Tim Hanrahan,
the Communication Department was burglarized
three times from July 10 to 25. There are no
suspects and no reported signs of forced entry, he
said.
But Brent Duisenberg, a senior engineer at the
Communication Department, said there was a def
inite pattern in the crimes committed and that the
burglar probably works in the Communication De
partment.
"I'm sure that whoever took the equipment from
the audio and video rooms had a master key,"
Duisenberg said.
He added that the thief or thieves were "very
selective of what they stole. They could have taken
much more and really wiped us out, but they decided
to just take two pairs of JBL speakers, a video
monitor and a double cassette dubbing deck."
The first incident occurred between 3 p.m. on
July 10 and 8 a.m. on July 11 when over $1,000
worth of equipment was taken.
The second theft took place be
tween July 14 and 15, when a
double cassette tape deck worth
$300 was stolen.
Although the locks and keys for
the department were changed at
that time, one more theft oc
curred over the weekend of July
22 to 25. According to Duisenberg,
the department spent over $1,000
rekeying the locks in order to
prevent another burglary.
Nonetheless, police said $400
worth of equipment was taken in
the most recent theft even after
the locks were changed.
"We even employed security
guards one weekend," Duisenberg
said. "But the burglars took a
chance the following weekend, saw
there were no guards and struck
again. The last time they came in
they unbolted the JBL speakers
right off of the wall of the audio
room."
According to police, all of the
burglaries happened either late at
night or during the early morning
hours. "I remember working with
a student on the cassette deck one
evening and discovered at 8:00
a.m. the next day that the equip
ment disappeared," Duisenberg
said.
Joan Mirriam, a summer stu
dent in the department's TV pro
duction workshop, said she was
"shocked" one evening about a
week ago when she heard "keys
jingling and saw a man she didn't
recognize as a student walk right
into the audio room." She said
she followed him and saw him
exit at a back doorway.
Mirriam was questioned by the
police, but police say they do not
have any suspects at this time.
Nonetheless, Duisenberg says
he will find the thief.

"I'm determined to find out who
did it and I won't give up," said
the 6' 5", 250 lb. former high
school football player. In a similar
situation at another college on the
Peninsula two years ago, Duisen
berg said he waited in an equip

ment room that had been
burglarized until the thief came
in and then tackled him.
