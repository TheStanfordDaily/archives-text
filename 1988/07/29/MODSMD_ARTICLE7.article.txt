# USW negotiations underway
## Lawyers set groundwork for August contract talks 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
Claiming that the University is threat
ening their very existence, officials from
the United Stanford Workers union said
Stanford's initial proposals are disappoint
ing.
On Tuesday, Stanford and union nego
tiators met to lay the groundwork for talks
that will probably last through August.
The union' 9 contract with the University
expires on Aug. 31.
After studying the University's initial
proposals, union members said they could
not possibly accept what Stanford is now
offering them.
"They put a big package of takeaways
on the table," USW spokesperson Rodney
Barnett said of the proposals.
University Counsel Michael Vartain
declined to comment on the specifics of the
proposals, saying that negotiations with
the union will run more smoothly if he
talks with USW members before the press.
Vartain added that he thought it "un
fortunate" that the union discussed con
tract issues with the outside before nego
tiations begin at the table.
But according to Barnett, Stanford's pro

posal "guts job security." USW Steward
Linda Crouse pointed to one provision that
would place employees on probation for six
months and without security if they
changed jobs within the University.
Another Stanford proposal hopes to make
fees to the union optional, Crouse said.
Currently, workers who do not belong to
the union still pay fees and receive the
benefits of pay raises, rights and represen
tation in the union contract.
Crouse said fee cutbacks would be unfair
because they are necessary to keep the
union alive and well.
"Everyone who receives union benefits
and rights should pay their fair share,"
she said.
Stanford is also trying to undermine un
ion representative's ability to communicate
with employees Crouse charged, saving that
the University's proposals "threaten
worker security" and make representation
for workers "almost impossible."
The procedures for negotiating are an
other area of dispute between the USW
and Stanford. At Tuesday's meeting, the
union proposed that six specific campus
organizations attend the sessions and that
meetings should be taped. Both proposals
were rejected bv the University.
