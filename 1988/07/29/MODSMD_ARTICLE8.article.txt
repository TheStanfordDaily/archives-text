To determine how damaging
the drug "ecstasy" can be on
brain tissue, Stanford Neurol
ogy Prof. Stephen Peroutka is
currently seeking volunteers
who have used the popular
drug.

The amphetamine
like drug heightens
awareness and seems
to help promote
'bonds and a feeling
of closeness between
people . .

While recent research on
animals concluded that ecstasy
can selectively destroy nerve
endings, Peroutka hopes to de
termine whether the drug
produces the same effects in
humans.
"Five deaths have been at
tributed to this drug after
small doses," Peroutka said,
noting that doctors are still
baffled by the workings of the
drug.
According to Peroutka, the
effects of ecstasy are a "vast
unknown" and this lack of
knowledge is dangerous. "We
don't know what a safe dose
is," he said. "We do know that
it is toxic at some level, and

we want to find out what that
level is."
If Peroutka is successful in
determining ecstasy's effects,
he then hopes to find a treat
ment or a way to reverse these
effects. In the meantime, he
stressed that educating the
public on how dangerous
ecstasy might be is still a pri
mary goal.
A controversial survey con
ducted by Peroutka in May
1987 revealed that 39 percent
of those interviewed had used
ecstasy at least once. However,
a Cowell Student Health Center
survey conducted earlier con
cluded that usage ranged from
four to six percent.
According to Student Health
Services Director Paul Walters,
there has been a decline in the
use of ecstasy because now the
public is more aware of the
dangerous side-effects.
The use of the drug, also
known as MDMA, has been il
legal since 1985. Although
ecstasy is produced illegally it
is easy to make.
The amphetamine-like drug
heightens awareness and seems
to help promote "bonds and a
feeling of closeness between
people," according to Walters.
These effects led some psychot
herapists to use the drug
therapeutically.
Noting the "unpleasant"
side-effects of ecstasy, Walters
said users report feelings of
tension, anxiety and unreality.
An increase in pulse rate is
also commonly reported.
