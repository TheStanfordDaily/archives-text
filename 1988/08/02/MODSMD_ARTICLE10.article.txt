# Stanford program teaches pre-natal care to needy in East Palo Alto

### Helen Willey 
Bringing badly needed pre-natal care to East Palo
Alto residents, the Stanford Medical Center has em
barked on a program to provide affordable health
care to pregnant women.
Since May, a faculty member, a senior resident
and a third-year student from the Medical Center
have held regular clinics in obstetrics and gynecology
on Monday afternoons and Wednesday mornings at
the Drew Health Foundation in East Palo Alto.
The foundation is the only center offering localized
health services to East Palo Alto residents. Fre
quently, its clients cannot transport themselves to
Chope, the San Mateo County Hospital, nor can
they afford to pay for Stanford Hospital's medical
services.
As a "cost sensible" response to this problem, the
Director of the Foundation Charles Range described
the program as "an effort to help people in need
and that's an important thing."
According to Range, 90 percent of the center's
patients receive state subsidies to cover the cost of
their medical care.
Prior to its agreement with Stanford, the foun
dation was unable to pay for private doctors or for
malpractice insurance and had to cancel its pre-natal
care program for two and a half years. To solve
this problem, the foundation approached Stanford.
"We're a lot cheaper than the private guy," said
Kent Ueland, chair of the obstetrics and gynecology
department at the Medical Center. "We saw this as

a community in which we should do this and they
need us badly."
Range said he is pleased with the program, which
already has a clientele of 25 to 30 women who will
visit the clinic an average of 12 to 14 times before
having their baby. All babies are delivered at Stan
ford Hospital.
"Everyone benefits in this type of approach,"
Range said. "The program enhances Stanford's
teaching and provides the level of care that we
think would be appropriate for our clients."
Ueland added that Stanford is "very appreciative"
of the exposure that this program has given Stanford
in the community.
This program is not the first time the Medical
Center has extended its services to East Palo Alto.
Three years ago the Stanford Dermatology Depart
ment ended a four-year old program at the Drew
Foundation. Since the program's end the Drew
Foundation has not had any faculty to treat skin
problems.
Range says the Medical Center's Opthamology
Department also recently approached the Drew
Foundation with the hope of establishing a program
similar to the on-going pre-natal care project.
So far the obstetrics and gynecology clinics have
been a success for the Drew Foundation.
"A lot of hospitals would love to have a relation
ship like the one we have with Stanford," Range
said. "Something like this doesn't take place every
day — it's something to take notice of."
