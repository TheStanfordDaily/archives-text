# Campus sprinklers add to water waste
## 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
University sprinklers are
watering basketball courts,
roadways and parked vehicles
despite a request that Stanford
cut back on watering its
grounds by 65 percent.
In the first summer of a
drought, Stanford grounds
crews have been asked by the
San Francisco Water Depart
ment to cut water usage by 65
percent, but have only managed
to cut back 50 to 60 percent,
Supervisor of Grounds Stephen
Gale said.
Gale said the Water Depart
ment requested cutbacks "as
soon as possible" but did not
give a definite timetable. He
also said the University has
been investigating ways to
reduce its water usage, but that
they have not devised the best
system to do this.
Gale acknowledged that the
sprinkling system has many in

efficiencies but said some of the
problems are not easily solvable
with his small staff and equip
ment difficulties in monitoring
such large grounds.
One such problem was the
breakdown of a clock-rate con
troller two weeks ago in Escon
dido Village. The timer's break
down forced staff to turn on
sprinklers manually in mid
afternoon â€” at a time when
the strength of the sun
evaporates much of the water.
It took two weeks to order a
part to repair the controller,
Gale said. In the meantime,
mid-afternoon sprinkling con
tinued to waste water.
Another problem is the
heavy watering of basketball
and volleyball courts between
Stern Hall and Wilbur Hall
Although Gale said he was
not aware of the problem, he
said court watering probably
occurred because the courts
were built after the sprinkler
system was installed.
