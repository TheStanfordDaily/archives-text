AMMAN, Jordan — The
kingdom of Jordan, implementing
a decision by King Hussein to
sever its ties to the West Bank,
will cut off all funds and relin
quish all responsibilities for gov
ernment services in the Israeli
occupied territories, senior Jor
danian sources said yesterday.
The decision, disclosed one day
after Hussein announced that he
was ceding Jordan's claims to the
West Bank to the Palestine Lib
eration Organization, was ex
pected to deal a severe economic
blow to the territory's 850,000
Arab inhabitants.
It also came as a major surprise
to Amman-based diplomats, who
had expected Hussein to at least
limit Jordan's initial disengage
ment from the West Bank to
largely symbolic measures.
But Jordanian officials empha
sized that Hussein, who is said to
be deeply hurt and angered by a
wave of PLO-inspired anti-

Jordanian sentiment on the West
Bank, was determined to respond
with more than "empty gestures."
The new move, which one Jor
danian official said would be for
mally announced in a few days,
includes a decision to stop paying
salaries and stipends to all of the
more than 18,000 Arab civil ser
vants and teachers Jordan has on
its payrolls in the West Bank.
"The salaries will be ter
minated, of course, and this will
be announced sometime during
the next week," this official said.
Other measures that are ex
pected to have a significant impact
on the economy and social struc
ture of the West Bank also will
be enacted over the coming weeks,
the official indicated. He would
not disclose them, but rumors are
rife here that the government will
not renew the Jordanian pass
ports that West Bank Arabs have
been granted when they expire.
There is also intense specula

tion in diplomatic circles of an
imminent Cabinet reshuffle in
Amman, in which a number of
senior Palestinian officials are ex
pected to lose their posts.
"It will be a complete divorce
of this kingdom from the West
Bank," another official said of the
changes. "We will no longer be
responsible for any of the services
in the West Bank. The West Bank
is Palestine. The East Bank is
Jordan."
The PLO, whose leadership was
meeting in Baghdad, Iraq, when
the Jordanian decision was an
nounced, withheld immediate
comment. However, Chairman
Yasser Arafat called an emergency
meeting of his Central Council to
discuss the Jordanian action,
which is widely seen as posing a
severe challenge to the PLO at a
time when it is trying to organize
financial support for the "in
tifada," the eight-month-old Pal
estinian uprising in the West

Bank and Gaza Strip.
According to officials here,
Arafat was expected to cancel a
visit he had been planning to
make to Jordan later this week.
However, reports from the Iraqi
capital said that a senior PLO del
egation would probably be sent to
Amman within the next day or
two to confer with Jordanian of
ficials.
Renouncing his claim to the
West Bank in a televised address
Sunday night, Hussein asserted
that he was bowing to an Arab
consensus that had come to view
Jordan's close relationship to the
West Bank as "an obstacle to the
liberation of occupied Palestinian
land" and a challenge to the PLO's
authority there. Jordan, the king
contended, was merely bending to
the PLO's own "wishes" by sever
ing its "legal and administrative
links" to the West Bank.
But the almost acid sarcasm
with which Jordanian officials

have been repeating this rationale
to reporters over the past few days
belies the fact that the king has
presented the PLO with a major
challenge that it can hardly hope
to meet.
