MOSCOW — Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci accused the Soviet
Union here yesterday of continu
ing to emphasize offensive mili
tary strategies and weapons while
claiming at the same time it is
shifting to a defensive doctrine.
In a speech to officers at the
Soviet general staff academy
shortly after his arrival for a four
day visit here, Carlucci said, "We
have difficulty in reconciling a de
fensive doctrine with what we see
in Soviet force structure and
operational strategy as an empha

sis on the offensive."
Carlucci, who is the first U.S.
Secretary of Defense to visit the
Soviet Union on his own, declared
that Soviet military forces still
stress offensive battlefield
maneuvers and weaponry. He also
said that the Soviet Union's
pledge not to be the first to usf
nuclear weapons is irreconcilable
with what he called its "continu
ing emphasis" on intercontinenta
ballistic missiles, such as the pow
erful SS-18.
