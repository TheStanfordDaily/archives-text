# Anglican clergy sanctions elevation of female bishops
## 
### 
CANTERBURY, England -
Amid pleas for unity, a gathering
of the world's Anglican bishops
yesterday effectively took the con
troversial step of sanctioning the
elevation of women as bishops.
By a majority of 423-28, with
19 abstentions, the bishops voted
in favor of a resolution underscor
ing the right of the Anglican Com
munion's individual geographical
provinces to decide for themselves
on the divisive issue.
With some of the 28 provinces,
including those of the United
States and Canada, now on the
verge of consecrating their first
women bishops, the vote served
as a de facto go-ahead for such a
development.

The votes followed one
of the most emotive,
contentious debates
ever witnessed at a
Lambeth Conference.

However, the size of the
majority in favor of the resolution
reflected its emphasis on provin
cial independence rather than any
overwhelming enthusiasm for
women bishops.
Amended wording noting that
respect for a province's right to
ordain a woman bishop was in no
way "indicating acceptance of the
principle involved" also helped
swell the minority.
A second resolution that specif
ically called on the communion's
provinces to refrain from con
secrating a woman bishop in the
interest of unity was defeated, but
by a much narrower margin of
277-187.

Unlike the first vote, this res
olution was conducted by secret
ballot rather than by a show of
hands.
The votes followed one of the
most emotive, contentious debates
ever witnessed at a Lambeth Con
ference, the once-a-decade gather
ing of more than 500 bishops of
the Anglican Communion, the
world's second-largest Christian
community.
Many have expressed fears that
the issue could precipitate a split
in the communion.
"There are obviuosly differ
ences of opinion among us,"
Robert Runcie, the archbishop of
Canterbury, conceded following
the vote. "That's not new,"
Monday's vote is also likely to
complicate unity talks under way
with the Roman Catholic and Or
thodox churches.
In an attempt to diminsh the
divisive impact of the move inter
nally, the resolution called for a
commission to be appointed by
Runcie to monitor relations be
tween provinces and encourage
consultation within the Anglican
Communion.
The main resolution's elliptical
wording, coupled with the amend
ment, permitted many of the most
ardent opponents of women bis
hiops to vote for it. The tactic
appeared to be aimed at preserv
ing at least a facade of unity.
The formula was reminiscent of
that employed 10 years ago to
avoid similar divisions within the
communion on the issue of or
daining women priests.
Since 1978, more than 1,200
Anglican women priests have been
ordained in seven provinces, 1,100
of them alone in the United States
and Canada
