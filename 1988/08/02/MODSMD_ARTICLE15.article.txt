Soviet, Angolan settlement near
GENEVA — A senior Soviet official said yes
terday that "positive momentum" has emerged
toward resolution of the southern Africa conflict
and predicted a U.S.-mediated settlement "in the
nearest future."
The upbeat assessment by Deputy Foreign Min
ister Anatoli Adamischin came after two days of
consultations with Assistant Secretary of State
Chester Crocker, who has mediated the peace
talks involving Angola, Cuba and South Africa.
The fourth round in a series of negotiations
that opened last May in London was set to begin
here today, with Crocker and Adamischin having
set the superpower stage. Although officials said
a final accord is unlikely in this week's round,
the Soviet foreign minister's tone indicates Mos
cow feels chances for swift success are good.
"It is possible that a solution can be found in
the nearest future," Adamischin told a news con
ference.
Crocker made no public comment. But officials
from the four countries involved have made op
timistic assessments since the July 13 agreement
at the United Nations on a set of principles
governing Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola
and a South African grant of independence to
South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
These principles, despite an array of details to
be negotiated, were given considerable attention
because they reflect a convergence of U.S. and
Soviet views on the complex situation in southern
Africa.
Adamischin confirmed that Moscow and Wash
ington have similar approaches to solving the
Angola conflict. He placed agreement on this issue
in a broader context of an improved international
atmosphere where U.S. and Soviet rivalries are
not necessarily played out in Third World con
flicts.
"The general trend now is for settling regional
conflicts rather than stirring them up," he said,
citing the Geneva agreement on Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan as an example.
Among the most difficult issues to be resolved
is a timetable for withdrawal of the estimated
40,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola to bol
ster the Soviet-allied government in Luanda.
Cuban President Fidel Castro, apparently re

fleeting Soviet eagerness for a settlement, ex
pressed willingness in a speech last week to bring
the troops home. But the timing of their depar
ture has been tied to South Africa's relinquishing
control over Namibia and removal of its troops
from Angola, where they are helping the U.S.-
backed rebels, the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, or UNITA.
Democrats debate Contra aid
WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats met yes
terday in an effort to keep aid to the Nicaraguan
rebels from becoming an election-year issue, and
to warn Nicaragua against further attempts to
thwart a regional peace process in Central
America. nMHK~I

A dozen Democratic senators,
representing every shade of the
ideological spectrum on the Con
tra aid issue, met Monday in the
office of Senate Minority Robert
Byrd, D-W Va., but no agreement
was reached on a legislative pro
posal.
The Democrats, who will meet
again Tuesday, are working to
come up with some alternative

on the issue to head ofT a Republican-led aid
proposal that could reach the Senate floor this
week.
Byrd said the Democrats wanted to reach a
consensus on aiding the Contras and then seek
a "bipartisan agreement" with the Republicans.
But not all Democrats agreed that their party
should take the initiative on the issue.
"Maybe it isn't the moment for a Democratic
alternative," Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a leading
opponent of aid to the Contras, said as he emerged
from Monday's meeting.
The Democrats see a presidential election in
which their standard-bearer, Michael Dukakis, is
an adamant opponent of Contra aid while George
Bush, the soon-to-be anointed Republican nom
inee, strongly advocates Contra aid.
Future U.S. policy on the Contra question thus
will be decided largely by the outcome of the
presidential election.
