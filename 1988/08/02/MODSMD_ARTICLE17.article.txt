## Rethink camp safety 
### 
Drowning leaves
camp in doubt

As the family of Robert
Yuan grieves over the
loss of their only son,
it's time the staff at the
Stanford Sierra Camp do a
serious and thorough
reexamination of the camp's
safety procedures.
Whether the camp was in
fact negligent in preventing
Yuan's May drowning will
probably be left to the
courts through the suit re
cently filed by the Yuan fam
ily against the University.
However, certain undeni
able evidence should prompt
camp officials to consider
making changes now to
prevent future accidents.
For example, at least five
of the students who took
canoes out onto the cold
waters of Fallen Leaf Lake
alongside Robert, and fellow
senior Terry Bernstein, said
no one from the camp mon
itored the numbers of camp
ers who set out on the lake,
nor did anyone supervise
the students once they were
on the water.
And the same students —
who claimed to speak for
many more — said they
were not briefed by anyone
about what to do in case
their canoe tipped over in
the turbulent waters.
In light of this informa
tion, Sierra Camp Director

Chris Thomsen's recent
comment that the camp
plans to make no changes
because they "believe [they]
run a generally safe opera
tion" appears flip and in
sensitive.
In fact, the tight-lipped
conduct of camp officials in
the wake of the accident —
including the closed results
of their insurance compa
ny's private investigation —
throws a shroud of suspicion
over all operations there.
To eliminate this doubt,
camp officials should openly
examine their current oper
ations and consider making
changes, if only to put the
collective mind of the Stan
ford community to rest
about the safety of the va
cation spot.
Although, the camp has
not reported a fatal accident
in 90 years, this un
blemished record is no rea
son for complacency.
Furthermore, both Stan
ford and the Yuan family
should explore the possibil
ity of reaching an out of
court settlement in what
could become a bitter con
frontation.
In the days and weeks
after Robert's death, the
University demonstrated an
exemplary responsiveness to
the Yuan family.
Both parties should recall
this time — only a few
months ago — and come to
terms with this tragedy
today, not five years from
now.
