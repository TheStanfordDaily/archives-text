## Fight oppression all over 
### 
FOR THE past month or so
I have observed the continu
ing debate over the situa
tion in Central America as ex
pressed in several letters to The
Daily.
Clearly there is no easy solution
for a country in a state of up
heaval such as Nicaragua. And I
admire anyone who takes the time
to explore the issues, whether
that person is for or against the
Sandinista government.
But two things about these se
ries of letters have frankly made
me a little angry.
First, criticisms of one's politi
cal view should not be taken per
sonally. It seems these letter
writers, understandably, want to
have the last word. But someone
who adamantly disagrees with you
politically is not necessarily at
tacking your personality or how
you rate as a moral, upstanding
person, but rather has a different
approach to how a government
should work.
Everyone knows that too much
suffering comes out of war for us
to idealistically believe that one
side is free of blame. Whichever
side we as individuals choose to
support in Nicaragua is, in my
mind, choosing the lesser of two
evils. Whether the less threaten

ing side is the Sandinista govern
ment or the Contras is another
story.
The second opinion I have in
regards to this back and forth
debate is perhaps more important.
There is much talk about social
injustice, the atrocities of violence
and a questionable democratic
government in Nicaragua.
But what about South Africa?
If ever we should have a reason
to express outrage at oppression
of freedom, it should be at the
blatant injustice of apartheid pol
icies.
Those of us who live in the
United States have so much to
take for granted. We have the
Constitution to protect the rights
of all our people. South Africa
does not.
Nicaraguan citizens can vote in
their elections. Black South
Africans do not have this privilege
in their own native land.
The Nicaraguan government
has been compared to early Nazi
Germany, a regime that perse
cuted an ethnic group and boasted
the perpetuation of a superior
race. This does not sound like Nic
aragua. It sounds like South
Africa.
And while there may not be gas
chambers galore in South Africa,

there still should be reason for
alarm when reminded of Nazi
Germany: black people as the op
pressed group are the majority
population in South Africa, not
the minority, as .Jews were in Nazi
Germany.
Surely, those who believe in
true freedom would not and
should not tolerate the persecu
tion of innocent people in any
country. Just because South
Africa is not in immediate danger
of communism or is not on a con
tinent adjacent to ours does make
it less important to U.S. interests
than Nicaragua.
The political lines in Nicaragua
are clearly drawn. But one does
not have to be conservative or
liberal to despise the oppression
of freedom in any country. There
is nothing un-American about
wanting peace.
