# Stanford alumnus falls to his death
## Suicide was apparently the cause 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Early yesterday morning, the
body of a 1986 Stanford graduate
was found after he apparently
jumped to his death from a 15-
story building at the University
of California at San Francisco
Medical Center.
Austin Stanford's "apparent
suicide" occurred Wednesday
night between 10 p.m and mid
night when he leapt from the 14th
or 15th floor of a research build
ing, according to David Altman,
associate dean of Student Affairs
at the UCSF Medical Center.
Officials from the UCSF Police
Department could not comment
on the specifics of the case, saying
that the results of an investiga
tion would be released later this
afternoon.
Stanford earned his bachelor's
degree in biological sciences here
in 1986. He was a third-year med
ical student at UCSF.
Altman praised Stanford as a
stellar student and said "he was
sought after by all the top medical
schools."
"We were lucky to get him,"
Altman said.

There have not been any
suicides at the UCSF's medical
school in "recent memory,"
Altman said, stressing that med
ical school students do not have a
higher suicide rather than other
people their own age.
As an undergraduate here,
Stanford helped Asst. Prof, of
Gerontology and Pharmacology
Brian Hoffman with his research
work. For about six months, Stan
ford studied a rare cause of hy
pertension and researched ways

to end heart damage.
Remembering him as "cheerful
and upbeat," Hoffman said he was
shocked to hear of Stanford's
death.
"There are some high strung
students here. He was the antit
hesis of this, that's why I am
shocked," he said.

Stanford was serious about his
research but handled the stress
better than other pre-med stu
dents. He was "enthusiastic" and
was "very keen on going to med
ical school," according to Hoff
man.
He was a determined athlete as
well.
During his senior year here,
Stanford joined the Rugby team.
"He was a really good athlete, one
of the best on the second team,"
according to teammate and senior
Martin Hartigan.

Although Stanford joined the
team with little or no experience,
he picked up the game "really
quickly" and made it to all the
workouts, Hartigan said.
Even after a depressing defeat
or an especially difficult workout,
Stanford was usually cheerful and
could rouse his teammates to a
better mood.
"When everyone was hanging
their heads, he'd be around crack
ing jokes," Hartigan said.
