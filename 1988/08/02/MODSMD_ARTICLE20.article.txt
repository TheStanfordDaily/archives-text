## Drug testing is a disservice to the majority of athletes 
### 
THIS LETTER is in re
sponse to your July 22
editorial, "Continue Drug
Tests."
The theme of the editorial
was that college athletes must
be drug tested because of the
"incredible monetary incentives"
for coaches and athletes to
cheat and the "perennial scan
dals involving crooked coaches
and recruiting violations."
Such a sweeping indictment
does a great disservice to the
vast majority of honest college
coaches and athletes. Stanford,
like most schools, does not make
any money from its athletics
programs. The "incredible mon
etary incentives" apply only to a
very few athletes in very few
sports.
Most college sports, such as
women's field hockey and men's
water polo, do not lead to pro
fessional athletic careers. Even
in football, only a small fraction
of the college players will ever
make money professionally.
As to the "perennial scan
dals," they have never occurred
at Stanford nor at most univer
sities. In fact, the NCAA re
cently responded to such claims
of widespread cheating in college
sports by stating that "nothing

could be farther from the
truth." Stanford's athletic pro
gram is highly regarded as
being both successful and up
holding high standards of integ
rity and fairness.
The editorial statement that
"Stanford is naive" to believe a
drug education program without
testing can keep performance
enhancing drugs from ruining
college athletics is simply
wrong.
First, Stanford has not said it
is opposed to all drug testing; it
is opposed to random, mass
drug testing of athletes who are
not suspected of drug use.
Second, there is no good
evidence that any drugs actually
enhance performance. At most,
it appears that some football
players believe steroids can en
hance performance for certain

positions. Most drugs hurt ath
letic performance.
Finally, good drug education
programs have been proven to
work.
The Daily is being naive in
stating that drug testing win
ners is the answer. Len Bias
had been drug tested by his
university and a professional
basketball team, but that did
not prevent his tragic death
from a cocaine overdose at a
party.
Drug abuse is not just a
problem among winners or col
lege athletes, but in all of soci
ety. In fact, college athletes use
drugs less than other college
students.
The editorial concludes that
drug testing is something ath
letes must endure for the
privilege of playing, to protect
themselves and for the integrity
of their games. Attending college
is also a privilege; of course,
there are substantial "monetary
incentives" for students to do
well at college, and, as we all
know, there are also "scandals"
concerning college students
using drugs and cheating.
I wonder how many Stanford
students would feel it was their
responsibility to submit to ran

dom drug testing "to protect
themselves" and"the integrity"
of their degrees.
