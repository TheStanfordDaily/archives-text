Dukakis will have
landslide victory
Under the influence of drugs
and alcohol — or was it just
Reaganism? — I rashly pre
dicted a few months back that
Paul Siinon would win the dem
ocratic nomination for president.
My reasoning was that after
the slickness of the Reagan
years, 1988 would be a year of
anti-politics and that a funny
looking guy who spoke from the
heart would win out over the
egomaniacs, technocrats and
single-issue demagogues.
1 was about as wrong as one
can be on these things, so I
decided to get out of the letter
writing racket and nurse my
bottle for a while. But my men
tor, that great American
televangelist "I 10-ove to prop
hesy" Bob Tilton, and this
week's Democratic Convention
in Atlanta have got me so fired
up I'm speaking in tongues to
my dog.
Mike Dukakis is going to win
in November and win big. He
will crush that walking resume,
the sensitive and spineless Yalie
George Bush, so resoundingly
that even I,BJ's staggering 61.3
percent of the popular vote in
1964 is within reach.
How is this possible? How
will the Democrats manage to
reverse so completely and so
suddenly the course of a "revo
lution" that only four years ago
led to one of the largest elec
toral landslides in U.S. history?
First, for one of the rare
times since 1964, the Democra
tic Party is unified. The bitter,
sometimes violent divisions in
the Democratic Party in '68 and

'72 persuaded most voters that
the Republican and "tricky
Dick" were a better bet than a
party that verged on anarchy.
In 1980, the Kennedy insur
gency split the liberal wing of
the party; John Anderson's
quixotic and ultimately pointlesi
campaign served only to providt
an outlet for Democratic discon
tent with Jimmy Carter.
In 1984, the Mondale/Ferraro
ticket was probably the most
liberal ticket the party has run
since 1972, and alienated both
conservatives and southerners.
The cornerstone of the Duka
kis landslide will be the word si
blithely bandied about in At
lanta: "Unity." Lloyd Bentsen is
the perfect counterpart to Mi
chael Dukakis. Conservative,
patrician, southern, as white as
you can get, he will attract
precisely those voters for whom
Michael Dukakis' immigrant
roots are a source of suspicion,
not inspiration.
Jesse Jackson, as both the
convention and its immediate
fallout made clear, will fully
support Dukakis in '88, if only
to advance his own presidential
ambitions in '92. His con
stituency is composed of those
who have been directly hurt by
the Reagan Administration or
whose needs have been the mos
consistently ignored by the Re
publican party: gays, minorities,
working women, low-income
families.
In the absence of a Jackson
protest campaign, this con
stituency must, out of sheer
self-interest, vote overwhelm
ingly Democratic.
Unity alone, however, does
not add up to landslide. What
will really explain the margin ol

the Democratic victory is a
growing perception, across the
country and across all classes,
that the time is ripe for a new
direction, a new vision. Our
highways are falling apart, our
schools stink, our budgets don't
5 balance, and our government, a
; corrupt, inefficient behemoth,
doesn't care.
Further, competence will be
an issue, and a major one. A
year ago, when the Iran-Contra
affair first broke, I predicted
the whole scandal would blow
over, because, for all his flaws,
Reagan had lulled the American
3 people into a deep, pleasant
sleep, from which no one was
really ready to wake up.
Reagan's complete isolation
from reality led us to project
onto him all of our infantile
fantasies. Whether we stood tall
with the Gipper and basked in
the morning glow of our desire
for omnipotence, or threw coke
cans at the TV screen every
time Uncle Ronnie babbled
away, he allowed us to let go,
to forget about politics and to
lead our petty lives undisturbed.
Politics were unnecessary any
way, since a semi-literate joker
was running the show.
But the nation has finally
woken up, and is scratching its
t collective head, wondering if
incompetence, inefficiency, cor
ruption and dishonesty are nec
essary.
Michael Dukakis represents,
more than anything, a change
in style, a change from passive
to active, from confused to
clear-headed, from corrupt to
honest.
Finally, the Democrats will
thump the Republicans because
r George Bush can neither cloak

himself in the Reagan mantle
nor find a new tailor. Bush is
inseparable from Reagan, but
has none of the qualities that
made Uncle Ronnie so irresis
table. Anyone who could project
a fantasy onto George Bush
must have led so disturbed a
childhood that we do need bet
ter child-care.
Bush has only the Reagan
record to go on: Taxes, infla
tion, joblessness and interest
rates have come down; relations
with the Soviets have improved;
our foreign policy appears, al
though 1 fear prematurely, on
the brink of major achievements
in the Middle East and Afghani
stan. And yet, if Bush attempts
to take credit for the apparent
triumphs of the Reagan admin
istration, he must also explain
the budget deficits, the state of
our schools and highways and
the Pentagon scandals, not to
mention Ed Meese and General
Manuel Noriega.
Lee Altwater, Bush's camaign
manager, has already made the
Republican strategy clear: Paint
Dukakis as a tax and spend
liberal, and run on Reagan's
record of peace and prosperity.
Will this strategy work? It will
not. It charts no vision for the
future, points to nothing new.
It ignores all the problems, both
at borne and abroad, that a still
somewhat groggy electorate has
finally woken up to.
It does not address the issues
of competence and integrity that
surround Reagan's handling of
the budget, the military and the
Ayatollah. And finally, it pro
vides no answer to one simple
question: Why should George
Bush be elected to anything, let
alone the presidency of the

United States?
As always, Mario Cuomo,
curiously out of sight at At
lanta, put it best. The issue, he
said on CBS' Face The Nation,
is "competence, for a change."
Competence and change:
Those are the winning issues in
1988. The Democrats have their
finger on the pulse of the na
tion and no force on earth will
make them take it off.

Imij offs aren't only
path to work loss
Thank you for the coverage
of contract negotiations between
USW and the University. How
ever, we'd like to clarify an
important item.
At SLAC we have lost hun
dreds of bargaining unit jobs to
outside non-union contractors
and job shoppers. However, that
is not the same as having had
hundreds of workers "laid off."
A loss of work does not al
ways mean a direct lay off. For
example, when a union worker
is forced to leave a job due to a
disabling job injury or illness,
his/her work may be contracted
out and cause a job loss within
the bargaining unit.
This example along with job
lay offs and numerous other
contracting-out schemes have
resulted in hundreds of jobs lost
within the Technical, Mainte
nance and Service Unit at
SLAC.
We hope this clears up any
confusion.

Dukakis will have
landslide victory
Under the influence of drugs
and alcohol — or was it just
Reaganism? — I rashly pre
dicted a few months back that
Paul Siinon would win the dem
ocratic nomination for president.
My reasoning was that after
the slickness of the Reagan
years, 1988 would be a year of
anti-politics and that a funny
looking guy who spoke from the
heart would win out over the
egomaniacs, technocrats and
single-issue demagogues.
1 was about as wrong as one
can be on these things, so I
decided to get out of the letter
writing racket and nurse my
bottle for a while. But my men
tor, that great American
televangelist "I 10-ove to prop
hesy" Bob Tilton, and this
week's Democratic Convention
in Atlanta have got me so fired
up I'm speaking in tongues to
my dog.
Mike Dukakis is going to win
in November and win big. He
will crush that walking resume,
the sensitive and spineless Yalie
George Bush, so resoundingly
that even I,BJ's staggering 61.3
percent of the popular vote in
1964 is within reach.
How is this possible? How
will the Democrats manage to
reverse so completely and so
suddenly the course of a "revo
lution" that only four years ago
led to one of the largest elec
toral landslides in U.S. history?
First, for one of the rare
times since 1964, the Democra
tic Party is unified. The bitter,
sometimes violent divisions in
the Democratic Party in '68 and

'72 persuaded most voters that
the Republican and "tricky
Dick" were a better bet than a
party that verged on anarchy.
In 1980, the Kennedy insur
gency split the liberal wing of
the party; John Anderson's
quixotic and ultimately pointlesi
campaign served only to providt
an outlet for Democratic discon
tent with Jimmy Carter.
In 1984, the Mondale/Ferraro
ticket was probably the most
liberal ticket the party has run
since 1972, and alienated both
conservatives and southerners.
The cornerstone of the Duka
kis landslide will be the word si
blithely bandied about in At
lanta: "Unity." Lloyd Bentsen is
the perfect counterpart to Mi
chael Dukakis. Conservative,
patrician, southern, as white as
you can get, he will attract
precisely those voters for whom
Michael Dukakis' immigrant
roots are a source of suspicion,
not inspiration.
Jesse Jackson, as both the
convention and its immediate
fallout made clear, will fully
support Dukakis in '88, if only
to advance his own presidential
ambitions in '92. His con
stituency is composed of those
who have been directly hurt by
the Reagan Administration or
whose needs have been the mos
consistently ignored by the Re
publican party: gays, minorities,
working women, low-income
families.
In the absence of a Jackson
protest campaign, this con
stituency must, out of sheer
self-interest, vote overwhelm
ingly Democratic.
Unity alone, however, does
not add up to landslide. What
will really explain the margin ol

the Democratic victory is a
growing perception, across the
country and across all classes,
that the time is ripe for a new
direction, a new vision. Our
highways are falling apart, our
schools stink, our budgets don't
5 balance, and our government, a
; corrupt, inefficient behemoth,
doesn't care.
Further, competence will be
an issue, and a major one. A
year ago, when the Iran-Contra
affair first broke, I predicted
the whole scandal would blow
over, because, for all his flaws,
Reagan had lulled the American
3 people into a deep, pleasant
sleep, from which no one was
really ready to wake up.
Reagan's complete isolation
from reality led us to project
onto him all of our infantile
fantasies. Whether we stood tall
with the Gipper and basked in
the morning glow of our desire
for omnipotence, or threw coke
cans at the TV screen every
time Uncle Ronnie babbled
away, he allowed us to let go,
to forget about politics and to
lead our petty lives undisturbed.
Politics were unnecessary any
way, since a semi-literate joker
was running the show.
But the nation has finally
woken up, and is scratching its
t collective head, wondering if
incompetence, inefficiency, cor
ruption and dishonesty are nec
essary.
Michael Dukakis represents,
more than anything, a change
in style, a change from passive
to active, from confused to
clear-headed, from corrupt to
honest.
Finally, the Democrats will
thump the Republicans because
r George Bush can neither cloak

himself in the Reagan mantle
nor find a new tailor. Bush is
inseparable from Reagan, but
has none of the qualities that
made Uncle Ronnie so irresis
table. Anyone who could project
a fantasy onto George Bush
must have led so disturbed a
childhood that we do need bet
ter child-care.
Bush has only the Reagan
record to go on: Taxes, infla
tion, joblessness and interest
rates have come down; relations
with the Soviets have improved;
our foreign policy appears, al
though 1 fear prematurely, on
the brink of major achievements
in the Middle East and Afghani
stan. And yet, if Bush attempts
to take credit for the apparent
triumphs of the Reagan admin
istration, he must also explain
the budget deficits, the state of
our schools and highways and
the Pentagon scandals, not to
mention Ed Meese and General
Manuel Noriega.
Lee Altwater, Bush's camaign
manager, has already made the
Republican strategy clear: Paint
Dukakis as a tax and spend
liberal, and run on Reagan's
record of peace and prosperity.
Will this strategy work? It will
not. It charts no vision for the
future, points to nothing new.
It ignores all the problems, both
at borne and abroad, that a still
somewhat groggy electorate has
finally woken up to.
It does not address the issues
of competence and integrity that
surround Reagan's handling of
the budget, the military and the
Ayatollah. And finally, it pro
vides no answer to one simple
question: Why should George
Bush be elected to anything, let
alone the presidency of the

United States?
As always, Mario Cuomo,
curiously out of sight at At
lanta, put it best. The issue, he
said on CBS' Face The Nation,
is "competence, for a change."
Competence and change:
Those are the winning issues in
1988. The Democrats have their
finger on the pulse of the na
tion and no force on earth will
make them take it off.

Imij offs aren't only
path to work loss
Thank you for the coverage
of contract negotiations between
USW and the University. How
ever, we'd like to clarify an
important item.
At SLAC we have lost hun
dreds of bargaining unit jobs to
outside non-union contractors
and job shoppers. However, that
is not the same as having had
hundreds of workers "laid off."
A loss of work does not al
ways mean a direct lay off. For
example, when a union worker
is forced to leave a job due to a
disabling job injury or illness,
his/her work may be contracted
out and cause a job loss within
the bargaining unit.
This example along with job
lay offs and numerous other
contracting-out schemes have
resulted in hundreds of jobs lost
within the Technical, Mainte
nance and Service Unit at
SLAC.
We hope this clears up any
confusion.
