## Stanford filmmaker chronicles life in Cambodia 
### Todd Pierce Editorial staff 
Ellen Bruno is editing film in
her office in the basement of the
Communication Department and
talking about Cambodia. But
she's not just talking about the
embattled Southeast Asian coun
try — she's making a film about
it.
A graduate student in the de
partment's film program, Bruno
is in the middle of a herculean
task: condensing 16 hours of film
into a coherent, hour-long docu
mentary. Presently titled "Return
to Cambodia," the film will focus
on the lives of ordinary citizens,
she said.
"My purpose in making the film
was not political. 1 wanted to put
the politics aside for a minute. I
wanted to talk to the people on
the street. This was difficult be
cause there was no understanding
(in the government) of the value
of the common man's experience,"
she explained.
Bruno said she wanted to con
centrate on life in Cambodia
today, rather than on the
atrocities of the Khmer Rouge be
tween 1972 and 1977. "There
hasn't been a film not focusing
on the Khmer Rouge. . . . We ha
ven't seen a film on people today,
on what's going on. I want to tell

'There was no under
standing (in the Cam
bodian government) of
the value of the com
mon man's experi
ence.'

people what the Cambodians are
going through today."
In fact, getting permission to
make a documentary inside a
country closed to most visitors re
quired the work of contacts in
relief organizations and a flair for
the unexpected. In the end, Bruno
said making such a film proved

more difficult than she ever imag
ined.
"I was waiting in Bangkok with
the film crew and I got a three
week visa, much to my surprise.
I got word from Phnom Penh (the
capital of Cambodia) four days
before I had to go."
Once there, Bruno spent 18
hours a day filming and bargain
ing with officials. "From six a.m.
to nine p.m. we were filming, and
from nine p.m. to midnight I was
pumping people for information,"
she said.
Bruno said making the film she
had planned proved impossible. "I
had wanted to focus on the ex
tended family. 1 wanted to look at
all the aspects of life (through the
family) but it's illegal for the
Khmer to have foreigners in their
houses."
Instead, Bruno found herself
under constant supervision.
Drivers shuttled her back and
forth between interviews with
government officials and relief
projects approved for the Western
media.
"We were under constant su
pervision. Our rooms were
bugged.. .. We had one govern
ment guide and always had some
one trailing us to the point that
we didn't know who we could
trust," she said.
"We were trying to get the scoop
from the relief people, but then
we wondered about them. The
number of people you can trust
narrows down, even in the short
space of three weeks. It's an al
most impossible situation to make
a film in."
At government functions and
visits "we'd have to pretend we
were rolling," Bruno said. But, in
the final product "there's not one
scene in the movie that they (the
government) planned."
"All of the film is outside, stolen
moments — that's what I feel like
calling the film."
Despite the disheartening bu
reaucratic fetters, Bruno said the
film reveals a Cambodia rarely
seen. Since the government
thought she was making a film

for a relief organization, she re
ceived permission to visit hospi
tals and outlying areas that are
usually off limits.
Another advantage was the
three week visa, which gave the
crew time to visit the provinces.
Bruno said the Cambodian regime
almost always restricts journalists
to a single week inside the coun
try.
Because the government is
centralized in Phnom Penh,
reporters rarely have time to
cover political developments and
visit the provinces, where the
famine and ravages of war are
most visible, she said.
Bruno visited hospitals outside
the captial and was permitted to
film amputees because of her sup
posed association with a relief or
ganization. She described a gov
ernment sanctioned visit to a
provincial hospital, where the
crew had seen the maternity
ward:

"In one wing of the hospital,
all these people were packed to
gether. My curiosity was piqued.
There was one doctor at this
hospital and he wasn't even a doc
tor — he was a nurse."
After cajoling the Cambodian
"doctor," they were allowed to see
the crowded wing. Inside they
heard people howling from pain
because there was no medicine in
the hospital.
"The people were from a train
ful of people that was hit by a
mine. This happens two or three
times a week. ... We heard people
with no painkillers, old people,
kids. ... it was horrible."
In a part of the country stricken
by famine, Bruno saw farmers
planting rice seeds in a dry paddy.
"If they planted, at least they were
doing something, and that's bet
ter than inactivity."
Bruno shook her head and said
"It just never stops for these
people."

The recent history of Cambodia
is certainly bleak. During the
Vietnam War, the independence
and unpredictability of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk prompted a
coup d'etat by the U.S. backed
Lon Nol.
Lon Nol was in turn overthrown
by the Khmer Rouge, rabid gueril
las who practiced genocide against
their own people. In 1977, Viet
nam invaded the country, osten
sibly to rid Cambodia of the
Khmer Rouge.
However, recent diplomatic
developments suggest that Cam
bodia may have a brighter future.
Bruno said the heroism in the
lives of the ordinary people was
inspiring.
"People are making an effort
to enjoy themselves — life goes
on, despite everything."
Bruno said the movie will prob
ably be shown here on campus
and in San Francisco in Novem
ber.
