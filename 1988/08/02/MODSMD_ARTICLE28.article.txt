# Program helps train teachers of tomorrow

A paper airplane glides above
60 heads and grazes the teacher's
ear. Scott Bowers wheels around
from the blackboard and finds a
hand raised to ask a question.
"Is this going to be on the test,
Mr. Bowers?"
But this scene isn't pulled from
a rerun of "Welcome Back, Kot
ter" or a Hollywood teen movie.
Bowers, the assistant director of
the Stanford Teacher Education
Program, is playing the role of
the persecuted teacher before a
group of Stanford graduate stu
dents.

"The students had a lot of fun
pretending to be high school kids.
Of course, they were much more
daring than actual high school
ers," he said.
The mock classroom session is
one of several STEP activities de
signed to acquaint participants
with the classroom environment.
A year-long masters program in
the school of education, STEP
begins with an intensive summer
quarter of academic classes and
teaching internships. At the end
of a year, the student teachers
have a California Single Subject
Credential and a Master of Arts
in Education.

But STEP Director Grace Grant
said she doesn't see it as a degree
program. "What we're trying to
do is develop reflective teachers.
Part of that is helping students
to be conscious of their own
values. .. . We expose them to di
verse views about the education
process and provide them with
the tools for making and imple
menting their own educational
choices.
"We see teachers as agents of
change. So teachers need to be
experimental. They need to be
open to new ideas and yet wise
in their decision-making with re

spect to these new ideas," she
said.
To live up to this educational
legacy, STEP makes sure students
have a grasp of subject content
and are familiar with different
teaching methods, according to
Grant.
When students begin the pro
gram, they choose a subject area
and begin studying how to teach
that particular topic. The aca
demic areas are English, social
studies, math, science and foreign
languages.
In addition to course work, stu
dents get on the job practice teach
ing for the year in a local high
school. Each student teacher has
a supervisor at Stanford —
usually an experienced teacher
seeking a doctorate in education
— who oversees their progress
and gives advice about classroom
techniques.
"To develop reflectivity (in the
students), we analyze and discuss
their own teaching. Each student
has a supervisor who visits the
class they teach. The supervisor
meets with the student before the
lesson is taught and then after
there's a supervision cycle to iden
tify if there are any areas the
students need help in."
And to these diverse teaching
methods, oach student brings very
different reasons for choosing to
study teaching with the STEP
program.
Eor example, Randy Thomas, a
political science major, said he
hopes to teach world studies or
U.S. government to high school
students. Thomas, one of the 19
Stanford graduates enrolled in
this year's program, is attending
STEP on a Mellon fellowship,
which pays for the fifth year.
Tom Regan, a physics major
from Yale, said he picked STEP

'We see teachers as
agents of change. So
teachers need to be
experimental.'

because he wanted to teach in Cal
ifornia.
"There are not many teacher
education programs in California
which cover areas in science and
STEP seemed like a good pro
gram," he said, adding that he
plans to teach high school physics
or math.
Nora Krevans taught high
school for six months in San Fran
cisco after graduating from Wil
liams College three years ago.
Krevans said she hopes to teach
English after graduating from the
program and "looks forward to
exploring literature with adoles
cents."
Yin Ling Leung graduated from
Oberlin College in 1987 and has
had an unusually varied teaching
experience, from substituting at
night school to teaching at a state
prison. She described teaching as
a "wonderful vehicle for carrying
out social justice."
She praised the "sound educa
tional philosophies behind STEP,
such as teaching the value of di
versity and absolute respect for
one's students."
And Leung said she only has
one complaint: "I wish that the
professors would apply the results
of their research to the STEP
courses. Students cannot sit
through classes that are two hours
long!"
