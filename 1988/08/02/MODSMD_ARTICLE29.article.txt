## Witmeyer signs pro contract, will skip senior year 
### 
Ron Witmeyer, one of the key
cogs in the Big Cardinal Machine,
has elected to skip his senior year
of college and sign a contract with
the Oakland Athletics, it was an
nounced Friday.
Witmeyer was selected in the
seventh round of the June base
ball draft this year. The first
baseman batted .290 with 11
home runs and 64 runs batted in
during the past season.
Witmeyer, 21, was a team
leader and run producer on Stan
ford's 1987 and 1988 College
World Series champion teams. He
batted .400 in the 1988 CWS.
Though his batting average was
less than spectacular, Witmeyer
never had trouble driving in runs
in the clutch. During the 1987
season he had more RBI than base
hits for a stretch.
Witmeyer has good power,
above-average speed and an excel
lent glove. Given that combination
of skills he has to be considered

a legitimate prospect to make the
major leagues someday.
He said he would finish up with
summer school here and then head
to the Fall Instructional League.
There is no word on what level
of the minors Witmeyer will play
at next spring.
Possible replacements for Wit
meyer at first include Brian
Johnson, the starting left fielder
as well as the starting quarter
back on the football team, and
incoming freshamn David
McCarty of Houston, a highly re
garded recruit.

Eleven former Stanford players
are plugging away in the minors
trying to achieve their dream of
making the bigs.
At the AAA level, Billy Beane
is batting .228 with seven home
runs and 30 runs batted in for
the Detroit Tigers' affiliate in
Toledo.

Dave Meier, with the Chicago
Cubs' lowa team, has been hot
lately. Meier had three hits
Thursday to lead lowa to a 9-8
win over Oklahoma City. He then
hit a three-run homer as lowa
beat Denver 6-4 Saturday.
For the season, Meier is batting
.284 with seven homers and 45
RBI.
Mark Davis earned a midseason
promotion from the Chicago
White Sox AA club to their Van
couver AAA club. He is struggling
with a .217 average, four homers
and 19 RBI.
If Davis makes the miyors he
will join former Stanford team
mate Jack McDowell there.
McDowell was a preseason favor
ite for American League Rookie
of the Year but had problems
early on.
Lately, though, McDowell has
been coming on strong. Despite a
4-8 record, he has only allowed
109 hits in 119 innings of work
and has a solid 3.86 ERA. Oddly
enough, Melido Perez, also of the
Sox has emerged as a contender
for top rookie honors despite re
cording slightly inferior stats to
McDowell's.
The difference? Perez is 10-5.
At the AA level the news is less
encouraging. Eric Hardgrave and
Rick Lundblade both recently
joined their respective teams and
both are off to slow starts.
Hardgrave has only three hits
and one run batted in after 14 at
bats with the Tigers' Glen Falls
team. That gives him a .214 bat
ting average.
Lundblade is batting just .207
after 82 at bats with the New
York Mets' Jackson affiliate. He
has only two homers and seven
RBI.
The Class A level finds three
postion players and two pitchers
including 1987 CWS heroes
Ruben Amaro, A 1 Osuna and Rob
Wassenaar.
Amaro is with the California
Angels' Palm Springs team. He is
batting .268 with three homers
and 37 RBI.
Osuna is with the Houston
Astros organization and is playing
for Asheville. He has compiled a
4-1 record in relief with 25 strike
outs in 29 innings of work. Osuna
has a 2.76 ERA
Wassenaar was pitching bril
liantly for the Quad City affiliate
of the Angels until he had a rocky
stretch recently that bumped his
ERA up to 2.88, still an excellent
stat.
Working as a short reliever,
Wassenaar has struck out 43 in
40 innings of work while walking
only nine.
Walt Harris is with the Bal

timore Orioles' Hagerstown team.
He's hitting .256 with one homer
and 44 RBI.
John Ramos is catching for the
New York Yankees' Prince
William affiliate. He is batting a
solid .298 with four homers and
43 RBI.
Dave Reis, who saw little action
in his Stanford career, is trying
to make it with the Atlanta
Braves. Reis got off to a rocky
beginning in the Appalachian
Rookie League but has been get
ting stronger of late.
Overall, Reis is 1-3 with a 5.14
EP-/\. In 42 innings he has 24
strikeouts.
Agassi ousts Goldie
in Volvo semifinals
Andre Agassi, the 18-year-old
tennis sensation, eliminated 1986
Stanford graduate Dan Goldie
from the Volvo International Ten
nis Tournament at Stratton
Mountain, Vt. Saturday.
Agassi is the tournament's No.
2 seed and the fifth-ranked player
in the world. He used his powerful
forehand and a devestating
looping topspin shot to knock off
the 12th-seeded Goldie, 6-3, 6-3.
Goldie is ranked 42nd in the world
according to the Association of
Tennis Professionals' computer.
In the final, Agassi beat Amer
ican Paul Annacone in straight
sets 6-2, 6-4. It was Agassi's fifth
tournament victory this year and

gave him $515,000 in total earn
ings.
Against Goldie, Agassi played
through 104-degree heat to reach
his first final of the tournament
that made him famous two years
ago. It was at the Volvo in 1986
where Agassi lost to John
McEnroe in the quarterfinals.
Last year, he lost to Ivan Lendl
in the semis.
Goldie, the 1986 NCAA singles
champion, was no match for
Agassi in the first set. In the sec
ond set, however, he came alive
and broke Agassi in the second
and fourth games.
But Agassi then displayed the
form that allowed him to make
his meteoric rise to the top ech
elon of professional tennis. He
won the last five games, breaking
Goldie's serve in the ninth and
final game with a powerful shot
off Goldie's racket at the net.
"I thought in the second set
he'd beat me. I don't know if he
was a little intimidated by my
serve because I actually broke him
only once in the first set," Agassi
said.
But Goldie, who relies on a big
serve, said he had trouble serving.
"I couldn't get my first serve
in. I don't know what my per
centage was but it had to be real
low," Goldie said. "When you're
not serving well, you're in big
trouble."
Especially against Andre Agas
si.

lent glove. Given that combination
of skills he has to be considered

a legitimate prospect to make the
major leagues someday.
He said he would finish up with
summer school here and then head
to the Fall Instructional League.
There is no word on what level
of the minors Witmeyer will play
at next spring.
Possible replacements for Wit
meyer at first include Brian
Johnson, the starting left fielder
as well as the starting quarter
back on the football team, and
incoming freshamn David
McCarty of Houston, a highly re
garded recruit.

Eleven former Stanford players
are plugging away in the minors
trying to achieve their dream of
making the bigs.
At the AAA level, Billy Beane
is batting .228 with seven home
runs and 30 runs batted in for
the Detroit Tigers' affiliate in
Toledo.

Dave Meier, with the Chicago
Cubs' lowa team, has been hot
lately. Meier had three hits
Thursday to lead lowa to a 9-8
win over Oklahoma City. He then
hit a three-run homer as lowa
beat Denver 6-4 Saturday.
For the season, Meier is batting
.284 with seven homers and 45
RBI.
Mark Davis earned a midseason
promotion from the Chicago
White Sox AA club to their Van
couver AAA club. He is struggling
with a .217 average, four homers
and 19 RBI.
If Davis makes the miyors he
will join former Stanford team
mate Jack McDowell there.
McDowell was a preseason favor
ite for American League Rookie
of the Year but had problems
early on.
Lately, though, McDowell has
been coming on strong. Despite a
4-8 record, he has only allowed
109 hits in 119 innings of work
and has a solid 3.86 ERA. Oddly
enough, Melido Perez, also of the
Sox has emerged as a contender
for top rookie honors despite re
cording slightly inferior stats to
McDowell's.
The difference? Perez is 10-5.
At the AA level the news is less
encouraging. Eric Hardgrave and
Rick Lundblade both recently
joined their respective teams and
both are off to slow starts.
Hardgrave has only three hits
and one run batted in after 14 at
bats with the Tigers' Glen Falls
team. That gives him a .214 bat
ting average.
Lundblade is batting just .207
after 82 at bats with the New
York Mets' Jackson affiliate. He
has only two homers and seven
RBI.
The Class A level finds three
postion players and two pitchers
including 1987 CWS heroes
Ruben Amaro, A 1 Osuna and Rob
Wassenaar.
Amaro is with the California
Angels' Palm Springs team. He is
batting .268 with three homers
and 37 RBI.
Osuna is with the Houston
Astros organization and is playing
for Asheville. He has compiled a
4-1 record in relief with 25 strike
outs in 29 innings of work. Osuna
has a 2.76 ERA
Wassenaar was pitching bril
liantly for the Quad City affiliate
of the Angels until he had a rocky
stretch recently that bumped his
ERA up to 2.88, still an excellent
stat.
Working as a short reliever,
Wassenaar has struck out 43 in
40 innings of work while walking
only nine.
Walt Harris is with the Bal

timore Orioles' Hagerstown team.
He's hitting .256 with one homer
and 44 RBI.
John Ramos is catching for the
New York Yankees' Prince
William affiliate. He is batting a
solid .298 with four homers and
43 RBI.
Dave Reis, who saw little action
in his Stanford career, is trying
to make it with the Atlanta
Braves. Reis got off to a rocky
beginning in the Appalachian
Rookie League but has been get
ting stronger of late.
Overall, Reis is 1-3 with a 5.14
EP-/\. In 42 innings he has 24
strikeouts.
Agassi ousts Goldie
in Volvo semifinals
Andre Agassi, the 18-year-old
tennis sensation, eliminated 1986
Stanford graduate Dan Goldie
from the Volvo International Ten
nis Tournament at Stratton
Mountain, Vt. Saturday.
Agassi is the tournament's No.
2 seed and the fifth-ranked player
in the world. He used his powerful
forehand and a devestating
looping topspin shot to knock off
the 12th-seeded Goldie, 6-3, 6-3.
Goldie is ranked 42nd in the world
according to the Association of
Tennis Professionals' computer.
In the final, Agassi beat Amer
ican Paul Annacone in straight
sets 6-2, 6-4. It was Agassi's fifth
tournament victory this year and

gave him $515,000 in total earn
ings.
Against Goldie, Agassi played
through 104-degree heat to reach
his first final of the tournament
that made him famous two years
ago. It was at the Volvo in 1986
where Agassi lost to John
McEnroe in the quarterfinals.
Last year, he lost to Ivan Lendl
in the semis.
Goldie, the 1986 NCAA singles
champion, was no match for
Agassi in the first set. In the sec
ond set, however, he came alive
and broke Agassi in the second
and fourth games.
But Agassi then displayed the
form that allowed him to make
his meteoric rise to the top ech
elon of professional tennis. He
won the last five games, breaking
Goldie's serve in the ninth and
final game with a powerful shot
off Goldie's racket at the net.
"I thought in the second set
he'd beat me. I don't know if he
was a little intimidated by my
serve because I actually broke him
only once in the first set," Agassi
said.
But Goldie, who relies on a big
serve, said he had trouble serving.
"I couldn't get my first serve
in. I don't know what my per
centage was but it had to be real
low," Goldie said. "When you're
not serving well, you're in big
trouble."
Especially against Andre Agas
si.
