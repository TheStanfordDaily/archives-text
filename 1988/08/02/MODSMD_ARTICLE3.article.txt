Mechanical failure probably did
not cause the July 19 plane crash
that killed 1988 Stanford gradu
ate Edward "Buster" Nicholson,
an investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board in
Los Angeles said yesterday.
Don Lorente, an NTSB air
safety investigator, said there was
"no evidence for any pre-existing
aircraft or engine malfunctions"

that would have caused Nicholson
to crash into a Portola Valley
swimming pool during a routine
two-hour flight in the early eve
ning July 19.
Lorente's investigation con
sisted primarily of inspecting the
wreckage of the plane and con
ducting interviews.
Nicholson was an experienced
pilot who had just been accepted
into flight training by the U.S.
