# Engine trouble not cause of fatal crash
## 
### Eric Richardson Editorial staff 
Mechanical failure probably did
not cause the July 19 plane crash
that killed 1988 Stanford gradu
ate Edward "Buster" Nicholson,
an investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board in
Los Angeles said yesterday.
Don Lorente, an NTSB air
safety investigator, said there was
"no evidence for any pre-existing
aircraft or engine malfunctions"

that would have caused Nicholson
to crash into a Portola Valley
swimming pool during a routine
two-hour flight in the early eve
ning July 19.
Lorente's investigation con
sisted primarily of inspecting the
wreckage of the plane and con
ducting interviews.
Nicholson was an experienced
pilot who had just been accepted
into flight training by the U.S.
Navy. He graduated from Stan
ford in June with a master's
degree in international policy
studies.
Lorente's findings disputed ear
lier reports that Nicholson's twin
engine Beechcraft Duchess
airplane had a faulty engine. It
also contradicted statements that
Nicholson was attempting a dan
gerous maneuver just before his
crash.
Lorente did confirm that Nic
holson and the aircraft's owner
examined the airplane's left en
gine at Palo Alto Municipal Air
port just prior to Nicholson's 7
p.m. takeoff. But Lorente said he
doubted that the examination was
related to the crash.
"They were checking to make
sure that the baffling was cor
rect," he said. Baffling is a part
of the engine which directs the
air flow for better engine cooling.
While he said "pre-existing"
mechanical error probably did not
cause the crash, Lorente noted

that mechanical problems could
have occurred after take-off.
Human error is a factor in 99
percent of all airplane crashes, he
said.
In addition, investigators
seemed to disagree with witnesses
who suggested that Nicholson was
attempting a trick maneuver just
before his crash.
Witnesses had said Nicholson
circled over his summer residence
and signaled to the owner of the
home, Margaret Griner, moments
before his plane crashed. They de
scribed Nicholson's signaling ma
neuver as "similar to a hammer
head stall," Lorente said.
A hammerhead stall occurs
when an airplane is flying straight
up and runs out of inertia, gen
erally causing the aircraft to turn
and then head directly toward the
ground, said T.R. Proven of the
Federal Aviation Administration
in San Jose. The plane is supposed
to pull out of the plunge seconds
before coming to earth.
Both Lorente and Proven noted
that the accuracy of the witnesses'
testimony "is somewhat in
doubt." Lorente said Nicholson's
signaling "was not a problematic
maneuver."
