## Patti Smith's return is a dream

Patti Smith
"Dream of Life"
Motherhood and an eight year hiatus
have certainly effected the woman
known as the priestess of punk. A cult
favorite in the '70s as influential as Lou
Reed's Velvet Underground, Patti
Smith has re-emerged in the late '80s
with a more mellow and marketable,
but just as meaningful, style that has
earned her new fans without alienating
her loyal ones.
"Dream of Life," her first album in
almost a decade, is the vehicle that has
made this possible. The record, an artful
blend of uptempo tunes and acoustic
beauties penned by Smith and her hus
band (and producer) Fred Sonic Smith,
radiates more inspiration and intelli

gence than just about every other
release this year.
The album starts out strongly with
the smash single "People Have The
Power," a typical Smith social statement
set to song. Here, she explores with
poetic verve the notion that people, not
the government bureaucracy, hold the
actual instruments of change:
And my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry
that the people / have the power
to redeem / the work of fools
upon the meek / the graces shower
its decreed / the people rule
A most interesting concept sung to an
energetic melody makes the single a
real winner.
A much mellower but just as emotion
laden song follow, "Going Under."
Employing a skillful mix of subdued
electric guitar and piano lines plus
sweetly-textured, soft-backing vocals,

the pastoral piece provides a nice breath
of fresh air after the hyperenergetic
"People."
"Paths That Cross," the song that
concludes the first side, is another gor
geous acoustic ballad, written in
memory of a friend. Again, Smith com
bines her evocative lyrics with an ex
tremely pleasant melody to create an
awestriking memorial. Stated simply,
this may well be the most beautiful
song of the year.
Highlighting the second side are the
records two last numbers, "Looking For
You (I Was)" and"The Jackson Song."
Just like the opening tracks, these two
provide an excellent one-two punch by
juxtaposing an all-out uptempo tune
with a quiet reflection.
Clearly, eight years has made a dif
ference in Smith's music, and "Dream"
seems all the better for it.
