A 1 B. Sure!
"In Effect Mode"
A 1 B. Sure! may have claimed the
most self-confident stage name of the
year, perhaps of the decade. If anyone
has ever set himself up to be the Michael
Spinks of the music industry, Sure is
the one — with such a billing, anything
but a swift series of hits could leave
him flat on his back.
Far from falling in the first round,
however, Sure has proven himself a
strong contender for the crown of coolest
crooner: Even a quick listening of his

spicy debut album "In Effect Mode"
reveals an exciting artist rightly deserv
ing of acclaim. Though perhaps not
worthy of the Sony Innovators Award
(a possibly prestigious honor) he has
apparently been awarded, Sure has
proven himself to be one of the top
popsters of the year as well as one of
the music industry's fastest rising new
stars.
In a nutshell, "Mode" is a mellow,
melodic menagerie of modern music.
Performed, produced and almost totally
written by Sure and collaborator Kyle
West, the record is a fresh and relaxing
departure from the frenetic pounding
that drives most R&B today — the req
uisite synthsizers and drum machines

dominate here, too, but slick lead vocals
and smooth harmonies make each song
refreshingly melifluous and enjoyable.
"Nite and Day,"the first single, is a
case in point. Boosted to the status of
a smash sensation by the extensive
airplay it has received, the tune keeps
fingers snapping and bodies moving
while wooing the listener as if it were
a ballad. The effect is unusual and in
fectious.
This feeling continues into "Oooh
This Love Is So," a beautifully simple
and sparse ballad that insists on main
taining a firm rhythmic presence with

sharp vocal counterpoint and a
nifty snap-track. With lines like
"I'll take all the time I need for
you to B. Sure! of my love," the
tune radiates the confidence that
Sure has made his calling card
but somehow works well within
the subdued melodic arrange
ments.
The album hits its peak at the
third song, a fabulous remake of

Roberta Flack's classic "Killing
Me Softly." Just as gorgeous as
the original but clearly containing
his personal stamp, Sure's version
showcases his versatile voice and
tremendous interpretive talent.
"Off On Your Own (Girl)" is
yet another meritorious effort,
picking the tempo up a notch with
exciting results.
All in all, "Mode" is a tight
eight-song package that is as in
ventive as it is popular. If R&B
seems to be stale and stagnant,
this record will B. Sure to change
your mind.
