# Bros' dance beat bores dreadfully

Bros
"Push"
"When Will 1 Be Famous?" Matt Goss asks
at the start of Bros' debut album. The promo
tion folks say "the time is now;" but, based
on the material in "Push," never would be a
much better answer.
For those uninitiated on the British teeny
pop scene or who don't have a full-color in
formation package in front of them, Bros is
a trio composed of twin brothers Matt and
Luke Goss and chum Craig Logan, each 19
years old. The group has already reached the
Top 5 in the United Kingdom twice, and ap
pears to be the hottest pretty-boy band of the
year.
All well and good, but none of the hooplah
makes the album any better. Sadly, "Push"
is an uninteresting collection of hackneyed
dance beats layered with unimaginative in
strumentation and trite lyrics.
Matt's vocal style is pleasant enough, greatly
reminiscent of Michael Jackson in his youth.
His helium-high voice is exceptionally smooth
and possesses a remarkable range of tone and
texture, allowing him the luxury of expression
