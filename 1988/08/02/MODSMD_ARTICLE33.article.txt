# Bros' dance beat bores dreadfully

Bros
"Push"
"When Will 1 Be Famous?" Matt Goss asks
at the start of Bros' debut album. The promo
tion folks say "the time is now;" but, based
on the material in "Push," never would be a
much better answer.
For those uninitiated on the British teeny
pop scene or who don't have a full-color in
formation package in front of them, Bros is
a trio composed of twin brothers Matt and
Luke Goss and chum Craig Logan, each 19
years old. The group has already reached the
Top 5 in the United Kingdom twice, and ap
pears to be the hottest pretty-boy band of the
year.
All well and good, but none of the hooplah
makes the album any better. Sadly, "Push"
is an uninteresting collection of hackneyed
dance beats layered with unimaginative in
strumentation and trite lyrics.
Matt's vocal style is pleasant enough, greatly
reminiscent of Michael Jackson in his youth.
His helium-high voice is exceptionally smooth
and possesses a remarkable range of tone and
texture, allowing him the luxury of expression
on the bits of songs that allow it.
Few actually do, however.
"When Will I Be Famous," the
band's first hit (term used skepti
cally) is a classic piece of carefully
crafted pop, but with the dull hook
that attempts to pass as an ad
dictive chorus it does not even
establish itself as a nice bit of
fluff. How this song became

popular is an utter mystery.
The other British Top-5 hit
"Drop The Boy," which follows
immediately after "Famous," is a
little bit better, but again trans
forms the tried-and-true to failed
and-false. As funk the tune falls
flat, and as pop it falls short of
pleasing the masses — a tragic
double failure.
But the album really hits rough
water once the third song, "Ten
Out Of Ten," gets underway. With
the songs that the gurus at Epic
preordained as hit singles out of

the way, "Push" slips down past
the mediocrity of its best material
into the sheer boredom of the rest.
Unfortunately, the next five
songs don't get any better — the
music is so repetitive that even
someone laden with chores would
be hard pressed to resist the urge
to shut the record off. The cate
gory of laundry music seems to
good for "Push."
Bros attempt to inject some
meaning into the last two songs
of the effort, almost as if by af
terthought. "Shocked" tries to
tackle the issue of AIDS, but the
dance beat seems totally inappro
priate for the tone of the lyrics.
"Cat Among The Pigeons," how
ever, departs from the automatic
uptempo beat as it looks at rela
tionships in broken families,
making it surprisingly praise
worthy in the midst of abject fail
ure.
As in the case of Rick Astley,
Bros seem to be talented individ
uals stuck in the confines of
boring, unchallenging and uni
maginative material. Should they
decide to shuck their own songs
and try out something a little
more adventurous and entertain
ing, they may indeed become fa
mous; however, as it stands, Bros
may well retire before the boys
hit 20.
