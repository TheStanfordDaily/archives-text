Summer Jam '88 came to the
Shoreline Amphitheater this Sun
day, featuring 15 performing
groups playing to a sold-out au
dience of over 20,000 screaming
fans.
The concert was a benefit to
"fight back against crack" and
raised over $100,000. All of the
performers donated their appear

ances in conjunction with local
radio station KMEL 106.1 FM,
which organized the event.
By far the best performance of
the day came from young star A 1
B. Sure. Sure wowed the crowd,
playing songs from his number
one album for over a half an hour.
He was one of the few performers
to use a live back-up band, with
most of the others opting for re
corded mixes of their tunes.

Other notables at the concert
extravaganza included the Fat
Boys, who performed their hit
remakes "Wipeout" and"The
Twist", and headliner L.L. Cool
J. L.L. entertained the crowd for
nearly an hour with his version
of rap music, including his hit
song "I Need Love."
Other performers included
Pebbles, Expose, Cover Girl,
Brenda K. Starr and Keith Sweat.
