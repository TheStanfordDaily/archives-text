# Sprucing up the firehouse

Soon to be flashy red, rather than a
fading orange, the Old Firehouse is under
going miyor renovations to meet University
health and safety requirements — and im
prove its appearance.
While the paint job is giving the firehouse
a better look from the outside, indoor
sprinklers, a new heating system and safer
fire exits have improved the building from
within.
Constructed in 1904, the firehouse sur
vived the 1906 earthquake and housed a
student-volunteer fire department until
1967. Now the firehouse, located across
the street from Bowman Alumni House,
is the meeting place for more than 10
different campus groups. Included in the
firehouse are offices for X-TV, the Overseas
Development Network, the Graduate Stu
dents Association and the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford.
The firehouse's recent interior renova
tions resulted from a June 1987 plan drawn
up by the Dean of Student Affairs. The
number one priority of the plan was to

make the building safer; aesthetic improve
ments were priority number two, according
to Juan Yniguez, assistant dean of Student
Affairs.
After noticing that the University's
safety modification plan would not
safeguard the firehouse's historical charac
ter, GLAS found a San Francisco architect
specializing in the restoration of old build
ings and the University hired her, accord
ing to spokesperson Daniel Bao. The
architect suggested several ways of giving
the building a new — though not too new
look.
For example, the University's original
plan recommended replacing the original
wood-frame windows with metal-frame
windows. The plan also called for removing
the building's historic wooden tower that
used to be the drying spot for the firehoses.
Although the University has not followed
all the architect's recommendations exactly,
in general GLAS has been pleased with the
renovation that Bao said was "long
overdue" and makes the building look "very
nice."
Located in the firehouse since 1972,

GLAS members used to fear that if they
complained too much about the poor safety
conditions in the building then they would
be evicted, Bao said. Saying that he shared
the student concern for getting the repairs
done, Yniguez explained that a modest
budget limited repairs.
As a result, GLAS provided the labor for

the interior repainting and recarpeting of
their own meeting space. GLAS saved the
University a significant amount of money,
Bao said.
The firehouse's paint job got underway
on July 18 and should be completed by the
end of August, according to Hunt Scheelke,
supervisor of the University Paint Shop.


The newly-sprayed facade of the Old Firehouse looms in the background of the
parking lots behind Tresidder, awaiting its summer renovation. The 84-year-old
landmark will get a final coat of fire-engine red before the fall and a set of indoor
sprinklers to meet safety standards.
