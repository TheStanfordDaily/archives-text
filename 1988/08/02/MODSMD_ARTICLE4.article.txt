Although the final report of the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues will be delayed by one
to two months, members of UCMI said they are
optimistic about the current progress of their in
vestigation.
UCMI Chair A 1 Camarillo, associate professor of
history, said this week the committee expects to
finish its final report by late November or early
December, instead of by the previous October I
target date.
The UCMI has been conducting interviews and
surveys of members of the Stanford community for
over a year in an effort to gauge the quality of
minority life here.
Results of the UCMI's interim report, released
in early June, painted a bleak picture of minority
life jit Stanford and placed much of the blame on
a lack of responsiveness in the Office Student Affairs.
The report was heavily criticized by many University
officials for not being thorough and relying too
heavily on interviews with students.
Despite the current delay, Camarillo said students
are "very enthusiastic about the important issues
being tackled by the UCMI.
According to Camarillo, a written survey of un
dergraduates on minority issues conducted by Stan
ford Research Institute recorded a 70 to 80 percent
return rate, compared to usual rates of 38 to 42
percent for the annual residential education and
senior surveys.
