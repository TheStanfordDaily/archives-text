Although the final report of the University Com
mittee on Minority Issues will be delayed by one
to two months, members of UCMI said they are
optimistic about the current progress of their in
vestigation.
UCMI Chair A 1 Camarillo, associate professor of
history, said this week the committee expects to
finish its final report by late November or early
December, instead of by the previous October I
target date.
The UCMI has been conducting interviews and
surveys of members of the Stanford community for
over a year in an effort to gauge the quality of
minority life here.
Results of the UCMI's interim report, released
in early June, painted a bleak picture of minority
life jit Stanford and placed much of the blame on
a lack of responsiveness in the Office Student Affairs.
The report was heavily criticized by many University
officials for not being thorough and relying too
heavily on interviews with students.
Despite the current delay, Camarillo said students
are "very enthusiastic about the important issues
being tackled by the UCMI.
According to Camarillo, a written survey of un
dergraduates on minority issues conducted by Stan
ford Research Institute recorded a 70 to 80 percent
return rate, compared to usual rates of 38 to 42
percent for the annual residential education and
senior surveys.
This summer, the UCMI has
contracted SRI to conduct faculty,
staff and undergraduate student
surveys. The committee has also
hired the consulting firm Pacific
Management Systems to conduct
interviews with students and staff.
The agency recently completed
over 200 student interviews.
In the spring of 1987, the UCMI
was charged by the University
president and the Provost to "as

sess the institutional environment
for people of color at Stanford . . .
(and) move the University . . . fur
ther toward policies and practices
. . . to promote a genuine pluralis
tic community .. .
The UCMI had its first summer
retreat Saturday, July 23. Accord
ing to Camarillo, the committee
is now firming up strategies for
the upcoming final report.
Camarillo said he is "optimistic
about the opportunity to shape
the University into a better envi
ronment for multicultural inter
action" with the impact of the
final report.
