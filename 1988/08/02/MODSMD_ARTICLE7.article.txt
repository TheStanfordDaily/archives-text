# Swim team is moving fast to capture Coach Quick
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Faced with the prospect of replacing a
legend, the Stanford Athletic Department
has done what it does best: found another
one.
The leading candidate to replace women's
swimming Coach George Haines when he
retires August 31 is Richard Quick, the
brightest new face in the business.
Quick, currently the head women's coach
at the University of Texas, will be the head
coach of the U.S. team at next month's
Olympics and has guided the Longhorns
to five consecutive NCAA titles.
Stanford Assoc. Athletic Director Cheryl
Levick, who is handling the hiring, said
she is considering four "outstanding can
didates," but that Quick would be her first
choice. "Richard Quick has been offered
the position," she said. "We are discussing
final details."
"We're very excited about Richard's com
ing to Stanford," she added. " Richard's
very excited about coming to Stanford.
We're just finalizing some details."
Haines, who has been on the U.S. swim
team's coaching staff in each of the last
seven Olympics, took many by surprise
when he announced his retirement in June
In his seven years at Stanford Haines'
teams have never finished lower than third
at the NCAA Championships and have

produced 17 individual titles.
While he decides whether or not to
replace Haines, Quick's schedule is full. As
he is training his athletes for the Olympic
Trials, preparing to host the Trials at Texas
and preparing for the Olympics, he said is
giving this matter serious attention.
He added that he hopes to have all the
information he needs collected and a deci
sion made before the Trials begin Monday.
After visiting the Bay Area over the
weekend. Quick said, "I'm at the state
where I'm gathering information. I had a
few questions to ask and those are being
answered."
Perhaps the biggest stumbling block at
the moment is a housing question. Quick
and Levick both cited the lack of affordable
housing on the Peninsula as a problem
that will have to be solved for Quick to
come to the Farm.
Although he said he still has to speak
with the administrators at Texas, Quick
said he has a great respect for Stanford's
combination of academics and athletics.
"Stanford and Texas both are great insti
tutions," he said, "and they have a real
commitment to athletics, especially individ
ual sports and women's athletics. I think
Stanford — and Texas, but Stanford espe
cially — is a place that has a terrific aca
demic reputation."
Stanford men's swimming
Coach Skip Kenney said Quick
would be an ideal replacement for
Haines. "My son's named after
him," Kenney said, "1 can't say
any more about him than that.
As a person he's the very, very
best.
Senior Jenna Johnson, who has
won five NCAA titles to go along
with the gold and two silver
medals she won in the 1984 Olym
pics, said she feels the same way.
