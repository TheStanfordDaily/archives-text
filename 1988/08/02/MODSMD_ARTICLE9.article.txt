# Female lawyers on the increase
## Law School survey shows more women trying for the bar 
### Dan Harrington 
The percentage of women in the
legal profession is increasing but
women remain disadvantaged
professionally by their familial re
sponsibilities and report higher
levels of stress than male lawyers,
according to a recent article in
the Stanford Law Review.
The article, which appeared in
the May issue of the Law Review,
states that gender differences at
law schools are diminishing and
that women now account for 41
percent of all law students and 16
percent of practicing attorneys na
tionally.
Since 1963, the number of
female law students has risen
from 1,739 to 47,920 in 1986.
In fact, Stanford Law School
reports that 41 percent of its in
coming class this fall will be
female, a higher percentage than
in either the medical or business
schools here but lower than some
other California law schools.
At other law schools in Califor
nia, Hastings reported an enroll
ment of about 49 percent women
last year, while Mac George Law
School enrolled about 45 percent
women.
At Stanford last year, the Med
ical School enrolled about 40 per
cent women while the Business

School enrolled about 31 percent
women. Both expect this year's
figures to be about the same.
Titled "Gender and the Law,"
the Law Review article was writ
ten by a team of eight authors
from the Law School and Depart
ment of Psychology. It is largely
based on a survey of all 516 stu
dents at the Law School in Dec.
1986 — 46 percent of whom were
women.
All 764 living female graduates
of the Law School and a random
sample of 764 male graduates
were also surveyed.
The survey found that men
were more likely to indicate fi
nancial or political reasons for at
tending law school, while women
were more likely to cite a desire
to serve society.
The survey also determined
that men were more likely to dom
inate classroom discussions. Both
graduates and students indicated
that men were more likely than
women to ask questions and vol
unteer answers and that profes
sors are more likely to call on
male students.
Similar findings were recently
reported in a study at Yale.
Among other findings, the
study reported that men were
more likely than women to prac
tice corporate law (65 percent to

45 percent), to work more hours
on their current jobs, to leave the
legal field to pursue business in
terests or to make more money
and to enjoy the adversarial na
ture of law.
Women, however, were more
likely than men to have inter
rupted or slowed the progress of
their careers for family reasons.
In an accompanying essay,
Stanford Law Prof. Deborah L.
Rhode wrote, "the question is not
simply how well women can ac
comodate the demands of male
dominated professions but also
how those professions must
change to accomodate women."
"Over nine out of 10 males in
upper-level corporate positions
have children and a nonworking
spouse. Most female executives
have neither," Rhode wrote. "One
need not be a Social Darwinist to
find such patterns disturbing."
Rhode suggested that women
seeking success feel pressure to
avoid vacations and extended
maternity leave and to work
longer hours than their male com
petitors.
Rhode concluded that: "It is fair
to hope that the increased repre
sentation of women will prompt
reassessment of professional insti
tutions and the values underlying
them."
