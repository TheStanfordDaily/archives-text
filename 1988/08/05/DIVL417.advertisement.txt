There is a better way
to earn your wings.
In this day and age, earning your wings is no easy task.
We at the Stanford Flying Club can help. We offer flying
lessons at affordable prices. Our Instructor-Pilots will take you
all the way from your first lesson to your pilot's license. Most
students obtain their Solo License with only 10 to 20 hours of
flying ti.ne. And we also have advanced and aerobatics classes
when you're ready.
Give us a call today between 1:00 - 5:30 pm and find out more.
Earning your wings was never so much fun.
