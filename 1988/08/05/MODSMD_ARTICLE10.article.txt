# Star Wars laser battle rages on
## Livermore scientist lashes out against Hoover Institution's Teller 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
Responding to an attack against
him by Secretary of Energy John
Herrington, Lawrence Livermore
scientist Roy Woodruff has vowed
to continue his criticism of Hoover
Institution Fellow Edward Teller
and to show that Teller's state
ments about the "Star Wars" X
ray laser are overly optimistic.
For several years, Woodruff has
accused Teller of exaggerating the
effectiveness of an X-ray laser in
President Reagan's proposed Star
Wars missile defense. Teller's ad
vocacy of this Strategic Defense
Initiative has been crucial in win
ning government funding of the
project.
At a Livermore press conference
two weeks ago, Herrington called
Teller "a national asset" and at
tacked Woodruff for his public
criticism of Teller.
Herringlun said that "anti-SDI

interests are using Dr. Woodruff
to bolster their cause and he's
playing right in to their hands."
Woodruff responded to Her
rington's attack in a telephone in
terview Tuesday. "If there is one
person who is out of line, it is
John Herrington. What he said
was outrageous," Woodruff said.
Woodruff has said that the
debate should be brought to the
public because billions of dollars
of government funds are being
spent each year on SDI research,
and hundreds of millions of these
dollars are being spent on the X
ray laser.
Controversy between the scien
tists centers around a series of
letters Teller sent to President
Reagan's Science Advisor George
Keyworth in 1983-1984 advocat
ing funds for the X-ray laser.
Woodruff hailed the recently
declassified letters as proof that
Teller blatantly misrepresented
the potential of the X-ray laser.

Ray Kidder, a senior physicist
who has consistently spoken out
against Teller, supported
WoodrufTs position wholehearted
ly. Kidder said that Teller's early
support of the X-ray laser was
"almost stupidly optimistic" and
"irresponsible."
"The evidence points very much
in favor of Woodruff and much
against Teller's position," Kidder
said.
Teller has refused to talk to the
press and would not return phone
calls this week. George Chapline,
a colleague of Teller's who takes
credit for inventing the X-ray
laser, asserted that Teller's state
ments in the letters were misrep
resented by opponents.
Teller was only suggesting that
it was possible for an X-ray laser
to be built, not that it was
probable, Chapline said.
"I'm not aware that Teller has
ever said that it (the laser) is likely
to be achieved," Chapline said.
