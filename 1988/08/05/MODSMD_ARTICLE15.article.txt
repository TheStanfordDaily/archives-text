# Palestian group active in West Bank power vacuum
## 
### 
JERUSALEM - Underground
leaders of the Arab uprising in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank
are preparing a dramatic "decla
ration of independence" to assert
a Palestinian claim to the land
effectively renounced last week
end by King Hussein of Jordan,
a source close to the clandestine
group said yesterday.
By moving into the vacuum left
by Hussein befoTe the Israeli and
U.S. elections this fall, the Unified
National Leadership for the
Uprising in the Occupied Ter
ritories sees what may be a his
toric opportunity to win political
recognition, said the source, who
in the past has had extraordinary
knowledge about the group's in
ner deliberations.
The most important component
of the declaration, which would
also apply to the Gaza Strip, is
expected to be at least an implicit
acceptance of Israel's right to ex
ist, according to this source, who
spoke on the condition of
anonymity. Thus, he said, the Pal
estinians would address perennial

U.S. and Israeli concern that their
goal is to eliminate the Zionist
state.
If implemented in its current
form, the declaration would mark
a bold effort by the Palestinians
to take the political offensive for
the first time since the "intifada,"
or uprising, began last December
in tbe West Bank and the Gaza
Strip. But it is not expected to be
announced for several weeks, the
source cautioned, and given the
volatile nature of Palestinian
politics it may undergo some
changes in that time.
"Such a declaration is a neces
sity," the source said. "It's the
most important positive political
action for the Palestinians since
the intifada began."
At the same time, he added, it
could function as "a political stone
against all Israelis and Ameri
cans," forcing Israel, the United
States and some Palestinian
leaders to re-evaluate their posi
tions in the Middle East.
