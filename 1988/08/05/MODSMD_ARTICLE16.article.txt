WASHINGTON — The House, acting to redress
a wrong committed against Japanese Americans
interned during World War 11, gave final congres
sional approval yesterday to legislation expressing
a national apology and authorizing tax-free payments
of $20,000 each to individuals who suffered wartime
imprisonment.
For Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., who cannot
receive the money because he voted for the bill, it
was an especially joyful moment because he presided
over the chamber during the 257-156 roll call that
sent the measure to President Reagan for his signa
ture.
Reagan indicated recently that he was eager to
approve the bill and end "a sad chapter in American
history in a way that reaffirms America's commit
ment to the preservation of liberty and justice for
all."
Opponents argued that the action against an es
timated 120,000 Japanese Americans on the West
Coast was an unfortunate wartime mistake but did
not justify $1.25 billion in payments to redress a
wholesale violation of civil liberties.
"In time of war, when a country is threatened
for its very survival, many lives are disrupted for
no logical reason," Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., said.
Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., said her hus
band, a Korean War veteran, threatened to divorce
her if she voted for the bill. She voted against it.
A majority of the House members who spoke,
however, agreed with Rep. Leon Panetta. D-Calif.,

that the evacuation and imprisonment of Americans
of Japanese ancestry from 1942 to 1945 was a
"national shame."
Mineta, who spoke last, delivered a moving speech
on the legislation, which has taken almost a decade
to move from introduction to passage.
"This is a deeply personal issue for a small number
of us," he began. "But this legislation touches all
of us because it goes to the very core of our nation.
"Does our Constitution protect all of us — re
gardless of race or culture? Do our rights remain
inalienable even in times of stress — and especially
in times of stress?
"1 am deeply honored to serve in this body as it
takes the great step of admitting and redressing a
monumental injustice," Mineta concluded in a
hushed chamber. Spontaneous applause — a rarity
in the House — greeted his remarks.
Mineta was 10 years old when he and his family
were taken from their home in San Jose, Calif., and
placed in an internment camp at a Santa Anita,
Calif., racetrack in May 1942, about five months
after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.
Later that year, Mineta's family was moved to
another camp at Heart Mountain, Wyo., where it
remained until November 1943, when it was released
and allowed to join Mineta's father, who was teach
ing Japanese in an Army school at the University
of Chicago.
