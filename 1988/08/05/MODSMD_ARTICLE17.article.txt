policeman now serving his 10th term in Congress,
was convicted yesterday on federal racketeering,
conspiracy and extortion charges for taking bribes
from the Wedtech Corp. in exchange for his po-

litical influence.
Four other men, including
Wedtech founder John Mariotta,
once hailed by President Reagan
as a "hero for the 80s," were also
found guilty by a Manhattan jury
on the main racketeering and
conspiracy charges. They face up
to 20 years in prison for rack
eteering, the most serious felony.
Biaggi's son, Richard, a lawyer,
was found not guilty on those

counts but was found guilty of five other felonies,
including aiding and abetting his father in the
receipt of a Wedtech bribe.
The verdicts concluded the first comprehensive
jury trial resulting from a scandal that tarnished
both Democratic and Republican officeholders for
their dealings with the Bronx-based defense com
pany. Former White House aide Lvn Nofziger
was convicted last Feburary of illegal lobbying
on Wedtech's behalf. Attorney General F^dwin

Meese 111 announced his resignation last month
following a 14-month investigation initiated be
cause of the help he provided Wedtech as coun
selor to President Reagan.

is a candidate for the Republican vice presidential

ful for your consideration, but I
must tell you that I cannot be
considered for the office of vice
president," Deukmejian told Bush
in the letter. The letter, dated
