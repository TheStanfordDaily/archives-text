## Help save the earth 
### 
A safe environment
can start on campus

NO MORE Florida, no
more Louisiana.
By the next cen
tury, much of these states
could be underwater if indi
viduals do not start recog
nizing their fundamental
link to the environment.
But what can Joe Stan
ford student do to help
prevent this trend?
A lot.
Today high levels of car
bon dioxide and other
gaseous pollutants are im
proving the atmosphere's
ability to radiate heat back
to the earth. This global
warming — known as the
green house effect — might
cause the ice cap to melt,
resulting in a dramatic rise
in sea levels and the disap
pearance of coastlands.
Some scientists are point
ing to this summer's on
going drought and high tem
peratures as the first sign
of the greenhouse effect.
They say the culprit behind
the greenhouse effect is car
bon dioxide, released by the
burning of gas, oil and other
fossil fuels. The destruction
of forests also contributes to
increases in the amount of
carbon dioxide in the atmos
phere.
Wholeheartedly believing

that Stanford students are
young, active leaders who
can make a difference, the
University urges students to
become engaged in the
pressing environmental
problems that face our so
ciety. Witness the topic for
this year's You Can Make a
Difference Conference —
the environment.
During the conference, a
two-hour panel discussion
will focus on specific steps
individuals can take for
beating the greenhouse ef
fect. Biking rather than
driving, buying energy
efficient refrigerators or
simply planting a tree can
all help slow down the
greenhouse effect, according
to conference leaders.
By attending the confer
ence, students can also learn
about local and regional en
vironmental groups who are
making a concerted effort to
consume less energy.
This fall Civil Engineer
ing 170, taught by Prof. Gil
Masters, will also introduce
students to the causes, ef
fects and methods for con
trolling environmental
degradation.
Although Masters' class
meets at 8 a.m., it is well
worth the early morning
rise.
For the sooner individuals
learn how connected they
are to the rest of the living
earth, the better for the en
vironment — and for us all.
