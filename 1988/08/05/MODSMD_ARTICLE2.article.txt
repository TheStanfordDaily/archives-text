# Facts link suicide to graduate's fall
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Police evidence indicates that
University graduate Austin Stan
ford intentionally jumped from
the 14th floor of a research build
ing at the University of California
at San Francisco Medical Center.
Last Sunday, Stanford man
aged to "squeeze over" a locked
area and onto the 14th-story bal
cony from which he apparently
leapt from, according to UCSF
Police Sargeant David Wright.
Noting that Stanford could not
have accidentally ventured onto
the balcony, Wright said "a person
who does not have a desire to get
out there (on the balcony) would
not get out there."
While UCSF police wait for
findings from the San Francisco
Coroner's office before they issue
a final report, Wright said his in
vestigation indicates that Stan
ford did commit suicide. The final
police report will be released this
afternoon.
While the motive for Stanford's
suicide remains unknown, his
death emphasized the high level
of stress facing medical students.
Assoc. Dean of Stanford Uni
versity's Medical School Roy
Maffly pointed to a unique pro

gram at Stanford that helps stu
dents alleviate stress.
The program allows students to
spread their studies over five
years for no extra cost. Giving
students a chance to do some extra
research or take a class on the
main campus, the five-year pro
gram — which most medical stu
dents take advantage of — helps
alleviate stress, according to Maff
ly-
He also noted that the Univer
sity has established a committee
made up of faculty and students
that examines the curriculum de
mands placed on medical students.
There has not been a suicide at
Stanford's Medical School in at
least 10 years, he said.
UCSF Medical Center Assoc.
Dean David Altman said his school
has limited finances and cannot
support the same type of stress
reduction programs as Stanford.
UCSF tries to provide students

with "individual" rather than "in
stitutional" support, he said.
"We have flexibility in the cur
riculum. .. We try to have the
faculty tuned into the problems
students can get into," he said.
Like Stanford University,
UCSF is now establishing a com
mittee that will examine the well
being of medical students.
"We copy a lot of Stanford's
stuff," Altman said.
According to a 1981 survey in
the American Journal of Psychol
ogy, from 1974 to 1981 the suicide
rate was 15.6 percent for both
medical students and others in the
same age group. However, the
suicide rate was three to four
times higher for female medical
students than for females who
were not in medical school, Maffly
noted.
