## Don't lump critics of the Contras with their supporters 
### 
CARLA HAY says she is
angry over the recent
exchange of letters about
the Central American conflict,
into whose general and un
savory company I apparently
have been herded, having myself
participated in the exchange.
She complains that South Africa
deserves just as much attention.
She apparently doesn't remem
ber the letters written by Rac
helle Marshall, who has indeed
mentioned this particular lack of
consistency among supporters of
Contra violence.
On the one hand, those who
support the Contras (Singlaub,
Jerry Falwell, Swaggart,
Reagan, et al) say they will lend
the "freedom fighters" anything
at their disposal; yet when it
comes to South Africa, each of
the above named individuals
insists that violence is not an
acceptable option in redressing
the wrongs of South Africa, nor
for that matter are even eco
nomic sanctions. Why can the
the Contras kill indiscriminately
in the name of freedom while
the blacks and "coloreds" of
South Africa are not allowed
this option even in self defense?
How, in fact, are the Contras
any different from the brutal

"Marxists" they oppose in
name, if not in practice?
I am neither a Hoover fellow
nor a professor, and so do not
publish as often, but I believe
most of the world feels that
apartheid is the Nazism of the
80's (although it has been a
political fact for decades).
I do not, however, feel that
neglecting to mention that fact
in a debate about Central
America necessarily condones,
ignores or diminishes the horror
of apartheid, and 1 resent Hay
implying as much.
When she lumps all the letter
writers into a single general
group as wanting "to have the
last word" and as differing only
in their "approach to how a
government should work," and
then accuses the group, gener
ally speaking, of succumbing to
"personal" criticism, she is ar
guing that every position is
simply the refuge of private
opinion, that agreed upon facts
serve no purpose, and that lies
hold equal sway with generally
observable data. I think she has
confused literary criticism with
the unpleasant fact of daily
murder.
I have just spent the last nine
months watching my wife beg

various physicians in the Bay
Area to perform facial surgery
on a five year old Nicaraguan
boy whose lower left jaw was
blown off by a Contra machine
gun. I am aware of the genius
we have for dismissing this sort
of incident as regrettable but
unavoidable in war, or as
propaganda or as an isolated
exception.
But 1 know this for what it is
— the unwillingness to sacrifice
comfortable political notions
that have furnished us with
wealth and power. Our family
has had to come to terms with
the fact of over 5,000
Nicaraguan children deprived of
an arm or a leg or some other
part of their body. These are
the real casualties of war, and
they weren't deformed by the
Sandinistas.
In my book, those who sup
port random killings and
maiming as a tactic of "low
intensity warfare" are little bet
ter than any other killer. Is this
"personal" criticism?
In my first letter I said
choosing between two alleged
thugs is no choice, however
honeyed the supposed choice
may be. But there are many
differences between the Contras

and the Sandinistas, not the
least of which is that my gov
ernment is paying for a group
criticized by nearly every
reputable independent human
rights organization.
By lumping together all the
members of this disagreement
over Nicaragua, Hay has
trivialized the issues of murder
and oppression. Any inquiry
into data available from organi
zations with no stake in the
conflict, such as Americas
Watch or Amnesty Interna
tional, will show anyone that
human rights are honored un
der the Sandinistas — they do
not as a matter of course tor
ture or murder dissidents.
And if my objections are con
sidered merely "personal" when
I take serious exception to thost
who perpetuate lies and
propaganda in the service of a
convenient economic and politi
cal agenda (which is precisely
why the United States will not
act in South Africa), then I
have no apologies. I will suffer
the fact that Hay is "a little
angry."
