## Oppression under cover 
### 
ABOUT A year ago, a writer
named Andrea Dworkin
stunned even the most un
repentant members of the
feminist community with a book
whose appropriately terse title
was "Intercourse."
Dworkin's simple assertion in
this book was that sexual inter
course, like other features of the
American landscape such as por
nography, housewifery and the
lack of equal wages for compara
ble work, is an institution of male
oppression meant to keep women
from meeting their true potential
as human beings.
If, like myself, you had read the
reviews of the book before the
book itself, you would have been
convinced that Dworkin was an
angry fringe fruitcake, and that
the assertions in her book would
be ridiculously easy to shoot to
bits. No such luck.
Within their system of logic,
anyway, Dworkin's arguments are
perfectly rational. I risk oversim
plification here, as always, but
Dworkin's argument runs some
thing like this. Intercourse is the
final frontier of male domination.
It is precisely because it is the
last frontier, the most subtle ma
nipulation, that intercourse is

such a sacred cow. And only
through confronting the fact that
intercourse is a means of preserv
ing male supremacy, according to
Dworkin, can we come to realize
what a pervasive monopoly on
power men have.
These arguments drew thunder
ing condemnations from those few
observers who deigned to investi
gate its claims. Why, they asked,
did Dworkin feel the need to decry
such a healthy pursuit as unfet
tered, uncomplicated, unques
tioned consensual sex between
men and women? (The underlying
innuendo, of course, was that
Dworkin was a frigid dyke.)
Her attitude — that every act
of intercourse is a violation, no
matter how ostensibly consensual
(because it tramples her privacy,
makes her a possession, some goal
to be attained) — is the kind of
attitude liable to make many men
chortle and say, "all she needs is
a good —Which only goes to
prove her point.
What doesn't go to prove
Dworkin's point, and what ulti
mately brings it down, is her
reliance on question-begging to
get her argument across. Her ar
gument is Marxist in style; it
makes the pretense of ferreting

all the bull out and distilling
everything down to the essentials
of who owns whom. To say that
intercourse is an act of oppression
without exploring the rationale
behind that oppression, without
asking why men, consciously or
subconsciously, would use love
making as the ultimate weapon,
ignores the very issue that
Dworkin presumes to explore.
None of this is meant to deny
her arguments' provocativeness.
When 1 come across arguments
that so glibly stray away from the
realm of logic, however, I begin
to wonder.
And the simplest question of
all: what would Dworkin have us
all do with our lust (not just men,
but women)? Put it in a trust
fund until we become better
tutored in the art of equality?
Good luck, Andrea.
