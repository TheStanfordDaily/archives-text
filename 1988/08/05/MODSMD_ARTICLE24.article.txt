Stanford cat population must be reduced

I WORK in Encina Hall and
over the past two years I
have become aware of an
increasingly alarming problem
with stray cats on campus.
Let me say right here that I
am a cat lover of the utmost
extreme. I have rescued ten
kittens at Stanford over the
past two years — one litter was
ten days old and required bottle
feedings every four hours.
It is this love for cats that
has led me to want to alleviate
this problem. I have come to
the conclusion that the best.

and really the only, way to deal
with this problem is to have the
cats trapped and taken to the
nearby humane societies.
The adult cats are quite wild
and unless they could be placed
on farms or ranches could never
become pets. Every year the
females have at least one litter
of kittens, many of which suffer
slow, painful deaths.
I understand that the Univer
sity has taken a hands-off policy
towards the stray cat problem
because every time they try to
trap the cats, groups of people

complain so loudly that the
project is dropped.
I would like to say that if
anyone has any sense of
humaneness for these beautiful
animals they would realize that
trapping them and, if they are
not adoptable, putting them to
sleep painlessly is the most
merciful solution (young kittens
can generally be adopted). Or, I
would suggest that these people
adopt the cats themselves or
pay to have them fixed so the
endless cycle of kittens can be
stopped. Simply feeding them is
not the solution, as they con
tinue to breed and the problem
intensifies.
I urge anyone who wants to
help with this problem, please
report any stray cats near your
building to your department
head or building manager. They
in turn can contact Work Infor
mation to request that the cat
be trapped.
I hope we will be able to
work together to alleviate the
overpopulation of cats here at
Stanford.
