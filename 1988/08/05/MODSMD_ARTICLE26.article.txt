## Summer jazz fest at Frost 
### Lisa Mackey Staff writer 
Saxophonist Stan Getz and guitarist
Joe Pass will be at Frost Amphitheater
Sunday to display their artistry and
raise money for the Music Department's
jazz program.
"It's a celebration of jazz," said
Marsha Shinkman, the program coordi
nator. Shinkman said the popularity of
the "mini festival" has mushroomed
since its beginning in 1986. In the past,
musicians Jim Nadel, Diane Schuui and
the hit band Manhattan Transfer have
joined Getz for the afternoon of summer
entertainment.
Getz, a tenor saxophonist who head
lines a program at Frost every August,
has played with such jazz greats as
Count Basie, Benny Carter, Ella
Fitzgerald and Oscar Peterson.
In the '60s, Getz popularized Bossa
Nova, a type of Latin music with mix
tures of African rhythm. "Stan is very
influential in getting this type of music
here at Stanford. Once again he will be
playing Latin music," said Fred Spitz,
the producer of the concert.
Viva Brasil, a group of five artists
from San Francisco, will have their
debut performance with Getz this Sun
day.
Pass will also give a solo performance.
Shinkman said critics rave about Pass's
skill and have called him the first
guitarist to rival the late Wes Mont
gomery.
According to Bill Milkowski of Jazziz
Magazine, Pass is "prolific, profound and
there is no one like him on the planet.
(He swings) over bop changes, playing
the blues with real feeling."
"Such a jazz event should never be
missed, . . . especially having Getz and
Pass in the same arena," said Joe
Oliveira, erstwhile coordinator of the
jazz festival.
The Hi-Lo's, a popular jazz band that
has been together for over 30 years, will
also be at Frost on Sunday. "It is more
of a mini festival that goes from hot to
cool; Viva will be hot and the Hi-Lo's
will be cool," said Shinkman.
Getz will also play with a quartet dur
ing the concert. Joe Nadel and the Stan
ford Jazz Workshop All Stars will round
off the entertainment for the 6,000 jazz

enthusiasts expected. "The concert
should appeal to a large group of people,"
said Claude Anyos, one of the board
members on the Committee for Jazz at
Stanford.
"The goal is to get jazz integrated into
the Stanford community, so the jazz
festival will happen each year," Oliveira
said.
"The academic program is now finish
ing its third year. It is unique in the
United States and brings opportunity to
Stanford students to learn jazz by play
ing it in small ensembles supported by
classes in music theory and history,"
said Nadel, coordinatior of the jazz pro
gram.
The concert gates will open at noon
and the tickets are $13 for Stanford
students and $18 for general admission.
Tickets are available at the Tresidder
ticket office.
