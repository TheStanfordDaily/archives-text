# Dieter Rams decries 'visual pollution'
## Design for the next millenium 
### Kate Oliver 
Editor's Note: Last week Dieter Rams,
the director of the design department at
Braun Corporation, came to Stanford to
speak at a conference sposnsored by the
Alumni Association. Introduced as a man
who designs "products that become poses
sions," Rams is the mind behind the sleek,
unmistakable alarm clocks and coffee
makers hip enough to beat the twenty-first
century blues. Daily reporter Kate Oliver
interviewed Rams for an hour on a bench
outside the Art Department and asked about
Braun's vision and the nature of design.

ko: Are you ready for an interview?

dr: My experience
with journalism
here is that what
comes out is
serious. In Europe,
they are more inter
ested in the spectac
ular.
ko: I'm surprised,
dr: They always
press you to say
something about
the future. Nobody
knows that.

ko: So what are
you going to say? Isn't your lecture titled
"Functional Design: A Challenge for the
Future"?
dr: My lecture is about the differences
between functional design and functional
ism (I hate all those things that end in
"ism"). Functional design is, I believe, still
the future. Industrial design is a young
profession and, let's be honest, in no detail
have we designers achieved the utility of
the tool.
We have to design products that are good
tools . . . real tools that workers have to
work with everyday. That is functional;
that is design that serves its purpose, not
this functionalism.
ko: By "functionalism," do you mean a
look?
dr: Yes, it is a style or whatever. It is
wrong. So that is what is in my speech.
I'm not speaking about future things. Who
knows what the future is. We have enough
to do every day to keep our world in con
ditions we can live with.. For example, the
physical pollution — we know what we
have to do. It costs a lot of money and we
have to do it.

'That has been my intention
right from the beginning.
Products should be like a
good English butler; (they)
should be there when you
need them, should be in the
background when you don't.'

We also have visual pollution which is
also a dangerous thing — this isn't just
product design, it's graphic design, it means
television, it means all communication, and
all these things are becoming more and
more, louder and louder. Everything is
spectacular. Everything should be quieter,
more serious, should be more functional,
should inform people, should be more
honest, not lying. Most of advertising is
lying
ko: Braun products have a certain de
pendable 100k...
dr: That has been my intention right
from the beginning. Products should be
like a good English butler; (they) should
be there when you need them, should be
in the backround

when you don't.
ko: How would
you define the word
"design"?
dr: Design means
a lot. Especially it
means making
things happen,
whether it is a prod
uct or a behavior.
Last time I was here
in the states I saw
a bakery with a sign

outside saying "We
have the best designed cookies in New
York." To make cookies is a kind of design.
Cookies — they are overdesigned some
times.
There is lots of design .. . hair design,
fashion design. I'm more involved in tech
nological design. The main thing 1 would
like to underline when I say technological
design is the part "logical".
ko: What about the design of the design
conference refreshment table in front of us?
dr: All those things on the table are not
real plastic things, not long lasting. The
kitchen machine I designed with my col
leagues in 1957 is still on the market. We
need plastic but I'm fighting against the
throw away habits, against all these plastic
things here that we throw away.
ko: Aren't products too quiet sometimes?
I could talk with a butler.
dr: I think it is very important to keep
this kind of product more in the back
ground, fascinating when you need them.
But they should not be the main thing.
The main things are still the flowers, the
trees, and the people by themselves, not
what thev use.
