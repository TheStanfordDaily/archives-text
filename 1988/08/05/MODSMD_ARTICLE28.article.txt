# Books for places far and wide: opening up to foreign cultures
## 
### 
In our last books page, we suggested
books for the languid summer days of
Palo Alto. This week, we shift our focus
to the world abroad, as our book
reviewers present books pertaining to Ox
ford, Berlin, Paris and Argentina.
These locations are of particular in
terest to the Stanford community; in
three of the places covered, Stanford
overseas programs are already well es
tablished. And Overseas Studies hopes

to open a campus in the fourth location,
Argentina, during the 1989-90 academic
year.
The authors of the following book
reviews have all spent time in the city
where his or her particular book is set.
Frank Lester, Leslie Teicholz and
Melissa Walter studied with Stanford
Overseas programs, while Jennifer
Mnookin is spending this year studying
and writing in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Women of the Left Bank
Shari Benstock
University of Texas, 1987, $12.95.
Our image of modernist Paris, city of
romance and artistic inspiration, is shaped
by the experience of expatriate U.S. and
English writers, publishers and artists who
lived on the left bank of Paris from the
turn of the century until 1941. It is an
image from which women writers are
glaringly absent.
Part biography, part history, part
literary criticism, Women of the Left Bank
describes with care and empathy the lives
and works of the women of the "modernist"
left bank culture. They were not only fas
cinating characters, but also perceptive,
dedicated writers, publishers and jour
nalists.
Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, and
H.D., the imagist poet, are probably the
best known of Benstock's subjects.
Through Wharton, who first arrived in
Paris in 1893, Benstock introduces the

reader to the pre-World War One salon
culture of the seventh arrondissement,
where aristocrats and prostitutes mingled
for lively conversation. Closed and often
conservative, this culture was alien to the
bohemian sixth arrondissement where
Stein lived and held her salon.
Benstock provides a juicy, sympathetic
portrait of Stein. She discusses Stein's style
of dress (between monk and earth mother),
her relationship with Alice B. Toklas, her
egotism and the genius of her literary proj
ect, in which she focused on language itself,
rather than the meaning behind language.
Benstock's discussion of Hilda Doolittle
(H.D.) portrays not only the positive but
also the significantly destructive influence
of Ezra Pound.
Women of the Left Bank discusses, and
for many readers introduces, over a dozen
more "women of the written word." Their
claims to fame vary. Sylvia Beach took on
the risky and taxing task of publishing
Joyce's Ulysses in her bookstore, Shake
speare and Company. The bookstore, which
provided a lending library and gathering
place for writers and publishers of the pe
riod, now sits opposite Notre Dame near
rue St. Jacques.
Natalie Barney wrote mainly poetry,
presided over a lively salon and held
Sappho-inspired, women-only evenings of
"Attic abandonment." At one of these
soirees, the French writer Colette — who
performed in nightclubs for a living because
her ex-husband Willy sold the publishing
rights to her successful Claudine novels —
danced nude by the Greek temple in the
backyard. Djuna Barnes, who represented
seductive and destructive beauty, the lonely
Jean Rhys, and Anais Nin wrote fiction
and poetry.
The book may make the streets of Paris,
which can seem forbiddingly sexist, seem
more friendly to present-day American
women, since it traces a history of creative,
independent women living there.
Most of Benstock's subjects, including
Gertrude Stein and H.D., were lesbians, so
they faced in America more constraints on
their life and work than men — or even
straight women — did. The patriarchy not
only discouraged and devalued their con
tributions to literary and intellectual life,
but it also repressed and denied their
sexuality. Benstock quotes Stein as saying,
"It was not what France gave you but
what it did not take away that was impor
tant."
To Benstock's great credit, she does not
lump these women together because of
their shared sexual orientation, but rather

carefully explores the differences that ex
isted in their attitudes, abilities and con
straints. The feminine, mythical lesbianism
of Natalie Barney differed greatly from the
various attitudes of the cigar-smoking
cross-dressers.
Seeking to emphasize the contribution
of these women to modernism, the book
contains perceptive textual analysis, dis
cussing and often rejecting in some mea
sure earlier analyses which defined the
women only in terms of the men they were
involved with and belittled their work.
The book also contains many interesting
tidbits, such as the year in which the word
for heterosexuality came into the French
language (1911).
Benstock quotes Ezra Pound as saying,
"Paris, the paradise of artists irrespective
of their merit or demerit, invites one to
anything but a critical attitude."
No doubt he means this disparagingly.
Yet, it should be used to praise Women of
the Left Bank-, rather than making reduc
tionist pronouncements on what is good
and what is bad, Benstock concentrates on
giving these women their own voice (using
quotes from their work and letters) and
seeks to describe the truth of their lives.
If she must sacrifice a little of the grace
and clarity of her own text, so be it.

The Book and the Brotherhood
Iris Murdoch
Viking, 1987, $19.95.
As steeped in ceremony and as celebrated
in fable as Oxford is, in putting together
this review, I figured it wouldn't be too
hard to find a recent piece of fiction by
which to gauge the modern Oxford exper
ience.
Thomas Hardy and Max Beerbohm are
hard ones to follow, but the task isn't
insurmountable — or so I thought.
The most recent fiction I could find about
the town of dreaming spires is distin
guished, above all, by its obsession with
the gowned set and its hyper-bourgeois
conflicts. Iris Murdoch is a highly respected
writer, but since this, her 23rd novel, is
the only one I've ever read, I find myself
puzzled over what exactly her reputation
is based on.
Her publisher proudly emblazons the
book jacket with lavish accolades: According
to Anthony Burgess the novel "has the
assurance of a writer who has worked long
in the medium." There's even a quote from
Allan Bloom, of Closing-of-the-American-
Mind fame, not about this particular book,
but of Murdoch's oeuvre: "A great novel
could yet come (from Murdoch), rather sur
prisingly in the ... form of the 19th
century realistic novel."
The publisher assures us that this is
precisely the form The Book and the Brot
herhood takes, when it is actually an event
far less stupendous — Murdoch is the vic
tim of unfulfillable Balzacian (if not Prous
tian) aspirations that frequently, in this
novel's 600-plus pages, become pretentious.
The novel's plot rotates about the
agonies of a group of 10 or so former
Oxonians who have come to adulthood un

der the spell of a man named David
Crimond, an egomaniac who combines in
one brain the worst propensities of both
Svengali and Marx.
There is actually very little to speak of
in the storyline itself; in the tradition of
George Eliot and Doris Lessing, Murdoch's
novel assumes that the inner psychological
wranglings of a flock of intellectual in
timates can be enough to label her fiction
magnificent. Unlike the aforementioned au
thors, and presumably unlike this author's
earlier work (to give her the benefit of the
doubt), Murdoch in this novel has had a
hard time convincing us that any of these
characters' movements matter.
Perhaps history will judge me wrong in
this assessment, just as it judged the critics
of War and Peace. But when six characters
are introduced to me in the first two pages,
to no effect, with no seeming purpose, and
things get no better as the novel progresses,
I have to wonder whether Dame M. was
having an off-year when she wrote this
book.
The extent of the novel's scope, after all,
is the purview of no more than a dozen
people, and a dozen unimportant people at
that. Even Chekhov knew that the first
law of fiction was to breathe significance
into your most inconspicuous doorman.
The lackadaisical style of the book,
punctuated as it is not by the courtesy of
commas in subordinate clauses, does not
help.
You will note that I have said next to
nothing about this novel's connection to
the Oxford experience. There is none, un
less you are more than willing to indulge
an already virulent American impression
of Oxford as a cloistered burg of ivory
Continued on next page

towers, snooty pretense and solipsistic pur
suit.
That is merely the face Oxford presents
of itself, because, like any pampered
dowager, it is afraid of meeting the people
who will lift its gorgeous veil and send its
ancient perfumes dissolving into the Cher
well winds.

Berlin Stories
Christopher Isherwood
First published 1935. New Directions,
$6.95.
Literary luminary Gore Vidal calls Is
herwood "the best prose writer in English."
W.H. Auden termed him "a brilliant young
novelist" and "our ambassador to the mad."
While some might protest claims so ex
treme, few would deny that this twentieth
century British author is a writer of ex
traordinary talent.
Isherwood's books reflect an admirable
combination of literary sophistication and
readability. One might compare his great
charm to J.D. Salinger's — except Isher
wood overcomes the self-consciousness that
marks Salinger's work. While Salinger
coaxes the reader to admire his work, Is
herwood — not without arrogance —
merely steps aside to enjoy his due praise.
His prose is polished, perceptive and un
flinchingly controlled.
Although Isherwood has been writing for
five decades, he is best known for the novels
he wrote on Berlin during the 19305: Mr.
Norris Changes Trains and Goodbye to Ber
lin.
These novels are set in pre-World War
II Berlin, a tumultuous time and place
that witnessed the fall of the Weimar Re
public, soaring unemployment, the devas

tating devaluation of the Deutsch Mark
and the rise of Hitler's Nazism.
Against this uneasy background Isher
wood presents the Berliners themselves,
characters who have been immortalized in
the Broadway adaptations "Cabaret" and
"I Am a Camera."
Mr. Norms Changes Trains deftly paints
the portrait of Mr. Arthur Norris, a con
artist who is at once both charming and
sinister, dangerous and childlike. In addi
tion to his intrinsic interest as a character,
he is a convenient source for a parable of
German pre-war politics: By the end of the
book we realize the narrator's naivete in
dealing with Mr. Norris mirrors the gul
libility of the German people in their un
derstanding of Hitler.
In Goodbye to Berlin, the spectrum is
broader but the pictures no less pungent.
Isherwood gives us Sally Bowles, a beau
tiful, savvy and rebellious British woman,
the Nowaks, a working class family living
in the slums of Berlin's Hallesches Tor,
and Fraulein Schroeder, the narrator's sen
timental but pragmatic landlady.
Isherwood's characters are vibrant and
full and it comes as little surprise that the
majority are based on the author's own
experience in Berlin during the 19305.
Yet the heavily biographical aspect of
Isherwood's works can be both provocative
and frustrating. On the one hand, the
reader is asked to take a direct interest in
the author/narrator's "real" life. As Isher
wood's biographer Chris Finney comments,
"few other writers . . . invite biographically
informed criticism to the extent that Is
herwood does."
On the other hand, the reader is unmis
takably kept at an insurmountable distance
from the narrator/Isherwood. We are re
peatedly taunted with the illusion of inti
macy — we spend all of our time with this
first-person narrator — and yet half-way
through, we realize with alarm that we
know next to nothing about this person's
thoughts or actions.
Isherwood is the great surpressed void
of his novels. In a brilliant synopsis of the
depression of 1932, Isherwood reflects
events of world significance not through
his own eyes but through those of his
friends and acquaintances.
Under these circumstances, it is not dif
ficult to become obsessed with the role
Isherwood plays in his own novels. Like
an uncertain third party, he hovers oppres
sively nearby as we engage in polite dis
course with his characters.
Later in life, the author himself answers
the great puzzle of Isherwood when he
moves to Santa Monica, California and
publicly announces his homosexuality. He
stridently declares, "For me, Berlin was
boys," and with this statement, many of
the novel's ambiguities fall into place.
But for the public Isherwood of the
19305, Berlin was quite another place. As
W.H. Auden wrote in an unpublished poem
of 1937 about his good friend: "With your
great grey eyes taking everything in/ And
your nicely creased trousers/ Pretending to
be nobody, to be quite humdrum and
harmless/ All the time perfectly aware of
your powers/ You puff-adder/ You sham."

Humdrum and harmless the author may
have appeared; a sham he was not. Isher
wood's novels of Berlin reflect immense
perception and skill. They are a pleasure
to read.

Jorge Luis Borges:
A Literary Biography
Emir Rodriguez Monegal
Paragon, 1988 (paperback printing), $10.95.
In his biography of Jorge Luis Borges,
Emir Monegal constructs a lucid and in
termittently enthralling portrait of a great
and complex literary persona. Although
Monegal succeeds in giving the reader
glimpses of the internal workings of the
mind behind some of the twentieth cen
tury's most interesting fiction, he never
grants us access to the man behind this
mind.
Monegal's work succeeds at fleshing out
Borges'a personal metaphysics and ground
ing his peculiar brand of abstract fiction
in the personal realities of his youth and
life. But without at least a passing ac
quaintance with Borges's own writings,
Monegal's book would undoubtedly seem
picayune and pedantic.
This is no scandal sheet. An exponentially
larger number of pages are devoted to the
Argentine writer's intellectual development
than to his not unlively love life, as Monegal
traces Borges' literary education, almost
literally book by book.
This focus on the specifics of how Borges
fed his voracious appetite for reading, while
occasionally long-winded or tedious, seems
on the whole appropriate. As a very young
boy, Georgie Borges escaped from the in
sularity of his existence by immersing him
self in his father's English library. Ever
since, reading became Borges' most con
suming passion.
Borges' formal innovations stem, in part,
from his profound love of the reading proc
ess. His writing cannot be pigeon holed,
nor easily categorized — a hybrid of con
ceptual fiction and scholarly essay, it blends
genuine erudition with imaginative crea
tion so expertly that the one cannot be
distinguished from the other.
Sometimes Borges accurately quotes
genuine works. Other times he attributes
a created conversation to a real person.
Still other times, he presents what is wholly
fiction as if it were real, writing notes on
and critiques of imaginary books and au
thors.
His story, "The Approach to al-
Mu'tasim," pretends to be a review of a
book published in Bombay. Borges analyzes
the book, carefully pointing out its
strengths and its shortcomings. But in fact,
the book and the author are Borges' own
creations. His self-conscious hoax was quite
successful — one of his friends ordered a
copy of the book from London!
Monegal, whose analysis blends equal
doses of personal biography with literary
criticism, confronts Borges' formal playful
ness, arguing that the author was con
structing "the foundation of a new poetics,
based not on the actual writing of a work
but on its reading."

Monegal explains, "By pretending that a
story has already been told in a published
book, Borges could offer, instead of a retell
ing of a story, a critique of it. . . . By
pretending that the story had already been
invented, Borges again claimed the rights
of a reader, not an author."
In a brilliant parable called "Borges and
I," Borges writes about how he is not the
same as the author Borges:
"The other one, the one called Borges,
is the one things happen to. .. . I live, let
myself go on living, so that Borges may
contrive his literature, and this literature
justifies me."
Ultimately, Monegal's biography is the
story of "Borges," the literary persona,
more than it is the story of the man named
Borges. Monegal is conscious of this em
phasis: He aimed to write "the biography
of the literary oeuvre called Borges."
The book's weakest portions are when
Monegal loses sight of this focus, and at
tempts to link too closely incidents from
Borges' life with Borges fiction. When the
connections between Borges the person and
Borges the writer are reasonably general
— as in his discussions of Borges' life-long
aversion to masks, or his comments on the
effects of Borges' blindness — they are
fascinating and provocative.
It is especially disappointing when a biog
rapher who is conscious that his subject is
the literary oeuvre as much as the man
behind it falls prey to such oversimplifica
tions. Fortunately, such lapses are infre
quent; Monegal's account of that man
Borges called "the other one" is for the
most part, astute and illuminating.

Paragon, 1988 (paperback printing), $10.95.
In his biography of Jorge Luis Borges,
Emir Monegal constructs a lucid and in
termittently enthralling portrait of a great
and complex literary persona. Although
Monegal succeeds in giving the reader
glimpses of the internal workings of the
mind behind some of the twentieth cen
tury's most interesting fiction, he never
grants us access to the man behind this
mind.
Monegal's work succeeds at fleshing out
Borges'a personal metaphysics and ground
ing his peculiar brand of abstract fiction
in the personal realities of his youth and
life. But without at least a passing ac
quaintance with Borges's own writings,
Monegal's book would undoubtedly seem
picayune and pedantic.
This is no scandal sheet. An exponentially
larger number of pages are devoted to the
Argentine writer's intellectual development
than to his not unlively love life, as Monegal
traces Borges' literary education, almost
literally book by book.
This focus on the specifics of how Borges
fed his voracious appetite for reading, while
occasionally long-winded or tedious, seems
on the whole appropriate. As a very young
boy, Georgie Borges escaped from the in
sularity of his existence by immersing him
self in his father's English library. Ever
since, reading became Borges' most con
suming passion.
Borges' formal innovations stem, in part,
from his profound love of the reading proc
ess. His writing cannot be pigeon holed,
nor easily categorized — a hybrid of con
ceptual fiction and scholarly essay, it blends
genuine erudition with imaginative crea
tion so expertly that the one cannot be
distinguished from the other.
Sometimes Borges accurately quotes
genuine works. Other times he attributes
a created conversation to a real person.
Still other times, he presents what is wholly
fiction as if it were real, writing notes on
and critiques of imaginary books and au
thors.
His story, "The Approach to al-
Mu'tasim," pretends to be a review of a
book published in Bombay. Borges analyzes
the book, carefully pointing out its
strengths and its shortcomings. But in fact,
the book and the author are Borges' own
creations. His self-conscious hoax was quite
successful — one of his friends ordered a
copy of the book from London!
Monegal, whose analysis blends equal
doses of personal biography with literary
criticism, confronts Borges' formal playful
ness, arguing that the author was con
structing "the foundation of a new poetics,
based not on the actual writing of a work
but on its reading."

Monegal explains, "By pretending that a
story has already been told in a published
book, Borges could offer, instead of a retell
ing of a story, a critique of it. . . . By
pretending that the story had already been
invented, Borges again claimed the rights
of a reader, not an author."
In a brilliant parable called "Borges and
I," Borges writes about how he is not the
same as the author Borges:
"The other one, the one called Borges,
is the one things happen to. .. . I live, let
myself go on living, so that Borges may
contrive his literature, and this literature
justifies me."
Ultimately, Monegal's biography is the
story of "Borges," the literary persona,
more than it is the story of the man named
Borges. Monegal is conscious of this em
phasis: He aimed to write "the biography
of the literary oeuvre called Borges."
The book's weakest portions are when
Monegal loses sight of this focus, and at
tempts to link too closely incidents from
Borges' life with Borges fiction. When the
connections between Borges the person and
Borges the writer are reasonably general
— as in his discussions of Borges' life-long
aversion to masks, or his comments on the
effects of Borges' blindness — they are
fascinating and provocative.
It is especially disappointing when a biog
rapher who is conscious that his subject is
the literary oeuvre as much as the man
behind it falls prey to such oversimplifica
tions. Fortunately, such lapses are infre
quent; Monegal's account of that man
Borges called "the other one" is for the
most part, astute and illuminating.

Women of the Left Bank
Shari Benstock
University of Texas, 1987, $12.95.
Our image of modernist Paris, city of
romance and artistic inspiration, is shaped
by the experience of expatriate U.S. and
English writers, publishers and artists who
lived on the left bank of Paris from the
turn of the century until 1941. It is an
image from which women writers are
glaringly absent.
Part biography, part history, part
literary criticism, Women of the Left Bank
describes with care and empathy the lives
and works of the women of the "modernist"
left bank culture. They were not only fas
cinating characters, but also perceptive,
dedicated writers, publishers and jour
nalists.
Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, and
H.D., the imagist poet, are probably the
best known of Benstock's subjects.
Through Wharton, who first arrived in
Paris in 1893, Benstock introduces the

reader to the pre-World War One salon
culture of the seventh arrondissement,
where aristocrats and prostitutes mingled
for lively conversation. Closed and often
conservative, this culture was alien to the
bohemian sixth arrondissement where
Stein lived and held her salon.
Benstock provides a juicy, sympathetic
portrait of Stein. She discusses Stein's style
of dress (between monk and earth mother),
her relationship with Alice B. Toklas, her
egotism and the genius of her literary proj
ect, in which she focused on language itself,
rather than the meaning behind language.
Benstock's discussion of Hilda Doolittle
(H.D.) portrays not only the positive but
also the significantly destructive influence
of Ezra Pound.
Women of the Left Bank discusses, and
for many readers introduces, over a dozen
more "women of the written word." Their
claims to fame vary. Sylvia Beach took on
the risky and taxing task of publishing
Joyce's Ulysses in her bookstore, Shake
speare and Company. The bookstore, which
provided a lending library and gathering
place for writers and publishers of the pe
riod, now sits opposite Notre Dame near
rue St. Jacques.
Natalie Barney wrote mainly poetry,
presided over a lively salon and held
Sappho-inspired, women-only evenings of
"Attic abandonment." At one of these
soirees, the French writer Colette — who
performed in nightclubs for a living because
her ex-husband Willy sold the publishing
rights to her successful Claudine novels —
danced nude by the Greek temple in the
backyard. Djuna Barnes, who represented
seductive and destructive beauty, the lonely
Jean Rhys, and Anais Nin wrote fiction
and poetry.
The book may make the streets of Paris,
which can seem forbiddingly sexist, seem
more friendly to present-day American
women, since it traces a history of creative,
independent women living there.
Most of Benstock's subjects, including
Gertrude Stein and H.D., were lesbians, so
they faced in America more constraints on
their life and work than men — or even
straight women — did. The patriarchy not
only discouraged and devalued their con
tributions to literary and intellectual life,
but it also repressed and denied their
sexuality. Benstock quotes Stein as saying,
"It was not what France gave you but
what it did not take away that was impor
tant."
To Benstock's great credit, she does not
lump these women together because of
their shared sexual orientation, but rather

carefully explores the differences that ex
isted in their attitudes, abilities and con
straints. The feminine, mythical lesbianism
of Natalie Barney differed greatly from the
various attitudes of the cigar-smoking
cross-dressers.
Seeking to emphasize the contribution
of these women to modernism, the book
contains perceptive textual analysis, dis
cussing and often rejecting in some mea
sure earlier analyses which defined the
women only in terms of the men they were
involved with and belittled their work.
The book also contains many interesting
tidbits, such as the year in which the word
for heterosexuality came into the French
language (1911).
Benstock quotes Ezra Pound as saying,
"Paris, the paradise of artists irrespective
of their merit or demerit, invites one to
anything but a critical attitude."
No doubt he means this disparagingly.
Yet, it should be used to praise Women of
the Left Bank-, rather than making reduc
tionist pronouncements on what is good
and what is bad, Benstock concentrates on
giving these women their own voice (using
quotes from their work and letters) and
seeks to describe the truth of their lives.
If she must sacrifice a little of the grace
and clarity of her own text, so be it.

The Book and the Brotherhood
Iris Murdoch
Viking, 1987, $19.95.
As steeped in ceremony and as celebrated
in fable as Oxford is, in putting together
this review, I figured it wouldn't be too
hard to find a recent piece of fiction by
which to gauge the modern Oxford exper
ience.
Thomas Hardy and Max Beerbohm are
hard ones to follow, but the task isn't
insurmountable — or so I thought.
The most recent fiction I could find about
the town of dreaming spires is distin
guished, above all, by its obsession with
the gowned set and its hyper-bourgeois
conflicts. Iris Murdoch is a highly respected
writer, but since this, her 23rd novel, is
the only one I've ever read, I find myself
puzzled over what exactly her reputation
is based on.
Her publisher proudly emblazons the
book jacket with lavish accolades: According
to Anthony Burgess the novel "has the
assurance of a writer who has worked long
in the medium." There's even a quote from
Allan Bloom, of Closing-of-the-American-
Mind fame, not about this particular book,
but of Murdoch's oeuvre: "A great novel
could yet come (from Murdoch), rather sur
prisingly in the ... form of the 19th
century realistic novel."
The publisher assures us that this is
precisely the form The Book and the Brot
herhood takes, when it is actually an event
far less stupendous — Murdoch is the vic
tim of unfulfillable Balzacian (if not Prous
tian) aspirations that frequently, in this
novel's 600-plus pages, become pretentious.
The novel's plot rotates about the
agonies of a group of 10 or so former
Oxonians who have come to adulthood un

der the spell of a man named David
Crimond, an egomaniac who combines in
one brain the worst propensities of both
Svengali and Marx.
There is actually very little to speak of
in the storyline itself; in the tradition of
George Eliot and Doris Lessing, Murdoch's
novel assumes that the inner psychological
wranglings of a flock of intellectual in
timates can be enough to label her fiction
magnificent. Unlike the aforementioned au
thors, and presumably unlike this author's
earlier work (to give her the benefit of the
doubt), Murdoch in this novel has had a
hard time convincing us that any of these
characters' movements matter.
Perhaps history will judge me wrong in
this assessment, just as it judged the critics
of War and Peace. But when six characters
are introduced to me in the first two pages,
to no effect, with no seeming purpose, and
things get no better as the novel progresses,
I have to wonder whether Dame M. was
having an off-year when she wrote this
book.
The extent of the novel's scope, after all,
is the purview of no more than a dozen
people, and a dozen unimportant people at
that. Even Chekhov knew that the first
law of fiction was to breathe significance
into your most inconspicuous doorman.
The lackadaisical style of the book,
punctuated as it is not by the courtesy of
commas in subordinate clauses, does not
help.
You will note that I have said next to
nothing about this novel's connection to
the Oxford experience. There is none, un
less you are more than willing to indulge
an already virulent American impression
of Oxford as a cloistered burg of ivory
Continued on next page

towers, snooty pretense and solipsistic pur
suit.
That is merely the face Oxford presents
of itself, because, like any pampered
dowager, it is afraid of meeting the people
who will lift its gorgeous veil and send its
ancient perfumes dissolving into the Cher
well winds.

Berlin Stories
Christopher Isherwood
First published 1935. New Directions,
$6.95.
Literary luminary Gore Vidal calls Is
herwood "the best prose writer in English."
W.H. Auden termed him "a brilliant young
novelist" and "our ambassador to the mad."
While some might protest claims so ex
treme, few would deny that this twentieth
century British author is a writer of ex
traordinary talent.
Isherwood's books reflect an admirable
combination of literary sophistication and
readability. One might compare his great
charm to J.D. Salinger's — except Isher
wood overcomes the self-consciousness that
marks Salinger's work. While Salinger
coaxes the reader to admire his work, Is
herwood — not without arrogance —
merely steps aside to enjoy his due praise.
His prose is polished, perceptive and un
flinchingly controlled.
Although Isherwood has been writing for
five decades, he is best known for the novels
he wrote on Berlin during the 19305: Mr.
Norris Changes Trains and Goodbye to Ber
lin.
These novels are set in pre-World War
II Berlin, a tumultuous time and place
that witnessed the fall of the Weimar Re
public, soaring unemployment, the devas

tating devaluation of the Deutsch Mark
and the rise of Hitler's Nazism.
Against this uneasy background Isher
wood presents the Berliners themselves,
characters who have been immortalized in
the Broadway adaptations "Cabaret" and
"I Am a Camera."
Mr. Norms Changes Trains deftly paints
the portrait of Mr. Arthur Norris, a con
artist who is at once both charming and
sinister, dangerous and childlike. In addi
tion to his intrinsic interest as a character,
he is a convenient source for a parable of
German pre-war politics: By the end of the
book we realize the narrator's naivete in
dealing with Mr. Norris mirrors the gul
libility of the German people in their un
derstanding of Hitler.
In Goodbye to Berlin, the spectrum is
broader but the pictures no less pungent.
Isherwood gives us Sally Bowles, a beau
tiful, savvy and rebellious British woman,
the Nowaks, a working class family living
in the slums of Berlin's Hallesches Tor,
and Fraulein Schroeder, the narrator's sen
timental but pragmatic landlady.
Isherwood's characters are vibrant and
full and it comes as little surprise that the
majority are based on the author's own
experience in Berlin during the 19305.
Yet the heavily biographical aspect of
Isherwood's works can be both provocative
and frustrating. On the one hand, the
reader is asked to take a direct interest in
the author/narrator's "real" life. As Isher
wood's biographer Chris Finney comments,
"few other writers . . . invite biographically
informed criticism to the extent that Is
herwood does."
On the other hand, the reader is unmis
takably kept at an insurmountable distance
from the narrator/Isherwood. We are re
peatedly taunted with the illusion of inti
macy — we spend all of our time with this
first-person narrator — and yet half-way
through, we realize with alarm that we
know next to nothing about this person's
thoughts or actions.
Isherwood is the great surpressed void
of his novels. In a brilliant synopsis of the
depression of 1932, Isherwood reflects
events of world significance not through
his own eyes but through those of his
friends and acquaintances.
Under these circumstances, it is not dif
ficult to become obsessed with the role
Isherwood plays in his own novels. Like
an uncertain third party, he hovers oppres
sively nearby as we engage in polite dis
course with his characters.
Later in life, the author himself answers
the great puzzle of Isherwood when he
moves to Santa Monica, California and
publicly announces his homosexuality. He
stridently declares, "For me, Berlin was
boys," and with this statement, many of
the novel's ambiguities fall into place.
But for the public Isherwood of the
19305, Berlin was quite another place. As
W.H. Auden wrote in an unpublished poem
of 1937 about his good friend: "With your
great grey eyes taking everything in/ And
your nicely creased trousers/ Pretending to
be nobody, to be quite humdrum and
harmless/ All the time perfectly aware of
your powers/ You puff-adder/ You sham."

Humdrum and harmless the author may
have appeared; a sham he was not. Isher
wood's novels of Berlin reflect immense
perception and skill. They are a pleasure
to read.

wood overcomes the self-consciousness that
marks Salinger's work. While Salinger
coaxes the reader to admire his work, Is
herwood — not without arrogance —
merely steps aside to enjoy his due praise.
His prose is polished, perceptive and un
flinchingly controlled.
Although Isherwood has been writing for
five decades, he is best known for the novels
he wrote on Berlin during the 19305: Mr.
Norris Changes Trains and Goodbye to Ber
lin.
These novels are set in pre-World War
II Berlin, a tumultuous time and place
that witnessed the fall of the Weimar Re
public, soaring unemployment, the devas

tating devaluation of the Deutsch Mark
and the rise of Hitler's Nazism.
Against this uneasy background Isher
wood presents the Berliners themselves,
characters who have been immortalized in
the Broadway adaptations "Cabaret" and
"I Am a Camera."
Mr. Norms Changes Trains deftly paints
the portrait of Mr. Arthur Norris, a con
artist who is at once both charming and
sinister, dangerous and childlike. In addi
tion to his intrinsic interest as a character,
he is a convenient source for a parable of
German pre-war politics: By the end of the
book we realize the narrator's naivete in
dealing with Mr. Norris mirrors the gul
libility of the German people in their un
derstanding of Hitler.
In Goodbye to Berlin, the spectrum is
broader but the pictures no less pungent.
Isherwood gives us Sally Bowles, a beau
tiful, savvy and rebellious British woman,
the Nowaks, a working class family living
in the slums of Berlin's Hallesches Tor,
and Fraulein Schroeder, the narrator's sen
timental but pragmatic landlady.
Isherwood's characters are vibrant and
full and it comes as little surprise that the
majority are based on the author's own
experience in Berlin during the 19305.
Yet the heavily biographical aspect of
Isherwood's works can be both provocative
and frustrating. On the one hand, the
reader is asked to take a direct interest in
the author/narrator's "real" life. As Isher
wood's biographer Chris Finney comments,
"few other writers . . . invite biographically
informed criticism to the extent that Is
herwood does."
On the other hand, the reader is unmis
takably kept at an insurmountable distance
from the narrator/Isherwood. We are re
peatedly taunted with the illusion of inti
macy — we spend all of our time with this
first-person narrator — and yet half-way
through, we realize with alarm that we
know next to nothing about this person's
thoughts or actions.
Isherwood is the great surpressed void
of his novels. In a brilliant synopsis of the
depression of 1932, Isherwood reflects
events of world significance not through
his own eyes but through those of his
friends and acquaintances.
Under these circumstances, it is not dif
ficult to become obsessed with the role
Isherwood plays in his own novels. Like
an uncertain third party, he hovers oppres
sively nearby as we engage in polite dis
course with his characters.
Later in life, the author himself answers
the great puzzle of Isherwood when he
moves to Santa Monica, California and
publicly announces his homosexuality. He
stridently declares, "For me, Berlin was
boys," and with this statement, many of
the novel's ambiguities fall into place.
But for the public Isherwood of the
19305, Berlin was quite another place. As
W.H. Auden wrote in an unpublished poem
of 1937 about his good friend: "With your
great grey eyes taking everything in/ And
your nicely creased trousers/ Pretending to
be nobody, to be quite humdrum and
harmless/ All the time perfectly aware of
your powers/ You puff-adder/ You sham."

Humdrum and harmless the author may
have appeared; a sham he was not. Isher
wood's novels of Berlin reflect immense
perception and skill. They are a pleasure
to read.

Jorge Luis Borges:
A Literary Biography
Emir Rodriguez Monegal
Paragon, 1988 (paperback printing), $10.95.
In his biography of Jorge Luis Borges,
Emir Monegal constructs a lucid and in
termittently enthralling portrait of a great
and complex literary persona. Although
Monegal succeeds in giving the reader
glimpses of the internal workings of the
mind behind some of the twentieth cen
tury's most interesting fiction, he never
grants us access to the man behind this
mind.
Monegal's work succeeds at fleshing out
Borges'a personal metaphysics and ground
ing his peculiar brand of abstract fiction
in the personal realities of his youth and
life. But without at least a passing ac
quaintance with Borges's own writings,
Monegal's book would undoubtedly seem
picayune and pedantic.
This is no scandal sheet. An exponentially
larger number of pages are devoted to the
Argentine writer's intellectual development
than to his not unlively love life, as Monegal
traces Borges' literary education, almost
literally book by book.
This focus on the specifics of how Borges
fed his voracious appetite for reading, while
occasionally long-winded or tedious, seems
on the whole appropriate. As a very young
boy, Georgie Borges escaped from the in
sularity of his existence by immersing him
self in his father's English library. Ever
since, reading became Borges' most con
suming passion.
Borges' formal innovations stem, in part,
from his profound love of the reading proc
ess. His writing cannot be pigeon holed,
nor easily categorized — a hybrid of con
ceptual fiction and scholarly essay, it blends
genuine erudition with imaginative crea
tion so expertly that the one cannot be
distinguished from the other.
Sometimes Borges accurately quotes
genuine works. Other times he attributes
a created conversation to a real person.
Still other times, he presents what is wholly
fiction as if it were real, writing notes on
and critiques of imaginary books and au
thors.
His story, "The Approach to al-
Mu'tasim," pretends to be a review of a
book published in Bombay. Borges analyzes
the book, carefully pointing out its
strengths and its shortcomings. But in fact,
the book and the author are Borges' own
creations. His self-conscious hoax was quite
successful — one of his friends ordered a
copy of the book from London!
Monegal, whose analysis blends equal
doses of personal biography with literary
criticism, confronts Borges' formal playful
ness, arguing that the author was con
structing "the foundation of a new poetics,
based not on the actual writing of a work
but on its reading."

Monegal explains, "By pretending that a
story has already been told in a published
book, Borges could offer, instead of a retell
ing of a story, a critique of it. . . . By
pretending that the story had already been
invented, Borges again claimed the rights
of a reader, not an author."
In a brilliant parable called "Borges and
I," Borges writes about how he is not the
same as the author Borges:
"The other one, the one called Borges,
is the one things happen to. .. . I live, let
myself go on living, so that Borges may
contrive his literature, and this literature
justifies me."
Ultimately, Monegal's biography is the
story of "Borges," the literary persona,
more than it is the story of the man named
Borges. Monegal is conscious of this em
phasis: He aimed to write "the biography
of the literary oeuvre called Borges."
The book's weakest portions are when
Monegal loses sight of this focus, and at
tempts to link too closely incidents from
Borges' life with Borges fiction. When the
connections between Borges the person and
Borges the writer are reasonably general
— as in his discussions of Borges' life-long
aversion to masks, or his comments on the
effects of Borges' blindness — they are
fascinating and provocative.
It is especially disappointing when a biog
rapher who is conscious that his subject is
the literary oeuvre as much as the man
behind it falls prey to such oversimplifica
tions. Fortunately, such lapses are infre
quent; Monegal's account of that man
Borges called "the other one" is for the
most part, astute and illuminating.

Women of the Left Bank
Shari Benstock
University of Texas, 1987, $12.95.
Our image of modernist Paris, city of
romance and artistic inspiration, is shaped
by the experience of expatriate U.S. and
English writers, publishers and artists who
lived on the left bank of Paris from the
turn of the century until 1941. It is an
image from which women writers are
glaringly absent.
Part biography, part history, part
literary criticism, Women of the Left Bank
describes with care and empathy the lives
and works of the women of the "modernist"
left bank culture. They were not only fas
cinating characters, but also perceptive,
dedicated writers, publishers and jour
nalists.
Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, and
H.D., the imagist poet, are probably the
best known of Benstock's subjects.
Through Wharton, who first arrived in
Paris in 1893, Benstock introduces the

reader to the pre-World War One salon
culture of the seventh arrondissement,
where aristocrats and prostitutes mingled
for lively conversation. Closed and often
conservative, this culture was alien to the
bohemian sixth arrondissement where
Stein lived and held her salon.
Benstock provides a juicy, sympathetic
portrait of Stein. She discusses Stein's style
of dress (between monk and earth mother),
her relationship with Alice B. Toklas, her
egotism and the genius of her literary proj
ect, in which she focused on language itself,
rather than the meaning behind language.
Benstock's discussion of Hilda Doolittle
(H.D.) portrays not only the positive but
also the significantly destructive influence
of Ezra Pound.
Women of the Left Bank discusses, and
for many readers introduces, over a dozen
more "women of the written word." Their
claims to fame vary. Sylvia Beach took on
the risky and taxing task of publishing
Joyce's Ulysses in her bookstore, Shake
speare and Company. The bookstore, which
provided a lending library and gathering
place for writers and publishers of the pe
riod, now sits opposite Notre Dame near
rue St. Jacques.
Natalie Barney wrote mainly poetry,
presided over a lively salon and held
Sappho-inspired, women-only evenings of
"Attic abandonment." At one of these
soirees, the French writer Colette — who
performed in nightclubs for a living because
her ex-husband Willy sold the publishing
rights to her successful Claudine novels —
danced nude by the Greek temple in the
backyard. Djuna Barnes, who represented
seductive and destructive beauty, the lonely
Jean Rhys, and Anais Nin wrote fiction
and poetry.
The book may make the streets of Paris,
which can seem forbiddingly sexist, seem
more friendly to present-day American
women, since it traces a history of creative,
independent women living there.
Most of Benstock's subjects, including
Gertrude Stein and H.D., were lesbians, so
they faced in America more constraints on
their life and work than men — or even
straight women — did. The patriarchy not
only discouraged and devalued their con
tributions to literary and intellectual life,
but it also repressed and denied their
sexuality. Benstock quotes Stein as saying,
"It was not what France gave you but
what it did not take away that was impor
tant."
To Benstock's great credit, she does not
lump these women together because of
their shared sexual orientation, but rather

carefully explores the differences that ex
isted in their attitudes, abilities and con
straints. The feminine, mythical lesbianism
of Natalie Barney differed greatly from the
various attitudes of the cigar-smoking
cross-dressers.
Seeking to emphasize the contribution
of these women to modernism, the book
contains perceptive textual analysis, dis
cussing and often rejecting in some mea
sure earlier analyses which defined the
women only in terms of the men they were
involved with and belittled their work.
The book also contains many interesting
tidbits, such as the year in which the word
for heterosexuality came into the French
language (1911).
Benstock quotes Ezra Pound as saying,
"Paris, the paradise of artists irrespective
of their merit or demerit, invites one to
anything but a critical attitude."
No doubt he means this disparagingly.
Yet, it should be used to praise Women of
the Left Bank-, rather than making reduc
tionist pronouncements on what is good
and what is bad, Benstock concentrates on
giving these women their own voice (using
quotes from their work and letters) and
seeks to describe the truth of their lives.
If she must sacrifice a little of the grace
and clarity of her own text, so be it.

The Book and the Brotherhood
Iris Murdoch
Viking, 1987, $19.95.
As steeped in ceremony and as celebrated
in fable as Oxford is, in putting together
this review, I figured it wouldn't be too
hard to find a recent piece of fiction by
which to gauge the modern Oxford exper
ience.
Thomas Hardy and Max Beerbohm are
hard ones to follow, but the task isn't
insurmountable — or so I thought.
The most recent fiction I could find about
the town of dreaming spires is distin
guished, above all, by its obsession with
the gowned set and its hyper-bourgeois
conflicts. Iris Murdoch is a highly respected
writer, but since this, her 23rd novel, is
the only one I've ever read, I find myself
puzzled over what exactly her reputation
is based on.
Her publisher proudly emblazons the
book jacket with lavish accolades: According
to Anthony Burgess the novel "has the
assurance of a writer who has worked long
in the medium." There's even a quote from
Allan Bloom, of Closing-of-the-American-
Mind fame, not about this particular book,
but of Murdoch's oeuvre: "A great novel
could yet come (from Murdoch), rather sur
prisingly in the ... form of the 19th
century realistic novel."
The publisher assures us that this is
precisely the form The Book and the Brot
herhood takes, when it is actually an event
far less stupendous — Murdoch is the vic
tim of unfulfillable Balzacian (if not Prous
tian) aspirations that frequently, in this
novel's 600-plus pages, become pretentious.
The novel's plot rotates about the
agonies of a group of 10 or so former
Oxonians who have come to adulthood un

der the spell of a man named David
Crimond, an egomaniac who combines in
one brain the worst propensities of both
Svengali and Marx.
There is actually very little to speak of
in the storyline itself; in the tradition of
George Eliot and Doris Lessing, Murdoch's
novel assumes that the inner psychological
wranglings of a flock of intellectual in
timates can be enough to label her fiction
magnificent. Unlike the aforementioned au
thors, and presumably unlike this author's
earlier work (to give her the benefit of the
doubt), Murdoch in this novel has had a
hard time convincing us that any of these
characters' movements matter.
Perhaps history will judge me wrong in
this assessment, just as it judged the critics
of War and Peace. But when six characters
are introduced to me in the first two pages,
to no effect, with no seeming purpose, and
things get no better as the novel progresses,
I have to wonder whether Dame M. was
having an off-year when she wrote this
book.
The extent of the novel's scope, after all,
is the purview of no more than a dozen
people, and a dozen unimportant people at
that. Even Chekhov knew that the first
law of fiction was to breathe significance
into your most inconspicuous doorman.
The lackadaisical style of the book,
punctuated as it is not by the courtesy of
commas in subordinate clauses, does not
help.
You will note that I have said next to
nothing about this novel's connection to
the Oxford experience. There is none, un
less you are more than willing to indulge
an already virulent American impression
of Oxford as a cloistered burg of ivory
Continued on next page

towers, snooty pretense and solipsistic pur
suit.
That is merely the face Oxford presents
of itself, because, like any pampered
dowager, it is afraid of meeting the people
who will lift its gorgeous veil and send its
ancient perfumes dissolving into the Cher
well winds.

Berlin Stories
Christopher Isherwood
First published 1935. New Directions,
$6.95.
Literary luminary Gore Vidal calls Is
herwood "the best prose writer in English."
W.H. Auden termed him "a brilliant young
novelist" and "our ambassador to the mad."
While some might protest claims so ex
treme, few would deny that this twentieth
century British author is a writer of ex
traordinary talent.
Isherwood's books reflect an admirable
combination of literary sophistication and
readability. One might compare his great
charm to J.D. Salinger's — except Isher
wood overcomes the self-consciousness that
marks Salinger's work. While Salinger
coaxes the reader to admire his work, Is
herwood — not without arrogance —
merely steps aside to enjoy his due praise.
His prose is polished, perceptive and un
flinchingly controlled.
Although Isherwood has been writing for

These novels are set in pre-World War

tating devaluation of the Deutsch Mark
and the rise of Hitler's Nazism.
Against this uneasy background Isher

the Broadway adaptations "Cabaret" and
"I Am a Camera."
Mr. Norms Changes Trains deftly paints
the portrait of Mr. Arthur Norris, a con
artist who is at once both charming and
sinister, dangerous and childlike. In addi
tion to his intrinsic interest as a character,
he is a convenient source for a parable of
German pre-war politics: By the end of the
book we realize the narrator's naivete in
dealing with Mr. Norris mirrors the gul
libility of the German people in their un

In Goodbye to Berlin, the spectrum is

in fable as Oxford is, in putting together
this review, I figured it wouldn't be too
hard to find a recent piece of fiction by
which to gauge the modern Oxford exper
ience.
Thomas Hardy and Max Beerbohm are
hard ones to follow, but the task isn't
insurmountable — or so I thought.
The most recent fiction I could find about
the town of dreaming spires is distin
guished, above all, by its obsession with
the gowned set and its hyper-bourgeois
conflicts. Iris Murdoch is a highly respected
writer, but since this, her 23rd novel, is
the only one I've ever read, I find myself
puzzled over what exactly her reputation
is based on.
Her publisher proudly emblazons the
book jacket with lavish accolades: According
to Anthony Burgess the novel "has the
assurance of a writer who has worked long
in the medium." There's even a quote from
Allan Bloom, of Closing-of-the-American-
Mind fame, not about this particular book,
but of Murdoch's oeuvre: "A great novel
could yet come (from Murdoch), rather sur
prisingly in the ... form of the 19th
century realistic novel."
The publisher assures us that this is
precisely the form The Book and the Brot
herhood takes, when it is actually an event
far less stupendous — Murdoch is the vic
tim of unfulfillable Balzacian (if not Prous
tian) aspirations that frequently, in this
novel's 600-plus pages, become pretentious.
The novel's plot rotates about the
agonies of a group of 10 or so former
Oxonians who have come to adulthood un

der the spell of a man named David
Crimond, an egomaniac who combines in
one brain the worst propensities of both
Svengali and Marx.
There is actually very little to speak of
in the storyline itself; in the tradition of
George Eliot and Doris Lessing, Murdoch's
novel assumes that the inner psychological
wranglings of a flock of intellectual in
timates can be enough to label her fiction
magnificent. Unlike the aforementioned au
thors, and presumably unlike this author's
earlier work (to give her the benefit of the
doubt), Murdoch in this novel has had a
hard time convincing us that any of these
characters' movements matter.
Perhaps history will judge me wrong in
this assessment, just as it judged the critics
of War and Peace. But when six characters
are introduced to me in the first two pages,
to no effect, with no seeming purpose, and
things get no better as the novel progresses,
I have to wonder whether Dame M. was
having an off-year when she wrote this
book.
The extent of the novel's scope, after all,
is the purview of no more than a dozen
people, and a dozen unimportant people at
that. Even Chekhov knew that the first
law of fiction was to breathe significance
into your most inconspicuous doorman.
The lackadaisical style of the book,
punctuated as it is not by the courtesy of
commas in subordinate clauses, does not
help.
You will note that I have said next to
nothing about this novel's connection to
the Oxford experience. There is none, un
less you are more than willing to indulge
an already virulent American impression
of Oxford as a cloistered burg of ivory

towers, snooty pretense and solipsistic pur
suit.
That is merely the face Oxford presents
of itself, because, like any pampered
dowager, it is afraid of meeting the people
who will lift its gorgeous veil and send its
ancient perfumes dissolving into the Cher
well winds.

Berlin Stories
Christopher Isherwood
First published 1935. New Directions,
$6.95.
Literary luminary Gore Vidal calls Is
herwood "the best prose writer in English."
W.H. Auden termed him "a brilliant young
novelist" and "our ambassador to the mad."
While some might protest claims so ex
treme, few would deny that this twentieth
century British author is a writer of ex
traordinary talent.
Isherwood's books reflect an admirable
combination of literary sophistication and
readability. One might compare his great
charm to J.D. Salinger's — except Isher
wood overcomes the self-consciousness that
marks Salinger's work. While Salinger
coaxes the reader to admire his work, Is
herwood — not without arrogance —
merely steps aside to enjoy his due praise.
His prose is polished, perceptive and un
flinchingly controlled.
Although Isherwood has been writing for
five decades, he is best known for the novels
he wrote on Berlin during the 19305: Mr.
Norris Changes Trains and Goodbye to Ber
lin.
These novels are set in pre-World War
II Berlin, a tumultuous time and place
that witnessed the fall of the Weimar Re
public, soaring unemployment, the devas

tating devaluation of the Deutsch Mark
and the rise of Hitler's Nazism.
Against this uneasy background Isher
wood presents the Berliners themselves,
characters who have been immortalized in
the Broadway adaptations "Cabaret" and
"I Am a Camera."
Mr. Norms Changes Trains deftly paints
the portrait of Mr. Arthur Norris, a con
artist who is at once both charming and
sinister, dangerous and childlike. In addi
tion to his intrinsic interest as a character,
he is a convenient source for a parable of
German pre-war politics: By the end of the
book we realize the narrator's naivete in
dealing with Mr. Norris mirrors the gul
libility of the German people in their un
derstanding of Hitler.
In Goodbye to Berlin, the spectrum is
broader but the pictures no less pungent.
Isherwood gives us Sally Bowles, a beau
tiful, savvy and rebellious British woman,
the Nowaks, a working class family living
in the slums of Berlin's Hallesches Tor,
and Fraulein Schroeder, the narrator's sen
timental but pragmatic landlady.
Isherwood's characters are vibrant and
full and it comes as little surprise that the
majority are based on the author's own
experience in Berlin during the 19305.
Yet the heavily biographical aspect of
Isherwood's works can be both provocative
and frustrating. On the one hand, the
reader is asked to take a direct interest in
the author/narrator's "real" life. As Isher
wood's biographer Chris Finney comments,
"few other writers . . . invite biographically
informed criticism to the extent that Is
herwood does."
On the other hand, the reader is unmis
takably kept at an insurmountable distance
from the narrator/Isherwood. We are re
peatedly taunted with the illusion of inti
macy — we spend all of our time with this
first-person narrator — and yet half-way
through, we realize with alarm that we
know next to nothing about this person's
thoughts or actions.
Isherwood is the great surpressed void
of his novels. In a brilliant synopsis of the
depression of 1932, Isherwood reflects
events of world significance not through
his own eyes but through those of his
friends and acquaintances.
Under these circumstances, it is not dif
ficult to become obsessed with the role
Isherwood plays in his own novels. Like
an uncertain third party, he hovers oppres
sively nearby as we engage in polite dis
course with his characters.
Later in life, the author himself answers
the great puzzle of Isherwood when he
moves to Santa Monica, California and
publicly announces his homosexuality. He
stridently declares, "For me, Berlin was
boys," and with this statement, many of
the novel's ambiguities fall into place.
But for the public Isherwood of the
19305, Berlin was quite another place. As
W.H. Auden wrote in an unpublished poem
of 1937 about his good friend: "With your
great grey eyes taking everything in/ And
your nicely creased trousers/ Pretending to
be nobody, to be quite humdrum and
harmless/ All the time perfectly aware of
your powers/ You puff-adder/ You sham."

Humdrum and harmless the author may
have appeared; a sham he was not. Isher
wood's novels of Berlin reflect immense
perception and skill. They are a pleasure
to read.

Jorge Luis Borges:
A Literary Biography
Emir Rodriguez Monegal
Paragon, 1988 (paperback printing), $10.95.
In his biography of Jorge Luis Borges,
Emir Monegal constructs a lucid and in
termittently enthralling portrait of a great
and complex literary persona. Although
Monegal succeeds in giving the reader
glimpses of the internal workings of the
mind behind some of the twentieth cen
tury's most interesting fiction, he never
grants us access to the man behind this
mind.
Monegal's work succeeds at fleshing out
Borges'a personal metaphysics and ground
ing his peculiar brand of abstract fiction
in the personal realities of his youth and
life. But without at least a passing ac
quaintance with Borges's own writings,
Monegal's book would undoubtedly seem
picayune and pedantic.
This is no scandal sheet. An exponentially
larger number of pages are devoted to the
Argentine writer's intellectual development
than to his not unlively love life, as Monegal
traces Borges' literary education, almost
literally book by book.
This focus on the specifics of how Borges
fed his voracious appetite for reading, while
occasionally long-winded or tedious, seems
on the whole appropriate. As a very young
boy, Georgie Borges escaped from the in
sularity of his existence by immersing him
self in his father's English library. Ever
since, reading became Borges' most con
suming passion.
Borges' formal innovations stem, in part,
from his profound love of the reading proc
ess. His writing cannot be pigeon holed,
nor easily categorized — a hybrid of con
ceptual fiction and scholarly essay, it blends
genuine erudition with imaginative crea
tion so expertly that the one cannot be
distinguished from the other.
Sometimes Borges accurately quotes
genuine works. Other times he attributes
a created conversation to a real person.
Still other times, he presents what is wholly
fiction as if it were real, writing notes on
and critiques of imaginary books and au
thors.
His story, "The Approach to al-
Mu'tasim," pretends to be a review of a
book published in Bombay. Borges analyzes
the book, carefully pointing out its
strengths and its shortcomings. But in fact,
the book and the author are Borges' own
creations. His self-conscious hoax was quite
successful — one of his friends ordered a
copy of the book from London!
Monegal, whose analysis blends equal
doses of personal biography with literary
criticism, confronts Borges' formal playful
ness, arguing that the author was con
structing "the foundation of a new poetics,
based not on the actual writing of a work
but on its reading."

Monegal explains, "By pretending that a
story has already been told in a published
book, Borges could offer, instead of a retell
ing of a story, a critique of it. . . . By
pretending that the story had already been
invented, Borges again claimed the rights
of a reader, not an author."
In a brilliant parable called "Borges and
I," Borges writes about how he is not the
same as the author Borges:
"The other one, the one called Borges,
is the one things happen to. .. . I live, let
myself go on living, so that Borges may
contrive his literature, and this literature
justifies me."
Ultimately, Monegal's biography is the
story of "Borges," the literary persona,
more than it is the story of the man named
Borges. Monegal is conscious of this em
phasis: He aimed to write "the biography
of the literary oeuvre called Borges."
The book's weakest portions are when
Monegal loses sight of this focus, and at
tempts to link too closely incidents from
Borges' life with Borges fiction. When the
connections between Borges the person and
Borges the writer are reasonably general
— as in his discussions of Borges' life-long
aversion to masks, or his comments on the
effects of Borges' blindness — they are
fascinating and provocative.
It is especially disappointing when a biog
rapher who is conscious that his subject is
the literary oeuvre as much as the man
behind it falls prey to such oversimplifica
tions. Fortunately, such lapses are infre
quent; Monegal's account of that man
Borges called "the other one" is for the
most part, astute and illuminating.

Women of the Left Bank
Shari Benstock
University of Texas, 1987, $12.95.
Our image of modernist Paris, city of
romance and artistic inspiration, is shaped
by the experience of expatriate U.S. and
English writers, publishers and artists who
lived on the left bank of Paris from the
turn of the century until 1941. It is an
image from which women writers are
glaringly absent.
Part biography, part history, part
literary criticism, Women of the Left Bank
describes with care and empathy the lives
and works of the women of the "modernist"
left bank culture. They were not only fas
cinating characters, but also perceptive,
dedicated writers, publishers and jour
nalists.
Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, and
H.D., the imagist poet, are probably the
best known of Benstock's subjects.
Through Wharton, who first arrived in
Paris in 1893, Benstock introduces the

reader to the pre-World War One salon
culture of the seventh arrondissement,
where aristocrats and prostitutes mingled
for lively conversation. Closed and often
conservative, this culture was alien to the
bohemian sixth arrondissement where
Stein lived and held her salon.
Benstock provides a juicy, sympathetic
portrait of Stein. She discusses Stein's style
of dress (between monk and earth mother),
her relationship with Alice B. Toklas, her
egotism and the genius of her literary proj
ect, in which she focused on language itself,
rather than the meaning behind language.
Benstock's discussion of Hilda Doolittle
(H.D.) portrays not only the positive but
also the significantly destructive influence
of Ezra Pound.
Women of the Left Bank discusses, and
for many readers introduces, over a dozen
more "women of the written word." Their
claims to fame vary. Sylvia Beach took on
the risky and taxing task of publishing
Joyce's Ulysses in her bookstore, Shake
speare and Company. The bookstore, which
provided a lending library and gathering
place for writers and publishers of the pe
riod, now sits opposite Notre Dame near
rue St. Jacques.
Natalie Barney wrote mainly poetry,
presided over a lively salon and held
Sappho-inspired, women-only evenings of
"Attic abandonment." At one of these
soirees, the French writer Colette — who
performed in nightclubs for a living because
her ex-husband Willy sold the publishing
rights to her successful Claudine novels —
danced nude by the Greek temple in the
backyard. Djuna Barnes, who represented
seductive and destructive beauty, the lonely
Jean Rhys, and Anais Nin wrote fiction
and poetry.
The book may make the streets of Paris,
which can seem forbiddingly sexist, seem
more friendly to present-day American
women, since it traces a history of creative,
independent women living there.
Most of Benstock's subjects, including
Gertrude Stein and H.D., were lesbians, so
they faced in America more constraints on
their life and work than men — or even
straight women — did. The patriarchy not
only discouraged and devalued their con
tributions to literary and intellectual life,
but it also repressed and denied their
sexuality. Benstock quotes Stein as saying,
"It was not what France gave you but
what it did not take away that was impor
tant."
To Benstock's great credit, she does not
lump these women together because of
their shared sexual orientation, but rather

carefully explores the differences that ex
isted in their attitudes, abilities and con
straints. The feminine, mythical lesbianism
of Natalie Barney differed greatly from the
various attitudes of the cigar-smoking
cross-dressers.
Seeking to emphasize the contribution
of these women to modernism, the book
contains perceptive textual analysis, dis
cussing and often rejecting in some mea
sure earlier analyses which defined the
women only in terms of the men they were
involved with and belittled their work.
The book also contains many interesting
tidbits, such as the year in which the word
for heterosexuality came into the French
language (1911).
Benstock quotes Ezra Pound as saying,
"Paris, the paradise of artists irrespective
of their merit or demerit, invites one to
anything but a critical attitude."
No doubt he means this disparagingly.
Yet, it should be used to praise Women of
the Left Bank-, rather than making reduc
tionist pronouncements on what is good
and what is bad, Benstock concentrates on
giving these women their own voice (using
quotes from their work and letters) and
seeks to describe the truth of their lives.
If she must sacrifice a little of the grace
and clarity of her own text, so be it.
