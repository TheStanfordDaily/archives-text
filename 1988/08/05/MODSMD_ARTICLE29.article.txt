## Diversions 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
In some sort of unofficial, uncoordinated stage fest, almost
every theatre group in the Bay Area seems to be heading into
the limelight this weekend, much to the delight of drama en
thusiasts everywhere. Why, aficionados from all over the globe
are boarding their jets right now and heading for SFO, eager
to experience the artistic extravaganza . . . well, not really, but
you get the picture.
Quick, don't miss out
Unbeknownst to many, some of the best drama around has
been enacted for weeks right here on the Farm by the Stanford
Summer Theater. Performing a rotating schedule of plays by
Beckett, Brecht, Mamet and Wilder, the ensemble has creatively
infused life and energy into nine fascinating productions.
But all good things must come to an end, the cliche goes, and
so the thespians bring the season to a close today and tomorrow.
Noon today brings a doubleheader by Beckett, "Rockaby" and
"Not I," a great way to pass your lunch hour. The ticket price
is only $1 at the Nitery door and they let you bring your lunch,
so you have no reason to evade the cultural experience.
If you prefer your drama after dark, the Summer Theater
happily obliges with a pair by Wilder tonight (the exquisite
"Pullman Car Hiawatha" and "Happy Journey") and two by
Brecht on Saturday ("The Jewish Wife" and"The Exception
and the Rule"). The curtain rises at 8 pm.
Berkeley's jammin', mon!
Especially for the fan of great reggae, however, some tough
competition for your Friday festivities comes from The Omni
in Oakland (actually, it is closer to Cal than to Oakland, but
far be it from me to deny them the dubious prestige of their
chosen mailing address).
Hitting the stage tonight is a
thrilling triple header: Burning
Spear (billed as a "reggae giant"
and well worth the acclaim), Mes
senjah (Canada's premier reggae
band) and Lambsbread (your
guess is as good as mine). The
doors open at 8:30 p.m., but get
there early for this one — and,
for heavens sake, head off to Bass
and get your ticket in advance,
or risk a most unpleasant 40 min
ute drive back across the Bay at
8:35 p.m. with the other procras
tinators.
There's no place like home
As one group's efforts wind to
a close, another Stanford troupe
begins performing later this week.
The Stanford Actors Project's pro
duction of "A Streetcar Named
Desire" opens Wednesday for a
two-and-one-half week stint, Wed

nesday through Sunday evenings
until August 28 at 8 p.m. in the
Little Theatre (the intimate
playhouse inconspicuously at
tached to the side of Mem Aud).
Pull out the Birkenstocks
Rivalling the "Desire" debut is
the latest presentation of the ac
claimed San Francisco Mime
Troupe, a group that has been
entertaining audiences for 29
years with its unique brand of
humor.
The show this time around is
"Hipped Van Winkle," a fresh, in
novative rehashing of the classic
tale that sets Rip as a hippie in
the '60s who, after an LSD
induced hibernation, finds himself
in the San Francisco of 1988 —
culture shock doesn't get much
more severe than this. The result
is a charming and amusing show.
The troupe will only perform
two shows in Palo Alto, Wednes
day and Thursday nights at 8 p.m.
in the social hall of the Wesley
United Methodist Church.
