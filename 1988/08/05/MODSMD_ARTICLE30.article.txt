The Pelican Inn
Muir Beach at Highwav 1
383-6000
We were thinking of that poet Shakespeare, and
his England, on our way through the Marin head
lands and Muir Woods to the Pelican Inn. "This
scept'red isle . . . this other Eden, demi-paradise . . .
this precious stone set in the silver sea . .. this
blessed plot, this earth, this realm ..." — this
English pub nestled on the Pacific strand.
The Pelican, a gracious Tudor-styled country inn,

restaurant and pub, takes its name from Sir Francis
Drake's exploring vessel (the boat was later re
named The Golden Hinde) which landed on the
Marin coast over four centuries ago. Drake claimed
California for Queen Elizabeth I, and today a part
of England still reigns on its shores.
Inside the Pelican, one can find hearty English
dishes (such as cottage pie, beef Wellington, rack
of lamb and Yorkshire pudding) and wash this fare
down with bar offerings that range from Watneys,
Bass, Newcastle Brown and Guinness stout to tradi
tional British specialties like cider, Snakebites and
Black and Tans. A bit of America sneaks onto the
menu, however, as fresh fish and California wines
complete the Pelican's cuisine.
The Pelican serves pub lunches Tuesday through
Saturday, a Sunday lunch buffet and dinner Tuesday
through Sunday. The bar is open pub hours (11 to
11) Tuesday through Sunday.
We went on a Friday evening, and enjoyed a meal
of overwhelming portions. Dinners at the Pelican
include a soup or salad — we both had an out
standing clam chowder — and entrees are typically
accompanied by potatoes and several kinds of
vegetables. Our prime rib and Devonshire chicken
were big winners for dinner, and we shared a slice
of the delicious chocolate and orange tort for dessert,
one of the five home-baked treats offered that night.
The food was excellent, the service was outgoing
and friendly, but much of the charm of dining at
the Pelican is in the surroundings themselves. We
spoke to manager Barry Stock about the history of
the Inn, and heard of the tireless labors of the
original builders, Charles and Brenda Felix, as they
assembled the antiques, prints, Tudor windows,
mugs and glasses, woodwork and requisite dartboard
demanded by undertaking the project of erecting
an English pub in California.
They conceived their dream in the late 19605,
and not until 1979 did the Pelican open for business.
1 heir vision has translated into a romantic and cozy
dining atmosphere, with dark wood tables, red
candles and fireplaces. The two dining rooms, one
an interior parlor, the other an outdoor patio, were

built with attention to English
cultural heritage.
Outside the Pelican, a
landscaped garden bursts with
flowers (they remind these
reviewers of more than a few Eng
lish sonnets), and down the road

Muir Beach waves crash onto the
shore. With the great redwood
reserves nearby, as well as the
long stretches of Highway l's cur
ving brilliance, the Pelican is truly
surrounded by the best of Marin's
outdoor gifts.
Give yourself an afternoon for
California, for England and the
Pelican, and raise your cup to the
Queen.
