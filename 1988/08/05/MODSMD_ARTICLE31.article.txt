Any moviegoer who has seen Charles
Grodin knows to expect a hysterical per
formance in almost any movie he is fea
tured in. A master of deadpan delivery,
Grodin has been brightening television and
film for decades.
Even the biggest fan, however, would
probably not expect the comic genius that
has lay dormant inside Robert DeNiro, one
of the greatest method actors in movie
history. Sure, he has played some charac
ters with a penchant for humor (most re
cently, A 1 Capone in"The Untouchables."),
but never before has DeNiro assumed the
lead role in a fast-paced, all-out comedy.
"Midnight Run" is well worth the wait.
Pairing DeNiro and Grodin amidst a cast
of talented all-stars, this film may be one
of the hest comedy-adventures to hit the
hig screen in a long time. The film is
lengthy, but every single minute is pure
cinematic heaven.
DeNiro plays bounty hunter Jack Walsh,
a former Chicago police officer who, unlike
most of his peers, refused to "go on the
payroll" of the local mafioso. When he's
offered $100,000 by an antsy L.A. bail
bondsman to collar Jonathan Mardukas
(Grodin), an innocuous accountant who has
embezzled $15 million from the said un
derworld leader and donated it to charity,
Walsh finds himself on the pursued end of
a cross-country foxhunt by the FBI. the
gangster's thugs and a competing bounty
hunter (amusingly played by John Ashtop
of "Beverly Hills Cop" fame).
The whole affair yields a seemingly un
ending barrage of action and comedy.
DeNiro and Grodin add new life to the
"Odd Couple" routine, carrying on
throughout the entire adventure and play
ing off of each other's one-liners. The pair
has comic chemistry, and director/producer

Martin Brest ("Beverly Hills Cop") makes
the most of it.
Kudos are also due supporting stars Yap
het Kotto and Dennis Farina. Making a
180-degree switch from his mob-buster role
in the TV show "Crime Story," Farina
plays the fiery mafioso with style and poise,
while Kotto enhances the whole production
with his intense portrayal of frustrated FBI
agent Alphonso Mosley.
If a scenic trip across America high
lighted by a little gunplay and a lot of
humor sounds enticing, toss aside the bullet
proof vest and Amtrak ticket and catch
"Midnight Run" instead. Your tickled
funny bone will be glad you did.

"A Handful of Dust"
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson
I'alo Alto
In the idyllic English countryside, Tony
and Brenda Last lead a quiet married life.
Only the scenery, however, is truly restive
in the Stagescreen production of "A Hand
ful of Dust," based on the novel by Evelyn
Waugh, in which director Charles Sturridge
("Brideshead Revisited") admirably cap
tures the tension that builds as an appar
ently happy marriage crumbles.
It is 1932 and times are easy at Hetton
Abbey, the Last's huge (and hideous) Vic
torian ancestral home. James Wilby

("Maurice") plays Tony Last, a good
natured, if rather dull, young squire ded
icated to his wife, young son and Hetton.
Kristin Scott Thomas plays the charming
Lady Brenda Last, the lovely but lively
wife who is not sure that she loves life in
the country. When Tony inadvertently in
vites the penniless, young socialite John
Beaver (played by Rupert Graves of "A
Room With a View") to Hetton, Brenda
acknowledges her boredom. The chance ar
rival of this man-about-town wrecks the
peaceful existence of the Lasts.
When Brenda confesses her desire for a
flat in London, Beaver and his scheming
mother (Judi Dench) find one for her. As
Brenda spends less and less time at Hetton
she spends more and more time with Bea
ver — always a willing escort. Lady
Brenda's wealth makes her decidedly at
tractive to the "eager Beaver."
As Brenda dashes about town, Tony ab
sorbs himself with life at Hetton until dis
aster strikes. His son, riding for the first
time with the local hunt, is thrown from
his pony and killed. Instead of bringing
Tony and Brenda closer together, the death
"frees" Brenda from Hetton — she tells
the disbelieving Tony that she is leaving
him for Beaver.
Brenda is constantly blinded by her emo
tions — she hastily throws her marriage
away without realizing that Beaver only
wants her money. Unfortunately, no one
wakes her up to this fact.
When Brenda requests increased alimony
settlements in order to "keep" Beaver, Tony
finally (to the relief of the audience) draws
the line. He cancels the divorce proceedings
and sails for South America as the film
winds down to its curious ending.
None of the characters in "A Handful
of Dust" is very likeable and there is never
anyone for whom the audience can root.
Rather, we find ourselves applauding the
actors who so convincingly portray these
troubled people and show that beautiful
