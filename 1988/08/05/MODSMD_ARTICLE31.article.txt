"Midnight Run"
Century Cinema 10

Any moviegoer who has seen Charles
Grodin knows to expect a hysterical per
formance in almost any movie he is fea
tured in. A master of deadpan delivery,
Grodin has been brightening television and
film for decades.
Even the biggest fan, however, would
probably not expect the comic genius that
has lay dormant inside Robert DeNiro, one
of the greatest method actors in movie
history. Sure, he has played some charac
ters with a penchant for humor (most re
cently, A 1 Capone in"The Untouchables."),
but never before has DeNiro assumed the
lead role in a fast-paced, all-out comedy.
"Midnight Run" is well worth the wait.
Pairing DeNiro and Grodin amidst a cast
of talented all-stars, this film may be one
of the hest comedy-adventures to hit the
hig screen in a long time. The film is
lengthy, but every single minute is pure
cinematic heaven.
DeNiro plays bounty hunter Jack Walsh,
a former Chicago police officer who, unlike
most of his peers, refused to "go on the
payroll" of the local mafioso. When he's
offered $100,000 by an antsy L.A. bail
bondsman to collar Jonathan Mardukas
(Grodin), an innocuous accountant who has
embezzled $15 million from the said un
derworld leader and donated it to charity,
Walsh finds himself on the pursued end of
a cross-country foxhunt by the FBI. the
gangster's thugs and a competing bounty
hunter (amusingly played by John Ashtop
of "Beverly Hills Cop" fame).
The whole affair yields a seemingly un
ending barrage of action and comedy.
DeNiro and Grodin add new life to the
"Odd Couple" routine, carrying on
throughout the entire adventure and play
ing off of each other's one-liners. The pair
has comic chemistry, and director/producer

Martin Brest ("Beverly Hills Cop") makes
the most of it.
Kudos are also due supporting stars Yap
het Kotto and Dennis Farina. Making a
180-degree switch from his mob-buster role
in the TV show "Crime Story," Farina
plays the fiery mafioso with style and poise,
while Kotto enhances the whole production
with his intense portrayal of frustrated FBI
agent Alphonso Mosley.
If a scenic trip across America high
lighted by a little gunplay and a lot of
humor sounds enticing, toss aside the bullet
proof vest and Amtrak ticket and catch
"Midnight Run" instead. Your tickled
funny bone will be glad you did.

"A Handful of Dust"
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson
I'alo Alto
In the idyllic English countryside, Tony
and Brenda Last lead a quiet married life.
Only the scenery, however, is truly restive
in the Stagescreen production of "A Hand
ful of Dust," based on the novel by Evelyn
Waugh, in which director Charles Sturridge
("Brideshead Revisited") admirably cap
tures the tension that builds as an appar
ently happy marriage crumbles.
It is 1932 and times are easy at Hetton
Abbey, the Last's huge (and hideous) Vic
torian ancestral home. James Wilby

("Maurice") plays Tony Last, a good
natured, if rather dull, young squire ded
icated to his wife, young son and Hetton.
Kristin Scott Thomas plays the charming
Lady Brenda Last, the lovely but lively
wife who is not sure that she loves life in
the country. When Tony inadvertently in
vites the penniless, young socialite John
Beaver (played by Rupert Graves of "A
Room With a View") to Hetton, Brenda
acknowledges her boredom. The chance ar
rival of this man-about-town wrecks the
peaceful existence of the Lasts.
When Brenda confesses her desire for a
flat in London, Beaver and his scheming
mother (Judi Dench) find one for her. As
Brenda spends less and less time at Hetton
she spends more and more time with Bea
ver — always a willing escort. Lady
Brenda's wealth makes her decidedly at
tractive to the "eager Beaver."
As Brenda dashes about town, Tony ab
sorbs himself with life at Hetton until dis
aster strikes. His son, riding for the first
time with the local hunt, is thrown from
his pony and killed. Instead of bringing
Tony and Brenda closer together, the death
"frees" Brenda from Hetton — she tells
the disbelieving Tony that she is leaving
him for Beaver.
Brenda is constantly blinded by her emo
tions — she hastily throws her marriage
away without realizing that Beaver only
wants her money. Unfortunately, no one
wakes her up to this fact.
When Brenda requests increased alimony
settlements in order to "keep" Beaver, Tony
finally (to the relief of the audience) draws
the line. He cancels the divorce proceedings
and sails for South America as the film
winds down to its curious ending.
None of the characters in "A Handful
of Dust" is very likeable and there is never
anyone for whom the audience can root.
Rather, we find ourselves applauding the
actors who so convincingly portray these
troubled people and show that beautiful

lives have submerged flaws. If the
heartless Brenda weren't so
charming, she would be an un
bearable wretch.
Despite the rather unsettling
effects of the film, it is nonethe
less very satisfying. Aesthetically
pleasing and well-acted, "A Hand
ful of Dust" works — the story
is engaging. . . and disquieting.

"A Fish Called Wanda"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
At last, a movie starring Monty
Python greats John Cleese and
Michael Palin that takes place en
tirely in this decade, and doesn't
involve messiahs, medieval
minstrels or musings on the
meaning of life.
Not only that, but the movie
in which they're presently madly
running about, "A Fish Called
Wanda," departs from the typical
dryness of Pythonesque humor
(which, after extended exposure,
usually leaves one with a desire
to suck up the entire Atlantic).
No head-scratching or delayed
laughter here, only two hours of
unremitting fun.
Since it's the least important
aspect of the film, let's deal with
the plot first. Ken (Palin), Wanda

(Jamie Lee Curtis), Otto (Kevin
Kline), and George (Tom Geor
geson) steal $13 million in
diamonds from a London bank.
After the heist, Wanda and Otto
betray George to the police, hoping
to keep the jewels for themselves.
But George has hidden the
jewels, frustrating his two
traitorous accomplices. The rest
of the movie is a manic scramble
by Wanda, Otto, Ken and finally
Cleese's character Archibald
Leech (Cary Grant's real name by
the way) to beat each other to
the stones' hiding place, jump on
a plane to Rio and have the last,
malicious little laugh.
Along the way there's much
merriment to be had with Cleese's
Anglo-bashing, Kline's goldfish
swallowing and Curtis' strategic
cleavage-baring.
Nothing terribly new, you say,
and rightly so. What is new,
though, is the eclectic combina
tion of this quartet's talents to
create superlative comedy. Cleese
plays a prominent London bar
rister sucked into all this treac
hery. As usual, Cleese deftly blurs
the line between straight-man and
comedian, leading you to think
he's being made fun of until with
one or two words, a clearing of
the throat and a slight smirk he
lets you know just who the fool is.
As for Jamie Lee Curtis, a cou
ple of adjectives spring to mind
. . . but I'll ignore them for some
thing not censorable. She's the
most cunning and crafty of the
entire crew, winding up the males

with her are-you-man-enough
grin, then stepping aside to let
them charge at each other like
the silly little boys they are.
Her acting, as well as her char
acter, is pure class — saucy and
savvy enough to take on anything
that stands between her and her
goal, honest enough to get away
with some rather nasty writhing
on the floor.
Palin is great as a stuttering
animal-lover whom everyone dis
misses as ineffectual, but who
ends up holding the key to the
whereabouts of the loot. The stut
tering could have been a stupid,
obvious gag, but Palin, with his
peaked little face and frantically
bobbing Adams-apple, will put
you into the aisle.
And then there's Kevin Kline
as Otto, a Nietzsche-spouting,
Zen-studying, yoga-practicing
wannabe Ninja/Uebermensch who
sniffs his underarms for strength
(both sexual and physical) and
thinks the London Underground
is a terrorist movement.
Skulking in the bushes, spying
as Wanda vamps Archibald or
slurping down little fishies, Otto
is a wicked caricature of the per
fect Reaganite male.
These four mesh perfectly, im
buing "A Fish Called Wanda"
with the best comedy, where what
happens isn't as important as how
it happens. It's too bad the Cen
tury Gigaplex gauges six bucks a
shot, or I would let something
this good happen again and again.
