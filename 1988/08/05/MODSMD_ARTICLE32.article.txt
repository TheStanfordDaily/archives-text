## Morgan's Miracle Machine motors in Massachusetts 
### 
Ah the dog days of August.
Less than 60 games left in the
season and the heat is on in more
ways than one. It's time to put up with
the heat and time for the contenders to
put up — or shut up.
Clearly, the hottest thing in all baseball
is the Boston Red Sox under new manager
Joe Morgan. Originally hired as an interim
manager, Morgan won seven straight and
earned a contract through season's end.
Since that time the BoSox have won 12
more times and lost only once. Wednesday,
Morgan's contract was extended through
the end of next season.

Oh, by the way, the Red Sox are now
tied for first place with the Detroit Tigers
and tied a 57 year old American League
record with their 22nd straight home vic
tory Wednesday.
It remains to be seen if the Sox can
exorcise the Ghosts of Late-Season Col
lapses Past — I can see Bucky Dent's three
run homer sailing over the wall in Fenway

like it was yesterday — but they've cer
tainly got to be a favorite to grab the
division title.
Whatever the magic that is Morgan con
sists of, he has managed to get production
out of almost everybody on the team since
taking over.
Jim Rice seems to have returned from
the netherworld. Lee Smith, whose acqui
sition had Sox fans thinking pennant in
October, is on a roll and may yet be on
the hill to save the win that captures the
flag come October.
Ellis Burks, who opposing managers are
touting as a certain MVP in the early '90s,
is hitting .323, playing a dynamite center
field and bringing the dimension of speed
to the normally lead-legged Red Sox.
Wade Boggs, the best pure hitter of our
era, is batting .359, tops in the bigs. Of
course, that's almost to be expected. He's
a .354 lifetime hitter — the fourth best
ever.
Then there's Roger Clemens. En route
to his unprecedented third straight Cy
Young Award, Clemens is putting up un
believable numbers. (I know I'm harping
on this but no one has ever done this
before. Not Sandy Koufax. Not Tom
Seaver. Nolan Ryan hasn't ever won the
award.)
Simply put, Roger Clemens is the dom
inant pitcher in the game today. No one
else is even close. Not Dwight Gooden. Not
Orel Hershiser. It's a crime to mention
Dave Stewart in the same breath.
To think, last year Dave Stewart was
whining about how he deserved the Cy
Young Award. Clemens' response was

something like "Funny, I look at the
trophies in my living room and they said
Roger Clemens, not Dave Stewart."
Stewart had a chance to take those words
and shove them back in Clemens' face this
year. Oh well, hopefully opportunity will
knock again for Dave Stewart.
I kind of doubt it though.
The other divisional races are shaping
up to be fairly interesting as well.
In the AL West the Oakland Ath
letics are holding strong to their lead of
six-and-one-half games but the World
Champion Minnesota Twins won't go away.
Every time they got close, the A's beat
them back. But every time they seem to
be slipping away, they close the gap just
enough to keep the A's in their sights.
Then there are the enigmatic California
Angels. Seemingly out of the race by the
40th game of the season, the Angels are
still not much of a threat at 10 games back.
But they finally crossed over the .500
barrier and are playing very well. With
Wally Joyner, Chili Davis and Rookie-of
the-Year-to-be Bryan Harvey, the Angels
seem to be just one minor miracle away
from being in the race. We'll have to stay
tuned.
In the National League, the New York
Mets managed to pad their lead a bit
last weekend by taking three of four
from the Pittsburgh Pirates. But, like the
Twins, the young Bucs won't be kept down.
They get four more shots at the
Metropolitans this weekend in Three
Rivers. They'll no doubt be ready.

So will the Mets. They expect to get first
baseman Keith Hernandez back for Fri
day's game. He's missed 37 games with a
hamstring injury.
Though the Mets went into something
of a funk before Hernandez went down,
his departure from the lineup and the re
sulting loss of his leadership on the field,
is blamed for the Mets protracted stretch
of .500 ball.
Oddly enough, the island of stability in
New York has been Darryl Strawberry.
Beginning in the middle of last season,
Strawberry made the transition from tem
peramental sometimes star to MVP
candidate and Superstar of the First Mag
nitude.
He and Jose Canseco of the A's have
legitimate shots at becoming the first mem
bers of the so-called 40-40 club — 40 stolen
bases and 40 home runs in the same year
for those of you who don't know.
Canseco currently checks in at 31 homers
and 28 steals. Strawberry is behind in the
stolen base department with only 20, but
he should be able to pick that up if he
wants to reach 40-40. He's right on track
in the power department with 29 home
runs.
The NL West will have to wait to next
week. By then we'll see how the Pirates
fared against the Mets. The Expos may be
in second place by then. Or the Mets may
be 10 games up.
