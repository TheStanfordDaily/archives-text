# Map survey says students are lost
## Professors stress geographic literacy 
### Jennifer Cotteleer 
Responding to a recent National
Geographic study that says Amer
icans are geographic illiterates,
Stanford professors said geogra
phy must be emphasized more in
secondary education so that stu
dents can apply this knowledge to
history and current events at the
university level.
"It's a problem," said History
Professor Carl Degler about Stan
ford students' lack of background
in geography. "You can't rely on
their knowledge in any detail of
the orientation of the U.S."
"People are not tuned into the
organization of the earth," he
said.
The survey, conducted by the
Gallup organization, revealed that
Americans are surprisingly lost in
the world. For example, 14 per
cent of Americans could not even
identify the United States on a
world map.
Gallup's survey asked respon
dents in nine different countries
to identify 16 geographic locations
on a world map. In the 18-24 age

group, Americans scored dead
last.
Many professors recognized
that geographic literacy among
Stanford students is lacking, but
none felt that Stanford's class-

rooms are the place for rote
memorization of geography.
"From an educational point of
view, teaching geography for the
sake of geography does not make
sense," said Political Science Pro
fessor Hans Weiler. Weiler said it

is more important to put geogra
phy "in an explanatory context.
You want to relate geographic
facts to political facts to economic
facts."
Instead of spending classtime
quizzing their students on geo
graphical relationships, profes
sors said they attempt to work
around the gap.
Degler said he carries maps to
class "frequently" and finds this
strategy helpful. Education Pro
fessor Joel Samoff agreed: "I keep
a map up and get them more com
fortable. It is not uncommon for
students to arrive with little or
no knowledge of geography."
Samoff begins some of his
classes on African politics by ask
ing students to relate the size of
the United States to the African
continent. He said students are
surprised to find out that the
United States is less than half as
large as Africa.
Explaining this phenomena
Samoff said, "Students start with
a sense of the United States at
the center. We tend to be parochial
because we are so big."
