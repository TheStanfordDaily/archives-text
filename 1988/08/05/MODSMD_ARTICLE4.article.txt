# MEChA members campaign for full-time asst. dean
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Members of Stanford's Chicano/
Latino student organization, MEChA,
released a statement Wednesday de
manding that their community's dean
for campus affairs be increased to a
full-time position from its current half
time status.
Both the black community's recent
success in this same struggle and a let
ter sent by AASA to University Provost
James Rosse calling for a full-time dean
for the Asian community have inspired
MEChA to accelerate its efforts to in
crease the role of its dean, according to
Vietnamese Student Association mem
ber Paul Gager.
Rosse two weeks ago made the Black
Community Services Center dean a full
time position.
After Rosse then turned down the
Asian community's proposal for a full
time dean, Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Michael Jackson allocated discre
tionary funds from that department to
increase the Asian American Activities

Center's dean to a three-quarter-time
post.
Members of campus ethnic minority
groups first began calling for their deans
to play stronger roles in their commu
nities when they were included in the
Rainbow Agenda's list of demands in
the spring of 1987. Written by Stan
ford's different minority groups, the
Rainbow Agenda was presented to Rosse
and University President Donald Ken
nedy in an effort to spark a significant
institutional increase in the Universi
ty's support of minority students.
Reading from a prepared statement
Wednesday, MEChA Co-coordinator
Lucky Gutierrez asked: "How can we
take seriously Stanford's committment
to diversity that we have heard since
our orientations when we see our com
munity institutions are given only half
time leadership?"
"The responsibilities of the Chicano
dean must include serving and advising
the over 15 Chicano student organiza
tions ... in addition to full-time oper
ation of the Centro; this is a full-time
job in and of itself," he added.

"We look at this as part of a 20 year
process we've been going through" to
gain institutional support from the Uni
versity, MEChA member Alejandro
Sweet Cordero said, in an interview lat
er. MEChA has existed at Stanford for
20 years.
Gutierrez spoke along with members
of the Black Student Union, the Asian-
American Student's Association and this
year's Council of Presidents, who read
statements in support of MEChA's
struggle to strengthen the role of their
dean.
"We agree with the MEChA's conclu
sion that a half-time dean cannot pos
sibly perform all the necessary duties
of an ethnic community center director,"
COP member David Brown read from
a prepared statement.
Jackson said he "personally believe(s)
we should do this," and that most ad
ministrators agree full-time deans are
needed in the University's ethnic com
munities.
"It's not a matter of if we're going

dents."
to provide full-time support. The
question is how and when we do
that," he said.
While Jackson said it is "un
likely" that the University would
provide for a full-time dean this
fall, the position may be intro
duced as early as winter quarter.
According to Jackson, the Uni
versity provided for a full-time
dean in the black community be
cause the dean's roles were very
clearly defined, while the roles for
the corresponding position in the
Chicano/Latino community are
not as neatly spelled out because
of a lack of consensus opinion in
the community.
In addition, Chicano/Latino
dean Juan Yniguez, has not offi

cially supported the introduction
of a full-time dean because he said
he believes his second job, as a
residential dean, is also important.
In response to MEChA's de
mands, Jackson said he will en
courage students with divergent
views on the direction of the
Chicaao/Latino community to
"come together and reach a con
sensus" about what specific roles
a full-time dean should play this
fall.
In their statements, and in in
terviews, members of the different
ethnic groups said they disagree
with administrators who have said
they would not give ethnic deans
full-time positions in part because
they don't want to "pigeon hole"
the deans in positions seen as
"marginalized" by the rest of the
administration.
Staff member for the Asian

American Activities Center Elsa
Tsutaoka called this view "dis
respectful."
"As a handful of ethnic admin
istrators, [the University] relies
on us as experts. . . . But we're
expected to do all that in our half
time roles," Archuleta said. "It's
crazy. It's impossible."
Jackson said the University is
trying to overcome the myth that
ethnic deans have less clout than
other administrative deans. He
described the myth as "an histor
ical view" that is dying out.
Jackson added that all ethnic
centers on campus will probably
have full-time deans one day."I
think it probably will happen," he
said.
"We know we won't get it to
morrow," said Sweet Cordero,
"But we know the University is
good at dragging its feet."

istrators, [the University] relies
on us as experts. . . . But we're
expected to do all that in our half

crazy. It's impossible."
Jackson said the University is
trying to overcome the myth that
ethnic deans have less clout than
other administrative deans. He
described the myth as "an histor
ical view" that is dying out.
Jackson added that all ethnic
centers on campus will probably
have full-time deans one day."I
think it probably will happen," he
said.
"We know we won't get it to
morrow," said Sweet Cordero,
"But we know the University is
good at dragging its feet."
Members of Stanford's Chicano/
Latino student organization, MEChA,
released a statement Wednesday de
manding that their community's dean
for campus affairs be increased to a
full-time position from its current half
time status.
Both the black community's recent
success in this same struggle and a let
ter sent by AASA to University Provost
James Rosse calling for a full-time dean
for the Asian community have inspired
MEChA to accelerate its efforts to in
crease the role of its dean, according to
Vietnamese Student Association mem
ber Paul Gager.
Rosse two weeks ago made the Black
Community Services Center dean a full
time position.
After Rosse then turned down the
Asian community's proposal for a full
time dean, Assoc. Dean of Student Af
fairs Michael Jackson allocated discre
tionary funds from that department to
increase the Asian American Activities

Center's dean to a three-quarter-time
post.
Members of campus ethnic minority
groups first began calling for their deans
to play stronger roles in their commu
nities when they were included in the
Rainbow Agenda's list of demands in
the spring of 1987. Written by Stan
ford's different minority groups, the
Rainbow Agenda was presented to Rosse
and University President Donald Ken
nedy in an effort to spark a significant
institutional increase in the Universi
ty's support of minority students.
Reading from a prepared statement
Wednesday, MEChA Co-coordinator
Lucky Gutierrez asked: "How can we
take seriously Stanford's committment
to diversity that we have heard since
our orientations when we see our com
munity institutions are given only half
time leadership?"
"The responsibilities of the Chicano
dean must include serving and advising
the over 15 Chicano student organiza
tions ... in addition to full-time oper
ation of the Centro; this is a full-time
job in and of itself," he added.

"We look at this as part of a 20 year
process we've been going through" to
gain institutional support from the Uni
versity, MEChA member Alejandro
Sweet Cordero said, in an interview lat
er. MEChA has existed at Stanford for
20 years.
Gutierrez spoke along with members
of the Black Student Union, the Asian-
American Student's Association and this
year's Council of Presidents, who read
statements in support of MEChA's
struggle to strengthen the role of their
dean.
"We agree with the MEChA's conclu
sion that a half-time dean cannot pos
sibly perform all the necessary duties
of an ethnic community center director,"
COP member David Brown read from
a prepared statement.
Jackson said he "personally believe(s)
we should do this," and that most ad
ministrators agree full-time deans are
needed in the University's ethnic com
munities.
"It's not a matter of if we're going

MEChA Co-coordinator Lucky Gutierrez tells the
press and minority students Wednesday that "it's
time for Stanford to put its money where its mouth
is and commit a full-time dean for Chicano stu

to provide full-time support. The
question is how and when we do
that," he said.
While Jackson said it is "un
likely" that the University would
provide for a full-time dean this
fall, the position may be intro
duced as early as winter quarter.
According to Jackson, the Uni
versity provided for a full-time
dean in the black community be
cause the dean's roles were very
clearly defined, while the roles for
the corresponding position in the
Chicano/Latino community are
not as neatly spelled out because
of a lack of consensus opinion in
the community.
In addition, Chicano/Latino
dean Juan Yniguez, has not offi

cially supported the introduction
of a full-time dean because he said
he believes his second job, as a
residential dean, is also important.
In response to MEChA's de
mands, Jackson said he will en
courage students with divergent
views on the direction of the
Chicaao/Latino community to
"come together and reach a con
sensus" about what specific roles
a full-time dean should play this
fall.
In their statements, and in in
terviews, members of the different
ethnic groups said they disagree
with administrators who have said
they would not give ethnic deans
full-time positions in part because
they don't want to "pigeon hole"
the deans in positions seen as
"marginalized" by the rest of the
administration.
Staff member for the Asian

American Activities Center Elsa
Tsutaoka called this view "dis
respectful."
"As a handful of ethnic admin
istrators, [the University] relies
on us as experts. . . . But we're
expected to do all that in our half
time roles," Archuleta said. "It's
crazy. It's impossible."
