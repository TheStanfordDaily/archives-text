# Tresidder sprouts out
## Construction next week will close back patio 
### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
The first step in a remodeling
process that will move The Store
and Coffee House into larger
spaces and add 8,000 square feet
of office space to the upper deck
is beginning next week.
Construction will give a new
look to Tresidder Union's upper
deck and back patio, but Tresidder
officials say the work has been
scheduled to minimize interrup
tions for student life.
According to Asst. Director of
Tresidder Paul Szczesiul, "We're
holding off starting the real con
struction until the end of the eight
week session." The construction
should end next spring Szczesiul
said.
The new space on the upper
deck will house the Computer Sci
ence Department and LOTS tem

porarily. The Computer Science
Department will be moved to a
new building, on the Near West
Campus when eventually com
pleted, according to Szczesiul.
The space vacated by the Com
puter Science Department and
LOTS downstairs in Tresidder
will then be remodeled and be
come the new Coffee House. The
old Coffee House space will be
come the new Store, and the
Grand Marketplace will expand
into the present space occupied bv
The Store.
" The Hoard of Trustees ap
proved the concept" of remodeling
the first floor of Tresidder, and
the project is in the planning stage
Szczesiul said.
The present construction also
involves installing a public access
elevator behind the Coffee House.
"It's kind of a bear," said
Lougee, who added that noise and
dust from construction and con
trolling alcoholic beverages may be
problems. "There's going to be a

lot of noise and a lot of dust, and
we are just going to try to over
come it all."
But Lougee said the Coffee
House will be working to compen
sate for any problems. Improved
ventilation and a possible barrier
blocking the construction area
from the back entrance of the Cof
fee House will help to alleviate

some of the problems.
As far as controlling sales and
consumption of alcohol, Lougee
said unless the staff is able to
adequately keep alcohol in areas
covered by its liquor license, he
may be forced to restrict the
drinking of wine and beer to in
side the building.
