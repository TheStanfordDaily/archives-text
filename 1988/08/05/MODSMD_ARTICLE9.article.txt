### Soeun Park 
Stanford's Affirmative Ac
tion Recognition Awards, an
nounced last month, were ex
panded this year to include stu
dent and faculty groups but
surprisingly few campus pro
grams were nominated for
recognition.
Only four eligible programs
were nominated for the third
annual award. The Physics De
partment, the Stanford
Literacy Project, the Early
Matriculation Program for Ac
cepted Minority Students in the
School of Medicine and Campus
Report were all named as win
ners.
Affirmative Action Officer
Beverly Williams said campus
officials pay attention to the
awards but that the campus
has few minority programs
which qualify. To qualify, pro
grams must be initiated by
Stanford students, faculty or
administration and must be
unique to Stanford in some
way.

The awards were first
created two years ago by the
University to recognize pro
grams which actively work
toward promoting diversity on
campus.
According to Santiago
Rodriguez, University affirma
tive action officer, "aside from
commending programs for a job
well done, the award is in
tended to send a message to
the larger community that di
versity and pluralism are con
cepts of institutional value to
Stanford."
The Physics Department was
recognized for its efforts in the
recruitment and retention of
minority graduate students.
The department's Advisory
Committee on Admissions has
played a leadership role in
training 14 ethnic minorities
for doctorates in an under
represented field.
The winners will be officially
recognized in a public cere
mony this fall.
