# Top Stanford athletes will go to Seoul
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Already established as one of
the top academic institutions in
the world, next month Stanford
will have a chance to demonstrate
athletic superiority as well.
When the 1988 Summer Olym
pics begin in Seoul in September,
many Stanford students, gradu
ates and coaches will hope to con
tinue the gold medal tradition set
forth by the likes of Bob Mathias,
Chris von Saltza and Eric Heiden
— all three former Stanford stu
dents.
With more than a score of ath
letes already on Olympic teams,
Stanford is a sure bet to pull home
more medals than quite a few of
the countries competing. Leading
the way, at least in terms of media
coverage, is senior Todd Lichti.
Lichti, a 6-foot-4 guard, is one
of the final 17 vying for 12 spots
on the Olympic basketball team.
On Sunday, Lichti played six
minutes as the Olympic hopefuls
beat a collection of NBA players
in the first game of an eight-game
tour. Sports experts still consider
Lichti something of a longshot to
make the final squad.
Sophomore teammate Andrew
Vlahov, unlike Lichti, has already
secured a trip to Seoul, wearing
the uniform of the Australian na
tional team. The forward has re
covered from knee surgery and is
reported to be much stronger than
before. Both the U.S. and
Australian teams have qualified
for the 12-team Olympic field.
While making the basketball
team means an almost-certain
medal for Lichti, three Stanford
volleyball players might also try
to reap the same benefits. In 1984,
the U.S. volleyball team was the
gold medal winner.
Senior Scott Fortune and '86
graduates Chris Braun and Jon
Root are among 15 players vying
for 12 spots on the volleyball
team. Both Fortune, who stopped
out during the past school year to
train with the squad, and Root
are almost certain picks for the
team. Braun's spot, however, is
more tenuous.
There is no uncertainty on the
women's side, where '86 graduate
Kim Oden has had little problem
adjusting from collegiate to inter

national play. After joining the
national team in January, 1987,
Oden became a starter and the
team captain within weeks.
Two other U.S. Olympic teams
expected to excel next month are
the baseball and water polo teams,
and Stanford will have represen
tatives on both. Baseball Coach
Mark Marquess will serve as the
U.S. squad's head coach. Former
Stanford baseball players Doug
Robbins and Ed Sprague will most
likely join Marquess in the team's
quest for the gold.
After tying top-ranked Yugos
lavia and beating No. 3 West Ger
many over the weekend, the
fourth-ranked U.S. water polo
team also has a good shot at a
medal. Stanford graduates Jody
Campbell, Alan Mouchawar and
James Bergeson are almost
guarenteed spots.
Members of Stanford's track
and field team will also make the
Olympic team. Cardinal runners,
jumpers and throwers have been
among the world's best ever since
17-year-old Bob Mathias won the
decathalon in the 1948 Games.
Brian Marshall, a June graduate,
will compete in the high jump for

Canada and 1985 graduates Jeff
Atkinson and Regina Jacobs will
wear the red, white and blue in
the men's and women's 1,500
meters.
In swimming, June graduates
Anthony Mosse and Sean Murphy
are both going to Seoul. Fighting
for spots on the U.S. team this
week are 1984 medalists Jenna
Johnson, Pablo Morales and
Susan Rapp. Michelle Griglione,
Jeff Kostoff, John Moffet and Jay
Mortenson — all Stanford swim
mers — will face off for spots as
well.
Men's swimming Coach Skip
Kenney will be the associate head
coach at the Olympics.
Field hockey Coach Sheryl
Johnson is also traveling to Seoul
— as a player. Johnson is the
captain of the U.S. team and was
named Sports Illustrated's field
hockey athlete of the year in 1987.
