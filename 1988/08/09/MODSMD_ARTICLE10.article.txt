# Hoover book charts America's course for the next decade

### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
A book that Hoover Institution scholars
predict may be the "blueprint" for U.S.
foreign and domestic policy in the 1990s
will hit the shelves of bookstores around
the world by September.
Thinking About America: The United
States in the 19905, published by Hoover
Institution Press, is an anthology of essays
from prominent U.S. thinkers including the
last four U.S. presidents, four Nobel
laureates and 39 politicians, economists and
scholars.
The book follows the same guidelines as
an earlier Hooover book about political pre
dictions for the '80s. Policy makers
scrutinized this earlier publication and fol
lowed many of its recommendations, ac
cording to Hoover Director W. Glenn Camp
bell.
In the new publication's Foreward,
Campbell notes that Soviet General Secre

tary Mikhail Gorbachev used the first book
to understand how U.S. political processes
would unfold in the 80s.
"We know what you think. We have read
this book and watched all its programs
become adopted by the Reagan adminis
tration," Gorbachev told U.S. Secretary of
State George Shultz at a 1985 meeting in
Moscow.
To name a few of the writers, former
U.S. President Richard Nixon makes pre
dictions about the future of the United
States and Hoover Senior Research Fellow
Edward Teller discusses defense and dis
armament. Attorney General Edwin Meese
deals with criminal justice while Nobel
prize-winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn writes
on the history of Russia.
Hoover scholars Annelise Anderson and
Dennis Bark co-edited the book that is
geared toward a "general audience rather
than an academic one," according to An
derson.
