# 12th Congressional District contest
## Eshoo changes campaign advisers 
### David Clint 
To give her campaign a more aggressive
grass roots base, 12th District Congres
sional Candidate Anna Eshoo recently
changed campaign management firms.
Following talks with the Democratic Con
gressional Committee, Eshoo said she
realized she could not use the same cam
paign approach to beat Republican candi
date Tom Campbell that she used in her
primary race, according to Eshoo's cam
paign manager Mary Hughes.
Eshoo's new management firm — Richie
Ross — will now funnel more money to
voter contact and field operations. "(The
DCCC) want(s) people who will spend
money wisely. We want assistance."
Ross is replacing Townsend and Co. —
a leading California consultant firm whose
clients have included Los Angeles Mayor
Tom Bradley and 1984 Presidential candi
date Walter Mondale.
A Sacramento based firm, Ross recently
helped San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos
gain his post. Ross has also worked on two

winning initiatives in Santa Clara County,
the San Jose Arena and the Santa Clara
County Jail.
Praising Ross as one of the "best organ
izers in California," Asst. Director of the
Row Keith Archuleta said the firm is
"definitely a plus" for Eshoo's campaign.
Archuleta, who was once an aid to Agnos,
said he knew Richie Ross personally while
working in Sacramento.
"He is good at fundraising and is a good
strategist," Archuleta said.
Hughes added that Eshoo's campaign has
maintained close contacts with the DCCC,
a national organization that assists viable
candidates.
After closely examining Eshoo's cam
paign records, the DCCC gave Eshoo their
financial support once her campaign met
"certain criteria," Hughes said.
In fact, the DCCC is targeting the 12th
district election as one of the five most
important races in the country, according
to Hughes.
