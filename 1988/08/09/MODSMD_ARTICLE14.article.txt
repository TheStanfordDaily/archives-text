# Bomb explosion rocks Shultz's motorcade in Bolivia
## 
### 
LA PAZ, Bolivia â€” The motor
cade of Secretary of State George
Shultz came under attack Monday
when a remote-control bomb ex
ploded as the caravan was driving
between the La Paz airport and
the city center. No one was in
jured, but four vehicles were
damaged.
Shultz had just arrived in
Bolivia to deliver a speech strongly
condemning narcotics traffickers
and praising the La Paz govern
ment's new efforts to eliminate
the nation's huge drug trade.
Two unknown groups claimed
responsibility but offered no rea
son for the attack, according to a
local television station. Bolivian
Foreign Minister Guillermo
Bedregal Gutierrez told reporters
that he blamed drug traffickers.
However, Charles Redman,
Shultz's spokesman, cautioned
that Bedregal's statement was
only speculation and added that
the explosion "probably was not
intended to kill."
Roberto Cuevas, news director
of Channel 2, said that a telephone
caller said the bombing was
carried out by the "Simon Bolivar
Command." A second caller said
that it was the work of the

"Armed Forces of National Lib
eration."

The attack oc
curred at 9:25
a.m. EDT as the
motorcade passed
an industrial area
called Calacota.
The road is
steeply graded
downhill, and the
vehicles in the
motorcade were

driving at about 25 mph.
A Chevrolet van carrying five
persons, including a doctor and a
nurse, had just passed the point
of the blast when the bomb ex
ploded, and an armored Plymouth
sedan was approaching. The sec
retary's armored Cadillac
limousine was about 100 yards
ahead of those vehicles.
The force of the explosion blew
out two of the van's three side
windows, broke the right rear pas
senger window of the limousine
carrying Shultz's wife, Helena,
and did similar damage to a
Bolivian security car and the
sedan that carried Redman and
two other State Department
public affairs officials.
