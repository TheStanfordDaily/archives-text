UNITED NATIONS - Secre
tary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar yesterday set Aug. 20 as
the date for a formal cease-fire in
the eight-year-old Persian Gulf
War, and both Iran and Iraq
pledged to try to halt the bloody
conflict immediately.
The climax of two weeks of in
tensive negotiations occurred at a
session of the 15-nation U.N. Se
curity Council, where Perez de
Cuellar also announced that he
was inviting Iran and Iraq to par
ticipate in face-to-face peace talks
in Geneva beginning Aug. 25.
"The restoration of peace will
bring to the peoples of both coun
tries victories far greater than
those of war," Perez de Cuellar
said in a statement.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati, in a letter to Se
curity Council President Li Yule
of China, declared that Tehran
"is prepared to refrain from all
military action on land, at sea
and in the air, starting today."
But "if we are attacked, there will
be no hesitation to respond," he
added.

Iraqi Ambassador Ismat Kit
tani, asked by reporters outside
the council chamber when peace
would begin for his nation,
replied: "Starting today." He
added, "This is a happy day, and
I am a happy man."
An air of euphoria pervaded
U.N. headquarters, and members
of the Security Council applauded
at the news of an accord in the
war, in which 1 million people

have been killed
or wounded since
it began in Sep
tember 1980.
The announce
ment represented
a personal victory
for Perez de Cuel
lar, who had been
trying for a year
to persuade both

sides to accept U.N. Resolution
598, a peace plan that mandates
a cease-fire, the withdrawal of
forces to internationally recog
nized borders and a comprehen
sive settlement.
