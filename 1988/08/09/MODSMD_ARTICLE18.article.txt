Senate passes drought-aid hill
WASHINGTON — The Senate unanimously
approved the most generous drought relief leg
islation in U.S. history yesterday, allocating $3.9
billion for farmers hit hard by this year's devas
tating dry spell.
The 92-0 vote sent the measure to the House
for adoption today or tomorrow, with the hope
that President Reagan can sign it into law this
week and speed emergency payments to hundreds
of thousands of distressed farms.
While the entire country has been affected by
the drought, the most extensive aid will go to
farmers in the Midwestern corn belt whore overall
crop losses may amount to 30 percent or more.
"This is a message of hope for American farm
ers . . . that help is on the way," said Sen. Patrick
Leahy, I)-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee.
"Without this legislation a lot of farmers and
farm families would be driven from their land
because they wouldn't make it through the year,"
added Senate Minority Leader Boh Dole, R-Kan.,
who estimated that drought losses this year would
range between $5 billion and $10 billion.
The Senate vote came on a compromise plan
forged from the separate Senate and House bills
passed late last month.

Under the measure, the government would pro
vide disaster payments to farmers who lose more
than 35 percent of their crops because of the
weather. They would receive 65 percent of their
losses or their anticipated federal subsidy.
Batman's butler is dead at 85
HOLLYWOOD — Alan Napier, the British
born character actor who worked on the London
stage with Sir Laurence Olivier and Sir John
Gielgud, and on the sound stages of Hollywood
with Batman and Hobin, died yesterday.
He was 85 and died of natural causes at a
convalescent hospital in Santa Monica, where he
had been living since June, said his stepdaughter,
.Jennifer Raine Bissell. He had suffered a stroke
last year.
The distinguished, silver-haired actor enjoyed
a 40-year career that involved films, television
and, in the early part of his career, countless
stage appearances.
But thanks to television he will be primarily
remembered by millions as Alfred Pennyworth,
the trusted servant of Batman and the only living
soul who knew that the Caped Crusader was
reallv Bruce Wayne.
