Stamford minorities
need full-time deans

After years spent
reiterating its com
mitment to diversity
on this campus, now is the
time for Stanford to put
words into action.
Establishing full-time
deans for the Asian Ameri
can, Native American and
Chicano/Latino communi
ties is a necessity Stanford
can no longer put off.
After a long struggle by
the black community here,
the University finally in
creased the role of their
dean from half-time to full
time status.
Now is the time to do the
same in the other commu
nities.
It has come to the point
when arg-uing that some
communities here may not
be as well developed as
others — and therefore
don't merit the full-time
support of a dean — is out
weighed by a community's
need to grow with institu
tional support.
By demonstrating this
support, Stanford could go
a long way towards improv
ing its embittered relations
with minority students here.
Results of the University
Committee on Minority Is
sues interim report, which
were released in June, could
not have been more clear in

underlining the importance
of increased institutional
support for minorities at
Stanford.
And one of the best ways
to tangibly affect this
change is to increase the
roles of Stanford's ethnic
deans.
By the nature of their
jobs, ethnic deans are
uniquely capable of address
ing minority issues here.
For instance, one of the
major complaints of minor
ity students is that, as indi
viduals, they are forced to
constantly educate friends
and administrators about
the issues important to their
communities.
The fact that administra
tors and community mem
bers from all over campus
already rely heavily on the
half-time deans for their ex
pertise indicates not only
that the position is needed
but that the deans are able
to take some of the educa
tional burden off students.
However, the stress of
holding down two jobs at
once prevents the ethnic
deans from adequately fill
ing this crucial role on
campus.
Because racism still exists
in this society and at Stan
ford, minority students need
a full-time spokesperson not
only to help their commu
nities grow but to effectively
represent them to an oft
ignorant administration.
It's time Stanford let
them do their jobs.
