## Things we just don't need 
### 
THERE COMES a time in
everyone's life when we
have to worry about our
budgets. Sometimes we wonder
where all the money goes as soon
as we get that paycheck.
Despite the dents (or in some
cases, significant holes) that bills
and taxes leave in our bank ac
counts, there are some things we
can definitely do without in this
life. These are the things that, in
my opinion, do not deserve our
money, no matter how much
money we make a year:
• Tabloid magazines such as the
National Enquirer, Star and per
haps the biggest insult to U.S.
journalism and our intelligence —
the Weekly World Report. If we
really want to know Joan Collin's
shoe size, what Michael Jackson
does with his pet chimp Bubbles
or how that two-headed baby in
South America really survived,
then we can satisfy our curiosity
by reading about these stories in
tbe checkout line at the super
market. After all, we don't actu
ally have to buy those magazines
in order to read them.
On second thought, maybe
those tabloids aren't as worthless
as they look. They do give us a
good laugh, which some would say
is invaluable.

• "976" phone numbers. Is
there anything more worthless
than those phone numbers that
offer us such "necessary" services
as tarot card readings or party
line dating? Of course it's not
worthless, because someone out
there is making a profit from all
those repeat callers.
• Contributions to flamboyant
TV evangelists. Personally, I don't
really care what Jimmy Swaggert
does behind closed doors.
And if he can spread the gospel
and make people better Chris
tians, that is also his business.
But if he does all these things
and asks for $50 from each of us,
too — that's where I have a prob
lem.
It's amazing how some blatantly
greedy preachers on television can
quote volumes of scripture, con
veniently forgetting that nowhere
in the Bible does Jesus ask for
money from his followers.
• Trashy books with a capital
"T." Like a lot of people, I some
times buy lightweight paperbacks
by the likes of Stephen King and
Danielle Steele. But the day I shell
out money to buy something like
Vanna Speaks is the day I will
gladly pluck every single eyelash
I have, immerse myself in boiling
water and come out smiling like

Vanna herself while I listen to
someone dragging fingernails
across a blackboard.
• Donations to the Lyndon La
Rouche cause. Enough said.
• Fluorescent clothes. There is
fashion, there is fad and then
there is pure tackiness.
• Anything to do with "Dirty
Dancing," the most overrated
movie of 1987. Some people have
seen it over 50 times — and that
was in the theaters, not on
videocassette. All this to see a few
fancy moves and the corniest,
most unbelievable ending this side
of "Flashdance."
There are a variety of reasons
why people spend their money and
often struggle to make ends meet.
Hopefully none of the above will
be any of those reasons.
