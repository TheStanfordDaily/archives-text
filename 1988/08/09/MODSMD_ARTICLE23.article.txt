## Apartheid is inarguably a severe repression of liberty 
### 
CARLA HAY is quite right,
in her column of August
2, in calling on us to
fight oppression wherever it is
found, at home or abroad. And
she is also right in recognizing
degrees of oppression.
Apartheid in South Africa is
much worse than the outrages
of the Ortega regime in Nicara
gua. In condemning one we
should never give the impres
sion of approving the other.
Some years ago, in a long

letter to the New York Times,
in which 1 referred to the So
viet Union as "an evil empire"
(I believe it still is), I coupled it
with a denunciation of the "evil
empires" of Chile and South
Africa, although the latter were
not strictly empires.
Actually, I have never met
anyone who denies the evil of
apartheid or defends it. People
differ on the most effective way
of eliminating it. I am confident
that Hay does not intend to

imply that those, like some
Stanford trustees and faculty
members, who do not subscribe
to the policy of total and imme
diate disinvestment in South
Africa as the best method of
eliminating apartheid, are in
any way sympathetic to it.
Further, it is incontestable
that in some dictatorial African
states like Ethiopia or Uganda,
where hundreds of thousands of
blacks have been slaughtered by
their rulers, conditions of life
are worse than in South Africa.
And it may be true, as Botha
claims, that the economic status
and economy of South African
blacks are higher than their
kinsmen in some other African
countries from which they flee
in order to work in South
Africa. Nonetheless, when we
denounce apartheid in South
Africa, Hay would be justifiably
indignant if she were told to
consider the even greater op
pressions elsewhere. However
true, their introduction into the
discussion would be irrelevant.
We cannot denounce all evils
simultaneously.
Many years ago when I was
contending that the Moscow
Trials were frame-ups and that
the confessions of the defen-

dants were extorted by torture,
now admitted 50 years after the
event by the Kremlin itself,
communist apologists for the
Trials, instead of discussing the
evidence, would often retort:
"Yes, but what about the lynch
ings in the South?"
There are still plenty of evils,
even in the United States, and
we should seek to eliminate
them. But when we talk of
repressions of liberty on the
scale present in Nicaragua, the
Soviet Union or South Africa,
their mention is at best a dis
traction.
