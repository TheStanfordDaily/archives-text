## Letters Washington's meddling has helped Noriega keep his power in Panama 
### 
ONE OF America's favor
ite characters — General
Manuel Antonio Noriega
— commander of the Defense
Force of Panama and thereby of
the country, has left the media
spotlight. He has not left his
job or his nation, however, and
he will remain in charge indefi
nitely, unless unseen pressures
prevail.
Just a year ago, General Nor
iega's tenure seemed in serious
doubt. He was denounced as a
crook, a thief, a murderer and a
drug trafficker by one and then
another of his close aides. Op
positionists crowded into the
streets daily, waving white
handkerchiefs, demanding his
resignation; and nobody had a
good word to say about him.
It seemed clear, in the atmos
phere of democratization in
Latin America, that Noriega
had to go into comfortable re
tirement in a distant land —
and the sooner the better.
But the opposition rallies are
no more. To the contrary, there
are occasional assemblies to
cheer Noriega, the national
leader. The predicted dates of
the dictator's departure have

long since passed, and no one
makes new predictions.
What has happened?
Very simply, the amateurish
meddling of Washington saved
Noriega, and gave him a cause.
It made credible his contention
that the former owners of the
Canal Zone were out to neutral
ize him in order to invalidate
the treaty requiring the Canal
to he turned over by degrees —
completely by the year 2000.
The economic measures im
posed by Washington hurt ordi
nary Panamanians much more
than they did Noriega. Not
suprisingly, the people blamed
the power punishing Panama,
instead of the man who
provoked the boycott.
Finally, the opposition becamc
demoralized.
Panamanians reasoned that if
Washington was so eager to
have Noriega out, it must be
for the benefit of the United
States. To oppose Noriega, then
was to play the game of the
foreign semi-occupiers of the
country, whose money is appre
ciated but not their arrogance.
Maybe it would be better to
suffer Noriega than to turn the

country over to U.S. interests.
The result has not only been
the failure to remove an unde
sirable head of state, but it has
also been a first-class humilia
tion for the United States in
Latin America. This country
has been shown to be clumsy,
tactless and ineffective; it may
not be necessary to pay much
attention to U.S. wishes unless
something is to be gained in
concrete terms.
Probably nothing better was
to be expected. The U.S. gov
ernment seems to feel that the
pygmy powers to the south

should do more or less as they
are told, despite the lack of
means of enforcing demands.
Once there was an easy military
option; in the 1920s it was pos
sible just to send in a few hun
dred Marines to straighten out
Central American politics.
But this just doesn't seem
feasible in the 1980s. In the
case of Panama, the force was
on the ground and available,
and it seems that senior State
Department officials wanted the
military to rescue them from
their embarrassment by getting
rid of Noriega — preferably
abducting him to put him on
trial in Florida. The saner
heads in the Pentagon said no,
apparently realizing that if U.S.
bases in Panama were used to
overturn a government, U.S.
bases everywhere would be less
welcome.
The bigger problem, however,
is the parochial mentality that
permeates much of U.S. foreign
policy — the failure to consider
the sentiments and psychology of
other peoples.
There was nothing wrong in
welcoming an anti-Noriega
movement and making it clear

that the United States would
look with favor on democratiza
tion. But to make his ouster a
U.S. rather than a Panamanian
objective was a gross error, and
punishing the Panamanian
people compounded it.
In similar fashion, only the
CIA could imagine that it was
the best agency to organize and
direct a Nicaraguan movement
for democracy. In Haiti, the
State Department failed to
realize that President Manigat
was the best that could be
hoped for and merited support;
lacking that support, he had no
basis for coping with the mili
tary.
Old ways die hard, but the
United States, like other
powers, needs to act with care
and subtlety, getting its way by
a mixture of incentives and
penalties instead of through the
blunderbuss. And it is always
best to consider the sensitivity
of peoples who are much less
inclined to do this country's
bidding if they feel they are
being pushed around.
