## Remembering Hiroshima and its haunting legacy 
### Tal Wongse-Sanit 
"Rest Ye In Peace For This
Error Shall Not Be Repeated,"
reads the epitaph on the
memorial for atomic bomb vic
tims at Peace Park in Hiros
hima.
Closer to home in Memorial
Church, speakers and partici
pants in Sunday's Hiroshima
Day commemorative service
reflected on the meaning of the
tragedy, 43 years later, and
sought ways to keep that prom
ise made to Hiroshima's victim.
Dozens of people gathered to
mark the dropping of the first
atomic bomb on August 6,
1945. One reason for hope was
the signing of the Limited Test
Ban Treaty on the same date
in 1963.
The service was sponsored by
the Stanford, Mid-Peninsula
and South Bay Chapter of Phy
sicians for Social Responsibil
ity, a group of doctors and
others concerned about nuclear
proliferation.
The arsenals of today's nu
clear powers contain "enough
megatonnage to equal 1 million
Hiroshimas," according to Syl
via Rogers, executive director
of PSR, "We commemorate this
date not to assign guilt, nor to
linger among images of death,
but to remind ourselves what
we are capable of doing."
The Rev. Richard Thayer
opened the ceremony by saying,
"78,000 voices were silenced in
one flash. . . . This memorial
service is the held breath of
hope."
Guest speaker Craig
Schindler of Project Victory, an

organization that calls its mis
sion "teaching non-adversarial
communications," used a
"mountaintop vision" theme to
illustrate the ongoing struggle
to eliminate nuclear bombs and
achieve peace.

k 78,000 voices were
silenced in one
flash.... This
memorial service is
the held breath of
hope.'

"We are here tonight not just
because of what happened in
the past, but as a living bridge
between the past and the fu
ture to come," Schindler said.
Schindler referred to the
teachings of Buddhism, Cat
holicism and other faiths and
quoted Gandhi and Martin Lu
ther King, Jr. to drive home
the universal ideal of harmony
and peace.
The services included two
Japanese musical interludes
performed by Fumiko Kodama
on the koto and Kanow Mat
sueda on the flute. The music
of the stringed koto and the
wooden flute evoked a beautiful
fragility that resounded
throughout the church.
Readings from different
faiths that continued the
themes of hope and peace were
given by Rabbi Michael
Familant, the Rev. Penelope
Duckworth and Glen Kameda.
