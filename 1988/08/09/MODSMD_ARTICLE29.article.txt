# E. Palo Alto summer academy
## Learning about 'empowerment' 
### Susan Wurlitzer Staff writer 
Instead of "sitting around the
house and watching television"
this summer, 24 junior high school
students from East Palo Alto are
working at LOTS, talking about
books and making tie-dyed shirts.
Managed by Stanford students
under the auspices of the Public
Service Center, the East Palo Alto
Stanford Summer Academy
brings seventh grade students to
campus for six weeks during the
summer. From July 5 to August
19, campers learn — free of charge
— about "empowerment," accord
ing to sophomore counselor Nicky
Ramos.
Empowerment, Ramos said,
means instilling the campers with
faith in themselves and their
minds. The students swim at
DeGuerre, use computers at
LOTS, write journals at Cubber
ley and learn about the history
of their city.
Recent workshops have covered
birth control, stereotypes and
Braille. During the Braille
workshop, students deciphered
messages from Braille to English
while wearing dark glasses that
blocked visibility.

Other workshops have included
trips to KZSU campus radio, the
Stanford Museum and a Giant's
game.
Brown said a normal day at the
academy begins with breakfast at
Wilbur Hall and proceeds to com
puter instruction and language
arts. Campers read classics like
"Catcher in the Rye" and the"The
Secret Rats of NIMH" and write
down their impressions. Coun
selors said they refrain from cor
recting grammar or spelling be
cause they want to impart the joy
of expression to the students.
The students end their day with
recreational activities such as
football, tie-dye or swimming.
East Palo Alto 12 year olds
Tamara Thompson, Monica Wat
kins and Nicole Amar, shouting
in unison, said they would be "sit
ting around the house and watch
ing television" if the program did
not exist.
Applications were handed out
at East Palo Alto middle schools,
24 were handed in and all were
accepted, according to Ramos.
Stanford student Lome Needle
started the program in 1986 with
the help of the Public Service Cen
ter. Funding for this summer's
program comes from a number of

sources. Approximately $6000
was left over from last year. Dona
tions and the proceeds from the
annual spring Community Car
nival bring the budget up to
$10,000.
EPASSA director and junior
Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza said the
budget is just enough for this
summer.
Mendoza said that "half of the
reason 1 do this is because of my
personal history and the other
half is because I love kids."
"I come from a place similar to
East Palo Alto, (where) people
took time out to talk to me. . . .
I feel like I should take the time
to help someone else," she said.
The academy also has a follow
up program in which the campers
are tutored during the next aca
demic year. The eighth graders
come to Stanford once a week for
a couple hours of instruction and
recreation.
Stanford's Public Service Cen
ter has kept up with 17 of the
academy's 24 participants last
year. Ten are involved in Public
Service Center programs, five are
working and two are goofing off,
according to Mendoza.
