# Hostile atmosphere slows contract talks

### Helen Willey 
With 20 days to go until the
United Stanford Workers contract
expires, union representatives
said they are disappointed with
the University's "hard-line" atti
tude at the bargaining table.
According to USW Steward
Linda Grouse, the union is having
an especially difficult time dealing
with University Lawyer Michael
Vartain. Vartain is the chief
spokesperson for the University's
bargaining team.
"Instead of trying to under
stand our concerns Michael Var
tain seemed intent on making our
proposal look bad. You can take
any proposition and reduce it to
an absurdity," Crouse said.
She said she is skeptical of the
University's willingness to nego
tiate fairly after Friday's meeting.
On Friday, at the second
negotiating session since contract
talks resumed July 26, the union
presented the majority of its pro
posals to the University. The cur
rent union contract will expire
Aug. 31.
Crouse said she could not
predict "how negotiations will go"
but said that so far the union is
disappointed with the Universi
ty's proposals.
"The real hard bargaining
hasn't begun yet, but in the next
couple of weeks we will know if

we are in for a real hard fight,"
she said, adding that she is unsure
of how well future negotiations
will proceed.
"The signs are bad so far,"
Crouse said.
Claiming that union represen
tatives are "attacking the negoti
ators," Vartain said personality
differences should not be an issue
during the negotiations.
"It is extremely unfortunate
that the negotiations have barely
gotten underway and the union
is basically attacking the negoti
ators," he said. The union "should
be directing its efforts to the is
sues at the bargaining table and
not the personalities or else
where," he said.
Vartain added that the union
wants to make "dramatic
changes" in the current contract
that require much explanation
before they can be be accepted.
"We will ask what questions we
need to get an understanding of
their proposals," he said.
The University wants negotia
tions to move smoothly and
quickly and hopes to have a new
contract by the Aug. 31 expiration
date, Vartain added. "It is very
difficult to predict" when a defi
nite settlement date will be
reached, he said.
