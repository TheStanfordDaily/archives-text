# Coffee shops add flair to their fare
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Palo Alto is a community rich
in excellent, pricey restaurants
but unfortunately lacking in
places offering less-than-fine
dining. For a quick bite at a rea
sonable price, McDonald's or
some other fast-food joint often
seems to be the only local option
(apart from the overrated greasy
spoon University Creamery,
where the great milkshakes un
fortunately cannot compensate
for the lousy service and the mar
ginal fare).
After exhaustive searching,
however, Dining Out has uncov
ered several inexpensive-yet
classy coffee shops that offer tasty
meals in pleasant settings at rea
sonable expense — the prices are
higher than a visitor might ex
pect, as getting out of any Stan
ford area restaurant for under $7
total is nothing short of
miraculous.
But, for the discount diner,
several eateries eagerly fill the
value void and present the closest
semblance to a bargain available
in the area.
Ken's
888 El Camino Heal
Menlo Park
324-0217
Without a doubt, Ken's may be
one of the best coffee shops in
California. Boasting a sizeable
menu (with photos!) and tasty fare
at every meal, this cafe remains
a local favorite for a good reason.
The self-proclaimed "House of
Pancakes" earns its name at
breakfast time with a wide array
of exotic flapjacks — special Bel
gian and Apple pancakes that take
extra time to prepare. Ligonberry
(whatever this fruit is) and
strawberry-filled thin cakes are
equally tasty, as are the run-of
the-mill waffles and ordinary pan
cakes.
The price tag is greater than
Denny's, but the breakfast you
get is well worth the charge.
Lunch and dinner are also de
licious and inexpensive to boot.

Ken's offers a dozen burgers and
sandwiches that are all quite
tasty, in quantities that are
definitely filling.
For a nicer dinner, a host of
moderately priced entrees await,
ranging from the standard spag
hetti in meat sauce to fried
chicken and shrimp, or salad as
well as a choice of potato, the
meals are as reasonable as they
are taste-tempting.
As if all this were not enough,
Ken's also features splendid home
made pies, not quite as good as
Grandma's but good desserts
nonetheless.

Dining Out has uncov
ered several
inexpensive-yet-classy
coffee shops that offer
tasty meals in pleasant
settings at reasonable
expense.

Sandy's Kitchen
153 Stanford Shopping Center
I'alo Alto
324-3742
If the clock has struck 7 p.m.
and your stomach is grumbling,
don't head over to the Stanford
Mall in search of a cheap sit-down
meal. For an earlier dinner as
well as breakfast and lunch, how
ever, Sandy's Kitchen is open and
eager to please.
The food is standard coffee-shop
fare, cooked on a grill in open
sight behind the long counter.
From eggs and hashbrowns to
burgers and tuna melts, the cooks
quickly and consistently create
good food. The barbeque beef
sandwich is especially delicious,
with just enough tangy barbegue
sauce to dip th? fries.
The dinners are also satiating,
especially the fried chicken. But
even if poultry in oil is not your
favorite, Sandy's cooks are sure
