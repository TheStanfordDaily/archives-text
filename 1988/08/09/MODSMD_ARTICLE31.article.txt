# Coffee shops add flair to their fare
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Palo Alto is a community rich
in excellent, pricey restaurants
but unfortunately lacking in
places offering less-than-fine
dining. For a quick bite at a rea
sonable price, McDonald's or
some other fast-food joint often
seems to be the only local option
(apart from the overrated greasy
spoon University Creamery,
where the great milkshakes un
fortunately cannot compensate
for the lousy service and the mar
ginal fare).
After exhaustive searching,
however, Dining Out has uncov
ered several inexpensive-yet
classy coffee shops that offer tasty
meals in pleasant settings at rea
sonable expense — the prices are
higher than a visitor might ex
pect, as getting out of any Stan
ford area restaurant for under $7
total is nothing short of
miraculous.
But, for the discount diner,
several eateries eagerly fill the
value void and present the closest
semblance to a bargain available
in the area.
Ken's
888 El Camino Heal
Menlo Park
324-0217
Without a doubt, Ken's may be
one of the best coffee shops in
California. Boasting a sizeable
menu (with photos!) and tasty fare
at every meal, this cafe remains
a local favorite for a good reason.
The self-proclaimed "House of
Pancakes" earns its name at
breakfast time with a wide array
of exotic flapjacks — special Bel
gian and Apple pancakes that take
extra time to prepare. Ligonberry
(whatever this fruit is) and
strawberry-filled thin cakes are
equally tasty, as are the run-of
the-mill waffles and ordinary pan
cakes.
The price tag is greater than
Denny's, but the breakfast you
get is well worth the charge.
Lunch and dinner are also de
licious and inexpensive to boot.

Ken's offers a dozen burgers and
sandwiches that are all quite
tasty, in quantities that are
definitely filling.
For a nicer dinner, a host of
moderately priced entrees await,
ranging from the standard spag
hetti in meat sauce to fried
chicken and shrimp, or salad as
well as a choice of potato, the
meals are as reasonable as they
are taste-tempting.
As if all this were not enough,
Ken's also features splendid home
made pies, not quite as good as
Grandma's but good desserts
nonetheless.

Dining Out has uncov
ered several
inexpensive-yet-classy
coffee shops that offer
tasty meals in pleasant
settings at reasonable
expense.

Sandy's Kitchen
153 Stanford Shopping Center
I'alo Alto
324-3742
If the clock has struck 7 p.m.
and your stomach is grumbling,
don't head over to the Stanford
Mall in search of a cheap sit-down
meal. For an earlier dinner as
well as breakfast and lunch, how
ever, Sandy's Kitchen is open and
eager to please.
The food is standard coffee-shop
fare, cooked on a grill in open
sight behind the long counter.
From eggs and hashbrowns to
burgers and tuna melts, the cooks
quickly and consistently create
good food. The barbeque beef
sandwich is especially delicious,
with just enough tangy barbegue
sauce to dip th? fries.
The dinners are also satiating,
especially the fried chicken. But
even if poultry in oil is not your
favorite, Sandy's cooks are sure
to have something in their reper
toire suitable for your taste.
Service, however, is what really
sets this place apart. From the
kindly old gentleman who seats
the customers and takes their
cash (no checks or credit cards
accepted, thank you) to the
friendly waitresses, all the em
ployees seem interested if not in
tent on making each meal a pleas
ant one to expereince as well as
consume.
Lyon's
4298 El Camino Real
Los Altos
941-4204
First off, don't let the mailing
address fool you. As the pleasant
lady who answered the phone as
sured me, this is in fact the Lyon's
just down the street from the
Hyatt Palo AJto and only a few
miles from campus.
Pyramid breakfast alone is

worth the drive. Served from mid
night to 11 a.m. every weekday,
the pyramid allows you to chooses
as many breakfast items as you
like for $.80 each (with a three
item minimum). This is an en
tirely flexible build-your-own
breakfast which allows you to
frugally splurge if the french toast
and the eggs and the hash browns
and the bacon and .. .
The remaining portions of the
menu, though not as magnificent,
are also tasty and diverse. Lyon's
also serves a mean barbeque beef,
served on a grilled french bun
with the option for steak fries to
dip in the surplus spicy sauce.
The shrimp feast is another good
meal, as is the fish and chips.
And if American cuisine is not
enough, Lyon's serves a bevy of
Mexican dishes that are tasty even
if they deviate from traditional
preparations.
Best of all, the restaurant is
open 24 hours, perfect for the
night owl who wants a pleasant
alternative to greasy-spoons and
Safeway runs; clearly, pyramid
breakfast beats out a box of
Twinkees any day (or night).

preparations.
Best of all, the restaurant is
open 24 hours, perfect for the
night owl who wants a pleasant
alternative to greasy-spoons and
Safeway runs; clearly, pyramid
breakfast beats out a box of
Twinkees any day (or night).
Palo Alto is a community rich
in excellent, pricey restaurants
but unfortunately lacking in
places offering less-than-fine
dining. For a quick bite at a rea
sonable price, McDonald's or
some other fast-food joint often
seems to be the only local option
(apart from the overrated greasy
spoon University Creamery,
where the great milkshakes un
fortunately cannot compensate
for the lousy service and the mar
ginal fare).
After exhaustive searching,
however, Dining Out has uncov
ered several inexpensive-yet
classy coffee shops that offer tasty
meals in pleasant settings at rea
sonable expense — the prices are
higher than a visitor might ex
pect, as getting out of any Stan
ford area restaurant for under $7
total is nothing short of
miraculous.
But, for the discount diner,
several eateries eagerly fill the
value void and present the closest
semblance to a bargain available
in the area.
Ken's
888 El Camino Heal
Menlo Park
324-0217
Without a doubt, Ken's may be
one of the best coffee shops in
California. Boasting a sizeable
menu (with photos!) and tasty fare
at every meal, this cafe remains
a local favorite for a good reason.
The self-proclaimed "House of
Pancakes" earns its name at
breakfast time with a wide array
of exotic flapjacks — special Bel
gian and Apple pancakes that take
extra time to prepare. Ligonberry
(whatever this fruit is) and
strawberry-filled thin cakes are
equally tasty, as are the run-of
the-mill waffles and ordinary pan
cakes.
The price tag is greater than
Denny's, but the breakfast you
get is well worth the charge.
Lunch and dinner are also de
licious and inexpensive to boot.

Ken's offers a dozen burgers and
sandwiches that are all quite
tasty, in quantities that are
definitely filling.
For a nicer dinner, a host of
moderately priced entrees await,
ranging from the standard spag
hetti in meat sauce to fried
chicken and shrimp, or salad as
well as a choice of potato, the
meals are as reasonable as they
are taste-tempting.
As if all this were not enough,
Ken's also features splendid home
made pies, not quite as good as
Grandma's but good desserts
nonetheless.

expense.

Sandy's Kitchen
153 Stanford Shopping Center
I'alo Alto
324-3742
If the clock has struck 7 p.m.
and your stomach is grumbling,
don't head over to the Stanford
Mall in search of a cheap sit-down
meal. For an earlier dinner as
well as breakfast and lunch, how
ever, Sandy's Kitchen is open and
eager to please.
The food is standard coffee-shop
fare, cooked on a grill in open
sight behind the long counter.
From eggs and hashbrowns to
burgers and tuna melts, the cooks
quickly and consistently create
good food. The barbeque beef
sandwich is especially delicious,
with just enough tangy barbegue
sauce to dip th? fries.
The dinners are also satiating,
especially the fried chicken. But
even if poultry in oil is not your
favorite, Sandy's cooks are sure
to have something in their reper
toire suitable for your taste.
Service, however, is what really
sets this place apart. From the
kindly old gentleman who seats
the customers and takes their
cash (no checks or credit cards
accepted, thank you) to the
friendly waitresses, all the em
ployees seem interested if not in
tent on making each meal a pleas
ant one to expereince as well as
consume.
Lyon's
4298 El Camino Real
Los Altos
941-4204
First off, don't let the mailing
address fool you. As the pleasant
lady who answered the phone as
sured me, this is in fact the Lyon's
just down the street from the
Hyatt Palo AJto and only a few
miles from campus.
Pyramid breakfast alone is

worth the drive. Served from mid
night to 11 a.m. every weekday,
the pyramid allows you to chooses
as many breakfast items as you
like for $.80 each (with a three
item minimum). This is an en
tirely flexible build-your-own
breakfast which allows you to
frugally splurge if the french toast
and the eggs and the hash browns
and the bacon and .. .
The remaining portions of the
menu, though not as magnificent,
are also tasty and diverse. Lyon's
also serves a mean barbeque beef,
served on a grilled french bun
with the option for steak fries to
dip in the surplus spicy sauce.
The shrimp feast is another good
meal, as is the fish and chips.
And if American cuisine is not
enough, Lyon's serves a bevy of
Mexican dishes that are tasty even
if they deviate from traditional
preparations.
Best of all, the restaurant is
open 24 hours, perfect for the
night owl who wants a pleasant
alternative to greasy-spoons and
Safeway runs; clearly, pyramid
breakfast beats out a box of
Twinkees any day (or night).
