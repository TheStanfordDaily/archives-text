Irish folk music may be the buried trea
sure of music.
Hidden deep within the international sec
tion of most music stores (a realm infre
quently traveled by most shoppers), only
enthusiasts and Van Morrisson fans ever
seem to discover the richness and humor
this genre exudes, similar in content and
slightly in style to the American folk music
that seems to be back on the rise.
In Irish folk circles, perhaps the inter
nationally best known of these apparent
unknowns is Tommy Makem and the
Clancy Brothers, an intermittent partner
ship that has yielded a number of out
standing records and countless enjoyable
concerts.
Conveying a chemistry that transcends
the aid of biological ties, the band members
musically and comically play off of each
other constantly and uniquely. If ever a
band flourished in a live setting, Makem
and Clancy is the band, exciting fans with
the levity of its drinking songs and amazing
them with the beauty and meaning of their
ballads.
"Live at the National Concert Hall"
showcases the group at its best. Opening
with "Wish 1 Was A Hunting" and "Bonnie
Highland [pronounced hee-land, by the
way] laddie," a jocular one-two punch, the
record provides over 45 minutes of pure
pleasure.

Other classics performed at that concert,
fortunately recorded for posterity, include
the vivacious "The Liar" and "Whatever
You Say, Say Nothing" as well as the
melodic "Dandelion Wine." As in all types
of folk music, the lyrics carry the tune,
and each of these gems is no exception.

an Irish variety of yodelling that text can

There is no one who can tell a lie like me
You can search until you 're tired
You won't find a better liar
I've been lying since the dawn of history
Not brilliant or insightful, granted, but
the words are fun and fitting for a song
you can easily picture a drunken braggart
singing in a pub.
The tone does sometimes get serious and
reflective, especially when Makem steps up
to the mike alone and plays one of his
somber songs. Reminiscent of the classic
folk songs as well as the tunes of Tracy
Chapman, Makem enraptures the audience
with his simple guitar offsetting poignant
lyrics portraying tragic events in common
people's lives.
At the National Concert Hall show, "The

Orchard" was Makem's ballad of choice, a
soulful song depicting the troubles of a
poor farmer driven from his land, the farm
where he was born, because he could no
longer pay the bills. In an U.S. age where
the exact same thing has been happening

on our own soil, the song has particular
meaning.
Even better is the hard-to-find classic
"Waltzing Mathilda," arguably Makem's
best song. Written after a trip to Australia,
the song is a sensitive portrayal of WWI
soldiers from that country who were sent
into battles of hideous .carnage like the
infamous Gallipoli. Just like the film titled
after the battle. Makem's tune is an overt,
anti-war statement masked in the beauty
of his art.

In all, the concert record is utterly in
fectious, instantly addicting almost any lis
tener to Makem and Clancy's exciting folk
style. To satisfy the pangings for more
material, "The Makem and Clancy Collec
tion" and "Reunion" fulfill the need.

"Collection" is just what its title suggests,
a greatest hits album. Starting with the
funny "All God's Creatures (Have Got A
Place In the Choir)," the record unleashes
40 minutes worth of audio excitement upon
the audience's ecstatic ears.
Another concert album, "Reunion"
marks one of the more recent reformations
of the broken band (the current status of
Makem and Clancy). The recorded concert
was a happy reunion indeed, resulting in
a musical extravaganza.
