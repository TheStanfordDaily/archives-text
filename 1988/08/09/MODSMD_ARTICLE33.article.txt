The Primitives
"Lovely"
With the domestic debut release by the Primi
tives, America has at its disposal the latest one-hit
wonder.
Fueled by "Crash," the lead-off song that has
reached the top of the British singles chart, "Love
ly" is a 14-song bunch of blandness, uninventive
ness and sameness that will quickly find itself
accumulating cobwebs in the dark recesses of
many listeners' collections, right alongside
Animotion and Heaven 17.
At first glance, "Lovely" appears to be the
music value of the year, squeezing a baker's
dozen plus one on a single album, without even
tacking a few extra dollars on to the price. From
the industry known to release a 12" single with
extra tracks to weasel more cash out of customers,
this seems an altruistic departure.
Listening to the record, however, quickly dis
pels these delusions. No tune seems to span
longer than three minutes (and even the longer
ones do not carry on much longer), resulting in

a surprisingly short series of vignettes.
In all fairness, "Crash" is a pretty good tune,
uplifting and be-boppy enough to cure even the
deepest case of the blues. Lead singer Tracey's
spirited vocals fit in perfect with the upbeat
theme and the slick instrumental.
The problems arise when the band attempts
to sustain these pleasant few moments for the
duration of the album without much variety or
invention. The remaining songs sound as if they
were made from the same formula, replete of
any change either musically or lyrically.
Not surprisingly, the effect is not the most
pleasing. The material suffices as laundry music,
just perfect for motivating the listener to perform
household chores but not interesting when time
permits a careful listening. After the third song,
the tunes become repetitive and old-hat — even
the songs like "Shadow" that attempt to adjust
the tone with exotic synthesizer tracks fail to
add any excitement.
The Primitives are fortunate enough to possess
that modicum of talent required to make a hit
song. Unfortunately, they lack the inspiration to
go beyond it, making "Lovely" an album un
worthy of its complementary title.
