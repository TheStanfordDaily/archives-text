When you read the words "This is a bad
place for a diet" emblazoned on the door
of Max's Opera Cafe, you laugh. When you
read the menu, you realize truer words
were never spoken.

"Big" is a good adjective to describe
Max's — a big menu and even bigger por
tions, served in a cavernous room with
amazingly high ceilings. Not to worry, how
ever, quantity does not overwhelm quality
at Max's.
One of the first things you notice when
you enter the beautiful brass and panelled
restaurant is the dessert case. Max's is well
known for its sweets (which come in as
large of portions as the dinners).
Judging from the plates we saw on
nearby tables, my friend and 1 decided to

skip appetizers in favor of the main course.
Max's offers a wide variety of pasta,
chicken, fish, meat and vegetable entrees,
with daily fish specials like snapper or
swordfish. In addition, there are hot and
cold sandwiches (several of them New York
deli style) as well as dinner salad platters.
We ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad
(labelled as one of Max's favorites) and the
San P rancisco Salad — bay shrimp on let
tuce with fresh vegetables.
While we waited, our waitress brought
a basket of fresh bread which we did choose
to indulge in. There was a deliciously
seasoned onion bread and a amazingly
chewy rye. A New Yorker's dream come
true in California, the rye bread had a
crispy, thick crust, soft insides and just
the right amount of caraway seeds.
It's impossible to overlook the waitresses
and waiters in Max's for one simple reason:
they sing. That's right, not only do they
provide friendly and efficient service, but
they also perform, accompanied by piano.
We were treated to a variety of Broadway
show songs while we dined — our waitress
sang "Sunrise, Sunset" from "Fiddler on
the Roof. " All of the waiters and waitresses

had wonderful voices.
Our dinners arrived shortly and the>
were just as large as we thought they would
be. The Chinese Chicken Salad (which is
available in a small portion) was very good
— lightly spicy vegetables and crunchy
noodles topped with big chunks of tender
chicken.
The San Francisco salad was delicious
— a generous portion of cold cooked shrimp
topped mounds of shredded lettuce, which
had a tasty dressing (a Louie dressing came
on the side) — but not exactly what we
had expected. The "fresh vegetables"
turned out to be diced tomatoes, a roasted
red pepper, a pesto pasta salad and a
creamy coleslaw. Although the salads were
fine, they were really too much with the
shrimp.
The dessert menu resurfaced after din
ner. It is fabulous (as well as incredibly
decadent) with such choices as homemade
ice cream for sundaes or banana splits,
apple-cranberry cobblers, Rocky Road
brownies, a variety of cheesecakes (includ
ing chocolate chip!), Key Lime pie, the H 1
Layer Cookie," fresh fruit with zabaglione
and, of course, chocolate cake and apple pie.
