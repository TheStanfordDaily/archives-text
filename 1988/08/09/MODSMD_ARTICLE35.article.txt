# Childs' great voice lost in shaky songs
## 
### Darren Singer 
Toni Childs
"Union"
After listening to Toni Childs
new album "Union," it is clear
that one review would not suf
fice; rather, this album must
be broken down into its com
ponent parts, as the title is a
complete misrepresentation of
this album's disjointed nature.
First and foremost, Childs
has an incredible voice, rich in
texture and vibrant. Her voice
is a refreshing change of pace
from the antiseptic over
produced sound which is so
common in today's popular
music. The power of her vocals
captivates the audience and her
style kept their interest. This
woman has what it takes to be
one of the best — all she needs
to do is to find some decent
material.
The instrumentation also
shows signs of brilliance. The
first song on the album, "Don't
Walk Away," is powerful,
strong and just a lot of fun;

yes, it is commercial but pood
nonetheless.
Yet, the rest of the album
was regretably different. On its
own merits, it might have a
been passable effort for a lesser
artist; however, for Childs, the
material was too weak, and she
easily overpowered her accom
paniment. A dominant per
former such as Childs needs
equally powerful music to truly
be effective.
While the music did show
some kind of promise, the ac
companying words were just
plain awful. The lyrics were
about as subtle as "Bambi
Meets Godzilla" and as touch
ing as "Rambo III." Listening
to an artist as talented as
Childs singing these words is
like watching Sir Lawrence
Olivier in the lead role of "At
tack of the Killer Tomatoes"
— neither Childs nor the great
Sir Larry can succeed under
such conditions.
With this in mind, the album
must be considered a failure.
However, 1 will be waiting
patiently for Childs to find her
King Lear to play.
