"The Shouting Stage"
Joan Armatrading has certainly mellowed with
age. After switching over to A&M Records (a gen
erally melifluous label) from CBS, Armatrading has
seemingly abandoned the unabashedness of songs
like "I Love It When You Call Me Names" in favor
of a commercial jazzy style in line with vocalists
like A 1 Jarreau.
Not that this is a heinous crime â€” Jarreau re
mains one of music's biggest talents, a man who
hasn't released an unenjoyable song or album in
over a decade. However, easy listening is far from
Armatrading's usual stomping grounds and is
definitely a departure that may take some adjusting
for her die-hard fans.
Nonetheless, "The Shouting Stage" is a solidly
pleasant, if grossly mistitled, album. The music is
nice and relawng, performed by a host of talented
musicians (including a guest appearance by Mark
Knopfler, guitarist of Dire Straits, on two tracks),
and deftly complements the adequately interesting
lyrics (mostly on unrequited love). All in all, the
record is a finely crafted piece of pop, absolutely
innocuous and consumately marketable but hardly
earthshaking.
The 10-tune tuft embarks on its joyful, jilted
journey with "The Devil 1 Know," a good enough
song as any to select for the first single when the
time comes for the A&M execs to do this. A snappy,
jazzy jingle featuring a reasonable guitar solo by
performer/producer Armatrading, it quickly estab
lishes the mellow tone that characterizes the whole
album.
"Living For You" (the second song and a close
runner-up for the coveted single status) is equally

as enjoyable, maintaining the pizazz of "Devil" but
dropping the tempo a touch with acoustically aes
thetic effects. The sweet sounding trumpet of Guy
Barker augments the effort.
After slowing down a few more notches in "Did
I Make You Up" (Knopfler's first appearance), the
record changes little, providing mild and unengross
ing pieces of pleasantry set to soothe the soul. The
title track exemplifies the trend, utilizing the fluid
solo by Knopfler as support for the un
infecting instrumentals juxtaposed with the poten
tially inflammatory lyrics.
As easy listening goes, "Stage" is an above-average
attempt appealing to a wide range of musical tastes
as a gift for parents, the album strongly succeeds.
However, for the fan of classic, gritty Armatrad
ing, the record may well fall on disappointed ears.
