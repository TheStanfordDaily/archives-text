## Olympic hoopsters knock off NBA stars Lichti gets little playing time in win 
### Chris Fialko Senior staff writer 
PROVIDENCE, R.I. - Right
now Todd Lichti is living proof
that U.S. Olympic Coach John
Thompson runs his practices an
awful lot like boot camp.
Lichti, one of the 17 remaining
candidates for the 12-man team,
sports a military crew-cut, a large
bandage covering a black-and-blue
welt under his right eye and a
black flex-brace that protects his
bruised right knee-cap.
He answers questions, as most
of the players here do, with the
puzzled expression and unsure
voice of someone who is in the
midst of being brainwashed by
Thompson's "Georgetown sys
tem."
"It's hard to say how I'm doing
so far," Lichti said Sunday after
the Olympic team defeated a
squad of NBA players 90-82 here
in the opening contest of a nine
game exhibition tour. "Everyone
is still trying to learn the system."
For almost a month the Con
cord native and Stanford senior
has been sequestered in George
town, training with the likes of
Danny Manning, David Robinson,
Sean Elliott and J.R. Reid. The
players have two 2-hour practices
daily, along with perfunctory
meals and wake-up calls. Like
many other Washington D.C. res
idents, Coach Thompson is con
ducting a campaign; his, however,
is for gold in Seoul in September.
"It takes time to get used to

Coach's style," Lichti said. "It's
so much more fast-paced that it
almost becomes wild sometimes
and looks sloppy, and Coach ad
mits that. But he wants us to use
our quickness and athleticism to
wear other teams down."
In true military fashion,
Thompson plans to beat America's
international foes through fatigue
and attrition. But first Thompson
will use those two factors to
choose his final 12 iron men. It
seems that no one, including
Lichti, knows who is going to
make the team.
"I have played up and down.
You could say I haven't torn it
up, but I've done all right," Lichti
said. "I guess 1 need to be more
consistent. Everyone here is so
good and can do so many different
things, that it's tough to compare.
Coach says he doesn't want us
guessing what he's thinking, he
just wants us to play."
While Thompson says he
doesn't want his players guessing,
the fact that there are no set cut
dates — he can drop the axe at
any time — keeps the 17 young
men wondering. Only two players
played less than Lichti on Sunday,
but Lichti still wouldn't venture
a guess as to his status.
The Stanford team leaves next
week for a trip to the Fiji Islands
and Australia, and Lichti said he
would probably join them if he
got cut.
"But I don't anticipate getting
cut," he said. Lichti would like to
finish his tour of boot camp before
he travels. To Seoul.
