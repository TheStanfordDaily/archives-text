Snelson starts for
Raiders at linebacker
Surprise is the word that comes
to mind when talking about Eric
Snelson lately.
The former standout tight end
for the Cardinal football team was
passed over in the NFL because
of an unexpectedly subpar senior
season. He only caught six passes
during his final college campaign.
Then he got a surprise call from
the Los Angeles Raiders asking
him to report to training camp

two weeks early.
Why? Because the Raiders had
a big surprise for Snelson: They
planned on converting him back
to the position he last played in
his junior year of high school, line
backer.
"I still think I can contribute
at tight end," a disappointed Snel
son said. "But I signed a contract
and that's where they want me."
The Raiders made the move be
cause they are strong at tight end
with Trey Junkin and Andy
Parker backing up Todd Chris
tensen, one of the best in the AFC.
I hey are thin at linebacker
though where Matt Millen is hold
ing out and his backup Jamie
Kimmel is out with an injured
knee.
As if wonders never cease, Snel
son has looked so good in work
outs that Raider Coach Mike
Shanahan said, "Eric Snelson has
been the surprise of training
camp."
He was so impressive, in fact,
that Snelson started the Raiders
first preseason game against the
San Francisco 49ers.
It should come as no surprise
that Snelson played well. On the
field for the entire first half, and
on the special teams for most of
the game, Snelson had four solo
tackles and one sack.
"I did some good things, but I
saw some bad things. I guess
that's what it's all about," he said.

Baty signs on with
San Francisco 49ers
In other football news, Greg
Baty, the man Snelson replaced
at tight end has signed on with
the San Francisco 49ers.
Baty, one of John Paye's favor
ite targets in his days at Stanford,
rejoins his once and perhaps fu
ture quarterback in San Fran
cisco.
Baty was drafted by the New
England Patriots out of college
and played for the Los Angeles
Rams last year. He is given a good
chance of making the 49ers final
roster because of his ability to
learn the team's system quickly.
Another former Stanford star,
Darrin Nelson, is still holding out
with the Minnesota Vikings. The
six-year pro is asking the Vikings
to renegotiate his $400,000 a year
contract.
The Vikings, the NFL's most
frugal franchise, have so far
declined Nelson's request. Nelson
has threatened to retire and has
asked for a trade to a team that
plays on natural grass.
Men's hoops will
travel down under
The men's basketball team will
try to do it down under next week

as they head for Australia Aug
13.
The team will be making stops
in the Fiji Islands, Melbourne and
Sydney before returning to the
United States Aug. 31.
The Cardinal will take on teams
from the Australian National Bas
ketball league where former Stan
ford standout Earl Koberlein
plays. The team may also fell the
Australian Olympic team which
includes a teammate of theirs,
sophomore Andrew Vlahov.
Burgin upset about
Olympic snubbing
Elise Burgin is no longer a
member of the U.S. Olympic ten
nis team through no fault of her
own.
The former Stanford star was
dropped from the team by the
United States Tennis Association
last week to make room for Chris
Evert. After initially declining,
Evert decided she would represent
the United States in Seoul this
September.
1 he USTA issued a release say
ing that Burgin had withdrawn
from the team because she was
not recovered from arthroscopic
knee surgery. The release was
news to everyone, including Bur
gin.
"I had no knowledge of the con

tents of that release before it was
issued," Burgin said at a news
conference. "As far as I'm con
cerned, I've fully recovered from
the surgery."
The USTA claimed that the
firm that represents Burgin, Ad
vantage International of Washing
ton, D.C. approved the announce
ment. A spokesman for Advantage,
however, denied that was the case.
Despite her anger at the USTA,
Burgin had kind words for Evert.
"Chris and I have been close
friends for a long time, and every
thing between the two of us is
fine," Burgin said.
Track program hires
Toledo women's coach
Stanford has done a lot to
replace Dorothy Doolittle on the
track stafT. Doolittle left Stanford
to take the head coaching job of
the women's track team at Ten
nessee.
Betsy Riccardi, formerly of the
University of Toledo, has an
nounced her intention to join the
Stanford staff for the upcoming
year.
At Toledo, Riccardi led her team
to a 6-0 record in dual meets in
the past year. Under her tutelage
in 1988, the team smashed 20
school records.
