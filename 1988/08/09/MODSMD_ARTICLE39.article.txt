# Gravitating down under: Stanford in Australia
## 
### Mica Martin 
Although few people know about it, Stan
ford has ties to Australia that run deep.
Memories of Leland Stanford's familial
and financial links to the country are cur
rently being resurrected as more and more
students elect to travel down under, finding
asylum with enthusiastic alumni who live
in that country.
In July, for instance, 62 members of the
Stanford Rand traveled to Australia and
spent two weeks performing at the World's
Fair in Melbourne, the Australian National
University and Sydney University.
Enjoying the great beer and king prawns
during his stay in Australia, junior Cam
Mitchner, an alto saxophonist, said the Aus
tralians greeted them with a warm wel
come. In fact, the Rand appeared on the
front page of a local newspaper after they
performed in the water at an Australian
Sea World in traditional Rand style.
Mitchner said the Rand was chosen to
perform at the World's Fair because fair
organizers thought Stanford's musical
group typifies the California lifestyle.
"They think we portray the California
style of living better than other California
Rands, like the USC Trojan Rand," he said.
During their stay, the Stanford alumni
club in Australia arranged most activities
for the Rand. The Australian alumni con
nection is "very strong," according to
Mitchner.
Strong indeed, according to Carolyn Man

ning, director of the Alumni Association's
clubs and classes. Describing Stanford's
Aussies as "very enthusiastic," Manning
said there are now 131 Stanford alums
living in Australia. The club is trying to
establish a scholarship that would allow an
Australian student to do graduate studies
here.
This year, eight undergraduate students
and 48 graduate students from Australia
will enroll at Stanford.
While Australians are flying half-way
around the world to attend Stanford, stu
dents here have a real interest in going
down under, according to John Pearson,
director of Rechtel International Center.
"The opportunities are not keeping up with
the interest," he said.
But Pearson pointed out that Bechtel
does offer information on several other
college programs for students to study in
Australia as well as a pilot program de
signed to locate jobs for students in
Australia.
One of Stanford's strongest connections
with Australia is through alumnus William
Lane â€” the U.S. Ambassador to Australia.
Lane and his wife Jean were instrumen
tal in establishing an exhibit now on display
at Stanford that salutes this year's
Australian Bicentennial.
On display in Green Library until Oct.
8, the exhibit gives a view of Australia
from the Stanford perspective.
Rare Australian books and pamphlets are
part of the display, which highlights some

of Welton Stanford's personal letters and
photographs.
The younger brother of Leland Stanford
Sr., Welton Stanford went off to find his
fortune in Australia in 1859 while Leland
Stanford stayed in California to establish
this University. Through mining and in
dustry, Welton Stanford became a wealthy
man there and one of Stanford's leading
benefactors.
Relieving that Australian education "was
too elitest," Welton Stanford donated

money to the University in hopes of estab
lishing a school for "a rising middle class,"
according to University Archivist Roxanne
Nilan.
"It is a great opportunity to highlight
one of Stanford's more interesting collec
tions," Nilan said of the exhibit.
When the exhibit went on display July
29, Australian Prime Minister Robert
Hawke sent a telegram to Stanford, prais
ing the exhibit.
