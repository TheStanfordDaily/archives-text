# Newhall does it all
## Award-winning juggler 
### Sally Hamaker 
Even on a campus filled with
overachievers, Katie Newhall is
a surprise. Outwardly warm
and relaxed, the recent winner
of the Gores Award for Teach
ing Excellence leads a life that
would spell burnout for other
people.
A fourth-year medical stu
dent at Stanford, Newhall re
ceived the Gores Award at this
spring's graduation ceremony.
The award, one of Stanford's
most prestigious, was based on
her performance during her
nine-quarter teaching assistant

position for the human biology
core curriculum.
Newhall herself recieved a
bachelor's in human biology
from Stanford in 1985 with a
concentration in psychobiologv.
She entered Stanford Medical
School the following fall, and
has just completed her third
year. She plans to spend three
more years at Stanford, finish
ing her medical degree and
working on research.
Unlike most of her fellow
medical students, however,
Newhall began medical school
with more than a bachelor's
degree. She had already started a
family as an undergraduate.
She met Nick Ferguson when
they were both freshmen in Don
ner House and they married in
the summer after their sophomore
year. The couple moved into Es
condido Village in the fall and had
a son, Andy, when they were only
juniors. They have lived in the
same apartment ever since, and
plan to stay there for three more
years.
"It sounds crazy, but the timing
worked out perfectly," Newhall
explained. "It is so much more
difficult when they are small —
I wouldn't have had time during
med school to go through those
first few years."
Needless to say, Newhall and
Ferguson had an undergraduate
experience that is certainly un
common at Stanford. "When we
were both in school, it was mo"*e
fifty-fifty. We'd stagger our
courses," Ferguson said. "She'd
have a 9:00 class, I'd have a 10:00,
and I'd ride in to meet her with
Andy on the back of my bike. It
was pretty easy in school — we
were much more flexible."
Ferguson has a bachelor's in
political science, and a master's
from Stanford's Food Research
Institute in applied economics.
Now he works as a certified public
accountant in San Francisco.
Somehow, the two manage to
design their schedules carefully
enough to allow time for work,
studying and their family.
"I try to make it so that (when)
I have to be somewhere I try to
do it during the daytime so there
aren't any conflicts at night,"
Newhall said.
Newhall's time is well
accounted for, to say the least.
Besides being a full-time medical
student, as well as a teaching as
sistant, she also does research at
the Veteran's Administration
Hospital in Palo Alto on exercise
physiology and bone metabolism.
To that end, she devotes 20 to 25
hours a week during the year and
30 to 40 hours a week during the
summer.

But stop; there's more. After
realizing during her second year
of medical school that she was
"ready to play a competitive
sport," Newhall joined the wom
en's lacrosse team as the lone
graduate student.
Admitting that she is "the
Mom" Newhall is also the team's
co-captain. "When you have some
form of exercise, you have a lot
more energy," she said. "By get
ting a workout in the afternoon,
I can get more done in the eve
ning."
She said athletics have always
played an important part in her
life. A high school basketball
player, Newhall plays pick-up bas
ketball during her lunch hour in
the summer and fall — the off
season is reserved for lacrosse. "I
wasn't tall enough or fast enough
to play basketball in college. But
basketball and lacrosse are similar
in a lot of ways," she said.
Her ability to rouse enthusiasm
in others also works wonders in
the classroom, according to both
professors and students. The pro
fessors who nominated her for the
undergraduate teaching award
said her confidence and determi
nation make her a natural
teacher.
Human Biology Prof. Bill Dur
ham, who teaches in the core, was
one of two professors who recom
mended Newhall for the Gores
award. He praised not only her
abilities and accomplishments but
also her upbeat approach to life.
"For nine consecutive quarters
as a teaching assistant, she never
complained, never let up and she
did it with the most enthusiastic
and friendly and high-spirited at
titude."
"Second, what is special about
Katie is that somehow she juggled
it so that she was always there.
She was a real presence as a teach
ing assistant — not a disappearing
act. Third, was her ability to work
really well with the students, the
other teaching assistants and the
faculty. She communicates well at
all three levels."
Of course, Newhall's teaching
ability was the main factor in her
winning of the award. According

to junior Daniel Vatanaviggun, a
Human Biology major who was in
Newhall's discussion section, she
was one of the most popular
teaching assistants in the core.
"She would make up lecture out
lines," Vatanaviggun said, "none
of the other TA's did that."
Durham concurred. "Somehow
she can really impart an enthusi
asm that makes it real."
Craig Heller, the other Human
Biology professor who nominated
Newhall, gave a glowing review
of her contribution to the Human
Biology core.
"The students really liked
her. . . . Her generosity of spirit
was always upbeat. She never
made you feel as if she was doing
it all — but she was. She always
does more than her share but is

never quick to take the credit for
it."
Newhall herself said she was
enthusiastic about her contact
with Durham and Heller, as well
as other faculty members. "I got
the chance to work with people I
had idolized as an undergrad when
I took the core, and I got to see
that they are people, too."
But Newhall's favorite aspect
of the job was working with stu
dents. "That's the most fun. The
most rewarding part of it is seeing
lightbulbs go on in students' heads
. . . when you can make a concept
click."
As Durham said, Newhall
doesn't make a habit of flaunting
her talents and accomplishments.
Rather, she gives credit to the
character and variety in the core.

"The beauty of the Human Bi
ology core is that it is so diverse,"
she said. "For most people, if it
is the first time they've seen these
concepts, it is usually interesting."
When Newhall received the
award at commencement, four
and-a-half-year-old Andy was her
biggest fan. Ferguson said Andy
sat on his shoulders during the
ceremony.
"We spent about 10 minutes
trying to look for his Mom in the
crowd," said Andy's father.
"When Andy finally saw her, he
started waving as hard as he could
and saying 'Hi Mom! Hi Mom!' I
don't often feel proud, but at that
moment I felt really proud," Fer
guson said.
Newhall is a proud mother her
self. "Most of the time, it is so
much fun to watch him (Andy),"
Newhall said. "After about one
year, a little personality just
develops. Being privy to seeing
that happen is probably the most
rewarding thing about being a
mother."
Andy spends time at the Stan
ford Children's Center while his
parents are at work during the
daytime. A community center, the
childcare facility requires that
parents put in a specified amount
of time caring for the children
each month.
"It's a nice set-up. I feel very
comfortable having him there,"
Newhall said.
Ferguson said the biggest prob
lem with their tight schedules is
finding time for each other. "The
hardest thing is making time for
Katie and me. We are working on
making sure we spend time to
gether. For instance, we don't
cook anymore . . . we 'meal
prepare.' Everything has to be
quick."
Newhall has developed her own
ways of dealing with her hectic
lifestyle. "I try not to think about
other things when I'm doing
whatever I'm doing."
Her husband said she has
learned to evaluate her commit
ments well. "She's changed mostly
in that she's not as uptight any
more. She realizes that she can't
do everything."
