Even on a campus filled with
overachievers, Katie Newhall is
a surprise. Outwardly warm
and relaxed, the recent winner
of the Gores Award for Teach
ing Excellence leads a life that
would spell burnout for other

A fourth-year medical stu
dent at Stanford, Newhall re
ceived the Gores Award at this
spring's graduation ceremony.
The award, one of Stanford's

working on research.
