For the first time ever, Stanford will
allow community members to take courses
on campus, and phone calls for early en
rollment in the program are already pouring
in.
In the last month, over 200 interested
community residents and staff members
have sought to enroll in six new classes to
be offered this fall in Stanford's new Con
tinuing Studies Program, according to .Jeff
Wachtel, administrative director of the pro
gram.
The new program is open to members
of the community including all staff and
employees of Stanford. Course offerings in

the program will include history, science
and literature and will be taught by Stan
ford faculty.
Classes were chosen based on interest
from the faculty, Wachtel said.
The only requirement for enrollment is
a high school diploma or its equivalent.
Tuition will be $200 to $400 per course,
depending on the units. Staff and employee
members are entitled to a 20 percent dis
count.
Wachtel said he feels most of the people
enrolling will do so for personal enrichment.
Classes will not lead to a degree and Wach
tel said that few undergraduate and grad
uate students will enroll in the courses.

"We believe it would be of interest to
the members of the community," Wachtel
said. "The faculty wanted a balanced cur
riculum."
Students in the program will not have
access to all University libraries but will
be limited to borrowing materials from
Meyer Library, he added.

Classes will meet on alternate days of
the week beginning at 7 p.m. and ending
at either 8:50 or 9:50 p.m., he said.
Beginning in September, course offerings
will include: masterpieces of literature; fic
tion writing; modern black politics;
neurobiology; a history class on the ancient
Olympics and a course on views of childhood.
