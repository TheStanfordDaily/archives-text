# Ethnic deans seek full-time duty
## Directors of minority student centers say two jobs are too much 
### Soeun Park 
In response to the call last week
for a full-time ethnic dean in the
Chicano/Latino community, all
four of Stanford's ethnic deans
said they support having full-time
ethnic deans if their respective
communities want them.
Asst. Deans of Campus Affairs
Keith Archuleta, Jiin Larimore,
.Julian Low and Juan Yniguez said
yesterday that it is difficult for
them to fully serve their respec
tive ethnic communities in less
than a full-time capacity.
As assistant deans, all four
serve as directors of their respec
tive ethnic cultural centers. Yet
Archuleta, Larimore and Yniguez

also serve as residential deans,
while Low has a second non-
University job in addition to serv
ing as an ethnic dean.
They say the demands of
wearing multiple hats can be
"overwhelming.
"Both positions are considered
'professional positions' so you're
paid for the job you do, not the
hours that you put into it," said
Archuleta, director of the Black
Community Service Center. Ar
chuleta, whose position is cur
rently half-time, said he some
times spends 60 to 80 hours a
week trying to do both jobs.
Two weeks ago, the directorship
of the Black Community Services
Center was expanded to a full-time

position and Archuleta said he
hopes he will remain as the di
rector in that capacity.
Asian American students also
asked for a full-time director dur
ing the past school year but were
denied that request. Instead, the
University increased the one
year-old deanship to a three
quarter time position.
Last week, members of Stan
ford's Chicano/Latino student or
ganization, MEChA, held a press
conference to announce their
demand for a full-time dean.
Larimore said he would support
the request for a full-time dean
in the Native American commu-
