# Ethnic deans seek full-time duty
## Directors of minority student centers say two jobs are too much 
### Soeun Park 
In response to the call last week
for a full-time ethnic dean in the
Chicano/Latino community, all
four of Stanford's ethnic deans
said they support having full-time
ethnic deans if their respective
communities want them.
Asst. Deans of Campus Affairs
Keith Archuleta, Jiin Larimore,
.Julian Low and Juan Yniguez said
yesterday that it is difficult for
them to fully serve their respec
tive ethnic communities in less
than a full-time capacity.
As assistant deans, all four
serve as directors of their respec
tive ethnic cultural centers. Yet
Archuleta, Larimore and Yniguez

also serve as residential deans,
while Low has a second non-
University job in addition to serv
ing as an ethnic dean.
They say the demands of
wearing multiple hats can be
"overwhelming.
"Both positions are considered
'professional positions' so you're
paid for the job you do, not the
hours that you put into it," said
Archuleta, director of the Black
Community Service Center. Ar
chuleta, whose position is cur
rently half-time, said he some
times spends 60 to 80 hours a
week trying to do both jobs.
Two weeks ago, the directorship
of the Black Community Services
Center was expanded to a full-time

position and Archuleta said he
hopes he will remain as the di
rector in that capacity.
Asian American students also
asked for a full-time director dur
ing the past school year but were
denied that request. Instead, the
University increased the one
year-old deanship to a three
quarter time position.
Last week, members of Stan
ford's Chicano/Latino student or
ganization, MEChA, held a press
conference to announce their
demand for a full-time dean.
Larimore said he would support
the request for a full-time dean
in the Native American commu-
nity if it becomes an issue but
said "it is not a high priority yet."
Larimore said 60 percent of his
time is spent as director of the
American Indian Cultural Center
and 40 percent is spent in his post
as residential dean.
All four deans said they are con
sidered to be both spokespersons
and University experts for their
respective ethnic communities.
"We're called upon as resource
people knowledgeable of Asian
American cultural issues and the
needs of Asian American stu
dents," said Low, adviser to the
Asian American Activities Center.
He acknowledged that this is a
"role he should play" but said he
does not have enough time to do
as much as he would like.
"The time and energy drain (ot
doing both jobs) can be over
whelming," said Yniguez, admin
istrative director of El Centro
Chicano. His position is also half
time. Yniguez said he is the per
son identified by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs office as the one stu

dents should seek out with con
cerns about the Chicano/Latino
community.
In addition, all four said their
problems are compounded by in
adequate staffing, funding and
space for office support.
Yniguez said all residential
deans must respond to crisis sit
uations in addition to maintaining
day-to-day operations. But he said
this is more difficult for the ethnic
deans because they lack the sup
port staff upon which other deans
can rely in such situations.
"It is hard not to start thinking
that maybe the University set us
up to fail by not providing ade
quate funding. .Archuleta said.
"If the University really wants us
to succeed, they should give us
the same things as other depart
ments."
Responding to the view that ad
ministrators do not give ethnic
deans full-time positions because
they do not want to "marginalize"
their positions as exclusively eth
nic, all four said creating a full

towards creating institutional
support for minorities at Stan
