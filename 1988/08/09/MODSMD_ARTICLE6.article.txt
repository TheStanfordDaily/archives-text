# Campus crowded with felines

The cat's out of the hag — and on the Stanford
campus.
Thousands of felines are roaming wild on campus,
according to local cat authorities. And though they
are winning the hearts of some, other community
members claim that many of the campus cats are
vicious and carry parasites and fleas.
This summer Crane Pest Control has captured
more than 100 cats on campus, according to Hay
Busley, cat catcher for Crane. Crane sends the cats
to the Humane Society where they are either
adopted or put to sleep.
Describing them as "little tigers," Busley said
many of Stanford's cats are "wild and unhandle
ahle." There are "easily in the thousands of adult
cats" living in the shrubbery, trailers and buildings,
he said.
While students, faculty and staff members con
tinue to adopt many of them, the feline population
is still out of control, according to Busley.
Fed sporadically and left unspayed, the cats are
"continually reproducing." When their benefactors
go away for summer break they are left to starve,
he said.
Although the cat population seems to have grown
exponentially this summer, no one knows for sure
what has caused the population boom. Instead, most

people are trying to cope with the
symptoms.
According to Busley, problems
arise when cats carry fleas into
the student residences. Worse
still, they often die under student
residences creating a stench, Bus
ley said.
Concerned residents are "not
doing cats a favor by putting out
food," he added, explaining that
sporadic feeding keeps the cats
alive but allows them to keep mul
tiplying out of control.
Despite her own love for cats,
Assistant Lands Manager Diane
Paulson admitted that many of
the campus cats have become too
vicious even to adopt.
In the past two years, Paulson
has taken home 10 cats and

adopted two. One of Paulson's co
workers tried to follow her exam
ple by also taking home a cat. The
co-worker was "thrashed on the
back of her head" and needed
stitches after trying to put the
animal in her car, according to
Paulson.
Despite a University residence
agreement that prohibits pets in
all residences and calls for the
"immediate termination of oc
cupancy" of any student resident
who is keeping a pet, Asst. Direc
tor of Row Facilities Keith Archu
leta said the policy rarely needs
to be enforced.
Unless the problem is "exacer
bated" most students will not lose
their housing Archuleta said, add
ing that the policy exists for
health and sanitary reasons.
When Res Ed discovers a pet
living in University housing they
help students locate new homes

for the animals, he said. But cats
are continuing to find homes for
themselves in University housing.
For example, a litter of kittens
was found under the Beta Theta
Pi Fraternity house this summer,
according to Tim McGuire, a
carpenter in Operations and Main
tenance.
In the spring, members of a
Stanford sorority left two cats in
a basket at the doorstep of the
Beta house. Although nobody
seemed to be caring for them, the
two cats soon multiplied to a litter
of about seven or eight, said senior
Andrew Leary.
Live-in cats have also been
spotted at Grove Mayfield. When
How Facilities threatened to ex
terminate them, Grove residents
used house funds to buy flea col
lars and also had them neutered
and spayed, according to recent
graduate Karin Vaughey.
