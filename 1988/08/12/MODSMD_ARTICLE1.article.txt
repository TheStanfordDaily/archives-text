# Stanford wins big in NCAA drug-testing case
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
In a sweeping victory for Stan
ford, a Santa Clara County judge
on Wednesday exempted all Cal
ifornia athletes in the NCAA —
including football and basketball
players — from mandatory drug
testing, culminating well over a
year's worth of deliberations.
"The NCAA may not declare
any athlete ineligible or take puni
tive action against such athlete
for failure to comply with or par
ticipate in the NCAA drug testing
policy," Superior Court Judge
Conrad Rushing wrote in a 28-
page ruling.
The ruling also warned that the
NCAA could not "discriminate
against Stanford" for refusing to
administer the organization's
policy.
In January 1987, Stanford
diver Simone LeVant, filed a law
suit against the NCAA, protesting
that the drug-testing program vi
olated her right of privacy under
the California constitution.
LeVant graduated that spring but
in October of this year soccer
player Jennifer Hill and football
player Barry McKeever took up
her cause.
Backed by the University, the

student athletes sought a court
injunction to force the NCAA to
scrap its drug-testing policy which
they called embarassing and
humiliating. The policy bans the
use of 3,000 different substances
— ranging from caffeine and
steroids to heroin.
Although Rushing granted a
preliminary injunction in Decem

ber that barred random testing
in all but two college sports, he
said there was some evidence
showing that drug abuse existed
among athletes in football and
basketball.
But Wednesday's ruling con
cluded that the "NCAA's evidence

was wholly insufficient to support
drug testing in any sport," accord
ing to University lawyer Debra
Zumwalt.
Calling the verdict a "sweeping
victory," Zumwalt said Rushing
was convinced college athletes "do
not abuse drugs to any extent."
NCAA attorneys said they have
not had a chance to examine the
decision thoroughly and refused
to comment on Rushing's deci
sion.
But according to Zumwalt,
Rushing's ruling "vindicated"
Stanford's concern that the drug
testing policy unfairly singles out
athletes from the rest of the pop
ulation.
"Athletes are role models, but

they are not different from other
creative, talented persons. If we
can drug test athletes then why
not test Rhode Scholars as well,"
Stanford's Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said yesterday.
Praising the "completeness" of
Rushing's decision, Geiger said
Stanford now has an obligation
to change "the next generation of
legislation" and make others
realize that mandatory drug test
ing is wrong.
Geiger said he was unsure
whether other California schools
— including teams in the Pacific
10 Conference — would also aban
don the drug-testing policy.
But Hill, who was flocked by
television cameras and newspaper
reporters at a press conference in
front of the Athletic Department
yesterday, said she was deter
mined to convince other schools
to follow Stanford's example.

"It was a true victory. I couldn't
have asked for more. ... Now I
want other schools to look at this
decision and see that it's for
them," said Hill, a June graduate.
McKeever, a linebacker with
one year of college eligibility
remaining, said he wants to see
the NCAA funnel its money into
educating the public about the
dangers of steroid use.
"They should take the exorbi
tant funds from testing and put
it into helping people," McKeever
suggested. "What's gonna stop a
kid from taking drugs? Should he
wait until he's 40 and has a prob
lem with his liver?"
While the NCAA has spent over
$1 million on its drug-testing pro
gram this year, the organization
has spent only $200,000 on drug
education over the past five years.
