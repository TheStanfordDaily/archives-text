# House adopts tough anti-apartheid bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - The
Democratic-controlled House, in a
move that the Reagan adminis
tration contends will undermine
current peace talks in southern
Africa, yesterday passed a sweep
ing anti-apartheid bill that would
virtually halt trade and cancel all
U.S. investments in South Africa.
Supporters acknowledged that
the legislation, which passed the
House 244-132 with the support
of only two dozen Republicans,
was far more radical than the
sanctions that Congress imposed
against South Africa two years
ago over President Reagan's veto.
"This is a tough bill," said Rep.
Sam Gibbons, D-Fla. "This bill
comes as close to economic war
fare as you could get between two
nations."
In addition to requiring disin
vestment and embargoing trade,
the legislation would bar the De
partment of the Interior from is
suing new coal, gas or oil leases
to companies that do business
with South Africa. It also would
outlaw intelligence-sharing and
military cooperation between the
United States and the South
African government.
The sanctions are unlikely to
be enacted in their current form,
however. Not only has the presi
dent pledged to veto the measure,
but support for sanctions is much
weaker among Democrats in the
Senate.
In fact, the Senate currently has
no plans to consider a separate
sanctions bill before the final ad
journment of the 100 th Congress
in October. But House Democrats
hope to force a Senate vote on the
issue in September by attaching
the House-passed measure to leg
islation that is certain to be con
sidered in the other chamber.
Few issues have divided Repub
licans and Democrats in the
House as cleanly along party lines
as South African sanctions, and
Democrats view the split as one
that will help them and their pres
idential candidate, Michael S. Du
kakis, in the November election.
Polls show a majority of Ameri
cans support sanctions against
South Africa.
"Why is this bill being taken
up now?" asked Rep. William S.
Broomfield, R-Mich. "The answer
is simple. This is the Dukakis-
Jackson foreign policy initia
tive. . .timed to provide a boost to
his presidential campaign."
Republicans charged that the
Democrats had scheduled a vote
Thursday in a blatant effort to

embarrass the GOP and its cer
tain presidential nominee, Vice
President George Bush, on the eve
of the Republican National Con
vention, which opens Monday in
New Orleans.
Thirty-one Republicans were
not even present for the final vote
on the bill because many had al
ready departed for New Orleans.
"You picked on the one day when
the Republican Party was going
to be substantially weakened,"
said Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa.
Speaking for the Democrats,
Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., pri
mary author of the legislation,
denied any political motives in
raising the issue Thursday. He
said the measure was being voted
upon now because the 1986 sanc
tions legislation had failed to
bring an end to apartheid in South
Africa.
"We are not bringing this bill
to embarrass Republicans," he in
sisted. "We are here to free black
South Africa. This has nothing to
do with presidential politics."
Republicans opposed the mea
sure on grounds that it would
exact an economic toll on the vic
tims of apartheid — the blacks
who are employed by U.S.-owned
interests in South Africa.
"If you impose these sanctions,"
said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
"there is going to be a bloody
revolution and the blacks will not

this bill to embarrass
Republicans. We are

South Africa. This has
nothing to do with
presidential politics.'

win because they do not have the
weapons."
Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont.,
added that Democrats were "ad
vocating a scorched-earth policy
against a very Christian — and
I emphasize Christian — nation
which has been a long-standing
friend."
At the State Department,
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the timing of the vote also would
undermine U.S.-mediated talks
between South Africa, Angola and
Cuba over the political future of
southern Africa.
