# Movie about Christ's life draws massive protest
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — A singing,
chanting crowd estimated by
police at 25,000 marched in front
of the gates of Universal Studios
yesterday, protesting the film
company's release today of the
controversial movie "The Last
Temptation of Christ" in Los An
geles and eight other U.S. and
Canadian cities.
The protest — coordinated by
two Southern California radio sta
tions and a television station that
broadcast Christian religious pro
grams — represented the largest
outpouring yet against the movie.
Police termed the demonstration
especially large for a weekday.
Traffic backed up for miles on the
Hollywood Freeway and jammed
streets around the Universal com
plex for more than an hour.
The demonstrators, many of
whom carried placards, wooden
crosses and large Bibles, were or
derly and did not attempt to block
entrances to Universal and its par
ent MCA Inc.
"We need to stand up and say
what needs to be said," declared
Oliver Milton, a Lutheran of Los
Angeles who, like many, took the
day off from work to attend the
three-hour rally. "The Jesus
depicted in this movie is not the
Jesus of the Bible."

Milton, like nearly everyone at
the rally, had not seen the movie,
but based his opinion on portions
of an early script that have been
widely circulated by conservative
critics of the movie and on news
reports from critics and others
who have viewed the film.
The movie, based on the novel
by Greek author Nikos Kaz
antzakis, was directed by Martin
Scorsese and written by Paul
Schraeder. It focuses on Jesus'
"human side," depicting His
doubts about God's role for Him,
but also includes scenes of Jesus'
divine powers, including miracles.
Protesters of the film, mainly
evangelical Protestants and con
servative Catholics, have centered
their objections on Scorsese's
portrayal of Jesus as a weak, vacil
lating savior who struggles with
lustful temptations and on a scene
in which Jesus fantasizes that he
comes down from the cross and
has sex with Mary Magdalene
rather than be crucified.
Also Thursday, citing a land
slide of protests from Christian
groups, three threater chains with
80 screens in the Baltimore area
joined a growing number of
theaters that have said they will
not screen "The Last Tempta
tion."
