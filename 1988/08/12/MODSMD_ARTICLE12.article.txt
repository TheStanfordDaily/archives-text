The 250-foot mural that hangs from the wall of the Ecuadorian Congress met with the voiced
disapproval of Secretary of State George Shultz when he arrived there Wednesday for the
inauguration of Ecuador's new president. Shultz took particular offense at a section of the mural
that shows an eerie face looking out from under a World War II German helmet inscribed with
the letters CIA.
