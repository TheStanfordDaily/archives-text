Dukakis answers GOP criticism
FORT DIX, N.J. — Anticipating renewed Repub
lican charges that he is weak on defense and soft
on crime, Democratic presidential nominee Mi
chael Dukakis set out yesterday on a two-day
campaign swing intended to demonstrate the op
posite.
At a speech in New York, Dukakis said he was
for a stronger U.S. military "based on sound
planning and tough management, not wishful
thinking and blank checks."

And he returned to this
steamy, sprawling Army base
where he underwent basic train
ing in 1955 before serving 16
months as a teletype operator in
post-war Korea. In his visit to
Fort Dix and adjacent McGuire
Air Force Base, he fired three
shots from an M-16 on a rifle
range, toured a giant C-141 cargo
aircraft and practiced on a tank
simulator.

"We need strong, well-trained, properly
equipped forces," Dukakis said at the camp gate
afterward, as House Armed Services Chairman
Les Aspin, D-Wis., stood by his side.
Dukakis will fly to Jacksonville, Fla., Friday
to boast about his state's falling crime rates and
to blast what he has called the failure of the
Reagan administration to stem the flow of drugs
into the country, aides said.
The aides said they knew that Dukakis would
get "flogged" on defense issues at the Republican
National Convention in New Orleans next week.
But they defended him for offering far more

platitudes than specifics on how he would change
Pentagon operations or spending.
"He's going to look at what the needs are,"
said Madeleine Albright, a senior policy adviser.
"I know he wants to take a look at the Pentagon
books."
Bush talks to black supporters
WASHINGTON — Vice President George Bush,
stepping up attempts to broaden his appeal, told
a group of black supporters yesterday that he
would spend more time campaigning in black
neighborhoods this fall and make clear that "my
conservatism has nothing to do with racism."
But Bush refused to commit to placing a black
American on his Cabinet — as he has with Latino
voters — and he indicated he did not support a
move by blacks to insure more membership in
the Republican Party's leadership.

In a private meeting that
preceded the public session, black
supporters urged Bush to forge
an identity separate from the
Reagan administration and to
visit black neighborhoods during
the general election campaign.
Bush, who will claim his party's
nomination next week, only
rarely visited black neighbor
hoods during the primary battle.

Atlantic City Mayor James Usry said Bush was
told that black voters need to see "the real George
Bush, standing out as George Bush and not the
vice president under the mantle of President
Reagan."
