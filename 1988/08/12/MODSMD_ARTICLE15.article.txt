## Control campus cats 
### 
Students must stop
adopting strays

IT'S LATE at night and
you and a friend decide
to stroll over to Tresid
der for some fro yo. As you
leave your residence, you
practically trip over a cat,
then see several more
fleeing under parked cars as
you approach.
When you arrive at Tres
idder, bunches of the felines
are crouched under different
stairways.
It dawns on you that its
time Stamford do something
about the ever-growing cat
problem.
The cat population here
has indeed grown out of con
trol, and left unchecked, will
only get worse as stray kit
tens grow up to have litters
of their own.
The kindness of strang
ers, who feed the cats, sim
ply exacerbates the problem
by encouraging the growth
of this scavenger class.
The cat population boom
must be controlled, not only
for obvious health reasons
such as the fleas and other
parasites the animals often
carry, but also in the inter
ests of the cats themselves,
who are often left to starve
to death.
The University needs to
call in the Palo Alto
Humane Society to round
up some of the hundreds of

cats on campus.
The Humane Society, for
its part, should work with
Stanford to advertise the
round-up and let people
know they will have a large
number of cats that can be
adopted by animal-lovers,
who will care for them and
have them spayed.
Residential Education,
which in the past has been
fairly lenient towards stu
dents found harboring cats
or other pets in their resi
dences, needs to be tougher
on students found violating
their residence agreement.
The agreement states clearly
that students who keep pets
will lose their housing.
And students themselves,
who contribute to the cat
problem by adopting
"house" cats and feeding
strays, need to refrain from
these seemingly humane,
but in the long run prob
lematic, practices.
Providing homes for any
of the homeless cats on
campus is a cruel joke in
the end if it is only tempo
rary. Students need to
realize that their kindness
may help to kill cats who
come to depend on them,
and will certainly add to
their abandoned numbers.
Residential Education can
play an important role in in
forming students about the
repercussions — for the cats
and themselves — of their
actions.
