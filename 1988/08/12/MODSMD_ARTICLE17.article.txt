## Words from an old fogey 
### 
HAVE YOU ever felt your
age? I sure have. It isn't
exactly a bed of roses, let
me tell you.
It's funny how obsessed with
youth this com \ry is. We are bom
barded every day with print and
broadcast images of svelte, sun
tanned bodies guzzling Michelob,
batting volleyballs over beach nets
or otherwise indulging themselves
in the pleasures of what is touted
as the freest, most sublime time
of life.
The startling subtexts to this
pubescent craze: 1) the average
age of the American citizen is
rising every year, and it's going
to be up there in the late 50's
before you can say "Surfs up."
2) We are being pushed into adult
hood years before we're ready for
it. Let's face it: who has time to
be a kid these days?
In any event, despite the darker
realities, the media continues to
insist that having the body and
mind of a 16-year-old is the only
conceivable road to happiness in
this paparazzi-infested world. I
admit it. I've always bought into
the frenzy, myself.
I have — until relatively re
cently — presumed myself to
know everything there was to
know about youth culture, even

if I never really did form a part
of it. But now it's no longer so
easy. Things are changing faster
than I can assimilate them into
my head. It's depressing to realize
that the last time I was ever really
hip and adolescent was when
"Purple Rain" came out.
I used to be extremely with-it
when it came to pop music. I spent
long segments of my high-school
years poring over the Billboard
charts and making sure I knew
the name and history of every
new, hot artist on the scene. Now
I graduate from college and come
home to find that disco is back,
much to my initial amusement
and much to my present annoy
ance.
I also used to consider myself
something of a connoisseur of teen
slang. I devoured Frank Zappa's
"Valley Girl" when it came out
— all the "bitchens" and "total
lys" became as cherished a part
of my spoken vocabulary as the
SAT words were of my written.
I thought Stanford slang was
the coolest thing since Wayfarers,
but you can say "psyched" only
so many times before it becomes
the tag of a true moron, and I
was never really able to make all
those Midwestern/Eastern addi
tions to the vernacular come off

my tongue without sounding like
a wanna-be. So it goes. Now one
must contend with utterly Mar
tian coinages like "new ro,"
"wicked," "beddies," "lop," "il
len." How old am I?
It's getting to the point where
1 almost empathize with these
denture-wearing curmudgeons
who write fiery letters of indigna
tion into my hometown paper
every month, protesting (after all
this time) that rock is not music.
I just have to sit there and
wonder. And as the synthesized
strains of another hit single by
the Cover Girls (who?) wafts out
over the airwaves, I just put on
my walkman and retreat into
some reassuringly old Pink Floyd
album. There ain't nothing like
the status quo, my friends. Espe
cially now.
