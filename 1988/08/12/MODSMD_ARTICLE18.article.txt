## Many viewpoints are needed to create a full-time dean 
### 
I WOULD like to make some
clarifications to a letter pub
lished in last Friday's Daily
regarding MEChA's request for
a full-time dean:
First, I am not the
"Chicano/Latino dean," but
should be referred to as the
dean for the Chicano Cultural
Center. I am an assistant dean
of student affairs.
Second, the quote attributed
to Associate Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Jackson regard
ing the dean's role is incorrect.

My role and duties have been
"neatly spelled out." I have
been functioning in that role for
almost four years. My role was
clearly spelled out through a
consensus process involving stu
dents, faculty and staff from the
Dean of Student Affairs Office
prior to my arrival, and has
continued to evolve during my
tenure. However, due to much
growth over the past four years
at El Centro, indeed it is time
to review the original consen
sus.

Finally, in direct contrast to
sentiments attributed to me in
the article, the request for the
introduction of a full-time dean
does have my "official support."
However, all involved need to
realize that a consensus process
is fluid and many viewpoints
need to be taken into considera
tion.
An important aspect of the
decision to create a full-time
assistant deanship at El Centro
also entails finding a way to
maintain the residential dean

portion of the current job as
signment.
As a residential dean, a spe
cific part of my assignment is to
serve Chicano students who find
themselves in an academic
and/or personal dilemma as they
work toward completing their
coursework. I would be opposed
to any decision that would
detract from this important
mission.
