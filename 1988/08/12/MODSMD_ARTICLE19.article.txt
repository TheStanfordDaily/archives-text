Well, I bet you thought I was
gone . . . gone back to Berkeley,
gone fishing or just plain gone.
Well, I'm not! I'm still here on
the Farm.
Although I sometimes think
about my past in that stupid
glass case on the UC campus in
Berkeley, I have come to appre
ciate the enlightened attitudes
and fun-loving people here at
the nation's number one univer
sity (hey, it was no fun always
being number two over at
Berkeley — Avis may get off on
that stuff, but not me).
As you can see from the

enclosed pictures, I'm feeling
well. I've had to have a couple
of minor repairs made to the
coach work, but I'm back in
great shape and getting ready
to back the Card football team
beginning September 10.
And speaking of Card teams,
I spent the early days of June
watching the Card baseball
team do their thing in Omaha,
not to mention the Card men's
and women's tennis teams! Not
bad, eh? Three NCAA titles this
year, four last year and four
the year before that — or
eleven in the last three years.
Gee, when was the last time
UC-Berkeley even won a NCAA

title? Oh well, you get the pic
ture.
And by the way, to the letter
published in the Stanford Daily
late last June by the "golden
geeks" listing a bunch of de
mands for my return — come
on, guys, let's be realistic. Like
the Stanford Band said, they
were going to make a new tree
costume anyway, so the geeks
can go out and shoot another
bear. Just make sure it isn't
one of my relatives, or I'll be
really steamed.
Well, just wanted to say "hi"
and let you know I'm still
around. I'm really starting to
take Stanford to heart; I'm not

sure I'll ever want to go back
to Berkeley.
