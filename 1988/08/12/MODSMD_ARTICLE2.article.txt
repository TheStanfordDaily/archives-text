The verdict is in but the
NCAA drug-testing policy is far
from dead.

News Analysis

NCAA attorneys have 60
days to appeal a ruling by Santa
Clara County Superior Court
Judge Conrad Rushing that the
mandatory testing policy is an

invasion of privacy under the
California constitution.
University lawyer Debra
Zumwalt admitted that the
NCAA will probably take Rush
ing's decision to the California
Court of Appeals.
Furthermore, universities in
states other than California
have not had the same luck as
Stanford in their fight against
drug testing.
For instance, in August 1987
a district court barred NCAA
drug testing at the University of
Washington, ruling that the policy
was an invasion of privacy. But
in February, after the NCAA ap
pealed the case to a federal court,
the decision was reversed and the
drug-testing programs were
reinstated there.
But, Zumwalt said Rushing's
ruling cannot be squelched by the
federal courts because Stanford's
case is simply a "state court case."
"The case did not raise any
federal questions," she said.
But, even if the ruling stands
as written, the impact of Rush
ing's decision is still unclear.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger said he cannot predict how
influential the ruling will be in
other drug-testing cases at Cali
fornia colleges.
"What the University of South
ern California and San Jose State
do is up to them," he said.
Rushing's ruling singles out
Stanford as the one school exempt
from the NCAA's policy.
"The National Collegiate Athle
tic Association is permanently en
joined from enforcing its require
ment that Stanford obtain signed
drug-testing consent forms,"
Rushing wrote in his ruling.
But Stanford linebacker Barry
McKeever said Rushing's decision
will "obviously have some" effect
on all college teams in California.
A fifth-year senior, McKeever and

soccer player Jennifer Hill decided
to fight the NCAA's drug testing
program in court last October.
Stressing that education alone
is the only way to curb drug use
in the long run, McKeever said
he hoped the NCAA could start
concentrating its efforts on teach
ing athletes â€” rather than testing
them.
However, Hill and McKeever's
optimism about the ruling is not
shared by all.
For example, fifth-year senior
Brian Ennis, a quarterback on the
football team, said Rushing's
ruling has "opened up a whole can
of worms that may actually cause
players to take more drugs."
Ennis said he opposes Rush
ing's ruling because education
alone cannot deter football players
from using performance-en
hancing drugs.
Describing the atmosphere in
college football as "high pres
sure," Ennis said the elimination
of drug testing means athletes
and coaches now have the oppor
tunity to take advantage of the
situation.
Although he said he is certain
no Stanford football players have
used performance-enhancing
drugs in the past two years, Ennis
said Stanford has a unique em
phasis on trust and honor.
"We live in a realist world
where you have to have some con
trol. Not everyone has an honor
code or is in a Disneyland," he
said. "How are they going to con
trol drug use now?"
