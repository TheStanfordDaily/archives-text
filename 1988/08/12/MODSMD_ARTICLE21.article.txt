## Steve Phillips Jackson is ushering in a new decade and a new era 
### 
IF MY candidate, Jesse Jack
son, lost, then why do I feel
so good about the 1988 pres
idential campaign?
Because we made history in the
process and have permanently al
tered the U.S. political landscape.
As Assemblywoman Maxine
Waters — chair of the California
Jackson campaign — said in July
on Nightline, "It's a new day and
a new way."
I haven't always been this hap
py. Dukakis's selection of Lloyd
Bentsen as his vice-president dem
onstrated his failure to appreciate
the United States' changing de
mographic, political and electoral
realities.
1 was upset with not just the
way the selection was made but
with the selection itself. By choos
ing a conservative, white male
Southerner, Dukakis was sending
a message to the conservative sec
tor of that South that he cares
about their concerns.
The message sent to the Jack
son wing — the progressive wing
— of the party was "Don't get
too big for your britches. We still
run the show around here."
Dukakis was acting under the
impression that he had to "be
tough" with Jackson in order to

win back the Reagan Democrats,
who he sees as being the key to
victory in the Fall. While it is
true that many former Democrats
voted for Reagan, they are not so
numerous as to be the decisive
element in the election.
Any strategy that places top pri
ority on Southern white males is
based on the Old Math, the Mon
dale Math.
Jesse Jackson has proved that
a new political equation exists in
America. It is a formula for vic
tory in November and a prelude
to the long-term transformation
of this country.
Rainbow politics have come of
age. At the core of the Jackson
phenomenon is a very simple con
cept first raised by Jackson in
1984 when he said, "When the
old minorities come together, they
form a new majority." Thirteen
states and seven million votes
(more than Mondale received in
the '84 primaries) are a testament
to the birth of a new majority.
At the core of this coalition is
the ongoing struggle of African
Americans for freedom, justice
and democracy. Jackson's roots
are in the Civil Rights movement
in the Black-belt South. On Super
Tuesday, Jackson moved into first
place in the popular vote on the
strength of 97 percent of the black
vote.
In true poetic justice, he won
the states that were the heart of
the Old Southern slave-holding
Confederacy-Alabama, Georgia,
Mississippi, Louisiana and South
Carolina.
Jackson swept the African
American vote not just because
he is black. Mondale got 94 per

cent of the black vote against
Reagan. Because of our position
on the bottom of society, black
folks tend to vote for whoever will
bring about the most progressive
change.
He won 95 percent of that vote
because he stood for the issues
and articulated the sentiments of
average black folks. He fought for
basic concerns such as housing,
the right to a decent job, education
and an end to drugs.
There is a saying: "When the
bottom stands up, everything
moves." That is what happened
in the Jackson Action campaign.
Black America stood up, Jesse
won Super Tuesday and then
Michigan, and the whole country
was thrown into turmoil. While
the success of the campaign grew
out of the struggle of black folks,
it acquired mountain-moving
strength when it was linked up
to the other progressive social
movements in this country.
Chicano support in Texas and
Colorado propelled Jackson into
near victories in those states. In
Maine, Wisconsin and New York
City, Jackson received strong
labor support and votes. In Cali
fornia, he received 46 percent of
the Asian/Pacific Islanders' vote
enabling him to win the city of
San Francisco. Across the coun
try, Jackson decisively captured
the 18- to 24-year-old vote includ
ing 54 percent of Stanford stu
dents.
This Rainbow coalition of
people of color, students, workers
and other progressives has histor
ical roots, contemporary relevance
and future implications. During
the Civil Rights movement, many

people in the labor movement sup
ported the struggle for the right
to vote and social equality.
As Jackson often pointed out,
we won that struggle. The modern
challenge is economic violence.
Most people of color work.
Ninety-five percent of blacks are
in some working-class job. The
same is true for a majority of
Chicano/Latinos and Asians. So,
while having to struggle against
racism and the oppression of their
people, they must also deal with
economic exploitation on the job.
The genius of Jackson is that
he was able to find the common
ground of fighting against eco
nomic violence that transcended
racial barriers. He pointed out
that at the end of his life, Martin
Luther King Jr. had moved from
fighting for civil rights to fighting
for the economic rights of striking
sanitation workers in Memphis,
Tenn.
There is a natural basis of uni
ty, then, between these commu
nities of color and labor that has
profound implications for the fu
ture of this country. The fact of
the matter is that when you start
adding up the numbers of people
of color in this country, they come
close to one-third of the whole
population (Blacks alone comprise
a quarter of the Democratic
party's vote).
In order to reach a majority of
the total population, then, you
only need about a third of the
white vote. The Democrats recap
tured the Senate in '86 on the
strength of 95 percent of the black
vote and 33 percent of the white
vote.
By the new math, one needn't

concern oneself with the conser
vative Democrats as long as at
tention is paid to turning out the
33 percent of white folks that con
sistently votes progressive.
Some politicians are beginning
to learn how to count by the new
math. Ernest Hollings, conserva
tive senator from South Carolina,
explained his endorsement of
Jackson as follows: "He's from my
state. He won my state. And I'm
running again."
Over the next few years, politi
cians and communities across the
country are going to learn the
hard way that a new day has ar
rived. In '89, there are going to
be mayoral races in New York
City, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Ed
Koch of New York is already
reaching out to Jesse to have a
meeting to smooth over the dif
ferences caused by his outrageous
behavior during the primaries.
The new majority will be flexing
its muscles in California as well.
This state will soon be a majority
minority. Candidates for governor
in 1990 had better be aware of
this, as should the state legisla
ture as it redraws all the congres
sional and state legislative dis
tricts in the state.
And, lest we forget, there is an
other presidential election in
1992, and Jesse Jackson is only
46. In 1996, he will be as old as
Dukakis is now.
Yes, it's a new day. The sun is
rising at the dawn of a new decade
and a new era. I've never felt
better.
Steve Philips is a fifth-year senior
and was an alternate delegate for
Jackson at the Democratic Con
vention.
