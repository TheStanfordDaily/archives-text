## Bicyclists ride across the continent to fight poverty 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
In just three days 43 bicyclists,
traveling across the country along
three separate routes, will con
verge in Washington D.C. to com
plete the final leg of the third
annual Bike Aid tour to raise
money to combat poverty and
hunger.
Their ensuing celebration, at
Lafayette Park across the street
from the White House, will com
memorate not only the $100,000
in funds the riders expect to have

raised, but serve as the finale to
their nine-week-long effort to ed
ucate people across the nation
about development.
Mike Mills, a recent Stanford
graduate who mans the Bike Aid
office in Old Firehouse, likened
the arduous trip to a "treadmill."
"It's sort of like life at school
except you can't miss the class,"
he said.
Mills, who has not taken the
Bike Aid trail himself said he
would like to after having
vicariously experienced this year's
trip.
Talking daily with riders and
route leaders about logistics on
the trail, Mills asked one partic
ipant, "How's your legs," and
laughingly repeated, "Like iron?

You're having too much fun."
Started in 1986 by the founders
of the Overseas Development Net
work, Bike Aid was designed to
use the challenge of a cross
country bike trip — running from
west to east in several separate
groups — as a means to raise
money primarily for development
projects abroad, but also for those
in the United Stales.
Riders on the two northern
routes, which began June 16 in
Seattle and San Francisco, must
commit to raise at least $2,000 a
piece, while those on the Southern
route, which departed from Aus
tin August 14, are required to
raise a minimum of $1,000 each.
Usually contributed according to
accumulated mileage from private
donors, most of the money ends
up going to ODN-affiliated proj
ects located around the world —
from Appalachia to Zimbabwe.
Fundraising duties aside, the
adventurers must also be prepared
to take their message of develop
ment to each of the communities
through which they pass. The
bicyclists often deliver speeches
and make presentations after long
days spent pedaling between 50
to 100 miles on the road.
And while the thrill of the ride
provides much of the fuel for the
trip, coordinators said it is equally
important each rider be infused
with a desire to learn and teach
others about issues in develop
ment.
The trip "isn't just to see
scenery. We want them to be com
mitted to the issues they're
dealing with," Mills said. "We try
to make it clear that it isn't a joy
ride."
However, most riders find
enough distraction from the work
ing part of the ride. The most fun
part of the trip is probably "just
the random people they meet,"
Mills said.

For instance, some group mem
bers have found they become sur
prisingly close to the people they
run into, despite the short time
they spend in any one place.
According to Mills, after Bike
Aid National Coordinator and Cal
State Hayward student Mary
Kroetch stayed with a family in
Cincinnati, it was difficult to
leave.
"They were all in tears," he
said, adding that a week later
Kroetch had a similar experience
that has since repeated itself "all
along the route."
Sometimes the friends Bike
riders make even join in to ac
company the group in their quest
to cover the entire 3,600-mile dis
tance of the trip, Mills said. For
example, a female reverend from
Chicago hopped on board one
route to drive the cyclists' support
vehicle to D.C.
On the other hand, relying
heavily on hospitality to pull them
through means there isn't always
enough to go around. On days or
nights like these the cyclists have
found themselves sleeping in the
rain in parks, or cooking over
their own butane fires in public
camping grounds despite the best
efforts of coordinators to plan for
their accommodations ahead of
time.
"Once in a while there'll be a
community where things will fall
through," Mills said. "It's dis
couraging to know [whenl the
riders roll into town and just sleep
in a park (because) they haven't
been able to reach as many
people" about the purpose of the
trip.
And with the total number of
Bike Aid participants, down from
161 last summer to 43 in 1988,
it seems fewer people indeed must

be touched by the message of the
project.
However, Mills said the drop in
numbers is the result of a con
scientious decision made by Bike
Aid's coordinators, who were over
whelmed by the logistics of plan
ning the previous year's run.
This year, with group sizes
ranging from eight to 22, riders
are often able to enter towns and
split up among local families.
"Last year, with 40 people per
route they couldn't do that," Mills
said, adding that coordinators
have been more successful this
year in finding communities to
offer the tired troups "pot lucks"

and other amenities.
Dropping down to the smaller
sized program is also part of a
current debate over whether co
ordinators should focus on Bike
Aid's fundraising potentials first
or on the educational value it pro
vides for both individuals riders
and the communities they reach,
according to Mills.
"It's important to emphasize
that the funding is only one
aspect" of Bike Aid, said ODN
Regional Coordinator Steve Babb.
"Both ODN and Bike Aid aren't
primarily funding organizations
but educational (organizations),"
he added.
This mix of educational and
practical goals was the brainchild
of brothers Nazir and Kamal Ah
mad. Nazir Ahmad, a student at

the Business School here, and
Kamal Ahmad, a recent graduate
from Harvard, founded ODN in
1983 and Bike Aid in 1986.
The Ahmads and the current
directors of ODN have established
criteria to ensure the viability of
the "self-help" development pro
grams they fund.
Because of increasing poverty
within U.S. borders, Bike Aid has
also had to make more U.S. pro
grams the focus of their review
this year.
"Look at the communities we're
driving through," Mills said, re
ferring to the drought-stricken
Midwest. "Now all of a sudden,
there are farmers there who are
having problems with their crops
and we're sensitive to that, or at
least trying to be," he said.
