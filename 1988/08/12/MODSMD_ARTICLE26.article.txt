# Iron lung, once passé, has returned to medical use
## 
### Kevin Montague Editorial staff 
The iron lung is making a comeback!
The iron lung, once the primary — and
in fact only — mode of treatment for
breathing disorders, fell out of favor shortly
after the polio epidemic of the 19505. Now,
in the midst of the technological boom, the
old faithful standby is being called on more
and more to treat patients in lieu of newer
devices.
"There's been a fair bit of interest in
it," said Steven Duncan, a respiratory
medicine specialist at Stanford University
Hospital and the School of Medicine.
"There's a real tendency in medicine that
when something is new, it's better," ex
plained Duncan. In the case of respiratory
assistance devices, the "something new"
that came along was a host of devices that
used "positive pressure," as opposed to the
iron lung, which uses "negative pressure."
According to Duncan, negative pressure
devices create an environment in which
there is more pressure inside the patient's
chest than outside by decreasing the pres
sure around the patient's body. In contrast,
positive pressure devices work by directly
increasing the pressure in the patient's
body.
Particularly for acute care, the iron lung
hinders access to the patient.
The upshot of all this is that the iron
lung eventually went the way of the bow
and arrow.
Researchers and doctors soon learned.

however, that there were definite draw
backs to using positive pressure devices.
"Positive pressure is not necessarily the
best way for iong term treatment. To
deliver positive pressure, you have to insert
a tube into the mouth or nose," said Dun
can, adding that inserting such tubing can
cause a variety of damaging and debilitat
ing effects such as erosion, bleeding, trac
heal scarring and vocal cord paralysis.
In contrast, the iron lung causes no such
problems. No holes need to be introduced,
and no tubes are necessary. "The technol
ogy is pretty simple. An iron lung is just
a tank, with kind of a vacuum cleaner that
works backwards."
By contrast, the iron lung is not at all
uncomfortable, and in fact, since it is used
often during sleeping hours, the patient
can use it without much trouble. "It's ac
tually very relaxing," said Duncan, who
has tried one on for size.
Duncan went on to explain that the iron
lung method is a lot easier on the patient.
For most people "probably the only time
you're aware of breathing is when you run
up to the Dish," he said, adding that for
people with breathing disorders, that
feeling of discomfort and constant aware
ness of the breathing effort is a fact of life.
Sleeping in an iron lung relieves this
feeling.
In the future, Duncan says he sees im
provements in positive pressure devices as
well as increased popularity for the iron
lung in hospitals, doctors' offices and even
in patients' homes.
