# Humanities Center staff prepares for annual deluge of scholars and books
## 
### Todd Pierce Editorial staff 
Quiet reigns inside the Human
ities Center — barely a stone's
throw from a horde of shrieking
cheerleaders — where the staff
waits expectantly for the trunks
of books which herald the coming
of scholars' from around the
world.
Their arrival is a mark of the
Center's rapid growth over the
past few years since it was estab
lished in Rogers and Mariposa
Houses in 1982, according to Asst.
Director of the Center Morton
Sosna, who is also a professor of
American Studies.
In fact, finding room for the
researchers — and their books —

of Houdini. The result of the
work, however, has been the es

Center Annex.
"We needed another room for
lectures and also more offices,"
Sosna said, adding that the sunlit,
book-lined living room in Mar
iposa House overflows during
speeches and conferences.
"We constantly had to move
furniture around," Sosna said.
"We wanted a place where we
could hold 50 people. We wanted
more offices for more graduate
fellows."

swer these demands, the Pro
vost's office has leased a house
on Alvarado Row to the Center

for their Annex. A Tudor-style
cottage reminiscent of the one
where Hansel and Gretel were
done in, the Annex has a living
room spacious enough for lectures
and room for five new offices.
Valerie Veronin, assistant
provost in charge of faculty and
administration, said the Univer
sity purchased the house from a
private owner a year ago. "We
knew the Humanities Center
needed space. ... They had long
since overrun their original
space," she said.
However pragmatism, not lar
gesse, actually prompted the
Provost's office to acquire the
dwelling. Veronin said plans to

The Humanities Center Annex will have five offices for graduate
fellows and a spacious living room for speeches and conferences.
The tranquility of the house may he doomed, however, as the Uni
versity plans to expand Campus Drive into the sideyard.
