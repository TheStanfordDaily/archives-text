# Humanities Center staff prepares for annual deluge of scholars and books
## 
### Todd Pierce Editorial staff 
Quiet reigns inside the Human
ities Center — barely a stone's
throw from a horde of shrieking
cheerleaders — where the staff
waits expectantly for the trunks
of books which herald the coming
of scholars' from around the
world.
Their arrival is a mark of the
Center's rapid growth over the
past few years since it was estab
lished in Rogers and Mariposa
Houses in 1982, according to Asst.
Director of the Center Morton
Sosna, who is also a professor of
American Studies.
In fact, finding room for the
researchers — and their books —

has required legerdemain worthy
of Houdini. The result of the
work, however, has been the es
tablishment of a new Humanities
Center Annex.
"We needed another room for
lectures and also more offices,"
Sosna said, adding that the sunlit,
book-lined living room in Mar
iposa House overflows during
speeches and conferences.
"We constantly had to move
furniture around," Sosna said.
"We wanted a place where we
could hold 50 people. We wanted
more offices for more graduate
fellows."
To relieve the crunch and an
swer these demands, the Pro
vost's office has leased a house
on Alvarado Row to the Center

for their Annex. A Tudor-style
cottage reminiscent of the one
where Hansel and Gretel were
done in, the Annex has a living
room spacious enough for lectures
and room for five new offices.
Valerie Veronin, assistant
provost in charge of faculty and
administration, said the Univer
sity purchased the house from a
private owner a year ago. "We
knew the Humanities Center
needed space. ... They had long
since overrun their original
space," she said.
However pragmatism, not lar
gesse, actually prompted the
Provost's office to acquire the
dwelling. Veronin said plans to

The Humanities Center Annex will have five offices for graduate
fellows and a spacious living room for speeches and conferences.
The tranquility of the house may he doomed, however, as the Uni
versity plans to expand Campus Drive into the sideyard.
expand Campus Drive to four
lanes would be hampered by a
residence on the corner of Campus
and Alvarado, one of the busiest
intersections on campus.
"This house sits right on the
corner. The people living there
would lose their sideyard," she
said. "The building will be more
appropriate for academic use
when that happens," according to
Sosna.
Until then, however, the Annex
will continue to play full host to
Humanities Center activities.
Some of these activities include
the contributions made by the fel
lows at the Humanities Center

during the academic year.
Scholars are required to devote
one-sixth of their time at the Cen
ter to an activity which will di
rectly benefit the University
This project often takes the
shape of a class or a conference,
like the "Talking Terrorism" con
ference organized by former Cen
ter fellow and Stanford Italian
Prof. Beverly Allen.
The 17 scholars in this year's
group come from universities in
the United States and abroad and
the course offerings reflect their
diverse backgrounds. Elliott
Gorn, a professor from Miami
University, who is researching the
history of athletics in the United
States, will teach an American
Studies seminar on sports in
American culture.
