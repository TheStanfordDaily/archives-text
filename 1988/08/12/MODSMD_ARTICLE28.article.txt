# Abandoned bicycles plague beauty, safety of campus
## Observers spot abandoned and decrepit bikes on campus 
### Marta Bright 
Battered, rusted, cracked, dis
membered and long since forgot
ten by their owners, hundreds of
abandoned bicycles lend an ele
ment of squalor to the campus
and make parking difficult.
According to officer Dan Smith,
head of special services at the
Stanford Police Department, the
bicycle problem has escalated as
the Stanford population has swol
len.
"This is a neat community and
people are very concerned about
the beauty of the campus. ...
Bikes become unsightly and
people call in to have them
removed," Smith said.
Smith estimates there are about
15,000 bicycles on campus at this
time. When bicycles are picked up
after being reported as abandoned
or stolen, they are put into a com
pound at the department and held
for 90 days.
"At any one time we have about
100 bikes in our posession waiting
the 90 day period. ... 450 bikes
were held through our depart
ment in 1987 and in 1988 we are
currently at 100," he added.
If bikes are not claimed after
the holding period, they are put
up for auction and the proceeds
go to the Santa Clara Sheriff's
Department.

Because many Stanford stu
dents live in other parts of the
country and spend time overseas,
they find dealing with their bikes
a hassle. Hence, scads of bicycles
perish under the sun.
One man who has almost made
a hobby out of searching for aban
doned bicycles is John Newhagen,
an instructor at the Mass Media
Institute. Newhagen said he has

frame each morning for nearly
two years, monitoring the slow
disintegration of its parts.
The police department said it
does not have the manpower to
send officers around on foot to
collect all the bikes, and, unless
passershy speak up, the bikes be
come tattered and worn for all to
see.
Smith said he is concerned by
students' lack of responsibility,
but added that he finds the
bicycles especially troubling. They

are, he said, an invitation to
crime.
"It is a concern of ours because
bike theft is very common on
campus. We've caught people
loading bikes into large vans dur
ing daylight hours."
But Smith hastened to add that
the Stanford community is any
thing but apathetic.
"I don't see this as a community
where people don't want to get
involved," he said.
Goodwill comes around at the
end of each year, encouraging stu
dents to donate their bikes rather
than leaving them to become a
hazard and an eyesore, he said,
adding that "a senior donation
program has also been set up
through the student/faculty run
Bicycle Safety Committee."
Housing authorities are also
aiding in the effort by tagging
bikes and collecting them after 10
days if they have not been moved.
The department will then take
possession of the bike and go
through the procedures outlined
above.
"This is a situation that can be
managed but with help from the
community," Smith said. Because
of this, he advised people not be
afraid or embarassed and to call
in anytime if they want a bike
removed.
