## Unbelievable: The Great ONE is going, going, gone 
### 
GRETZKY TRADED!
It's Friday, and I still don't believe
it. I figure I'll wake up soon and
realize I imagined the whole thing. But for
now let's assume it really happened.
The Great One, as he is known, will no
longer make his pinpoint passes nor score
on his breathtaking breakaways for the
Edmonton Oilers. Now, No. 99 will skate
for the Los Angeles Kings.
The man who was synonymous with the
city of Edmonton, Alberta will now be a
"see also" in Los Angeles, California.

Sure, he'll still attract notice when he
walks down the street or goes out to eat
at Spago. But Michael Douglas will prob
ably be at the next table and Morgan Fair
child will be sitting across the room.
In Edmonton, Gretzky stopped traffic.
He'd be recognized from miles away and
could rarely find a moment alone.
If Gretzky found time to attend a Laker
game, CBS might not even notice him with
all the standard close-ups of Jack Nicholson
and Dyan Cannon.
Readers of the Los Angeles Times will
probably learn of his achievements
somewhere beneath the Lakers' box
score. They'll find his latest exploits after
the Raiders game summary. Perhaps he'll
earn an "oh, by the way" in Scott Ostler's
column after he covers the latest on the
Dodgers.
When he would glide onto the ice in the
Northlands Coliseum, everyone in the
arena would immediately take notice. The
fans would go wild, the opposition would
stand in awe. One gets a feeling all Ed
monton would pause for just a second to
savor the moment.
Wayne Gretzky, The Great One, (it's
always capitalized) was ready to do his
thing.
I'm not positive where the Kings play,
though I imagine it's the Forum. When he
skates out in L.A., the traffic on the Santa

Montica freeway will continue to crawj
along, the gangs will still be brawling in
Watts, the beachgoers will continue packing
up their towels and frisbees and get ready
to head home.
In L.A., a tragedy equivalent to the
Gretzky trade would be the Lakers dealing
Magic Johnson. And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
And James Worthy, too.
Wayne Gretzky is, simply put, the best
hockey player of our time and, quite prob
ably, of all time. Barring catastrophic in
jury, he will smash in 10 years the all-time
scoring records Gordie Howe set in 26.
Eight straight Hart Trophies for being
the league's most valuable player in
his first eight seasons sit on
Gretzky's mantle. Injuries cost him the
award last year.
It would be like the Celtics trading Larry
Bird. The best player in basketball won a
mere three straight MVP awards. None
before 1984 and none since 1986. At the
risk of being redundant, Gretzky won the
award every year from 1980 through 1987.
Yogi Berra managed to win baseball's
MVP award four times in his career. Wayne
Gretzky may win 14 MVP's before he's
through.
Without getting into a debate about who
the best basketball and baseball players of
all time are, let me just say that two other
players who were arguably the "All-time
greatest" in their respective sports were
also traded.
All-time great #1: Wilt Chamberlain was
traded from the Philadelphia 76ers to the
Los Angeles Lakers in 1968. One of the
first 7-footers ever to step on the hardwood,
Chamberlain is the second leading scorer
in the history of the NBA. His greatness
is not disputed.
He once averaged 50.4 points per game
for an entire season. Michael Jordan's 37
seems kind of inconsequential by compar
ison. Chamberlain scored 100 points in a
single game in Hershey, Pa. And, to top
it off he pulled down a record 55 rebounds
in a single contest.
That night his counterpart on the Celtics
was Bill Russell. Many consider Russell to
be the best their ever was.
But Chamberlain wasn't revered like
Gretzky. He was booed throughout most
of his career. He wasn't loved like The
Great One.
Why? Because Chamberlain didn't win
the championship every year. Neither has
Wayne Gretzky. But he is batting almost
.500

In 1920, Babe Ruth was
traded by the Red Sox for
'No! No! Nanette.'

All time great #2: The Sultan of Swat,
Babe Ruth, was traded by Boston Red Sox
owner Harry Frazee to the New York
Yankees for "No No Nanette!" in 1920.
The owner of the Sox had an affinity for
producing Broadway plays, you see, and
needed a cash infusion to pursue his ex
pensive hobby.
The Bambino was placed on the auc
tion block and the Bronx Bombers
were only too happy to pick him up
for $125,000 in cash and a $300,000 loan.
"No! No! Nanette" was a smash on the
Great White Way. Babe Ruth would go on
to smash 714 homers before he hung it up.
But there's no comparison here either.
At the time, Ruth was a power-hitting
pitcher. A pretty damn good pitcher mind
you. But he would hit nearly all of those
714 homers in Yankee pinstripes. Only in
retrospect did the BoSox know they had
pawned the man who would rewrite nearly
every record book that had been written.
At least the Red Sox didn't trade Ted
Williams. And, the Yankees never dealt Joe
DiMaggio. Or Mickey Mantle. The St. Louis
Cardinals never sold Stan Musial.
The bottom line is, for the first time in
history, a man who is by an order of mag
nitude the all-time best at his sport was
traded, while he is still in his prime.
I can empathize with the Edmonton fans.
They feel cheated, robbed, violated. Their
Wayne Gretzky has been taken away, never
to return. They're confused, hurt, furious.
They're canceling their season tickets.
They're sending death threats to Oilers'
owner Peter Pocklington. They're calling
real estate brokers to see if they can find
a winter home — or a permanent one —
in the L.A. area.
I know the feeling. A number of years
back, I was supposed to go a New York
Mets game Friday night to see Tom Seaver
pitch. I loved Tom Seaver. To me, he was
the best there was. I loved the Mets. Even
though they were often the worst in the
league.
For months, New York Daily News' col
umnist Dick Young was badmouthing
Seaver, saying he should be traded. Mets'

General Manager M. Donald Grant appar
ently agreed and dealt Seaver to the Cin
cinnati Reds for Pat Zachry, Doug Flynn,
Steve Henderson and someone whose name
I can't remember.
Zachry started Friday night's game.
The stadium was so empty we were
able to move up to the front row —
behind first base. It was the best seat I
had ever had up to that point. And I was
miserable.
I promised I'd never root for the Mets
again until they had a new owner. It was
hard to break away, but I did. I learned
to love the Yankees — an emotion that
was no doubt fostered by their ascent to
the top of the baseball world in the late
19705.
The Mets were finally sold to Nelson
Doubleday and Fred Wilpon and they even
reacquired Tom Seaver for awhile. I learned
to forgive in 1983.
It will probably be sometime around 2083
before Edmonton fans forgive Pocklington.
Killing him would probably give the
fans satisfaction but is unacceptable
because it is far too messy.
The shock of the trade will eventually
wear off and the fans will realize they still
have one hell of a hockey team. With the
likes of Mark Messier and Jari Kurri the
Oilers are not about to tumble to last place.
Then one should consider what they ob
tained in exchange for Gretzky. Jimmy Car
son has a chance to be the best U.S.-born
player ever in the National Hockey League.
Martin Gelinas has the potential to be a
star as well. And, with three additional
No. 1 draft picks in the next six years, the
Oilers should be able to fill any holes that
arise.
Still, The Great One has been traded.
Just like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975.
Just like Julius Erving in 1976. Just like
Eric Dickerson in 1987.
You just never know what will happen
in sports. Players who seem certain
to finish their careers in the city they
achieved their greatness are discarded like
old clothes.
Maybe Don Mattingly will be next. I
heard George Steinbrenner wanted to do
a new musical. It's called "The Yanks are
Comin'." Or something like that.

'No! No! Nanette.'

All time great #2: The Sultan of Swat,
Babe Ruth, was traded by Boston Red Sox
owner Harry Frazee to the New York
Yankees for "No No Nanette!" in 1920.
The owner of the Sox had an affinity for
producing Broadway plays, you see, and
needed a cash infusion to pursue his ex
pensive hobby.
The Bambino was placed on the auc
tion block and the Bronx Bombers
were only too happy to pick him up
for $125,000 in cash and a $300,000 loan.
"No! No! Nanette" was a smash on the
Great White Way. Babe Ruth would go on
to smash 714 homers before he hung it up.
But there's no comparison here either.
At the time, Ruth was a power-hitting
pitcher. A pretty damn good pitcher mind
you. But he would hit nearly all of those
714 homers in Yankee pinstripes. Only in
retrospect did the BoSox know they had
pawned the man who would rewrite nearly
every record book that had been written.
At least the Red Sox didn't trade Ted
Williams. And, the Yankees never dealt Joe
DiMaggio. Or Mickey Mantle. The St. Louis
Cardinals never sold Stan Musial.
The bottom line is, for the first time in
history, a man who is by an order of mag
nitude the all-time best at his sport was
traded, while he is still in his prime.
I can empathize with the Edmonton fans.
They feel cheated, robbed, violated. Their
Wayne Gretzky has been taken away, never
to return. They're confused, hurt, furious.
They're canceling their season tickets.
They're sending death threats to Oilers'
owner Peter Pocklington. They're calling
real estate brokers to see if they can find
a winter home — or a permanent one —
in the L.A. area.
I know the feeling. A number of years
back, I was supposed to go a New York
Mets game Friday night to see Tom Seaver
pitch. I loved Tom Seaver. To me, he was
the best there was. I loved the Mets. Even
though they were often the worst in the
league.
For months, New York Daily News' col
umnist Dick Young was badmouthing
Seaver, saying he should be traded. Mets'

General Manager M. Donald Grant appar
ently agreed and dealt Seaver to the Cin
cinnati Reds for Pat Zachry, Doug Flynn,
Steve Henderson and someone whose name
I can't remember.
Zachry started Friday night's game.
The stadium was so empty we were
able to move up to the front row —
behind first base. It was the best seat I
had ever had up to that point. And I was
miserable.
I promised I'd never root for the Mets
again until they had a new owner. It was
hard to break away, but I did. I learned
to love the Yankees — an emotion that
was no doubt fostered by their ascent to
the top of the baseball world in the late
19705.
The Mets were finally sold to Nelson
Doubleday and Fred Wilpon and they even
reacquired Tom Seaver for awhile. I learned
to forgive in 1983.
It will probably be sometime around 2083
before Edmonton fans forgive Pocklington.
Killing him would probably give the
fans satisfaction but is unacceptable
because it is far too messy.
The shock of the trade will eventually
wear off and the fans will realize they still
have one hell of a hockey team. With the
likes of Mark Messier and Jari Kurri the
Oilers are not about to tumble to last place.
Then one should consider what they ob
tained in exchange for Gretzky. Jimmy Car
son has a chance to be the best U.S.-born
player ever in the National Hockey League.
Martin Gelinas has the potential to be a
star as well. And, with three additional
No. 1 draft picks in the next six years, the
Oilers should be able to fill any holes that
arise.
Still, The Great One has been traded.
Just like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975.
Just like Julius Erving in 1976. Just like
Eric Dickerson in 1987.
You just never know what will happen
in sports. Players who seem certain
to finish their careers in the city they
achieved their greatness are discarded like
old clothes.
Maybe Don Mattingly will be next. I
heard George Steinbrenner wanted to do
a new musical. It's called "The Yanks are
Comin'." Or something like that.

MARK ROGOWSKY
GRETZKY TRADED!
It's Friday, and I still don't believe
it. I figure I'll wake up soon and
realize I imagined the whole thing. But for
now let's assume it really happened.
The Great One, as he is known, will no
longer make his pinpoint passes nor score
on his breathtaking breakaways for the
Edmonton Oilers. Now, No. 99 will skate
for the Los Angeles Kings.
The man who was synonymous with the
city of Edmonton, Alberta will now be a
"see also" in Los Angeles, California.

Sure, he'll still attract notice when he
walks down the street or goes out to eat
at Spago. But Michael Douglas will prob
ably be at the next table and Morgan Fair
child will be sitting across the room.
In Edmonton, Gretzky stopped traffic.
He'd be recognized from miles away and
could rarely find a moment alone.
If Gretzky found time to attend a Laker
game, CBS might not even notice him with
all the standard close-ups of Jack Nicholson
and Dyan Cannon.
Readers of the Los Angeles Times will
probably learn of his achievements
somewhere beneath the Lakers' box
score. They'll find his latest exploits after
the Raiders game summary. Perhaps he'll
earn an "oh, by the way" in Scott Ostler's
column after he covers the latest on the
Dodgers.
When he would glide onto the ice in the
Northlands Coliseum, everyone in the
arena would immediately take notice. The
fans would go wild, the opposition would
stand in awe. One gets a feeling all Ed
monton would pause for just a second to
savor the moment.
Wayne Gretzky, The Great One, (it's
always capitalized) was ready to do his
thing.
I'm not positive where the Kings play,
though I imagine it's the Forum. When he
skates out in L.A., the traffic on the Santa

Montica freeway will continue to crawj
along, the gangs will still be brawling in
Watts, the beachgoers will continue packing
up their towels and frisbees and get ready
to head home.
In L.A., a tragedy equivalent to the
Gretzky trade would be the Lakers dealing
Magic Johnson. And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
And James Worthy, too.
Wayne Gretzky is, simply put, the best
hockey player of our time and, quite prob
ably, of all time. Barring catastrophic in
jury, he will smash in 10 years the all-time
scoring records Gordie Howe set in 26.
Eight straight Hart Trophies for being
the league's most valuable player in
his first eight seasons sit on
Gretzky's mantle. Injuries cost him the
award last year.
It would be like the Celtics trading Larry
Bird. The best player in basketball won a
mere three straight MVP awards. None
before 1984 and none since 1986. At the
risk of being redundant, Gretzky won the
award every year from 1980 through 1987.
Yogi Berra managed to win baseball's
MVP award four times in his career. Wayne
Gretzky may win 14 MVP's before he's
through.
Without getting into a debate about who
the best basketball and baseball players of
all time are, let me just say that two other
players who were arguably the "All-time
greatest" in their respective sports were
also traded.
All-time great #1: Wilt Chamberlain was
traded from the Philadelphia 76ers to the
Los Angeles Lakers in 1968. One of the
first 7-footers ever to step on the hardwood,
Chamberlain is the second leading scorer
in the history of the NBA. His greatness
is not disputed.
He once averaged 50.4 points per game
for an entire season. Michael Jordan's 37
seems kind of inconsequential by compar
ison. Chamberlain scored 100 points in a
single game in Hershey, Pa. And, to top
it off he pulled down a record 55 rebounds
in a single contest.
That night his counterpart on the Celtics
was Bill Russell. Many consider Russell to
be the best their ever was.
But Chamberlain wasn't revered like
Gretzky. He was booed throughout most
of his career. He wasn't loved like The
Great One.
Why? Because Chamberlain didn't win
the championship every year. Neither has
Wayne Gretzky. But he is batting almost
.500

In 1920, Babe Ruth was
traded by the Red Sox for
'No! No! Nanette.'

All time great #2: The Sultan of Swat,
Babe Ruth, was traded by Boston Red Sox
owner Harry Frazee to the New York
