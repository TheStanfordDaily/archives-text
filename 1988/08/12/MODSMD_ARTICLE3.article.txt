# SLAC's best called in to fix ailing collider

Stanford's $125 million
linear collider is having prob
lems, but the top scientists at
the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center have been or
ganizing to work the kinks out
of the troubled project.
SLAC Director Burton Rich
ter, prompted by "significant
pressure" from funding agen
cies and internal recognition of
the importance of getting the
project back on track, has
formed an organizational
group to deal with the Stanford
Linear Collider.
According to SLAC Spokes
person Michael Riordan, "What
has been giving a lot of prob

lems is getting the machine to
run a significant fraction of the
time."
The group set up to work on
the beleaguered collider in
cludes Richter and Assoc. Di
rectors of SLAC Kaye Lathrop,
John Rees and Charles Pres
cott. "Burton Richter himself
has come down out of the di
rector's office and rolled up his
sleeves," Riordan said. Richter
is also reportedly seeking help
outside the confines of SLAC.
Richter is on a trip to West
Germany this week, attending
a high-energy physics confer
ence in Munich.
Although he had not heard
of any specific arrangements to
bring in outside troubleshooters,
Rees said that "the kind of
physicists we need to help us
could come from all over the
world."
Riordan described two goals be
hind building the new collider: the
first to prove that this "com
pletely new kind of atom smash
er" could be constructed and the
second to "tune it up and use it
to do some physics research." Ac
cording to Riordan, SLAC has

achieved the first goal.
The linear collider is unique in
its ability to focus and collide two
separate beams of particles with
incredible precision, hopefully
producing a subatomic Z particle
in the collisions.
Z particles have been produced
about 100 times around the world,
but the collider's eventual goal is
to be able to produce one Z par
ticle an hour, Riordan said.
But, the collider has been un
able to produce a single Z particle
and it achieved collisions about 6
percent of the time in July.
