# Great Expectations
## 
### 
Coming off it's finest season since
the NCAA Championship year
of 1942, the men's basketball
team is looking toward the coming
year with anticipation. Practice began
this week for a squad that has been
tabbed as a preseason co-No. 1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference this year along
with Arizona.
The team returns four starters from
last year and gets an added boost from
the return of erstwhile starter senior
Eric Reveno (left). The 6-foot-8 for
ward will try to fill the shoes of the
departed Greg Butler, who is trying
to make it with the New York Knicks.
Other returning starters include
senior Howard Wright (center of photo
at right) seen here skying above Lang
Meyer and Reveno for a rebound.
Wright was often on the receiving
end of passes from senior point guard
Terry Taylor (bottom right). Taylor's
three-point bombs allowed the Cardi
nal to open up its offense.
Additional help in the backcourt will
come from sophomore John Patrick
(left of photo at bottom left) and senior
Scott Meinert (right, same photo) seen
getting some advice from Coach Mike
Montgomery during a break.
Senior Todd Lichti and sophomore
Andrew Vlahov are off practicing with
the Olympic teams of the United
States and Australia respectively.
