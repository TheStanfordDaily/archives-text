# Rapp on third Olympic team while Morales is in trouble
## 
### 
Susan Rapp, who graduated from Stan
ford this June, did something no American
woman has ever done before.
She earned a place on her third Olympic
team.
Competing in the 200-meter breaststroke
Tuesday night, Rapp clocked a personal
best 2:31.01 earning her second place in
the race. It was also the second best time
in the United States this year.
"I think this one is the most emotional,"
a tearful Rapp said. "I usually don't cry
after a race.
"I've had a lot of ups and downs these
past four years," she added. Rapp had com
plex knee surgery after winning a silver
medal in the 200 breast at the 1984 Sum
mer Games in Los Angeles.
"The doctor told me I'd never swim
breaststroke again," she said.
The doctor, needless to say, was wrong.
Rapp redshirted during the '85 season
due to injuries then missed the Pan Amer
ican Games in '87 due to an ankle injury.
But she did not quit.
"I knew I could get into the top four,"
she said. "Walking up to the starting blocks
(for the final), I knew I could do it."
And do it she did, finishing just two
tenths of a second behind the favorite
Tracey McFarlane.
Pablo Morales, on the other hand, has

not been successful thus far at the Olympic
trials.
The 1987 graduate failed to qualify in
the 100-meter butterfly, an event he holds
the world record in. Morales was nosed
out by Matt Biondi, the University of Cal
ifornia graduate, and Stanford junior Jay
Morten son.
Biondi will go to Seoul with a chance of
equalling Mark Spitz' record of seven gold
medals in a single Olympics.
Morales still has a chance to qualify in
the 200 fly, the 200 individual medley and
the 400 medley relay team.
Despite reports, Lichti still
in the running for Seoul
Senior Todd Lichti has a good chance of
making the Olympic basketball team re
gardless of what "The Mouth of College
Basketball," Dick Vitale, might think.
Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery told
Lichti not to make plans to join the Car
dinal on its trip to Australia and Fiji. Mont
gomery believes Lichti could very well wind
up in Seoul instead.
Olympic Asst. Coach George Raveling
said this week would determine the final
four cuts that will bring the team from its
present size of 16 down to 12.

Paye seems almost certain
to make the 49ers roster
When John Paye was a junior at Stan
ford, he was being touted as a Heisman
Trophy candidate for his senior year and
a likely No. 1 draft choice in the NFL.
But shoulder injuries suffered that year
sidelined Paye late in his senior year and

questions about his chances to recover
made NFL teams wary.
Eventually, Paye was a 10th round se
lection of the 49ers. He spent his rookie
season on injured reserve last year.
Now, almost fully recovered, Paye seems
certain to be the 49ers third-string quar
terback this season since Bob Gagliano,
last season's No. 3, was cut on Monday.
