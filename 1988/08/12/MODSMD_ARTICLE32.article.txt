## Palo Alto cafes offer more than fine coffee 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
The English may have perfected tea, but
Americans have certainly made the most
of coffee. While lacking the ritual and
elegance of "high tea," the American coffee
break has become an institution. Palo Alto
boasts several fine cafes in which to take
a quick break. . . or while away an after
noon.
The Prolific Oven
550 Waverlcy
Palo Alto
326-8485
Away from the hustle and bustle of Uni
versity Avenue lies the Prolific Oven, a
combination bakery and coffeehouse sure
to please the cafe connoisseur. With a few
tables outside and plenty of large wooden
ones within, the Prolific Oven provides
space to relax, read and enjoy the ambiance.
One of the benefits in choosing this cof
feehouse is that it lives up to its name.
The Prolific Oven offers a wide selection
of baked goods — "pastries and breads for
the discriminating palate."
Although the choices vary, it's really hard
to go wrong with any of them. The
raspberry danish is my favorite coffee ac
companiment. The pastry is buttery and
perfectly flaky, with delicious real (you can
see the seeds) raspberries in the center.
The glaze is lightly drizzled over the danish,
adding crunch and sweetness.
The cakes here are hard to resist, par
ticularly if you are fond of carrot cake.
Their moist cake is loaded with carrots,
raisins and walnuts, and topped with cream
cheese frosting. While the traditional cream
cheese is great, do not overlook the amazing
rum or coffee flavored versions.
The coffee is excellent at the Prolific

Oven, whether it be a large cafe mocha or
some smooth cafe au lait. They serve the
local favorite Peet's coffee, making a mug
ful of ordinary coffee something special.
An added attraction is the brown sugar
available with cream (so much better than
white sugar!)
For a leisurely getaway, The Prolific
Oven is the perfect spot. Bring a novel or

a newspaper, sip coffee and indulge.
II Fornaio
388 University
Palo Alto

The Americans may know their coffee,
but the Italians know their's strong. And
II Fornaio's double espresso and double
capuccino certainly pack a punch; delicious
freshly brewed coffees fill this Italian cafe
with heavenly aromas and eager customers.

Located at a busy corner in downtown
Palo Alto, II Fornaio is a great place foi
people-watching. Grab a window seat inside
the stylish bakery — or, better yet, at an
outside table — and watch the world go
by. And don't forget to order some coffee.
The cafe mocha is a great choice (especially
when topped with whipped cream).
But if dessert-style coffees don't appeal

to you, try some caffe latte or au lait, with
cinnamon or chocolate on top. And you can
always get a "single" espresso.
All good coffee deserves good pastry, and
II Fornaio presents a tempting array. The
chocolate torte is tantalizing and the sour
cream cake covered with poppy seeds prom
ises an interesting taste sensation. Partic
ularly tasty are the Italian butter cookies
which come in several varieties. The hazel
nut chocolate "baci" (kisses) offers a typical
and delicious Italian flavor combination.
Perhaps even more enticing than the

sweets, however, is the freshly baked Ital
ian bread — thankfully, you'll find no sour
dough here. Crusty, chewy, and "soft on
the inside" loaves are delicious solo.
Munching on bread, sipping espresso —
a perfect way to spend an August afternoon.
At II Fornaio, you can see everyone rushing
by while you just sit and relax.
The Palo Alto Coffee Roasting Company
159 Stanford Shopping Center
Palo Alto
327-2233
When shopping is making you weary,
wander over to the Palo Alto Coffee Roast
ing Company for some energy restoring
cofTee drinks. Located on the edge of the
new European Street Market section across
from Macy's, this spot offers the perfect
refuge from summer shopping crowds.
This sleek cafe has an amazing cofTee
roaster in its front window, and once inside
you can see, smell and even taste the results
of its efforts.
Coffee is serious business at the Roasting
Company, and when you taste it you'll
agree that it's seriously delicious. A mug
of coffee (your choice of several roasts) is
full-bodied and amazingly aromatic — a
tribute to its freshness. My favorite is their
cafe mocha with chocolate shavings on top,
but it's closely followed by the rich and
creamy cafe au lait.
Although not a bakery, the Roasting
Company offers a good variety of cakes,
brownies, muffins and cookies. There's al
ways carrot cake and a very creamy
cheesecake, as well as cream cheese choc
olate chip brownies.
Although, there is some seating available
inside, the Roasting Company has little
tables outside where you can catch the
sun.
