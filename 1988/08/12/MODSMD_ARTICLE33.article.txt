# Opening eve jitters can't derail 'Streetcar'
## 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Imagine sending a junior college baseball team to
play against the New York Yankees. Now change
the players into actors and the diamond into a
theatre, and you have an idea of what the Stanford
Actors Project is all about.
But the baseball analogy ends there, as the notion
of mixing theatrical amateurs with professional ac
tors doesn't appear to have hurt the Stanford Actors
Project production of "A Streetcar Named Desire,"
now playing at the Little Theatre.
Tennessee Williams' classic play, directed by Stan
ford alum Reid Edelman, revolves around the con
flict between Stanley Kowalski and Blanche Dußois,
his sister-in-law, who comes to live with him and
his wife Stella.
Stanley represents the ultimate in brutal honesty,
a raw and crude man who always says what he
thinks. In stark contrast is Blanche, a fallen south
ern belle who takes great pains to put forth what
she admits is "a facade of being prim and proper."
Caught in the middle is Stella, Blanche's sister,
a woman wedged between the both the philosophical
and literal battles of Stanley and Blanche.
As the play progresses, Stanley's unyielding desire
to preserve his "kingdom" savagely tears away
Blanche's protective veil of propriety and the very
framework of her existence.
Although the piece starts out somewhat sluggishly
and hints at becoming superficial, it progresses into
a fine production early in the first act as Blanche
displays a peek at the emotion the play eventually
reaches.
The opening night performance unfortunately also
included more than a normal amount of technical
hitches, such as blown light cues and prop problems
that threatened to mar an otherwise breathtaking
performance. Hopefully this was merely a case of
opening night jitters that will be smoothed out in
future performances.
Cliff Mayotte, a professional actor who also serves
as the show's associate director, brings an amazing
vitality to the character of Stanley, a role long
stereotyped by Marlon Brando's portrayal. Mayotte
plays Stanley with the vulgar brutishness the role
requires, but also manages to add the mysteriously
attractive force that Stella loves, but that Blanche
refuses to see.

The role of Blanche is also played by a professional
actor, Amy Jackson, who is faced with a character
normally played as either completely conniving and
deceptive or as the totally helpless victim of fate
and the world.
Jackson's performance strikes a complex balance
between the two, leaving the audience to wonder
just who deserves more pity, the pathetic Blanche
(who is driven over the edge) or the boorish Stanley
(who causes her demise when he can no longer
tolerate her intrusion into his life).
Cast in a role meant to bring the opposites of
Stanley and Blanche together, Shannon Jackson (a
Phi Beta Kappa senior in Modern Thought and
Literature here at Stanford) is faced with the dif
ficult task of working with two actors whose pro
fessional credits far outdistance hers.
Amazingly, Shannon Jackson's Stella blends
seamlessly with the performances of her more ex
perienced partners, and her portrayal of the woman
torn between the two people she loves most is
wonderfully first rate.
She puts forth great power in what could have
been a neutral, downplayed role, and her perform
ance does great justice to the philosophy behind
the Stanford Actors Project of bringing out younger
players' talent by working with experienced actors.
In the face of three such powerful performances,
however, the various minor roles seem undefined.
Whether they are meant to be flat contrasts to
the vibrant main characters or lively slices of life
outside the tumult of the Kowalski household is
unclear, and the junior actors assigned to those
roles have a tough time developing their own talents.
But overall, "Streetcar" is a riveting and graphic
production that grips the audience in numerous
ways, including breaking down the "fourth wall"
of the stage by using all the doors of the theater
as entrance and exit points and ignoring the bound
aries of the stage.
The audience gets a very real sense that they
have been dropped into the play rather than just
being voyeurs behind an imposed imaginary screen.
The set, designed by PhD student Dunsi Dai, also
encourages the audience to enter the story by in
cluding incomplete walls that lend the right amount
of nonreality to what otherwise is a very realistic set.
The Stanford Actors Project and "A Streetcar
Named Desire" speak well of the Stanford theatre's
potential, and hopefully there will be more to come.
