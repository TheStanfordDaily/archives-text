"Young Guns"
Century Cinema 10

Some movies rest on a strong
story line, fascinating content or
gripping action; others rely on a
pretty face. From the opening,
close-up shots of its brat-pack
stars, "Young Guns" relies too
heavily on the exterior of its seven

boys in blue jeans and fires a
promising story full of holes.
The story begins with good-guy
cattle rancher John Tunstall
(played by Terence Stamp) taking
the future Billy the Kidd (Emilio
Estevez) into his ranch of refine
ment for young thieves. The ear
nest Englishman — a Prof. Henry
Higgins in chaps — feeds, ed
ucates and trains the boys in ex
change for their services as cattle

guards, or regulators. The boys
guard the rancher's stock from
the evil Irish rancher L. G.
Murphy (Jack Palance), who uses
illegal buy-off tactics to monopo
lize the meat market and starve
the poor.
Unfortunately, within the first
few disheartening minutes of the
film, our hero Tunstall is brutally
murdered, leaving an unfocused
group of seven to pursue a 90-
minute vengeance. Enter St.
Elmo's Western. As if this turn
didn't stall the story enough, the
next leading character, played by
Charlie Sheen, is bumped off by
the bad guys in order to let Es
tevez lasso the lead.
Unfortunately, William Bonney
(a.k.a. Billy the Kidd) isn't con
vincing enough as hero or hooligan
to take the film anywhere. Bonney
doesn't have the justifiable moti
vations for revenge that the other
Regulators do, and we are left
with an immature, irresponsible
Rambo-cowboy to conduct the rest
of the gang.
The other characters provide
good distractions, but the lines
and screentime are spread be
tween too many of them to make
them any more than two
dimensional. Kiefer Sutherland as
Doc is the only Regulator of varied
substance with a turn for poetry
and a thirst for more than grungy
male companionship.
Despite these disclaimers, the
film is entertaining and worth
seeing. The action generally
carries the movie along. The
humor, similar to that in Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,

has trouble supporting seven
characters, but generally keeps
the crowd laughing.

"Cocktail"
Century Cinema 10

Even Tom Cruise, a bartender
with a "killer smile," can't charm
anyone into liking (never mind
actually praising) Touchstone Pic
tures' "Cocktail." In a word, the
movie is 'fluff; in two words, it's
'dumb fluff'; and the list of
derogatory adjectives to describe
it could go on.
Cruise plays Brian Flanagan, an
overconfident entrepreneur-to-be
who just can't seem to get a job
in investment banking, advertis

ing or communications. Funny
how that happens when one lacks
a college degree.
In need of money, Brian takes
a job as a bartender. Under the
guidance of veteran cocktail mixer
(and drinker) Doug Coughlin,
played by Bryan Brown ("Breaker
Morant"), Flanagan's career takes
off. Coughlin teaches Brian all the
tricks and soon they are perform
ing as they pour.
For all their showmanship, it
takes about 15 minutes to make
two drinks, which they promptly
down themselves. And it's impos
sible to believe that in a dance
club/ bar as huge as the one they
work in would only hire two
bartenders. What about the
thirsty customers?

The brat pack actors have shifted from modern America to the Wild
West with mixed success at best. Entertaining though hardly inspi
rational, "Young (Juns" (which opens today nationwide) blends
humor and action with an unfortunately weak story line.

Bartending Tom Cruise woos Elizabeth Shue in his latest movie
"Cocktail." Even Cruise's charisma, however, fails to carry the film
anywhere near the heights he flew in the smash hit "Top Gun."
