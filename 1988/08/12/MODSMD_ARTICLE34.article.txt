"Young Guns"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
Some movies rest on a strong
story line, fascinating content or
gripping action; others rely on a
pretty face. From the opening,
close-up shots of its brat-pack
stars, "Young Guns" relies too
heavily on the exterior of its seven

boys in blue jeans and fires a
promising story full of holes.
The story begins with good-guy
cattle rancher John Tunstall
(played by Terence Stamp) taking
the future Billy the Kidd (Emilio
Estevez) into his ranch of refine
ment for young thieves. The ear
nest Englishman — a Prof. Henry
Higgins in chaps — feeds, ed
ucates and trains the boys in ex
change for their services as cattle

guards, or regulators. The boys
guard the rancher's stock from
the evil Irish rancher L. G.
Murphy (Jack Palance), who uses
illegal buy-off tactics to monopo
lize the meat market and starve
the poor.
Unfortunately, within the first
few disheartening minutes of the
film, our hero Tunstall is brutally
murdered, leaving an unfocused
group of seven to pursue a 90-
minute vengeance. Enter St.
Elmo's Western. As if this turn
didn't stall the story enough, the
next leading character, played by
Charlie Sheen, is bumped off by
the bad guys in order to let Es
tevez lasso the lead.
Unfortunately, William Bonney
(a.k.a. Billy the Kidd) isn't con
vincing enough as hero or hooligan
to take the film anywhere. Bonney
doesn't have the justifiable moti
vations for revenge that the other
Regulators do, and we are left
with an immature, irresponsible
Rambo-cowboy to conduct the rest
of the gang.
The other characters provide
good distractions, but the lines
and screentime are spread be
tween too many of them to make
them any more than two
dimensional. Kiefer Sutherland as
Doc is the only Regulator of varied
substance with a turn for poetry
and a thirst for more than grungy
male companionship.
Despite these disclaimers, the
film is entertaining and worth
seeing. The action generally
carries the movie along. The
humor, similar to that in Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,

has trouble supporting seven
characters, but generally keeps
the crowd laughing.

"Cocktail"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
Even Tom Cruise, a bartender
with a "killer smile," can't charm
anyone into liking (never mind
actually praising) Touchstone Pic
tures' "Cocktail." In a word, the
movie is 'fluff; in two words, it's
'dumb fluff'; and the list of
derogatory adjectives to describe
it could go on.
Cruise plays Brian Flanagan, an
overconfident entrepreneur-to-be
who just can't seem to get a job
in investment banking, advertis

ing or communications. Funny
how that happens when one lacks
a college degree.
In need of money, Brian takes
a job as a bartender. Under the
guidance of veteran cocktail mixer
(and drinker) Doug Coughlin,
played by Bryan Brown ("Breaker
Morant"), Flanagan's career takes
off. Coughlin teaches Brian all the
tricks and soon they are perform
ing as they pour.
For all their showmanship, it
takes about 15 minutes to make
two drinks, which they promptly
down themselves. And it's impos
sible to believe that in a dance
club/ bar as huge as the one they
work in would only hire two
bartenders. What about the
thirsty customers?

The brat pack actors have shifted from modern America to the Wild
West with mixed success at best. Entertaining though hardly inspi
rational, "Young (Juns" (which opens today nationwide) blends
humor and action with an unfortunately weak story line.

Bartending Tom Cruise woos Elizabeth Shue in his latest movie
"Cocktail." Even Cruise's charisma, however, fails to carry the film
anywhere near the heights he flew in the smash hit "Top Gun."
But customers, and women
ones in particular, don't get much
respect from these bartenders.
Sexism runs rampant in this film
and there's no attempt to disguise
the chauvinistic macho attitude
that prevails. Cliches, bad jokes
and exploitation are the name of
the game
Brian gets so caught up in this
phony world of sex and easy
money that he can't even recog
nize a good thing when he's got
it. Elizabeth Shue ("Adventures
in Babysitting") plays Jordan
Mooney, a spirited young artist

whom Flanagan meets while bar
tending in Jamaica. Shue is cer
tainly attractive and intelligent
(she's a Harvard undergrad in
real life) but her character in
"Cocktail" doesn't give her much
to work with.
While Brian Flanagan shows us
what not to do when you fall in
love, the movie actually falls flat
in the romance department, losing
its only chance at redemption.
"Cocktail" is disappointing,
mindless and predictable non
sense that will have trouble warm
ing even a die-hard Tom Cruise
fan's heart. It's not worth the
price of admission. Skip the movie
and go to Haagen Daz instead.

"Clean and Sober"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
Good people do not always
make for a good film. With a
leading actor as charismatic and
versatile as Michael Keaton,
placed under the experienced di
rection of Glenn Gordon Caron
(the genius behind "Family Ties")
and in a screenplay whose topic
is definitely pertinent, "Clean and
Sober" should have been a much
better movie than the one that
opened Wednesday turns out to
be.
Keaton stars as Darryl Poynter,
a commercial real estate agent

who finds himself consumed by
the trappings of the playboy life
style he enjoys. Deep in debt to
the tune of $92,000 (the sum he
embezzled from a corporate
escrow account) and faced with
the cocaine-induced death of a
young lover, the anxious Darryl
checks into a drug rehabilitation
clinic to escape police pressure.
Unfortunately, the production
doesn't do justice to the topic.
"Clean" is a surprisingly inert
movie, filled with sterile single
dimensional characters that
barely garner the audience's sym
pathy. For the entire two hours,
the film limps along its unmerry
way without much emotion,
humor or real drama.

Trapped within the restricting
story line, however, the principal
actors nonetheless give some ster
ling performances. Though
Keaton constantly seems to be
restraining his comic instincts for
the sake of the film's serious tone
(even though Caron is adept at
blending comedy and drama, he
seems adamant to avoid this com
bination here in favor of a less
entertaining film), he plays his
role with sincerity and emotion.
Co-star Kathy Baker, as Dar
ryl's fellow patient/unlikely love
interest Charlie, does an admira
ble job as well in her limiting role.
Strapped with the burden of play
ing a feisty but pathetic character,
Baker shines.
The real kudos belong to Mor
gan Freeman (better known to
kids of all ages as Easy Reader
on the PBS program "The Electric
Company"). In his first film
role, playing the sadly under
developed character of drug
counselor Craig, Freeman makes
a tremendous amount out of the
little he is given to work with,
showing true potential for a film
career with even more promise
than his long stint on TV.
In all, "Clean" is a disappoint
ing showing for the talent it at
tempts to showcase. For Keaton
fans, the movie may well satisfy,
as he appears onscreen for just
about the entire movie and gives
a fine performance; however, for
fans of enjoyable film fare, this is
one to be missed.

"Young Guns"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
Some movies rest on a strong
story line, fascinating content or
gripping action; others rely on a
pretty face. From the opening,
close-up shots of its brat-pack
stars, "Young Guns" relies too
heavily on the exterior of its seven

boys in blue jeans and fires a
promising story full of holes.
The story begins with good-guy
cattle rancher John Tunstall
(played by Terence Stamp) taking
the future Billy the Kidd (Emilio
Estevez) into his ranch of refine
ment for young thieves. The ear
nest Englishman — a Prof. Henry
Higgins in chaps — feeds, ed
ucates and trains the boys in ex
change for their services as cattle

guards, or regulators. The boys
guard the rancher's stock from
the evil Irish rancher L. G.
Murphy (Jack Palance), who uses
illegal buy-off tactics to monopo
lize the meat market and starve
the poor.
Unfortunately, within the first
few disheartening minutes of the
film, our hero Tunstall is brutally
murdered, leaving an unfocused
group of seven to pursue a 90-
minute vengeance. Enter St.
Elmo's Western. As if this turn
didn't stall the story enough, the
next leading character, played by
Charlie Sheen, is bumped off by
the bad guys in order to let Es
tevez lasso the lead.
Unfortunately, William Bonney
(a.k.a. Billy the Kidd) isn't con
vincing enough as hero or hooligan
to take the film anywhere. Bonney
doesn't have the justifiable moti
vations for revenge that the other
Regulators do, and we are left
with an immature, irresponsible
Rambo-cowboy to conduct the rest
of the gang.
The other characters provide
good distractions, but the lines
and screentime are spread be
tween too many of them to make
them any more than two
dimensional. Kiefer Sutherland as
Doc is the only Regulator of varied
substance with a turn for poetry
and a thirst for more than grungy
male companionship.
Despite these disclaimers, the
film is entertaining and worth
seeing. The action generally
carries the movie along. The
humor, similar to that in Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,

has trouble supporting seven
characters, but generally keeps
the crowd laughing.

"Cocktail"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
Even Tom Cruise, a bartender
with a "killer smile," can't charm
anyone into liking (never mind
actually praising) Touchstone Pic
tures' "Cocktail." In a word, the
movie is 'fluff; in two words, it's
'dumb fluff'; and the list of
derogatory adjectives to describe
it could go on.
Cruise plays Brian Flanagan, an
overconfident entrepreneur-to-be
who just can't seem to get a job
in investment banking, advertis

ing or communications. Funny
how that happens when one lacks
a college degree.
In need of money, Brian takes
a job as a bartender. Under the
guidance of veteran cocktail mixer
(and drinker) Doug Coughlin,
played by Bryan Brown ("Breaker
Morant"), Flanagan's career takes
off. Coughlin teaches Brian all the
tricks and soon they are perform
ing as they pour.
For all their showmanship, it
takes about 15 minutes to make
two drinks, which they promptly
down themselves. And it's impos
sible to believe that in a dance
club/ bar as huge as the one they
work in would only hire two
bartenders. What about the
thirsty customers?

The brat pack actors have shifted from modern America to the Wild
West with mixed success at best. Entertaining though hardly inspi

humor and action with an unfortunately weak story line.

Bartending Tom Cruise woos Elizabeth Shue in his latest movie
"Cocktail." Even Cruise's charisma, however, fails to carry the film
anywhere near the heights he flew in the smash hit "Top Gun."
But customers, and women
ones in particular, don't get much
respect from these bartenders.
Sexism runs rampant in this film
and there's no attempt to disguise
the chauvinistic macho attitude
that prevails. Cliches, bad jokes
and exploitation are the name of
the game
Brian gets so caught up in this
phony world of sex and easy
money that he can't even recog
nize a good thing when he's got
it. Elizabeth Shue ("Adventures
in Babysitting") plays Jordan
Mooney, a spirited young artist

whom Flanagan meets while bar
tending in Jamaica. Shue is cer
tainly attractive and intelligent
(she's a Harvard undergrad in
real life) but her character in
"Cocktail" doesn't give her much
to work with.
While Brian Flanagan shows us
what not to do when you fall in
love, the movie actually falls flat
in the romance department, losing
its only chance at redemption.
"Cocktail" is disappointing,
mindless and predictable non
sense that will have trouble warm
ing even a die-hard Tom Cruise
fan's heart. It's not worth the
price of admission. Skip the movie
and go to Haagen Daz instead.

"Clean and Sober"
Century Cinema 10
Stierlin Rd. at 101
Mountain View
Good people do not always
make for a good film. With a
leading actor as charismatic and
versatile as Michael Keaton,
placed under the experienced di
rection of Glenn Gordon Caron
(the genius behind "Family Ties")
and in a screenplay whose topic
is definitely pertinent, "Clean and
Sober" should have been a much
better movie than the one that
opened Wednesday turns out to
be.
Keaton stars as Darryl Poynter,
a commercial real estate agent

who finds himself consumed by
the trappings of the playboy life
style he enjoys. Deep in debt to
the tune of $92,000 (the sum he
embezzled from a corporate
escrow account) and faced with
the cocaine-induced death of a
young lover, the anxious Darryl
checks into a drug rehabilitation
clinic to escape police pressure.
Unfortunately, the production
doesn't do justice to the topic.
"Clean" is a surprisingly inert
movie, filled with sterile single
dimensional characters that
barely garner the audience's sym
pathy. For the entire two hours,
the film limps along its unmerry
way without much emotion,
humor or real drama.

Trapped within the restricting
story line, however, the principal
actors nonetheless give some ster
ling performances. Though
Keaton constantly seems to be
restraining his comic instincts for
the sake of the film's serious tone
(even though Caron is adept at
blending comedy and drama, he
seems adamant to avoid this com
bination here in favor of a less
entertaining film), he plays his
role with sincerity and emotion.
Co-star Kathy Baker, as Dar
ryl's fellow patient/unlikely love
interest Charlie, does an admira
ble job as well in her limiting role.
Strapped with the burden of play
ing a feisty but pathetic character,
Baker shines.
The real kudos belong to Mor
gan Freeman (better known to
kids of all ages as Easy Reader
on the PBS program "The Electric
Company"). In his first film
role, playing the sadly under
developed character of drug
counselor Craig, Freeman makes
a tremendous amount out of the
little he is given to work with,
showing true potential for a film
career with even more promise
than his long stint on TV.
In all, "Clean" is a disappoint
ing showing for the talent it at
tempts to showcase. For Keaton
fans, the movie may well satisfy,
as he appears onscreen for just
about the entire movie and gives
a fine performance; however, for
