# Roble readied for 1989 reopening
## Construction to make the dorm earthquake safe is on schedule 
### Sally Hamaker Staff writer 
Demolition work on Roble Hall
is "80 percent complete" and the
dormitory should be earthquake
safe and ready to reopen by Sep
tember 1989, University Con
struction Supervisor Maggie Bur
gett said Wednesday.
In December, Roble was shut
down and its 294 student residents
were relocated to new dormitories
after the University's largest un
dergraduate dorm was judged to
be seismically unsafe.
This summer, parts of the 70-
year-old dormitory have been torn
down so that eight concrete "tow
ers" can be installed to seismically
brace the building, according to
Burgett.
Roble's reconstruction has gone
according to schedule this sum
mer, she said, estimating that
strengthening the building should
cost about $6 or $7 million. She
said an updated construction cost
estimate will be made Monday,
after completion of final architec
tural drawings for the construc
tion.
Roble was closed during winter
break this past year, after officials
discovered a photograph taken
during Roble's original construc
tion. The photo revealed that only
the building's frame and floors
were made of reinforced concrete,
while the exterior walls were ac
tually constructed with brittle,
hollow clay tile.

Satisfactory vertical and hori
zontal bracing, which would have
been provided by reinforced con
crete walls, was not possible with
the brittle clay tile walls. As a
result, University trustees found
themselves forced to decide be
tween razing or renovating the
four-class residence.
A final decision was made in
April to reconstruct the existing
ivy-covered building. The renova
tion project will cost about half
as much as it would have cost to
rebuild Roble.
Once the decision was made to
renovate the building, several
structural options were consid
ered. "We wanted to come in and
stabilize the building at the least
cost, and this (the eight-tower
plan) was the design that was cho
sen," said Burgett.
The eight-tower design consists
of two towers in each of the three
wings of the structure, as well as
two towers in Roble's central area.
The towers will reach the roof of
Roble but will not change its ap
pearance.
Demolition is necessary to allow
for installation of the concrete
towers within the building. The
towers will tie into the original
structure of the building and
"make it safe," according to Bur
gett.
After demolition is complete,
the towers will be built.
Also, a plywood diaphragm will
be added to the roof to "tie the
building together," she said. The

diaphragm is made of plywood
sheeting and will be attached to
the towers. Burgett said the
plywood structure will stabilize
the building.
"In an earthquake, the roof
might want to push exterior walls
out," Burgett said. The dia
phragm will help prevent such a
disaster.
Potentially dangerous asbestos
insulation within the walls and
in the basement of the building
is being vacuumed out and
removed from the dormitory
"only in areas where the construc
tion workers need to go," Burgett
said. "But we're not opening up
any walls looking for it (as
bestos)."
Inhaling asbestos has been
linked to certain types of lung
cancer. As a result, the hazardous
material must be cleared out
before tower construction can
begin.
Jack Alden, a Stanford graduate
in 1987 and resident assistant in
Roble from 1985 through 1987,
helped convince officials to
reconstruct the dormitory rather
than tear it down by launching
an alumni fund-raising drive in
March that secured approximately
$1,600 for the renovation.
All other student residences on
campus either have wood frames,
steel frames or reinforced con
crete walls, and therefore should
be safe in an earthquake, accord
ing to a recent campus-wide sur
vey.
