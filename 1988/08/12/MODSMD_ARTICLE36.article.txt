# Toxic fear causes permit protest
## Hearing on Stanford land use application set for August 18 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
Concerned about Stanford's
continuing problems with dis
posal and storage of toxic ma
terials, community organiza
tions are gearing up for a fight
next week against the Univer
sity's application for a long-term
land use permit.
The application predicts con
struction of extensive new sci
ence facilities, among a possible
25 percent increase in building
space, and says toxic use at the
University will be on the rise.
The report also predicts the
daytime population of the Uni
versity will increase by 14 per
cent.
A public hearing to discuss
Stanford's application and
report is scheduled for August
18. Members of the Stanford

Homeowner's Association said
they will attend the hearing to
raise questions about the Uni
versity's handling of toxic ma
terials in science laboratories.
Homeowners pointed to
several incidents over the last
few years that brought attention
to the issue of safety in and
outside of laboratories. For ex
ample, on July 25 the University
announced it had been dumping
radioactive wastes into a sewer
drain for almost a month, violat
ing local health laws.
"When are we going to see
some of these problems solved?"
wondered Patty Elsen, a mem
ber of the Stanford
Homeowner's Association.
"I really do feel that every
body needs to sit down, really
sit down, and get into the nitty
gritty," said Inge Harding-
Barlow, a toxicologist and a

member of the Barron Park As
sociation.
The University's permit ap
plication, released July 5, con
tains University plans for devel
oping land until the turn of the
century. The report studies in
detail potential impacts of Uni
versity growth on the Stanford
community.
Another area of concern to
community members was
health and safety. A study by
the Stanford Research Institute
of health and safety issues at
Stanford, released earlier this
year condemned the Depart
ment of Health and Safety for
being ineffective.
Alain Decleve, director of that
office, said he agrees problems
exist, but he said he does not
have the staff size to make sure
every researcher is following
safetv rules.
