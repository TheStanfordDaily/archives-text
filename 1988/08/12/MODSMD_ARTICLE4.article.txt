# Hoover researcher pushes 'brilliant pebbles'
## Teller meets with Reagan on SDI 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
Hoover Institution Senior Re
search Fellow Edward Teller and
other leading "Star Wars"
proponents met with President
Reagan two weeks ago to discuss
a new idea for the Strategic De
fense Initiative called "brilliant
pebbles" that would use swarms
of rockets to shoot down Soviet
missiles.
The meeting between Teller and
Reagan was also attended by Vice
President George Bush, Gen.
James Abrahamson who heads
the "Star Wars" program, Sec. of
Energy John Herrington and
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
Director John Nuckolls.
While Teller has not said
publicly that he supports the new
technique, Livermore scientists
say they believe Teller is behind
the plan because "brilliant

pebbles" is the work of a Teller
protege, controversial Livermore
physicist LowelJ Wood.
"It is a matter of common
knowledge that they are two peas
in a pod," said Livermore
physicist Ray Kidder, who has of
ten spoken out against Teller.
Teller, a physicist who is per
haps the scientist most responsi
ble for the current U.S. plan to
develop an SDI missile defense,
has been the chief backer of an
X-ray laser for SDI. His views on
Star Wars have come under attack
recently from several top scientists
at Livermore.
The name "brilliant pebbles"
comes from a similar weapon sys
tem known as "smart rocks."
"Smart rocks" is one of the chief
prospects for SDI but recent
Livermore research has led scien
tists to doubt their potential ef
fectiveness, Kidder said.
"Brilliant is smarter than

smart, pebbles are smaller than
rocks, and brilliant pebbles are
smarter and smaller than smart
rocks," Kidder said.
Wood and Teller's "brilliant
pebbles" are small rockets that
would be very elusive to Soviet
attempts to shoot them down and
would be completely independent
entities that could sense and
destroy Soviet missiles.
"The concept is to deploy a
number of small interceptors and
have them be responsible for ful
filling the entire functions of the
strategic defense," said Chris
Cunningham, a group leader in
the Evaluation and Planning Di
vision at Livermore.
According to Cunningham, each
of the "pebbles" would contain
their own sensors and microproc
essors that would serve as battle
guides. The plan is to have them
