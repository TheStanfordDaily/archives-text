Feeling the pinch from Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursements that are not keeping pace with
rising hospital costs, Stanford University Hospital
will raise its rates effective September 1.
The hospital experienced a $6.7 million shortfall
in payments from the government this fiscal year.
Unexpected cost increases are also partially respon
sible for the rate increase, which will total an average
of 13.8 percent.
"Expense increases that came upon us ... such
as AIDS protection" contributed to the necessity
for rate increases, according to Hospital Director
of Finance David Sakai.
"They're (the government) not paying us what
our increased costs are," Sakai explained. When
asked if Stanford was unique in feeling fiscal pres
sures from lagging government reimbursements,
Sakai responded "It's really a national thing."
Jean Altman, public relations officer for nearby
El Camino Hospital, concurred, saying "I think it's
a national trend. ... All hospitals are being im
pacted."
The new rates for the hospital were approved
Wednesday by the Board of Hospital Directors as
part of the operating budget for the 1988-89 fiscal
year. Included in the budget is the $153 million
Hospital Modernization Project, partially responsi
ble for the unforeseen costs.
The project is "not a complete replacement ...
it's a very substantial renovation," Sakai said.
