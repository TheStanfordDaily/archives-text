## U.S. cools relations with Burma 
### 
WASHINGTON - The United
States, which in the past has given
some limited support to the gov
ernment of Burma as part of the
American anti-drug campaign,
took steps yesterday to distance
itself from the regime of military
leader Sein Lwin in the wake of
its bloody suppression of anti
government protests.
A State Department spokesman
said that the situation in Burma
is "very unstable" with the out
come uncertain, and the United
States issued a new warning
against travel to Burma. Mean
while, U.S. officials privately
began suggesting that the regime
will fall and speculating about
what sort of leadership might take
its place.
"Any change is probably a good
change. Basically, what you have
is a failed government collapsing
on itself," one U.S. official said.
Although he said that he could
not predict what kind of govern
ment might take over power in
Burma, "the odds are that it will
turn towards the West because
the West has the money, trade
and resources to bail it out."
"We've got a massive revolution
going on. In my estimation, this
government can't last," said a
leading academic specialist on
Burma, Rutgers University Prof.
Joseph Silverstein. "The govern
ment has no popular support. The
people have spent 26 years getting
ready for this moment."
For the last quarter-century,
Burma's military leadershio has

carried out what it called the
country's own, independent road
to socialism. The military-backed
Burmese Socialist Party allowed
no opposition parties and pursued
an isolationist foreign policy,
avoiding close ties with any other
government.
At the same time, Burma has
become heavily involved in drug
production and trafficking.
"There's no doubt that Burma is
far and away the No. 1 source of
illicit opium production in the
world," a spokesman for the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administra
tion said Thursday.
According to estimates by the
DEA and the State Department,
last year Burma produced a crop
of between 925 and 1,230 metric
tons of opium — far more than
other opium-producing nations
such as Afghanistan.
In recent years, the United
States has sought the cooperation
of the Burmese regime to help
eradicate the opium crop. The
United States has given helicop
ters to Burma, trained Burmese
pilots and provided help for a pro
gram of aerial crop-spraying.
"The crop eradication program
has been a disaster," Silverstein
said. "After two years of spraying,
Burma produced more opium this
year than it ever has in the past."
He said that the United States
has ignored complaints of human
rights abuses in Burma and ac
cusations that American helicop
ters are being used in military
campaigns against dissident

groups. "The American position
has been that Burma is neutral,
and it cooperates with us in fight
ing against opium, so that
satisfies us," he said.
A State Department official said
that the department calls atten
tion to problems in Burma in its
annual worldwide human rights
reports to Congress. He said that
U.S. officials "are fairly confident
that our equipment is not being
used for purposes which we
couldn't condone."
Burma proved to be of consid
erable strategic importance dur
ing World War 11. The British
government viewed Burma as a
buffer preventing Japanese troops
from entering India, and the
United States used Burma to help
bring supplies to the Nationalist
regime of Chiang Kai-shek in
Western China.
Now, beyond the American
drug efforts, U.S. officials said
that they do not consider Burma
to be of great strategic signifi
cance.
One State Department special
ist on Asia said that Burma "is
not strategically located, but to
the extent that it is unstable, it
could have an effect on important
neighbors like Thailand and
China."
Lwin, one of the country's top
military leaders, was named
chairman of the Burmese Socialist
Party in July after Ne Win, who
had ruled Burma since 1962,
resigned.
