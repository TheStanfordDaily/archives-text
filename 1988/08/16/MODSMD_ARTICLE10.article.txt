# Stanford pushes state bill to give technology top priority
## 
### David Cline Staff writer 
To help the state stay tech
nologically competitive, Stanford
and other California research uni
versities are working with the
State Legislature to establish a
framework for pursuing lucrative
science projects and avoid the
sting of recent failures.
In the past two years, California
has lost national bids for lucrative
projects like a $4.4 billion federal
super collider, a National Science
Foundation-funded earthquake
research center and a $1.5 billion
semicondutor research consor
tium.

But now a three-bill package
currently making its way through
the Legislature can help Califor
nia regain its competitive edge,
according to University Assistant
Director of Government Affairs
Pete Sidebottom.
"We have been left scrambling
at the last minute on some of
these things," Sidebottom said.
"Now, we will be able to lay some
long term plans."
Heading the package with
regard to Stanford is a resolution
introduced by State Assemblyman
Sam Farr (D-Stockton) that
would request the Presidents of
four California universities to es
tablish a Council on Science and

Technology.
"The Council will look at issues
long-term," Sidebottom said.
They will address issues like
"What should the state research,"
and "where does all this research
lead us," he said.
The resolution calls upon Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
to join the presidents of California
Institute of Technology, the Uni
versity of Southern California and
the president of the University of
California system in appointing a
council of distinguished scientists
and industrial leaders to help
identify and address issues of sci
entific importance to California.
In addition, the council would

help inform the Legislature and
the Governor about recent scien
tific advances and give guidance
in deciding how to use the re
search — and possibly state fund
ing — to stay technologically com
petitive.
Two other bills in the package
set up an advisory Commission
on Science and Technology. These
bills, proposed by Assemblyman
Charles Quackenbush (R-Sara
toga) and Senator John
Garamendi (D-Carmel), provide
up to $25 million to encourage
development of new technologies.
According to Sidebottom, the
package is likely to pass before
the Legislature ends its two-year

session at the end of this month.
But the money set aside to fund
the project may be decreased, he
said.
"This is the first time that these
four universities have been asked
by the Legislature to determine
what are the mqjor research goals
for private industry, the univer
sities and the state," Sidebottom
said.
The resolution signals a sharp
break from the past, when
Legislature officials could barely
decide whether to even send a pro
posal for the super collider, ac
cording to Sidebottom. The res
olution currently has bipartisan
support.
