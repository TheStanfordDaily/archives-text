# Reagan overflows with praise for himself, Bush at convention

NEW ORLEANS - President
Reagan sought last night to trans
form the New Orleans Superdome
into an emotion-drenched arena
of tribute to his term in office, at
the same time placing the mantle
of Republican leadership on
George Bush, telling his vice pres
ident to "Go out there and make
it one more for the Gipper."
In remarks prepared for
delivery to the Republican Na
tional Convention, Reagan said "It
will take someone who has seen
this office from the inside, who
senses the danger points, will be
cool under fire and knows the
range of answers when the tough
questions come.
"That's the George Bush I've
seen up close — when the staff
and Cabinet members have closed
the door and when the two of us
are alone," Reagan said.
At the same time, the 77-year
old Reagan delivered a powerful
valedictory to his presidency that
bathed the delegates and televi
sion audience in nostalgia.
"Twilight? That's not possible,
because I confess there are times
when I feel like I'm still Dutch

Reagan racing my brother down
the hill to the swimming hole. ..."
Now, he said, as he plans to
leave the White House, he is
making plans for life on his ranch
near Santa Barbara, Calif. "But
I want you to know,"he said, "I'll
leave my phone number and ad
dress behind just in case you need
a foot soldier. Just let me know,
and I'll be there — as long as
words don't leave me and as long
as this sweet country strives to
be special during its shining mo
ment on Earth.
"Twilight, you say?" No,
Reagan said, it is "a new day —
our sunlit new day — to keep
alive the fire so that when we
look back at the time of choosing,
we can say that we did all that
could be done. Never less."
Just as Bush's speech to the
convention Thursday night is
viewed as the most important he
will give in his quest of the
presidency against Democrat Mi
chael Dukakis, the president's
speech last night was, perhaps,
the most important Reagan will
give for Bush.
