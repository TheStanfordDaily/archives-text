U.S. envoy: Tibet may open up
BEIJING — China has pledged to open up
strife-torn Tibet to greater numbers of foreign
travelers, journalists and diplomats, the U.S. am
bassador to China said yesterday.
Winston Lord, who visited Tibet from Aug.
4-10, told reporters that Tibetan and Chinese
officials had assured him that the country, which
has resisted Chinese rule for decades and has
been beset by anti-Chinese riots, was "not closed"
to tourists.
Since September, at least 11 people have been
killed and hundreds injured or arrested in riots
in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. Hundreds of Bud
dhist monks and other Tibetans were taken into
custody in March.
Lord, the first U.S. ambassador to China to
officially visit Tibet, said that officials in Lhasa
told him that all but 25 or 26 "of those detained
have been released." He that at least eight Bud
dhist monks or nuns were among those who
remained under arrest.
China has blamed the unrest on followers of
the Dalai Lama, the spiritual head of Tibetan
Buddhism, who has lived in India since fleeing
into exile in 1959.
Supporters of the Dalai Lama want indepen
dence for the huge but sparsely populated moun
tainous region, which Chinese troops entered in
1950.
Since the March disturbances, foreign cor
respondents have generally been unable to enter
Tibet on authorized reporting trips.
Chinese authorities — who require Beying
based correspondents to receive permission to
enter Tibet — have granted travel permits to
only a handful of reporters who last month ac
companied Australian Foreign Minister Bill
Hay Hen on an official tour of the region.
China also ha.* banned most individual
travelers to Tibet, insisting on group tours ar

ranged through officially-sanctioned travel agen
cies.
Despite these restrictions, Chinese officials
have claimed that Tibet is still open to visitors.
U.S. ship enters Soviet waters
In a joint scientific effort with Soviet scientists,
a U.S. research ship entered Soviet waters for
the first time in a decade yesterday, signaling
what researchers hope will be a thaw in relations
that worsened last year when President Reagan
vetoed Soviet participation in a global undersea
drilling project.
Researchers aboard the ship Thomas Washing
ton, operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanog
raphy, began mapping the seafloor and taking
rock samples from the Soviet portion of an un
dersea plateau in the Bering Sea, about 200 miles
east of the Kamchatka peninsula.
The team included two Soviet geophysicists
who were sharing the results of their own re
search in the area with Western scientists. Until
yesterday, the U.S. researchers had been able to
study only the half of the plateau that lies un
derneath international or U.S. waters near the
Aleutian Islands.
The Soviet data are useful for a planned 33-day
mission to the northernmost portion of a chain
of volcanoes that stretches from the Hawaiian
Islands, said Peter Lonsdale, a Scripps research
associate and chief scientist aboard the ship.
"They brought with them all of.. .the data
that their ships have collected, so we're able to
choose sites where they don't have coverage. And
we've also learned from their data where the
most valuable sites to visit are," Lonsdale said
in a telephone interview from the ship.
