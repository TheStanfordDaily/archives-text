## Leaving kittens for dead is both inhumane and illegal 
### 
I AND my co-workers at the
Stanford Recycling Center
often have to remove and
dispose of rotting food waste,
dirty diapers, used condoms,
styrofoam, plastic and other
contaminants while hand-baling
cardboard.
While we are often disap
pointed that some members of
the Stanford community con-

tinue to dump garbage into the
clearly marked, bright green
cardboard receptacles on
campus, we hope that such inci
dents result from ignorance, not
intention.
This past Friday, however,
while baling a load of â€¢
cardboard, we discovered two
kittens near a box full of saw
dust and cat droppings that had

obviously been their bedding.
One kitten miraculously sur
vived being dumped into a
front-loading truck, compacted,
and then dumped onto our
cardboard-handling area. It is
now waiting for a home at a
nearby animal shelter.
The other kitten was crushed
and was found dead.
To throw garbage into recy-

cling bins is thoughtless; to
intentionally dispose of live
animals in this manner is cruel
and inhumane, and illegal. Free
and convenient animal welfare
services are listed in the phone
book.
There is no excuse.
