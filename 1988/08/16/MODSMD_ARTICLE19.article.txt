# Stanford athletes deserve recognition
## 
### 
Congratulations on your nice
coverage of Stanford athletes
who are going to Seoul. It was
good to see them recognized.
However, I am amazed that you
left out at least two of our very
finest women alumni. Surely
this was just an oversight!
Nancy Ditz ('7B or '79) is one
of the most elite woman marat
honers in the world, and quali
fied for the second women's
Olympic marathon in Pitts
burgh, PA, earlier this year,
coming in second in a large
field of U.S. women runners.
Nancy has been running less
than 10 years and certainly
deserves a few good words from

her Alma Mater as well as
heartfelt encouagement from all
of us who will be watching and
wishing her the very best from
home. How could you leave her
out?
PattiSue Plumer ('B5, cur
rently attending Stanford Law
School) gave one of the gutsiest
displays of determination ever
seen as she took third place in
the Olympic Trials in In
dianapolis in July. This was in
the race for the 3,000 km team
She was third to the great
Mary Decker-Slaney, certainly
deserving of mention by her
Alma Mater.
Thank you for mentioning
Regina Jacobs and Jeff Atkin
son in Track and Field, since
they too need our encourage-

ment and good wishes.
