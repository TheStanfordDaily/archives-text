# Labor negotiations continue
## Students join USW team 
### Helen Willey Staff writer 
With progress towards a new
contract almost at a standstill be
tween the University and the
United Stanford Workers, stu
dents have been invited to join
the union's negotiating team in
collective bargaining sessions.
Beginning last week, three stu
dents were present at each of three
negotiating sessions as the union
and the University tried to agree
on a new contract before the cur
rent one expires August 31.
Students who have joined the
union's negotiating team are all
members of politically-active
campus organizations, including
the Black Student Union, Stan
ford's Chicano/Latino student or
ganization, MEChA, the Asian
American Student Association,
the ASSU Senate and the ASSU
Council of Presidents.
"We want to demonstrate that
we support the USW," said Stacey
Leyton, a member of the COP,
who sat on the negotiating team.
"We feel that there's an unwill
ingness on the part of the Uni
versity to be honest and open

about what's going on behind
closed doors," she added, noting
that the only way students could
attend the negotiations was as
part of the union's negotiating
team.
Student participation on the un
ion's negotiating team is the latest
in a series of events in which the
union has asked for student sup
port in contract negotiations.
In May, the USW requested
that bargaining sessions be
opened to public scrutiny. The un
ion then asked that students be
allowed to attend negotiations as
neutral observers. The request
was turned down by the Univer
sity.
The University also refused the
USW's request this summer that
the negotiating session be tape
recorded or transcribed.
"I'm stunned at how arrogant
the University is in the bargain
ing," said Louis Jackson, a mem
ber of the BSU who attended last
Friday's negotiating session. "It's
really gross the way (University
spokesperson) Michael Vartain
talks down to the union mem
bers."
The attorney for the union
Mary Mocine said Vartain walked
out of the negotiating sessions "in
a huff" Friday and set no agenda
for the next round of talks, sched
uled to resume today.
Contacted by telephone yester
day, Vartain declined to comment.
Mocine also said the union is
pleased with the students' com
mitment to the negotiations. She
said the presence of students will
help mitigate any animosity be

tween the union and the Univer
sity.
"The union feels like students
are part of the Stanford commu
nity and we want their input,"
said Mocine yesterday. "Having
students there may keep the Uni
versity a little more respectful."
But students said the Univer
sity has not changed its tone in
negotiations since they have
begun attending.
"The University is playing
games; they're posturing," said
Leyton. Added Jackson, "It's so
blatant that Stanford wants to
take control of the union."
