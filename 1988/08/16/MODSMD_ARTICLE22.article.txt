## Feeding cats isn't worth it 
### 
Anyone who knows me
can tell you how much I
love cats. I have a definite
soft spot for them, and they are
without a doubt my favorite ani
mal. So when news of the wide
spread cat problem at Stanford
came to light in The Daily, I had
mixed feelings.
On the one hand, I was happy
to know that people like Assistant
Lands Manager Diane Paulson
are genuinely concerned for these
animals' welfare. I sincerely hope
that the cat problem on campus
will continue to be handled with
practicality and compassion.
On the other hand, I felt sad
ness for the stray cats who inev
itably will be put to sleep. Com
mon sense tells us that in order
to solve the problem the majority
of these cats have to be removed
to animal shelters. Since most of
these cats cannot be tamed, they
also cannot be adopted, and we
all know the rest.
Some people may scofT at all
the attention directed towards
cats.
I admire dogs as pets, too, but
one must admit that cats get a
lot less complaints from the neigh
bors, not to mention the mailman.
And that is why cats, as
adorable as they can be at times,

have overpopulated this campus.
Think about it — any other
domesticated animal would have
caused alarm a lot sooner if its
population on campus had grown
considerably larger within a short
period of time.
My sophomore year I lived in
Grove-Lasuen, a Row house resi
dence. Last October I noticed that
a litter of four kittens and their
mother were living under the
house. Since I knew they would
not be actually living inside the
house, I did not feel guilty about
wanting to adopt these helpless
felines.
By the time these kittens grew
into cats, their mother had left
and they were impossible to ig
nore. The cats had become
familiar to me and other Grove
residents who regularly fed them,
so every time they would see one
of us outside, they would meow
and follow us for more food.
Towards the end of the school
year, by suggestion of the Row
Facilities, the Grove residents
agreed to use house funds to spay
and neuter our cats. It did not
matter. When I returned to Grove
at the start of summer vacation,
the four cats were gone. Most like
ly, they were put to sleep.
So my advice to people on

campus who continue to feed stray
cats is: it's not worth it. For nine
months, the "Grove cats" were
fed, sympathized over and given
complete attention, and for what?
Only one of the cats even even
tually let us touch it. The rest of
them hissed and ran away if a
person came within two feet of
them.
I'm not advocating a complete
cat extermination at Stanford.
The few stray cats that are com
fortable around people are the
ones who should be found more
suitable homes,
I guess I will always have an
affection for cats. But there comes
a time when even a cat lover must
recognize the difference between
a pet and a hopelessly wild stray
animal, and accept that difference.
