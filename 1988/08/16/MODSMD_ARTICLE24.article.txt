## Letters Election outcome in Mexico is critical for Mexicans and for the U.S. 
### 
URUAPAN, MICHOACAN,
Mexico — Every after
noon the leaden skies
dump their contents on this
bustling town of 500,000. The
cobbles streets still have their
small town flavor as people
from the villages bring their
goods to market.
There is an electric undercur
rent beneath the daily routine

due to the confusion and debate
surrounding the results of
Mexico's recent elections on
July 6. In what can be said to
be the most important elections
since the Mexican Revolution,
the ruling PRI (Institutional
Party of Revolution) saw itself
seriously challenged from both
the left and the right.
Although the PRI has

proclaimed victory, the left-of
center coalition as well as the
right-wing PAN party are both
claiming widespread election
fraud. The PRI, which has not
lost an election since its incep
tion 59 years ago, faced a voral
opposition movement on the left
headed by Cuahutemoc Car
denas, son of the late Lazaro
Cardenas (president of the Re
public from 1934 to 1940).
Cuahutemoc Cardenas'
popularity is due in part to the
legacy of his father, who is re
sponsible for many of Mexico's
social reforms in favor of cam
pesinos and workers (including
the nationalization of the oil
industry).
In a country where the elec
tion results have traditionally
been known beforehand, there
is now a renewed interest in the
electoral process.
The presidential campaigns
saw intense political activity on
a local and national level. Large
crowds attended political meet
ings around the country — a
Cardenas campaign stop in
Uruapan in June attracted a
crowd estimated at 100,000
people. A Cardenas demonstra

tion on June 27 drew over a
million people to the Zocolo in
Mexico City.
Cardenas' charisma, the
legacy of his father and, most
importantly, the hope for change
has attracted a wide variety of
followers to his campaign. Un
like some PRI and PAN demon
strations, Cardenas' meetings
are well attended by people of
all social levels who, it might be
added, are not transported from
rally to rally (a common prac
tice to enhance crowd sizes is to
bus supporters and also to offer
free sandwiches and beer).
The relatively peaceful cam
paign was marred before the
election by the assassination of
two key campaign workers.
The proclaimed victory of the
PRI has dashed hopes for a
change in the traditional rela
tionship between the govern
ment and the people. According
to Democratic Front leaders, the
PRI was able to manipulate the
election results in the week of
post-election counting in order
to give itself the victory.
On July 16, a crowd of
60,000 gathered in the plaza of
Uruapan to protest the an-

nounced results. The same day
a million people gathered to
protest the alleged fraud in
Mexico City.
The right of center group,
PAN, is also claiming fraud and
has called for civil disobedience.
The feeling on the street is that
the election was stolen and that
as the economic crises here
increase, efforts to organize
successful opposition groups will
rise in intensity.
Although Carlos Salinas de
Gortari will assume power, the
next few months will be critical
for Mexico and the United
States. Questions concerning
Mexico's immense foreign debt,
its internal economic crises and
the future direction of its politi
cal process are still unanswered.
It will be interesting to ob
serve the response of the new
government to rising internal
pressure for increased political
participation and overall respon
siveness from the present gov
ernment.
