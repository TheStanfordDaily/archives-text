## Of dreams and disorders: the shadowy world of sleep Sleep researcher speaks on the mysterious one-third of life 
### Todd Pierce Editorial staff 
Editor's note: William Dement, a
professor of psychology here, has
been a pioneer in the field of sleep
research for more than 30 years.
His 1972 book, Some Must Watch
While Some Must Sleep was one
of the first books written for the
non-scientist on sleep and sleeping
disorders.
The following is an edited ver
sion of an interview that took place
at the Stanford Sleep Disorders
Center, which Dement founded in
1970 and where he continues to
work today.
tp: Lately we've been hearing
about lucid dreaming, in which
people are aware they are dream
ing while the dream is taking
place. Can you elaborate?
wd: The salient feature of the
average dream is the powerful
sense of reality. In other words,
the dreamer has no indication
that this is not reality. Even when
events in the dream are tremen
dously bizarre and incongruous,
the dreamer still behaves as if
they were real. ... For you and
me and everyone who dreams, the
dream is real while it lasts —
almost all the time. Can you say
more of life?
tp: Right.
wd: In dreams, the brain creates
a complete perceptual world. The
fact that our memory in the
waking state is incomplete means
nothing. The dream world may
be even more complete than we
realize because our memory is
faulty; it is an incomplete repre
sentation of what really happens,
even in the waking state.
So that's remarkable in and of
itself, the fact that the brain does
this because not only does it have
to create whatever underlies the
perceptual, sensory phenomenon,
it actually perceives and responds.
The brain in a sense is doing three
things.
tp: So what makes someone
dream lucidly?
wd: It may be a heightened ac
tivation, it might be terror, it

might be both. The dreamer be
comes aware that he is in the
dream world. I don't think it's
necessarily suddenly realizing
"This is so bizarre, it has to be
a dream."
It's just something that hap
pens, although some people ap
pear to be willing to dream lucidly
in an effort to control frightening
dreams. Like someone dreaming
that a dinosaur is about to eat
them and then they wake up and
from waking up they learn to per
ceive that "No, this isn't true."
tp: How about techniques you
use to help people presently suf
fering from sleeping ailments?
What are some of the most com
mon sleep disorders you see at
the center?
wd: The most common disorder
we see is called obstructive sleep
apnea, which means that breath
ing stops during sleep because of
the collapse of the upper airways.
You suck the airways cold and
you cannot breathe.
This afflicts about four percent
of the general population and it
increases in prevalence as the pop
ulation gets older. It is a very
serious problem when it's severe
and may be associated with hy
pertension, heart disease and
premature death during sleep.
Usually what happens is the
sleeper stops breathing and then
wakes up to breathe. This cycle
is repeated through the night
hundreds of times. And those very
many awakenings mean the per
son afflicted with this condition
cannot recieve the restorative ben
efit of sleep because sleep is so
fragmented.
What presupposes to this but
does not, in fact, produce a pa
thology in the waking state, is a
variety of reasons, usually purely
anatomical. The actual size of the
upper airways is a little smaller
in these patients in the waking
state so they're predisposed to it.
But it's a pathological sort of
an over-relaxation of airway
muscles or inhibition of their ac
tivity during sleep.
tp: So that's a real medical
problem, isn't it?
wd: No, it's a sleep problem.

The sleeping brain fails to regu
late upper airway functions.
The most common in the pop
ulation is the complaint of insom
nia. The nature of it is just like
a headache, a backache or a cough.
It has a multiplicity of causes.
What causes someone to feel that
they weren't sleeping? Often
people think they aren't sleeping
and they are.
You see, the sleeping brain is
active. It changes its world of
functions like a marvelous com
puter with one operating system
for wakefulness and another one
for sleep. The brain is still work
ing and active and so you can
have pathologies.
We've wound up with, con
servatively, 100 million people in
the United States who have a
sleep problem that is diagnosible.
tp: The prevalence of sleeping
problems must foster a lot of
myths. What are some popular
misconceptions about sleep?
wd: One is that some people
never dream and another is that
dreaming is fleeting and evanes
cent. The truth is that we dream
on a very regular basis.
The intense dreaming associ
ated with REM (Rapid Eye Move
ment) sleep occurs every 90
minutes through the night. The
average duration is 22 minutes,
and tbose 22-minute periods tend
to be broken up into five and 10
minute periods. We actually have
about 20 complete dream stories
every single night of our lives.
tp: Really, we have 20 complete
dream stories?
wd: Well, they aren't complete
in the sense that a novel's com
plete. The way dreams begin and
end is fascinating. Sometimes
they seem to have a denouement,
sometimes they just end abruptly.
Normal human beings go from
wakefulness to non-REM sleep at
night. Non-REM sleep is a state
where intense dreaming does not
occur but there may be thoughts
and images. The narcoleptic, on
the other hand, goes from wake
fulness immediately into REM
sleep and you can follow the de
velopment of the dream. It often
starts where reality leaves off.

tp: Do scientists know exactly
why you think a dream was real
when you wake up and then you
realize, 10 or 15 minutes later,
that it wasn't?
wd: I think that dream can only
be distinguished from reality
when you realize the event oc
curred in the bedtime period. Or
if you realize that there's some
incongruity. So I'm sure many of
our memories are dream memor
ies that we think are real because
we have no way to tell the differ
ence.

tp: Do people's dreams change
as they grow alder?
wd: There are a lot of studies
that suggest that they change
somewhat, but dreams are wildly
variable in their content — within
individuals, among individuals,
and across the life span. So the
trends are not strong ones.
tp: Getting back to sleep disor
ders, can you tell me about the
Sleep Disorders Center?


April Pearson — Daily
William Dement, founder of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Center,
postulates on the nature and difficulties of sleep. He called attention
to society's new perception of sleep as an act of volition.
wd: Stanford had the first sleep
disorders clinic in the world where
people who had complaints about
their sleep could receive diagnosis
and treatment. That was initiated
in 1970 so this is only 18 years old.
In 1975 there were five places
in the United States where you
could go to get help. Now there
are about 200 recognized sleep
disorders clinics. This tremendous
expansion has happened because
there are millions of people who
in fact need help.
tp: What exactly do you do when
someone comes in with a com
plaint?
wd: Well, with something like
apnea, they complain about in
somnia, they say they can't stay
awake in the daytime or they have
abnormal behavior in their sleep.
This abnormal behavior can be
sleepwalking, screaming, as well
as unusual, very loud snoring. It
is our job to examine, take a his
tory from the patient, test the
patient and arrive at a specific
diagnosis of the cause. We need
a test because the pathology is
occurring during sleep.
The very sleepy person, the
pathologically sleeping person,
will sometimes fall asleep in less
than a minute on every single
test.
So will the typical Stanford stu
dent. A normal person might fall
asleep in 10 minutes, something
like that. Sleep deprivation will
cause that.
Most Americans are chronically
sleep-deprived — they don't know
how much sleep they need. The
normal 20-year-old needs about
nine-and-a-half hours of sleep at
night. My bet is that most Stan

ford students don't get that.
tp: What can happen as a result
of sleep deprivation?
wd: You can fall asleep driving.
I'm now involved in a lawsuit
where the worker was required
to work long hours, seven days a
week. He fell asleep, went through
a red light and killed two people.
The family is suing the com
pany — the driver doesn't have
20 million dollars but the com
pany does — and both the com
pany and the driver are liable.
Sleepiness may be the most
dangerous thing in the wortd be
cause the great nuclear disasters
of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island
and Oak Harbor all occurred dur
ing the night, when the workers
were very sleepy.
Shift workers have sleep dis
turbances or are chronically sleep
deprived. Many other disasters —
railway disasters, airplane dis
asters — occur as a result of
sleepiness, insufficient sleep, shift
work, and jet lag. So this is an
enormous problem that, if you'll
pardon the pun, the public is
starting to wake up to.
tp: What do you see in the next
10 years or so for sleep research?
wd: I see many discoveries
about the function of sleep, many
ways to manipulate sleep, and an
understanding of the role of sleep
in the total life process.
And possibly a freedom from
the tyranny of sleep, in the sense
that we might, if we understand
the sleep process, be able to use
it more flexibly. We might induce
sleep when we need sleep, and
stay awake when we needed to be
awake.
I think to answer the question
"What is sleep really for?" with
conviction and in some detail will
be one of the most exciting ad
ventures in modern science.
