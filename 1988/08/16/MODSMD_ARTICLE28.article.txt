## Kay Boyle's stories are luxuriant evocations of life 
### Melissa Walter 
The most attractive feature of
Kay Boyle's "Life Being the Best
and Other Stories" is the sensitive
and vibrant imagery of these 13
short stories. Some, like rich and
lavish art films, offer a fictional
world so vividly portrayed that
the reader feels able to enter and
inhabit it, to see it with the "in
ward eye" of the imagination.
"Paris has a grief all its own
on some nights in December. If
you walked the streets all night
with it you could not make it
sleep," she writes, in "Art Col
ony." In the story, members of a
commune are disillusioned by the
betrayal of their leader, who used
the proceeds from his idealistic
speeches to buy a fancy car. Boyle
herself lived in such a commune
with her daughter, until her dis-

each time the new ar
ching wave, and
woman the undertow
that sucked him back,
were things she had
been told by his silence
were so.'

illusionment led her to kidnap
back her daughter and escape.
An American living in Paris in
the 19205, and intermittently until
the Second World War, Boyle
produced a huge corpus of fiction.
But then, as now, her work was
little known.
The stories in this collection

were first published from 1930 to
1936, and they reflect an interest
in contrasts between European
cultures and an enchantment with
pastoral life. Yet the main concern
of the 13 stories is, as Sandra
Whipple Spanier explains in her
excellent introduction, "the abso
lute essentiality of love ... and a
sense of tragic loss when human
connections fail."
Tragic loneliness appears most
strikingly in the final tale, "His
Idea of a Mother," in which an
orphan boy escapes his tyrannical
aunt to he next to a cow in a
night field, seeking comfort. The
cinematic detail makes his desola
tion immediate, and the complete
ness of the image prevents the
desolation, which the reader
shares, from being ugly or dis
gusting.
In the title story, a young

schoolteacher in rural southern
France tries to nurture a bru
talized immigrant boy to the
strength and security of knowl
edge. They walk through a drip
ping misty wood towards a monas
tery, and their halting conversa
tion is punctuated by a cuckoo
searching for its mate, which the

schoolmaster lures along with
them as he talks.
The innocence of the scene com
plements its delicate purity, which
becomes gently erotic, and though
the story ends in tragedy, it is
the beauty of images such as this
that remain with the reader. In
fact, the negative element seems
forced and abstract in this story.
The theme of seduction man
queÂ§ is more traditionally por
trayed in "Peter Foxe." Here, a
mountain climber and a governess
are magnetically drawn together
a la D.H. Lawrence, by the beauty
of a mountain scene and their
shared nationality (both are Eng
lish people in Austria), but the
spell is broken by the wounding
of a goat. The man is really more
concerned for the beautiful golden
goat than for the woman.
In"The Astronomer's Wife,"
the woman is constrained by her
marriage, and Boyle incisively
shows how her own mind has been
co-opted in this oppression. Boyle
writes, "That man might be each
time the new arching wave, and
woman the undertow that sucked
him back, were things she had
been told by his silence were so."
The roundabout quality of the
sentence reflects the a 11 -
wrongness of the situation.
Yet Boyle is by no means
obsessed with the disempower
ment of women. The persona of
her epistolary piece, "Letters of a
Lady," wins a battle of wits, while
the reader scrambles to under
stand the implication of every
word. The story is a fascinating,
gracefully worded jig-saw puzzle.
The judicious wording charac
teristic of the collection of stories
makes them worth savoring, but
occasionally Boyle's effort to in
clude only the essential renders
the prose choppy and confusing.

Imagery becomes difficult to fol
low and good will on the part of
the reader is required in puzzling
it all out.
Such confusion is not unusual
in modernist writing. As a mem
ber of the American expatriate set
at the beginning of the 20th Cen
tury in Paris, Boyle was involved
in the movement dubbed the
Revolution of the Word, though
she herself claims that the only
reason all those Americans were
living in Paris in the 1920s was
the favorable exchange rate.
As a heterosexual woman, Boyle
was removed both from the main
stream of modernism (occupied by
men), and from independent les
bians, such as Gertrude Stein,
Natalie Barney and Sylvia Beach.
Boyle was married several times,
and raised eight children, six of
whom were her own.

Then, as now, her
work was little known.

After leaving Paris in the sec
ond World War, she became a
foreign correspondent for the New
Yorker 1953, until she and her
husband were blacklisted follow
ing a loyalty hearing.
Boyle's concerns became more
and more political, progressing
from the insular modernist aes
thetic, through the concern for
human connection evidenced in
these stories, to stances of out
right political activism. From
1963 she taught at San Francisco
State. She went to jail with Joan
Baez and participated in the stu
dent strike of 1968.
