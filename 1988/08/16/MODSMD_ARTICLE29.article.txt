# Diversity will be theme of Orientation

According to Tom McKean, general coordinator
of this fall's Orientation week for frosh and trans
fers, the most important task of Orientation will
be "to paint Stanford as a multi-racial, multi
cultural community greater than the sum of all its
parts."
This summer, McKean is working with coordina
tors of black, Chicano/Latino, Asian American, Na
tive American and International Orientation com
mittees, as well as coordinators in charge of special
areas such as transfers, Parents' Day and transpor
tation.
Some Orientation programs in the fall will directly
address the promises as well as the problems of a
diverse community.
Psychology Prof. Ewart Thomas, dean of Human
ities and Sciences, will speak on Stanford history
and the current campus climate; a workshop on
residential education in a diverse setting will be

held in the dorms; and the ASSU Council of Presi
dents will sponsor an Orientation program for the
first time. The program will be called "The Fire
Within" and will feature performances and presen
tations of music, drama, dance and poetry by Stan
ford students of color.
According to McKean, this fall's Orientation will
be significantly different from last year's in two
ways.
First of all, Orientation, in keeping with the goals
of residential education at Stanford, will be based
more in student residences this year. There will
also be a new event, a Welcome Reception in the
Quad, featuring food and all of Stanford's singing
groups.
Kathy Chen, Asian American co-coordinator, said
Orientation will attempt to present as much of Stan
ford to new students as possible in a week's time.
While this should provide "a feel, a general idea"
of what Stanford is like, new students should also
realize that the University has "so much to offer."
