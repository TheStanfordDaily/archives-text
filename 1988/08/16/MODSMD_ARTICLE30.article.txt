## Coach Quick will leave Texas to take job here 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Quick, make reservations for
the women's swimming NCAAs.
Not quick as in do it soon, but
Quick as in Richard, who has an
nounced that after he finishes
coaching the Olympic team he'll
be leaving the University of Texas
at Austin to coach the women's
team here.
The 45-year-old formally an
nounced that he would accept the
job Saturday. He'll be replacing
George Haines, 64, whose retire
ment is official at the end of Au
gust.
Haines is something of a living
legend and Quick pointed out he
couldn't hope to compete with his
legacy. In 38 years of coaching,
swimmers under Haines' tutelage
won 35 Olympic gold medals, 11
silvers and seven bronzes.
But Quick is well on his way
to the legend category himself. In
six years at Texas, he won six
Southwest Conference titles, five
straight NCAA crowns and 130
of the 135 dual meets in which
his team competed.
"It's impossible to replace
George Haines, but if you're
looking for the next best person,
it's Richard Quick," Stanford
men's Coach Skip Kenney noted.
"Richard has the reputation, the

national titles and all those vic
tories. At least on paper, you're
bringing in someone who can com
pete with a legend."
"Stanford represents a new
challenge in a different part of the
country," Quick told the Times
Tribune. "I look at it as a tre
mendous lifetime experience. I'm
extremely impressed with the ath
letic department and the Stanford
community.
"It's extremely difficult for me
to leave the University of Texas,
because the University of Texas
has given me outstanding support.
"I just have a gut feeling that
going to Stanford is something I
should do, at this point in my
life," Quick said.
Haines noted that Stanford's
stringent entrance requirements
will make it difficult for Quick to
duplicate the feats he performed
at Texas. "He won't be able to
get the same swimmers into Stan
ford as he did at Texas," Haines
said.
It seems that challenge excites
Quick, however. He announced
Sunday that he expects the
United States to win more gold
medals, and more swimming
medals overall, than any other
country in the upcoming Olym
pics despite a subpar performance
by the U.S team at the last World
Championships in 1986.
