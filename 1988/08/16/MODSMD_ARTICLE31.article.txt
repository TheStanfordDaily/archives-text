## Third-string quarterback leaves Stanford for Saddleback JC 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Scott Stark, Stanford's third-string
quarterback, is back in the saddle again.
The junior from Mission Viejo an
nounced Friday that he will transfer to
Saddleback Junior College in his home
town.
"Scott was third on the depth chart
and he was concerned about potential
playing time," coach Jack Elway said.
"I think he saw the job (Brian) Johnson
did last year and saw (Jason) Palumbis
coming on and he thought he would
have a better opportunity elsewhere."
Stark came to Stanford as a highly
touted recruit out of Capistrano Valley
High School. He led the state in passing

in 1985, completing 225 of 326 passes
for 3,154 yards and 20 touchdowns.
Stark redshirted during his freshman
year and then played impressively in
spring practice. He moved to No. 2 on
the depth chart and got his big chance
after the Cardinal got off to an 0-3 start
last year under Greg Ennis.
Elway inserted Stark as the starter
in the fourth game. Unfortunately, that
contest pitted the Cardinal against then
11th ranked UCLA. The game was a
disaster for Stark and Stanford.
Stark threw two early interceptions
before Elway replaced him with Ennis
in the closing minutes of the first half.
Stark then returned for the third quar
ter.
Stanford lost the game 49-0. Brian

Johnson became the starting quarter
back in the next game and would hold
the job for the rest of the season.
Johnson would guide the Cardinal to
five wins in its final seven games.
