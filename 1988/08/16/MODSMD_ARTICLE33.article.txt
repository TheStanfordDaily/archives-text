"You're on top of the world one
second, the next you find yourself
descending the stairs. Thirty
minutes ago, my swimming career
ended," Pablo Morales said after
finishing 12th in the preliminar
ies of the 200-meter individual
medley and eliminating any
chance of earning himself a berth
on the 1988 Olympic swim team.
That race brought an unfortu

nate end to the storybook swim
ming career of Morales. The finest
swimmer in the history of Stan
ford, if not the NCAA, Morales
captured 11 collegiate titles.
In the '84 Games, Morales
earned one gold medal and two
silvers.
"I certainly love the sport, but
I suddenly realize it's time to
switch gears," the former All-
American said. "Where I'm going,
I don't think I'll have time to
remain at this competitive level.

"I have a whole new career
ahead of me and I'm anxious to
begin it. I don't envision compet
itive swimming being a part of
my life," he added.
A year from now, Morales will
enter Cornell University's law
school.
The trials were equally unkind
to Stanford senior Jenna Johnson.
Another '84 Olympian, Johnson
failed to qualify for the team this
time around.
