## O'Connor, others comprise a pleasant 'Mob'

"Music From the Film 'Married to the
Mob' "
The movie isn't out, but "Married to the
Mob" is already a hit. Featuring 10 fiery
songs from some of the most exciting and
dynamic artists currently hitting vinyl, the
soundtrack to the latest Jonathan Demme
("Stop Making Sense" and "Something
Wild") film is as hot as his other movies'
musical menageries.
Demme has emerged as the master of
integrating modern music into his films in
a creative, unforced manner. Rather than
simply accompanying the action, the songs
augment it — the scene in "Wild" with
Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith motoring
down the open highway belting out a
spirited version of the classic "Wild Thing"
remains one of the highlights of 80s film,
thanks to the artful blend of lens and lyric.
Though audiences will have to wait until
Friday before they can see if this refreshing
mix of audio and video is employed in
"Mob," fans who listen to the soundtrack
will readily realize that Demme has a solid
sound base to work from.

Each song on the soundtrack is relatively
innovative and unique, offering plenty of
enjoyment independent of the film's visual
enhancement.
The compilation begins with a new song
by perhaps the most innovative new artist
of them all, Sinead O'Connor (whose "The
Lion and the Cobra" debut has been the
biggest surprise success so far this year).
"Jump in the Water" lives up to the high
standards the novice singer/songwriter/
guitarist/producer has set for herself,
capitalizing on the exciting sound she cap
tures in her hit "Mandinka."
Although O'Connor says she hates the

comparison frequently made between her
self and Suzanne Vega, the whispy vocal
lines and reflective words of "Jump" do
little to distance her from the famous
folksinger's style. But this song is entirely
O'Connor in tone and style, one sure to
please even her most ardent and critical
fans.
New Order's "Bizarre Love Triangle" fol
lows. The first single released off of "Broth
erhood" (the quartet's last studio produc
tion and the album that sealed the group's
fate as a dance band), the version here is
fortunately devoid of many tedious dance
production values; pared down to essen-

tiaJs, the song is fresh and enjoyable.
As if this introductory duo of tunes
weren't pleasant enough, enter Chris Isaak.
"Suspicion of Love" is his latest outing
since his daring debut near the end of last
year, and the song demonstrates further
facets of his talent. Moody and melodic,
"Suspicion" draws favorable comparisons
to materia] by Bryan Ferry (the voice be
hind Roxv Music).
Debbie Harry provides the only mar
ginally annoying moments of the collection
with her contribution "Liar, Liar." Receiv
ing reasonable airplay, the song brings out
the piercingly shrill qualities of her voice
that mar an otherwise interesting —
though definitely "poppy" — venture.
Rounding out the impressive first side
is "Time Bums," a new song by the reggae
reforming Ziggy Marley and the Melody
Makers. Spotlighting Marley's vocal and
lyrical prowess, the track is a definite win
ner.
Even if "Married to the Mob" turns out
to be an utter debacle on screen, at least
it has sparked one of the most innovative
and exciting compilations of modern music.
Of all the albums released this summer,
this ranks among the best — experience
and enjoy.
