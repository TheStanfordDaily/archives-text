Van Morrison and the Chieftains
"Irish Heartbeat"
Advantage No. 1 of being a fa
mous rock star: you can release
an album featuring any kind of
music you desire and team up
with anyone you choose when you
decide to record it.
For Van Morrison, one of the
premier recording artists to step
off Irish soil and onto the Amer
ican rock scene, the choice was to
go back to his roots and share his
musical heritage with an audience
unexposed to Ireland's emotional
folk traditions. "Irish Heartbeat,"
his collaboration with the legen
dary Gaelic group the Chieftains,
admirably accomplishes this with
spirit and splendor.
Produced and arranged by Mor
rison and Chieftain-member

Paddy Moloney (credited with
playing uilleann pipes and tim
whistles), the album offers inter
esting interpretations of eight
classic folk tunes along with two
new Morrison songs laden with
Irish influence. As a package, the
record is a definite joy for fans
of this musical genre, though for
the uninitiated the appeal may
seem limited indeed.
The first side of "Heartbeat"
— the title track in particular —
presents the more melodic side of
Irish folk music with a handful
of beautifully-instrumented bal
lads. Of the five, the tune with
the Gaelic title, "Ta Mo
Chleamhnas Deanta (My Match
It Is Made)," is the real stand-out.
With the alternating Gaelic-
English verses, it offers an oppor
tunity to learn a traditional folk
song and understand its meaning
(and, for those with a real flair
for language, gain added fluency

in a foreign tounge for no extra
charge).
But the real pleasures come at
the start and finsh of side two
with "I'll Tell Me Ma" and
"Marie's Wedding," two tunes
popularized by the now-separated
but ever-celebrated collaboration
of Tommy Makem and the Clancy
Brothers (both, in fact, appear on
an early Makem and Clancy al
bum). On "Ma," Morrison and the
Chieftains add an enjoyable acous
tic touch with a host of wind in
struments and whistles, giving the
song an airy and upbeat tone.
"Marie's Wedding" (pronoun
ced, incidentally, MAH-ree), the
brief ditty which concludes the
collection, is the special prize of
"Heartbeat." A skippy song which
has been adapted by native-son
groups as seemingly distant from
folk as the hard-hitting Marillion,
the simple lyrics and nursery
rhyme-like melodv are instantlv

memorable:
Skip we gaily on we go
heel and heel
and toe for toe,
arm and arm
and row and row,
all for Marie's wedding.

"Heartbeat" is not an album
that will please everyone, and
even some of Morrison's following
may not experience nirvana after
it. However, for the fan of Irish
folk music in general, the material
performed here is a definite treat.
