## 'Race' is a sure shot for Tangerine Dream

Tangerine Dream
"Optical Race"
The visible creates a work in
form — the invisible defines its
worth.
Such is the theme behind the
latest album created by Tan
gerine Dream, "Optical Race."
Perhaps better titled "Audi
tory Race," the record proffers
an upbeat assortment of beau
tiful tunes that lifts the lis
tener's spirits as soon as the
phonograph needle hits the
vinyl.
One of the few experimental
music bands to eryoy success
spanning two decades, Tan
gerine Dream has performed
its unique brand of synthesized
instrumentations for 21 years,
and is the pioneer of the New
Age music that Windham Hill
Records has launched into
popularity.
With the release of "Race"
on Private Music, the hottest
rising New Age and jazz label
founded by Peter Baumann

(who, incidentally, was a mem
ber of the band from 1971-77),
the band's position in the genre
has finally been acknowledged.
Departing from the surreal
soundscapes that comprise
much of Tangerine Dream's
canon of compositions, "Race"
is a swifter record with more
reliance on melody than tex
ture. The songs still have the
richness that characterizes the
band's electronic tunes, but
each also has a firmer base for
the listener to grab on to —
rather than being let loose in
a sea of sound, a tow-line has
been graciously attached.
No single song rises out from
among the rest, but that is per
haps the greatest joy of this
album as well as the rest of
the band's music. Providing
consistency with enough varia
tion to hold interest, Tangerine
Dream weaves a soothing web
of sound that pleasantly
ensnares anyone in its path.
For a little mood music to
study or relax to, "Optical
Race" is clearly a move in the
right direction.
