k.d. lang
"Shadowland"
"Shadowland" is an album you will hate to hate.
After listening to the amazingly beautiful voice that
k.d. lang (yes, like e.e. cummings, she has opted
for a lower-case initial moniker) potently wields,
the listener fervently wishes that lang had chosen
some better vehicle to showcase it.
Except for the fan of Musak or country-western,
the record is sadly unfulfilling. Under the tutelage
and production of Owen Bradley (who, according to
the liner notes, is the man responsible for the fame
of Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline and others labelled
"Honky Tonk Angels"), lang has released a richly
instrumented yet disappointing debut.
Not that anything on the album is abominably
bad — in fact, the whole production is quite con
sistent in quality; the problem arises in the choice
of material.
Rather than interspersing the slow songs with
uptempo or intriguing numbers, Bradley elected to
maintain a constantly lagging pace that makes the
listener long for the next song. After the second
song featuring twangy guitars backed by a full
string section, tedium begins to beset the drowsy
audience.
Without a doubt, lang is one of the most talented
vocalists to emerge this year. Hopefully, when she
decides to break out of the Bradley mold, her future
efforts will share her gift with a broader group of
people and in a more enjoyable manner.
