After spending over a year in West Berlin
being spoiled by real, honest-to-God beer,
I despaired — yes, despaired — of finding
anything here in the States that could
satisfy taste buds acculturated to a serious
brew. But now, now I can end my pining
for the rich, golden liquid of Deutschland,
thanks to the Gordon Biersch Brewery and
Restaurant in Palo Alto.
Accompanied by two faithful com
panions, I bellied up to the bar one Sat
urday night and began what was to be a
long run through GB's varied menu. We
ordered beers, of course, to begin with.
Dan Gordon, who spent five years learn
ing how to mash malt and hop wort in the
Brewing Engineering program at the Tech
nical University of Munich, turns out three
kinds of beer (all reasonably priced at
$2.00/.5 1).
The dunkles, recommended for serious
beer drinkers, is a moderately bitter dark
with a flavor and body so full that you
can make a meal of it in itself. The marzen
is a must taste for anyone who enjoys a
lighter (nothing to do with calories!),
smoother brew without such a bitter bite.
The third, export, was the only disap
pointment; Mr. Gordon said he'd had to
pull it out a little early, and we all agreed
that it tasted unpalatably rough, almost
acrid.
Since we were there to do a full review,
we eventually pried ourselves from the bar,
sat down at a table in the airy indoor/out
door area up front and began the meal
itself.
From a very comprehensive appetizer se
lection we sampled the tender Thai chicken
skewers ($4.50), which were covered with
a mildly spicy, smooth and creamy peanut
sauce — the definite favorite. We also had
some mussels steamed in wheat beer
($6.26), which were ei\joyably fresh and

abundant, though not noticeably affected
by the beer.
The only serious culinary disappointment
of the evening was the grilled prawns with
spicy coral sauce ($5.25); all excited by the
possiblities in the name, we were greeted

with a few small, almost cold prawns in a
decidedly bland sauce.
Valiantly shaking off this momentary set
back, we moved on to the salads, which
quickly restored our nascent opinion that
Gordon Biersch is a great place to eat as
well as drink.
The house salad ($3.50) was the good,
basic assortment of vegetables it should be,
topped with a light and tangy vinaigrette
dressing. The Chinese chicken salad ($6.50),
however, was the best in this department:
a generous portion of fresh carrot strips.

sweet bell peppers, crunchy peanuts and
chunks of fresh lettuce hid two slabs of
lightly grilled chicken breast — exactly
what Chinese chicken salad was meant to be.
Then, checking to make sure we still had
room, we moved on to the entrees. Gordon

Biersch has an extremly eclectic menu, of
fering everything from angel hair pasta to
grilled garlic sausages to filet mignon.
Going on the suspicion that Chef Jaime
Carpenter was at his best when preparing
chicken, we tasted the juicy chicken breast
stuffed with pancetta and lively Fontina
cheese, served with some lightly cooked,
very fresh spinach and a rich, tangy pep
percorn bernaise ($10.95).
Unsatiated, we moved on to a sweet pep
per pasta ($8.95), served with a smooth,
potent alfredo sauce and crowned with

some of the most delectable tomatoes I've
ever had; sundried, with one bite you could
feel succulent sunlight drenching your
mouth.
The true find of the evening was the
third dish, the jaegerschnitzel ($13.95).
Surrounded with (again, very fresh) red
cabbage and nestled amid dumplings of
just the right consistency (sticky enough
to hold together, light enough not to sit
like lead in your gut), this piece of oh-so
tender veal in a thinly breaded crust was
perfection itself. A creamy white wine sauce
perfectly complemented the meat, and pro
vided an added punch when ladled over
the dumplings.
Since I'm no connoisseur of wines, I will
simply say that the glasses of dry house
white ('B7 Chestnut Hill), sweet Chardon
nay ('B6 Edna Valley), and mellow Zinfan
del ('B4 Obester) were rather good. The
amateur consensus was that the Zinfandel
made the best supplement to the meal; do
what you will with that assessment.
To end the night, one of us went with
manager Mack Tilling's recommendation
of the three-berry dessert special, a smart
move. The blueberries, blackberries and
raspberries were right off the bush, a sweet
and juicy treat savored with some very
vanilla vanilla ice cream.
The chocolate decadence was good, but
not terribly decadent, and the airy tiramisu,
embellished with mint and oversized
ladyfingers, was also quite tasty.
To bring you all this, Gordon Biersch
has a first-rate staff serving their guests.
Our hostess was very attentive while we
waited, checking to see if there was any
thing we need ("Yes, more beer!"), and our
waiter was quite helpful, as well as accu
rate, with his suggestions.
And, if you're wondering if they've
treated the old Bijou theater with respect,
go take a look and be satisfied. It's been
lavishly redone with a huge wooden bar
(serving only wine and the house beers),
a subtle network of modern black lights
lacing the ceiling and a frontal area that
can be opened up to the street.
