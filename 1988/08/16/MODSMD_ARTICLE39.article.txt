# Saturn's not the only one anymore
## Results from Voyager 2 probe reveal rings on outer planets 
### Minha Husaini 
While astronomers once
thought Saturn was the only
ringed planet, Stanford scien
tists have now proven them
wrong, using experiments from
the Voyager 2 spacecraft.
By studying information from
the Voyager 2 space probe cur
rently heading toward Neptune,
Stanford astronomers now have
evidence that ring systems exist
around Jupiter and Uranus.
They have also found material
in orbit around Neptune, ac
cording to officials at the Center
for Radar Astronomy here.
According to Electrical Engi
neering Prof. Von Eshleman,
who is working with the radio
team using experiments from
Voyager 2, "all of the giant
planets have ring systems but
all are characteristically differ
ent from each other."
The Stanford group found
that Saturn's ring system is
very wide while Uranus' is very
narrow. Jupiter has only one

"very tenuous, dusty ring," Esh
leman said.
Doctoral student Donna
Gresh said the most interesting
difference between the ring sys
tems is that Saturn's wide rings
extend over a distance of 70,000
kilometers while Uranus' very
narrow, tiny rings are separated
over a smaller space.
Uranus has "nine rings of
very narrow but dense material,
but much less material than
Saturn's (ring)," Eshleman said.

According to Eshleman, "The
group at Stanford is involved in
radio experimentation with the
(Voyager) spacecraft. We will
study the atmosphere and look
for the signature of rings."
"Understanding how the dy
namics of ring systems work is
very important," he added. "We
believe it's related to what first
made up the solar system."
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Leonard Tyler, leader of the
radio team studying results
from Voyager 2, agreed, noting
that the study of planetary rings
is related to the question of how
planets are formed.
Voyager 2 was launched in
1977 and reached Uranus in
January 1986. It will encounter
Neptune in August 1989, pro
viding an opportunity to deter
mine if the eighth planet of the
solar system also has rings.
"Rings of Neptune have not
yet been studied by the
spacecraft however," Eshleman
said.
