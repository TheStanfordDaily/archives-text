# University report faults own safety management

### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
A report, released Friday, detailing an
internal investigation of the University's
management of health and safety "found
no instances of cover-up, no instances of
falsification, one case that raised ethical
considerations . . . and many instances of
mismanagement and waste."
The report makes 14 recommendations,
which have not yet been made public. The
recommendations "deal with organizational
and institutional arrangements related to
the health and safety function," and are
under consideration by University officials
and the Special Advisory Panel on the
Health and Safety Review.
The report, prepared by Assoc. Managing
Auditor David Fetterman, embodies phase
two of an investigation initiated by a letter
from former Environmental Safety Facility
Operations Manager Jon Moldestad.
In his letter of resignation to President
Kennedy last December, Moldestad alleged
that the University wasted millions of dol
lars shoddily managing health and safety,
unnecessarily endangering Stanford's fac
ulty, staff and students.
The one case of unethical conduct found
by Fetterman involved the use of an in
cinerator at Stanford Hospital. In 1983,

the incinerator was found to have been
discharging possibly infectious smoke. The
report asserts "the University should have
stopped using these incinerators altogether
or, at very least, given written notice of
the possible hazards to all employees ...
Fetterman lumped most of the problems
he found under the catagory of "waste and
mismanagement." In dealing with Moldes
tad's allegations of cover-up, Fetterman
defined a cover-up as "a concerted effort
to conceal illegal and unethical acts from
being made public."
For instance, Mddestad helped to estab
lish a computer database, known as
CARMA, that tracked problems identified
by officers in the Health and Safety De
partment. The information was then passed
on to the pertinent department for correc
tion.
Moldestad considered the lack of re
sponse — of nearly 5,300 cases logged in,
only 173 were recorded as resolved — to
be a cover-up. But, Fetterman identified
the lack of response as mismanagement.
According to the report, reasons for the
lack of response included a lack of
departmental resources to deal with the
problems, doubt as to who was responsible
for health and safety within individual de-
