# University report faults own safety management
## 
### Burke Smith Editorial staff 
A report, released Friday, detailing an
internal investigation of the University's
management of health and safety "found
no instances of cover-up, no instances of
falsification, one case that raised ethical
considerations . . . and many instances of
mismanagement and waste."
The report makes 14 recommendations,
which have not yet been made public. The
recommendations "deal with organizational
and institutional arrangements related to
the health and safety function," and are
under consideration by University officials
and the Special Advisory Panel on the
Health and Safety Review.
The report, prepared by Assoc. Managing
Auditor David Fetterman, embodies phase
two of an investigation initiated by a letter
from former Environmental Safety Facility
Operations Manager Jon Moldestad.
In his letter of resignation to President
Kennedy last December, Moldestad alleged
that the University wasted millions of dol
lars shoddily managing health and safety,
unnecessarily endangering Stanford's fac
ulty, staff and students.
The one case of unethical conduct found
by Fetterman involved the use of an in
cinerator at Stanford Hospital. In 1983,

the incinerator was found to have been
discharging possibly infectious smoke. The
report asserts "the University should have
stopped using these incinerators altogether
or, at very least, given written notice of
the possible hazards to all employees ...
Fetterman lumped most of the problems
he found under the catagory of "waste and
mismanagement." In dealing with Moldes
tad's allegations of cover-up, Fetterman
defined a cover-up as "a concerted effort
to conceal illegal and unethical acts from
being made public."
For instance, Mddestad helped to estab
lish a computer database, known as
CARMA, that tracked problems identified
by officers in the Health and Safety De
partment. The information was then passed
on to the pertinent department for correc
tion.
Moldestad considered the lack of re
sponse — of nearly 5,300 cases logged in,
only 173 were recorded as resolved — to
be a cover-up. But, Fetterman identified
the lack of response as mismanagement.
According to the report, reasons for the
lack of response included a lack of
departmental resources to deal with the
problems, doubt as to who was responsible
for health and safety within individual de-
partments and an "at times ad
versarial faculty environ
ment. ..."
Fetterman said a major factor
that increased Moldestad's
feelings of frustration and that
contributes to the overall misman
agement of health and safety is a
lack of feedback, exemplified by
the low response to CARMA.
In fact, Fetterman said "some
times I found out management
was doing something, but didn't
get back to staff."
Another major problem was a
lack of foresight in project plan
ning and construction.
According to the report, Facil
ities Project Management and
Health and Safety often have com
peting interests on a project. FPM
negotiates with the Provost's of
fice to complete a project at a
specified cost and in a specified
amount of time. Once FPM
declares a project "complete," any
costs in dealing with health and
safety problems are footed by the
client department, for whom the
project is being completed.
Thus, concerns raised by
Health and Safety that slow con
struction and add cost run
counter to FPM's goals. "Cer
tainly there are competing

priorities," said Curt Williams, di
rector of facilities project manage
ment. But, Fetterman said he
didn't think "apparent antagonis
tic attitudes all come from FPM."
He placed the responsibility at
a higher level. There is "an envi
ronment in which we don't have
a budget to do everything that
should be done," Fetterman said.
Alain Decleve, director of the
Health and Safety Department,
agreed. He said "the projects are
underbudgeted up front." Accord
ing to Decleve, it is important that
Health and Safety be involved
early in the planning of buildings,
so that necessary elements can be
designed in, rather than added on
later at a greater cost.
In an interview yesterday, Fet
terman said he is concerned with
"follow through." Two years ago,
Fetterman wrote an internal audit
that addressed many of the pres
ent problems but whose recom
mendations were not enacted.
He said this report differed in
its public nature and the fact that
it repeats previous findings,
giving it a higher priority. People
within the University seem "ready
and responsive" to deal with the
organizational problems raised in
his report, Fetterman said.
President Kennedy is in the
process of reviewing the report,
but wrote in a statement released
with the report "I have neverthe

less authorized its release so that
it can be reviewed and discussed
by members of the Stanford com
munity. . .
Assoc. Vice President for Public
Affairs Larry Horton said the
report will be considered at a
meeting August 29 by the Special
Advisory Panel on the Health and
Safety Review. The panel was set
up by Kennedy to advise him on
health and safety.
The first phase of the health
and safety investigation, begun
last winter, involved an investiga
tion by SRI International, a Menlo
Park research company. The SRI
report, released in March, also
faulted the University's manage
ment of health and safety.

A report, released Friday, detailing an
internal investigation of the University's
management of health and safety "found
no instances of cover-up, no instances of
falsification, one case that raised ethical
considerations . . . and many instances of
mismanagement and waste."
The report makes 14 recommendations,
which have not yet been made public. The
recommendations "deal with organizational
and institutional arrangements related to
the health and safety function," and are
under consideration by University officials
and the Special Advisory Panel on the
Health and Safety Review.
The report, prepared by Assoc. Managing
Auditor David Fetterman, embodies phase
two of an investigation initiated by a letter
from former Environmental Safety Facility
Operations Manager Jon Moldestad.
In his letter of resignation to President
Kennedy last December, Moldestad alleged
that the University wasted millions of dol
lars shoddily managing health and safety,
unnecessarily endangering Stanford's fac
ulty, staff and students.
The one case of unethical conduct found
by Fetterman involved the use of an in
cinerator at Stanford Hospital. In 1983,

the incinerator was found to have been
discharging possibly infectious smoke. The
report asserts "the University should have
stopped using these incinerators altogether
or, at very least, given written notice of
the possible hazards to all employees ...
Fetterman lumped most of the problems
he found under the catagory of "waste and
mismanagement." In dealing with Moldes
tad's allegations of cover-up, Fetterman
defined a cover-up as "a concerted effort
to conceal illegal and unethical acts from
being made public."
For instance, Mddestad helped to estab
lish a computer database, known as
CARMA, that tracked problems identified
by officers in the Health and Safety De
partment. The information was then passed
on to the pertinent department for correc
tion.
Moldestad considered the lack of re
sponse — of nearly 5,300 cases logged in,
only 173 were recorded as resolved — to
be a cover-up. But, Fetterman identified
the lack of response as mismanagement.
According to the report, reasons for the
lack of response included a lack of
departmental resources to deal with the
problems, doubt as to who was responsible
for health and safety within individual de-
partments and an "at times ad
versarial faculty environ
ment. ..."
Fetterman said a major factor
that increased Moldestad's
feelings of frustration and that
contributes to the overall misman
agement of health and safety is a
lack of feedback, exemplified by
the low response to CARMA.
In fact, Fetterman said "some
times I found out management
was doing something, but didn't
get back to staff."
Another major problem was a
lack of foresight in project plan
ning and construction.
According to the report, Facil
ities Project Management and
Health and Safety often have com
peting interests on a project. FPM
negotiates with the Provost's of
fice to complete a project at a
specified cost and in a specified
amount of time. Once FPM
declares a project "complete," any
costs in dealing with health and
safety problems are footed by the
client department, for whom the
project is being completed.
Thus, concerns raised by
Health and Safety that slow con
struction and add cost run
counter to FPM's goals. "Cer
tainly there are competing

priorities," said Curt Williams, di
rector of facilities project manage
ment. But, Fetterman said he
didn't think "apparent antagonis
tic attitudes all come from FPM."
He placed the responsibility at
a higher level. There is "an envi
ronment in which we don't have
a budget to do everything that
should be done," Fetterman said.
Alain Decleve, director of the
Health and Safety Department,
agreed. He said "the projects are
underbudgeted up front." Accord
ing to Decleve, it is important that
Health and Safety be involved
early in the planning of buildings,
so that necessary elements can be
designed in, rather than added on
later at a greater cost.
In an interview yesterday, Fet
terman said he is concerned with
"follow through." Two years ago,
Fetterman wrote an internal audit
that addressed many of the pres
ent problems but whose recom
mendations were not enacted.
He said this report differed in
its public nature and the fact that
it repeats previous findings,
giving it a higher priority. People
within the University seem "ready
and responsive" to deal with the
organizational problems raised in
his report, Fetterman said.
President Kennedy is in the
process of reviewing the report,
but wrote in a statement released
with the report "I have neverthe

less authorized its release so that
it can be reviewed and discussed
by members of the Stanford com
munity. . .
Assoc. Vice President for Public
Affairs Larry Horton said the
report will be considered at a
meeting August 29 by the Special
Advisory Panel on the Health and
Safety Review. The panel was set
up by Kennedy to advise him on
health and safety.
The first phase of the health
and safety investigation, begun
last winter, involved an investiga
tion by SRI International, a Menlo
Park research company. The SRI
report, released in March, also
faulted the University's manage
ment of health and safety.
