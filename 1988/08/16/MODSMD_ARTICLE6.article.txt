# Stanford considers options for pursuing drug crusade
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Basking in the glow of their recent suc
cess in barring all NCAA drug testing of
athletes here, Stanford may now consider
whether to take this crusade beyond its
own borders.
Although Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geiger has said Stanford has the
obligation to make others realize that man
datory drug testing is wrong, it remains
unclear how the University would go about
encouraging further change.
Because attorneys for the NCAA said
yesterday that they would probably appeal
the decision, Stanford still has its own
fight to finish. For the moment, however,
others may choose to build on the
groundwork laid by Stanford last week.
According to University attorney Debra

Zumwalt, Stanford's case may in fact have
a strengthening effect on similar cases cur
rently filed against the NCAA by students
at Northeastern University in Massachu
setts and at the University of Colorado.
Another suit filed by students at the
University of Washington, which was over
turned at the federal level in favor of the
NCAA, may also be bolstered by Stanford's
win now that students there have decided
to appeal the decision.
Attorney for the NCAA John Kitchin
noted that similar suits filed against the
NCAA might be affected by the broad lan
guage used in the judge's ruling against
drug testing at Stanford. But Kitchin cau
tioned that Stanford's suit "is applicable
to California and Stanford students" in
particular.
