# Stanford considers options for pursuing drug crusade
## 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Basking in the glow of their recent suc
cess in barring all NCAA drug testing of
athletes here, Stanford may now consider
whether to take this crusade beyond its
own borders.
Although Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geiger has said Stanford has the
obligation to make others realize that man
datory drug testing is wrong, it remains
unclear how the University would go about
encouraging further change.
Because attorneys for the NCAA said
yesterday that they would probably appeal
the decision, Stanford still has its own
fight to finish. For the moment, however,
others may choose to build on the
groundwork laid by Stanford last week.
According to University attorney Debra

Zumwalt, Stanford's case may in fact have
a strengthening effect on similar cases cur
rently filed against the NCAA by students
at Northeastern University in Massachu
setts and at the University of Colorado.
Another suit filed by students at the
University of Washington, which was over
turned at the federal level in favor of the
NCAA, may also be bolstered by Stanford's
win now that students there have decided
to appeal the decision.
Attorney for the NCAA John Kitchin
noted that similar suits filed against the
NCAA might be affected by the broad lan
guage used in the judge's ruling against
drug testing at Stanford. But Kitchin cau
tioned that Stanford's suit "is applicable
to California and Stanford students" in
particular.
While the expressed right to
privacy in California's constitu
tion will help Stanford if the
NCAA appeals the suit, it signif
icantly reduces the applicability
of the suit to federal cases and
cases outside of California, ac
cording to Zumwalt.
A more direct tack Stanford
might take to change the NCAA's
drug-testing program would be to
work within that organization.
Because the NCAA's national
membership passed the current
drug-testing program, Stanford,
as a member, is eligible to rally
support among other members
and propose new legislation at an
NCAA annual meeting.
While expressing cautious inter
est in such a move, Geiger said
it is too early to decide whether
Stanford wants to play that lead
ership role within the NCAA. "We
need to see what the reaction is,"
he said.
"We have to consider the next
step," Geiger said. "What I think
we should do is to consider
whether or not we should enter
into dialogue with other institu
tions about the legislation."
Assistant Executive Director of
the NCAA Dave Cawood said that
of the NCAA's 900 plus voting

members, only six institutions
need to band together in order to
propose new legislation to the
membership. "If Stanford could
get five other universities across
the country (to support a new
program) they could change" the
current one, he said.
However, remembering when
the NCAA's current drug-testing
program was put to vote in '86,
Cawood said support for the exist
ing program was close to unani
mous. "I don't remember seeing
any 'no* panels."
While he admitted that there
are "different attitudes toward
(the NCAA drug-testing program)
at the different institutions" of
the Pacific 10 Conference, Pac-10
Asst. Commissioner Jim Muldoon
said he thinks the members of
the Pac-10 "are reconsidering it
after this suit" between Stanford
and the NCAA.
"We do not have drug testing
at the various Pac-10 competi
tions .. . because our 10 members
have not wanted it," Muldoon
said, adding that some Pac-10
members "have been very sympa
thetic to Stanford's viewpoints."
However, he added that other
Pac-10 members support the
NCAA's program or simply don't
want to add a layer of their own
tests on top of the NCAA's.
