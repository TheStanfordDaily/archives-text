He has voiced it; now he is writ
ing it.
In an introduction to Hoover's
1987 annual report, Hoover In
stitution Director W. Glenn
Campbell charged that the Uni
versity has made "clumsy and
petty attempts" in trying to fire
him.
The report was made public
Aug. 13 â€” three weeks after
Campbell officially announced
that he would voluntarily step
down as director when he turns
65.
Campbell wrote that he has fal
len victim to "the spreading of
undocumented and outrageous
charges" about his personal char
acter as a conservative.
While Campbell told reporters
at a July 21 press conference that
he was "happy" and "pleased"
about the retirement agreement
he reached with the Stanford
Board of Trustees, his embittered
introduction marks a return to
his earlier hostile statements

about the University. In June,

Campbell had
threatened to sue
Stanford for try
ing to retire him.
At the July
press conference,
Board of Trustees
President James
Gaither called for
greater unity be
tween the Univer-

sity and Hoover. At the same con
ference, Campbell announced his
plans to stay on at Hoover as a
"counselor" for life once his direc
torship ends.
In his introduction, Campbell
points out that tension between
Stanford and Hoover is nothing
new. The introduction outlines
the troubled history of Hoover
starting with Herbert Hoover
himself.
"During the 19505, Mr. Hoover
had come to realize that one of
the mistakes of his life was to
establish the Hoover Institution
as legally a part of Stanford Uni
