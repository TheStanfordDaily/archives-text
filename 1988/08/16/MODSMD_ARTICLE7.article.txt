# Campbell's frustration caps off annual report

He has voiced it; now he is writ
ing it.
In an introduction to Hoover's
1987 annual report, Hoover In
stitution Director W. Glenn
Campbell charged that the Uni
versity has made "clumsy and
petty attempts" in trying to fire
him.
The report was made public
Aug. 13 â€” three weeks after
Campbell officially announced
that he would voluntarily step
down as director when he turns
65.
Campbell wrote that he has fal
len victim to "the spreading of
undocumented and outrageous
charges" about his personal char
acter as a conservative.
While Campbell told reporters
at a July 21 press conference that
he was "happy" and "pleased"
about the retirement agreement
he reached with the Stanford
Board of Trustees, his embittered
introduction marks a return to
his earlier hostile statements

about the University. In June,

Campbell had
threatened to sue
Stanford for try
ing to retire him.
At the July
press conference,
Board of Trustees
President James
Gaither called for
greater unity be
tween the Univer-

sity and Hoover. At the same con
ference, Campbell announced his
plans to stay on at Hoover as a
"counselor" for life once his direc
torship ends.
In his introduction, Campbell
points out that tension between
Stanford and Hoover is nothing
new. The introduction outlines
the troubled history of Hoover
starting with Herbert Hoover
himself.
"During the 19505, Mr. Hoover
had come to realize that one of
the mistakes of his life was to
establish the Hoover Institution
as legally a part of Stanford Uni


Campbell
versity," Campbell wrote.
While Campbell's introduction
could potentially stir up yet more
tension between Hoover and Stan
ford, Hoover Research Fellow
George Marotta said he supports
Campbell's statements because
they are factual.
"I think that within an aca
demic institution its good to have
a relationship based on facts,"
Marotta said. "I don't see any
thing in here (the report) that's
not factual."
But English Prof. Ronald Reb

holz, a longstanding Hoover critic,
predicted that, despite calls for
unity, problems between Hoover
and Stanford will continue until
the University either severs ties
with Hoover or enforces stronger
academic governance.
"It will be just as impossible
for this marriage to continue like
it has in the past," he said.
