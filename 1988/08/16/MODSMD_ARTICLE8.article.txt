Applications for 1989 under
graduate admission to Stanford
came out last week and appli
cants will be asked to "jot a
note" to their future college
roommates about "what to ex
pect from them in the coming
year" in addition to a final
page-long essay, according to
Dean of Admissions Jean Fet
ter.
The Admissions Office said
they ran off 60,000 copies of
the applications yesterday and
that more than 6,000 people
had already requested them.
Applications, which arrived last
Wednesday, are sent out as part
of a booklet called Stanford
Today.
As part of the 17-page appli

cation, students will be asked
to write an essay on one of the
following topics:
• If you were to write a book,
on what theme or subject mat
ter would it be based, and why?
• Tell us about one of the
best conversations you've ever
had.
Fetter said 8,000 to 9,000 of
the applications will be sent to
guidance counselors. The other
50,000-plus copies should be
distributed to applicants by the
end of this year, she said.
Applications must be
postmarked by Dec. 15 and be
accompanied by a $50 fee.
Last year, Stanford received
15,826 applications for admis
sion. From those applications,
2,541 students were ultimately
admitted.
