# Stanford seeks to avoid lawsuit
## University may not be a defendant in case of Sierra Camp drowning 
### Ann Marsh Editorial staff 
Stanford will try to have itself
dismissed as a defendant in a law
suit charging the University with
negligence in the drowning death
of a student this spring, according
to the University attorney han
dling the case.
University attorney Debra
Zumwalt said yesterday that
"There is a good possibility that
the University would be let off
from the suit, and if not, the Uni
versity would try to get itself dis
missed."
Stanford is one of three defen
dants named in a suit filed by the
parents of Robert Yuan, a Stan
ford senior who drowned in a
canoeing accident in May at the
Stanford Sierra Camp, where he
took part in a retreat for gradu
ating seniors.
Near the end of July, the Yuans

sued the Alumni Association,
Stanford and the camp for
negligence in preventing their
son's death and asked for an un
specified sum of money. The Uni
versity and the Alumni Associa
tion, which owns the camp, were
served with the suit just over two
weeks ago.
Zumwalt, who said she had al
ready spoken with the attorney
for the plaintiff about the matter,
said because "Stanford is not the
owner or the operator of the camp
. . . I think it is highly unlikely
that the University could be held
liable." Stanford and the Alumni
Association are "entirely separate
entities," according to Zumwalt.
She added that she thinks there
is the possibility that the Univer
sity could "try to work something
out with the plaintiffs attorney"
to have Stanford dismissed from
the suit.
However, Jack Slobodin, the

Yuans' attorney from San Fran
cisco, said Stanford would not be
released.
"[The University] took part in
organizing this event," according
to Slobodin, who said Stanford
played a role in gathering the
names of students who spent the
weekend in the Sierras.

'Stanford is not the
owner of the camp.'

"We've got to take all the cir
cumstances into consideration,"
he said. "If you had a child that
was going to take a trip with his
school and something like this
happened, wouldn't you sue the
school?"
Slobodin said the prosecution
would start hearing testimony for
its own investigation in a "month
or two."
