# Politicos question Quayle's past
## Accuse vice presidential candidate of skipping out on Vietnam 
### 
NEW ORLEANS - Vice Pres
ident George Bush's campaign
was thrown into turmoil yester
day by disclosures that his run
ning mate, Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle, apparently used the in
fluence of his powerful family to
gain entry into the National
Guard during the Vietnam war
at a time he could have been
drafted.
The controversy, which ap
peared to catch the Bush camp
by surprise, put the campaign on
the defensive at a moment when
it had hoped to be launching its
fall offensive against the Demo
crats and it threatened to become
— at the least — a costly distrac
tion for the Republican ticket.
Bush, in the prepared text of
his speech accepting the GOP
presidential nomination last
night, declared "I'm proud to have
Dan Quayle at my side." Earlier,
introducing his prospective run
ning mate at a $1,000-a-person
fund-raising luncheon, Bush said
"I don't think I could have selec
ted anybody who will do more to
help the ticket."
Among Bush's senior adviaers,
however, the disclosure about
Quayle stirred something close to
consternation. They met late into
the night following Bush's nomi
nation here Wednesday, reviewing
videotapes of Quayle's public
statements on the issue, "sorting
out" the facts, as one senior aide
put it, and plotting tactics for han
dling the problem.
"It's a matter of damage con

trol," a senior Bush staffer said.
"We're trying to get through
this week," he said. "I think that
outside of New Orleans, we can
get away with it." But he conceded
that, if it is determined that
Quayle had not been candid, or if
other negative information came
to light, "I think it could develop
into a serious problem."

Republican political consultant
Eddie Mahe described the Quayle
imbroglio as "a lose-lose situa
tion" because it hurts the ticket
while the issue remains alive and
is hard to escape from without
inflicting even more damage.
Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois, the
House minority leader and per
manent chairman of the Republi

can National Convention, said the
controversy could seriously
damage the Republican ticket if
the questions about Quayle's mil
itary service are not quickly re
solved.
"That*B the axiom of politics,"
Michel said. "Don't let some fes
tering thing balloon into some
thing that isn't warranted."
So great was the concern that,
before Quayle's nomination last
night, some Bush campaign offi
cials wondered whether he could
remain on the ticket. "I can't say
it's not in the backs of peoples'
minds," said a senior Bush cam
paign official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. "It is in
the back of mine."
The possibility of Quayle
leaving the ticket was dismissed
by Sheila Tate, the vice presi
dent's spokeswoman, who said
such a course was "never" dis
cussed at the strategy meetings
Wednesday night and yesterday.
The day of Bush's greatest po
litical triumph began with an ex
traordinary post-midnight confer
ence of senior advisers, led by
campaign chairman James A.
Baker 111. And the closed huddles
continued even as the time ap
proached for Bush to claim his
party's presidential nomination
last night.
Publicly, Baker and Tate and
others sought to minimize the
controversy by dismissing the al
legation as unsubstantiated
rumors.
