ISLAMABAD, Pakistan â€” The
remains of President Mohammed
Zia ul-Haq and U.S. Ambassador
Arnold Raphel were brought to
the Pakistani capital yesterday as
military investigators continued
efforts to determine whether the
midair explosion that killed them
and 28 others aboard a Pakistani
Air Force CI3O Wednesday was
caused by an act of sabotage.
Senior Minister Aslam Khattak
said in a speech reported by the
official Associated Press of Pakis
tan news agency yesterday that
the initial evidence indicated that
the explosion was the work of
saboteurs. "The tragic incident
seems to be a sabotage act as the
black box of the airplane did not
record any message about its sud
den disappearance," Khattak told
the Pakistani Senate in Is
lamabad.
Despite fears of civil and polit
ical upheaval, or possible military

moves to seize control in the
power vacuum created by Zia's
death, the country remained al
most unnaturally calm. Virtually
all stores and other commercial
enterprises in the principal cities
were closed in a show of mourning
expected to continue at least until
Sunday, and there were no
reports of significant disturbances
or unusual military activity.
Newspapers of all political per
suasions filled their front pages
with black-bordered banner head
lines and relatively dispassionate
accounts of the disaster and the
formation of a new government.
In a rare move seen as an attempt
to promote an atmosphere of na
tional unity, the state-run televi
sion reported statements by a va
riety of opposition political par
ties.
Zia's disappearance from the
political stage comes at a time of
significant political activity here

as his opponents have sought to
unite in preparation for new chal
lenges to his iron-fisted rule.
Whether that unity will continue,
in the absence of its principal
focus, looms as a mjyor question
as the country approaches na
tional elections that had been set
by Zia for Nov. 16.
Opposition leader Benazir
Bhutto praised acting President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan for behaving
with restraint in the wake of Zia's
death. "The constitution has been

followed," she told a news confer
ence in Karachi. "The government
could have imposed martial law,
but this wasn't done."
Bhutto said "no one wants to
give any provocation" in the
months leading up to the election,
which she said she felt the oppo
sition would win. But her
moderate tone contrasted sharply
with the tough resolution passed
by her Pakistan People's Party
earlier in the day.
The party said Zia would be

remembered "as the man who ...
after 11 years of repressive rule
left behind nothing but debts and
mortgages, hunger and unemploy
ment, exploitation and discrimi
nation, drugs and corruption."
But sources here said that the
military, for the moment at least,
appeared as stunned as the rest
of the country by Zia's abrupt
demise and the loss of 11 of the
nation's most senior military of
ficers.
