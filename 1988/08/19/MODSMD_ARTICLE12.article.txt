Botha bargains with Mandela
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President
Pieter Botha, sounding more conciliatory than
ever on the prospects for Nelson Mandela's free
dom, again yesterday urged the jailed black leader
to renounce violence and "make it possible for
me to act in a humane way so we can have peace
in South Africa."
Botha's remarks came amid increasing signs
of government concern about the health of the
70-year-old prisoner, who has become an inter
national symbol of the anti-apartheid struggle
during his 26 years in prison.
Mandela was taken from his cell to a Cape
Town hospital last week, where he is being treated
for tuberculosis. Doctors say that his chances for
a full recovery are good.
In a rare personal comment on the country's
most famous prisoner, Justice Minister Kobie
Coetsee said Thursday that he visited Mandela
in the Tygerberg Hospital and found him to be
"almost his old self ... already enjoying jokes. He
appears to have taken the first steps toward
recovery."
Botha brought up Mandela's freedom during
a provincial meeting of the ruling white National
Party in the port city of Durban. The 72-year-old
president recalled Mandela's trial and 1964 life

sentence on charges of sabotage and conspiracy
to overthrow the government.
"Now comes the question," Botha said, "am I
prepared to release him?
"Personally, I don't think that at his age and
condition it would be wise for him to choose to
go back to prison," the president said. "I hope
he will make it possible for me to act in a humane
way so we can have peace in South Africa instead
of violence."
Court: Living together is
not the same as marriage
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Supreme
Court, refusing to extend people of the opposite
sex sharing the same living quarters a right the
law grants to married couples, yesterday barred
a single man from suing for the negligence-related
accidental death of his live-in girlfriend.
The justices, in a 6-1 decision, rejected a suit
for emotional distress and loss of companionship
brought by Richard Elden, who survived a car
crash that took the life of his companion, Linda
Eberling, in Pasadena, Calif., in 1982.
