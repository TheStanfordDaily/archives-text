## Editor's Farewell 
### 
Eighteen issues ago
in mid-June, this
same editorial space
braced The Daily's reader
ship to switch to a lower
gear during the summer and
expect a scaling down of
things in size and impor
tance on these pages.
Surprisingly, the summer
of '88 has come the closest
to "full size" of any summer
Daily in recent memory.
Two Stanford athletes'
recent win in their long
standing battle with the
NCAA over drug testing, the
University's decision to ask
Campbell to relinquish his
helmsmanship at Hoover
and Meese's decision to
come to the same institution
as a visiting scholar — to
name a few — were all
stories of a magnitude not
often seen during Stanford
summers.
Keeping tensions running
as high as the interest in
the news copy, The Daily's
advertising team sold a
record-breaking number of
ads. This growth drove the
length of the paper four, and
sometimes eight, pages over
the standard 12-page size of
summer Dailys. Needless to
say, the small 12-person ed
itorial staff here was kept
jumping.
"I didn't realize how
burnt out you could get pub
lishing only two times a
week," said one editor, ech
oing a familiar refrain this
volume.

Yet for most editors here,
the summer stress appears
to have been worth it. The
same editor said he was
pleased to discover "that
you can turn absolute
mayhem into a profession.
I learned I could transplant
myself into something I'd
never done before and do
OK."
After covering the "Camp
bell" beat all summer, an
other editor said she may
have felt best about her
work after going up against
a herd of professional jour
nalists from the Mercury
News to the Associated
Press at a press conference
held by Campbell. "I
realized I had as much a
right to be there as anyone
else and that I understood
the issues as well, if not bet
ter," she said.
Said another: "I under
stand why, whenever I dealt
with editors in the past,
they were so distracted. It
really used to annoy me."
"The worst thing is the
stress," he added. "That's
why I would never do an
editorial position in any
thing else." While some
would agree the experience
of actually editing has ex
hausted their interest in the
job, a precious few think
they'll stick with it.
"I really like it because
it's hard," said one.
So passes another sum
mer.
