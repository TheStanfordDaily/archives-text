## Last thoughts of Stanford 
### 
IT WAS two months ago that
I wrote one of the two or three
most careless pieces of copy I
have ever submitted to an editor
for publication.
This piece appeared in the Class
of 1988's Commencement Edition,
and the quality that separated it
from the other writing in that
edition was its cynicism about the
state of affairs at this University.
Most writers have a sixth sense
that curdles at anything they've
written of more than two weeks'
age, and I am no exception. But
it is not merely an agitation over
poor word choice in the third par
agraph, or over a misplaced
comma in the fourth, that causes
me to rue the day I sat down to
tap out my Commencement dog
gerel.
Instead, it is an admittedly
belated appreciation of everything
this school offered me in my four
years under its wing. It is with a
Scrooge-like sigh of consternation
at my own folly that I write this
farewell column, in order perhaps
to amend some of the wrongs com
mitted by the first.
There is a barbed irony in all
this that I cannot escape. The
smirking knave staring out at the
reader of the Commencement
column was a portion of myself

in its death throes, trying to get
in one last kick.
That part of myself was from
the other side of the tracks, raised
on food stamps and alcohol, and
thus flabbergasted beyond belief
by the sheer exultation of the
Farm. That part of myself, to this
University's eternal credit, is
something my four years here
taught me to subordinate, if not
bury.
There is truth to the snide as
sertion that Stanford is a 48-
month tutorial in bourgeoisifica
tion. People from the street who
come here, whatever their even
tual political rumblings, come
here for one reason only â€” to
shake off the tar of the gutter. I
am particularly vulnerable to that
urge.
The point is that it is all too
easy to bite the hand that feeds.
It is another thing altogether to
find new ways to heap praise upon
the idylls of college life, without
sounding either maudlin, naive,
repetitive or all of those in one.
I have little faith that I am, for
example, going to persuade the
electrical engineering mjyor, stuck
in the sophomore slump, that
Stanford is anything but a mon
umental flat tire on the ex
pressway of life.

But that's okay. I have the du
bious satisfaction of knowing that
however long it takes before it
happens, those of you not yet
graduated will take off your caps
and gowns, pack up your stereos
and scooters and inflatable Pabst
cans, and as you collapse into the
seat of your car or your airplane,
you will feel a nostalgia hit you
like none you've ever felt or will
ever feel again.
It will be more nagging than
that of a lost lover, because more
general; and it will be more
gnawing that that of a homeward
traveler, because so irreversible.
It will be sweet, too, like all
such emotions are; and it will, as
I suspect mine will, long after my
petty columns have moldered
away, stay with you till your dying
day.
Goodbye, Stanford. I will miss
you.
Frank Lester is a 1988 Stanford
graduate.
