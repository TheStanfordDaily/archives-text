## University isn't negotiating with workers in good faith 
### 
WE ARE writing to
protest the Stanford
administration's con
tinuing refusal to bargain in
good faith with the United
Stanford Workers (USW), the
union representing many Uni
versity maintenance and staff
employees.
The current contract between
Stanford and the union expires
August 31, and talks are now
in progress to negotiate a new
agreement.
We are appalled at several of
the administration's proposed
contract terms and changes,
which would effectively deny
workers a fair hearing of griev
ances arising in the course of
employment. These proposals
include the following:
1. Permitting only one union
representative, but unlimited
management representatives, to
be present at grievance hear
ings, thereby departing from
traditional practice where
workers are accompanied by
both a union official who under
stands contract language and a
steward who is familiar with job
conditions.
2. Allowing management to
cancel scheduled arbitration
hearings at their discretion,

thus adding to the existing
backlog of grievances that can
already take up to six years to
be resolved.
3. Not only permitting
managment to file grievances
against the union, but mandat
ing that these complaints take
precedence over those of
workers whose cases have been
pending for years.
4. Requiring union field rep
resentatives to clear with man
agement each and every conver
sation with workers, no matter
how informal, or be barred from
the work area, in effect grant
ing management arbitrary con
trol over union officials' ability
to communicate with members.
These and other University
proposals violate the basic pur
pose of collective bargaining,
which is meant to rectify the
imbalance of power between
workers and managers so as to
guarantee the former a fair
hearing in workplace disputes.
Aside from compromising
fairness, these proposals would
also make the hearing process
more formal, distant and com
plicated than necessary. They
would thus limit the ability of
workers and on-site supervisors
to resolve disagreements in the

most equitable and efficient
fashion possible.
Yet as misguided as these
proposals are, two others make
clear the University's basic
desire to deny workers strong
and effective representation.
The administration proposes
that it alone, rather than a
neutral arbitrator, be allowed to
decide whether grievances are
filed in a timely enough manner
to be heard. The possibility of
abusing this discretionary au
thority is obvious, as are the
reasons why the union objects
to such a provision.
The administration also
proposes that it continue to be
permitted to resolve disputes in
private conferences with individ
ual workers. These conferences
completely circumvent the pro
cedures and protections estab
lished by the collective bargain
ing agreement.
Workers who might not know
all their rights under the con
tract are vulnerable to intimida
tion and prone to accepting
settlements that set bad prece
dents for fellow employees.
In sum, we find the Universi
ty's position unacceptable. Stan
ford can and should do better
by honoring principles of fair-

ness and decency, respecting not
only faculty but other workers
who contribute to the Univer
sity community as well. Any
thing less is unworthy of this
institution and should not be
tolerated by those who care
about its future.
