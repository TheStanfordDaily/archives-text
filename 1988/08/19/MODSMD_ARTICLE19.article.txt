## Students need to know the truth about talks 
### 
SOME OF us were present
at the August 16 negotia
tions when management
negotiators walked out over the
presence of students on the
USW's team.
Their walkout demonstrates a
lack of respect for the USW's
right to select its own negotiat
ing team and should send stu
dents a very clear message that
they are unwilling to be honest
about their proposals and their
conduct.
There have been students
participating on the USW tean
at each of the past four
negotiating sessions, and other
members of the team have in
cluded representatives from the
Santa Clara County Labor
Council and pension experts.
Yet the administration only
challenged the presence of stu
dents. Our experience tells us
that there is a definite reason
for this. The administration
wants to be able to make pro
posals that undermine job secu
rity and destroy worker repre
sentation while still being able
to place blame on the USW for
any stalemate in negotiation
that has reached the attention
of the student body.
But when students are pres
ent, the administration can no
longer distort what is going on
in negotiations meetings.
We requested that students be
admitted to the negotiations
process as silent, neutral observ
ers so that students would have
a basis to make a judgment as
to which side was being more
truthful in its characterization
of the negotiations process.
It didn't seem to us that
anyone would have any real
problem with this proposal.
After all, how threatening can a
few students sitting in the back
of the room really be?
The USW immediately
promised their support in our
effort. They clearly wanted ne
gotiations conducted in the
most open and honest manner
possible. But the administration
rejected the idea. The USW
then proposed that a tape re
cording of the negotiations ses

sions be made available to all
interested parties.
Again, the administration
refused. Faced with an unwill
ingness to allow openness in
negotiations, the USW published
and made available both sides'
bargaining proposals.
This series of events showed
us that the administration's
claims must be met with skep
ticism and wariness, for they
clearly were desperate to hide
their proposals and their con
duct from students. After seeing
the contrast in the level of
openness exhibited by the USW
and the administration, and
after viewing the union's con
tract proposal, some students
decided that we wanted to act
on the side of the USW in ne
gotiations.
The USW felt that we could
provide valuable information
about the impact of their pro
posals on student employees and
the effects of contracting out
University functions such as
food service. Therefore they
invited us to give input as part
of their negotiating team, as did
three students during the 1985
negotiations.
The lack of honesty and good
faith on the part of the admin
istration has become even
clearer to us after seeing the
negotiations.
The tone of these sessions is
unlike that of any meeting that
we as students have ever atten
ded â€” the management
negotiating team continually
displays an unwillingness to
cooperate with the USW's nego
tiators. In the administration's
eyes, apparently the "Stanford
family" does not include Stan
ford workers.
Moreover, the management
proposals seem designed to force
a stalemate, not to reach a
settlement. If their proposals
were implemented, the adminis
tration would effectively gain
the power to determine who
could represent the workers in
union-management disputes and
to make decisions on matters
that are internal union policies.
Other proposals would elimi

nate the workers' rights to rep
resentation in meetings affecting
their job security and would
dictate that workers who win
arbitration cases over lost,
contracted-out jobs could receive
a monetary settlement but
would still not regain their jobs.
Hopefully, management will
quickly drop these proposals to
destroy union and job security.
Otherwise, we can only deter
mine that the administration,
for whatever reason, wants to
force the negotiations to break
down.
In such a situation, all mem
bers of the Stanford community
would suffer the consequences
of the administration's attempt
to cripple the union.
It is legally clear that the
union has the right to choose
its own negotiating team. But
the management still staged a
walkout over our presence. They
obviously must be frightened
that if the Stanford community
knows what is going on in ne
gotiations, the result will be
strong pulbic support for the
union.
In order to prevent this, they
have tried to pressure the union
to take us off their team for no
other reason than the fact that
we are students.
It is sometimes tempting to
attribute blame for problems in
labor-management relations to
both sides.
But who really seems to be
perpetuating the cycle of bad
faith bargaining? Which side
seems desperate to hide from
the community what's been
happening in the negotiations
meetings? Whose fault will it be
if the negotiations reach a
stalemate?
Please feel free to contact the
students participating in negoti
ations by calling the Council of
Presidents office at 725-1465 or
coming to the ASSU on the
second floor of Tresidder Union.
