# Profs tenure suit unresolved
## 
### Daniel Harrington 
Despite a judge's April ruling
that reworded a particularly con
tentious portion of his opinion
favoring Stanford in its suit with
former visiting Prof. Norman
Davies, the future of the suit still
hangs in the balance.
While three issues of Davies'
$9 million suit remain to be re
solved in court, Davies and his
attorney Paul "Pete" McCloskey
must regroup after this setback
to their case. The judge's decision
marked a victory for Stanford in
a dispute over the rights of visit
ing faculty here versus the rights
of tenured faculty.
Davies, considered by many to
be the world's leading historian
on Poland, was denied tenure by
a 12 to 11 vote of the faculty in
the History Department in 1986.
Davies has maintained that the
decision was based on his political
views rather than "fair and im
partial grounds."
According to Davies, the polit
ical controversy stemmed from
claims by Jewish members of the

department that his work was in
sensitive to the plight of the Po
lish Jewry during World War 11.
While the court ruled in March
that Stanford did not discriminate
against Davies for his political
views in denying him tenure, Uni
versity attorneys said they felt the

argument of their de
fense about academic
freedom.'

judge misunderstood Stanford's
policy on academic freedom for
visiting professors and asked him
to clarify this in his opinion.
The misunderstanding focused
on whether visiting professors are
entitled to the same academic free
dom as tenured professors.
In his original opinion in Stan
ford's favor, Santa Clara County

Superior Court Judge James
Stewart indicated that Stanford's
Statement on Academic Freedom
did not apply to Davies. The Uni
versity later contended that the
judge misunderstood, and that the
thrust of the statement applied to
Davies, while the means to take
recourse, in a questionable case,
do not.
However McCloskey, who is a
former congressman, said in
March that the University's at
tempt to change the wording of
the opinion substantially changed
its meaning.
He said once some rights are
extended to visiting professors, "It
becomes completely implausible
to argue that Davies is not also
protected by the procedures in
tended to preserve those rights."
Interviewed by telephone in
England, Davies' said yesterday
that "It is clear [Stanford] radi
cally changed the argument of
their defense about academic free
dom."
However, University attorney
Iris Brest, who is handling the
case for Stanford, said "the sub
stance of what the University
feels is right and proper applies
to everybody (both tenured and
visiting professors), but the pro
cedures (guaranteed to visiting
professors) are limited."
Brest had argued earlier that
all professors are guaranteed that
no personal views unrelated to ac
ademic scholarship can be factored
into any evaluation of their work.
Stewart agreed to reword his
opinion to reflect Stanford's policy
of limited rights for visiting pro
fessors, but said the change does
not affect the essential meaning
of the opinion.
However, Davies said he dis
agrees.
"I should have been treated

fairly in the light of academic free
dom," Davies said. "My only com
plaint was that Stanford abso
lutely refused to discuss at any
level what went on in the meetings
and the procedures that were not
adhered to."
As in most tenure review proc
esses, the proceedings of the meet
ing, in which Davies' tenure was
refused, remain closed to outside
review.
Davies said he feels Stanford
has a background of painful dis
putes about tenure, and that his
case canje on the heels of several
other disputes.
The three remaining issues in
the suit include Stanford's alleged
misrepresentation of its intentions
to Davies, breach of contract and
violation of the Labor Code.
Attorneys for both sides said
they expect further pre-trial ac
tivity to narrow the issues, and
the case should come up within
two to three months.
