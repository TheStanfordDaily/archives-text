# Profs tenure suit unresolved
## 
### Daniel Harrington 
Despite a judge's April ruling
that reworded a particularly con
tentious portion of his opinion
favoring Stanford in its suit with
former visiting Prof. Norman
Davies, the future of the suit still
hangs in the balance.
While three issues of Davies'
$9 million suit remain to be re
solved in court, Davies and his
attorney Paul "Pete" McCloskey
must regroup after this setback
to their case. The judge's decision
marked a victory for Stanford in
a dispute over the rights of visit
ing faculty here versus the rights
of tenured faculty.
Davies, considered by many to
be the world's leading historian
on Poland, was denied tenure by
a 12 to 11 vote of the faculty in
the History Department in 1986.
Davies has maintained that the
decision was based on his political
views rather than "fair and im
partial grounds."
According to Davies, the polit
ical controversy stemmed from
claims by Jewish members of the

against Davies for his political
views in denying him tenure, Uni

judge misunderstood Stanford's
policy on academic freedom for
visiting professors and asked him
to clarify this in his opinion.
The misunderstanding focused
on whether visiting professors are
entitled to the same academic free
dom as tenured professors.
In his original opinion in Stan
ford's favor, Santa Clara County

Superior Court Judge James
Stewart indicated that Stanford's
Statement on Academic Freedom
did not apply to Davies. The Uni
versity later contended that the
judge misunderstood, and that the
thrust of the statement applied to
Davies, while the means to take
recourse, in a questionable case,
do not.
However McCloskey, who is a
former congressman, said in
March that the University's at
tempt to change the wording of
the opinion substantially changed
its meaning.
He said once some rights are
extended to visiting professors, "It
becomes completely implausible
to argue that Davies is not also
protected by the procedures in
tended to preserve those rights."
Interviewed by telephone in
England, Davies' said yesterday
that "It is clear [Stanford] radi

their defense about academic free
dom."
