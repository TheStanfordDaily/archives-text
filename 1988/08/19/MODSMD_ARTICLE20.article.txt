# Students shouldn't negotiate
## 
### 
STANFORD University and
United Stanford Workers,
Local 680, formally ac
cused each other yesterday of
violating national labor law by
refusing to bargain in good
faith on a new contract.
Lawyers for both parties filed
"unfair labor practice" com
plaints with the National Labor
Relations Board in Oakland
after negotiations stalled on a
contract covering nearly 1,300
Stanford workers.
The dispute is over the un
ion's refusal to engage in nego

sions, contrary to the Local

The dispute is over the
union's refusal to
engage in negotiations
unless representatives
of six campus groups
attend sessions, con
trary to the Local 680-
Stanford agreement of
July 26.

680-Stanford agreement of July
26.
The University claims that
Local 680 is trying to unilater
ally and illegally change the
ground rules for bargaining that
were worked out between the
two parties at their first bar
gaining session on July 26.
The union proposed then that
outside community observers,
including representatives of six
campus organizations, be per
mitted to observe the normally

non-public negotiating meetings.
The six student organizations
the union proposed be repre
sented at negotiations were the:
• Asian American Student Asso
ciation
• Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford
• Black Student Union
• Stanford's Chicano/Latino
organization, MEChA
• Women's Center
• ASSU Senate and Council of
Presidents.
Our team declined to agree,
because, as recognized by
federal labor law, such arrange
ments impair the ability of the
two parties to engage in face-to
face, good-faith negotiations.
The two teams finally agreed
that the only observers who
would be present at negotiations
would be up to three Stanford
employees who are represented
by the union.
The latest claim of Local
680's leadership — that repre
sentatives of these six campus
groups will now be called "nego
tiators" for Stanford's bargain
ing unit workers — is simply a
sham to avoid the original
agreement.
The union's own rules and
their contract information
issued in writing to the workers
assured them that their bar
gaining team would be made up
of workers.
The students that the union
now says are on its negotiating
team have often changed from
session to session.
Despite the fact that the un
ion had filed an unfair labor
practice complaint, we urge the
union to reconsider and return
to the negotiating table so we ,
can work toward a contract for
our workers.
