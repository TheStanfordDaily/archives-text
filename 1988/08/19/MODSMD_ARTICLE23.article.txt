## Bing School is greenhouse of imagination and research 
### Vivian Fu 
Most people think of Stanford as an in
stitution of higher learning.
Students come here for a bachelor's
degree, some stay for a master's and a few
even have the stamina to wrest out a PhD.
But not everyone is here for undergrad
uate or graduate study. In fact, a small
group of students here haven't yet learned
to read or do arithmetic, much less take
SAT's.
These students are getting their intro
duction to the educational system at Peter
S. Bing Nursery School on Escondido Road.
Founded in 1965 with funding from the
National Science Foundation and a grant
from Peter Bing and Anna Bing Arnold,
Bing Nursery School was intended to pro
vide the best possible educational experi
ence for young children.
The school's first director, Edith Dowley,

wrote that the Bing Nursery School was
meant to be a "truly special place where
children are given back some of the things
modern life has tended to take away from
them." The school was designed specifically
for preschool age children.
Even the trees planted in the yard were
carefully picked to stimulate the children's
imagination. "Evergreens as well as trees
that lose their leaves were chosen, and
trees with things that fall off for the
children to pick up. Everything was meant
to provide an interesting environment for
the children," said Sylvia Ann White, the
present school director.
The Bing School was also designed to
provide a laboratory setting for Stanford's
now defunct Early Childhood Development
Department to observe children. Over the
years, however, the original emphasis of
the Bing School has changed, White ex
plained.
"Some years we offered full-day pro

grams for children and some years only
part-day programs were available. A few
years ago there were also a good deal of
children from lower socio-economic levels
who were being subsidized."
Those subsidies, which have since ceased,
eased the burden of Bing's high tuition.
Tuition ranges from $420 to $1040 a quar
ter, depending on the number of days per
week a child attends school. Most of the
pupils now come from surrounding com
munities, White said.
Alhough Bing School receives some
money from the School of Humanities and
Sciences, it is funded mostly by its tuition
charges.
Its exact relation to Stanford is now
under review by the Provost's Office be
cause of the little research that has been
done there recently.
The Psychology and Linguistics Depart
ments conduct most of the research now

done at Bing, but the overall level of re
search has decreased significantly since ear
lier years, White said.
The Psychology Department still offers
a two quarter sequence — "Observation of
Children" and a developmental practicum
— that involves the Bing School. In the
first quarter, Stanford students visit Bing
to observe the children and how they in
teract with each other. In the second quar
ter, students actually become teachers'
aides and help supervise the children.
Bing School has a research coordinator
who makes sure any potential research does
not harm the children. In addition, parental
permission is required before the children
are allowed to participate in any sort of
research study.
Rarely do the children ever complain.
"The kids see it very positively. They see
it as game-playing. To them, it's just one
more fun thing about coming to Bing
School," White said.

are used to the scrutiny, don't notice. At left is an example of their artwork.
