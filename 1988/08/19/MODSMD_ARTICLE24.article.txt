# Violence, passion and humor in Albany:

To the consternation of his
fans, William Kennedy is per
haps best known by the wider
public for his failure to turn his
novel Ironweed into a screen
blitzing filmplay.
He and Hector Babenco (who
had just come off the success of
"Kiss of the Spiderwoman ") got
together a few years back and
decided to pool their efforts to
transpose Kennedy's novel of
Depression-era life in Albany to
the big screen.
Kennedy, however, is far more
than a wanna-be film giant. He
has been around long enough to
know that the vicissitudes of the
artistic world — be they in film
or in publishing — are phenom
ena that, unless you want to go
half-insane brooding about them,
you just shrug off. And you go
on to the next project. Kennedy
is not your everyday whimpering
dilettante.
Besides the flop of his col

laboration with Babenco, Ken
nedy is best-known for the way
he stormed to the forefront of the
American publishing scene five
years ago with the publication of
his "Albany Cycle" books (Legs,
Hilly Phelan's Greatest Game,
and Ironweed).
It is by now a classic. tale of
the ink-bespattered unknown
beign lifted to the crest of the
New York toasting circuit. The
first two books of the cycle did
so miserably that when Kennedy
took the third part around to pub
lishers, he got more rejections
for his trouble than an lowa
Writers' Workshop neophyte.
But his current publisher came
up with the shrewd idea of is
suing all three books at once in
elegant paperback editions, and
so was born Kennedy the ce
lebrity.
Correction: Kennedy the super
star. Kennedy, the darling of the
book world, the man who had T.

Coraghessan Boyle slobbering at
his feet in a review of his latest
novel, Quinn's liook. Kennedy
the veteran newspaperman (he
worked, for 18 years, at papers
of every description, from San
Juan to Albany to Knight-
Ridder) turned bourgeois. Fame

is like that.
But fame, which has often
turned the strong literary voice
into the drawl of the namby
pamby, has not corrupted Ken
nedy's most important asset —
his originality.
Kennedy is obsessed with one
place — his hometown, Albany.
Every novel he's written ex
amines the city in delicate detail,
down to the last loading dock.
And, as the author has noted,
he has five more novels in his
head based on the Quinn-Phelan
line alone. "The main thing," he
has said, "is to create characters
who signify something very im
portant to you."
Eschewing the empty present
boundedness of current fiction,
Kennedy does just that. If you
feel uncomfortable about history,
he is not a writer for you. And
if you want your fiction full of
sweeping (but ultimately mean
ingless) Michener generalities,

this is not a man to read.
Kennedy has written that the
ultimate mystery of being a
writer lies in the fact that the
best writers have next to no idea
why their fiction has any effect
outside their own homes. The
writer "sees this power derived
less from (his) spirit than from
the spirit of the age working
through (him)."
Transcendental though this as
sertion might be, one suspects
Kennedy has very much of the
naif left in his blood.
He probably takes the attitude
of one of the characters in his
latest novel who, when asked by
a lad what the word "devotee"
means, replies, "It means you like
something quite well and pay
close attention to it. Something
such as words. I myself am such
a devotee of words that I'm writ
ing a book full of them."
