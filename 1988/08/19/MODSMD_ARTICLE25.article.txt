Mixing eggs, flour and salt with
"water in which she had lightly
bathed her privities," the young
Maud Lucinda Fallon creates a
magical "dumb" cake through

which she intends to divine the
secrets of her future love life with
Daniel Quinn, the boy she is des
tined to love.
In a fantastical world where
natural disasters and disease
wreak havoc on the lives of mil
lions, and every man or woman
is subject to freakish death or
maiming, the spiritual power of
sexuality is the only force which
seems to make sense in the tale
which winds through Quinn's
Book.
Along with her aunt, the fa
mous seductress and dancer Mag
dalena "La Ultima" Colon, Maud
provides the spiritual and sensual

driving force behind William Ken
nedy's most recent work, a tum
bling, unpredictable story set in
the middle of the 1800 sin a
theatrical Albany, New York.
In a suprising departure from
his past works, Kennedy sub
merges himself in a realm of su
perstition and metaphysics, and
fully explores a side of his writing
which was only hinted at among
the oft spare language of his past
books.
The switch marks Kennedy as
an amazingly versatile author. Of
the same stylistic mold as Isabel
Allende's The House of the Spirits,
Kennedy travels a long way from
the short, bitingly evocative lan
guage of his other Albany tales
with Quinn's Book.
A chronicle of Daniel Quinn's
inevitable journey from poverty
to wealth, from childhood to man
hood, Kennedy takes great

liberties in distracting the reader
from the slippery central plot line
with stories about the individuals
Quinn encounters.
The only security Kennedy ex
tends to the reader is the convic
tion that Quinn will finally rejoin
"Maud the wondorous," whom he
meets as a child after pulling her
from death in the icy waters of
the Hudson. Daniel Quinn is also
the only character relatively un
affected by the wild winds of for
tune which send John the Brawn
to the heights of wealth in the
world of prize fighting and gam
bling, and silences the voice of
the renegade journalist Dirck
Staats.
A war correspondent himself,
Quinn is a pragmatic survivor in
a sea of death and confusion dur
ing the Civil War. Stablized by an
enduring self confidence, the or
phaned son of Irish immigrants
is not immune from the turmoil
around him but drawn to it, oc
casionally as a participant and
more often as an observer.
Following a rambling plot with
no clear direction or end, the
reader's interest in Quinn and
Maud is sustained even through
the disappointments when Ken
nedy forgets to finish subplots in
his zest lor storytelling.
Full of the unexpected and the
same frank sense of sensuality
that imbues his other pieces of
fiction, Quinn's Book is masterful
embroidery which few will be able
to leave before they have finished
it.
