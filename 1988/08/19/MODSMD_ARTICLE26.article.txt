What is it about the ruthless
criminal — the killer who in the
coldest of blood strangles and
steals — that captivates the im
aginations of people like movie
goers, like Marcus Gorman, like
you and me?
This is the central question un
derlying Legs, the first of William
kennedy's so-called "Albany cycle"
books.
Jack "Legs" Diamond is one of
these men, a prohibition-rich
gangster whose climb to the top
of the gangster culture in Albany
endears him to the fascinations
of law-abiding — and not so law
abiding — citizenry the world
over.
One of these fans — more in
trigued than repulsed by the spill
of blood and the accumulation of
stolen wealth — is Marcus Gor
man, a successful and respected
New York-based lawyer (and a
character who pops up briefly in
Billy Phelan's Greatest Game).
In a recurring Kennedy tech
nique, Gorman allows the reader
guarded, inside glimpses of Dia
mond's existence and offers plenty
of soliloquies to glorify and
humanize the man who stays just
far enough out of reach to remain
a myth:
I had come to see Jack as not
merely the dude of all gangsters,
the most active brain in the New
York underworld, but as one of
the truly new American Irishmen
of his day; Horatio Alger out of
Finn McCool and Jesse James,
shaping the dream that you could
grow up in America and shoot
your way to glory and riches.
