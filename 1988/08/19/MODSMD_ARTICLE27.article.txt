# the
						magnetic artistry of William Kennedy
## 
### 
Working intimately as the
gangster's lawyer and sometime
confidante, Gorman comes to
realize that Diamond is a man
who lives by a different code of
morals and perhaps this is the
fascination which ensnares us.
Certainly Kennedy suggests as
much.
Yet, Kennedy's writing, which
retains a peculiar veneer of objec
tivity left over from his journalist
days, lets the reader decide
whether to damn Diamond or
worship him.
The book, which begins and
ends with Diamond's death, em
phasizes the legendary, mythical
quality of America's great mur
derers who introduce danger and
excitement to the lives of those
around them, either actually or
vicariously.
Their sex, their drinking, their
appreciation of life is more intense
than ours, or at least that's how
Gorman paints it. Years after Dia
mond's death, all his friends,
lovers, even enemies remember
his glory days as the most exciting
of their lives.
Yet, Kennedy leaves the reader
wondering whether the sheer
power of collective reminiscing
has given the legendary gangster
a power even he could not have
attained during his lifetime.
