# Kiki of Albany
## 
### 
l can't say the idea of Kiki's
company repelled me, but I
was intimidated. I've talked
about her beauty, and it was
never greater than at that mo
ment. She'd been primping for
Jack, calling up all her consid
erable wisdom of sex and
vanity, and had created a face
I've since thought of as The
Broadway Gardenia. It was
structured with eyebrow pen
cil, mascara, an awareness of
the shape of the hairline and
the fall of the loose curl. It
was beauty that was natural
and artificial at once, and the
blend created this flower child
of the Follies. No carefree At
lanta belle, no windblown,
wheat-haired Kansas virgin,
no Oriental blossom, or long
stemmed Parisian rose could
quite match her. Beauty, after
all, is regional. 1 remember the
high value the Germans put
on their rose-cheeked
Prauleins. And to me the
cheeks were Just blotchy.
