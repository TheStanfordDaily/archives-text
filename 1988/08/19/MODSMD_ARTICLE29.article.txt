Billy Phelan is a winner.
A hot-shot kid whose natural
talent and self-possession allow
him to play within, above and be
yond the rules of the game.
From ten-pin to eight-ball, Billy
Phelan carries with him the un
flinching cool of an inveterate
gambler and, as he hustles his
way through the nocturnal neon
of barrooms and pool rooms in
downtown Albany, he glows with
sang-froid.
It is exactly this "sassiness"
that makes Billy Phelan so fasci
nating, and that makes Billy
Phelan's Greatest Game so enter
taining to read. In this second
book of the Albany cycle, William
Kennedy's own stylistic verve
reaches its fullest expression. Out
of the rough-cut street gab of the
late 19305, Kennedy molds a novel
of fantastic energy and color.
The plot is set into motion when
Charlie Boy McCall, the son of a
local Irish Catholic politico, is kid
napped. When Billy is picked to
be the intermediary between the
McCalls and the kidnappers, he
is forced to choose between his
personal code of conduct — "never
fink on a fellow sportsman" —
and his liberty to gamble. The
action rumbles along peacefully
as the novel progresses, yet it of
ten seems secondary to the char
acters themselves.
The characters of Broadway
and State Streets are masterfully
drawn. Into the miscellaneous life
of his protagonist, Kennedy in
fuses believability and descriptive
detail. Despite his self-assured ex
terior, Billy Phelan has as many
anxieties as everyone else. In the
dark recesses of an abandoned
trainyard, even Billy is susceptible
to the ravages of loneliness and
all-encompassing fear.
Beyond the arrogance of Billy
Phelan lies a second story — the
story of the ostensibly detached
narrator. As in "Legs," Kennedy
complements his plotline with the
commentary of a biased observer,
in this case, an unusually insecure
newspaper columnist named Mar
tin Daugherty.
A life-long neighbor of the
Phelan's, Martin provides the
perfectly-skewed perspective on
Billy the natural, uplifting the
street hustler in his own mind to
the status of biblical prophet.
Yet, Martin is a man whose lack
of self-esteem is exceeded only by
his middle-aged complacency; he
lives a life of comparison, in con
stant flux between the decrepit
decadence of his father and the

unthinking religiosity of his
teenage son.
In his column, he makes the
inevitable comparison with Billy.
"By comparison ... I find myself
an embarassed ecclesiarch, a
foolish believer in luck, fate, ma
gicians, and divine animals. It
would serve me right if I died and
went to heaven and found out it
was a storefront run by Hun
garian palm readers."
And, mixed with a touch of sar
donic humor, the indomitable sas
siness and penetrating psychology
of the Kennedy style works
wonders on a bare-bones plot line.
In the waxy, smoke-filled alleys
of literary achievement Billy
Phelan's Greatest Game is a per
fect score.
