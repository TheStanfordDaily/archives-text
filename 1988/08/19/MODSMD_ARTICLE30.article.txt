Ironweed. is the epilogue of
drunkeness to the sobering nar
rative of Francis Phelan's life.
Twenty years before, Franny
Phelan had been a star baseball
player, a well-intentioned father
and a passable husband; now, in
1938, he is just another street
bum with a story.
In this Pulitzer prize-winning
third novel in the Albany cycle,
William Kennedy relates the har
rowing story of Billy Phelan's
father on his return to the city
and the family he abandoned.
Ironweed offers a classical tragedy
with an intoxicating spirit and a
fluid style, playing on the tragic
remains of one man, crumpled un
der the weight of circumstance
and self-inflicted guilt.
Francis Phelan lives with the
ghosts of his past. The ghosts of
his parents on their wedding
night, the ghosts of his fellow
workers as they set fire to the
sheets that blocked the strike
breaking scabs from deliverance,
and the ghost of his infant son,
Gerald.

On that inexpiable day in 1916,
when little Gerald slipped from
the hands of his father and onto
the kitchen floor, Francis ran
away. And he is still running.
Kennedy artfully splices the
ghosts of Francis* imagination
into the flow of the narrative,
blending the gritty realism of
street life with the tortuous vi
sions of a guilt-ridden conscience.
The snapshot images in the
novel seem to blur in a drunken
ness of their own. When Francis
walks through the cemetery
where his ancestors are buried,
Kennedy's creative genius
breathes life into the corpses
below. "In his grave, a
cruciformed circle, Gerald
watched the advent of his father
and considered what action might
be appropriate to their meet
ing. . . . Denied speech in life,
having died with only monosyl
labic goos and gaahs in his vocab
ulary, Gerald possessed the gift
of tongues in death."
Yet Kennedy supplements his
style with a message: what is real
in Ironweed is irrelevant — the
figures of Francis' imagination
are as genuine, if not more
genuine, than the characters who
litter the flophouses and soup
kitchens of Albany.
At times, even the fabric of the
novel is ruptured in a fit of
drunken plausibility. Why be
satisfied with one ending to one
story? When least expected, Ken
nedy reaches into his grab bag of
literary expression and pulls out
a compelling scene with two con
clusions.
Even when Kennedy plays
within the rules, he refuses to
pay obeisance to the confinements
of ordinary diction.
Ironweed. revels in its lack of

convention and its sensual des
criptions. Sometimes the detail
overwhelms the senses. "The
sweat of a workday, the sourness
of dried earth on his hands and
clothes, the putrid perfume of the
cemetery air with its pretension
to windblown purity, all this lay
in foul encrustation atop the
private pestilence of his being."
Kennedy captures the sight, the
sound and the smell of Franny
Phelan's circumstance with a dis
turbing vividness. Yet he focuses
on the precious blur of perception
which keeps Franny alive.
Ironweed thrives in its expres
sion of suffering and survival —
the novel shines despite the hope
lessness of its story.
