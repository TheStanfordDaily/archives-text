"Short Sharp Shocked"
Michelle Shocked has come a long way,
indeed.
From singing little ditties beside a Texas
campfire to creating a brilliantly-crafted
album in a Hollywood recording studio, the
young folksinger has proven to be one of
the fastest-rising new talents in the music
industry and the consummate dark horse
candidate for success.
Just six months ago, Shocked remained
a buried treasure known only to fre
quenters of folk festivals. Then came the
inconspicuous release of "The Texas
Campfire Tapes" (her unplanned, un
pretentious and utterly charming debut)
and the artist suddenly found herself
saddled with newfound acclaim.
Recorded entirely on a Sony Walkman
by a newly-won British fan at the 1986
Kerrville Folk Festival in eastern Texas,
"Tapes" highlights a dozen absolutely
electric tunes performed acoustically and
unaccompanied — with just her old six
string guitar and her expressive voice,
Shocked created an incredible 40 minutes
of musical nirvana for the gentleman, his
Walkman and her fortunate fans.
With "Short Sharp Shocked," her hot
ofT-the-presses studio debut, Shocked con
tinues to work her magic, this time estab
lishing herself as a serious vocalist as well

as an enjoyable lyricist. Though some of
the simple charms of "Tapes" have been
displaced by the veneer of production,
"Short" is an exciting and expressive col
lection that demonstrates the depth of
Shocked's sensitive songwriting and the
refinement of her voice.
The vocals, in fact, present the most
obvious sign of Shocked's evolving artistic
maturity. On "Tapes," her voice sounds
like a cross between Laurie Anderson and
Dolly Parton — flexible, but far from rich
and hardly dynamic.
Thanks to the benefits of better recording
equipment and the luxury of time, Shocked
aptly explores her range with some impres
sive results, adding an amazing texture to
the slower songs while still infusing energy
into the faster ones. The folk flavor she
relishes shines through and is compli
mented by added versatility and emotion.
But songwriting remains her true genius.
Each of the nine songs she penned for this
album (the tenth song is a remake of a
tune by Jean Ritchie titled "The L&N Don't
Stop Here Anymore") is as free-spirited
and fun as her earlier material.
But this time around she subtly blends
poignant comments about quirks of human
nature into her jocular lyrics. Almost as a
casual aside, Shocked will quickly interject
an interesting reflection before continuing
with her tale.
This touch transforms tracks like "Mem
ories of East Texas" from being just good

songs into great ones.
At the outset of "Memories," it
seems she is simply waxing a little
nostalgic, providing a retrospec
tive glance at the environs in
which she grew up.
The third stanza, however, in

Memories of East Texas and

Looking back and asking
myself, "What the hell'd ya let
'em break your spirit for?"
Their lives ran in circles so
small
They thought they'd seen it all
so
They couldn't make a place for

"Anchorage," the track most
likely to be released as the album's
first single, is a lighter but equally
interesting song. Her description

of a friend who discovers herself
locked into the role of housewife
is deftly evocative and a propos.
Another favorite is "If Love
Was a Train." Far from a
Freudian metaphor, "Train" is a
light-hearted description of
humankind's most tumultuous
emotion. The lyrics are typical
Shocked creations — off-the-wall
yet poignant:
But love ain't no train, naw
More like a broncing bull
And the most you got is 15
seconds in the saddle
And even if you manage to ride
You are all shaken up inside
And it's gonna be a long time
Before you ride that bull again
The whole album continues in
this vein, providing a large dose
of music that is just plain enter

taining. "Short Sharp Shocked" is
clearly one of the most innovative
and enjoyable records of the year,
a vehicle strong enough to launch
Shocked and her country-folk
music into the stratosphere of suc
cess.
Oh, by the way, there is some
method to the madness that con
cludes the album. Attentive lis
teners will find that, after a long
pause at the conclusion of "Black
Widow" (the last credited track
on the back cover), a raucous song
kicks in that seems more fitting
on a thrash-rock record than on
a folk album.
The scoop on the juxtaposed
11th track is that it is a remake
of a song from "Tapes" by
Shocked and a local punk band.
Though the words can be hard
to discern and the whole effort
can be hard to stomach, "Fog
town" provides a unique out
sider's perspective on San Fran
cisco that is fascinating and re
vealing. While the original is
much better — as with many
remakes — the version on
"Sharp" provides an interesting
change of pace.
