"Short Sharp Shocked"
Michelle Shocked has come a long way,
indeed.
From singing little ditties beside a Texas
campfire to creating a brilliantly-crafted
album in a Hollywood recording studio, the
young folksinger has proven to be one of
the fastest-rising new talents in the music
industry and the consummate dark horse
candidate for success.
Just six months ago, Shocked remained
a buried treasure known only to fre
quenters of folk festivals. Then came the
inconspicuous release of "The Texas
Campfire Tapes" (her unplanned, un
pretentious and utterly charming debut)
and the artist suddenly found herself
saddled with newfound acclaim.
Recorded entirely on a Sony Walkman
by a newly-won British fan at the 1986
Kerrville Folk Festival in eastern Texas,
"Tapes" highlights a dozen absolutely
electric tunes performed acoustically and
unaccompanied — with just her old six
string guitar and her expressive voice,
Shocked created an incredible 40 minutes
of musical nirvana for the gentleman, his
Walkman and her fortunate fans.
With "Short Sharp Shocked," her hot
ofT-the-presses studio debut, Shocked con
tinues to work her magic, this time estab
lishing herself as a serious vocalist as well

as an enjoyable lyricist. Though some of
the simple charms of "Tapes" have been
displaced by the veneer of production,
"Short" is an exciting and expressive col
lection that demonstrates the depth of
Shocked's sensitive songwriting and the
refinement of her voice.
The vocals, in fact, present the most
obvious sign of Shocked's evolving artistic
maturity. On "Tapes," her voice sounds
like a cross between Laurie Anderson and
Dolly Parton — flexible, but far from rich
and hardly dynamic.
Thanks to the benefits of better recording
equipment and the luxury of time, Shocked
aptly explores her range with some impres
sive results, adding an amazing texture to
the slower songs while still infusing energy
into the faster ones. The folk flavor she
relishes shines through and is compli
mented by added versatility and emotion.
But songwriting remains her true genius.
Each of the nine songs she penned for this
album (the tenth song is a remake of a
tune by Jean Ritchie titled "The L&N Don't
Stop Here Anymore") is as free-spirited
and fun as her earlier material.
But this time around she subtly blends
poignant comments about quirks of human
nature into her jocular lyrics. Almost as a
casual aside, Shocked will quickly interject
an interesting reflection before continuing
with her tale.
This touch transforms tracks like "Mem
ories of East Texas" from being just good
