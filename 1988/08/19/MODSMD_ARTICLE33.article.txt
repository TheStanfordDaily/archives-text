# Morrison-mania reaches the East Bay
## Doors-clone Wild Child joins the Celebration Saturday night at the Omni 
### Evan Tuchinsky Editorial staff 
Saturday night in Oakland, the Omni
will be transported 20 years back in
time. Nixon is still a respected president,
Woodward and Bernstein are just cub
reporters and the "me" decade has not
yet gotten underway.
This is the era of the Doors, perhaps
the most innovative and exciting live
band in the history of rock and roll.
Lead by vocalist extraordinaire Jim
Morrison, the group blazed trails and
electrified audiences until Morrison's
tragic death in 1971 effectively dissolved
the effort.
Now, 17 years later, the Doors are
as popular as ever. With the successful
release of the double-album, digitally
remastered "Best of the Doors" collec
tion at the end of last year, many rock
fans have started to rediscover the
genius behind Morrison's music.
Even so, audio recordings can only
provide a small portion of the total
Doors experience. Energetic on stage,

of this gap but can only do so much.
Enter Wild Child, the focus of "The
Jim Morrison Celebration" show that
makes its Bay Area stop at the Omni.
Blending rare video and live perform
ance, the Celebration offers a chance to
experience the Doors' concert chemistry
without the aid of a seance.
Wild Child coalesces around Dave
Brock, a spitting-image of Morrison in
look as well as deed. Though he con
sciously tries to avoid acting like a typ
ical impersonator and insists his band
is not a "clone-act," Brock captures the
Morrison feeling to such em extent that

these labellingß are extremely accurate
— Wild Child really is Beatlemania for
the Doors.
Accompanying Brock instrumentally
is a talented quartet, selected from a
host of hundreds who auditioned for
the parts. Yes, this is one extra musician
than the Doors had — but, then, simula
tions can never totally duplicate the
original.
Augmenting the live performance is
a score of rare videos, used to spell the
band as it takes its breaks without in
terrupting the flow of emotion that Wild
Child sparks. All told, the Celebration
has over five hours of material at its
disposal, making it a paradise for Doors
enthusiasts.
The doors at the Omni open up at
8:30 p.m. for the concert, but dinner is
served between 7 and 8:30. The tickets,
available at Bass, are $7 in advance and
$8 on the spot.
Advance purchase is the safest bet
for this show, however. The extrava
ganza has sold out the Roxy Theater
in Hollywood every time it has ever
played there, and L_A. has hardly been
an anomaly on the tour.

A dead-ringer for Jim Morrison in looks, voice and
performance, Dave Brock leads the quintet Wild
Child through its salute to the Doors. The band
will be featured in The Jim Morrison Celebration,
a live show enhanced by video that will play Sat
urday night at the Omni in Oakland.
