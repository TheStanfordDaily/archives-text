# Palo Alto entices with exquisite Italian eateries
## 
### Mia Manzulli Staff writer 
Real Italian food has always been slightly
ahead of its time. The healthful advantages
of Italy's "peasant foods" like beansa, olive
oil, pasta, vegetables and fish are finally
coming to the attention of the rest of the
world.
Lighter sauces, fresh herbs and vegeta
bles and homemade pastas are replacing
the heavier spaghetti and meatballs or
lasagne at many Italian restaurants around
the country. Downtown Palo Alto, boasting
a trio of Italian eateries that offer innova
tive dishes based on traditional Italian
cuisine, is no exception.
Osteria
247 Hamilton
Palo Alto
328-5700
For hustle, bustle and excellent Tuscan
cuisine, try Osteria, the very popular and
crowded restaurant at the corner of Hamil
ton and Ramona. Osteria is small, but it
makes the most of the space it has and
seems to keep all tables constantly filled.
The pretty arches and ceramic tile ac
cents add a simple touch to the busy at
mosphere. Fortunately, the noise level is
manageable and it is easy to carry on a
conversation.
Osteria has a nice choice of antipasti to
get your meal started, including a shrimp
cocktail, buffalo mozzarella and shrimp
with artichokes. My favorite is the melone
e prosciutto: salty Italian "ham " wrapping
sweet juicy melon is definitely an appetizing
must.
There are also soups like minestrone and
healthy salads as well. The Caesar salad
is very good, especially if you are a garlic
lover.
My only real complaint with Osteria is
the bread they serve to every table. Sour
dough bread may be the San Francisco
favorite but it is not Italian. With so many
good Italian breads around, I think they
could do better.
All of the pasta is made fresh at Osteria,
making this the place to be. My favorite
is the gnocchi, potato dumpling pasta that
many restaurants just can't get right. Os
teria's gnocchi is excellent: light but very
filling, the dumplings melt in your mouth.
The large portion comes with a meat sauce,
but you can substitute any of their other
sauces.
Try the pomodoro e basilico, an excellent
light tomato sauce with strong traces of
basil and finely chopped onions.
Osteria offers several specials — the fish

of the day as well as a pasta. We tried the
torteloni, a tortellini-like pasta filled with
creamy chicken and topped with a hearty
tomato sauce. Other pastas include lin
guine with red clam sauce, capellini
al'pomodoro e basilico, tortellini, fettucine
carbonaro ... you can't go wrong.
Chicken, veal and fish dishes are a great
choice whether alone or after the pasta (as
the Italians eat it). There is a cheesy
chicken parmigiana, a grilled chicken and
sole with tomatoes and garlic, to name a
few. All come with perfectly cooked

asparagus and carrots.
Sip some coffee, finish your wine, look
around at the faces. Osteria is a lively
dining spot with very moderate prices
(pasta, $7 to $8, meat $10 to $12) for
excellent food. Boun appetito!
La Pastaia
420 Emerson
Palo Alto
323-2464
La Pastaia, an "Italian cafe," is the
newest addition to the Palo Alto Italian
dining scene. This chic dining spot with
its glassed-in front is elegant and airy, but
never imposing.
The front room looks out onto Emerson,
but the restaurant wraps around to a more

private back dining room. If you like gazing
at tempting "dolci" (Italian sweets), stick
to the front room with its luscious display
behind the counter.
When you enter La Pastaia you'll be
greeted by the friendly hostess or the chefs
gregarious husband. Everyone here is eager
to please and very helpful.
On every table, instead of the traditional
basket of sliced bread, La Pastaia places
long crunchy breadsticks, Italian style.
Choose between butter and a spicy eggplant
tomato puree for dipping. It's a nice start

to any meal.
At the hostess* suggestion we ordered
one of the special appetizers — timbale di
polenta e gorgonzola. The polenta (cooked
corn meal) was loaded with gorgonzola and
fontina cheeses and studded with sweet
currants. A pepper tomato sauce edged the
mound of polenta to make a very attractive,
as well as rich and delicious, first course.
Food presentation is important to the
chef at La Pastaia — but only as the finish
ing touch to an already well-prepared meal.
The tortellini con salmone, a feast of pinks
and greens, looked too good to eat — but
once we began, it was easy to keep going.
Another excellent choice is the simple
but satisfying linguini as pomodoro. The
fresh tomatoes, garlic and oregano blend
for a light summery sauce, a perfect ac

companiment to the fresh pasta. A touch
of pungent parmesan makes it complete.
Dining at La Pastaia heightens one's ap
preciation for fine food. The dishes really
taste as good as they look — and vice versa.
Prices are extremely reasonable ($8 to $12
for most entrees) for a meal of this caliber.
Mange bene!
Cenzo's
233 University Avenue
Palo Alto
322-1846
Right at the heart of University Avenue
is Cenzo's, a casual yet pretty European
style restaurant with framed Italian
tourism posters on the walls. Although not
very wide, Cenzo's stretches far back with
plenty of tables along each wall and several
larger tables in the middle.
The tables are close together but the
atmosphere is cozy rather than confining.
Dinner at Cenzo's is a quiet and calming
affair.
A large counter towards the back of the
restaurant is where Cenzo's makes their
salads. A nice way to start a meal (or aid
it, as the Italians do), the salads here are
very large. A half-order of the delicately
seasoned Caesar salad is more than enough
if you plan to eat a full dinner. Wonderful
grated parmesan accents the salad nicely.
Cenzo's has a large selection of appetizers
including fried mozzarella — the crunchy
coating contains the melting cheese inside
only until you take that first bite. In ad
dition, you can order small pizzas with a
choice of toppings.
One thing that makes Cenzo's special is
the freshly baked bread on every table. In
many restaurants the bread is an ordinary
French, sourdough or Italian that simply
staves off hunger pangs until the meal
arrives.
Not the case here — the bread comes
in flat strips (almost like soft breadsticks)
and is chewy and buttery with a light herb
flavoring, good throughout the entire meal.
The nice-sized menu of meat, fish and
pasta dishes is diverse and tempting. My
favorite is the rigatoni al pomodoro: wide
macaroni tubes with a fresh tomato, mush
room and onion sauce, seasoned perfectly
with garlic and basil. This simple dish is
anything but ordinary. Attentive waiters
sprinkle grated cheese or freshly ground
pepper at your request.
A perfect ending to any Italian meal is
coffee — steaming hot espresso or cappuc
cino adds the perfect touch. Cenzo's offers
a pleasant dining experience right down to
the last morsel. Prices range from $6 to
$12 for most entrees.
