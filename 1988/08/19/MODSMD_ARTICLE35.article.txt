"Mr. North"
Aquarius Theater
430 Emerson St.
Palo Alto

Meet Mr. North: he's clean-cut,
well mannered, conversant in
English, French, German and Ital
ian, impeccably dressed and a Yale
grad to boot. But bumping into
Mr. North on the street is some
what shocking — you see, the free
spirited title character in Danny
Huston's "Mr. North" is loaded
with static electricity.
Anthony Edwards plays T.
Theophilus North, the highly
charged individual who winds his
way through the stratified society
of Newport, RI, in the summer
of 1926. Edwards is fairly endear
ing as the newcomer to Newport
who tries to make a living by
reading aloud to the elderly,
giving tennis lessons and tutoring
in French. He lacks the actual
"electricity" of his character, how
ever, giving a pleasant but unex
citing performance.
This scarcity of electricity is the
film's major flaw: Although
amusing and, at times, charming,
"Mr. North" lacks substance.
Children first discover Theop
hilus' static potential and quickly
label him "magic." Word of his
"powers" soon spreads and every

one wants to touch him. But not
everyone knows what to make of
him.
The servants of the town love
Mr. North and he is quickly
adopted by a distinguished "Eng
lish" butler from Chicago (played
by Harry Dean Stanton) and the
retired grand dame of the servant
class (played by none other than

Lauren Bacall). In this circle,
North soon becomes aware of the
Newport caste system that is care
fully monitored by Bacall, who
looks scarcely better than "faded"
in this role.
If he is accepted as an equal by
the servants, Theophilus is con
sidered an artful charmer by the
local elite. He delights the wealthy

and aging James McHenry Bos
worth (Robert Mitchum) who is
being pushed into an early grave
by his money hungry daughter
(Tammy Grimes) and the town
doctor (David Warner). Because
of North, Bosworth comes to life
again, much to the chagrin of his
daughter.
Although "Mr. North" boasts
big name talent, the story pro
vides little to showcase it. Without
deeper character development and
plot synthesis, "Mr. North" is
somehow lacking.
The film is as pristine as the
white ensembles favored Newport
in the 20's, and as pretty as the
"cottages" built along the coast;
but, in general, it's insubstantial.
"Mr. North" is entertaining, and
never drags, but don't expect any
explanations of T. Theophilus
North and his electric shocks.

"Tucker"
Falo Alto Square Theaters
3000 El Camino Real
Falo Alto
What kind of car do you drive?
If you're one of the 46 people in
the world who still drive a Tucker,
then you're soon to be rich.
Francis Ford Coppola, with the
backing of master film maker

George Lucas, has bounced back
from the disaster of "Gardens of
Stone" (the fact that you've prob
ably never heard about it indicates
what a flop it was) to make a
dramatic, touching and defini
tively American film about a man,
a car and a dream: "Tucker."
Preston Tucker, played with en
ergy and confidence by Jeff
Bridges ("Against All Odds" and
"Jagged Edge"), is portrayed as
nothing less than a genius: 40
years ago he tried to build a car
we'd be happy driving today, com
plete with seatbelts, shatter-proof
glass, advanced aerodynamics and
a rear engine.
So why aren't we all driving
Tuckers? The film pulls no
punches in its version of the
tragedy of Preston Tucker — just
expect politics and money to play
a big part.
But whether you believe every
thing that happens or not, Cop
pola builds upon his previously
demonstrated skill in making
vivid period films ("Cotton Club,"
"Peggy Sue Got Married") to offer
an exciting, sweeping view of
postwar America, complete with
realistic advertisements and the
familiar narrative voice of war
time newsreels.

Theophilus North demonstrates his shocking ability in a court scene
of Danny Huston's "Mr. North." Starring Anthony Edwards as the
title character, the film boasts an all-star cast including Lauren
Bacall, Anjelica Huston and Robert Mitchum.
Coppola also contrives realistic
sets with clever lighting and
camera angles to draw us into the
down-home farm kitchen, the anx
ious court room and the eerie
aircraft hangar of Howard
Hughes.
Coppola's concentration upon
technical details is allowed by the
strong individual performances of
the cast. Jeff Bridges should be
considered at Academy Award
time for his portrayal of the in
spired, optimistic man who loses
his dream and his reputation but
retains his integrity and humor.
Martin Landau (remember
"Space 1999"? If not, "Mission
Impossible" will do) might have
an even better shot for Best Sup
porting Actor as the humble ex
con who "catches" Tucker's
dream.
Tucker's supportive wife is
played nicely by Joan Allen, who
gets to strut her stuff in a
boardroom full of stuffy (male)

executives in a funny scene of pre
revolution feminine assertiveness.
And in a cameo appearance,
Dean Stockwell (the androgenous
gangster in "Blue Velvet") offers
an eerie interpretation of enig
matic billionaire Howard Hughes,
whom Tucker finds quite amus
ing.
The film is not fast-paced, but
Coppola films never are. He
makes films the way they should
be — larger than life — and he
gets great performances out of ac
tors often considered mediocre.
Besides being entertaining,
"Tucker" is also a warning. It is
a story of the demise of the Amer
ican entrepreneur under the
weight of big business and corrupt
bureaucracy.
And though we here at Stanford
can point to the likes of Steve
Jobs, let us not scoff as the jury
does when Tucker tells them,
"The radios in our cars will be
made by the countries that are
now our enemies!"
So drive your Nissans, Mazdas,
and Mitsubishis down to the local
theater and enjoy "Tucker."
