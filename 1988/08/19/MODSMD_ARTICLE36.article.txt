## Lichti's Olympic dream ends 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
Todd Lichti will be back at
Stanford before the start of
classes on Sept. 28.
Unfortunately, that means he
won't be with the Olympic bas
ketball team in Seoul, South
Korea pursuing a gold medal.
Lichti was cut Monday by
Olympic Coach John Thompson
along with Arizona forward Sean
Elliot. The cuts reduce the num
ber of players on the team to 14.
Two more cuts will be made by
Sept. 2.

"Due to the fact that we are
overloaded with players in their
position we had to release Sean
and Todd," Thompson said.
Lichti, an off-guard, was com
peting with the likes of Hersey
Hawkins, Mitch Richmond, Brian
Shaw and Dan Mejerle. All four
were first-round draft choices in
the NBA draft this past May.
Lichti's stock dropped in recent
weeks with poor performances in
exhibition games against squads
composed of NBA players.
By the end of the upcoming col
lege season, Elliot and Lichti
should become the No. 1 and No.

2 scorers respectively in the his
tory of the Pacific 10 Conference,
surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Elliot is a preseason candidate for
Player of the Year.
Arizona sports information di
rector Butch Henry said, that un
familiarity with Thompson's sys
tem and confusion over his role
caused Elliot problems.
Lichti has led the Cardinal in
scoring in all three of his years
at Stanford. He returns to a Car
dinal ballclub that heads into the
1988-89 season as co-favorite to
win the.PaolO along with Arizo
na.
