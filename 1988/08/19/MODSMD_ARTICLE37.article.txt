# Mets looking good heading into stretch
## 
### 
Making predictions about
the baseball season at
this point is a little like
betting on a horse race when the
horses are in stretch, but .. .
With roughly 40 games remain
ing for each team, most of the
league is already effectively elim
inated from postseason competi
tion. Realistically, 12 teams have
a shot at capturing the four
divisional titles.

In the American League West,
the Oakland A's lead the Minne
sota Twins by eight games. While
the Twins are in the race, the
smart money is riding on the A's.
Every time the Twins have
threatened to make a run, the A's
have pushed them back.
W T ith three rock solid starters
in Bob Welch, Dave Stewart and
Storm Davis, and a stellar bull
pen, the A's are well-armed for
the stretch run.
The Twins should take some
consolation though. The defend
ing World Champions should
finish with a better record than
they did last year. Frank Viola at
19-4, and sporting a 2.32 earned
run average, will win the Cy
Young award if he keeps it up.
That means Roger Clemens will
not. While I'm thrilled for Viola
— Krankie "Sweet Music" is from
my home town of Brooklyn — it's
a shame that Clemens wil not be
able to win an unprecedented
third straight award.
But the bottom line is that his
three starts since he injured his
back were awful and took his
otherwise superhuman statistics
and brought them back to the
level of merely excellent.
Each year the New York
Yankees acquire a mediocre
pitcher in the hopes that it
will bring them a pennant.
This year it was Richard Dot
son, formerly of the Chicago
White Sox. Dotson started off the
season looking like an All-Star.
But he hurt himself, didn't tell
anyone, made the injury worse,
finally went on the disabled list
and hasn't been the same since.
Real stupid, but then Roger
Clemens did the same thing with
his aforementioned back injury.
Meanwhile, on the strength of
their hitting, the Yankees are

right behind the Boston Red Sox
and the Detroit Tigers in the
American League East.
None of these three teams
seems to have the stuff to win
the division. The Tigers have done
it so far with mirrors, not real
talent. The Red Sox don't win
enough on the road. And, the
Yankees are suffering from a
serious dearth of major-league
pitchers.
But someone does have to come
out ahead, and it will be one of
those three teams. My guess is
the Tigers will become the first
repeat division champs since the
1980-81 Yankees. My brother
thinks the Yanks will come out
ahead — and he's not a Yankee
fan.
Ex-Daily sports editor Susan
Slusser would certainly pick the
BoSox. You may as well pick it
out of a hat.
The National League is the
biggest hodgepodge with
the Los Angeles Dodgers,
Houston Astros, San Francisco
Giants and Cincinnati Reds all
technically alive.
A week ago I'd have given this
one to the Giants. Don't get me
wrong, I don't like the Giants.
But, the Dodgers were fading, the
Astros are boring and the Giants
were coming on strong.
Then the Dodgers dealt the
moody power-hitting Pedro Guer
rero for John Tudor, one of the
league's best left-handers.
Tudor's 2.22 ERA leads the Na
tional League at the moment.
That move may have put them
over the top. Tudor adds glue to
the Dodger rotation. Now, the loss
of Fernando Valenzuela is
bearable. And, if rookie Ramon
Martinez is as good as his first
two outings, the Dodgers will be
tough to beat.
Sure enough, the New York
Mets will win the NL East.
They won't run away with
it like in '86, but they will win.
Neither the young Pittsburgh
Pirates, nor the solid but unspec
tacular Montreal Expos, seems to
have the guns to catch the Mets.
That seems unfortunate for
those teams in the future as well
as the present. The Mets are play
ing well below their ability this
year and should be quite a bit
better in '89.
So I'll make one bold prediction:
The Mets will win the World Se
ries in 1989.
As for this year, Tigers over
the A's and Mets over the
Dodgers.
The 1988 World Champion will
be the Mets in seven games.
