# Stanford grad student clones disease-causing gene

After three years of research,
Stanford graduate student Juer
gen Reichardt has isolated and
cloned the gene that causes
"galactosemia" — a disease that
affects one in every 50,000 people
worldwide.
A fifth-year doctoral student in
biochemistry, Reichardt said he
"took a gamble" with his research.
Since all living creatures come
from "some common ancestral
bug," Reichardt assumed the
same basic parts of genes would
remain in the cells of various
species, including humans, he
said.
Reichardt's gamble paid off.
Last summer, after comparing the
genes from human cells and from
yeast to other bacterial cells, he
isolated and cloned the mutated
gene which causes galactosemia.
According to Reichardt, his
results are unique because al
though gene cloning is now com
mon, "this gene is fairly hard to
clone."
A disease that affects a surpris
ingly large amount of the popu
lation, galactosemia can cause
cataract formation, ovarian fail
ure, liver disease, mental retarda
tion and even death in young
adults.

Caused by the buildup of galac
tose, a sugar that infants ingest
from their mothers' milk, galac
tosemia can cause vomiting and
diarrhea in infants, Reichardt
said.
If detected early, however,

surprisingly large

liver disease, mental
retardation and even
death in young adults.

many of these symptoms can be
prevented with a restricted diet,
Reichardt explained, adding that
some mental disabilities such as
slurred speech will probably per
sist.
Currently, every infant in Cal
ifornia is checked for the disease.
Since 1980, the Stanford Medical
Center has diagnosed galac
tosemia in about 12 to 16 infants.

according to Reichardt.
Since the release of his findings,
Reichardt has received calls and
letters from people grateful for
his efforts. "It's all very flatter
ing," he said. "They are all very
happy ... that someone has taken
an interest in the disease that
their kids have."
Nobel award winner Paul Berg,
professor of biochemistry at the
Medical School, advised Reichardt
throughout his gene research —
the subject for his graduate thesis.
"I like kids, and a disease that
kids have seemed like the ideal
thing to do (for a thesis)," Reic
hardt said.
But Reichardt's work is far
from over. After finishing up his
doctoral work at Stanford this
year, he will go to Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston where he
plans to experiment with the
cloned gene on an "animal model."
For now, Reichardt cannot
safely test the gene or look for a
cure with human subjects.
Although he claims to be unsure
about how the mice will react,
Reichardt said he hopes "the
symptoms will be reproduced" so
that a process of developing "safe
and effective cures" to galac
tosemia for people can proceed
rapidly.

Although graduate student Jucrgen Reichardt has cloned a gene
that produces galactosemia, a disease that can kill infants, he is
still busy looking for a cure to the disease.
