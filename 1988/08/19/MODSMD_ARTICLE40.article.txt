## 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
Calling Stanford's environmental impact
report "incomplete," "biased" and "appall
ing" community members yesterday gath
ered at a public meeting to criticize the
report that outlines University expansion
until the year 2000.
Released in July, the EIR is an applica
tion to Santa Clara County for a general
land-use permit that will allow the Uni
versity to continue growing until the turn
of the century. According to the report, by
the year 2000 the campus population will
increase by 7.4 percent and campus build
ing space will increase by 25 percent.
Over 25 partipants from Stanford, Palo
Alto and Menlo Park spoke at the four-hour
long hearing which about 75 people atten
ded.
Fearing that University growth will
result in more traffic problems, greater
noise pollution and an increased risk of
exposure to toxics, residents called for the

University to give more emphasis to com
munity concerns in the report.
Complaining that Stanford officials did
not consult campus homeowners groups
before they prepared the report, Prof. Jim
Patell said the EIR represented a "pervasive
disregard for the safety, quality of life and
property values of its residents." Patell rep
resented the Stanford Foothills Residents
group during the hearing.
It appears that "Stanford homeowners
and their families just don't matter
Other Stanford residents also complained
about what they said was the University's
apparent disregard for community issues
— particularly the safety of their families.
A primary concern among residents was
that the report did not adequately address
the problem of heavy, high-speed traffic.
The University will now revise the
report, addressing the concerns raised at
yesterday's hearing. Several community
members called for the meeting to be ex
tended so they could study the 400-page
report in greater detail.
