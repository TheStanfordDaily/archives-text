# COP plan new Orientation event
## Program will highlight diversity 
### Sally Hamaker Staff writer 
With Freshman Orientation
just a month away, the Council
of Presidents and the leaders of
many ethnic communities are
currently organizing a new pre
sentation that will introduce in
coming freshman to Stanford's
ethnic communities during this
fall's Orientation Week.
Saying that the COP wants
to "deal with the backlash that
a lot of the groups felt last year,"
COP member and fifth-year
senior Stacey Leyton said Stan
ford's different ethnic commu
nities are working together on
an evening program that will be
filled with dancing, music,

speeches and other cultural pre
sentations.
"When [freshmen] first get
here, people are either excited
or nervous about the diversity.
We felt that right at Orientation
we could send people the mes
sage that these groups are pos
itive and integral parts of the
Stanford community," Leyton
said. "We want to start off the
year on a positive note."
Scheduled for the evening of
Sept. 26, the program called
"The Fire Within" will feature
presentations from the Asian
American Students Association,
the Black Student Union,
MEChA and the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization. The
event will be the first Orienta-

tion program of its kind, accord
ing to Leyton.
The COP also plans to set up
information booths before and
after the program, giving fresh
men a chance to ask questions
and find out more about Stan
ford's ethnic communities.
According to Leyton, the COP
has modeled the program after
another held at last year's "You
Can Make a Difference" public
service conference. The program
— attended by faculty, staff and
students — highlighted the cul
tures of Stanford's various eth
nic groups.
According to COP member
David Brown, a junior, repre
sentatives from each community
will explain what they have ac
complished here.
