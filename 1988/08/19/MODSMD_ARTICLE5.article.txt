# University cuts-off talks with union
## 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
Contract negotiations between
the United Stanford Workers and
the University came to an abrupt
halt Tuesday when Stanford
refused to continue talks until stu
dents dropped out of the bargain
ing process.
As a result of the dispute, both
the University and the union have
filed charges with the National
Labor Relations Board.
While USW members claim that
Stanford has violated a "funda
mental right" by refusing to allow
them to choose their own negotiat
ing team, Stanford officials charge
that the union has refused to com
ply with the ground rules estab
lished in the first meeting on July
26.
The USW has filed an injunc
tion with the NLRB to order Stan
ford back to the negotiating table,
USW Attorney Mary Mocine said.
Stanford has also filed an injunc

tion against the USW, charging
the union with "violating the
agreements made" at the first
meeting.
The NLRB will conclude its in
vestigation early next week. Both
Mocine and University Lawyer
Michael Vartain said they hoped
to resume negotiations soon. The
union's contract with Stanford ex
pires on Aug. 31.
According to Vartain, at the
first negotiation meeting the two
sides agreed that no neutral ob
servers from the community
would sit in on the bargaining.
He pointed to a June 17 letter
University President Donald Ken
nedy sent to Stanford student
leaders, refusing to allow commu
nity members to attend negotia
tions.
"The University has no plans
... to change the established prac
tice that student and other Uni
versity groups do not attend ne
gotiation sessions," the letter
reads.
At Tueday's meeting — the
fourth meeting between the two
sides — the union insisted on in
cluding Stanford students as ne
gotiators, Vartain said.
Allowing persons who are not
union members to participate in
the negotiations is a "sham and
a pretense to avoid the orginal
agreement," Vartain said.
But Mocine said because some
Stanford students are union mem
bers they have as much a right
as any other USW representative
to sit at the bargaining table.
Student team members repre
sent the "special concerns" of stu

dents and student-workers; their
input is helpful and necessary
Mocine said, stressing that the
students "do not function as ob
servers."
Calling the University's action
a "slap in the face of the student
community," Mocine said Stan
ford is "poisoning the atmos
phere" of the talks by refusing to
negotiate with students present.
According to Mocine, students
were allowed to sit in during the
1985 contract talks between Stan
ford and the USW. She also noted
that students have attended the
last three bargaining sessions.
Senior Stacey Leyton said she
has attended the sessions not as
an observer but as a concerned
student representative who had a
right to be there.
