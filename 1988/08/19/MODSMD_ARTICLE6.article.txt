### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
Hoover Institution scholars
might soon invade the living
rooms of millions of Americans
in their own television program
to be broadcasted from a Stan
ford studio.
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell is proposing that the
Institution establish a "state
of-the-art media capability that
uses satellite technology"
through which scholars can
televise their views in a weekly,
hour-long television program.
Campbell revealed his broad
cast idea in the introduction to
Hoover's 1987 annual report
that was released last week.
Currently attending the Repub
lican National Convention in
New Orleans, Campbell was
unavailable for comment.

In his proposal, Campbell
envisions a television show
featuring Hoover scholars
leading public policy discus
sions.
According to Hoover Re
search Fellow George Marotta,
Hoover has "the critical mass
of scholars to do a complete
series."
The show could let the public
know more about the scholarly

resources Hoo
ver has to of
fer, Marotta
noted. "This
would be a se
ries that would
identify the
scholars as
Hoover schol
ars," he said.
The show,

which could be broadcasted


Anderson
both nationally and locally, could be in
fluential in the formation of public policy,
according to Campbell.
"The dissemination of information is cru
cial to public policy analysts and to the
formation of public policy," Campbell
wrote.
Campbell suggested establishing an on
campus studio for the weekly show. They
could also use the studio for other occa
sional television and radio interviews, ac
cording to Campbell.
Although designed for Hoover scholars,
the television studio could be used by Stan-

ford faculty members and other scholars
as well, he noted.
According to Hoover Senior Fellow Mar
tin Anderson, the show could bridge the
gap between academics and the general
public. "The electronic media is one of the
new ways to . . . disseminate scholarly
works and findings," Anderson said.
He noted that the campus studio would
be a time-saver because currently scholars
must travel to San Francisco to conduct
television interviews.
A faithful adviser to the Reagan Admin
istration, Anderson himself might very well
be one of the stars of the Hoover show.
Throughout this week's Republican Con
vention, several newspaper and television
reporters have bombarded him with inter
views.
