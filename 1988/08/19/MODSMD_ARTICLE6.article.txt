### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
Hoover Institution scholars
might soon invade the living
rooms of millions of Americans
in their own television program
to be broadcasted from a Stan
ford studio.
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell is proposing that the
Institution establish a "state
of-the-art media capability that
uses satellite technology"
through which scholars can
televise their views in a weekly,
hour-long television program.
Campbell revealed his broad
cast idea in the introduction to
Hoover's 1987 annual report
that was released last week.
Currently attending the Repub
lican National Convention in
New Orleans, Campbell was
unavailable for comment.

In his proposal, Campbell
envisions a television show
featuring Hoover scholars
leading public policy discus
sions.
According to Hoover Re
search Fellow George Marotta,
Hoover has "the critical mass
of scholars to do a complete
series."
The show could let the public
know more about the scholarly

resources Hoo
ver has to of
fer, Marotta
noted. "This
would be a se
ries that would
identify the
scholars as
Hoover schol
ars," he said.
