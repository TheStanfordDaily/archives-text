# Kennedy must wait till '89 to reoccupy home
## 
### Sally Hamaker Staff writer 
As most on-campus residents eagerly move into
their housing this fall, President Kennedy and his
wife will have to wait one more quarter before
moving back into their assigned housing.
Kennedy and his wife, Robin, were forced to move
out of the Lou Henry Hoover House in February,
after it was found to be seismically unsafe in Jan
uary. Now steel beams and concrete are being care
fully inserted into the building, strengthening it
without changing the original "look" of the Califor
nia State Historic Landmark.
The January 8 discovery of the house's problems
followed only a few weeks after the evacuation and
closure of Roble Hall. The two buildings share a
similar type of dangerously unstable construction
— using hollow clay tiles as a building material in
the walls — that makes the buildings susceptible
to seismic movement.
Reconstruction and strengthening work on the
mansion should be completed by the beginning of
1989, although the formal completion date isn't
until March of next year, according to Project Man
ager John Ryan.
The project is a "fast-track" construction project,
according tc Ryan. In this quickly paced construc
tion style, construction — mainly demolition work
— starts before all of the architectural drawings
have been completed. This tactic, which is also being

used in the Roble reconstruction
project, allows earlier job comple
tion. The demolition work began
the first of March, although the
drawings were not completed un
til June 15.
The strengthening project is
still ahead of schedule despite the
fact that more work must be done
on the building than was origi
nally planned. Besides stabilizing
the mansion's framework, the en
tire roof is being replaced.
The brick tile that makes up
the roof forms an intricate bas
ketweave pattern, according to
Ryan. The old roof, which has
never been reworked since the

house's construction in 1919, had
several holes in it. The asphalt
underneath the roof was "contin
ually watersoaked" Ryan said.
Another unforeseen project is
the required removal of exposed
asbestos in the basement of the
house, since construction workers
must spend time in these areas.
The strengthening of the build
ing structure is the main part of
the reconstruction project, accord
ing to Ryan. Experts spent over
a month deciding how to brace
the building without ruining the
original architecture of the house.
"We have to pay very close at
tention to details," Ryan said. "We
took over 500 photographs of the
house before starting reconstruc
tion. We wanted a very accurate
record of what it was, and we

want it to end up exactly the way
it was."
The care taken in the
reconstruction of the house
results from the numerous "his
toric landmark designations"
given the building.
The mansion, which was the
original home of Herbert Hoover
and his wife, Lou Henry Hoover,
is on the National Register of His
toric Places. It was also named a
National Historic Landmark in
1985.
But, according to Ryan, al
though the building has landmark
status, it is not eligible for any
federal funding. The entire proj
ect, which is projected to take
about 25,000 construction worker
hours, is costing the University
$2.3 million.
