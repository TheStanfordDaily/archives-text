# Lebanese group says it will keep hostages
## 
### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus - A
group claiming to hold Ameri
can hostages in Lebanon said
yesterday that its captives will
not be freed until a list of de
mands are met.
The assertion came in a writ
ten statement from a shadowy
group calling itself Islamic
Jihad (Islamic Holy War). The
group delivered the statement
to a news agency in Beirut ac
companied by a black-and
white photograph of hostage
American journalist Terry An
derson, to prove the state
ment's authenticity.
The group's declaration ap
peared aimed at scotching
widespread speculation that
the forthcoming cease-fire be
tween Iran and Iraq, due to
start Saturday, might result in
the freeing of all or some of
the Western hostages in
Lebanon.
"After the increasing talk
about the early release of the
foreign hostages, we announce
today the following: What
everyone expects soon is a
mirage assumed to be water by
a thirsty man."
The statement went on to ar
gue that "regional and inter
national developments will not
be of use at all in releasing the
captives in Lebanon."
Rumors circulating in the
West suggested that because

the faction of so-called
moderates appeared to have
won the upper hand in Iran,
leading to acceptance of a U.N.
cease-fire with Iraq, the
hostages stood a chance of
being released soon as the
moderates tried to improve re
lations with the West.
The nine Americans, three
Britons and one West German
missing in Lebanon are
believed to be held by Iranian
funded and -supported groups
of Shia Moslems, principally
the Hezbollah, or Party of God.
These groups are believed to
operate under several names
such as Islamic Jihad.
"We are the only side that
decides the fate of the captives,
be it at the level of releasing
them, executing them or main
taining their detention," the
statement released Thursday
said.
Among the conditions
demanded by Islamic Jihad:
• Release of Lebanese as well
as Palestinian prisoners from
Israeli jails.
• Israeli withdrawal from its
so-called security zone in
southern Lebanon.
• The reconstruction of
Beirut and southern Lebanon,
which the group said "have
been devastated by the
American-Israeli plot."
