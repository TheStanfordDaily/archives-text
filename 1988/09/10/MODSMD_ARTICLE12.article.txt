# USC and UCLA battle for the Roses...again
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
As Stanford opens its 1988
season in the rugged Pacific 10
Conference, one thing is certain.
The Cardinal is going to play a
lot of good teams. In addition to
non-league foes such as Notre
Dame, the Cardinal, as always,
will be sternly tested in each of
its eight Pac-10 games.
While the Southeast Conference
is widely held to be the best in
the land, top-to-bottom, the Pac
-10 ranks right up there. The most
recent proof of this came just last
week when perennial Pac-10 door
mat Washington State buried Big
-10 school Illinois 44-7 at Illinois.
Here is a run-down of the con
ference from Rose Bowl con
tenders USC and UCLA down to
the also-rans:
USC
The Trojans, currently ranked
6th by the Associated Press, at
least proved they are considerably
better than a poor Boston College
team, drubbing the Eagles 34-7
last week. Whether USC has the
talent to return to the Rose Bowl
is yet to be seen, although this
week's game with Stanford should
prove a fair test.
The key to the Trojans' season
is, of course, quarterback Rodney
Peete. The senior is considered to

be a top contender for the Heis
man Trophy and did nothing to
hurt his position by throwing for
271 yards last week.
Peete is joined by 1987 first
team All-Pac-10 tight end Paul
Green, who extended his 22-game
reception streak against the
Eagles, and split end Eric Affhol
ter. Affholter will forever be
known for the winning touchdown
reception against UCLA last year
that propelled the Trojans to the
Rose Bowl.
As usual USC has a good of
fensive line and a large stable of
backs to carry the ball. Fullback
Leroy Holt and tailback Steven
Webster are being touted as
honors candidates, and while
Webster did not play against B.C.
due to an injury, Aaron Emanuel
capably filled his shoes.
Defensively, tackle Tim Ryan is
expected to be a force, as are
safeties Cleveland Colter and
Mark Carrier. Colter and Carrier
combined for 10 interceptions last
season, including three in the sec
ond half of the UCLA game.
Perhaps USC's biggest hurdle
is surviving non-league games
against Oklahoma and Notre
Dame wins would help morale
greatly but a loss or two could
put a damper on the year.
UCLA
The Bruins thought they had a

Rose Bowl bid locked up last year
but USC came back with two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter
to win the L.A. city championship,
and the Pac-10, in the regular
season finale. In 1988, UCLA ap
pears to have the talent to make
another run for the Roses.
Leading the way is Los Angeles'
other Heisman candidate/quarter
back: Troy Aikman. Aikman
finished last year as the nation's
second-rated passer and, like his
cross-town counterpart, he got off
to a hot start this year. He com
pleted 13 of 17 passes for 197
yards and three touchdowns
before being pulled early in the
third quarter of the Bruins' 59-6
win over San Diego State.
Senior Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose
Bowl MVP, rushed for 122 yards
in the win and Darryl Henley
made UCLA's first possession a
short one, returning a punt 89
yards for a score only 3 minutes,
25 seconds into the contest. The
Bruins also return 240-pound
tight end Charles Arbuckle.
Defensively UCLA's strength is
with linebackers Carnell Lake and
Chance Johnson, two of the
team's top tacklers in 1987.
Noseguard Jim Wahler will put a
lot of pressure on opposing pas
sers, and Henley (the younger
brother of recent Stanford grad

Cardinal placekicker John Hopkins seems completely recovered from
the knee injury that put him out of action midway through last
season. Hopkins may also be called upon to do some punting if
senior Jeff Blaisdell falters in his attempt to replace the graduated
Doug Robison.
