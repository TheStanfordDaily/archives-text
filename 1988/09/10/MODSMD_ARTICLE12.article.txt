# USC and UCLA battle for the Roses...again
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
As Stanford opens its 1988
season in the rugged Pacific 10
Conference, one thing is certain.
The Cardinal is going to play a
lot of good teams. In addition to
non-league foes such as Notre
Dame, the Cardinal, as always,
will be sternly tested in each of
its eight Pac-10 games.
While the Southeast Conference
is widely held to be the best in
the land, top-to-bottom, the Pac
-10 ranks right up there. The most
recent proof of this came just last
week when perennial Pac-10 door
mat Washington State buried Big
-10 school Illinois 44-7 at Illinois.
Here is a run-down of the con
ference from Rose Bowl con
tenders USC and UCLA down to
the also-rans:
USC
The Trojans, currently ranked
6th by the Associated Press, at
least proved they are considerably
better than a poor Boston College
team, drubbing the Eagles 34-7
last week. Whether USC has the
talent to return to the Rose Bowl
is yet to be seen, although this
week's game with Stanford should
prove a fair test.
The key to the Trojans' season
is, of course, quarterback Rodney
Peete. The senior is considered to

be a top contender for the Heis
man Trophy and did nothing to
hurt his position by throwing for
271 yards last week.
Peete is joined by 1987 first
team All-Pac-10 tight end Paul
Green, who extended his 22-game
reception streak against the
Eagles, and split end Eric Affhol
ter. Affholter will forever be
known for the winning touchdown
reception against UCLA last year
that propelled the Trojans to the
Rose Bowl.
As usual USC has a good of
fensive line and a large stable of
backs to carry the ball. Fullback
Leroy Holt and tailback Steven
Webster are being touted as
honors candidates, and while
Webster did not play against B.C.
due to an injury, Aaron Emanuel
capably filled his shoes.
Defensively, tackle Tim Ryan is
expected to be a force, as are
safeties Cleveland Colter and
Mark Carrier. Colter and Carrier
combined for 10 interceptions last
season, including three in the sec
ond half of the UCLA game.
Perhaps USC's biggest hurdle
is surviving non-league games
against Oklahoma and Notre
Dame wins would help morale
greatly but a loss or two could
put a damper on the year.
UCLA
The Bruins thought they had a

Rose Bowl bid locked up last year
but USC came back with two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter
to win the L.A. city championship,
and the Pac-10, in the regular
season finale. In 1988, UCLA ap
pears to have the talent to make
another run for the Roses.
Leading the way is Los Angeles'
other Heisman candidate/quarter
back: Troy Aikman. Aikman
finished last year as the nation's
second-rated passer and, like his
cross-town counterpart, he got off
to a hot start this year. He com
pleted 13 of 17 passes for 197
yards and three touchdowns
before being pulled early in the
third quarter of the Bruins' 59-6
win over San Diego State.
Senior Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose
Bowl MVP, rushed for 122 yards
in the win and Darryl Henley
made UCLA's first possession a
short one, returning a punt 89
yards for a score only 3 minutes,
25 seconds into the contest. The
Bruins also return 240-pound
tight end Charles Arbuckle.
Defensively UCLA's strength is
with linebackers Carnell Lake and
Chance Johnson, two of the
team's top tacklers in 1987.
Noseguard Jim Wahler will put a
lot of pressure on opposing pas
sers, and Henley (the younger
brother of recent Stanford grad

Cardinal placekicker John Hopkins seems completely recovered from
the knee injury that put him out of action midway through last
season. Hopkins may also be called upon to do some punting if
senior Jeff Blaisdell falters in his attempt to replace the graduated
Doug Robison.
Thomas Henley) is considered one
of the league's top cornerbacks.
Washington
The Huskies had what was for
them an off year in 1987, going
only 7-4-1. They did, however,
reach a bowl game (they beat
Tulane 24-12 in the Independence
Bowl) for the ninth straight year
under coach Don James and are
once again one of the top teams
in the West.
Washington, as usual, will be
led by a huge offensive line. This
year's edition averages 6-foot-3
1/2, 275 pounds and includes four
returning starters. Cary Conklin
steps in at quarterback to replace
Chris Chandler, the offensive
player-of-the-game in last
season's Senior Bowl.
Conklin came off the bench
against Arizona last year when
Chandler was injured and he
threw for 237 yards and two
touchdowns in that game. His fa
vorite target will be split end
Brian Slater, who had 38 catches
last year and averages 19.4 yards
per recption for his career.
Additionally, the Huskies
return running backs Vince Weat
hersby and Aaron Jenkins, both
of whom rushed for over 650
yards last season.
Oregon
Coach Rich Brooks' Ducks took
a few people by surprise last year,
upsetting Colorado, Washington
and USC before coming back to

earth with a four-game losing
streak. The question is whether
this year's Ducks will play like a
team that beat three top-20
squads last season or a team that
lost to California by two touch
downs three weeks later.
Quarterback Bill Musgrave
returns after throwing for 1,836
yards last year and has breakaway
threat Terry Obee (33 catches,
19.4 yards per catch) returning
on the outside. The Ducks also
return their three top rushers
from last season but need to
replace two holes in their offensive
line.
Defensively, Oregon lost first
team All-Pac-10 selections Rollin
Putzier and Anthony Newman,
but free safety Thorn Kaumeyer
tops the list of seven returning
defensive starters.
Arizona
Arizona's record last season
looked more like a soccer team's
than a football team's with three
ties, but with a year of experience
running Coach Dick Tomey's
wish-and-shoot offense should
enable the Wildcats to turn some
of those ties into wins in 1988.
The offense, a combination be
tween the wishbone and the run
and-shoot (talk about strange bed
fellows. . .), best utilizes the ath
letic ability of quarterback Ronnie
Veal. Bobby Watters, a transfer
from Southern Methodist, was the
starter until breaking a thumb in
the third game of the year. Veal,
then a freshman, took over and
led the team with 566 yards rush
ing and nine rushing touch
downs. The two split time in the

Wildcats' opener, a 24-13 win over
Oregon State.
The Wildcats also have all three
running backs/slot backs return
ing from last season, and flanker
Derek Hill was a first-team All-
Pac-10 selection in 1987, record
ing 45 catches for 798 yards.
As an added bonus, Arizona has
All-Pac-10 first-teamers to anchor
both lines: center Joe Tofflemire
and noseguard Dana Wells. Fur
thermore, the 'Cats have eight
home games.
Stanford
California
The Bruce Snyder era contin
ues. Snyder took over as head
coach last season and, although
the squad went only 3-6-2, he
turned a team going downhill very
fast into a team going up. The
Golden Bears return 20 starters
from last year's team, the most
in the conference.
Troy Taylor threw for 18 touch
downs in only nine games last
year and has three 30-catch
receivers back to aim at. On the
ground, halfback Chris Richards
ran for 668 yards last year and
the Bears have four starting
linemen returning.
On the other side of the ball,
Cal has a pass rush that improved
greatly as the year went on and
lost only linebacker Ken Harvey
from their front seven. The only
bad news for the Bears is that
they must play five league games
on the road where they were 1-4
last year.

Senior Alan Grant gets set to return a punt during last season's
Big Game. Grant, who will start at cornerback for the third-straight
year, led the nation in average yards per punt return (16.52) in 1987.
Washington State
The first rule of predicting the
order of finish in any Pac-10 sport
is to pick Washington State and
Oregon State ninth and tenth. Of
course, that was before the
Cougars clobbered Illinois 44-7 in
Illinois last week. How good is
the WSU team of 1988? Well,
they're at least a lot better than
the Illini.
Junior Timm Rosenbach threw
for 228 yards and one touchdown
and ran for three more last week
after throwing for 2,446 yards in
1987. Tailback Steve Broussard
caught 59 passes last year, scored
nine touchdowns, and has five re
turning offensive linemen in front
of him this year.
Arizona State
Well, the Sun Devils are prob
ably the best ninth-place team in
the country. They're still a ninth
place team, though.
Strengths? Well, look at the
kicking game. Senior Mike Schuh

punted for a 42.7-yard average
while placekicker Alan Zendejas
hit 13 of 15 field goals and 27 of
27 extra points.
Quarterback Daniel Ford
returns, but he only completed 49
percent of his passes last year and
leading receiver Aaron Cox was a
first-round draft choice of the
Rams.
The Sun Devils' two top rushers
from last season also graduated,
leaving a dearth of experience be
hind Ford. Defensively, they have
some young-but-experienced de
fensive backs and a three-year
starter at strong safety. They have
the advantage of not playing
UCLA this year, but still, Coach
Larry Marmie will have a rough
time of it in his first season.
Oregon State
The Beavers opened the Pac-10
season by playing Arizona last
weekend and while they
dominated most of the statistics
(418-238 yards in total offense,
27-14 in first downs, 38 minutes
of possession, one turnover each),
they somehow ended up 11 points
short.
Hopefully they'll get used to it.

through the 1987 season and guided the Card to five wins in its
final seven games.
