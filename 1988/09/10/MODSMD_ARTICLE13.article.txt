# Speedster Batson still Stanford's surprise star
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
It is hard to separate the words
"surprise" and "Walter Batson."
When he entered Stanford last
fall, odds were that Batson would
be one of the score of freshmen
that would redshirt their first
season in order to gain experience
in the Cardinal coaching system
as well as in college football in
general.
Hardly. Along with earning a
fair share of playing time (com
peting in eight games, starting
two), Batson surprised everyone
in Stanford Stadium last Novem
ber against California, catching an
82-yard touchdown pass the
longest TD reception in Big Game
history to garner himself a
place in the record books and help
the Cardinal return the coveted
Axe to the Farm.
These freshman feats seemed
unbelievable to even Batson him
self. "I was sort of surprised by
it," he said. "I really had my
doubts about my ability. I wanted
to be able to do it, but I lacked
confidence.
"My high school and college
coaches told me I could do it. I

guess the ability was there all
along, but I just have to have
confidence," he added.
The Cardinal coaching staff,
however, knew he could excel all
along. Of the five wide receivers
that joined the team last year,
only Batson escaped the redshirt
status that relegated his class
mates to the sidelines. The rookie
responded with 10 receptions for
223 yards and two TDs, both on
long bombs, plus a springtime
showing of four passes for 94
yards.
"When the ball is in his hands,
he is really something to watch,"
Stanford wide receiver Coach
Dave Baldwin observed. "He has
shown flashes of greatness, and
we expect some high-quality
things from Walter this fall."
Baldwin has a lot of high
powered coaching company in his
regard for Batson. A native of
Miami, he was recruited highly
by hometown powerhouses Miami
and Florida State as well as Notre
Dame, Penn State and Duke. A
possible impact player at any of
these schools, Batson decided to
head westward to an unranked
and underrated Stanford.
"It was the first time I was

away from home, the first time I
had left the state," the sophomore
confessed. "I like the weather
its closer to the weather at home.
The education was pretty big,
[and] I really liked the combina
tion of football and academics."
Certainly a nice compliment,
considering one of the schools he
turned down went on to claim the
national championship last year
while two others are among the
favorites this year. But for Bat
son, it is the style of play that
matters more than just the
ranking.
For a receiver, few things are
more encouraging than an offense
that stresses passing. The Cardi
nal has traditionally featured
quarterbacks noted for their
throwing take John Elway and
Jim Plunkett, for instance and
the Stanford air attack develops
fine receivers as well. For anyone
gunning for pro football, this is
a great incentive indeed.
"There is a good opportunity to
play pro football after Stanford
because [the team] has a pretty
sophisticated passing attack,"
Batson said. "I can learn a lot
more about receiving and reading
defenses."
