# Card set to kick off season against Trojans
## Sophomore quarterback Johnson leads Stanford against No. 6 USC 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
While most people have little
idea what to expect when the cur
tain rises on the 1988 Stanford
football squad at 12:30 p.m. today,
the one certainty is that the Car
dinal sure has a doozy of an
opener.
The good news is that Stanford
returns 16 starters from the team
that went 5-6 last season. Un
fortunately USC, today's oppon
ent, returns 17 starters from a
8-4 team last year. And the
Trojans are ranked sixth in the
Associated Press poll. And USC
has already played a game this
year, crushing Boston College 34-
7 on Sept. 1.
Bad news for the home 11? No,
not at all.
According to junior running
back Jon Volpe, "I'm looking for
ward to it. If we win this game
we're on our way."
Senior cornerback Alan Grant
seconds that opinion. "I think
that's a great way to open the
season because it's here (at Stan
ford Stadium)," he said. "That's
the best way to dictate the season
by opening (with a big win)."
But how will Stanford defeat
the mighty Trojans? The Cardi
nal's last Stanford Stadium win
over USC came behind the arm
of a y young man named Jim
Plunkett. Stanford Coach Jack El
way thinks the time is right this
year, however.
"I think we might be under
rated," Elway said. "I think
there'll be some surprises. If it's
a question of whether we're plan
ning on winning, the answer is
yes."

The first thing Stanford will
have to do is stop, or at least slow
down, USC quarterback Rodney
Peete. The senior Heisman
Trophy candidate tore up Boston
College with a myriad of big plays,
both planned and unplanned. He
completed 21 of 33 passes for 271
yards and one touchdown and
threw for another touchdown
(called back due to a penalty)
while jumping out of bounds after
scrambling to elude the Eagles'
rush.
Elway, who understatedly
referred to the Trojan signal
caller as "a problem," said, "We're
not going to stop Rodney Peete
cold. We're not going to stop the
offense cold."
Advocating an aggressive de
fense, Elway hopes to pressure
Peete while keeping him con
tained. "We're going to have to
make them earn everything they
get," he said.
Peete's favorite targets are
senior split end Eric Affholter
(seven catches at Boston College)
and senior tight end Paul Green,
who has caught a pass in 22
straight games. Junior fullback
Leroy Holt ran for 86 yards be
hind a stereotypically big and
strong Trojan offensive line, and
junior Aaron Emanuel scored two
touchdowns from his tailback po
sition.
Defensively, the Trojans are led
by strong safety Cleveland Colter,
a second-team All-Pacific 10 Con
ference selection last year. Colter
had 11 tackles, second only to in
side linebacker Brian Tuliau's 12,
last Thursday against Boston Col
lege.

Senior defensive tackle Lester Archambeau (72), a Sporting News and Associated Press Honorable
mention All-America in 1987, has led Stanford in quarterback sacks the past two seasons.
USC Coach Larry Smith said
his team played "maybe a little
better than we thought they
would," against the Eagles, but
added that "playing Stanford ...
is a big challenge.... I just think
they're a very fine team.
"They're going to be sky
high. . . . We know that we're
going to have our hands full. We
know we're going to have to play
one heck of a game."
For Stanford, the biggest ques
tion of the preseason was an
swered by Elway on Tuesday
when he named sophomore Brian
Johnson as the starting quarter
back. Johnson took the reins of
the Cardinal in mid-season last
year and guided the squad to a
5-2 record in the games he
started. Redshirt freshman Jason
Palumbis had a great spring, how
ever, and had been even with
Johnson throughout the fall.
Elway said Johnson's experi
ence was the deciding factor but
added that he feels "the circum
stances we have at quaterback are
very good," and that he would
have the confidence in Palumbis
to go with him at any time if
Johnson were having a bad day.
With injured starters wide
receiver Ed McCaffrey (deep thigh
bruise) and tight end Jim Price

(pulled hamstring) both expecting
to see only minimal playing time,
if any, during the game, Johnson
will be looking for sophomore Wal
ter Batson upheld. Batson started
the final two games as a true
freshman last year and responded
with an 82-yard touchdown catch
against California last year, a Big
Game record.
Stanford also returns fullback
Jon Volpe, who had two 100-yard
rushing games last season. Volpe
will also have the advantage of
running behind a very strong Car
dinal offensive line, led by Andy
Sinclair. The senior center has
started all 34 games played during
his Stanford career and was a
Football News All-America last
year.
Elway has experimented with
the run-and-shoot offense
throughout the spring and fall
practice sessions and has said he
will use some elements of that
offense this season. The run-and
shoot typically uses four wideouts
and one back and gives the quar
terback a plethora of options
based upon the type of defense
being played.
"We've always had options in
our passing game," Elway said,
"but there are even more options
in the run-and-shoot." Elway
added that the run-and-shoot
would be appropriate considering
the Cardinal's depth at wide
receiver and relative lack of depth

at running back.
Defensively, seniors Lester Ar
chambeau and Ray Huckestein
will lead the assault on Peete. Ar
chambeau, a defensive tackle, has
started all 23 games since red
shirting as a freshman in 1985
and has produced 15 sacks in his
two seasons. Noseguard Huckes
tein has started the Cardinal's
last 15 games and has 143 tackles
in his career.
Both will be responsible for
keeping Peete contained in the
pocket while pressuring him into
throwing early. Meanwhile, re
turning cornerbacks Grant and
Kevin Scott will be charged with
keeping the Trojan receivers cov
ered. Both Grant, a senior, and
Scott, a true sophomore, have
blazing speed and previous start
ing experience working for them.
Senior inside linebacker Kevin
Richardson, the team's leading
tackier last year, will be busy stop
ping the run, the short passing
game, and Peete's scrambling, so
expect him and junior inside
backer Jono Tunney to record a
lot of tackles, otherwise the sec
ondary will be in big trouble.
"I think [an opener] is a game
you go into and expect the unex
pected," Elway said. "The key
thing in an opener is go in and
do what you can execute ... min
imize the number of mistakes."
And who knows what the result
will be.

But how will Stanford defeat
the mighty Trojans? The Cardi
nal's last Stanford Stadium win
over USC came behind the arm
of a y young man named Jim
Plunkett. Stanford Coach Jack El
way thinks the time is right this
year, however.
"I think we might be under
rated," Elway said. "I think
there'll be some surprises. If it's
a question of whether we're plan
ning on winning, the answer is
yes."

The first thing Stanford will
have to do is stop, or at least slow
down, USC quarterback Rodney
Peete. The senior Heisman
Trophy candidate tore up Boston
College with a myriad of big plays,
both planned and unplanned. He
completed 21 of 33 passes for 271
yards and one touchdown and
threw for another touchdown
(called back due to a penalty)
while jumping out of bounds after
scrambling to elude the Eagles'
rush.
Elway, who understatedly
referred to the Trojan signal
caller as "a problem," said, "We're
not going to stop Rodney Peete
cold. We're not going to stop the
offense cold."
Advocating an aggressive de
fense, Elway hopes to pressure
Peete while keeping him con
tained. "We're going to have to
make them earn everything they
get," he said.
Peete's favorite targets are
senior split end Eric Affholter
(seven catches at Boston College)
and senior tight end Paul Green,
who has caught a pass in 22
straight games. Junior fullback
Leroy Holt ran for 86 yards be
hind a stereotypically big and
strong Trojan offensive line, and
junior Aaron Emanuel scored two
touchdowns from his tailback po
sition.
Defensively, the Trojans are led
by strong safety Cleveland Colter,
a second-team All-Pacific 10 Con
ference selection last year. Colter
had 11 tackles, second only to in
side linebacker Brian Tuliau's 12,
last Thursday against Boston Col
lege.

Senior defensive tackle Lester Archambeau (72), a Sporting News and Associated Press Honorable
mention All-America in 1987, has led Stanford in quarterback sacks the past two seasons.
USC Coach Larry Smith said
his team played "maybe a little
better than we thought they
would," against the Eagles, but
added that "playing Stanford ...
is a big challenge.... I just think
they're a very fine team.
"They're going to be sky
high. . . . We know that we're
going to have our hands full. We
know we're going to have to play
one heck of a game."
For Stanford, the biggest ques
tion of the preseason was an
swered by Elway on Tuesday
when he named sophomore Brian
Johnson as the starting quarter
back. Johnson took the reins of
the Cardinal in mid-season last
year and guided the squad to a
5-2 record in the games he
started. Redshirt freshman Jason
Palumbis had a great spring, how
ever, and had been even with
Johnson throughout the fall.
Elway said Johnson's experi
ence was the deciding factor but
added that he feels "the circum
stances we have at quaterback are
very good," and that he would
have the confidence in Palumbis
to go with him at any time if
Johnson were having a bad day.
With injured starters wide
receiver Ed McCaffrey (deep thigh
bruise) and tight end Jim Price

(pulled hamstring) both expecting
to see only minimal playing time,
if any, during the game, Johnson
will be looking for sophomore Wal
ter Batson upheld. Batson started
the final two games as a true
freshman last year and responded
with an 82-yard touchdown catch
against California last year, a Big
Game record.
Stanford also returns fullback
Jon Volpe, who had two 100-yard
rushing games last season. Volpe
will also have the advantage of
running behind a very strong Car
dinal offensive line, led by Andy
Sinclair. The senior center has
started all 34 games played during
his Stanford career and was a
Football News All-America last
year.
Elway has experimented with
the run-and-shoot offense
throughout the spring and fall
practice sessions and has said he
will use some elements of that
offense this season. The run-and
shoot typically uses four wideouts
and one back and gives the quar
terback a plethora of options
based upon the type of defense
being played.
"We've always had options in
our passing game," Elway said,
"but there are even more options
in the run-and-shoot." Elway
added that the run-and-shoot
would be appropriate considering
the Cardinal's depth at wide
receiver and relative lack of depth

at running back.
Defensively, seniors Lester Ar
chambeau and Ray Huckestein
will lead the assault on Peete. Ar
chambeau, a defensive tackle, has
started all 23 games since red
shirting as a freshman in 1985
and has produced 15 sacks in his
two seasons. Noseguard Huckes
tein has started the Cardinal's
last 15 games and has 143 tackles
in his career.
Both will be responsible for
keeping Peete contained in the
pocket while pressuring him into
throwing early. Meanwhile, re
turning cornerbacks Grant and
Kevin Scott will be charged with
keeping the Trojan receivers cov
ered. Both Grant, a senior, and
Scott, a true sophomore, have
blazing speed and previous start
ing experience working for them.
Senior inside linebacker Kevin
Richardson, the team's leading
tackier last year, will be busy stop
ping the run, the short passing
game, and Peete's scrambling, so
expect him and junior inside
backer Jono Tunney to record a
lot of tackles, otherwise the sec
ondary will be in big trouble.
"I think [an opener] is a game
you go into and expect the unex
pected," Elway said. "The key
thing in an opener is go in and
do what you can execute ... min
imize the number of mistakes."
And who knows what the result
will be.

See these students having fun? No students are here today. This is as close to a student cheering
section as the Cardinal will get. Classes and students return the week of Sept. 26.
While most people have little
idea what to expect when the cur
tain rises on the 1988 Stanford
football squad at 12:30 p.m. today,
the one certainty is that the Car
dinal sure has a doozy of an
opener.
The good news is that Stanford
returns 16 starters from the team
that went 5-6 last season. Un
fortunately USC, today's oppon
ent, returns 17 starters from a
8-4 team last year. And the
Trojans are ranked sixth in the
Associated Press poll. And USC
has already played a game this
year, crushing Boston College 34-
7 on Sept. 1.
Bad news for the home 11? No,
not at all.
According to junior running
back Jon Volpe, "I'm looking for
ward to it. If we win this game
we're on our way."
Senior cornerback Alan Grant
seconds that opinion. "I think
that's a great way to open the
season because it's here (at Stan
ford Stadium)," he said. "That's
the best way to dictate the season
by opening (with a big win)."
