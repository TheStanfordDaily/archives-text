# Card set to kick off season against Trojans
## Sophomore quarterback Johnson leads Stanford against No. 6 USC 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
While most people have little
idea what to expect when the cur
tain rises on the 1988 Stanford
football squad at 12:30 p.m. today,
the one certainty is that the Car
dinal sure has a doozy of an
opener.
The good news is that Stanford
returns 16 starters from the team
that went 5-6 last season. Un
fortunately USC, today's oppon
ent, returns 17 starters from a
8-4 team last year. And the
Trojans are ranked sixth in the
Associated Press poll. And USC
has already played a game this
year, crushing Boston College 34-
7 on Sept. 1.
Bad news for the home 11? No,
not at all.
According to junior running
back Jon Volpe, "I'm looking for
ward to it. If we win this game
we're on our way."
Senior cornerback Alan Grant
seconds that opinion. "I think
that's a great way to open the
season because it's here (at Stan
ford Stadium)," he said. "That's
the best way to dictate the season
by opening (with a big win)."
But how will Stanford defeat
the mighty Trojans? The Cardi
nal's last Stanford Stadium win
over USC came behind the arm
of a y young man named Jim
Plunkett. Stanford Coach Jack El
way thinks the time is right this
year, however.
"I think we might be under
rated," Elway said. "I think
there'll be some surprises. If it's
a question of whether we're plan
ning on winning, the answer is
yes."

The first thing Stanford will
have to do is stop, or at least slow
down, USC quarterback Rodney
Peete. The senior Heisman
Trophy candidate tore up Boston
College with a myriad of big plays,
both planned and unplanned. He
completed 21 of 33 passes for 271
yards and one touchdown and
threw for another touchdown
(called back due to a penalty)
while jumping out of bounds after
scrambling to elude the Eagles'
rush.
Elway, who understatedly
referred to the Trojan signal
caller as "a problem," said, "We're
not going to stop Rodney Peete
cold. We're not going to stop the
offense cold."
Advocating an aggressive de
fense, Elway hopes to pressure
Peete while keeping him con
tained. "We're going to have to
make them earn everything they
get," he said.
Peete's favorite targets are
senior split end Eric Affholter
(seven catches at Boston College)
and senior tight end Paul Green,
who has caught a pass in 22
straight games. Junior fullback
Leroy Holt ran for 86 yards be
hind a stereotypically big and
strong Trojan offensive line, and
junior Aaron Emanuel scored two
touchdowns from his tailback po
sition.
Defensively, the Trojans are led
by strong safety Cleveland Colter,
a second-team All-Pacific 10 Con
ference selection last year. Colter
had 11 tackles, second only to in
side linebacker Brian Tuliau's 12,
last Thursday against Boston Col
lege.

Senior defensive tackle Lester Archambeau (72), a Sporting News and Associated Press Honorable
mention All-America in 1987, has led Stanford in quarterback sacks the past two seasons.
