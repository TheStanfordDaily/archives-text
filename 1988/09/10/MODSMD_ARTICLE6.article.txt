# USC well armed with Heisman-candidate Peete
## 
### Jon Weisman Senior staff writer 
Everyone's out to get USC's
Rodney Peete, but nobody can
catch him.
Take, for example, the UCLA
Bruins.
Last November, they took on
USC in a winner-take-all bid for
the Rose Bowl. But they couldn't
stop Peete, the Trojans' quarter
back, who rousted the Bruins with
15-for-19 passing for 197 yards
in the second half to rally USC
to a 17-13 win.
Next, try the Oakland Athletics.
They drafted Peete, the
Trojans' third baseman, in the
14th round in June. They made
offers Peete was able to refuse
barely then couldn't refuse
making better offers. They tried
to sign him to a six-week minor
league contract for this summer,
then later a four-week stint. Peete
respectfully declined.
They said, okay, you'll just play
on weekends in games near South
ern California. They did all but
say Peete would only play on
nights when the temperature is a
comfortable 70 degrees and have
a steak dinner and Tootsie Pop
waiting for him at first base every
time he got a hit. All this with
first-round-level money attached.
But they couldn't catch him
either.
The only guy that seems to be
catching anything is Rodney
Peete.
For one thing, "Sweet" Peete,
as the Tootsie Pop-toting senior
is nicknamed, is catching the idea
of how many licks it takes to get
to the center of the race for the
Heisman Trophy. That number
would be six: the amount of foot
ball preview magazines Peete, 22,
has been on the cover of touting
him as a trophy candidate (he
would be the first black quarter
back ever to win it).
"It's exciting," the 6-foot-2,
195-pound Peete said with a
toothpaste-ad gleam. "I'd be lying
if I said it wasn't. . . . But you've
also got to keep it in perspective.
Being a Heisman Trophy candi

date doesn't mean a whole lot at
the beginning of the year."
Maybe not, but it still indicates
what caliber of athlete we're
dealing with here.
"Rodney's a legitimate Heisman
Trophy candidate if there ever
was one," USC Coach Larry
Smith said. "It's interesting; now
when you just say 'Rodney' to
anyone who knows sports around
the country, they know who
you're talking about. He's every
thing you look for in a quarter
back."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
wouldn't argue. He has said that
Peete "has got the best mobility
of any quarterback we've seen.
He throws well on the run and
is an outstanding athlete."
Peete has such all-around ath
letic prowess that the play he is
most known for is not a great
touchdown, but a tackle.
With time running out in the
first half in that game against
UCLA last Nov. 21, USC had
driven to the Bruins' five-yard
line. Peete's pass to Randy Turner
was tipped and picked off by
UCLA's Eric Turner.
Turner had no one in front of
him as he began his 100-yard dash
down the sideline to give UCLA
a 17-0 halftime lead. But 92,516
fans saw Peete race after Turner
from behind and make a game
saving tackle, cutting that 100-
yard run down to 89 and that
potentially insurmountable lead
back down to 10-0.
"I would've caught him sooner,
but I was watching the clock to
make sure there was no more time
left," joked Peete.
Don't downplay Peete's offen
sive accomplishments when recall
ing the tackle, though. Peete com
pleted 59 percent of his passes
last year for a school-record 2,709
yards, and with one season
remaining, he already has career
school records in passes attempt
ed, passes completed, and passing
yardage.
Last Thursday night Peete con
tinued where he left off, complet
ing 21 of 33 passes for 271 yards

and a touchdown in the Trojans'
34-7 win.
In addition, he batted .338 with
12 home runs on the diamond last
season, despite suffering a broken
hand when hit by a pitch in his
first at-bat of 1988.
Those staistics inspire
legitimate comparisons to two
renowned pro athletes, Doug Wil
liams and Bo Jackson.

Williams and Jackson have
bucked tradition and broken new
ground in sports. Williams
flaunted the stereotype against
black quarterbacks as he became
the Super Bowl XXII MVP this
year for the Washington
Redskins, and Jackson is success
fully playing both football and
baseball on the professional level
for the Los Angeles Raiders and

the Kansas City Royals.
About the stereotype, Peete said
"I think people are looking at me
as a quarterback. When I was
growing up, people said I wouldn't
get a shot, and that when I got
older I had better change my po
sition and develop my skills to be
a wide receiver or defensive back.

The Cardinal defense must concentrate on stopping senior Heisman trophy candidate Rodney Peete,
who dismantled Stanford's secondary with five touchdown passes in USC's 39-24 victory last season
in the L.A. Coliseum.
"That made me want to play
quarterback even more because of
the stereotype. I wanted to prove
that I could play quarterback and
nothing would stand in my way."
Peete is ready to stand in that
pocket and brave anyone, defen
sive tackles or otherwise, who
tries to stop him from quarter
backing. Unless, of course, he
chooses to play baseball.
You see, for Peete's sake (ugh),
Doug Williams' footsteps may be
inviting to follow, but Bo Jack
son's are not. If the Athletics
hadn't required Peete to attend
spring training next year, which
would then have prevented Peete
from graduating on time, Peete
might have signed.
In any case, Peete, who says
his role model is former Stanford
quarterback/outfielder John El
way and who once talked seriously
with Elway about going to Stan
ford, may still choose baseball over
football, but he won't try to
double.
"Playing the quarterback posi
tion takes too much time in men
tal work," Peete said. "If I came
in at the middle of the season like
Bo Jackson of the Raiders, I
couldn't have that much impact."

Peete will finish his final sea
sons in the two sports, and then
make his decision based on how
he does and his draft position.
Meanwhile, you know what
Peete practices in his spare time?
Golf.
"A lot of golf," said Peete, whose
second cousin is PGA golfer Cal
vin Peete. "Every free chance I
get that's what I do, trying to get
better. ... It's kind of addictive."

In that light, dare we make an
other comparison to NBA su
perstar Michael Jordan, a three
handicap golfer who has hinted
he might walk the pro links after
his skywalking days are over?
"I'd love to, to tell you the
truth, but I don't know if I will
be good enough," Peete said.
So here's your picture of Rod
ney Peete. A mixture of Doug Wil
liams, Bo Jackson and Michael
Jordan.
Well, that may not quite cap
ture Peete. But that's okay no
one else can.

'I wanted to prove that
I could play quarter
back and nothing
would stand in my
way.'

The truly incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band kicks off the 1988 season
today by offering some pre-game philosophical views of "How a Deadhead Views Sesame Street"
Watch out for the Snuffleufagus, not one of "The Other Temptations of Christ," which will be the
Half-time presentation.
Everyone's out to get USC's
Rodney Peete, but nobody can
catch him.
Take, for example, the UCLA
Bruins.
Last November, they took on
USC in a winner-take-all bid for
the Rose Bowl. But they couldn't
stop Peete, the Trojans' quarter
back, who rousted the Bruins with
15-for-19 passing for 197 yards
in the second half to rally USC
to a 17-13 win.
Next, try the Oakland Athletics.
They drafted Peete, the
Trojans' third baseman, in the
14th round in June. They made
offers Peete was able to refuse
barely then couldn't refuse
making better offers. They tried
to sign him to a six-week minor
league contract for this summer,
then later a four-week stint. Peete
respectfully declined.
They said, okay, you'll just play
on weekends in games near South
ern California. They did all but
say Peete would only play on
nights when the temperature is a
comfortable 70 degrees and have
a steak dinner and Tootsie Pop
waiting for him at first base every
time he got a hit. All this with
first-round-level money attached.
But they couldn't catch him
either.
The only guy that seems to be
catching anything is Rodney
Peete.
For one thing, "Sweet" Peete,
as the Tootsie Pop-toting senior
is nicknamed, is catching the idea
of how many licks it takes to get
to the center of the race for the
Heisman Trophy. That number
would be six: the amount of foot
ball preview magazines Peete, 22,
has been on the cover of touting
him as a trophy candidate (he
would be the first black quarter
back ever to win it).
"It's exciting," the 6-foot-2,
195-pound Peete said with a
toothpaste-ad gleam. "I'd be lying
if I said it wasn't. . . . But you've
also got to keep it in perspective.
Being a Heisman Trophy candi

date doesn't mean a whole lot at
the beginning of the year."
Maybe not, but it still indicates
what caliber of athlete we're
dealing with here.
"Rodney's a legitimate Heisman
Trophy candidate if there ever
was one," USC Coach Larry
Smith said. "It's interesting; now
when you just say 'Rodney' to
anyone who knows sports around
the country, they know who
you're talking about. He's every
thing you look for in a quarter
back."
Stanford Coach Jack Elway
wouldn't argue. He has said that
Peete "has got the best mobility
of any quarterback we've seen.
He throws well on the run and
is an outstanding athlete."
Peete has such all-around ath
letic prowess that the play he is
most known for is not a great
touchdown, but a tackle.
With time running out in the
first half in that game against
UCLA last Nov. 21, USC had
driven to the Bruins' five-yard
line. Peete's pass to Randy Turner
was tipped and picked off by
UCLA's Eric Turner.
Turner had no one in front of
him as he began his 100-yard dash
down the sideline to give UCLA
a 17-0 halftime lead. But 92,516
fans saw Peete race after Turner
from behind and make a game
saving tackle, cutting that 100-
yard run down to 89 and that
potentially insurmountable lead
back down to 10-0.
"I would've caught him sooner,
but I was watching the clock to
make sure there was no more time
left," joked Peete.
Don't downplay Peete's offen
sive accomplishments when recall
ing the tackle, though. Peete com
pleted 59 percent of his passes
last year for a school-record 2,709
yards, and with one season
remaining, he already has career
school records in passes attempt
ed, passes completed, and passing
yardage.
Last Thursday night Peete con
tinued where he left off, complet
ing 21 of 33 passes for 271 yards

and a touchdown in the Trojans'
34-7 win.
In addition, he batted .338 with
12 home runs on the diamond last
season, despite suffering a broken
hand when hit by a pitch in his
first at-bat of 1988.
Those staistics inspire
legitimate comparisons to two
renowned pro athletes, Doug Wil
liams and Bo Jackson.

Williams and Jackson have
bucked tradition and broken new
ground in sports. Williams
flaunted the stereotype against
black quarterbacks as he became
the Super Bowl XXII MVP this
year for the Washington
Redskins, and Jackson is success
fully playing both football and
baseball on the professional level
for the Los Angeles Raiders and

the Kansas City Royals.
About the stereotype, Peete said
"I think people are looking at me
as a quarterback. When I was
growing up, people said I wouldn't
get a shot, and that when I got
older I had better change my po
sition and develop my skills to be
a wide receiver or defensive back.


Benjamin Tong - Daily File
The Cardinal defense must concentrate on stopping senior Heisman trophy candidate Rodney Peete,
who dismantled Stanford's secondary with five touchdown passes in USC's 39-24 victory last season
in the L.A. Coliseum.
"That made me want to play
quarterback even more because of
the stereotype. I wanted to prove
that I could play quarterback and
nothing would stand in my way."
Peete is ready to stand in that
pocket and brave anyone, defen
sive tackles or otherwise, who
tries to stop him from quarter
backing. Unless, of course, he
chooses to play baseball.
You see, for Peete's sake (ugh),
Doug Williams' footsteps may be
inviting to follow, but Bo Jack
son's are not. If the Athletics
hadn't required Peete to attend
spring training next year, which
would then have prevented Peete
from graduating on time, Peete
might have signed.
In any case, Peete, who says
his role model is former Stanford
quarterback/outfielder John El
way and who once talked seriously
with Elway about going to Stan
ford, may still choose baseball over
football, but he won't try to
double.
"Playing the quarterback posi
tion takes too much time in men
tal work," Peete said. "If I came
in at the middle of the season like
Bo Jackson of the Raiders, I
couldn't have that much impact."

Peete will finish his final sea
sons in the two sports, and then
make his decision based on how
he does and his draft position.
Meanwhile, you know what
Peete practices in his spare time?
Golf.
"A lot of golf," said Peete, whose
second cousin is PGA golfer Cal
vin Peete. "Every free chance I
get that's what I do, trying to get
better. ... It's kind of addictive."

In that light, dare we make an
other comparison to NBA su
perstar Michael Jordan, a three
handicap golfer who has hinted
he might walk the pro links after
his skywalking days are over?
"I'd love to, to tell you the
