Stanford

Trojan quarterback Rodney
Peete is the key to USC's offense.
The Heisman Trophy candidate,
who burned Stanford for five
touchdown passes last season,
racked up 271 yards on 21-of-33
passing in the Trojans 34-7
season-opening win against Bos
ton College. If Stanford is going
to shut down the Trojans, the
- defensive line, led by Lester Ar
chambeau must put pressure on
Peete early and often. The Car
dinal will be looking for a big game
from Archambeau, who led the
team in sacks the past two sea
sons.

John Volpe returns at fullback
after starting six games in 1987,
but now the Cardinal junior will
be the focus of the team's rushing
attack. Volpe will have to improve
his 3.4 yards-per-carry average of
1987 to be effective. In order for
the Trojans to keep the Stanford
ground game in check, USC's in
side linebackers will need to con
tain Volpe. Sophomore Brian
Tuliau, who is making only his
second start at inside linebacker
will be responsible for plugging
any holes in the line.

Quarterback Brian Johnson,
who led the Cardinal to a 5-2
record in his seven games as a
starter last season, will most
likely have to pass to an inexpe
rienced receiving corps today due
to injuries to wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey and tight end Jim
Price. On the other hand, USC
has a talented and experienced de
fensive secondary, led by sopho
more free safety Mark Carrier,
the Trojans' top returning tack
ier. Along with strong safety
Cleveland Colter, Carrier could
put Johnson through a very long
afternoon.

Trojan punter Chris Sperle
averaged only 36 yards per kick
in 1987, but his punts had such
excellent hang time that only 21
of his 55 kicks were returned, for
an average of less than 5 yards
per return. Stanford's Alan Grant
was the nation's leading punt
returner last year, averaging 16.5
yards per return. Grant will be
hard pressed to duplicate last
year's average today: Only three
returns against Sperle in 1987
gained more than 10 yards.

Tight end Paul Green is in his
second season as a starter for
USC. As a junior in 1987, Green
was the team's third-leading
receiver and was named first team
All-Pac 10. Expect Peete to throw
in Green's direction often, espe
cially since Stanford's Rob
Englehardt, who will cover Green,
is making his first start at strong
safety.

Two sophomores may play a key
role if the game comes down to
the wire. As a true freshman last
season, Trojan placekicker Quin
Rodriguez tied a school record for
most field goals in a game (four)
on his way to a 13-for-17 field
goal mark for the season.
Rodriguez also connected on 35-
of-37 PATs. His Stanford counter
part, John Hopkins, was 8-of-ll
in the field goal department before
a knee injury ended his season
five games early. How well Hop
kins has recovered from his injury
may become a factor not only
today, but throughout the season.
