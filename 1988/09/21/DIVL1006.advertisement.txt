38,000,000 Reasons Why Apple
Says Thank Yoi i to Stanford
Thank you, Stanford University students, faculty, and staff. Since Apple introduced the Macintosh computer through the
Apple University Consortium at Stanford, approximately 16<,Â©OjO Macs (including 1,100 Mac II's), have been purchased at
Stanford. The total investment by Stanford purchasers in Macintosh computers tops $38,000,000!! And the trend is rising
to even more spectacular heights - last year alone over 4,500 Mac Plus and SE computers and 920 Mac ll's were purchased
at Stanford.
It is indeed an understatement to say that Stanford has risen to ithe top of the world's finest academic institutions in
providing its community with the most advanced learning totals in history: Macintosh personal computers.
We like to think that Apple has contributed to this partnership!: we provide the lowest discounts for our equipment
available anywhere to Stanford; we have invested in Stanford's academic excellence through large donations; and of course,
we provide Macintosh: the computer that is the simplest in tlie world to learn, yet offers the ability to serve as a powerful
tool to help you do everything from writing and editing outlinies or term papers, to analyzing and graphing statistical or
financial data.
The best part of this partnership is that all the Mac's power is available at very affordable prices. If you'd like to learn about
the Macintosh, just look around: you'll see Mac's used in every school on campus, in every department, in public access
clusters, and in student residences.

Together we'll unleash the brightest of Poinds. And make an even brighter future.
