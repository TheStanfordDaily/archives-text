LAWRENCE CHU
♦ Gourmet Chinese
Chef Chu's, in the heart of the Peninsula's El Camino Real nightlife, is
a delightful blend of two atmospheres In the downstairs bar and dining
room, the mood is bustling, upbeat and fun, with an open kitchen adding
to the festive tone The upstairs dining room is more formal, with a
magnificent wood carving of The Nine Dragons, a replica of the one in
The Imperial ftdace of Beijing, China, covering an entire wall Chef Chu
is the author of the bestselling cookbook Chef Chu 's Distinctive Cuisine of
China, and is the guiding force behind this restaurant "To enjoy food,"
says Chu, "you must be relaxed, in a good mood and in the proper
atmosphere " Chu's spirit is everywhere he can be seen in the spotless
kitchen preparing Lover's Prawns for newlyweds, at an upstairs corner
table conversing with guests or 111 the lobby, scrawling a Chinese birthday
greeting on the signboard for an eighty-six-year-old guest Chef Chu is
frequently seen on television sharing his wok cooking skills, and is more
than happy to advise in menu planning The Sebastiani Sonoma County
Cabernet Sauvignon or a B V Los Carneros Chardonnay are appropriate
choices for Chef Chu's recipes
