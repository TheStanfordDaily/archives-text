The Only
Furniture Source
More Affordable
Than Gran Tree.
Okay, so you can barely afford a place of your
own. Let alone the furniture you need.
That doesn't have to mean decorating in early
"hand-me-down."
Gran Tree furniture rental offers everything
you need —living room, dining and bedroom
sets —in styles you'll love. At prices even a strug
gling student can live with, stalling as low as
$47.50 a month.
Stop by one of our showrooms today. It may
not be as inexpensive as shopping in the attic.
But we think you'll prefer the selection.
