Our engineers racked their brains so you won't have to.
We make
the simplest
typewriters
in memory.
We started out with a very sim
ple idea.
To make electronic typewriters
and word processors that have lots
of great features but are very simple
9 to use.
So simple you
don't have to keep
one eye on your
typing and one eye
on the instruction
manual.
So simple you
don't need a degree
in computer pro
gramming to operate them.
So simple they can even make
a confirmed non-typist comfortable
at the keyboard.
Call it human engineering if you
like. Or call it ergonomics. Or call it
plain old inspiration.
What we came up with is a
line of remarkable typewriters that
are sophisticated without being
complicated.
In fact, they're unlike any other
typewriters you've ever seen before...
or used before...or muttered at before.
Take our new Smith Corona
SD 700. (Lots of people are going to.)
We call the SD 700 the Memory
Typewriter. You just may call it the
simplest typewriter in memory.
It features a 7,000 character
editable memory you can access with
the mere flip of a switch.
Combined with the 16 character
LCD display, you can proofread, cor
rect and make changes before you
ever put anything down on paper.
Of course, should you want to

make changes on paper, we've made
that simpler than ever too.
On the SD 700, as well as on
every new Smith Corona typewriter,
you'll find our new correcting
cassette.
It's easy-to-load and you can
insert it in seconds.
There are no spools to
unwind. No complicated threading.
No tangles.
So now correcting mistakes
is as easy as making them.
We've reformed
the correction system.
Add features like a Spell-Right'"
50,000 word electronic dictionary,
Word Find,' Word Eraser," Full Line
Correction and much more and you've
got a typewriter that's not just incred
ibly simple to use. but simply impos
sible to pass up.
Of course, t he same goes for
every other Smith Corona typewriter
and word processor as well.
Which is why we
recommend that you
hurry to your nearest
store and try our
machines yourself.
Obviously, they
won't come to you.
Yet.
