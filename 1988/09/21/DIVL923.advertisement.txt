Casio solar scientific
calculators.
With these three calculators,
Casio continues to give students
and professionals the most features
and functions for the fewest dollars.
Lesson 1: Our FX-451M
gives you 132 total functions, includ
ingbinary, octal and hexadecimal
calculations and conversions. At
the touch of a key, it provides you
with 13 commonly used physical
constants like the speed of light,
Planck's constant and atomic mass.
It gives you 16 metric conversion
functions too, as well as a 10 digit
display with 10 digit mantissa plus 2
digit exponent for greater accuracy.
And because the fruits of your
hard work are worth saving, we've
added a feature called Solar Plus™.
Not only does it let you work in
low—or no—light situations, it keeps
the memory functioning, even with
the power off.
Lesson 2: Our less expen
sive FX-115N also features Solar
Plus and a 10 digit display with 10
digit mantissa plus 2 digit exponent.
It offers you 116 functions, includ
ing statistics and computer math
calculations, and it even calculates
fractions.
Both our FX-451M and
FX-115N come with a handy,
comprehensive application book.
Lesson 3: Our most eco
nomical solar scientific, the FX-300,
boasts 71 functions, an accurate 8
digit display, with 6 digit mantissa
plus 2 digit exponent. It features
statistics, permutations, combina
tions and convenient engineering
notation.
Before you take Science 1 or
1001, take a lesson in economics
from Casio's FX-451M, FX-115N,
and FX-300. You'll be amazed, not
just by how much they can do, but
by how little they'll do it for.
