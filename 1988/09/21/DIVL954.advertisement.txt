Free Hats!
That's right! You may have already won a Free Hat! of your very own from the
LELAND STANFORD JUNIOR UNIVERSITY MARCHING BAND
GIVEAWAY SWEEPSTAKES.
This handsomely styled headgear is suitable for football games, formal occasions and transporting fish. Yes, you'll cherish
your Free Hat! as a family heirloom to be passed from generation to.generation.
But this offer is good for a limited time only. To claim your Free Hat!, you must be prepared to play loud music, travel to
distant lands with merry musicians, and cavort like the dickens.
Oh yes, you also have to go to these things:
Thursday, Sept. 22 12:30 PM MEET THE BAND.
Ok, so you just arrived and haven't even had time to hang your posters. So what. Come on over
to the Shak*, meet the Band and play the loudest rock and roll that science can devise. Also, be sure
to sign up for Auditions, which are on Monday and Tuesday.
Friday, Sept. 23 12:30 PM MEET THE BAND SOME MORE.
(We're big. You probably didn't get to meet everyone yesterday.)
Get the horn. Learn the music. Ponder the humor.
Saturday, Sept. 24 9:00 AM FREE TRIP! TO GREAT AMERICA
H Play the music. Ride the rides. Eat the food. Have the fun.
«£ *
Monday and Ttiesday, Sept. 26-27 AUDITIONS
Be sure to sign up for these at some point before Monday (the sooner, the better). Band auditions
are as easy as puberty, but not as long.
*The Shak is conveniently located as far away as possible from where you live. Look at your map
(it's right next to Frost Amphitheatre). Better yet, ask your RA. Or call 723-4303.
