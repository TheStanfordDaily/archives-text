SOME PEOPLE WILL
SETTLE FOR NOTHING
BUT THE BEST.
They Live at Oak Creek.
"To tell the truth, the Health Club was one of the
main reasons I decided on Oak Creek.
"I've lived in this area for a long time, and
I've known about Oak Creek. When I looked at
it, it just hit the spot.
"The Health Club is right here... I don't have to
drive a million miles to work out. I knew wherever
I lived I'd have to join a health club. Here, I get
it for free, and it's really a nice one. Plus, I get
a great apartment in a fantastic setting."
