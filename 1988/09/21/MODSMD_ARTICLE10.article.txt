# Student inventor wins big

What happens when you put a carbon monoxide
tester together with the Westinghouse Science
Talent Search?
No, not another Ed McMahon televised special,
but the brainchild of Brian Hooker, a freshman
from Atlanta, Georgia.
Hooker placed ninth in a nationwide science
search by submitting a paper on his invention,
a portable device that measures the concentration
of carbon monoxide.
But winning took more than scientific know
how. Out of 16,000 entrants, Hooker was one of
40 students who flew to Washington, D.C. for a
round of intense interviews, one with Glenn
Seaborg, a Nobel Laureate from UC-Berkeley
who had helped design the first atomic bomb.
The search focused not only on projects but
on students' knowledge of all areas in science.
"I thought it was like a science fair. Instead, it
was the first time I was confronted with questions
I had to say 'I don't know' to," Hooker says of
the competition.
But the end of the contest was not the end of
the carbon monoxide tester. Now a portion of
Hooker's device is registered at the U.S. Patent
Office.
Despite his scientific success, Hooker is not the
type to lose himself in a lab doing research. Born
in Maryland, he has since lived in Georgia,
Arkansas, Pennsylvania and Illinois.
"Travelling has changed my life," says Hooker.
"I've lived in everything from a city of six million
to a city of 2,000. I've lived in an all-black town
and a town where I was the only black. I've been
rounded out."
According to Hooker, this sense of perspective
has helped with his role as vice president of the
National Association for the Advancement of

Colored People in Atlanta.
Hooker is busy with soccer as well. As starting
halfback his senior year, Hooker and his high
school team defeated the eight-year champions
in Atlanta.
But other trends were tougher for Hooker to
turn around. During his senior year he was pres
ident of what ho calls "a dormant" high school
student government and had to take action when
the school's principal decided to outlaw pep rallies.
"I saw there were a few problems between the
administration and the students. So I had to
strike a bargain. If students took up the trays
in the cafeteria, they'd have their pep rallies
back."
But with all these activities under his belt,
Hooker is ready to start things off at Stanford
with a clean slate. "I want to use Stanford for
as many things as I can get from it,"he says.
