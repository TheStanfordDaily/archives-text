## Archaeologist/actress joins National Forest Service 
### Laura Jacobson 
Freshman Leilah Powell didn't
have to open a textbook to learn
her American history.
Powell, a native of San Antonio,
Texas, spent two and a half
months of her senior year working
for the National Forest Service
researching the history of the Ute
Indians in an internship program
normally open only to college stu
dents.
Powell says she left for the in
ternship in Durango, Colorado
partly because she "didn't want
to spend another winter in Mas
sachusetts," where she attended
Phillips Andover Academy. But
she did much more than avoid
freezing Massachusetts winter
temperatures.
During her internship, Powell
looked for campsites of the Ute
Indians; searched the journals of
early settlers, trappers and
miners for mentions of the tribe;
identified the etymology of creek,
campsite and trade route names
of the area; and wrote a 40-page
paper on her findings, which was
presented in abstract to a
Colorado archeological conference.
And on weekends, when she
wasn't working, Powell learned
how to downhill ski.
The most difficult part of the
internship, Powell says, was read
justing to boarding school after
two and a half months in
Colorado. She describes the old
western town of Durango as a
place with "bare-brown trees" and
"bald eagles," a place "where
every pick-up truck had a dog in

the back."
In addition to an interest in
history and archeology, Powell
also has a passion for theater.
Since her sophomore year at An
dover, she has worked with the
theater as an actress, in produc
tion and, during her senior year,
as a director.
When Powell directed the play
"Shadow Box," by Michael Cris
tofer, she says her illusions of
having "total control of the cast
and doing everything right" were
shattered. She says the experience
taught her how to deal diplomati
cally with the actors on stage.

"I couldn't be incredibly force
ful and just say, 'Do it this way,' "
she says."I had to say to the
actors, 'You're on stage; tell me
how you feel."'
As a sophomore and junior,
Powell performed as Dotty Ottley
and Mrs. Clackett in "Noises Off,"
by Michael Frayn, as Babe in

"Crimes of the Heart" and in five
other shows. In addition, she was
stage manager for "Little Shop of
Horrors."
Powell comes to Stanford in the
footsteps of her older sister Laura
Powell, who will be a sophomore
this year.
Powell says she "loved" Stan
ford when she visited last Febru
ary and chose to come here pri
marily because the people were
"friendlier" than at Harvard.
"The question was not about
the caliber of education and the
academics, but about the atmos
phere and the surroundings and

where I was going to feel the most
comfortable," Powell explains.
"I wanted to go someplace
where I would enjoy the next four
years," she says, adding that she
is looking forward to Orientation
and "non-stop partying for five
days or so."
