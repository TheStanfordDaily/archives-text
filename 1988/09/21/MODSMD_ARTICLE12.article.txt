# Gearing up for hectic Orientation
## 
### Mica Martin 
Junior Tom McKean is looking forward to
classes starting so that he'll finally have
time to relax.
If McKean sounds a little out-of-the
ordinary, keep in mind that he is this year's
Orientation coodinator. All summer long he
has been gearing up for a six-day crash course
that will let more than 1,600 incoming fresh
men and transfer students know what Stan
ford's all about.
With a staff of 215 volunteers and 10 co
ordinators who oversee the varied aspects of
Orientation, McKean says he has learned the
ins and outs of University bureaucracy.
"I've learned how to deal with bureacracy
on a very large scale," says McKean." [Coor
dinating Orientation] seemed to encompass
everything I wanted to do," says the commu
nication and psychology major who is an aspir
ing film director.
One of McKean's primary goals for this
year's Orientation is for students to take part
in cultural events sponsored by the Universi
ty's different ethnic groups. In a joint effort,
the Asian American Students Association, the
Black Student Union, a Chicano/Latino stu
dent organization, the Stanford American In
dian Organization and the Council of Presi
dents will sponosor a multi-cultural celebra
tion that gives students a chance to learn
something about the University's ethnic com
munity. Scheduled for the evening of Sept.
26, the program called "The Fire Within" is
the first of its kind to be held during Orien
tation week.
Working all summer on an event that will
last less than a week stirs up some anxieties,
McKean admits. Despite his lengthy planning,
he says there are two potential problems which

could put a damper on this year's Orientation.
He notes that the tension between unionized
Stanford workers and the University's admin
istration has him nervous because a strike
would disrupt the smooth flow of Orientation.
"A strike by University workers would cause
some problems, but we could work around
it,"he says.
Not so negotiable would be the presence of
rain. "Considering that it hasn't rained practi
cally all year, it is kind of unlikely, but the
thought of rain is always in the back of my

mind," he says.
Although the main goal of Orientation is to
introduce students to the University, academic
resources as well as the physical surroundings,
McKean believes it is also important that
freshmen relax and have fun. "The mood we
set should not be entirely serious," he says.
Most importantly, McKean hopes Orienta
tion will give new students a glimpse of every
thing the University has to offer. "I want the
freshmen to see that Stanford is a very diverse
institution.
