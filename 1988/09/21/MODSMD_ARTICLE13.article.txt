# Beating the odds
## Admissions competition stiff as ever 
### Kathy Lachenauer 
Now that they have safely ar
rived on the Farm, Stanford's
1,602 freshmen are quickly for
getting those gruelling applica
tions, stressful SAT exams and
ever-so-painful class rankings
that helped get them here. But
maybe they'd like to take one
last look back to those stressful
moments just to see what they
were up against.
Of Stanford's 15,828 appli
cants, 3,103 had 4.0 grade point
averages. More than 9,800 were
in the top 10 percent of their
graduating class and 2,650 of
them had combined SAT test
scores of 1400 or above.
Despite the impressively high
number of qualified applicants,
Stanford could only offer admis
sions to 2,524 of them, 16 per
cent of the total group. Of the
applicants offered admissions,
64 percent choose the Farm â€”
a four percent increase over last
year.
On a down note, of the 922
who were offered admission to
Stanford but opted for another
school, 50 percent selected Har
vard, Yale, Princeton or MIT.
Stanford's only net loss of fresh

man was to Harvard.
For the 1,602 students who
made the right choice, 55 per
cent are men and 45 percent are
women. North Dakota is the
odd-state-out in this year's
freshman class; every other
state has at least one resident
enrolling this fall. California
again tops the list for greatest
state representation, with 33
percent of the freshmen from
the Golden State.
The class of '92 has an inter
national flair as well. Freshman
from as far way as Hungary
and Hong Kong have decided to
venture out to Stanford this fall;
and 44 students enrolling are
citizens of foreign countries.
A greater number of black and
Chicano students enrolled this
year than last. This year, the
precentages of enrolling black
and Chicano increased from 8.2
percent to 10.1. And nearly 16
percent of this year's class is
Asian American.
In addition to the freshmen,
77 transfer students are also en
rolling here this fall. Their com
petition to get in was just as
stiff. Of the 1,211 transfer ap
plicants, only 8 percent were of
fered admission.
