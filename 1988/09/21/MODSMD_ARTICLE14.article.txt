# Cozy dormitory living, there's no place like home
## 
### Jennifer Cotteleer 
As freshmen start settling into their cozy
new rooms, they might want to learn a little
about what it took finding them a home-away
from-home.
This year's "unusually large" freshman
class has tested the talents of Stanford's
Housing Center staff, according to Bill
Georges, assistant director of the Housing
Center. The class of '92 has 1630 students,
110 more students than last year's class.
Finding housing for such a large class was

complicated by the closing of Roble Hall, a
70-year-old dorm that houses 294 residents.
Last December, Roble was shut down after
the building was found to be seismically un
safe.
"We've held back more spaces for freshmen
than usual this year" said senior Anne Hick
ling, one of two students responsible for co
ordinating freshmen room assignments. All of
these extra spaces have been held back in
dorms that traditionally house freshmen.
Branner Hall, housing 171 students, still
tops the list as the largest all-freshmen dorm.

With Roble out of commission for this year,
Toyon Hall now houses the most residents,
218 of them.
In Branner and Toyon, most of the rooms
are two-room triples, three people live in two
rooms. There are five two-room quads in Bran
ner, four are all-male and the fifth is all
female. There are also a few scattered singles
in Branner. Freshmen in most other dorms
will be living in one-room doubles, Hickling
said.
Freshmen will also be living in one of
Toyon's three "new" quads. These large rooms
that sleep four used to be dorm study rooms
but were put back into service this year be
cause of Roble's closure.
A total of 150 freshmen who indicated a
preference for a theme house will be living in
one of three cross-cultural theme houses, Casa
Zapata, Ujamaa or Okada.
If freshmen did not luck out and receive
their first choice of housing, they can request
reassignment, according to Georges. Noting
that "part of the residential experience is to
get along," he said there are very few com
plaints from students.
Freshmen were not the only students
Georges' staff was looking out for this sum
mer. He explained that all undergraduates
and graduates who requested University
housing and were willing to live anywhere on
campus have found a spot.
"This is the first time we have been able
to accommodate all undergraduates and grad
uates on the waiting list who would live
anywhere on campus. It's the first time in
both cases this has happened," Georges said.
He noted that this year's opening of Raines
apartments, which will house 780 graduate
students, provided some much needed extra
space. With graduate students moving into
Raines, some one-bedroom apartments in Es
condido Village as well as some units in Croth
ers and Crothers Memorial are now available
for undergraduates. "These spaces have been
filled with undergraduates who were on the
waiting list," he said.
