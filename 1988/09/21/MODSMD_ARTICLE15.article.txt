# Random roomies?
## Having some fun with the matchups

The Housing Center staff as
sures us that all of their effort
goes into matching roommates
based solely on what they have
to offer each other.
In spite of their claims, how
ever, rumors indicate that the
Housing staff is only human
after all, and given to moments
of capriciousness like anyone
else.
Several "coincidences" came
up in a conversation among
past Stanford dorm residents:
* Gillman, Salmon and Fisher
got along swimmingly together
in their triple three years ago.
Something smell fishy?
• Gospel lovers rejoiced when
Matthew, Mark, Luke and

John gathered together in a
quad.
• "Is John there?" Usually,
there were four in this quad.
• Hallmates were after Rock
and Roll to turn it down in
their double.
Betsy Wallace, one of this
year's freshmen information
coordinators said that she
wouldn't confirm any acts of
this nature in the matching of
roommates this year.
The unavailability of Roble
Hall as a residence this year
may have decreased the
likelihood of nominally
matched roommates. Wallace
noted that Roble used to be a
popular dorm for fun with
roommate names because of
the large number of quads.
Time will tell.
