# The 						luck of the Draw means good housing at Stanford
## 
### 
Every spring quarter, in the
midst of great weather and care
free schedules, Stanford students
must face the annual housing
draw.
The mere mention of "the
Draw," causes students discom
fort, elliciting grimaces and rolled
eyes.
The reason, for this is simple:
there is not enough on-campus
housing to go around.
The Draw looms nebulously as
a mysterious rumor throughout a
student's first year. In May, it
quickly materializes into a major
topic of conversation and a sched
uling problem, as students scout
out and decide the lots they will
cast in the housing lottery.
The Draw is a game of roulette
in which residences take on num
bers and students' housing is left
to luck. Students elect to live with
a group of up to eight friends,
and submit their names together
with an ordered list of housing
choices and priorities given by
campus residences weeks before
the Draw. Then, in one fateful
moment, a brave member of the
group picks a slip of paper with
a number on it out of a box.

The numbers range from one
to 3000 for guaranteed students,
and over 3000 for unguaranteed
students, who draw from a differ
ent pool. The number a group
draws determines which residen
ces they can get into. The lower
the number the better the chance
to live where one wants. The most
popular houses wind up with the
lowest cut-off numbers.
The University last spring elim
inated the previous policy of re
turning residence priority, which
guaranteed a place to any student
wishing to live in the same resi
dence the following year, without
going through the Draw. Many
argued that this practice was as
unfair as if the state lottery gave
the lucky winner both the prize
and the numbers to the next
week's jackpot.
The housing crunch at Stanford
has beset the University for
decades. "The demand for housing
has always exceeded supply," said
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Roger Whitney, who is also direc
tor of the Housing Center. But
never has the problem been as
acute as in the past two decades.
In 1968, there were 300 stu

dents on the waiting list for
campus housing after the second
round of the draw. By 1972, that
number had climbed to over 700.
What created this sharp in
crease in the demand for on
campus housing?
"Basically, it was two factors,"
Whitney said. "First of all, the
cost of off-campus housing rose
considerably. Second, on-campus
housing became more desireable."
Average rent in Palo .Alto
skyrocketed in the early 19705,
when a University study showed
there was only one apartment
available at a price close to the
cost of on-campus housing. In
recent years, it has become almost
impossible to find affordable
apartments.
In response to the increasing
cost of off-campus housing during
the late 19605, campus attention
focused on changing the Univer
sity residential-life system.
The residential program based
on the recommendations estab
lished the student housing draw
as we know it today.
The Draw in 1968 resembled
the present one in all but a few
ways.

No more than three students
were allowed to draw together,
while now up to eight students
can draw as a group and all draw
partners had to be of the same
sex. Also at that time, students
were only guaranteed housing
their first year.
In 1974 the Trustees estab
lished the current policy, guaran
teeing students three years of on
campus housing. The computer
program, used by the Housing
Center to assign residences, was
created that year, as well.
With the creation of academic
and ethnic theme houses in 1981
and the completion of Governor's
Corner the next year, the Draw
was again modified.
According to Whitney, the next
major change in the Draw will be
extending the housing guarantee
to include all four years of un
dergraduate study. However, that
won't happen until adequate new
housing is built, and that may be
in several years.
The infamous Draw appears to
be here to stay, adding anxiety or
excitement — depending on your
luck — to the placid days of spring
quarter.
