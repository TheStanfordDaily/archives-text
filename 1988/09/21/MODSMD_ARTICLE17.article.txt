# Pumping some life into aging Tresidder Union
## 
### Laura Jacobson 
With mushroom olive pizza,
chocolate peanut butter frozen yo
gurt and a late-night munchie
store, Tresidder Union satisfies
many a hungry stomach. But
Tresidder, the student center
named after the fourth president
of Stanford, does not just cater
to the hungry.
Tired of industrial-strength
dormitory dryers, some students
haul their dirty laundry to a dry
cleaning service there. Other stu

dents go to Tresidder for legal
advice, class lecture notes, a game
of pinball or a cup of capuccino.
Despite its array of services, the
26-year-old student center should
be looking bigger and better by
next spring, according to Paul
Szczesiul, associate director of
Tresidder.
Now undergoing major renova
tions, Tresidder will soon have a
new $2 million complex. Calling
Tresidder "a tired building,"
Szczesiul said he hopes the 8,000-
square-foot addition will "pump

some life into it." He added that
an entirely different Tresidder is
in store for the incoming fresh
men class.
"By the time this year's fresh
men enter and graduate, it will
be an entirely different btiilding,"
he said.
In keeping with the building's
present look, the new complex will
mostly be wooden with diamond
shaped concrete columns. A cov
ered walkway will surround the
entire building. And, like most of
Stanford's buildings, the roof will

be red-tiled. One noticable differ
ence will be a tower, to be built
on the Coffee House's outside
patio, that will house a public
access elevator and have a clock
on the outside.
Over the summer, Tresidder's
second-floor patio was de
molished. The new complex, to be
built in place of the patio, is start
ing to take shape. The steel
framed skeleton of the complex
should be up by October, Szczesiul
said.
By next summer, many of Tres
idder's facilities will be relocated.
For instance, a student computer
center known as LOTS and the
Computer Science Department
will both be located in the new
complex. The Coffee House will
move into the current LOTS
building. In addition, the Store
will take over the Coffee House's
spot.
The construction work should
cause "no major disruptions" over
the year, Szczesiul said, adding
that all food areas will be "open
and operating" and that "none of
the existing services will be shut
down."
The "masterplan" for the new
Coffee House, drawn-up by Food
Service consultants, will describe
its "new generation" and should
be completed by the end of fall
quarter, he said.
