# Grads join undergrads as rookies
## Law School applicants up 20 percent to record number, Med School drops 
### Tim Marklein 
Freshmen will not be the only
new Stanfordites wandering aim
lessly around campus these
weeks. Hundreds of first-year
graduate students will join the
1,602 frosh in their search for
shorter routes to the Bookstore,
the Coffee House and Roble Gym.
First-year Business School stu
dents will number approximately
330, Law School rookies total 170
and beginning Medical School
matriculants count 86. Statistics
were only available for those three
graduate schools.
The numbers of entering grad
uate students are not in them
selves revealing, as pre-set target
amounts are always met. How
ever, the number of applicants
reveal a trend — followed nation
ally — of decreasing medical
school applicants and rising law
school hopefuls.
A total of 3,942 applicants ap
plied to Stanford's Medical School,
a drop of 6 percent over last year.
Gloria Pyszka, the school's assis
tant director of admissions, said
the lower numbers follow a na
tional decrease of about 5 percent.
She added that the figure is
"skewed," since many areas have

lost an even greater number of
applicants.
"We expect (another) decline
next year," Pyszka said, adding
that a number of different factors
have contributed to the lower fig
ures.
Law schools have apparently
been the benefactors, as the num
ber of applications received by
Stanford's Law School swelled by
the national figure of 20 percent.
A record high number of 4,737
applicants was whittled down to
the target enrollee number of 170.
Dora Hjertberg, the school's di
rector of admissions and financial
aid, said most projections show
another increase of 20 percent
next year.
Hjertberg said reasons for the
trends are difficult to pinpoint.
"It could be anything from people
watching L.A. Law to the Bork
hearings," she said, adding that
last year's stock market crash
may have disillusioned a number
of prospective business hopefuls.
Despite the crash, applications
for Stanford's Business School did
not suffer. This year's pool of
4,354 was actually up 137 over
last year. The rise restored the
school's numbers back to normal,
after a low of 3,837 in 1986.

According to Bruce Paton, di
rector of admissions for the
M.B.A. program, application
counts have "bounced around for
several years."
Despite the trends in numbers
of applicants, admissions officials
from all three schools said they
look forward to a diverse graduate
student body.
At the Medical School 34 women
and 52 men were chosen from an
applicant pool of 2,544 men and
1,388 women.
Pyszka said minority student
numbers are "up from last year"
thanks to a "very successful
recruitment year — minorities
and non-minorities." The class in
cludes eight black, 11
Chicano/Latino, three Native
American and 17 Asian-American
students.
The average age in the class is
22.
The first-year Law School class
includes 104 men and 66 women
(31 percent). There were 2,923
male applicants; and female ap
plicants totalled 1,814 (38 per
cent).
Minority totals are also higher
in the Law School this year, ac
cording to Hjertberg. "More active
recruiting helped us," he said. The

class includes 15 black, 19
Chicano/Latino, four Native
American, two Puerto Rican and
10 Asian-American students.
Another Law School pattern is
a rise in age and work experience
of the entering class.
The average age of a Law School
student is 25.4 — "higher than
it's ever been before" — with 27
students age 30 and over,
Hjertberg said.
Statistics for the Business
School are only estimates, Paton
said, since the class has not ac
tually arrived.
However, Paton could project
"a slight decline" in the number
of female enrollees to just under
25 percent. Minority representa
tion is also normally low, as only
an estimated 12.5 percent will
make up the class, including
Asian-American students.
The low female and minority
numbers "roughly reflect what's
going on in our applicant pool,"
according to Paton. In the case
of minorities, he added, "We have
had a problem in finding numbers
of candidates to meet our
criteria."
Business School students are
traditionally older, an average of
27.8-years-old last year.

last year's stock market crash
may have disillusioned a number
of prospective business hopefuls.
Despite the crash, applications
for Stanford's Business School did
not suffer. This year's pool of
4,354 was actually up 137 over
last year. The rise restored the
school's numbers back to normal,
after a low of 3,837 in 1986.

According to Bruce Paton, di
rector of admissions for the
M.B.A. program, application
counts have "bounced around for
several years."
Despite the trends in numbers
of applicants, admissions officials
from all three schools said they
look forward to a diverse graduate
student body.
At the Medical School 34 women
and 52 men were chosen from an
applicant pool of 2,544 men and
1,388 women.
Pyszka said minority student
numbers are "up from last year"
thanks to a "very successful
recruitment year — minorities
and non-minorities." The class in
cludes eight black, 11
Chicano/Latino, three Native
American and 17 Asian-American
students.
The average age in the class is
22.
The first-year Law School class
includes 104 men and 66 women
(31 percent). There were 2,923
male applicants; and female ap
plicants totalled 1,814 (38 per
cent).
Minority totals are also higher
in the Law School this year, ac
cording to Hjertberg. "More active
recruiting helped us," he said. The

class includes 15 black, 19
Chicano/Latino, four Native
American, two Puerto Rican and
10 Asian-American students.
Another Law School pattern is
a rise in age and work experience
of the entering class.
The average age of a Law School
student is 25.4 — "higher than
it's ever been before" — with 27
students age 30 and over,
Hjertberg said.
Statistics for the Business
School are only estimates, Paton
said, since the class has not ac
tually arrived.
However, Paton could project
"a slight decline" in the number
of female enrollees to just under
25 percent. Minority representa
tion is also normally low, as only
an estimated 12.5 percent will
make up the class, including
Asian-American students.
The low female and minority
numbers "roughly reflect what's
going on in our applicant pool,"
according to Paton. In the case
of minorities, he added, "We have
had a problem in finding numbers
of candidates to meet our
criteria."
Business School students are
traditionally older, an average of
27.8-years-old last year.
