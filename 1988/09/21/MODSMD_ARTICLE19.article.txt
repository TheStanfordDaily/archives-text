# Hot gases are grad's bag

### Mike Horelick 
Graduate student
Russ Hamilton has
his hands full.
In addition to
caring for his two
children, with his
wife's help, the 27-
year-old Chicago
astronomer is
trying to complete
his Ph.D. thesis that

explains radio emissions from astrop
hysical plasma.
Hamilton, who studies the theoretical
side of astronomy, has been researching
the emissions of hot gases surrounding
stars such as the sun. He admits that
he is one of "only a handful" of re
searchers in the world working in this
unique area.
Hamilton's curiosity about the un
known isn't exactly new. His love for

astronomy started when he was 7 years
old and was fascinated with NASA's
space program. Some things never
change â€” Hamilton freely admits that
he would suspend his current research
for a chance to ride the space shuttle.
After graduating from the University
of Illinois with a degree in physics,
Hamilton applied to and was accepted
by five universities for graduate study
in astronomy.
Although his first choice was initially
Princeton, he changed his mind after a
visit to the New Jersey campus.
"(Princeton) was very dreary and too
boring," he says.
His second choice was UC-Berkeley,
but he had second thoughts after he had
trouble finding housing.
So now he's at Stanford. He heard
nothing but good things from a friend
in the graduate physics program, Hamil
ton says, adding that he believes that
Stanford's faculty is first-rate.
