# Applicant's timing: poetry in motion

Jessie Kuhn considers herself lucky.
In the final year that the program
was admitting applicants, she was one
of only two students accepted into Stan
ford's masters program in poetry.
Lucky, too, because Stanford was the
only school to which she applied.
Kuhn, a native of Boston, majored i..
comparative literature at Oberlin Col
lege in Ohio. Her thesis was not in
poetry but in translation — she trans
lated the works of poets Miguel Her
nandez and Luiz Fernuda from Spanish
to English.
After graduation, Kuhn taught jour
nalism and poetry to junior high school
students. It was then, among the am
bitious young writers, that she decided
to become a poet. "I envied my students
because they were writing with great
delight," she says.
Finally, four years after graduation,
she applied to the masters program in
poetry. Despite the intense competition

'I can't be treated as a number with
only two people in my class.'
— Jessie Kuhn

— there were 80 applicants for four
positions in 1987 — she was accepted.
Kuhn, forgetting that this was the final
year for acceptance into the program,
figured that if she were rejected she
would "just apply again." Fortunately,
her portfolio, statement of purpose and
recommendations impressed the admis
sions committee enough to give her a
space in the final class.
Unlike the more generous Stegner
Fellowship which gives writers a
stipend, the University only pays for
Kuhn's tuition.

Kuhn says there were many pluses
about coming Stanford. Her husband
attends Stanford Medical School, she
likes the faculty of the department and
a small class size allows for plenty of
personal attention.
"I can't be treated as a number with
only two people in my class," Kuhn
explains.
The aspiring poet, who loves the
Welsh writer Dylan Thomas as much
as she loathes Irish poet William Yeats,
hopes to get her work published after
completing the two-year program.
