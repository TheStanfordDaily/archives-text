# Something new after 20 years
## Career journalist looks for 'second act' to his life 
### Laura Jacobson 
A journalist who began writing
20 years ago as a correspondent
in Vietnam, went on to write for
the New York Times and to serve
on the editorial board of the Los
Angeles Times, Lee Dembart is
now back in the classroom at
Stanford Law School.
The 42-year-old New York na
tive, who moved to Los Angeles
in 1980, says he has been inter
ested in law since his freshman
year at Queens College, New York.
That was 26 years ago.
Now after 20 years in jour
nalism, Dembart, who is not
married and has no children, says
he wants "a second act to my
life." Rather than continue the
"safe and secure" path of jour
nalism, he wants to "see what
else is out there." He sees law as
one possibility.
"I'm 42, and I don't know what
I want to do when I grow up,"
he says, laughing.
Dembart sees Law School as a
"voyage of discovery" during
which he may find an answer. "I

I'm 42, and I don't
know what I want to
do when I grow up.'

expect to discover things here in
the next three years that will wind
up being of great interest to me,"
he says.
Even in his undergraduate
days, Dembart altered his future
plans, beginning as a chemistry
major and finally settling on phi
losophy. He started his career in
journalism — writing for his col
lege newspaper in Queens — only
because his friends worked for the
paper.
The publication chose Dembart
to be one of its two student cor
respondents in Vietnam. One was
a hawk, a pro-war type, and Dem
bart was the dove, the anti-war
reporter.
Arriving in Vietnam the day of
the Tet offensive, Dembart stayed

until July. During that time, he
interviewed Gls and researched
the widespread use of drugs
among Americans in Vietnam. He
says he wrote the first "dispas
sionate and believable account" of
the drug problem, and the article
was circulated in the Associate
Press.
T .. article won him an imme
diate position at the New York
Post in 1968. In 1972, he moved
to the New York Times as a copy
editor, later becoming a political
writer and City Hall bureau chief.
Seven years later, he switched
coasts to become an editorial
board member at the Los Angeles
Times. He has been there for the
last nine years, writing articles
and book reviews which focus on
issues in science and law.
As the legal affairs writer for
the LA Times, Dembart focused
on the areas of constitutional law
and civil liberties, two areas he
especially wants to pursue here
at Law School.
Dembart will continue sending in
one book review a week to the
Los Angeles Times.
