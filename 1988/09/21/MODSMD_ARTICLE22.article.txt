# An artificially intelligent lawyer?
## 
### Jennifer Cotteleer 
For many people, one career
is enough. But for Dr. Rachel
Adar, one is just a beginning.
Adar enters Stanford Law
School this fall, while continuing
her work as a consultant in the
field of Artificial Intelligence.
A native New Yorker, Adar
started her college career by
earning a degree in computer
science from the City College of
New York. She followed up with
a masters and a doctorate at
Harvard in Applied Mathemat
ics and Physics.
Between stints at Harvard,
Adar worked in Israel as a sys
tems analyst and in Switzerland
as a researcher at the Institute
for Semantic and Cognitive Sci
ence.
In 1981, Adar moved to San
Diego to teach computer science
at UC-San Diego on a National
Science Foundation grant.
Three years later, she moved
into industry as a technical staff
member working on AI. In 1986,
she started her own consulting
firm, AI Technologies.

While in San
Diego she found
time to write a
book, "Getting
Computers to
Talk Like You
and Me,"
worked as a vol
unteer preg
nancy coun
s e 1 or at

Planned Parenthood, renovated
a house and managed to hand
raise four malnourished kittens.
Two of the kittens are perma
nent companions today.
Now, even as she attends the
Law School, she will keep up
her independent consulting
work and continue giving semi
nars around the country on the
use of "expert systems," an ap
plication of artificial intelligence
technology. Adar also persists in
her research toward more effec
tive human machine interface
design.
Since her thesis work at Har
vard, Adar's main focus has
been natural language process
ing.
Initially, it may seem that law

school is a departure from her
current career. However, Adar
feels that law, like her work in
natural language, is a verbal dis
cipline. Adar stresses that her
primary reason for attending
Stanford Law School is for the
"intellectual pursuit. I'm really
here for the process," she says.

Adar feels that law,
like her work in natu
ral language, is a ver
bal discipline.

She admits to the possibility
of combining law and AI, but
makes it clear,, that she is not
"limiting" herself at this point.
"I'd like to keep my options
open," she says.
After attending the Law
School's orientation, Adar says
she was "super-impressed" with
the people she had met so far
and is looking forward to work
ing with people who are more
interested in learning than in
trying to prove something.
