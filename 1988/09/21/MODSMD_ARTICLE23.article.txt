# Ethnic dean fosters community spirit for minorities

Saying goodbye to Mom, Dad
and long-time friends is tough.
But the trip to college is even
rougher if it involves breaking cul
tural ties. -
Asst. Dean of Student Affairs
Julian Low is one of several ethnic
deans on campus that refuse to
let students forget their cultural
heritage and get lost in the crowd.
Stanford's four ethnic deans
represent the black, Chicano/
Latino, Native American and
Asian-American communities
here. And over the summer, stu
dent leaders from these various
communities called on the Uni
versity to increase the deans' roles
to full-time positions.
Recently, Low's job was in
creased from a one-quarter to
three-quarter time position, al
lowing him more time to dedicate
to the Asian-American communi

ty. He hopes to be a full-time dean
by next year.
Also serving as director of the
Asian-American Cultural Center,
Low says he hopes to foster sup
port for Asian-American students
who feel pressure to assimilate
here.
"It is a difficult challenge to
help them accept who they are
and show them they can be Asian
American as well as part of the
larger community," he says.

According to Low, the pressure
for minority students to assimilate
is more intense at Stanford than
at UC-Berkeley. A Berkeley grad
uate himself, Low says the com
munity here tends to be more
homogeneous than at his alma
mater. Consequently, he says he
is concerned that Asian-
Americans may be inhibited in ex
pressing the difficulties they face
as minorities.
"A lot of the students that are

here, their identity with being
Asian-American is not always that
strong," Low says, adding that he
hopes to foster an Asian-American
community within Stanford that
will help students feel comfortable
with their background.
He goes on to point out that
he is not looking to create a
separatist community but a multi
cultural one. "It's about accepting
rights and respecting cultures,"
Low says of the community.

Low says he is pleased by the
high number of Asian-American
students who are involving them
selves in the community. "It's the
highest number (of students) in
a long time," he notes.
When Low is not busy organ
izing community events he is
working with individual Asian-
Americans who need some extra
guidance or academic advice.
Another priority high on Low's
agenda is helping University
leaders and faculty members "be
come more aware of cultural dif
ferences" and more sensitive to
student's with special needs. Low
says he would like to "expose stu
dents to possibilities other than
just the hard sciences and engi
neering."
"I would like students to explore
all the different opportunities they
have — writing, art, film, music
— so they can see what they
might want to focus on," he says.
