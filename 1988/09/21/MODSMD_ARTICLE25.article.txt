# Acclaimed concert pianist among transfer students
## 
### Jock Friedly 
When transfer student Jon
Nakamatsu played with a small
electric organ at age 4, he prob
ably could not imagine his child
hood fun would lead him to critical
acclaim as a concert pianist.
After switching to a real piano
from his electric organ at age 6,
San Jose's Nakamatsu soon
showed his true talent as a pianist.
Over the past 10 years, the Stan
ford sophomore has won numer
ous awards, appeared on televi
sion and radio and drawn rave
reviews.
For the 20-year-old transfer
student from Foothill College, this
early recognition is the first step
towards becoming a professional
concert pianist.
In addition to winning numer
ous other awards, Nakamatsu was
the winner of the San Francisco
Young Pianist' competition in
1985 and also the San Jose Young
Artist Competition in 1986.

As a result of winning the
Young Musician Award in 1986,
which was sponsored by the San
Francisco Symphony, Nakamatsu
performed Saint-Saens' Piano
Concerto #2 with the San Fran
cisco Youth Orchestra in the city's
Davies Symphony Hall.
Nakamatsu has been inter
viewed by several San Francisco
radio stations and received praise
from critics in various Bay Area

papers. One critic in the San
Francisco Examiner called
Nakamatsu "a knockout" and an
"expressive, thoughtful musician
with a fluid technique and fine
sense of style."
Nakamatsu has also appeared
on cable television. In 1987 and
again this year, he performed on
a one-hour television show
devoted entirely to him.
Nakamatsu favors music from

the Romantic Era, the 19th cen
tury period of music from Bee
thoven to Mahler. His favorites
include Schumann and Rach
maninoff.
Nakamatsu dabbles in compo
sition and flies to Los Angeles
every month to study composition
with Prof. Leonard Stein of the
University of Southern California.
He is currently writing a piano
concerto.

While at Stanford, Nakamatsu
will continue to study with Sun
nyvale's Marina Derryberry.
For Nakamatsu, Stanford offers
a chance to pursue areas besides
music. He plans to msyor in Ger
man Studies. Although his life's
ambition is to be a concert pianist,
NakcuiiaLau says his main priority
at Stanford will be academics, not
music.
"I've always thought it was im
portant to have a broad education
and I knew that Stanford was the
place for that," Nakamatsu says.
Nakamatsu says his ac
ademic interest is German, but
he also is interested in studying
other languages. He speaks
French and plans to learn Chinese
and Russian.
Besides tennis and swimming,
Nakamatsu has another interest
that he says most people think
borders on the bizarre: grammar.
"I must be kind of weird,"
Nakamatsu said. "Everyone else
hates grammar. I kind of like it."
