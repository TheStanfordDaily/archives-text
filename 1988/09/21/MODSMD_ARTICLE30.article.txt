# Defense to carry the Cardinal in 1988
## Johnson leads a revamped offense 
### Chris Crader 
Reviving memories of bygone
winning seasons, the Cardinal
football team got its 1988 season
off to a good, albeit not great,
start last week.
Picked seventh or eighth in the
Pacific 10 Conference in most
preseason polls, Stanford gave the
sixth-ranked USC Trojans every
thing they could handle before
falling 24-20 on a touchdown with
1 minute, 19 seconds left in the
game. Coming off a 5-6 1987 cam-
Daign, the Cardinal has high hopes
J*to bounce back into the top half
<Jof the Pac-10 and perhaps even
J\think of a possible bowl berth
Respite the nation's 15th-toughest
♦^schedule.
"There's a heck of a lot more
-balance in the Pac-10 than there
■>Jwas 10 years ago," Coach Jack
\jElway said. "Weekend-in and
Vveekend-out I think it's the
toughest conference in the na
tion."
Elway has been proved correct
so far this season as the Pac-10
is 11-0 against non-conference
foes through the first two weeks
of the season. The bad news for
Elway is that his Cardinal plays
eight more Pac-10 teams this
year. And Stanford plays 11th
ranked Notre Dame and San Jose
State (10-2 last year) in non
league match-ups.
The key for this year's Cardinal
is the new run-and-shoot offense.
The offense uses four wide
receivers and only one running
back in most situations and is
predicated on having the receivers
read the defense and run their
pass routes accordingly.
An advantage is that it takes
some of the pressure off the of
fensive line. That line sould be
the strength of the Cardinal this
season, anyway, as all seven
players who started at least one
game last season return. The
line's best player is center Andy
Sinclair, a senior who has started

ail 35 games played during his
time on the Farm.
"I don't have to think as much
(in the run-and-shoot), which is
a good start," Sinclair said with
a laugh. "We can do a lot from
it. I think it's going to be hard
to defend. It's taken a lot of pres
sure off the offensive line and put
more on the receivers . . . and of
course the quarterback."
Keying the offense will be junior
quarterback Brian Johnson. The
starting leftfielder on the NCAA
Champion Stanford nine won the
starting job over sophomore Jason
Palumbis and played well against
the Trojans before being knocked
out of the game by USC corner
back Chris Hale midway through
the fourth quarter.
Johnson was 18 for 28 for 176
yards, two touchdowns and no in
terceptions. He missed practice
last Monday but resumed work
outs on Tuesday.
"I felt like he'd played an ex
cellent game, right after the (USC)
game," Elway said. "When I saw
the film I was even more im
pressed with his play."
The lone back in the offense is
junior Jon Volpe, who had 24
rushes and seven receptions
against the Trojans, totaling 129
yards. The 5-foot-7 speedster will
likely be the prime element of the
Stanford ground attack, while
sophomore Walter Batson and
junior Ed McCaffrey lead the deep
corps of receivers.
"We have a real good chance to
be an improved offensive football
team," Elway said before the start
of the season. "We have experi
ence in the offensive line. . . . Wal
ter Batson has got blinding speed
. . . McCaffrey is an excellent ath
lete."
The biggest problem Elway saw
with the offense was its perform
ance on short-yardage plays, but
he feels the team can improve
greatly there. Citing a lack of
depth at the tight end and run
ning back positions due to inju

ries, Elway said he didn't have
the personnel to run the type of
plays he wanted to.
Defensively, Stanford is in good
shape. The team will be led by
All-America-candidate linemen
Lester Archambeau and Ray
Huckestein. Archambeau, a senior
and the team's left tackle, dropped
two Trojans behind the line of
scrimmage and had eight tackles
overall. Huckestein, a senior
noseguard, tallied seven.
The inside linebacking corps is
also very strong with junior Jono
Tunney and senior Kevin Rich
ardson starting, and former
starter Barry McKeever serving
as a very qualified backup.
Senior Alan Grant and sopho
more Kevin Scott both return to
the cornerback positions where
they were starters most of last
year, and senior Rob Englehardt
has already established a name
for himself by picking off two Rod
ney Peete passes in the opener.
"Defensively we played ex
tremely well (against USC)," El
way said. "I think we have an
opportunity to continue to im
prove and be a great defensive
team."
Overall, the toughest task for
the Cardinal at the moment may
be to realize the positive signifi
cance of the narrow defeat, in
stead of dwelling on should'ves
and could'ves.
"It was an unfortunate loss, one
we would have loved to win," El
way said. "[But] it's onward and
upward from here."
McKeever, a fifth-year senior,
agreed on the meaning of the USC
game. "I think it was a big game
for us on Saturday," he said. "I
think we're going to get a lot bet
ter. ... I think we played well
against USC, but I think we can
get a lot better."
Once the team realizes that it
takes a pretty good team to give
the sixth-ranked team in the
country a great run for its money,
the 1988 Cardinal could go places.

Stanford defensive tackle Lester Archambeau, 72, and linebacker Rob Hinckley, 43, try to recover a
fumble by USC's Rodney Peete Sept. 10. Peete saved both the fumble and the game for the Trojans,
passing for the winning TD with 1:19 left in the contest.
