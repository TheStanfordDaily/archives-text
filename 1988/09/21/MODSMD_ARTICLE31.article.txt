# Bruins favored in Pac-10
## 
### Chris Crader 
As Stanford opens its 1988 season in
the rugged Pacific 10 Conference, one
thing is certain. The Cardinal is going
to play a lot of good teams. In addition
to non-league foes such as Notre Dame,
the Cardinal, as always, will be sternly
tested in each of its eight remaining
Pac-10 games.
While the Southeast Conference is
widely held to be the best in the land,
top-to-bottom, the Pac-10 ranks right
up there. The most recent proof of this
comes with the news that perennial Pac
-10 doormat Washington State buried
Big Ten schools Illinois, 44-7 at Illinois,
and Minnesota, 41-9 at Minnesota. In
fact, through two weeks of play, the
Pac-10 currently has an 11-0 record in
non-conference games. Here is a run
down of the conference from Rose Bowl
contenders USC and UCIA on down:
UCLA (2-0 overall, 0-0 in the Pac-10)
The second-ranked Bruins thought
they had a Rose Bowl bid locked up
last year but USC came back with two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter to
win the L.A. city championship, and the
Pac-10, in the regular-season finale. In
1988, UCLA appears to have the talent
to make another run for the Roses.
Leading the way is Heisman Trophy
candidate Troy Aikman. Aikman
finished last year as the nation's second
rated passer, and he got off to a hot
start this season. He has completed 26
of 39 passes for 402 yards and six touch
downs in two big wins. First the Bruins
clobbered San Diego State 59-6, then
followed it up with a stunning victory,
completely dominating then-No. 2 Ne
braska 41-28 in a game that was per

haps not as close as the UCLA-SDSU
contest.
Senior Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose Bowl
MVP, rushed for 270 yards in the two
wins and Darryl Henley has two punt
returns-for-touchdowns — one 89 yards
against the Aztecs and the other 75
yards against the Cornhuskers. The
Bruins also return 240-pound tight end
Charles Arbuckle (five catches for two
TDs and 100 yards in the first quarter
versus Nebraska).
Defensively UCLA's strength is with
linebackers Carnell Lake and Chance
Johnson, two of the team's top tacklers
in 1987. Noseguard Jim Wahler will put
a lot of pressure on opposing passers,
and Henley (the younger brother of
recent Stanford grad Thomas Henley)
is considered one of the league's top
cornerbacks.
USC (2-0, 1-0)
The Trojans, currently ranked sth, at
least proved they are considerably better
than a poor Boston College team, drub
bing the Eagles 34-7 in their opener.
Things were a little different against
Stanford, however.
USC definitely struggled, and in fact,
was lucky to beat the fired-up Cardinal.
But the Trojans have their own Heis
man candidate/quarterback: Rodney
Peete. Peete has thrown two intercep
tions in each of the wins, but once he
settles down, he's tough to stop, as ev
idenced by his performance on the final
drive against Stanford, leading to the
winning touchdown with 1 minute, 19
seconds left.
Peete is 37-for-57 (.649) with 458
yards and two touchdowns in two
games. Those stats will continue to im
prove as the year goes on.

Peete is joined by 1987 First-Team
All-Pac-10 tight end Paul Green, who
extended his 23-game reception streak
against the Cardinal, and split end Eric
Affholter. Affholter will forever be
known for the winning touchdown
reception against UCLA last year that
propelled the Trojans to the Rose Bowl.
As usual USC has a good offensive
line and a large stable of backs to carry
the ball. Fullback Leroy Holt and tail
back Steven Webster are being touted
as honors candidates, while Aaron
Emanuel demonstrated the Trojans'
depth at this position by rushing for
121 yards against Stanford.
Defensively, tackle Tim Ryan is ex
pected to be a force, as are safeties
Cleveland Colter and Mark Carrier. Col
ter and Carrier combined for 10 inter
ceptions last season, including three in
the second half of the UCLA game, and
are really big hitters.
Perhaps USC's biggest hurdle is sur
viving non-league games against Okla
homa and Notre Dame — wins would
help morale greatly but a loss or two
could put a damper on the year.
Washington (1-0, 0-0)
The Huskies had what was for them
an off year in 1987, going only 7-4-1.
They did, however, reach a bowl game
(they beat Tulane 24-12 in the Inde
pendence Bowl) for the ninth straight
year under coach Don James and are
once again one of the top teams in the
West, currently ranked 17th nationally.
Washington, as usual, will be led by
a huge offensive line. This year's edition
averages 6-foot-3Vi, 275 pounds and in
cludes four returning starters. Cary


Bonjamin Tong — Daily file
UCLA field general Troy Aikman hopes to direct the Bruins to their seventh con
secutive bowl game win, preferably in the Rose Bowl on January 1.
Conklin steps in at quarterback
to replace Chris Chandler.
Conklin came off the bench
against Arizona last year when
Chandler was injured and threw
for 237 yards and two touchdowns
in that game. Of course, Conklin
was five of 18 for 57 yards and
three interceptions in a 20-6 win
over Purdue last week.
Conklin's favorite target will be
split end Brian Slater, who had
38 catches last year and averages
19.4 yards per reception for his
career.
Oregon (1-0, 0-0)
Coach Rich Brooks' Ducks took
a few people by surprise last year,
upsetting Colorado, Washington
and USC before coming back to
earth with a four-game losing
streak. The question is whether
this year's Ducks will play like a
team that beat three top-20
squads last season or a team that
lost to California by two touch
downs three weeks later.
Quarterback Bill Musgrave
returns after throwing for 1,836
yards last year and has breakaway
threat Terry Obee (33 catches,

19.4 yards per catch) returning
on the outside. The Ducks also
return their three top rushers
from last season.
Arizona (2-0, 1-0)
Arizona's record last season
looked more like a soccer team's
than a football team's with three
ties, but a year of experience run
ning Coach Dick Tomey's wish
and-shoot offense should enable
the Wildcats to turn some of those
ties into wins in 1988.
The offense, a combination be
tween the wishbone and the run
and-shoot, best utilizes the athle
tic ability of quarterback Ronnie
Veal. Bobby Watters, a transfer
from Southern Methodist, was the
starter until breaking a thumb in
the third game of the year.
Arizona has all three running
backs/slot backs returning from
last season, and flanker Derek
Hill was a first-team All-Pac-10
selection in 1987, recording 45
catches for 798 yards.
As an added bonus, Arizona has
All-Pac-10 first-teamers to anchor
both lines: center Joe Tofflemire
and noseguard Dana Wells.
California (1-0, 0-0)
The Bruce Snyder era contin
ues. Snyder took over as head
coach last season and, although
the squad went only 3-6-2, he

turned a team going downhill very
fast into a team going up. The
Golden Bears return 20 starters
from last year's team, the most
in the conference.
Troy Taylor threw for 18 touch
downs in only nine games last
year and has three 30-catch
receivers back to aim at.
On the other side of the ball,
Cal has a pass rush that improved
greatly as the year went on and
lost only linebacker Ken Harvey
from their front seven.
Washington State (2-0, 0-0)
The first rule of predicting the
order of finish in any Pac-10 sport
is to pick Washington State and
Oregon State ninth and 10th. Of
course, that was before the
Cougars clobbered Illinois, 44-7
in Illinois, and Minnesota, 41-9
in Minnesota.
Junior Timm Rosenbach threw
for 581 yards and four touch
downs while running for three
more against the two Big Ten
squads after throwing for 2,446
yards in 1987. Tailback Steve
Broussard caught 59 passes last
year, scored nine touchdowns, and
has five returning offensive
linemen in front of him this year.
The Cougars lost only two
starters on defense to graduation
and look likely to improve on last
season's 1-5-1 conference slate.

Arizona State (1-0, 0-0)
Well, the Sun Devils are prob
ably the best ninth-place team in
the country. They're still a ninth
place team, though.
Quarterback Daniel Ford
returns, but he only completed 49
percent of his passes last year and
leading receiver Aaron Cox was a
first-round draft choice of the
Rams.
The Sun Devils' two top rushers
from last season also graduated,
leaving a dearth of experience be
hind Ford.
Oregon State (1-1, 0-1)
The Beavers opened the Pac-10
season by playing Arizona and,
while they dominated most of the
statistics (418-238 yards in total
offense, 27-14 in first downs, 38
minutes of possession, one turn
over each), they somehow ended
up 11 points short.
Things did go better against
San Jose State last week, as the
Beavers won 41-27, but they were
the beneficiaries of six turnovers
while not losing the ball them
selves.
Oregon State has always been
a team that can put a lot of points
on the scoreboard, and with Erik
Wilhelm behind center for another
year, that won't change.

Quarterback Rodney "Heisman Trophy Candidate" Peete is the key
to No. 5 USC's Pac-10 title hopes.
As Stanford opens its 1988 season in
the rugged Pacific 10 Conference, one
thing is certain. The Cardinal is going
to play a lot of good teams. In addition
to non-league foes such as Notre Dame,
the Cardinal, as always, will be sternly
tested in each of its eight remaining
Pac-10 games.
While the Southeast Conference is
widely held to be the best in the land,
top-to-bottom, the Pac-10 ranks right
up there. The most recent proof of this
comes with the news that perennial Pac
-10 doormat Washington State buried
Big Ten schools Illinois, 44-7 at Illinois,
and Minnesota, 41-9 at Minnesota. In
fact, through two weeks of play, the
Pac-10 currently has an 11-0 record in
non-conference games. Here is a run
down of the conference from Rose Bowl
contenders USC and UCIA on down:
UCLA (2-0 overall, 0-0 in the Pac-10)
The second-ranked Bruins thought
they had a Rose Bowl bid locked up
last year but USC came back with two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter to
win the L.A. city championship, and the
Pac-10, in the regular-season finale. In
1988, UCLA appears to have the talent
to make another run for the Roses.
Leading the way is Heisman Trophy
candidate Troy Aikman. Aikman
finished last year as the nation's second
rated passer, and he got off to a hot
start this season. He has completed 26
of 39 passes for 402 yards and six touch
downs in two big wins. First the Bruins
clobbered San Diego State 59-6, then
followed it up with a stunning victory,
completely dominating then-No. 2 Ne
braska 41-28 in a game that was per

haps not as close as the UCLA-SDSU
contest.
Senior Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose Bowl
MVP, rushed for 270 yards in the two
wins and Darryl Henley has two punt
returns-for-touchdowns — one 89 yards
against the Aztecs and the other 75
yards against the Cornhuskers. The
Bruins also return 240-pound tight end
Charles Arbuckle (five catches for two
TDs and 100 yards in the first quarter
versus Nebraska).
Defensively UCLA's strength is with
linebackers Carnell Lake and Chance
Johnson, two of the team's top tacklers
in 1987. Noseguard Jim Wahler will put
a lot of pressure on opposing passers,
and Henley (the younger brother of
recent Stanford grad Thomas Henley)
is considered one of the league's top
cornerbacks.
USC (2-0, 1-0)
The Trojans, currently ranked sth, at
least proved they are considerably better
than a poor Boston College team, drub
bing the Eagles 34-7 in their opener.
Things were a little different against
Stanford, however.
USC definitely struggled, and in fact,
was lucky to beat the fired-up Cardinal.
But the Trojans have their own Heis
man candidate/quarterback: Rodney
Peete. Peete has thrown two intercep
tions in each of the wins, but once he
settles down, he's tough to stop, as ev
idenced by his performance on the final
drive against Stanford, leading to the
winning touchdown with 1 minute, 19
seconds left.
Peete is 37-for-57 (.649) with 458
yards and two touchdowns in two
games. Those stats will continue to im
prove as the year goes on.

Peete is joined by 1987 First-Team
All-Pac-10 tight end Paul Green, who
extended his 23-game reception streak
against the Cardinal, and split end Eric
Affholter. Affholter will forever be
known for the winning touchdown
reception against UCLA last year that
propelled the Trojans to the Rose Bowl.
As usual USC has a good offensive
line and a large stable of backs to carry
the ball. Fullback Leroy Holt and tail
back Steven Webster are being touted
as honors candidates, while Aaron
Emanuel demonstrated the Trojans'
depth at this position by rushing for
121 yards against Stanford.
Defensively, tackle Tim Ryan is ex
pected to be a force, as are safeties
Cleveland Colter and Mark Carrier. Col
ter and Carrier combined for 10 inter
ceptions last season, including three in
the second half of the UCLA game, and
are really big hitters.
Perhaps USC's biggest hurdle is sur
viving non-league games against Okla
homa and Notre Dame — wins would
help morale greatly but a loss or two
could put a damper on the year.
Washington (1-0, 0-0)
The Huskies had what was for them
an off year in 1987, going only 7-4-1.
They did, however, reach a bowl game
(they beat Tulane 24-12 in the Inde
pendence Bowl) for the ninth straight
year under coach Don James and are
once again one of the top teams in the
West, currently ranked 17th nationally.
Washington, as usual, will be led by
a huge offensive line. This year's edition
averages 6-foot-3Vi, 275 pounds and in
cludes four returning starters. Cary


Bonjamin Tong — Daily file
UCLA field general Troy Aikman hopes to direct the Bruins to their seventh con
secutive bowl game win, preferably in the Rose Bowl on January 1.
Conklin steps in at quarterback
to replace Chris Chandler.
Conklin came off the bench
against Arizona last year when
Chandler was injured and threw
for 237 yards and two touchdowns
in that game. Of course, Conklin
was five of 18 for 57 yards and
three interceptions in a 20-6 win
over Purdue last week.
Conklin's favorite target will be
split end Brian Slater, who had
38 catches last year and averages
19.4 yards per reception for his
career.
Oregon (1-0, 0-0)
Coach Rich Brooks' Ducks took
a few people by surprise last year,
upsetting Colorado, Washington
and USC before coming back to
earth with a four-game losing
streak. The question is whether
this year's Ducks will play like a
team that beat three top-20
squads last season or a team that
lost to California by two touch
downs three weeks later.
Quarterback Bill Musgrave
returns after throwing for 1,836
yards last year and has breakaway
threat Terry Obee (33 catches,

19.4 yards per catch) returning
on the outside. The Ducks also
return their three top rushers
from last season.
Arizona (2-0, 1-0)
Arizona's record last season
looked more like a soccer team's
than a football team's with three
ties, but a year of experience run
ning Coach Dick Tomey's wish
and-shoot offense should enable
the Wildcats to turn some of those
ties into wins in 1988.
The offense, a combination be
tween the wishbone and the run
and-shoot, best utilizes the athle
tic ability of quarterback Ronnie
Veal. Bobby Watters, a transfer
from Southern Methodist, was the
starter until breaking a thumb in
the third game of the year.
Arizona has all three running
backs/slot backs returning from
last season, and flanker Derek
Hill was a first-team All-Pac-10
selection in 1987, recording 45
catches for 798 yards.
As an added bonus, Arizona has
All-Pac-10 first-teamers to anchor
both lines: center Joe Tofflemire
and noseguard Dana Wells.
California (1-0, 0-0)
The Bruce Snyder era contin
ues. Snyder took over as head
coach last season and, although
the squad went only 3-6-2, he

turned a team going downhill very
fast into a team going up. The
Golden Bears return 20 starters
from last year's team, the most
in the conference.
Troy Taylor threw for 18 touch
downs in only nine games last
year and has three 30-catch
receivers back to aim at.
On the other side of the ball,
Cal has a pass rush that improved
greatly as the year went on and
lost only linebacker Ken Harvey
from their front seven.
Washington State (2-0, 0-0)
The first rule of predicting the
order of finish in any Pac-10 sport
is to pick Washington State and
Oregon State ninth and 10th. Of
course, that was before the
Cougars clobbered Illinois, 44-7
in Illinois, and Minnesota, 41-9
in Minnesota.
Junior Timm Rosenbach threw
for 581 yards and four touch
downs while running for three
more against the two Big Ten
squads after throwing for 2,446
yards in 1987. Tailback Steve
Broussard caught 59 passes last
year, scored nine touchdowns, and
has five returning offensive
linemen in front of him this year.
The Cougars lost only two
starters on defense to graduation
and look likely to improve on last
season's 1-5-1 conference slate.

Arizona State (1-0, 0-0)
Well, the Sun Devils are prob
ably the best ninth-place team in
the country. They're still a ninth
place team, though.
Quarterback Daniel Ford
returns, but he only completed 49
percent of his passes last year and
leading receiver Aaron Cox was a
first-round draft choice of the
Rams.
The Sun Devils' two top rushers
from last season also graduated,
leaving a dearth of experience be
hind Ford.
Oregon State (1-1, 0-1)
The Beavers opened the Pac-10
season by playing Arizona and,
while they dominated most of the
statistics (418-238 yards in total
offense, 27-14 in first downs, 38
minutes of possession, one turn
over each), they somehow ended
up 11 points short.
Things did go better against
San Jose State last week, as the
Beavers won 41-27, but they were
the beneficiaries of six turnovers
while not losing the ball them

from last season also graduated,
leaving a dearth of experience be
hind Ford.
Oregon State (1-1, 0-1)
The Beavers opened the Pac-10
season by playing Arizona and,
while they dominated most of the
statistics (418-238 yards in total
offense, 27-14 in first downs, 38
minutes of possession, one turn
over each), they somehow ended
up 11 points short.
Things did go better against
San Jose State last week, as the
Beavers won 41-27, but they were
the beneficiaries of six turnovers
while not losing the ball them
selves.
Oregon State has always been
a team that can put a lot of points
on the scoreboard, and with Erik
Wilhelm behind center for another
year, that won't change.

Quarterback Rodney "Heisman Trophy Candidate" Peete is the key
to No. 5 USC's Pac-10 title hopes.
As Stanford opens its 1988 season in
the rugged Pacific 10 Conference, one
thing is certain. The Cardinal is going
to play a lot of good teams. In addition
to non-league foes such as Notre Dame,
the Cardinal, as always, will be sternly
tested in each of its eight remaining
Pac-10 games.
While the Southeast Conference is
widely held to be the best in the land,
top-to-bottom, the Pac-10 ranks right
up there. The most recent proof of this
comes with the news that perennial Pac
-10 doormat Washington State buried
Big Ten schools Illinois, 44-7 at Illinois,
and Minnesota, 41-9 at Minnesota. In
fact, through two weeks of play, the
Pac-10 currently has an 11-0 record in
non-conference games. Here is a run
down of the conference from Rose Bowl
contenders USC and UCIA on down:
UCLA (2-0 overall, 0-0 in the Pac-10)
The second-ranked Bruins thought
they had a Rose Bowl bid locked up
last year but USC came back with two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter to
win the L.A. city championship, and the
Pac-10, in the regular-season finale. In
1988, UCLA appears to have the talent
to make another run for the Roses.
Leading the way is Heisman Trophy
candidate Troy Aikman. Aikman
finished last year as the nation's second
rated passer, and he got off to a hot
start this season. He has completed 26
of 39 passes for 402 yards and six touch
downs in two big wins. First the Bruins
clobbered San Diego State 59-6, then
followed it up with a stunning victory,
completely dominating then-No. 2 Ne
braska 41-28 in a game that was per

haps not as close as the UCLA-SDSU
contest.
Senior Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose Bowl
MVP, rushed for 270 yards in the two
wins and Darryl Henley has two punt
returns-for-touchdowns — one 89 yards
against the Aztecs and the other 75
yards against the Cornhuskers. The
Bruins also return 240-pound tight end
Charles Arbuckle (five catches for two
TDs and 100 yards in the first quarter
versus Nebraska).
Defensively UCLA's strength is with
linebackers Carnell Lake and Chance
Johnson, two of the team's top tacklers
in 1987. Noseguard Jim Wahler will put
a lot of pressure on opposing passers,
and Henley (the younger brother of
recent Stanford grad Thomas Henley)
is considered one of the league's top
cornerbacks.
USC (2-0, 1-0)
The Trojans, currently ranked sth, at
least proved they are considerably better
than a poor Boston College team, drub
bing the Eagles 34-7 in their opener.
Things were a little different against
Stanford, however.
USC definitely struggled, and in fact,
was lucky to beat the fired-up Cardinal.
But the Trojans have their own Heis
man candidate/quarterback: Rodney
Peete. Peete has thrown two intercep
tions in each of the wins, but once he
settles down, he's tough to stop, as ev
idenced by his performance on the final
drive against Stanford, leading to the
winning touchdown with 1 minute, 19
seconds left.
Peete is 37-for-57 (.649) with 458
yards and two touchdowns in two
games. Those stats will continue to im
prove as the year goes on.

Peete is joined by 1987 First-Team
All-Pac-10 tight end Paul Green, who
extended his 23-game reception streak
against the Cardinal, and split end Eric
Affholter. Affholter will forever be
known for the winning touchdown
reception against UCLA last year that
propelled the Trojans to the Rose Bowl.
As usual USC has a good offensive
line and a large stable of backs to carry
the ball. Fullback Leroy Holt and tail
back Steven Webster are being touted
as honors candidates, while Aaron
Emanuel demonstrated the Trojans'
depth at this position by rushing for
121 yards against Stanford.
Defensively, tackle Tim Ryan is ex
pected to be a force, as are safeties
Cleveland Colter and Mark Carrier. Col
ter and Carrier combined for 10 inter
ceptions last season, including three in
the second half of the UCLA game, and
are really big hitters.
Perhaps USC's biggest hurdle is sur
viving non-league games against Okla
homa and Notre Dame — wins would
help morale greatly but a loss or two
could put a damper on the year.
Washington (1-0, 0-0)
The Huskies had what was for them
an off year in 1987, going only 7-4-1.
They did, however, reach a bowl game
(they beat Tulane 24-12 in the Inde
pendence Bowl) for the ninth straight
year under coach Don James and are
once again one of the top teams in the
West, currently ranked 17th nationally.
Washington, as usual, will be led by
a huge offensive line. This year's edition
averages 6-foot-3Vi, 275 pounds and in
cludes four returning starters. Cary


Bonjamin Tong — Daily file
UCLA field general Troy Aikman hopes to direct the Bruins to their seventh con
secutive bowl game win, preferably in the Rose Bowl on January 1.
Conklin steps in at quarterback
to replace Chris Chandler.
Conklin came off the bench
against Arizona last year when
Chandler was injured and threw
for 237 yards and two touchdowns
in that game. Of course, Conklin
was five of 18 for 57 yards and
three interceptions in a 20-6 win
over Purdue last week.
Conklin's favorite target will be
split end Brian Slater, who had
38 catches last year and averages
19.4 yards per reception for his
career.
Oregon (1-0, 0-0)
Coach Rich Brooks' Ducks took
a few people by surprise last year,
upsetting Colorado, Washington
and USC before coming back to
earth with a four-game losing
streak. The question is whether
this year's Ducks will play like a
team that beat three top-20
squads last season or a team that
lost to California by two touch
downs three weeks later.
Quarterback Bill Musgrave
returns after throwing for 1,836
yards last year and has breakaway
threat Terry Obee (33 catches,

19.4 yards per catch) returning
on the outside. The Ducks also
return their three top rushers
from last season.
Arizona (2-0, 1-0)
Arizona's record last season
looked more like a soccer team's
than a football team's with three
ties, but a year of experience run
ning Coach Dick Tomey's wish
and-shoot offense should enable
the Wildcats to turn some of those
ties into wins in 1988.
The offense, a combination be
tween the wishbone and the run
and-shoot, best utilizes the athle
tic ability of quarterback Ronnie
Veal. Bobby Watters, a transfer
from Southern Methodist, was the
starter until breaking a thumb in
the third game of the year.
Arizona has all three running
backs/slot backs returning from
last season, and flanker Derek
Hill was a first-team All-Pac-10
selection in 1987, recording 45
catches for 798 yards.
As an added bonus, Arizona has
All-Pac-10 first-teamers to anchor
both lines: center Joe Tofflemire
and noseguard Dana Wells.
California (1-0, 0-0)
The Bruce Snyder era contin
ues. Snyder took over as head
coach last season and, although
the squad went only 3-6-2, he

turned a team going downhill very
fast into a team going up. The
Golden Bears return 20 starters
from last year's team, the most
in the conference.
Troy Taylor threw for 18 touch
downs in only nine games last
year and has three 30-catch
receivers back to aim at.
On the other side of the ball,
Cal has a pass rush that improved
greatly as the year went on and
lost only linebacker Ken Harvey
from their front seven.
Washington State (2-0, 0-0)
The first rule of predicting the
order of finish in any Pac-10 sport
is to pick Washington State and
Oregon State ninth and 10th. Of
course, that was before the
Cougars clobbered Illinois, 44-7
in Illinois, and Minnesota, 41-9
in Minnesota.
Junior Timm Rosenbach threw
for 581 yards and four touch
downs while running for three
more against the two Big Ten
squads after throwing for 2,446
yards in 1987. Tailback Steve
Broussard caught 59 passes last
year, scored nine touchdowns, and
has five returning offensive
linemen in front of him this year.
The Cougars lost only two
starters on defense to graduation
and look likely to improve on last
season's 1-5-1 conference slate.

Arizona State (1-0, 0-0)
Well, the Sun Devils are prob
ably the best ninth-place team in
the country. They're still a ninth
place team, though.
Quarterback Daniel Ford
returns, but he only completed 49
percent of his passes last year and
leading receiver Aaron Cox was a
first-round draft choice of the
Rams.
The Sun Devils' two top rushers
from last season also graduated,
leaving a dearth of experience be
hind Ford.
Oregon State (1-1, 0-1)
The Beavers opened the Pac-10
season by playing Arizona and,
while they dominated most of the
statistics (418-238 yards in total
offense, 27-14 in first downs, 38
minutes of possession, one turn
over each), they somehow ended
up 11 points short.

San Jose State last week, as the
Beavers won 41-27, but they were
the beneficiaries of six turnovers
