# Bruins favored in Pac-10
## 
### Chris Crader 
As Stanford opens its 1988 season in
the rugged Pacific 10 Conference, one
thing is certain. The Cardinal is going
to play a lot of good teams. In addition
to non-league foes such as Notre Dame,
the Cardinal, as always, will be sternly
tested in each of its eight remaining
Pac-10 games.
While the Southeast Conference is
widely held to be the best in the land,
top-to-bottom, the Pac-10 ranks right
up there. The most recent proof of this
comes with the news that perennial Pac
-10 doormat Washington State buried
Big Ten schools Illinois, 44-7 at Illinois,
and Minnesota, 41-9 at Minnesota. In
fact, through two weeks of play, the
Pac-10 currently has an 11-0 record in
non-conference games. Here is a run
down of the conference from Rose Bowl
contenders USC and UCIA on down:
UCLA (2-0 overall, 0-0 in the Pac-10)
The second-ranked Bruins thought
they had a Rose Bowl bid locked up
last year but USC came back with two
touchdowns in the fourth quarter to
win the L.A. city championship, and the
Pac-10, in the regular-season finale. In
1988, UCLA appears to have the talent
to make another run for the Roses.
Leading the way is Heisman Trophy
candidate Troy Aikman. Aikman
finished last year as the nation's second
rated passer, and he got off to a hot
start this season. He has completed 26
of 39 passes for 402 yards and six touch
downs in two big wins. First the Bruins
clobbered San Diego State 59-6, then
followed it up with a stunning victory,
completely dominating then-No. 2 Ne
braska 41-28 in a game that was per

haps not as close as the UCLA-SDSU
contest.
Senior Eric Ball, the 1986 Rose Bowl
MVP, rushed for 270 yards in the two
wins and Darryl Henley has two punt
returns-for-touchdowns — one 89 yards
against the Aztecs and the other 75
yards against the Cornhuskers. The
Bruins also return 240-pound tight end
Charles Arbuckle (five catches for two
TDs and 100 yards in the first quarter
versus Nebraska).
Defensively UCLA's strength is with
linebackers Carnell Lake and Chance
Johnson, two of the team's top tacklers
in 1987. Noseguard Jim Wahler will put
a lot of pressure on opposing passers,
and Henley (the younger brother of
recent Stanford grad Thomas Henley)
is considered one of the league's top
cornerbacks.
USC (2-0, 1-0)
The Trojans, currently ranked sth, at
least proved they are considerably better
than a poor Boston College team, drub
bing the Eagles 34-7 in their opener.
Things were a little different against
Stanford, however.
USC definitely struggled, and in fact,
was lucky to beat the fired-up Cardinal.
But the Trojans have their own Heis
man candidate/quarterback: Rodney
Peete. Peete has thrown two intercep
tions in each of the wins, but once he
settles down, he's tough to stop, as ev
idenced by his performance on the final
drive against Stanford, leading to the
winning touchdown with 1 minute, 19
seconds left.
Peete is 37-for-57 (.649) with 458
yards and two touchdowns in two
games. Those stats will continue to im
prove as the year goes on.

Peete is joined by 1987 First-Team
All-Pac-10 tight end Paul Green, who
extended his 23-game reception streak
against the Cardinal, and split end Eric
Affholter. Affholter will forever be
known for the winning touchdown
reception against UCLA last year that
propelled the Trojans to the Rose Bowl.
As usual USC has a good offensive
line and a large stable of backs to carry
the ball. Fullback Leroy Holt and tail
back Steven Webster are being touted
as honors candidates, while Aaron
Emanuel demonstrated the Trojans'
depth at this position by rushing for
121 yards against Stanford.
Defensively, tackle Tim Ryan is ex
pected to be a force, as are safeties
Cleveland Colter and Mark Carrier. Col
ter and Carrier combined for 10 inter
ceptions last season, including three in
the second half of the UCLA game, and
are really big hitters.
Perhaps USC's biggest hurdle is sur
viving non-league games against Okla
homa and Notre Dame — wins would
help morale greatly but a loss or two
could put a damper on the year.
Washington (1-0, 0-0)
The Huskies had what was for them
an off year in 1987, going only 7-4-1.
They did, however, reach a bowl game
(they beat Tulane 24-12 in the Inde
pendence Bowl) for the ninth straight
year under coach Don James and are
once again one of the top teams in the
West, currently ranked 17th nationally.
Washington, as usual, will be led by
a huge offensive line. This year's edition
averages 6-foot-3Vi, 275 pounds and in
cludes four returning starters. Cary

UCLA field general Troy Aikman hopes to direct the Bruins to their seventh con
secutive bowl game win, preferably in the Rose Bowl on January 1.
