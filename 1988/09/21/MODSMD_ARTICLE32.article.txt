# Soccer wants first NCAA berth
## 
### Jon Weisman 
Many veterans of the Stanford sport
ing life would tell you that seeing the
men's soccer team was worth the price
of admission.
But even though Stanford will be
charging entry fees for the first time
this year at a fenced-in Maloney Field,
the Cardinal should have no trouble
living up to this reputation.
With many of the players from last
year's 9-9-3 squad returning in 1988,
Stanford figures to contend for an
NCAA playoff berth. The team is off to
a flying start, opening with six straight
victories, two in the Pacific Soccer Con
ference, and averaging almost three
goals a game.
"We hope that postseason play is in
the cards this year," Stanford Coach
Sam Koch said. "It's going to be a dog
fight, no doubt about it."
Koch guesses that Stanford will have

to be among the top four or five teams
in the Western region for those cards
to turn up aces. Last year, the Cardinal
was third in the conference but shut
out three nationally-ranked Western
schools: USF, Fresno State and UCLA.
"The success from last year definitely
gave us some needed confidence," Koch
said.
Senior fullback Dave Thorpe agreed,
saying "the attitude of the whole team
this year is really up."
Before the season began, the team
expected to improve in two 1987 prob
lem areas: scoring punch and depth.
Despite its .500 record, the Cardinal
only averaged 1.19 goals per game last
year, and scored more than one goal
only five times. The team relied largely
on the impressive goalkeeping of junior
Chris Helling, who allowed only 1.15
goals per game.
But this year the team will not only
bring back laÂ§t year's leading scorer,

junior Chris Porch, but several other
threats: sophomores Todd Caven,
Andrew Feldman, Adam Muchnick,
Evan Nadler and John Howlett.
In addition, Koch can look forward
to some talented incoming players, in
cluding freshmen Rhett Harty and Bing
Kongmebhol. Harty, who will contribute
immediately, is on the Under-20 Na
tional Team.
Harty and Kongmebhol are just two
of a 12-member recruiting class which,
combined with the return of many vet
erans, should address the team's second
problem.
"The depth is probably what we
needed to improve over last year," Koch
said, "and we have definitely done that."
Still, the key to Stanford's success
will probably remain on its own side of
the field. Senior Luke Garrott, who
scored one goal all season (the only one
