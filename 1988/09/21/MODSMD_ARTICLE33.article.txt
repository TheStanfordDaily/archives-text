# Spikers hope to keep NCAA date

Many observers of college volleyball
feel that the Stanford dynasty is over.
With the graduation of three of the
strongest players in school history —
Ail-Americans Nancy Reno, Wendi Rush
and Teresa Smith — it seems to the
skeptics that the Cardinal will be unable
to extend its record six consecutive Final
Four appearances and two straight
Pacific 10 Conference titles.
The team plans to prove the skeptics
wrong.
Already out to a blistering 5-0 start,
Stanford was ranked an impressive No.
4 on the Tachikara Preseason Coaches'
Poll and predicted to finish second in
the competitive Pac-10 behind i987
runner-up UCLA. Though the value of
these polls is dubious indeed, they are
a flattering testimonial to a young team
with but a handful of experienced up
perclassmen.
"I don't know if we deserve it (the
preseason ranking), but I don't know
if anybody else deserves to be anything
else," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"I look at the top 10 teams as all being
that you could throw a blanket over all
of them. There's a good 10, and maybe
more, teams that are capable right now;
it's going to depend on injuries and how
young kids develop.

"It's really wide open," he added. "I've
never seen it so wide open."
The Cardinal, now third in the polls,
is led by senior captain Laura Olesen,
a middle blocker who redshirted fresh
man year but has started ever since.
The team leader in blocks last year as
well as one of its strongest hitters, oft
unsung Olesen is Stanford's secret
weapon.
The team's sole graduating senior is
outside hitter Amy Hayes, who rapidly
rose to fame her freshman year with
her incredibly potent serve and tena
cious defense. Last year saw Hayes start
throughout the season, earning herself
Pac-10 Player of the Week honors by
leading the Cardinal in its conference
championship clinchers over UCLA and
use.
Stanford's final returning starter,
junior Lara Asper, finds herself in a
uniquely challenging position by assum
ing the setting helm vacated by Rush.
Relegated to an outside hitter spot for
her first two seasons, Asper is eager to
succeed.
"I don't think she's worried about
filling anybody's shoes," Shaw said. "I
think she's happy to get the opportunity
to play the position she came here as.
She's happy to get the chance to be the
setter out there, and I think she does
a really good job.

"She's going to be the person who is
going to do the job for us. She sets a
nice ball, she's a smart player and she
was the top setter prospect her senior
year of high school, so there's no reason
to think that she can't do the job. I
think she's going to make the most out
of the opportunity."
Classmate Jennifer Chaffee is another
player earning her stripes. The 6-2
middle blocker-turned-outside hitter is
one of the strongest athletes on the
team whose height, leap and power
make her an constant threat on the left
side. As Texas discovered in the NCAA
semifinal match last year, Chaffee can
be the consummate clutch player, and
should have no trouble consistently
working her way into the starting line
up.
Another sizeable force on the outside
is redshirt junior Jessica Benton, an
other middle blocker convert. At 6-4,
she puts up a large blocking wall that
should consistently keep opponents' hits
out of the Cardinal court.
Rounding out the returners are the
sophomores: setter Karen Anderson and
hitters Cheryl Conly and Tracy Hughes.
Though none of these three may start,
this talented trio will not be stuck on
the bench for long.

Junior Lara Asper, middle, and senior Laura Olesen, right, both starters on the
Cardinal's 1987 NCAA runner-up squad, will be the nucleus of a young team trying
to reach the Final Four for an unprecedented seventh straight year.
"All the girls we have coming
back have worked really hard in
general and are getting stronger,"
Shaw observed. "Chaffee and Ben
ton in particular, Hughes and
Conly, all those kids that are re
turning had really good off
seasons, and that's going to
show."
But the freshmen hold the
team's true life blood. The enter
ing class consists of five extremely
balanced players, all of whom can
play outside hitter as well as
middle blocker (the position each
played in high school).
The pair that have made an
instant mark are Amy Cooper and
Kristin Klein, two players who
have played extensively in each of
the Cardinal's matches. Cooper,
a native of Reno's home state of
Illinois and a first-team high
school All-American, has readily
stepped into Reno's spot and
played with surprising confidence
in her very first Maples Pavilion
outing, the three-game win over
San Francisco. Cooper garnered
a respectable .375 hitting percent
age and three block assists.

"The transition (from high
school) wasn't easy, but I guess 1
handled it all right," Cooper said.
"I've still got. gobs to learn, but
it's coming and I'm really glad."
While her debut was somewhat
less auspicious, Klein has been
steadily improving ever since she
became the top recipient of
Asper's sets. Playing outside hit
ter, the freshman has consistently
sparked the Cardinal offensive at
tack and made a tangible impact
on the court.
"They're both capable of doing
that (making an impact)," Shaw
said.
"The freshmen are picking
things up real fast. It's never easy
when freshmen come into a fall
sport, and when we throw them
in there it's going to be a case of
learning by experience."
Nicole Appleman has also seen
a fair share of playing time, and
is another reason why Stanford's
Class of '88 has been considered
the finest recruiting class in the
country. Along with Jodi Birk
(who may redshirt this year, so
she hasn't seen any action yet)
and Jennifer Jackson (who has
been sidelined with an injury), Ap
pleman presents one of Stanford's
hopes for an unprecedented
seventh consecutive Final Four
appearance.

Ail-Americans Nancy Reno, Wendi Rush
and Teresa Smith — it seems to the
skeptics that the Cardinal will be unable
to extend its record six consecutive Final
Four appearances and two straight
Pacific 10 Conference titles.
The team plans to prove the skeptics
wrong.
Already out to a blistering 5-0 start,
Stanford was ranked an impressive No.
4 on the Tachikara Preseason Coaches'
Poll and predicted to finish second in
the competitive Pac-10 behind i987
runner-up UCLA. Though the value of
these polls is dubious indeed, they are
a flattering testimonial to a young team
with but a handful of experienced up
perclassmen.
"I don't know if we deserve it (the
preseason ranking), but I don't know
if anybody else deserves to be anything
else," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"I look at the top 10 teams as all being
that you could throw a blanket over all
of them. There's a good 10, and maybe
more, teams that are capable right now;
it's going to depend on injuries and how
young kids develop.

"It's really wide open," he added. "I've
never seen it so wide open."
The Cardinal, now third in the polls,
is led by senior captain Laura Olesen,
a middle blocker who redshirted fresh
man year but has started ever since.
The team leader in blocks last year as
well as one of its strongest hitters, oft
unsung Olesen is Stanford's secret
weapon.
The team's sole graduating senior is
outside hitter Amy Hayes, who rapidly
rose to fame her freshman year with
her incredibly potent serve and tena
cious defense. Last year saw Hayes start
throughout the season, earning herself
Pac-10 Player of the Week honors by
leading the Cardinal in its conference
championship clinchers over UCLA and
use.
Stanford's final returning starter,
junior Lara Asper, finds herself in a
uniquely challenging position by assum
ing the setting helm vacated by Rush.
Relegated to an outside hitter spot for
her first two seasons, Asper is eager to
succeed.
"I don't think she's worried about
filling anybody's shoes," Shaw said. "I
think she's happy to get the opportunity
to play the position she came here as.
She's happy to get the chance to be the
setter out there, and I think she does
a really good job.

"She's going to be the person who is
going to do the job for us. She sets a
nice ball, she's a smart player and she
was the top setter prospect her senior
year of high school, so there's no reason
to think that she can't do the job. I
think she's going to make the most out
of the opportunity."
Classmate Jennifer Chaffee is another
player earning her stripes. The 6-2
middle blocker-turned-outside hitter is
one of the strongest athletes on the
team whose height, leap and power
make her an constant threat on the left
side. As Texas discovered in the NCAA
semifinal match last year, Chaffee can
be the consummate clutch player, and
should have no trouble consistently
working her way into the starting line
up.
Another sizeable force on the outside
is redshirt junior Jessica Benton, an
other middle blocker convert. At 6-4,
she puts up a large blocking wall that
should consistently keep opponents' hits
out of the Cardinal court.
Rounding out the returners are the
sophomores: setter Karen Anderson and
hitters Cheryl Conly and Tracy Hughes.
Though none of these three may start,
this talented trio will not be stuck on
the bench for long.

Junior Lara Asper, middle, and senior Laura Olesen, right, both starters on the
Cardinal's 1987 NCAA runner-up squad, will be the nucleus of a young team trying
to reach the Final Four for an unprecedented seventh straight year.
"All the girls we have coming
back have worked really hard in
general and are getting stronger,"
Shaw observed. "Chaffee and Ben
ton in particular, Hughes and
Conly, all those kids that are re
turning had really good off
seasons, and that's going to
show."
But the freshmen hold the
team's true life blood. The enter
ing class consists of five extremely
balanced players, all of whom can
play outside hitter as well as
middle blocker (the position each
played in high school).
The pair that have made an
instant mark are Amy Cooper and
Kristin Klein, two players who
have played extensively in each of
the Cardinal's matches. Cooper,
a native of Reno's home state of
Illinois and a first-team high
school All-American, has readily
stepped into Reno's spot and
played with surprising confidence
in her very first Maples Pavilion
outing, the three-game win over
San Francisco. Cooper garnered
a respectable .375 hitting percent
age and three block assists.

"The transition (from high
school) wasn't easy, but I guess 1
handled it all right," Cooper said.
"I've still got. gobs to learn, but
it's coming and I'm really glad."
While her debut was somewhat
less auspicious, Klein has been
steadily improving ever since she
became the top recipient of
Asper's sets. Playing outside hit
ter, the freshman has consistently
sparked the Cardinal offensive at
tack and made a tangible impact
on the court.
"They're both capable of doing
that (making an impact)," Shaw
said.
"The freshmen are picking
things up real fast. It's never easy
when freshmen come into a fall
sport, and when we throw them
in there it's going to be a case of
learning by experience."
Nicole Appleman has also seen
a fair share of playing time, and
is another reason why Stanford's
Class of '88 has been considered
the finest recruiting class in the
country. Along with Jodi Birk
(who may redshirt this year, so
she hasn't seen any action yet)
and Jennifer Jackson (who has
been sidelined with an injury), Ap
pleman presents one of Stanford's
hopes for an unprecedented
seventh consecutive Final Four
appearance.

feel that the Stanford dynasty is over.
