# Card contingent visits Seoul

### Chris Crader 
Already established as one of
the top academic institutions in
the world, Stanford now has a
chance to demonstrate athletic su
periority as well.
When the 1988 Summer Olym
pic Games began Saturday in
Seoul, South Korea, many Stan
ford students, graduates and
coaches began the quest to con
tinue the gold-medal tradition set
forth by the likes of Bob Mathias,
Chris von Saltza and Eric Heiden
— all three former Stanford stu
dents and multiple gold-medal
winners.
With more than a score of ath
letes competing on Olympic teams
from all over the world, Stanford
is a sure bet to pull home more
medals than quite a few of the
countries competing. Two Stan
ford athletes with the best chance
of claiming gold are volleyball
players Scott Fortune and Jon
Root.
Root, a 1986 graduate, has been
playing with the U.S. team for
two years. Fortune, on the other
hand, stopped out the 1987-88
season to train with the Olympic
team. He will return to the Farm
for his senior year after the
Games. The United States has
been undisputedly the best team

in men's international volleyball
since winning the gold medal in
1984 and will receive its sternest
test from the second-ranked
Soviets, a team the United States
has defeated in seven of eight
meetings in 1988 (the one loss
was a marathon five-game match
in Moscow). Additionally, Stan
ford Men's Coach Fred Sturm will
be serving as an assistant coach
for the squad, a capacity in which
he has served the past two sum
mers.
On the women's side, Kim
Oden, class of '86, is a starter,
and the captain, of the U.S. wom
en's volleyball squad. The Amer
ican women are currently ranked
fifth in the world, but will have
to overcome a very tough draw
to medal in Seoul.
The national water polo team,
ranked fourth in the world, also
has a Stanford flavor to it. Jody
Campbell ('B2) is on his third con
secutive Olympic team, and is
joined by classmate Alan Mouch
awar and James Bergeson ('B3).
Craig Klass, the college Player-of
the-Year as a senior in 1986, is
also a member of the team.
In baseball, the United States
is led by Coach Mark Marquess,
who will hope to duplicate his suc
cess here (NCAA championships
in 1987 and 1988) with the Amer

ican team in Seoul. Two of his
top players should look familiar
to him as catcher Doug Robbins
and third baseman/designated hit
ter Ed Sprague are both on the
team.
Robbins finished his senior year
by leading the Cardinal to the
national title in June, while
Sprague, a junior last season, has
forfeited his final year of collegiate
eligiblity to enter the Toronto
Blue Jays organization (he was a
first-round draft choice). The
United States recently finished
second in the baseball World
Championships, losing twice, in
one-run games, to winner Cuba.
Although seeded third in Seoul,
the Americans have to be the
favorites as the Cubans are
boycotting the Games.
In other team sports, Field
Hockey Coach Sheryl Johnson
and her assistant Megan Donnelly
will be playing for the U.S. team.
Donnelly was a standout at' Ma
ssachusetts, winning the Broderick
Award for field hockey (given an
nually to the nation's outstanding
collegian) in 1986. Johnson is
co-captain of the American squad
and is playing in her third Olym
pics. She has led the Cardinal to
the NCAA tournament in each of
