# Stanford crew teams on the rise
## Men, women challenge perennial powers in West 
### Don Hogue 
During the past few years, Stanford's crew
program has grown in both size and success
while competing against top teams from across
the nation. Stanford has narrowed the gap
between itself and the traditional crew powers.
Last year, head coach Ken Dreyfuss' varsity
men defeated Washington — a team which
for years had held a stranglehold on the West
Coast.
And, some of the most successful rowers
had not seen, let alone rowed, an oar prior
to joining crew at Stanford. For example, the
women's novice team went undefeated last
year, cruising to gold at the 1988 Pacific Coast
Championship. Two years ago, Stanford's
frosh men won silver at the same event.
"The program is designed for novice
rowers," Dreyfuss says."And the most suc
cessful people in our program never rowed
crew before college."
"One doesn't necessarily need experience to
be successful in crew," says Stanford women's
crew coach John Davis. "Because of its struc
ture, it demands that you do what's best for
the team in the boat. When you improve, the
boat improves and vice versa."
Stanford's crew routine is varied. During
the fall, the team undergoes conditioning on
weekday afternoons, occasionally taking to the
water at the Stanford Boathouse in Redwood
City. During the winter, the crews learn to
work together in the boat, while competing
in the spring on Stanford's home course at

beautiful Redwood Shores.
Each fall, crew attracts many curious fresh
men who come out to see what crew is all
about and become hooked on the sport.
"There's no other sport that can match the
feeling of an eight-oared shell on the water,
all rowers in synch," Davis said. "Once you
get that indescribable, yet unmistakable
feeling, you're hooked."

West Coast.

"There's a special joy inherent in crew be
cause of the team dynamics," adds Davis. "To
be successful in crew it takes intelligence,
humility, self-discipline and strength of char
acter. The environment of the racing shell
demands these traits."
Equally demanding is the constant prodding
and encouragement from the coxswain, the
crew's vocal leader. Seemingly a fraction of

the size of the rest of the crew members, the
coxswain constantly hounds the crew to work
together, yelling encouragement, coaching and
strategy.
"It's potentially the most challenging posi
tion for a man of 130 pounds or a woman of
110 pounds to take charge of others who are
so much bigger," Davis explains. "Not only
must he or she steer the boat, the coxswain
is also in charge of coordinating the efforts
of eight other rowers. The coxswain is the
strategist and motivator and doesn't just sit
there yelling 'stroke.'"
Many of the crews have informal bets for
racing jerseys at the start of regattas. The
winning crew wins the shirts literally off the
backs of the competitors at the finish. Crew
members take pride in their collection of these
"trophies." The reward for the winning
coxswain is often a plunge into the water from
his crew.
There are two types of rowing. One is called
sculling, in which each rower pulls two oars
simultaneously. Sculls are typically rowed in
single-man or double-man shells at the na
tional and international level. Much of the
rowing at the collegiate level, however, is
sweep rowing, where each rower pulls one
oar, each keeping in sync with the lead rower.
Novice rowers won't have to row in San
Francisco Bay the first time they climb into
the racing shell. The crew coaches have de
signed a practice boat in Roble Pool which
will enable first-time rowers to gain confidence
and experience in the boat.
