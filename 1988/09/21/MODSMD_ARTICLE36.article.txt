# Stanford water polo will win with defense
## 
### Cameron Macky 
OK, pretend you're a water polo coach
at a semi-prestigious California univer
sity. You've got national championships
coming out your ears, you've been
named the conference Coach of the Year
so many times they might as well
rename the award in your honor, and
to top it all off you've got four former
players playing for the good old U.S. of
A. in the Olympics. Sounds good, huh?
What's the catch, you say? Why,
there's no catch. Life is good, you love
your job, things couldn't be better. Oh,
by the way, Coach, the season starts
tomorrow. Here's your roster.
What's that? There seem to be a lot
of freshmen on the team, you say? Well,
I guess it depends on how you define
"a lot." Now, some folks may think that
10 freshmen on a 21-man squad is a
bit too many, but don't worry, this team
still isn't the youngest you've ever had.
Which one was the youngest? Why,
the 1983 team, of course. You remember
1983. The team went 11-13-3 and wasn't
even invited to the NCAA tournament,
which remains the only time in your
coaching career that you haven't
finished among the top six teams in the
country. Hey, don't worry, that team
had five freshmen starters, for Pete's
sake. Trust me, Coach, it won't happen
again. Really.
What do you mean, "Where are my
seniors?" There he is right there, num
ber three. Where are the rest? Sorry,
chief, that's it. Seems the other mem
bers of the Class of '89 decided to play
something other than water polo. Yeah,
I know, I don't understand it either,
but there isn't much you can do about
it now. You've got a job to do.
Now, this shouldn't be too hard. All

you have to do is replace your two grad
uated All-Americas, Erich Fischer and
Matt Tingler, and you'll be ready to
roll. Of course, Fischer scored more
goals in '87 than any two of your other
players combined, so you might have a
little trouble finding someone to fill his
Speedo. Tingler was no slouch, either:
He finished tied for second on the team
in goals scored. Who'd he tie with?
Grant Stanley. Sorry, he's gone, too.
You say you found a bright spot? The
team's fourth-leading goal-scorer last
year was a junior? Well, coach, that's
true, but it seems he decided to redshirt
this year. Why? Basically, he took a
nice, long look at the roster and decided
it might be a little more fun to play
his final year in '89. Hey, it happens.
Now, c'mon, things aren't so bad. In
a nutshell, you have to field an incred
ibly young team, one that lost the
scorers of 165 of the squad's 264 goals
in 1987, against the nation's toughest
conference. How tough is the Pacific 10
in 1988? Let's just say that UCLA, Cal
ifornia and USC are in a zone of their
own this season. Everyone else is just
fighting for fourth-best. Well, there you
go, Coach. Have a great season!
Hello?
All right, all right, things aren't that
bad for Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti and his young charges. Yes, the
team does have 10 freshmen. Yes, the
team lost the two All-Americas and a
considerable amount of firepower from
a squad that finished sixth in the nation
in 1987, but that doesn't make 1988 a
lost cause.
"I think we're just a shade below the
top three teams — Cal, UCLA and
USC," Dettamanti said. "I do feel we're
capable of beating the top teams, but
we'd have to play almost perfect water
polo, an error-free game."

The polls apparently agree. The Car
dinal is currently ranked fourth in the
nation, right behind — you guessed it
— UCLA, Cal and USC, in that order.
If the Cardinal is such a young, inex
perienced team, then, why is it ranked
fourth in the country? One word: de
fense. "Our defense can stop just about
anybody," Dettamanti said. "Offensive
ly, we've got some work to do. During
the summer, we had some trouble
(scoring), but now we're starting to
score more."
The defense has been helped tremen
dously by the return of junior goalie
Todd Kemp, who redshirted the 1987
season to allow then-senior Obi Green
man to hold down the goaltending duties
on his own. Kemp, who has two years
of eligibity remaining, was a Second-
Team All-America as a freshman in
1985 and garnered First-Team All-
America honors in 1986, pacing the
team to a 36-0 record and its second
consecutive national championship.
Kemp's return bolsters a team that
plays excellent defense for its age. "You
would expect a young team to play bet
ter on offense, rather than on defense,"
Dettamanti said. "Defense is much
harder to learn. These guys are inex
perienced, but defense appears to be
their strength. And, of course, we've
got Todd Kemp in goal."
Even with a stingy defense, the team
still appears to be a season away from
returning to NCAA Championship
form, which explains senior Jeff
Oeding's decision to sit out 1988. "Jeff
feels that we have a much better shot
at winning a national title next year,"
according to Dettamanti. "I agree, I do
think we're going to be better next year.
We'll have a better chance to win the
title next season."

your job, things couldn't be better. Oh,
by the way, Coach, the season starts
tomorrow. Here's your roster.
What's that? There seem to be a lot
of freshmen on the team, you say? Well,
I guess it depends on how you define
"a lot." Now, some folks may think that
10 freshmen on a 21-man squad is a
bit too many, but don't worry, this team
still isn't the youngest you've ever had.
Which one was the youngest? Why,
the 1983 team, of course. You remember
1983. The team went 11-13-3 and wasn't
even invited to the NCAA tournament,
which remains the only time in your
coaching career that you haven't
finished among the top six teams in the
country. Hey, don't worry, that team
had five freshmen starters, for Pete's
sake. Trust me, Coach, it won't happen
again. Really.
What do you mean, "Where are my
seniors?" There he is right there, num
ber three. Where are the rest? Sorry,
chief, that's it. Seems the other mem
bers of the Class of '89 decided to play
something other than water polo. Yeah,
I know, I don't understand it either,
but there isn't much you can do about
it now. You've got a job to do.
Now, this shouldn't be too hard. All

you have to do is replace your two grad
uated All-Americas, Erich Fischer and
Matt Tingler, and you'll be ready to
roll. Of course, Fischer scored more
goals in '87 than any two of your other
players combined, so you might have a
little trouble finding someone to fill his
Speedo. Tingler was no slouch, either:
He finished tied for second on the team
in goals scored. Who'd he tie with?
Grant Stanley. Sorry, he's gone, too.
You say you found a bright spot? The
team's fourth-leading goal-scorer last
year was a junior? Well, coach, that's
true, but it seems he decided to redshirt
this year. Why? Basically, he took a
nice, long look at the roster and decided
it might be a little more fun to play
his final year in '89. Hey, it happens.
Now, c'mon, things aren't so bad. In
a nutshell, you have to field an incred
ibly young team, one that lost the
scorers of 165 of the squad's 264 goals
in 1987, against the nation's toughest
conference. How tough is the Pacific 10
in 1988? Let's just say that UCLA, Cal
ifornia and USC are in a zone of their
own this season. Everyone else is just
fighting for fourth-best. Well, there you
go, Coach. Have a great season!
Hello?
All right, all right, things aren't that
bad for Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti and his young charges. Yes, the
team does have 10 freshmen. Yes, the
team lost the two All-Americas and a
considerable amount of firepower from
a squad that finished sixth in the nation
in 1987, but that doesn't make 1988 a
lost cause.
"I think we're just a shade below the
top three teams — Cal, UCLA and
USC," Dettamanti said. "I do feel we're
capable of beating the top teams, but
we'd have to play almost perfect water
polo, an error-free game."

The polls apparently agree. The Car
dinal is currently ranked fourth in the
nation, right behind — you guessed it
— UCLA, Cal and USC, in that order.
If the Cardinal is such a young, inex
perienced team, then, why is it ranked
fourth in the country? One word: de
fense. "Our defense can stop just about
anybody," Dettamanti said. "Offensive
ly, we've got some work to do. During
the summer, we had some trouble
(scoring), but now we're starting to
score more."
The defense has been helped tremen
dously by the return of junior goalie
Todd Kemp, who redshirted the 1987
season to allow then-senior Obi Green
man to hold down the goaltending duties
on his own. Kemp, who has two years
of eligibity remaining, was a Second-
Team All-America as a freshman in
1985 and garnered First-Team All-
America honors in 1986, pacing the
team to a 36-0 record and its second
consecutive national championship.
Kemp's return bolsters a team that
plays excellent defense for its age. "You
would expect a young team to play bet
ter on offense, rather than on defense,"
Dettamanti said. "Defense is much
harder to learn. These guys are inex
perienced, but defense appears to be
their strength. And, of course, we've
got Todd Kemp in goal."
Even with a stingy defense, the team
still appears to be a season away from
returning to NCAA Championship
form, which explains senior Jeff
Oeding's decision to sit out 1988. "Jeff
feels that we have a much better shot
at winning a national title next year,"
according to Dettamanti. "I agree, I do
think we're going to be better next year.
We'll have a better chance to win the
title next season."

OK, pretend you're a water polo coach
at a semi-prestigious California univer
sity. You've got national championships
coming out your ears, you've been
named the conference Coach of the Year
so many times they might as well
rename the award in your honor, and
to top it all off you've got four former
players playing for the good old U.S. of
A. in the Olympics. Sounds good, huh?

there's no catch. Life is good, you love
