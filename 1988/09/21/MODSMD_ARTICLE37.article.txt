# Can field hockey break NCAA jinx?
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian 
Under the steady tutelage of
head coach and Olympic field
hockey team member Sheryl
Johnson, the Stanford women's
field hockey team is looking for
its fourth consecutive NCAA tour
nament berth.
Since Johnson took the head
coaching reins in 1985, the Car
dinal has compiled an amazing
32-15-3 record, and an even more
dominating 18-3-3 record in the
Northern Pacific Conference. In
addition, Stanford has taken the
NorPac title in all three of
Johnson's years as head coach.
While dominating the West
Coast, however, the squad has
failed to win any of its games in
the NCAA tournament, losing
most recently to Northwestern in
the 1987 tournament. Just as
Brooklyn Dodger afficionados

rallied 'round the cry of "Wait 'til
next year," Stanford field hockey
fans have been assigned the same
lot.
This could be "next year."
The squad returns two All-
Americans in 1988, senior
midfielder Allison Smith and
senior goalie Karen Jones. They
will form the nucleus of a team
that will have loads of experience
as well as talent.
Among the players to watch are:
senior forward Kat Thomas, an
all-NorPac selection for the last
two years, and seniors Laura
Gartl.id, Missy Jolley, and
Wanda Kay Key, who play for
ward, defender, and sweeper,
respectively.
Johnson has an optimistic out
look for the field hockey squad
this year, especially since she has
seven seniors, all of whom have
seen NCAA tournament action in

the past three years.
"We have shown in the last
three years that we can compete
with any team in the nation,"
Johnson said. "I think this team
is one of, if not the best ever at

'I think this team is
one of, if not the
best ever at Stan
ford.'

Stanford. We have seven seniors
who have experience at this level
and have improved each season.
I think we have the potential to
win our conference and advance
to the NCAA playoffs."

The team has already won its
first contest 2-0 this year against
the University of the Pacific in
Stockton. In that game junior for
ward Tracy Stieglitz and sopho
more forward Clare Stephens
scored the goals, while seniors
Dana Fleming and Laura Garland
were each credited with an assist.
Jones went the distance at
goalkeeper for the shutout.
Since their coach is currently
in Seoul, representing the United
States in field hockey, the squad
will he led by the assistant coach
ing triumvirate of Noelle Mitchell,
Suzanne Doi, and Andi Wolpert
until the Olympic games are over.
If they can continue their mo
mentum of the past three seasons
and their first game this season,
the Stanford field hockey team
could become a force to be
reckoned with nationally, not just
west of the Rockies.
