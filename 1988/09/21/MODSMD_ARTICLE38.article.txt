# UCLA, Card will battle for Pac-10 crown
## 
### Chris Crader 
Like their counterparts on the
gridiron, the Stanford women's
volleyball team starts Pacific 10
Conference play against the favor
ite.
Friday night marked the first
day of play in year three of the
Pac-10 for women's volleyball
and, while the match-up between
nationally No. 1-ranked UCLA
and the third-ranked Cardinal
was the league's first of the year,
it will hardly be the only quality
contest. The Pac-10 is again one
of the top two leagues in the na
tion, and a year of great volleyball
is certainly in store.
UCLA and Stanford have
finished one-two in the Pac-10 in
the two previous years of its ex
istence (the Bruins won in 1986,
the Cardinal in 1987), and will
likely top the league again, but
there will be eight other teams
giving them fits week in and week
out. Here then is a list of the
contenders and pretenders, top-to
bottom:
UCLA (4-0)
The Bruins got their season off
to the best possible start two
weeks ago, not only travelling to
Hawaii but also beating the top
two teams in the country. UCLA
beat then No. 2 Illinois in five
games, winning the fifth 15-2, to
open the tournament in Honolulu.
The following night UCLA beat
top-ranked Hawaii, winning the

fourth and final game 15-0 to se
cure the nation's top ranking.
The Bruins are led by the two
leading candidates for conference
Player-of-the-Year, senior setter
Ann Boyer and junior middle
blocker Daiva Tomkus. Other All-
America hopefuls include sopho
more Samantha Shaver, and top
freshmen Jenny Evans and Elaine
Youngs.
Stanford (5-0)
USC (6-1)
The Trojans came to town Sat
urday night ranked 12th and have
one of the best starting sixes in
the nation. Senior outside hitter
Nancy Hillman has led the Pac-10
in digs for two straight years and
is a strong passer and hitter.
Middle blocker Megan McCallister
led the league in hitting percent
age as a freshman last season
while Lonise Norfieet led in kills
average.
The Trojans' weakness is a
drop-off in talent beyond the top
six, and USC's big hope is to
remain healthy. Unfortunately
past history indicates otherwise;
— six Trojans have suffered
serious injuries over the past
three years.
Oregon (5-3)
Oregon got off to an 0-2 start
this season, but the losses were
to No. 2 Hawaii and No. 7 BYU
to get things rolling. The 11th
ranked Ducks also started slowly
each of the past two years but

have a pair of NCAA Tournament
berths to show for those seasons.
The Ducks just swept 14th
ranked San Diego State to win
Fullerton State's tournament and
junior outside hitter Michele
Krebsbach was the MVP.
Krebsbach was the Pac-10
Freshman-of-the-Year before
struggling through injuries last
season. If she stays healthy, and
junior classmate Stephanie
Snyder keeps the sweet sets com
ing, the Ducks will contend.
California (5-2)
The Bears came on strong at
the end of last season and have
started in '88 where they left off
in *87. With last year's national
Freshman-of-the-Year Holly
McPeak setting and her Mira
Costa High School teammate Lisa
Arce hitting, the Bears have one
of the top sophomore combina
tions in the country.
Tiffany Rochelle also returns on
the outside, but Cal has big holes
to fill in the middle to be a con
tender.
Arizona (5-1)
Arizona returns six players with
starting experience from last
year's 18-13 team, but that won't
be enough in the rugged Pac-10.
Setter Mary Linton is a key after
converting from outside hitter,
but the squad's experience should
help, as should the armswings of
outside hitters Julie Kakuska and
Terrv Lauchner.

Arizona State (6-0)
Senior outside hitter Christy
Nore has the Sun Devils off to
their best start since 1985 and is
clearly establishing her All-
America credentials. She is hitting
.412 and has 5.24 kills per game,
both second in the conference and
is fifth in digs. Setter Noelle
Fridrich is responding well to her
new starting position, and Dawn
Meidinger is playing well in the
middle, but they probably won't
be enough.
Washington (5-1)
The Huskies are led in almost
every category by AJI-Pac-10 se
lection Laurie Wetzel and have
four additional returning starters.
Unfortunately for them, the
starters coming back finished Bth
in the league last year. Looks like
they're in for more of the same.
Oregon State (7-5)
Despite having only five players
report for spring practice, and
only two freshmen recruits sign,
second-year mentor Guy Enriques
already has four more wins than
he had in all of 1987. It looks like
he needs walk-on help, but soph
omore Julie Leamon will try to
lead the Beavers to the promised
land — a non-last-place finish.
Washington State (9-3)
The Cougars are off to a great
start and have many players at
or near the top of all-league
statistical categories. Look for
that to change.

Freshman-of-the-Year before
struggling through injuries last
season. If she stays healthy, and
junior classmate Stephanie
Snyder keeps the sweet sets com
ing, the Ducks will contend.
California (5-2)
The Bears came on strong at
the end of last season and have
started in '88 where they left off
in *87. With last year's national
Freshman-of-the-Year Holly
McPeak setting and her Mira
Costa High School teammate Lisa
Arce hitting, the Bears have one
of the top sophomore combina
tions in the country.
Tiffany Rochelle also returns on
the outside, but Cal has big holes
to fill in the middle to be a con
tender.
Arizona (5-1)
Arizona returns six players with
starting experience from last
year's 18-13 team, but that won't
be enough in the rugged Pac-10.
Setter Mary Linton is a key after
converting from outside hitter,
but the squad's experience should
help, as should the armswings of
outside hitters Julie Kakuska and
Terrv Lauchner.

Arizona State (6-0)
Senior outside hitter Christy
Nore has the Sun Devils off to
their best start since 1985 and is
clearly establishing her All-
America credentials. She is hitting
.412 and has 5.24 kills per game,
both second in the conference and
is fifth in digs. Setter Noelle
Fridrich is responding well to her
new starting position, and Dawn
Meidinger is playing well in the
middle, but they probably won't
be enough.
Washington (5-1)
The Huskies are led in almost
every category by AJI-Pac-10 se
lection Laurie Wetzel and have
four additional returning starters.
Unfortunately for them, the
starters coming back finished Bth
in the league last year. Looks like
they're in for more of the same.
Oregon State (7-5)
Despite having only five players
report for spring practice, and
only two freshmen recruits sign,
second-year mentor Guy Enriques
already has four more wins than
he had in all of 1987. It looks like
he needs walk-on help, but soph
omore Julie Leamon will try to
lead the Beavers to the promised
land — a non-last-place finish.
Washington State (9-3)
The Cougars are off to a great
start and have many players at
or near the top of all-league
statistical categories. Look for
that to change.

Kristin Klein, one of the Fabulous Five Frosh on Stanford's women's
volleyball team, is one reason the Cardinal is expected to fly high
again in 1988.
Like their counterparts on the
gridiron, the Stanford women's
volleyball team starts Pacific 10
Conference play against the favor
ite.
Friday night marked the first
day of play in year three of the
Pac-10 for women's volleyball
and, while the match-up between
nationally No. 1-ranked UCLA
and the third-ranked Cardinal
was the league's first of the year,
it will hardly be the only quality
contest. The Pac-10 is again one
of the top two leagues in the na
tion, and a year of great volleyball
is certainly in store.
UCLA and Stanford have
finished one-two in the Pac-10 in
the two previous years of its ex
istence (the Bruins won in 1986,
the Cardinal in 1987), and will
likely top the league again, but
there will be eight other teams
giving them fits week in and week
out. Here then is a list of the
contenders and pretenders, top-to
bottom:
UCLA (4-0)
The Bruins got their season off
to the best possible start two
weeks ago, not only travelling to
Hawaii but also beating the top
two teams in the country. UCLA
beat then No. 2 Illinois in five
games, winning the fifth 15-2, to
open the tournament in Honolulu.
The following night UCLA beat
top-ranked Hawaii, winning the

fourth and final game 15-0 to se
cure the nation's top ranking.
The Bruins are led by the two
leading candidates for conference
Player-of-the-Year, senior setter
Ann Boyer and junior middle
blocker Daiva Tomkus. Other All-
America hopefuls include sopho
more Samantha Shaver, and top
freshmen Jenny Evans and Elaine
Youngs.
Stanford (5-0)
USC (6-1)
The Trojans came to town Sat
urday night ranked 12th and have
one of the best starting sixes in
the nation. Senior outside hitter
Nancy Hillman has led the Pac-10
in digs for two straight years and
is a strong passer and hitter.
Middle blocker Megan McCallister
led the league in hitting percent
age as a freshman last season
while Lonise Norfieet led in kills
average.
The Trojans' weakness is a
drop-off in talent beyond the top
six, and USC's big hope is to
remain healthy. Unfortunately
past history indicates otherwise;
— six Trojans have suffered
serious injuries over the past
three years.
Oregon (5-3)
Oregon got off to an 0-2 start
this season, but the losses were
to No. 2 Hawaii and No. 7 BYU
to get things rolling. The 11th
ranked Ducks also started slowly
each of the past two years but

have a pair of NCAA Tournament
berths to show for those seasons.
The Ducks just swept 14th
ranked San Diego State to win
Fullerton State's tournament and
junior outside hitter Michele
Krebsbach was the MVP.
