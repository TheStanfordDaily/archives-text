# Brad Cook brings character to the Cardinal

### Bruce Sarkisian 
Anyone who plays football must be ad
venturous. Who else would go out on a
100-yard patch of grass and submit them
selves to such punishment? But senior
cornerback Brad Cook has a lot more of
that swashbuckling spirit than even his
peers on the Stanford football team.
Cook, a junior college transfer last year,
expects to see a lot more game-time action
in his final season. He started in about
half the Cardinal's games last year, but
had a good spring season and has become
more acquainted with coach Jack Elway's
game plan.
Cook will also play the nickel-back po
sition, which is a fifth defensive back
used in a passing situation. Defensive
secondary coach Sonny Lubick expects
Cook to "be a real factor" this season.
At Snow Junior College in Utah, Cook
was a starter and was recruited by teams
like Brigham Young and Northwestern,
but chose to play at Stanford because he
wanted to play in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence rather than the Western Athletic
Conference.
But any conversation with Brad Cook
quickly turns away from football towards
his many other adventures and expedi
tions. He has packed a lot of experiences
into his 24 years.
While in high school, Cook lived in
Saudi Arabia with his parents because
his father was a principal in the inter
national school system. He lived in both
the deserts of Saudi Arabia and along
the more fertile Red Sea coast.
Cook said that most westerners have
"misconceptions" about life in a Middle-
Eastern country. He added that while all
women had to cover themselves up to
their ankles and wrists, they were not
required to wear the traditional Arabian
garb.
For the most part, "we lived in a city
situation," Cook said. Because westerners

were not allowed to attend Arab schools,
he went to American school, and some
times felt like he never left the United
States.
Cook and his family enjoyed their time
in the Middle East. Unlike many other
Americans, who felt like outsiders, his
family "appreciated the Saudi's culture
and they made us feel welcome."
Living in a foreign country and trans
ferring to a college in another state were
comparable experiences according to
Cook, but he took both in stride. "Neither
was really a problem," adding that "in
Saudi Arabia, I had my family (for sup
port), and I was older when I came to
Stanford."
Cook has a taste for the unusual, and
the desire to do things that have rarely
been done before. While living in the
Middle East, he went scuba diving in the
Red Sea, where very few divers had ven
tured before.
"It was an amazing experience. We
traveled three hours on a dirt road to
get to the place, and in the water every
thing was so beautiful and untouched,"
he said.
He also dove in the Persian Gulf, but
said that the experience was not so un
usual because many people had been
there before, and as a result had spoiled
the natural beauty by taking things from
the ocean.
As a member of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints, Cook went
on a mission to the Amish country of
Pennsylvania a few years ago. While part
of his time was spent teaching students
about his religion at Penn State Univer
sity, he spent some time living among
the Amish. Although the Amish have a
well-established religion of their own,
Cook and his partner helped them haul
hay and often told the Amish about the
Mormon faith.
