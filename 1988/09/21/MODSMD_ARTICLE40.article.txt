# Why the tie? Big Game 1892
## 
### 
Editor's note: The following
story is a reprint from the 1895
Quad, and gives some flavor of
the University's long tradition.
The author, Winifred Harper, was
a Quad staff member for its early
issues. The story ostensibly ex
plains the details surrounding the
tie between the Stanford Indians
and Cal Bears in 1892.
People wonder why it was a tie.
Some lay it to the Fates, others
to the Stanford coach or the
Berkeley mascot; the true story
has never yet been told.
Olive Vincey was visiting Stan
ford. She was a tall, supple girl,
with hair like burnished gold and
eyes of a peculiar, variable blue.
With her dazzling white skin and
queenly figure, she seemed a
statue animated by divine fire.
Miss Vincey was versatile, bril
liant, intense, though not without
the melancholy common to youth
ful reformers, who despair of a
wicked and refractory world. She
was used to the homage of men:
that nine-tenths of her masculine
acquaintances should fall in love
with her seemed natural — a sort
of requital to her for the task of
existing.

Though the Stanford youth all
adored her (despite her enthusi
astic loyalty to Berkeley), her fa
vorite was Harold Sommerville, a
senior in biology, hitherto consid
ered unsusceptible, except to the
wooing of science. He was a tall,
dark, athletic young fellow,
adored by girls, respected by his
professor, and admired by all as
the champion football player of
the Coast.
Into his love for Olive she threw
the strength and fervor hitherto
expended upon football — and
fishes. From roseate dreams of
the future he awoke to the sweeter
reality of woman — "a creature
half human, half divine" —
lovelier than a dream of fame and
more fascinating than science.
They had flirted at Coronado
— if flirting be strolling seaward
— discussing Browning, ranging
from Darwin to dress reform, yet
feeling an undercurrent of har
mony, which a few congenial souls
know. But that was during the
summer, and now college life,
with its exciting demands, claims
them. As Harold stands by a
variegated flowerbed in the Quad
rangle, this day before Thanks

giving, he is a complete stranger
to her heart. Olive's mocking eyes
are on a geranium in her hand.
The fact that Stanford's most
popular man has just declared his
love seems not to disconcert her
in the ieast. Throwing down the
red geranium, she picks two blue
and yellow blossoms. "I came near
deserting my colors," she mur
murs. "Don't be flippant, dear,"
he says; "answer my question."
A mischievious sparkle flashes
from her eyes. "Prove your love,"
she challenges: "I am yours, if —
Berkeley wins tommorrow."
The championship game was to
be the next day, and upon Som
merville chiefly depended Stan
ford's victory. Yesterday, he
would have staked his life that
his college might win; today, he
knew that his happiness depended
upon Stanford's losing.
Hamlet's struggles seemed
puerile compared to his. All night
his pride and honor struggled with
his love. He saw himself borne
upon the boys' shoulders, victori
ous, as Olive's fair face faded away
into cloud-wreaths and disap
peared. Again, he was the happy
recipient of her beaming smiles,

while his Alma Mater cast him
out-of-doors — in disgrace.

Though the heavens poured
forth rainy invectives against
football, the amphitheater was
filled with a mass of moving car
dinal, blue and yellow, resembling
a titanic crazy quilt, agitated by
voluble pigmies. The rain poured,
the crowd roared and mammoth
tin-horns slivered the air with
their din.

Then began the game. Twenty
two mothers' darlings rushed into
the arena, in padded trousers,
false noses, and disordered hair,
to begin their task of mutual
mutilation. From a Berkeley tally
ho Olive viewed the game, with
an expression of triumph, which
became one of startled displeasure
as it progressed.
Never was such playing seen
before. The men fought like tigers
for every inch, while Sommerville,

with compressed lips and pallid
face, played magnificently. It was
Stanford luck against Berkeley
pluck. The "UC's" were ahead.
Time was flying. The Stanfords,
within a few feet of the goal were
forced back by sheer strength.
Suddenly, with head down, Som
merville dashed through the line,
striking men away with sledge
hammer blows. A Berkeleyan had
