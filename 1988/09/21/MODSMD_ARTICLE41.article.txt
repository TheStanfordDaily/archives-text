# Cross country teams put '87 behind them
## 
### Cameron Macky 
Last fall Stanford cross country
coach Brooks Johnson described
1987 as a "redirection" year for
his young men's and women's
teams. The two squads, with only
one senior on each, were expected
to take their lumps while gaining
valuable experience.
Well, folks, the teams seem to
have "redirected" themselves
quite well. As the 1988 season
gets underway, the Cardinal har
riers have the look of two vastly
improved squads. Although nei
ther team qualified for the NCAA
Championships in '87, Johnson
feels that both the men and
women will be back in champion
ship form this season.
"Given decent health, I think
this year will mark the return to
prominence of the Stanford cross
country program," Johnson said,
reins of the men's team to Scott
Chisam, will count on junior Carol
Gray to provide leadership for a
women's squad that is still quite
young.

Gray is hoping to return to her
form of 1986, when she placed
25th at the NCAA Championships
and was accorded Ail-America
honors. Although slowed by inju
ries early in 1987, Gray still came
on at the end of the season to
place fifth at the Pacific-10 Cham
pionships. After a fine 1988 track
season, Gray appears poised to
take her position among the na
tion's top distance runners.
For the men's contingent, first
year Coach Scott Chisam sees only
bright days ahead. "We've had un
derclassmen dominate our lineup
the last two years," Chisam said,
"but this year I feel we have trans
ferred youth into experience."
Leading the way will be senior
James Alborough, who was Stan
ford's top finisher in each of the
three races he participated in last
season. Along with the Mastalir
twins, juniors Eric and Marc, and
a highly-touted freshman class,
the Cardinal seem prepared to
return to their Pac-10 Champion
ship form of 1985.
