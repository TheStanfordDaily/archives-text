After demolishing a weaker Foothill
team 6-0 in a pre-season scrimmage
Sept. 7, Stanford's women's soccer
looked ready to hit Southern California
for a road trip that included scrimmages
against UCLA and San Bernardino and
matches against Pomona and UC-
Irvine.
After winning both scrimmages, the
team trounced Pomona 11-0 in a game
that wasn't as close as the score, and
then tied Irvine the next day 0-0.
The games showed the patience and
confidence with which second-year
coach Berhane Andeberhan and his
team are approaching the season.
Since his arrival shortly before the

beginning of last season, Andeberhan
has worked on strengthening the wom
en's soccer program, both through in
tense physical and tactical preparation
of his players and vigorous recruiting.
His efforts have paid off well.
"He's worked them really hard," ac
cording to manager Erica Deese-
Dobson. "Each time-period since he
came — fall to winter, winter to spring,
spring to fall — the workouts have got
ten increasingly more difficult."
In one year, Andeberhan has brought
in several talented freshmen, notably
Junior National Team member Heather
Mclntyre. Yet, according to Andeber
han, the key stength of this rejuvenated
program is the players that were here
before his arrival.

"The upperclassmen have not only
shown exceptional development in just
one year, they have provided a very
professional, team work-ethic for the
new players to follow. They are deter
mined and dedicated," he said.
Attacking up front will be speedy
sophomore Jen Rowland, supported by
junior Tonya Antonnucci providing
pressure from her midfield position.
Also looking good up front are seniors
Beth Egan and Stacey Keare, with soph
omores Denise Denney and Jen Bloomer
completing a talented midfield.
Stanford will have a strong backfield,
with the returning combination of
senior Christy McDevitt at stopper and
sophomore Elise Edwards at goalkeeper.
