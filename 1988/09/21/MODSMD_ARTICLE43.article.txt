# Sailing team off to decent start
## 
### 
While many Stanford students were
enjoying the last month of summer va
cation, the Stanford sailing team began
its fall training by competing in two
major regattas on the East Coast in
early September at Yale and King's
Point, finishing 11th in both events
among an outstanding field of teams.
After the successes of the 1987-88
season, many observers were looking
forward to more of the same from the
Cardinal squad this fall.
Unfortunately, the team lost 11
seniors to graduation in June, including
1988 All-American Tom Kuhnle, and
1988 All-American crew Kathleen
Mallery.
"It's really tough to lose so many top

sailors at one time," noted Stanford
Head Coach Blake Middleton.
The first event, the Harry Anderson
Regatta hosted by Yale University over
Labor Day weekend, marks the tradi
tional start of the fall competitive
season in New England. Senior Hugh
Bethell was joined by junior Robert
Brown and sophomores Sarah Gannett,
Scott Dale and Dave Dowd for the regat
ta.
Dale and Bethell made the best of it
in A-Division, but found themeselves
far too heavy in crew weight to be com
petitive in the light breezes Saturday.
In B-Division, however, Dowd and
Gannett were setting the pace for the
Cardinal, eventually finishing the day

in sixth place.
One weekend later, the five Cardinal
sailors were joined by crew members
Kim Grose and Jonathan Schreiber,
both juniors, as the team competed in
the annual Nevins Trophy regatta at
King's Point in New York.
Kim Grose sailed in A-Division and
found the going tough in a talent-laden
fleet. In B-division, Dale teamed with
Jon Schreiber and found the pace almost
immediately, finishing sixth in the di
vision.
"Seven of the top 10 teams in the
country were sailing in both regattas,"
he said, "and we were sailing in boats
that we only get to sail in a couple of
times a year."
