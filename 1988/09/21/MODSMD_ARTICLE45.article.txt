# Tuning up for the Bay Area music scene
## 
### Mia Manzulli 
Whether you want to sing, be
serenaded, or just listen to some
good tunes, Stanford and the rest
of the Bay Area offers some fan
tastic musical opportunities.
Frojm a capella campus singing
groups like Mixed Company to
blues guitarist Stevie Ray
Vaughan at the nearby Concord
Pavilion, Bay Area entertainment
is ais diverse as it is lively.
Right on campus you can find
five amazing student singing
i groups that give dorm concerts,
I do impromptu songs in dining
i rooms, and deliver romantic
] Valentine's Day serenades to your
| sweetheart. The two all-male
! groups, Fleet Street Singers and
the Mendicants are particularly
i popular around Valentine's Day
Fleet Street is a group of 14
I guys who love to sing and who

bill themselves as "an all male a
capella audio visual performance
extravaganza." Whether it be at
your first dorm meeting or their
annual spring concert, this group
puts a lot of energy into their
song (and sometimes even dance)
routines, making one of their
performances well worth your
while. And their matching
saloonkeeper outfits don't take
away from their charm — or sing
ing talent — one bit!
The Mendicants, Stanford's
other all-male group, has a
slightly different slant than Fleet
Street: these guys are much more
casual and perform without the
prepared routines of the other
group. Equally as talented, these
16 vocalists will make your heart
melt with their renditions of
"Stand by Me," and Yaz's "Only
You" (the most frequently re
quested for serenades!).
Men at Stanford don't corner

the market on singing, however.
Counterpoint boasts 12 talented
women who are just as comfort
able singing in front of a large
lunch crowd at Tresidder as they
are in the shower. "Blue Moon"
is one of their specialties.
A couple of years ago, someone
had the bright idea to bring both
sexes together in one singing
group. The result is the wonder
fully talented and popular Mixed
Company. After a successful tour
of the East Coast last spring
break, Mixed Company is raring
to go. With smooth routines, an
incredible range of voices, and a
great sense of humor, Mixed Com
pany has an impressive repertoire.
With the success of one "mixed"
group, why not try another?
Everyday People is the baby of
the bunch, singing their favorites
and yours. Motown, reggae, in
spirationals, jazz — interesting
and euphonic selections.

With this wide array of a capella
originals to choose from, you'll
certainly be fans in no time. (I
myself confess to being a Men
dicant groupie sophomore year.)
Some events to look forward to
are the Big Game Sing-Off, when
the groups of Stanford meet the
best that Berkeley has to offer,
and visits from the likes of Prince
ton's Footnotes or Yale's Red Hot
and Blue. And don't forget, all
the Stanford groups are looking
for new members — stop singing
in the shower and go out and
audition!
Also around campus are the
Stanford Glee Club, the Stanford
University Gospel Choir, and the
Stanford Chorale. These groups
perform annually for the public,
often in such awe-inspiring set
tings as Memorial Church. And
like the a capella groups, these
singing ensembles welcome mem
bers who are serious about their
music.
Oh, yeah . .. there is another
on-campus group that you've
probably already heard (of): the
übiquitous LSJUMB, or quite
simply, the Band. Stanford stu
dents rally behind this rather un
orthodox marching band. Indeed
many will follow the strains of
music and "Come follow the
band" on one of its campus treks.
It may just be "the world's largest
rock and roll band." Decide for
yourself!
If loud band music isn't your
style, take a look at The Lively
Arts. A season of jazz, dance,
chamber music, solo recitals, and
ethnic and early music begins Oc
tober 8 with the American Indian
Dance Theater. Expect the Duke
Ellington orchestra, Mum
menschanz and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra to make ap
pearances throughout the year.
All Lively Arts productions are
held in either Dinkelspiel Audito
rium or Memorial Auditorium and
tickets can be obtained through
the Tresidder Ticket Office.
Ticket prices are often high for
the student budget, but remember
to look for student rates and last
call ticket reductions on the night
of the show. All events are well

advertised and promoted as well.
Although Stanford is not known
for headline entertainment (i.e.
you won't find the Talking Heads
or U2 setting up in the stadium
any time soon), one renowned
group does make an annual ap
pearance here. The Grateful Dead
(and their entourage) make a trip
to Frost Amphitheater every May
for two shows one weekend.

The Bay Area does not lack in
big-name entertainment ... you
just have to travel off-campus to
find it. U2 and Billy Joel have
appeared at the Oakland Coliseum
and the Boss came to the nearby
Shoreline Amphitheater last
spring. Keep your ears open for
news of your favorite performers
— a BASS ticket outlet is located
afctfresidder.
