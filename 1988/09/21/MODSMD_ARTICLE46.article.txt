What museums are to Florence, the
theater is to San Francisco.
No matter how much people talk
about San Francisco opera, or the City's
night clubs, it is the area's hundreds
of theater groups that validate San
Francisco's claim to the West Coast cul
tural supremacy.
The most important activity takes
place in the many small theater groups
scattered around San Francisco and
Berkeley, but first let's start closer to
home.
The Stanford Drama Department
presents a mtyor play each quarter with
production usually taking place in the
Little Theater located behind Memorial
Auditorium. The productions are de
signed and directed by members of the
department, but cast auditions are open
to the public and students from fields
other than drama are often cast.
In addition to the msyor productions,
the department sponsors Graduate
Directing Workshops, "no frills" produc
tions directed by the students. These
free shows are held in The Nitery, in
the Old Union.
There are several successful on-going,
student-run production companies on
the campus. Chief among these is Ram's
Head, which produces Gaieties, a com
edy revue during Big Game week in the
fall. The show — filled with jokes, silly
puns and numerous sexual innuendos
— gears up the campus to beat Cal.
Ram's Head also produces the student
written Winter One Acts during winter
quarter and a musical production
each spring.
The Company is a smaller group with
a more flexible production schedule,
where individual initiative counts most
in determining what plays are produced
and when. The Company's productions
vary greatly in scope, ranging in recent
years from the elaborate stagings of

"Hair" and "Jesus Christ Superstar" to
a traveling troupe that went from dorm
to dorm performing "The Fantasticks"
in lounges.
The Black Performing Arts Group
and the Asian American Theater Proj
ect also produce plays, usually concen
trating their efforts on spring quarter.
Several years ago, the AATP put on the
first performance anywhere of David
Henry Hwang's FOB, a play that was
later produced, to critical acclaim, by
Joseph Papp in New York.
All of the student production com
panies rely, of course, on student ability
in all areas: performance, direction, set
and lighting, costume work and promo
tion. Announcements regarding audi
tions and support positions appear in
The Daily and in fliers posted around
campus.
Spring quarter is the prime time for
dorm productions. Most of the larger
dorms, along with some of the ambitious
small ones, put on plays at this time.
The repertoire is drawn mainly from
Broadway comedies and musicals. Over
the years, some dorms have gained a
reputation for the lavishness of their
productions: Branner, Toyon, Roble and
Lagunita all are famous in this regard.
In San Francisco, the American Con
servatory Theatre, or ACT, ranks as
one of the country's best regional
theaters. Its presence in the Geary
Theatre, at 450 Geary in the City,
makes Geary Street the heart of the
Theater district. Few companies in the
Bay Area, or even on the East Coast
(outside of Shakespeare festival groups)
can rival the ACT in performance, fa
cilities or reputation.
The ACT is an arch-conservative com
pany: they go heavy on the classics, and
the modern (meaning 19205) plays they
do perform tend to be of the sparkling
British wit (Noel Coward) or the folksy-

American ("I Remember Mama" "Ah!
Wilderness") kind. But they are nearly
always a joy to watch, because no one
puts polish on a production these days
like the ACT. The company's annuaJ
rendering of "A Christmas Carol" is a
gem.
The big money in San Francisco
theater is tied up in Carole
Shorenstein's two "Best of Broadway"
series. "Best of Broadway" plays in
three different theaters: the Golden
Gate, 25 Taylor St.; the Orpheum, 1192
Market St.; and the Curran, 445 Geary
St. (next door to the ACT). All three
host traveling productions of Broadway
hits.
Smaller-scale New York successes, will
sometimes be brought to Theatre on
the Square or the Marine's Memorial
Theatre, both located in the Geary dis
trict near Union Square.
Although it does not often receive
much publicity, the bulk of theatrical
activity in San Francisco is centered
around the smaller, semi-professional
theaters. It is here that most of the
local actors work, where the local au
thors often have their plays first per
formed and where the local technicians
get to try out their ideas. They are
often referred to as the "99 seat"
theaters, because by limiting themselves
to fewer than 100 seats, they may avoid
Equity (i.e. union) pay scales and they
may mount new productions at rela
tively little cost.
The size of these theaters also bring
benefits to the audience. Spaces this
size offer an intimacy and intensity that
is almost never attained in a large
theater. There is often no extravagant
stage; sometimes just a space on the
floor surrounded by seats. The tradi
tional distance between the audience
