Eat, Drink and be Merry
Ah, eat, drink and be merry. . .
we've heard it so many times
before. But it's only after the
novelty of dorm dining wears off
that we decide to "experience"
good food — and in abundance!

Fortunately, food lovers, the
Stanford area offers a multitude
of dining opportunities that range
from the cheap and casual to the
upbeat and pricey. With health
food, sushi, French cuisine and
Mexican (just to name a few of
your options) to choose from, it's
easy to find just about whatever
you may be craving — even if it's
pizza topped with coconut and

raisins. (Hint: try the Applewood
Inn's sweet, but tasty, white piz
za.)
Pizza pie
Speaking of pizza, which only
New Yorkers seem to know as
"pies," there are several good
spots for indulging. Topping
everyone's list as the absolute
best (but the farthest from
campus) is Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi T00(939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View). The pizza crust
is divine and the toppings are all
quite good. Expect a wait to be
seated (on weekends) and avoid
the Italian dinners which don't
even come close to the pizza.
A little closer to home is
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) which boasts "New York
style" pizza. Although the pizza
is generally good, it is nothing
like real New York pizza, which
is actually paper thin and would
not come near pineapple and
Canadian bacon for all the pasta
in Italy! Ramona's, nonetheless,
is fairly thick crusted (opt for the
whole wheat crust) with spicy
sauce and generous toppings.
Fresh spinach adds a unique and
delicious twist. Expect to wait and
to see lots of fellow Stanford stu
dents.
Also downtown is the funky
Pizza-A-Go-Go (335 University
Ave) that conveniently offers
pizza-by-the-slice. Good crust, not
too spicy sauce, and lots of cheese
— give it a try!
And, don't overlook the Ap
plewood Inn (1001 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) with its gour
met pizza toppings. The outside

of the Applewood Inn doesn't look
inviting. Don't be deceived, like I
was. The artichokes on a veggie
combo pizza make this place spe
cial.
Something Smells Fishy
As close as Stanford is to the
Pacific Ocean, you should expect
some great seafood restaurants —
and you won't be disappointed.
The most accessible, reasonable
and casual is The Fish Market
(3150 El Camino) which offers
super fresh fish from an ever
changing daily menu. Great red
snapper and grilled swordfish!
Scott's Seafood Grill and Bar
(2300 E. Bayshore Rd.) is more
formal. Also on the dressy (and
more expensive) side is Theo's
(546 University) which has fresh
fish, as well as pasta and chicken.
Also downtown is the interesting
Pearl's Oyster Bar (535 Ramona
Avo.) with its grotto-like entry
way.
Mange Bene!
Palo Alto has cornered the mar
ket on good local Italian eateries.
The big three — Osteria, La Pas
taia and Cenzo's offer great Ital
ian dinners in a variety of atmo
spheres, all in the medium price
range ($6-12). Osteria (247
Hamilton Ave.) is crowded, busy
and lively (reservations a must)
with great fresh pasta, especially
the gnocchi. Cenzo's (233 Univer
sity Ave.) is more casual and cafe
like, with great bread and good
seafood and pasta combinations.
La Pasatia (420 Emerson Ave.) is
the most elegant of the three, and

the chef here pays close attention
to food presentation. You certainly
can't go wrong with any of them.
Over at the Stanford Shopping
Center, two more Italian restau
rants await. The cafe-like Bravo
Fono (99 Stanford Shopping Cen
ter) has pretty outdoor dining and
a sleek interior with good salads,
fresh fish and pasta. The more
traditional Mama's is a nice fam
ily or date place to go for dinner.
One more place you might like
to try is the relatively new La
Galleria (73 Town and Country
Village) which offers fine North
ern Italian cuisine, with a touch
of Swiss influence in a casual, but
pretty atmosphere.
Sandwiches and Such
In my opinion, the best place
around for sandwiches and other
deli items is the Stanford
De!icatesscn(B3 Stanford Shop
ping Center). The huge assort
ment of salads behind the counter
(pasta with shrimp being my fa
vorite) keeps you busy while
waiting for your number to be
called. Big sandwiches with just
about anything you want — from
turkey on whole wheat to a real
pastrami on rye— are the norm.
A real Stanford tradition is get
ting Togo's (University Ave) sand
wiches for tailgaters, dorm meet
ings or just a quick meal. These
heroes, subs, grinders, come in a
variety of sizes to easily feed the
hungry crowds. The vegetarian
combo is not bad, although I'm
partial to the turkey . . .

South of the Border
Local Mexican restaurants are
known more for their festive
atmospheres than for excellent
food, but you can find good,
hearty meals for a reasonable
price at many of these popular
spots. Judging from the number
of Stanford students who frequent
Compadres (3877 El Camino),
you know they are doing some
thing right. That something is
probably the tasty margaritas . . .
good salsa too! Along the same
lines is El Torito (4470 El
Camino), a popular place for
Senior Pub Nights.
A lively newcomer to the
Mexican scene is the El Dorado
Cafe(42o Ramona) where
nouveau Mexican food, tequila
shots and a boisterous crowd
make for a fun evening. Best if
you're with a large group!
Chili's (700 El Camino, Menlo
Park) is another spot where you'll
find many fellow students — prob
ably waiting in line for a table
with you! It's casual, with great
margaritas and soft tacos.
If a lack of atmosphere doesn't
bother you, try Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Avenue, Redwood City)
It's a whole-in-the-wall, but the
authentic Mexican cuisine makes
up for it. Fun with a group, and
Rosita's has a great selection of
Mexican beers. If you don't mind
sitting on benches outside watch
ing El Camino traffic go by Senor
Taco (3490 El Camino) is fast,
good and cheap — with a wide
selection. The pink taco stand
with cactus in front serves great

carne asada's for under $3.
Finally, there's Macheesmo
Mouit(27l University Ave), an
airy counter service restaurant
atmosphere — it tends to get quite
noisy inside. Crayons and paper
keep you busy while waiting for
your food which will be good, but
nothing special. Try the deca
dently rich turtle pie for dessert
— it will make up for your ordi
nary meal!
Another busy and yuppie-like
spot is the new Max's Opera Cafe
(711 Stanford Shopping Center).
The food is quite good and comes
in huge portions — the desserts
are amazing so save room! The
waiters and waitresses sing
Broadway show-stoppers, provid
ing non-stop and enjoyable enter
tainment!
The California Cafe (Stanford
Barn) is another lively spot with
great grilled chicken and fish, and

a variety of pasta and salads. It's
sleek and chic and smells wonder
ful. A slightly dressier crowd than
Max's . . .
By far the most elegant is The
Gatehouse (256 Lytton), another
great spot for special occasions.
The outdoor dining and chic bar
make it an attractive (if more ex
pensive) restaurant.
Wake-Me-Ups
The absolute best breakfast
place around is Hobee's (67 Town
and Country Village or 4224 El
Camino Real) with its amazing
blueberry coffeecake and cinna
mon tea — both are truly addic
tive. Trust me! Hobee's has great
omelets and egg scrambles, as well
as pancakes and homemade
granola. Don't miss out on their
energy blends either — yogurt
shakes with fresh strawberries,
bananas or blueberries.
Another old favorite is Late For
the Train (150 Middlefield, Menlo
Park) where pancakes are big and
fluffy and the maple syrup is the
real thing! Scones are a specialty,

French toast is divine, and the
blintzes are delicious. Expect to
wait for seating at both these
places, especially on the weekends.
For a quick bite, head to
Suzanne's Muffins (376 Univer
sity) where you can't miss with
the bran bran bran, the oatmeal
chocolate chip, the blueberry, the
apple cinnamon, the corn . . . get
the picture? Another treat is TJ.
Cinnamons (170 University) for
delicious warm cinnamon rolls
that will absolutely melt in your
mouth. If bagels are your thing,
then The Bagel Works (129 Lyt
ton) is the place to be. It's not
an eaterie like the other places,
but a great place to run in and
grab some fresh from the oven
and still warm chewy bagels. Can
you say "Raisin and cinnamon?"
Health Conscious
If you're a healthy eater (and
who isn't these days?) two local
spots will be of interest to you.
First there's Croutons (379 Uni

versity) where you'll spot many a
Stanford woman . . . Crouton's is
a salad bar. A large salad bar,
with just about everything you
could want on a salad. They also
have soups (not as good as the
salad stuff) and fresh fruit (always
good) and amazing bran muffins,
scones, rye bread, and sourdough
... all for one price, help-yourself
style. Indulge, without feeling
guilty. There is also a frozen yo
gurt stand in the front.
Another good choice is The
Good Earth (185 University)
which even has its own bakery
selection at the counter. Good
soups, hearty sandwiches and
tasty yogurt shakes make this
spot a winner. This place gets
quite crowded at dinner where
you'll often find a slightly older
crowd than at Croutons.
French Finds
For excellent crepes and pretty
outdoor dining try Le Mersault
(651 Emerson Street), "Palo
Alto's wine restaurant." A great
wine selection complements the
delicate crepes and desserts for a
wonderful meal. Also serving fine
French food (and at reasonable
prices) is Le Pot Au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park) with its
country-kitchen atmosphere and
simple, well-prepared dishes.
French dining can be an elegant
affair in the Stanford area as well.
The more formal (and expensive)
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino) is
a definte local institution. With
dance music and its country inn
atmosphere, Chez Louis provides
a lovely dining experience. An
other more expensive treat is
Chantilly (530 Ramona) for when
you feel like going out in style.
Burgers and Fries
When you're in the mood for a
hamburger but just can't stomach
the thought of McDonald's try
Pudlcy's (255 University Avenue)
or the Alpine Beer Garden (3915
Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
more commonly known as Zott's.
Zott's has great french fries and
serves rectangular hamburgers to
its loyal customers. The beer flows
and the jukebox plays on . . .
Fro Yo
You will quickly learn that
everything at Stanford is ab
breviated and frozen yogurt is no

exception. However you choose to
say it, it's good and it is abundant.
For convenience (but small selec
tion) The Corner Pocket right on
campus is a popular choice. At
least you can walk there! My usual
stop is Cool Licks (449 Emerson)
which usually offers 8 flavors,
many of them non-fat. There are
many tempting toppings to choose
from as well. As I mentioned ear
lier, Croutons also serves fro yo,
albeit with a limited selection of
flavors. Another possible spot is
Yogurt Village (Stanford Shop
ping Center) where they serve
non-fat and regular Yovi as well
as a super 10-cal treat called creme
glace.
The Grand Finale
Palo Alto is just dripping with
ice cream places, each one more

tantalizing than the next. There
are the standard Baskin Robbing
and Swensen's (University Ave.),
but they must compete with the
more gormet chains Haagen-Daz
(Stanford Barn) and the new
Double Rainbow (Ramona, Palo
Alto). In addition, there is Blatz
(101 California Ave, Palo Alto),
the king of folded ice cream
(choose your own mix-ins). Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream (Charles
ton, at Middlefiled, Palo Alto) and
the Peninsula Creamery (corner
of Hamilton and Emerson, Palo
Alto) round out the group. And
there's always the milkshakes at
the 24-kour Creamery (209 Uni
versity) which are made with
Bud's ice cream, (warning: the
food at the Creamery is lethal.)


Rod Searcy — Daily file
From the kitchen at Sako's restaurant the chef serves fine French
cuisine.
If gelato is more you style, try
Gelato Classico (437 Emerson)
where the white chocolate pistac
hio, the dark chocolate and the
banana walnut flavors are intense.
There's also Perche Non (Lid
dicoats, University Avenue) gelato
— Kahlua anyone? Italian ice
cream can't be beat — just in
dulge!
How About All-American Atmos
phere?
A Stanford favorite for pre
formal dinners and other special
occasions is the upscale and
trendy Mac Arthur Park (27 Uni
versity). Barbequed ribs are the
specialty although I prefer the
grilled chicken or fish of the day.
Expect a yuppie crowd, still
dressed from work, and a lively
with "healthy fast food." A con
tradiction in terms? Find out for
yourself!

Chinese proverbs
Although Chinatown in San
Francisco can't be beat, the Palo
Alto area boasts many of its own
fine Chinese restaurants. One of
my favorites is the often over
looked China Delight (3691 El
Camino) which has amazing
hunan chicken and a great mu
shu chicken, pork, shrimp or eggs.
It's never crowded, has good serv
ice and tons of food — what more
could you ask?
If cheap is what you're looking
for, then Chung King Royal (2209
El Camino) is the place. Don't
worry, the food is good and plenti
ful. And you can even ride your
bike there. But don't expect lavish
surroundings.
An old Stanford favorite is Chef
Chu's (1067 N. San Antonio Rd,
at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
It's always crowded and a good
place for big groups who have dif
ferent tastes. The food is good, if
unexciting. A new favorite is the
Szechuzan/Hunan restaurant
Jing-Jing's (443 Emerson, Palo

Alto), that is within biking dis
tance. Try the hot and sour soup
for a super taste sensation! Also
a stone's throw away from
campus is King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village) which offers
many dishes for the vegetarian
palate, as well as Szechuan and
Peking specialties.
Sushi Anyone?
If hot-tubbing and sushi sound
like a great combination then
head to Watercourse Way (165
Channing, Palo Alto) where both
are a specialty. Reservations may
be needed for the hot-tub rooms
next door . . .
One of the best sushi spots
around is Miyake (261 Uni
veristy) where the food is good
and not too expensive. On the
more pricey side is Fuki-Sushi
(4119 El Camino) with full sushi
bar and Tatami rooms.
For a little action with your
sushi, try Shogun (4390 El
Camino, Los Altos) where skilled
Japanese knife-artists prepare
food for you on your table.
Eat, Drink and be Merry

It's never crowded, has good serv
ice and tons of food — what more
could you ask?
If cheap is what you're looking
for, then Chung King Royal (2209
El Camino) is the place. Don't
worry, the food is good and plenti
ful. And you can even ride your
bike there. But don't expect lavish
surroundings.
An old Stanford favorite is Chef
Chu's (1067 N. San Antonio Rd,
at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
It's always crowded and a good
place for big groups who have dif
ferent tastes. The food is good, if
unexciting. A new favorite is the
Szechuzan/Hunan restaurant
Jing-Jing's (443 Emerson, Palo

Alto), that is within biking dis
tance. Try the hot and sour soup
for a super taste sensation! Also
a stone's throw away from
campus is King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village) which offers
many dishes for the vegetarian
palate, as well as Szechuan and
Peking specialties.
Sushi Anyone?
If hot-tubbing and sushi sound
like a great combination then
head to Watercourse Way (165
Channing, Palo Alto) where both
are a specialty. Reservations may
be needed for the hot-tub rooms
next door . . .
One of the best sushi spots
around is Miyake (261 Uni
veristy) where the food is good
and not too expensive. On the
more pricey side is Fuki-Sushi
(4119 El Camino) with full sushi
bar and Tatami rooms.
For a little action with your
sushi, try Shogun (4390 El
Camino, Los Altos) where skilled
Japanese knife-artists prepare
food for you on your table.
Eat, Drink and be Merry
Ah, eat, drink and be merry. . .
we've heard it so many times
before. But it's only after the
novelty of dorm dining wears off
that we decide to "experience"
good food — and in abundance!

Fortunately, food lovers, the
Stanford area offers a multitude
of dining opportunities that range
from the cheap and casual to the
upbeat and pricey. With health
food, sushi, French cuisine and
Mexican (just to name a few of
your options) to choose from, it's
easy to find just about whatever
you may be craving — even if it's
pizza topped with coconut and

raisins. (Hint: try the Applewood
Inn's sweet, but tasty, white piz
za.)
Pizza pie
Speaking of pizza, which only
New Yorkers seem to know as
"pies," there are several good
spots for indulging. Topping
everyone's list as the absolute
best (but the farthest from
campus) is Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi T00(939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View). The pizza crust
is divine and the toppings are all
quite good. Expect a wait to be
seated (on weekends) and avoid
the Italian dinners which don't
even come close to the pizza.
A little closer to home is
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) which boasts "New York
style" pizza. Although the pizza
is generally good, it is nothing
like real New York pizza, which
is actually paper thin and would
not come near pineapple and
Canadian bacon for all the pasta
in Italy! Ramona's, nonetheless,
is fairly thick crusted (opt for the
whole wheat crust) with spicy
sauce and generous toppings.
Fresh spinach adds a unique and
delicious twist. Expect to wait and
to see lots of fellow Stanford stu
dents.
Also downtown is the funky
Pizza-A-Go-Go (335 University
Ave) that conveniently offers
pizza-by-the-slice. Good crust, not
too spicy sauce, and lots of cheese
— give it a try!
And, don't overlook the Ap
plewood Inn (1001 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) with its gour
met pizza toppings. The outside

of the Applewood Inn doesn't look
inviting. Don't be deceived, like I
was. The artichokes on a veggie
combo pizza make this place spe
cial.
Something Smells Fishy
As close as Stanford is to the
Pacific Ocean, you should expect
some great seafood restaurants —
and you won't be disappointed.
The most accessible, reasonable
and casual is The Fish Market
(3150 El Camino) which offers
super fresh fish from an ever
changing daily menu. Great red
snapper and grilled swordfish!
Scott's Seafood Grill and Bar
(2300 E. Bayshore Rd.) is more
formal. Also on the dressy (and
more expensive) side is Theo's
(546 University) which has fresh
fish, as well as pasta and chicken.
Also downtown is the interesting
Pearl's Oyster Bar (535 Ramona
Avo.) with its grotto-like entry
way.
Mange Bene!
Palo Alto has cornered the mar
ket on good local Italian eateries.
The big three — Osteria, La Pas
taia and Cenzo's offer great Ital
ian dinners in a variety of atmo
spheres, all in the medium price
range ($6-12). Osteria (247
Hamilton Ave.) is crowded, busy
and lively (reservations a must)
with great fresh pasta, especially
the gnocchi. Cenzo's (233 Univer
sity Ave.) is more casual and cafe
like, with great bread and good
seafood and pasta combinations.
La Pasatia (420 Emerson Ave.) is
the most elegant of the three, and

the chef here pays close attention
to food presentation. You certainly
can't go wrong with any of them.
Over at the Stanford Shopping
Center, two more Italian restau
rants await. The cafe-like Bravo
Fono (99 Stanford Shopping Cen
ter) has pretty outdoor dining and
a sleek interior with good salads,
fresh fish and pasta. The more
traditional Mama's is a nice fam
ily or date place to go for dinner.
One more place you might like
to try is the relatively new La
Galleria (73 Town and Country
Village) which offers fine North
ern Italian cuisine, with a touch
of Swiss influence in a casual, but
pretty atmosphere.
Sandwiches and Such
In my opinion, the best place
around for sandwiches and other
deli items is the Stanford
De!icatesscn(B3 Stanford Shop
ping Center). The huge assort
ment of salads behind the counter
(pasta with shrimp being my fa
vorite) keeps you busy while
waiting for your number to be
called. Big sandwiches with just
about anything you want — from
turkey on whole wheat to a real
pastrami on rye— are the norm.
A real Stanford tradition is get
ting Togo's (University Ave) sand
wiches for tailgaters, dorm meet
ings or just a quick meal. These
heroes, subs, grinders, come in a
variety of sizes to easily feed the
hungry crowds. The vegetarian
combo is not bad, although I'm
partial to the turkey . . .

South of the Border
Local Mexican restaurants are
known more for their festive
atmospheres than for excellent
food, but you can find good,
hearty meals for a reasonable
price at many of these popular
spots. Judging from the number
of Stanford students who frequent
Compadres (3877 El Camino),
you know they are doing some
thing right. That something is
probably the tasty margaritas . . .
good salsa too! Along the same
lines is El Torito (4470 El
Camino), a popular place for
Senior Pub Nights.
A lively newcomer to the
Mexican scene is the El Dorado
Cafe(42o Ramona) where
nouveau Mexican food, tequila
shots and a boisterous crowd
make for a fun evening. Best if
you're with a large group!
Chili's (700 El Camino, Menlo
Park) is another spot where you'll
find many fellow students — prob
ably waiting in line for a table
with you! It's casual, with great
margaritas and soft tacos.
If a lack of atmosphere doesn't
bother you, try Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Avenue, Redwood City)
It's a whole-in-the-wall, but the
authentic Mexican cuisine makes
up for it. Fun with a group, and
Rosita's has a great selection of
Mexican beers. If you don't mind
sitting on benches outside watch
ing El Camino traffic go by Senor
Taco (3490 El Camino) is fast,
good and cheap — with a wide
selection. The pink taco stand
with cactus in front serves great


Todd Sitrin — Daily file
carne asada's for under $3.
Finally, there's Macheesmo
Mouit(27l University Ave), an
airy counter service restaurant
atmosphere — it tends to get quite
noisy inside. Crayons and paper
keep you busy while waiting for
your food which will be good, but
nothing special. Try the deca
dently rich turtle pie for dessert
— it will make up for your ordi
nary meal!
Another busy and yuppie-like
spot is the new Max's Opera Cafe
(711 Stanford Shopping Center).
The food is quite good and comes
in huge portions — the desserts
are amazing so save room! The
waiters and waitresses sing
Broadway show-stoppers, provid
ing non-stop and enjoyable enter
tainment!
The California Cafe (Stanford
Barn) is another lively spot with
great grilled chicken and fish, and

a variety of pasta and salads. It's
sleek and chic and smells wonder
ful. A slightly dressier crowd than
Max's . . .
By far the most elegant is The
Gatehouse (256 Lytton), another
great spot for special occasions.
The outdoor dining and chic bar
make it an attractive (if more ex
pensive) restaurant.
Wake-Me-Ups
The absolute best breakfast
place around is Hobee's (67 Town
and Country Village or 4224 El
Camino Real) with its amazing
blueberry coffeecake and cinna
mon tea — both are truly addic
tive. Trust me! Hobee's has great
omelets and egg scrambles, as well
as pancakes and homemade
granola. Don't miss out on their
energy blends either — yogurt
shakes with fresh strawberries,
bananas or blueberries.
Another old favorite is Late For
the Train (150 Middlefield, Menlo
Park) where pancakes are big and
fluffy and the maple syrup is the
real thing! Scones are a specialty,

French toast is divine, and the
blintzes are delicious. Expect to
wait for seating at both these
places, especially on the weekends.
For a quick bite, head to
Suzanne's Muffins (376 Univer
sity) where you can't miss with
the bran bran bran, the oatmeal
chocolate chip, the blueberry, the
apple cinnamon, the corn . . . get
the picture? Another treat is TJ.
Cinnamons (170 University) for
delicious warm cinnamon rolls
that will absolutely melt in your
mouth. If bagels are your thing,
then The Bagel Works (129 Lyt
ton) is the place to be. It's not
an eaterie like the other places,
but a great place to run in and
grab some fresh from the oven
and still warm chewy bagels. Can
you say "Raisin and cinnamon?"
Health Conscious
If you're a healthy eater (and
who isn't these days?) two local
spots will be of interest to you.
First there's Croutons (379 Uni

versity) where you'll spot many a
Stanford woman . . . Crouton's is
a salad bar. A large salad bar,
with just about everything you
could want on a salad. They also
have soups (not as good as the
salad stuff) and fresh fruit (always
good) and amazing bran muffins,
scones, rye bread, and sourdough
... all for one price, help-yourself
style. Indulge, without feeling
guilty. There is also a frozen yo
gurt stand in the front.
Another good choice is The
Good Earth (185 University)
which even has its own bakery
selection at the counter. Good
soups, hearty sandwiches and
tasty yogurt shakes make this
spot a winner. This place gets
quite crowded at dinner where
you'll often find a slightly older
crowd than at Croutons.
French Finds
For excellent crepes and pretty
outdoor dining try Le Mersault
(651 Emerson Street), "Palo
Alto's wine restaurant." A great
wine selection complements the
delicate crepes and desserts for a
wonderful meal. Also serving fine
French food (and at reasonable
prices) is Le Pot Au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park) with its
country-kitchen atmosphere and
simple, well-prepared dishes.
French dining can be an elegant
affair in the Stanford area as well.
The more formal (and expensive)
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino) is
a definte local institution. With
dance music and its country inn
atmosphere, Chez Louis provides
a lovely dining experience. An
other more expensive treat is
Chantilly (530 Ramona) for when
you feel like going out in style.
Burgers and Fries
When you're in the mood for a
hamburger but just can't stomach
the thought of McDonald's try
Pudlcy's (255 University Avenue)
or the Alpine Beer Garden (3915
Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
more commonly known as Zott's.
Zott's has great french fries and
serves rectangular hamburgers to
its loyal customers. The beer flows
and the jukebox plays on . . .
Fro Yo
You will quickly learn that
everything at Stanford is ab
breviated and frozen yogurt is no

exception. However you choose to
say it, it's good and it is abundant.
For convenience (but small selec
tion) The Corner Pocket right on
campus is a popular choice. At
least you can walk there! My usual
stop is Cool Licks (449 Emerson)
which usually offers 8 flavors,
many of them non-fat. There are
many tempting toppings to choose
from as well. As I mentioned ear
lier, Croutons also serves fro yo,
albeit with a limited selection of
flavors. Another possible spot is
Yogurt Village (Stanford Shop
ping Center) where they serve
non-fat and regular Yovi as well
as a super 10-cal treat called creme
glace.
The Grand Finale
Palo Alto is just dripping with
ice cream places, each one more

tantalizing than the next. There
are the standard Baskin Robbing
and Swensen's (University Ave.),
but they must compete with the
more gormet chains Haagen-Daz
(Stanford Barn) and the new
Double Rainbow (Ramona, Palo
Alto). In addition, there is Blatz
(101 California Ave, Palo Alto),
the king of folded ice cream
(choose your own mix-ins). Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream (Charles
ton, at Middlefiled, Palo Alto) and
the Peninsula Creamery (corner
of Hamilton and Emerson, Palo
Alto) round out the group. And
there's always the milkshakes at
the 24-kour Creamery (209 Uni
versity) which are made with
Bud's ice cream, (warning: the
food at the Creamery is lethal.)


Rod Searcy — Daily file
From the kitchen at Sako's restaurant the chef serves fine French
cuisine.
If gelato is more you style, try
Gelato Classico (437 Emerson)
where the white chocolate pistac
hio, the dark chocolate and the
banana walnut flavors are intense.
There's also Perche Non (Lid
dicoats, University Avenue) gelato
— Kahlua anyone? Italian ice
cream can't be beat — just in
dulge!
How About All-American Atmos
phere?
A Stanford favorite for pre
formal dinners and other special
occasions is the upscale and
trendy Mac Arthur Park (27 Uni
versity). Barbequed ribs are the
specialty although I prefer the
grilled chicken or fish of the day.
Expect a yuppie crowd, still
dressed from work, and a lively
with "healthy fast food." A con
tradiction in terms? Find out for
yourself!

Chinese proverbs
Although Chinatown in San
Francisco can't be beat, the Palo
Alto area boasts many of its own
fine Chinese restaurants. One of
my favorites is the often over
looked China Delight (3691 El
Camino) which has amazing
hunan chicken and a great mu
shu chicken, pork, shrimp or eggs.
It's never crowded, has good serv
ice and tons of food — what more
could you ask?
If cheap is what you're looking
for, then Chung King Royal (2209
El Camino) is the place. Don't
worry, the food is good and plenti
ful. And you can even ride your
bike there. But don't expect lavish
surroundings.
An old Stanford favorite is Chef
Chu's (1067 N. San Antonio Rd,
at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
It's always crowded and a good
place for big groups who have dif
ferent tastes. The food is good, if
unexciting. A new favorite is the
Szechuzan/Hunan restaurant
Jing-Jing's (443 Emerson, Palo

Alto), that is within biking dis
tance. Try the hot and sour soup
for a super taste sensation! Also
a stone's throw away from
campus is King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village) which offers
many dishes for the vegetarian
palate, as well as Szechuan and
Peking specialties.
Sushi Anyone?
If hot-tubbing and sushi sound
like a great combination then
head to Watercourse Way (165
Channing, Palo Alto) where both
are a specialty. Reservations may
be needed for the hot-tub rooms
next door . . .
One of the best sushi spots
around is Miyake (261 Uni
veristy) where the food is good
and not too expensive. On the
more pricey side is Fuki-Sushi
(4119 El Camino) with full sushi

For a little action with your

(101 California Ave, Palo Alto),
the king of folded ice cream
(choose your own mix-ins). Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream (Charles
ton, at Middlefiled, Palo Alto) and
the Peninsula Creamery (corner
of Hamilton and Emerson, Palo
Alto) round out the group. And
there's always the milkshakes at
the 24-kour Creamery (209 Uni
versity) which are made with
Bud's ice cream, (warning: the
food at the Creamery is lethal.)


Rod Searcy — Daily file
From the kitchen at Sako's restaurant the chef serves fine French
cuisine.
If gelato is more you style, try
Gelato Classico (437 Emerson)
where the white chocolate pistac
hio, the dark chocolate and the
banana walnut flavors are intense.
There's also Perche Non (Lid
dicoats, University Avenue) gelato
— Kahlua anyone? Italian ice
cream can't be beat — just in
dulge!
How About All-American Atmos
phere?
A Stanford favorite for pre
formal dinners and other special
occasions is the upscale and
trendy Mac Arthur Park (27 Uni
versity). Barbequed ribs are the
specialty although I prefer the
grilled chicken or fish of the day.
Expect a yuppie crowd, still
dressed from work, and a lively
with "healthy fast food." A con
tradiction in terms? Find out for
yourself!

Chinese proverbs
Although Chinatown in San
Francisco can't be beat, the Palo
Alto area boasts many of its own
fine Chinese restaurants. One of
my favorites is the often over
looked China Delight (3691 El
Camino) which has amazing
hunan chicken and a great mu
shu chicken, pork, shrimp or eggs.
It's never crowded, has good serv
ice and tons of food — what more
could you ask?
If cheap is what you're looking
for, then Chung King Royal (2209
El Camino) is the place. Don't
worry, the food is good and plenti
ful. And you can even ride your
bike there. But don't expect lavish
surroundings.
An old Stanford favorite is Chef
Chu's (1067 N. San Antonio Rd,
at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
It's always crowded and a good
place for big groups who have dif
ferent tastes. The food is good, if
unexciting. A new favorite is the
Szechuzan/Hunan restaurant
Jing-Jing's (443 Emerson, Palo

Alto), that is within biking dis
tance. Try the hot and sour soup
for a super taste sensation! Also
a stone's throw away from
campus is King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village) which offers
many dishes for the vegetarian
palate, as well as Szechuan and
Peking specialties.
Sushi Anyone?
If hot-tubbing and sushi sound
like a great combination then
head to Watercourse Way (165
Channing, Palo Alto) where both
are a specialty. Reservations may
be needed for the hot-tub rooms
next door . . .
One of the best sushi spots
around is Miyake (261 Uni
veristy) where the food is good
and not too expensive. On the
more pricey side is Fuki-Sushi
(4119 El Camino) with full sushi
bar and Tatami rooms.
For a little action with your
sushi, try Shogun (4390 El
Camino, Los Altos) where skilled
Japanese knife-artists prepare
food for you on your table.
Eat, Drink and be Merry
Ah, eat, drink and be merry. . .
we've heard it so many times
before. But it's only after the
novelty of dorm dining wears off
that we decide to "experience"
good food — and in abundance!

Fortunately, food lovers, the
Stanford area offers a multitude
of dining opportunities that range
from the cheap and casual to the
upbeat and pricey. With health
food, sushi, French cuisine and
Mexican (just to name a few of
your options) to choose from, it's
easy to find just about whatever
you may be craving — even if it's
pizza topped with coconut and

raisins. (Hint: try the Applewood
Inn's sweet, but tasty, white piz
za.)
Pizza pie
Speaking of pizza, which only
New Yorkers seem to know as
"pies," there are several good
spots for indulging. Topping
everyone's list as the absolute
best (but the farthest from
campus) is Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi T00(939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View). The pizza crust
is divine and the toppings are all
quite good. Expect a wait to be
seated (on weekends) and avoid
the Italian dinners which don't
even come close to the pizza.
A little closer to home is
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) which boasts "New York
style" pizza. Although the pizza
is generally good, it is nothing
like real New York pizza, which
is actually paper thin and would
not come near pineapple and
Canadian bacon for all the pasta
in Italy! Ramona's, nonetheless,
is fairly thick crusted (opt for the
whole wheat crust) with spicy
sauce and generous toppings.
Fresh spinach adds a unique and
delicious twist. Expect to wait and
to see lots of fellow Stanford stu
dents.
Also downtown is the funky
Pizza-A-Go-Go (335 University
Ave) that conveniently offers
pizza-by-the-slice. Good crust, not
too spicy sauce, and lots of cheese
— give it a try!
And, don't overlook the Ap
plewood Inn (1001 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) with its gour
met pizza toppings. The outside

of the Applewood Inn doesn't look
inviting. Don't be deceived, like I
was. The artichokes on a veggie
combo pizza make this place spe
cial.
Something Smells Fishy
As close as Stanford is to the
Pacific Ocean, you should expect
some great seafood restaurants —
and you won't be disappointed.
The most accessible, reasonable
and casual is The Fish Market
(3150 El Camino) which offers
super fresh fish from an ever
changing daily menu. Great red
snapper and grilled swordfish!
Scott's Seafood Grill and Bar
(2300 E. Bayshore Rd.) is more
formal. Also on the dressy (and
more expensive) side is Theo's
(546 University) which has fresh
fish, as well as pasta and chicken.
Also downtown is the interesting
Pearl's Oyster Bar (535 Ramona
Avo.) with its grotto-like entry
way.
Mange Bene!
Palo Alto has cornered the mar
ket on good local Italian eateries.
The big three — Osteria, La Pas
taia and Cenzo's offer great Ital
ian dinners in a variety of atmo
spheres, all in the medium price
range ($6-12). Osteria (247
Hamilton Ave.) is crowded, busy
and lively (reservations a must)
with great fresh pasta, especially
the gnocchi. Cenzo's (233 Univer
sity Ave.) is more casual and cafe
like, with great bread and good
seafood and pasta combinations.
La Pasatia (420 Emerson Ave.) is
the most elegant of the three, and

the chef here pays close attention
to food presentation. You certainly
can't go wrong with any of them.
Over at the Stanford Shopping
Center, two more Italian restau
rants await. The cafe-like Bravo
Fono (99 Stanford Shopping Cen
ter) has pretty outdoor dining and
a sleek interior with good salads,
fresh fish and pasta. The more
traditional Mama's is a nice fam
ily or date place to go for dinner.
One more place you might like
to try is the relatively new La
Galleria (73 Town and Country
Village) which offers fine North
ern Italian cuisine, with a touch
of Swiss influence in a casual, but
pretty atmosphere.
Sandwiches and Such
In my opinion, the best place
around for sandwiches and other
deli items is the Stanford
De!icatesscn(B3 Stanford Shop
ping Center). The huge assort
ment of salads behind the counter
(pasta with shrimp being my fa
vorite) keeps you busy while
waiting for your number to be
called. Big sandwiches with just
about anything you want — from
turkey on whole wheat to a real
pastrami on rye— are the norm.
A real Stanford tradition is get
ting Togo's (University Ave) sand
wiches for tailgaters, dorm meet
ings or just a quick meal. These
heroes, subs, grinders, come in a
variety of sizes to easily feed the
hungry crowds. The vegetarian
combo is not bad, although I'm
partial to the turkey . . .

South of the Border
Local Mexican restaurants are
known more for their festive
atmospheres than for excellent
food, but you can find good,
hearty meals for a reasonable
price at many of these popular
spots. Judging from the number
of Stanford students who frequent
Compadres (3877 El Camino),
you know they are doing some
thing right. That something is
probably the tasty margaritas . . .
good salsa too! Along the same
lines is El Torito (4470 El
Camino), a popular place for
Senior Pub Nights.
A lively newcomer to the
Mexican scene is the El Dorado
Cafe(42o Ramona) where
nouveau Mexican food, tequila
shots and a boisterous crowd
make for a fun evening. Best if
you're with a large group!
Chili's (700 El Camino, Menlo
Park) is another spot where you'll
find many fellow students — prob
ably waiting in line for a table
with you! It's casual, with great
margaritas and soft tacos.
If a lack of atmosphere doesn't
bother you, try Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Avenue, Redwood City)
It's a whole-in-the-wall, but the
authentic Mexican cuisine makes
up for it. Fun with a group, and
Rosita's has a great selection of
Mexican beers. If you don't mind
sitting on benches outside watch
ing El Camino traffic go by Senor
Taco (3490 El Camino) is fast,
good and cheap — with a wide
selection. The pink taco stand
with cactus in front serves great

carne asada's for under $3.
Finally, there's Macheesmo
Mouit(27l University Ave), an
airy counter service restaurant
atmosphere — it tends to get quite
noisy inside. Crayons and paper
keep you busy while waiting for
your food which will be good, but
nothing special. Try the deca
dently rich turtle pie for dessert
— it will make up for your ordi
nary meal!
Another busy and yuppie-like
spot is the new Max's Opera Cafe
(711 Stanford Shopping Center).
The food is quite good and comes
in huge portions — the desserts
are amazing so save room! The
waiters and waitresses sing
Broadway show-stoppers, provid
ing non-stop and enjoyable enter
tainment!
The California Cafe (Stanford
Barn) is another lively spot with
great grilled chicken and fish, and

a variety of pasta and salads. It's
sleek and chic and smells wonder
ful. A slightly dressier crowd than
Max's . . .
By far the most elegant is The
Gatehouse (256 Lytton), another
great spot for special occasions.
The outdoor dining and chic bar
make it an attractive (if more ex
pensive) restaurant.
Wake-Me-Ups
The absolute best breakfast
place around is Hobee's (67 Town
and Country Village or 4224 El
Camino Real) with its amazing
blueberry coffeecake and cinna
mon tea — both are truly addic
tive. Trust me! Hobee's has great
omelets and egg scrambles, as well
as pancakes and homemade
granola. Don't miss out on their
energy blends either — yogurt
shakes with fresh strawberries,
bananas or blueberries.
Another old favorite is Late For
the Train (150 Middlefield, Menlo
Park) where pancakes are big and
fluffy and the maple syrup is the
real thing! Scones are a specialty,

French toast is divine, and the
blintzes are delicious. Expect to
wait for seating at both these
places, especially on the weekends.
For a quick bite, head to
Suzanne's Muffins (376 Univer
sity) where you can't miss with
the bran bran bran, the oatmeal
chocolate chip, the blueberry, the
apple cinnamon, the corn . . . get
the picture? Another treat is TJ.
Cinnamons (170 University) for
delicious warm cinnamon rolls
that will absolutely melt in your
mouth. If bagels are your thing,
then The Bagel Works (129 Lyt
ton) is the place to be. It's not
an eaterie like the other places,
but a great place to run in and
grab some fresh from the oven
and still warm chewy bagels. Can
you say "Raisin and cinnamon?"
Health Conscious
If you're a healthy eater (and
who isn't these days?) two local
spots will be of interest to you.
First there's Croutons (379 Uni

versity) where you'll spot many a
Stanford woman . . . Crouton's is
a salad bar. A large salad bar,
with just about everything you
could want on a salad. They also
have soups (not as good as the
salad stuff) and fresh fruit (always
good) and amazing bran muffins,
scones, rye bread, and sourdough
... all for one price, help-yourself
style. Indulge, without feeling
guilty. There is also a frozen yo
gurt stand in the front.
Another good choice is The
Good Earth (185 University)
which even has its own bakery
selection at the counter. Good
soups, hearty sandwiches and
tasty yogurt shakes make this
spot a winner. This place gets
quite crowded at dinner where
you'll often find a slightly older
crowd than at Croutons.
French Finds
For excellent crepes and pretty
outdoor dining try Le Mersault
(651 Emerson Street), "Palo
Alto's wine restaurant." A great
wine selection complements the
delicate crepes and desserts for a
wonderful meal. Also serving fine
French food (and at reasonable
prices) is Le Pot Au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park) with its
country-kitchen atmosphere and
simple, well-prepared dishes.
French dining can be an elegant
affair in the Stanford area as well.
The more formal (and expensive)
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino) is
a definte local institution. With
dance music and its country inn
atmosphere, Chez Louis provides
a lovely dining experience. An
other more expensive treat is
Chantilly (530 Ramona) for when
you feel like going out in style.
Burgers and Fries
When you're in the mood for a
hamburger but just can't stomach
the thought of McDonald's try
Pudlcy's (255 University Avenue)
or the Alpine Beer Garden (3915
Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
more commonly known as Zott's.
Zott's has great french fries and
serves rectangular hamburgers to
its loyal customers. The beer flows
and the jukebox plays on . . .
Fro Yo
You will quickly learn that
everything at Stanford is ab
breviated and frozen yogurt is no

exception. However you choose to
say it, it's good and it is abundant.
For convenience (but small selec
tion) The Corner Pocket right on
campus is a popular choice. At
least you can walk there! My usual
stop is Cool Licks (449 Emerson)
which usually offers 8 flavors,
many of them non-fat. There are
many tempting toppings to choose
from as well. As I mentioned ear
lier, Croutons also serves fro yo,
albeit with a limited selection of
flavors. Another possible spot is
Yogurt Village (Stanford Shop
ping Center) where they serve
non-fat and regular Yovi as well
as a super 10-cal treat called creme
glace.
The Grand Finale
Palo Alto is just dripping with
ice cream places, each one more

tantalizing than the next. There
are the standard Baskin Robbing
and Swensen's (University Ave.),
but they must compete with the
more gormet chains Haagen-Daz
(Stanford Barn) and the new
Double Rainbow (Ramona, Palo
Alto). In addition, there is Blatz
(101 California Ave, Palo Alto),
the king of folded ice cream
(choose your own mix-ins). Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream (Charles
ton, at Middlefiled, Palo Alto) and
the Peninsula Creamery (corner
of Hamilton and Emerson, Palo
Alto) round out the group. And
there's always the milkshakes at
the 24-kour Creamery (209 Uni
versity) which are made with
Bud's ice cream, (warning: the
food at the Creamery is lethal.)


Rod Searcy — Daily file
From the kitchen at Sako's restaurant the chef serves fine French

If gelato is more you style, try
Gelato Classico (437 Emerson)
where the white chocolate pistac
hio, the dark chocolate and the
banana walnut flavors are intense.
There's also Perche Non (Lid
dicoats, University Avenue) gelato
— Kahlua anyone? Italian ice

An old Stanford favorite is Chef
Chu's (1067 N. San Antonio Rd,

It's always crowded and a good
place for big groups who have dif

unexciting. A new favorite is the
Szechuzan/Hunan restaurant
Jing-Jing's (443 Emerson, Palo

Alto), that is within biking dis
tance. Try the hot and sour soup
for a super taste sensation! Also
a stone's throw away from
campus is King Chuan (75 Town

many dishes for the vegetarian
palate, as well as Szechuan and
Peking specialties.

other more expensive treat is
Chantilly (530 Ramona) for when
you feel like going out in style.
Burgers and Fries
When you're in the mood for a
hamburger but just can't stomach
the thought of McDonald's try
Pudlcy's (255 University Avenue)
or the Alpine Beer Garden (3915
Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
more commonly known as Zott's.
Zott's has great french fries and
serves rectangular hamburgers to
its loyal customers. The beer flows
and the jukebox plays on . . .
Fro Yo
You will quickly learn that
everything at Stanford is ab
breviated and frozen yogurt is no

exception. However you choose to
say it, it's good and it is abundant.
For convenience (but small selec
tion) The Corner Pocket right on
campus is a popular choice. At
least you can walk there! My usual
stop is Cool Licks (449 Emerson)
which usually offers 8 flavors,
many of them non-fat. There are
many tempting toppings to choose
from as well. As I mentioned ear
lier, Croutons also serves fro yo,
albeit with a limited selection of
flavors. Another possible spot is
Yogurt Village (Stanford Shop
ping Center) where they serve
non-fat and regular Yovi as well
as a super 10-cal treat called creme
glace.
The Grand Finale
Palo Alto is just dripping with
ice cream places, each one more

tantalizing than the next. There
are the standard Baskin Robbing
and Swensen's (University Ave.),
but they must compete with the
more gormet chains Haagen-Daz
(Stanford Barn) and the new
Double Rainbow (Ramona, Palo
Alto). In addition, there is Blatz
(101 California Ave, Palo Alto),
the king of folded ice cream
(choose your own mix-ins). Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream (Charles
ton, at Middlefiled, Palo Alto) and
the Peninsula Creamery (corner
of Hamilton and Emerson, Palo
Alto) round out the group. And
there's always the milkshakes at
the 24-kour Creamery (209 Uni
versity) which are made with
Bud's ice cream, (warning: the
food at the Creamery is lethal.)


Rod Searcy — Daily file
From the kitchen at Sako's restaurant the chef serves fine French
cuisine.
If gelato is more you style, try
Gelato Classico (437 Emerson)
where the white chocolate pistac
hio, the dark chocolate and the
banana walnut flavors are intense.
There's also Perche Non (Lid
dicoats, University Avenue) gelato
— Kahlua anyone? Italian ice
cream can't be beat — just in
dulge!
How About All-American Atmos
phere?
A Stanford favorite for pre
formal dinners and other special
occasions is the upscale and
trendy Mac Arthur Park (27 Uni
versity). Barbequed ribs are the
specialty although I prefer the
grilled chicken or fish of the day.
Expect a yuppie crowd, still
dressed from work, and a lively
with "healthy fast food." A con
tradiction in terms? Find out for
yourself!

Chinese proverbs
Although Chinatown in San
Francisco can't be beat, the Palo
Alto area boasts many of its own
fine Chinese restaurants. One of
my favorites is the often over
looked China Delight (3691 El
Camino) which has amazing
hunan chicken and a great mu
shu chicken, pork, shrimp or eggs.
It's never crowded, has good serv
ice and tons of food — what more
could you ask?
If cheap is what you're looking
for, then Chung King Royal (2209
El Camino) is the place. Don't
worry, the food is good and plenti
ful. And you can even ride your
bike there. But don't expect lavish
surroundings.
An old Stanford favorite is Chef
Chu's (1067 N. San Antonio Rd,
at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
It's always crowded and a good
place for big groups who have dif
ferent tastes. The food is good, if
unexciting. A new favorite is the
Szechuzan/Hunan restaurant
Jing-Jing's (443 Emerson, Palo

Alto), that is within biking dis
tance. Try the hot and sour soup
for a super taste sensation! Also
a stone's throw away from
campus is King Chuan (75 Town
and Country Village) which offers
many dishes for the vegetarian
palate, as well as Szechuan and
Peking specialties.
Sushi Anyone?
If hot-tubbing and sushi sound
like a great combination then
head to Watercourse Way (165
Channing, Palo Alto) where both
are a specialty. Reservations may
be needed for the hot-tub rooms
next door . . .
One of the best sushi spots
around is Miyake (261 Uni
veristy) where the food is good
and not too expensive. On the
more pricey side is Fuki-Sushi
(4119 El Camino) with full sushi
bar and Tatami rooms.
For a little action with your
sushi, try Shogun (4390 El
Camino, Los Altos) where skilled
Japanese knife-artists prepare
food for you on your table.
Eat, Drink and be Merry
Ah, eat, drink and be merry. . .
we've heard it so many times
before. But it's only after the
novelty of dorm dining wears off
that we decide to "experience"
good food — and in abundance!

Fortunately, food lovers, the
Stanford area offers a multitude
of dining opportunities that range
from the cheap and casual to the
upbeat and pricey. With health
food, sushi, French cuisine and
Mexican (just to name a few of
your options) to choose from, it's
easy to find just about whatever
you may be craving — even if it's
pizza topped with coconut and

raisins. (Hint: try the Applewood
Inn's sweet, but tasty, white piz
za.)
Pizza pie
Speaking of pizza, which only
New Yorkers seem to know as
"pies," there are several good
spots for indulging. Topping
everyone's list as the absolute
best (but the farthest from
campus) is Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi T00(939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View). The pizza crust
is divine and the toppings are all
quite good. Expect a wait to be
seated (on weekends) and avoid
the Italian dinners which don't
even come close to the pizza.
A little closer to home is
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) which boasts "New York
style" pizza. Although the pizza
is generally good, it is nothing
like real New York pizza, which
is actually paper thin and would
not come near pineapple and
Canadian bacon for all the pasta
in Italy! Ramona's, nonetheless,
is fairly thick crusted (opt for the
whole wheat crust) with spicy
sauce and generous toppings.
Fresh spinach adds a unique and
delicious twist. Expect to wait and
to see lots of fellow Stanford stu
dents.
Also downtown is the funky
Pizza-A-Go-Go (335 University
Ave) that conveniently offers
pizza-by-the-slice. Good crust, not
too spicy sauce, and lots of cheese
— give it a try!
And, don't overlook the Ap
plewood Inn (1001 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) with its gour
met pizza toppings. The outside

of the Applewood Inn doesn't look
inviting. Don't be deceived, like I
was. The artichokes on a veggie
combo pizza make this place spe
cial.
Something Smells Fishy
As close as Stanford is to the
Pacific Ocean, you should expect
some great seafood restaurants —
and you won't be disappointed.
The most accessible, reasonable
and casual is The Fish Market
(3150 El Camino) which offers
super fresh fish from an ever
changing daily menu. Great red
snapper and grilled swordfish!
Scott's Seafood Grill and Bar
(2300 E. Bayshore Rd.) is more
formal. Also on the dressy (and
more expensive) side is Theo's
(546 University) which has fresh
fish, as well as pasta and chicken.
Also downtown is the interesting
Pearl's Oyster Bar (535 Ramona
Avo.) with its grotto-like entry
way.
Mange Bene!
Palo Alto has cornered the mar
ket on good local Italian eateries.
The big three — Osteria, La Pas
taia and Cenzo's offer great Ital
ian dinners in a variety of atmo
spheres, all in the medium price
range ($6-12). Osteria (247
Hamilton Ave.) is crowded, busy
and lively (reservations a must)
with great fresh pasta, especially
the gnocchi. Cenzo's (233 Univer
sity Ave.) is more casual and cafe
like, with great bread and good
seafood and pasta combinations.
La Pasatia (420 Emerson Ave.) is
the most elegant of the three, and

the chef here pays close attention
to food presentation. You certainly
can't go wrong with any of them.
Over at the Stanford Shopping
Center, two more Italian restau
rants await. The cafe-like Bravo
Fono (99 Stanford Shopping Cen
ter) has pretty outdoor dining and
a sleek interior with good salads,
fresh fish and pasta. The more
traditional Mama's is a nice fam
ily or date place to go for dinner.
One more place you might like
to try is the relatively new La
Galleria (73 Town and Country
Village) which offers fine North
ern Italian cuisine, with a touch
of Swiss influence in a casual, but
pretty atmosphere.
Sandwiches and Such
In my opinion, the best place
around for sandwiches and other
deli items is the Stanford
De!icatesscn(B3 Stanford Shop
ping Center). The huge assort
ment of salads behind the counter
(pasta with shrimp being my fa
vorite) keeps you busy while
waiting for your number to be
called. Big sandwiches with just
about anything you want — from
turkey on whole wheat to a real
pastrami on rye— are the norm.
A real Stanford tradition is get
ting Togo's (University Ave) sand
wiches for tailgaters, dorm meet
ings or just a quick meal. These
heroes, subs, grinders, come in a
variety of sizes to easily feed the
hungry crowds. The vegetarian
combo is not bad, although I'm
partial to the turkey . . .

South of the Border
Local Mexican restaurants are
known more for their festive
atmospheres than for excellent
food, but you can find good,
hearty meals for a reasonable
price at many of these popular
spots. Judging from the number
of Stanford students who frequent
Compadres (3877 El Camino),
you know they are doing some
thing right. That something is
probably the tasty margaritas . . .
good salsa too! Along the same
lines is El Torito (4470 El
Camino), a popular place for
Senior Pub Nights.
A lively newcomer to the
Mexican scene is the El Dorado
Cafe(42o Ramona) where
nouveau Mexican food, tequila
shots and a boisterous crowd
make for a fun evening. Best if
you're with a large group!
Chili's (700 El Camino, Menlo
Park) is another spot where you'll
find many fellow students — prob
ably waiting in line for a table
with you! It's casual, with great
margaritas and soft tacos.
If a lack of atmosphere doesn't
bother you, try Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Avenue, Redwood City)
It's a whole-in-the-wall, but the
authentic Mexican cuisine makes
up for it. Fun with a group, and
Rosita's has a great selection of
Mexican beers. If you don't mind
sitting on benches outside watch
ing El Camino traffic go by Senor
Taco (3490 El Camino) is fast,
good and cheap — with a wide
selection. The pink taco stand
with cactus in front serves great


Todd Sitrin — Daily file
carne asada's for under $3.
Finally, there's Macheesmo
Mouit(27l University Ave), an
airy counter service restaurant
atmosphere — it tends to get quite
noisy inside. Crayons and paper
keep you busy while waiting for
your food which will be good, but
nothing special. Try the deca
dently rich turtle pie for dessert
— it will make up for your ordi
nary meal!
Another busy and yuppie-like
spot is the new Max's Opera Cafe
(711 Stanford Shopping Center).
The food is quite good and comes
in huge portions — the desserts
are amazing so save room! The
waiters and waitresses sing
Broadway show-stoppers, provid
ing non-stop and enjoyable enter
tainment!
The California Cafe (Stanford
Barn) is another lively spot with
great grilled chicken and fish, and

a variety of pasta and salads. It's
sleek and chic and smells wonder
ful. A slightly dressier crowd than
Max's . . .
By far the most elegant is The
Gatehouse (256 Lytton), another
great spot for special occasions.
The outdoor dining and chic bar
make it an attractive (if more ex
pensive) restaurant.
Wake-Me-Ups
The absolute best breakfast
place around is Hobee's (67 Town
and Country Village or 4224 El
Camino Real) with its amazing
blueberry coffeecake and cinna
mon tea — both are truly addic
tive. Trust me! Hobee's has great
omelets and egg scrambles, as well
as pancakes and homemade
granola. Don't miss out on their
energy blends either — yogurt
shakes with fresh strawberries,
bananas or blueberries.
Another old favorite is Late For
the Train (150 Middlefield, Menlo
Park) where pancakes are big and
fluffy and the maple syrup is the
real thing! Scones are a specialty,

French toast is divine, and the
blintzes are delicious. Expect to
wait for seating at both these
places, especially on the weekends.
For a quick bite, head to
Suzanne's Muffins (376 Univer
sity) where you can't miss with
the bran bran bran, the oatmeal
chocolate chip, the blueberry, the
apple cinnamon, the corn . . . get
the picture? Another treat is TJ.
Cinnamons (170 University) for
delicious warm cinnamon rolls
that will absolutely melt in your
mouth. If bagels are your thing,
then The Bagel Works (129 Lyt
ton) is the place to be. It's not
an eaterie like the other places,
but a great place to run in and
grab some fresh from the oven
and still warm chewy bagels. Can
you say "Raisin and cinnamon?"
Health Conscious
If you're a healthy eater (and
who isn't these days?) two local
spots will be of interest to you.
First there's Croutons (379 Uni

versity) where you'll spot many a
Stanford woman . . . Crouton's is
a salad bar. A large salad bar,
with just about everything you
could want on a salad. They also
have soups (not as good as the
salad stuff) and fresh fruit (always
good) and amazing bran muffins,
scones, rye bread, and sourdough
... all for one price, help-yourself
style. Indulge, without feeling
guilty. There is also a frozen yo
gurt stand in the front.
Another good choice is The
Good Earth (185 University)
which even has its own bakery
selection at the counter. Good
soups, hearty sandwiches and
tasty yogurt shakes make this
spot a winner. This place gets
quite crowded at dinner where
you'll often find a slightly older
crowd than at Croutons.
French Finds
For excellent crepes and pretty
outdoor dining try Le Mersault
(651 Emerson Street), "Palo
Alto's wine restaurant." A great
wine selection complements the
delicate crepes and desserts for a
wonderful meal. Also serving fine
French food (and at reasonable
prices) is Le Pot Au Feu (1149
El Camino, Menlo Park) with its
country-kitchen atmosphere and
simple, well-prepared dishes.
French dining can be an elegant
affair in the Stanford area as well.
The more formal (and expensive)
Chez Louis (4170 El Camino) is
a definte local institution. With
dance music and its country inn
atmosphere, Chez Louis provides
a lovely dining experience. An
other more expensive treat is
Chantilly (530 Ramona) for when
you feel like going out in style.
Burgers and Fries
When you're in the mood for a
hamburger but just can't stomach
the thought of McDonald's try
Pudlcy's (255 University Avenue)
or the Alpine Beer Garden (3915
Alpine Road, Portola Valley),
more commonly known as Zott's.
Zott's has great french fries and
serves rectangular hamburgers to
its loyal customers. The beer flows
and the jukebox plays on . . .
Fro Yo
You will quickly learn that
everything at Stanford is ab
breviated and frozen yogurt is no

exception. However you choose to
say it, it's good and it is abundant.
For convenience (but small selec

which usually offers 8 flavors,
many of them non-fat. There are

The Grand Finale
Palo Alto is just dripping with
ice cream places, each one more

tantalizing than the next. There
are the standard Baskin Robbing
and Swensen's (University Ave.),
but they must compete with the
more gormet chains Haagen-Daz
(Stanford Barn) and the new
Double Rainbow (Ramona, Palo
Alto). In addition, there is Blatz
(101 California Ave, Palo Alto),
the king of folded ice cream
(choose your own mix-ins). Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream (Charles
ton, at Middlefiled, Palo Alto) and
the Peninsula Creamery (corner
of Hamilton and Emerson, Palo
Alto) round out the group. And
there's always the milkshakes at
the 24-kour Creamery (209 Uni
