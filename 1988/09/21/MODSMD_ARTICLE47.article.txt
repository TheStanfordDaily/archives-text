# Where to go when the hunger pains hit hard

Eat, Drink and be Merry
Ah, eat, drink and be merry. . .
we've heard it so many times
before. But it's only after the
novelty of dorm dining wears off
that we decide to "experience"
good food — and in abundance!

Fortunately, food lovers, the
Stanford area offers a multitude
of dining opportunities that range
from the cheap and casual to the
upbeat and pricey. With health
food, sushi, French cuisine and
Mexican (just to name a few of
your options) to choose from, it's
easy to find just about whatever
you may be craving — even if it's
pizza topped with coconut and

raisins. (Hint: try the Applewood
Inn's sweet, but tasty, white piz
za.)
Pizza pie
Speaking of pizza, which only
New Yorkers seem to know as
"pies," there are several good
spots for indulging. Topping
everyone's list as the absolute
best (but the farthest from
campus) is Frankie, Johnnie &
Luigi T00(939 El Camino Real,
Mountain View). The pizza crust
is divine and the toppings are all
quite good. Expect a wait to be
seated (on weekends) and avoid
the Italian dinners which don't
even come close to the pizza.
A little closer to home is
Ramona's (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto) which boasts "New York
style" pizza. Although the pizza
is generally good, it is nothing
like real New York pizza, which
is actually paper thin and would
not come near pineapple and
Canadian bacon for all the pasta
in Italy! Ramona's, nonetheless,
is fairly thick crusted (opt for the
whole wheat crust) with spicy
sauce and generous toppings.
Fresh spinach adds a unique and
delicious twist. Expect to wait and
to see lots of fellow Stanford stu
dents.
Also downtown is the funky
Pizza-A-Go-Go (335 University
Ave) that conveniently offers
pizza-by-the-slice. Good crust, not
too spicy sauce, and lots of cheese
— give it a try!
And, don't overlook the Ap
plewood Inn (1001 El Camino
Real, Menlo Park) with its gour
met pizza toppings. The outside

of the Applewood Inn doesn't look
inviting. Don't be deceived, like I
was. The artichokes on a veggie
combo pizza make this place spe
cial.
Something Smells Fishy
As close as Stanford is to the
Pacific Ocean, you should expect
some great seafood restaurants —
and you won't be disappointed.
The most accessible, reasonable
and casual is The Fish Market
(3150 El Camino) which offers
super fresh fish from an ever
changing daily menu. Great red
snapper and grilled swordfish!
Scott's Seafood Grill and Bar
(2300 E. Bayshore Rd.) is more
formal. Also on the dressy (and
more expensive) side is Theo's
(546 University) which has fresh
fish, as well as pasta and chicken.
Also downtown is the interesting
Pearl's Oyster Bar (535 Ramona
Avo.) with its grotto-like entry
way.
Mange Bene!
Palo Alto has cornered the mar
ket on good local Italian eateries.
The big three — Osteria, La Pas
taia and Cenzo's offer great Ital
ian dinners in a variety of atmo
spheres, all in the medium price
range ($6-12). Osteria (247
Hamilton Ave.) is crowded, busy
and lively (reservations a must)
with great fresh pasta, especially
the gnocchi. Cenzo's (233 Univer
sity Ave.) is more casual and cafe
like, with great bread and good
seafood and pasta combinations.
La Pasatia (420 Emerson Ave.) is
the most elegant of the three, and

the chef here pays close attention
to food presentation. You certainly
can't go wrong with any of them.
Over at the Stanford Shopping
Center, two more Italian restau
rants await. The cafe-like Bravo
Fono (99 Stanford Shopping Cen
ter) has pretty outdoor dining and
a sleek interior with good salads,
fresh fish and pasta. The more
traditional Mama's is a nice fam
ily or date place to go for dinner.
One more place you might like
to try is the relatively new La
Galleria (73 Town and Country
Village) which offers fine North
ern Italian cuisine, with a touch
of Swiss influence in a casual, but
pretty atmosphere.
Sandwiches and Such
In my opinion, the best place
around for sandwiches and other
deli items is the Stanford
De!icatesscn(B3 Stanford Shop
ping Center). The huge assort
ment of salads behind the counter
(pasta with shrimp being my fa
vorite) keeps you busy while
waiting for your number to be
called. Big sandwiches with just
about anything you want — from
turkey on whole wheat to a real
pastrami on rye— are the norm.
A real Stanford tradition is get
ting Togo's (University Ave) sand
wiches for tailgaters, dorm meet
ings or just a quick meal. These
heroes, subs, grinders, come in a
variety of sizes to easily feed the
hungry crowds. The vegetarian
combo is not bad, although I'm
partial to the turkey . . .

South of the Border
Local Mexican restaurants are
known more for their festive
atmospheres than for excellent
food, but you can find good,
hearty meals for a reasonable
price at many of these popular
spots. Judging from the number
of Stanford students who frequent
Compadres (3877 El Camino),
you know they are doing some
thing right. That something is
probably the tasty margaritas . . .
good salsa too! Along the same
lines is El Torito (4470 El
Camino), a popular place for
Senior Pub Nights.
A lively newcomer to the
Mexican scene is the El Dorado
Cafe(42o Ramona) where
nouveau Mexican food, tequila
shots and a boisterous crowd
make for a fun evening. Best if
you're with a large group!
Chili's (700 El Camino, Menlo
Park) is another spot where you'll
find many fellow students — prob
ably waiting in line for a table
with you! It's casual, with great
margaritas and soft tacos.
If a lack of atmosphere doesn't
bother you, try Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Avenue, Redwood City)
It's a whole-in-the-wall, but the
authentic Mexican cuisine makes
up for it. Fun with a group, and
Rosita's has a great selection of
Mexican beers. If you don't mind
sitting on benches outside watch
ing El Camino traffic go by Senor
Taco (3490 El Camino) is fast,
good and cheap — with a wide
selection. The pink taco stand
with cactus in front serves great
