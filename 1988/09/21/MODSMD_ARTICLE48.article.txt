# Berkeley's sights and sounds
## Surviving across the Bay 
### 
The streets of Berkeley includ
ing Telegraph Avenue, the city's
central thoroughfare, are painted
with a certain amount of "human
color," some of it psychedelic.
For starters, up until a few
years ago the "Red Man," could
be seen virtually any day parading
through the Berkeley streets,
dressed from head to toe in a
vibrant shade of scarlet, carrying
on his back a stuffed puppet the
size of an infant.
"Crazy William" is rumored to
have been a philosophy graduate
strudent who "went over the
edge." He painted his clothes and
face with dollar-size red polka dots
and took to camping out on
Telegraph, making faces at people
and drawing attention to himself
any way he could.
"You have to be normal to stand
out at Berkeley," many University
of California freshmen are told,
and despite the large student pop
ulation, some undoubtedly find
this the case.
Berkeley is still a mecca for po
litical demonstrators and ac

tivists. Few causes seem to go
unnoticed. Supporters of every
thing — from the nuclear freeze
to Nicaragua — establish them
selves in Sproul Plaza, the focal
point and early afternoon, it is
difficult to cross this stretch of
pavement without being asked to
sign any number of political peti
tions.
Although many of those new to
the area may find this process
intimidating, the majority of stu
dents tend to develop "defense tac
tics" to ward of the more adamant
demonstrators. Clutching
textbooks and notepads, students
can be seen with heads bent and
eyes focused firmly on the ground
in front of them as they stride
quickly through a crowd of
petition-bearing activists.
The majority of those people of
ten considered "unusual" are gen
erally harmless, provided they are
not provoked (Just to make sure,
residents offer visiting outsiders
a safety tip: Whatever you do or
see, always avoid eye contact).
For all their faults, there is at

least one thing Berkeley residents
do right: make good food. Since
the arrival of Alice Waters, the
owner of the world-famous Chez
Panisse restaurant, Berkeley has
blossomed with quality eateries of
every shape and ethnic origin.
Some claim Berkeley's good
eats can be traced to all those
'60s radicals who realized at some
point that they had to make a
living; years of preparing organic
food finally came in handy.
Whether this is actually the
source of the local cuisine revo
lution, fresh ingredients and an
innovative attitude are common
to every respected restaurant in
the area.
Even if you only stay in
Berkeley long enough to want to
go home, you are going to have
to eat at some time.
If you want to risk going to one
of the student hangouts, try Kip's
or Larry Blake's, both within a
few blocks of Sproul Plaza. For a
student bar, check in to Henry's
or Spatz's.
Going out to breakfast has be

come an art in the land of the
Golden Bear. Places like Bctte's
Ocean View Diner and Buttercup
Bakery serve complete breakfasts
with various omelettes and high
quality pastries.
And, if you have the time to sit
down, you might try Itamona's,
but remember that this restau
rant has no connnections to its
Palo Alto namesake. The brunch
menu features egg specialties, in

eluding Eggs Benedict. The
omelettes are served with home
fries and your choice of bread or
pastry. If you want authentic
Chicago-style pizza and it's after
11:30 a.m. you're in luck.
Ramona's has an original recipe
that is the restaurant's claim to
fame.
Lunch and dinner open up a
whole range of possibilities. If you
like Mexican food and places with

atmosphere, Carlos Murphy's is
conveniently located right of the
freeway at the Everville exit.
In the home city of Peets Cof
fee, cafes abound. Cafe Roma, the
old standby on College and
Durant, is being challenged by the
up-and-coming Old Blue Cafe,
which also features dessert. There
are outdoor tables at both places,
so you're never too far from the
Red Man and Crazy William.
