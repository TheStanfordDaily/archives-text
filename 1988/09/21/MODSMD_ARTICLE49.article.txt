# A 						day in the life of a weenie
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Lori Silver 
For one day, we undertook a
dangerous mission. We crossed
enemy lines, ventured into un
chartered territory. For one day,
we became Weenies.
Because it'll be a while before
most freshmen leave plush Palo
Alto and scout out the enemy
across the Bay, we traveled in
cognito to discover the real UC-
Berkeley for them.
Driving up Telegraph Avenue,
Cal's equivalent of Palm Drive,
we immediately saw a striking
difference between the two cam

puses.
We thought we had entered
the Twilight Zone. The spirit of
the 1960s is very much alive
and well at Cal. In contrast to
scenic Palm Drive with its gor
geous view of Mem Chu,
Telegraph is lined with hippies
selling tie-dyed T-shirts and
with students hurrying to their
classes. (Cal has been in session
for a while now).
Perched at the top of
Telegraph is Sather Gate, a
large copper arch marking the
official entrance to Weenieland.
Sather Gate is the famous site
of most of the nuyor Cal riots

in the '60s.
Silly us; we thought the '60s
were over. Unfortunately no one
told this to Cal students — ob
viously a deficiency in their ed
ucation.
As we innocently walked
through Sather Gate we got
swept up in a silent protest
march. By Stanford standards
this march was huge. About 500
students marched through
campus with clenched lists up
held
According to Krishna Henry,
a sophomore, Cal's ethnic
groups were protesting the inad
equate office space provided for
student services.Their offices are
housed in 40-year-old "tempo
rary" shacks that reminded us of
Manzanita Park — except that
the shacks were wooden and puce
colored.
"Cal's administration is just as
conservative as Stanford's,"
Henry said, noting that the Cal
administration had yet to ac
knowledge the protestors' de
mands.
As we talked with Henry, his
misconceptions about Stanford
became clear. What do Cal stu
dents really think about Stanford
students? We decided to find out.
Deciding to risk her life for The
Daily, Kathy approached a Cal
student dressed in red and white.
"Do you know that you're
wearing Stanford colors? We're
from Stanford — what do you
think of us?" Kathy asked.
Shocked, the Weenie immedi
ately responded, "All Stanford
students are clean-cut and rich."
Although we're too mature to
stereotype all Weenies, we found
that Cal students met our expec
tations. During our walk we
passed three Hare Krishnas,
enough punkers to fill a Dead
Kennedys concert and five dazed
students celebrating Guy Fawkes
Day. Who is Guy Fawkes?

Lost and a little freaked out,
we longed for a familiar sight —
anything to help us escape from
Bezerkeley . . . oops, Berkeley. A
fro yo shop on Durant Street
seemed ready to offer us refuge.
Yogurt Village turned out to be
a fro-yo lover's paradise. With six
exotic flavors, millions of toppings
and an enormous serving for only
90 cents, the shop gave us the will
to continue our mission.
Next stop on our quest to un
cover the essence of Cal was an
actual sorority house. Unlike
Stanford, Cal has 15 housed so
rorities and 42 fraternities. . . .
And people think the Greek sys
tem is intense at Stanford.
We picked one of Cal's most
popular sororities and ventured in
for a tour. The palace. . . uh. . .
house was immaculate, decorated
in pink and beige with Oriental
carpets covering wood floors and
huge windows overlooking San
Francisco.
"Do people date at Cal?" Lori
asked.
"Of course. We go out all the
time," one skinny blonde
responded.
On the way back to the admis
sions office to pick up transfer
applications, we decided to eat our
way out of depression and stopped
at Blondie's Pizza.
For only $1, we bought a slice
of greasy pizza three-times larger
and 10-times better than Co Po
pizza. A Cal landmark, Blondie's
Pizza even delivers a large, 16-
inch pizza to a dorm room for $7.
