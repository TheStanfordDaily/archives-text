						day in the wine country

With over 100 wineries in Napa
Valley open to the public, the
greatest dilemna faced by poten
tial wine tasters is which wineries
to visit.
Too often people try to stop at
every winery they see. However,
if you try this, by the end of the

day you will be too tired to dis
tinguish the various wines you
have tasted.
At most, a person can visit four
to five wineries per day. Tourists
hoping to make the most of their
time should plan will in advance.
Below is a list of unique wineries
that may provide you with some
ideas.

Near the southern end of the
valley is the Robert Mondavi
Winery. This is the one of the
largest wineries in the valley and
their excellent tour explains state
of-the-art wine production. One
must take the tour in order to
taste their wines, which are quite
good.
Farther north on Highway 29
(the main Napa thorroughfare) is
Beaulieu Vineyard. Beaulieu of
fers an exceptionally classy wine
tasting experience.
Upon entering the winery,
guests are presented wine glasses
and encouraged to stroll around
the hospitality room while enjoy
ing the wine. The room itself is
decorated with photographs of the
winery and antique wine para
phernalia.
Along with the informative
tour, Beaulieu provides an inter
esting 15-minute multi-media
presentation every half hour. The
tours and presentation are option
al.
A great place to stop for lunch
is the V. Sattui Winery. This
winery has a complete delicates
sen and an outdoor picnic area.
In addition, V. Sattui makes
some excellent wines — particu
larly their Rieslings and Madeira.
Their wines are sold only at the
winery, so the selection offered
for tasting is more generous than
at most places. Tours are by ap
pointment only.
Almost directly across the
street is the Sutter Home Winery,
offering very inexpensive wines.
These wines should be a staple
for those on a student's budget.
Unfortunately, Sutter Home is of
ten crowded and offers no tours.
Quite a bit further north is
Sterling Vineyards. Sterling has
a large Spanish-style building, set
on the top of a hill, that is acces
sible only by tram. Once at the


Bosche — Dally file
One of the many great wineries in Napa Valley that deserve a
weekend visit from Stanford.
