# How to judge the best wines

Those looking for a real California experience
ought to consider wine tasting tours in Napa Valley.
Beyond providing a slice of California life, the tours
are easily accesible and can be very informative.
Maps of Napa, which are helpful in planning visits
to the major wineries, are avialable in most markets
and liquor stores.
There are over 140 wineries in Napa, most of
which are open to the public. So even without a
map, no one should have trouble finding them.
Many wineries offer tours that show each step in
the production of wine. Most have a guide, but
some tours are self-guided, which can be more in
teresting because the signs in each room tend to
give more detailed information than guides have
time to.
Each tour explains how grapes can be made into
either red or white wine. The process of fermentation
and the importance of when to stop the process is
outlined.
Just the experience of smelling the aroma of the
wine that has permeated the walls and standing
next to a barrel of wine that's larger than most
dorm roons makes each tour a treat.
While just about all tours are optional, occaionally
a winery will require that guests take the tour
before drinking the wine. These tours tend to be
shorter (about 10 minutes instead of 30) and go
into significantly less depth about the wine-making
processes.
The wine-tasting mystique should not be allowed
to frighted anyone away from Napa Valley. One day
of tasting is guaranteed to teach each visitor the
complete list of catch phrases as well as some true
pointers on how to distinguish fine (or not-so-fine)

wines.
In every winery tasting room there is a list of
wines they are serving that day. The list is in the
order that the wines are served. Whites are served
before red, and dry wines with very little residual
sugar are served before sweet wines. This way an
earlier bouquet will not cloud the flavor of the next
wine.
There are four ways to evaluate wines. Each is
very subjective and the value given each criterion
is up to the person judging.
The first point is appearance. Does the wine look
good? I just like the a white wine to look different
from water and a red wine to be very dark.
The smell of the wine is referred to as the "nose"
and is the next step in evaluating a wine. Some
whites have very little smell, while others smell
like a bed of roses. I like mine somewhere in be
tween. Reds typically have a strong, musty odor.
The entire process so far — evaluating the ap
pearance and nose — takes about 30 seconds. The
next step is to taste the wine. Everyone knows
what they like, so there are no tips I can offer for
this stage.
After drinking the wine, one should consider the
aftertaste. Does a pleasant flavor linger or is there
the irresistible urge to pucker? The meaning of
each should be clear.
Almost all wineries offer free wine tasting. Only
a few require the purchase of a glass, usually at a
cost of $1 to $3.
Probably the best approach to an afternoon of
tasting is to find one or two wines that seem pleasing
and consistently try those wines at each winery.
Even if a winery isn't serving those wines, ask for
them anyway — it is my experience that they will
probably serve them to you.
