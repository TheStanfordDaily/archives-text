# When bikes and scooters won't do

### 
As your imagination roams beyond the
Farm and even beyond Palo Alto, it often
reaches northward to San Francisco. The per
fect day in the City forms in your mind, but
you quickly dismiss the idea, because you
have no wheels.
Suddenly San Francisco seems very far
away, much farther than when you were de
ciding whether to come to Stanford and you
read the pre-enrollment propoganda that said
"San Francisco is 35 miles north and offers
the urban pleasures of theaters, galleries, res
taurants and an extensive shopping district."
If you feel your desire to travel north stifled
by your lack of a car, you'll be happy to know
that there are other inexpensive and relatively
convenient ways to get there.
The most easily accessible transportation
to the City is the SamTrans bus, which departs
from the El Camino Real bus stop across from
the Stanford Shopping Center. Although not
the most scenic route, SamTrans to the City
costs only $1.50 each way.
Buses begin the hourly trip to San Francisco
at 5:17 a.m. on weekdays and at 6:32 a.m.
on weekends. After 8:37 a.m. buses run every
half hour until 6:07 p.m. when they return
to hourly departures. The last bus leaves Palo
Alto at 12:05 a.m.
The travel time by bus is nearly twice that
by car, and be prepared to stand if you ride
during commuter hours. Depart the bus at
the downtown stop of Eighth and Mission
(near the Civic Center). Don't forget that the
last bus back to Palo Alto leaves from First
and Mission at 12:49 a.m. and that the south
bound buses stop at Seventh and Mission in
stead of Eighth.
The Palo Alto-bound 7F buses leaving from
First and Mission every 30 minutes until 3:19
p.m. when they start leaving every hour. At

5:45 p.m. departures return to 30-minute in
tervals.
If you really want to "get into" the Bay
Area commuting scene. You may want to con
sider taking BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit)
into the City. But since the closest BART
station to Stanford is in Daly City, using
BART first entails finding transportation to
Daly City — about 20 miles north of campus
on Interstate 280.
Beginning at 6 a.m. the 5L Sam Trans bus
line leaves the Palo Alto Southern Pacific

railway station every 20 to 30 minutes and
Btops at the Daly City BART station. The trip
costs only 50 cents, but the stop-and-go route
takes about only an hour and a half.
One practical advantage of using BART ii
that it offers special bicycle permits, including
temporary one-time passes. But because the
bus does not allow bikes, you need to hitch
a ride with your bike to Daly City.
The seven downtown BART stations are all

CalTrain leaves from the South
ern Pacific Depot off University

The train is more expensive
than BART or SamTrans, but it
tends to be more comfortable and
roomier. A one-way ticket costs
$3.20 and round trip fare is $4.80.
After a smattering of dawn
departures, the CalTrain schedule
eases into what vaguely resembles
hourly departures from 8:26 a.m.
until 10:26 p.m., with a few extra
trips thrown in. The downtown
San Francisco stop is at Fourth

and Townsend, fairly far from
centers of interest, but along the
city bus routes.
