# Beyond the hot tubbing experience
## 
### Mike Shay 
I started the day with a massage
session.
A massage is great for relieving
stress. Around finals time the
number of Stanford students get
ting massages takes a marked
jump.
I was modest and wore my
shorts. If I hod to do it over I

probably would have skipped
them. There are long strokes that
run from your heel to your shoul
der. During this rub I became
very aware of the fact I still had
anything on. The stroke started,
a long rippling up my body then
it sort of took a jump and res
tarted at my waist and then con
tinued up my back. The jump kind
of ruined the stroke.

After an hour I felt relaxed and
very calm.
I was told that many people
have very emotional experiences
during a massage. The tensions
stored in the muscle are released
and the underlying emotional rea
son for the stress is brought for
ward.
I didn't feel any release, just
relaxed, but over the next couple
of days I became very aware of
which muscles tensed up again
and more aware of how to prevent
the muscles from turning into
knots.
After the massage I had a one
and-a-half-hour float in the flota
tion tank.
The room where the tank was
located was carpeted floor to
ceiling to deaden the surrounding
sounds. It had a music system for
any tapes you would like to bring
with you, it had a shower, a rest
ing area, and the tank.
The tank was filled with a
highly salty water, more dense
then any normal water.. This
makes your body buoyant.
To make the salt water, about
800 pounds of epsom salts are
dissolved in about 100 gallons of
water. I got some water on my
mouth and tasted it. It is the sal
tiest anything you're likely to
come across anywhere.
There was about 8 inches of
water in the tank. Hardly diving
depth, but more than deep enough

for floating. The only time I
touched the bottom was when I
was crawling in and out of the
tank.
I turned out all the lights and
closed the door to the tank. I had
been told that some people have
problems with claustrophobia
while in the tank.
Fortunately my mild claustrop
hobia didn't surface. The tank was
roomy and the door opened very
easily.
Relaxing in the tank took some
time. For awhile I kept bouncing
off of the sides of the tank. I
didn't want to be touching any
thing, so when I came into contact
with a wall I would nudge away
and I would slowly drift to the
opposite wall. Finally I got cen
tered and learned how to avoid
bouncing around.
The water in the tank is reg
ulated to 94 degrees and after a
little while it was difficult to tell
where the water level was. It all
felt the same. I was floating but
I wasn't sure if I was floating in
air or water.
The tank wasn't completely
quiet, which was a little disap
pointing. I could hear some noise
from the outside world. I could
hear—maybe feel —the distant
rumbling of an air conditioner or
something, and occasionally I
could hear a loud voice.
