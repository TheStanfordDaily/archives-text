Looking for something dif
ferent to do? Looking to relax
and become more aware of your
body?
Welcome to Watercourse
Way.
Watercourse Way, located at
165 Channing St.in Palo Alto,
is a nice warm place to relax
and get away from it all. Water
course Way is a bath house.
I call it a bath house simply
because that is what it is listed
under in the yellow pages. But
it is far more than just a bath
house, more even than just a
full-featured bath house.
Watercourse Way offers hot
tubs, saunas, steam rooms, cold
plunges., massages and a flota
tion tank.
There is even a sushi bar.
Most people know Water
course Way as the place with
the hot tubs. There are nine
rooms with different types of
hot tubs and combinations jof
hot tubs and saunas. Most of
ten it is couples that rent rooms
for an hour or so, but groups
of up to eight can be accom
modated by the larger rooms.
The regulars come in with
small bags with bathing suits,

shampoo, brushes and other
clothes.
Alcohol and drugs are not
permitted at Watercourse Way,
and the management reserves
the right to refuse service, so
loud raucous parties are a no
no.
But for romance and relaxa
tion it can't be beat.
If your looking for more than
just a soak in a hot tub, Water
course Way offers yoga courses,
massage and herbal skin treat
ments.
For massage, Watercourse
Way has 15 staffed massage
rooms and a variety of different
styles of massages are avail
able.

Watercourse Way's practition
