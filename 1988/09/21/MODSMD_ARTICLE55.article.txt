# Making the most out of a massage

### 
Looking for something dif
ferent to do? Looking to relax
and become more aware of your
body?
Welcome to Watercourse
Way.
Watercourse Way, located at
165 Channing St.in Palo Alto,
is a nice warm place to relax
and get away from it all. Water
course Way is a bath house.
I call it a bath house simply
because that is what it is listed
under in the yellow pages. But
it is far more than just a bath
house, more even than just a
full-featured bath house.
Watercourse Way offers hot
tubs, saunas, steam rooms, cold
plunges., massages and a flota
tion tank.
There is even a sushi bar.
Most people know Water
course Way as the place with
the hot tubs. There are nine
rooms with different types of
hot tubs and combinations jof
hot tubs and saunas. Most of
ten it is couples that rent rooms
for an hour or so, but groups
of up to eight can be accom
modated by the larger rooms.
The regulars come in with
small bags with bathing suits,

shampoo, brushes and other
clothes.
Alcohol and drugs are not
permitted at Watercourse Way,
and the management reserves
the right to refuse service, so
loud raucous parties are a no
no.
But for romance and relaxa
tion it can't be beat.
If your looking for more than
just a soak in a hot tub, Water
course Way offers yoga courses,
massage and herbal skin treat
ments.
For massage, Watercourse
Way has 15 staffed massage
rooms and a variety of different
styles of massages are avail
able.
The styles available from
Watercourse Way's practition
ers are: Swedish, Esalen,
Shiatsu, Trager, Lomi,
Polarity, Accupressure,
Reflexology, Deep Tissue,
Sports, Jin Shin Do and a spe
cial massage for pregnant wom
en.
The "House Brand" is a com
bination of Swedish and
Esalen. This style of massage
is popular here and is the stand
ard at other massage places.
The Esalen style of massage is
basically the same as Swedish but
is a more free and intuitive form
of massage. Swedish massage has
a more regimented form that re
quires balance â€” if the right
shoulder is given five rubs then
the left shoulder must be given
five rubs.
Both Esalen and Swedish are
relaxing types of massage. They

use long rubbing strokes of
moderate pressure. This works all
of the surface muscles and loosens
them up, allowing the blood to
circulate better and to relieve the
tensions the muscles have built
up. It does loosen some of the
deeper muscles a little.
Most of the massages combine
aspects of many different styles.
Massages at Watercourse Way
are one hour long. The massages
start at 9:30 a.m., 11 a.m., 12:30
p.m., 2 p.m., 3:30 p.m., 5 p.m.,
6:30 p.m., 8 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.
As with all of Watercourse Way's
services, it is best to call ahead
for an appointment.

A unique facet of Watercourse
Way is its flotation tank.
Flotation tanks, also known as
isolation and sensory deprivation
tanks, are becoming more popular
as their benefits become more
widely known. The realities of
flotation tanks are much calmer
than the images portrayed in the
movie "Altered States," but to
some they bring about increased
creativity the ability to concen
trate, relief from stress and a light
feeling of euphoria.
The price of the massage and
all of the facilites are very rea
sonable. Even the sushi is reason
ably priced.
