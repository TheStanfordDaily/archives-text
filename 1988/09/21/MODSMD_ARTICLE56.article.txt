# A 						chance to read up on Palo Alto bookstores

### 
Student bibliophiles (even
bibliomaniacs) face an unusual
problem at Stanford. Finding a
good bookstore near campus is
easy. Choosing is the hard part.
Between California Avenue in
Palo Alto and Santa Cruz Avenue
in Menlo Park, there are nearly
30 stores that sell only (or pri
marily) books, and a number of
other establishments — thrift
stores, consignment shops and the
like — that keep books on hand.
Here are some highlights.
The place to start, of course, is
on campus. The Stanford Book
store is both more than, and less
than, a good bookstore. More, be
cause half of its floor is given over
to office space, candy and cookies,
and hundred of useless items that
say "Stanford." The Bookstore
also stocks textbooks (upstairs),
orders art prints and does a lot
of other things that most book
stores don't.
The Bookstore, however, is not
a nice place to browse for books.
The lighting is unpleasant, there
is no seating of any kind and with
rows of check-out lines, the store
resembles a supermarket. If you

are looking for something specific
(the selection in most areas is
good, particularly in art history,
literary criticism and contempo
rary fiction) or want to find a
book (the Bookstore will order
anything in print) then a quick
trip is worthwhile. But for a real
bookstore experience, you must
travel beyond the confines of the
campus.
Printers Inc. is one of the most
popular bookstores in the area, in
part because of its espresso bar
and special ambiance. It calls it
self "the literary bookstore" and
most nights is full of English pro
fessors, local artist types, Palo
Alto intellectuals and a few real
writers. The store is well-stocked
and has an especially strong col
lection of contemporary fiction
and an outstanding magazine sec
tion.
Northwest of campus, along El
Camino Real in Menlo Park, lies
Keplers, once a focus of radical
activity in the 19605. Keplers
hosts the largest selection of
paperback books in the area (most
people don't even find the entire
store on their first visit), is a

champion of the alternative press
and has a magazine section second
only to Printers Inc.
If you are in the Stanford Shop
ping Center, then be sure to stop
by Books Inc., a store notable
particularly for its science fiction
and paperback mystery selection.
There is also a B. Dalton's in the
shopping center, but chain stores
such as these should be avoided
as a matter of principle.
Palo Alto is also home to a num
ber of very good used bookstores.
Of these, Bell's Book Store at
536 Emerson Ave. is the most
interesting, with over 200,000
out-of-print hardbacks and a
scholarly, family-run atmosphere
that encourages browsing.
Megabooks at 444 University Ave.
in Palo Alto is smaller and less
discriminating in its selection.
The clerks also tend to be suspi
cious of students with backpacks.
There are also a number of
specialty bookstores in the area.
Minserva Books (1027 Alma) is
a small but very attractive store
with an interesting selection of

books on mythology and religion.
Comics and Comix (405 Cali
fornia) has lots of comic books,
science fiction paperbacks, posters
and magazines, but Future Fan
tasy (233 El Camino) and Lee's
Comics (3429 Alma) are more
serious and well-stocked.
Sierra Designs, Ski Hut and
North Face carry camping direc-

Tories as do the Nature Company
(Stanford Shopping Center), and
the Peninsula Conservation Cen
ter (2253 Park Blvd.). The Con
servation Center also has a libra
ry, a gift shop and a walk-through
water-saving garden. A few doors
down at 2185 Park Blvd. is Pen
insula Scientific, which carries
books, telescopes and freeze-dried
bacteria.
Finally, Szwede Slavic Books
(2233 El Camino, Palo Alto)
carries an impressive selection of
books.
