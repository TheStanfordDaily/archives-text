# The
						hidden Stanford: what the tour guide missed
## 
### 
You've gone on the campus tour. It
took an hour and you saw some inter
esting stuff, but there's an empty feeling
in your stomach. This is partly because
you haven't eaten lunch and partly be
cause you're sure there's more of Stan
ford to see. Besides, you're going to be
here all year, and you need some places
to go.
Do not despair, for there are many
spots the tour guide didn't show you
— places hidden and some not-so
hidden. Stanford's campus is sprawling,
and has many special attractions worth
seeking out.
The following is a guide to some of
the hidden Stanford. These places range
from gorgeous to just plain bizarre;
most you'll never see on postcards, but
all are worth seeing at least once. This
is only a partial, subjective listing; hope
fully, it will set you on the road to some
discoveries of your own.
Hoover Tower — Begin your tour of
the hidden Stanford with a trip to the
top of Hoover Tower. The elevator ride
is great, and once you get to the top
you can see for miles around. From
here you'll spot parts of the campus
you didn't even know existed.
Stanford Mausoleum — A little morbid
perhaps, but a gorgeous structure none
theless and worth the trip just to see
the magnificent oak tree that guards
the crypt. While you're here, be sure
to see the Angel of Grief statue nearby.
Cactus Garden — Right next to the
Mausoleum, this collection of cacti and
other exotic vegetation used to be the
lover's lane of Stanford students. Now
it's a bit overgrown but still beautiful.
Perfect for a romantic stroll or an af
ternoon picnic.
The Knoll — This majestic building,
looming in fearsome magnificence on a
hill above the barracks-style Florence
Moore Hall, used to house the Univer
sity's Department of Music. Now God
only knows what's in it, but it's cer
tainly one of the grandest buildings on
campus, and fearless undergraduates
tell stories of spending the night there.
The Dish — It's hard to miss the big
satellite dish in the foothills behind
Stanford, but many people miss visiting
it. Take the path that begins off
Junipero Serra Boulevard across the
street from Lake Lagunita, and it's just
a short (though uphill) walk to the Dish.
There you'll have a beautiful view of
the Bay Area. Another great place for

a picnic; also the best place on campus
to watch the sun set or rise.
Meyer Library sundecks — Speaking
of great places to watch the sun set,
here's the second best. Stand on the
deck that faces the center of campus
and see the red tile roofs bathed in the
pastels of twilight. Aaah . . . makes you
want to study, or at least go to the
library more often.
Green Library — Sure, everybody and
his or her dog goes here to study, but
there are so many other attractions.
Start in the old (west) wing, but before
you go in, admire the outside and the
neat arcade that runs across it. Once
you're inside just walk straight ahead
up the stairway into the Rotunda. This
is beautiful and plays host to an ever
changing variety of exhibits. Off to the
left when you get to the top of the
stairs is the Rare Book Room, a must
see.

These places range from gorgeous to just plain bizarre;
most you'll never see on postcards, but all are worth
seeing at least once.

Now it's time to check out the Uni
versity Archives. History buffs and
anyone interested in Stanford's past will
go crazy here. The Archives are housed
in the lovely Bender Room at the very
top of Green, on the seventh floor. Be
sure to take the elevator up. It's a great
old orange crate of a contraption —
even if you've got no curiosity about
Stanford, you'll soon be very anxious
to get to the Archives. But don't worry.
As the lady next to me on my first
Archives elevator ride said, "When it
gets stuck, it's never for more than a
few minutes." If you survive the
elevator ride, you'll find the Archives a
wonderful place, staffed by extremely
gracious, helpful people.
Highlights of the new (east) wing of
Green are the fountain outside, the
Jonsson Library of Government Docu
ments, a periodical section that surely
has your hometown paper and a staff
of research librarians who can seemingly
answer any question. Try them.
Okay, if given all these alternatives,
you still must study, at least try the
West Stacks once. Here you can sit

among musty and dusty books that no
one ever reads or study next to an open
window looking out on — and well
within hearing distance of the soothing
sounds of — the Shumway "Hoop"
Fountain.
Frost Amphitheater — Yep, that's right
. . . another great place for a picnic. You
always hear about this place, but few
people ever really go there unless the
Dead or some Windham Hill group is
playing a concert. If one of the gates
is open, walk on in, sit down and read
a book, muse about trivial things or
just admire the sylvan setting. And as
long as you're here, check out the ad
jacent Band Shak . Home of the infa
mous Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band and
repository of over 300 street signs from
around the world, this is a stop that
no Stanford visitor should miss.
The Quad at night — If sandstone and

red tile start to bore you, go take a
walk through the Quad after sundown
and see how it takes on a whole new
character. The shadows are tremendous
and the walkways are simultaneously
spooky and romantic.
Mayfield Avenue — Take a leisurely
evening stroll up the avenue from Braun
Music Center to the faculty ghetto.
Majestic fraternities and other student
residences line the street, casting beau
tiful green lawns out to passers-by.
Old Pavilion — Formerly home of the
varsity basketball team, the Old Pavil
ion now houses the University's per
sonnel offices. It's a magnificent office
facility, with the high ceiling and bus
tling atmosphere of a shopping galleria,
but the best thing about it is the scale
model of the University that sits in the
entrance. Check it out.
Lagunita Courtyard — This quiet,
Edenesque spot will shatter all your
preconceptions and convictions about
dormitory architecture.
Steam tunnels — We law-abiding
citizens have never actually been down
in these ourselves ....

The sandstone arches of the Quad provide a great backdrop for studying or just
relaxing in the California sun, as this student demonstrates.
