# Get your money's worth at Stanford
## 
### 
To determine the total cost
of a Stanford education,
it's not enough to merely
add up the cost of tuition, room
and board and books. You also
have to figure in the cost of a
few dozen movies, a handful of
dinners at Chili's, miscellaneous
items of clothing and the like.
And while the College Board
did not not include Stanford
among its 10 most expensive
university's this summer, the
total cost for the 1988-89 aca
demic year will exceed $20,000.
This is the first time the 20
grand milestone will be crossed
and it offers a chance to reflect
on the value of the education
you receive.
That is to say: When you sit
back and realize that four years
here will set you back $80,000
you cannot help but question
whether you are getting your
money's worth. Well, after three
years here I can assure you the
answer is yes, albeit a qualified
yes.
The qualification is because
it's very easy to go through four
years at Stanford doing nothing
but taking easy classes, getting
decent grades and sitting in the
sun.
When you're done you'll have
a much sought-after Stanford
bachelor's and a great tan —
but not much else.

What's the solution? Simple.
Take advantage of some of the
things that are available to you
here.
No, I am not giving you one
of those holier-than-thou ser
mons on getting involved with
public service or broadening
your intellectual horizons by
taking a class of Japanese phi
losophy in the 13th century.
Those things are worthwhile,
mind you, they're just not for
everyone. The trick is to find
something you love and pursue
it. And, yes, it should be some
thing that you haven't already
been doing for your entire life.
You see, being at Stanford
gives you a lot of opportunities
that you may not ever have
again. When you leave here, it's
your memories of those extras
that make this place really spe
cial. It's not the 97th A-plus
you got in a history class.
Take my experience as an ex
ample. Before coming to Stan
ford, I, like almost everyone
here, was one of the top students
in my class. And now, like al
most everyone here, I am no
longer one of the top students
in my class.
That's not to say I've done
poorly. All it means is that I've
occasionally compromised my
academics to do things that I
enjoy. I made a decision that I
would accept a lower grade
point average in order to allow
myself more time for activities
other than studying.
One of those activities has
been my work on the newspaper.
For you it might very well be
something entirely different:
student government, a religious
group, the Ultimate Frisbee
team.
There are literally hundreds
of extracurricular activities

going on all the time. Some, like
The Daily, offer valuable
preprofessional experience
(Though, I have no burning
desire to be a journalist). Some,
like the Axe Committee, allow
you to run and scream a lot
while rooting for Cardinal
sports teams.
Sometimes, you don't even
need an organized group to keep
you occupied for hours on end.
You may find, like I have, that
simply sitting down to talk to
people for a few hours is a great
way to spend an evening.
You may find yourself dis
cussing anything from Western
Culture, oops I mean Cultures,
Ideas and Values as it is now
known, to the Middle East, to
the National Football League.
Rest assured, you'll be able to
find a sparring partner who
knows as much about the sub
ject as you do — and disagrees
with you completely.
When I'm asked "What makes
Stanford great?" by friends avid
relatives, I tell them it's that I
never stop meeting interesting
people.
But I digress.
In the coming weeks almost
every student group on campus
will be coming at you with a
two-minute spiel or a flier
produced on a Macintosh listing
all the virtues of their particular
organization.
It'll probably sound like a lot
of hype, but give them a listen
and go to a meeting or two.
It won't cost you a penny to
broaden your horizons. That's a
lot less than the $20,000 it cost
you to come here in the first
place.
