# Learn the basics of Stanford life
## 
### 
Have you ever wanted to ask a
question that seemed so dumb
that you were too embarrassed to
ask anybody? Sure you have. In
order to keep you from looking
foolish, listed below are some
answers to the most commonly
asked stupid questions about the
Farm.
How do I know what's going on
around campus?
Keep an eye on the Once
Around the Quad listings in The
Daily. In addition, the calendar on
the back page of the weekly
Campus Report is very helpful,
listing all kinds of concerts, ex
hibits and meetings. The infor
mation booth and various bulletin
boards at Tresidder Memorial Un
ion will also help you.
Why is it called a "junior univer
sity"?
It's not. Stanford is a university
named after Leland Stanford Jr.,
son of railroad magnate and Cal
ifornia Governor Leland Stanford.
See page 7 for more history.
Where do I go to pay my bills'?
Bill-paying, like most important
activities related to the practical
side of going to Stanford, goes on
in Old Union, across White Plaza
from the Bookstore. Go to the
Cashier's Office to pay your bill,
but if you have any questions
about a bill, you're best off start
ing in the Bursar's Office. Old
Union is also home to the offices
of Credentials, Scheduling,
Housing, Admissions and Gradu
ate Studies, to name a few.
How can I get a job on campus?
There's rarely a shortage of em
ployment opportunities at Stan
ford. Check the Help Wanted list
ings in the classified section of
The Daily, as well as the Help
Wanted board at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center. In ad
dition, University Food Service is

almost always hiring (and paying
the rather lucrative University
minimum wage), as are the food
service organizations in Tresid
der.
Don't be bound to campus
though. Downtown Palo Alto is
only a short bike ride away, and
many of t he businesses there were
displaying Help Wanted signs as
the regular school year came to a
close.
How the hell do I figure out where
my classes are around here, espe
cially in the Quad?
The safest thing to do is carry
the current time schedule with
you any time you venture out in
search of a class until you get a
feel for the place. Class entries in

the time schedule include class
location, usually in a very cryptic
code that is explained on the in
side back cover of the time
schedule. Quad classroom num
bers are particularly strange.
Buildings in the Quad are num
bered by tens, beginning with
Building One in the Inner Quad
almost directly opposite the
Church, progressing clockwise
around the Inner Quad to Build
ing 110, then jumping to the
Outer Quad and making another
clockwise, incrementally
increasing trip around. A class
room assignment like 50-52 D
means Building 50 in the Quad

(right next to the Church), the
second floor (50-51 would be the
first floor), classroom D. Simple
enough, right? Right.
What's the best place to study?
This is a very subjective ques
tion, and the answer has to be
something of a personal matter.
Top contenders, though, include
Cubberley and Green Libraries,
History Corner and the Medical
School Library. Cubberley has at
mosphere (huge wooden tables,
cozy wooden chairs, towering
bookshelves); Green has atmos
phere and comfort (but don't go
there if you're even slightly
drowsy, unless you plan to study
in the hard wooden chairs of the
West or South Stacks); History

Corner has atmosphere, comfort
and privacy (try the enormous
first floor rooms that look out on
the Oval); the Med School Library
just has raw intensity.
The University boagts an
amazing array of libraries and
other spots to study at. Sample
widely, then settle down in your
favorite.
Why does the University use a tree
as a symbol?
The tree in the Stanford seal
is a representation of a hundred
foot tall redwood that has stood

for centuries at the corner of what
is now the Stanford campus.
Throughout the eighteenth cen
tury, Spanish explorers, mis
sionaries and soldiers traveling up
and down on El Camino Real used
the tree as a landmark, and called
it "Palo Alto," Spanish for "high
tree."
Leland Stanford took the name
for his Palo Alto Stock Farm,
which later became the grounds
of Stanford University. Eventually
the name passed to the town
which sprang up alongside the
new University.
According to the booklet "Stan
ford From the Beginning," the
tree was adopted for the school
seal not only because of its- his
torical significance, but also "be
cause it symbolizes the strength,
independence and enduring
qualities which a great university
must possess."
How do I go about joining the
Band or The Daily or any other
campus organization, for that
matter?
Most organizations at Stanford
are remarkably accessible to any
and all interested students. The
easiest way to get involved is to
stop by the organization's "head
quarters" and talk to somebody
who looks like they might know
what they're doing. The Band
Shak on Galvez Avenue is home

to the Band, The Daily's offices
are housed in the Storke Student
Publications Building on the cor
ner of Lomita and Santa Teresa
near the Terman Engineering
Building. You could also just call
the particular organization you're
interested in. Best of luck!
