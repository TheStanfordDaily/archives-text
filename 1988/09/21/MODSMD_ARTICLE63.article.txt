# Band and symphony travel overseas
## 
### Jock Friedly 
Stanford's two largest musical
groups boarded airplanes this
summer, taking their music, and
their antics, overseas.
In June and July, the 90-
member Stanford Symphony Or
chestra stunned packed houses in
Japan, Singapore and South
Korea during its 19-day Asian
tour. Shortly after the Symphony
came back to U.S. soil, the Stan
ford Band took their historical —
and hysterical — antics down un
der to the World Fair in Australia.
In an effort to motivate and
inspire, the Orchestra's Asian
tour demonstrated the Stanford
group's potential to be one of the
top college symphonies in the
country, Assistant Conductor
Charles Barberin said.
In the past, the Orchestra had
a tough time recruiting new
musicians because "no one made
a conscious effort to make it

known how good the orchestra
really was," Barberin explained.
But when Andor Toth, the Or
chestra's new conductor, took
over the musicians became more
unified, more determined.
"Under the baton ot Andor
Toth, the change has been phe
nomenal," Barberin said. "We've
got a solid group of students
strongly committed to the musical
excellence of the orchestra."
Because their international tow
met with such success, the Or
chestra is planning a "mini-tour"
in the United States for this year.
The group is also looking ahead
to 1990 and working to set up a
tour in the Soviet Union. The
1990 tour is still very much in
the planning stage, according to
Toth.
While Orchestra members take
pride in their "serious" music, the
Band's musicians admit that fun
and play is what they do best.
"In most organizations, if you

run around and act crazy, they
will think you are stupid. But
that's what the Band is all about,"
junior Charles Bunch, a trumpet
player, said.
And the Band's antics have be
come quite well-known. Members
of the Band say half their fun
comes from doing things they
would never try outside of the
group, like dropping their pants
in public.
This July, the Band received a
warm Aussie welcome when 62 of
its members traveled to Australia.
The musicians spent two weeks
performing at the World's Fair in
Melbourne, the Australian Na
tional University and Sydney Uni
versity.
During their stay, the Band ap
peared on the front page of a local
newspaper after they performed
in the water — traditional Band
style — at an Australian Sea

According to junior Cam
Mitchner, the Band was chosen to
play at the World's Fair because
organizers believed that Stan
ford's musical group typifies the
California lifestyle. "They think
we portray the California style of
living better than other California
bands, like the USC Trojan
Band," Mitchner said.
But aspiring student musicians,
as well as vocalists, don't need to
pack it up and travel half-way
around the world to perform.

of Music sponsors plenty of dif
ferent ensembles to satisfy jazz
and classical music lovers alike.
