# Stanford Museum of Art displays exciting collections year round

Many people only appreciate the
Stanford University Museum of
Art after they graduate and
return to visit their alma mater,
but the museum's outstanding
collections are enjoyable through
out the year.
A special project of Jane Stan
ford, the museum was built in
honor of her only son who died
at 15 and wanted to be a museum
curator when he grew up. Jane
Stanford poured tremendous en
ergy into the museum until she
died in 1905. At that time, the
Stanford Museum was the largest
privately owned museum building
in the world, even larger than the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The 1906 earthquake destroyed
four-fifths of the structure, and
it stayed in poor condition until
1963, when Art Professor and
Museum Director Lorenz Eitner
joined the Art Department and
took on the project of renovating
it.
The T.W. Stanford Art Gallery,
located next to Hoover Tower, was

built in 1917, and took over some
of the museum's functions until
the museum was restored.
The museum building itself is
special for many reasons. Its was
the fifth university museum of
any size built in its century. Its
fabric of steel-reinforced concrete,
erected by Ernest Ransome, is the
earliest large building of this ma
terial west of the Mississippi. Fur
thermore, out of sheer extrava
gance, the Stanfords had their ar
chitects model the museum after
the National Museum of Athens,
ushering in the neoclassical trend
in American museum design.
Museums are as indispensible
to art scholars as libraries are to
academic scholars. As Eitner
wrote in the 1983 Fall Stanford
Magazine, museums, "are espe
cially needed on American cam
puses, which are often remote
from centers of art, to counteract
the academic tendency of sub
stituting slides, photographs and
verbal description for the direct
experience of original works."
In addition to the permanent
collections of European art and

19th century American paintings,
the museum's holdings include
Northwest American Indian wood
sculptures, Japanese lacquers,
African art and a special collection
of personal items from the Stan
ford family.
Throughout the year special col
lections are displayed, but always
visible are the statues by Rodin
in the outdoor sculpture garden.
Financier B. Gerald Cantor has
gathered at Stanford the largest
Rodin collection in the world. Ac
cording to Professor of Art His
tory and Curator of the Rodin
Collection Albert Elsen, Rodin is
fascinating because, "he's inter
esting to so many different groups
of people — lay people, artists,
doctors dancers, actors and his
torians all enjoy something differ
ent about him."
A reproduction of Rodin's most
famous work, "The Thinker," will
be added to the collection in Oc
tober.

The Rodin sculpture garden draws many visitors to marvel at the large collection of the famous
artist's work. In October, Rodin's most famous work titled "The Thinker" will be added to the garden.
