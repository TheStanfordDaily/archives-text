# Stanford Museum of Art displays exciting collections year round

### Kevin Wacknov 
Many people only appreciate the
Stanford University Museum of
Art after they graduate and
return to visit their alma mater,
but the museum's outstanding
collections are enjoyable through
out the year.
A special project of Jane Stan
ford, the museum was built in
honor of her only son who died
at 15 and wanted to be a museum
curator when he grew up. Jane
Stanford poured tremendous en
ergy into the museum until she
died in 1905. At that time, the
Stanford Museum was the largest
privately owned museum building
in the world, even larger than the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The 1906 earthquake destroyed
four-fifths of the structure, and
it stayed in poor condition until
1963, when Art Professor and
Museum Director Lorenz Eitner
joined the Art Department and
took on the project of renovating
it.
The T.W. Stanford Art Gallery,
located next to Hoover Tower, was

built in 1917, and took over some
of the museum's functions until
the museum was restored.
The museum building itself is
special for many reasons. Its was
the fifth university museum of
any size built in its century. Its
fabric of steel-reinforced concrete,
erected by Ernest Ransome, is the
earliest large building of this ma
terial west of the Mississippi. Fur
thermore, out of sheer extrava
gance, the Stanfords had their ar
chitects model the museum after
the National Museum of Athens,
ushering in the neoclassical trend
in American museum design.
Museums are as indispensible
to art scholars as libraries are to
academic scholars. As Eitner
wrote in the 1983 Fall Stanford
Magazine, museums, "are espe
cially needed on American cam
puses, which are often remote
from centers of art, to counteract
the academic tendency of sub
stituting slides, photographs and
verbal description for the direct
experience of original works."
In addition to the permanent
collections of European art and

19th century American paintings,
the museum's holdings include
Northwest American Indian wood
sculptures, Japanese lacquers,
African art and a special collection
of personal items from the Stan
ford family.
Throughout the year special col
lections are displayed, but always
visible are the statues by Rodin
in the outdoor sculpture garden.
Financier B. Gerald Cantor has
gathered at Stanford the largest
Rodin collection in the world. Ac
cording to Professor of Art His
tory and Curator of the Rodin
Collection Albert Elsen, Rodin is
fascinating because, "he's inter
esting to so many different groups
of people — lay people, artists,
doctors dancers, actors and his
torians all enjoy something differ
ent about him."
A reproduction of Rodin's most
famous work, "The Thinker," will
be added to the collection in Oc
tober.

aquatints on display from Sept.
27 to Nov. 27. Many of his works
are in series, with possibly six or
14 variations before the final
print. Visitors have a chance to
see "how an artist finally con
verges to a work that satisfies
him," said Associate Director and
Curator of Collections Carol Os
borne.
Items from the printing process,
including a sketch and several
plates, are included in the exhibit.
Lobdell, who has taught at
Stanford for over 20 years, was
honored in 1987 with an award
for distinguished achievement in
painting by the American Acad

emy of Arts and Letters. They
praised him for his, "splendid his
tory of making powerful and com
pelling images." This award is
given only once every five years.
According to Lobdell's printer,
Kelso, "Lobdell focuses his atten
tion ... of the relationships
among different worlds, their
various forces and their in
habitants. There is a definite
sense of existence both greater
and smaller than ourselves, and
with a marvelous open
handedness Lobdell encourages us
to identify with all of it."
Two prominent American
painters also working today are
Richard Diebenkorn and Wayne
Thiebaud. They both have pieces
on exhibit at Stanford.
Diebenkorn was an undergradu

ate at Stanford.
For those who want to be mys
tified, an optical illusion by Robert
Irwin, untitled but affectionately
called "the disk" by Museum
curators, is made of sprayed lac
quer on aluminum.
If you like turn of the century
art, be sure to check out Whistler.
James Whistler was the best
known American painter of his
time, and the museum has, "an
exceptionally choice collection" of
his work, Osborne said.
Perhaps African masks interest
you. Several new African acquisi
tions are now on display. "Mask,"
a white painted wooden mask, was
made by the Vuvi tribe in the
Gabonese Republic. A mask by
the Ibo tribe of Nigeria stands
near it. A wooden male figure

from the Songe tribe, and a
"Female Spirit Figure" are dis
played as well.
Most exciting to the school
children who visit the Muesum is
the Egyptian mummy, says Os
borne. That and other Egyptian
holdings have been placed in a
spacious rotunda.
"Fay Goodwin — Land" is a
museum exhibit of Landscape
photographs of Great Britain
made between 1973 and 1983,
from the photographer's book
"Land." There will be no sched
uled tours for this exhibit.
The T.W. Stanford Art Gallery
has an exhibit, "America Calls,"
consisting of World War I posters
from the museum, from Oct. 4 to
Dec. 18. There are no scheduled
tours for "America Calls."
