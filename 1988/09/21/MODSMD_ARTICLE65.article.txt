# Public Service Center plans busy year

Once a week, for the last four
years, Julie Switzer took time off
from a hectic Stanford schedule,
hopped on her scooter and went
to visit her 96-year-old adopted
grandmother who lives in down
town Palo Alto.
Although Switzer admits that
it is sometimes tough making
time for her elderly friend, she
says the visits are always well
worth the effort.
"She's incredible," boasted
Switzer, a Stanford alumna who
graduated last June. "I talk with
her about everything."
Switzer excitedly told of her
plans to give her grandmother 20
roses on her 96th birthday.
Stanford's Public Service Cen
ter matched up Switzer and about
40 other students last year with
elderly people who were looking
for some extra companionship.
The "Adopt-A-Grandparent"
program is one of many commu
nity service projects coordinated
by the Public Service Center. The
center, located next to the campus
bike shop in Owen House, has

programs for students who want
to help the homeless, feed the
hungry or tutor local children.
According to Catherine Milton,
director of the Public Service Cen
ter, the center's objective is to
translate students' interests into
community service.
"We can take any student's in
terest and see how it fits into any
public service work," said Milton,
explaining that the center is really
geared toward students.
The center, in addition to its
thorough computer listings of
private and public internships,
runs about a dozen programs. And
on top of this year-round activity,
the fall is a particularly exciting
and active time for the center.
The center will sponsor a slew
of events in the next three months
to raise awareness of problems in
the community and increase stu
dent involvement in public service.
A traditional event in the fall
is "Reach Out Today," a one-day,
campus-wide public service event.
On Oct. 29, more than 800 stu
dents will volunteer a few hours
of their Saturday to reach out and
help the community. For the

event, dorm groups often renovate
a community building, host a field
day for children or visit the elder
ly. Last year, participants from
Lagunita went door-to-door in
Menlo Park to let residents know
about a free literacy project.
Anna Waring, publication and
publicity coordinator for the cen
ter, describes Rcach Out Today
as a "great event," explaining that
it is one of the best ways for
students to get involved in public
service because the possible activ
ities for the event are so vast.
"Students have more opportu
nity to get directly involved in
community service through Reach
Out Today," said Waring.
Another upcoming event coor
dinated by the center is Stanford's
annual "You Can Make Difference
Conference. The conference
proved itself a veritable extrava
ganza last year, drawing a crowd
of some 1500.
Each year the conference
focuses on a specific societal prob
lem, hosting speakers and

workshops focusing on the topic.
This year the environment will be
the focus of the conference with
Ted Koppel as moderator and
keynote speaker Peter Raven of
the National Academy of Sciences
and former biology professor at
Stanford.
The conference is the center's
attempt to actively reach out and
educate the Stanford community.
"The main objective of the con
ference is to educate people on a
topic, empowering them to act on
what they learn," explained Mil
ton.
One of the main year-round ac
tivities of the center is helping
students find and finance public
service internships all over the
country.
Specifically, Stanford-In-
Government, located on the sec
ond floor of Owen House, helps
students find government intern
ships, frequently offering students
fellowships to finance these in
ternships. SIG also sponsors po
litical speakers on campus year
round.
The Stanford International De
velopment Network, also located
on the second floor of Owen
House, promotes involvement in
anything from organizing confer
ences and seminars on Third
World development issues to eval
uating development projects and
selecting future projects for fund
ing.
