# University provides help when problems mount
## 
### 
Orientation Week can make life
at Stanford seem like a luxury
cruise. Fun in the sun and night
life that lasts into the wee hours
of the morning.
When you catch on that no one
at Stanford calls anything by its
real name, you feel like you have
everything under control.
By then classes begin. The first
time you go to the basement to
wash your clothes, you realize
that someone out there thinks
three washing machines and one
working dryer are enough for 100
people. You come face to face with
the bitter truth. You have nothing
clean to wear and no one can do
anything about it.
It's true that when things quiet
down, you're on your own. But
don't despair. There are plenty of
people in and around the Univer
sity to give you help when you
need it. Whether you go to talk
to someone about academic,
health or personal concerns, you
can find people who understand
the pressures you face.
The Dean of Student Affairs
Office (DOSA), located in room
323 of Old Union, is charged with
the welfare of all students and
student families here.
The Housing Center, student

voluntary organizations, physical
and mental health care, child care,
residential programs and advising,
job placement and services for dis
abled students are among the
many student services DOSA coor
dinates. Appointments may be
made by calling 723-2733, but you
are encouraged to just show up.
Residential Education
One of the principal goals of
Residential Education is to give
students a supportive, helpful en
vironment in which to study, live
and conduct the other activities
that go with college life.
Although the resident assis
tants (RAs) and resident fellows
(RFs) in your dorm may not know
the answer to every question or
problem you have, they probably
can point you in the right direc
tion.
RAs are survivors of the fresh
man experience who are there to
be steady "anchors" for you as
you go through your first year on
the Farm. RFs are faculty mem
bers who are interested enough in
the residential education process
to live with students. Both RAs
and RFs are interested in you â€”
take the trouble to get to know
them, rewarding and lifelong

friendships can be formed.
RAs and RFs also act as liasons
between you and your academic
advisors during the first year.
They may arrange for your ad
visor to come to dinner regularly
or plan other events.
Academic help
If you need to know about pro
cedures, the Registrar's Office on
the first floor of Old Union is the
place to go. The office oversees
all matters concerning registra
tion, adding or droping courses,
grades, Commencement and
transcripts. The Registrar also
distributes the "Time Schedule,"
the "Information Bulletin" and
the "Summer Session Bulletin;"
handles lost ID cards, and pro
vides spouse cards.
At times, the pace and rigor of
academic life on the Farm can
become a bit overwhelming. So,
if you are worried about losing
sleep* over your work, here are
some places to help sort things
out. Sweet Hall, between Meyer
Library and Stern Hall, is the
place to start. There you'll find
the Center for Teaching and
Learning, where undergraduates
and graduates can find resources
in the areas of study skills,

reading rate improvement and tu
toring in many subjects. The CTL
also provides resources for teach
ing assistants and faculty in teach
ing evaluation and improvement.
Sweet Hall is also the home of
the Undergraduate Advising Cen
ter (UAC), a place to turn if your
assigned advisor isn't meeting
your needs or you just need some
extra advice.
If its papers that make you wish
you had gone to a community col
lege, look to the Term Paper Ad
visory Service located at Meyer
Library and the Tutorial Center
in the English Department.
Health
You know that no amount of
academic advising can help when
your head aches and you have a
hard time getting up for your 1:15
p.m. claSs. Fortunately, the
Cowell Student Health Center is
centrally located and has a 24-
hour emergency number (723-
4861).
Cowell is open on an out-patient
basis Monday through Friday
from 9 a.m. to noon and from
1:30 to 5 p.m. It provides a variety
of medical services free of charge
to registered students. Its physi
cians make referrals to specialists

in the area for other services.
Should you become one of the
many Stanford students who suc
cumb to the dreaded
mononucleosis, Cowell has an in
house infirmary with 100 beds.
You can stay there up to three
months if necessary, and your
friends can visit you if they dare.
Another service at Cowell is
Contraceptive Peer Counseling.
Trained students willing to an
swer your questions about con
traception staff this organization.
They can also field questions
about pregnancy and its problems.
Should you need to consider an
abortion, CPC and Cowell can
help you get information and can
refer you to a local physician.
Planned Parenthood has an of
fice in Palo Alto. The people there
go out of their way to make you
feel comfortable and to give you
the family planning information
you need.
Counseling
Sometimes, you may just need
to talk to someone. Located in
the back of Cowell is Counseling
and Psychological Services. Here
you'll find professionals of all ages
