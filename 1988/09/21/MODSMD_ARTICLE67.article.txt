# Stanford's memorial to son Leland rich with history
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan arrived at
Stanford in the summer of 1891 to be
the University's first president, he
found the countryside enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he wrote
in his autobiography, "extends south
ward 50 miles and more from near the
head of San Francisco Bay. Bounding
it on the southwest rises . . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultuously.. . .
"Immediately behind the University
estate and forming its higher back
ground is the wooded Sierra Morena,
its cloak of redwood, oak and madrono
diversified by thickets of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches the
long, relatively barren and treeless
Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles south
of San Francisco, its favorable climate
assured by its location between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned with an
cient oaks, Sen. Leland Stanford and
his wife, Jane, established a university
on the site of their home in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek. Subsequent pur
chases increased the total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was deeded
to the University in the school's 1885
Grant of Endowment with the stipula

tion that it should never be sold.
To plan construction of the university
he envisioned, Sen. Stanford, in the
summer of 1886, brought then-MIT
President Francis Walker and promi
nent landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted to Palo Alto.
They gave serious thought to locating
the campus in the foothills of the Stan
ford ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the Bay, but
finally decided to locate the school in
the grainfields below. The Senator felt
the flat site would be more practical
for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general plan
for the grounds and buildings, but it
remained for the young Boston archi
tect, Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style of his
late mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent architect
of his time.
Stanford's architectural style is called
Richardsonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanesque, which
is characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial

Church — and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women, were ready for the
University's opening on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the ded
ication, "will have their part in the stu
dent's training. Each stone in the quad
rangle shall teach its lesson of grace
and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cornell
pronounced the Stanford buildings the
most beautiful college architecture in
America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morning of
April 18, 1906, the ground beneath
Stanford's new buildings shook
vigorously for nearly a minute. The
great earthquake of 1906, which
resulted in the near total destruction
of downtown San Francisco, killed two
men on campus and caused millions of
dollars of damage to the young univer
sity.
The ponderous tower of Memorial
Church, with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel, and the
concussion blew out the front wall. The
rose window and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as rubble
in the Inner Quad.
