# Stanford's memorial to son Leland rich with history
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan arrived at
Stanford in the summer of 1891 to be
the University's first president, he
found the countryside enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he wrote
in his autobiography, "extends south
ward 50 miles and more from near the
head of San Francisco Bay. Bounding
it on the southwest rises . . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultuously.. . .
"Immediately behind the University
estate and forming its higher back
ground is the wooded Sierra Morena,
its cloak of redwood, oak and madrono
diversified by thickets of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches the
long, relatively barren and treeless
Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles south
of San Francisco, its favorable climate
assured by its location between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned with an
cient oaks, Sen. Leland Stanford and
his wife, Jane, established a university
on the site of their home in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek. Subsequent pur
chases increased the total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was deeded
to the University in the school's 1885
Grant of Endowment with the stipula

tion that it should never be sold.
To plan construction of the university
he envisioned, Sen. Stanford, in the
summer of 1886, brought then-MIT
President Francis Walker and promi
nent landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted to Palo Alto.
They gave serious thought to locating
the campus in the foothills of the Stan
ford ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the Bay, but
finally decided to locate the school in
the grainfields below. The Senator felt
the flat site would be more practical
for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general plan
for the grounds and buildings, but it
remained for the young Boston archi
tect, Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style of his
late mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent architect
of his time.
Stanford's architectural style is called
Richardsonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanesque, which
is characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial

Church — and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women, were ready for the
University's opening on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the ded
ication, "will have their part in the stu
dent's training. Each stone in the quad
rangle shall teach its lesson of grace
and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cornell
pronounced the Stanford buildings the
most beautiful college architecture in
America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morning of
April 18, 1906, the ground beneath
Stanford's new buildings shook
vigorously for nearly a minute. The
great earthquake of 1906, which
resulted in the near total destruction
of downtown San Francisco, killed two
men on campus and caused millions of
dollars of damage to the young univer
sity.
The ponderous tower of Memorial
Church, with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel, and the
concussion blew out the front wall. The
rose window and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as rubble
in the Inner Quad.

The original grant founding Stanford resides in the University Archives. The grant
transformed Senator Stanford's farm into a private university and memorial for his son.
Memorial Arch, the centra
structure of the Outer Quad —
100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged be
yond repair. So were a library and
a gymnasium that had been just
short of completion. None of these
were replaced.
Reconstruction cost more thatn
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Senior in what has
come to be known as the "Earth
quake Class" were voted their
degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young uni

versity quickly rebuilt, pursuing
a construction project that was
begun in 1886 and has continued
to the present day.
Construction of the University
has taken place on approximately
5000 acres reserved by the Board
of Trustees for educational uses.
This land is the heart of the Stan
ford holdings, running generally
from El Camino to the Foothills.
The areas designated for "light
use" include the arboretum area
between the Quad and El Camino
and the Foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and bi
ological sciences.
The Inner and Outer Quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the University's
heart. The Inner Quad's 12 class
room buildings, two of which are

now used by the president and
his staff, date from the time the
University opened in 1891. The
Outer Quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.
The size and prominence of
Memorial Church in the Inner
Quad reflects the Stanfords' deep
religious faith, even though they
were followers of no particular
denomination. In the University's
Founding Grant, the Stanfords'
directed the trustees "to have
taught in the University the im
mortality of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the

University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans of the Uni
versity, the central site in the
Quad was reserved for the church,
though construction was deferred
for several years. When Sen. Stan
ford died in 1893, his widow or
dered that the church be built as
a memorial to him.
Jane Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the
Roselli fresco of the "Last Sup
per" in the Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that
cover the interior walls are largely
drawn from the Old Testament,
depicting the history of redemp

tion. The largest mosaic, however,
occupying most of the facade of
the church and containing 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Venice,
but the 80-foot spire, housing
clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary
in 1941. The tower and the ad
joining Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing (opened in 1967) house the
vast documentary collections of
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions

of items that include books, doc
uments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters, maps
and photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World War
I when he headed the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. Struck with
the thought that his relief work
placed him in a position to docu
ment the war, Hoover shipped
crates of material to the library
at Stanford, his alma mater, and
laid the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this insti
tution is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace."
The institution has more ma
terial on communism than can be
found anywhere outside the So
viet Union. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hitler
and the Nazi movement in exis
tence today.
With these resources, the insti
tution serves as a center for ad
vanced study and research on
problems of social, political and
economic change in the 20th cen
tury.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall Auditorium, dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as
a memorial to Stanford students
and faculty slain in World War I,
the auditorium also houses
plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11, the Korean
War and the Vietnam War. The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-
square-foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal

point of the plaza is a tall, free
form fountain executed in bronze
by San Francisco sculptor Aris
tides Demetrios. Students call it
"the Claw."
Bordered by the Bookstore, post
office, Tresidder Memorial Union,
the music building and Old Union
— which houses several student
services — the plaza is a campus
crossroads.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San Fran
cisco into its present quarters on
the west side of campus in 1959.
The $21 million structure consists
of three sections — the hospital,
the outpatient clinics and the
teaching laboratories and class
rooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Pres
ident Ford dedicated the $11.9
million facility. The school con
sists of four buildings: the Robert
Crown Library, which can seat
the entire law student body at the
same time; Frederick I. Richman
Hall, which contains the class
rooms and moot court; the James
Irvine Gallery, which contains the
faculty and student meeting
rooms and lounges; and 600-seat
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is
the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve. Rising steeply from
Searsville Lake, the 735-acre
preserve contains a unique asso

ciation of rock ledges and outcrop
pings, oak dotted savannahs,
chaparral, redwoods, streams and
pools. The preserve is used regu
larly for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm in
the Stanford foothills one of the
most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation. Its
scientists made the first radar
contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the an
tennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
through the use of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) operates
a two-mile-long atom smasher on
460 acres along Sand Hill Road.
The $114 million machine,
financed by the Atomic Energy
Commission and completed in
1966, fires the tube rather than
whirling protons in circles, as
most atom smashers do. The ma
chine develops an energy of 20
billion electron volts.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325 mil
lion to pay for new campus facil
ities and improvements, including
campus landmarks such as Maples
Pavilion, Meyer Library, the
Green Library annex, the Terman
Engineering Center, the Mudd
Chemistry Building, Sweet Hall,
the Center for Integrated Systems
and Braun Music Center.

and photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World War
I when he headed the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. Struck with
the thought that his relief work
placed him in a position to docu
ment the war, Hoover shipped
crates of material to the library
at Stanford, his alma mater, and
laid the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this insti
tution is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace."
The institution has more ma
terial on communism than can be
found anywhere outside the So
viet Union. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hitler
and the Nazi movement in exis
tence today.
With these resources, the insti
tution serves as a center for ad
vanced study and research on
problems of social, political and
economic change in the 20th cen
tury.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall Auditorium, dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as
a memorial to Stanford students
and faculty slain in World War I,
the auditorium also houses
plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11, the Korean
War and the Vietnam War. The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-
square-foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal

point of the plaza is a tall, free
form fountain executed in bronze
by San Francisco sculptor Aris
tides Demetrios. Students call it
"the Claw."
Bordered by the Bookstore, post
office, Tresidder Memorial Union,
the music building and Old Union
— which houses several student
services — the plaza is a campus
crossroads.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San Fran
cisco into its present quarters on
the west side of campus in 1959.
The $21 million structure consists
of three sections — the hospital,
the outpatient clinics and the
teaching laboratories and class
rooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Pres
ident Ford dedicated the $11.9
million facility. The school con
sists of four buildings: the Robert
Crown Library, which can seat
the entire law student body at the
same time; Frederick I. Richman
Hall, which contains the class
rooms and moot court; the James
Irvine Gallery, which contains the
faculty and student meeting
rooms and lounges; and 600-seat
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is
the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve. Rising steeply from
Searsville Lake, the 735-acre
preserve contains a unique asso

ciation of rock ledges and outcrop
pings, oak dotted savannahs,
chaparral, redwoods, streams and
pools. The preserve is used regu
larly for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm in
the Stanford foothills one of the
most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation. Its
scientists made the first radar
contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the an
tennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
through the use of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) operates
a two-mile-long atom smasher on
460 acres along Sand Hill Road.
The $114 million machine,
financed by the Atomic Energy
Commission and completed in
1966, fires the tube rather than
whirling protons in circles, as
most atom smashers do. The ma
chine develops an energy of 20
billion electron volts.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325 mil
lion to pay for new campus facil
ities and improvements, including
campus landmarks such as Maples
Pavilion, Meyer Library, the
Green Library annex, the Terman
Engineering Center, the Mudd
Chemistry Building, Sweet Hall,
the Center for Integrated Systems
and Braun Music Center.
When David Starr Jordan arrived at
Stanford in the summer of 1891 to be
the University's first president, he
found the countryside enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he wrote
in his autobiography, "extends south
ward 50 miles and more from near the
head of San Francisco Bay. Bounding
it on the southwest rises . . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultuously.. . .
"Immediately behind the University
estate and forming its higher back
ground is the wooded Sierra Morena,
its cloak of redwood, oak and madrono
diversified by thickets of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches the
long, relatively barren and treeless
Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles south
of San Francisco, its favorable climate
assured by its location between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned with an
cient oaks, Sen. Leland Stanford and
his wife, Jane, established a university
on the site of their home in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek. Subsequent pur
chases increased the total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was deeded
to the University in the school's 1885
Grant of Endowment with the stipula

tion that it should never be sold.
To plan construction of the university
he envisioned, Sen. Stanford, in the
summer of 1886, brought then-MIT
President Francis Walker and promi
nent landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted to Palo Alto.
They gave serious thought to locating
the campus in the foothills of the Stan
ford ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the Bay, but
finally decided to locate the school in
the grainfields below. The Senator felt
the flat site would be more practical
for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general plan
for the grounds and buildings, but it
remained for the young Boston archi
tect, Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style of his
late mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent architect
of his time.
Stanford's architectural style is called
Richardsonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanesque, which
is characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial

Church — and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women, were ready for the
University's opening on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the ded
ication, "will have their part in the stu
dent's training. Each stone in the quad
rangle shall teach its lesson of grace
and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cornell
pronounced the Stanford buildings the
most beautiful college architecture in
America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morning of
April 18, 1906, the ground beneath
Stanford's new buildings shook
vigorously for nearly a minute. The
great earthquake of 1906, which
resulted in the near total destruction
of downtown San Francisco, killed two
men on campus and caused millions of
dollars of damage to the young univer
sity.
The ponderous tower of Memorial
Church, with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel, and the
concussion blew out the front wall. The
rose window and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as rubble
in the Inner Quad.

The original grant founding Stanford resides in the University Archives. The grant
transformed Senator Stanford's farm into a private university and memorial for his son.
Memorial Arch, the centra
structure of the Outer Quad —
100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged be
yond repair. So were a library and
a gymnasium that had been just
short of completion. None of these
were replaced.
Reconstruction cost more thatn
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Senior in what has
come to be known as the "Earth
quake Class" were voted their
degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young uni

versity quickly rebuilt, pursuing
a construction project that was
begun in 1886 and has continued
to the present day.
Construction of the University
has taken place on approximately
5000 acres reserved by the Board
of Trustees for educational uses.
This land is the heart of the Stan
ford holdings, running generally
from El Camino to the Foothills.
The areas designated for "light
use" include the arboretum area
between the Quad and El Camino
and the Foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and bi
ological sciences.
The Inner and Outer Quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the University's
heart. The Inner Quad's 12 class
room buildings, two of which are

now used by the president and
his staff, date from the time the
University opened in 1891. The
Outer Quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.
The size and prominence of
Memorial Church in the Inner
Quad reflects the Stanfords' deep
religious faith, even though they
were followers of no particular
denomination. In the University's
Founding Grant, the Stanfords'
directed the trustees "to have
taught in the University the im
mortality of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the

University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans of the Uni
versity, the central site in the
Quad was reserved for the church,
though construction was deferred
for several years. When Sen. Stan
ford died in 1893, his widow or
dered that the church be built as
a memorial to him.
Jane Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the
Roselli fresco of the "Last Sup
per" in the Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that
cover the interior walls are largely
drawn from the Old Testament,
depicting the history of redemp

tion. The largest mosaic, however,
occupying most of the facade of
the church and containing 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Venice,
but the 80-foot spire, housing
clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary
in 1941. The tower and the ad
joining Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing (opened in 1967) house the
vast documentary collections of
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions

of items that include books, doc
uments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters, maps
and photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World War

and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cornell
pronounced the Stanford buildings the
most beautiful college architecture in
America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morning of
April 18, 1906, the ground beneath
Stanford's new buildings shook
vigorously for nearly a minute. The
great earthquake of 1906, which
resulted in the near total destruction
of downtown San Francisco, killed two
men on campus and caused millions of
dollars of damage to the young univer
sity.
The ponderous tower of Memorial
Church, with its clocks, chimes and
spire, crashed into the chancel, and the
concussion blew out the front wall. The
rose window and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the Mount
that had graced the facade lay as rubble
in the Inner Quad.

The original grant founding Stanford resides in the University Archives. The grant
transformed Senator Stanford's farm into a private university and memorial for his son.
Memorial Arch, the centra
structure of the Outer Quad —
100 feet high and decorated with
a frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged be
yond repair. So were a library and
a gymnasium that had been just
short of completion. None of these
were replaced.
Reconstruction cost more thatn
$2 million. Classes were dismissed
until the fall. Senior in what has
come to be known as the "Earth
quake Class" were voted their
degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young uni

versity quickly rebuilt, pursuing
a construction project that was
begun in 1886 and has continued
to the present day.
Construction of the University
has taken place on approximately
5000 acres reserved by the Board
of Trustees for educational uses.
This land is the heart of the Stan
ford holdings, running generally
from El Camino to the Foothills.
The areas designated for "light
use" include the arboretum area
between the Quad and El Camino
and the Foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and bi
ological sciences.
The Inner and Outer Quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the University's
heart. The Inner Quad's 12 class
room buildings, two of which are

now used by the president and
his staff, date from the time the
University opened in 1891. The
Outer Quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedicated.
The size and prominence of
Memorial Church in the Inner
Quad reflects the Stanfords' deep
religious faith, even though they
were followers of no particular
denomination. In the University's
Founding Grant, the Stanfords'
directed the trustees "to have
taught in the University the im
mortality of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the high
est duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the

University were to be nonsec
tarian and at no time tied to any
particular denomination.
In the original plans of the Uni
versity, the central site in the
Quad was reserved for the church,
though construction was deferred
for several years. When Sen. Stan
ford died in 1893, his widow or
dered that the church be built as
a memorial to him.
Jane Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining
papal permission to copy the
Roselli fresco of the "Last Sup
per" in the Sistine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics that
cover the interior walls are largely
drawn from the Old Testament,
depicting the history of redemp

tion. The largest mosaic, however,
occupying most of the facade of
the church and containing 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on the
Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely dis
mantled and rebuilt around a steel
framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Venice,
but the 80-foot spire, housing
clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at
the University's 50th anniversary
in 1941. The tower and the ad
joining Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing (opened in 1967) house the
vast documentary collections of
the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions

of items that include books, doc
uments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters, maps
and photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the li
brary collection during World War
I when he headed the Commission
for Relief in Belgium. Struck with
the thought that his relief work
placed him in a position to docu
ment the war, Hoover shipped
crates of material to the library
at Stanford, his alma mater, and
laid the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony, Hoover
said: "The purpose of this insti
tution is to promote peace. Its
records stand as a challenge to
those who promote war. They
should attract those who search
for peace."
The institution has more ma
terial on communism than can be
found anywhere outside the So
viet Union. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hitler
and the Nazi movement in exis
tence today.
With these resources, the insti
tution serves as a center for ad
vanced study and research on
problems of social, political and
economic change in the 20th cen
tury.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall Auditorium, dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily
through student contributions as
a memorial to Stanford students
and faculty slain in World War I,
the auditorium also houses
plaques honoring the Stanford
dead of World War 11, the Korean
War and the Vietnam War. The
main auditorium seats 1700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the Quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-
square-foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The focal

point of the plaza is a tall, free
form fountain executed in bronze
by San Francisco sculptor Aris
tides Demetrios. Students call it
"the Claw."
Bordered by the Bookstore, post
office, Tresidder Memorial Union,
the music building and Old Union
— which houses several student
services — the plaza is a campus
crossroads.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San Fran
cisco into its present quarters on
the west side of campus in 1959.
The $21 million structure consists
of three sections — the hospital,
the outpatient clinics and the
teaching laboratories and class
rooms.
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quadrangle
since September 1975, when Pres
ident Ford dedicated the $11.9
million facility. The school con
sists of four buildings: the Robert
Crown Library, which can seat
the entire law student body at the
same time; Frederick I. Richman
Hall, which contains the class
rooms and moot court; the James
Irvine Gallery, which contains the
faculty and student meeting
rooms and lounges; and 600-seat
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus, the
University operates its science
"farms," the oldest of which is
the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve. Rising steeply from
Searsville Lake, the 735-acre
preserve contains a unique asso

ciation of rock ledges and outcrop
pings, oak dotted savannahs,
chaparral, redwoods, streams and
pools. The preserve is used regu
larly for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm in
the Stanford foothills one of the
most productive and varied pro
grams of ionospheric and inter
planetary radio investigation. Its
scientists made the first radar
contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the an
tennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
through the use of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) operates
a two-mile-long atom smasher on
460 acres along Sand Hill Road.
The $114 million machine,
financed by the Atomic Energy
Commission and completed in
1966, fires the tube rather than
whirling protons in circles, as
most atom smashers do. The ma
chine develops an energy of 20
billion electron volts.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325 mil
lion to pay for new campus facil
ities and improvements, including
campus landmarks such as Maples
Pavilion, Meyer Library, the
Green Library annex, the Terman
Engineering Center, the Mudd
Chemistry Building, Sweet Hall,
the Center for Integrated Systems
and Braun Music Center.
When David Starr Jordan arrived at
Stanford in the summer of 1891 to be
the University's first president, he
found the countryside enthralling.
"The Santa Clara Valley," he wrote
in his autobiography, "extends south
ward 50 miles and more from near the
head of San Francisco Bay. Bounding
it on the southwest rises . . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty camp of
mountains pitched tumultuously.. . .
"Immediately behind the University
estate and forming its higher back
ground is the wooded Sierra Morena,
its cloak of redwood, oak and madrono
diversified by thickets of chemisal. . . .
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches the
long, relatively barren and treeless
Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles south
of San Francisco, its favorable climate
assured by its location between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned with an
cient oaks, Sen. Leland Stanford and
his wife, Jane, established a university
on the site of their home in Palo Alto.
The first parcel of land, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek. Subsequent pur
chases increased the total to 8250 acres.
All of the Stanfords' land was deeded
to the University in the school's 1885
Grant of Endowment with the stipula

tion that it should never be sold.
To plan construction of the university
he envisioned, Sen. Stanford, in the
summer of 1886, brought then-MIT
President Francis Walker and promi
nent landscape architect Frederick Law
Olmsted to Palo Alto.
They gave serious thought to locating
the campus in the foothills of the Stan
ford ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the Bay, but
finally decided to locate the school in
the grainfields below. The Senator felt
the flat site would be more practical
for later expansion.
Olmsted worked out a general plan
for the grounds and buildings, but it
remained for the young Boston archi
tect, Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style of his
late mentor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent architect
of his time.
Stanford's architectural style is called
Richardsonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanesque, which
is characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The Inner Quad of 12 classroom
buildings — with the central place
reserved for the future Memorial

Church — and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and Roble
Hall for women, were ready for the
University's opening on Oct. 1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Jordan said at the ded
ication, "will have their part in the stu
dent's training. Each stone in the quad
rangle shall teach its lesson of grace
and genuineness."
President Andrew White of Cornell
pronounced the Stanford buildings the
most beautiful college architecture in
America.
Just before 5 a.m. on the morning of
