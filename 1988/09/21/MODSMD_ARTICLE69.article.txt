The SUGGESTED TRAVEL ROUTES map
shows the Stanford campus routes considered
best for night-time pedestrian and bicycle
travel. These routes have been surveyed by
the Stanford Department of Public Safety
(DPS) in an effort to offer the safest thorough
fares possible.
Although the suggested travel routes may
not be the shortest distance between two
points, the DPS strongly recommends their
use. They do not absolutely guarantee your
safety but are preferable to other routes be
cause they:
■ are well traveled;
■ are adequately lit;
■ are located in open-space areas;
■ extend from most of the student living groups
to the academic area;
• allow the quickest access to pay telephones.
(Remember that a call to 911 is free from all
University pay telephones.)
The Department of Public Safety recom
mends that you:
• stay on the suggested routes and avoid
shortcuts;
• stay in the clear, lighted areas of the routes;
■ be especially cautious in and around build
ings;
• note the location of exterior pay telephones
and buildings that are open 24 hours;
■ use a light when riding at night;
• carry purses and briefcases with a firm grip
and close to the body when walking;
■ call 911 (or 9-911 from University phones)
if you are followed or see any suspicious ac
tivity;
