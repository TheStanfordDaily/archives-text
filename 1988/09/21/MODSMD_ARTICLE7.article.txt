# Born leader has eyes on political scene
## 
### Mica Martin 
Freshman Tony Ortiz expects that his Stan
ford experience will be like drifiting in a sea
of standouts.
But politcal savvy should help keep Ortiz
very much afloat during his time here.
"I'll be starting at the bottom of the pile
... I want to aim high," says the determined
freshman from Rosewell, New Mexico.
In high school, Ortez gained hands-on po
litical experience that put him in the public
limelight. He represented New Mexico at a
national leadership conference and was chosen
as the top student leader in the nation, an
honor accompanied by an $11,500 scholarship.
The League of United Latin American Citizens
also honored Ortiz, naming him Hispanic Stu
dent of the Year in 1987.
Ortiz also represented New Mexico at the
Boys' National Conference and the Interna
tional Hugh O'Brian Leadership Conference
in Indianapolis.
This summer, Ortiz traveled to Washington,
D.C. to work with New Mexico Senator Jeff
Bingaman as an intern. He also helped out
on Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis's campaign.
Much of the recognition Ortiz has received
has come as a result of his work within the

New Mexico Association of Student Councils.
The NMASC is a forum for student councils
of the state to gather and discuss leadership
skills and work on mutual problems. Ortiz
recently completed his second consecutive
term as president for the organization.
Taking his leadership skills to the court,
Ortiz was a member of his school's state
champion basketball team. At 6-feet tall, Or
tiz, who played guard, was the shortest mem
ber on the team.
Ortiz had the task of choosing between such
options as Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth
and Yale for college. "The West Coast culture,
lifestyle and weather would be a lot better
for my New Mexico frame of mind," he says.
"And Stanford is the number one school in
the country."
The aspiring politician says he plans to
pursue a major in Political Science. He is
already looking toward law school.
Mica Martin, an incoming freshman as well,
was the features editor of her high school
newspaper.
