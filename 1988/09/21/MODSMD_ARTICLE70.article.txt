# The 						Stanford Hymn
## 
### 
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the coast range lies
In the sunset fire
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
From the foothills to the hay
It shall ring,
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
