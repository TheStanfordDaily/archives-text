# Aspiring novelist hopes to publish
## 
### Helen Willey 
To be a well-known author
is every writer's aspiration.
But for freshman Chris Guar
neri from Yonkers, New York
a concerted effort may be all
it takes.
For Guarneri, writing has
been a hobby since he was eight
years old.
"Writing came naturally to
me," he says."I would just sit
down and start writing." Guar
neri is not referring simply to
keeping a journal, rather he
says that he started by writing
plays and short stories.
In high school, Guarneri
never wrote for the school
newspaper, which only came
out once every three months
or for the school's literary mag
azine — his small private school
never had one. Instead, Guar
neri took his own initiative. "I
just wrote on my own," he says.
Currently, the 17-year-old is
working on a 200-page novel.
According to Guarneri, the
book, which he admits is "slow
going", is about a man who
looks into the future.
"The ideas come from the
back of my head — the best
ones coming from my dreams,"
says Guarneri, who explains
that he tries to capture real
life in his writing.
Having already written 60
pages of his novel, Guarneri
explains that he writes from
episode to episode.
"When it's going well, I write
about a couple of hours a day,"
he says, adding that he has
definite plans to publish his
book when he is finished.
The publication would be a
first for Guarneri who says it
will only happen if he gets an
agent.
"I've tried to get stories pub

lished, but Tve always done it
the dumb way and just sent
my stories directly to a maga
zine, such as the New Yorker,"
he says. "I'm rusty on the more
tactical side of writing "

Columbia University evidently
thought Guarneri's writing
merited recognition. Senior
year he was awarded both the

Brown Book Award for his
achievement in English and the
Columbia Book Award for his
achievement in history.
"The awards came as a com
plete surprise," says Guarneri
modestly. "I never would have
campaigned for anything like
that."
Brown and Columbia Uni
versity, as might be expected,
accepted Guarneri as an un
dergraduate, along with Yale,
Harvard, Dartmouth, Amherst
and other top-notch schools on
the East Coast. So why Stan
ford?
"Mainly because the atmos
phere is more relaxed than
what you get back East," says
Guarneri. "The more serious
the atmosphere is the less cre
ative you are." And a creative
environment is just what Guar
neri needs because he plans to
continue writing here, giving
first priority to his novel.
Though he is the first from
his family to make the trek out
to Stanford, he says that he
has no apprehensions about
coming to Califor ia.
"I'm only looking forward to
it,"says Guarneri.
