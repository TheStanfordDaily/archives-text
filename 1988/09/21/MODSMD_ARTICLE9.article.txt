To say that freshman Megan
Williams takes life too seriously
would be a big mistake.
After graduating from the
Brearley School in New York City,
Williams decided to defer her en
rollment at Stanford for a year.
She packed her bags, flew to Kent,
England and attended Beneden
school, with the help of a schol
arship from the English Speaking
Union.
But about a month before the
end of her studies in Greek, classic
civilizations and English litera
ture, Williams abandoned her
studies and left England to tour

Europe.
"(Beneden) was light years be
hind my high school," she says,
justifying why she packed up early
to spend six weeks in France, Italy
and Greece.
Though she caught the flu in
southern France and had to be
hospitalized, Williams has no
regrets about her escapade. And
the decision to experience Europe
firsthand seems to have turned
out for the best. She plans to
major in classics here and is
looking into adding Latin to her
repertoire of the French, Spanish,
Italian and written Greek she has
already mastered.
Williams cannot pinpoint the

basis for her interest in classics
and admits that the reason is
"mysterious."
It's like doing crossword
puzzles," she explains. "Some
people like it and some people
don't."
"In high school, I took classes
in everything they would let me
because I couldn't make up my
mind. Greek just interested me
the most."
Williams was also nonchalant
about choosing a university. After
narrowing her choices down to
Yale and Stanford, she decided tc
go with the school she knew the
least about — and is looking for
ward to the challenge of Stanford.
"I'm hoping the classes will be
really challenging," she says. Wil
liams is not the only one in her
family excited about her next four
years; both her mother and
grandfather are Stanford gradu
ates.
Unlike England, Wiliams' Stan
ford experience should take her
all the way through to graduation,
she says. Beyond that, Williams
says she is not sure about her
future.
"I worked in a law firm this
summer, so I'm thinking about
Law School, but I'm also consid
ering the art business," says the
easy-going freshman.
