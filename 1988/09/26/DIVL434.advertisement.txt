INTRODUCTORY
DECISION ANALYSIS
EES 31
This course is intended to transform the way participants conceive of decision
making and to empower them to make important decisions in their personal and
professional lives. Decision analysis has grown over the last two decades from a
mathematical theory to a powerful professional discipline used by virtually every
industry and profession. Formerly available only to graduate students, the course
content has been redesigned to eliminate the need for a calculus or probability
prerequisite by reformulating rather than watering down the methods of analysis.
• This course meets the undergraduate distribution requirement in Area 8, Technology and
Applied Science.
• 3 units, T Th 11:00-12:15, McCullough 134, Peter Regan
