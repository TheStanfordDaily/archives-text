# Kennedy underlines unity
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy's Friday night Orien
tation welcome address
delivered a strong message call
ing for student unity and un
derstanding to a roused, vocal
audience.
After stating that the Stan
ford community will not tolerate
affronts to its members for any
reason, Kennedy said, "Bigotry
is out!" — words that brought
the mtgority of the Memorial
Auditorium audience to their
feet in excited applause.
The three other speakers dur
ing the program were Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter, Dean of Under
graduate Studies Thomas
Wasow and Council of President
member Canetta Ivy.
In a departure from a past
emphasis on the community's
cultural diversity, Kennedy
stressed the importance of unity
at Stanford. "We will do well
. . . to remember that our
similarities really are more im

portant than our differences,"
he said.
He then asked that students
"approach one another as mem
bers of the same family . . . the
'Stanford Family.' "
"Diversity is only a means —
a means to an even more im
portant end," he added. "If we

'Approach one an
other as members of
the same family ...
the Stanford family/
— Donald Kennedy

succeed, our heterogeneity will
lead you to real growth in un
derstanding and in comfort with
other cultures."
As with all of Kennedy's Ori
entation welcome speeches, his
latest address carried themes
that differed from those in talks
aimed at past classes.
This year's more upbeat tone
contrasts somewhat from last

year's welcome which contained
a somber reminder to students
that there are serious conse
quences to alcohol abuse.
Kennedy told those entering
freshman, "There is no redeem
ing virtue in binge drinking . . .
it produces plainly dangerous
results." This remark was
prompted by a student's heavy
drinking that resulted in his
death during Stanford's 1985
fraternity rush.
This year, Kennedy made no
mention of a theme that greeted
the freshmen who came in 1985.
In that year's welcome speech,
he urged the members of the
class of 1989 to "question au
thority with that gentle curiosity
that is even harder to answer
than indignation .. . make that
questioning a way of life here."
While this theme was absent
from Kennedy's talk, Ivy urged
students not to accept every
thing the faculty and staff offer
in the classroom.
Receiving applause from the
crowd and a standing ovation
