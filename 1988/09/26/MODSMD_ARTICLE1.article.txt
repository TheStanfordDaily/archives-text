# Kennedy underlines unity
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
University President Donald
Kennedy's Friday night Orien
tation welcome address
delivered a strong message call
ing for student unity and un
derstanding to a roused, vocal
audience.
After stating that the Stan
ford community will not tolerate
affronts to its members for any
reason, Kennedy said, "Bigotry
is out!" — words that brought
the mtgority of the Memorial
Auditorium audience to their
feet in excited applause.
The three other speakers dur
ing the program were Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions
Jean Fetter, Dean of Under
graduate Studies Thomas
Wasow and Council of President
member Canetta Ivy.
In a departure from a past
emphasis on the community's
cultural diversity, Kennedy
stressed the importance of unity
at Stanford. "We will do well
. . . to remember that our
similarities really are more im

portant than our differences,"
he said.
He then asked that students
"approach one another as mem
bers of the same family . . . the
'Stanford Family.' "
"Diversity is only a means —
a means to an even more im
portant end," he added. "If we

'Approach one an
other as members of
the same family ...
the Stanford family/
— Donald Kennedy

succeed, our heterogeneity will
lead you to real growth in un
derstanding and in comfort with
other cultures."
As with all of Kennedy's Ori
entation welcome speeches, his
latest address carried themes
that differed from those in talks
aimed at past classes.
This year's more upbeat tone
contrasts somewhat from last

year's welcome which contained
a somber reminder to students
that there are serious conse
quences to alcohol abuse.
Kennedy told those entering
freshman, "There is no redeem
ing virtue in binge drinking . . .
it produces plainly dangerous
results." This remark was
prompted by a student's heavy
drinking that resulted in his
death during Stanford's 1985
fraternity rush.
This year, Kennedy made no
mention of a theme that greeted
the freshmen who came in 1985.
In that year's welcome speech,
he urged the members of the
class of 1989 to "question au
thority with that gentle curiosity
that is even harder to answer
than indignation .. . make that
questioning a way of life here."
While this theme was absent
from Kennedy's talk, Ivy urged
students not to accept every
thing the faculty and staff offer
in the classroom.
Receiving applause from the
crowd and a standing ovation

Stressing the importance of a unified community, University President Donald Kennedy told
students at Friday's Orientation welcome that they are all members of Stanford's family.
at the conclusion of her speech,
the COP member said it is some
times necessary to go beyond
what is heard in class and read
in books. Ivy said that by taking
the initiative to educate them
selves, students will receive the
greatest benefits for their tuition
dollars.
After Kennedy's speech, reac
tion among students ranged from
delight to disdain. Freshman
Rosean Hamilton said Kennedy
"got me thinking about how I
should take my time" to take ad
vantage of all Stanford has to of
fer.
Freshman Chris Cuckow criti
cized Kennedy's speech saying it
was the "weakest of the four" be
cause his speech was prepared
while the other orators seemed to
have more dynamic statements.
Some students who recognized
Kennedy's subtle allusions to past
campus events and racial prob
lems from past years said his mes
sage about bigotry was necessary
and timely.
Orientation Volunteer Monica
Martinez, a sophomore, said the
president's discussion of bigotry
was powerful and that he con
veyed his message effectively to
the freshman class.

Junior Victor Huang, also an
orientation volunteer, said he
thought this year's speech was an
improvement on last year's "high
and mighty" and "moralistic" Ori
entation address.
The capacity crowd of fresh
man, transfers and orientation
volunteers attentively looked on
as Kennedy warned that students
"should not — must not — let
(intellectual resources) pass you
by."

'Diversity is only a
means — a means to
an even more impor
tant end.'

He added that students need to
stop playing "intellectual possum"
by de-emphasizing their intellec
tual ability and study habits. Ken
nedy said the "central purposes
of this University all pertain to
the human intellect: its improve
ment, its expansion and its appli
cation."
Throughout the speech, Ken
nedy touched on some topics he
usually covers during his welcome
address. Some of these common
themes are class diversity, the im
portance of service to society and
emphasis on thinking for one's
self.

vantage of all Stanford has to of
fer.
Freshman Chris Cuckow criti
cized Kennedy's speech saying it
was the "weakest of the four" be
cause his speech was prepared
while the other orators seemed to
have more dynamic statements.
Some students who recognized
Kennedy's subtle allusions to past
campus events and racial prob
lems from past years said his mes
sage about bigotry was necessary
and timely.
Orientation Volunteer Monica
Martinez, a sophomore, said the
president's discussion of bigotry
was powerful and that he con
veyed his message effectively to
the freshman class.

Junior Victor Huang, also an
orientation volunteer, said he
thought this year's speech was an
improvement on last year's "high
and mighty" and "moralistic" Ori
entation address.
The capacity crowd of fresh
man, transfers and orientation
volunteers attentively looked on
as Kennedy warned that students
"should not — must not — let
(intellectual resources) pass you
by."

'Diversity is only a
means — a means to
an even more impor
tant end.'

He added that students need to
stop playing "intellectual possum"
by de-emphasizing their intellec
tual ability and study habits. Ken
nedy said the "central purposes
of this University all pertain to
the human intellect: its improve
ment, its expansion and its appli
cation."
Throughout the speech, Ken
nedy touched on some topics he
usually covers during his welcome
address. Some of these common
themes are class diversity, the im
portance of service to society and
emphasis on thinking for one's
self.
