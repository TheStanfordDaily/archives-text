## Dukakis edges Bush in debate, experts say 
### 
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -
George Bush and Michael Dukakis
clashed over deficits, drugs and the
Pledge of Allegiance in a crackling cam
paign debate last night. Bush said, "I
hope people don't think I'm questioning
his patriotism," but Dukakis retorted
that he was and added, "I resent it."
Bush sought repeatedly in the 90-
minute debate to depict Dukakis as a
liberal Democrat who is "out there out
of the mainstream." Dukakis challenged
the vice president's judgment and ticked
off a string of what he called Reagan
administration failures, with emphasis on
the Iran-Contra affair.
He said it was a "tragedy" for the
president to sell arms to Iran in exchange
for hostages, and said Bush endorsed the
deal.
The vice president replied, "Yes, we
shouldn't trade arms for hostages, but
we have made vast improvements in our
anti-terrorism."
A question about Republican vice pres
idential candidate Dan Quayle brought
another lively exchange. Bush defended
his youthful running mate and said, "he
has my confidence." Dukakis guessed that
"for most people the notion of President
Quayle is a very, very troubling notion."
The combatants argued their case a
little more than six weeks before Election
Day from behind wooden lecterns on a
stage at Wait Chapel on Wake Forest
University's campus. The live audience
numbered a few thousand — but the
television audience was in the millions.
Neither man committed an obvious
gaffe during the 90 minutes. An Associ
ated Press panel of six veteran debate
judges gave Dukakis a narrow edge over
Bush. Three judges thought Dukakis won
and three picked Bush, but the Democrat
got the most points overall. Dukakis got
top marks for presentation and organi
zation, while Bush bested his opponent
in refutation and reasoning.
An ABC News poll of 500 debate
watchers taken immediately after the
debate found that 45 percent rated Du
kakis the winner, 36 percent gave the
edge to Bush and 19 percent said it was
a tie.

Each man used his closing statement
to deliver a two-minute version of his
standard campaign speech.
Republican Bush said the voters want
change but contended, "We are the
change, I am the change." He said the
nation doesn't want to return to the
"malaise" of the Carter administration.
Democrat Dukakis, the son of immi
grants, said he wants to make the Amer
ican dream come true for all citizens.
"The best America is not behind us. The
best America is yet to come," he said.
The most riveting moment of the eve
ning was when Bush was asked about
his frequent campaign criticism of Duka
kis being a "card-carrying member" of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
Bush said the sharp attacks he delivers
almost daily on the campaign trail were
meant to question Dukakis' judgment on
matters like his membership in the liberal
ACLU and his veto of legislation requir
ing teachers in Massachusetts to lead
their students in reciting the pledge.
Bush said, "I hope people don't think
I'm questioning his patriotism."
But Democrat Dukakis, saying he
hoped he wouldn't have to repeat himself,
replied: "Of course the vice president is
questioning my patriotism. I don't think
there's any question about that. And I
resent it. I resent it."
Both men aimed snappy comments at
the other in the debate's opening mo
ments.
Dukakis was asked to specify three pro
grams he would cut to curb the federal
budget, and said he would reduce "certain
weapons systems, which we don't need
and can't afford." He also said he would
try to implement a program of collecting
delinquent taxes that has been successful
in Massachusetts.
With that, he focused on Bush, and
said the Republican wants to spend more
on defense, cut capital gains taxes, spend
more money on other programs yet im
pose no new taxes.
"If he's serious about what he's saying
the only way he can do it is by raiding
the Social Security trust fund," Dukakis
said.

"If he keeps this up, he's going to be
the Joe Isuzu of American politics," he
said.
"Is this the time to unleash our one
liners?" Bush said in response. "That
answer was about as clear as Boston
Harbor," he said in reference to environ
mental problems in Dukakis' home state.
Bush said Dukakis' support for a nu
clear freeze in the 1970s would have
worked to the advantage of the Commu
nist bloc, and the Democrat accused the
Reagan administration of cutting into the
"fiber and the muscle" of conventional
forces.
Bush tried at one point to cut through
Dukakis' persistent criticism on Iran-
Contra and relations with Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega. Re
peating a stock campaign line, he said
he would take all the blame for those
two mistakes if he could get "half the
credit for all the good things that have
happened for world peace" during the
Reagan administration.
The debate rules were designed to
prohibit direct candidate-to-candidate
comment, but there was no shortage of
hostilities.
Bush worked into one answer that Bos
ton city police had endorsed him over
their hometown candidate. Replying to a
Bush comment about being haunted by
the plight of underprivileged children,
Dukakis said, "I must have been living
through a different eight years than the
ones the vice president has been living
through." He said programs had been
"cut and slashed and butchered and they
hurt kids all over this country."
The first question of the debate was
about drugs, and Dukakis took the of
fensive by questioning Bush's leadership
on the problem.
Bush said the reason drug use was
exploding was because of a "deterioration
of values."
Dukakis agreed, but said values must
begin with the nation's leaders. He ac
cused the Reagan administration of
dealing with Panamanian Gen. Noriega,
whom he referred to as a "drug-running
dictator. We've been dealing with him,

he's been dealing drugs to our kids."
Bush swiftly replied that the Reagan
administration moved quickly to indict
Noriega on drug charges as soon as it
had evidence.
After Bush restated his opposition to
abortion in most cases, Dukakis said the
choice of bearing or not bearing a child
should belong to the pregnant woman
and that Bush was "prepared to brand
a woman a criminal for making this
choice."
Bush said, "I haven't sorted out the

penalties" that might be imposed on a
woman who has an abortion or a doctor
who performs one, should abortions be
outlawed again.
The vice president said he favored al
lowing "people to buy into Medicaid," but
Dukakis shot back, "George, that's no
answer. ... It's no answer to those 37
million people, most of them members
of working families who don't have a
dime of health insurance and don't know
how to pay the bills if the kids get sick
at night."

I'm questioning his patriotism."
But Democrat Dukakis, saying he
hoped he wouldn't have to repeat himself,
replied: "Of course the vice president is
questioning my patriotism. I don't think
there's any question about that. And I
resent it. I resent it."
Both men aimed snappy comments at
the other in the debate's opening mo
ments.
Dukakis was asked to specify three pro
grams he would cut to curb the federal
budget, and said he would reduce "certain
weapons systems, which we don't need
and can't afford." He also said he would
try to implement a program of collecting
delinquent taxes that has been successful
in Massachusetts.
With that, he focused on Bush, and
said the Republican wants to spend more
on defense, cut capital gains taxes, spend
more money on other programs yet im
pose no new taxes.
"If he's serious about what he's saying
the only way he can do it is by raiding
the Social Security trust fund," Dukakis
said.

"If he keeps this up, he's going to be
the Joe Isuzu of American politics," he
said.
"Is this the time to unleash our one
liners?" Bush said in response. "That
answer was about as clear as Boston
Harbor," he said in reference to environ
mental problems in Dukakis' home state.
Bush said Dukakis' support for a nu
clear freeze in the 1970s would have
worked to the advantage of the Commu
nist bloc, and the Democrat accused the
Reagan administration of cutting into the
"fiber and the muscle" of conventional
forces.
Bush tried at one point to cut through
Dukakis' persistent criticism on Iran-
Contra and relations with Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega. Re
peating a stock campaign line, he said
he would take all the blame for those
two mistakes if he could get "half the
credit for all the good things that have
happened for world peace" during the
Reagan administration.
The debate rules were designed to
prohibit direct candidate-to-candidate
comment, but there was no shortage of
hostilities.
Bush worked into one answer that Bos
ton city police had endorsed him over
their hometown candidate. Replying to a
Bush comment about being haunted by
the plight of underprivileged children,
Dukakis said, "I must have been living
through a different eight years than the
ones the vice president has been living
through." He said programs had been
"cut and slashed and butchered and they
hurt kids all over this country."
The first question of the debate was
about drugs, and Dukakis took the of
fensive by questioning Bush's leadership
on the problem.
Bush said the reason drug use was
exploding was because of a "deterioration
of values."
Dukakis agreed, but said values must
begin with the nation's leaders. He ac
cused the Reagan administration of
dealing with Panamanian Gen. Noriega,
whom he referred to as a "drug-running
dictator. We've been dealing with him,

he's been dealing drugs to our kids."
Bush swiftly replied that the Reagan
administration moved quickly to indict
Noriega on drug charges as soon as it
had evidence.
After Bush restated his opposition to
abortion in most cases, Dukakis said the
choice of bearing or not bearing a child
should belong to the pregnant woman
and that Bush was "prepared to brand
a woman a criminal for making this
choice."
Bush said, "I haven't sorted out the

penalties" that might be imposed on a
woman who has an abortion or a doctor
who performs one, should abortions be
outlawed again.
The vice president said he favored al
lowing "people to buy into Medicaid," but
Dukakis shot back, "George, that's no
answer. ... It's no answer to those 37
million people, most of them members
of working families who don't have a
dime of health insurance and don't know
how to pay the bills if the kids get sick
at night."

Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis squared
off in a 90-minute debate last night.
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -
George Bush and Michael Dukakis
clashed over deficits, drugs and the
Pledge of Allegiance in a crackling cam
paign debate last night. Bush said, "I
hope people don't think I'm questioning
his patriotism," but Dukakis retorted
that he was and added, "I resent it."
Bush sought repeatedly in the 90-
minute debate to depict Dukakis as a
liberal Democrat who is "out there out
of the mainstream." Dukakis challenged
the vice president's judgment and ticked
off a string of what he called Reagan
administration failures, with emphasis on
the Iran-Contra affair.
He said it was a "tragedy" for the
president to sell arms to Iran in exchange
for hostages, and said Bush endorsed the
deal.
The vice president replied, "Yes, we
shouldn't trade arms for hostages, but
we have made vast improvements in our
anti-terrorism."
A question about Republican vice pres
idential candidate Dan Quayle brought
another lively exchange. Bush defended
his youthful running mate and said, "he
has my confidence." Dukakis guessed that
"for most people the notion of President
Quayle is a very, very troubling notion."
The combatants argued their case a
little more than six weeks before Election
Day from behind wooden lecterns on a
stage at Wait Chapel on Wake Forest
University's campus. The live audience
numbered a few thousand — but the
television audience was in the millions.
Neither man committed an obvious
gaffe during the 90 minutes. An Associ
ated Press panel of six veteran debate
judges gave Dukakis a narrow edge over
Bush. Three judges thought Dukakis won
and three picked Bush, but the Democrat
got the most points overall. Dukakis got
top marks for presentation and organi
zation, while Bush bested his opponent
in refutation and reasoning.
An ABC News poll of 500 debate
watchers taken immediately after the
debate found that 45 percent rated Du
kakis the winner, 36 percent gave the
edge to Bush and 19 percent said it was
a tie.

Each man used his closing statement
to deliver a two-minute version of his
standard campaign speech.
Republican Bush said the voters want
change but contended, "We are the
change, I am the change." He said the
nation doesn't want to return to the
"malaise" of the Carter administration.
Democrat Dukakis, the son of immi
grants, said he wants to make the Amer
ican dream come true for all citizens.
"The best America is not behind us. The
best America is yet to come," he said.
The most riveting moment of the eve
ning was when Bush was asked about
his frequent campaign criticism of Duka
kis being a "card-carrying member" of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
Bush said the sharp attacks he delivers
almost daily on the campaign trail were
meant to question Dukakis' judgment on
matters like his membership in the liberal
ACLU and his veto of legislation requir
ing teachers in Massachusetts to lead
their students in reciting the pledge.
Bush said, "I hope people don't think
I'm questioning his patriotism."
But Democrat Dukakis, saying he
hoped he wouldn't have to repeat himself,
replied: "Of course the vice president is
