# Pope beatifies Father Serra
## Mission founder one step closer to sainthood 
### 
VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope John
Paul II yesterday beatified a Spanish
priest revered as the founder of Califor
nia's missions but reviled by some who
say he whipped and enslaved the Indians
he worked to convert.
The Rev. Junipero Serra moved a step
toward sainthood when he was made a
"blessed'' of the Roman Catholic Church
along with five other people, including
a Mexican priest executed by a firing
squad.
Speaking in English, the pope called
Serra, an 18th century Franciscan monk,
"a shining example of Christian virtue
and the missionary spirit."
"His great goal was to bring the
Gospel to the native peoples of America,
so that they too might be 'consecrated
in the truth,' John Paul told a crowd
of 20,000 people.
"He sowed the seeds of Christian faith
amid the momentous changes wrought
by the arrival of European settlers in
the New World. It was a field of mis
sionary endeavor that required patience,
perseverance and humility, as well as
vision and courage," the pontiff said.
Serra founded the first nine missions

in what is now California, and his order
eventually established 21. During his
U.S. visit a year ago, John Paul stood
before Serra's grave at the Carmel Mis
sion Basilica and praised the monk for
his missionary work among the Indians.
Critics say Serra stole the Indians'
lands, refused to allow them to leave
the missions, forced them to work in
the fields or on construction projects
and exposed them to European diseases
to which they had no resistance.
A group of nine historians, asked by
Bishop Thaddeus Shubsda of Monterey,
Calif, to give their opinions on Serra,
said in a report last year that there was
no evidence to support the charges.
They concluded Serra was being
blamed for a few incidences of abuse,
most of which occurred years after his
death in 1784.
Rev. Miguel Agustin Pro, a Jesuit
priest executed by Mexican police in
1927, was the only martyr to be beatified
yesterday. He died at the height of the
conflict between the Roman Catholic
Church and the anti-clerical party that
started the Mexican revolution and still
governs the country.
