# Marchers protest World Bank-IMF talks
## Nearly 80,000 in Berlin blast monetary policy toward the Third World 
### 
BERLIN (AP) - Up to 80,000 dem
onstrators, escorted by an army of riot
police, jammed downtown streets yes
terday in a massive march to protest
international financial policy toward the
Third World.
The marchers stopped within shout
ing distance of West Berlin's Interna
tional Congress Center, where World
Bank and International Monetary Fund
talks were being held, and staged a giant
protest.
Organizers said about 80,000 people
participated in the demonstrations, but
police put the number at 27,000.
Police said militants hit three photog
raphers taking pictures during the two
plus mile march, but spokesmen for the
demonstration said they believed un
dercover police officers were the as
sailants. The photographers were not
hurt, police said.
Some people hurled stones at passing
cars and threw paint-filled balloons at
banks, the spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
A police spokesman said "a number
of people were detained" in
demonstration-related disturbances,
but he had no precise number or other
details.
Masked radicals and German leftists

joined activists from Asia and Latin
America and church group members.
They carried banners and chanted
slogans denouncing the policies of in
dustrial nations toward debt-ridden
poor nations.
"We have broken through the national
and political barriers," said march or
ganizer Dieter Bricke, a leading member
of West Germany's leftist Greens party.
"There are members of the Catholic
Church who are here marching with
communists. That is quite an achieve
ment."
Walking about 30 abreast, the mar
chers chanted slogans denouncing what
they called the "murderous polices" of
the World Bank and International Mon
etary Fund.
The 151-nation IMF has spearheaded
a program of financial aid to developing
nations with enormous debts. The
World Bank, its sister organization, of
fers these countries aid for economic
development programs.
But critics say conditions attached to
the assistance are crippling Third World
countries and creating poverty.
Marchers carried banners reading
"The Profits of IMF Are The Misery
of the Third World," "Stop Starvation,"
and "Imperialism, Your Days Are Num

bered." Another banner showed a
banker taking dollar bills from the ribs
of a starving peasant.
Members of the Greens party, includ
ing Jutta Ditfurth, a member of the
West German Parliament, led protesters
representing 120 groups.
Protesters chanted "IMF-Murder
Fund!" and "IMF and World Bank Must
Go!"
The march began on Kurfuersten
damm, West Berlin's main boulevard,
and ended at a square about 1,000 feet
from the International Congress Center.
Armored cars and a mobile water can
nons were parked near the square and
ringed the congress building.
A convoy of 15 vans filled with police
officers led the protesters. Two columns
of riot police wearing helmets and car
rying shields and truncheons flanked a
group of about 1,000 leftist extremists,
many of whom wore ski masks to hide
their identities.
About 10,000 police have guarded the
city during the meetings, expected to
draw 12,000 financial officials, bankers
and journalists. The discussions began
Thursday and will last until Sept. 29.
About 2,700 police officers were
brought in from across West Germany
to strengthen the city's security ranks.
