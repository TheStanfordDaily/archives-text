PLAINS, Ga. (AP) - Billy
Carter, the former "first brother"
and beer-drinking good ol' boy
whose candor and business ven
tures amused and sometimes em
barrassed the Carter administra
tion, died yesterday of cancer. He
was 51.
The brother of former President
Jimmy Carter suffered for a year
with pancreatic cancer — the dis
ease that killed his father and a
sister — and lived longer than his
doctors expected. He died three
days after leaving the hospital for
his home in this southwest Geor
gia hamlet.
Carter "died quietly and peace
fully in his sleep . . . with his fam
ily at his bedside," according to
a statement issued by the Carter
Presidential Center on behalf of
the former president and his fam
ily
"He had struggled courageously
with his illness, never losing his
sense of humor and always more
concerned about those who loved
him than about himself," the fam
ily said.
Billy Carter, who once defined
himself as a beer-drinking good
ol' boy, was forced into the spot
light when his older brother rock
eted from their tiny hometown
into the White House.
He put his name on a brand of
beer that flopped, got into hot
water with remarks denounced as
racist or anti-Semitic, accepted
money from Libya and was forced
to sell some properties to pay a

debt to the Internal Revenue Serv
ice.
But underneath the mask of the
court jester was a perceptive man,
an avid reader, a fighter who
refused to go down quietly under
the pressures of alcoholism or can
cer.
Last April, Carter acknowl
edged he enjoyed being a part of
the national scene during his
brother's presidency from 1977 to
1981.
"I've been asked, a thousand
times, I guess, what I would do
if I had it to do over again," he
added. "And I said, 'Probably the
same thing,' because if I had to
do it over again I'd probably screw
up worse the second go-round."
He was born William Alton
Carter 111, the youngest of four
children. He was a child with a
stutter who did badly in school
while his siblings shone.
Carter later drove a truck for
the family warehouse, then spent
two years at Emory University in
Atlanta before he was forced out
because of poor grades and for
turning in a term paper written
by someone else.
He returned to Plains in 1964,
where he gradually assumed con
trol of the peanut business, which
grew into a $5 million a year op
eration under his stewardship.
The business was placed in trust
while his brother was president.
"It changed my lifestyle com
pletely," he said later. "I was 40

years old and went from one ex
treme to the other just over
night."
During his brother's pres
idency, he made no effort to
smooth out his image. He cul
tivated a redneck personality and
was known for a quick and often
profane wit.
At a Canadian bellyflop cham
pionship, he jumped into the pool
with a beer in his hand and a
rose between his teeth. He judged
a pizza distributor's beauty con
test. He put his signature on the
label of " Billy" beer, but later
joked that one reasons he gave up
drinking was that the beer was
so bad.
