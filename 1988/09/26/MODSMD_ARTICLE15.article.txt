Security forces kill 12 in Burma
RANGOON, Burma (AP) — Security forces
shot and killed 12 people yesterday, government
radio said. Lawlessness persisted a week after
Gen. Saw Maung seized power and moved to
crush dissent.
Radio Rangoon said five people were wounded
and 16 arrested in five lootings in Rangoon and
that two mobs violated the 8 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew
imposed by the new military regime. The looters
were after rice, gasoline and corrugated iron
sheets, it said.
The bloodiest incident occurred when security
forces shot seven people to death while halting
a crowd of 100 looters last night at the state
owned Five Star Shipping Line near Rangoon
River, the radio said.
It said two others were killed when security
forces dispersed a mob of 1,000 people looting a
government rice warehouse, and three died while
looting of another government warehouse.
The government says security forces have killed
more than 250 civilians, mostly people described
as looters, since the Sept. 18 coup. Western
diplomats believe more have died, including many
unarmed demonstrators who marched to demand
democracy after 26 years of authoritarian rule.
Hirohito's health fails to improve
TOKYO (AP) — Thousands of Japanese waited
in the rain outside the Imperial Palace yesterday
to pray for Emperor Hirohito, but the health of
the world's oldest monarch remained precarious.
Imperial officials said the 87-year-old emperor
continued to hemorrhage and his condition re
mained serious, although his temperature

declined yesterday from the dangerous level of
Saturday.
"It appears that his internal bleeding is con
tinuing," Imperial Household Agency spokesman
Kenji Maeda told reporters Sunday. He said the
emperor's temperature was at 98.3, compared to
his normal body temperature of about 95.9.
For the first time since the crisis began, palace
officials acknowledged Hirohito's condition was
serious.
Kyodo News Service and the Asahi Shimbun,
Japan's second-largest newspaper, reported the
emperor is suffering from cancer of the upper
intestine, in the area where the duodenum and
pancreas meet. Asahi said the cancer may have
spread to the pancreas.
Approval sought for abortion drug
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey company
is considering seeking U.S. Food and Drug Ad
ministration permission to begin testing a
French-made drug that induces abortions early
in pregnancy, a scientist said.
Gynopharma Inc. of Somerville had been await
ing the results of French government tests before
applying for permission to market the drug in
the United States, Dr. Gary Hogden, an expert
in reproductive medicine, told The New York
Times.
The French government on Friday authorized
use of RU 486, or mifepristone, an anti-hormone
chemical that interrupts pregnancy by blocking
the implantation of a fertilized egg on the uterine
wall. It must be administered by the 49th day
following the last menstrual period.
He said FDA approval would mean the drug
could be manufactured in the United States under
a licencing agreement between the two companies.
