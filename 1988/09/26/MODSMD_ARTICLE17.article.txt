# Editorial
## Editor's welcome 
### 
Community support is
critical to the future
success of The Daily

WELCOME BACK.
Along with the start of
the new academic year
comes the beginning of Volume 194
of The Stanford Daily. Just like
anything else new, the Daily
editors will alter and modify the
paper in the hopes of bringing the
Stanford community the best prod
uct possible.
The quality of the content is the
editors' greatest concern. Appreci
ate but don't be fooled by any new
artistic or stylistic changes the
editors may attempt over the
course of the next months. And be
impressed when the paper arrives
before breakfast, but don't settle
for an earlier paper of a lesser
quality. Let The Daily know.
To make this newspaper the best
one possible the entire community
should take an interest in The Dai
ly. It may be difficult to find time
but when the paper hits the streets
everyone will benefit. Of course,
The Daily's main goal is to find
the news as well as to react to it.
But there is no way the editors
can give the community what it
deserves if the students, faculty
and administration remain silent
bystanders throughout the course
of the volume.
Many times criticisms and com
pliments concerning the paper are
voiced at mealtime, in class or in
various meetings — yet never
reach The Daily. Instead, write a
letter, make a telephone call, tell
us your thoughts both positive and
negative. The editors need to know
what they're doing right as well
as wrong.
Criticisms that do reach The
Daily often concern the quality of
the writing. "I could do it better

myself!" is often bellowed. Yet, that
challenge is rarely followed by ac
tion. How can The Daily improve
if the campus's best and most in
formed writers are not offering any
of their talent?
Anyone can participate in The
Daily, and no previous experience
is necessary. If you think you can
make a difference, do so. If you
have a science/technical back
ground and want to give reporting
a chance, do so. The difference will
be noticed and appreciated. Orien
tation meetings will be held both
this week and next week. Daily
editors are here day and night,
noon to midnight, and welcome
your stopping by at any free mo
ment.
Also, make sure the Daily editors
know about an important event,
graduate and undergraduate, in
any department, organization, lab
or dorm. The Daily should offer
its readers a balanced and accurate
representation of the diverse and
changing Stanford community.
And the Daily staff should better
represent the community it serves.
New multi-cultural editors will
play an active role in informing
and recruiting staff members. In
addition, Daily editors should be
coming to your house or dorm soon
to answer any questions about the
newspaper.
Finally, tell the Daily editors
about anyone the rest of the com
munity should know and respect.
Unfortunately, the achievements
and accomplishments of many
talented individuals go unnoticed
here. Everyone has a story to tell;
share it with The Daily.
Good luck and stay in touch.
