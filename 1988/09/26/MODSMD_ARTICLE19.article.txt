## Reasonable response to radon threat 
### 
EARLIER THIS MONTH in Wash
ington, the federal government
issued a national public health ad
visory urging that most homes be tested
for radon, the naturally occurring radio
active gas. The Assistant Surgeon Gen
eral, Dr. Vernon Houk, called radon
induced lung cancer one of today's most
serious public health issues.
For a day or so, the presidential cam
paign was nudged from the top spot on
the news, while stock prices of companies
marketing radon test kits skyrocketed on
Wall Street. Later in the week, California
State Health Director Kenneth Kizer
played down the threat and termed the
federal recommendation premature and
a "profound waste of money."
With such confusion running rampant,
what is the appropriate response here in
the Bay Area? There is no question that
exposure to high levels of radon in dusty
underground mines causes lung cancer
rates to rise. Lung disease was noted to
be high in such a situation 500 years ago
by Agricola, a physician who treated
pitchblende miners in central Europe. (We
know of this thanks to a turn-of-the
century translation of the Latin mono
graph by two Stanford engineering grad
uates, Lou Henry and Herbert Hoover.)

Studies of contemporary miners has
allowed the risk to be quantified and
extrapolated to lower levels. Houk esti
mated that of the nearly 140,000 Amer
icans who die of lung cancer each year,
about 5,000 were non-smokers and
15,000 were smokers whose cancers could
be attributed to radon. The synergism
between smoking and radon led the New
York Times to editorialize: "Fight Radon,
Stop Smoking."
Radon in the home is the focus of
attention because the ventilation rates
are lower there than in the workplace,
and because so much of one's life is spent
at home. Energy conservation has in
many cases increased the problem by re
ducing the exchange rates between in
doors and outdoors. The ambient outdoor
air over continents averages about 0.2
picocuries of radon per liter. (A picocurie
is a unit quantity of radon that in ra
dioactive equilibrium contains one tril
lionth of a gram of radium.)
The Environmental Protection Agency
considers chronic exposure to greater
than 4 pCi/1 as the threshold for concern.
Regions with higher levels of uranium
in the soil (the source of radon) are where
the problem homes have been discovered.
Fortunately, California is not such an

area.
In Northern California, the typical in
door radon level appears to be about 0.5
pCi/1, according to limited surveys. At
Stanford, during the next four months,
a half dozen different types of residential
and office structures will be tested to
determine the long-term average radon
concentrations. (The recently announced
EPA results were criticized for being non
representative tests, accumulating data
over just two or three days.)
Should the levels approach or exceed
the 4 piC/1 level, more detailed measure
ments will be undertaken and consider
ation will be given to remedial measures.
Fortunately, the "fixes" are relatively
low in cost. Although the timetable may
appear leisurely, keep in mind that ac
curate assessment requires that data be
collected during a variety of weather and
heating conditions. Furthermore, the risk
factor is related to cumulative exposure,
stretching over decades of one's life, so
a temporary elevation is not notably
hazardous so long as the level is less
than 200 piC/1, beyond which requires
immediate action according to the EPA.

Health Physics department at Stanford.
