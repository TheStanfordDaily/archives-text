# Union will file charges
## USW to accuse University of unfair labor practices 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
will file a charge of unfair labor
practice against the University
today, the USW's chief negotiator
revealed yesterday after the most
recent negotiating session since
the labor contract expired Aug. 31.
By failing to provide current
statistics about workers' dental
plans, the University has compli
cated the union's ability to present
a wage proposal necessary for ef
fective bargaining, according to
Mary Mocine, chief negotiator for
the USW.
"The University has an obliga
tion to file the information we
need in order to do our job,"
Mocine said.
In reference to the dental files,

University lawyer Michael Var
tain said Stanford had responded
according to the law and provided
adequate information. He called
the issue of the dental plan a
"total red herring" to the contract
proposal.
Officially known as Local 680
of the Service Employees Inter
national Union, the USW repre
sents 1,300 technical, mainte
nance and service workers from
campus, the Stanford Medical
Center and the Stanford Linear
Accelerator.
At the 16th negotiating session
held yesterday, the two sides ex
changed labor contract proposals.
Stanford union employees have
agreed to continue working under
the previous contract which ex
pired Aug. 31.
However, the USW could at any

time call a strike. In a union mem
bership meeting, held on the con
tract expiration date, over 350 un
ion employees authorized union
leadership to call a strike in a
vote which won by a margin of
86 percent.
After the USW submitted their
proposal yesterday, the University
caucused for almost two hours
and then presented a coun
terproposal. According to Vartain,
the USW appreciated Stanford's
lastest proposal.
But, in a phone conversation
after the meeting, Mocine called
the University's proposal "a slap
in the face of the workers and
the union."
"It's like telling the union to
stick it," she said, arguing that
Stanford has not made significant
compromises concerning the
policy of contracting out work to
non-union members.
Currently, the University can
contract out work with other busi
nesses, such as food services and
joint research projects. Union
workers have said they want Stan
ford to avoid contracting out work
to organizations. "They proposed
to increase their ability to contract
out to the point where the
workers have virtually no protec
tion," Mocine explained.
Vartain argued that in the case
of emergencies and some everyday
tasks such as photocopying, it is
impractical to obtain the USW's
approval for non-union contracts.
Another hotly debated issue is
a wage-increase plan. On Sept. 9,
the University proposed a 3 per
cent wage increase each year for
the next three years with a cost
of living adjustment for the third
year.
The union submitted its coun
terproposal yesterday proposing
an 8 percent wage increase, down
from their initial proposal of 10
percent. However, this was only
a one-year proposal.

Vartain said he was disap
pointed because the proposal did
not include all three years of the
contract. J
"The bottom line is pretty
clear," Vartain said. "We are not

looking for significant changes in
the contract."
Students and Negotiations
At the first negotiation meet
ing, July 26, the union requested
that representatives of various
campus organizations, including
the Black Student Union, Stan
ford's Chicano/Latino student or
ganization, MEChA, the Asian
American Student Association,
the ASSU Senate and the ASSU
Council of Presidents be present

in negotiations as neutral observ
ers.
But University lawyer Michael
Vartain refused to allow neutral
observers because, he said, open
negotiations would have a "ridic
ulous circus atmosphere" and
would hinder good-faith bargain
ing.
Subsequently, the union placed
particularly concerned students
on their bargaining team to rep
resent student interests and pro
vide input.
The parties reached a stalemate
Aug. 16 when Stanford's team
refused to continue bargaining
while students were present. The
union insited that they had a right
placing students on their bargain
ing team while the University
viewed the students as neutral ob
servers who had no role there.
Both sides immediately filed
unfair labor practice charges with
the National Labor Relations
Board and halted negotiations.
The two parties then agreed to
return to the table Sept. 1 before
any legal resolution was reached
by the NLRB.
Currently, five students are
members of the USW team, in
addition to six bargaining unit
employees, three neutral worker
observers and the USW Chief Ne
gotiator Mary Mocine.
