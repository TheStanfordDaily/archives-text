## USW to accuse University of unfair labor practices 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
will file a charge of unfair labor
practice against the University
today, the USW's chief negotiator
revealed yesterday after the most
recent negotiating session since
the labor contract expired Aug. 31.
By failing to provide current
statistics about workers' dental
plans, the University has compli

ion employees authorized union
leadership to call a strike in a
vote which won by a margin of
86 percent.
After the USW submitted their
proposal yesterday, the University
caucused for almost two hours
and then presented a coun

the USW appreciated Stanford's
lastest proposal.
But, in a phone conversation
after the meeting, Mocine called
the University's proposal "a slap
in the face of the workers and
the union."
"It's like telling the union to
stick it," she said, arguing that
