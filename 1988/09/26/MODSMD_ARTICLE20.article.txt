## An active Council of Presidents welcomes students 
### 
LAST SPRING, there were two
choices in the Council of Presi
dents race. One slate offered a
traditional approach to the ASSU,
saying they would focus on the admin
istrative responsibilities of the COP.
Our slate, "A New Slate of Mind,"
offered an approach of transforming
the ASSU into a government that
actively involved students and met
their educational needs. We came out
of the movement for educational rights
led by students of color and saw our
campaign in the context of a nation
wide student effort to make education
a right for all people.
Students of color have long fought
for fundamental changes in our educa
tional system. These changes are baseu
on the premise that "the best educa
tion" is one that teaches students
about reality in our society, a reality
that includes problems such as injus
tice and poverty and racism, and gives
us the tools that we need to learn how
to change our society. On this campus,
students challenged the entire notion of
what constituted "the best education"
and demanded a change in the West
ern Culture requirement. Thanks to
these efforts, beginning in 1989 stu
dents will now learn about all of the
"Cultures, Ideas and Values" that
have shaped this society, not only
those of elite Western European men.
ourslale came out of this move
ment, out of this philosophy. Put to
gether by "the People's Platform," a
coalition of students of color organiza
tions and progressive white students,
we formed our platform with this
movement in our minds. We promised
to work for institutional changes that
would make the Stanford education
one that recognized the contributions
of all peoples, one that valued profes
sors that emphasized teaching students
rather than publishing research, one
that prioritized increased admissions of
students of color and economically
disadvantaged students, one that gave
enough financial aid to guarantee a
student the ability to stay in school,
one that taught values of justice by
refusing to invest in South Africa and
supporting the grape boycott . . .
Along with institutional changes, we

And we also feel that
most students here be
lieve that all members
of the Stanford commu
nity should be treated
with respect and
dignity.

pledged to create new ASSU services
which would identify student problems
and work to solve them. And we
pledged to involve students actively in
the student government so that we can
become a truly representative body No
more will the ASSU only involve
elected officials and paid staff, we
promised, we wanted a student govern
ment that sought out the opinions and
facilitated the initiative of the student
body. We knew that only through
student involvement could we meet our
goals.
Ironically, we won our race in the
same election that saw the near loss of
the Black Student Union's fee assess
ment. It occurred after a year during
which ugly incidents convinced many of
us that racism and ignorance at Stan
ford were thriving. We see reversing
this trend as central to achieving our
goals as the Council of Presidents. The
Black Student Union, Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl&n, Asian
American Student Association and
Stanford American Indian Organization
are responsible for the creation of this
slate and all of our efforts must be
seen in this context.
So where are we at with these prom
ises? Did we discover, as all student
government members eventually do,
that our goals were unrealistic? Did we
have to just concentrate on one or two
projects and spend the rest of our time
going to meetings with administration
officials and university committees?

No. We spent the summer organizing
to prepare for students to return to
school. First of all, we sought to define
how we could educate the students
about the role that the ethnic student
organizations play on campus. We
brought together a coalition to plan
"The Fire Within," a Freshman Orien
tation program, which will feature
cultural performances by students of
color; this will take place tonight at
9:00 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. We
encourage all students to attend.
We felt it was important that all
students participate in the democratic
process, so we are running a voter
registration project in order to register
as many students as possible. We also
seek to empower other members of the
Stanford community and neighboring
cities, so we will be launching efforts
to register the Stanford workers and
residents of East Palo Alto.
Because so many students are dis
satisfied with their financial aid
packages, we established the "ASSU
Financial Aid Advocates," who give
students advice from experience on how
they can make the most of their visit
to the Financial Aids Office and deal
with a financial aid offer that forces
them to work too many hours, take
out too many loans, or even stop out
of school.
And since most students ask other
students for advice on professors and
courses, we decided to institutionalize
this process through "ASSU Course
Consultants," who will be in White
Plaza from 11:15 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.
every day this next week. They'll tell
you what professors and courses you
should be sure to take this quarter and
which ones to avoid.
We also decided to do something
about the Stanford Bookstore and their
high prices on school supplies. We
believe that they utilize their monopoly
to overcharge students on everything.
So we are selling inexpensive telep
hones and school supplies in White
Plaza this week to save students lots
of money.
And we also feel that most students
here believe that all members of the
Stanford community should be treated
with respect and dignity. University

We seek to make stu
dent government into a
force for educational
democracy and justice
on this campus, and
hope you will join with
us to help.

President Donald Kennedy spoke of
"the Stanford family" in his welcome
to this year's freshman class, and we
believe this conception of our family
must be expanded to include the Stan
ford workers. Currently they are in a
very difficult time; they are in the
middle of negotiating a contract.
Facing proposals that would eliminate
job security and union representation
and encountering intransigence and
intolerance at their efforts to improve
child care and affirmative action for
the workers, they deserve and they
need student help. So we are par
ticipating in a coalition effort to show
that Stanford students believe in jus
tice for the workers on campus.
Our slate's roots lie in the student
movement. We see our predecessors not
as the bureaucratic ASSU members of
years past, but rather find our legacy
with the black students who took over
the microphone from the president
after Martin Luther King's assassina
tion and demanded more black admis
sions and an end to the racist treat
ment of black students. We seek to
make student government into a force
for educational democracy and justice
on this campus, and hope you will join
with us to help. Become an active
participant in your Stanford education!

packages, we established the "ASSU
Financial Aid Advocates," who give
students advice from experience on how
they can make the most of their visit
to the Financial Aids Office and deal
with a financial aid offer that forces
them to work too many hours, take
out too many loans, or even stop out
of school.
And since most students ask other
students for advice on professors and
courses, we decided to institutionalize
this process through "ASSU Course
Consultants," who will be in White
Plaza from 11:15 a.m. to 1:15 p.m.
every day this next week. They'll tell
you what professors and courses you
should be sure to take this quarter and
which ones to avoid.
We also decided to do something
about the Stanford Bookstore and their
high prices on school supplies. We
believe that they utilize their monopoly
to overcharge students on everything.
So we are selling inexpensive telep
hones and school supplies in White
Plaza this week to save students lots
of money.
And we also feel that most students
here believe that all members of the
Stanford community should be treated
with respect and dignity. University

We seek to make stu
dent government into a
force for educational
democracy and justice
on this campus, and
hope you will join with
us to help.

President Donald Kennedy spoke of
"the Stanford family" in his welcome
to this year's freshman class, and we
believe this conception of our family
must be expanded to include the Stan
ford workers. Currently they are in a
very difficult time; they are in the
middle of negotiating a contract.
Facing proposals that would eliminate
job security and union representation
and encountering intransigence and
intolerance at their efforts to improve
child care and affirmative action for
the workers, they deserve and they
need student help. So we are par
ticipating in a coalition effort to show
that Stanford students believe in jus
tice for the workers on campus.
Our slate's roots lie in the student
movement. We see our predecessors not
as the bureaucratic ASSU members of
years past, but rather find our legacy
with the black students who took over
the microphone from the president
after Martin Luther King's assassina
tion and demanded more black admis
sions and an end to the racist treat
ment of black students. We seek to
make student government into a force
for educational democracy and justice
on this campus, and hope you will join
with us to help. Become an active
participant in your Stanford education!

Council of Presidents
LAST SPRING, there were two
choices in the Council of Presi
dents race. One slate offered a
traditional approach to the ASSU,
saying they would focus on the admin
istrative responsibilities of the COP.
Our slate, "A New Slate of Mind,"
offered an approach of transforming
the ASSU into a government that
actively involved students and met
their educational needs. We came out
of the movement for educational rights
led by students of color and saw our
campaign in the context of a nation
wide student effort to make education
a right for all people.
Students of color have long fought
for fundamental changes in our educa
tional system. These changes are baseu
on the premise that "the best educa
tion" is one that teaches students
about reality in our society, a reality
that includes problems such as injus
tice and poverty and racism, and gives
us the tools that we need to learn how
to change our society. On this campus,
students challenged the entire notion of
what constituted "the best education"
and demanded a change in the West
ern Culture requirement. Thanks to
these efforts, beginning in 1989 stu
dents will now learn about all of the
"Cultures, Ideas and Values" that
have shaped this society, not only
those of elite Western European men.
ourslale came out of this move
ment, out of this philosophy. Put to
gether by "the People's Platform," a
coalition of students of color organiza
tions and progressive white students,
we formed our platform with this
movement in our minds. We promised
to work for institutional changes that
would make the Stanford education
one that recognized the contributions
of all peoples, one that valued profes
sors that emphasized teaching students
rather than publishing research, one
that prioritized increased admissions of
students of color and economically
disadvantaged students, one that gave
enough financial aid to guarantee a
student the ability to stay in school,
one that taught values of justice by
refusing to invest in South Africa and
supporting the grape boycott . . .
Along with institutional changes, we

And we also feel that
most students here be
lieve that all members
of the Stanford commu
nity should be treated
with respect and
dignity.

pledged to create new ASSU services
which would identify student problems
and work to solve them. And we
pledged to involve students actively in
the student government so that we can
become a truly representative body No
more will the ASSU only involve
elected officials and paid staff, we
promised, we wanted a student govern
ment that sought out the opinions and
facilitated the initiative of the student
body. We knew that only through
student involvement could we meet our
goals.
Ironically, we won our race in the
same election that saw the near loss of
the Black Student Union's fee assess
ment. It occurred after a year during
which ugly incidents convinced many of
us that racism and ignorance at Stan
ford were thriving. We see reversing
this trend as central to achieving our
goals as the Council of Presidents. The
Black Student Union, Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl&n, Asian
American Student Association and
Stanford American Indian Organization
are responsible for the creation of this
slate and all of our efforts must be
seen in this context.
So where are we at with these prom
ises? Did we discover, as all student
government members eventually do,
that our goals were unrealistic? Did we
have to just concentrate on one or two
projects and spend the rest of our time
going to meetings with administration
officials and university committees?

No. We spent the summer organizing
to prepare for students to return to
school. First of all, we sought to define
how we could educate the students
about the role that the ethnic student
organizations play on campus. We
brought together a coalition to plan
"The Fire Within," a Freshman Orien
tation program, which will feature
cultural performances by students of
color; this will take place tonight at
9:00 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. We
encourage all students to attend.
We felt it was important that all
students participate in the democratic
process, so we are running a voter
registration project in order to register
as many students as possible. We also
seek to empower other members of the
Stanford community and neighboring
cities, so we will be launching efforts
to register the Stanford workers and
residents of East Palo Alto.

satisfied with their financial aid
packages, we established the "ASSU
