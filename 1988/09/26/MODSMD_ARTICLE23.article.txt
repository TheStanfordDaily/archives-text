## Behind the roses—Mayfield's mystery house explored 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
As the serenity of Mayfield Avenue is
transformed into a mad rush to class,
hundreds of Stanford students stream
past the white, two-story Dunn-Bacon
House at 565 Mayfield Ave. Streaking by
on bicycles, some people may have noticed
the dozens of well-trimmed rose bushes
and a semi-circular driveway that cuts
through a large front lawn.
On other occasions, huffing and puffing
to make a morning class, students may
have noticed the stars and stripes waving
from atop a flagpole standing to the left
of the house. Or, while cruising down
Mayfield, some may have gazed at the
four ionic columns, green shutters and
curtained windows that are the facade
of this turn-of-the-century home.
Life in the Dunn-Bacon House has al
ways been paced differently from the
world that shoots by outside. Everything
seems a little calmer as the thick wooden
walls temper the noise of traffic and
shouting on Mayfield. The bustle outside
is replaced by the melodic ticking of five
century-old pendulum clocks.
The home's current owners and resi

dents, Harold and Rosamond Bacon, said
with a grin that their cozy, densely
furnished home is an example of "early
Stanford clutter." Some of Harold
Bacon's vintage black and white photo
graphs of the house show today's fur
nishings have gone unchanged since the
home's 1899 construction.
The walls are still the same shade of
tan; the same plush velvet chairs fill the
living room. Even a number of Persian
rugs covering pine floor boards are the
same ones the original owners laid
decades ago.
Large beveled-glass mirrors, portraits
and landscapes hang from a dark brown
molding that runs along the walls.
A pump organ dating back to 1885 has
been at the entrance for decades while
the grand brick fireplace in the living
room has not been altered since it began
warming the house's original owners, Or
rin and Harriet Dunn.
The Dunns, in contrast to the house's
current owners, had little to do with Stan
ford. One of their only connections to
the university was Harriet Dunn's "ac
quaintance" to Jane Stanford who, along
with former California Governor Leland
Stanford, founded the university in 1891.

Harriet Dunn persuaded Jane Stanford
to lease land for their house. In those
days, the Dunns could look out their front
door and see nothing but fields of grass
since the plot was located at the edge of
campus.
The Bacons were no strangers to the
Dunn family, — Harold Bacon's father,
Robert, was the first cousin of Orrin
Dunn. Bacon's father lived in the house
with the Dunns for some time while he
was an undergraduate. Then the widowed
Harriet Dunn invited Bacon, himself a
Stanford graduate, to live in the house
when he returned to the University in
1930 as a mathematics professor. When
Harriet Dunn died in 1946, the house
and the renewable land lease were willed
to Harold Bacon.
In that same year, Harold and
Rosamond were married. They have lived
in the house for the past 42 years. Their
residence along with the house at Campus
and Alvarado Road are the only two fac
ulty homes in the center of campus.
Harold Bacon said he and his wife have
always maintained friendly relations with
the students who surround them. In fact,
he said he remembered when the Beta
Theta Pi fraternity, their next door
neighbors, "sent dinner over to us one
night" after they were married.
The sprite, octogenarian couple said
the barrages of weekend revelers on
Mayfield do not bother them much.
Bacon added with a smile that he rarely
loses sleep because "our bedroom is at
the back of the house."
They even added that the students are
something of a comfort during the year,
saying they often missed seeing them
during the summer months.
Both remain active in Stanford organ
izations and maintain relationships with
current University faculty. They rarely
open up their home for large gatherings
though, preferring to entertain smaller,
more intimate groups of guests.
The couple said they plan to keep the
residence in the family. And, of course,
they are going to keep busy like they
have for years: maintaining the rose
bushes outside, entertaining family and
friends and remaining active in organi
zations like the Stanford Historical So
ciety. They will continue supplying their
genial, old-world mannerisms that make
stepping into this stately old colonial
home just like stepping back in time.

Both remain active in Stanford organ
izations and maintain relationships with
current University faculty. They rarely
open up their home for large gatherings
though, preferring to entertain smaller,
more intimate groups of guests.
The couple said they plan to keep the
residence in the family. And, of course,
they are going to keep busy like they
have for years: maintaining the rose
bushes outside, entertaining family and
friends and remaining active in organi
zations like the Stanford Historical So
ciety. They will continue supplying their
genial, old-world mannerisms that make
stepping into this stately old colonial
home just like stepping back in time.
