## Oregon stops Stanford in defensive struggle TD with 8:53 remaining drops Cardinal to 1-2 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
EUGENE, Ore. — In a day full of surprises,
perhaps the strangest surprise of all is that the
Oregon football team proved it deserves a spot in
the national top 20.
After beating Stanford 7-3 Saturday in Autzen
Stadium, the Ducks ran their record to 3-0, 2-0 in
the Pacific 10 Conference, and are in a strong
position to earn their first post-season berth since
1963.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, fell to 1-2, 0-2
in the Pac-10. Despite a superb effort by Stanford's
defensive unit, the Cardinal lost its second heart
breaker in two Pac-10 games.
"You compliment Oregon in terms of defense,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said. "I knew we were
going to need some big plays on offense, and if you
don't get the big plays to offset the interceptions
and fumbles, you're going to have a tough day. It
was a winning defensive effort today (by Stan
ford). . .. It's a tough loss."
Most people expected a high-scoring affair, espe
cially after the Ducks notched 49 and 43 points in
their first two games, but both defenses were very
successful in containing the opposing offense. Stan
ford was held to only 277 yards of total offense,
and a scant 36 on the ground, but even more sur
prising was the dominance of the Cardinal defense.
Oregon had rolled up 973 yards in wins over
Long Beach State and Washington State, but could
not sustain a drive against the Cardinal, finishing
with only 287 yards. "Apparently we played a damn
good defensive football game," inside linebacker
Jono Tunney said. "[But] we could have played
seven points better."
The game marked the first time the Cardinal had
held a foe to seven or fewer points and still lost
since 1966. The opponent in 1966: Oregon; the site:
Eugene; the score: 7-3.
Just as in the Cardinal's opener, a 24-20 loss to
USC, Stanford got on the scoreboard first. Junior
Jon Volpe ran for 10 yards on the game's first play
from scrimmage but a third-down sack of quarter
back Brian Johnson by outside linebacker Scott
Kozak ended the drive and proved a sign of things

to come. After two exchanges of punts, the Cardinal
began to move the ball, but again came up short.
After moving 53 yards to the Duck 34, Johnson
looked for sophomore Walter Batson on third-and
-10. Batson was past the coverage, open on the
two-yard line, but he couldn't hold on to the pass
from Johnson.
"I went by him [the cornerbackl," Batson said.
"The cornerback was beat. As the ball came closer
to me the free safety closed well on it and the
cornerback closed well on it. It went over the free
safety's outstretched arms. The corner tipped it but
he barely affected the path of the ball. . . . When
he came into view, I took my eyes off the ball for
a split-second. By the time I knew it, it was in my
chest and I just couldn't find the handle."
Cornerback Kevin Scott picked off a Bill Musgrave
pass to set up the Cardinal offense again, but two
sacks by defensive lineman Matt Brock moved Stan
ford out of field-goal range.
Stanford got another chance after the teams ex
changed punts twice, using a 20-yard pass to Batson
to set up a 51-yard field goal attempt. Sophomore
John Hopkins converted with a line-drive through
the uprights for the longest field goal of his Stanford
career (so far), making it 3-0 midway through the
second quarter.
Stanford had one more chance in the first half,
but couldn't convert. On fourth-and-four from the
Cardinal 26 with 50 seconds remaining, Jeff Blais
dell lined up to punt. The ball was snapped instead
to Greg Ennis, the personal protector on the play,
and the back-up quarterback ran the option, pitching
to Blaisdell for a 15-yard run.
Blaisdell was only a step or two away from break
ing it for a touchdown, but he was knocked out of
bounds at the Cardinal 41, and while the offense
then moved the ball into Oregon territory, the half
expired before Stanford reached field-goal range.
The second half was more of the same: teams
driving the ball well between the thirty-yard lines
but no scoring. The biggest challenge Stanford's
defense faced was staying on the field for more
than 37 minutes. "It seemed like all day long," that
the defense was on the field, cornerback Brad Cook
