# Volleyball razes Arizona, ASU
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Although the Stanford women's
volleyball team may have looked
vulnerable after losing its Pacific
10 Conference opener, the Cardi
nal has returned to form with a
three-match winning streak.
The squad fell to top-ranked
UCLA a week ago Friday at
Maples Pavilion, 15-7, 15-3, 15-9
but has rebounded nicely and is
now 8-1, 3-1 in the Pac-10. Stan
ford bounced back the night fol
lowing the loss to the Bruins to
beat the visiting USC Trojans 14-
16, 15-10, 15-5, 15-10.
Stanford continued its winning
ways this past weekend, triumph
ing Thursday at Arizona 15-13,
15-8, 12-15, 4-15, 15-5, and Friday
at Arizona State 15-7, 15-8, 15-11.
"I'm happy," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "I didn't expect
us to necessarily be 8-1 at this
point."
A big reason for that record is
a balanced line-up, a deep bench
and a lot of production from fresh
men. In the win against Arizona,
four players reached double fig
ures in kills, keeping the opponent
from ganging up on one or two
players. In addition, Shaw said
this year's team has better depth
than any he's ever seen at Stan
ford.
Freshman Kristin Klein has
been the top performer so far for

Stanford, leading the Cardinal in
kills in all eight matches she has
started. After switching from high
school middle blocker to college
outside hitter, the freshman has
responded by hitting, digging and
passing consistently well night
after night.
The third-ranked Cardinal had
no chance against the red-hot
Bruins, however. "We just got off
to a really slow start," Klein said.
"We dug ourselves into a hole. . . .
They played really, really, really
well."
Shaw agreed. "We didn't play
very well," he said. "UCLA . . .
never let us have a chance."
Bruin Ail-Americans Daiva
Tomkus and Ann Boyer combined
with sophomore Samantha Shaver
and freshman Elaine Youngs to
spark UCLA to the first Maples
Pavilion shut-out of the Cardinal
since 1981.
"They're peaking right now,"
Klein said of UCLA. "By the time
November comes around (the next
time Stanford plays UCLA), we
will have improved a lot. I think
by then we will be peaking."
Despite the team's youth (one
senior, five freshmen), the squad
rebounded quickly from the loss,
downing the 12th-ranked Trojans
the following night. "We had to
find out if we were capable of
bouncing back," Shaw said. "It
was nice to see we hung together
. . . and beat a really good team."

The Trojans were led by Lonise
Norfleet, who led the Pac-10 in
kills last season as a freshman,
but the Cardinal block slowed
Norfleet in the third and fourth
games while senior Amy Hayes
had perhaps the best match of
her career to lead Stanford to the
win.
"We played together (against
USC)," Klein said. "Everything
just clicked."
Stanford's block went from
being the hero to being the goat
aginst the Wildcats, however.
"Our block wasn't doing its job,"
Klein said. "We weren't blocking
the way we should. I think . . .
that's one of the things we count
on. It was frustrating."
Shaw summed it up by saying
"The block basically got in the
way of the defense."
After splitting the first four
games of the match, Stanford was
able to come back in the fifth,
winning the game easily. Klein led
the squad with 25 kills, senior
Laura Olesen had 13 while fresh
man Amy Cooper and Hayes had
11 each.
"We didn't play real v/ell
against Arizona," Shaw said. "We
were just a step slow. Luckily we
finally got ourselves together
enough to win the fifth game."
Arizona was led by sophomore
outside hitter Terry Lauchner,
who tallied 32 kills and 19 digs.

The following night Stanford
bounced back again, returning to
top form to bury the 18th-ranked
Sun Devils. Christy Nore, ASU's
top player, was held well in check
and Klein and Hayes recorded 14
kills apiece to key the win.
"Our main goal (against ASU)
was to improve our blocking,"
Shaw said. "That's pretty much
what happened. In the third game
we got a little flat, then Karen
Anderson, Tracy (Hughes) and
Cheryl Conly came off the bench
to get us going."
The Cardinal plays 11-0 San
Jose State at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow
in San Jose, and although the Car
dinal has had the Spartans'num
ber of late, Shaw isn't taking the
contest lightly. "They're 11-0. It's
tough to argue with that," he said.
"They always get fired-up for us.
I don't think we can look ahead."
If the team continues to im
prove as quickly as it has in the
past week, a challenge to the Pac
-10 leading Bruins would not be
unreasonable.
In fact, Shaw said, the team's
only goal is improvement. "As
they get more time playing to
gether ... we'll just improve. ...
We're trying to get better at play
ing together. The attitude is great;
the effort is great. We're just
trying to build to the end of the
season and see how far we can go."
And with any luck, that could
be quite far indeed.

kills in all eight matches she has
started. After switching from high
school middle blocker to college
outside hitter, the freshman has
responded by hitting, digging and
passing consistently well night
after night.
The third-ranked Cardinal had
no chance against the red-hot
Bruins, however. "We just got off
to a really slow start," Klein said.
"We dug ourselves into a hole. . . .
They played really, really, really
well."
Shaw agreed. "We didn't play
very well," he said. "UCLA . . .
never let us have a chance."
Bruin Ail-Americans Daiva
Tomkus and Ann Boyer combined
with sophomore Samantha Shaver
and freshman Elaine Youngs to
spark UCLA to the first Maples
Pavilion shut-out of the Cardinal
since 1981.
"They're peaking right now,"
Klein said of UCLA. "By the time
November comes around (the next
time Stanford plays UCLA), we
will have improved a lot. I think
by then we will be peaking."
Despite the team's youth (one
senior, five freshmen), the squad
rebounded quickly from the loss,
downing the 12th-ranked Trojans
the following night. "We had to
find out if we were capable of
bouncing back," Shaw said. "It
was nice to see we hung together
. . . and beat a really good team."

The Trojans were led by Lonise
Norfleet, who led the Pac-10 in
kills last season as a freshman,
but the Cardinal block slowed
Norfleet in the third and fourth
games while senior Amy Hayes
had perhaps the best match of
her career to lead Stanford to the
win.
"We played together (against
USC)," Klein said. "Everything
just clicked."
Stanford's block went from
being the hero to being the goat
aginst the Wildcats, however.
"Our block wasn't doing its job,"
Klein said. "We weren't blocking
the way we should. I think . . .
that's one of the things we count
on. It was frustrating."
Shaw summed it up by saying
"The block basically got in the
way of the defense."
After splitting the first four
games of the match, Stanford was
able to come back in the fifth,
winning the game easily. Klein led
the squad with 25 kills, senior
Laura Olesen had 13 while fresh
man Amy Cooper and Hayes had
11 each.
"We didn't play real v/ell
against Arizona," Shaw said. "We
were just a step slow. Luckily we
finally got ourselves together
enough to win the fifth game."
Arizona was led by sophomore
outside hitter Terry Lauchner,
who tallied 32 kills and 19 digs.

The following night Stanford
bounced back again, returning to
top form to bury the 18th-ranked
Sun Devils. Christy Nore, ASU's
top player, was held well in check
and Klein and Hayes recorded 14
kills apiece to key the win.
"Our main goal (against ASU)
was to improve our blocking,"
Shaw said. "That's pretty much
what happened. In the third game
we got a little flat, then Karen
Anderson, Tracy (Hughes) and
Cheryl Conly came off the bench
to get us going."
The Cardinal plays 11-0 San
Jose State at 7:30 p.m. tomorrow
in San Jose, and although the Car
dinal has had the Spartans'num
ber of late, Shaw isn't taking the
contest lightly. "They're 11-0. It's
tough to argue with that," he said.
"They always get fired-up for us.
I don't think we can look ahead."
If the team continues to im
prove as quickly as it has in the
past week, a challenge to the Pac
-10 leading Bruins would not be
unreasonable.
In fact, Shaw said, the team's
only goal is improvement. "As
they get more time playing to
gether ... we'll just improve. ...
We're trying to get better at play
ing together. The attitude is great;
the effort is great. We're just
trying to build to the end of the
season and see how far we can go."
And with any luck, that could
be quite far indeed.

Freshman sensation Kristin Klein has been the Cardinal's top hitter
this season.
Although the Stanford women's
volleyball team may have looked
vulnerable after losing its Pacific
10 Conference opener, the Cardi
nal has returned to form with a
three-match winning streak.
The squad fell to top-ranked
UCLA a week ago Friday at
Maples Pavilion, 15-7, 15-3, 15-9
but has rebounded nicely and is
now 8-1, 3-1 in the Pac-10. Stan
ford bounced back the night fol
lowing the loss to the Bruins to
beat the visiting USC Trojans 14-
16, 15-10, 15-5, 15-10.
Stanford continued its winning
ways this past weekend, triumph
ing Thursday at Arizona 15-13,
15-8, 12-15, 4-15, 15-5, and Friday
at Arizona State 15-7, 15-8, 15-11.
"I'm happy," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "I didn't expect
us to necessarily be 8-1 at this
point."
A big reason for that record is
a balanced line-up, a deep bench
and a lot of production from fresh
men. In the win against Arizona,
four players reached double fig
ures in kills, keeping the opponent
from ganging up on one or two
players. In addition, Shaw said
this year's team has better depth
than any he's ever seen at Stan
ford.
