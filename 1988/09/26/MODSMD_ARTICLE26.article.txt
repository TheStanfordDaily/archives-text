SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
â€” Carl Lewis battled a grueling
schedule Monday as he got
back in the hunt for victory at
the Seoul Olympics, where U.S.
boxers rolled and swimmer
Matt Biondi rolled in gold.
Lewis, unable to unseat Ben
Johnson as the world's fastest
human in the 100 meters,
renewed his assault in the 200-
meter heats and long jump
final Monday, Lewis ran in the
final 200 heat of the first round
and the first heat of the second
round before the long jump
later in the afternoon.
Lewis ran an easy 20.72 for
second place in his first heat
behind Italian Stefano Tilli's
20.68, and he picked up the
pace a little in the second
round, winning his heat in
20.57.
Although will be un
able to repeat his four-gold per
formance of 1984, he still has

a chance to become the first
Olympian ever to repeat in the
200 or long jump. Lewis also
is a member of the U.S. 400-
meter relay team.
Biondi equaled the most
medals ever won by a swimmer
in a single Olympics when the
U.S. men's 400-meter medley
relay team won in world-record
time Sunday night. He finished
the Games and his racing
career with five straight gold
and four world records after
winning a bronze and silver.
"It's been a tremendously
long week, and I don't think
it's really hit me what I've done
this past week," he said. "When
it does, I don't think I'll be
able to sleep for a couple of
days.
"As far as this changing my
life, I hope it doesn't," the 6-

foot-6 Biondi said. "I'm retiring
as a swimmer after this, but I
want to try to continue swimming
as a member of the U.S. water
polo team." The U.S. boxing
team stretched its winning streak
to 10 bouts before finally losing
a fight Sunday night. So far, the
team still has nine of 12 boxers
in the medals chase, and seven of
them have advanced to the quar
terfinals.
Louganis, already the winner of
the springboard diving event,
finished second in Monday morn
ing's opening qualifying session
in the platform, behind Xiong Ni
of China. With a gold in Tuesday's
final, he would become the first
man to sweep the diving events
in consecutive Olympics.
The U.S. basketball team ad
vanced to the Olympic semfinals
with a 94-54 victory over Puerto
Rico.
East Germans Kathleen Nord
and Birte Weigang finished 1-2 in
the 200-meter butterfly, while
world record-holder Mary T.
Meagher, the "Madame Butterfly"
of swimming, ended her career
with the bronze.
"I certainly didn't want to end
my career this way," the 23-year
old Meagher said. "Perhaps I am
past my prime."
