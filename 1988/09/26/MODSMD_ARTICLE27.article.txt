# Water polo captures tournament title
## 
### Cameron Macky Editorial staff 
The Stanford water polo team took the Air
Force Tournament by storm over the weekend,
going 5-0 and capturing the tournament title
with an impressive offensive attack.
In running its season record to 10-3, the
fourth-ranked Cardinal defeated three other
Top-20 teams — UC-San Diego, Air Force,
and UC-Ivine — by a combined score of 44-16.
Stanford trailed exactly once during the entire
weekend.
The tournament was the second in as many
weeks for a Stanford squad that had traveled
to Irvine the previous weekend. The Cardinal
placed fourth at the Irvine tournament that
saw seven of the nation's top 10 teams com
peting for the title. Even with losses to UCLA
nnd California, the Cardinal gained a bit of
respect with a hard-fought 11-9 victory over
No. 3 USC.
At the Air Force Tournament this weekend,
Stanford's dominance on offense was so com
plete that at least six Cardinal players scored
in every game, and all 13 players who made
the trip to the tournament scored at least once.
"Our depth was probably our biggest ad
vantage," Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
understated. "We were a lot deeper than the
other teams there. I substituted after every
goal, which meant we were able to keep every
one pretty well-rested and fresh."
Even with the offense scoring goals in
bunches, however, Dettamanti was not com
pletely pleased with the team's play in its

early games. Following easy wins over Loyola
(12-7) and Bucknell (14-3), the Cardinal faced
No. 8 UCSD and trailed 4-3 after the first
half. "We must have missed 10 shots in the
first half," Dettamanti said. "We should have
been up by four or five at the half."
Dettamanti felt the Cardinal's first-half
showing against the Tritons (who finished the
tournament as the only team able to hold
Stanford scoreless for an entire quarter) char
acterized the team's play in the first half of
the weekend.
"I think we played down to the level of the
other teams," he said. "We struggled in the
first half of games, but then came back in
the second. We just couldn't put people away
early."
The Cardinal woke up in the second half
to outscore UCSD 6-2 behind junior Jon
SwerdlofTs three goals. Swerdloff finished the
tournament with nine goals, tops on the team.
In the first of two games yesterday, Stanford
annihilated host Air Force 19-2, setting up a
showdown with No. 6 Irvine in the champi
onship game. Sophomore Greg Olson and
freshman Greg Morris each had three goals
as 11 Cardinal players scored against the Fal
cons, who hardly played like the 16th-best
squad in the country, surrendering seven
fourth-quarter goals.
Irvine appeared to be the toughest matchup
of the weekend for the Cardinal, but with
Stanford's offense in high speed, the game
was over almost before it started. After the
16-8 wipeout, Dettamanti saw the game as a
turning point for the squad.

"We just put everything together against
Irvine," Dettamanti said. "It was nice to get
some revenge for last year, when they beat
us at the NCAA Championships. Todd Kemp
just played an excellent game in goal. They
(Irvine) have a lot of great shooters, and Todd
just shut them down."
Of course, great play is expected from Kemp,
a two-time All-America. What wasn't expected
was the Cardinal's continued offensive out
burst, led by Eric Blum's three goals. Five
other players — Olson, Swerdloff, Rick
McNair, Chuck Maguy, and Shane Coons —
added two goals apiece.
Stanford's offense, once cause for concern,
appears to be on the rise. "Our shooting im
proved a lot in just a few days," Dettamanti
said. "At the start of the tournament we
weren't shooting very well, but then we started
to come around in the last couple of games."
"WVve been working on moving the ball
around more, looking for the other guy instead
of just shooting," Dettamanti added. "It's a
more team-oriented offense, setting up the
other players."
The win meant much more than taking the
tournament title, according to Dettamanti.
"This (defeating Irvine) can be a real
confidence-builder," he said. "This is the kind
of team we have to beat to stay up in the
rankings and get back to the NCAA Cham
pionships.
"This team is a team in transition, and
games like this will do a lot for our confi
dence" he added.
