# Card soccer splits invitational
## 
### David Earnest Staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team, hosting the first annual
Cardinal Women's Soccer Invi
tational, split their two weekend
matches, beating nationally
ranked University of Northern
Colorado 2-0 on Saturday before
losing 2-0 to Florida Interna
tional University yesterday.
The team's record now stands
at 3-2-1.
Sophomore forward Jennifer
Rowland and forward Stacey
Keare teamed up twice on Sat
urday to down Northern
Colorado. Rowland scored 29
minutes into the first half when
Keare's bouncing pass was
misplayed by a Colorado
defender. Rowland broke free
and deposited the ball inside the
right goalpost.
Rowland then scored again at
the 75-minute mark when she
volleyed a headed ball from
Keare. The rising shot came
from the left side of the goal
face and beat goalkeeper Shari
Lewis to the left post.
Stanford then played a con
trolled passing game to run the
clock down, and Colorado was
unable to regain the offensive
pressure they displayed early in
the first half of the match.
"It was nice to get them back,"
Rowland said after the match.
Last year Northern Colorado
beat the women 2-0 in Greeley,
Colo.
Stanford Women's Soccer
Coach Berhane Andeberhan was
pleased with Saturday's match.
"We have improved a lot this
season already," he said after
the game. "The women have
done everything I have asked of
them, and I'm very satisfied
with their effort and their atti
tude."
Sunday's match was a more
difficult outing for the women

as they lost a physical match to
Florida International. FlU's
Julie Del Russo scored seven
minutes into the match and as
sisted teammate Christine Lil
ler's goal in the second half to
defeat the Cardinal.
Stanford's loss on Sunday fea
tured some rough play, including
three yellow cards issued to the
Florida International team. An
deberhan, who was frustrated
with the game's officiating, said
that the referee did not control
the match as he should have.
"The officiating was fair be
cause the referee called the fouls
both ways. But he wasn't tough
enough. . . . The Florida players
lost their respect for the referee
early," Andeberhan said.
Stanford's Tonya Antonucci, a
junior midfielder, was injured
near the end of Sunday's match
on a hard tackle that went un
penalized. While the trainers at
tended to Antonucci, Andeber
han talked with the referee on
the field about the questionable
officiating.
Although Stanford lost the
game to Florida International,
the Cardinal midfielders effec
tively controlled the tempo of the
game. "We set the tactical tone
for the game," Andeberhan said,
"but they controlled the physical
tone."
Andeberhan was nonetheless
pleased with Stanford's play
Sunday. "There were a few good
opportunities we failed to con
vert and two [defensive] mis
takes that cost us," he said. "I'm
proud that the women kept their
composure. ... I'm no less proud
of them today as I was yesterday
[after the victory]."
The Cardinal Women's Soccer
Invitational is the result of the
coaches' and team's efforts to
attract attention to Stanford's
improving women's soccer pro

gram. "We know Stanford has
made a serious commitment to
soccer," Andeberhan said, "but
we want other people to know
this."
The Invitational field included
several national powerhouses.
The women's team from Califor
nia, Division I's second-ranked
women's soccer team, led the

talented group of teams that in
cluded Division ll's second- and
third-ranked teams, Cal State-
Hayward and Sonoma State.
The No. 6 and No. 11 teams
from Division 11, UC-Davis and
Northern Colorado, also com
peted. St. Mary'szand United
States International rounded out
the Invitational's field of eight.
