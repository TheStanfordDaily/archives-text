# Cross country starts off quickly
## Gray demolishes field, leads women to narrow victory over Ohio State 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
COLUMBUS, Ohio — Just hours
before Ohio State's football team nar
rowly squeaked by Louisiana State, the
Buckeyes' golf course was the venue of
another competition that was too close
for the competitors' comfort. By the
smallest of margins, the Stanford cross
country teams edged out their oppo
nents to begin the season with 1-0
marks.
The Cardinal men recorded a
resounding victory over host OSU and
a sizeable Tennessee contingent. With
just five runners on the current travel
ing squad, the women's team posted a
close 27-28 win over the Buckeyes in a
very tight race.
Junior Carol Gray, the Cardinal cap
tain, reasserted the dominance that has
made her a three-time All-American by
handily winning the five-kilometer race.
Finishing in an impressive 17 minutes,
21 seconds, Gray enjoyed a 34-second
lead over the second-place finisher,
OSU's Carolyn Moore.
"As I ran today, I felt I could hold
my form better and felt stronger," Gray
said. "[But] I am seriously lacking
speed. We'll do speed workouts (in up
coming practices), and I'm eager to get
working on my speed. I have the first
step, and I'm getting into the second."

Stanford sophomore Melanie Bloch
placed third with a time of 18:10, cer
tainly respectable in the first meet of
the season.
"Melanie really performed well," Gray
said. "She felt a little disappointed that
she was not that aggressive, but she
did well given the situation.
"I think we came into this meet a bit
tired. We didn't really come into this
meet — we trained into it,"the junior
added.
Less than a week after training camp,
the freshmen runners have already
begun to make an impact. Jodie Bilotta
of New Jersey and Oregon native Jennie
Heltzel finished sixth and seventh,
respectively, just ahead of sophomore
returner Wendy Neely.
The Stanford men shared similar suc
cess in their 8K outing. Beating out
Tennessee by a slim two points and
OSU by more, the Cardinal proved itself
a force to be reckoned with, as the top
five finishers completed the course
within 40 seconds of each other while
posting times below the 25-minute
mark.
"We were trying to group more —
that's what we were looking for," said
senior captain James Alborough, who
finished 12th in the three-team field to
round out Stanford's scorers (the top
five finishers from each team count
toward the score).

"Last year at this time, I was in
front," Alborough noted. "Now I'm run
ning faster, but there were four guys
in front and other guys waiting (at
home). It's a more open team, less or
dered than last year and there's no
number one runner."
Junior Eric Mastalir, however, seems
eager to step into this spot. Mastalir
finished a close second Saturday in a
quick 24:15 and promises to be a top
contender all season.

As I ran today, I felt I
could hold my form better
and felt stronger.'

Senior Steve Miller, a transfer from
Northwestern, provided a tough chal
lenge. Feeling right at home on a course
he has frequently run, Miller placed
fifth.
Finishing seventh in the meet and
third for Stanford was junior Mark Mas
talir, followed closely by freshman Dave
Scudamore. Alborough, junior Bill
Crowley and freshman Alex Accetta
rounded out the Cardinal competitors.
