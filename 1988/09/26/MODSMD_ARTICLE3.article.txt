# AIDS research leaps hurdle
## 'Human mouse' may lead to a number of elusive cures 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
A Stanford medical team has
made a crucial step in the research
of diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis
and leukemia by implanting the
essential components of the
human immune system into a
mutant mouse lacking its own im
mune system.
The implanted human immune
system might be capable of res
ponding to infections such as HIV,
the AIDS virus, as if it were at
tacking the immune system in a
normal human body.
"It's fair to say in AIDS, we
know virtually nothing about
what happens between the time
the patients get the disease from
the carrier to the time they die,"
said Irvine Weissman, a doctor at
the Stanford Medical Center and
a principal researcher of the dis
covery.
The research was spearheaded
by Stanford's Dr. Joseph M.
McCune, a postdoctoral fellow in
infectious diseases, as well as
Weissman who is a professor of
cancer biology.
Published in the Sept. 23 issue
of the prestigious Science maga
zine, 'the discovery has been

greeted by scientists around the
nation as a tremendous
breakthrough in the research of
HIV and many other viruses.
The methods of research have
raised some ethical questions and
launched dialogue between the
scientific team and several public
groups, including the Roman
Catholic Church.
Animal rights activists decry

the biological alteration of the
mice. Right-to-life groups are pro
testing the use of aborted human
fetuses as the sources of the im
mune systems implanted in the
mice.
According to the scientists, the
research was performed under
strict guidelines established by
