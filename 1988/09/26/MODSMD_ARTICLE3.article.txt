# AIDS research leaps hurdle
## 'Human mouse' may lead to a number of elusive cures 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
A Stanford medical team has
made a crucial step in the research
of diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis
and leukemia by implanting the
essential components of the
human immune system into a
mutant mouse lacking its own im
mune system.
The implanted human immune
system might be capable of res
ponding to infections such as HIV,
the AIDS virus, as if it were at
tacking the immune system in a
normal human body.
"It's fair to say in AIDS, we
know virtually nothing about
what happens between the time
the patients get the disease from
the carrier to the time they die,"
said Irvine Weissman, a doctor at
the Stanford Medical Center and
a principal researcher of the dis
covery.
The research was spearheaded
by Stanford's Dr. Joseph M.
McCune, a postdoctoral fellow in
infectious diseases, as well as
Weissman who is a professor of
cancer biology.
Published in the Sept. 23 issue
of the prestigious Science maga
zine, 'the discovery has been

greeted by scientists around the
nation as a tremendous
breakthrough in the research of
HIV and many other viruses.
The methods of research have
raised some ethical questions and
launched dialogue between the
scientific team and several public

Catholic Church.

fetuses as the sources of the im

panzees from similar research.
To develop this technique of
studying diseases, the researchers
took advantage of a rare condition
in some mice known as severe
combined immune deficiency
(SCID) in which the genetically
abnormal mice lack an immune
system to ward off disease.
SCID mice must be used as
hosts for the implantation. Other
wise, the normal mouse's immune
system would attack the foreign
immune cells, just as the human
body sometimes rejects the tissue

of another person during organ
transplants.
The SCID mice typically live
only about three or four months
before they die of infection,
whereas the SCID mice implanted
with a human immune system
have now lived 15 months.
"Conceptually, what we did was
to take the human organs that
are not fully developed ... put
them in the mouse and see how
they develop," Weissman ex
plained.
The researchers implanted
tissues from the fetal human
thymus, lymph glands and spleen
and also hematopoietic stem cells
from the human fetal liver into
the SCID mice to create the so
called "SCID-hu" mice.
Stem cells give rise to the dif
ferent kinds of blood cells. In the
SCID mouse, the injected stem
cells migrate to the implanted
thyroid tissue to form T cells, the
cells that are responsible for
recognizing and destroying all
foreign particles such as a virus
or a bacterium.
The T cells that have matured
in the thyroid are then sent out
into the blood stream.
Stem cells also create an envi
ronment for the B cells to grow,
part of another defense of the im
mune system. The B cells produce
antibodies to fight against certain
of the body's invaders, such as
viruses. These cells can only ma
ture with the help of the lymph
nodes, which McCune and Weis
sman also implanted successfully
in the SCID mice.

If there were no lymph nodes
in the mouse, the immune system
would not be able to function for
long. "It's like cars on a highway
with no gas stations to go to,"
McCune said.
Using mice that reproduce the
responses of the human immune
system, medical researchers will
be able to study the history of
infection — from its transmission
from the carrier to the death of
the animal — in far more detail

than previously possible.
Until now, primates alone could
be used for AIDS research, be
cause they are the only animals
besides humans that can be in
fected by HIV. If the mice respond
to human diseases as hoped, they
will provide an alternative to
primates as subjects of medical
research, curbing the use of chim
panzees and other dwindling
species of primates, according to
McCune.

McCune and Weissman said
they plan to look further into ap
plications of the SCID-hu mice to
understand infections. Along with
probing HIV, they foresee use of
the mice in studying other viruses
that affect the immune system
including the human T cell leu
kemia viruses (HTLV-1 and
HTLV-2) and the hepatitis B
virus.
The Stanford research was pub
lished within a week of a similar

publication in the journal Nature
by a team from La Jolla, Calif.
The other team also used the
SCID mouse to implant parts of
the human immune system but
used cells not from the human
fetus but from adult bone mar
row.
Although the research aims of
the Stanford and La Jolla groups
were different, the national press
has been comparing them. Many
people criticize the Stanford team
for using human fetal tissue un
necessarily, noting that the other
research group achieved their
results without it.
"I'm uneasy about that view
because they are not the same,"
McCune said.
McCune and Weissman de
fended their own research, saying
they have achieved fundamentally
different results from the La Jolla
group. The Stanford professors
said the other team has not im
planted the entire immune system
into the mice, but only various
blood cells from adult humans.
Although McCune and Weis
sman said they would have
prefered not to use human fetal
tissue, they point out that signif
icant research on AIDS and other
diseases today requires its use
before new methods, such as the
SCID mouse, can be discovered.
Weissman said what he wants
"most of all" is for the system to
work the way they now believe it
will, paving the way for future
breakthroughs. "We want to apply
what we do to human clinical dis
eases," he said.
