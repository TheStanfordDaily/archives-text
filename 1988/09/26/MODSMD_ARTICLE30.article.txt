# Men's soccer continues slide
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Sam Koch, Stanford's men's soccer
head coach, probably empathizes with
Jack El way right now. Elway's Cardinal
football squad seemed incapable of put
ting the ball over the goal line Saturday
at Oregon, while Koch's soccer team
similarly could not buy a goal in two
road losses last week.
The defeats, Stanford s third and
fourth consecutively, came at the hands
of fellow western competitors Fresno
State and United States International.
Both were hard-fought, defensive
games. Stanford allowed just one
second-half score in each game, and lost
both by identical 1-0 margins.
The losses were significant, because
of both the losing streak and the fact
that playoff teams are determined at
season's end by a team's record against
western opponents. In addition, Wed
nesday's game with Fresno State was
a Pacific Soccer Conference contest.
With the loss, Stanford went to 2-1 in
the PSC. Add Friday night's loss to
USIU, and the team's overall record,
which once stood at 6-0, fell to 6-4.

The trip was a disappointing one, par
ticularly from an offensive point of view.
The Cardinal has been shut out for
three games in a row, after scoring
nineteen goals in their first seven
matches. Losing three 1-0 games con
secutively would leave any team frus
trated. As Koch pointed out, "When the
offense doesn't score, it's hard to win."
However, there were some positive
elements to be taken away from the
trip. Stanford's defense has definitely
improved from its lull of two weeks ago,
when it surrendered seven goals in two
games versus San Jose State and Cal-
State Fullerton. "We were not ready to
play [in those games.] That never should
have happened," Koch said.
Koch noted the squad's improvement
over the last three games, but felt his
team could have done better. A peren
nially highly-ranked western team,
Fresno State avenged a 1-0 loss to Stan
ford last year when it scored a goal with
about two minutes remaining in the
game. Koch termed it a "defensive
lapse," and felt that, "If anything, it
should have been a 0-0 tie."
The Cardinal found more of the same
against USIU, a soccer team that has

had more than its share of tough losses
recently. Stanford had a lot of chances,
but it was USIU's goal with 30 minutes
left in the second half that proved the
difference.
The Cardinal had several shots go off
the post, and actually scored a goal only
to have it nullified by an offsides call.
Stanford fullback Mark Semioli then
had a great opportunity for his fourth
goal of the season, which would have
tied the game, but his shot narrowly
missed.
Koch singled out Semioli and
midfielder Luke Garrott as players that
shined on an otherwise dark road trip.
Semioli has 3 goals and an assist for
seven points on the season, while Gar
rott is also among the team leaders
with five points.
Freshman forward Rhett Harty, who
tallied goals in five of Stanford's first
seven games before cooling off along
with his teammates, continues to lead
all Cardinal players with 14 points.
Koch looks for his team's offense to
bounce back from the losses, saying,
"We had opportunities. We just didn't
cash in like we did in the beginning of
the season."
