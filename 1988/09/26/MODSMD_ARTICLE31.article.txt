# Field hockey falls in OT
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
Without the presence of their offense
oriented coach, Sheryl Johnson, the
Stanford women's field hockey team has
stressed defense in its first few games
this season.
And while the Cardinal's defense was
nothing short of amazing on Saturday,
a little offense certainly would have
helped.
In a heated contest against Chico
State, the previously undefeated Cardi
nal went down 1-0 in double overtime.
Earlier in the week, the team beat
Pacific 3-1 at home, with senior Kat
Thomas and juniors Tracy Stieglitz and
Michelanne Baker scoring for Stanford.
Saturday's game "could have gone
either way," according to Stanford As
sistant Coach Noelle Mitchell. Mitchell
has been filling in for Coach Sheryl
Johnson, who is currently competing on
the Olympic field hockey team in Seoul.
"Our goalkeeper (senior All-American
Karen Jones) played amazing. The de
fense is definitely clicking," Mitchell

said. Jones had a total of nine saves in
the game.
Sophomore Caroline Clevenger, the
Cardinal's backup goalie, gave a lot of
credit to the defense as well, especially
Jones and senior sweeper Wanda Kay
Key. "The team played really well under
pressure during the overtimes. I wish
we could have played that way for the
entire game," she said.
"The game could have gone either
way, but we didn't score when we had
our chances," Mitchell said.
She stressed, however, that Stanford
is usually an offense-oriented team, and
that even in the low-scoring game
against Chico State, the Cardinal con
trolled the ball for most of the game.
Clevenger added that Chico State's ag
gressive play made Stanford "come down
to their level" and hit the ball hard,
instead of passing it around more.
In Johnson's absence, sometimes the
offensive spark has been lacking, but
according to Mitchell, once Johnson
returns in early October "it will get us
going offensively."
