# Deans stress diversity within unity
## 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
The stereotypical Stanford stu
dent is seen as affluent, career
oriented, outgoing, preppy,
hardworking, self-confident, inde
pendent, ambitious, outdoorsy, in
telligent and All-American, newly
appointed Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas told
the class of '92 on Saturday in
an Orientation program.
About half of the audience in
Memorial Auditorium raised their
hands when Thomas asked the
freshmen how many thought the
description fit themselves.
"Now that you are (Stanford
students), you will have ample op
portunity to see at point-blank
range whether the student body
is a homogeneous one or not,"
Thomas said.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons joined Thomas in reinforc
ing themes of diversity within one
community.
"Like it or not, you are stepping
into a community that is uncom
monly pluralistic — and likes it
that way," Lyons told the fresh
men.
Dozens of sub-communities,
such as the freshman community,
the residence community, and the
ethnic communities make up the

Stanford community, Lyons saia.
"(However), keep in mind that
we are one. We are held together
by more than common plumbing
and parking lots," Lyons said.
Lyons mentioned the Honor
Code as an example of a common
belief shared by the students. The
Honor Code is an agreement be
tween students and faculty that
the students will do their own
work, in exchange for being free
from faculty proctoring of exams.
"Like most codes that work —
and the Stanford Honor Code does
work — they are more likely to
mirror than to shape our values,"
Lyons said.
"Our Honor Code works be
cause we want to be part of a
school . . . where we are free to
be honest," Lyons said.
Stanford has relatively few Uni
versity rules that govern local be
havior, according to Lyons. Stu
dents are left to work out many
of their decisions under the Fun
damental Standard of Student
Conduct, a broad University
policy asking that students show
respect for the rights of others.
Thomas asked the freshmen to
overcome "the notion that the fac
ulty members here are too busy
with their research to talk to you
about your ideas" and to pursue
research opportunities.

"The faculty members are re
alizing that, in the past, they have
underestimated the appetite that
you have for serious scholarship,"
Thomas said.
Thomas cited recent surveys
showing that one-third of fresh
men expect to earn a doctorate,
but that fraction slips to one-fifth
of graduating seniors. Thomas at
tributed the decline in potential
doctorate students to the notion

that faculty and research oppor
tunities are unavailable.
Lyons ended his speech with
safety advice for the incoming
freshmen.
"For a few minutes each day
— those between class breaks —
Stanford looks to the uninitiated
like a terrifying anarchy: cyclists
and pedestrians going in all di
rections and at all different
speeds," he said.


Like it or not, you are
stepping into a com
munity that is uncom
monly pluralistic —
and likes it that way. 112

'(However), keep in
