# Faculty split on outcome of first Bush-Dukakis debate
## 
### Eric Grunwald 
Stanford professors were
divided on who won the presiden
tial debate between Vice President
George Bush and Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis last
night, although most were pleased
with the quality of the debate it
self.
"George Bush won by a sub
stantial margin," said Senior Hoo
ver Fellow and Reagan adviser
Martin Anderson in a post-debate
interview on the MacNeil-Lehrer
News Hour. In an interview later,
Anderson said, "I think George
Bush performed better." Concern
ing the quality of the debate, he

said, "It was a good, informative
debate."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall had a mixed reaction,
saying, "Dukakis appealed to me
as addressing the issues more
realistically than Bush," but
added that "Bush surely held his
own and may have come out
ahead" in the eyes of the Amer
ican public. Marshall said the can
didates addressed the issues, al
though with some avoidance.
Political Science Prof. John

Manley said Dukakis clearly won
the debate in terms of public op
inion. "Dukakis had to show that
he was informed, that he was
steady and that his alleged
deficiencies in knowledge, for ex
ample in foreign policy, were false,
and he showed that," he said.
But Manley was not so pleased
with the quality of the debate,
exclaiming, "This is the dirtiest
presidential campaign I have ever
seen. George Bush has set a new
standard for low blows in Amer
ican pdlitics, and I think it will
be to his lasting discredit," Man
ley added, predicting that Bush
would be out of a job this January.
Terry Karl, asst. professor of

Political Science, said "Dukakis
was much stronger on substance
. . . and spent more time and was
more thoughtful on what he
would do" were he to become pres
ident. Bush, she said, spent more
time on "dirty tricks," trying to

say what he thought would get
him into office, but she added that
he did "an acceptable job." Over
all, "it was a good debate," ac
cording to Karl.
Political Science Prof. Robert
Packenham saw a split decision.
"Dukakis on balance won the first
htxlf and Bush won the second
half," he said. The first half of
the debate focused on domestic
issues, and the candidates then
moved into the issues of foreign
policy and national security.
"There were no knockout blows,
either self-inflicted or otherwise,"
he explained.
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara
Babcock, the assistant attorney

general under President Carter,
said, "I think it was a tie, but
since Bush is ahead (in the polls),
he won it."
According to Asst. Political Sci
ence Prof. Scott Sagan, Dukakis
won the debate "in the narrow
sense," saying Dukakis was a bet
ter, "more nimble" speaker. How
ever, Sagan said Bush won the
debate politically because "he had
more to lose, and he didn't make
a big mistake."
Stanford professors were
equally mixed on where things
stand in the campaign following
the debate.


Dukakis


Bush
it's not clear what the liberal or
conservatives policies are." One
of these, he said, was how each
candidate would deal with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. He also
added that "this is only the
seventh inning and anything can
happen in the next two months."
Packenham made no predic
tions about the effect of the
debate, but said the debate would

Anderson said, "Both George
Bush and Mike Dukakis have laid
out their policies on the issues,
the press has reported them and
the people understand them."
Calling the campaign a "classic
confrontation between left and
right," Anderson predicted that
"the American people will support
the conservative agenda of George
Bush."
Others were less decisive. Mar
shall said, "If some Americans
had some prior view of their pref
erences on the issues, then
tonight's debate was helpful in
making a choice." He went on to
predict that Bush's stances on the
death penalty, patriotism and
peace through strength would
help him, but said Dukakis won
on health insurance and housing.
Sagan disagreed that the issues
were clear, saying, "On some of
the issues that people care about,

'This is only the seventh inning and anything
can happen in the next two months.'

help Dukakis marginally because
it gave him "media exposure to
more people."
The issue of patriotism
prompted heavy discussion from
Stanford professors. Dukakis has
received much criticism from
Bush for proclaming himself a
"card-carrying member of the
American Civil Liberties Union."

Of the professors interviewed,
Manley was the most critical of
Bush, calling his attack on Duka
kis "reprehensible demagoguery."
Manley cited the First Amend
ment and said, "However odious
the viewpoint, it ought to be
heard" and not censored.
Professors Marshall and Karl
echoed this sentiment. Marshall

said the ACLU protected the
"very purpose of the First Amend
ment" and criticised Bush for
portraying the ACLU principally
as a defender of pornography. He
said Bush was "wrong fundamen
tally" on his view of the ACLU
and accused him of engaging in
"dirty tactics." Karl called it a
"McCarthy-type" attack.

Manley cited the First Amend
ment and said, "However odious
the viewpoint, it ought to be

Professors Marshall and Karl
echoed this sentiment. Marshall

said the ACLU protected the
"very purpose of the First Amend

portraying the ACLU principally
as a defender of pornography. He
said Bush was "wrong fundamen

and accused him of engaging in
"dirty tactics." Karl called it a
"McCarthy-type" attack.
Stanford professors were
divided on who won the presiden
tial debate between Vice President
George Bush and Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis last
night, although most were pleased
with the quality of the debate it
self.
"George Bush won by a sub
stantial margin," said Senior Hoo
ver Fellow and Reagan adviser
Martin Anderson in a post-debate
interview on the MacNeil-Lehrer
News Hour. In an interview later,
Anderson said, "I think George
Bush performed better." Concern
ing the quality of the debate, he

said, "It was a good, informative
debate."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall had a mixed reaction,
saying, "Dukakis appealed to me
as addressing the issues more
realistically than Bush," but
added that "Bush surely held his
own and may have come out
ahead" in the eyes of the Amer
ican public. Marshall said the can
didates addressed the issues, al
though with some avoidance.
Political Science Prof. John

Manley said Dukakis clearly won
the debate in terms of public op
inion. "Dukakis had to show that
he was informed, that he was
steady and that his alleged
deficiencies in knowledge, for ex
ample in foreign policy, were false,
and he showed that," he said.
But Manley was not so pleased
with the quality of the debate,
exclaiming, "This is the dirtiest
presidential campaign I have ever
seen. George Bush has set a new
standard for low blows in Amer
ican pdlitics, and I think it will
be to his lasting discredit," Man
ley added, predicting that Bush
would be out of a job this January.
Terry Karl, asst. professor of

Political Science, said "Dukakis
was much stronger on substance
. . . and spent more time and was
more thoughtful on what he
would do" were he to become pres
ident. Bush, she said, spent more
time on "dirty tricks," trying to

say what he thought would get
him into office, but she added that
he did "an acceptable job." Over
all, "it was a good debate," ac
cording to Karl.
Political Science Prof. Robert
Packenham saw a split decision.
"Dukakis on balance won the first
htxlf and Bush won the second
half," he said. The first half of
the debate focused on domestic
issues, and the candidates then
moved into the issues of foreign
policy and national security.
"There were no knockout blows,
either self-inflicted or otherwise,"
he explained.
Stanford Law Prof. Barbara
Babcock, the assistant attorney

general under President Carter,
said, "I think it was a tie, but
since Bush is ahead (in the polls),
he won it."
According to Asst. Political Sci
ence Prof. Scott Sagan, Dukakis
won the debate "in the narrow
sense," saying Dukakis was a bet
ter, "more nimble" speaker. How
ever, Sagan said Bush won the
debate politically because "he had
more to lose, and he didn't make
a big mistake."
Stanford professors were
equally mixed on where things
stand in the campaign following
the debate.

Bush
it's not clear what the liberal or
conservatives policies are." One
of these, he said, was how each
candidate would deal with Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. He also
added that "this is only the
seventh inning and anything can
happen in the next two months."
Packenham made no predic
tions about the effect of the
debate, but said the debate would

Anderson said, "Both George
Bush and Mike Dukakis have laid
out their policies on the issues,
the press has reported them and
the people understand them."
Calling the campaign a "classic
confrontation between left and
right," Anderson predicted that
"the American people will support
the conservative agenda of George
Bush."
Others were less decisive. Mar
shall said, "If some Americans
had some prior view of their pref
erences on the issues, then
tonight's debate was helpful in
making a choice." He went on to
predict that Bush's stances on the
death penalty, patriotism and
peace through strength would
help him, but said Dukakis won
on health insurance and housing.
Sagan disagreed that the issues
were clear, saying, "On some of
the issues that people care about,

'This is only the seventh inning and anything
can happen in the next two months.'

help Dukakis marginally because
it gave him "media exposure to
more people."
The issue of patriotism
prompted heavy discussion from
Stanford professors. Dukakis has
received much criticism from
Bush for proclaming himself a
"card-carrying member of the
American Civil Liberties Union."

Of the professors interviewed,
Manley was the most critical of
Bush, calling his attack on Duka
kis "reprehensible demagoguery."
Manley cited the First Amend
ment and said, "However odious
the viewpoint, it ought to be
heard" and not censored.
Professors Marshall and Karl
