Following an extensive internal
investigation into Stanford's
health and safety, University
President Donald Kennedy last
week announced a restruc
turing of health and safety man
agement.
On Sept. 21, Kennedy estab
lished two new positions dealing
with health and safety, instituted
a University Committee on
Health and Safety and set up a
process whereby the issue will be
periodically reviewed by him.
The announcement brought the
University's investigation into
campus health and safety full
circle. The complex investigation
began last December following a
letter to Kennedy from Jon Mol
destad, former Environmental
Safety Facility operations mana
ger. The letter contained allega
tions that Stanford wasted mil
lions of dollars and endangered
Stanford's students, faculty and
staff.
