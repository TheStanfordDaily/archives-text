Following an extensive internal
investigation into Stanford's
health and safety, University
President Donald Kennedy last
week announced a restruc
turing of health and safety man
agement.
On Sept. 21, Kennedy estab
lished two new positions dealing
with health and safety, instituted
a University Committee on
Health and Safety and set up a
process whereby the issue will be
periodically reviewed by him.
The announcement brought the
University's investigation into
campus health and safety full
circle. The complex investigation
began last December following a
letter to Kennedy from Jon Mol
destad, former Environmental
Safety Facility operations mana
ger. The letter contained allega
tions that Stanford wasted mil
lions of dollars and endangered
Stanford's students, faculty and
staff.
However, Assoc. Managing
Auditor David Fetterman said he
is satisfied with Stanford's recent
response to the allegations. Fet
terman, who conducted an inves
tigation into health and safety,
said, "They finally listened to
everybody." Fetterman added that
hp was pleased with the apparent
commitment by the University to
resolving the safety problems he
had found.
"The question, of course, is
follow-through," he said.
Included in Kennedy's restruc
turing are two new positions in
health and safety — a "Director
of Environmental Health and
Safety" in the administration
chain of command, and a co-equal
"Laboratory Safety Officer" un
der the provost.
The director of Environmental
Health and Safety is a senior level
position reporting to the vice pres

ident for administration. The ad
ministrator's responsibilities in
clude overseeing both the Health
and Safety Department and the
Health Physics Office.
The provost's laboratory safety
officer will be responsible for im
proving safety in academic and
research areas. "The provost po-

They finally listened
to everybody.'
— David Fetterman

sition is going to be much more
narrowly focused to laboratory
safety," said Ralph Buchanan, act
ing deputy associate vice presi
dent.
Buchanan will fill the director
of environmental health and
safety position while a national
search is underway. Likewise,
Patricia Devaney, associate dean
of research, will temporarily fill

the laboratory safety officer posi
tion.
In his report on health and
safety, Kennedy made it clear that
both officials will have "direct
access — independent of the line
organization — to the president
for emergency and quality control
purposes."
Kennedy also emphasized that
the officials were empowered to
order an end to any unsafe activ
ity.
Characterizing past problems
with health and safety as "com
munication problems," Buchanan
said the new organizational struc
ture will help alleviate this prob
lem bj allowing disagreements to
"bubble up" to high levels within
the administration.
Alain Decleve, director of the
Health and Safety Department,
agreed that many of the past prob
lems were communication ori
ented. According to Decleve, the
new positions will allow the rela
tionship between the research and
academic sides of the University
to improve.
