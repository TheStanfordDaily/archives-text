# Hot summer news kept Stanford stirring
## 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
Come mid-June, the pace of campus life shifts
gears. The hustle and bustle of finals week
ends, students pack it up for their three-month
break and Stanford settles down for a lazy-day
summer. But this time around, the University
didn't have much time to doze off. Instead, a
landmark court victory for Stanford athletes,
an invitation to Edwin Meese and some overly,
frisky felines were just some of the news stories
that kept the campus alive-and-buzzing all sum
mer long. For all those who were on leave over
the past three months, here's a look at some
of Stanford's top stories from the summer of
'88.

Stanford beats
V drug testing
After 17 months of legal bat
tling, two Stanford students
defeated the NCAA mandatory
drug-testing policy this August.
In a sweeping victory for soccer
player Jennifer Hill and football
player Barry McKeever, Santa
Clara County Judge Conrad Rush
ing ruled that the NCAA's urine
test violated Stanford athletes'
right to privacy under the Cali
fornia constitution.
Carrying on a court room battle
begun in January 1987 by Stan
ford diver Simon LeVant, Hill and
McKeever took up her cause last
October. In his preliminary in
junction last November, Rushing
barred random testing in all but
two sports, but said there was
some evidence showing that drug
abuse existed among football and
basketball players.
This August, Rushing wiped
out the NCAA's policy across the
board. The policy, which bans the
use of 3,000 different substances
ranging from caffeine and steroids
to heroin, was "clearly an invasion
of privacy" that could not apply
in any sport, Rushing ruled.
Even though the verdict is in,
NCAA drug-testing is far from a
dead issue. The NCAA plans to
take the decision to the California
Court of Appeals.

# Campbell won't
say good-bye
Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell came out fighting
in full force this summer. In late
June, the 28-year director of Hoo
ver threatened to sue Stanford,
saying that he refused to let the
University buy him off in its at
tempt to retire him next year
when he turns 65. During the
summertime battle, former U.S.
President Richard Nixon and Cal
ifornia Governor George Deuk
mejian sent Campbell words of en
couragement.
In June, the debate hit the floor
of the the U.S. Senate when
Senator Malcolm Wallop, R-
Wyoming, announced that "the
U.S. would be the loser" if Camp
bell were forced to retire.
Despite the prominent backing,
Campbell announced on July 21
that he was ready to step down
and become a lifetime counselor
at Hoover. Following negotiations
with Stanford Board of Trustees
President James Gaither, Camp
bell said he was "happy as a clam"
about the terms of their agree
ment which have yet to be made
public.
But in August, Campbell
seemed to have changed his mind,
saying that he would not volun
tarily retire under the terms pro
posed. However, Gaither reaf

firmed that Campbell's retirement
would go into effect on Aug. 31,
1989.
Hoover hires
'%** Edwin Meese
Former U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese III will become a
"distinguished visiting fellow" at
the Hoover Institution, Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell dis
closed this July.
Unknown to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, Campbell
invited the controversial attorney
general to come discuss an affilia
tion with Hoover. As director,
Campbell has the authority to in
vite visitors to use the Universi
ty's resources for indeterminate
time periods without consulting
the president.
"He (Meese) and I have been
discussing this for months,"
Campbell said of the invitation he
made public on July 7 — only
two days after Meese's announce
ment that he would resign from
his post as attorney general fol
lowing a 14-month special prose
cutor's investigation.
Reportedly, Meese will receive
$20,000 a year for his part-time
post at Hoover and will have
limousine privileges from the air
port to Stanford.
Rocky roads in
union talks
The United Stanford Workers
and the University underwent
some Sticky, stop-and-go negotia
tions this summer. Although their
three-yeaj contract expired Aug.
31, the USW has yet to establish
a new working agreement with
Stanford. However, they hope to
avoid the scenario of 1982 — when
negotiations resulted in a 30-day
union strike.
Made up of 1,300 technical,
service and maintenance workers,
the USW is calling for pay hikes,
a better pension plan, closer at
tention to working conditions,
more efficient grievance proce
dures as well as greater job secu
rity and employee benefits.
Negotiations came to an abrupt
halt Aug. 16 when University
lawyers allegedly walked out of
the bargaining room, refusing to
continue talks until students
dropped out of the bargaining.

The next day, both sides filed
charges of unfair labor practices
with the National Labor Relations
Board.
On Sept. 1, botn sides dropped
their formal legal charges. Nego
tiations, with students at the bar
gaining table, are progressing
slowly but surely.
Stanford mourns
'past graduates
Edward Paul Nicholson, a Stan
ford June graduate, died on the
evening of July 19 when his twin
engine airplane crashed into a
Portola Valley swimming pool. Al
though investigators ruled out
mechanical failure, they never de
termined the cause of the crash.
An experienced pilot, Nicholson
had just just been accepted into
a U.S. Navy flight training school.
Known as Buster to his friends
and fraternity brothers at the
Sigma Chi house, Nicholson had
worked as a teaching assistant and
as a teaching fellow for the Com
puter Science Department and had
been an active member of his fra
ternity.
The family requested that dona
tions be sent to: The Buster Nic
holson Memorial Fund to benefit
the Alpha Omega chapter of the
Sigma Chi Fraternity; P.O. Box
3695; Stanford, CA 94309.
A 1986 Stanford graduate ap
parently jumped to his death from
the 14th floor of a research build
ing of the University of California
at San Francisco Medical Center
on July 31. Austin Stanford
earned his bachelor's degree in
biological sciences here in 1986.
He wao a third-year medical stu
dent at UCSF.
.... Parents sue
.-"Stanford
In July, the parents of Robert
Yuan, a Stanford senior who died
in a canoeing accident at the Stan
ford Sierra Camp in May, decided
to sue the University. The suit,
filed in the Santa Clara Superior
Court on July 25, charges the Uni
versity with negligence in not pre
venting Yuan's drowning. The
Yuans are suing Stanford, the
Stanford Alumni Association anc
the Stanford Sierra Camp for an
unspecified sum of money.
.. Cats crowd
" * the Farm
Over the summer, Crane Pest
Control captured more than 100
campus cats. However, Stanford
maintenance employees reported
that potentially vicious felines car
rying parasites and fleas continue
to roam campus. According to Ray
Busley, an official at Crane, there
are "easily in the thousands of
adult cats" living in the shrub
bery, trailers and buildings on
campus. In the future, concerned
community members may play a
role in calling for better
controls over Stanford's cat pop
ulation boom.
J& Baseball wins
second crown
Out on the plains of Omaha,
Neb., the Stanford baseball team
won its second-straight College
World Series by defeating Arizona
State. Other than the University
of Southern California from 1970-
74, Stanford is the only school
ever to win two consecutive NCAA
championships. The NCAA title
was the third for Stanford last
year, and gave the University 11
NCAA titles in three years —
more than any other school in the
nation.

Chace departs
%•' for Wesleyan
In July, Stanford lost one of its
most eloquent professors/policy
makers to Wesleyan University.
After 20 years on the Farm,
William Chace has moved on to
Middletown, Conn., to become the
14th president of Wesleyan. While
at Stanford, Chace helped with
one of the resolutions that estab
lished Stanford's Western Culture
requirement. Last year, he also

helped fashion the compromise
that altered the course's core and
changed its name to Cultures,
Ideas and Values. Most recently,
he was vice president for Academic
Planning and Development and
was partially responsible for
raising the hefty $1.1 billion as
part of the University's Centen
nial Fundraising Campaign.
Known for his quick wit, Chace
was also a popular English pro
fessor here.
\ Disorder plagues
health and safety
An internal investigation into
University safety management,
which was completed this August,
criticized Stanford for waste and
mismanagement but found no in
stances of cover-ups. The report,
which came in response to a
former top official's charges of
corruption in the health and
safety department, recommended
reorganization of management re
sponsibilities. On Sept. 21, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
established two new administra
tive positions which will have the
authority to shut down any activ
ity deemed to present an imme
diate danger to health and safety.

Former U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese III will become a
"distinguished visiting fellow" at

Director W. Glenn Campbell dis
closed this July.
Unknown to University Presi

invited the controversial attorney

Reportedly, Meese will receive

Rocky roads in

The United Stanford Workers
and the University underwent
some Sticky, stop-and-go negotia

three-yeaj contract expired Aug.
31, the USW has yet to establish
a new working agreement with
Stanford. However, they hope to
avoid the scenario of 1982 — when
negotiations resulted in a 30-day
union strike.
Made up of 1,300 technical,
service and maintenance workers,
the USW is calling for pay hikes,
a better pension plan, closer at
tention to working conditions,
more efficient grievance proce
dures as well as greater job secu
rity and employee benefits.
Negotiations came to an abrupt
halt Aug. 16 when University
lawyers allegedly walked out of
the bargaining room, refusing to
continue talks until students
dropped out of the bargaining.

The next day, both sides filed
charges of unfair labor practices
with the National Labor Relations
Board.
On Sept. 1, botn sides dropped
their formal legal charges. Nego
tiations, with students at the bar
gaining table, are progressing
slowly but surely.

In July, Stanford lost one of its

After 20 years on the Farm,

Middletown, Conn., to become the
14th president of Wesleyan. While
at Stanford, Chace helped with
one of the resolutions that estab
lished Stanford's Western Culture
requirement. Last year, he also

helped fashion the compromise
that altered the course's core and
changed its name to Cultures,
Ideas and Values. Most recently,
he was vice president for Academic
Planning and Development and
was partially responsible for
raising the hefty $1.1 billion as
part of the University's Centen

Known for his quick wit, Chace
was also a popular English pro

\ Disorder plagues
health and safety
An internal investigation into
University safety management,
which was completed this August,
criticized Stanford for waste and
mismanagement but found no in
stances of cover-ups. The report,
which came in response to a
former top official's charges of
corruption in the health and
safety department, recommended
reorganization of management re
sponsibilities. On Sept. 21, Uni

established two new administra
tive positions which will have the
authority to shut down any activ
ity deemed to present an imme
diate danger to health and safety.

Come mid-June, the pace of campus life shifts

ends, students pack it up for their three-month
break and Stanford settles down for a lazy-day
summer. But this time around, the University
didn't have much time to doze off. Instead, a
landmark court victory for Stanford athletes,
an invitation to Edwin Meese and some overly,
frisky felines were just some of the news stories
that kept the campus alive-and-buzzing all sum
mer long. For all those who were on leave over
the past three months, here's a look at some
of Stanford's top stories from the summer of
'88.

Stanford beats
V drug testing
After 17 months of legal bat
tling, two Stanford students
defeated the NCAA mandatory
drug-testing policy this August.
In a sweeping victory for soccer
player Jennifer Hill and football
player Barry McKeever, Santa
Clara County Judge Conrad Rush
ing ruled that the NCAA's urine
test violated Stanford athletes'
right to privacy under the Cali
fornia constitution.
Carrying on a court room battle
begun in January 1987 by Stan
ford diver Simon LeVant, Hill and
McKeever took up her cause last
October. In his preliminary in
junction last November, Rushing
barred random testing in all but
two sports, but said there was
some evidence showing that drug
abuse existed among football and
basketball players.
This August, Rushing wiped
out the NCAA's policy across the
board. The policy, which bans the
use of 3,000 different substances
ranging from caffeine and steroids
to heroin, was "clearly an invasion
of privacy" that could not apply
in any sport, Rushing ruled.
Even though the verdict is in,
NCAA drug-testing is far from a
dead issue. The NCAA plans to
take the decision to the California
Court of Appeals.

a new working agreement with
Stanford. However, they hope to
avoid the scenario of 1982 — when
negotiations resulted in a 30-day
union strike.
Made up of 1,300 technical,
service and maintenance workers,
the USW is calling for pay hikes,
a better pension plan, closer at
tention to working conditions,
more efficient grievance proce
dures as well as greater job secu
rity and employee benefits.
Negotiations came to an abrupt
halt Aug. 16 when University
lawyers allegedly walked out of
the bargaining room, refusing to
continue talks until students
dropped out of the bargaining.

The next day, both sides filed
charges of unfair labor practices
with the National Labor Relations
Board.
On Sept. 1, botn sides dropped
their formal legal charges. Nego
tiations, with students at the bar
gaining table, are progressing
slowly but surely.

'past graduates
Edward Paul Nicholson, a Stan
ford June graduate, died on the
evening of July 19 when his twin

Known as Buster to his friends
and fraternity brothers at the
Sigma Chi house, Nicholson had
worked as a teaching assistant and
as a teaching fellow for the Com
puter Science Department and had
been an active member of his fra
ternity.
The family requested that dona
tions be sent to: The Buster Nic
holson Memorial Fund to benefit
the Alpha Omega chapter of the
Sigma Chi Fraternity; P.O. Box

Yuan, a Stanford senior who died
in a canoeing accident at the Stan
ford Sierra Camp in May, decided
to sue the University. The suit,
filed in the Santa Clara Superior

.. Cats crowd
" * the Farm
Over the summer, Crane Pest
Control captured more than 100
campus cats. However, Stanford
maintenance employees reported
that potentially vicious felines car
rying parasites and fleas continue
to roam campus. According to Ray
Busley, an official at Crane, there
are "easily in the thousands of
adult cats" living in the shrub
bery, trailers and buildings on
campus. In the future, concerned
community members may play a
role in calling for better
controls over Stanford's cat pop
ulation boom.

Neb., the Stanford baseball team
won its second-straight College
World Series by defeating Arizona
State. Other than the University
of Southern California from 1970-
74, Stanford is the only school

In July, Stanford lost one of its
most eloquent professors/policy
makers to Wesleyan University.
After 20 years on the Farm,
William Chace has moved on to
Middletown, Conn., to become the
14th president of Wesleyan. While
at Stanford, Chace helped with
one of the resolutions that estab
lished Stanford's Western Culture
requirement. Last year, he also

helped fashion the compromise
that altered the course's core and
changed its name to Cultures,
Ideas and Values. Most recently,
he was vice president for Academic
Planning and Development and
was partially responsible for
raising the hefty $1.1 billion as
part of the University's Centen

Known for his quick wit, Chace
was also a popular English pro
fessor here.
\ Disorder plagues
health and safety
An internal investigation into
University safety management,
which was completed this August,
criticized Stanford for waste and
mismanagement but found no in
stances of cover-ups. The report,
which came in response to a
former top official's charges of
corruption in the health and
safety department, recommended
reorganization of management re
sponsibilities. On Sept. 21, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
established two new administra
tive positions which will have the
authority to shut down any activ
ity deemed to present an imme
diate danger to health and safety.
