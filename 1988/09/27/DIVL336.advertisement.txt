Alan is getting a degree
in astrophysics.
Someone's got to tell him--
after graduation,the next
stop is Earth.
He's going to discover that there's quite a lot happening on this planet, in
polities, in the arts and theater. In business, as well as in science.
Of course, if Alan had been getting The New York Times, he'd have
done all the required reading necessary tor re-entry to the real world. He'd
be ready to talk with the natives, to live among them and to enjoy himself.
It's not too late tor you to avoid Alan's fate. Just fill out the coupon
bek>v», or see our representative on campus. We'll arrange to put The
Times in your hands every morning lor what you'll consider a remarkably
down-to-earth price.
