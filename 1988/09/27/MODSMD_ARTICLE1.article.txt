The completion of the Lilior Green
Rains Apartments late this summer has
made the housing assignment process
tremendously easier, according to Roger
Whitney, assistant dean of Student Af
fairs and director of Student Housing.
Housing almost 800 residents, the
Spanish-style graduate complex, located
at the intersection of Campus Drive and
Bowdoin Street and extending to Es
condido Road, was completed right on
schedule, Whitney said.
As a result of the new complex, grad
uate students willing to live in any grad
uate residence "were assigned by early
September, which was a first," Whitney
said.
The new apartment complex has also
taken a load off undergraduate housing.
With last year's closing of Roble Hall,
which housed about 300 students, and
this year's exceptionally large freshman
class, the Housing Office had a tough
time finding spaces, according to Whit
ney.
Every year many upperclass students
are knocked out of traditional under

graduate dorms by freshmen and trans
fers, he said. The addition of Rains has
opened many singles in Escondido Vil
lage for these upperclass students.
In the Rains complex, each of 30
buildings houses 12 to 40 students.
Overall, there are 246 two-bedroom,
one-bath apartments and 71 four
bedroom, two-bath apartments for a
total of 776 living spaces. Each has
private bedrooms, a kitchen, a living
room as well as dining and storage
space. For fall quarter, students are
paying $949 for both two- and four
bedroom apartments.
Chris Griffiths, assistant director for
single graduate residences, said students
were generally "very pleased" with their
accomodations. "They are amazed at
how beautiful (the complex) is," she
added.
Encouraged by the enthusiastic reac
tion of students at the welcome activi
ties, Griffiths noted that when residents
are happy about their living arrange
ments, they are more enthusiastic in
taking part in community activities.
