MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) —
Twenty-four members of the political op
position ended a hunger strike yesterday
but vowed to continue their non-violent
campaign against the leftist Sandinista
government.
The hunger strike by members of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate
began Friday after the government
barred a planned Sunday demonstration.
Interior Minister Tomas Borge said the
march had been called to provoke the
authorities.
Ramiro Gurdian, vice president of the
coordinate, a center-right coalition of 16
labor groups and political parties, called
the hunger strike the first in a series

of peaceful anti-government actions. He
told a news conference that other actions
could include longer fasts or work stop
pages.
The strikers said they also were de
manding the release of 38 Nicaraguans
jailed July 10 after an anti-government
demonstration in the southern city of
Nandaime. The government says the
detainees will be tried.
He said the detained political leaders
were being kept in "inhuman" condi
tions at a prison in Granada but "their
hearts are filled with patriotism that
Nicaragua will return to being a
republic."
