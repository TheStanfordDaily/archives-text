# Chileans controlled by fear, report says

BOSTON (AP) — The Oct. 5 presi
dential referendum in Chile will occur
in a political climate dominated by fear
as the military continues a successful
strategy of using torture to control
people, a study of the country concludes.
The report, "Sowing Fear: The Uses
of Torture and Psychological Abuse in
Chile," is based on a four-year investi
gation by the Boston area-based Physi
cians for Human Rights.
The organization claims that an at
mosphere of terror has been accelerated
in Chile by the emergence of para
military vigilante squads which are re
sponsible for kidnappings, rape, torture
and murders.
In the referendum, voters will deter
mine whether to elect General Augusto
Pinochet to eight more years as presi

dent or to have an open election in a
year. Pinochet came to power after the
military overthrew the socialist govern
ment of President Salvador Allende in
1973.
"Let's not be deceived by elections in
Chile — it's a country gripped by fear,"
said Jonathan Fine, the executive di
rector of the 1,000-member group and
one of the physicians who interviewed
alleged torture victims.
"In Chile you find a carefully planned
program of terror, a scientific approach
to intimidation designed so the country
will be paralyzed by fear and won't go
against the government," Fine said.
Two other human rights reports re
leased early this year said Chile's
human rights situation was improving,
but some repression continued.

Amnesty International said in an 18-
page report that the number of "disap
pearances" has dropped sharply since
1977, but has not stopped completely.
A United Nations report said human
rights violations including torture con
tinue in Chile, but the overall situation
is improving.
More than 700 people have disap
peared during Pinochet's rule, most of
them in a wave of repression following
the 1973 coup, according to interna
tional and local human rights groups.
The physicians' report said in many
instances entire communities have been
intimidated and terrorized by state se
curity agencies. The primary targets are
usually the poor, social and political
activists and those involved in human
rights issues.
