Jackson calls Bush mean-spirited
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Former presidential
candidate Jesse Jackson criticized Vice President
George Bush for running a "mean-spirited" cam
paign at a meeting yesterday of labor leaders
and supporters.
Jackson, who is beginning a heavy schedule of
campaign appearances on behalf of Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, also heralded the Demo
cratic candidate's performance in the first pres
idential debate Sunday as his "finest hour."
"There's a certain mean-spiritedness in this
Bush-Quayle approach," Jackson said of the Re
publican ticket, which he criticized for ignoring
the needs of many Americans, including women,
minorities, the homeless and the poor.
8-year-old killed in shooting spree
GREENWOOD, S.C. (AP) — A gunman walked
into an elementary school and opened fire yes
terday killing an 8-year-old girl and injuring 10
other people, authorities said.
Police Chief James Coursey said James William
Wilson, 19, of Greenwood had been arrested and
charged with murder. No motive for the shootings

was determined. Wilson was being held at the
Greenwood Law Enforcement Center.
Coursey said that shortly after 11 a.m., Wilson
entered Oakland Elementary School's front door,
walked to the cafeteria, pulled a .22 caliber, nine
shot revolver from his belt and opened fire, in
juring one teacher and three students.
Bentsen 'licensed' to hunt Quayle
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Democrats have sent
their vice presidential nominee, Lloyd Bentsen,
what they describe as an "official Quayle license"
for use in the upcoming debate with his Repub
lican counterpart Dan Quayle.
The so-called license is a wallet-sized card which
says it "entitles the bearer to bag one Quayle by
beating the Bush (as in George) during open
season on Nov. 8."
It was sent to Bentsen by Helen Boosalis and
Dan Morgan, co-chairs of Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis' Nebraska campaign.
"Having read about your enthusiasm for hun
ting both quail and Quayle, it occurred to us
that although you're probably licensed to bag the
former, you haven't been given a permit to hunt
the latter," Boosalis and Morgan said in a letter
to Bentsen.
