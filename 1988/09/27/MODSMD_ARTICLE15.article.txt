## It's a very fine line 
### 
Kennedy's emphasis on
community provides
balance for diversity

Bigotry is out.
University President Donald
Kennedy made that very
clear in his speech to the freshman
class last Friday. And he went one
step further by emphasizing the
important balance between diver
sity and commonality that must
exist in a community.
Kennedy should be applauded for
impressing on the incoming fresh
men, as well as on the Stanford
community as a whole, that the
tenuous balance between unity and
diversity must be maintained
within a community.
As he said, "We need to acknowl
edge both our shared humanity
and our personal and defining dif
ferences. But too much stress on
diversity and on cultural difference
may get us off on the wrong foot."
The sense of common humanity
Kennedy spoke about is the basis
for the "Stanford Family." But by
asking us to live in a family, Ken
nedy is not necessarily implying
that everyone must stifle their dif
ferences. Like any other family, the
Stanford community can at once
celebrate the uniqueness of each
member and coexist in an environ
ment of togetherness.
Marching behind a banner of di
versity can sometimes cause ten
sions that divide a family. For ex
ample, last year's tense interracial

relationships — which flared more
than once into raging controversy
— created an environment of dis
cord. Certainly we must continue
to struggle with the role different
groups play within the larger pic
ture of Stanford as a whole. We
must not become so relaxed in our
attitudes that displays of bigotry
and sexism no longer affect us.
But we should also foster a feeling
of unity and ease within the com
munity.
It is extremism in the pursuit
of our beliefs that Kennedy seems
to be warning against. We should
not allow our beliefs — noble as
they may be — to become so large
that they interfere with friendship.
Part of living in a group as diverse
as Stanford is the challenge of
learning about diversity and ap
preciating the differences existing
within the group.
But in order for the idea of a
"Stanford family" to be more than
just an empty concept, students,
faculty and staff must be careful
not to hide behind it. When faced
with glaring examples of ignor
ance, we must speak up and edu
cate those who need it. Diversity
is a blessing that comes with a
responsibility: Only through
awareness and understanding can
we avoid the problems experienced
in the recent past.
In the coming year, we can all
take advantage of the amazing
breadth of experience and back
ground in the Stanford community
if we all join in celebrating our
differences while realizing that
family is family.
