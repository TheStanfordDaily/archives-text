## Common heritage: the bond that binds 
### 
OUT OF THE American Revolution
grew a nation whose citizens took
their values from both the exam
ple and the experience of their European
forefathers. The Americans' convictions,
their courage, and the results of their
endeavors earned not only the respect
and admiration of countries abroad, but
inspired European pride in the United
States.
A commitment to liberty and peace was
central to the original intent and design
of NATO. The U.S. commitment to
NATO went hand in hand with the 1947
Marshall Plan that sought to provide Eu
ropeans with the economic help necessary
to rebuild war-torn nations. While the
Marshall Plan sought to restore economic
health, the NATO alliance sought to in
sure a continuing peace. It is important
to consider the purpose of NATO for it
rests on the premise that we and our
European allies share the value of free
dom and liberty and the desire to live in
a peaceful world. The bond that unites
us is the common conviction that we can
defend ourselves more effectively if we
do so together.
However, the nature of the relationship
between Europe and the United States
has altered over the course of the last

two decades. The argument is often prof
fered that the postwar rationale for an
interactive alliance between the United
States and Europe vis-a-vis the Soviet
Union or other potential adversaries has
been passed by time and technology so
that it is no longer of significant value.
Our country and two of our allies,
France and Great Britain, maintain so
phisticated nuclear forces under the as
sumption that we are prepared to use
them and in the expectation that they
will never be used. This situation leads
to a paradox: We seem to be the victims
of the very peace we have maintained so
successfully. But since 1945 Western Eu
rope has been free of war for the longest
period of time since the birth of Christ.
Thus we can conclude that the NATO
alliance has been an overwhelming suc
cess. For it has done what it was designed
to do: It has preserved the peace.
I would argue that the continued main
tenance of the alliance is imperative —
and that the efforts of those who seek
to discredit the purpose for which we
maintain arms might lead to the very
conflict they wish to avoid. If, in the eyes
of our potential enemies, we are unable
to defend ourselves, we invite attack.
The weakening of the will to preserve
a peace capable of enduring — in other

words, the wish to deny the threat posed
by the military power of the Soviet Union
— reflects a failure to understand what
peace is and how it can be lost. Like
freedom, peace is not an end in itself.
To illustrate the point, consider the pur
pose of the Berlin Wall: The freedom of
the western sectors of Berlin ha 3 been
preserved because French, Britain and
U.S. military forces have remained in
the city for more than 42 years — since
1945.
We need to remind ourselves, as free
people of the West, that liberty is not
cheap. And we should not forget that no
political development elsewhere has dis
placed the values of Western civilization
with better ones.
The defense of Western civilization is
the defense of the joint heritage of our
societies in Europe and North America.
The day this heritage is forgotten and
we fail to lend material and moral support
to the maintenance of freedom — whether
in divided Berlin or elsewhere — we place
our future in jeopardy.
