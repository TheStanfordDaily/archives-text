## Union retells ending to summer negotiation drama 
### 
We appreciate your May 26 article
on the contract negotiations "Union
will file charges," but we feel you
omitted an important point.
On August 16, the administration
attorney came into the fourth negotiat
ing session and gave United Stanford
Workers an ultimatum: Take the Stan
ford students off of the union negotiat
ing team or the administration won't
negotiate.
The Union's response was: The ad
ministration cannot dictate to USW
who is on the Union negotiating team.
USW filed a charge with the National
Labor Relations Board. So did the ad

ministration. It was at this point that
The Daily stopped publishing, so many
on campus never knew how this drama
ended.
According to the article in your first
fall edition, the drama ended when
"the two parties than agreed to return
to the table Sept. 1 before any legal
resolution was reached by the NLRB."
This statement glosses over what
really happened. On Aug. 30, the
NLRB phoned the administration attor
ney and the union attorney. He told
both parties that the NLRB intended
to request an injunction to force Stan
ford back to the table. This phone-call,

he said, was a 24 hour "courtesy"
notice. The very same day, the admin
istration attorney contacted the union
attorney. Subsequently, negotiations
resumed with students still on the
team, and the union dropped the
charges.
The administration now denies that
the NLRB had anything to do with
their resuming negotiations! This is
absurd! The timing of events speaks
for itself.
Why is the administration denying
this connection? Because it reveals that
the administration seriously violated
federal labor law when it tried to die-

tate the union's negotiating team. A
Reagan-era NLRB would not support
the Union and seek an injunction
against the employer unless the Stan
ford administration clearly and
seriously violated the law.
That is how the drama really ended
on Sept. 1.
Finally, we're very glad to have stu
dents on our team. Their advice and
input has been valuable and their com
mitment and dedication is an inspira
tion to the workers.
Linda Crouse
Chief Steward, USW
