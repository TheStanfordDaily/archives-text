# Hundreds of cats on campus need help from the University
## 
### 
Thank you for publicizing the prob
lem and tragic consequences of the cat
(over)population on campus by publish
ing Diane Paulson's letter of Aug. 5
and The Daily article of Aug. 9. Re
gardless of the number of cats that
now reside on campus (though we
doubt that they number in the "thou
sands," as Ray Busley of Crane Pest
Control estimates), Stanford should
establish and enforce a consistent
policy for the care of these animals. It
would also be helpful to have a contact
person on campus who could coor
dinate and handle inquiries regarding
the cats and the various humane
groups (e.g., Pets in Need).
We might also mention that in the
Daily editorial of Aug. 12, it is recom
mended that the Palo Alto Humane
Society should be "called in to round
up some of the hundreds of cats on
campus." Unfortunately, Stanford falls
within the jurisdiction of Santa Clara
County, whose shelter in Santa Clara
is already overcrowded, understaffed
and underfunded. As a result, most
strays brought there have little hope of
being adopted and are subsequently
euthanized.

We would like to mention the source
of the cats. Many cats are brought to
Stanford as kittens by students who
live in campus dormitories. These stu
dents abandon the cats out of ignor
ance, assuming that the animals can
fend for themselves, which is not
usually the case with animals raised as
pets. Thus, the problem is one of
educating students that cats cannot
survive on their own and that, if and
when the student leaves campus, he or
she must take responsibility for the
cat. We would suggest informing in
coming residential students of their
responsibility and of Stanford's housing
policy on pets — through flyers posted
in dormitories and notices placed in

registration packets.
We believe starving the cats now on
campus is inhumane, cruel and unnec
essary. It would be ideal if Stanford
and Palo Alto Animal Services could
negotiate an agreement whereby
animals trapped on campus would be
brought to the Palo Alto shelter for
adoption. The costs of such a program
could be borne by private and/or Uni
versity funds. A concerted effort by
Stanford at this time is very much
needed.
