# Debate audience votes capitalism the winner

Two political science professors
Sunday night challenged fresh
men to decide for themselves
whether socialism is a more "just"
system than capitalism.
Before a crowded audience in
Cubberley Auditorium, Prof. John
Manley tore down some of the
basic premises of capitalism while
Prof. Robert Packenham charged
that socialism cannot work in the
real world. At the end of the
dehate, the audience voted Pack
enham the overwhelming winner.
Packenham pointed out that
while socialism might sound like
an ideal system, it has not proved
successful in reality. According to
Packenham, when Cuba first be
came socialist, literacy increased
and wealth was distributed more
equally, but now the country a
controlled press, a party elite and
a failing economy.
"The other side of it is the prob
lem of what people can read once
they are literate," he said. "The
inequalities are in new forms and
no less disturbing than those in
capitalist countries."
Packenham cited Cambodia and
the Soviet Union as other exam
ples of socialistic failings, but

Manley had a quick respond to
his examples.
"The objector almost always
has a horror story about Cam
bodia or a reference to the Soviet
Union . . . that for all its selfish
ness and greed, capitalism is still
more productive. People are more
likely to extend themselves in a
cooperative society than in a com
petitive society where if I win,
you lose," Manley said.
However, Packenham went on
to note that capitalism is imper
fect because it is a human system.
"The Utopian idea that you can
create people who don't have com
petitive or materialistic urges has
led to the extremes (in socialist
countries)," he said.
Although both professors
sharply disagreed on whether
socialism is the needed alternative
to the current system, both
seemed to believe that capitalism
provides for economic inequality.
According to Manley, while one
seventh of the American people
live below the poverty line and
100,000 children are homeless, the
richest one-fiflh of the population
receives 43.7 percent of all income.
"In capitalism, health and life
have a price.
