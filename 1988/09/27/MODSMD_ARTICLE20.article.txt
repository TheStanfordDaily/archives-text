# Late financial aid offer leaves married student in the lurch
## 
### 
The Financial Aids office of Stanford
is not doing its job. I am a married
undergraduate student and desperately
need all the financial support available.
I met every deadline, filled out every
form, even submitted tax forms, mine
and my parents'. Yet here I find
myself, the fall quarter just about to
begin, with a $6,000 University bill
and no financial aid offer. This is the
second consecutive year I have been
put on hold for financial aid. According
to the financial aids office, independent
student applications just take longer.
Why?
Students should not have to suffer
the stress of wondering how they will
Eay their bills, literally, the night
efore they are due. If there are other
independent students who also endure
this miserable failure on the part of
the University, then I believe there is
a serious problem that needs to be
corrected.
Is it really too much to ask that aid
offers be processed before the bills are
due?
