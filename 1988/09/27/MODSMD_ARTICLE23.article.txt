## Bugging Stanford for 16 years The 						infamous Bug Me column: campus gadfly and trivia wiz 
### 
Bug Me is as much a part of Stanford as
fro yo, LSJUMB, and The Daily itself. It is
more than Ann Landers, Dr. Ruth and Dave
Barry combined. It will answer your ques
tions, solve your problems and make your
Tuesdays. And some people love it, some
people hate it, but everybody reads it.
Since Bug Me started in 1972 as a feature
devoted to helping readers with serious ques
tions about campus life, only its name re
mains unchanged. Bug Me now answers any
question for any reader who questions any
thing. It is your forum for airing those nag
ging questions, absurd speculations, and
flights of curiousitv that perpetually follow
you around, preoccupy, and ruin your out
look on life when you grow convinced that
no one will ever answer or address them
satisfactorily.
That's the Bug's job. Next week Mark
Smoyer will begin his term as this infamous
insect. And today you begin your term as
trivia teasers, data doubters, and question
ing collegiates.
We have selected here an assortment of
past Bug Me's — highlighting moments of
Bug genius, and illustrating stages of this
rare Bug's evolution to its present form.
From a first column query in 1972, "Who
can I get in touch with to work on the
McGovern campaign? " to last spring's ex
tensive description of the Star Trek hand
held phaser, Bug Me has spun a web of
little-known facts, intriguing information,

and irreverent revelations. Keep him crawl
ing this fall.
Dear Bug,
Is it true that you automatically get
straight A's if your roommate dies?

Imagine the consequences were I to say
yes!
It seems as though this question is an
swered every year in Bug Me, which just
goes to show that Stanford students never
give up on the power of positive thinking.
I called James Lyons of Student Affairs
and Norm Robinson of Residential Educa
tion, both of whom sounded decidedly of
fended that anyone would even have the
nerve to ask such a ridiculous question and
accused me of making it up.
I love this job!
According to Lyons, students whose room
mates go to that Big Dorm in the sky (my
euphemism) are given every opportunity to
pull their shattered lives back together (i.e.,
move all your stuff into the other guy's side
of the room — he won't be needing it).
Professors may be contacted and alerted
to the fact that the student needs some time
off, and tests or assignments may be delayed.
Often, an incomplete can be given and the
work completed at a later date. Lyons
stressed that Stanford grades, however are

a reflection of work completed and not of
a roommate's health.
These are, of course, blatant lies, because
I have in my extensive and exhaustive re
search come up with (Translation: "1 have
made up") a chart that shows what you get
for any mishaps incurred by a roommate:
Death: Straight A's. Dismemberment:
Straight B's. Serious social disease: Can Skip
any paper. Paralysis: Free ASSU lecture
notes. Loss of hearing: Problem set grade
raised one notch. Coma: extra mealcard.
