## Cardinal, Irish prepare for defensive skirmish 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
For the uninformed, yester
day's football press conference
must have been a little weird. The
only thing established was that,
if you can believe the coaches,
this week's Stanford-Notre Dame
match-up will be even lower
scoring than the Cardinal's 7-3
loss at Oregon last week.
Stanford Coach Jack El way, as
expected, had a lot of good things
to say about the Cardinal defense
that held the Duck's explosive of
fense to only 287 yards on Sat
urday. Lou Holtz, the coach of the
eighth-ranked Fighting Irish (3-
0), also praised his defense while
stating his offense was in a sorry
shape.
"The defense played extremely
well," Elway said. "That's a level
we want to maintain. . . . We came
up with a couple of turnovers,
gave the offense every chance to
win the game...."
Unfortunately, the Stanford de
fense will need to do it again. The
Irish have given up only 27 points
in three games this season, in
cluding wins over then-No. 9
Michigan and 1988 Rose Bowl
Champion Michigan State.
"Our defense has played awfully
well," Holtz said. "The only thing
I knew was if we weren't very
good on defense we were going to
be in big trouble because they

dominated our offense all through
spring and fall drills."
Keying the Fighting Irish de
fense is inside linebacker Michael
Stonebreaker. Stonebreaker has
36 tackles in the team's three vic
tories and has two interceptions.
The Irish defense will face a
Stanford offense that definitely
struggled last week. "Our own ex
ecution wasn't what it needs to
be to have a balanced attack and
put points on the board," Elway
said.
Of course, if Holtz is to be
believed, Notre Dame's offense is
far worse off. "I don't know
whether we'll be able to move the
ball against Stanford," he said.
"We're not a real good offensive
football team."
Well coach, if you guys aren't
a good offensive team, how did
you manage to score 52 points
against Purdue on Saturday? "It
just sort of happened," Holtz said.
"We have been able to win with
out throwing the ball a lot," Holtz
said, "but I am really impressed
with Stanford's defense. I don't
think there's any doubt we're
going to have to throw the ball
better to beat anybody, even in
the dormitory football league."
The Irish have thrown for only
237 yards in their three wins. By
way of comparison, Stanford's
Brian Johnson threw for 241 last
weekend alone. Notre Dame has
also thrown four interceptions,

despite having a ground-oriented
offense.
Stanford's offensive woes are
easier to pinpoint. "I attribute
most of our problems to execu
tion," wide receiver Henry Green
said. "We had the right plays on
at the right time. That was pretty
evident. It just wasn't there."
The Cardinal is planning few
changes on offense according to
Green, spending the time perfect
ing the running of the plays al
ready in the playbook. Green, who
caught four passes for 89 yards,
will likely be a big part of the
offense again.
Wideout Ed McCaffrey, the
starter last season, is still suffer
ing from a deep thigh bruise suf
fered in the team's first scrim
mage. "He won't be ready to play
Saturday," Elway said. "He's less
than doubtful you might say.
[Tight end Jim] Price should be
out there practicing, though."
Price has played only a few
plays this season but appears to
be recovered from his injury.
The other news on the injury
front is also pretty good. At
Oregon defensive tackle Lester
Archambeau sprained the right
knee he originally ir\jured against
San Diego State, but he is ex
pected to be ready for Saturday.
Noseguard Ray Huckestein (sore
back, sprained foot), strong safety
Blaik Nichols (sprained ankle),
strong safety Rob Englehardt

(thigh bruise) and free safety
Mike Newton (minor cartilage
damage in his knee) are all listed
as probable for the trip to South
Bend.
Green feels the team will
bounce right back from the loss.
"I don't think it's going to be that
tough [to bounce back][," he said.
"We're mostly just angry and that
anger is going to be channeled

into good things on the practice
field and good things on Satur
day."
