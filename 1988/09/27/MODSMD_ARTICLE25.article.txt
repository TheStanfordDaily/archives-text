# Intrigue, psychodrama and Mr. Kim — one man's Olympics
## 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea — When noth
ing's safe and nothing's sane amidst all
of the fireworks of the Summer Olympics,
one gets used to being expendable.
That's true whether you are a runner
(gopher, slave, whatever you want to call
it) for NBC's boxing coverage or a medal
contending boxer. You accept the ex
traordinary because everything here is
extraordinary.
So last week, I'm assigned to go on an
errand to the main NBC office at the
International Broadcasting Center. Going
in the car with me are Janis Murray, an
NBC camerawoman who is going to see
a doctor, and boxing announcers Marv
Albert and Ferdie Pacheco, who are going
back to their hotel.
Our driver, Mr. Kim Jae Ok, has the
nickname "Kamikaze Kim." He is not
different from other drivers in South
Korea, who are aggressive, weaving

through traffic like it were needlepoint
and holding down the horn like they are
wrestling down a grizzly bear.
He is rather the most extreme, a
Korean driver raised exponentially, the
Steinbrenner of the expressway.
Anyway, the decision comes up as to
whether Albert or I will be the third to
squeeze into the back seat. Pacheco be
came known as the "Fight Doctor" for

being in Muhammad Ali's corner for over
a decade. He has acquired a keen mind
for analyzing situations both in and out
of the ring.
Therefore, his word is accepted as
gospel when he says simply, "Well, we
can't afford to lose Marv." I sit comfort
ably, if temporarily, in the front seat.
But there really was no need for me
to worry. As Albert said about our up
coming drive, "There can't be any more
controversy than what we've had today."
You can always count on a television
announcer for a good transition.
You see, we've been having an informal
competition on how best to describe the
mayhem of the first week of 1988 Olym
pic boxing. Albert's word was "intrigue."
Wally Matthews, the third boxing an
nouncer, chose "ugly psychodrama." My
humble offering was "full-contact tag
team floor hysteria."

It had been a wild 24 hours for the
NBC crew leading up to the morning of
Sept. 20th - and this is even before a
melee broke out over a decision against
Korean boxer Byun Jung-Il Sept. 22.
Just after wrapping up a story about
a Canadian boxer winning his protest, a
rarity in itself, we realized American mid
dleweight Anthony Hembrick hadn't
shown up for his first fight.
I'm camped out in the production truck
again this morning, so I'm not down at
ringside. But with all the cameras, I'm
everywhere.
One camera has the shot of the Korean
opponent, Ha Jong-Ho, sitting placidly in
his corner. Another camera follows Mat
thews around as he tries to unravel the
controversy. Another peers up a tunnel
toward the dressing room.
Five minutes after the fight was sup
posed to start, Hembrick and U.S. Coach

Ken Adams walk in in their warmup
suits. As they begin explaining what hap
pened, Ha is announced as the winner
of the fight by walkover.
With this extraordinary gaffe by the
United States coming to fruition, we get
word from the control room at the IBC
that NBC wants us to be ready to go on
the air live. That, more than anything
else, unleashed our own "ugly psyc
hodrama."
Even though we will go on "live," there
are so many people that have to be in
terviewed that a package of taped mate
rial had to be put together within
minutes.
That meant Matthews, who was solely
a newspaper reporter for Newsday until
this spring, suddenly materialized as Sam
Donaldson. He thrust his microphone into
