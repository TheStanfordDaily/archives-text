# Spikers to face a red-hot SJSU
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Next to the exciting action in Seoul, San Jose
will be the hotbed of intense volleyball competition
tonight when the Stanford women's team visits
cross-town rival San Jose State in an attempt to
besmirch the Spartans' perfect season record.
Out to an 11-0 start and currently enjoying the
No. 12 ranking on the American Volleyball Coaches
Association poll, San Jose State will set a school
record for consecutive victories should it defeat the
Cardinal. The incentive is clearly present, but the
Spartans may well find themselves outgunned and
outplayed by their stiffest competition to date.
Stanford, rated third in the nation and boasting
an impressive 8-1 record (the sole loss coming at
the hands of No. 1 UCLA), enters the match fresh
off a weekend sweep of Arizona and Arizona State
on the road and provides a sizeable obstacle for the
streaking Spartans. With potent weapons outside
as well as in the middle, the steady and strong
Stanford squad is ready for the match.
"If we play well and they play well, chances are
we'll probably win," Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"They have smaller outside hitters this year, and
they're inexperienced — one's a freshman and one's
a sophomore. Their experience is primarily in the
middle, but it's hard to say how their middle will
deal with ours."
With the starting middle blocking tandem of
senior Laura Olesen and freshman Amy Cooper
playing well, bolstered by the strong off-the-bench
performances of freshman Nicole Appleman, the
Cardinal has established itself as a tough blocking
team, averaging a stellar 6.1 blocks per game. Cou
pled with a diverse offensive game plan for the
quick hitters, the defensive prowess at the net may
well be the bane of Spartan star Kari Roberson's
efforts in the middle.
But it is the outside hitters who will have the
best chance to hit paydirt in San Jose. Senior Amy
Hayes is coming off a particularly successful set of
matches in Arizona and is playing very solid vol
leyball, and freshman Kristin Klein has continued
to lead the Cardinal in hitting and digging. Against
an outside of this caliber, the Spartans will have
to pull many a trick to bring about a win.
"They're a good, really scrappy team, and we're
just going to go in and concentrate on playing our
game," Klein said. "Don has prepared us for deep
corner shots and a lot of junk off the block, so
we're going be ready for that."
"It's not a powerful, hard-hitting team, so it's

real important to be alert and
ready to move out there rather
than dug in and ready to dig hard
hit balls," Shaw said. "You have
to expect to cover more area with
a team like San Jose State."
Hardly a finesse-oriented team,
Stanford plays a powerful and
quick game. Klein and junior Jen
nifer Chaffee have howitzers for
right arms, and the middle block
ing corps is extremely quick.
What is important for the Car
dinal, however, is to maintain a
high level of play and concentra
tion no matter what the squad
encounters. Even if outmatched,
San Jose State will be up to play
and ready to capitalize on any

sloppy Stanford play.
"Sometimes when you play a
team that isn't as strong, you
don't concentrate or get as fired
up," Klein observed. "You get all
pumped up when you play a really
good team. But they're going to
be really fired up to play us, be
cause if they win they are going
to make a school record. They're
going to have a big crowd and be
fired up, so we are going to have
to be just as fired up to beat
them."
"The main thing is when you
talk about playing our game, that
just means concentrating on what
we do on our side of the net,"
Shaw said. "A lot of times you
get caught up in trying to figure
what the other team is doing, and
you get so caught up in watching
the other team that you don't take
care of things on your side of the
net."
