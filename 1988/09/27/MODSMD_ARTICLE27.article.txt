SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
— Ben Johnson was caught
cheating, and the Olympics was
cheated of one of its greatest
moments. He took steroids, so
Carl Lewis got the gold medal
— and the world's fastest 100-
meter dash was a 10-second
sham.
"This is a blow for the Olym
pic Games and the Olympic
movement," International
Olympic Committee president
Juan Antonio Samaranch said.
Johnson, 26, of Canada, was
banned from international
competition for two years by
the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, and
Canadian sports minister Jean
Charest said Johnson also was
kicked off the national team
for life, pending appeal.
"We feel sick about it," Pat
Reid, a Canadian coach, said.
"The whole world feels sick
about it."
"We are acutely aware of how
devastating this news will be
to millions of people,"
Canadian chef de mission Carol
Anne Letheren said.
Lewis, meanwhile, may once
again go after an unprece
dented repeat of his quadruple
gold medal performance of
1984. He won the long jump
Monday and still has the 200
meters and 400-meter relay
coming up.
Louganis, who won the
springboard event last week
despite cracking his head open
on the board during qualifying,
won the platform on Tuesday
with 638.61 points. He needed
85.57 points on his final dive
to win.
He got 86.70 with a reverse
3Vtj-Bommersault, the most dif
ficult in platform diving, his

head missing the board by
inches.
"I knew I had to hit the last
dive," Louganis said. "I knew
it was going to be tight....
Like in '84, I reminded myself
that my mother's still going to
love me no matter what hap
pens, which makes it easier."
Louganis is the first man to
sweep the two diving events in
consecutive Olympics. Pat
McCormick, mother of
springboard bronze medalist
Kelly McCormick, swept both
events in the 1952 and '56
Games.
Lewis was second in the
world's fastest 100 meters, and
with his second gold, he may
now resume his bid for another
four-gold grand slam at the
Olympics. Four years ago, he
won four gold when the Soviet
bloc stayed away. Now, he
could win four gold without ac
tually finishing first in the 100.
Johnson's manager, Larry
Heidebrecht, said the finding
of steroids was either "a mis
take or sabotage." In a news
conference Tuesday morning,
Heidebrecht said he believed
the steroids were contained in
a bottle of "sport drink" given
to Johnson either before the
100 semifinals or finals.
Lewis, in an emotional, high
strung performance, captured
the gold medal in the long jump
Monday with a leap of 28 feet
7 inches, becoming the first
man to defend that title. Roger
Kingdom, another American,
also defended an Olympic title
with the third fastest time ever
in the 110-meter high hurdles.
But the attention focused
then on Lewis, and now, even
more so, as he most likely will

be the heir to the gold. Johnson
won the 100 in an amazing 9.79
seconds — .04 under the world
record he set last summer at the
world championships in Rome.
Lewis was second in an American
record 9.92.
Danny Manning's 18 points led
the U.S. basketball team over
Puerto Rico 94-57 and into the
semis against the Soviet Union,
where the two teams will meet in
the Olympics for the first time
since America's one-and-only loss
at the 1972 Munich Games. The
Soviets earned their berth with a
110-105 victory over Brazil.
Australia plays Yugoslavia in the
other semifinal.
