## Hospital's 500 th heart recipient gets car 
### 
Stanford Hospital's 500 th
heart transplant patient left the
hospital last week with not only
a new heart and a new life,
but also a classic 1965 Mus
tang.
Stephen Graves' grandfather
gave him the car near the
hospital last Thursday, only a
few days after the 19-year-old
East Palo Alto man received
medical clearance to operate a
vehicle.
Although Graves left the
hospital on Sept. 9, he has con
tinued with out-patient care to
monitor his condition.

Dr. Edward Stinson, profes
sor of cardiovascular surgery
and head of Stanford's heart
and heart-lung transplant pro
gram performed the
transplant.
Early last fall, Graves devel
oped cardiomyopathy, a rare
but often fatal deterioration of
the heart muscle. The exact
cause is unknown, but physi
cians believe the condition is
triggered by a virus in persons
who are genetically
predisposed.
