The practicality of computer
science clashed with the insight
of philosophy Sunday night when
two professors debated whether
computers will one day be able to
think.
Asst. Philosophy Prof. John
Dupre charged that computers as
we know them will never be able
to think. However, Nils Nilsson,

chairman of the computer science
department, argued that in the
future computers may be able to
reason, understand and learn.
Of the 50 students who attended
the debate in Jordan Hall, about
two-thirds sided with Nilsson.
The discussion, aimed at chal
lenging freshmen to question tech
nology, was one of three Orienta
tion faculty debates held oil Sun
day.

In their opening statements, the
professors expressed their ideas
on computers and the definition
of thinking. Dupre said thinking
involved the ideas of conscious
ness, intelligence and purposeful
ness. He also said that throughout
history, people have falsely
believed technological innova
tions, including the computer, are
keys to understanding the brain.
Nilsson, on the other hand, said

computers are constantly chang
ing and could someday be made
of protein and artificial neurons.
Dupre countered Nilsson, say
ing that if one defines computers
in terms as broad as Nilsson's,
then computers could be made to
think. But the big difference be
tween computers and humans, he
said, is that computers only print
on the screen, not actually think.
