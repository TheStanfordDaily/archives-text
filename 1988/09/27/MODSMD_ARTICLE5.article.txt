# SLAC officials still pleased with collider despite setback
## 
### Rob Burwell Editorial staff 
Despite the setback of shutting down
operations on the Stanford Linear Col
lider for modifications, officials at SLAC
reported yesterday that they have still
set a precedent by developing the world's
first linear collider.
"The first goal has been accom
plished," SLAC science information of
ficer Michael Riordan said. "We have
built an experimental machine that had
never been tried before. We made a
micron-sized beam of electrons and
positrons collide."
SLAC scientists experienced difficulty
this summer in creating and detecting
the Z-particle, the massive subatomic
particle the machine was designed to
study. The collider will not be in full
operation until next February due to
the modifications scheduled for this fall
and winter.
Although no Z-particles were detected
by the device put into action last June,
SLAC physicists were proud to an
nounce that the concept of the linear
collider had been proven. Z-particles are
believed to carry the "weak" nuclear
force.
The significance of having the first
successful linear collider is demonstra
ted by the fact that the Japanese, the
Europeans and the Soviets are investing
millions of dollars in them, SLAC di
rector Burton Richter told Campus
Report. Richter is in Washington D.C.
and was unavailable for comment.
"Those programs are really gearing
up fast," Richter said. "Most people are

looking at what the next generation
linear collider will be, as we are. So it
isn't just our dream now."
SLAC physicists were not able to
achieve their second goal, however. Al
though the beams were in collision for
more than 60 hours, none of the Z
particles were detected, Riordan said.
In a linear collider, electrons and their
anti-matter counterparts, positrons, are
simultaneously "pushed" by microwave
energy down SLAC's two-mile-long ac
celerator parallel to one another in
beams. The beams are then bent by arc
magnets until they are aimed at one
another and primed for collision inside
a huge detector that will determine ex

actly what particles were created by the
intersection of the beams.
Two goals of the modifications will
be to improve the percentage of time
the beams intersect and to increase the
number of particles (electrons and
positrons) per bunch, thus raising the
beam intensity, Riordan said.
In July, the beams only intersected
about 6 percent of the time, Riordan
said, adding that for the project to be
successful the beams will need to inter
sect a great deal more. For SLAC to
eventually increase the number of Z
particles , the percentage of intersection

will have to be raised to at least
20 percent of the time and even
tually up to 50 percent through
adjustments and modifications of
the collider.
Riordan cautioned that to in
crease the beam intensity, "there
are a number of modifications
along the line that need to be
made and certain limitations need
to be removed."
One of the main modifications
Riordan mentioned was the
upgrading of the lines that bring
electrical power to the klystrons,
the devices that create the

microwaves that accelerate the
electrons and positrons. He said,
"a new power distribution system
would be necessary to run the
system as designed. The old sys
tem is simply inadequate."
Large iron magnets may also
be added to deflect background
particles away from the detector.
The linear collider was created
using many of the already existing
SLAC facilities. Millions of dollars
were saved by using what Richter
called "1962 vintage" equipment,
although he admitted to Campus
Report that using the older equip
ment and "cutting corners" may
have contributed to SLAC's ina
bility to actually create and detect
a Z-particle.
