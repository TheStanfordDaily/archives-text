# Gay, lesbian, bisexual community
## University funds combined center 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Twenty years ago, the Student
Homophile League of Stanford became
the second known homosexual student
group in the nation. The group's foun
der used a pseudonym to protect his
identity.
Today, the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community has its own University
sponsored community center on the sec
ond floor of the Old Firehouse.
The center is considered a department
of Student Affairs and will receive Uni
versity funding, staff time, equipment,
office space and the resources of the
Office of the Dean of Student Affairs.
The center will serve as an adminis
trative umbrella for the many gay, les
bian and bisexual groups on campus,
including the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford and the Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian and Gay Equality.
"It (the center) will be just like the
Women's Center or El Centro Chicano,"
said Michael Ramsey-Perez, director of
Student Organization Services and
budget officer for the center.
"The security and continuity is very
important, as well as better communi
cation with the administration," Bao
said, noting that the gay, lesbian and
bisexual community now will have
"much greater resources for support,
outreach and education."
The University made the commitment

to recognize and sponsor the new Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter after an incident at Otero House
opened the administration's eyes to the
problem of homophobia on campus.
In that incident, Residential Educa
tion evicted a freshman from Otero for
alleged homophobic and belligerent be
havior. Following the eviction, seven
masked members of the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity staged a candlelight protest
vigil that sparked charges of racism.

The Otero incident "refocused atten
tion" on campus homophobia and
heterosexism, graduate student Daniel
Bao said. "Heterosexism" is a term de
scribing the automatic assumption of
heterosexuality.
He estimated that GLAS has been
lobbying for material support from the
University, including guaranteed office
space and staff support, for eight or


Only a few schools have
taken this positive,
groundbreaking step of
officially sponsoring a
gay, lesbian and bisexual
organization. The move is
a bold action by the Uni
versity — GLAS had not
even asked for total spon
sorship until early last
year.
