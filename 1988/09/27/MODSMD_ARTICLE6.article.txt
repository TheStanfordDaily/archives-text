# Gay, lesbian, bisexual community
## University funds combined center 
### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
Twenty years ago, the Student
Homophile League of Stanford became
the second known homosexual student
group in the nation. The group's foun
der used a pseudonym to protect his
identity.
Today, the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community has its own University
sponsored community center on the sec
ond floor of the Old Firehouse.
The center is considered a department
of Student Affairs and will receive Uni
versity funding, staff time, equipment,
office space and the resources of the
Office of the Dean of Student Affairs.
The center will serve as an adminis
trative umbrella for the many gay, les
bian and bisexual groups on campus,
including the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford and the Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian and Gay Equality.
"It (the center) will be just like the
Women's Center or El Centro Chicano,"
said Michael Ramsey-Perez, director of
Student Organization Services and
budget officer for the center.
"The security and continuity is very
important, as well as better communi
cation with the administration," Bao
said, noting that the gay, lesbian and
bisexual community now will have
"much greater resources for support,
outreach and education."
The University made the commitment

to recognize and sponsor the new Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter after an incident at Otero House
opened the administration's eyes to the
problem of homophobia on campus.
In that incident, Residential Educa
tion evicted a freshman from Otero for
alleged homophobic and belligerent be
havior. Following the eviction, seven
masked members of the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity staged a candlelight protest
vigil that sparked charges of racism.

The Otero incident "refocused atten
tion" on campus homophobia and
heterosexism, graduate student Daniel
Bao said. "Heterosexism" is a term de
scribing the automatic assumption of
heterosexuality.
He estimated that GLAS has been
lobbying for material support from the
University, including guaranteed office
space and staff support, for eight or


Only a few schools have
taken this positive,
groundbreaking step of
officially sponsoring a
gay, lesbian and bisexual
organization. The move is
a bold action by the Uni
versity — GLAS had not
even asked for total spon
sorship until early last
year.

nine years.
The University realized after
the Otero incident that without
some concrete action its support
for the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community might be questioned,
according to Bao.
"Their rhetoric had to be
matched with action," he said.
But Bao also pointed out that
actions more severe than those at
Otero have plagued the gay, les
bian and bisexual community for
years.
Gay, lesbian and bisexual stu
dents have had trash dumped in
front of their rooms. Personal
property has been defaced with
slurs and threats. Roommates
have moved out despite a Univer
sity policy prohibiting such action.
The answering machine at GLAS
has received bomb and death
threats. And Bao added that gay,
lesbian and bisexual students
commonly suffer verbal abuse
from other students.
The Otero incident was promi
nent "not because of the homo
phobic behavior, but because of
the supposedly racist Phi Delt be
havior," said Bao. He said the
original acts targeting a gay res
ident assistant were relegated to
secondary news after attention
focused on the allegedly racist
demonstration.
"It pointed out the relationship
of homophobia to other -isms," he
added.
But Bao was also quick to point
out the merit of the University's
action in funding the center.
"Only a few schools have taken
this positive, groundbreaking
step" of officially sponsoring a
gay, lesbian and bisexual organi
zation, he said.
Calling the move a "bold action"
by the University, Bao explained
that GLAS had not even asked
for total sponsorship until early
last year. At that time, money
was the primary obstacle, not
University opposition to the
group.
"GLAS had been increasing its
requests for support, and we
found our responses weren't suf

ficient," Perez said.
As a voluntary student organi
zation, GLAS competed for lim
ited funding with the myriad of
other clubs and groups on
campus.
Michael Jackson, associate dean
of student affairs, said he feels
the sponsorship shows "the Uni
versity believes lesbians, gays and
bisexuals should be treated fairly."
Already, the center has assisted
with RA training and a sexual
diversity program for new student
orientation.
The group plans to host a kick
off celebration Oct. 4 and a pro
gram for National Coming Out
Day Oct. 11.
The inclusion of the word
"bisexual" in the center's name
reflects the symbolic union of the
gay, lesbian and bisexual commu
nities emphasized by the center.
Bisexual men and women often
complain of feeling alienated from
both the heterosexual and gay
communities because they belong
to neither group exclusively.
"There was never any question
that bisexual would be in the
title," Bao said. "There was over
whelming support for it."
He explained that gay men and
lesbian women sometimes refer to
themselves as bisexual when they
are coming out to "make it
easier," and therefore bisexualism
is occassionally looked upon with
suspicion in the gay community,
he added.
Many GLAS activites will now
be coordinated through the center,
such as film series, study breaks,
a discussion group for those com
ing out, a men's discussion group,
women's happy hours, quarterly
dances and the Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week activities.

The inclusion of the word
"bisexual" in the center's name
reflects the symbolic union of the
gay, lesbian and bisexual commu
nities emphasized by the center.
Bisexual men and women often
complain of feeling alienated from
both the heterosexual and gay
communities because they belong
to neither group exclusively.
"There was never any question
that bisexual would be in the
title," Bao said. "There was over
whelming support for it."
He explained that gay men and
lesbian women sometimes refer to
themselves as bisexual when they
are coming out to "make it
easier," and therefore bisexualism
is occassionally looked upon with
suspicion in the gay community,
he added.
Many GLAS activites will now
be coordinated through the center,
such as film series, study breaks,
a discussion group for those com
ing out, a men's discussion group,
women's happy hours, quarterly
dances and the Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Week activities.

Twenty years ago, the Student
Homophile League of Stanford became
the second known homosexual student
group in the nation. The group's foun
der used a pseudonym to protect his
identity.
Today, the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community has its own University
sponsored community center on the sec
ond floor of the Old Firehouse.
The center is considered a department
of Student Affairs and will receive Uni
versity funding, staff time, equipment,
office space and the resources of the
Office of the Dean of Student Affairs.
The center will serve as an adminis
trative umbrella for the many gay, les
bian and bisexual groups on campus,
including the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
at Stanford and the Stanford Organi
zation for Lesbian and Gay Equality.
"It (the center) will be just like the
Women's Center or El Centro Chicano,"
said Michael Ramsey-Perez, director of
Student Organization Services and
budget officer for the center.
"The security and continuity is very
important, as well as better communi
cation with the administration," Bao
said, noting that the gay, lesbian and
bisexual community now will have
"much greater resources for support,
outreach and education."
The University made the commitment

to recognize and sponsor the new Les
bian, Gay and Bisexual Community Cen
ter after an incident at Otero House
opened the administration's eyes to the
problem of homophobia on campus.
In that incident, Residential Educa
tion evicted a freshman from Otero for
alleged homophobic and belligerent be
havior. Following the eviction, seven
masked members of the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity staged a candlelight protest
vigil that sparked charges of racism.

The Otero incident "refocused atten
tion" on campus homophobia and
heterosexism, graduate student Daniel
Bao said. "Heterosexism" is a term de
scribing the automatic assumption of
heterosexuality.
He estimated that GLAS has been
lobbying for material support from the
University, including guaranteed office
space and staff support, for eight or


Only a few schools have
taken this positive,
groundbreaking step of
officially sponsoring a
gay, lesbian and bisexual
organization. The move is
a bold action by the Uni
versity — GLAS had not
even asked for total spon
sorship until early last
year.

nine years.
The University realized after
the Otero incident that without
some concrete action its support
for the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community might be questioned,
according to Bao.
"Their rhetoric had to be
matched with action," he said.
But Bao also pointed out that
actions more severe than those at
Otero have plagued the gay, les
bian and bisexual community for
years.
Gay, lesbian and bisexual stu
dents have had trash dumped in
front of their rooms. Personal
property has been defaced with
slurs and threats. Roommates
have moved out despite a Univer
sity policy prohibiting such action.
The answering machine at GLAS
has received bomb and death
threats. And Bao added that gay,
lesbian and bisexual students
commonly suffer verbal abuse
from other students.
The Otero incident was promi
nent "not because of the homo
phobic behavior, but because of
the supposedly racist Phi Delt be
havior," said Bao. He said the
original acts targeting a gay res
ident assistant were relegated to
secondary news after attention
focused on the allegedly racist
demonstration.
"It pointed out the relationship
of homophobia to other -isms," he
added.
But Bao was also quick to point
out the merit of the University's
action in funding the center.
"Only a few schools have taken
this positive, groundbreaking
step" of officially sponsoring a
gay, lesbian and bisexual organi
zation, he said.
Calling the move a "bold action"
by the University, Bao explained
that GLAS had not even asked
for total sponsorship until early
last year. At that time, money
was the primary obstacle, not
University opposition to the
group.
"GLAS had been increasing its
requests for support, and we
found our responses weren't suf

ficient," Perez said.
