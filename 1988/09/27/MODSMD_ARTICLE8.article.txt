In a light-hearted faculty
debate, Philosophy Prof. John
Perry and Afro-American Studies
Prof. Kennell Jackson disputed
the virtues of pursuing wealth
before a packed Kresge Audito
rium audience Sunday night.
Participating in one of three
Orientation faculty debates, the
two professors took their positions
on the issue only moments before
the debate began. Moderator C.R.
Douglas, a senior, flipped a coin
to determine the professors
respective sides.
Perry defended the pursuit of
wealth. "I encourage you, while
you're young, get some wealth —
and while you're old, put [your
wealth] to good use," he said.
Objecting to Perry's theme,
Jackson argued, "Once you get
into it you can't come out. It's
like a trap," he said. "You don't
turn 40 and say, 'OK, I'm done
with wealth. I'm going to go

back.'" The students laughed in
agreement with him.
Jackson presented wealth as a
less than noble pursuit. He
claimed that the rich today are a
new breed of money seekers who
do not invest in philanthropy as
much as previous generations did.
"In this decade, American
wealth has produced a group of
Great Gatsby's and pretenders,"
Jackson said.
"The wealthy have acted ag
gressively against other members
of society ... in what I would say
is a rather embarrassing way,"
Jackson said, claiming that the
affluent are squeezing the middle
class and are "indifferent" to the
poor.
Perry noted the ways in which
wealthy individuals have helped
society, citing Senator Leland
Stanford himself.
"Look at what's going on at
Stanford. That's pretty noble.
That's all possible because some
body had a lot of money . . .
Leland Stanford," Perry said.
