## Reagan gives final UN address Focuses on world peace, terrorism and drug trafficking 
### 
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Presi
dent Reagan told the United Nations in
a farewell speech yesterday that this
was "a moment of hope" for peace in
the world and that a new U.S.-Soviet
treaty to sharply reduce nuclear arms
may be concluded next year.
He called for an international war on
drug traffickers, terrorism and hostage
taking, and vowed to maintain U.S. sup
port for an armed insurgency against
the leftist government of Nicaragua.
He said the Sandinistas were pursu
ing "the oldest, most corrupt vice of all
— man's age-old will to power, his lust
to control the lives and steal the
freedoms of others."
But with his presidency nearing an
end, Reagan struck a mostly philosophi

cal stance as he told the 43rd General
Assembly session of 159 nations that
civil wars and foreign occupations were
giving way around the world.
Reagan said the trend was spurred
by "a new era in Soviet-American rela
tions" marked by the continuing with
drawal of the Red Army from Afghan
istan and a treaty last year to abolish
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
He said U.S. and Soviet negotiators
were making steady progress on another
accord to sharply reduce long-range
bombers, missiles and submarines.
While completion of the pact this year
was "highly doubtful," Reagan said, "I
can tell you a year from now (it) is a
possibility, more than a possibility."

On the conventional front, Reagan
said East-West talks to reduce non
nuclear forces, tanks and other mobile
weapons in Europe "will begin soon."
The United States had demanded a
Soviet commitment to give equal atten
tion to human rights. Reagan met last
week in Washington with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
Afterward, U.S. officials said the
Soviets had promised to release 27 ad
ditional political prisoners, to make
changes in their emigration procedures
and to undertake other reforms.
After the speech, Reagan met with
Foreign Ministers Esmat Abdel Meguid
of Egypt and Shimon Peres of Israel
on prospects for peace in the Middle
East.
