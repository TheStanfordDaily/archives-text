The Underlying CAUSE Of These SIDE EFFECTS
— OVERPOPULATION.
THERE IS A REAL SOLUTIONI
Join the campaign to stabilize the population of the U.S.
1
The U.S. has the fastest
growing population of any
country in the industrialized
Western World.
In the next 32 years, today's
2 U.S. population of 244 million
will increase by 53 million to
_ nearly 300 million and con
tinue to grow, if current trends continue
— we will add two and a half times more
people than the rest of the industrialized
western countries combined.
Last year alone, California's
population grew by 600,000
people, that's equal to adding
another San Francisco every
12 months. Texas added the equivalent
of a new Corpus Christi and then some.
Florida burgeoned by another Tampa.

BOX SCORE BY 2020
The U.S. will add enough addi
tional population to create
another:
New York City, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston, Philadel
phia, Detroit, San Diego,
Dallas, San Antonio, Phoe
nix, Baltimore, San Fran
cisco, Indianapolis, San
Jose, Memphis, Washington,
Jacksonville, Milwaukee,
Boston, Columbus, New Or
leans, Cleveland, Denver, El
Paso and Seattle — PLUS the
next 75 lamest cities in the
U.S.I
... if we don't act now to sta
bilize U.S. populationl
Our unchecked population growth means higher education costs, over-burdened
social services, more pollution, more traffic jams, more water shortages and other
adverse effects on the environment.
Overpopulation Is threatening to destroy the carrying capacity of the physical
environment and the social conditions necessary for maintaining our free society In
the American tradition.
Yet, all levels of government — federal, state and local —typically avoid dealing with
rapid population growth. They just try to accommodate the Increased numbers of
people by attempting to mitigate the side effects. Costly, false solutions such as more
freeways or massive water projects nearly always make matters worse or merely
postpone the day of reckoning.
WE MUST ACT NOW TO STABILIZE OUR POPULATION BY DEALING
DIRECTLY WITH POPULATION INCREASE.
WE CANNOT DO EVERYTHING AT ONCEI BUT WE CAN BEGIN BY:
• Reducing Immigration Into the United States
• Supporting programs to reduce unwanted pregnancies
• Controlling growth at the local level
Even though we are all aware of the problems of crowded urban areas and
unplanned, unwanted pregnancies, the fact is Immigration from foreign countries Is
the most important single cause of this excessive growth.
• Over 40% of the United States' and over 50% of California's population
growth is caused by legal and Illegal Immigration from foreign countries.
• In addition to stressing the environment, the population Increase resulting
from immigration cost millions in added social services and other govern
mental outlays.
•Illegal immigration creates unfair Job and wage competition and unemploy
ment for U.S. residents, because illegal Immigrants are easily exploited.
• Excessive immigration contributes to housing shortages, high taxes, home
lessness, urban crowding, and other social problems.
• Failure to adequately control U.S. borders encourages Illicit drug trafficking
and stimulates even more illegal immigration.
RIGHT NOW, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ACT TO REDUCE
LEGAL IMMIGRATION CEILINGS BECAUSE:
In the waning days of its current legislative session, Congress Is considering bills
which would raise legal Immigration levels — some by apparently as much as 60%.
But, we already admit more than 600,000 legal immigrants each year. This is
multiplied by the many relatives who come later. And, adding this to estimated illegal
immigration of half a million a year makes a total of over one million new immigrants
a year. That's already too many I We need less Immigration, not morel
Putting U.S. population on the stabilization track requires passage of new federal
legislation setting an all-inclusive immigration ceiling of 200,000 immigrants
per year. This ceiling would balance the estimated annual number of emigrants who
leave the U.S. to live elsewhere.

Dear:
I am increasingly frustrated by the lack of
real solutions to problems in the United States
caused by too many people — water short
ages, traffic Jams, high housing costs, high
taxes and environmental degradation, among
others. I strongly feel you must act to deal di:
rectly with overpopulation, because attempts
to accommodate overpopulation are nothing
but costly, false solutions. Immigration from
foreign countries Is a major cause of popula
tion Increase in the U.S. Therefore, legal
immigration should be limited by an all-lnclu
slve immigration celling of 200.000 Please
confirm that you support this celling.

The Underlying CAUSE Of These SIDE EFFECTS
— OVERPOPULATION.

Join the campaign to stabilize the population of the U.S.
1
The U.S. has the fastest
growing population of any
country in the industrialized
Western World.
In the next 32 years, today's
2 U.S. population of 244 million
will increase by 53 million to
_ nearly 300 million and con
tinue to grow, if current trends continue
— we will add two and a half times more
people than the rest of the industrialized
western countries combined.
Last year alone, California's
population grew by 600,000
people, that's equal to adding
another San Francisco every
12 months. Texas added the equivalent
of a new Corpus Christi and then some.
Florida burgeoned by another Tampa.

BOX SCORE BY 2020
The U.S. will add enough addi
tional population to create
another:
New York City, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston, Philadel
phia, Detroit, San Diego,
Dallas, San Antonio, Phoe
nix, Baltimore, San Fran
cisco, Indianapolis, San
Jose, Memphis, Washington,
Jacksonville, Milwaukee,
Boston, Columbus, New Or
leans, Cleveland, Denver, El
Paso and Seattle — PLUS the
next 75 lamest cities in the
U.S.I
... if we don't act now to sta
bilize U.S. populationl
Our unchecked population growth means higher education costs, over-burdened
social services, more pollution, more traffic jams, more water shortages and other
adverse effects on the environment.
Overpopulation Is threatening to destroy the carrying capacity of the physical
environment and the social conditions necessary for maintaining our free society In
the American tradition.
Yet, all levels of government — federal, state and local —typically avoid dealing with
rapid population growth. They just try to accommodate the Increased numbers of
people by attempting to mitigate the side effects. Costly, false solutions such as more
freeways or massive water projects nearly always make matters worse or merely
postpone the day of reckoning.
WE MUST ACT NOW TO STABILIZE OUR POPULATION BY DEALING
DIRECTLY WITH POPULATION INCREASE.
WE CANNOT DO EVERYTHING AT ONCEI BUT WE CAN BEGIN BY:
• Reducing Immigration Into the United States
• Supporting programs to reduce unwanted pregnancies
• Controlling growth at the local level
Even though we are all aware of the problems of crowded urban areas and
unplanned, unwanted pregnancies, the fact is Immigration from foreign countries Is
the most important single cause of this excessive growth.
• Over 40% of the United States' and over 50% of California's population
growth is caused by legal and Illegal Immigration from foreign countries.
• In addition to stressing the environment, the population Increase resulting
from immigration cost millions in added social services and other govern
mental outlays.
•Illegal immigration creates unfair Job and wage competition and unemploy
ment for U.S. residents, because illegal Immigrants are easily exploited.
• Excessive immigration contributes to housing shortages, high taxes, home
lessness, urban crowding, and other social problems.
• Failure to adequately control U.S. borders encourages Illicit drug trafficking
and stimulates even more illegal immigration.
RIGHT NOW, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ACT TO REDUCE
LEGAL IMMIGRATION CEILINGS BECAUSE:
In the waning days of its current legislative session, Congress Is considering bills
which would raise legal Immigration levels — some by apparently as much as 60%.
But, we already admit more than 600,000 legal immigrants each year. This is
multiplied by the many relatives who come later. And, adding this to estimated illegal
immigration of half a million a year makes a total of over one million new immigrants
a year. That's already too many I We need less Immigration, not morel
Putting U.S. population on the stabilization track requires passage of new federal
legislation setting an all-inclusive immigration ceiling of 200,000 immigrants
per year. This ceiling would balance the estimated annual number of emigrants who
leave the U.S. to live elsewhere.
