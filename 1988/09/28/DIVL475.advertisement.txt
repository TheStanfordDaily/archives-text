The Tl-95 PROCALC ,Xl Our most powerful, topof-the-line
advanced scientific features 8K RAM and a full range of scientific,
mathematical and statistical functions. It uses redefinable function
keys to provide easy access to 200 + functions with menu-like win
dows and has a flexible file management system to conveniently
store programs and data. The TI-95 offers opnonal accessories such
as Solid State Software TXI carmdges for Mathematics, Statistics, and
Chemical Engineering, and 8K Constant Memory™ cartndge, a
portable printer and a cassette interface.
Tl designed its advanced
scientific calculators to
help cut science and
engineering problems
down to size.
It takes more than an ordinary
calculator to help make an extra
ordinary future scientist or
engineer.
TTs advanced scientific calcula
tors—the TI-60, TI-65 and the
TI-95 TROCALC—were designed
with all the right scientific
mathematical and statistical func
tions you'll need to get ahead in
school and in your career.
These powerful calculators were
carefully created to be easy to use.
They feature large, color-coded
keys and simple keyboard layouts.
This helps you concentrate on real
problem solving, instead of solving
the mysteries of a complex
calculator.
With all the demands your ad
vanced courses place on you, you
need the help of an advanced
scientific calculator from Tl.
