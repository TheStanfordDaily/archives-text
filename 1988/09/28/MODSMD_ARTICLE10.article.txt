## Welfare reform approved Bill passed by joint committee despite objections 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — House
and Senate negotiators over
whelmingly approved a historic,
work-oriented welfare bill yester
day despite bitter objections by
several House members who
labeled it punitive and fraudulent.
The conference committee
adopted their landmark compro
mise 35-8 after conservatives and
moderates had heaped heavy
praise on the plan, designed to
foster independence and parental
responsibility among welfare
recipients.
"A chance like this doesn't come
along very often," said Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-111., chair of the
House Ways and Means Commit
tee. He said the $3.34 billion plan
"demands that welfare recipients
help themselves, but it also pro
vides the training and work
related assistance that is needed
for economic independence."
President Reagan, returning to
the White House from New York,
said he was "very happy" with
the measure, the first major over
haul of the welfare system in 50
years. The remainder of Reagan's
words were drowned out by his

helicopter engine.
House insurgents led by Rep.
Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif.,
chairman of the Education and
Labor Committee, condemned the
bill for imposing a workfare re
quirement on some recipients. "It
is simply a punitive approach for
forcing people off the rolls," said
Hawkins.
Hawkins and others also
charged that the bill fails to assure
high-quality child care for moth
ers who would have to participate
in a work, education and training
program. And they said people
working off their grants in public
work programs could be paid the
equivalent of the minimum wage
regardless of how much those
working next to them were
making.
Rep. William Clay, D-Mich.,
asked for a roll call vote on the
wage provision. His request was
defeated by one vote after Ros
tenkowski said it would unravel
the compromise so painstakingly
worked out all summer.
Most lawmakers agreed with
Rep. Stephen Solarz's assessment.
"On balance, people who are on

public assistance today will be bet
ter off with this legislation than
without it," said the New York
Democrat.
The five-year, $3.34 billion cost
of the compromise bill is modest
but its aims are not. Its architects
say they want to move welfare
recipients from dependence to in
dependence, to instill a sense of
responsibility among parents, to
help them get the skills and serv
ices they need to support their
own families.
A large-scale Job Opportunities
and Basic Skills program offering
job training, education and work
experience is the focal point of the
new plan, which seeks to shift the
emphasis of the welfare system
from cash benefits to work. More
support also would be collected
from non-custodial parents.
The president's chief of staff,
Kenneth Duberstein, told
reporters the White House is
"very encouraged by the provision
on workfare. Our indications . . .
are that in fact it is in fact a
good, strong workfare require
ment, which would meet the pres
ident's test."
