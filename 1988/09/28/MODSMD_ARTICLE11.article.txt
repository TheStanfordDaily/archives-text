BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -
A U.S. military team flew to Laos
yesterday to search plane crash
sites from the Indochina war for
clues about missing American sol
diers, an official said.
In Vietnam, another U.S. team
was working with local officials
on the second day of an unprece
dented investigation to determine
the fates of seven American air
men lost in plane crashes near
the capital of Hanoi.
Thomas Boyd, spokesman
for the U.S. Pacific Command,
said the team that left Bangkok
for eastern Laos will examine an
area around Sepone to prepare
for possible later excavations of
the crash sites.
The team is from the U.S. Joint
Casualty Resolution Center and
Army Central Identification Lab
oratory, Honolulu-based units
seeking to account for 2,393
Americans missing in action from
the war in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia that ended in 1975 with
communist victories in all three
countries.
"They will look at crash sites
and determine what kind of
aircraft, how it crashed, and de
termine the potential for possible
future site excavations," Boyd told
reporters. He said a Marine with
special expertise in plane crashes
was on the team.
