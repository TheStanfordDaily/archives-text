# Hijacker's accomplice accused
## Flight attendant says Hamadi didn't kill Navy diver

FRANKFURT, West Germany
CAP) â€” A flight attendant testify
ing at the murder and air piracy
trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi
said yesterday she believed
Hamadi's accomplice killed a U.S.
Navy diver aboard a hijacked
TWA airliner.
The attendant, Hazel Hesp, said
hijacker Hassan Ezzeddine killed
diver Robert Stethem after the
TWA jet was commandeered June
14, 1985.
The testimony contradicted
that of John Testrake, the plane's
pilot, who told the court he
believed Hamadi was the hijacker
who killed Stethem.

Hesp also testified that Ezzed
dine claimed a friend of his had
carried out the bombing mission
that killed 241 U.S. servicemen
in Beirut in 1983.
Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Mos
lem, has admitted hijacking the
TWA jetliner on the Athens-to-
Rome flight and holding 39 Amer
icans hostage for 17 days. But he
said the other hijacker killed Stet
hem, of Waldorf, Md.
Hesp said Ezzeddine, who is at
large, "seemed to be giving the
orders" during the hijacking.
The 47-year-old Hesp said
"Said" was the name Ezzeddine
used during the hijacking.

Hamadi, she said, called himself
"Castro."
Hesp did not name her home
or nationality, under guidelines
set by the court to protect wit
nesses in the trial, some of whom
have said they feared reprisals.
Her speech had a British accent.
Asked by the court judge if she
knew who killed the 23-year-old
Stethem, Hesp paused, then said:
"Yes. But I did not see the shot,
so it is only my opinion. It would
be my opinion that it would be
Said who shot."
She added: "They were both
terrifying, of course, but of the
two men it is my feeling that Said
was the more vicious."
