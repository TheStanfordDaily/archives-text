Shroud a fake, Turin adviser says
ROME (AP) — Laboratory tests show the
Shroud of Turin was made in the 14th century
and could not be the burial cloth of Christ, the
scientific adviser to the archbishop of Turin said
he learned on Tuesday
Professor Luigi Gonella said he has not yet
seen the official report from the three laboratories
that conducted the carbon-14 dating tests, but
that all the leaks to the press dated it to the
14th century and "somebody let me understand
that the rumors were right."
He refused to identify who had told him about
the results of the tests at Oxford University, the
University of Arizona and the Swiss Federal In
stitute of Technology at the University of Zurich.
The shroud — 14 feet, 3 inches long and 3

feet, 7 inches wide — bears the faint, blood
stained image of a whipped and crucified man.
Some have maintained the herringbone patterned
linen is the burial cloth of Christ, while others
have dismissed it as a clever forgery.
Love Canal residents may return

as a svmbol of environmental disaster.
