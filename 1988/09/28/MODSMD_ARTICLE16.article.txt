For the University and
the USW, it is time to
reach common ground

STOP STABBING one another
in the back and come to an
agreement now.
Negotiators representing the
University and the United Stan
ford Workers have been haggling
and posturing since contract nego
tiations began last July.
This year's negotiations are an
other chapter in the post-modern
drama which has almost become a
Stanford tradition, happening reg
ularly once every three years since
1973.
Press representatives for the
University and for the USW both
claim that they want to reach a
fair agreement as soon as possible.
But negotiators for both sides are
doing several things that suggest
either that their titles are mis
nomers or that they are used to
getting what they want.
For example, the negotiators are
focusing on minor issues, such as
the presence of students at the bar
gaining sessions. Instead of work
ing to minimize differences be
tween the two parties, the negotiat
ing teams are creating new sources
of disagreement.*
It is important to remember that

these students have chosen to join
the USW negotiating team on their
own. Their presence on the USW
side of the table should not be mis
takenly interpreted as a sign that
the entire student body stands
firmly behind the USW.
But when issues such as this one
delay negotiations, no one benefits.
Representatives from both sides
seem to have blinders on. They see
and hear the same things, but they
interpret them in completely dif
ferent ways so that their side comes
out looking great and the other
side comes out looking villainous.
Negotiators seem to be caught
up in the mudslinging spirit of this
year's presidential campaign. Un
fortunately, they fail to realize that
their situation is nothing at all like
the presidential race. If both sides
keep trying to "win," everybody,
especially the students, is going to
lose.
It would be corny to reprint the
Golden Rule in big letters as a
reminder to the negotiators on
both sides. But the negotiations
should be held with a spirit of good
will and compromise.
We already know that the Uni
versity and the USW are different
in many ways and that they have
different interests. But now it is
time to focus on how the two sides
are the same and how they form
an important partnership in a vi
brant community. It is time to seek
a common ground.
