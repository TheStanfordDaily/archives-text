## A free Namibia will isolate Pretoria
### 
THE AGREEMENT reached in
Geneva, Switzerland in August be
tween South Africa, Cuba and An
gola to withdraw South African and
Cuban troops from Angola and create an
independent Namibian state represents a
remarkable success for American foreign
policy interests in southern Africa. How
ever, the ultimate impact of these dra
matic developments will be to create an
effect probably neither South Africa nor
the Reagan Administration had in mind:
greater pressure for black majority rule
in South Africa, the last bastion of white
colonial rule in Africa today.
What makes the Angolan/Namibian
breakthrough so remarkable is not only
how unlikely a peaceful resolution to this
complex conflict seemed just a few years
ago, but also the comprehensive nature
of the newly-concluded agreement. The
agreement, reached as a result of
American-mediated negotiations in,
Geneva, called for an immediate .with
drawal of the South African and Cuban
troops that have been fighting on opposite
sides of the Angolan civil war. The
removal of foreign troops from Angola
does not put an end to the civil war;
however, it does create at least some at
mosphere for a negotiated peace between
the rival factions fighting for control of
the country.

The other and more spectacular aspect
of the agreement reached in Geneva is
South Africa's long overdue concession
to withdraw its troops from and civil
administration over the territory it calls
"South West Africa." The rest of the
world refers to this territory as
"Namibia." There is reason to be skepti
cal of South Africa's commitment to this
part of the agreement. However, if a truly
independent Namibia were to be created,
it would bring an end to the decades-long
bush war in northern Namibia between
black nationalist guerrillas and the South
African occupational forces stationed in
Namibia.
The stage for Namibian independence
'was set when Assistant Secretary of State
for African Affairs Donald McHenry
thought he had secured an agreement
with the South African government in
1978 to grant independence to Namibia
in accordance Nations ..Se
curity Council .Resolution 435. But
Reagan Administration support for a new
tough line in Pretoria linking withdrawal
of Cuban troops from Angola with inde
pendence for Namibia temporarily
scuttled all hopes for South Africa making
good on its promise to withdraw from
Namibia.
The willingness now of Cuba to agree
to this "linkage" of withdrawal of Cuban

troops from Angola to the withdrawal of
South African troops from Angola and
Namibia appears to vindicate South
Africa's and the Untied States' hard-line
position of the last seven years.
However, the most important impact
of this agreement is the strengthening
effect it will have on the black opposi
tion's struggle for power inside South
Africa. The end of South Africa's military
occupation of Namibia is a symbol to the
blacks in South Africa of how a guerrilla
war waged with international support can
succeed eventually against the greater
military power of the Pretoria regime.
The psychological and strategic pres
sures created by Namibian independence
will intensify opposition to the apartheid
regime from within and outside of South
Africa. Independence for Zimbabwe in
1980 helped to set the stage for Namibian
independence to be created at this mo
ment. In turn, freedom in Naniibii sets
the stage for the fulfillment of black detn*
ocratic aspirations in South Africa.
