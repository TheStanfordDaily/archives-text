# Hoover director says he never agreed to retire

### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
Claiming that he never agreed
to step down from his post as
director of the Hoover Institution,
W. Glenn Campbell said yesterday
that he is "finished with being
nice" to the Stanford Board of
Trustees and to University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy.
Campbell's latest statement
marks yet another turnaround in
the ongoing controversy sur
rounding his retirement. In May,
the Board of Trustees instructed
Campbell to step down as director
of Hoover when he turns 65 next
year. Campbell, the 28-year direc
tor of Hoover, has said he wants
to keep his post until he turns 70.
In a jam-packed press confer
ence held in July, an agreement
seemed to have been struck when
Campbell announced that he and
Trustee President James Gaither
had settled on an acceptable re
tirement package. Furthermore,
yesterday Gaither confirmed that
he received a letter from the di
rector's office stating that Camp
bell would step down on Aug. 31,
1989.
Despite these gestures of ac

ceptance, Campbell said his plans
for retirement next August were
never finalized and that he might
remain on the job until he is 70.
Kennedy refused to comment on
Campbell's apparent unwilling
ness to step down.
Gaither, however, said the re
tirement agreement does in fact
exist and that Campbell's com
ments should be taken "with a
grain of salt."
Under the agreement, Campbell
would step down as director but
would continue his fundraising ef
forts, taking on the title "Coun
sellor for Life."
During Campbell's director
ship, Hoover has assessed a $120
million endowment which helps
fund Hoover's 100 scholars and
extensive archives. Under Camp
bell's leadership, Hoover has also
emerged as a premiere think tank
of the Reagan Administration.
Despite Hoover's long-standing
relationship with the University,
Campbell said the current contro
versy surrounding his retirement
has led him to consider severing
Hoover's ties to Stanford. The
current situation is "testing my
patience," he said.
According to Campbell, break

ing ties "would greatly improve
both Stanford and the Hoover In
stitute," and "Stanford would
have to stop using the Hoover
Institute as an excuse for not
cleaning up its Political Science,
English and Philosophy depart
ments."
Earlier this summer, one of
Hoover's most prominent re
search fellows, Milton Friedman,
also suggested splitting ties with
Stanford. In late July, Friedman
said both Hoover and Stanford
would benefit if they severed ties.
Despite the ongoing tension,
Vice President of Public Affairs
Bob Freelen said he is optimistic
that Stanford and Hoover can
coexist â€” especially once the
problems concerning Campbell
are smoothed over and a new di
rector is instated. Freelen added
that conflict is often healthy in
an academic environment. "A good
University has lots of strong per
sonalities and strong views," he
said.
According to Freelen, it is very
unlikely that Stanford could
break ties with Hoover because
of the benefits the University
