## University negotiators want a fair agreement soon 
### 
MANY DAILY READERS may
soon be reading or hearing for
the first time about the con
tract negotiations. The negotiations
have been in progress for the past
several months, between the University
and Local 680, Service Employees
International Union, which represents
technical, maintenance and service
employees at Stanford. Since in the
past the labor negotiations have been
of interest to many in the community,
including students, Stanford's negotiat
ing team thought it might be helpful
to provide some general information
and background.
Collective bargaining is a process
under federal labor law by which an
employer and a union exchange and
discuss contract proposals in a sincere
effort to reach agreement on wages and
other terms and conditions of employ
ment of the employees.

At Stanford, these negotiations have
occurred regularly since 1973. The
University and the union have success
fully negotiated five contracts over the
last 15 years.
The current negotiations began in
July. Sixteen bargaining sessions have
been held. The University had pro
posed to the union that a federal
mediator be brought into negotiations,
a step which has often proved helpful
in the past. The union rejected media
tion. Four weeks ago, on Aug. 31, the
contract expired and negotiations are
now in a critical — and difficult —
phase.
In labor relations — and not just at
Stanford — the dialogue at the
negotiating table, and elsewhere, can
become somewhat heated as negotiat
ing issues become focused and the two
negotiating parties near decision point.
In the coming days, there may be

flyers, letters to the editor and quota
tions in the press in which both the
University and the union express
opinions concerning the issues that are
being discussed at the table.
There was one element — now re
solved — to this year's negotiations
which may be of special interest to
students: Local 680 asked the Univer
sity to agree that student campus
groups designated by the union could
attend actual bargaining sessions as
"neutral" observers. The University,
convinced that this would seriously
harm the direct communications be
tween the two negotiating parties
which are essential to good faith bar
gaining and reaching a contract, did
not agree to open negotiations to
"neutral" observers. The union and the
University agreed that negotiations
would then proceed without such ob
servers.

A dispute arose when Local 680
began to bring representatives of those
campus groups to the sessions contrary
to the agreement. The University and
the union met and the dispute was
resolved when the union advised that
the several students who were ap
pointed by the union — not the stu
dent groups — would serve as negotiat
ing representatives of Local 680, and
not as impartial observers for students
or the community.
The University's goal is to reach an
agreement that is fair for both sides
and workable for the entire Stanford
community. The University is commit
ted to completing negotiations very
soon in a manner consistent with this
goal.
