# Union members not treated as 'family'
## 
### 
THIS YEAR'S class of freshmen
heard a lot this past week about
the importance of "the Stanford
family." It is ironic that even as Stan
ford administrators were welcoming
the freshman class with such warm
words they themselves were refusing to
Jive up to them.
Since July, the University and its
workers have been negotiating a new
labor contract. During the weeks since
negotiations began, the University's
bargaining team has accused the union
of everything from breaking the
ground rules of negotiations to moving
too slowly. Some students undoubtedly
may see such charges as simply a
normal part of labor negotiations. But
in fact, the accusations made by Stan
ford's negotiating team are false. It is
the University which has caused the
difficulties in negotiations by present
ing a set of proposals which would
deprive workers of their fundamental
rights.

For example, the University wants to
force union representatives to first gain
approval from administrators before
speaking with workers, a process which
can sometimes take days. Stanford's
proposals also would permanently bar
union representatives from speaking
with workers on the job for more than
10 minutes, even when such conversa
tions do not interfere with work in any
way. And Stanford wants to have to
pay no more than six months back
wages to any worker found by an
arbitrator to have been fired unfairly,
even though the University itself often
delays arbitration hearings for up to
four years.
Even Stanford itself appears to be
aware of just how unfair its proposals
are, for it sought last month to prevent
students from witnessing the negotia
tions as members of the union's
negotiating team. University represen
tatives were so nervous over the pres
ence of students at the negotiating
table that they walked out of negotia
tions and filed a claim with the Na
tional Labor Relations Board which
would have barred students from learn
ing of the University's proposals

firsthand. Stanford's walkout caused a
two-week delay in negotiations. It
ended only after the NLRB official who
was hearing the case indicated that not
only was he prepared to rule against
the University, but that he would seek
a judicial injunction to force the Uni
versity back to the table. The Univer
sity then decided to resume negotia
tions.
Two weeks are a long time to delay
negotiations over such a seemingly
trivial issue as the presence of stu
dents, especially since the University
knew that students had already served
on the team in previous negotiations,
and since it is the University who
throughout the negotiations has been
accusing the union of moving too
slowly Stanford clearly felt it had
something to hide. Apparently even the
University knows an unfair proposal
when it proposes it.
The unfairness of Stanford's propos
als is only compounded by the Univer
sity's obstructionist, hard-line tactics at
the bargaining table. For example, the
union has requested that Michael
Vartain, the University's chief negotia

tor, contact the dental carrier Delta
Dental and ask it to release informa
tion on the cost of the union's pro
posed dental plan. (Delta Dental refuses
to release such information to the
union without prior authorization from
the university.) But Vartain simply
refuses to make such a call, or even to
sign a letter which authorizes the
release of such information. As a
result, the union remains unable to
present its dental benefits plan to the
University. Vartain, however, continues
to accuse the union of slowing down
the negotiations.
Vartain's behavior only magnifies the
gross unfairness of Stanford's propos
als to the union. Real negotiations in
the spirit of compromise cannot occur
until the University stops trying to
bust the union and to interfere with
union business. We call on the Univer
sity to drop the patronizing and offen
sive attitude it has displayed during
negotiations, and to move forward with
a set of real demands framed in a
spirit of fairness. The idea of a "Stan
ford family" should be something more
than just a tired piece of rhetoric.
