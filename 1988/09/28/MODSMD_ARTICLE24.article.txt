## Economics Prof. Boskin helping to shape Bush agenda 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Having worked intensively to
provide the Bush campaign with
sound economic advice, Econom
ics Prof. Michael Boskin calls
himself an unpaid volunteer. Over
the past year, Boskin, who has
taught at Stanford for 17 years,
has appeared as Bush's economic
spokesperson on ABC's Nightline
and has, to a great extent, shaped
the Republican economic platform
through his regular assistance to
George Bush's senior advisers.
Boskin's name even came up
during Sunday night's presiden
tial debate when the Vicc President
outlined Boskin's economic policy.
Boskin, also the director of the
Center for Economic Policy Re
search here, is a prominent con
servative American economist,
and is a leading expert on the
role of the government in the eco
nomy, especially concerning taxa
tion, government expenditures and
the Social Security System. He is
the author of several articles and
books, including his most recent
— "Reagan and the Economy: The
Successes, Failures and Un
finished Agenda."
He will continue to teach, re
search and advise at Stanford this
year as previously, except he will
not be leading his renowned Eco
nomics 1 class this fall.

During those moments when
Boskin gives his attention to areas
other than economic policy, he said
he enjoys "sports, film, theater
and especially my friends."
He spoke with The Daily earlier
this week, and selections from the
interview are recorded here.
Daily: What have you learned
or been most surprised about in
working on a Presidential cam
paign?
Boskin: I think I have learned
a lot about trying to convey in
formation succinctly and trying
to prioritize information. The big
gest surprise has been the total
lack of professionalism and inad
equate information and manipu
lation of facts by the media. I
don't mind campaign rhetoric and
political hyperbole, but I think
there have been times when refus
ing to print or state facts about
what is going on comes close to
censorship. For example, CBS
television refused to report that
the trade deficit was at its lowest
in four years recently. I am sur
prised at the consistent pattern
of mis-statement of factual eco
nomic information.

Daily: What do you do as Bush's
economic adviser?
Boskin: I do two sets of things.
I try to keep him briefed and up
to-date on events in the economy.

Secondly, I assist the Vice Presi
dent and his senior staff in policy
development.
0
Daily: From your acquaintance,
could you tell me what comes to
your mind about George Bush as
a person?
Boskin: There are three things
that come to mind when I think
of George Bush. One is his sense
of humor and sense of self. He
can poke fun at himself. The sec
ond thing is that he is always
asking perceptive questions about

'I would hope stu
dents hold up the
proposals and
campaign state
ments of both can
didates to the
prism of what they
learn in their eco
nomics courses.'

the economy. When I make a
statement he always wants to
know what the evidence is to sup
port it or about another facet of
it that I have not emphasized.
Third, he is an enjoyable person
to be around, he is very giving,
and he is an easy person to work
with.

Daily: How do you see economic
issues influencing the election?
Boskin: I believe that the con
dition of the economy and percep
tions about the future course of

the economy have a strong influ
ence on voters. It's certainly not
the only issue. Foreign affairs, na
tional security and a variety of
other domestic issues, along with
general perceptions about the can
didates, certainly affect voting as
well.
0
Daily: What major differences
do you see between the candi
dates' approaches to economic
policy?
Boskin: I think Governor Du
kakis believes ever-growing gov
ernment spending, rising taxes
and accelerating regulation of the
private economy are desirable, are
good things. I think George Bush
believes that while there are some
programs that need to be ex
panded, basically a strong eco
nomy is found in a robust,
growing, dynamic, flexible,
private economy, and therefore he
supports a more modest role for
government taxing, spending and
regulating. . . (Dukakis) also has
been fairly naive, in my view,
about how he is going to deal with
Congress on issues of spend
ing. . . . Bush will build on some
of the accomplishments of the past
seven years, rounding off some of
the rougher edges in government
spending. For example, he will fa
vor certain increases in spending
and tax credits, for programs such
as education, day care and AIDS

research. He recognizes govern
ment has a responsibility not only
to provide national defense, but
also to create a safety net. . with
a 'gentler, kinder' practice of more
moderate economic policy, as
Bush has called it. Vice President
Bush has taken a strong stand
against renewed inflation, Gover
nor Dukakis has not.
0
Daily: Why do you suppose this
is?
Boskin: I think Governor Du
kakis is afraid it will sound hollow
given how bad inflation was under
Jimmy Carter. We had inflation
of 12 percent in 1980, and infla
tion has since been cut by two
thirds. I think Dukakis is avoiding
discussing inflation for political
reasons. He does not want to high
light one of the successes of the
Reagan-Bush years.

Daily: Will a tax increase be
necessary to decrease the deficit?
If not, how can the budget be
balanced?
Boskin: The only sure way to
reduce the deficit even further is
to control spending. The deficit
has already been substantially
reduced, but for some reason this
does not get reported very much.
The deficit is now 3.2 percent of
the GNP, which is about half its
