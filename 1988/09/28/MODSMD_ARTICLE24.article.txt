## Economics Prof. Boskin helping to shape Bush agenda 
### Susan McKean Editorial staff 
Having worked intensively to
provide the Bush campaign with
sound economic advice, Econom
ics Prof. Michael Boskin calls
himself an unpaid volunteer. Over
the past year, Boskin, who has
taught at Stanford for 17 years,
has appeared as Bush's economic
spokesperson on ABC's Nightline
and has, to a great extent, shaped
the Republican economic platform
through his regular assistance to
George Bush's senior advisers.
Boskin's name even came up
during Sunday night's presiden
tial debate when the Vicc President
outlined Boskin's economic policy.
Boskin, also the director of the
Center for Economic Policy Re
search here, is a prominent con
servative American economist,
and is a leading expert on the
role of the government in the eco
nomy, especially concerning taxa
tion, government expenditures and
the Social Security System. He is
the author of several articles and
books, including his most recent
— "Reagan and the Economy: The
Successes, Failures and Un
finished Agenda."
He will continue to teach, re
search and advise at Stanford this
year as previously, except he will
not be leading his renowned Eco
nomics 1 class this fall.

During those moments when
Boskin gives his attention to areas
other than economic policy, he said
he enjoys "sports, film, theater
and especially my friends."
He spoke with The Daily earlier
this week, and selections from the
interview are recorded here.
Daily: What have you learned
or been most surprised about in
working on a Presidential cam
paign?
Boskin: I think I have learned
a lot about trying to convey in
formation succinctly and trying
to prioritize information. The big
gest surprise has been the total
lack of professionalism and inad
equate information and manipu
lation of facts by the media. I
don't mind campaign rhetoric and
political hyperbole, but I think
there have been times when refus
ing to print or state facts about
what is going on comes close to
censorship. For example, CBS
television refused to report that
the trade deficit was at its lowest
in four years recently. I am sur
prised at the consistent pattern
of mis-statement of factual eco
nomic information.
0
Daily: What do you do as Bush's
economic adviser?
Boskin: I do two sets of things.
I try to keep him briefed and up
to-date on events in the economy.

Secondly, I assist the Vice Presi
dent and his senior staff in policy
development.
0
Daily: From your acquaintance,
could you tell me what comes to
your mind about George Bush as
a person?
Boskin: There are three things
that come to mind when I think
of George Bush. One is his sense
of humor and sense of self. He
can poke fun at himself. The sec
ond thing is that he is always
asking perceptive questions about

'I would hope stu
dents hold up the
proposals and
campaign state
ments of both can
didates to the
prism of what they
learn in their eco
nomics courses.'
— Michael Boskin

the economy. When I make a
statement he always wants to
know what the evidence is to sup
port it or about another facet of
it that I have not emphasized.
Third, he is an enjoyable person
to be around, he is very giving,
and he is an easy person to work
with.
0
Daily: How do you see economic
issues influencing the election?
Boskin: I believe that the con
dition of the economy and percep
tions about the future course of

the economy have a strong influ
ence on voters. It's certainly not
the only issue. Foreign affairs, na
tional security and a variety of
other domestic issues, along with
general perceptions about the can
didates, certainly affect voting as
well.
0
Daily: What major differences
do you see between the candi
dates' approaches to economic
policy?
Boskin: I think Governor Du
kakis believes ever-growing gov
ernment spending, rising taxes
and accelerating regulation of the
private economy are desirable, are
good things. I think George Bush
believes that while there are some
programs that need to be ex
panded, basically a strong eco
nomy is found in a robust,
growing, dynamic, flexible,
private economy, and therefore he
supports a more modest role for
government taxing, spending and
regulating. . . (Dukakis) also has
been fairly naive, in my view,
about how he is going to deal with
Congress on issues of spend
ing. . . . Bush will build on some
of the accomplishments of the past
seven years, rounding off some of
the rougher edges in government
spending. For example, he will fa
vor certain increases in spending
and tax credits, for programs such
as education, day care and AIDS

research. He recognizes govern
ment has a responsibility not only
to provide national defense, but
also to create a safety net. . with
a 'gentler, kinder' practice of more
moderate economic policy, as
Bush has called it. Vice President
Bush has taken a strong stand
against renewed inflation, Gover
nor Dukakis has not.
0
Daily: Why do you suppose this
is?
Boskin: I think Governor Du
kakis is afraid it will sound hollow
given how bad inflation was under
Jimmy Carter. We had inflation
of 12 percent in 1980, and infla
tion has since been cut by two
thirds. I think Dukakis is avoiding
discussing inflation for political
reasons. He does not want to high
light one of the successes of the
Reagan-Bush years.
0
Daily: Will a tax increase be
necessary to decrease the deficit?
If not, how can the budget be
balanced?
Boskin: The only sure way to
reduce the deficit even further is
to control spending. The deficit
has already been substantially
reduced, but for some reason this
does not get reported very much.
The deficit is now 3.2 percent of
the GNP, which is about half its

peak five years ago. The Congres
sional Budget Office projects it to
drop to 1.8 percent of the GNP
four years from now with no tax
increases and no further control
of spending.
Controlling spending does not
mean cutting spending. Spending
is supposed to grow by a third of
a trillion dollars in the next four
years. If we have it grow a little
less rapidly, that will both reduce
the deficit directly and also take
some pressure oft interest rates,
which will further reduce interest
outlays and hence reduce the def
icit.
If Governor Dukakis is elected
there will undoubtedly be serious

discussion of tax increases. If
George Bush is elected, Congress
might try to raise taxes, but the
Vice President has made it clear
he will oppose that.
0
Daily: What danger do you see
in raising taxes?
Boskin: We do not currently
have a mechanism that will insure
that the bulk of any tax increase
will go to reduce the deficit and
not be spent immediately or in
the following year. Another very
important consideration is that
any precipitous attempt to rapidly
reduce the budget deficit, on
either side of the budget, would
quite likely slow down the eco
nomy and that is a bad thing.
The budget deficit should be
reduced gradually.
0
Daily: What economic issues
should students be paying closest

attention to in the presidential
race?
Boskin: Basically, I would hope
all students, regardless of their
politics, would think through
their views and participate in the
political process. I would hope stu
dents hold up the proposals and
campaign statements of both can
didates to the prism of what they
learn in their economics courses.
0
Daily: What is your evaluation
of the two candidate's proposals
for federal aid for financing col
lege education?
Boskin: Governor Dukakis has
a proposal for loans to students
that will cause a tremendous in
crease in their taxes later in life.
This would be particularly bad for
Stanford students, who in general
are ambitious and are likely to be
well paid when they get out of
Stanford. The tax increase is on
all earnings. In general, Stanford

students would pay back more
than the principle and interest on
the loan. Vice President Bush sup
ports an expansion of the existing
loan program and a college saving
bond proposal to help families
save for education. I think it
makes a lot more sense to encour
age people to save for their edu
cation than to entice them to bor
row and tax them later.
0
Daily: You have been at Stan
ford for 17 years. What mtgor
developments have you observed?
Boskin: The quality of the fac
ulty and the students is even
higher than it was in 1971. The
Economics Department, the Busi
ness School, the Hoover Institu
tion, have all made impressive im
provements that have lead to
Stanford's position as the pre
mier, or one of the two finest,
locales for economics teaching and
research.

Congress on issues of spend
ing. . . . Bush will build on some
of the accomplishments of the past
seven years, rounding off some of
the rougher edges in government
spending. For example, he will fa
vor certain increases in spending
and tax credits, for programs such
as education, day care and AIDS

research. He recognizes govern
ment has a responsibility not only
to provide national defense, but
also to create a safety net. . with
a 'gentler, kinder' practice of more
moderate economic policy, as
Bush has called it. Vice President
Bush has taken a strong stand
against renewed inflation, Gover
nor Dukakis has not.
0
Daily: Why do you suppose this
is?
Boskin: I think Governor Du
kakis is afraid it will sound hollow
given how bad inflation was under
Jimmy Carter. We had inflation
of 12 percent in 1980, and infla
tion has since been cut by two
thirds. I think Dukakis is avoiding
discussing inflation for political
reasons. He does not want to high
light one of the successes of the
Reagan-Bush years.
0
Daily: Will a tax increase be
necessary to decrease the deficit?
If not, how can the budget be
balanced?
Boskin: The only sure way to
reduce the deficit even further is
to control spending. The deficit
has already been substantially
reduced, but for some reason this
does not get reported very much.
The deficit is now 3.2 percent of
the GNP, which is about half its

peak five years ago. The Congres
sional Budget Office projects it to
drop to 1.8 percent of the GNP
four years from now with no tax
increases and no further control
of spending.
Controlling spending does not
mean cutting spending. Spending
is supposed to grow by a third of
a trillion dollars in the next four
years. If we have it grow a little
less rapidly, that will both reduce
the deficit directly and also take
some pressure oft interest rates,
which will further reduce interest
outlays and hence reduce the def
icit.
If Governor Dukakis is elected
there will undoubtedly be serious

discussion of tax increases. If
George Bush is elected, Congress
might try to raise taxes, but the
Vice President has made it clear
he will oppose that.
0
Daily: What danger do you see
in raising taxes?
Boskin: We do not currently
have a mechanism that will insure
that the bulk of any tax increase
will go to reduce the deficit and
not be spent immediately or in
the following year. Another very
important consideration is that
any precipitous attempt to rapidly
reduce the budget deficit, on
either side of the budget, would
quite likely slow down the eco
nomy and that is a bad thing.
The budget deficit should be
reduced gradually.
0
Daily: What economic issues
should students be paying closest

attention to in the presidential
race?
Boskin: Basically, I would hope
all students, regardless of their
politics, would think through
their views and participate in the
political process. I would hope stu
dents hold up the proposals and
campaign statements of both can
didates to the prism of what they
learn in their economics courses.
0
Daily: What is your evaluation
of the two candidate's proposals
for federal aid for financing col
lege education?
Boskin: Governor Dukakis has
a proposal for loans to students
that will cause a tremendous in
crease in their taxes later in life.
This would be particularly bad for
Stanford students, who in general
are ambitious and are likely to be
well paid when they get out of
Stanford. The tax increase is on
all earnings. In general, Stanford

students would pay back more
than the principle and interest on
the loan. Vice President Bush sup
ports an expansion of the existing
loan program and a college saving
bond proposal to help families
save for education. I think it
makes a lot more sense to encour
age people to save for their edu
cation than to entice them to bor
row and tax them later.
0
Daily: You have been at Stan
ford for 17 years. What mtgor
developments have you observed?
Boskin: The quality of the fac
ulty and the students is even
higher than it was in 1971. The
Economics Department, the Busi
ness School, the Hoover Institu
tion, have all made impressive im
provements that have lead to
Stanford's position as the pre
mier, or one of the two finest,
locales for economics teaching and
research.
Having worked intensively to
provide the Bush campaign with
sound economic advice, Econom
ics Prof. Michael Boskin calls
himself an unpaid volunteer. Over
the past year, Boskin, who has
taught at Stanford for 17 years,
has appeared as Bush's economic
spokesperson on ABC's Nightline
and has, to a great extent, shaped
the Republican economic platform
through his regular assistance to
George Bush's senior advisers.
Boskin's name even came up
during Sunday night's presiden
tial debate when the Vicc President
outlined Boskin's economic policy.
Boskin, also the director of the
Center for Economic Policy Re
search here, is a prominent con
servative American economist,
and is a leading expert on the
role of the government in the eco
nomy, especially concerning taxa
tion, government expenditures and
the Social Security System. He is
the author of several articles and
books, including his most recent
— "Reagan and the Economy: The
Successes, Failures and Un
finished Agenda."
He will continue to teach, re
search and advise at Stanford this
year as previously, except he will
not be leading his renowned Eco
nomics 1 class this fall.

During those moments when
Boskin gives his attention to areas
other than economic policy, he said
he enjoys "sports, film, theater
and especially my friends."
He spoke with The Daily earlier
this week, and selections from the
interview are recorded here.
Daily: What have you learned
or been most surprised about in
working on a Presidential cam
paign?
Boskin: I think I have learned
a lot about trying to convey in
formation succinctly and trying
to prioritize information. The big
gest surprise has been the total
lack of professionalism and inad
equate information and manipu
lation of facts by the media. I
don't mind campaign rhetoric and
political hyperbole, but I think
there have been times when refus
ing to print or state facts about
what is going on comes close to
censorship. For example, CBS
television refused to report that
the trade deficit was at its lowest
in four years recently. I am sur
prised at the consistent pattern
of mis-statement of factual eco
nomic information.
0
Daily: What do you do as Bush's
economic adviser?
Boskin: I do two sets of things.
I try to keep him briefed and up
to-date on events in the economy.

Secondly, I assist the Vice Presi
dent and his senior staff in policy
development.
0
Daily: From your acquaintance,
could you tell me what comes to
your mind about George Bush as
a person?
Boskin: There are three things
that come to mind when I think
of George Bush. One is his sense
of humor and sense of self. He
can poke fun at himself. The sec
ond thing is that he is always
asking perceptive questions about

'I would hope stu
dents hold up the
proposals and
campaign state
ments of both can
didates to the
prism of what they
learn in their eco
nomics courses.'
— Michael Boskin

the economy. When I make a
statement he always wants to
know what the evidence is to sup
port it or about another facet of
it that I have not emphasized.
Third, he is an enjoyable person
to be around, he is very giving,
and he is an easy person to work
with.
0
Daily: How do you see economic
issues influencing the election?
Boskin: I believe that the con
dition of the economy and percep
tions about the future course of

the economy have a strong influ
ence on voters. It's certainly not
the only issue. Foreign affairs, na
tional security and a variety of
other domestic issues, along with
general perceptions about the can
didates, certainly affect voting as
well.
0
Daily: What major differences
do you see between the candi
dates' approaches to economic
policy?
Boskin: I think Governor Du
kakis believes ever-growing gov
ernment spending, rising taxes
and accelerating regulation of the
private economy are desirable, are
good things. I think George Bush
believes that while there are some
programs that need to be ex
panded, basically a strong eco
nomy is found in a robust,
growing, dynamic, flexible,
private economy, and therefore he
supports a more modest role for
government taxing, spending and
regulating. . . (Dukakis) also has
been fairly naive, in my view,

ing. . . . Bush will build on some
