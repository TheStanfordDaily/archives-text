# Predicting glory over gloom
## Stanford grad writes of a bright economic future in the U.S.

"America is a race of races," Walt Whitman wrote
in Leaves of Grass. Stanford Business School grad
uate and trans-Pacific business consultant Yoriko
Kishimoto quotes Whitman in the epigraph of her
book she describes as the "West Coast reply" to
predictions of "gloom and doom" for the American
economy.
In the midst of bleak economic forecasts and
projections that the United States is in decline while
Japan and the Pacific Rim are forging far ahead,
"The Third Century: America's Resurgence in the
Asian Era," co-authored with West Coast journalist
and editor Joel Kotkin, foresees positive trends in
America's future.
Kishimoto noted that experts today often explain
a flfecline of American power In terms of a compa
rable increase in Asian economic dominance.
According to Kishimoto, however, if businesses
adopt new economic thinking that incorporates long
ignored elements of American society, the United
States can maintain its economic leadership.
In her analysis, the ethnically diverse population
unique to the United States needs to be cultivated
for American business to keep its competitive edge.

Kishimoto, who was born in Japan and educated
in the United States, said the United States also
has the advantage of sokojikara, a Japanese term
for reserve power. Compared to many countries,
such as Japan she said, the United States enjoys
several natural benefits for economic success : an
abundance of land, natural resources, energy and
the ability to grow most of its own food.
Furthermore, Kishimoto noted, the United States
has a spiritual advantage, which she characterizes
as the "mission" of America as "a great social ex
periment."
Foreign immigration from Europe, notes Kis
himoto, historically provided stimulus for the Amer
ican economy, and the new wave of immigrants
from Asia, Latin America and the Third World holds
the key to an "economic renaissance."
Kishimoto argues that American business must
not neglect the value systems of the non-Western
cultures increasingly represented in the population
and business world.
Although Americans have begun to grapple with
the issue of integrating people of color into the
world of finance, they have not "overcome the hurdle
of looking at Asians as their little yellow brothers,"

Stanford Business School alumna Yoriko Kishimoto expounds on the economic edge the United
States holds over foreign competitors, predicting an economic renaissance rather than an inevitable
decline in the 19905.
she said.
Among those values business
could incorporate are "Confucian
based values" which spawn "com
mitment to long-term relation
ships" in business rather than
short-term profits.
One example the book uses to
illustrate an application of East
ern practices in American busi
ness involves a Silicon Valley com
puter company founded by three
young Asians. When sales
skyrocketed they "resorted to
traditional Chinese methods" of
business organization, calling in
members of their families, friends,
and later recruiting hundreds of
Vietnamese, Chinese and Latinos
who had moved into poorer sec
tions of the county. The company,

AST, today stands as the world's
leading independent producer of
add-on boards for personal com
puters.
Part of Kishimoto's argument,
she notes, harks back to last
year's Western Culture debate.
The debate, she said, involved
the "reforaging of America's new
identity."
"Our minds have been opened
with the (Western Culture)
debate," she said. "The core of
American education can and
should change. There should be a
vision of America as a world na
tion rather than as a white na
tion."
Our ignorance of Asian, Latin
American and Third World cus
toms also leads to an unfounded
suspicion of the expansion of
those areas into the world busi
ness scene, according to Kis
himoto.
