Hurt's so good
112
Calling all freshmen . . . tonight's your
chance to experience one of Stanford's best
loved traditions by checking out the terrific
"Broadcast News" at a special Wednesday
Flicks.
Albert ("Lost in America") Brooks, Holly
("Raising Arizona") Hunter and William ("I'd
like to thank the Academy") Hurt are an
energy-filled love triangle caught up in the
world of network broacasting. Certainly the
best movie of 1987.
Oh yeah, you never know when you might
want to take notes at Flicks, so bring paper.
Pencils optional.
Warm to perform?
Tonight's your last chance to audition for
the Drama department's fall plays, including
"Antigone," "Iliad" and "Commedia." Audi
tions begin at 6 p.m. in the Little Theater at
Memorial Auditorium. No preparation is nec
essary and scripts are available in the Drama
Department Office, room M 144. Call 723-2576

For those who prefer more epic productions,
