## Sigourney Weaver goes ape 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
Stanford alumna Sigourney Weaver
(AB, English, 1972) reaches new heights
in her latest film "Gorillas in the Mist:
The Adventures of Dian Fossey," giving
an inspired performance in the lead role
of this drama based upon the true story
of anthropologist Dian Fossey.
Fossey spent more than a decade of
her life studying the physiology and so
cial behavior of the mountain gorillas
in the Virunga Mountains of Rwanda.
Her pioneering research and her efforts
to protect the endangered mountain
gorillas helped to stimulate interest in
the species and to increase their num
bers.
Because they filmed on location, the
camera crews were able to capture some
picture-book shots of the African coun
tryside which are second only to the
magnificent scenes in the film, "Out of
Africa."
The film moves swiftly from emo
tional peak to emotional peak as Fossey
perseveres against man and nature to
develop a very close relationship with
the mountain gorillas she has come tc
study.
' Weaver's performance is bold and, in
some ways, it calls to memory her role
as the tough Ripley in "Aliens" for which
she received an Oscar nomination.
She remains poised, even during
several close-ups which would have
spelled ruin for actresses of a lower
caliber. Later she allows her character
to evolve, much as one would imagine
that Fossey changed after more than a
decade in the inhospitable mountain en
vironment.
Bryan Brown delivers a sound per
formance as Bob Campbell, the photog
rapher and filmmaker from Kenya
whose films about Fossey alerted the
world to her existence. But it is difficult
for Brown to make a splash since the
film revolves so heavily around
Weaver's character and since her per
formance is so strong.
Though the film is usually very
serious, it never goes cold. The pace is
quick because about 15 years of Fossey's
active life is encapsulated in two hours
and the humor is fresh. The film's fun
niest moments are provided by John
Omirah Miluwi, a member of the Mount
Kenya mountain rescue team who was
recruited to play the role of Dian Fos
sey's tracker and friend, Sembagare.
Like so many of the fine films which
have been made in the past few years,
"Gorillas in the Mist" is more than just
entertainment.
