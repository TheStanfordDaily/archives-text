It's the bottom of the ninth inning.
The bases are loaded with an all-star
cast, including John Cusack and
Charlie Sheen. The home team is
down by three runs and the count
is full, but heavy hitter John Sayles
who has made such films as "The
Return of the Secaucus Seven" and
"Matewan" is at the plate.
Sayles steps up to bat as the
screenwriter and director of "Eight
Men Out," the latest Orion Pictures
release which is based on a 1963 book
by Eliot Asinof. A feeling of excite
ment is in the air as the players are
introduced and the crowd roars. Here
comes the pitch. Sayles swings. He
misses. Sayles has struck out.
But, as is the case with many team
sports, it isn't just Sayles' fault. In

"Eight Men Out," the whole team
loses and so does anyone who spent
six bucks to go see this long, drawn
out, cold movie.
"Eight Men Out" is a film about
the 1919 Chicago White Sox whose

decision to throw the World Series
to the Cincinnati Reds is one of the
biggest black marks on the history
of America's favorite pastime.
Even baseball lovers will lose pa
tience with this film before the

seventh inning stretch. For a
movie about baseball, "Eight
Men Out" has very few sccnes
that are actually filmed on the
diamond. Most of the film is
about the corruption behind the
scenes. Gamblers make proposi
tions to players and players
make propositions to other
players. Then, the movie spends
too much time in the courtroom
showing what happened during
the trial which charged eight of
the players with corruption.
Usually, filmmakers are crit
icized for distorting the plot of
a book that they adapt for the
screen. In this case, the film
makers may have stuck to the
story too closely. In an effort to
get the audience to understand
the complex web of corruption
which led to the "fix," Sayles
employs a whole slew of char
acters without ever developing
any of them.
Unfortunately, the early 20th
century setting of the movie is
done matter-of-factly with little
imagination.
"Eight Men Out" tries to com
municate the players' love for
the game and the ends to which
they were pushed before they
gave in to corruption. The film
is definitely sympathetic to the
players and that's fine. But, be
cause the players' characters are
never really developed, the au

dience has no reason to be on
their side.
The only breath of fresh air
is provided by the child actors
who portray Pee Wee, Bucky and
Scooter. Their wide-eyed scenes
' convey a little bit of what it's
like to dream of baseball star
dom. After all, every young boy
dreams of being a baseball star,
right before they dream of being
a fireman and right after they
dream of joining the circus.
But that breath of fresh air
is stifled by the stale air that

settles over the rest of this film.
"Eight Men Out" cracks into
the lineup of summer baseball
movies which has included the
wonderfully sexy "Bull Dur
ham," and the terribly abomi
nable "Stealing Home." Holly
wood has traditionally had a
tough time handling movies
about our national pastime, and
this is no exception.
No matter how you feel about
baseball, I'd recommend a good
Red Sox game over "Eight Men
Out" any day.
