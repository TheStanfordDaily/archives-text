# Union withdraws most recent contract proposals
## 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
In another day of rocky negotiations,
yesterday the United Stanford Workers
withdrew its most recent contract pro
posal, surprising University negotiators.
Submitted Sunday, the retracted pro
posal was a "substantial movement" on
the part of the union because concessions
concerning grievance procedures,
workers' benefits and the employment of
nonunion members were made, according
to USW lawyer Mary Mocine. However,
a lack of concessions in the University's
proposal triggered the union into
withdrawing their own proposal, she said.
"Their lack of response made it impos
sible for us to leave our proposal on the
table," Mocine said.
University lawyer Michael Vartain was
surprised and disappointed by the union's
retraction of the proposal. Calling the
session "dramatic," Vartain said the un

ion's withdrawal of their recent proposal
was a "bizarre tactic" which had never
been done before, to his knowledge, in
USW negotiation history.
Vartain added that the withdrawal
"does nothing for good faith bargaining"

Their lack of response

and sets the negotiations back. "We
should be getting closer and closer to
gether, not engaging in tactics where we
are getting farther apart," Vartain said.
The University, however, did not
retract its proposal. "When Stanford

makes a proposal, we stand behind it,"
Vartain said.
Union employees have been working
without a contract since the previous
three-year contract expired Aug. 31. The
USW represents 1,300 technical, service
and maintenance workers around
campus, the Stanford Medical Center and
the Stanford Linear Accelerator.
At the end of yesterday's session, the
University presented a proposal on es
tablishing an affirmitive action commit
tee. But this proposal was not enough to
stop the union from following through
with its retraction. According to the
USW, there were four major points of
contention: the contracting out of work
to non-union organizations, wage in
creases, benefits and the grievance pro
cedure.
On Monday, the USW filed an unfair
labor practice charge against the Univer
sity with the National Labor Relations
Board for allegedly refusing to allow the

union access to information about the
dental plan.
Vartain said he has not seen the specific
charges yet and therefore could not com
ment on them.
Furthermore, the University denies the

allegations that it has withheld informa
tion from the union. "Stanford has pro
vided the necessary information for them
to understand their own proposals," Var
tain said. Many of the statistics the union
is looking for are public information and

can be obtained by the union, according
to Vartain.
But the union says that while infor
mation on the costs of the current
workers' dental plan may be public, the
information on costs to projected changes
in the plan are not public. Mocine added
that the information can only be released
from Delta Dental with University au
thorization.
In order to facilitate the negotiations,
the University proposed on Sept. 18 to
bring in a federal mediator, arguing that
the union has not made a comprehensive
proposal since Sept. 9 and mediation
would "break that log-jam."
The union rejected the proposal, ar
guing that a mediator should only be
brought in when the two parties have
reached an impasse.
Mocine added that a mediator would
place the two parties in separate rooms
and transport information back and
forth, doubling negotiation time.
