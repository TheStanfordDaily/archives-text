## Crossing the 'Thin Blue Line' 
### Eric Grunwald Staff writer 
"The Thin Blue Line" is one of
the most unique films in a long
time, chronicling Detective
turned-director Errol Morris' in
vestigation into the 1976 murder
of a Dallas police officer, a case
which he believes ended in a
wrong verdict and grave injustice.
Morris telle the story through
interviews with most of the people

Aguarius

involved in the original case and
through staged recreations of the
events on the night of Nov. 28,
1976.
On that night, officer Robert
Wood and his partner pulled over
a car simply to ask the driver to
turn on his lights; he even left
his ticket book on the seat as he
got out. As he approached the
driver's window, Wood was shot
five times and killed.
Director Morris is very clever
in his compilation and presenta
tion of the evidence. First he lays
out the facts largely as the public
saw them.
But as you are being lulled by

all the concurring testimony, Mor
ris suddenly slips in new tes
timony which contrasts sharply
with the old. He builds his case
this way throughout the film,
laying out evidence as the jury
saw it and then presenting new
convincing testimony which to
tally repudiates it.

And it's all the more frightening
because it actually happened.
At an hour and 40 minutes the
film is about 25 minutes too long,
but it is still far better fare than
the generally mediocre mass of
high-impact movies being tossed
out by the studios these
days.
