## Sizzling spikers shatter San Jose streak 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE — The end was very
close, but the match was not. Nul
lifying the San Jose State wom
en's volleyball team's shot at the
school record books, the Stanford
offense kicked into high gear and
annihilated the Spartans 15-8, 15-
8, 17-15 in a brisk one-and-a-half
hour contest.
The Cardinal, ranked third in
the nation and riding sky-high in
the Pacific 10 Conference, im
proved its record to 9-1 with the
non-league win. The Spartans suf
fered their first defeat of the year,
falling to 11-1 and failing to break
the SJSU school record for con
secutive wins.
"San Jose has always been kind
of a tough team to play for us,
and we always find a way usually
to win, but it is not always
pretty," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "I thought for most
of the time we played fairly well.
There were a couple of stranger
points in the first two games that
we probably shouldn't have had,
and then we came out with the
2-0 lead kind of flat."
At the outset, however, it was
the Spartans that came out flat.
The Cardinal raced out to a rapid
4-0 lead with some quick hitting
and blocking, but SJSU bounced
back after a side-out battle to
record six unanswered points and
appeared to momentarily have
seized the momentum.
Once the score reached 8-8 and
junior setter Lara Asper took the
service line, the first game quickly
became a memory. Behind Asper's
serve and junior Jennifer Chaf
fee's strong hitting, Stanford
reeled off eight consecutive points
and claimed the game.
Game two was much the same,
with Chaffee and freshman Kris
tin Klein hitting well from the
outside. After heading out to a
quick 10-3 lead, the Stanford
spikers never looked back.

"They have some really small
blockers on the left side, so I could
go after them and hit off their
hands," Chaffee said. "The line
was open all night long and I hit
that for a while, and when they
started reaching out to the edge
I hit cross-court more. It was a
pretty good set-up, and La (Asper)
and (sophomore) Karen (Ander
son) were giving me some
awesome sets oack there."
The third game brought about
some serious changes in the
match. Stanford scored the first
point of the game and continued
to a 3-1 lead, but a revived SJSU
squad bounced back to claim a
7-4 advantage.
At about this precarious point,
Shaw opted for a new signal caller,
substituting a seemingly tired
Asper with Anderson. While not
as sizeable a presence at the net,
the sophomore spelled the start
ing setter splendidly and held the
Cardinal offense together.
"When Karen came off the
bench to set, she did a really good
job," Chaffee said. "She hasn't
done that all season and it was
completely unexpected, but she
just came out and did the job."
"Something we've got to be able
to do is put Karen in and keep
the game going," Shaw said. "She
did a really nice job."
With some rest, Asper came
back in and guided the Cardinal
to a close win. Stanford sprung
back from a 13-9 deficit to even
the score in just eight plays. Spar
tan sophomore Betsy Walsh,
SJSU's leading hitter in the
match, beat out Stanford senior
Laura Olesen one-on-one to take
the ball from the Cardinal, and a
smart shot by senior middle
blocker Kari Roberson gave the
Spartans a game-point service op
portunity.
Chaffee warded off game point
with a clutch kill, placing the ball
back in Stanford's hands. After a

quick side-out exchange, a hitting
orror by SJSU sophomore Mary
Ann Wagner tied the score at 14-
14, turning the game into a tense
overscore contest.
A clumsy four hits on the Spar
tan side of the net gave Stanford
a 15-14 lead and the chance to
close the match, but an inoppor
tune lift call and a slick placement
shot re-tied the score. Stanford
senior Amy Hayes responded with
a back-court kill, Olesen followed
with a clean block and Klein
closed with a kill off of a Spartan
defender to give the Cardinal a
squeaky 17-15 game three win
that was too close for the coaches'
comfort.
"We weren't doing the job in a
lot of areas in the third game,"

Shaw reflected, "but the good part
about that is that we found a way
to win the game. A lot of people
got in the game and kept us in it."
"I'm really glad we pulled it out
in the end, because I didn't want
to stay for another fourth or fifth,
because they would have picked
it up a lot," Chaffee said. "They
put a lot of people out on the
floor and they came at us pretty
well."
Ultimately, it may have been
these numbers that hurt the Spar
tans. SJSU Coach Dick Mont
gomery (brother of Stanford bas
ketball Coach Mike Montgomery)
acted more like a baseball mana
ger than volleyball coach, sub
stituting out players and never
returning them to action. By the
time game three came around,
several members of the Spartans'
starting lineup found themselves
benched for the duration.
For the Cardinal, however, stra
tegic returns brought success.

Asper played solid ball after her
absence, and Chaffee came out
with a new spark after a brief
replacement by classmate Jessica
Benton.
But the most effective repeat
substitution was between sopho
more Tracy Hughes and freshman
Amy Cooper. Starting the first
game and spelling Cooper in the
back row throughout the match,
Hughes came up with seven key
digs.
At the net, Cooper played some
of Stanford's best ball of the year.
Making nary an error, the middle
blocker recorded 11 kills in 15
attempts for a blistering .733 hit
ting percentage, over twice as good
as the Spartans' strongest spiker.
Cooper also garnered two block
solos and two assists to complete
the impressive package.
"Cooper had her best night hit
ting probably this year," Shaw
noted.
