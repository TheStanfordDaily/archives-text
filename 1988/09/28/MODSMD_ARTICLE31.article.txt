## Sizzling spikers shatter San Jose streak 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
SAN JOSE — The end was very
close, but the match was not. Nul
lifying the San Jose State wom
en's volleyball team's shot at the
school record books, the Stanford
offense kicked into high gear and
annihilated the Spartans 15-8, 15-
8, 17-15 in a brisk one-and-a-half
hour contest.
The Cardinal, ranked third in
the nation and riding sky-high in
the Pacific 10 Conference, im
proved its record to 9-1 with the
non-league win. The Spartans suf
fered their first defeat of the year,
falling to 11-1 and failing to break
the SJSU school record for con
secutive wins.
"San Jose has always been kind
of a tough team to play for us,
and we always find a way usually
to win, but it is not always
pretty," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "I thought for most
of the time we played fairly well.
There were a couple of stranger
points in the first two games that
we probably shouldn't have had,
and then we came out with the
2-0 lead kind of flat."
At the outset, however, it was
the Spartans that came out flat.
The Cardinal raced out to a rapid
4-0 lead with some quick hitting
and blocking, but SJSU bounced
back after a side-out battle to
record six unanswered points and
appeared to momentarily have
seized the momentum.
Once the score reached 8-8 and
junior setter Lara Asper took the
service line, the first game quickly
became a memory. Behind Asper's
serve and junior Jennifer Chaf
fee's strong hitting, Stanford
reeled off eight consecutive points
and claimed the game.
Game two was much the same,
with Chaffee and freshman Kris
tin Klein hitting well from the
outside. After heading out to a
quick 10-3 lead, the Stanford
spikers never looked back.

"They have some really small
blockers on the left side, so I could
go after them and hit off their
hands," Chaffee said. "The line
was open all night long and I hit
that for a while, and when they
started reaching out to the edge
I hit cross-court more. It was a
pretty good set-up, and La (Asper)
and (sophomore) Karen (Ander
son) were giving me some
awesome sets oack there."
The third game brought about
some serious changes in the
match. Stanford scored the first
point of the game and continued
to a 3-1 lead, but a revived SJSU
squad bounced back to claim a
7-4 advantage.
At about this precarious point,
Shaw opted for a new signal caller,
substituting a seemingly tired
Asper with Anderson. While not
as sizeable a presence at the net,
the sophomore spelled the start
ing setter splendidly and held the
Cardinal offense together.
"When Karen came off the
bench to set, she did a really good
job," Chaffee said. "She hasn't
done that all season and it was
completely unexpected, but she
just came out and did the job."
"Something we've got to be able
to do is put Karen in and keep
the game going," Shaw said. "She
did a really nice job."
With some rest, Asper came
back in and guided the Cardinal
to a close win. Stanford sprung
back from a 13-9 deficit to even
the score in just eight plays. Spar
tan sophomore Betsy Walsh,
SJSU's leading hitter in the
match, beat out Stanford senior
Laura Olesen one-on-one to take
the ball from the Cardinal, and a
smart shot by senior middle
blocker Kari Roberson gave the
Spartans a game-point service op
portunity.
Chaffee warded off game point
with a clutch kill, placing the ball
back in Stanford's hands. After a
