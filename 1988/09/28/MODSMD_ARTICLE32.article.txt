SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
â€” The U.S. basketball team
lost the second game in its
glorious Olympic history Wed
nesday, bowing in a mad
scramble to the Soviets, 82-76,
in a grudge match that brewed
for 16 years and three seconds.
Steve Lewis led a U.S. sweep
of the 400 meters, just one
hundredth of a second off a
20-year-old Olympic record,
and three more U.S. boxers ad
vanced to the semifinals, as
sured of at least a bronze
medal.
Despite being awarded the
gold medal in the 100-meter
dash due to the disqualification
of Ben Johnson, Carl Lewis
failed in his bid to repeat as a
quadruple gold medalist. He
was defeated in the 200 by fel
low American Joe DeLoach.
DeLoach set an Olympic
record of 19.75 seconds. Lewis
was second at 19.79.
Robson Silva of Brazil won
the bronze with a time of 20.04.
As it did 16 years ago in
Munich, this U.S.-Soviet
matchup came down to the
final few seconds. This one did
not end in controversy, just a
loss, and America no longer can
claim dominance of interna
tional amateur basketball.
The Soviets led 51-37 with
18:13 to play, but the Ameri
cans trimmed it to 79-76 with
just three seconds left. After a
Soviet free throw and a mad
scramble for a loose ball that
wound up in Soviet hands, the
Americans were hanging their
heads on the bench while the
Soviets exchanged high-fives.
Danny Manning, most valu
able player of Kansas' national
collegiate championship team
last spring, didn't score a single
point, and David Robinson led
the Americans with 19 points
and 12 rebounds.
Rimas Kourtinaitis led the
Soviets with 28 points, while
center Arvidas Sabonis, a first
round draft choice of the NBA's
Portland Trail Blazers, had 13
points and 13 rebounds.
The United States went into
its semifinal game against the
Soviets trying to avenge the
only previous loss on its 85-1
Olympic record, but now the
best the Americans can do is
a bronze medal while the
Soviets go for gold.

In 1972 at Munich, America
met the Soviet Union for the
gold medal, and, after the final
three seconds were played
twice because of referee error
and a scoreboard malfunction,
the Soviets won 51-50.
"Every day Russian people
and Russian journalists talk
about historic three seconds in
Munich," said Alexander
Gomelsky, who is coaching his
sixth Olympics for the Soviets.
"This is a good story, and I
like it to be seen the way here."
The 19-year-old Steve Lewis
won the 400-meter gold in
43.87 seconds, and favored
teammate Butch Reynolds, who
holds the world record of 43.29,
was second in 43.93. Another
American, Danny Everett, took
the bronze in 44.09. Lewis'
time was just .01 seconds off
the Olympic mark by Lee
Evans of the United States in
Mexico City in 1968.
The United States still has
eight of its 12 boxers still in
action, including six in the
semifinals. Those advancing
Wednesday morning were Ken
nedy McKinney of Killeen,
Texas, Kenneth Gould of Rock
ford, 111., and Ray Mercer of
Jacksonville, Fla.
Debra Flintoff-King of
Australia edged Tatiana
Ledovskaya of the Soviet Un
ion by one one-hundredth of a
second in the women's 400-
meter hurdles, and Ellen
Fieldler of East Germany took
the bronze.
Florence Griffith-Joyner, al
ready a gold medalist at 100
meters, ran the fastest quali
fying heat of the morning in
the 200 meters in 22.51.
One of the favorites in the
decathlon, Jurgen Hingsen of
West Germany, was disquali
fied from the 100 meters por
tion for three false starts, ef
fectively eliminating him from
contention. Hingsen's appeal
was turned down.
Also on Wednesday, runner
Johnny Gray became the third
U.S. athlete detained by police
after he was charged with un
ruly behavior for kicking a cab.
Gray told police the cab almost
hit him and two unidentified
companions. Police said that
after arguing with the driver,
Gray kicked the cab.
