# Heroes and goats of the XXIV Olympiad

I was dumbfounded.
Carl Lewis ran the best 100 meters of
his life and lost to Ben Johnson by more
than one-tenth of a second.
As I repeated the news to people again and
again, somewhere in my mind I knew it
couldn't be real.
Ben Johnson simply couldn't be that good.
And, as everyone knows, he isn't.
Neither are Angel Myers and the Bulgarian
weightlifting team.
Sure, it seems obvious now. The muscular
build and the puffiness in his face are telltale
signs of steroid use. Hindsight, of course, is
20/20.

But Ben Johnson . . . the world's fastest
human ... I still don't believe it.
When Johnson ran a then-world record 9.83
in the 100 at last year's World Championships,
many suspected he had found a way to leave
the starting blocks a split-second early without
generating a false start.
The question on my mind is: If steroids
now, why not steroids then? The steroid
Johnson took, stanozolol, was undetectable
until 1986. It is surely possible that his test
in Rome last year failed to turn up evidence
of what he was taking.
In addition, the results of his test at the
Olympics suggest that he had taken the drug
some time ago, for a period of time.
While there is no proof, the circumstantial
evidence is substantial. As far as I'm concerned
the world record in the 100 meters should be
listed as follows: Carl Lewis, United States,
9.92 seconds, Olympic Games, Seoul, South
Korea, Saturday, Sept. 24, 1988.
That is the fastest time one can say was
with certainty was performed by an athlete
who was aided neither by the wind, nor by
performance-enhancing drugs.
Fortunately, despite the fiascoes in
boxing, women's gymnastics and the
like, the Olympics have provided their
usual share of great stories.
In swimming, two American heroes have
been created — one who is gigantic and one
who is diminutive. Both, however, have earned
a permanent place in the hearts of many.
The first is Matt Biondi, the 6-foot-6 grad
uate from that mediocre school somewhat
north and east of here.
But seriously, beginning with the day he
competed in his final swim meet at Cal, I
began to think of Biondi as a the Great Amer
ican Hope. No longer did I hear his name
and think "Weenie!"
And even though Biondi didn't match Mark
Spitz' seven-gold-medal performance, his five
golds, one silver and one bronze may be more
impressive.

The reason is the level of competition has
increased greatly since 1972. There are far
more nations competing in swimming at the
world-class level. Besides, Biondi was one bad
decision to kick instead of stroke and one
hundredth of a second away from six golds
and a bronze.
Almost as amazing as his feat was his sub
sequent modesty. Reports were waiting for
him to proclaim himself "Superman" and talk
about the money he would make from en
dorsements like a Bill Johnson, the gold
medalist in the downhill in the '84 Winter
Games, a Ben Johnson or even, and I hate
to say it because I'm a huge fan of his, a
Carl Lewis might do.
Yet Biondi retained his humility.
He wasn't overly impressed with himself;
he was more amazed that he could do it. He
wasn't certain he was interested in doing any
endorsements at all; he wanted to do more
backpacking. He didn't think his life would
be changed; he wanted to retire from swim
ming and play more water polo.
Janet Evans is a mere 105 pounds and
yet she is the proud owner of three Olym
pic gold medals.
Her story gives hope to millions of
youngsters around the country who were told
they're too small to make it in sports. Her
"Aw shucks!" attitude about setting world
records is even more refreshing than Biondi's.
It's easy to become enamored with someone
who is as genuine as Janet Evans and who
also happens to be a super-athlete.
Florence Griffith-Joyner seems to have an
appeal similar to the two swimmers'.
She breaks the world record in the 100
three or four times each week, clearly estab
lishing herself as the fastest woman in the
world, yet she doesn't run around telling
everyone how wonderful she is.
True, she believes she can run faster and
that she's not yet done smashing her own
record. But then, she's hardly being immodest.
She seems to merely be displaying the com
petitive desire that got her this far in the
first place.
It's safe to say I'll be a member of the
Biondi, Evans and Griffith-Joyner fan clubs
for a long time. But then, I'm easy to please.
Remember, I forgave Carl Lewis for his ego
during the '84 Games. I've been rooting for
him ever since.
And, even though the circumstances by
which he got it are unfortunate, I'm very glad
Carl Lewis has another gold medal in the 100
to replace the one he placed in his father's
casket.
I would be remiss if I neglected to mention
the great Greg Louganis.
Louganis is the Wayne Gretzy and Pablo
Picasso of diving — all rolled in one. That is
to say, not only is he the best ever statistically;
he is also the best ever artistically.
Louganis seems to dive in slow motion and
without effort. He now has an unprecedented
four Olympic golds in diving. How appropriate
that he should get the fourth on perhaps the
most magnificent single dive of his career.
Needing near-perfection to win the gold,
Louganis, as he has done time and again,
came up with the dive in the clutch to eke
out a narrow win.
That is greatness.

Alas, all has not been great thus far in the
Games. Topping my list of complaints (only
because I noticed it first, not because it was
the worst thing in the Games) is how incred
ibly dull and irrelevant the tennis competition
is.
While it may have been long overdue to
restore tennis as an Olympic event, perhaps
we should have waited even longer.
The players seem spiritless and many of
the world's top players were so uninterested
they stayed home.
Watching Steffi Graf win the Grand Slam
was a thrill. Watching Brad Gilbert knock off
some guy I never heard off who was ranked
in the 400s is simply dull.
The South Koreans also deserve some
jeers for being less-than-wonderful
hosts.
If the Olympics were a restaurant, the well
documented boxing fiasco would leave many
patrons with an "I'll never eat here again"
feeling. Not only did a coach try to assault
an official, South Korea's massive security
force should have been jailed for aiding and
abetting the felon.
Couple that with a highly questionable de
cision that denied Juan Moreno a gold medal
in Tae Kwon Do and an insufficient shuttle
service that contributed to Anthony
Hembrick's failure to make his first fight and
you have three strikes.
Add some more jeers for the East German
team. When they invoked an obscure, pointless
rule in the team gymnastics competition
against the U.S. team they did so because
they doubted their ability to finish ahead of
the Americans.
The U.S. team suffered a .5-point deduction
and ended up .3 points short of a bronze
medal. Ouch!
No Olympics would be complete without
some stunning upsets and there have
been many.
Edwin Moses' bronze in the 400-meter
hurdles, Said Aouita's bronze in the 800-meter
run and David Berkoffs silver in the 100-
meter backstroke come quickly to mind,
though there are many others.
Moses said he will continue competing and
I say more power to him. He will win more
races and continue to be at or near the top
of his event.
But ever since The Streak came to an end,
the rest of the world has been slowly catching
up to Moses. He is surely one of the great
track athletes of all time and somehow I hoped
he'd always be the best.
All in all, the Games have been quite a
show. Nowhere near as spectacular as the Los
Angeles Games four years ago, but infinitely
more interesting to Americans than the Mos
cow Games we didn't attend.
For the first time in a dozen years, nearly
all the world's top athletes (notable exceptions
included the Cuban boxers and baseball
players) have come together to set most of
their political differences aside and compete.
It's terrific and kind of makes you wish the
Olympics would come around a little more
often.
