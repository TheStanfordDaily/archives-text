# Johnson's drug use stuns, angers Olympians

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —
The pressure to win an Olympic
medal is so intense and the mon
etary rewards so great, the use
of performance-enhancing drugs
is inevitable — even in the Olym
pics — coaches and athletes in
Seoul say.
The International Olympic
Committee announced Tuesday
that it stripped Ben Johnson of
his world record-setting gold
medal because the Canadian
sprinter tested positive for
stanozolol, a banned anabolic
steroid. Gone too are Johnson's
9.79-second world record for 100
meters and Johnson, who flew to
New York shortly after the lOC's
announcement.
Johnson's case triggered shock
and disbelief among the athletes,
but also resignation that money
often outweighs medals in signif
icance at the world's greatest
sports show.
"So much sponsors' money is
involved," said Drew Harrison, a
Canadian rowing coach. "So much
depends on getting the highest

performance, that a small percent
age of people will always try and
hope to get away with it. Money
always talks." 1
The money involved comes from
endorsing products and making
personal appearances. Johnson
holds several endorsement con
tracts, one a $2 million, five-year
agreement with an Italian
sportswear company. He and
American Carl Lewis, who
finished second in the 100 but
was elevated to the gold medal
Bpot after the drug test, report
edly were paid $250,000 to race
each other in Switzerland last
month.
The Johnson case also brought
admission from athletes that the
use of steroids — the muscle
building drugs first associated
with the East Bloc — were no
longer the exclusive property of
Communist countries.
"Everybody uses drugs, give me
a break," said Horace Dove-Edwin
of Sierra Leone, who ran in the
100-meter heats. "They have got
everything, human blood hor

mones, all kinds of drugs. Steroids
is nothing anymore, it is just an
itty bitty drug. You can get it
anywhere."
Carl Lewis, the American
sprinter whose dream of duplicat
ing his four gold medals at Los
Angeles four years ago was sud
denly renewed by Johnson's dis
qualification, declined" to condemn
his fierce rival.

"I feel sorry for Ben and for
the Canadian people," Lewis said.
"Ben is a great competitor and I
hope he is able to straighten out
his life and return to competi
tion."
Johnson denied having

knowingly taken steroids, sug
gesting they were in his system
because someone had spiked
fluids he drank on race day. The
lOC medical commission dis
counted that argument, saying the
tests indicated the steroids had
been taken over a period of time.
Athletes and coaches also
agreed the Johnson case points
out the campaign against drug use
is working.
. "It's a shame to see anyone get
caught for drugs, but drugs have
no place in sports," said Robert
Cannon, a triple jumper from Buf
falo, N.Y. "I guess this explains
the system is working."
Among Johnson's former team
mates, the feelings ranged from
embarrassment to bitterness.
"I'm curious to know why he
was stupid enough to do that,"
said Canadian swimmer Gary
Vandermeulen.
"It's a big blast for the sports
world, eh?" said fencer Stephen
Angers. "Our national hero is not
a hero anymore."
