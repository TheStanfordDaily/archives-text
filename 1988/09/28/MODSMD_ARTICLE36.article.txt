# Jewish students hosted by West German government in exchange program
## 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
On the eastern side of the Ber
lin Wall lies the burned-out shell
of what was once a 3,000-seat
synagogue in Germany. Forty
three years after the end of World
War II and the division of Ger
many, the East German govern
ment has begun to rebuild the
3,000-seat synagogue. Today, less
than 400 Jews remain in East
Berlin..
Eighteen Stanford students,
along with Jocelyn Reisman, pro
gram director of Hillel, German
Professor Walter Lohnes and two
students from Arizona State Uni
versity, visited the synagogue this
August, under the "Bridge of Un
derstanding" program sponsored
by the West German government
through Stanford Hillel.
In its second year, the program
encourages young American Jews
to better understand modern Ger
many's relationship with its past
through a three-week visit to the
country.
The paradox of the beauty and

history of a country rich in a
Jewish past, yet which sadly lacks
in a Jewish present, repeatedly
confronted the travellers.
"One of the most important
things was the way we formed
personal relationships with young
Germans," noted Leila Wice, a
sophomore participant. "I think it
was as important to them that
we were there as it was for us."
Trip participant Joe Dorbin
agreed that it was important for
the students to see Germans as
individuals. "In the past when [my
family] talked about the
Holocaust, they tended to charac
terize the German people collec
tively as a group of murderers,"
he explained.
The students stayed for 18 days
with host families in Bonn, the
country's capital, and visited Ber
lin, Hamburg, Mainz, Worms,
Speyer and Cologne. While
touring, they met with the mayor
of Bonn, the former President of
West Germany, Kail Carstens, the
Minister of State in the Federal
Chancellory, and Jitzhak Ben Ari,
the Israeli ambassador to West

Germany. Students also had a
chance to meet college and high
school students, journalists, sol
diers and educators.
According to the students, one
theme arose most often among
the Germans: remembrance. As
Jewish children, the students were
taught to remember the six mil
lion murdered in the Holocaust
â€” to never forget. German
children learn the same idea.
For the most part, the Germans
the students met said they felt a
deep sense of shame for their na
tion's history. "Most of the Ger
mans we talked to genuinely
seemed sorry and are trying to
ensure that it doesn't happen
again," Dobrin said in retrospect.
The students were quick to
point out that they met only an
educated section of the German
society. "It is hard for me to place
all of my faith in those people,"
said Bonnie Rosenberg, a sopho
more participant.
Many students said they were
shocked at how few Jews remain
in the country. Almost every Ger
man they met had never formally

met a Jewish person. "We read a
few times in books that in some
ways Hitler did succeed. When
you go there, it really hits you
and you start to understand what
genocide means," Wice said.
The students spent one day in
East Berlin as guests of the East
German League for International
Friendship. The main tourist
street of the city is fully restored,
except for two blocks in either
direction off the street. There are
still colorless, bombed-out shells
from the 1940s and buildings full
of machine gun holes.
The East Germans told the stu
dents they feel no responbility for
anything that happened during
World War 11. They consider
themselves to be as much the vic
tims as the Jews were since Hitler
persecuted Communists as well.
"That makes me very angry,"
Rosenberg said. "I see no differ
ence between East Germany turn
ing full circle [from fascism] to
communism as West Germany
turning to democracy."

One of the most emotional
points of the trip was a visit to
the Belsen Memorial on the site
of what was once the Bergen-
Belsen concentration camp. The
memorial symbolizes the contrast
of modern Germany to the Ger
many of World War 11.
There are no gas chambers or
ovens or barbed wire. In fact, the
entire camp was burned by the
British in 1945 to prevent the
spread of typhus. Today, what
was once the scene of unspeakable
horror is marked by neat
sidewalks, modern memorials and
fields of purple heather.
The only evidence of the
genocide that once occurred is a
small museum and markers,
which indicate that what appear
to be mounds of earth covered

with heather are actually massive
graves filled with thousands of
bodies.
As the students headed to the
airport on their way home, senior
Judith Eisenberg remarked, "Did
you ever think you'd be sad to
leave Germany?" Her question
reflected a change that had oc
curred in the participants. While
once the students might have been
unwilling or even frightened to
visit Germany, after the trip they
found themselves sad to leave new
friends and "families" in Bonn.
"I'm sure that I want to go
back. I loved it as a country and
made good friends," Wice said.
The "Bridge of Understanding"
was the brainchild of Professor
Hans-Adolf Jacobsen of the
Rheinische Friedrichs Wilhelm
University in Bonn, West Ger
many and Cantor Hans Cohn who
leads a congregation in Redwood
City. Both men were born in Ber
lin in the 1920'5, but, with the

advent of World War 11, their lives
diverged dramatically.
Jacobsen, born to a Protestant
family, was a member of the Hit
ler Youth and an officer in the
Nazi army. During his five years
as a prisoner in Russia at the end
of the war, he decided to turn his
life around and dedicate himself
to study and education about the
Nazi era in an effort to find out
why and how it could have hap
pened.
Cohn was born into a Jewish
family and, shortly after the war
broke out, was forced, with his
family, to flee Berlin with "10
marks and a suitcase" through
Italy and Shanghai and finally to
the United States.
Decades after the war's end,
these two men who were once on
opposite sides are close friends
and working together to ensure
that the horrors of 1933 to 1945
are never repeated.
