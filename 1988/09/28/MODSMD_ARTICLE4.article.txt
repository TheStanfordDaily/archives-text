# Stanford's research unaffected by investment in computer firm
## 
### Kevin Wacknov 
The University's $1.3 million
investment in Next, Inc., a deci
sion recently assailed in The New
York Times, was defended by a
University vice president and
members of the computer science
faculty yesterday.
Next is the manufacturer of a
yet-to-be-released computer that
has generated much speculation
in the industry. Computer
analysts believe that the machine
will feature groundbreaking tech
nology.
Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Ap
ple Computer, is president of Next
and is targeting the higher edu

cation market with the computer.
After profiling Next in a Sept.
13 business article, the Times
wrote a Sept. 19 editorial stating
that Stanford and Carnegie-
Mellon are "misdirecting their re
search" in the direction of the
dollar.
Carnegie-Mellon has made an
identical $1.3 million investment
in Next.
Responding to the editorial,
Computer Science Dept. Chair
Nils Nilsson said, "As far as 1
know, the [department's] involve
ment was that some number of
professors were asked to give ad
vice in the technical merits of
[Next's product]."

Members of the computer sci
ence faculty added the agreement
does not require them to do sig
nificant work for the company.
Vice President of Business and
Finance William Massey said the
deal came neither with strings at
tached nor any sweeteners for
Stanford. "We have no obligation
to buy their computers and will
get no special prices as part of
our investment," he said.
Last week's Times editorial
said, "...when universities go into
business, they risk an insidious
confusion of roles. It's the func-
tion of corporations, not univer
sities, to bring new products to
market." The editorial also com
pared Harvard's recent partner
ship with a biotechnology firm to
Stanford's investment in Next.
"I chuckled when I read that
article," Massey said. "The New
York Times discovered that we
actually invest in companies,"
citing a long-standing practice of
the University.
It is easy to draw parallels to
the University's support of two
young engineers named William
Hewlett and David Packard a half
century ago. The two who went
on to become billionaires when
their computer firm took off.
"We had been tracking the de
velopment of Next, and when
[Jobs] asked us to invest, we were
sympathetic to what he was
trying to do for higher education,"
Massey said.
But Kathy Cook, public rela
tions officer for Next, suggested
Stanford's action was "pure and
simply a financial investment."
Massey explained that the re
lation between Stanford and Next
is not as extensive to Harvard's
joint venture.
"I don't think our investment
in Next is at all comparable to
what Harvard is doing," he said.
