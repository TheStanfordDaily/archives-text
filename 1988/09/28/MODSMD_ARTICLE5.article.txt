# Drought conditions force water conserving measures

As a result of the ongoing
drought in northern California,
Stanford has turned to local well
water supplies and is now imple
menting several water-rationing
measures.
The well water, which is tested
every other day for purity, has a
clouded appearance — and a dif
ferent taste to some — because it
picks up more air when it is
pumped to campus. Dormitories
— such as Stern and Wilbur Halls
and Manzanita Park have water
that looks noticeably different
than normal because they are lo
cated nearest to the well.
Despite these changes, the
water is perfectly safe to drink,
according to Manager of Mechan
ical Utilities Cheryl Jensen.
As a result of a decrease in
rainfall, the Hetch Hetchy Reser
voir, which normally fills Stanford
sprinklers and faucets, is cur
rently down to 37 percent of its
normal capacity, according to the
San Francisco Bay Area Water

Users Association. The reservoir
is located near San Francisco.
To respond to the rationing
levels set by the water department
last May, Stanford is in the proc
ess of taking many water-saving
measures such as installing low
flow fixtures on showerheads and
faucets.
Operations and Maintenance
has also continued to reduce ir
rigation around campus. This
summer, for instance, the water
drained from Lake Lagunita was
used to water campus grounds,
and the golf course is currently
being irrigated with well water.
Stanford's efforts to comply
with the water department's re
duction goals have generally been
successful, Jensen said. The water
department's goal for 1988 is to
reduce overall water consumption
by 25 percent throughout the San
Francisco, San Mateo, Southern
Alameda and Northern Santa
Clara counties.
Cutbacks were heavy over the
