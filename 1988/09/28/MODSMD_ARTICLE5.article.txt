# Drought conditions force water conserving measures

### Paula Gani 
As a result of the ongoing
drought in northern California,
Stanford has turned to local well
water supplies and is now imple
menting several water-rationing
measures.
The well water, which is tested
every other day for purity, has a
clouded appearance — and a dif
ferent taste to some — because it
picks up more air when it is
pumped to campus. Dormitories
— such as Stern and Wilbur Halls
and Manzanita Park have water
that looks noticeably different
than normal because they are lo
cated nearest to the well.
Despite these changes, the
water is perfectly safe to drink,
according to Manager of Mechan
ical Utilities Cheryl Jensen.
As a result of a decrease in
rainfall, the Hetch Hetchy Reser
voir, which normally fills Stanford
sprinklers and faucets, is cur
rently down to 37 percent of its
normal capacity, according to the
San Francisco Bay Area Water

Users Association. The reservoir
is located near San Francisco.
To respond to the rationing
levels set by the water department
last May, Stanford is in the proc
ess of taking many water-saving
measures such as installing low
flow fixtures on showerheads and
faucets.
Operations and Maintenance
has also continued to reduce ir
rigation around campus. This
summer, for instance, the water
drained from Lake Lagunita was
used to water campus grounds,
and the golf course is currently
being irrigated with well water.
Stanford's efforts to comply
with the water department's re
duction goals have generally been
successful, Jensen said. The water
department's goal for 1988 is to
reduce overall water consumption
by 25 percent throughout the San
Francisco, San Mateo, Southern
Alameda and Northern Santa
Clara counties.
Cutbacks were heavy over the
summer as the water department
scheduled a 40 percent reduction
of water use.
According to Jensen, individual
efforts to reduce water usage have
been good and Stanford has been
able to meet rationing levels.
However, the construction of
the new 776-person Lilior Green
Rains Apartments between Mir
rielees and Escondido Village will
constitute a significant increase
in campus water usage that will
have to be made up elsewhere,

she said.
To curtail increased water use
and waste within the University,
the Housing and Food Services
Water Conservation Committee is
concentrating its efforts to help
conserve water within the Uni
versity.
The committee, formed at the
beginning of the summer, acts as
an umbrella group to encourage
water conservation throughout
the University.
For example, with the commit
tee's encouragement, Housing and
Food Services workers have begun
to clean windows and courtyards
with brushes and buckets instead
of hosing them off. According to

Keith Guy, director of that de
partment, the staff is being asked
to look carefully for areas of
waste.
The committee also worked to
reduce water usage among the
14,000 summer visitors who at
tended conferences at Stanford.
The committee plans to meet
throughout the year and hopes to
expand its membership to stu
dents and staff from other offices
such as Residential Education, ac
cording to Guy.
The committee hopes to con
tinue its campaign through ads,
meetings and posters to increase
student awareness of the problem
