# Cultural heritage and diversity celebrated during Orientation
## 
### Mark Robinson 
In a celebration of cultural
heritage and political will, four
student of color organizations
used gospel singing, theater and
traditional dance to introduce
new students to Stanford's eth
nic diversity.
Presented to a capacity crowd
at Memorial Auditorium Mon
day night, "The Fire Within"
was a cultural program new to
Orientation.
Before the two-hour show was
over, the enthusiastic crowd,
made up mostly of freshmen,
had seen everything from an
amazing Pueblo hoop dance to

three scenes from the play Paper
Angels by Genny Lim. At the
end of the program, eight Stan
ford workers were invited on
stage and introduced to the au
dience.
"A central point of this pro
gram was the importance of re
spect for all people .... All
people does not just mean all
students," said Council of Presi
dents member Miguel MArquez,
a member of MEChA (a Chicano
student group).
Leaders of the four participat
ing organizations — the Asian
American Student Association,
the Black Student Union,
MEChA and the Stanford Amer

ican Indian Organization —
punctuated the performances
with speeches stressing the eve
ning's theme that the culture
and politics of students of color
cannot be separated.
"Traditionally, people of color
have used art as a form of po
litical expression," said COP
member Canetta Ivy, a member
of the BSU. "The two are
definitely linked."
"The point of the program is
to start the year on a positive
note," said COP member Stacy
Leyton, referring to last year's
backlash against organizations
