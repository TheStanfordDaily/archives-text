# Cultural heritage and diversity celebrated during Orientation
## 
### Mark Robinson 
In a celebration of cultural
heritage and political will, four
student of color organizations
used gospel singing, theater and
traditional dance to introduce
new students to Stanford's eth
nic diversity.
Presented to a capacity crowd
at Memorial Auditorium Mon
day night, "The Fire Within"
was a cultural program new to
Orientation.
Before the two-hour show was
over, the enthusiastic crowd,
made up mostly of freshmen,
had seen everything from an
amazing Pueblo hoop dance to

three scenes from the play Paper
Angels by Genny Lim. At the
end of the program, eight Stan
ford workers were invited on
stage and introduced to the au
dience.
"A central point of this pro
gram was the importance of re
spect for all people .... All
people does not just mean all
students," said Council of Presi
dents member Miguel MArquez,
a member of MEChA (a Chicano
student group).
Leaders of the four participat
ing organizations — the Asian
American Student Association,
the Black Student Union,
MEChA and the Stanford Amer

ican Indian Organization —
punctuated the performances
with speeches stressing the eve
ning's theme that the culture
and politics of students of color
cannot be separated.
"Traditionally, people of color
have used art as a form of po
litical expression," said COP
member Canetta Ivy, a member
of the BSU. "The two are
definitely linked."
"The point of the program is
to start the year on a positive
note," said COP member Stacy
Leyton, referring to last year's
backlash against organizations

for students of color, especially
the BSU, which narrowly won its
request for an ASSU fee assess
ment.
M6rquez agreed, "students of
color are a positive force on
campus — we're not into intimi
dation politics."
The idea for the event sprang
out of the success of last year's
"The Fire Within," which was
part of the annual "You Can Make
a Difference" conference. Last
year's conference, sponsored by
the Public Service Center, focused
on the theme of institutional rac
ism. The COP approached the
four organizations with the idea
for an orientation version of the
program and eventually got the
backing of the office of Residential
Education and the Richard and
Carmella Ho Fund.
Audience Pleased
"It was one of the least boring
events of Orientation," said fresh
men Kristine McGibbons.
McGibbons' friend, a freshman
from New Jersey, was glad to find
out about the different groups.
"Now we know they exist," he
said.
First year student Dana Gregg,
who has already been involved the
BSU, was amazed at the vitality

of Stanford's student of color or
ganizations. "I didn't expect t<?
find such great organization," he
said. He said he plans to join other
campus groups this year.
