# Continuing Studies Program begins classes

### Chris Shuttlesworth Staff writer 
1 Stanford night school is now
; in session.
» The University officially opens
\ its doors to the community when
» the first classes in Stanford's
new Continuing Studies Pro
gram commence tonight.
Taught by University faculty,
the program offers six specially
designed liberal arts classes to
adult members of the surround
ing communities and to Univer
sity employees. Administrators
estimate that over 200 adult stu
dents will have registered for the
• new program by Tuesday.
"It was time for the University
; to offer itself to the general
; public," Classics Prof, and Dean
. of Continuing Studies Marsh
McCall said of the decision to
start the program. While the
courses do offer credit, the units
earned cannot be applied toward
any Stanford degrees or require
ments.
This fall's classes range from
a course in modern black politics
■ taught by Assoc. Prof, of History
Clayborne Carson to a course
examining the origins and his
tory of competitive sports in the

ancient world taught by
Emeritus Classics Prof. Antony
Raubitschek. McCall will begin
a three-quarter sequence called
"Masterpieces of Literature."
Students receive two to four
units per class and must pay
$100 per unit. While admitting
that this fee might be considered
high in comparison to junior col
lege continuing education pro
grams, McCall said the cost is
low compared to the costs paid
by regular undergraduate stu
dents.
"We're caught between a rock
and a hard place when it comes
to the cost,"he said. "We have
to break even within a couple of
years."
McCall said many members of
the Faculty Senate expressed
concern that the Continuing
Studies Program could hurt
Stanford's undergraduate edu
cation by diverting faculty atten
tion from their regular course
load. However, he emphasized
that the program's courses "are
not a substitute for teaching reg
ular courses."
Carson said he decided to
teach in the program because he
had enjoyed previous experiences
teaching out-of-school adults.

"I hope they will gain more
knowledge about the world
around them," he said, adding
that the University "needs to
make its resources available to
the community."
Among the new registrants,
the Fiction Writing Workshop
had "by far" the most enthusi
astic response, he said. Although
a second section was added to
accomodate 15 additional stu
dents, not all those who regis
tered will be able to take this
class.
Approximately a year and a
half ago, Provost James Rosse
commissioned a task force to
look into the possibility of Stan
ford offering classes to the gen
eral public.
After the task force gave the
proposal a positive recommenda
tion, the Faculty Senate voted
last spring to adopt the program.
Education Prof. Denis Phil
lips, one of the six instructors
teaching in the program this fall,
called the program a "good ini
tiative on Stanford's part."
"It's a service we can offer to
turn people into the friends of
the University," he said, noting

that many people who live near
the University often express am
bivalence to their famous neigh
bor.
Because the courses are "in
troductory university-level
courses," McCall said he hopes
other institutions will recognize
the credit. The University Honor
Code and the grading system
also apply to the program.
