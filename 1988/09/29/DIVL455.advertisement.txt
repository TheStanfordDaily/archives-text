We've been all over the
world to bring you a
pizza that's out
of this world.
Originally from Hungary, Bela Kardos
traveled extensively through Europe
and North America — testing,
refining and improving his pizza.
Lucky for us, he settled on the
Peninsula. While the rest of the world
will have to wait, we get to enjoy the
pies of his labors. A masterpiece of
cheeses, sauce, and toppings on a
crust to die for.
Come tast the difference a world can
make at Applewood Inn. Or call
Applewood 2-Go.
It's not just pizza at Applewood.
