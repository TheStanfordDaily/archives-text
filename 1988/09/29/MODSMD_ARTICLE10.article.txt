## Speaker foresees depression and explains how to survive 
### Monique Scheer Editorial staff 
For Ravi Batra, Indian philos
ophy is as fundamental to eco
nomic forecasting as supply and
demand curves.
Batra, who spoke Tuesday eve
ning to a near-capacity crowd in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, is a mem
ber of the Southern Methodist
University Department of Eco
nomics. He was its chairman from
1977 to 1980. And since he pub
lished his best-selling book of eco
nomic forecasts, "The Great De
pression of 1990," he has gained
considerable attention.
Batra offered several important
tips in his rather short speech on
"How to survive the great depres
sion of 1990": Get out of debt
now; buy gold coins; avoid jobs in
industries such as high tech and
construction.
"I actually should have named
the book, 'From Boom to Doom,' "
Batra said, introducing the basic
principles of his theory. Batra
claims that an initial economic
boom will lead up to a stock mar
ket crash unprecedented in its
severity, followed by seven years
of the worst depression in world
history.

Batra said he has been right in
the past, claiming that he pre
dicted, among other things, a drop
in inflation back in 1982 when
"conventional economists," as he
called them, were forecasting a
continued rise.
Nonetheless, Batra's bestselling
book is considered by many to be
just another doomsay-for-dollars
project. He said the proceeds from

'... when you feel in
your heart that
calamity will strike in
the '90s, you can't
just sit there and do
nothing.'

ticket and book sales at lectures
go to charity. But that charity is
the PROUT Institute, an organ
ization dedicated to the furthering
of his theory.
However, Batra made a claim
for furthering his own cause, say
ing "when you feel in your heart
that calamity will strike in the
'90s, you can't just sit there and
do nothing."

What many economists doubt
about Batra's work are not his
good intentions, but his statistics
and his work's underlying princi
ple, PROUT, or Progressive
Utilization Theory. With this eco
nomic paradigm, Batra views his
tory as a series of social cycles:
the ages of laborers, of warriors,
of intellectuals and of acquisitors.
These ages come full circle once
every six decades. At the end,
when a large percentage of the
society's wealth has become con
centrated in the hands of a small
percentage of the population, the
depression strikes. Then the ages
begin over again.
This is precisely what happened
in the late 1920s and what is hap
pening now in the late 1980s,
Batra said. The only way the gov
ernment could avert depression
now, he said, would be to reduce
the deficit and national debt by
taxing the wealthy and taxing na
tions to whom the U.S. provides
military support.
Robert Hall, a Hoover senior
fellow, summarizing the senti
ments of several Stanford
economists, said, "We have all
tended to distance ourselves as
much as possible from his work."
