## All systems go Shuttle ready for launch today

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP)
â€” Discovery's five astronauts,
anxious to break an agonizing 32-
month drought in American
spaceflight, were "elated to be
headed for space" yesterday as the
overnight countdown began for a
midmorning launch today.
NASA officials were admittedly
nervous, but confident. "The
space shuttle is ready to fly," said
shuttle administrator Richard
Truly, adding, "Even the weather
is looking good."
The ship, obscured for weeks
behind a giant scaffold, stood in
full view after NASA retracted the
structure. The process took place
hours early, so "workers will have
a head start" on final countdown
procedures. The count resumed
at mid-evening yesterday after a
day-long, scheduled hold.
Fueling was to begin about 1:40
a.m. EDT, with the craft bathed
in brilliant spotlights.
"This has been a long two and
one half years," Truly said of the
difficult period since the Chal
lenger accident in 1986. Liftoff
was scheduled for 9:59 a.m. EDT,
with a two-hour window to take
care of weather or technical
delays.
After launch officials gave pre
liminary go-ahead for overnight
fueling of Discovery, Truly passed
the news to Frederick Hauck, the
shuttle commander. "The best
way to describe him is elated to
be headed for space," Truly told
reporters.
The crew studied updated flight
plans and received weather brief
ings before an early bedtime.
Around the Kennedy Space Cen
ter area, excitement was mount
ing. Campers and recreation
vehicles found good viewing places
across the Indian River. Souvenir
sellers set up shop. NASA's

Visitor's Center sold out of the
commemoratfve envelopes that
feature the crew patch.
NASA's deputy administrator
Dale Myers exulted that "we have
been working for two and one half
years to put the shuttle back in
business and tomorrow is the day
we plan to do that." He said "it's
really the beginning of the future
for our space program."
Arnold Aldrich, director of the
shuttle program said, jubilantly,
"tomorrow the shuttle should
return to its proper place in the
sky and launch us into a new era."
Hauck and his four-man crew
had an easy day, relaxing at the
crew quarters seven miles from
launch pad 398. Their wives were
there, too.
They were to be awakened at
5 a.m., for breakfast, a last
minute weather briefing, and time
to get into their cumbersome
flight suits.
The four-day Discovery mission
will be the first shuttle flight since
Challenger exploded in a fireball
73 seconds after liftoff from the
same launch pad on Jan. 28, 1986.
The accident ceded manned space
to the Soviet Union, which has
put 16 cosmonauts into orbit since
then, aboard six flights.
Asked what would be going
through his mind as the count
ticks down, the center's deputy
director, Tom Utsman, said, "I'll
be saying that hopefully we have
done all the right things, that we
haven't taken any shortcuts, that
we haven't overlooked anything.
"I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't
nervous," he said.
As a result of investigations
since the accident, the shuttle
fleet and NASA's management
have undergone major changes.
The shuttle itself has had 210
modifications, including the addi

tion of an escape system that
would enable the crew to bail out
if the ship had to ditch in the
ocean. The escape system would
not have saved the Challenger
crew.
The shuttle booster rockets,
blamed for the Challenger

tragedy, have undergone an $800
million redesign.
Because of the many changes,
Hauck said the mission is consid
ered a test flight. "We'll probably
see some surprises, but I don't
think they'll be life-threatening
surprises," he said.
