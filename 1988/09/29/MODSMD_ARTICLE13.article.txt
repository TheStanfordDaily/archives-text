GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) -
Democrat Michael Dukakis, pledg
ing to shut a revolving door be
tween government jobs and
private lobbying, derided George
Bush yesterday for an adminis
tration he said was "a wheel of
fortune for future foreign agents."
Maintaining an aggressive as
sault on his Republican rival, Du
kakis also ridiculed Bush's new
tax-deferred savings plan. Waving
a $20 bill to represent the amount
an average family would save in
a year, he declared, "George Bush
plays Santa Claus to the wealthy
and Ebenezer Scrooge to the rest
of us."
Before a large crowd that filled
a street at the center of
Greensburg in western Pennsyl
vania, the Democratic presidential
nominee sought to link the vice
president with allegations of eth
ical violations and illegality by

former officials of the Reagan ad
ministration, and with the lobby
ing for foreign governments of
Bush's own associates.
"George Bush may be satisfied
with this administration's Hall of
Shame — dozens and dozens of
top administration officials who
broke the law or violated the
public trust," Dukakis said.
"He may be satisfied with let
ting Japan make the cars while
his former colleagues make the
license plates. I say America can
do better than that."
Later, the Massachusetts gover
nor met for an hour in New York
with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in a session
Dukakis said was "just a chance
to get acquainted."
Shevardnadze, asked which of
the two candidates he preferred,
said diplomatically, "I'll tell you
after the election."
