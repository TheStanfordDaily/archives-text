LUDHIANA, India (AP) -
Flood waters that have claimed
at least 282 lives started to recede
yesterday in four northern Indian
states, but thousands of people
remained homeless, government
officials said.
At least 900 villages in northern
Punjab state were submerged un
der more than four feet of water,
officials said.
Boats and helicopters helped
evacuate at least 40,000 pepple
from these villages, said J.N.
Srivastava, an official at the Flood
Control Center in Chandigarh,
capital of both Punjab and
Haryana states.
Hundreds of people crowded
onto small islands of high ground

Wednesday along the Sutlej River
in central Punjab.
"My entire family is perched on
a tree," said Tara Singh of
Kasabab village. "I have been
moving from place to place for
the past two days to get a boat,
but in vain."
Another flood victim, Avtar
Kaur, said no boats were available
to rescue her old and ailing father
in-law. "He is bed-ridden and has
been on the roof of our house for
the past four days," she said.
The government said victims
died from drowning and house col
lapses in the weeklong floods.
Newspapers put the death toll at
more than 400 people.
