Senate approves homeless-aid bill
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Senate approved
legislation yesterday that would empower the
government to provide $1.3 billion worth of emer
gency food and housing, health care, education
and other help to the nation's homeless people
over the next two years.
The House passed a similar measure last
month. Negotiators from the two chambers will
have to compose a compromise bill that would
have to be approved by both chambers before it
is sent to the White House for President Reagan's
signature.
The legislation, known as the McKinney Bill,
was approved by a voice vote. It would extend
for two years a law that otherwise would expire
with the end of the 1988 federal fiscal year this
Friday.
The bill would allow the government to provide
money to states, municipalities and private agen
cies for rental assistance, health care, mental
health services, alcohol and drug abuse programs,
education and job training projects.
Funds would be available for the purchase and
rehabilitation of group homes. In addition,
unused space at Veterans Administration hospi
tals would be set aside for the treatment of home
less veterans.
The actual money for the programs would have
to be provided in separate appropriations bills.
Advocates for the country's homeless popula
tion — estimated at between 250,000 and 3 mil
lion people — have been angry because so far,
the government has not fully financed the legis

lation. In the first two years of the law, the
government has provided only $700 million out
of a possible $1.1 billion.
The measure is named after the late Rep.
Stewart McKinney, R-Conn., one of the original
sponsors of the bill. McKinney died May 7, 1987,
less than three months after the legislation be
came law.
Terrorists bomb Texaco executive
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Terrorists set off
a bomb by remote control last night in an ap
parent attempt to kill the head of a Texaco sub
sidiary as he and his wife passed by in a bul
letproof car, police said.
Two passersby were hurt, but executive John
Buttle and his wife Betty escaped harm, the
Bogota radio station RCN said, quoting witnesses
at the scene.
The bomb appeared to have been strapped to
a fire hydrant and was set off as the Butties'
Mercedes Benz limousine passed by slowly in
rush hour traffic, police said in a news release.
The Buttles were on their way home when the
bomb exploded about three blocks from their
house, police said. The explosion was near the
intersection of the North Highway with 127 th
street in northern Bogota.
House windows shattered up to three blocks
away, witnesses told RCN.
Buttle has lived in Colombia more than 20
years. He is president of Texas Petroleum, a
Texaco subsidiary.
