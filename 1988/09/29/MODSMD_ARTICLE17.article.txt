Rains should signal the
start of a downpour of
undergraduate housing

THE RAINS Apartments are
simply gorgeous. Just a
casual stroll past the stately
beige buildings neatly arranged
upon expanses of green grass can
take your breath away. It might
also spark envy in your heart, if
you're one of many undergradu
ates relegated to one of the less
attractive dorms on campus.
Of course, beauty isn't every
thing. For instance, some are pro
testing the establishment of stu
dent housing on the corner of Bow
doin Street and Campus Drive be
cause it is the source of increased
traffic right across from Escondido
Village, where many small children
tend to run about. But even they
would be hard-pressed to deny that
the Lilior Green Rains Apartments
really look good.
Amazingly enough, Rains was
actually completed on schedule,
and apartments could be assigned
in September. Because it offered
776 new spaces, all graduate stu
dents who were willing to live on
campus were guaranteed housing.
That freed up quite a bit of space
in Escondido Village, Crothers
Memorial and Mirrielees for un
dergraduates, who have been espe
cially cramped since the closing of
Roble Hall last winter. In that
sense, the opening of Rains
couldn't have been more timely.

But it doesn't make enough
room for everyone who wants on
campus housing. Opening Rains
may prove to be great for alleviat
ing the housing load now, but the
University shouldn't stop there.
The closing of Roble Hall dis
placed 294 undergraduate stu
dents. Top that off with 85 more
freshmen enrolling this year than
planned for.
Despite the new spaces available
in housing previously reserved for
graduates, plenty of students will
still be living in converted study
rooms this year. Newly created
quads and quints probably won't
be reverted back to their original
triple-status until Autumn 1991,
at the earliest.
By that time, says Director of
Student Housing, Rodger Whitney,
the University should open a new
undergraduate housing facility.
The punctual opening of Rains
should actually raise our hopes that
the next big project will also be
finished on time. Unless the Uni
versity rests on the laurels of the
Rains accomplishment and puts it
off.
Presumably, Roble Hall will be
re-opened some time in the not
too-distant future. But we need
more undergraduate housing above
and beyond that.
This seems to be a popular time
to start new projects. We've all
seen the new signs posted around
campus; we've all had to detour
around the numerous Construction
sites. Let's continue the trend.
It's about time the University
made good on its long-time goal of
guaranteeing four years of housing
for its undergraduate students.
