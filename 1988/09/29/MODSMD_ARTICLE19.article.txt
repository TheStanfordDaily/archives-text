## Change is all that remains constant 
### 
AMERICANS, and people just about
everywhere, now know that big
changes are underway in the world
— changes in virtually every subject from
science to superpower relations. So un
derstanding and managing change is cru
cial. The United States has been trying
to do that in recent years. And we've had
some success in doing so, because our
society thrives on change.
The very material substances that sur
round us in everyday life are being trans
formed. Physically, synthetic materials
make objects lighter, stronger and more
durable. But they are changing societies
and economics, too, because their emer
gence affects supply and demand for nat
ural raw materials. The same scientific
progress has also accelerated the speed
of human transactions.
Along with these alterations in sub
stance and speed have come changes in
magnitude. Scientific, economic and po
litical matters are global in dimension
and enormous in extent. They are out
stripping the traditional means by which
governments dealt with them.
The thread that runs through all these
things is knowledge: its discovery, its
rapid transmission as information and
the education needed to use it. Access to
ideas, no matter where they are devel
oped, becomes the key to scientific and
economic progress.
As we face a phalanx of changing con
ditions, three principles stand out for
dealing with the size, speed and complex
ity of events today.

First, a society must be open to this
new age of knowledge and information;
to resist it deadens our hope of progress.
Today's transformations are products of
our own system of openness and
creativity.
Second, for decision makers, the mar
gins for error are diminishing as the con
sequences of error increase in scope and
gravity. Overcentralized plans and deci
sions increasingly will be inept. Free op
eration of the marketplace -- for goods
and ideas — is the far more efficient
arbiter of decisions. Entrepreneurial ini
tiative in a market environment is the
engine of development and change.
Third, the global nature of changes in
science, in economics, in communications
must be matched by political develop
ments, particularly the strengthening and
closer association of like-minded persons.
How do things stand in applying these
principles today? Not bad. The most stir
ring political response to the new temper
of our time has been the resurgence of
democracy and the demand for political
openness and participation.
Around the globe we see a powerful
impulse toward democratic institutions
and values, first in Spain and Portugal;
a decade ago and now in Latin America
from Argentina to El Salvador. In a world
of blurring national boundaries, dis
persed power, and new players vying for
influence in international affairs, there
will be a continuing need for U.S. en
gagement and leadership.
We must not falter on the economic

front. We can take great satisfaction
knowing that the message of economic
freedom is at last being heard and acted
upon in country after country around
the world. If we ourselves yield to the
temptation to return to isolation, protec
tion, and structural rigidities, we betray
this movement — and general prosperity
in the era ahead will be a lost cause.
Economic progress and freedom go
hand in hand. New democracies will re
quire continuous support and encourage
ment. The United States and the Soviet
Union must make the most of opportu
nities to transform the adversarial char
acter of the U.S.-Soviet relationship to
one that is better for both our people
and for the world at large.
We will leave it to future historians to
give our age a name. Our task is to try
to throw off outmoded concepts of the
past as well as cloudy generalities about
the future. What we need is to see the
dynamism in the size, speed, and scope
of global change. And most of all we need
to see that this change is our doing. We
can manage it better than anyone. We
have to have the courager to stand fast
to our principles: democracy, free enter
prise, the cooperation association of re
sponsible nations.
With this as our vision and guide, we
face a bright future indeed.
