## NCAA moves for a new trial

Saying that NCAA attorneys
might be trying to "perfect their
appeal," University lawyer Debra
Zumwalt confirmed yesterday
that she recently received a mo
tion to bring the Stanford drug
testing case back to court.
According to Zumwalt, NCAA
lawyers have indicated that they
do not think that their latest mo
tion, filed Sept. 13, will be
granted. However, Zumwalt spec
ulated that by motioning for a
new trial, the NCAA might be
trying to enhance its chances of
winning an appeal.
The NCAA attorneys were un

available for comment.
This August, Santa Clara
County Judge Conrad Rushing
seemed to have squelched the
policy for drug testing Stanford
students when he ruled that the
urine tests were an invasion of
privacy under the California Con
stitution.
Despite Rushing's verdict —
which received national attention
— the NCAA is legally allowed to
file for one new trial. If the
NCAA's current motion is not up
held, the NCAA has said it will
then take Rushing's verdict to the
California Court of Appeals by
mid-October.
According to Rushing's final

verdict, "The NCAA may not
declare any athlete ineligible or
take punitive action against such
athletes for failure to comply with
or participate in the NCAA drug
testing policy."
Zumwalt said the NCAA's 100-
page motion she recently received
hinged on a charge of the Uni
versity providing insufficient
evidence. The NCAA lawyers are
"just making sure they've raised
all their arguments," she said.
Although the NCAA is hoping
for a new trial, Zumwalt pointed
out that the NCAA has not re
quested an oral hearing — oral
