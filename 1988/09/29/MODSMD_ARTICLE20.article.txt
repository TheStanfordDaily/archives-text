Union's withdrawal
of its proposal
wasn't big surprise
On Tuesday, University officials
stated they would make no further
proposals in contract negotiations with
the United Stanford Workers. The
University's lack of response to the
union's proposed modifications led to
the withdrawl of the USW's offer.
This was no surprise.
As I told The Daily, the union on
Sunday made a daring move in an
attempt to move negotiations along
faster, something management said it
wanted. The union made an extensive
modification to its proposal, involving
extensive concessions. The only way

the USW could make such major modi
fications to its prior proposal, was to
do so conditionally.
If management did make roughly
equivalent movement, the union simply
could not leave such concessions on
the table. Management chose to re
spond with virtually no concessions. It
had a choice. It chose "business as
usual," and was not surprised at the
result. This forced the union to with
draw its proposed modifications.
The union proposal, with all changes
management made before Sunday, re
mains on the table. The union will
continue to propose modifications,
make concessions and bargain. Un
fortunately, thanks to management's
refusal to move faster, the pace will
continue to be slow.

Bacons' exceptional
warmth and spirit
is not mysterious
We compliment Eric Young for his
interesting article about the home of
Roz and Harold Bacon. Roz, once the
director of Roble Hall, and Professor
Bacon, Stanford's much loved Calculus
professor, have been exceptional role
models and guiding spirits for many
generations of Stanford students whom
they have welcomed in droves to their
beautiful home. Their home is really
no mystery. It's welcoming brass
knocker is always freshly polished by
Professor Bacon himself.
Many alums in thinking of Stanford,
first think of Roz and Harold who do

so much to keep honored Stanford
traditions alive. Roz recently served as
Chairman of the Stanford Historical
Society Nominating Committee which
after much research and deliberation
proposed the names for the new Rains
Houses; she and Harold were also in
strumental in proposing the names
selected for Governor's Corner. Roz is
so popular among the many genera
tions of Cap and Gowners that last
year more contributions to the Cap
and Gown Scholarship fund were made
in her honor than any other honoree.
Stanford is indeed lucky that Roz
and Harold Bacon so generously and
enthusiastically contribute their
energies to make Stanford a warmly
remembered institution.
