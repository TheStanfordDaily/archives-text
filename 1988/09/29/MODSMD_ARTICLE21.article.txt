# Grief can be shared even by those who did not know him
## 
### 
This summer, some of us found out
we lost a friend. Edward Paul Nichol
son died in a plane crash. Those of us
who knew him, knew him as Buster.
For those of you who did not know
Buster, please take with you that you
do share a commonality. For most of
us, at one time, as did Buster, we par
ticipated in the same spirited freshman
activities, we attended football games,
we walked among the beautiful green
trees that dot the Stanford campus.
We have all treaded on the same
ground as Buster.
For those who did know him, you
may remember his smile, his sincerity,
his concern, his cheerfulness, his
charm.
When someone dies, someone who
has touched our lives, who has crossed

our path even for a moment, there is
indeed a sense of loss â€” a void, a void
which widens as the closeness of the
relationship deepens. What we are left
with, and what we can carry with us
is the memory of what that person
looked like, that person's smile, what
about that person made you smile,
what he or she lived for and what you
shared with him or her.
Buster will be missed by those who
knew him and loved him. Someone
with a smiling heart such as Buster's
will surely be missed.
