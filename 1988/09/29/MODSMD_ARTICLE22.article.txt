# Women's Center and its amenities open to everyone

Do you know where the Stanford
Women's Center is? A better question
might be, do you know what the Stan

ford Women's Center is?
The responses I received from
several people around campus varied
quite a bit and most of the answers
were inaccurate at best. "I've never
heard of it," replied a frosh woman.
An upperclass man told me, "Yeah,
that's the place where all those women
scream at night—it's right next to
Toyon." Another woman explained that
I shouldn't be interested because the
only people that go there are "rad
fems" who "all hate men anyway."
I've been a member of the Women's
Center here at Stanford since my first
year here (two years ago). It is open to
anyone interested in issues of concern
for women. The Center provides a wide
variety of services to the Stanford com
munity in general and the Women's
community in particular, including
support groups, a library, programs,
workshops, a weekly Coffee House and
a comfortable place in which to hang
out.
The Rape Education Project and the
Self-Defense Classes also have activities
at the Women's Center.

Oh, and, where is it? Well, that up
perclass student had it right. It is lo
cated in the Toyon Eating Clubs be
tween Manzanita Park and Encina
Station, and between Serra Street and
Toyon.
