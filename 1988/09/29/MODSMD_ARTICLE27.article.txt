## Conference to cultivate vegetarian ideals on campus 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Stanford Vegetarians are
hoping that the next time you pick
up a burger at a fast-food restau
rant, you will consider more than
whether to hold the mustard.
The Stanford community will
get a taste of vegetarian cuisine
and ideology Saturday when the
Stanford Vegetarians and Penin
sula Vegetarians host a World
Vegetarian Day Symposium at
Kresge Auditorium. The program
features speakers who will high
light dietary issues facing the
world today, and free food-tasting
intended to demonstrate the tasti
ness of a meat-free diet.
Speakers will cover four major
aspects of vegetarianism. Cal
State-Hayward professor of

philosphy Steve Sapontzis will ar
gue in defense of animal rights.
Kim Sturla, executive director of
the Peninsula Society, will discuss
ways to improve the methods of
raising farm animals. Other
speakers will focus on whether
humans are designed to be meat
eaters and the impact of
vegetarianism on world food re
sources. Already 150 people have
pre-registered for the conference,
according to Inder Singh, co
founder of the Peninsula
Vegetarians and the fledgling
Stanford Vegetarians.
Stanford, with vegetarian
oriented houses such as Columbae
and Synergy, has a large vegetar
ian population. Singh claims there
are "a minimum of 500 or 600
vegetarians on campus," all of
whom have reasons varying from

social consciousness to social pres
sure for avoiding meat. He is
hoping to raise awareness on
campus and encourage students
to join the newly-formed Stanford
Vegetarians.
Reasons for giving up meat and
animal-related foods, range from
interest in one's personal health
to concern for world food
shortages, Singh said.
One consideration affecting
many vegetarians' decision to
forgo meat, according to Singh, is
the considerable difference be
tween the amount of calories of
fossil fuel expended to produce
one calorie of protein. For in
stance, 78 calories are needed for
one calorie of feedlot beef protein,
38 for milk, 3.6 for corn, and two
calories of fossil fuel go into
producing one calorie of soybean
protein.
Milton Mills, president of the
Stanford Medical Students Asso
ciation also points out that live
stock consume 80 percent of the
American grain production.
Another issue that has discour
aged some students from a meat
eating diet is the environmental
damage that raising livestock
causes in some areas of the world,
Singh said.
One well-known example of this
is the destruction of South Amer
ican rain forests to create short
term cattle grazing land, that
feeds animals used for beef by
North American chain restau
rants, he added.
Sapontzis argues that it is most
important "to be fair to animals"
in raising them for our consump
tion, and said "being nice" to
them is not the issue. Comparing
animal rights to the tradition of
human slavery, he feels that
animals, including chicken and
fish, are "exploited" for the in
dulgence of humans. He argues
that the practice of killing animals
in today's quantity and manner
takes unnecessary advantage of
animals.
Singh explained that certain
methods of food production out
rage both vegetarians and non
vegetarians alike, who protest the

production as irresponsible, and
unnecessarily cruel. For example,
he noted that over half of all veal
production involves "crate farm
ing." This practice prevents the
growth of muscles and grisly meat
by raising calves in boxes too
small for free movement. Other
controversial practices include
tuna fishing with nets that fre
quently snag and drown other
animals, including species that
are along with the tuna.
Mills will present his argument
Saturday that humans are in fact
not designed to eat meat and it
is not a natural or necessary part
of their diet. Mills stated on a
recent KCBS radio interview that
meat-eating "is largely a phenom
enon of Western cultures. Proba
bly the mcyority of the world's
populations are vegetarians."
Vegetarians on campus some
times have a hard time getting a
good meal, especially in housing
serviced by Stanford University
Food Service according to some
co-op members. "It is pretty im
possible," said junior Marianna
Konradi, who became a vegetarian
after attending a SWOPSI course
last fall which raised her aware
ness about the treatment of
animals.
Glen Smith, who is a senior at
the Synergy house, feels that Food
Service vegetarian meals are often
repetitive and unappealing.
"Dorm vegetarian meals aren't
too attractive. There is definitely
a problem with food service."
Bill Carlstead, assistant mana
ger at Lucie Stern Hall Food Serv
ice defended the University's ef
forts to provide for vegetarians.
"It's hard to get away from the
egg-cheese syndrome, and we are
trying very hard to accomodate
for the . . . vegetarian students."
He pointed out that "there is no
lard" in any Food Service kitchen,
and they are trying to vary the
menu with new tofu, vegetable
and pasta dishes.
Students are encouraged to sug
gest recipes they would like
prepared, and Carlstead added
that students "deserve what they
want â€” they're paying for it."

ness of a meat-free diet.
Speakers will cover four major
aspects of vegetarianism. Cal
State-Hayward professor of

philosphy Steve Sapontzis will ar
gue in defense of animal rights.
Kim Sturla, executive director of
the Peninsula Society, will discuss
ways to improve the methods of
raising farm animals. Other
speakers will focus on whether
humans are designed to be meat
eaters and the impact of
vegetarianism on world food re
sources. Already 150 people have
pre-registered for the conference,
according to Inder Singh, co
founder of the Peninsula
Vegetarians and the fledgling
Stanford Vegetarians.
Stanford, with vegetarian
oriented houses such as Columbae
and Synergy, has a large vegetar
ian population. Singh claims there
are "a minimum of 500 or 600
vegetarians on campus," all of
whom have reasons varying from

social consciousness to social pres
sure for avoiding meat. He is
hoping to raise awareness on
campus and encourage students
to join the newly-formed Stanford
Vegetarians.
Reasons for giving up meat and
animal-related foods, range from
interest in one's personal health
to concern for world food
shortages, Singh said.
One consideration affecting
many vegetarians' decision to
forgo meat, according to Singh, is
the considerable difference be
tween the amount of calories of
fossil fuel expended to produce
one calorie of protein. For in
stance, 78 calories are needed for
one calorie of feedlot beef protein,
38 for milk, 3.6 for corn, and two
calories of fossil fuel go into
producing one calorie of soybean
protein.
Milton Mills, president of the
Stanford Medical Students Asso
ciation also points out that live
stock consume 80 percent of the
American grain production.
Another issue that has discour
aged some students from a meat
eating diet is the environmental
damage that raising livestock
causes in some areas of the world,
Singh said.
One well-known example of this
is the destruction of South Amer
ican rain forests to create short
term cattle grazing land, that
feeds animals used for beef by
North American chain restau
rants, he added.
Sapontzis argues that it is most
important "to be fair to animals"
in raising them for our consump
tion, and said "being nice" to
them is not the issue. Comparing
animal rights to the tradition of
human slavery, he feels that
animals, including chicken and
fish, are "exploited" for the in
dulgence of humans. He argues
that the practice of killing animals
in today's quantity and manner
takes unnecessary advantage of
animals.
Singh explained that certain
methods of food production out
rage both vegetarians and non
vegetarians alike, who protest the

production as irresponsible, and
unnecessarily cruel. For example,
he noted that over half of all veal
production involves "crate farm
ing." This practice prevents the
growth of muscles and grisly meat
by raising calves in boxes too
small for free movement. Other
controversial practices include
tuna fishing with nets that fre
quently snag and drown other
animals, including species that
are along with the tuna.
Mills will present his argument
Saturday that humans are in fact
not designed to eat meat and it
is not a natural or necessary part
of their diet. Mills stated on a
recent KCBS radio interview that
meat-eating "is largely a phenom
enon of Western cultures. Proba
bly the mcyority of the world's
populations are vegetarians."
Vegetarians on campus some
times have a hard time getting a
good meal, especially in housing
serviced by Stanford University
Food Service according to some
co-op members. "It is pretty im
possible," said junior Marianna
Konradi, who became a vegetarian
after attending a SWOPSI course
last fall which raised her aware
ness about the treatment of
animals.
Glen Smith, who is a senior at
the Synergy house, feels that Food
Service vegetarian meals are often
repetitive and unappealing.
"Dorm vegetarian meals aren't
too attractive. There is definitely
a problem with food service."
Bill Carlstead, assistant mana
ger at Lucie Stern Hall Food Serv
ice defended the University's ef
forts to provide for vegetarians.
"It's hard to get away from the
egg-cheese syndrome, and we are
trying very hard to accomodate
for the . . . vegetarian students."
He pointed out that "there is no
lard" in any Food Service kitchen,
and they are trying to vary the
menu with new tofu, vegetable
and pasta dishes.
Students are encouraged to sug
gest recipes they would like
prepared, and Carlstead added
that students "deserve what they
want â€” they're paying for it."
