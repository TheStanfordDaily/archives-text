# KZSU floats live bands across the waves this fall
## 
### 
Along with the Golden Gate Bridge,
Ghirardelli chocolate and fog-covered
beaches, local musicians are a scenic at
traction that's in Stanford's backyard.
The local music scene is one of the richest
and most diverse in the country, and it is
no wonder that much of the music that
finds its way up the charts originates right
here in the Bay Area.
Nearly two dozen clubs in San Francisco
and San Jose offer live music of every
conceivable style, while local bands like
Camper van Beethoven, Game Theory and
Voice Farm climb the charts nationwide.
But for many Stanford students, who lack
the time and the means to leave campus
on the weekends, this wealth of music has
been only talked of, never experienced
firsthand.
At least until now.
This fall, Stanford's radio station, KZSU,
will be featuring live music each week with
a new concert and interview series, titled
Friday Night Live. Each Friday night at 8
p.m., KZSU will present a different local
band live from its studios in Memorial Au
ditorium's basement. Featured this week
are Rough Trade recording artists, The
Ophelias.

'The idea behind Friday
Night Live was to put our
listeners in touch with the
current state of alterna
tive music'
— Steve Vernon

KZSU specializes in alternative modern
rock, though its programming includes jazz,
classic rock, dance music and reggae. The
station has been broadcasting at 90.1 FM
since 1964, and is run by student volun
teers.
"The idea behind Friday Night Live was
to put our listeners in touch with the cur
rent state of alternative music," explained
KZSU Promotions Director Steve Vernon.
"People can hear bands that may be im
portant in the future early in their careers,
and listen to them talk about themselves
and their music."
Several of the bands currently slated to
appear on the series are quickly moving
up the charts in modern music. Upcoming

artists include Beatnik Beatch, Dot 3 and
Scott Miller of Game Theory, a band
nominated for a Bammie last year for Out
standing Independent Album. Most of these
bands share what Vernon called the Bay
Area Sound, a mixture of "folky, bluesy
guitars" and aggressive, intellectual lyrics.
"The Ophelias are a great band to start
off the quarter," Vernon said. "They have
a very unique sound — a mixture of psy
chedelic rock and sharp, intelligent lyrics
with a little trumpet thrown in for fun."
Leslie Medford, founder of The Ophelias,
is a 1981 Stanford English graduate. Dur
ing his Stanford years, Mt-dford played
trumpet with the Stanford Band.
Since then, his group has put out two
albums and an Extended Play single. Their
latest release, "Oriental Head," came out
this summer and is still ranked in the top
50 of the College Music Journal.
"We've been pretty successful at bringing
in the bands we want," Vernon said. "Most
of these bands believe in the importance
of college radio, and KZSU seems to be
pretty well known. With the number of
interesting artists around today, this series
should be able to sustain itself for quite a
while," he explained.
