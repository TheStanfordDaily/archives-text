# Wrongful-death lawsuit against Stanford delayed
## 
### Brad Hayward 
A suit filed by the parents of Robert
Yuan last July against Stanford has been
delayed because University lawyers want
more time to respond to a requested change
in the location of the trial.
Yuan drowned in a canoeing accident
during last year's Senior Weekend at Stan
ford Sierra Camp. His parents, Mark Yuan
and Esther Yuan, are suing the University,
the Sierra Lodge and the Stanford Alumni
Association, which sponsored the weekend
retreat, for negligence.
The suit charges that negligence on be
half of the defendants resulted in Yuan's
death and asks for unspecified damages,
The Alumni Association, whose defense
is being handled by its insurance carrier,
CIGNA, has requested that the case be
tried in El Dorado County, where the ac
cident happened, instead of Santa Clara
County.
Jack Slobodin, attorney for the Yuans,
said he strongly opposes moving the place
of the trial. "The case belongs where it
is," he said, noting that cases are usually
filed where the defendants and witnesses
reside.
University staff counsel Tom Fenner said
the University "is in the process of dis
cussing with the Alumni Association how
the defense might best be handled." Fenner
has taken over the defense from Debra
Zumwalt, who had handled the case since
July.
The University asked for and was
granted an extension for responding to the
complaint. According to Fenner, the Uni

versity has approximately one more month
to respond. A trial date will then be set.
Yuan died May 8 after he and his friend
Terry Bernstein were canoeing in Fallen
Leaf Lake, located near South Lake Tahoe.
Their canoe capsized in cold, rough water,
and Bernstein swam until he was rescued
about 50 yards from shore. Yuan's body
was found face down in the water approx
imately 250 yards out.
Yuan's parents maintain that the three
defendants allowed Yuan and Bernstein to
canoe on the lake in hazardous conditions
"without adequate supervision, warnings
and other necessary safety precautions and
rescue procedures."
Slobodin said, "It was a Stanford trip.
If Stanford students go on a trip sponsored
by the University, [the University] has to
take it upon itself to provide a minimum
level of safety."
When the case was filed in July, several
University officials expressed surprise that
the Yuans would sue. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons said he was "surprised
because the University went to great
lengths to respond to both the situation
and to the grief of the family."
But according to Slobodin, "I think that
if people are negligent and responsible un
der the law, they shouldn't be surprised if
they are taken to court. They (the Yuans)
suffered a tremendous loss here, and they
are entitled to damages."
Fenner declined to comment "on the
merits of the case." Del McCarddel, the
CIGNA attorney representing the Alumni
Association, refused to comment about the
case.
