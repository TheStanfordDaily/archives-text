## Raymond Carver leaves final testimony to his talent 
### Where I'm Calling From" by Raymond Carver Little Brown, $19. 95 
Reviewed by Amor Towles
The new and selected stories collected
in Raymond Carver's last book "Where
I'm Calling From" are extremely con
sistent. With one exception, they are all
set in present day America and generally
focus on the relationships between
middle-aged men and women of the
lower-middle class. The ex-alcoholics,
former wives, bothersome mothers,
mysterious phone calls and sudden in
somnia fits threaded throughout the
stories further emphasize the collec
tion's continuity of setting.
Carver delivers his stories in a direct
conversational tone and steady tempo.
There is little evidence of surrealism,
Marxism, post-modernism or any other
literary influence. Events are related in
sequence and without overt mediation.
Instead, the stories are an even-keeled
delineation of details.
But it is at the level of detail that
Carver exercises his ingenuity and
craftsmanship. While the straightfor
ward nature of his narrative style sug
gests a smooth surface, isolated details
intimate an extreme range of emotions
that lurk slightly out of reach.
For instance, in one segment of the
story "Fat" (reprinted above), the
everyday details of a man turning off
a television, locking a door and unbut
toning his clothes accumulate with a
strange sense of menace. The narrator's
position on the bed and the removed
tone of her voice emphasize a violence
that is latent within the act of love that
Rudy is about to begin.
The concrete precision of description
in "Fat" gives these actions a quality
of inescapability and permanence. When
the story concludes 10 lines later, "My
life is going to change. I feel it", there
is the overwhelming sense that this
woman is wrong.
Much of Carver's earlier work paral

lels "Fat" thematically — his characters
are all trapped in empty, ugly lives.
But as Carver himself has com
mented, the dark quality of his earlier
work was in many ways a reflection of
his own circumstances. Carver married
as soon as he graduated high school and
quickly fathered two children. He went
to school days and worked blue-collar
jobs at night. During these "ferocious
years of parenting" and "unrelieved re
sponsibility," he became a chronic alco
holic and his marriage deteriorated.
In the late '70s, however, after a
divorce and drying out, Carver's life
turned around and he had new insight
into the possibilities of communication
and the redemptive powers of love and
faith.
These new feelings are evident
throughout Carver's later work. His
stories become more thematically and
linguistically complex as he examines

the full scope of the emotional ex
changes that were precluded from his
early writing. The new stories that close
"Where I'm Calling From" are the most
diverse and intricate of his career.
Throughout his life, Carver gestured
at the beauty and complexity of human
exchange through his perfect economy
of detail. As a whole, "Where I'm Calling
From" is an excellent representation of
these gestures and of the thematic shifts
that characterize Carver's life as well.
The reader, however, must finally decide
whether Carver's subtly changing vision
and style is in fact redundancy or rather
the components of variation that com
pose a carefully orchestrated piece of
music.
