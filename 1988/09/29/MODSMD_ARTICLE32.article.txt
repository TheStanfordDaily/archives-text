Raymond Carver (1939-1988)
When Raymond Carver died of cancer
on Aug. 2, this Country lost one of its
most important literary talents. Carver's
spare, taut prose, and eye for detail has
already inspired a generation of young
writers and will influence both his ad
mirers and critics for decades.
While his style is simple, Carver's
revelations are at once intense, beautiful
and bleak. His characters inhabit a
world frustrated by distance, violence

and isolation. Yet these characters sur
vive and, in the process, sometimes give
the reader a glimpse of what true com
munication might be like if it could only
overcome permanence and fate.
Carver was born in Clatskanie,
Oregon in 1939. He was a Stegner Fel
low at Stanford in 1973.
Among his books are "Will You Be
Quiet, Please?," "What We Talk About
When We Talk About Love" and "Ca
thedral. "
