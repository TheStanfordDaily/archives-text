Richard Ford, "Rock Springs" (Vintage Contemporaries, $6.95).
When "Rock Springs" first appeared in 1987, Ford assured his
reputation as one of the finest writers publishing today. Deeply
influenced by Raymond Carver's spare and taught style but un
encumbered by his cynacism, Ford's stories move those seeking
dignity and humanity in a world of regret. "Rock Springs" is now
available in paperback.
Harold Brodkey, "Stories In an Almost Classical Mode" (Knopf,
$24.95).
"Stories in an Almost Classical Mode" will be remembered as
perhaps the most significant publication of this decade. Compared
for his lyricism, theme and depth of vision to Whitman, Freud
and Proust, Brodkey's reputation is built largely on his one book,
"First Love and Other Sorrows," publications in"The New Yorker,"
"Esquire" and other literacy magazines, and on his long-awaited
Bildungsroman — in-progress House of Animals." Watch for an
upcoming review in The Daily.
Joel Kotkin and Yoriko Kishimoto, "The Third Century:
America's Resurgence In the Asian Era" (Crown, $19.95).
In a recent interview with The Daily, author and Stanford Busi
ness School graduate Yoriko Kishimoto said that the United States
must embrace the values of Asian and Hispanic immigrants if it
is to remain a vital economic player in the 21st century. Written
in the wake of Paul Kennedy and Allan Bloom, this book may
be one of the few optimistic predictions concerning America's
future.
