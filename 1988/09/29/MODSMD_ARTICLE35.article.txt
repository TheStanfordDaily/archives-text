On Nov. 8, nearly half of the
American electorate will stay
home. Among the poor, voter
turnout will be particularly low
— almost half the rate of the
affluent. In their book "Why
Americans Don't Vote," Frances
Piven and Richard Cloward ex
plain this state of affairs and
describe the institutional barriers
that force them to exclaim "the
United States [isj not a democracy
i/i the elementary sense of uni
versal suffrage."
While some political scientists
have advocated theories that
blame low voter turnout on the
lack of political interest in the
general public, Piven and Cloward
instead ask "where do these [apat
heticl ideas come from?"
They quickly reject Hans
Eulau's popular "politics of hap
piness" theory, which states that
citizens abstain from voting be
cause of their general contentment
and tacit approval of the political
system. "No one has satisfactorily
explained," write the authors,
"why 'the politics of happiness' is
so consistently concentrated
among the least well off."
Instead of explaining low voter
turnout with causes internal to
the voter such as the politics of

happiness argument, Piven and
Cloward seek external ex
planatory causes — causes im
bedded in the electoral system it
self. They point particularly to the
voter registration process. They
boldly hypothesize: "We think the
linchpin of the distorted American
democracy in the contemporary
period is the distinctive system of
voter registration procedures."
Although overt methods of po
litical exclusion such as poll taxes
and literacy tests have largely dis
appeared in the United States, the
authors note that their de facto
equivalents remain.
For instance, many counties
still have only one poorly-staffed
and under-advertised registration
office open solely during business
hours, making registration
"means-tested," open only to
those who have transportation
and who are able to take time

from work. Similarly, the com
plexity of the process as well as
bureaucratic indifference or even
hostility can make registration a
humiliating experience for less ed
ucated and less confident citizens.
The authors note that the
United States is also unique
among Western democracies in
that it has lacked a broad based
labor party, a fact that further
marginalizes lower class and mi
nority interests.
Piven and Cloward present a
lively anecdotal, statistical and le
gal analysis. They base their ar
guments not only upon their ac
ademic research but also on their
direct experiences in the vanguard
of the registration reform move
ment. This, combined with the au
thors' historical examination
(they see the defeat of William
Jennings Bryan and the Populist
Party in 1896 as the beginning of

mass voter demobilization) makes
the important and scholarly "Why
Americans Don't Vote" easily ac
cessible.
Piven and Cloward urge univer
sal access to registration — an
important initial step and vital
catalyst for the realization of dy
namic and responsive govern
ment. Far from dismissing failure
to vote as a sign of health, "Why
Americans Don't Vote" diagnoses
a long-ignored deeper institu
tional disease in our political sys
tem.
