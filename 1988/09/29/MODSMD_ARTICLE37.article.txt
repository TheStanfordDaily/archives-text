Berhane Andeberhan's wom
en's soccer squad left the cozy
confines of Harry Maloney Field
yesterday, embarking on a road
trip that will carry the team to
the Northeastern corner of the
country. After four consecutive
home appearances, Stanford will
face a difficult road trip with
matches against Providence to
morrow and Rhode Island on Sun
day.
The Cardinal cannot afford to
overlook today's opponent, how
ever. Indeed, the players will have
their hands more than full against
Connecticut. The Huskies, an
Eastern powerhouse, have started
quickly (5-0) and maintain an ex
cellent national ranking (number
five in the Gatorade National Col
lege Soccer Ranking). Connecti
cut's explosive start seems to be
indicative of its intentions to end
North Carolina's reign as peren
nial national champion.
In the face of such quality com
petition, the Stanford women
exude nothing but optimism. Re
ferring to the upcoming trip,
junior fullback Christine Martin
commented, "We're all very ex
cited. Last year we went to
Colorado, but a trip to the North
east will be a little more demand
ing. We are really playing well
right now, and we're looking for
ward to this opportunity."
Indeed, the Cardinal (3-2-1) has
an excellent opportunity. The ex
tremely young Stanford team
(seven freshmen and nine sopho
mores out of 23 players) is at a
crossroads this season. A strong
showing against UConn, coupled
with Stanford's impressive play

in a 3-2 overtime loss to Santa
Barbara (also in the Top 10 na
tionally) earlier this month, would
place Stanford right at the thresh
old of receiving nationwide re
spect.
Entering this weekend's three
game set, Andeberhan seems to
have the team well on its way to
achieving its immediate goal,
which is at least a No. 3 ranking
in the Western region.

A strong showing
against UConn would
place Stanford at the
threshold of receiving
national respect.

In only his second season,
Coach Andeberhan has observed,
as he phrases it, "incredible im
provement," not only in individual
talents but also in total team ef
fort. "This group of girls puts so
much emphasis on team offense
and team defense. If we had to
match up with some of these
teams one-on-one, we could not
stay with them," he said.
Maybe this unselfish play is at
the root of the team's improve
ment. After six games last season,
the team was winless on their
way to an unimpressive 4-10-4
season. That win total will, in all
probability, be surpassed by mid
season in 1988. In fact, with both
the improved level of play by all
team members and the ever
strengthening flow of youthful tal
ent into the program, the sky is
the limit for Andeberhan's troops.
