# Will the Sox fold again?

BOSTON (AP) — Can the Bos
ton Red Sox face the music in the
American League East, where the
theme song heading into the final
weekend of the regular season
seems to be, "You just keep me
hanging on"?
"We're still in the driver's seat,
and we're pretty good drivers,"
Red Sox reliever Bob Stanley said,
hopeful that his team has enough
gas in the engine for the stretch
drive.
The Red Sox led the Milwuakee
Brewers by 2 1/2 after Wednesday
night's contests.
The magic number is two for
eliminating Milwaukee and New
York and one for the Tigers and
Brewers.
The Toronto Blue Jays have
haunted Boston like a curse over
the past two weeks, winning four
of five games from the Red Sox
and raising the specter of previous
late-season collapses.
"They have no need to panic
now," Toronto's Jesse Barfield
said. "They still have the upper
hand. They're such an explosive

club they can turn this thing
around in a hurry."
But teammate Ernie Whitt re
members 1987, when the Blue
Jays blew a 3 1/2-game lead by
losing their final seven games to
finish second behind the Detroit
Tigers.
"It's in their hands. They have
to go out and win it," Whitt said.
Boston appeared headed for its
second division title in three sea
sons after taking two of three
games from the New York
Yankees last weekend. But the
Red Sox have stumbled against
the pesky Blue Jays, who have
won six straight at Fenway Park
and taken 10 of 12 games from
the Red Sox this season.
"Am I worried? Do I look it?"

Boston manager Joe Morgan said.
His reply was immediate: "I'll
let you know when I am."
Boston, which has a 35-42 road
record, ends the season with a
four-game series in Cleveland.
Meanwhile, the Yankees have
somehow remained in contention
for the playoffs despite dropping
five of seven games in two crucial
series against Boston.
"I guess we'd be a longshot,"
New York's Don Mattingly said.
"We just want to keep playing,"
he said. "Wc just want to play
hard every night and make them
win games."
The Yankees travel to Detroit
for a three-game weekend series.
If the Yankees have a chance to
win the division title, they will
play a makeup game Monday
against the Texas Rangers in
Yankee Stadium.
