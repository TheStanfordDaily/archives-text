SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
— Florence Griffith Joyner
twice broke the world record
in the 200 meters as she and
her sister-in-law each won an
other gold medal Thursday at
the Seoul Olympics, where the
U.S. women's basketball team
won the gold for the men.
Griffith Joyner broke the
world record in her qualifying
heat in 21.56 seconds, then
broke it again as she later won
the gold medal in 21.34. She
had already won the women's
100 meters.
The old world mark of 21.71
was shared by Marita Koch and
Heike Drechsler of East Ger
many.
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who
also won the heptathlon, added
the women's long jump title
with a leap of 24 feet, 3-and-l/2
inches, breaking her own
Olympic mark of 23-10 1/4, set
in winning the heptathlon in
1984.
Drechsler won the silver with
23-8 1/4, and the bronze went
to Galina Christiakova of the
Soviet Union at 23-4.
The American women beat
Yugoslavia 77-70 for the bas

ketball gold medal, providing
some consolation for Wednes
day night's 82-76 loss to the
Soviet Union in the men's
semifinal.
"The men didn't have a
chance to go for a gold, so we
wanted to keep the gold in our
program," Cynthia Cooper
said.
Teresa Edwards scored 14 of
her 18 points in the second half
when the United States took
command of Yugoslavia with a
12-6 run. The U.S. team led
by 17 points with less than five
minutes to play.
"It feels like we've finally
proven ourselves to be the
best," said Edwards, a veteran
of the 1984 gold-medal team
led by Cheryl Miller. "It feels
better this year because we got
it as a team, not with any in
dividuals."
America's boxers, mean
while, were colouring memor
ies of Montreal with six boxers
still alive for gold medals.
Three U.S. boxers — mem
bers of a team some had called

America's worst ever — advanced
to the finals Thursday morning,
and three more were waiting in
the wings. With eight boxers get
ting at least to the semifinals, the
U.S. team already was guaranteed
more total medals than the seven
from 1976.
In tennis, Steffi Graf of West
Germany moved into the women's
singles final with a 6-2, 6-0 victory
over American Zina Garrison. In
the final, she will meet Gabriela
Sabatini of Argentina, who lost to
Graf in the U.S. Open final.
Americans Ken Flach and
Robert Seguso, the No. 1 seeds,
defeated Czechoslovakians Milan
Srejber and Miloslav Mecir 6-2,
6-4, 6-1 to reach the doubles final

against Emilio Sanchez and Ser
gio Casal of Spain.
A doctor for the Canadian
Centre for Doping in Montreal,
meanwhile, revealed Wednesday
that Ben Johnson's male hormone
levels were so low when he won
the 100 meters last Saturday in
Seoul that it could only have been
from extended steroid use.
Johnson was stripped of the
gold medal when he tested positive
for steroids, but his agent had
said the sprinter was sabotaged
by a stranger with a bottle of
"sport drink" containing a "gooey
yellow substance" that smelled
bad.
The coordinator of doping con
trol here also said Johnson ad
mitted he took three medications,
one of them by injection, before
his race. One of them was a par
tially banned corticosteroid which
"could be suspicious," Dr. Lee In
joon said.
