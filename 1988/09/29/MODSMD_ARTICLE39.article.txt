SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
— Florence Griffith Joyner
twice broke the world record
in the 200 meters as she and
her sister-in-law each won an
other gold medal Thursday at
the Seoul Olympics, where the
U.S. women's basketball team
won the gold for the men.
Griffith Joyner broke the
world record in her qualifying
heat in 21.56 seconds, then
broke it again as she later won
the gold medal in 21.34. She
had already won the women's
100 meters.
The old world mark of 21.71
was shared by Marita Koch and
Heike Drechsler of East Ger
many.
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who
also won the heptathlon, added
the women's long jump title
with a leap of 24 feet, 3-and-l/2
inches, breaking her own
Olympic mark of 23-10 1/4, set
in winning the heptathlon in
1984.
Drechsler won the silver with
23-8 1/4, and the bronze went
to Galina Christiakova of the
Soviet Union at 23-4.
The American women beat
Yugoslavia 77-70 for the bas

ketball gold medal, providing
some consolation for Wednes
day night's 82-76 loss to the
Soviet Union in the men's
semifinal.
"The men didn't have a
chance to go for a gold, so we
wanted to keep the gold in our
program," Cynthia Cooper
said.
Teresa Edwards scored 14 of
her 18 points in the second half
when the United States took
command of Yugoslavia with a
12-6 run. The U.S. team led
by 17 points with less than five
minutes to play.
"It feels like we've finally
proven ourselves to be the
best," said Edwards, a veteran
of the 1984 gold-medal team
led by Cheryl Miller. "It feels
better this year because we got
it as a team, not with any in
dividuals."
America's boxers, mean
while, were colouring memor
ies of Montreal with six boxers
still alive for gold medals.
