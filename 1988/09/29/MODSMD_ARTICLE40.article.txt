SAN DIEGO (AP) â€” Orel Hershiser broke
Don Drysdale's record of consecutive scoreless
innings, shutting out San Diego for 10 innings
last night, but the Padres went on to beat the
Los Angeles Dodgers 2-1 in 16 innings.
Hershiser extended his streak to 59 innings,
surpassing the record set by Drysdale, also a Los
Angeles pitcher, in 1968.
With a crowd of 22,596 at Jack Murphy Sta
dium rooting for Hershiser in the ninth, the Los
Angeles right-hander got Tim Flannery to bounce
back to the mound and Tony Gwynn on a
grounder to second for the first two outs.
After Roberto Alomar's groundout to third
ended the inning, Hershiser was given a standing
ovation and his teammates rushed to the mound
to offer congratulations.
The fans also cheered when Hershiser came
to bat in the 10th with none out and Alfredo
Griffin, hit by a pitch, on first. Hershiser
sacrificed Griffin to second, but San Diego starter
Andy Hawkins retired Steve Sax and Franklin
Stubbs on grounders to end the threat.
With Drysdale, now a Dodgers broadcaster,
watching from the Los Angeles dugout, Hershiser
worked out of a jam in the bottom of the 10th
as the Padres got runners on second and third
with two out.
Leadoff batter Marvell Wynne, who already

had singled twice and was 10-for-28 lifetime
against Hershiser, struck out swinging but
reached first when the third strike bounced past
catcher Mike Scioscia.
Wynne became the first Sar. Diego baserunner
to reach second when he moved up on a sacrifice
bunt by Benito Santiago. Randy Ready grounded
out to shortstop, Wynne taking third, and Garry
Templeton was walked intentionally
Templeton reached second on catcher's indif
ference, Scioscia not attempting a throw, but
Hershiser got Keith Moreland on a fly to medium
right.
The fans gave Hershiser another standing ova
tion and his teammates mobbed him on the third
base foul line.
After Jesse Orosco took over at the start of
the 11th, Hershiser's streaks of nine complete
games and five shutouts were ended.
Hershiser threw 114 pitches, 74 of them
strikes.
It was Hershiser's second longest outing in six
major-league seasons. He pitched 10-plus innings
against Houston on June 19, 1987. Hershiser
had just the one intentional walk, struck out
three and gave up four singles, one each by
Flannery and Alomar and two by Wynne.
