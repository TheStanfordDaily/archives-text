# Highlights and lowlights of Seoul Olympics
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
There is no doubt about it. Korea is pulling
off a successful Games of the XXIV Olympiad.
A total of 160 countries, the most ever, are
participating. The Cold War is temporarily
forgotten (except by the us/them medal
counters). Steroids, not terrorists, have been
the only intruders into the international ath
letic spectacle. But everything in Seoul is not
running quite as smoothly as NBC would like
us to think.
Obviously the security in the Land of the
Morning Calm has to be tight. Between still
technically being at war with its northern
neighbor and the threats of Middle Eastern
and Asian terrorists, Korea has had to take
as many precautions as possible to make sure
another Munich does not occur. And on the
surface the Koreans have done a good job.
Three metal detectors/bag searches to enter
an event can be annoying, but it is under
standable. Even the five double-checks the
competitors must go through to reach their
rooms in the athletes' village, including one
to enter their building and another to reach
their hall, seem a little much but are probably
necessary.
The Koreans are not quite thorough in their
precautions, however. When a crowd formed
to enter the swimming finals right before the
gun went off, the guards just let everyone
through sans security check. Four spectators
were able to watch an evening of gymnastics
on three tickets. And two Americans got into
the swimming finals using preliminary tickets.
The Koreans also had great preparation for
the competitions themselves. Two state-of
the-art athletic complexes, including ten
arenas, natatoriums, velodromes, etc. were
constructed just for the games. But training
complexes were overlooked. There's only one

training track which track and field, basket
ball, wrestling, and boxing competitors have
had to share. After synchronized swimming
started, 600 swimmers had to train in one
five-lane pool.
But the most complaints can be heard re
garding the athletes' village.
The village looks like a massive high-rise
apartment complex. It is. Thousands of
Koreans are waiting to move in once the
Olympic flame is doused. Not exactly aestheti
cally pleasing. •
But that's only the beginning of the com
petitors' complaints.
Americans just love the communication sys
tem. Basically there isn't one. Not only don't
competitors have phones in their rooms, the
phones in each sport's office for the U.S. team
were yanked after the Americans accepted
$10,000 of collect calls in two days. So athletes
are forced to use payphones outside of the
buildings.
By consensus, the international lowlight is
the food. Because of the organization in the
dining room (one for 13,000 athletes), com
petitors stand in line at least a half hour to
receive their gourmet portions. And once they
reach the front? Well, Korean chefs have not
exactly mastered spaghetti or hamburgers yet.
Stanford's Patti Sue Plumer (track) has taken
to paying for meals in the Olympic Family
town. Carol Lewis is surviving on rice. Said
U.S. assistant swim coach Skip Kenney, "I
wish I had brought peanut butter and jelly.
I would have made a lot of money with the
U.S. team."
In general, the Korean people are very
friendly and are really trying to be helpful.
They've donated their time, their homes, and
their driving privileges (residents of Seoul can
only drive every other day depending on
license plate numbers in an attempt to lessen

the usual gridlock). One minor problem: the
officials and volunteers do not speak English,
or any language other than Korean for that
matter; nor do the official interpreters.
The Koreans working at the venues, the
media center, and the village who wear little
buttons stating "speak English" do not. But
they do not want to admit it, either. Simple
questions are turned into two-hour wild-goose
hunts.
Not only are Korean drivers psycho, turning
two lanes into five and merging while turning
a corner at 40 miles an hour, the taxi (Seoul's
universal transportation) drivers do not know
where the Olympic complexes are. The Olym
pic Park and Seoul Sports Complexes are
merely 10-15 acres each, are visible from miles
around, and have been under construction for
seven years. Obviously every Korean was not
as excited about the games as the government
officials.
The crowds are surprisingly anti-American.
At a United States-Czechoslovakia women's
basketball game, teachers told the 500 Korean
grammar school students to cheer for the un
derdog — Czechoslovakia. But that does not
explain why everyone else in the crowd except
the American fans was cheering against the
States. During the men's 100-meter dash,
guess who had the crowd behind him? No, it
was not Carl Lewis. Referees were also anti-
American, giving the rather masculine-looking
Czechoslovakian women a few too many
breaks.
But there were lots of highlights amongst
the organizational and communication mis
haps. Janet Evans' and Matt Biondi's swim
ming performances. Eastern European swim
mers leading the wave in the natatorium. A
little Japanese man jumping up and down
and leading the crowd in cheers. The friendli
ness of all of the international spectators.
Peace, harmony, progress. On to Barcelona.
