Art historian will
lecture on time-space
German art historian Ralf
Schiebler will give a free public
talk on "Giorgio de Chirico and
the Theory of Relativity" Wed
nesday, Oct. 5.
The event, which will take
place at 8:15 p.m. in Annenberg
Auditorium, will launch the fall
"Lectures in Art" series.
Schiebler, a lecturer at the
University of Hamburg, will
speak on the "metaphysical pe
riod" in the work of de Chirico.
At the beginning of the 20th
century, a new conception of
time and space was formulated
in physics. The revolution has
been connected with cubist or
rayonist art, but Schiebler will
argue that it was more closely
paralleled by the art of de
Chirico.

Columbia University on "Nature
and Culture in the Landscapes
of Corot";
• Nov. 2, Albert Elsen, Walter
