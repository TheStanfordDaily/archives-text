# Hazard speeds renovation
## Old Firehouse's deadly carpet found years ago but forgotten 
### Tim Marklein Editorial staff 
Urgency arose to renovate the
Old Firehouse last spring when
an engineer touring the building
discovered the carpet throughout
was made of an extremely hazar
dous material â€” a danger de
tected years earlier by University
officials.
According to Michael Ramsey-
Perez, coordinator of student af
fairs and overseer of the renova
tion project, the carpet could have
created a potentially fatal situa
tion in the event of a fire and he
speculated that renovation was
not taken care of earlier because
of bureaucratic oversight.
"Evidently, someone years ago
had pointed (the hazard) out,"
Ramsey-Perez said, adding that
"staff transitions" may have
prevented the problem from being
taken care of.
Lee Morgan, the facilities en
gineer who Ramsey-Perez said in
formed him of the danger,
declined to comment last night.
For the past 18 years, the Old
Firehouse has housed offices of
student organizations.
Ramsey-Perez suggested that
"the person who had responsibil
ity had left," and someone else
who was unaware of the problem
replaced him. Ramsey-Perez
added that such transitions are
common occurences in University
positions.

Ramsey-Perez said the carpet
had been in place since 1968,
when the building was left by the
student-volunteer fire department
which had occupied it until that
time. Ramsey-Perez said the en
gineer's comment during the in
spection was "the first time I
knew of the hazard."
During the planning stages of
the project, Ramsey-Perez said en
gineers toured the facility to ob
serve its problems and determine
plans to proceed. "The engineer
said that in case of a fire, the
smoke would be so heavy that you
would have a very difficult time
getting out," Ramsey-Perez said.
Ramsey-Perez also noted that
the carpeting created a unique
hazard because people are advised
to stay low to the ground during
a fire to avoid being engulfed in
smoke. Such an action during a
fire would put a person closer to
the hazard created by the carpet.
Although Ramsey-Perez was
unsure of the exact substance
which created the danger, he said
the problem was contained in the
backing of the "first generation
indoor-outdoor carpet" that was
used to cover the entire first floor
and the stairs leading to the sec
ond floor.
Ben Asaro, manager of special
projects for Facilities Project
Management, specified that the
unknown substance "could give
off noxious or poisonous gases."
Asaro, who approved the renova

tion, added that the danger was
"one of the reasons" that the proj
ect was approved and completed
so quickly.
Asoro also said he was not
aware of the danger, but he as
sumed the reason for installing
the particular type of carpeting
was "to keep moisture out and
(because) the carpet worked well
on the uneven floor" in the
Firehouse.
Despite the earlier plans to
renovate, which had been
projected to occur at a leisurely
pace, Ramsey-Perez noted that
the present clanger provided the
"impetus" for speedier action on
the project. "When we heard
about the carpet, we were able to
move forward with the long-range
plans," he said.
The renovation of the inside
and outside of the building cost
approximately $30,000, according
to Ramsey-Perez. An additional
cost will be incurred in the pur
chase of furniture, the details of
which are not finalized at this
point.
"Even used or refurbished
furniture isn't cheap," Ramsey-
Perez said, adding that new furni
ture may be purchased in order
to insure the quality and
durability of the refurbished
rooms.
Funding for the project came
from a combination of the
