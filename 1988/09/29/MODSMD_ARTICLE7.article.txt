# Concern raised over cultural program's support of union

### Ken Yew Staff writer 
In reaction to support for the United Stanford
Workers expressed by student sponsors at "The Fire
Within," Assoc. Dean of Residential Education Alice
Supton said yesterday that *he cultural program
should have included a counter viewpoint.
On stage, the Council of Presidents and the mi
nority groups, which sponsored Monday night's
event, expressed their support for the USW in their
ongoing labor negotiations with the University.
Supton said the groups sponsoring the event were
"very active, very articulate and very strong" groups
that are expected to make a strong political state
ment. She added that though "The Fire Within"
was generally positive, she wished non-USW faculty
and staff could have stood on stage with the workers.
The event was designed to introduce new students
to Stanford's ethnic diversity.
While not blaming the COP for showing their
support for the USW, Supton said she wished she
had known about the workers so that she could
have been able to give some constructive criticism
to the program coordinators before the event.
Three days before the program, the COP gave
Res Ed drafts of the speeches that were to be given
at the event, but Supton said she did not receive
the speech which introduced the workers.
The event was generally well received, however,
the endorsement of the USW at an Orientation event
made some students feel it was overly politicized.
Serra resident assistant Chris Page said "There

were a number of students who were kind of sur
prised at the politicizing" of the event. He felt the
USW endorsement was "inappropriate at an orien
tation with a captive audience."
Freshman Peter Chang said he felt some aliena
tion from the militant tone of the political messages.
"The acts were good," he said, but he added that
the speeches made him feel as if the groups were
trying to "separate themselves" from the rest of
the Stanford community.
But COP member Miguel M£rquez said many of
the students attending the event enjoyed it. He said
the honoring of the workers on stage showed ap
preciation for them and was one of the "highlights
of the show."
At the end of the event, nine University workers
were introduced to the audience. M&rquez told the
onlookers, "We felt it was important to note that
all people does not just mean all students. It means
all people."
Some of the workers on stage are directly involved
in the current negotiations between the USW and
the University. Marquez pointed out that there were
only two officers of the USW on stage.
M&rquez said the choice of the workers was based
on getting "as many different colored workers" as
possible on stage and not on representing people
involved in the labor negotiations.
Keith Archuleta, assistant dean of Student Affairs,
said "not everyone has to like everything" at an
event Like "The Fire Within." He said the political
issues raised are "not just liberal attitudes in the
abstract.
