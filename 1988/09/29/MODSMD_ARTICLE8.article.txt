# Cultures, Ideas and Values
## Area One requirement evolves 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
After months of heated debate on
campus and around the nation concern
ing the Area One requirement here, all
the shouting has quieted.
What remains is a transitional year
for the new Cultures, Ideas and Values
legislation, to be implemented in the fall
of 1989. Last year's heavily publicized
campus debate and subsequent approval
of CIV legislation has altered the current
nature of the required series.
Professors have begun modifying the
existing tracks to fit CIV standards, but
"the basic structure of Western Culture
is still in place," according to Values,
Technology, Science and Society instruc
tor Barry Katz.
In addition to the seven tracks in the
Western Culture program, there is one
"experimental" course this year. De
signed for a maximum of only 48 stu
dents, "Europe and the Americas" is
already following CIV guidelines.
The three course instructors — Asso
ciate Prof, of Spanish and Portugese
Mary Pratt, Anthropology Prof. Renato
Rosaldo and Classics and Comparative
Literature Prof. Gregson Davis — au
thored a statement last February which
was signed by 70 faculty members
showing their support for a change in
the Area One requirement.
According to Pratt, the Western Cul
ture Committee has approved the expe
rimental course for this year. But the
course's longevity can only be assured

by the approval of the Area One Com
mittee, a new committee which ensures
that all tracks conform to CIV stand
ards.
According to Pratt, her concern about
the course is not gaining the committee's
approval. Instead, the "hard part for the
track is getting enough depth of faculty"
to teach the coming year, she said.
Rosaldo added that the course is con
sidered "experimental" because the ex
tended debate before the CIV legislation
passed did not allow adequate time for
the preparation and presentation of a
syllabus. ,
History Prof. Paul Seaver, head of
the VTSS track, said that if CIV courses
are successfully developed, Stanford
would have made "the first successful
attempt in the country" at achieving a
world perspective of Western culture.
He added that the courses represent
the "wave of the future" because Stan
ford has forged new academic require
ments while "most universities have only
gone to World History or kept tradi
tional Western Civilization courses and
added (the study) of the Third World."
Some other Western Culture instruc
tors said they believe that whatever hap
pens with CIV next year, it will attract
the same national attention as the
debate that surrounded it last year
While many instructors are altering
their courses to meet these new rules,
the tracks have been evolving ever since
its inception in the 1980 autumn quar-
ter, according to some instructors.
History track chair Jim Sheehan
said his track is "always in the
process of review(ing)" their
classes.
The debate over the Area One
requirement began when some
argued that such changes in the
course were not taking place fast
enough.
A central argument surfaced
around the core reading list. The
new CIV ruling dropped that list,
allowing for a flexible system that
would provide for a yearly core
list of ideas and themes.
The legislation, passed by the
Faculty Senate last April, was
built in stages over several
months.
Although rumblings over the
Western Culture requirement go
back to its inception in 1980, the
Area One Task Force initiated the
bill in October 1987.
The Committee on Undergrad
uate Studies made further adjust

ments from November until late
March. Finally, suggestions from
the faculty, especially by those
who taught Area One classes,
aided in the development of the
ClV's ultimate form.
The legislation calls for six to
ten certified Area One tracks, but
it also leaves room for experimen
tal tracks, like the one this year.
CIV states that works by "wom
en, minorities and persons of
color" are to have an established
place in the program's readings.
Therefore, a course once criticized
for only requiring readings by
"dead, white, European males"
was changed to a multicultural
view of what it means to live in
American society.
In order to ensure that the
courses are fully employing the
CIV guidelines, the legislation
states the "Area One Program
shall be supervised by the Area
One Committee, which shall . . .
periodically evaluate the extent to
which the Area One requirement
is providing a common intellectual
experience for all Stanford stu
dents."
