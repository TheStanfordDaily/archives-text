# Stanford's commitment to safety of new Rains houses criticized
## 
### DJ Berinstein 
While the newly constructed
Lilior Green Rains Apartments
have helped alleviate the Uni
versity's housing shortage, com
munity members are not
pleased with how the University
has handled safety measures
that accompany the influx of
nearly 800 new residents.
"The University has fallen flat
on its face when it comes to
addressing safety issues," said
Jim Sizemore, a third year Ma
terial Sciences graduate student
and concerned parent of a three
year old child. For two years,
Sizemore has been living in Es
condido Village, housing for
graduate students and their
families.
Sizemore is one of many res
idents who is concerned that
children in the area will be af
fected by the increase in traffic
from Rains, a housing facility
for single graduate students lo
cated at the corner of Campus
Drive and Bowdoin Street and
extending to Escondido Road.
According to Sizemore, the

stop sign at the intersection of
Campus Drive and Bowdoin
Avenue is frequently run, and
cars speed on Bowdoin and
through surrounding areas,
making it unsafe for children
playing in Escondido to cross
streets.
Sizemore, an active member
of the Architectural Site Ap
proval Committee, said he was
told by University officials that
speed bumps and neighborhood
gates would be installed.
Keith Guy, director of
Housing and Food Services, said
the University made no such
promises.
The University Planning
Committee hired consultants to
observe traffic patterns and sug
gest solutions to make the area
safer and less congested, accord
ing to Guy.
In an effort to alleviate traffic,
the University submitted a pro
posal to the Santa Clara County
Planning Committee, according
to Guy and Philip Williams, di
rector of Planning. The first
part of the proposal entails con
struction of another entrance to

Rains from Campus Drive, Wil
liams said.
Few community members op
pose this construction, but some
are infuriated with the second
part of the proposal, which
would connect the parking lots
of Rains and Escondido Village
to help reduce the flow on ex
terior routes. But that connec
tion would be in front of Incre
ment 5, a building that houses
many children who would have
to cross that connection to get
to Bing, the nursery school at
tended by many of the children
in the area.
Community members have
formed a coalition consisting of
residents in Escondido Village,
College Terrace and Pine Hill
Faculty Residences. The coali
tion has succeeded in halting
construction of the connection
in front of Increment 5.
"It's just stupid engineering"
to connect two parking lots in
front of a child-populated area,
said Colin Mick, a representative
of the College Residents Terrace
Association.
