JAY McINERNEY
OCTOBER 4 • TUESDAY EVENING • 8 PM
Jay Mclnerney's first novel Bright Light, Big City burst
on the literary world in 1984, and the critics knew
immediately that Mclnerney was a writer whose voice
personified a new generation of writers.
Richly comic, shot through with dark realities.
The Story of My Life explores the limits of our times.
