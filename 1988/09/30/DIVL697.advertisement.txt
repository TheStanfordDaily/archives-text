Fresh pasta and seasonal salads.
Mesquite-grillcd spec ialties and stir-fried delicacie
New Italian entrees and select California wines.
Cocktails and company in a lively lounge.
Watch chefs at work in the exhibition kitchen,
Or clouds at play from the open-air patio.
Crisp white linen and baby grand piano,
It's pastel chic and California fresh.
