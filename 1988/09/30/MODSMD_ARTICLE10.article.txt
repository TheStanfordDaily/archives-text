## Shuttle blasts into space Launch successful, but heat is still on for crew 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
(AP) — Space shuttle Discovery
carried the American flag back
into orbit yesterday after a 32-
month absence, its five
astronauts riding a 700-foot tail
of flame from rockets
meticulously redesigned after
the Challenger disaster.
"Everyone certainly stood tall
today," said Kennedy Space Cen
ter director Forrest McCartney
as Discovery settled into orbit,
184 miles above Earth. Al
though the flight was going well,
a cooling system problem raised
the temperature in the cabin to
an uncomfortable 87 degrees
and Mission Control advised the
astronauts to drink at least
eight ounces of water every
hour.
Six hours after liftoff the crew
accomplished the main mission
of its flight, release of a $100-
million satellite that will give
NASA nearly constant commu

nication with future shuttle
missions.
"We sure appreciate your all
getting us up in orbit the way
we should be," Discovery's com
mander, Navy Capt. Frederick
Hauck, told Mission Control.
"We're looking forward to the
next four days — we have a lot
to do and we're going to have
a lot of fun doing it."
On their fifth turn around
Earth, mission specialist John
Lounge flipped switches that re
leased NASA's giant Tracking
and Data Relay Satellite from
Discovery's cargo bay.
The satellite is a twin of the
craft that was destroyed aboard
Challenger.
Launch, at 11:37 a.m. EDT,
came only after NASA waived
weather guidelines to allow for
flight through some lighter
than-usual Florida winds. The
98-minute delay simply
heightened the tension as NASA

unveiled a spaceship that un
derwent more than 400 modifi
cations since the Challenger
flight.
The astronauts had said all
along they were treating the
mission as a test mission — a
"shakedown flight," in the
words of Covey — and they
quickly ran into first-flight
problems. A water evaporator
that provides cooling to the ship
during the climb to space and
return to Earth was partly
clogged with ice. And a device
that provides electrical power to
move an orbital steering engine
was not working.
Neither problem was critical.
But to thaw the ice, engineers
raised the temperature of
radiators that line the inside of
the open cargo bay doors and
that in turn pushed up the cabin
temperature by more than 10
degrees and reused the humidity
to 43 percent.
