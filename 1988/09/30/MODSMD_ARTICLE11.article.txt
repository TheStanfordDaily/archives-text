U.S. and allies plan space station
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States and
11 allied countries signed an agreement yesterday
to build a $23 billion permanently manned space
station designed to serve as a stepping-stone for
human exploration of the solar system.
The facility, known as Space Station Freedom,
will be designed, developed, operated and used
by all of the partners, which include nine Euro
pean allies, Japan and Canada, in addition to
the United States.
The United States is providing $16 billion to
the program and the other partners are contri
buting more than $7 billion. The agreement was
formalized at a State Department signing cere
mony at which Secretary of State George Shultz
presided. Officials said it was a coincidence that
the agreement was signed on the same day that
the Discovery space shuttle was launched at Cape
Canaveral, Fla.
Lithuanians rally against police
MOSCOW (AP) — Thousands of Lithuanians
rallied in their capital yesterday to protest
beatings by police who broke up two nationalist
demonstrations and arrested at least 100 people,
a dissident said.
Neither the official Tass news agency or Radio
Moscow's international service on yesterday men

tioned the reported disturbances on the main
square of Vilnius.
Valdas Analauskas, a correspondent with the
dissident journal Express-Chronicle, said a pros
ecutor refused to file charges against those ar
rested during a demonstration Wednesday and
an overnight hunger strike on Gediminas Square.
Most of those arrested Were released yesterday,
but a large crowd gathered around the courthouse
where the remaining 20 people were to be tried
in a closed court session, Analauskas reported.
Instead, the 20 were released.
Carl Rowan case ends in mistrial
WASHINGTON (AP) — A judge yesterday
declared a mistrial in the weapons-possesion case
of syndicated columnist Carl Rowan after the
jury reported it was hopelessly deadlocked.
Earlier in the day, Judge Arthur Burnett of
District of Columbia Superior Court had re-read
his instructions to the jury after the 12-member
panel said it was unable to reach a verdict.
Rowan has been charged with using an unreg
istered handgun and ammunition to wound a
teen-aged intruder in the backyard of his home
last June. He faced a maximum penalty of two
years in prison and a $2,000 fine if convicted.
Burnett said he was convinced that further
deliberations would not lead to a verdict. The
jury had deliberated about nine hours over two
days.
