OSLO, Norway (AP) — Soldiers
on the front lines of the United
Nations' 40- year quest for peace
won the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize
yesterday for steadfast duty in the
cross fire of the world's conflicts.
The Nobel Committee said the
U.N. peacekeeping troops built
greater faith in the United Na
tions, which "has come to play a
more central part in world af
fairs."
U.N. leaders praised the award
but appealed again for the release
of a U.S. Marine kidnapped while
serving with U.N. peacekeepers
in Lebanon.
The award could bolster new
U.N. peacemaking efforts to over
see shaky truce agreements in the
Persian Gulf and Afghanistan.
In Jerusalem, peacekeepers
broke open bottles of champagne
to celebrate the prestigious award
as the word was passed by radio
from outpost to outpost. Five of
the seven peacekeeping forces are
in the Middle East.
"We are here to keep the peace,
but winning the Nobel prize
makes you feel good," said
Canadian trooper Tony Mayfield,
22, who guards a crossing point
between Greek and Turkish sec
tors of Nicosia, the capital of
Cyprus.
Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers
from more than 30 countries serve

under the U.N. flag. Peacekeepers
most recently were dispatched to
Iran and Iraq under a cease-fire
negotiated in the countries' 8-
year-long war.
"There is great joy," said Timor
Goskel, press representative for
the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon.
The citation from the Nobel
Committee, made up of five Nor

wegians, said the troops showed
the world's determination to set
tle disputes peacefully. It said they
"made a decisive contribution
towards the initiation of actual
peace negotiations."
Some peacekeepers carry light
arms, but they can fire only in
self-defense. The United Nations
says 733 peacekeepers have lost
their lives since 1948.
