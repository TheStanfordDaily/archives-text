RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP)
â€” Police shot and captured an
armed hijacker as he tried to
board a getaway plane with a
hostage in central Brazil yester
day, ending an ordeal that left
one person dead and four injured,
officials said.
The rest of the passengers and
crew of VASP Flight 375 were
released unharmed.
Authorities said the hijacker
killed the airliner's co-pilot and
wounded three other crew mem
bers. They described the hijacker
as mentally disturbed.
Federal Police Chief Romeu
Tuma told reporters in Goiania,
850 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro, that the hijacker sur
vived his hullet wounds and was
undergoing surgery. His condition
was not immediately known.
Tuma identified the hijacker as
Raimundo Conceicao, 28.

Holding a .38-caliber revolver
and taking the jet's pilot with
him, the hijacker descended from
the VASP Boeing 737 parked on
the runway of the Santa Genoveva
airport in Goiania.
A small Brazilian-made Ban
deirantes plane was to take him
and the pilot to Brasilia, the cap
ital, said air force spokesman Col.
Eden Avolinsque.
The hijacker had demanded to
talk to President Jose Sarney
about the country's economic pol
icies, which he thought were
wrong, said Coiania police spokes
man Morton Luiz.
"Police shot at him as he left
the plane and he turned around
and shot the Boeing pilot, whom
he had taken as his only hostage,"
Avolinsque told The Associated
Press in Brasilia. "He ran off into
the bushes, and police following
close behind shot . . . him."

Pilot Fernando Murillo Silva
was shot in the leg, Avolinsque
said.
"We had orders from the pres
ident not to negotiate with the
hijacker and not to refuel the
plane," Avolinsque said.
Hundreds of heavily armed
federal and state police and uni
formed army troops had sur
rounded the jet, isolated at the
end of a runway. VASP, a domes
tic carrier, is a Portuguese
acronym for Viacao Aerea Sao
Paulo.
VASP spokeswoman Mona
Cury said Flight 375 was on its
daily run from the Amazor jungle
city of Porto Velho to Rio on the
southeast Atlantic coast when it
was hijacked
The hijacker ordered the air
liner be flown to Brasilia but the
government refused to let it land,
said Luiz.
