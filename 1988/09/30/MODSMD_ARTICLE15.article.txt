Traditional first week
Tun' events should not
be left off the agenda

Frenzied is the only
WORD to describe the Ori
entation experience of incom
ing freshmen. Unfortunately, this
year's Orientation activities did
little to ease the stress.
In an effort to present the
serious, academic sides of Stanford
life, organizers omitted many of
the "fun" events which have
livened up Orientation Week in the
past.
There was no talent show. There
was no official Band rally. Instead,
more speeches, workshops and cur
ricula meetings filled the Orienta
tion agenda.
The organizing committee
decided to try to create a more
intellectual and academic atmos
phere during Orientation Week, re
jecting a program with more levity.
Assoc. Dean of Residential Educa
tion Alice Supton said many resi
dent fellows felt that past Orien
tation Weeks had been too "rah
rah" and hectic.
Before next year's opening activ
ities are planned, coordinators
must ask themselves one question:
Why must the academic side and
the fun side of life at Stanford be
mutually exclusive?
Last year's opening day began
with the usual introduction to
roommates and dorm life. The day
was spent meeting new people, un
packing and meeting more new
people.
Before frosh had a chance to
open their second suitcases, they
were whisked off to a welcome
from University President Donald
Kennedy and Dean of Undergrad

uate Admissions Jean Fetter, who
fueled the students' excited op
timism for the upcoming four
years.
The day came to a close when
the freshmen, most of whom did
not have time to read their
schedule and see what was next,
were unexpectedly invited to "fol
low the Band to Wilbur Hall."
In stark contrast, this year's
proceedings began with the usual
move-in, but there was not an of
ficial welcome or a Band rally to
wrap up the day.
Although a Band rally eventually
took place this year, it was only
because the "banned" Band per
formed on its own accord, against
organizers' wishes. Supton said or
ganizers expressed concern about
what the tone should be on arrival
day, therefore deciding to ban the
traditional rally.
The frosh talent show, which the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society was
ready and willing to plan, was
voted down by organizers. Supton
explained that having the show
later in the year would give the
event time to develop and become
"appropriate for Stanford," allud
ing to some questionable acts and
crowd responses in past years.
Although resident fellows and or
ganizing committees should be con
cerned that events remain under
control, they should not squelch
the excitement level of new stu
dents.
Stanford is a place of intensity
— both academic and social. New
students should learn that
firsthand when they arrive. As Ori
entation Week Coordinator Tom
McKean said last week: "How we
present ourselves to frosh (and
transfers) is how we are."
The balance needed to keep one's
sanity under the pressures of Stan
ford's academic setting must be
presented from the outset.
