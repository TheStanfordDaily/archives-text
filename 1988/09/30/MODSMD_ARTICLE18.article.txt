## Need to maintain a strong defense 
### 
WE HAVE ENTERED an era
where the dividing lines between
peace and war are less clearly
drawn than ever before, and this trend
is likely to accelerate in the 19905. We
and our allies now face a spectrum of
threats from overt military attacks to a
variety of lesser but equally dangerous
threats — including covert action, inter
nal subversion, pressure, intimidation,
and terrorism. To protect our security
interests against these threats, we must
be prepared to respond appropriately.
Our military forces must be so strong
that our capability to intervene militarily
around the world is unquestioned. But
the real question is: When and under
what circumstances should U.S. forces
intervene?
Before committing our forces to com
bat, we should first determine that:
1. Our vital interests are at stake.
2. The issues involved are so important
for the United States and our allies' fu
ture that we are prepared to commit
enough forces to win.
3. We have clearly defined political and
military objectives, which we must se
cure.
4. We have sized our forces to achieve
our objectives.
5. We have some reasonable assurance
of the support of the American people.
6. U.S. forces are committed to combat
only as a last resort.
In the decades ahead we must make
the most of the West's resources, playing
to our strengths. Advanced technologies
are critical to the West's defenses and
are made possible by our democratic sys

tem. We must protect our advanced tech
nology from the Soviet Union, which is
engaged in a constant effort, by purchase
and by theft, to acquire what they thus
far have not been able to develop for
themselves.
The Strategic Defense Initiative must
play a central role in our defenses in the
19905. It provides a far safer way to keep
the peace, moving the world away from
the threat of nuclear destruction, and
toward a greater reliance on defensive
systems.
One of the serious misconceptions is
that the United States alone is involved
in strategic defense. It is time to shed a
little glasnost on projects Moscow prefers
to shield in secrecy. (The USSR is deeply
involved in trying to develop its own
Strategic Defense Initiative, and has been
for nearly two decades.)
Overall, the Soviet Union has spent
$150 billion on all forms of strategic de
fense in the last 10 years alone while
purporting to adhere to the anti-ballistic
missile treaty and loudly decrying any
effort we make to acquire defenses
against their missiles. In contrast, in
1987 the United States was allowed by
our Congress to spend only $3.6 billion
on SDI, slightly more than 1 percent of
the U.S. defense budget.
In the past — throughout the 1950s
and 1960s with full prosperity — we have
spent nearly twice as large a percentage
of the gross national product on defense
as we do now. In fact, as recently as 1974
we were spending a larger portion of our
annual federal budget on defense than
we do today, even though the threats to

our freedom and security are greater now
than they were then.
Of course, we cannot and should not
carry the full burden ourselves. We must
have strong allies for our own security,
just as they need us to preserve their
own freedom. Isolationism represents a
recurring threat to us and our allies. It
has the potential to damage alliances,
hurt our economy and ultimately
threaten the security of the West. Fun
damentally, isolationism is the demagogic
and seductive offer of permanent peace
without effort or strength. Our policy is
not and never can be isolationist.
It is now the rage to predict the
downfall of the very fiber of the West
— in the economic, military, and moral
spheres.
The United States, as the world's
defender of freedom, has a difficult role.
It is the fate of defenders, who have no
aggressive plans, that they cannot choose
the time, place or method of attack.
Seeking to contain the level of future
conflict, we should work to reduce the
causes of conflict — political, economic
and social — before they lead to armed
conflict.
In summary, the most important chal
lenge we will face in the 1990s and beyond
is the same challenge we have faced since
our country's inception. We must per
suade the public, and thereby our
Congress, that we make the investments
necessary to preserve peace with free
dom.
