University is ignoring the safety of kids near Rains

IN THE SEPT. 27 article on Rains
housing it was stated that some
neighbors are against the complex.
Since I am one of those neighbors (I
live in Escondido Village) I would like
to set the record straight.
We in Escondido are Stanford stu
dents with very young children, mostly
preschoolers or young children in
elementary school. The neighborhood
that I live in is Increment V which has
75 family units. For several years now
very little has been done to even main
tain the existing safety items in our
neighborhood, let alone install proper
safety items to mitigate the effect of
the increased traffic due to the opening

of the Rains apartments. For example,
our existing gates are in disrepair,
signs are illegible, speed bumps
promised by the University have not
been installed, a child barrier between
the Rains parking and the Escondido
parking also promised by the Univer
sity does not exist, and so on. Obvi
ously the fact that we have been con
cerned about many of these problems
long before Rains construction began
means that we are not against Rains
or Rains' residents.
These issues have existed for years,
yet many Increment V people feel a
sense of futility. We are met with

answers like "there is no way we can
do that" or "it's not in the budget."
When plans are made they are re
ported to us, yet when our people
point out options these options are not
considered. Meaningful dialogue, where
we can give inputs and have them
fairly considered, does not seem to
exist between us and our landlord
(Stanford University). In fairness to
the University they have attempted to
satisfy our needs, yet the plans devel
oped unilaterally fall short of good
solutions.
Increment V residents are only one
group that is affected. A preschool, a

grade school, a recreation center,
several Palo Alto residences and several
faculty residences also border on Rains.
I hope meaningful dialogue and negoti
ations between the affected neighbors
(including ourselves), Rains' residents
and the University can be achieved.
And, as a result, I hope that good
decisions can be arrived at and imple
mented.
Finally, I want to appeal to Stanford
students, faculty and staff to support
this effort in whatever way possible.
