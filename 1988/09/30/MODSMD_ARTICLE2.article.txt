# Mob draws police to Flick
## Over-capacity crowd raises safety, control questions 
### Morgan Slain 
A rowdy crowd and charges of
safety violations marred Wednes
day night's ASSU Flicks 9:30 p.m.
showing of "Broadcast News."
Police were called to the scene,
but there were no injuries and no
arrests.
Although the Stanford Police
received an anonymous call saying
that at least one person had fallen
and was being trampled by a
shoving and crushing crowd
wedged at the entrance to
Memorial Auditorium, the report
turned out to be false, police said.
The Mem Aud entrance was not
the only trouble spot, though.
Movie-goers jammed the aisles,
creating a potential fire hazard.
One student, who wished to

remain anonymous, accused
Flicks personnel of committing a
"criminal act" by disregarding fire
safety codes. But the Flicks man
ager, Tim Cahill, objected to that
characterization. "We're students,
not professionals," he said. "It's
an extra-curricular activity, not
our job." Cahill added that the
Flicks staff did an "incredible" job
preventing injuries.
The police arrived at Mem Aud
just before 9:30 p.m., "and could
not get through the crowd, so they
called for more officers," said
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
The officers found no injured per
sons, he said, but some in the
crowd reported shoving matches
and small fights. Some people in
the crowd were intoxicated, he
said.

After finding that the four
ASSU door ushers had been "sim
ply overwhelmed" by the mob, the
officers recommended setting up
organized lines and barricades,
and then left, Herrington said.
"Flicks management needs to
review its policies, and see if they
can find a little better way to
manage the crowds when they
come in,"he said.
The anonymous student said he
approached a Flicks staffer and
warned her that the people sitting
in the aisles constituted a hazard.
She refused to respond, the stu
dent said. Cahill said he had not
heard about the incident.
Fire Inspector John Fricke of
the University Department of
Health and Safety confirmed that
"aisles must be kept clear and
unobstructed" under California
law.
Responding to the safety com
plaints, Cahill said that "people
were pushing so violently" that
"bursts of 20 to 30 people were
coming in"and pass-clickers
trying to count the people entering
couldn't keep an accurate tally.
Cahill said that once the click
ers' count reached 1,700 — the
capacity of Mem Aud — he
stopped letting people into the
theater. He attributed the people
in the aisles to inefficient seating
and to counting errors resulting
from the chaotic scene.
"I am a person very concerned
with safety," Cahill said. "I never

have approved of pushing and
shoving and paper-throwing. . . .
My staff did an incredible job in
preventing people from getting in
jured."
Flicks staff tried to open all four
Mem Aud front doors to ease the
crush, but there was no way to
keep the two middle doors open.
Cahill promised to consult with
maintenance workers to see if the
doors could be fixed.
Large, raucous crowds are a
"traditional problem for the first
night" of Flicks, Cahill said, but
he was "taken aback by the mag
nitude of the whole thing."
Cahill said he plans to increase
the size of the Flicks staff, and
rent a bullhorn to help with crowd
control. The problem would be
avoided if more people went to
the early showing of the movie,
Cahih concluded. Only about 150
people attended "Broadcast
News" at 7 p.m.
