# University waste storage is a threat to the community
## 
### 
It appears that Stanford University
is now looking to blame the "public"
for its recent 21 citations from the
California Department of Health Serv
ices regarding hazardous waste storage
violations at its incinerator (See the
Sept. 15 Times Tribune article). This
is most unfortunate, because the
"public" has no input to how Stanford
manages (or mismanages) its internal
affairs.
While it is good news that Stanford
is starting to clean up its toxic prob
lems and to comply with local, state
and federal laws, it is annoying to hear
Stanford continually make global state
ments concerning how safe incineration
is without supporting their statements
with facts.
And why should we believe them?
Stanford*B past health and safety
record hasn't won them favor in the

community. Take, for example, the
statement made recently by the director
of the Stanford Health and Safety De
partment that incineration is the best
and safest way to dispose of most
hazardous chemicals. But is this true?
Afid considering that this micro
region is classified as having one of
the highest levels of air pollution in
the Bay Area, is it appropriate to add
chemical, biological and radioactive
wastes to our already filthy air?
In the opinion of this community,
Stanford continues to lose credibility
with its continued flippant attitude by
making far-reaching statements like the
one stated above. This community is
concerned about the health and welfare
of our children, elderly, family mem
bers, friends and neighbors, and we do
not have a choice but to breathe the
air into which Stanford plans to send
its chemical, biological and radioactive
wastes.
Stanford has yet to show this com
munity that it is safe.
