# Bigotry does exist in the University's employment policy
## 
### 
I am writing in response to your
article about President Donald Ken
nedy's Orientation welcome address on
Friday night.
President Kennedy said, "Bigotry is
out!"
At this point, I would like to believe
this. However, I suggest people look at
past Stanford Daily articles which have
alluded to discriminatory practices
against minority workers (Caine Han
'85, Long Qach '88, Charlie Barnard
'88). There have been numerous letters
and articles about discrimination at
Tresidder Memorial Union, Food Serv
ice and at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.
I must also note that there used to
be an active Affirmative Action pro
gram for members of the United Stan
ford Workers union. The University
removed that language in the 1982

contract. This year the USW has asked
for committees on Affirmative Action
and Child Care in the present negotia
tions. The University response has
been negative. In essence, they want us
to choose between these. We've refused.
Workers do feel that bigotry and
discrimination exist at Stanford. They
live with it every day.
There are problems here, President
Kennedy. Let's move beyond rhetoric
and work together in solving these real
problems.
