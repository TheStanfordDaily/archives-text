USW presence at
'The Fire Within'
was appropriate
Despite three conversations with The
Daily about "The Fire Within" pro
gram, yesterday's article failed to con
vey accurately what I said about the
program. The Council of Presidents did
provide information about the introduc
tion of the United Stanford Workers
on the stage at the program. However,
I did not see that information before
the program.
"The Fire Within" was an excellent
program. New students were introduced
to Stanford's cultural diversity in a
positive, celebratory way. All of us

learned from the performances and
proud of the students who shared t
cultures.
I did not say to The Daily that the
program should have offered a counter
viewpoint. I did say that the presence
of the workers on stage was appropri
ate to "The Fire Within" for two
reasons. Workers contribute enor
mously to the University and their
work should be acknowledged and ap
preciated. Workers are part of the
Stanford community and should be
part of a program which celebrates the
cultural diversity of the community.
The inclusion of the USW members
was appropriate as a celebration of the
workers' contributions to Stanford; it
would not have been appropriate had it
been intended as a statement that new
students should endorse the union's
position in contract negotiations. (All

students will have opportunities to
become informed about the University
and USW positions on the current
labor negotiations and to form their
own opinions.)
I also told The Daily that once the
workers had been introduced and
brought on stage, I would have liked
the COP to invite other University
faculty and staff to join the workers
and students on the stage, to join to
gether in the singing of the song
which represented the way all of us at
Stanford need to stand together to
make our University a better, more
inclusive, more pluralistic community.
After this contract negotiation is
concluded, we will all be working side
by side. I would have liked the union
representatives and other University
staff to stand together for a moment to
express the fact that we will struggle

through the differences that exist and
will work together to make Stanford a
good place for all who work and study
here.

Orientation debate
coverage could give
a wrong impression
"Debate audience votes Capitalism
the Winner" (Sept. 27) gives readers
an inaccurate account of the question
put to the class of 1992 at the orienta
tion debate, and falsely reports the
results.
When a student asked the moderator

whether the vote was on the argu
ments they heard at the debate (Re
solved: Socialism Is More Just than
Capitalism) or what they thought gen
erally, she chose the latter. No formal
count was made of the results, but at
the end the moderator announced that
the capitalist side seemed to hold a
slight edge. This is confirmed by
Campus Report which says capitalism
appears to have won by a "small mar
gin.
Given the nature of the audience,
the newsworthy fact of this debate
might well be how many students saw
the ethical superiority of socialism, not
how many reaffirmed old loyalties. The
class of 1992 seems more open to a
critique of capitalism than your story
suggests.
