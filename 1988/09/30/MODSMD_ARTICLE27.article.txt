## A 						pork belly major? 
### 
According to last year's stu
dent directory, 341 Stanford un
dergraduates are majoring in
economics. Since many of us are
unfamiliar with exactly what it
is economics students study, I
thought I would provide
answers to two of the most fre
quently asked questions about
economics, which are (1) What
is economics? and (2) Is Elvis
alive?
I realize that the second ques
tion does not seem to have any
actual relevance to the discus
sion of economics, although
some are quick to point out that
Milton Friedman first burst
upon the national scene right
after Elvis purportedly died.
(The title page of his bestseller
"Free to Choose" can be sung
to the tune of "Blue Suede
Shoes." Believe it. . . ominous
pause. . . or not.)
The term "economic" is
derived from the Old English
"econommick," which consists
of the roots "econom-," meaning

Hardly a day goes
by that I don't find
a pork belly lying
around my house
and say to myself,
'Andrew, you really
should trade this
on the com
modities ex
change.'

"to save" and "-mick," meaning
"to have lips the size of a toaster
oven." Lately, new word a have
been coined to express the con
cept of economics on a larger
scale, including "Macro
economics," "Big Macroeconom
ics" and "Big Macro*
economics with cheese."
Up until the mid-seventeenth
century there was no real need
for economics since there was
no money. If you wanted to pur
chase a household appliance,
which in those days often meant
someone's daughter, you would
simply engage in a practice
known as bartering.
For instance, to begin with I
might offer two cows and five
chickens for your daughter. You
would then pretend to have been
terribly insulted and reply that
you could accept nothing less
than three cows and eight chick
ens. After an hour or two of this
dickering we might eventually
agree on three cows, three chick
ens and a sheep to be named
later.
Such bartering worked fine
until the invention of the wallet
in 1657 and the subsequent dis
covery that you couldn't fit
more than two, maybe three
chickens at best into the darned
thing.
Since the very first
Economists (Adam and Eve
Smith), many men and women
have made a name for them
selves in the profession, most
notably John Kenneth Gallblad
der who first demonstrated that
"Time Is Money," particularly
when it is in the form of a Rolex.
These days, modern
economists have many exciting
ways of making money, the
most popular of which is the
stock market.

The stock market is located
in New York, but not the part
of New York where, according
to such reputable publications
as The New York Post, HEAD
LESS MODELS ARE FOUND
SELLING CHILI DOGS, or
PSYCHIC WATER BUF
FALOES APPEAR ON LATE
NIGHT TELEVISION. No, this
is the peaceful and civilized part
of New York known as Wall
Street, where seldom is heard
a discouraging word and the
skies are not cloudy all day. Ex
cept for the two or three hun
dred stockbrokers per day who
cloud up the skies by jumping
out of the 13th floor of their
office building after investing in
a stock such as Consolidated
Mismanagement.
You make money on the stock
market by purchasing a piece of
paper known as a "share." This
share gives you title to a tiny
part of a certain corporation. In
a smaller corporation this may
mean you own, say, a stapler;
in a larger corporation you may
actually own a cute receptionist.
Unfortunately, you don't actu
ally get to take the receptionist
home as a personal playmate,
although if you could it would
certainly bring new meaning to
the phrase "My stock went
down."

When you are ready to sell your
stock you contact a professional
stock seller known as a broker.
Look in the yellow pages under
"Broker," or for the better ones,
under "Brokest." The broker will
then t&ke your piece of paper and
go onto the floor of the stock ex
change (known as the "floor") and
will wave the piece of paper
around and scream really loud un
til somebody gets annoyed and
buys the damned thing just to
shut her up.
At the end of the trading day
the broker takes commission out
of your profit and asks you if you
would like to put the rest of the
money on an account or a gift
certificate.
And if you just can't get into

the stock market you might try
trading in commodities. Instead
of dealing in meaningless, worth
less pieces of paper like in the
stock market, in the commodities
market you trade extremely use
ful everyday objects such as pork
bellies. Hardly a day goes by that
I don't find a pork Ibelly lying
around my house and say to
myself, "Andrew, you really
should trade this on the com
modities exchange."
So, in short, I urge you to be
come active in the stock market.
With such a variety of stocks and
commodities available there is
something for everyone. I would
recommend beginning with a
simple over-the-counter stock.
Over-the-counter stocks are lo
cated above the toothpaste and
next to the condoms. Consult your
pharmacist.

stock seller known as a broker.
Look in the yellow pages under
"Broker," or for the better ones,
under "Brokest." The broker will
then t&ke your piece of paper and
go onto the floor of the stock ex
change (known as the "floor") and
will wave the piece of paper
around and scream really loud un
til somebody gets annoyed and
buys the damned thing just to
shut her up.
At the end of the trading day
the broker takes commission out
of your profit and asks you if you
would like to put the rest of the
money on an account or a gift
certificate.
And if you just can't get into

the stock market you might try
trading in commodities. Instead
of dealing in meaningless, worth
less pieces of paper like in the
stock market, in the commodities
market you trade extremely use
ful everyday objects such as pork
bellies. Hardly a day goes by that
I don't find a pork Ibelly lying
around my house and say to
myself, "Andrew, you really
should trade this on the com
modities exchange."
So, in short, I urge you to be
come active in the stock market.
With such a variety of stocks and
commodities available there is
something for everyone. I would
recommend beginning with a
simple over-the-counter stock.
Over-the-counter stocks are lo
cated above the toothpaste and
next to the condoms. Consult your
pharmacist.

According to last year's stu
dent directory, 341 Stanford un
dergraduates are majoring in
economics. Since many of us are
unfamiliar with exactly what it
is economics students study, I
thought I would provide
answers to two of the most fre
quently asked questions about
economics, which are (1) What
is economics? and (2) Is Elvis
alive?
I realize that the second ques
tion does not seem to have any
actual relevance to the discus
sion of economics, although
some are quick to point out that
Milton Friedman first burst
upon the national scene right
after Elvis purportedly died.
(The title page of his bestseller
"Free to Choose" can be sung
to the tune of "Blue Suede
Shoes." Believe it. . . ominous
pause. . . or not.)
The term "economic" is
derived from the Old English
"econommick," which consists
of the roots "econom-," meaning

Hardly a day goes
by that I don't find
a pork belly lying
around my house
and say to myself,
'Andrew, you really
should trade this
on the com
modities ex
change.'

"to save" and "-mick," meaning
"to have lips the size of a toaster
oven." Lately, new word a have
been coined to express the con
cept of economics on a larger
scale, including "Macro
economics," "Big Macroeconom
ics" and "Big Macro*
economics with cheese."
Up until the mid-seventeenth
century there was no real need
for economics since there was
no money. If you wanted to pur
chase a household appliance,
which in those days often meant
someone's daughter, you would
simply engage in a practice
known as bartering.
For instance, to begin with I
might offer two cows and five
chickens for your daughter. You
would then pretend to have been
terribly insulted and reply that
you could accept nothing less
than three cows and eight chick
ens. After an hour or two of this
dickering we might eventually
agree on three cows, three chick
ens and a sheep to be named
later.
Such bartering worked fine
until the invention of the wallet
in 1657 and the subsequent dis
covery that you couldn't fit
more than two, maybe three
chickens at best into the darned
thing.
Since the very first
Economists (Adam and Eve
Smith), many men and women
have made a name for them
selves in the profession, most
notably John Kenneth Gallblad
der who first demonstrated that
"Time Is Money," particularly
when it is in the form of a Rolex.
These days, modern
economists have many exciting
ways of making money, the
most popular of which is the
stock market.

The stock market is located
in New York, but not the part
of New York where, according
to such reputable publications
as The New York Post, HEAD
LESS MODELS ARE FOUND
SELLING CHILI DOGS, or
PSYCHIC WATER BUF
FALOES APPEAR ON LATE
NIGHT TELEVISION. No, this
is the peaceful and civilized part
of New York known as Wall
Street, where seldom is heard
a discouraging word and the
skies are not cloudy all day. Ex
cept for the two or three hun
dred stockbrokers per day who
cloud up the skies by jumping
out of the 13th floor of their
office building after investing in
a stock such as Consolidated
Mismanagement.
You make money on the stock
market by purchasing a piece of
paper known as a "share." This
share gives you title to a tiny
part of a certain corporation. In
a smaller corporation this may
mean you own, say, a stapler;
in a larger corporation you may
actually own a cute receptionist.
Unfortunately, you don't actu
ally get to take the receptionist
home as a personal playmate,
although if you could it would
certainly bring new meaning to
the phrase "My stock went
down."
