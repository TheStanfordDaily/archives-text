## A
						pork belly major? 
### 
According to last year's stu
dent directory, 341 Stanford un
dergraduates are majoring in
economics. Since many of us are
unfamiliar with exactly what it
is economics students study, I
thought I would provide
answers to two of the most fre
quently asked questions about
economics, which are (1) What
is economics? and (2) Is Elvis
alive?
I realize that the second ques
tion does not seem to have any
actual relevance to the discus
sion of economics, although
some are quick to point out that
Milton Friedman first burst
upon the national scene right
after Elvis purportedly died.
(The title page of his bestseller
"Free to Choose" can be sung
to the tune of "Blue Suede
Shoes." Believe it. . . ominous
pause. . . or not.)
The term "economic" is
derived from the Old English
"econommick," which consists
of the roots "econom-," meaning

Hardly a day goes
by that I don't find
a pork belly lying
around my house
and say to myself,
'Andrew, you really
should trade this
on the com
modities ex
change.'

"to save" and "-mick," meaning
"to have lips the size of a toaster
oven." Lately, new word a have
been coined to express the con
cept of economics on a larger
scale, including "Macro
economics," "Big Macroeconom
ics" and "Big Macro*
economics with cheese."
Up until the mid-seventeenth
century there was no real need
for economics since there was
no money. If you wanted to pur
chase a household appliance,
which in those days often meant
someone's daughter, you would
simply engage in a practice
known as bartering.
For instance, to begin with I
might offer two cows and five
chickens for your daughter. You
would then pretend to have been
terribly insulted and reply that
you could accept nothing less
than three cows and eight chick
ens. After an hour or two of this
dickering we might eventually
agree on three cows, three chick
ens and a sheep to be named
later.
Such bartering worked fine
until the invention of the wallet
in 1657 and the subsequent dis
covery that you couldn't fit
more than two, maybe three
chickens at best into the darned
thing.
Since the very first
Economists (Adam and Eve
Smith), many men and women
have made a name for them
selves in the profession, most
notably John Kenneth Gallblad
der who first demonstrated that
"Time Is Money," particularly
when it is in the form of a Rolex.
These days, modern
economists have many exciting
ways of making money, the
most popular of which is the
stock market.

The stock market is located
in New York, but not the part
of New York where, according
to such reputable publications
as The New York Post, HEAD
LESS MODELS ARE FOUND
SELLING CHILI DOGS, or
PSYCHIC WATER BUF
FALOES APPEAR ON LATE
NIGHT TELEVISION. No, this
is the peaceful and civilized part
of New York known as Wall
Street, where seldom is heard
a discouraging word and the
skies are not cloudy all day. Ex
cept for the two or three hun
dred stockbrokers per day who
cloud up the skies by jumping
out of the 13th floor of their
office building after investing in
a stock such as Consolidated
Mismanagement.
You make money on the stock
market by purchasing a piece of
paper known as a "share." This
share gives you title to a tiny
part of a certain corporation. In
a smaller corporation this may
mean you own, say, a stapler;
in a larger corporation you may
actually own a cute receptionist.
Unfortunately, you don't actu
ally get to take the receptionist
home as a personal playmate,
although if you could it would
certainly bring new meaning to
the phrase "My stock went
down."
