# Food for thought and fun
## Study breaks from chips to stuffed bananas spice up dorm life 
### Mica Martin 
The question is: to go or not
to go? The house meeting may be
long and you have reading stacked
up to your waist. Nonetheless,
your mind is not on the words,
but on the hollow craving of your
stomach. Food accompanies house
meetings, and a study break
would hit the spot. You go.
As Stanford students break
back into their studious modes
they are also finding creative ways
to keep spirits high by preparing
and enjoying study breaks, typi
cally for house gatherings on
Tuesday or Wednesday nights.
Senior Lynn Vojvodich, a resi
dent assistant at Storey House,
describes study breaks as an op
portunity for students to "get to
gether, have some food and hang
out." This description seems to
apply to most dorms on campus.
The specifics of study breaks in
each dorm and the motivation for
having them, however, varies de
pending on who lives there and
the dorm's dining system.
Gail Mackauf, a senior and
second-year RA, has already seen
many differences in study breaks
between Rinconada, an all
freshman dorm where she lived
last year, and the upperclass Al
pha Sjgma House where she now
resides. Students in Rinconada eat
in a University Food Service
dining hall, while Alpha Sig res
idents hire a cook and have access
to an open kitchen. Mackauf said
this affects the need for and ap
peal of study breaks.
"Last year they were important
to attract people to meetings,
bring house together and to get
people talking about classes," she
said.
At Alpha Sig, food-oriented
breaks alone would not draw stu-

With all this hoopla over the tradition of study breaks and
all the calories that house RA's burn while planning an in-house
food festival, The Daily decided to do a little investigative jour
nalism. Despite the evidence in favor of study breaks as a Stanford
tradition, the average Jane and Leland on their early quarter
trot from the Post Office to the Bookstore still remain a little
unclear on the concept. Study Breaks ? Food? you ask. Precisely.
That's our question and here are the responses:
"It was tasty."
—Larry Schloss, Freshman (Paloma)
"We had cookies and soft drinks and afterwards —
about midnight — a bunch of people went out and
played volleyball."
—Dave Scudamore, Freshman (Ujamaa)
"We had a study break with Bazooka gum, moon pie
and apple juice — and that's true."
—Sue Biggins, Junior (Robinson)
"Study break? When was that?"
— Branden Hsu, Freshman (Alondra)
"I don't know, I wasn't there, I was off planning a
study break for someone else."
—Ziad Sarkis, Senior (Casa Italiana)
"Best food since home."
—Elizabeth Coleman, Sophomore (Potter)
"Study break? I don't think the Suites have study
breaks???"
—Paul Muhl, Senior (Suites)
"I live off campus."
— Rene Eiffert, Senior (Off-campus)

dents together. Instead, the dorm
offers a Thursday night Party Se
ries, which Mackauf described as
"social and very party oriented."
About $50 of dorm funds are set
aside to cover expenses for each
of these events.
Ice cream is a study break snack
that many dorms serve in at least
as many ways. Scott Horowitz, an
RA at all-freshmen Larkin House,

referred to a treat planned by the
Larkin staff called "Rain Gutter
Sundaes." These are several long
troughs filled with ice cream,
sauces, nuts, whipped cream and
other appropriate ammunition for
the post-study break food fight
that almost always inevitably
ensues.
Toyon RAs have also dared to
tempt students with a similar
mountainous ice cream study
break, according to RA Jessica
Evans, proving that not only
freshmen enjoy their food frolics.
According to Frank Beadle, an
other RA at Toyon, a goal in plan
ning study breaks is to keep them
inventive and varied. "People
seem to get tired of milk and
cookies very quickly," Beadle said.
Incorporating Entertainment
into the study break is an addi
tional incentive used to draw stu
dents together.
Beadle said that along with the
requisite food, Toyon Resident
Fellow Bill Durham had prepared
a special slide show detailing Stan
ford's involvement in the local

communities for the first Toyon
meeting.
Though some study breaks are
funded by dorm dues, many are
paid for by the residents who plan
the break. An average of 75 cents
per person is spent in most dorms.
At Casa Zapata, health concerns
often figure into the student
planned study breaks, according
to RA Lara Gomez.
"[Students] tend to eat a lot of
junk food in college so you have
to strike a balance between what
people want to eat and healthy
food," Gomez said. Homemade
Mexican dishes will do just that
for at least one break this year
at Casa Zapata, she said.
"Roasted Banana Boats," which
are bananas sliced open, stuffed
with chocolate chips and
marshmallows, and then roasted,
are Mackaufs suggestion for a
great study break.
