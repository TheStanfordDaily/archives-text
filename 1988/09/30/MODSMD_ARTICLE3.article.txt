## Andersson named to new Humanities and Sciences post 
### Eric Grunwald 
German Prof. Theodore An
dersson recently became the fifth
associate dean of the Humanities
and Sciences Department, alleviat
ing concern that the department
was underrepresented by the
dean's office.
According to Humanities and
Sciences Dean Ewart Thomas, An
dersson — who will serve a three
year deanship — will concentrate
his efforts in the language and
literature departments.
The Stanford Board of Trustees
approved Andersson's appoint
ment in a meeting earlier this
month; the appointment retroac
tively took effect Sept. 1.
"He has always impressed me
as a very wise, erudite scholar.
He can always be relied on to
make penetrating judgments,"
Thomas said in praise of An
dersson.
Describing him as a true
"humanist," Thomas said An
dersson is a well-known scholar,
an excellent translator and "one
of the cream of the faculty." There

are now three professors repre
senting the Humanities and
Sciences Department under
Thomas.
Thomas explained that An
dersson will educate the dean's
office about the literature and lan
guage departments. "I want him
to represent them to us, and in
return, represent our plans to
them."
Thomas summed up the ap
pointment by saying that An
dersson will be an "active inter
preter" for the department.
Thomas himself is a dean over
seeing the German Studies De
partment and the Food Research
Institute.
Saying he was surprised when
Thomas offered him the post in
June, Andersson said he favored
the concept of bringing together
the literary departments so that
they could work as a unified body.
Andersson — who has been act
ing dean since Sept. 1 — said he
finds his position "very interest
ing" because he is learning how
the University operates at a
dean's level.

The five associate deans will
meet with Thomas weekly to dis
cuss concerns between the dean's
office and the departments which
they oversee.
Andersson said his new position
will not prevent him from con
tinuing to teach in the German
Department.
