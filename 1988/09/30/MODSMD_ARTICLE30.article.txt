# INTERVIEW
## So you wanna be a comedian? 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
Editor's note: Comedian Will Durst,
34, is a favorite at comedy clubs both
in the Bay Area and across the coun
try. The political emphasis of his
humor appeals to a more well-read
audience than that of some other con
temporary comics.
After spending seven years at the
University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee
studying journalism, theater and film,
Durst moved out to the West Coast on
November 4, 1979 (coincidentally, he
notes, "the date the hostages were
taken ").
Besides doing hundreds of shows a
year, he also writes a regular column
in "Just for Laughs," a free comedy
magazine distributed at comedy clubs,
and also contributes to many other
humor publications. His weekly polit
ical column will be appearing in the
San Francisco Examiner until the No
vember election.
lie lives with his wife, Debi, another
local comedienne who he met eight
years ago in a comedy club.
Durst will be appearing this Sunday
at the Cavalcade of Comedy in Frost
Ampitheatre. He took time out from
his busy schedule this week to talk
with The Daily about life as a profes
sional stand-up comedian, a job he
says he would give up "only if there
was a professional pinball circuit."
Daily: Where was the first place
you ever performed your material?
Durst: My place was called The
Rusty Nail in Milwaukee, across from
the Milwaukee School of Engineering.
Every Monday night we would have
to shut down the Foosball tables and
all the engineering students got
REALLY pissed. They were there
every week, so you constantly had to
change your material.
Otherwise they would be chugging
their 24-ounce beers and yelling out
your punch lines before you did.
It was an interesting crucible to
learn in, that you constantly had to
keep shifting material, which is not
something that most people who start
out have to do. I think it was a good
learning experience.
Daily: Is it the ultimate goal of
stand-up comics to become famous
nationwide?
Durst: I don't know if that's in the
cards for me. I don't know if political
comedy really has that kind of an
outlet available to itself right now.
I just want to earn a living, you
know. And right now I'm making a
living at my chosen craft. I don't see

myself with my picture on the cover
of TV Guide or anything.
Daily: Would you like to get into
movies?
Durst: I'd like to do some acting
but I'm real wary, because the char
acter I do on stage is a distillation of
me. I mean it's really me on stage,
but it's the smartest and the bravest
and all the "-ests" of me.
I want to maintain the credibility
of my stage persona; I don't want to
be a doofus in a movie or something.
I want to pick and choose my parts
kind of carefully cause I worry about
hurting this thing that I love which
is stand-up
Daily: Do you find that people ex
pect you to be exactly like your stage
character when you're not on stage?
Durst: A little bit, but it's not that
great of a character; it's not that great
of a leap from who I really am so it's
not really that hard. I don't think
people expect me to be 'on' all the
time.

Daily: Is it possible you'll be a stand
up comic for the rest of your working
career?
Durst: I would like to. I don't want
to be doing one-nighters in Chico the
rest of my life, but I really enjoy going
out there on a cold stage and making
people laugh out loud on purpose. I
really like that.
Daily: What's the best thing about
being a stand-up comic?
Durst: [pausing to think] The love.
The love that you give to an audience.
Daily: And the worst?
Durst: The money. It's such a pain
in the ass trying to spend it all.
Daily: What does a typical day look
like in your life? I guess everybody
figures a stand-up comic just sits
around all day and thinks up jokes.
Durst: I write a lot. I pretty much
wake up about 9:00 or 10:00. I get
out the papers and walk the dog, then
go to the office and write and make
phone calls, and then I go home and

classes was how to read the newspaper."
