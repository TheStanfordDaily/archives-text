# INTERVIEW
## So you wanna be a comedian? 
### Andrew Berkowitz Editorial staff 
Editor's note: Comedian Will Durst,
34, is a favorite at comedy clubs both
in the Bay Area and across the coun
try. The political emphasis of his
humor appeals to a more well-read
audience than that of some other con
temporary comics.
After spending seven years at the
University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee
studying journalism, theater and film,
Durst moved out to the West Coast on
November 4, 1979 (coincidentally, he
notes, "the date the hostages were
taken ").
Besides doing hundreds of shows a
year, he also writes a regular column
in "Just for Laughs," a free comedy
magazine distributed at comedy clubs,
and also contributes to many other
humor publications. His weekly polit
ical column will be appearing in the
San Francisco Examiner until the No
vember election.
lie lives with his wife, Debi, another
local comedienne who he met eight
years ago in a comedy club.
Durst will be appearing this Sunday
at the Cavalcade of Comedy in Frost
Ampitheatre. He took time out from
his busy schedule this week to talk
with The Daily about life as a profes
sional stand-up comedian, a job he
says he would give up "only if there
was a professional pinball circuit."
Daily: Where was the first place
you ever performed your material?
Durst: My place was called The
Rusty Nail in Milwaukee, across from
the Milwaukee School of Engineering.
Every Monday night we would have
to shut down the Foosball tables and
all the engineering students got
REALLY pissed. They were there
every week, so you constantly had to
change your material.
Otherwise they would be chugging
their 24-ounce beers and yelling out
your punch lines before you did.
It was an interesting crucible to
learn in, that you constantly had to
keep shifting material, which is not
something that most people who start
out have to do. I think it was a good
learning experience.
Daily: Is it the ultimate goal of
stand-up comics to become famous
nationwide?
Durst: I don't know if that's in the
cards for me. I don't know if political
comedy really has that kind of an
outlet available to itself right now.
I just want to earn a living, you
know. And right now I'm making a
living at my chosen craft. I don't see

myself with my picture on the cover
of TV Guide or anything.
Daily: Would you like to get into
movies?
Durst: I'd like to do some acting
but I'm real wary, because the char
acter I do on stage is a distillation of
me. I mean it's really me on stage,
but it's the smartest and the bravest
and all the "-ests" of me.
I want to maintain the credibility
of my stage persona; I don't want to
be a doofus in a movie or something.
I want to pick and choose my parts
kind of carefully cause I worry about
hurting this thing that I love which
is stand-up
Daily: Do you find that people ex
pect you to be exactly like your stage
character when you're not on stage?
Durst: A little bit, but it's not that
great of a character; it's not that great
of a leap from who I really am so it's
not really that hard. I don't think
people expect me to be 'on' all the
time.

Daily: Is it possible you'll be a stand
up comic for the rest of your working
career?
Durst: I would like to. I don't want
to be doing one-nighters in Chico the
rest of my life, but I really enjoy going
out there on a cold stage and making
people laugh out loud on purpose. I
really like that.
Daily: What's the best thing about
being a stand-up comic?
Durst: [pausing to think] The love.
The love that you give to an audience.
Daily: And the worst?
Durst: The money. It's such a pain
in the ass trying to spend it all.
Daily: What does a typical day look
like in your life? I guess everybody
figures a stand-up comic just sits
around all day and thinks up jokes.
Durst: I write a lot. I pretty much
wake up about 9:00 or 10:00. I get
out the papers and walk the dog, then
go to the office and write and make
phone calls, and then I go home and

classes was how to read the newspaper."
have dinner. And then about 9:00

Daily: Do you perform every
ni>fht?
Durst: Pretty much. Last year
I did 444 gigs. Paid gigs. Plus
benefits and stuff.
Daily: Do you still get nervous
going up there?
Durst: Every single time! Every
single time. I pace. I pace before
1 go on. Sometimes I hit my head
against a wall and mutter to
myself what toads the audiences
are. I build up this adversarial
relationship.
Daily: Why?
Durst: I don't know. It just
works for me.
Daily: Who do you find make
the best audiences for your type
of humor?
Durst: Anybody who reads. I
like adults.
Daily: How are college stu
dents?
Durst: College students, uh,
they don't read newspapers cause
they're too busy reading assigned
texts.
Sometimes they can be wonder
ful, and other times they can be
indifferent. They really don't care
about what I'm talking about.
Daily: What do you do when
you get on stage with an audience
that obviously isn't right for your
material?
Durst: Well, then I change my
material. I don't proselytize. I
mean, if they don't find what I'm
doing funny I have plenty of sex
and drug and 7-11 jokes that I
can go back to.
My job is to make them laugh.
That's why I'm getting paid. And
if I ever want to get hired again
by the guy who hired me I gotta
make that audience laugh.
Daily: Where do you try out
your new material? On stage or
at your house....?
Durst: Both. I try it out on
paper just to try to get the timing

down. Then I go to the stage and
play with it. Usually it takes like
three or four times to figure out
if a line has merit, or what to
change where. Maybe change a
preposition here or do the set-up
twice. Maybe change the set-up
and the punchline around.
There's many ways you can play
with a line. I'm very line oriented.
I pretty much do just one-liners
up there. I gotta make it sound
colloquial, like I'm just talking,
very conversational. So it takes
me a while.
Daily: It sounds as if it would
be hard to go from writing on
paper to sounding spontaneous
and colloquial out loud.
Durst: There are two different
voices, one is for writing, and it's
an entirely different voice than the

one that you use in stand-up. You
get to take more time with a joke
[on paper] where in stand-up you
can't do two-minute set-ups.
Daily: What's the best way
you'd recommend of breaking
into the business for someone
who wants to be a stand-up com
ic.
Durst: Just keep doing it. Work
wherever you can. The only ones
who are still doing it are the ones
who never quit.
Daily: What's it like at home
with two comedians?
Durst: It's normal. Trust me.
It's really normal. It's mundanely,
disgustingly normal.
Daily: Who would you liken
your malerial to most?
Durst: Bugs Bunny, actually.
It's true. Kind of an anti
authoritarian smart-ass, but still
kind of loveable.
