## The 						best (unknown) band in America 
### Gene Anaya Staff writer 
This year, 1988, has become
known as a year of the eights
— the Crazy B's that is. In the
past six years this Corvallis,
Oregon-based band has gone
from opening at parties and in
clubs at Oregon State to releas
ing their third album, "Out of
the Way," on their own indepen
dent Red Rum label in 1987.
Their debut album, "Law and
Order," released in 1984, intro
duced the B's to those outside
the Pacific Northwest, selling a
healthy 15,000 copies.
The title track became a fa
vorite among college radio sta
tions, as did the title track and
"Touchy Situations" from "Ner
vous in Suburbia," their second
album.
Powerhouse songs like "Naked
Party," which Portland's Or
egonian describes as "a shouting
call to party arms [and] the best
song the band has ever commit
ted to vinyl," and "One World
Vision" (with a guest appearance
by Robert Cray Band keyboar
dist Peter Boe) are sure to es
tablish "Out of the Way" as their
most successful album to date.
The Oregonian says "'Out of
the Way' is, simply put, the best
locally produced album of 1987."
Leading the Crazy B's on their
road to success is singer/
songwriter/saxophonist sex
therapist Todd Duncan. The
horn duo of Danny Schauffler
on sax and Tim Tubb on trom
bone is widely considered the
best new horn mini-section on
the scene. "Naked Party" is also
an example of the superb guitar
work being done by Mark
Wanaka.
And the B's unique sound
would be incomplete without the
full-scale support of percus
sionist Carl Smith (on conga,
bongos, timbals, cowbells and a

cymbal), drummer Rick Wash
ington and bassist Mike Tegan.
Eager to bring their original
reggae/ska/funk/rap/thrash/pop
sound to their predominantly
college-aged fans, the B's are
touring the western United
States in support of their latest
vinyl release, including their ap
pearance at the Tresidder
"Celebration" party tonight.
In their young history they've
opened for such acts as The
Class, Shriekback, Fishbone,
The Red Hot Chili Peppers,
Oingo Boingo and The Violent
Femmes.
The B's have developed their

own unique style on stage, even
topping the stage, on rare occa
sion, clad in dresses, slips and
pantyhose.
Regardless of their dress, they
are considered by many in the
Northwest and elsewhere to be
the best live band on the under
ground scene today, packing 'em
in during gigs at places like
Chicago's famous Park West and
college campuses across the
country.
As many have pointed out, in
cluding CMJ New Music Report,
this may be your last opportu
nity to see and hear the Crazy
B's before they become super
stars.

You can catch The Crazy B's
tonight at the Tresidder
"Celebration" blowout party.
At 9 p.m. the music begins on
the Tresidder back patio with
Zulu Spear, a hard-driving
reggae, Afro-beat, South African
fusion band. Next, Dr. Loco and
the Corrido Boogie Band will
play, bringing a sound which
they describe as "Latin jazz,
howlin' blues, Carribean cum
bias and Mexican corridos with
a rock 'n roll beat."
Finally, the Crazy B's, the fea
tured band, come on a little after
11 p.m.
