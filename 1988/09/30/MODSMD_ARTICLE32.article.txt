## Cardinal set to battle the luck of the Irish No. 5 Notre Dame hosts Stanford tomorrow 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
After having experienced a
year's worth of frustrations in
only three games, the Stanford
football team now has an oppor
tunity to erase the season's woes
in a hurry.
The Cardinal faces the fifth
ranked Notre Dame Fighting
Irish tomorrow and if Stanford,
a 14-point underdog, can pull off
an upset, a huge positive tone will
be set for the rest of the season.
Stanford is currently 1-2, 0-2 in
the Pacific 10 Conference.
The game, which starts at 4:00
PDT, will be telecast nationally
on ESPN.
The Irish are off to a 3-0 start,
including a 52-7 mauling of
Purdue last week. But Notre
Dame has not started 4-0 since a
Gerry Faust-led squad won its
first four in 1982.
"Notre Dame's a big game,"
Stanford quarterback Brian
Johnson said, summing up the
situation.
Irish Coach Lou Holtz thinks
the Cardinal has a shot at upset
ting his team. "We haven't faced
an offense with the flexibility of
Stanford," he said, adding that
"Brian Johnson is an outstanding
quarterback." Johnson completed
20 of 40 passes for 241 yards last
week at Oregon.
The key for Stanford is offen
sive production, something lack
ing against Oregon last week. The
Cardinal defense held the 20th
ranked Ducks to seven points, but
Stanford could muster only three.
Things don't get any easier this
week as Notre Dame's defense is
allowing only nine points a game,

and has allowed only 10 over the
past two weeks.
Stanford's defense is allowing
only 13.7 points a game, however,
good for 18th in the nation, and
the Cardinal is not in awe of the
Irish's combination of talent and
tradition. "Notre Dame, to me, is
just another team to play," cor
nerback Kevin Scott said. "I think
the Pac-10 is one of the toughest
conferences in the country. We'll
just go out and play hard."
Leading the way for Stanford
will be the defense, specifically the
defensive line. All-America candi
dates Lester Archambeau (left
tackle) and Ray Huckestein
(noseguard) were both injured
against Oregon, but both are ex
pected to play tomorrow. Archam
beau re-injured his knee and
missed the last eight minutes of
the game while Huckestein has a
sprained foot.
Those two, along with right
tackle Scott Palmbush, have
played very well thus far and
should be able to put pressure on
the Notre Dame offense.
Holtz has stressed the impor
tance of passing the ball this
week, showing a healthy respect
for the Cardinal front seven. In
fact, at the end of a press confer
ence Monday, Holtz said, "Let me
ask you a question. What's the
injury report on that defensive
tackle (Archambeau)?" When told
he would play, Holtz replied "OK,
that's what I wanted to know."
When the Irish run the ball,
which has been almost always this
season, inside linebacker Jono
Tunnney will be in there often as
well. He has led the Cardinal in
tackles in all three contests this
season and is currently atop the

Pac-10 in that category with an
18.7 average per game.
Offensively, Stanford hopes to
break out of the slump that hit
last weekend. The team moved
the ball but could not come up
with the big play when necessary,
leaving John Hopkins' 51-yard
field goal — the longest in the
Pac-10 this year — all alone on
its side of the scoreboard.
The offense feels the game was
an anomaly, however, and is
prepared to bounce back. "We're
planning on going in and pouring
it on against Notre Dame," Elway
said.
The Cardinal continues to be
without one of its top weapons
from last year, wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey. McCaffrey is still nurs
ing a deep thigh bruise suffered
at the start of fall practice. Tight
end Jim Price, however, should
see a lot of playing time as he is
almost recovered from an ankle
injury. Additionally, fullback
Tommy Vardell may see playing
time as his broken foot is almost
healed.
"I think overall we're happy
where we're at, but not satisfied
[on defensel," Elway said. "[Of
fensively] our own execution . . .
certainly wasn't what it needs to
be to have a balanced attack and
put points on the board."
And all it takes is one game to
turn things around.
Card notes
The game will also be televised live
on X-TV, channel 10, for all you
SUNet viewers. They will be using
the ESPN feed and the ESPN com
mentators, Mike Patrick and Kevin
Kiley.

"Brian Johnson is an outstanding
quarterback." Johnson completed
20 of 40 passes for 241 yards last
week at Oregon.
The key for Stanford is offen
sive production, something lack
ing against Oregon last week. The
Cardinal defense held the 20th
ranked Ducks to seven points, but
Stanford could muster only three.
Things don't get any easier this
week as Notre Dame's defense is
allowing only nine points a game,

and has allowed only 10 over the
past two weeks.
Stanford's defense is allowing
only 13.7 points a game, however,
good for 18th in the nation, and
the Cardinal is not in awe of the
Irish's combination of talent and
tradition. "Notre Dame, to me, is
just another team to play," cor
nerback Kevin Scott said. "I think
the Pac-10 is one of the toughest
conferences in the country. We'll
just go out and play hard."
Leading the way for Stanford
will be the defense, specifically the
defensive line. All-America candi
dates Lester Archambeau (left
tackle) and Ray Huckestein
(noseguard) were both injured
against Oregon, but both are ex
pected to play tomorrow. Archam
beau re-injured his knee and
missed the last eight minutes of
the game while Huckestein has a
sprained foot.
Those two, along with right
tackle Scott Palmbush, have
played very well thus far and
should be able to put pressure on
the Notre Dame offense.
Holtz has stressed the impor
tance of passing the ball this
week, showing a healthy respect
for the Cardinal front seven. In
fact, at the end of a press confer
ence Monday, Holtz said, "Let me
ask you a question. What's the
injury report on that defensive
tackle (Archambeau)?" When told
he would play, Holtz replied "OK,
that's what I wanted to know."
When the Irish run the ball,
which has been almost always this
season, inside linebacker Jono
Tunnney will be in there often as
well. He has led the Cardinal in
tackles in all three contests this
season and is currently atop the

Pac-10 in that category with an
18.7 average per game.
Offensively, Stanford hopes to
break out of the slump that hit
last weekend. The team moved
the ball but could not come up
with the big play when necessary,
leaving John Hopkins' 51-yard
field goal — the longest in the
Pac-10 this year — all alone on
its side of the scoreboard.
The offense feels the game was
an anomaly, however, and is
prepared to bounce back. "We're
planning on going in and pouring
it on against Notre Dame," Elway
said.
The Cardinal continues to be
without one of its top weapons
from last year, wide receiver Ed
McCaffrey. McCaffrey is still nurs
ing a deep thigh bruise suffered
at the start of fall practice. Tight
end Jim Price, however, should
see a lot of playing time as he is
almost recovered from an ankle
injury. Additionally, fullback
Tommy Vardell may see playing
time as his broken foot is almost
healed.
"I think overall we're happy
where we're at, but not satisfied
[on defensel," Elway said. "[Of
fensively] our own execution . . .
certainly wasn't what it needs to
be to have a balanced attack and
put points on the board."
And all it takes is one game to
turn things around.
