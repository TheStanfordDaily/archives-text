# Water polo to face a tough field
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Five of the nation's top six water polo teams
Will visit deGuerre Pool this weekend for the
annual Northern California Tournament. And
the host squad, the young but talented Car
dinal, seeks to move up in the national
rankings with a home-pool victory.
Joining the third-ranked Stanford team will
be the top-ranked and undefeated UCLA
squad, second-ranked California, fourth-rated
Southern California, and sixth-ranked UC-
Santa Barbara.
In addition, four other top-ten teams, UC-
Irvine, UC-San Diego, Fresno State, and Navy
will be among the twelve-team field competing
today and tomorrow in what Stanford coach
Dante Dettamanti calls the toughest tourna
ment in the country.
Coming off a win in the Air Force Tour
nament, the Cardinal will be aiming not only
for extra tallies in its win column, but also
to improve its NCAA playoff chances.
Although this season was orginally labeled
a rebuilding year because the squad consists
primarily of freshmen and sophomores, the
Cardinal has already risen from fifth to third
in the polls on the strength of its tournament
victory, its win over USC September 16, and
its 10-3 record.

With the field divided into four three-team
brackets, Stanford will face UC-Davis in its
first game Friday, at 10 a.m., and will play
UCSB at 6 p.m. The winner of each bracket
advances to the semifinals on Saturday. "Our
toughest game will be against Santa Barbara,"
Dettamanti said. "They are a good team but
are redshirting a number of freshmen. If we
play our best we should beat them."
If everything goes according to the seedings,
Stanford, UCLA, Cal and USC will advance
to the semis on Saturday, at 3 and 4 p.m. If
this is the case, Stanford will face the
currently-undefeated Bruins, who were 10-5
victors in the squads' previous faceoff earlier
in the season at a tournament in Irvine.
"UCLA is a really good team this year, and
they have been playing really well lately,"
Dettamanti said. "They beat us pretty con
vincingly and we are looking forward to facing
them again."
According to junior Steve Millham, the Car
dinal's mqjor flaw in the loss to UCLA was
its inability to adjust to the Bruins' defensive
alignment, so the squad has put in extra time
this week practicing a new offense in case the
two teams face off Saturday.
"We have to play a really good game against
UCLA if we hope to win," driver Colin Keely
said. "No one has really tested the Bruins
yet. We have a better chance against them at

home than we did at Irvine."
To emerge victorious, the Cardinal's de
fense, which has been its strong point so far
this season, will have to remain solid, and its
offense will have to show that it has jelled by
being able to move the ball well and get off
good shots. And according to Dettamanti, after
eight months of experimentation the offense
finally has the right personnel in the right
positions.

No one has really tested the
Bruins yet. We have a better
chance against them at home
than we did at Irvine.'

But Stanford cannot only concentrate on
the Bruins. The squad also has to take Santa
Barbara seriously, as. it cannot afford a loss
to the Gauchos. "It is really important to stay
in the top three in the rankings for our NCAA
chances," Keely said. "We need to knock off
someone above us, but we also cannot afford
to lose to a team below us, so Santa Barbara
is just as important as UCLA."
