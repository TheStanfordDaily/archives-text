SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
— Louise Ritter of Dallas upset
the Bulgarian world record
holder for the women's high
jump gold medal at the Seoul
Olympics on Friday, where the
net gain for America was: one
silver and another shot at gold.
The U.S. men's volleyball
team, incited by America's bas
ketball loss, earned the right
to defend its Olympic title by
beating Brazil Friday, but
American Tim Mayotte could
do no better than silver in the
first men's tennis gold medal
final at the Games in 64 years.
Ritter, meanwhile, won the
gold with a leap of 6 feet 8
inches, beating Bulgarian
Stefka Kostadinova, who had
6'7". Tamara Bykova of the So
viet Union won the bronze with
6'6".
The undefeated U.S. men's
volleyball, led by the spiking
and blocking of Bob Ctvrtlik,
scored an easy 15-3, 15-5, 15-11
semifinal victory over Brazil in
a rematch of the gold-medal
game four years ago in Los An
geles.
"Most of us used to play bas
ketball, and we felt really hor
rible for them when they lost
to the Soviets," Ctvrtlik said.

"We didn't want that to happen
to us." The U.S. men will
meet either the Soviet Union
or Argentina in the volleyball
final Sunday afternoon.
The Soviet Union, mean
while, beat Yugoslavia 76-63
for the basketball gold, giving
the Soviets their 100 th medal
of the Games.
Miloslav Mecir, of Czechoslo
vakia, beat the American
Mayotte 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 for
the men's singles gold medal,
the first awarded at the Games
since 1924 in Paris. Brad Gil
bert of the United States and
Stefan Edberg of Sweden each
won bronze
Mecir, who beat the top
seeded Edberg in the semi
finals, lost the first set in just
40 minutes but just as quickly
turned it around. He broke
Mayotte in the first game of
the second set and begean run
ning the American all over the
court.
When it was over, Mecir was
the one running all over the
court, throwing his racket up
in exultation over the biggest
victory of his career.
On Thursday, Florence Grif-

fith Joyner fulfilled predictions of
"something unbelievable" by her
husband, A 1 Joyner, breaking the
200-meter world record twice in
two hours.
"Two world records, two gold
medals and I'm not finished," Flo
Jo said.
She and record-smashing sister
in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee high
lighted a day at the Games that
belonged to the women. Joyner-
Kersee won the long jump, and
the U.S. women's team won the
basketball gold medal that the
men couldn't.
The United States' can-do
boxers, meanwhile, had Ameri
cans wondering: Can this be
Montreal all over again? This
was called America's worst Olym
pic boxing team — no names, no
flash, no chance. But U.S. boxers
already are assured of eight
medals — one more than they
won in '76 — and they'll be going
for six golds this weekend, one
more than in Montreal.
On the track Friday, Steve
Cram of Britain and American
Steve Scott moved smartly
through the semifinals of the
1,500 meters. Cram, 1984 silver
medalist, coasted to second in his
heat in 3:38.30, and Scott rallied
in the homestretch to win his heat
in 3:38.20.
They both reached the final Sat
urday of a race weakened by the
withdrawal of Said Aouita of
Morocco and Joaquim Cruz of
Brazil. Aouita has an injured left
hamstring, and Cruz simply said
he was not mentally ready to run.
The heavily favored U.S. men's
1,600-meter relay team was the
fastest by more than three
seconds over Kenya in qualifying
Friday. The American men, who
have won the race 12 of the 16

Two British athletes, mean
while, tested positive for drugs in
their first tests, the British Olym
pic Committee confirmed Friday.
They came from track and field
and judo, but the committee said
their names will not be released
until the International Olympic
Committee completes its hearing
procedures, perhaps by Saturday.
Eight athletes, including 100-
meter world record-holder Ben
Johnson of Canada, have been
kicked out of the Games so far
for drugs.
Griffith Joyner, her long hair
flowing behind her like the con
trails of a jet, first broke the
record in the semifinals, running
21.56.
Then, in the final, she sped to
a time of 21.34, lowering the mark
for the second time in two hours,
and adding the 200 to the 100
gold she won last Sunday.
Joyner-Kersee broke her own
world record when she won the
heptathlon last Saturday, and her
long jump of 24 feet, 3 and 1/2
inches broke an Olympic mark of
23-10 1/2 she set in 1984.
Daley Thompson's bid for an
unprecedented third straight
decathlon title ended, a shattered
pole in the pole vault perhaps in
dicative of the way things went
for the Briton.
Christian Schenk, the 6-foot-7
East German, won the gold medal
with 8,488 points, followed by
teammate Torsten Voss with
8,399.
Thompson was third going into
the 1,500 meters, the final event,
but with his left leg heavily taped
from the fall in the vault, he
finished fourth with 8,306 points.
The American women beat
Yugoslavia 77-70 for the basket
ball gold, and that was some con
solation for the men's 82-76 loss
to the Soviets the night before.
The U.S. men beat Australia 78-
49 for the bronze.

ball gold, and that was some con
solation for the men's 82-76 loss
to the Soviets the night before.

49 for the bronze.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
— Louise Ritter of Dallas upset
the Bulgarian world record
holder for the women's high
jump gold medal at the Seoul
Olympics on Friday, where the
net gain for America was: one
silver and another shot at gold.
The U.S. men's volleyball
team, incited by America's bas
ketball loss, earned the right
to defend its Olympic title by
beating Brazil Friday, but
American Tim Mayotte could
do no better than silver in the
first men's tennis gold medal
final at the Games in 64 years.
Ritter, meanwhile, won the
gold with a leap of 6 feet 8
inches, beating Bulgarian
Stefka Kostadinova, who had
6'7". Tamara Bykova of the So
viet Union won the bronze with
6'6".
The undefeated U.S. men's
volleyball, led by the spiking
and blocking of Bob Ctvrtlik,
scored an easy 15-3, 15-5, 15-11
semifinal victory over Brazil in
a rematch of the gold-medal
game four years ago in Los An
geles.
"Most of us used to play bas
ketball, and we felt really hor
rible for them when they lost
to the Soviets," Ctvrtlik said.

"We didn't want that to happen
to us." The U.S. men will
meet either the Soviet Union
or Argentina in the volleyball
final Sunday afternoon.
The Soviet Union, mean
while, beat Yugoslavia 76-63
for the basketball gold, giving
the Soviets their 100 th medal
of the Games.
Miloslav Mecir, of Czechoslo
vakia, beat the American
Mayotte 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 for
the men's singles gold medal,
the first awarded at the Games
since 1924 in Paris. Brad Gil
bert of the United States and
Stefan Edberg of Sweden each
won bronze
Mecir, who beat the top
seeded Edberg in the semi
finals, lost the first set in just
40 minutes but just as quickly
turned it around. He broke
Mayotte in the first game of
the second set and begean run
ning the American all over the
court.
When it was over, Mecir was
the one running all over the
court, throwing his racket up
in exultation over the biggest
victory of his career.
On Thursday, Florence Grif-

fith Joyner fulfilled predictions of
"something unbelievable" by her
husband, A 1 Joyner, breaking the
200-meter world record twice in
two hours.
"Two world records, two gold
medals and I'm not finished," Flo
Jo said.
She and record-smashing sister
in-law Jackie Joyner-Kersee high
lighted a day at the Games that
belonged to the women. Joyner-
Kersee won the long jump, and
the U.S. women's team won the
basketball gold medal that the
men couldn't.
The United States' can-do
boxers, meanwhile, had Ameri
cans wondering: Can this be
Montreal all over again? This
was called America's worst Olym
pic boxing team — no names, no
flash, no chance. But U.S. boxers
already are assured of eight
medals — one more than they
won in '76 — and they'll be going
for six golds this weekend, one
more than in Montreal.
On the track Friday, Steve
Cram of Britain and American
Steve Scott moved smartly
through the semifinals of the
1,500 meters. Cram, 1984 silver
medalist, coasted to second in his
heat in 3:38.30, and Scott rallied
in the homestretch to win his heat
in 3:38.20.
They both reached the final Sat
urday of a race weakened by the
withdrawal of Said Aouita of
Morocco and Joaquim Cruz of
Brazil. Aouita has an injured left
hamstring, and Cruz simply said
he was not mentally ready to run.
The heavily favored U.S. men's
1,600-meter relay team was the
fastest by more than three
seconds over Kenya in qualifying
Friday. The American men, who
have won the race 12 of the 16

Two British athletes, mean
while, tested positive for drugs in
their first tests, the British Olym
pic Committee confirmed Friday.
They came from track and field
and judo, but the committee said
their names will not be released
until the International Olympic
Committee completes its hearing
procedures, perhaps by Saturday.
Eight athletes, including 100-
meter world record-holder Ben
Johnson of Canada, have been
kicked out of the Games so far
for drugs.
Griffith Joyner, her long hair
flowing behind her like the con
trails of a jet, first broke the
record in the semifinals, running
21.56.
Then, in the final, she sped to
a time of 21.34, lowering the mark
for the second time in two hours,
and adding the 200 to the 100
gold she won last Sunday.
Joyner-Kersee broke her own
world record when she won the
heptathlon last Saturday, and her
long jump of 24 feet, 3 and 1/2
inches broke an Olympic mark of
23-10 1/2 she set in 1984.
Daley Thompson's bid for an
unprecedented third straight
decathlon title ended, a shattered
pole in the pole vault perhaps in
dicative of the way things went
for the Briton.
Christian Schenk, the 6-foot-7
East German, won the gold medal
with 8,488 points, followed by
teammate Torsten Voss with
8,399.
Thompson was third going into
the 1,500 meters, the final event,
but with his left leg heavily taped
from the fall in the vault, he
finished fourth with 8,306 points.
The American women beat
Yugoslavia 77-70 for the basket
ball gold, and that was some con
solation for the men's 82-76 loss
to the Soviets the night before.
