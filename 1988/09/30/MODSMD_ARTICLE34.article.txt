SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
â€” Louise Ritter of Dallas upset
the Bulgarian world record
holder for the women's high
jump gold medal at the Seoul
Olympics on Friday, where the
net gain for America was: one
silver and another shot at gold.
The U.S. men's volleyball
team, incited by America's bas
ketball loss, earned the right
to defend its Olympic title by
beating Brazil Friday, but
American Tim Mayotte could
do no better than silver in the
first men's tennis gold medal
final at the Games in 64 years.
Ritter, meanwhile, won the
gold with a leap of 6 feet 8
inches, beating Bulgarian
Stefka Kostadinova, who had
6'7". Tamara Bykova of the So
viet Union won the bronze with
6'6".
The undefeated U.S. men's
volleyball, led by the spiking
and blocking of Bob Ctvrtlik,
scored an easy 15-3, 15-5, 15-11
semifinal victory over Brazil in
a rematch of the gold-medal
game four years ago in Los An
geles.
"Most of us used to play bas
ketball, and we felt really hor
rible for them when they lost
to the Soviets," Ctvrtlik said.

"We didn't want that to happen
to us." The U.S. men will
meet either the Soviet Union
or Argentina in the volleyball
final Sunday afternoon.
The Soviet Union, mean
while, beat Yugoslavia 76-63
for the basketball gold, giving
the Soviets their 100 th medal
of the Games.
Miloslav Mecir, of Czechoslo
vakia, beat the American
Mayotte 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 for
the men's singles gold medal,
the first awarded at the Games
since 1924 in Paris. Brad Gil
bert of the United States and
Stefan Edberg of Sweden each
won bronze
Mecir, who beat the top
seeded Edberg in the semi
finals, lost the first set in just
40 minutes but just as quickly
turned it around. He broke
Mayotte in the first game of
the second set and begean run
ning the American all over the
court.
When it was over, Mecir was
the one running all over the
court, throwing his racket up
in exultation over the biggest
victory of his career.
