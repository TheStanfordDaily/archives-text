# Women's soccer loses heartbreaker, 1-0

### John Kirks 
The Stanford women's soccer
team stormed into Storrs, Con
necticut yesterday, with but one
goal in mind: to do battle with
Connecticut's Huskies in an at
tempt to pull off a miraculous
upset. That was certainly an un
enviable task: UConn had recently
run their record to 8-0 by handily
defeating both Providence and
Rutgers by three-goal margins.
Even more intimidating, their na
tional ranking had jumped one
spot to fourth.
Stanford and Connecticut
locked themselves into an ex
tremely tense match. The two
clubs probed cautiously into each
other's lines of defense, but nei
ther could capitalize on its scoring
opportunities. At the end of the

-90 minutes of regulation play,
both squads found themselves
looking wearily at a score knotted
at 0-0. The players clenched their
teeth and headed into overtime.
The two teams once again
played to a stalemate in the first
ten minutes of overtime. But in
the second ten minutes, after al
most 110 minutes of grueling soc
cer, Stanford's careful and precise
play broke down momentarily, and
Connecticut's Britton Arico was
there to cash in on the slip.
With only minutes left in the
overtime period a cautious throw
in by Stanford's Blair Elliot, in
tended for fullback Heather Mcln
tyre, got away. The ball dribbled
precariously into the vacated Car
dinal defensive zone. Any spec
tator who blinked risked missing
the game-winning goal. The

speedy Arico streaked in and beat
Stanford goalie Elise Edwards
with a lightning-like scoring
strike. The Cardinal was stunned
and heartbroken, despite its ex
tremely strong effort.
Arico's game-winner was noth
ing new for her. A sophomore,
she already is ninth on the all
time UConn scoring list with 17
goals in only 31 games. It was
the fifth goal in eight games for
Arico this season.
UConn actually outplayed Stan
ford from the starting whistle.
The Huskies had 27 shots, com
pared to Stanford's relatively
meager total of seven. In addition,
Connecticut had eight corner
kicks to Stanford's one; indeed,
the ball was around the Stanford
goal for a frighteningly large por
tion of the game. However, Stan

ford coach Berhane Andeberhan
insisted that the game went ex
actly according to plan.
"Very early in the match, we
saw that our usual 4-3-3 setup
(four fullbacks, three midfielders,
and three forwards) couldn't han
dle their offense," Andeberhan
said. "Ten minutes after the start,
we went to our catnaccio forma
tion, which is a 5-3-2, defensively
intensive system. We conceded
one-third to one-half of the field
and counted on quick counterat
tacks for scoring opportunities."
The resulting strong defensive ef
fort impressed more than just the
crowd.
Len Tsantiris, the Huskies'
head coach, was one of those im
pressed with the young Cardinal
squad. "They were very dis-
