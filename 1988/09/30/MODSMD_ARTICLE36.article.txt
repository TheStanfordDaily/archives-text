# Spikers square off with second-place Huskies
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
This weekend, the Stanford
women's volleyball team will have
its ability to adjust put to a strong
test when Washington and Wash
ington State step out onto the
Maples Pavilion floor. In the
midst of their finest season
opening play to date and under
the direction of brand new
coaches, the Huskies and the
Cougars have improved their
performances to such a great
degree that the scouting tapes
from last year may not tell the
Cardinal coaching staff a very

true tale.
Washington, Stanford's oppon
ent tonight at 7:30, has come out
with a vengeance to grab the sec
ond place spot in the Pacific 10
Conference. Not eager to be over
shadowed by its intrastate rival,
Washington State has recorded
the most overall wins in the con
ference with 12 despite losing its
first and only three league match
es, and should put up a good chal
lenge for the Cardinal in Saturday
night's 7:30 contest.
"They should be good matches,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"Both of those teams are really
improved from last year. They are

both young programs that [have
been] coming up and improving
over the last couple years, so it's
hard to know what to expect other
than that they're much better
than last year."
As for Stanford, things are not
all that different from last season.
Out to a 9-1 start overall and 3-1
in Pac-10 play, plus boasting the
No. 3 ranking on both the NCAA
and the AVCA/Tachikara polls,
the Stanford spikers are ready to
move up from third place in the
league with a pair of wins this
weekend.
Washington will provide a for
midable obstacle, however.

Though many of the Huskies'
players are the same as on last
year's team that could only
muster eighth place in the Pac-10,
rookie Coach Debbie Buse has
pulled the program up into the
top 20.
"1 don't know much, other than
from playing them last year,"
Shaw said. "Washington is off to
a really good start, 3-0 in the
conference and 8-1 overall, and
they have played some pretty
decent teams, so 1 expect them to
be really good. They have their
same starting line-up back from
last year."
Back and playing particularly
well is Huskies' senior Laurie
Wetzel, a member of the 1987 All
Pac-10 team. Leading her team
in kills, hitting percentage and
digs, Wetzel provides a potent
threat.
The Cougars have also found
their clutch player in freshman
Carrie Couturier. A native of
Portland, Ore., Courtier is cur
rently third in the Pac-10 in
blocks with a credible average of
1.35 per game.

More impressive, however, was
her recent performance at Illinois
State's Lady Redbird Classic,
where the middle blocker recorded
65 kills in three matches to lead
WSU to the tournament title and
was named the competition's
MVP. Couturier is clearly a Car
dinal concern.
"She's really carrying a lot of
their offensive load, and we don't
have any film."
Fresh off a solid win at San
Jose State on Tuesday and a
weekend sweep in Arizona, Stan
ford is ready to handle the chal
lenge of the unknowns with con
centration and consistent effort.
