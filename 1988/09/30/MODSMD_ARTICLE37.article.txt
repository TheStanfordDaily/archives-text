# Slumping men's soccer team hopes to end slide
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Coming of! a luckless, scoreless,
and not to mention winless
roadtrip, and hoping to snap a
four-loss tailspin, the Stanford
men's soccer team enters the most
important weekend of its season
tomorrow.
The Cardinal hopes to play the
discourteous host in its own Stan
ford/AT&T Pacific Soccer Classic
this Saturday and Sunday at
Harry Maloney Field. It will be
no easy task, as the undefeated,
nationally third-ranked Portland
Pilots come to town. Joining them
in the four-team field are a tough
Simon Fraser squad and the Cal
ifornia Golden Bears.
Unranked and unheralded,
Stanford (6-4) realizes how pivotal
this tournament will be if they
expect to go beyond their last reg
ular season game. As star sweeper
Mark Semioli (AT&T tournament
MVP a year ago) simply stated,
"We have to win this tourna
ment."
Semioli and his teammates hope
to duplicate their performance of
a year ago when Stanford won
the first-annual tournament with
wins over Washington and UCLA.
But circumstances going into this
year's tournament couldn't be
more different for the Cardinal.
Last season, Coach Sam Koch's
team was riding a high after 1-0
wins over Fresno State and USF.
This time around, Stanford will
be trying to end a streak of three
1-0 losses.

That may be a blessing in dis
guise, however. Stanford peaked
at this tournament a year ago,
and proceeded to lose three and
tie another in their next four
games.
The road to the post-season
runs first through Simon Fraser
(5-3) tomorrow at 3 pm. A top
NAIA team from Vancouver 8.C.,
the Clansmen beat Stanford last
year to end the Cardinal's four
game win streak.
It gets worse when the Cardinal
meets Portland (8-0) at 3 on Sun
day. "They're on a roll. You've
got to respect them," Koch said
of the West's top-ranked team.
Stanford will have a few advan
tages that their opponents may
not be able to counter. Both Koch
and Semioli mentioned the ex
pected high temperatures to be a
factor against the teams from the
colder North. In addition, Stan
ford is a good tournament team,
having already won the Gold Rush
Classic earlier this year. "We're
really fit, which means we can
play games back-to-back well,"
Semioli explained.
Oddly enough, the home field
may not be an advantage at all
for Stanford at the tournament.
After opening 6-0, Stanford's first
two losses came at their brand
new, fenced-in field. But all that
will change if Stanford scoring
threats Rhett Harty and Chris
Porch find the mark this weekend.
As Garcia observed, "This
weekend is a real turning point.
We can turn everything around
if we do well."

Senior fullback Andrew Westergren, who hails from Maidenhead, England, and the Cardinal soccer squad will attempt to bounce back
this weekend against Simon Fraser and Portland after a recent spate of losses.
