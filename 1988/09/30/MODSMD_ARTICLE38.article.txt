# First major test set for cross country
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The first real test of the season for Stan
ford's harriers will come Saturday morning
at the Stanford Golf Course, while several
former teammates are in Seoul for the
Games of the XXIV Olympiad.
The Stanford cross country program has
supplied three Olympians to the Seoul
Games. While the Cardinal will no longer
have the services of PattiSue Plumer and
Jeff Atkinson, Olympic finalists in the 3,000-
and 1,500-meter runs, respectively, this
year's squad looks as solid as any since
Atkinson graduated three years ago. Both
the men and women scored a win at Ohio
State last Saturday in their first competi
tion.
The Stanford Holiday Inn Invitational will
be an excellent opportunity for the team to

put forth a strong, early-season effort, as
thousands of athletes from Western and
Midwestern colleges will compete along with
hundreds of high school runners. The wom
en's 5,000-meter run will begin at 10:30
a.m. Saturday, while the men's 5,000 will
take place at 11 a.m. Earlier in the day,
Stanford's junior-varsity team will race.
"We did very well at Ohio State," accord
ing to men's coach Scott Chisam. "Five of
the other [Pacific 10 Conference] teams will
be at the Invitational, so it will give us an
indication of our standing in the confer
ence."
This year's squad will be significantly
strengthened by a year of maturity and an
infusion of new blood. The biggest change
was splitting the men's and women's teams.
While Johnson will retain control of the
women's program and the track and field

program, Scott Chisam will run the men's
team after two years as junior-varsity coach.
As with last year's squad, the women's
team will depend on junior Carol Gray and
an influx of freshmen to buoy the team.
Last year, Johnson searched for harriers
to run fourth and fifth on the squad, but
this year the team appears to have five solid
runners. In addition to captain James Al
borough and juniors Eric and Mark Mastalir,
transfer Steve Miller and freshman Dave
Scudamore round out the top five.
Miller, a senior from Northwestern, served
notice by placing second. He, Scudamore,
and freshman Alex Accetta will be battling
for a place on the varsity team. After placing
three athletes among the top thirty at last
year's Stanford Invitational, five or more
from the Cardinal squad could make it this
year.
