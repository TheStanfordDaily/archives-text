# Complications over money prevent campus cable hookups
## 
### Robert Landon 
Students who had looked forward to
returning to housing with newly installed
cable television service were sorely dis
appointed when they arrived on campus
this week.
Pacific Bell and Cable Co-op have
finished installing trunk cable to a num
ber of student residences, including Es
condido Village, Governor's Corner and
Manzanita Park. But because of compli
cations in negotiations between Cable Co
op and the University, those cables lie
dormant.
When Shelly Lawrence, a Manzanita
coordinator, returned to her trailer this
fall, she was "really bummed" to hear
that there was no cable television avail
able. She said she cannot understand why

[We're] very eager to get into Stanford.... People are really disappointed when we
tell them they can't get our service.'
— Peter Fechheimer of Cable Co-op in Palo Alto

the University will not allow for cable
hookup in those dorms which already
have access to it. Randy Mackaman, also
a Manzanita coordinator, said that the
workers installing the trunk cables
promised cable by this fall.
Peter Fechheimer is general manager
of the Palo Alto office of Cable Co-op,
which has its headquarters in Des
Moines, lowa. He says that Cable Co-op
is "very eager to get into Stanford,' and
expressed some frustration with Univer-

sity administration.
"The SAE house wanted to install cable
on its own, and the University said no,"
Fechheimer added. "People are really dis
appointed when we tell them they can't
get our service." He said the matter now
lies in the hands of the University and
Cable Co-op lawyers.
John Kelley, the attorney representing
Cable Co-op in negotiations with the Uni
versity, said that there remains only "a
single, fairly complicated document to be

drafted."
He thinks cable will arrive on campus
in the near future and did not rule out
the possibilty of hookup by the beginning
of winter quarter. He blamed the delays
thus far on the summer vacations of both
University and Cable Co-op employees.
University officials were not as opti
mistic, and Julia Freidman explained that
there are several complications. The Uni
versity has not decided how students
should be billed for cable service. It could

be on a room-to-room or a dorm-to-dorm
basis.
The University is also pushing for cable
service in common rooms, but Freidman
said that Cable Co-op remained hesitant.
Further, the University wants assurance
that Cable Co-op will provide service to
all student residences on campus before
they enter into any financial agreement.
She said they do not want Cable Co-op
to hook up only the most convenient res
idences.
Keith Guy, director of Housing Man
agement, said there remains "a lot of
obstacles to be hurdled" before cable is
installed, and he could give no time table
for its arrival. He added that Cable Co-op
"was not forthcoming with hooking up
the whole campus."
