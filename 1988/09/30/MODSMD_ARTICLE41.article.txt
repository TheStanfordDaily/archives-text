Faculty Senate opens
21st session smoothly
The Faculty Senate opened its
21st session yesterday with a
speedy, largely administrative
meeting in the Law School,
which Chair John Kaplan hap
pily announced contained no dis
cussion on CIV or the Hoover
Institution.
Among the items discussed:
A memorial resolution was
passed for retired Law Prof. Gor
don Scott, who died April 14.
Scott taught at the Law School
from 1946 to 1948 and from
1952 until 1977, specializing in
corporations, corporate taxation

and local government. Scott was
instrumental in establishing the
student-edited Stanford Law
Review.
Affirmative action programs
to recruit minority graduate stu
dents were supported by English
Prof. Ron Rebholz. Vice Provost
Elizabeth Traugott replied that
the best way to attract minority
students to Stanford was per
sonal contact through Stanford
professors and students initiat
ing an outreach program.
The University encourages
professors to join in the recruit
ing effort by providing extra
funds for them to stay an extra
day or two at a campus to talk
to minority students.

USW and University
remain in stalemate
Contract negotiations between
the United Stanford Workers
and the University remained
stalled yesterday, with both
sides expressing confusion and
disappointment over the
stalemate.
Although the two-hour session
yielded one union proposal, the
offer contained fewer conces
sions than a proposal the USW
withdrew Tuesday, according to
USW negotiator Mary Mocine
and University bargainer Mi
chael Vartain.
One of the union's main de

mands in the new proposal is a
two-year wage increase plan.
The USW made some conces
sions on the pension plan,
benefits and health care.
Vartain said he was disap
pointed because the new pro
posal "widened the gap" between
the USW and the University
from where they were before the
latest rift.
The University did not
seriously consider yesterday's of
fer, according to Mocine and stu
dent negotiator Lois Jackson.
Both accused Vartain of being
"unwilling to move" on any of
the University's proposals, and
more important, "unwilling to
talk."
