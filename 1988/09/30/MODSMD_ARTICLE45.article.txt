# More than just a bite to eat
## A 						guide to some of the area's finest restaurants 
### Mia Manzulli Evan Tuchinsky 
Just as Stanford is one of the most diverse universities
in the nation, so too is the dining scene in neighboring
Palo Alto. Catering to a variety of cultivated culinary
tastes, restauranteurs in the area have assembled a wide
array of places to satisfy even the most discriminating
diner.
For the lover of foreign fare, Palo Alto is indeed a
blessing. It would take months of continuous dining in
order to exhaust the supply of exotic eateries. From
Chinese to Cuban to Italian, the local restaurant scene
is embarrassed with riches.
As in any community, however, some spots shine
brighter than the others, possessing some special spark
that makes them a diner's special favorite. Whether it
be ambiance, service with a smile or just plain great food,
several select restaurants rise up from among the masses
and leave the customer with an especially warm feeling.
To give you a head start on your quest for quality
cuisine, here are some of the area's most interesting and
enjoyable purveyors of fine fare.
Jing-Jing
443 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
328-6885
Next to the great hole-in-the-wall places prevalent in
Chinatown, Jing-Jing offers some of the best Chinese
food in the Bay Area. 'I he menu claims they cook their
fare the way it should be, which after any meal eaten

proves to be a statement not of self-aggrandizement but
of honesty.
The menu is sizeable and diverse, featuring several
varieties of Chinese cuisine. For folks with fortitude as
well as for the foolhardy, Jing-Jing proudly serves over
two-dozen scaldingly spicy Szechuan dishes that rank
among the restaurant's best offerings. The courageous
diners that order from the red page of the menu devoted
to the hot stuff will definitely find themselves rewarded.
Some of the finest dishes not bearing the red temper
ature warning include two great poultry dishes, cashew
chicken and mu-shu chicken (the traditional mu-shu in
gredient, pork, is available, as is beef, but poultry provides
an unusual change of taste). Appealing to the eye as well
as to the tongue, beef and scallops on a sizzling plate is
another real winner.
However, at lunchtime Jing-Jing really shines with
their inexpensive yet exquisite lunch specials. For $3.95,
the diner receives a cup of hot-and-sour soup and a choice
of two dishes out of about a dozen. Jing-Jing is clearly
one of the best lunch bargains around, providing truly
tasty vittles for the price of a slimy burger and fries. —

Hsi-Nan
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065
If you don't look carefully, you might very well overlook
a small but sumptuous Chinese restaurant. Tucked away
inconspicuously next to the University Creamery (from
where, incidentally, the soft drinks and ice cream served
here actually come — the same man owns both places)
the 12-table Hsi-Nan is one of Palo Alto's buried treasures.
As strange as it may seem, Pve yet to go beyond one

dish in all of the times I've eaten there, not because of
any lassitude but because of total satiation. Quite simply,
the sweet and sour prawns are heavenly: The lightly fried
prawns and fresh-cooked vegetables are covered by an
amazing sauce, with a light sprinkling of sesame seeds
to give just the right touch. The dish is so good, in fact,
that even after three consecutive meals 1 was still reeling
in culinary ecstasy.
At $8.50 for the prawns and comparable prices for
other dishes, Hsi-Nan is not cheap, probably one of the
reasons that I've yet to encounter more than a handful
of patrons at any one time. However, since each of these
people seemed to have enjoyed their feast (as have all of
the guests I've invited to dine there with me), the spot
seems a safe bet for prawn-lovers and non-prawn-lovers
alike.
By the way, the last person I went there with ordered
chicken in Peking sauce and really enjoyed it. The dish
is a little heavy on the onions but well worth a try. Just
have a pack of Certs handy for the needed after-dinner
mint. — ET
Happy Lye Lye
406 California Ave.
Palo Alto
327-1688
Palo Alto's consummate hole-in-the-wall is Happy Lye
Lye, a moderately small but good Chinese restaurant
nestled among the shops lining California Ave. The fare
is always fantastic, and the prices are very reasonable.
The highlight here is the shrimp with lobster sauce.

Jose's
2275 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6522
Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best restaurant
in Palo Alto. Blending a soothing ambiance with delicious
food, Jose's provides the perfect meal.
This is no ordinary place. The small, dimly lit restaurant
exudes a character that must be experienced to be fully
appreciated. Jose has taken great care in his choice of
decorations, from the large fish tank in the entry to the
unusual collection of artwork on the walls, resulting in
a truly unique atmosphere.
Yes, that's right, there is a real Jose (who, incidentally,
looks just like the picture painted on the front window,
sans the hoop earring) and he is more than just a

Whereas most Chinese restaurants serve the shellfish
bathed in a fairly bland yellowish sauce, Happy Lye Lye
adds some tasty black beans and other surprises to make
a thicker light brown sauce. Atop steamed rice, the dish
is satiating.
Soup is another strong point. The restaurant offers
only a handul, but all are good, and the kwo won ton is
clearly the best. The cooks add a healthy helping of fresh
vegetables, meat and shrimp to the standard won ton
soup base, creating a hearty broth that is almost a meal
itself.
But whatthing that separates Happy Lye Lye from all
of the rest is their dinner specials. Extending the concept
of a lunch special into the suppertime hours, the restaurant
offers a complete meal with soup for about $5. Quite a
bargain, and a delicious one at that. — ET
O'Mei
1438 El Camino Heal
Menlo Park
323-2700
Owned by a Japanese man and his Chinese wife, O'Mei
provides elegant food in a less than formal, but still very
pleasant, setting. The service is especially friendly and
greatly enhances a fine dining experience.
The menu is extensive but not overpriced, and after
dining there on over a dozen occasions I've yet to get a
bum dish.
You just can't lose at O'Mei.
Go give it a try — the place will speak for itself. — ET

figurehead. Quite often, you can see him puttering around
the kitchen next to his cooks or shmoozing with the
patrons. If asked, he'll even autograph a menu.
As for cuisine, this is where Jose's really shines. Ab
solutely everything on the menu is delicious, from the
harbeque fare to the pizza to the empanadas. Even the
common burrito tastes that much better with Jose's spe
cial touch.
The barbeque dishes are the jewels in Jose's crown
Billed as "the baddest barbeque in town," the ribs and
chicken explode with flavor under the delicious sauce Jose
has created. The feast comes with the South American
staple of black beans and rice, a mild counterpoint to the
smoking barbeque entree.
Another treat is the Argentinian pizza, thinner and
crisper than its Italian counterpart. Available with a sour
dough or whole-wheat crust, the diner can also opt to

replace the standard tomato-based sauce with the
dynamite barbeque sauce. It sounds unappetizing but is
really delicious.
Empanadas seem to be Jose's specialty, however. Sold
frozen next door in the Empanada Factory, the fresh

Osteria
247 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto
328-5700
For hustle, bustle and excellent Tuscan cuisine, try
Osteria, the very popular and crowded restaurant at the
corner of Hamilton and Ramona. Osteria is small, but it
makes the most of the space it has and seems to keep
all its tables constantly filled. The pretty arches and
ceramic tile accents add a simple touch to the busy at
mosphere. Fortunately, the noise level is manageable and
it is easy to carry on a conversation.
Osteria has a nice choice of antipasti to get your meal
started, including a shrimp cocktail, buffalo mozzarella
and shrimp with artichokes. My favorite is the melone e
prosciutto: salty Italian "ham" wrapped around sweet
juicy melon is definitely an appetizing must. There are
also soups like minestrone and healthy salads as well.
The Caesar salad is very good, especially if you are a
garlic lover.
My only real complaint with Osteria is their bread.
Sourdough bread may be the San Francisco favorite, but
it is not Italian. With so many good Italian breads around,
I think they could do better.
All of the pasta is made fresh at Osteria, making this
the place to be. 1 particularly enjoy the gnocchi, potato
dumpling pasta that many restaurants just can't get right.
Osteria's gnocchi is excellent: light but very filling, the
dumplings melt in you mouth. The large portion comes
with a meat sauce, but you can substitute with any of
their other sauces.
Try the pomodoro e basilico, an excellent light tomato
sauce with strong traces of basil and finely chopped onions.
Osteria offers several specials — the fish of the day as
well as a pasta. My guest and I tried the torteloni, a
tortellini-like pasta filled with creamy chicken and topped
with a hearty tomato sauce. Other pastas include linguine
with red clam sauce, capellini al pomodoro e basilico,
tortellini, fettucine carbonaro . . . you can't go wrong.
Chicken, veal and fish dishes are a great choice whether
alone or after the pasta (as the Italians eat it). There is
a cheesy chicken parmigiana, a grilled chicken and sole

ones served here are sizable and sumptuous. Skip the
salad if you order one — the empanadas are really big.
When the craving for great barbeque or something a
little unusual hits, head over to Jose's. Your tastebuds
and tummy will be glad you did. — ET

with tomatoes and garlic, to name a few. All come with
perfectly cooked asparagus and carrots.
Sip some coffee, finish your wine, look around at the
faces. Osteria is a lively dining spot with very moderate
prices (pasta, $7-8, meat $10-12) for excellent food. Boun
appetito! — MM
Cenzo's
Univeristy Ave.
Palo Alto
322-1846
Right in the heart of Palo Alto on University Ave. is
Cenzo's, a casual yet pretty European-style restaurant
with framed Italian tourism posters on the walls. Although
not very wide, Cenzo's stretches far back with plenty of
tables along each wall and several larger tables in the
middle. The tables are close together but the atmosphere
is cozy rather than confining. Dinner at Cenzo's is a quiet
and calming affair.
A large counter toward the back of the restaurant is
where Cenzo's makes their salads. A nice way to start a
meal, the salads here are very large. A half-order of the
delicately seasoned Caesar salad is more than enough if
you plan to eat a full dinner. Wonderful grated parmesan
accents the salad nicely.
Cenzo's has a large selection of appetizers including
fried mozzarella — the crunchy coating contains the mel
ting cheese inside only until you take that first bite. In
addition, you can order small pizzas with your choice of
toppings.
One thing that makes Cenzo's special is the freshly
baked bread on every table. In many restaurants the
bread is an ordinary French, sourdough or Italian that
simply staves off hunger pangs until the meal arrives.
Not the case here — the bread comes in fiat strips (almost
like soft breadsticks) and is chewy and buttery with a
light herb flavoring, good for nibbling throughout the
entire meal.
I he nice-sized menu of meat, fish and pasta dishes is
diverse and tempting. My favorite is the rigatoni al
pomodoro: wide macaroni tubes with a fresh tomato,
mushroom and onion sauce, seasoned perfectly with garlic

and basil. This simple dish is anything but ordinary.
Attentive waiters sprinkle grated cheese or freshly ground
pepper at your request.
Another sure thing is the fettucine al'Adriatico: fresh
spinach noodles in a light cream sauce, topped with a
generous portion of tender prawns. Garlic adds a touch
of spice to this delicious dish. The tortellini carbonara
with its creamy "bacon and eggs" sauce over cheese stuffed
noodles also makes for a hearty meal.
A perfect ending to any Italian meal is coffee — steaming
hot espresso or cappuccino adds the perfect touch. Genzo's
offers a pleasant dining experience right down to the last
morsel. Prices range from $6-12 for most entrees. — MM
La I'astaia
120 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
323-2464
La Pastaia, an "Italian cafe," is the newest addition to
the Palo Alto Italian dining scene. This chic dining spot
with its expansive glass front is elegant and airy, but
never imposing. The front room looks out onto Emerson,
but the restaurant wraps around to a more private back
dining room. If you like gazing at tempting looking "dolci"
(Italian sweets), stick to the front room with a luscious
display behind the counter.
When you enter La Pastaia you'll be greeted by the
friendly hostess or the chefs gregarious husband. Every
one here is eager to please and very helpful. The menu
has two sides: a regular selection with appetizers, primi

Fuki-Sushi
4119 El ('amino Real
Palo Alto
494-9383
Offering just about anything that pops into mind, Fuki-
Sushi is the best all-around Japanese restaurant in the
area. The sushi bar is simply outstanding, serving tasty
fishes at tempting prices, while the luxurious dining rooms
hold other great surprises for the seekers of cooked cuisine.
What sets Fuki-Sushi apart from the other area res
taurants is atmosphere. Decorated authentically and taste
fully, the restaurant exudes a distinctly Japanese feel
when the diner steps through the front door, El Camin<
seems very far away.
The food is equally enjoyable, well-prepared and beauti
fully presented. The basic teriyaki and tempura are con
sistently outstanding, particularly when paired with some

(pasta) and secondi (meats); and a daily special side with
almost as many selections as the standard menu. There
is also an extensive wine list.
On every table, instead of the traditional basket of
sliced bread, La Pastaia places long crunchy breadsticka,
Italian style. Choose between butter and a spicy eggplant
tomato puree for dipping. It's a nice start to any meal.
At the hostess' suggestion, my guest and I ordered one
of the special appetizers — timbale di polenta e gorgonzola.
i he polenta (cooked corn meal) was loaded with gorgonzola
and fontina cheeses and studded with sweet currants. A
pepper tomato sauce edged the mound of polenta to make
a very attractive, as well as rich and delicious, first course.
Food presentation is important to the chef at La Pastaia
but only as the finishing touch to an already well
prepared meal. The tortellini con salmone, a feast of pinks
and greens, looked too good to eat — but once we began,
it was easy to keep going. The spinach tortellini were
filled with mild ricotta and served with a salmon cream
sauce. To top it off, fresh salmon slices were layered over
the pasta for a wonderful combination of flavors.
Another excellent choice is the simple but satisfying
linguini as pomodoro. The fresh tomatoes, garlic and
oregano blend for a light summery sauce, a perfect ac
companiment to the fresh pasta. A touch of pungent
parmesean makes it complete.
Dining at La Pastaia heightens one's appreciation for
fine food. The dishes really taste as good as they look —
and vice versa. Prices are extremely reasonable ($B-12
for most entrees) for a meal of this caliber. Mange bene!

delicious sashimi (sliced raw fish that is not served on rice).
1 he best bet here, however, is the do-it-yourself dishes.
No, you won't get to do all of the fun stuff the chefs at
Benihana's do, as insurance companies are not apt to
cover restaurants that encourage their customers to ma
nipulate razor-sharp cutlery at blinding speeds.
However, the limited diner participation in preparing
shabu sabu (meat and vegetables in a miso soup base)
and chanko nabe (seafood in a similar base), while not
as thrilling, yield equally delicious results.
The luckv customers that order either of these dishes
are presented with a tureen of hot water, an assortment
of vegetables and tofu plus a plate of meat or fish. By
combining the ingredients that strike the eater's fancy
into the water, a tasty dish develops that utterly destroys
all of the subliminal warnings implanted during childhood
that advise, "Don't play with your food." — ET

the pasta for a wonderful combination of flavors.
Another excellent choice is the simple but satisfying
linguini as pomodoro. The fresh tomatoes, garlic and
oregano blend for a light summery sauce, a perfect ac
companiment to the fresh pasta. A touch of pungent
parmesean makes it complete.
Dining at La Pastaia heightens one's appreciation for
fine food. The dishes really taste as good as they look —
and vice versa. Prices are extremely reasonable ($B-12
for most entrees) for a meal of this caliber. Mange bene!

Just as Stanford is one of the most diverse universities
in the nation, so too is the dining scene in neighboring
Palo Alto. Catering to a variety of cultivated culinary
tastes, restauranteurs in the area have assembled a wide
array of places to satisfy even the most discriminating
diner.
For the lover of foreign fare, Palo Alto is indeed a
blessing. It would take months of continuous dining in
order to exhaust the supply of exotic eateries. From
Chinese to Cuban to Italian, the local restaurant scene
is embarrassed with riches.
As in any community, however, some spots shine
brighter than the others, possessing some special spark
that makes them a diner's special favorite. Whether it
be ambiance, service with a smile or just plain great food,
several select restaurants rise up from among the masses
and leave the customer with an especially warm feeling.
To give you a head start on your quest for quality
cuisine, here are some of the area's most interesting and
enjoyable purveyors of fine fare.
Jing-Jing
443 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
328-6885
Next to the great hole-in-the-wall places prevalent in
Chinatown, Jing-Jing offers some of the best Chinese
food in the Bay Area. 'I he menu claims they cook their
fare the way it should be, which after any meal eaten

proves to be a statement not of self-aggrandizement but
of honesty.
The menu is sizeable and diverse, featuring several
varieties of Chinese cuisine. For folks with fortitude as
well as for the foolhardy, Jing-Jing proudly serves over
two-dozen scaldingly spicy Szechuan dishes that rank
among the restaurant's best offerings. The courageous
diners that order from the red page of the menu devoted
to the hot stuff will definitely find themselves rewarded.
Some of the finest dishes not bearing the red temper
ature warning include two great poultry dishes, cashew
chicken and mu-shu chicken (the traditional mu-shu in
gredient, pork, is available, as is beef, but poultry provides
an unusual change of taste). Appealing to the eye as well
as to the tongue, beef and scallops on a sizzling plate is
another real winner.
However, at lunchtime Jing-Jing really shines with
their inexpensive yet exquisite lunch specials. For $3.95,
the diner receives a cup of hot-and-sour soup and a choice
of two dishes out of about a dozen. Jing-Jing is clearly
one of the best lunch bargains around, providing truly
tasty vittles for the price of a slimy burger and fries. —

Hsi-Nan
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065
If you don't look carefully, you might very well overlook
a small but sumptuous Chinese restaurant. Tucked away
inconspicuously next to the University Creamery (from
where, incidentally, the soft drinks and ice cream served
here actually come — the same man owns both places)
the 12-table Hsi-Nan is one of Palo Alto's buried treasures.
As strange as it may seem, Pve yet to go beyond one

dish in all of the times I've eaten there, not because of
any lassitude but because of total satiation. Quite simply,
the sweet and sour prawns are heavenly: The lightly fried
prawns and fresh-cooked vegetables are covered by an
amazing sauce, with a light sprinkling of sesame seeds
to give just the right touch. The dish is so good, in fact,
that even after three consecutive meals 1 was still reeling
in culinary ecstasy.
At $8.50 for the prawns and comparable prices for
other dishes, Hsi-Nan is not cheap, probably one of the
reasons that I've yet to encounter more than a handful
of patrons at any one time. However, since each of these
people seemed to have enjoyed their feast (as have all of
the guests I've invited to dine there with me), the spot
seems a safe bet for prawn-lovers and non-prawn-lovers
alike.
By the way, the last person I went there with ordered
chicken in Peking sauce and really enjoyed it. The dish
is a little heavy on the onions but well worth a try. Just
have a pack of Certs handy for the needed after-dinner
mint. — ET
Happy Lye Lye
406 California Ave.
Palo Alto
327-1688
Palo Alto's consummate hole-in-the-wall is Happy Lye
Lye, a moderately small but good Chinese restaurant
nestled among the shops lining California Ave. The fare
is always fantastic, and the prices are very reasonable.
The highlight here is the shrimp with lobster sauce.

Jose's
2275 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6522
Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best restaurant
in Palo Alto. Blending a soothing ambiance with delicious
food, Jose's provides the perfect meal.
This is no ordinary place. The small, dimly lit restaurant
exudes a character that must be experienced to be fully
appreciated. Jose has taken great care in his choice of
decorations, from the large fish tank in the entry to the
unusual collection of artwork on the walls, resulting in
a truly unique atmosphere.
Yes, that's right, there is a real Jose (who, incidentally,
looks just like the picture painted on the front window,
sans the hoop earring) and he is more than just a

Whereas most Chinese restaurants serve the shellfish
bathed in a fairly bland yellowish sauce, Happy Lye Lye
adds some tasty black beans and other surprises to make
a thicker light brown sauce. Atop steamed rice, the dish
is satiating.
Soup is another strong point. The restaurant offers
only a handul, but all are good, and the kwo won ton is
clearly the best. The cooks add a healthy helping of fresh
vegetables, meat and shrimp to the standard won ton
soup base, creating a hearty broth that is almost a meal
itself.
But whatthing that separates Happy Lye Lye from all
of the rest is their dinner specials. Extending the concept
of a lunch special into the suppertime hours, the restaurant
offers a complete meal with soup for about $5. Quite a
bargain, and a delicious one at that. — ET
O'Mei
1438 El Camino Heal
Menlo Park
323-2700
Owned by a Japanese man and his Chinese wife, O'Mei
provides elegant food in a less than formal, but still very
pleasant, setting. The service is especially friendly and
greatly enhances a fine dining experience.
The menu is extensive but not overpriced, and after
dining there on over a dozen occasions I've yet to get a
bum dish.
You just can't lose at O'Mei.
Go give it a try — the place will speak for itself. — ET

figurehead. Quite often, you can see him puttering around
the kitchen next to his cooks or shmoozing with the
patrons. If asked, he'll even autograph a menu.
As for cuisine, this is where Jose's really shines. Ab
solutely everything on the menu is delicious, from the
harbeque fare to the pizza to the empanadas. Even the
common burrito tastes that much better with Jose's spe
cial touch.
The barbeque dishes are the jewels in Jose's crown
Billed as "the baddest barbeque in town," the ribs and
chicken explode with flavor under the delicious sauce Jose
has created. The feast comes with the South American
staple of black beans and rice, a mild counterpoint to the
smoking barbeque entree.
Another treat is the Argentinian pizza, thinner and
crisper than its Italian counterpart. Available with a sour
dough or whole-wheat crust, the diner can also opt to

replace the standard tomato-based sauce with the
dynamite barbeque sauce. It sounds unappetizing but is
really delicious.
Empanadas seem to be Jose's specialty, however. Sold
frozen next door in the Empanada Factory, the fresh

Osteria
247 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto
328-5700
For hustle, bustle and excellent Tuscan cuisine, try
Osteria, the very popular and crowded restaurant at the
corner of Hamilton and Ramona. Osteria is small, but it
makes the most of the space it has and seems to keep
all its tables constantly filled. The pretty arches and
ceramic tile accents add a simple touch to the busy at
mosphere. Fortunately, the noise level is manageable and
it is easy to carry on a conversation.
Osteria has a nice choice of antipasti to get your meal
started, including a shrimp cocktail, buffalo mozzarella
and shrimp with artichokes. My favorite is the melone e
prosciutto: salty Italian "ham" wrapped around sweet
juicy melon is definitely an appetizing must. There are
also soups like minestrone and healthy salads as well.
The Caesar salad is very good, especially if you are a
garlic lover.
My only real complaint with Osteria is their bread.
Sourdough bread may be the San Francisco favorite, but
it is not Italian. With so many good Italian breads around,
I think they could do better.
All of the pasta is made fresh at Osteria, making this
the place to be. 1 particularly enjoy the gnocchi, potato
dumpling pasta that many restaurants just can't get right.
Osteria's gnocchi is excellent: light but very filling, the
dumplings melt in you mouth. The large portion comes
with a meat sauce, but you can substitute with any of
their other sauces.
Try the pomodoro e basilico, an excellent light tomato
sauce with strong traces of basil and finely chopped onions.
Osteria offers several specials — the fish of the day as
well as a pasta. My guest and I tried the torteloni, a
tortellini-like pasta filled with creamy chicken and topped
with a hearty tomato sauce. Other pastas include linguine
with red clam sauce, capellini al pomodoro e basilico,
tortellini, fettucine carbonaro . . . you can't go wrong.
Chicken, veal and fish dishes are a great choice whether
alone or after the pasta (as the Italians eat it). There is
a cheesy chicken parmigiana, a grilled chicken and sole

ones served here are sizable and sumptuous. Skip the
salad if you order one — the empanadas are really big.
When the craving for great barbeque or something a
little unusual hits, head over to Jose's. Your tastebuds
and tummy will be glad you did. — ET

with tomatoes and garlic, to name a few. All come with
perfectly cooked asparagus and carrots.
Sip some coffee, finish your wine, look around at the
faces. Osteria is a lively dining spot with very moderate
prices (pasta, $7-8, meat $10-12) for excellent food. Boun
appetito! — MM
Cenzo's
Univeristy Ave.
Palo Alto
322-1846
Right in the heart of Palo Alto on University Ave. is
Cenzo's, a casual yet pretty European-style restaurant
with framed Italian tourism posters on the walls. Although
not very wide, Cenzo's stretches far back with plenty of
tables along each wall and several larger tables in the
middle. The tables are close together but the atmosphere
is cozy rather than confining. Dinner at Cenzo's is a quiet
and calming affair.
A large counter toward the back of the restaurant is
where Cenzo's makes their salads. A nice way to start a
meal, the salads here are very large. A half-order of the
delicately seasoned Caesar salad is more than enough if
you plan to eat a full dinner. Wonderful grated parmesan
accents the salad nicely.
Cenzo's has a large selection of appetizers including
fried mozzarella — the crunchy coating contains the mel
ting cheese inside only until you take that first bite. In
addition, you can order small pizzas with your choice of
toppings.
One thing that makes Cenzo's special is the freshly
baked bread on every table. In many restaurants the
bread is an ordinary French, sourdough or Italian that
simply staves off hunger pangs until the meal arrives.
Not the case here — the bread comes in fiat strips (almost
like soft breadsticks) and is chewy and buttery with a
light herb flavoring, good for nibbling throughout the
entire meal.
I he nice-sized menu of meat, fish and pasta dishes is
diverse and tempting. My favorite is the rigatoni al
pomodoro: wide macaroni tubes with a fresh tomato,
mushroom and onion sauce, seasoned perfectly with garlic

and basil. This simple dish is anything but ordinary.
Attentive waiters sprinkle grated cheese or freshly ground
pepper at your request.
Another sure thing is the fettucine al'Adriatico: fresh
spinach noodles in a light cream sauce, topped with a
generous portion of tender prawns. Garlic adds a touch
of spice to this delicious dish. The tortellini carbonara
with its creamy "bacon and eggs" sauce over cheese stuffed
noodles also makes for a hearty meal.
A perfect ending to any Italian meal is coffee — steaming
hot espresso or cappuccino adds the perfect touch. Genzo's
offers a pleasant dining experience right down to the last
morsel. Prices range from $6-12 for most entrees. — MM
La I'astaia
120 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
323-2464
La Pastaia, an "Italian cafe," is the newest addition to
the Palo Alto Italian dining scene. This chic dining spot
with its expansive glass front is elegant and airy, but
never imposing. The front room looks out onto Emerson,
but the restaurant wraps around to a more private back
dining room. If you like gazing at tempting looking "dolci"
(Italian sweets), stick to the front room with a luscious
display behind the counter.
When you enter La Pastaia you'll be greeted by the
friendly hostess or the chefs gregarious husband. Every
one here is eager to please and very helpful. The menu
has two sides: a regular selection with appetizers, primi

Fuki-Sushi
4119 El ('amino Real
Palo Alto
494-9383
Offering just about anything that pops into mind, Fuki-
Sushi is the best all-around Japanese restaurant in the
area. The sushi bar is simply outstanding, serving tasty
fishes at tempting prices, while the luxurious dining rooms
hold other great surprises for the seekers of cooked cuisine.
What sets Fuki-Sushi apart from the other area res
taurants is atmosphere. Decorated authentically and taste
fully, the restaurant exudes a distinctly Japanese feel
when the diner steps through the front door, El Camin<
seems very far away.
The food is equally enjoyable, well-prepared and beauti
fully presented. The basic teriyaki and tempura are con
sistently outstanding, particularly when paired with some

(pasta) and secondi (meats); and a daily special side with
almost as many selections as the standard menu. There
is also an extensive wine list.
On every table, instead of the traditional basket of
sliced bread, La Pastaia places long crunchy breadsticka,
Italian style. Choose between butter and a spicy eggplant
tomato puree for dipping. It's a nice start to any meal.
At the hostess' suggestion, my guest and I ordered one
of the special appetizers — timbale di polenta e gorgonzola.
i he polenta (cooked corn meal) was loaded with gorgonzola
and fontina cheeses and studded with sweet currants. A
pepper tomato sauce edged the mound of polenta to make
a very attractive, as well as rich and delicious, first course.
Food presentation is important to the chef at La Pastaia
but only as the finishing touch to an already well
prepared meal. The tortellini con salmone, a feast of pinks
and greens, looked too good to eat — but once we began,
it was easy to keep going. The spinach tortellini were
filled with mild ricotta and served with a salmon cream
sauce. To top it off, fresh salmon slices were layered over
the pasta for a wonderful combination of flavors.
Another excellent choice is the simple but satisfying
linguini as pomodoro. The fresh tomatoes, garlic and
oregano blend for a light summery sauce, a perfect ac
companiment to the fresh pasta. A touch of pungent
parmesean makes it complete.
Dining at La Pastaia heightens one's appreciation for
fine food. The dishes really taste as good as they look —
and vice versa. Prices are extremely reasonable ($B-12
for most entrees) for a meal of this caliber. Mange bene!

taurants is atmosphere. Decorated authentically and taste
fully, the restaurant exudes a distinctly Japanese feel
when the diner steps through the front door, El Camin<
seems very far away.
The food is equally enjoyable, well-prepared and beauti
fully presented. The basic teriyaki and tempura are con
sistently outstanding, particularly when paired with some

(pasta) and secondi (meats); and a daily special side with
almost as many selections as the standard menu. There
is also an extensive wine list.
On every table, instead of the traditional basket of
sliced bread, La Pastaia places long crunchy breadsticka,
Italian style. Choose between butter and a spicy eggplant
tomato puree for dipping. It's a nice start to any meal.
At the hostess' suggestion, my guest and I ordered one
of the special appetizers — timbale di polenta e gorgonzola.
i he polenta (cooked corn meal) was loaded with gorgonzola
and fontina cheeses and studded with sweet currants. A
pepper tomato sauce edged the mound of polenta to make
a very attractive, as well as rich and delicious, first course.
Food presentation is important to the chef at La Pastaia
but only as the finishing touch to an already well
prepared meal. The tortellini con salmone, a feast of pinks
and greens, looked too good to eat — but once we began,
it was easy to keep going. The spinach tortellini were
filled with mild ricotta and served with a salmon cream
sauce. To top it off, fresh salmon slices were layered over
the pasta for a wonderful combination of flavors.
Another excellent choice is the simple but satisfying
linguini as pomodoro. The fresh tomatoes, garlic and
oregano blend for a light summery sauce, a perfect ac
companiment to the fresh pasta. A touch of pungent
parmesean makes it complete.
Dining at La Pastaia heightens one's appreciation for
fine food. The dishes really taste as good as they look —
and vice versa. Prices are extremely reasonable ($B-12
for most entrees) for a meal of this caliber. Mange bene!

delicious sashimi (sliced raw fish that is not served on rice).
1 he best bet here, however, is the do-it-yourself dishes.
No, you won't get to do all of the fun stuff the chefs at

However, the limited diner participation in preparing

as thrilling, yield equally delicious results.

Just as Stanford is one of the most diverse universities
in the nation, so too is the dining scene in neighboring
Palo Alto. Catering to a variety of cultivated culinary
tastes, restauranteurs in the area have assembled a wide
array of places to satisfy even the most discriminating
diner.
For the lover of foreign fare, Palo Alto is indeed a
blessing. It would take months of continuous dining in
order to exhaust the supply of exotic eateries. From
Chinese to Cuban to Italian, the local restaurant scene
is embarrassed with riches.
As in any community, however, some spots shine
brighter than the others, possessing some special spark
that makes them a diner's special favorite. Whether it
be ambiance, service with a smile or just plain great food,
several select restaurants rise up from among the masses
and leave the customer with an especially warm feeling.
To give you a head start on your quest for quality
cuisine, here are some of the area's most interesting and
enjoyable purveyors of fine fare.
Jing-Jing
443 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
328-6885
Next to the great hole-in-the-wall places prevalent in
Chinatown, Jing-Jing offers some of the best Chinese
food in the Bay Area. 'I he menu claims they cook their
fare the way it should be, which after any meal eaten

proves to be a statement not of self-aggrandizement but
of honesty.
The menu is sizeable and diverse, featuring several
varieties of Chinese cuisine. For folks with fortitude as
well as for the foolhardy, Jing-Jing proudly serves over
two-dozen scaldingly spicy Szechuan dishes that rank
among the restaurant's best offerings. The courageous
diners that order from the red page of the menu devoted
to the hot stuff will definitely find themselves rewarded.
Some of the finest dishes not bearing the red temper
ature warning include two great poultry dishes, cashew
chicken and mu-shu chicken (the traditional mu-shu in
gredient, pork, is available, as is beef, but poultry provides
an unusual change of taste). Appealing to the eye as well
as to the tongue, beef and scallops on a sizzling plate is
another real winner.
However, at lunchtime Jing-Jing really shines with
their inexpensive yet exquisite lunch specials. For $3.95,
the diner receives a cup of hot-and-sour soup and a choice
of two dishes out of about a dozen. Jing-Jing is clearly
one of the best lunch bargains around, providing truly
tasty vittles for the price of a slimy burger and fries. —

Hsi-Nan
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065
If you don't look carefully, you might very well overlook
a small but sumptuous Chinese restaurant. Tucked away
inconspicuously next to the University Creamery (from
where, incidentally, the soft drinks and ice cream served
here actually come — the same man owns both places)
the 12-table Hsi-Nan is one of Palo Alto's buried treasures.
As strange as it may seem, Pve yet to go beyond one

dish in all of the times I've eaten there, not because of
any lassitude but because of total satiation. Quite simply,
the sweet and sour prawns are heavenly: The lightly fried
prawns and fresh-cooked vegetables are covered by an
amazing sauce, with a light sprinkling of sesame seeds
to give just the right touch. The dish is so good, in fact,
that even after three consecutive meals 1 was still reeling
in culinary ecstasy.
At $8.50 for the prawns and comparable prices for
other dishes, Hsi-Nan is not cheap, probably one of the
reasons that I've yet to encounter more than a handful
of patrons at any one time. However, since each of these
people seemed to have enjoyed their feast (as have all of
the guests I've invited to dine there with me), the spot
seems a safe bet for prawn-lovers and non-prawn-lovers
alike.
By the way, the last person I went there with ordered
chicken in Peking sauce and really enjoyed it. The dish
is a little heavy on the onions but well worth a try. Just
have a pack of Certs handy for the needed after-dinner
mint. — ET
Happy Lye Lye
406 California Ave.
Palo Alto
327-1688
Palo Alto's consummate hole-in-the-wall is Happy Lye
Lye, a moderately small but good Chinese restaurant
nestled among the shops lining California Ave. The fare
is always fantastic, and the prices are very reasonable.
The highlight here is the shrimp with lobster sauce.

Jose's
2275 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6522
Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best restaurant
in Palo Alto. Blending a soothing ambiance with delicious
food, Jose's provides the perfect meal.
This is no ordinary place. The small, dimly lit restaurant
exudes a character that must be experienced to be fully
appreciated. Jose has taken great care in his choice of
decorations, from the large fish tank in the entry to the
unusual collection of artwork on the walls, resulting in
a truly unique atmosphere.
Yes, that's right, there is a real Jose (who, incidentally,
looks just like the picture painted on the front window,
sans the hoop earring) and he is more than just a

Whereas most Chinese restaurants serve the shellfish
bathed in a fairly bland yellowish sauce, Happy Lye Lye
adds some tasty black beans and other surprises to make
a thicker light brown sauce. Atop steamed rice, the dish
is satiating.
Soup is another strong point. The restaurant offers
only a handul, but all are good, and the kwo won ton is
clearly the best. The cooks add a healthy helping of fresh
vegetables, meat and shrimp to the standard won ton
soup base, creating a hearty broth that is almost a meal
itself.
But whatthing that separates Happy Lye Lye from all
of the rest is their dinner specials. Extending the concept
of a lunch special into the suppertime hours, the restaurant
offers a complete meal with soup for about $5. Quite a
bargain, and a delicious one at that. — ET
O'Mei
1438 El Camino Heal
Menlo Park
323-2700
Owned by a Japanese man and his Chinese wife, O'Mei
provides elegant food in a less than formal, but still very
pleasant, setting. The service is especially friendly and
greatly enhances a fine dining experience.
The menu is extensive but not overpriced, and after
dining there on over a dozen occasions I've yet to get a
bum dish.
You just can't lose at O'Mei.
Go give it a try — the place will speak for itself. — ET

figurehead. Quite often, you can see him puttering around
the kitchen next to his cooks or shmoozing with the
patrons. If asked, he'll even autograph a menu.
As for cuisine, this is where Jose's really shines. Ab
solutely everything on the menu is delicious, from the
harbeque fare to the pizza to the empanadas. Even the
common burrito tastes that much better with Jose's spe
cial touch.
The barbeque dishes are the jewels in Jose's crown
Billed as "the baddest barbeque in town," the ribs and
chicken explode with flavor under the delicious sauce Jose
has created. The feast comes with the South American
staple of black beans and rice, a mild counterpoint to the
smoking barbeque entree.
Another treat is the Argentinian pizza, thinner and
crisper than its Italian counterpart. Available with a sour
dough or whole-wheat crust, the diner can also opt to

replace the standard tomato-based sauce with the
dynamite barbeque sauce. It sounds unappetizing but is
really delicious.
Empanadas seem to be Jose's specialty, however. Sold
frozen next door in the Empanada Factory, the fresh

Osteria
247 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto
328-5700
For hustle, bustle and excellent Tuscan cuisine, try
Osteria, the very popular and crowded restaurant at the
corner of Hamilton and Ramona. Osteria is small, but it
makes the most of the space it has and seems to keep
all its tables constantly filled. The pretty arches and
ceramic tile accents add a simple touch to the busy at
mosphere. Fortunately, the noise level is manageable and
it is easy to carry on a conversation.
Osteria has a nice choice of antipasti to get your meal
started, including a shrimp cocktail, buffalo mozzarella
and shrimp with artichokes. My favorite is the melone e
prosciutto: salty Italian "ham" wrapped around sweet
juicy melon is definitely an appetizing must. There are
also soups like minestrone and healthy salads as well.
The Caesar salad is very good, especially if you are a
garlic lover.
My only real complaint with Osteria is their bread.
Sourdough bread may be the San Francisco favorite, but
it is not Italian. With so many good Italian breads around,
I think they could do better.
All of the pasta is made fresh at Osteria, making this
the place to be. 1 particularly enjoy the gnocchi, potato
dumpling pasta that many restaurants just can't get right.
Osteria's gnocchi is excellent: light but very filling, the
dumplings melt in you mouth. The large portion comes
with a meat sauce, but you can substitute with any of
their other sauces.
Try the pomodoro e basilico, an excellent light tomato
sauce with strong traces of basil and finely chopped onions.
Osteria offers several specials — the fish of the day as
well as a pasta. My guest and I tried the torteloni, a
tortellini-like pasta filled with creamy chicken and topped
with a hearty tomato sauce. Other pastas include linguine
with red clam sauce, capellini al pomodoro e basilico,
tortellini, fettucine carbonaro . . . you can't go wrong.
Chicken, veal and fish dishes are a great choice whether
alone or after the pasta (as the Italians eat it). There is
a cheesy chicken parmigiana, a grilled chicken and sole

ones served here are sizable and sumptuous. Skip the
salad if you order one — the empanadas are really big.
When the craving for great barbeque or something a
little unusual hits, head over to Jose's. Your tastebuds
and tummy will be glad you did. — ET

with tomatoes and garlic, to name a few. All come with
perfectly cooked asparagus and carrots.
Sip some coffee, finish your wine, look around at the
faces. Osteria is a lively dining spot with very moderate
prices (pasta, $7-8, meat $10-12) for excellent food. Boun
appetito! — MM
Cenzo's
Univeristy Ave.
Palo Alto
322-1846
Right in the heart of Palo Alto on University Ave. is
Cenzo's, a casual yet pretty European-style restaurant
with framed Italian tourism posters on the walls. Although
not very wide, Cenzo's stretches far back with plenty of
tables along each wall and several larger tables in the
middle. The tables are close together but the atmosphere
is cozy rather than confining. Dinner at Cenzo's is a quiet
and calming affair.
A large counter toward the back of the restaurant is
where Cenzo's makes their salads. A nice way to start a
meal, the salads here are very large. A half-order of the
delicately seasoned Caesar salad is more than enough if
you plan to eat a full dinner. Wonderful grated parmesan
accents the salad nicely.
Cenzo's has a large selection of appetizers including
fried mozzarella — the crunchy coating contains the mel
ting cheese inside only until you take that first bite. In
addition, you can order small pizzas with your choice of
toppings.
One thing that makes Cenzo's special is the freshly
baked bread on every table. In many restaurants the
bread is an ordinary French, sourdough or Italian that
simply staves off hunger pangs until the meal arrives.
Not the case here — the bread comes in fiat strips (almost
like soft breadsticks) and is chewy and buttery with a
light herb flavoring, good for nibbling throughout the
entire meal.
I he nice-sized menu of meat, fish and pasta dishes is
diverse and tempting. My favorite is the rigatoni al
pomodoro: wide macaroni tubes with a fresh tomato,
mushroom and onion sauce, seasoned perfectly with garlic

and basil. This simple dish is anything but ordinary.
Attentive waiters sprinkle grated cheese or freshly ground
pepper at your request.
Another sure thing is the fettucine al'Adriatico: fresh
spinach noodles in a light cream sauce, topped with a
generous portion of tender prawns. Garlic adds a touch
of spice to this delicious dish. The tortellini carbonara
with its creamy "bacon and eggs" sauce over cheese stuffed
noodles also makes for a hearty meal.
A perfect ending to any Italian meal is coffee — steaming
hot espresso or cappuccino adds the perfect touch. Genzo's
offers a pleasant dining experience right down to the last
morsel. Prices range from $6-12 for most entrees. — MM
La I'astaia
120 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
323-2464
La Pastaia, an "Italian cafe," is the newest addition to
the Palo Alto Italian dining scene. This chic dining spot
with its expansive glass front is elegant and airy, but
never imposing. The front room looks out onto Emerson,
but the restaurant wraps around to a more private back
dining room. If you like gazing at tempting looking "dolci"
(Italian sweets), stick to the front room with a luscious
display behind the counter.
When you enter La Pastaia you'll be greeted by the
friendly hostess or the chefs gregarious husband. Every
one here is eager to please and very helpful. The menu

Offering just about anything that pops into mind, Fuki-
Sushi is the best all-around Japanese restaurant in the

fishes at tempting prices, while the luxurious dining rooms

A perfect ending to any Italian meal is coffee — steaming
hot espresso or cappuccino adds the perfect touch. Genzo's
offers a pleasant dining experience right down to the last
morsel. Prices range from $6-12 for most entrees. — MM
La I'astaia
120 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
323-2464
La Pastaia, an "Italian cafe," is the newest addition to
the Palo Alto Italian dining scene. This chic dining spot
with its expansive glass front is elegant and airy, but
never imposing. The front room looks out onto Emerson,
but the restaurant wraps around to a more private back
dining room. If you like gazing at tempting looking "dolci"
(Italian sweets), stick to the front room with a luscious
display behind the counter.
When you enter La Pastaia you'll be greeted by the
friendly hostess or the chefs gregarious husband. Every
one here is eager to please and very helpful. The menu
has two sides: a regular selection with appetizers, primi

Fuki-Sushi
4119 El ('amino Real
Palo Alto
494-9383
Offering just about anything that pops into mind, Fuki-
Sushi is the best all-around Japanese restaurant in the
area. The sushi bar is simply outstanding, serving tasty
fishes at tempting prices, while the luxurious dining rooms
hold other great surprises for the seekers of cooked cuisine.
What sets Fuki-Sushi apart from the other area res
taurants is atmosphere. Decorated authentically and taste
fully, the restaurant exudes a distinctly Japanese feel
when the diner steps through the front door, El Camin<
seems very far away.
The food is equally enjoyable, well-prepared and beauti
fully presented. The basic teriyaki and tempura are con
sistently outstanding, particularly when paired with some

(pasta) and secondi (meats); and a daily special side with
almost as many selections as the standard menu. There
is also an extensive wine list.
On every table, instead of the traditional basket of
sliced bread, La Pastaia places long crunchy breadsticka,
Italian style. Choose between butter and a spicy eggplant
tomato puree for dipping. It's a nice start to any meal.
At the hostess' suggestion, my guest and I ordered one
of the special appetizers — timbale di polenta e gorgonzola.
i he polenta (cooked corn meal) was loaded with gorgonzola
and fontina cheeses and studded with sweet currants. A
pepper tomato sauce edged the mound of polenta to make
a very attractive, as well as rich and delicious, first course.
Food presentation is important to the chef at La Pastaia
but only as the finishing touch to an already well
prepared meal. The tortellini con salmone, a feast of pinks
and greens, looked too good to eat — but once we began,
it was easy to keep going. The spinach tortellini were
filled with mild ricotta and served with a salmon cream
sauce. To top it off, fresh salmon slices were layered over
the pasta for a wonderful combination of flavors.
Another excellent choice is the simple but satisfying
linguini as pomodoro. The fresh tomatoes, garlic and
oregano blend for a light summery sauce, a perfect ac
companiment to the fresh pasta. A touch of pungent
parmesean makes it complete.
Dining at La Pastaia heightens one's appreciation for
fine food. The dishes really taste as good as they look —
and vice versa. Prices are extremely reasonable ($B-12
for most entrees) for a meal of this caliber. Mange bene!

delicious sashimi (sliced raw fish that is not served on rice).
1 he best bet here, however, is the do-it-yourself dishes.
No, you won't get to do all of the fun stuff the chefs at
Benihana's do, as insurance companies are not apt to
cover restaurants that encourage their customers to ma
nipulate razor-sharp cutlery at blinding speeds.
However, the limited diner participation in preparing
shabu sabu (meat and vegetables in a miso soup base)
and chanko nabe (seafood in a similar base), while not
as thrilling, yield equally delicious results.
The luckv customers that order either of these dishes
are presented with a tureen of hot water, an assortment
of vegetables and tofu plus a plate of meat or fish. By
combining the ingredients that strike the eater's fancy
into the water, a tasty dish develops that utterly destroys
all of the subliminal warnings implanted during childhood
that advise, "Don't play with your food." — ET

Just as Stanford is one of the most diverse universities
in the nation, so too is the dining scene in neighboring
Palo Alto. Catering to a variety of cultivated culinary
tastes, restauranteurs in the area have assembled a wide
array of places to satisfy even the most discriminating
diner.
For the lover of foreign fare, Palo Alto is indeed a
blessing. It would take months of continuous dining in
order to exhaust the supply of exotic eateries. From
Chinese to Cuban to Italian, the local restaurant scene
is embarrassed with riches.
As in any community, however, some spots shine
brighter than the others, possessing some special spark
that makes them a diner's special favorite. Whether it
be ambiance, service with a smile or just plain great food,
several select restaurants rise up from among the masses
and leave the customer with an especially warm feeling.
To give you a head start on your quest for quality
cuisine, here are some of the area's most interesting and
enjoyable purveyors of fine fare.
Jing-Jing
443 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
328-6885
Next to the great hole-in-the-wall places prevalent in
Chinatown, Jing-Jing offers some of the best Chinese
food in the Bay Area. 'I he menu claims they cook their
fare the way it should be, which after any meal eaten

proves to be a statement not of self-aggrandizement but
of honesty.
The menu is sizeable and diverse, featuring several
varieties of Chinese cuisine. For folks with fortitude as
well as for the foolhardy, Jing-Jing proudly serves over
two-dozen scaldingly spicy Szechuan dishes that rank
among the restaurant's best offerings. The courageous
diners that order from the red page of the menu devoted
to the hot stuff will definitely find themselves rewarded.
Some of the finest dishes not bearing the red temper
ature warning include two great poultry dishes, cashew
chicken and mu-shu chicken (the traditional mu-shu in
gredient, pork, is available, as is beef, but poultry provides
an unusual change of taste). Appealing to the eye as well
as to the tongue, beef and scallops on a sizzling plate is
another real winner.
However, at lunchtime Jing-Jing really shines with
their inexpensive yet exquisite lunch specials. For $3.95,
the diner receives a cup of hot-and-sour soup and a choice
of two dishes out of about a dozen. Jing-Jing is clearly
one of the best lunch bargains around, providing truly
tasty vittles for the price of a slimy burger and fries. —

Hsi-Nan
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065
If you don't look carefully, you might very well overlook
a small but sumptuous Chinese restaurant. Tucked away
inconspicuously next to the University Creamery (from
where, incidentally, the soft drinks and ice cream served
here actually come — the same man owns both places)
the 12-table Hsi-Nan is one of Palo Alto's buried treasures.
As strange as it may seem, Pve yet to go beyond one

dish in all of the times I've eaten there, not because of
any lassitude but because of total satiation. Quite simply,
the sweet and sour prawns are heavenly: The lightly fried
prawns and fresh-cooked vegetables are covered by an
amazing sauce, with a light sprinkling of sesame seeds
to give just the right touch. The dish is so good, in fact,
that even after three consecutive meals 1 was still reeling
in culinary ecstasy.
At $8.50 for the prawns and comparable prices for
other dishes, Hsi-Nan is not cheap, probably one of the
reasons that I've yet to encounter more than a handful
of patrons at any one time. However, since each of these
people seemed to have enjoyed their feast (as have all of
the guests I've invited to dine there with me), the spot
seems a safe bet for prawn-lovers and non-prawn-lovers
alike.
By the way, the last person I went there with ordered
chicken in Peking sauce and really enjoyed it. The dish
is a little heavy on the onions but well worth a try. Just
have a pack of Certs handy for the needed after-dinner
mint. — ET
Happy Lye Lye
406 California Ave.
Palo Alto
327-1688
Palo Alto's consummate hole-in-the-wall is Happy Lye
Lye, a moderately small but good Chinese restaurant
nestled among the shops lining California Ave. The fare
is always fantastic, and the prices are very reasonable.
The highlight here is the shrimp with lobster sauce.

Jose's
2275 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6522
Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the best restaurant
in Palo Alto. Blending a soothing ambiance with delicious
food, Jose's provides the perfect meal.
This is no ordinary place. The small, dimly lit restaurant
exudes a character that must be experienced to be fully
appreciated. Jose has taken great care in his choice of
decorations, from the large fish tank in the entry to the
unusual collection of artwork on the walls, resulting in
a truly unique atmosphere.
Yes, that's right, there is a real Jose (who, incidentally,
looks just like the picture painted on the front window,
sans the hoop earring) and he is more than just a

Whereas most Chinese restaurants serve the shellfish
bathed in a fairly bland yellowish sauce, Happy Lye Lye
adds some tasty black beans and other surprises to make
a thicker light brown sauce. Atop steamed rice, the dish
is satiating.
Soup is another strong point. The restaurant offers
only a handul, but all are good, and the kwo won ton is
clearly the best. The cooks add a healthy helping of fresh
vegetables, meat and shrimp to the standard won ton
soup base, creating a hearty broth that is almost a meal
itself.
But whatthing that separates Happy Lye Lye from all
of the rest is their dinner specials. Extending the concept
of a lunch special into the suppertime hours, the restaurant
offers a complete meal with soup for about $5. Quite a
bargain, and a delicious one at that. — ET
O'Mei
1438 El Camino Heal
Menlo Park
323-2700
Owned by a Japanese man and his Chinese wife, O'Mei
provides elegant food in a less than formal, but still very
pleasant, setting. The service is especially friendly and
greatly enhances a fine dining experience.
The menu is extensive but not overpriced, and after
dining there on over a dozen occasions I've yet to get a
bum dish.
You just can't lose at O'Mei.
Go give it a try — the place will speak for itself. — ET

figurehead. Quite often, you can see him puttering around
the kitchen next to his cooks or shmoozing with the
patrons. If asked, he'll even autograph a menu.
As for cuisine, this is where Jose's really shines. Ab
solutely everything on the menu is delicious, from the
harbeque fare to the pizza to the empanadas. Even the
common burrito tastes that much better with Jose's spe
cial touch.
The barbeque dishes are the jewels in Jose's crown
Billed as "the baddest barbeque in town," the ribs and
chicken explode with flavor under the delicious sauce Jose
has created. The feast comes with the South American
staple of black beans and rice, a mild counterpoint to the
smoking barbeque entree.
Another treat is the Argentinian pizza, thinner and
crisper than its Italian counterpart. Available with a sour
dough or whole-wheat crust, the diner can also opt to

replace the standard tomato-based sauce with the
dynamite barbeque sauce. It sounds unappetizing but is
really delicious.
Empanadas seem to be Jose's specialty, however. Sold
frozen next door in the Empanada Factory, the fresh

Osteria
247 Hamilton Ave.
Palo Alto
328-5700
For hustle, bustle and excellent Tuscan cuisine, try
Osteria, the very popular and crowded restaurant at the
corner of Hamilton and Ramona. Osteria is small, but it
makes the most of the space it has and seems to keep
all its tables constantly filled. The pretty arches and
ceramic tile accents add a simple touch to the busy at
mosphere. Fortunately, the noise level is manageable and
it is easy to carry on a conversation.
Osteria has a nice choice of antipasti to get your meal
started, including a shrimp cocktail, buffalo mozzarella
and shrimp with artichokes. My favorite is the melone e
prosciutto: salty Italian "ham" wrapped around sweet
juicy melon is definitely an appetizing must. There are
also soups like minestrone and healthy salads as well.
The Caesar salad is very good, especially if you are a
garlic lover.
My only real complaint with Osteria is their bread.
Sourdough bread may be the San Francisco favorite, but
it is not Italian. With so many good Italian breads around,
I think they could do better.
All of the pasta is made fresh at Osteria, making this
the place to be. 1 particularly enjoy the gnocchi, potato
dumpling pasta that many restaurants just can't get right.
Osteria's gnocchi is excellent: light but very filling, the
dumplings melt in you mouth. The large portion comes
with a meat sauce, but you can substitute with any of
their other sauces.
Try the pomodoro e basilico, an excellent light tomato
sauce with strong traces of basil and finely chopped onions.
Osteria offers several specials — the fish of the day as
well as a pasta. My guest and I tried the torteloni, a
tortellini-like pasta filled with creamy chicken and topped
with a hearty tomato sauce. Other pastas include linguine
with red clam sauce, capellini al pomodoro e basilico,
tortellini, fettucine carbonaro . . . you can't go wrong.
Chicken, veal and fish dishes are a great choice whether
alone or after the pasta (as the Italians eat it). There is
a cheesy chicken parmigiana, a grilled chicken and sole

ones served here are sizable and sumptuous. Skip the
salad if you order one — the empanadas are really big.
When the craving for great barbeque or something a
little unusual hits, head over to Jose's. Your tastebuds
and tummy will be glad you did. — ET

with tomatoes and garlic, to name a few. All come with
perfectly cooked asparagus and carrots.
Sip some coffee, finish your wine, look around at the
faces. Osteria is a lively dining spot with very moderate
prices (pasta, $7-8, meat $10-12) for excellent food. Boun
appetito! — MM
Cenzo's
Univeristy Ave.
Palo Alto
322-1846
Right in the heart of Palo Alto on University Ave. is
Cenzo's, a casual yet pretty European-style restaurant
with framed Italian tourism posters on the walls. Although
not very wide, Cenzo's stretches far back with plenty of
tables along each wall and several larger tables in the
middle. The tables are close together but the atmosphere
is cozy rather than confining. Dinner at Cenzo's is a quiet
and calming affair.
A large counter toward the back of the restaurant is
where Cenzo's makes their salads. A nice way to start a
meal, the salads here are very large. A half-order of the
delicately seasoned Caesar salad is more than enough if
you plan to eat a full dinner. Wonderful grated parmesan
accents the salad nicely.
Cenzo's has a large selection of appetizers including
fried mozzarella — the crunchy coating contains the mel
ting cheese inside only until you take that first bite. In
addition, you can order small pizzas with your choice of
toppings.
One thing that makes Cenzo's special is the freshly
baked bread on every table. In many restaurants the
bread is an ordinary French, sourdough or Italian that
simply staves off hunger pangs until the meal arrives.
Not the case here — the bread comes in fiat strips (almost
like soft breadsticks) and is chewy and buttery with a
light herb flavoring, good for nibbling throughout the
entire meal.
I he nice-sized menu of meat, fish and pasta dishes is
diverse and tempting. My favorite is the rigatoni al
pomodoro: wide macaroni tubes with a fresh tomato,
mushroom and onion sauce, seasoned perfectly with garlic

and basil. This simple dish is anything but ordinary.
Attentive waiters sprinkle grated cheese or freshly ground
pepper at your request.
Another sure thing is the fettucine al'Adriatico: fresh
spinach noodles in a light cream sauce, topped with a
generous portion of tender prawns. Garlic adds a touch
of spice to this delicious dish. The tortellini carbonara
with its creamy "bacon and eggs" sauce over cheese stuffed
noodles also makes for a hearty meal.
A perfect ending to any Italian meal is coffee — steaming
hot espresso or cappuccino adds the perfect touch. Genzo's
offers a pleasant dining experience right down to the last
morsel. Prices range from $6-12 for most entrees. — MM
