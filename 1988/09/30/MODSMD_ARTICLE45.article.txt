# More than just a bite to eat
## A
						guide to some of the area's finest restaurants 
### Mia Manzulli Evan Tuchinsky 
Just as Stanford is one of the most diverse universities
in the nation, so too is the dining scene in neighboring
Palo Alto. Catering to a variety of cultivated culinary
tastes, restauranteurs in the area have assembled a wide
array of places to satisfy even the most discriminating
diner.
For the lover of foreign fare, Palo Alto is indeed a
blessing. It would take months of continuous dining in
order to exhaust the supply of exotic eateries. From
Chinese to Cuban to Italian, the local restaurant scene
is embarrassed with riches.
As in any community, however, some spots shine
brighter than the others, possessing some special spark
that makes them a diner's special favorite. Whether it
be ambiance, service with a smile or just plain great food,
several select restaurants rise up from among the masses
and leave the customer with an especially warm feeling.
To give you a head start on your quest for quality
cuisine, here are some of the area's most interesting and
enjoyable purveyors of fine fare.
Jing-Jing
443 Emerson St.
Palo Alto
328-6885
Next to the great hole-in-the-wall places prevalent in
Chinatown, Jing-Jing offers some of the best Chinese
food in the Bay Area. 'I he menu claims they cook their
fare the way it should be, which after any meal eaten

proves to be a statement not of self-aggrandizement but
of honesty.
The menu is sizeable and diverse, featuring several
varieties of Chinese cuisine. For folks with fortitude as
well as for the foolhardy, Jing-Jing proudly serves over
two-dozen scaldingly spicy Szechuan dishes that rank
among the restaurant's best offerings. The courageous
diners that order from the red page of the menu devoted
to the hot stuff will definitely find themselves rewarded.
Some of the finest dishes not bearing the red temper
ature warning include two great poultry dishes, cashew
chicken and mu-shu chicken (the traditional mu-shu in
gredient, pork, is available, as is beef, but poultry provides
an unusual change of taste). Appealing to the eye as well
as to the tongue, beef and scallops on a sizzling plate is
another real winner.
However, at lunchtime Jing-Jing really shines with
their inexpensive yet exquisite lunch specials. For $3.95,
the diner receives a cup of hot-and-sour soup and a choice
of two dishes out of about a dozen. Jing-Jing is clearly
one of the best lunch bargains around, providing truly
tasty vittles for the price of a slimy burger and fries. —

Hsi-Nan
203 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-6065
If you don't look carefully, you might very well overlook
a small but sumptuous Chinese restaurant. Tucked away
inconspicuously next to the University Creamery (from
where, incidentally, the soft drinks and ice cream served
here actually come — the same man owns both places)
the 12-table Hsi-Nan is one of Palo Alto's buried treasures.
As strange as it may seem, Pve yet to go beyond one
