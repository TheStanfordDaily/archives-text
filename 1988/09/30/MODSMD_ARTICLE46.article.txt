# CUR TAINUP!
## Theater options from Stanford to San Francisco 
### Chris Shuttlesworth 
So you've been to see "Roger Rab
bit," "Big," "Bull Durham" and the
latest Freddie flick. You've danced
your feet off at the Vortex and
laughed yourself silly at Rooster T.
Feathers.
The ballet not for you? Can't stand
the opera — even with subtitles?
Bored by the symphony?
Never fear. There is something else
in the vast entertainment world, and
it's the perfect compliment to dinner
at a fine (or even not-so-fine) restau
rant.
If you've never been to the theater
before, Stanford is a great place to
fall in love with the dramatic arts.
Even seasoned theater-goers will be
happy with not only the choices avail
able in nearby San Francisco, but
also with the treasure trove of local
theater opportunities, both on and
off campus.
The City theater scene should be
especially lively this season, as several
long running shows have closed to
make way for some new and exciting
pieces.
Marines Memorial Theater has said
goodbye to Phyllis Oilier and "Nun
sense" and hello to George Peppard
and "Papa," a one-man Hemingway
show running through October 16.
"Papa" has just finished runs in
Boise (the last place Hemingway
called home), Cleveland, Atlanta and
Chicago, and is based on James
McLendon's biography of Hemingway
as well as the writer's own letters.
Following "Papa" at the Marines
is "Sammy Cahn: Words and Music"

which will run through December 18.
This "living musical museum" had a
very popular eleven-week run last
spring before leaving for London.
"Greater Tuna" has left the Mason
Street Theater, to be replaced by "On
The Avenue," a musical tribute to
Paris. "Tuna," which ran for over
four years, may return after the first
of the year at the One Act Theater,
which is currently offering the criti
cally acclaimed "Steven Banks' Home
Entertainment Center."
Around the corner on Geary
Street's Theater Row, the American
Conservatory Theater is looking for
ward to a new season, which will
include Eugene O'Neill's "Marco Mil
lions," Alan Ayckbourn's "A Woman
in Mind," the annual production of
"A Christmas Carol," August Wil
son's "Joe Turner's Come and Gone,"
J.B. Priestley's "When We are
Married," George Bernard Shaw's
"St. Joan," George Walker's "Noth
ing Sacred" and Stephen Sondheim's
"A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum."
Theater on the Square offers a pro
duction of "The Phantom of the
Opera" opening next Wednesday, but
don't expect the Andrew Lloyd Weber
Broadway smash. This is a produc
tion of the original "Phantom" that
features an operatic score and shares
only the title with the current New
York/London hit.
The Zephyr Theater is currently
offering three shows in its multi
house complex. The three shows, all
of which have open-ended runs, are
"A Couple of Blaguards," "Party of

One" and "Bar None" (opens October
14).
Featuring a mixture of first-run
new plays and established Broadway
and London hits, the Magic Theatre
at Fort Mason will be offering 11
plays this season, including Eric
Bogosian's "Talk Radio," Hugh Whit
more's "Breaking the Code" and
Samuel Beckett's "Endgame."
A performance art mini-festival
and an Asian-American work are also
on the slate for the Magic Theater
season, as well as an opportunity for
college students to become student
members and save on tickets for
Magic Theater shows.
Much closer to home, Stanford of
fers two of its own first-rate theater
seasons through the Drama Depart
ment and Ram's Head Theatrical So
ciety.
The Drama Department plans to
produce eight shows in its "Season
of Classics." On the slate are Sop
hocles' "Antigone," Homer's "Iliad,"
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night,"
Mozart's "Bastien and Bastienne,"
Weiss' "Marat Sade," Shaffer's
"Equus," Middleton's "The Change
ling," and a new script that the de
partment "promises will become a
classic."
Ram's Head, Stanford's oldest and
largest all student-run theatrical so
ciety, embarks on its 78th season
with the annual "Big Game Gaieties"
during Big (lame week in November.
"Gaieties" pokes fun at Stanford life
and at the rivalry between Stanford
and Cal.
February brings the Original Win
ter One Acts, featuring three one act
plays written by Stanford
playwrights. The One Acts tradition
ally have showcased works that "test
the limits of standard dramatic
theatre," offering an innovative
theatrical experience.
The season closes with one of
Ram's Head's most ambitious pro
ductions to date, the Broadway mu
sical smash "A Chorus Line." With
a storyline based on musical audi
tions themselves, this show provides
quite a challenge for Stanford talent.
"A Chorus Line," the longest run
ning musical in Broadway history,
has been so successful because an
endless infusion of top young talent
has replaced the already talented cast
members that have left the show. It
will be interesting to see how the
Ram's Head version stacks up.
In the spring (and possibly even as
early as the winter!), look for many
dorms to put on their annual pro
ductions as well. These shows feature
bargain-priced tickets as well as an
enjoyable way to spend an evening
watching your fellow students show
off their hidden talents.
For those who want to venture away
from the Farm but still get in enough
sleep for that 8 a.m. class the next
morning, there are plenty of local
theater opportunites in the surround
ing areas.
The San .Jose Civic Light Opera is
offering a season of proven musical

smashes, including "La Cage Aux
Folles," "Sweeney Todd," "My One
and Only" and "West Side Story."
Also in San Jose, the Center for
the Performing Arts has announced
it will host the national touring pro
duction of "Dreamgirls" in October.
Other exciting shows possibly headed
for the Center are "Horn Yesterday"
and the first tour of Sondheim's "Into
the Woods."
Some current offerings of local
theater groups include Peninsula
Civic Light Opera's "The King and

I," Palo Alto Players' "Carousel" and
Menlo Players' Guild's "The Wom
en."
Other noteworthy organizations
whose productions should he worth
a look include the Los Altos Conser
vatory Theater, Foothill College and
Theaterworks.
Tickets for most local theater
groups can he purchased at the CAPA
Community Box Office, 1305 Mid
dlefield Road in Palo Alto or call 329-
2623. The Tresidder Box Office also
offers tickets for many theatrical
events in and around Stanford.

seasons through the Drama Depart
ment and Ram's Head Theatrical So
ciety.
The Drama Department plans to
produce eight shows in its "Season
of Classics." On the slate are Sop
hocles' "Antigone," Homer's "Iliad,"
Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night,"
Mozart's "Bastien and Bastienne,"
Weiss' "Marat Sade," Shaffer's
"Equus," Middleton's "The Change
ling," and a new script that the de
partment "promises will become a
classic."
Ram's Head, Stanford's oldest and
largest all student-run theatrical so
ciety, embarks on its 78th season
with the annual "Big Game Gaieties"
during Big (lame week in November.
"Gaieties" pokes fun at Stanford life
and at the rivalry between Stanford
and Cal.
February brings the Original Win
ter One Acts, featuring three one act
plays written by Stanford
playwrights. The One Acts tradition
ally have showcased works that "test
the limits of standard dramatic
theatre," offering an innovative
theatrical experience.
The season closes with one of
Ram's Head's most ambitious pro
ductions to date, the Broadway mu
sical smash "A Chorus Line." With
a storyline based on musical audi
tions themselves, this show provides
quite a challenge for Stanford talent.
"A Chorus Line," the longest run
ning musical in Broadway history,
has been so successful because an
endless infusion of top young talent
has replaced the already talented cast
members that have left the show. It
will be interesting to see how the
Ram's Head version stacks up.
In the spring (and possibly even as
early as the winter!), look for many
dorms to put on their annual pro
ductions as well. These shows feature
bargain-priced tickets as well as an
enjoyable way to spend an evening
watching your fellow students show
off their hidden talents.
For those who want to venture away
from the Farm but still get in enough
sleep for that 8 a.m. class the next
morning, there are plenty of local
theater opportunites in the surround
ing areas.
The San .Jose Civic Light Opera is
offering a season of proven musical

smashes, including "La Cage Aux
Folles," "Sweeney Todd," "My One
and Only" and "West Side Story."
Also in San Jose, the Center for
the Performing Arts has announced
it will host the national touring pro
duction of "Dreamgirls" in October.
Other exciting shows possibly headed
for the Center are "Horn Yesterday"
and the first tour of Sondheim's "Into
the Woods."
Some current offerings of local
theater groups include Peninsula
Civic Light Opera's "The King and

I," Palo Alto Players' "Carousel" and
Menlo Players' Guild's "The Wom
en."
Other noteworthy organizations
whose productions should he worth
a look include the Los Altos Conser
vatory Theater, Foothill College and
Theaterworks.
Tickets for most local theater
groups can he purchased at the CAPA
Community Box Office, 1305 Mid
dlefield Road in Palo Alto or call 329-
2623. The Tresidder Box Office also
offers tickets for many theatrical
events in and around Stanford.

So you've been to see "Roger Rab
bit," "Big," "Bull Durham" and the
latest Freddie flick. You've danced
your feet off at the Vortex and
laughed yourself silly at Rooster T.
Feathers.
The ballet not for you? Can't stand
the opera — even with subtitles?
Bored by the symphony?
Never fear. There is something else
in the vast entertainment world, and
it's the perfect compliment to dinner
at a fine (or even not-so-fine) restau
rant.
If you've never been to the theater
before, Stanford is a great place to
fall in love with the dramatic arts.
Even seasoned theater-goers will be
happy with not only the choices avail
able in nearby San Francisco, but
also with the treasure trove of local
theater opportunities, both on and
off campus.
The City theater scene should be
especially lively this season, as several
long running shows have closed to
make way for some new and exciting
pieces.
Marines Memorial Theater has said
goodbye to Phyllis Oilier and "Nun
sense" and hello to George Peppard
and "Papa," a one-man Hemingway
show running through October 16.
"Papa" has just finished runs in
Boise (the last place Hemingway
called home), Cleveland, Atlanta and
Chicago, and is based on James
McLendon's biography of Hemingway
as well as the writer's own letters.
Following "Papa" at the Marines
is "Sammy Cahn: Words and Music"

which will run through December 18.
This "living musical museum" had a
very popular eleven-week run last
spring before leaving for London.
"Greater Tuna" has left the Mason
Street Theater, to be replaced by "On
The Avenue," a musical tribute to
Paris. "Tuna," which ran for over
four years, may return after the first
of the year at the One Act Theater,
which is currently offering the criti
cally acclaimed "Steven Banks' Home
Entertainment Center."
Around the corner on Geary
Street's Theater Row, the American
Conservatory Theater is looking for
ward to a new season, which will
include Eugene O'Neill's "Marco Mil
lions," Alan Ayckbourn's "A Woman
in Mind," the annual production of
"A Christmas Carol," August Wil
son's "Joe Turner's Come and Gone,"
J.B. Priestley's "When We are
Married," George Bernard Shaw's
"St. Joan," George Walker's "Noth
ing Sacred" and Stephen Sondheim's
"A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum."
Theater on the Square offers a pro
duction of "The Phantom of the
Opera" opening next Wednesday, but
don't expect the Andrew Lloyd Weber
Broadway smash. This is a produc
tion of the original "Phantom" that
features an operatic score and shares
only the title with the current New
York/London hit.
The Zephyr Theater is currently
offering three shows in its multi
house complex. The three shows, all
of which have open-ended runs, are
"A Couple of Blaguards," "Party of

One" and "Bar None" (opens October
14).
Featuring a mixture of first-run
new plays and established Broadway
and London hits, the Magic Theatre
at Fort Mason will be offering 11
plays this season, including Eric
Bogosian's "Talk Radio," Hugh Whit
more's "Breaking the Code" and
Samuel Beckett's "Endgame."
A performance art mini-festival
and an Asian-American work are also
on the slate for the Magic Theater
season, as well as an opportunity for
college students to become student
members and save on tickets for
Magic Theater shows.
