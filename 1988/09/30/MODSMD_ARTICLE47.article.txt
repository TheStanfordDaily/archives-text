One of America's great cultural centers, San Francisco
really shines when it comes to the fine arts.
Located in the Civic Center, just a hop, skip and jump
from City Hall are the Opera House (right) and the stunning
Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall (above), a postmodern
masterpiece.
When your in the mood for something a bit more serious,
check out the current fare at these homes of the performing
arts. Perhaps you'll be fortunate enough to catch Bizet's
"Carmen" or sit in when Herbert Blomstedt leads the San
Francisco Philharmonic in a stirring rendition of Beethoven's
Ninth.
