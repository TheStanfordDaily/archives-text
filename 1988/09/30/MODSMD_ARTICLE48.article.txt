San Francisco proudly plays home to some of the finest
architecture in the United States.
Grace Cathedral (above) revives the medieval Gothic
tradition with dramatic vaulted ceilings and stunning
stained glass windows.
When the original City Hall was destroyed by the Great
Earthquake of 1906, the Beaux-Arts Classical movement
was all the rage in architecture. The current City Hall
(above, right) is an exquisite and faithful execution of
the style that recalls the grandeur of ancient Greece and
Rome.
The seat of city government, where Mayor Art Agnos
does his work, has a stunning ornamented dome, gargoyled
finials and a marble balustrade.
The Mark Hopkins Hotel (right) is an early skyscraper
located atop Nob Hill, one of the City's most elegant
spots. The views are spectacular and the glitterati are
omnipresent.
