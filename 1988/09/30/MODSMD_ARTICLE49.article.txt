If you were only going to spend
one day in the City in your entire
life these three tourist attractions
would probably be on your agenda.
Fisherman's Wharf (above) is no
longer dominated by salty fishermen,
seagulls and the pungent smell of
freshly cleaned fish. Though the

nearby slips still berth trawlers, the
surrounding Wharf area has been
taken over by wax museums, carnival
rides and tourist shops. Some of the
City's best seafood is for sale along
the Wharf.
Union Square (below, left) is San
Francisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of the

cities most swank shops and hotels
including Saks and the St. Francis
Hank the square.
To many San Franciscans, the
Cable Cars (below, right) are more
than just a means of transportation,
they're a way of life.
