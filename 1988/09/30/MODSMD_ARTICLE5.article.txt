# Students still forced to camp for classes
## 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
The quarter has just begun, but
already dozens of eager students
have pulled all-nighters for classes
â€” not doing homework, but sign
ing up for them.
When the Building 40 which
houses the creative writing pro
gram opened at 8 a.m. Wednesday,
150 to 200 students were already
in line to sign up for the ever
popular fiction writing classes,
said Prof. John L'Heureux who
directs the program in creative
writing.
Sleeping bags extended from
Building 40 past Memorial
Church, and some of the students
had arrived as early as 11 p.m.
Tuesday to sign up for the fiction
writing class of their choice the
next morning.
"I've never slept out in the
Quad before. It was an experi
ence," according to Janine Jones,
a sophomore who took her sleep
ing bag to the Quad at 11:30 p.m.
to wait in line.
She said that "it was very mel
low" and that students trickled
into line throughout the night.
"There are simply not enough
undergraduate teachers to satisfy
the demand for fiction writing,"

L'Heureux said, adding that only
those students who showed up in
line before 5 a.m. were guaranteed
the class of their choice.
For years, dozens of students
have camped out all night to sign
up for fiction writing classes. Un
fortunately for the students and
the department, they don't have
the staff to create enough sections
to accommodate all of the students
who would like to take the popular
class.
According to L'Heureux, the
popularity of the class grew be
cause of the quality of teaching
that was offered by young stand
out lecturers such as Ron Hansen,
Stephanie Vaughn and Michelle
Carter about five years ago.
"Everybody got the notion that
it was hard to get in and that
created the reality," L'Heureux
said.
Also, this year was the first time
that five different sections of the
introductory fiction writing class
were offered, thanks to the addi
tion of another lecturer.
Yet still some students were
turned away. "Perhaps in the fu
ture years, the deans will be per
suaded that we need another lec
turer of fiction writing,"
L'Heureux said.
