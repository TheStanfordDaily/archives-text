# Chinatown
## 
### 
A Hong Kong native once
remarked that San Francisco's
Chinatown reminded him of home
— the rush-hour traffic jams
rivaled any bicycle or automobile
tie-up a Chinese city could
muster.
But Grant Avenue, the main
thoroughfare of Chinatown, also
offers a kaleidoscope of Asian
delights: dim sum bars, restau
rants, pharmacies displaying
pickled snake, people inspecting
the Chinese cabbage in front of
grocery stores while pressed duck
hangs in the windows.
The streets radiating out from
Grant Avenue house one of the
fastest growing Chinese popula
tions outside of China and afford
plenty of opportunities for explor
ing.
Chinatown can be both a stop
on a day trip elsewhere in the
City or an all-day affair unto itself.
Whatever your choice, it's hard to
go wrong.
