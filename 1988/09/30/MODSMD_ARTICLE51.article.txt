# Diversions
## Time-tested things to do — morning, noon and night 
### Karin McDonald Evan Tuchinsky 
At first glance, Palo Alto seems to be far from the most
exciting city in the world. An affluent suburb inhabited
mostly by middle-aged professionals and their families,
the community is relatively quiet and subdued.
For the college student eager for some action, this is
not good news. For all that Stanford possesses in intellectual and
cultural resources, the campus is somewhat lacking in entertainment
opportunities, leaving students grasping at the surrounding area for
excitement between the few scheduled concerts and events on the
Farm.
Fortunately, beneath Palo Alto's facade of quietude lies some
bristling activity. The hot spots are sometimes hard to find, and
much of the enjoyment derived from them stems from appreciating
the simple pleasures often ignored in a cosmopolitan environment.
However, with a little effort, Stanford is definitely a fun place to be.
Palo Alto by day. . .
Motorized vehicles not advised
Just behind campus are the grassy foothills. This is a great area
in which to wander and browse. A favorite tour is the satellite-dish
loop: this winding pathway leads around a few hills, by some cows
and under an oak tree or two to circle back toward campus.
Don't be intimidated by the Herculean types charging by you;
walking the Dish is a great way to relax and get outside even if
you are not the consummate fitness buff. Wear sturdy shoes and
bring something to read or eat — you may spend a few hours there,
cows permitting.
From hikes to bikes
If you are feeling more energetic, hop on your trusty three-speed
steed and bike up to the Alpine Inn (formerly Rosatti's, a.k.a Zott's)
for some greasy food and sunshine. This dusty beer garden, resplen
dent with ancient engraved tables and its own entourage of friendly
mongrel dogs, plays casual host to many long lunches, so don't feel
out of place among the executives. One word of caution: don't
overload on the beer if your trusty steed's brakes are on the fritz.
You did ride up here.

The California/Comix combination
For a journey that is much closer
to civilization, sojourn to South Palo
Alto's very own California Avenue.
Less hectic than its overcrowded
cousin University Ave., this tranquil
thoroughfare is the place for the lack
adaisical shopper who has tired of all
the glitz of the Stanford Slipping Cen
ter.
Extending only about five blocks,
California Ave. is lined on both sides
with unusual and interesting shops.
Of these, Comics and Comix reigns
as king of the curious, housing many
outlandish magazines along with the
standard Marvel wonders. Definitely
worth an extended browse.
More fantastic voyages
If fantasy books are still on your
mind, walk a few blocks up El Camino
to Future Fantasy, the peninsula's
premier purveyor of science fiction.
The selection is quite good, and if
what you want is not in stock, they
will gladly order it for you.
The congeniality of the clerks is
what really makes the store special.
The women behind the counter really
know and love their sci-fi and are
always ready to help out. In this day
and age of rude teenagers manning
the cash register with venom and ven
geance, compassion for the customer
is a warm change of pace.
Berries and bargains
When the weekend mornings ar
rive, plan for some marketeering.
Every Saturday, there is a Farmer's
Market held behind the post office
on Hamilton Avenue, and you can
pick up some tasty fresh fruit for
breakfast. Then, venture out into Palo
Alto and see the streets the fun way:
go garage sale shopping.
Palo Altans love garage sales. Look
through the classified section of the
Palo Alto Weekly, locate three or four
and take your bicycle out for another
fun ride. Even if you aren't interested
in buying anything, seeing what
people actually paid money for is en
tertaining enough
Artsy crafts
For more interesting and unique
shopping and an enjoyable afternoon,
head over to the Allied Arts Guild in
Menlo Park, west of El Camino. The
Allied Arts craft shops carry mostly
hand-made goods such as candles,
glass-blown miniatures and the like.
A beautiful and recently resculptured
garden winds around the low
Spanish-style buildings that house
the goods.

Soup is good food
The lunches and teas served at the
Guild's restaurant are unique and de
licious. The Guild's cooks make ar
guably the best soups around, mostly
of the cold vegetable variety, perfect
for a summer afternoon, and they
sell the day's recipes in the card shop
in front (for jealous mothers). Make
sure you make a luncheon reservation
if you plan to go.
. . . and by night
On your marks
You're all tired and tensed up from
the daytime action. You need to relax
with a frosty cold one, and the Tied
House in Mountain View is just the
place to go. Set in a renovated ware
house, the Tied House brew pub has
atmosphere to burn and three types
of home-brew to boot. I suggest a few
pints of the Amber, and don't forget
the beer cheese.

There are literally doz
ens of great places dot
ting downtown Palo Alto
from burger and pizza
joints to elegant Italian
eateries and sushi bars.

Food for thought
After a reasonable stay at the Tied
House, you realize that man cannot
live on beer cheese alone. You require
some food with serious flavor and
substance, and the restaurants of
Palo Alto are happy to comply.
There are dozens of great places
dotting downtown Palo Alto, ranging
from the basic burger and pizza joints
to elegant Italian eateries and
sumptuous sushi bars. Step inside
the first place that catches your eye;
chances are it will be pretty darn
good.
Catch an after-dinner flick
With the hunger pangs tamed, it
is time for a little entertainment. The
Varsity and Aquarius Theaters await.
The Varsity is located on Univer
sity Ave. across from Rainbow
Records. Formerly a nightclub and
movie theater in one, the new owners
decided to keep the screens but get
rid of the teens, leaving a scenic
theater with a lot of dead (albeit
scenic) space out front.
The Aquarius has always been a
movie house, showing unusual art
films on both of its screens. Located

on Emerson just down the street from
the Good Earth, the place is small
but cozy.
Looks at books
If your timing is rusty and you
have a few minutes to kill on the
clock before showtime, stroll into
Stacey's bookstore. This literary oasis
is rarely crowded, open late and
thankfully doesn't play to the preten
sions of an espresso machine. Start
in the humor section, and the time
will go by quickly.
And the clock ticks down
Coming down the post-movie
stretch, you'll find yourself with a
dearth of options. It seems that in
their infinite wisdom, the evil busi
ness coalition of Palo Alto decided to
cut down on overtime by shutting
the city down by 11 p.m.
One place that is open late (besides
that light-eating palace, Denny's) is
the University Creamery. They serve
up a mean chocolate shake, and you
can catch up on the newest mod fash
ions of Palo Alto youths at no extra
cost.
Aren't the pyramids in Egypt?
Hut if a greasy spoon is not your
cup of tea, Lyon's awaits. Located
about three miles south on El
Camino, this constantly-open, classy
coffee shop offers good food in a pleas
ant environment.
The pyramid breakfast alone is well
worth the drive. Served from mid
night to 11 a.m. weekdays (perfect
for after the Sunday night late screen
ing), the "Pyramid" allows you to
choose as many breakfast items as
you like for 80 cents each, three items
minimum.
This is an extremely flexible build
your-own breakfast, allowing you to
frugally splurge on an extra helping
of french toast or eggs or hash browns
or. . . the possibilities are as endless
as your appetite is large.
No rest for the weary
The remaining alternative for sat
isfying late-night hunger pangs is the
stellar supermarket Safeway. With a
store on Sand Hill Road in Sharon
Park plus a monstrous market on El
Camino in Menlo Park, about five
minutes from Wilbur and less than
two from Sterling Quad, food is al
ways near.
Off the Farm
The Berkeley Muzz
If escape from the confines of the
campus is desired, the prime place
to broaden your horizons is Berkeley,
a mere orange-line's ride away on
BART. Hop on University Avenue,
cross the Dumbarton Bridge and con
tinue straight until you see the signs
heralding the Union City station, and
your journey into Bear territory will
begin.
While there, there are three things
you have to experience: food, culture
and food. For food, the only way to
do Berkeley is to reserve a spot at
that pinnacle of California cuisine,
Chez Panisse.
If you don't do cities, however,
you'll probably be inclined toward
something less chic, something with
less savoir faire — something that
requires a bib. Flint's Barbeque is
the aeigning palace of messy food and
will provide you with a mighty meal.
Come on, dieters, aren't you tired of
eating rabbit food?
Music and madness
Located on both sides of Telegraph
Ave., the newly-expanded Rasputin's
is still the record shopping mecca of
the Bay Area. Though the prices
aren't all that great, the selection is
immense.
Best of all, the store is one of the
only places around here selling used
CDs. Boasting an assortment num
bering in the hundreds, Rasputin's
caters to the masses seeking digital
discounts. Clearly, this is the place
to browse.
Beauty is truth, truth beauty
On the cultural side of town, the
Berkeley Museum of Modern Art of
fers aesthetic enlightenment. The
building itself is an architectural
work of modern art; it's just a neat
place, period.
If you are interested in a good
movie, the Pacific Film Archive con
sistently screens unusual, eclectic and
interesting films. From foreign to art
films, this place runs the gamut. Call
beforehand so that you don't get
yourself into something you might
regret — not everyone flips over an
Argentinian film festival.
From city to City
San Francisco has its share of cul
tural nooks as well, mostly located
in or around Golden Gate Park. The
De Young Museum, the Japanese
Garden and the Aquarium are inter
esting places to sightsee new and
living art. But whatever you do, don't
miss the Exploratorium.
If a museum is neat, then this place
is neat-o. You're never too old to go
to the Exploratorium, the original in

tellectual toy factory. New exhibits
come in periodically, so return with
out regrets.
There's no place like home
But if you're the average Stanford
student, you don't always have the
dinero to spend on an extravagant
evening outing. When the urge to
migrate hits but your funds are down
for the count, unload your books,
refill your backpack with some chips

and Buds, and head up to Cow Hill.
Find the two cement water tanks
(up the path accross Junipero Serra
from Frenchman's Road, to your left)
and settle down for the free
panoramic display. If the night is
clear, you can see virtually the whole
peninsula and then some from this
cold hut cozy seat. It's an unbeatable
deal, but don't spoil it by leaving Mr.
Hud or Mr. Frito lying around.
Woodsy the Owl thanks you.

A day in the foothills could be just the ticket for a good time on a tight
budget. It's free and you might even meet a cow.
