## Time-tested things to do — morning, noon and night 
### Karin McDonald Evan Tuchinsky 
At first glance, Palo Alto seems to be far from the most
exciting city in the world. An affluent suburb inhabited
mostly by middle-aged professionals and their families,
the community is relatively quiet and subdued.
For the college student eager for some action, this is
not good news. For all that Stanford possesses in intellectual and
cultural resources, the campus is somewhat lacking in entertainment
opportunities, leaving students grasping at the surrounding area for
excitement between the few scheduled concerts and events on the
Farm.
Fortunately, beneath Palo Alto's facade of quietude lies some
bristling activity. The hot spots are sometimes hard to find, and
much of the enjoyment derived from them stems from appreciating
the simple pleasures often ignored in a cosmopolitan environment.
However, with a little effort, Stanford is definitely a fun place to be.
Palo Alto by day. . .
Motorized vehicles not advised
Just behind campus are the grassy foothills. This is a great area
in which to wander and browse. A favorite tour is the satellite-dish
loop: this winding pathway leads around a few hills, by some cows
and under an oak tree or two to circle back toward campus.
Don't be intimidated by the Herculean types charging by you;
walking the Dish is a great way to relax and get outside even if
you are not the consummate fitness buff. Wear sturdy shoes and
bring something to read or eat — you may spend a few hours there,
cows permitting.
From hikes to bikes
If you are feeling more energetic, hop on your trusty three-speed
steed and bike up to the Alpine Inn (formerly Rosatti's, a.k.a Zott's)
for some greasy food and sunshine. This dusty beer garden, resplen
dent with ancient engraved tables and its own entourage of friendly
mongrel dogs, plays casual host to many long lunches, so don't feel
out of place among the executives. One word of caution: don't
overload on the beer if your trusty steed's brakes are on the fritz.
You did ride up here.
