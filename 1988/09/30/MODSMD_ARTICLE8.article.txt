# Prop 100 targets safe drivers
## 
### Nathanael Cousins 
Editor's note: This is the first in
a series of articles clarifying some
of the prominent general election
proposals on the Nov. 8 California
ballot.

California Proposition 100, the
"Good Driver Initiative," is one
of five initiatives on the Novem
ber ballot seeking auto insurance
reform. It is backed by the Cali
fornia Trial Lawyer's Association,
California Attorney General John
Van de Kamp and Mothers
Against Drunk Driving.
Opposing the association and
Prop. 100 are the insurance com
panies, pushing their own legis
lation, Prop. 104, the No-Fault
Initiative. Other insurance
related measures for the Nov. 8
election include 101, the Polanco
Insurance Reform Initiative; 103,
the Voter Revolt Initiative; and
106, which would limit attorney
fees.
The most commonly debated
provisions of the measure are the
elimination of geographical and
gender classifications in the crea
tion of auto rates, the addition of
banks to the insurance industry
and the $10 million in additional
state funding that comes with the
initiative.
With the passage of the initia
tive, insurance companies would

rMCAICN
?_ !§§

no longer be able to set rates
based on a person's residency or
gender. For example, residents in
large cities, primarily in southern
California, and men currently pay
higher insurance rates. If Prop.
100 passes, this process would be
outlawed.
Primary goals of Prop. 100 in
clude requiring insurance com
panies to reduce rates for good
driving and requiring the Califor
nia Department of Insurance to
review auto insurance rates. The
proposition would also allow for
attorney fees to be negotiated be
tween the attorney and client —
rather than by the state.
If the bill were to pass, an office
of the Insurance Consumer Ad
vocate in the State Department
of Justice would be established as
well as a Senior Bureau of Inves
tigation to assist elderly persons
with insurance.
According to supporters, provi
sions in the measure will elimi
nate price-fixing by applying
anti-trust laws to the insurance
industry. Competiton Investiga
tion and prosecution of insurance
fraud would be beefed up if the
bill were to pass. There would

also be lower, standardized insur
ance rates for good driving.
Supporters further say that in
surance rates will fall 20 percent
if the proposition passes.
State Assemblyman Byron
Cher, a professor of consumer law
at the Law School, has officially
voiced his approval for Prop. 100,
in addition to 103. Cher sits on
the Governmental Efficiency and
Consumer Protection Committee
and the Finance and Insurance
Committee in Sacramento.
However, opponents say the
measure has illusory rate reduc
tions, does not cut attorney fees,
hurts suburban and urban areas,
creates more bureaucracy, in
creases risks for the banking in
dustry and eliminates geo
graphical ratings for auto insur
ance.
Peter van Aartrijk, press rep
resentative for the Citizens for
No-Fault, sponsored by California
Insurers, said the proposition will
not mean a decrease in insurance
rates but an increase in bureau
cracy.
"This increases the amount of
money to fund a huge bureaucra
cy, but 'does nothing to cut the
price of insurance," van Aartryk
said. "All the initiative does is
shift the cost of auto insurance
to rural areas at a high cost to
the taxpayers."
