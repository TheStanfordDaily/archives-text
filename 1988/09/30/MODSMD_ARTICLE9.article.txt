# Less popular dorms given new life, revamped social structure

"Mirrielees lets U.8.U."
proclaims a flier plastered on
every door at Mirrielees Hall. Il
lustrated with a honey bee flanked
by two female sheep, the motto
is emblematic of the new spirit
sweeping Mirrielees and its neigh
bor, Manzanita Trailer Park.
The two residence halls, once
known as quiet enclaves of serious
graduate students, are fast shed
ding their stay-at-home image.
The reasons: a new system of stu
dent activity "coordinators" at
Mirrielees, and a drop in the
number of graduate students at
Manzanita. Many graduates are
now housed at the new Liliore
Green Rains Apartments.
Mirrielees Makeover
"We're so psyched to be here,"
said junior Dominique Fredregille
as she and a friend moved boxes
into her new room in Mirrielees.
Fredregille likes the living room,
bedroom, complete kitchen and
private bath she and roommate
Kendra Wisler share. "We might
even live here next year,"
Fredregille said.
Mirrielees, which last year
housed about 70 graduate stu
dents and 210 undergraduates, is
now home to 50 graduates and

230 undergraduates. In addition,
last year's four resident assistants
have been replaced by 12 "Mir
rielees coordinators," one for
every wing.
Mirrielees' Resident Fellow
Keith Archuleta, says the switch
to 12 MCs will provide much
closer contact with residents than
the old system, which matched
one RA with 70 students.
Senior Tom Barker, a second
year Mirrielees resident, says
there has been a surge in activity
and community spirit this year.
He sees many more open doors
in the cluttered hallways and al
ready knows more people now
than he knew at the end of last
year. "If this place starts to have
a real social life, it's going to be
the place to live" at Stanford,
Barker said.
And the changes go beyond
mere social life. Archuleta, who is
also an assistant dean of student
affairs, said he plans to develop
house government, nurture multi
cultural programming and en
courage academic excellence this
year. "We look forward to what
promises to be a special year,"
Archuleta said.
Manzanita Madness
Across Campus Drive from Mir
rielees, the Manzanita Trailer

Park is seeing a similar trans
formation. Half of the residents
of the rambling collection of 116
three-bedroom trailers are under
graduates, and about 40 percent
of those are sophomores. By con
trast, last year only about 20 per
cent of residents were under
graduates.
Graduate students at Manzan
ita live three to a trailer, while
undergraduates double up the
"master bedroom" so that four
can fit in a trailer. This has
boosted the park's total popula
tion by about 50 students, which
helps alleviate the undergraduate
housing crunch caused by the
closure of Roble Hall last year
due to seismic hazard.
The increase in undergraduates
has made a difference in the life
style of the trailer park, said new
Manzanita Coordinator Scott
Ward. This year's residents are
already showing interest in intra
mural sports and social activities.
A get-acquainted happy hour last
Friday drew 200 Manzanita
dwellers, who finished off the
refreshments in short order. Ward
called this "a total change from
last year," when residents
grumbled that the addition of a
pool table to the park's adminis
tration building would reduce
"quiet space."
