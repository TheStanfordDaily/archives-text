Try a Macintosh todayr you may win a Sony Discman.
Now that a new school
year is under way, we have
an idea that'll make both
you and yotir parents feel a
bit more confident come
finals time:
Get a Macintosh*
computer to help with your
homework.
Then you'll never have
to spend another all-nighter
retyping a paper just to
purge a few typos and
dangling modifiers. You'll
be able to crank out assign- •
ments that look as though
you bribed a friend in art :•
school. And with an amaz
ing new program called
HyperCard—which just
happens to come packaged
with every Macintosh—you
can easily store, organize, • ■
and cross-reference research
notes to your heart's content.
And if that isn't enough
reason to look at a Macintosh
today, here's another:
Right now, you have
three chances to win one
of Sony's Discman " CD
players—including the ex
citing Sony Pocket Discman,
which also plays the new
3-inch CDs. And even if you
miss out on the CD player,
you may still win one of 15
Apple T-shirts. No strings
attached—just fill out a
registration form at the
location listed below.
So come in and get
your hands on a Macintosh.
If not for yourself, do it
fervour folks.
*
The power to be your best."
