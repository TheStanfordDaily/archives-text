Intro, to The Short Stor\
When Carla told me that mv date
was a little short, I thought she was
talking dollars and cents, not feet and
inches. So there I was at the door, in
my spiked heels, staring at the top of
my date s head.
All I could think was, how do I
get myself out of this? I could imagine
now my legs would ache if I had to walk
around with my knees bent all evening
So to stall for time, while figuring
out how to fake malaria, I made us
some Double Dutch Chocolate.
When 1 brought it into the living
X room, 1 discovered that Ciarv was
a chocolate lover too. Ahh, a man
after my own heart. Oka\; I de
cided Id give him a chance. So we
sat down and saw each other face
to-face for the first time. I le had a
nice smile.
After some small talk—l mean
conversation—l discovered that we
both love Updike, hate the winter
weather, and both have minia
ture schnauzcrs. So, we made
a date to introduce Shadow
and Schatzi next week.
