The dance band Crazy B's played to
an enthusiastic crowd Friday night in
the Tresidder Union Back Patio as part
of an all-campus "Celebration."
The party had a multicultural focus,
featuring popular reggae band Zulu
Spear, Latino band Dr. Loco and his
Original Corrido Boogie Band, jazz
musician Jon Jang and comedians
Marga Gomez and Larry Omaha.
"Celebration" was aimed at introduc
ing students to Tresidder Union, accord
ing to William King, program director
of Tresidder Programs. "Tresidder will
be the place where the Stanford com
munity can come together," he said.
Tresidder Programs organized the
event along with the Stanford Concert
Network. It was funded by the New
Student Orientation Committee and the
ASSU.
The organizers and sponsors wanted
to bring together entertainers for "a
beginning-of-the-year event which would
highlight various ethnic entertainers,"
according to King. The party was
planned to coincide with Orientation,
and offered non-alcoholic beverages and
ethnic food samples.
Friday's "Celebration" differed
markedly from last year's Orientation

Week all-campus party, which featured
rock band the Tubes and the Stanford
Band. The Tubes concert disappointed
most of the 1,000 to 2,000 people who
attended. Sophomore Maria Breaux
noted Friday, "The Tubes were too loud
and didn't play music that counted to
intelligent Stanford students."
According to David Brown, member
of the ASSU Council of Presidents, Fri
day's party was "more of a cultural thing
... more open to everybody."
King explained that while the talent
featured at last year's event "wasn't as
good as people expected," the acts fea
tured at "Celebration" were "more tried
and true." Zulu Spear, for example, was
"phenomenal" at its performance for this
year's International Banquet during Ori
entation, and Crazy B's have released a
new double LP, according to King.
Senior Steve Cramer, director of the
Stanford Concert Network, was "really
excited" about the party's success. He
estimated that between 4,000 and 5,000
people came through Tresidder during
the event, which lasted from 8 p.m. to
1:30 a.m., and he was "surprised at how
early the place was packed."
The audience seemed to share the op
inion of Junior Kristen Ding, who said,
"They should have all-campus parties
more often."
