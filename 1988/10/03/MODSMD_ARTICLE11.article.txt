With the Oct. 10 voter registration
deadline only u week away, student
groups are giving the final push to reg
ister students and minority groups, who
traditionally have less representation at
the polls.
In a concerted effort, the ASSU and
members of the Volunteer Network, a
branch of the Public Service Center, set
out to register voters in East Palo Alto
and Redwood City yesterday.
In a two-hour period, six students hit
supermarkets to register approximately
30 people, primarily black, Chicano
/Latino and other minority residents.
On Oct. 8 and 9, another push to reg
ister local residents will occur.
"Since by the year 2000 people of
color will be the majority in the state
of California, it's only common sense
that we need to get these people actively
involved in our government," explained
Council of Presidents member David
Brown.
"The goal of this drive is to help
alleviate that problem by assisting the
terrific ethnic registration programs
that are already in place in any way
that we can," Brown said.
Throughout the week, registration
volunteers will focus their efforts on
students and University workers as well.
Funded by the Public Service Center,
the drive will be a non-partisan, giving
equal representation to the various po
litical parties, Brown said.

On Wednesday at noon, the ASSU
and the Volunteer Network will sponsor
a voter registration "festival" at Tres
idder Union. Music will accompany the
drive with a performance by O'Mighty
Isis, Brown said.
Speakers will address the importance
of registering to vote, and representa
tives from student political organiza
tions will field questions.
On Thursday, the ASSU is holding a
voter-registration workshop; location to

be determined. Open to all community
members, the program will focus on
what Brown called the importance of
"community empowerment." Speakers
will discuss issues such as civil rights,
and how movements of this nature can
be implemented and improved through
voting.
By having person-to-person meetings
with University workers, student vol
unteers are trying to involve Stanford
employees in the election process.
Through a specific list of which workers
are not registered, volunteers will be
assigned to meet with certain workers,

Brown said.
Voter registration actually got under
way as early as Freshman Orientation
week when volunteers staffed informa
tional booths. As a result of the effort,
about 40 freshmen are currently work
ing as registration volunteers, Brown
said.
The idea of sponsoring a full-campus
voter drive came up over the summer
when the COP and Chair of the Stan
ford Democrats Subodh Chandra coor-

dinated their efforts and began
organizing the drive. COP members
have established voter registration as
part of their political agenda.
The Public Service Center's interest
in voter registration started up last De
cember when the Center, in conjunction
with the Black Student Union, sent 20
students to Alabama and Georgia to in
crease voter registration in counties
with large populations of unregistered
black residents, according to Cyndy Yu,
a representative who is leading the Vol
unteer Network's involvement in the
drive.
