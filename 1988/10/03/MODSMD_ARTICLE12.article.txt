## Estonian group accuses Kremlin 
### 
TALLINN, U.S.S.R. (AP) -
Members of an Estonian
nationalist group accused the
Kremlin yesterday of sapping
their republic's resources and
demanded that Moscow give them
greater control over their land and
economy.
Thousands of supporters
cheered the speakers at the first
congress of the fledgling People's
Front.
"We have been reduced to the
level of slaves in a manor," farmer
Enno Peets told more than 3,000
delegates.
Some speakers objected to what
they called the Kremlin's
"colonialist" policy, which they
said siphons off Estonia's agricul
tural output and manufactured
goods.
"These people are to blame for
our suffering here, the lack of
food here," delegate Albert
Danielson told the audience at the
Town Hall in Tallinn, the pictur
esque capital of this republic on
the Baltic Sea.
The two-day conference opened
Saturday with an address by Es
tonia's Communist Party chief,
Vyalyas, who greeted the
group in the name of Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev.
Official sanction for the meet
ing was an indication of the
changing attitudes of authorities,
who recently would have thrown

in jail anyone espousing
nationalist sentiments.
The issue of ethnic relations is
an important one for Gorbachev,
who is beset by unrest among the
Soviet Union's more than 100 eth
nic groups. The stirrings have
been particularly troublesome in
the Baltic republics of Estonia,
Lithuania and Latvia, and in the
southern republics of Armenia
and Azerbaijan.
The Soviet Union took over the
Baltic republics under a 1939
agreement with Nazi Germany.
At a news conference after the
congress concluded, Vyalyas said
his republic's reforms "are always
favorably accepted" by Gorbachev.
But he said without elaborating
that some proposals go too far.
"Our wills and wishes have cer
tain limits when fantasy goes too
far from reality we must stop
these things," he told reporters.
Among the nearly two dozen
resolutions passed yesterday was
one demanding that the 1939
agreement be renounced.
Another resolution urged the
Estonian government and the
Communist Party to stop the flow
of people of other nationalities
into the republic, where ethnic
Estonians make up just 60 percent
of the population.
