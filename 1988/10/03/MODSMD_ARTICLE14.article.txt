# Shuttle crew gives tribute to Challenger

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Discovery's
astronauts delivered a poignant salute yesterday to
their fallen Challenger comrades, eulogizing them
as fellow sojourners and friends, and saying "At
this moment, our place in the heavens makes us
feel closer to them than ever before."
Said astronaut John Lounge: "It's good to be
back to where they wanted to go so badly."
As they beamed down spectacular views of the
mottled blue and white Earth miles below, the
Discovery astronauts spoke about the Challenger
— America's last manned space venture — which
exploded on liftoff 32 months ago tragically killing
school teacher Christa McAuliffe and six others.
"Those on the Challenger who had flown before
and seen these sights,, they would know the meaning
of our thoughts," said astronaut George Nelson.
"Those who had gone to view them for the first
time, they would know why we set forth."
Discovery is to return home from its four-day,
one-hour, 65-orbit flight today, landing at Edwards
Air Force Base in California at 12:37 p.m. EDT.
The shuttle will be greeted there by an expected
100,000 or more people, including Vice President
George Bush who will be waiting at the foot of the
ramp when the astronauts climb down. The weather
looked fine for landing and thousands were camped
there already yesterday.
The astronauts may be a bit warm on their 10,000-
mile glide home; a cooling system problem has
plagued most of the flight, and the system may still
not be working.
Gathered in the Discovery's middeck in front of
a photograph of the Challenger crew, the crew took
turns reading portions of the statement they had
written.
