## Watch water waste 
### 
A surprising amount
of water is saved when
we just turn off the tap

Stanford's water reservoir
has trickled down to almost noth
ing. Faced with a severe Northern
California drought, the Stanford
community must make some
serious cutbacks.
Water wastefulness cannot be
tolerated.
Now into its eighth month, the
drought has depleted the Hetch
Hechy reservoir, which usually fills
Stanford sprinklers and faucets, to
37 percent of its normal capacity.
In turn, Stanford has switched to
local well-water supplies to meet
the community's needs.
But wells aren't bottomless pits
and much of the responsibility of
cutting back on the use of water
rests with students.
The University has started to
implement water rationing meas
ures, installing low-flow shower
heads on fixtures and faucets in
residences.
But what good are water ration
ing fixtures if students continue to
take 20-minute showers or forget
to turn off the tap?
Residential Education has hung
up fliers in University residences,
warning that leaky faucets waste
as much as 15 gallons of water a
day and that students are often
careless about their water use.
For instance, the fliers point out
that students can save about two
gallons of water each time they
brush their teeth if they turned
off the tap between brushing and
rinsing.
While two gallons a day might
not seem like much of a difference,

consider that there are 365 days
in a year and more than 10,000
students here. Such a simple step
could save about 7,300,000 gallons
of water each year.
Officials at the Palo Alto Con
servation Center say Stanford and
its surrounding area are "nothing
more than green desert" with al
most all water running through
an irrigation system.
However, students from Kansas,
New Jersey and places other than
California might not understand
this region's topography or
weather patterns.
To these students, as well as to
the entire Stanford community,
Residential Education must con
tinue stressing water conservation.
A more watchful eye should also
be keeping tabs on Stanford's
sprinkler- system. Though the Uni
versity is to be praised for turning
on sprinklers during the cooler
nighttime hours, these sprinklers
often end up spraying more streets
and gutters than grassy areas.
Again, community members can
help stop the water waste. When
individuals spot a broken sprinkler
they should call Operations and
Maintenance at 723-2281, at any
hour, and report the problem.
In another effort to conserve
water, the University has turned
off the spray on a Stanford
trademark — its fountains. During
those hot September days students
could only sit and stare at the bar
ren fountains rather than dive into
them. But these small sacrifices
need to keep happening.
Although Stanford's fountains
recirculate the water they use, a
typical fountain spouts up at least
10 gallons of water each minute.
Even once the first raindrops
start to fall again, the University
should use the fountains sparingly
— or not at all — until wells and
reservoirs have been thoroughly
replenished.
