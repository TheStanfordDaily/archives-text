# Students billed last year for work not yet begun
## 
### Helen Willey Staff writer 
Although the University fined
students this summer close to
$40,000 to rekey at least 10
houses on the Row, the locks in
two of the houses have not yet
been changed.
The University claimed that if
it did not fine all of those who
lived in the 10 houses last year,
close to 500 students, the houses
would be a "security risk" because
house keys had not been returned
at the end of the year.
But the Italian House and
Storey House have not yet been
rekeyed and remain a security
risk to the current residents.
Row Office Manager Lucy Wil
liams contended that the locks will
likely be rekeyed within the next
week.
Williams blames both the lack
of locksmiths, as well as frequent
use of the Row residences for con
ferences for the University's delay
in finishing the job.
"If you only have two lock
smiths and lots of conferences I
can see why it's taken this long,"
said Williams, adding "I don't
know what happened this past
year where there were so many
people who were careless with
their keys."

Stuaents are angry at having
paid for a job not done. "It's like
paying a plumber before his work
is done," said Andy Efron, a re
turning resident and current
house manager at the Italian
House, who paid a bill totaling
$66.24. "Stanford obviously has
a system of mass billing whether
or not services are performed,"
said Efron.
Former residents in the Italian
House and Storey House are not
the only ones disappointed with
the University's handling of the
situation. The majority of stu
dents who were billed for the
rekeying over the summer are
feeling disgruntled about the Uni
versity's billing.
According to Williams, the eight
houses rekeyed this summer were
Hammarskjold, ATO, Columbae,
Kappa Sigma, Alpha Delta Phi,
Theta Delta Chi, Phi Delta Theta
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Because the Row Office was
closed over the weekend, the
amounts charged to residents of
each house were unavailable. But
The Daily learned that those who
lived in Hammarskjold last year
paid nearly $114 each to rekey
the house.
The Kappa Sigma fraternity
paid $3,600 to the University
from house funds and plans to

make up the funds bv charging
only those house members who
lost their keys.
"We have to assess how we're
going to charge the guys who
screwed up and lost their keys,"
said Kappa Sigma President Jay
Gilbert, a senior.
Some students complained
more about the University's fail
ure to explain the charge than
the charge itself. They contend
that when they called or wrote
the University asking about the
charge that was tacked onto their
tuition bills, they received vague
and mumbled answers or no Uni
versity response at all.
"I didn't want to pay until I
knew why, " said senior Melissa
Pashigian, who lived in Ham
marskjold last year. But Pas
higian said she had trouble
getting any response from Row
officials and refused to pay the
bill until she realized that the Uni
versity had suspended her regis
tration for fall quarter.
"It was quite an inconvenience
because no one I called returned
my phone calls and then I couldn't
get into my room when I got to
school," she said.
When Efron wrote the Univer
sity questioning the charge, the
