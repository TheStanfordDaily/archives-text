## Area 9: Public Service 
### 
Everybody can be great. Because anybody
can serve. You don't have to have a college
degree to serve. You don't have to make
your subject and your verb agree to serve.
You don't have to know about Plato and
Aristotle to serve. You don't have to know
Einstein's Theory of Relativity to
serve...You only need a heart full of grace.
A soul generated by love.
—Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
THE TWOFOLD PURPOSE and
promise of a Stanford education,
according to Mrs. Jane Lathrop
Stanford, is for "personal success and
direct usefulness in life," and"the hope
and trust that (you) will become thereby
of greater service to the public." Unfortu
nately, Stanford University falls short in
achieving this latter objective.
The administration subtly implies that
satisfying 180 units and eight distribu
tion requirements (with a pass/no clue
option) are all that is needed for a quality,
"liberal" education. How sad and unfor
tunate for Stanford University to exclude
community service from its "liberal" ed
ucation package. How ignorant and naive
for Stanford University to believe that
excellence in academics necessarily trans
lates into excellence in public service. The
time has come for Stanford to finally live
up to its promise; the time has come for
Stanford to institute a public service dis
tribution requirement.
If the argument can be made that
taking Interpersonal Relations (DR:4)
will help enhance your relations with
others, then so will tutoring disadvan
taged school children in East Palo Alto.
If taking Automotive Technology (DR:8)

will help make you a more productive
person in society, then so will working
on a hunger project. If taking Is
sues of American Public Policy (DR:S)
will help you become more aware of the
political processes, then so will helping
the unemployed find jobs.
What better way to become a more
productive, more caring, more aware
human being than to actually go out into
society and work with the needy, the
poor, the homeless, and the hungry?
Indeed, academic work and direct ex
perience provide the two critical founda
tions of an education — neither can func
tion properly without the other. One can
attend a lecture on courage, read about
courage, write a brilliant essay about
courage, and still remain a coward. That
person, in the classic Aristotelian sense,
will not truly understand courage until
he or she performs a courageous act.
1987 graduate Lome Needle put it best
in these words, "My academic work in
forms my community service — in a sense
the knowledge helps to ground the pas
sion."
But what about those who do not have
a passion for community service? Why
compel a student to perform public serv
ice in order to fulfill a DR? Many people
find the concept of forced public service
self-defeating.
Perhaps. But forced public service is
better than no public service. Think of
the awesome impact 6,000 undergradu
ates would have within Stanford, in East
Palo Alto, inside the nation and around
the world.
Rutgers University is currently consid
ering a plan to mandate community serv

ice work in their curriculum. Rutgers
President Edward J. Bloustein remarked,
"You can't require people to be good, but
you can require that they do good things."
If Rutgers has the courage and com
mitment to take such a bold step, why
not Stanford? The Stanford administra
tion and faculty have already shown their
flexibility and vision in changing the Area
One requirement. Now it is time to shed
the myopic view that higher education
exists only in the classroom.
As President Donald Kennedy said, "I
think all of us feel more fulfilled if some
fraction of our activity is going into
making the world a better place...lf a life
is empty of that kind of fulfillment it
seems to me it is emptier than it needs
to be." Without proper policy and actions
behind these words, they will just be
hollow reminders of what Stanford might
have been.
Because Stanford is obligated to pro
vide a quality education in its broadest
sense; because classwork and lectures do
not always translate into action; because
Stanford's initiatives are often emulated
by other institutions; then it is not only
prudent, timely and wise for Stanford to
create DR:Public Service — it is a moral
imperative.
