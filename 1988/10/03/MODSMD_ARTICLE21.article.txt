## Legal principles limit agenda for dorm discussions 
### 
WITH THE START OF school
last week, many students
learned that the University
is engaged in contract negotiations
with Local 680 of the Service Employ
ees International Union, which repre
sents technical, maintenance and serv
ice workers on campus. I have since
received a wave of requests — almost
all from RA's in different dorms — to
meet with students and provide back
ground.
I am happy to do so. There are,
however, some unavoidable limits on
available time — the University's first
priority must be the negotiations them
selves — and on what a negotiator for
either party can properly do while

negotiations continue.
I have therefore asked the Office of
Residential Education to organize for
me a manageable number of dorm
appearances designed to accommodate
the greatest number of students across
campus. With that in mind, all pending
requests for meetings have been for
warded to the attention of Residential
Education.
As for the meetings themselves, I
would ask students to understand that
the established legal principles of labor
negotiations — known more formally
as "good faith" collective bargaining —
will necessarily limit both our agenda
and our format. These principles are
common to collective bargaining every-

where, not just at Stanford.
One of them (imposed by federal
law) is that negotiations exclusively
take place at the bargaining table
directly between authorized representa
tives of both parties. This is based on
time-honored experience that the can
dor of the bargaining table is most
conducive to reaching agreement. In
contrast, public debates between those
same representatives are known to
have the opposite effect of polarizing
and entrenching positions.
This doesn't mean that each party
shouldn't independently discuss the
negotiations with others who express
interest.

It does explain, however, why Stan
ford's and Local 680's negotiators
would be compromising their "good
faith" bargaining obligations to each
other by engaging in a joint public
exchange on issues under negotiation.
For the same reason, there will — and
ought to be — limits on what we
properly can say about specific contract
proposals even in our separate appear
ances.
Student interest is welcome. I look
forward to appropriate opportunities to
discuss the negotiations, and I trust
that the union's negotiators will oper
ate in the same spirit.
