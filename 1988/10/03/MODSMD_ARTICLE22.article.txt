# Ethnocentricity clouds the coverage of Seoul Olympics
## 
### 
On Sept. 29, The Daily printed an
article entitled Highlights and
Lowlights of Seoul Olympics. It is
ironically unfortunate that my yellow
marker thereon made highlights of its
own. The article, written in an attempt
to criticize the organization of the
Olympics by South Korea, sadly reveals
a msyor problem in mind set: eth
nocentricity A big word, yet perhaps
still too small for many American
heads.
I cannot pretend to be as knowledge
able as the article's inventor about the
Olympic Family Village, its communica
tion system, or its cafeteria. Nor am I
as enlightened about the execution (or
alleged lack thereof) of security at ath
letic events. Furthermore, the use of
sarcasm or of expressions such as
"there's no doubt that" and "obvious

ly" would only detract from my cri
tique. Nor, it seems to me, does it
behoove responsible journalism. But I
do feel strongly that although it takes
a big shot to be privy to inside infor
mation, it takes a big person to try to
understand and accept.
My marker highlighted such quips
as:
1. "(The athletes' village is) not ex
actly aesthetically pleasing." Housing is
expensive and difficult to come by even
at Stanford, and Seoul cannot con
struct a Rains whenever it needs one.
The complex was wisely designed to be
used as apartment buildings once the
Games are finished. The housing is
comfortable and complete with western
amenities for those unwilling to "do as
the Romans."
2."Americans just love the communi
cation system. Basically there isn't
one." Why only the Americans — are
they the only ones complaining? And
who may speak on behalf of all Ameri
cans?
3. "Korean chefs have not exactly
mastered spaghetti or hamburgers yet."

Is there some supposition that they
ever should? 1 find the expectation of
being served American food extremely
insolent.
4. "One minor problem: the officials
and volunteers do not speak English,
or any other language other than
Korean for that matter; nor do the
official volunteers.... They don't want
to admit it either." This one takes the
proverbial cake.
All Korean students begin the study
of English in middle school. Perhaps
none may speak or understand Eng
lish, which is arguably the world's
most difficult language to learn, as
well as an American. (And why should
they?) But nearly all Korean college
age students can quite effectively com
municate in English; all it takes is for
one to be thoughtful enough to speak
more slowly instead of more loudly,
and to remember not to use complex
idioms. Koreans are a proud, but
polite, people. Often they wish not to
offend Americans whose inconsiderate
speech needs a more careful repeating.
5. "Not only are Korean drivers

psycho...the taxi drivers do not know
where the Olympic complexes are."
Korean drivers are amazing — I wit
nessed only one small traffic mishap in
three months. And as for the locations
of the Olympic complexes, the drivers
know very well when told the Korean,
and not English, names of the places.
One kind taxi driver even drove me all
the way across town, not stopping
when I told him my money would run
out, and then he refused to charge me
anything at all. He thanked me for
coming.
I hope that I have misunderstood
the article in question, and that it is
not a self-aggrandizing belittlement of
South Korea's accomplishments. Per
haps its hyperbole was intended to be
comic, rather than offensive. But my
sympathies to those who may have
been offended and to the Koreans, who
have been victimized by some members
of the American jet set. The lowlight
of the Seoul Olympics may have been
the coverage of it.
