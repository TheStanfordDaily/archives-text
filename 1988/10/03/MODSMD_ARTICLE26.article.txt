## Medical school group works for Nicaraguan health care

Bernardino Diaz Ochoa hospital
needs more than lights; it needs
walls. The crumbling of the struc
ture has forced staff and patients
out of the building and into tents.
"It looks like a mobile MASH
unit," second-year medical stu
dent Reuben Granich said of the
tent camp. "They even have the
surgery set up out there (in
tents)," said Granich, a volunteer
who spent part of his summer in
Nicaragua.
Ten million people in Central
America, 40 percent of the popu
lation, lack access to health care
services. For this reason, the work
of the Palo Alto-Stanford Medical
Aid Committee for Central
America continues to grow.
The non-profit group, PASMAC,
was formed in 1984 by Stanford
Medical School students, who dis
covered during a trip to Nicaragua
that the resources and connec
tions of the Stanford medical com
munity could be put to good use
there.
PASMAC, which is housed in
the Old Firehouse, has focused its
work on the Bernardino Diaz Oc
hoa Hospital, located in Granada,
in southwestern Nicaragua. The
group supplies basic medicinal
and equipment needs including
antibiotics, respirators and surgi

cal tools. To date, over $300,000
worth of medical aid has been sup
plied in response to well-defined
needs.
By 1985, PASMAC was the only
supplier of penicillin at the Ber
nardino Diaz Ochoa hospital that
serves 110,000 people.
According to PASMAC members
who have visited the hospital, it
is severely underequipped, under
staffed and in need of mainte
nance.
"They still need tools and
aspirin there," reported Granich
who spent much of his time com-

'It looks like a
mobile MASH
unit.They even
have the surgery
set up outside.'

MAC's work. "It's simple stuff
that they need, like lights."
Although the medical students
on the first trip to Nicaragua were
impressed with the strides the
Nicaraguan government was

making in improving health care,
they saw gaps they were able to
help fill. They found the
Nicaraguan people committed to
providing comprehensive medical
service, and realized that their re
sources and effort could make an
enormous difference.
Until a new program estab
lished funds for two Stanford
medical students to work in the
clinic, PASMAC's chief function
was sending supplies donated by
individuals and groups. Until one
year ago, volunteers, who travel
at their own expense, carried
everything by hand. As quantities
increased, custom objections
forced the.group to ship most of
the supplies through official chan
nels, classified as humanitarian
goods.
The key to the success of the
project as stressed by each of the
PASMAC members is the target
ing of their efforts. "We are work
ing toward specific needs of
communities," said Mary Ahern
Navarro, a group member. Each
shipment of supplies is gathered
and prioritized from a "needs list"
that is compiled by the hospital.
This arrangement ensures that
the Nicaraguans get what they
need.

"The time frames are slow, but
[the supplies] get there," accord
ing to Don Mullen, a leading PAS
MAC member. The erouD
rigorously tracks the deliveries
they send and an itemized receipt
is secured for shipments that are
not carried by PASMAC volun
teers. The group also works with
other Nicaraguan-based organiza
tions who follow up on PASMAC
projects when volunteers are un
able to go to Nicaragua to super
vise.
Luis Rodriguez, a medical stu
dent and PASMAC member, said
that one of the tasks of the Stan
ford group that visited Nicaragua
during spring break last March
was to check inventories in the
hospitals against lists that the stu
dents brought with them from
PASMAC records.
Once the supplies reach the Nic
araguans, PASMAC members said
that inventory control is strict.
"In the hospitals, everything is
written down," according to
Granich.

PASMAC- depends on fundrais
ing and volunteer support for its
programs. The positive response
from their first mailing in the
spring of 1986 stimulated an ex
panded fundraising effort, includ
ing increased public events to
benefit their work. Navarro
pointed out that "the importance
of public events is that we raise
money and interest at the same
time."
The money that is raised is
stretched as far as possible. "I
was attracted to the group be
cause of the careful way they han
dle their money," said Mullen, the
first non-Stanford student mem
ber of the group. One way they
stretch dollars is to buy supplies
through charity supply houses.
The other is through their ener
getic solicitation of donations, ac
cording to Mullen.
Navarro said the group is very
thrifty and concerned about prop
erly allocating the funds to im
prove the most pressing needs for
medical services to the Nicara
guans. "If we can get it donated,
we will," she added.
The group also has what Mullen
and Navarro both attest is un
usually low overhead for an or

gamzation of its type. "We operate
at about 15 to 17 percent over
head, as compared to 25 percent
in most organizations," said Mul
len. PAS MAC has no paid staff,
and no office rent. Volunteers pro
vide the labor, and the University
houses the group.
Granich added that he also
traveled to Nicaragua in part to
assess the political climat§ and
the effects of U.S. involvement.
"I can say that the U.S. blockade
and the war with the Contras is
really having a severe effect on
the people. They are going
hungry. They are just holding on
in the health care sector."
PASMAC welcomes anyone to
contact them who is interested in
their activities.or who sees a need
that PASMAC could address. The
group provides a base of support
and encouragement for projects
conceived by its members, and vol
unteers are needed to assist in all
aspects of the organization.
PASMAC will be meeting every
other Wednesday throughout the
fall in the Old Firehouse. The first
meeting is Oct. 5 at 7:30. The
group also sponsors lectures
throughout the year.

PASMAC volunteers in Nicaragua sort crates of medicinal supplies, ranging from catheters to plastic
jars, shipped from Palo Alto. PASMAC has sent over $300,000 worth of medical equipment to a
hospital in southwestern Nicaragua since the local group began in 1984.
