## Fighting Irish demolish the Cardinal, 42-14 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - Under
imposing Indiana skies, the Car
dinal football team could do little
to brighten its day, falling to
Notre Dame 42-14.
The Cardinal had almost noth
ing go right against the fifth
ranked Fighting Irish and fell to
1-3 on the season. Notre Dame
improved to 4-0 with the victory.

Fighting Irish 42, Cardinal 14
"Well, Notre Dame's a fine foot
ball team," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said, "and (they) took it to
us defensively and took it to us
offensively."
Stanford's defense, which came
into the game ranked 18th in the
nation in points allowed, could not
continue its fine play agaist a very
fast Irish offense. Notre Dame
quarterback Tony Rice, whose
4.40 40-yard dash time makes him
faster than anyone on the Cardi
nal roster, ran for 108 yards on
14 carries.
Rice also threw for 129 yards
on 11-for-14 passing, including
completing his first five passes.
Notre Dame took it to Stanford
early, taking a 28-7 halftime lead,
then held the ball so long on its
drives in the second half that
Stanford had only two post
intermission possessions.
The brightest spot for the Car
dinal was the play of redshirt
freshman quarterback Jason
Palumbis, who relieved starter

Brian Johnson at halftime.
"I thought Jason Palumbis did
a good job throwing the football,"
Elway said. "He deserved a
chance. ... I wanted to see Jason
Palumbis in a game situation.
He's done well in practice. I
thought it was a good opportu
nity."
Palumbis completed 16 of 23
passes, for 158 yards on the two
drives. Johnson was 7-of-18 for
57 yards.
"It's always nice to play,"
Palumbis said. "I don't know if I
was pleased with my performance
but I was pleased with the chance
to play. ... I think if I wouldn't
have made any mistakes we could
have scored again. I think I
missed a couple reads, could have
thrown deeper. ..."
The drive Palumbis was refer
ring to began on the Stanford 14
before a Notre Dame personal foul
moved the ball to the 29. After
that, Palumbis moved the team
to the Irish 12, converting on
third-and-eight, and fourth-and
three en route.
A personal foul and a holding
penalty gave the Cardinal first
and-35 at the 37, but then
Palumbis hit tight end Jim Price
for 14, fullback Jon Volpe ran for
three and Palumbis hit slotback
Charlie Young for six.
Facing fourth-and-12, Palumbis
could only find Young in front of
the linebackers, and Young came
up four yards short.
On his first drive at quarter
back, Palumbis led Stanford 73
yards for a score. The Oregon na
tive completed three key third
down passes before being faced

with a fourth-and-six on ti;e
Notre Dame 27. Pressure for a
quarterback leading only his sec
ond collegiate drive? No, not at all.
Palumbis rolled right to buy
time, then spotted Henry Greer
streaking down the right sideline
Green was well covered, but
Palumbis hung the ball up, Green
came back to it and made the
catch in front of the cornerback
and behind the safety.
"I just tried to put it over the
safety's head," Palumbis said,
"and hoped Henry came back to
get it. I didn't really do anything."
The Cardinal won the coin toss
to open the game, but everything
went the way of the Irish after
that. While Stanford went three
plays-and-out its first two posses
sions, Notre Dame moved the ball
well, scoring a touchdown when
Rice kept the ball while running
the option and ran 30 yards for
a score. On its second drive Notre
Dame moved the ball down to the
Cardinal four before missing a'
field goal.
Reggie Ho's missed PAT and
missed field goal gave the Cardi
nal hope at only six points down,
and a shovel pass to Volpe for 11
yards was good for Stanford's in
itial first down. On the next play,
however, a Johnson pass was
picked off by outside linebacker
Flash Gordon (yes, that's his real
name!), giving the Irish the ball
on the Stanford 30.
The hosts moved the ball to set
up a second-and-goal on the one,
but defensive tackle Lester Ar
chambeau and strong safety Rob

Sophomore quarterback Jason Palumbis and the Cardinal had a rough day against the Fighting Irish
on Saturday. Palumbis replaced starter Brian Johnson In the second half.
Englehardt stopped Rice on a
quarterback sneak. The two
stuffed tailback Mark Green on
third down, as well, and Irish
Coach Lou Holtz elected to go for
it on fourth down.
Archambeau came through
again, stopping Rice on an option
play right. After the great defen
sive stand, and still trailing only
6-0, the Cardinal's fortunes took
a big upswing. For about 15
seconds.
On the first play, Johnson
fumbled the snap from center
Andy Sinclair and inside line
backer Ned Bolcar recovered the
fumble.
Faced with a second chance
from the one, Green dove over
the top to score on first down.
Notre Dame went for two, and
Rice ran the option left;, keeping
the ball and getting in easily to
make it 14-0.
"We were really psyched about
stopping them," Archambeau said
about the stand. "We were ready
to do it again." But Rice was too
much to handle.
"When we held them on the
goal line we got pumped up,"
Englehardt said. "When we
fumbled . . . that took a lot out
of us."
Stanford got another first down
its next possession, on a Notre
Dame face mask, then, again, went
three-and-out. After a 13-yard
punt — Stanford had four punts
on the day, averaging 24.5 yards
— the Irish got the ball on Stan
ford's 46.
Notre Dame then drove in for
another score on five plays to
make it 21-0.
Johnson's passing and Volpe's
running, including a two-yard run
on a key fourth-and-one play,
brought the Cardinal 68 yards to

make it 21-7, but the Fighting
Irish scored again before halftime
to up their lead to 21 at the break.
"I would have to say they're
the best team we've played so
far," Elway said. "Very quick,
very physical. They don't make a
lot of mistakes. We do but they
don't.
"We knew when we came in we
wouldn't have a large margin for
error ... I think ... we made the
mistakes and didn't stay on the
field on offense. Notre Dame is a
great defensive football team."
Holtz, on the other hand, felt
Stanford executed well, but did
not seem pleased with his own
team's play. "I thought they ex
ecuted very well," Holtz said.
"They made so many critical
third- and fourth-down plays. I
really congratulate them."
Despite the key-play conver
sions, however, most Cardinal
players were not pleased with the
team's performance. Arch am beau
described his feeling after the
game as, "pissed, very, very
pissed. We didn't rise to the oc
casion and that bothers me. We
should never lose like that. We
gotta get it in gear — 1-3 is not
insurmountable. We have a three
game homestand coming up, and
we need to win all three."
Stanford faces San Jose State
this weekend in a contest the Car
dinal should win. Arizona State
and Oregon State will visit the
Farm the following weekends.
Englehardt summed it up.
"They just came out and played
good football with us," he said.
"I think we played a lot worse
this weekend than we played
against USC."
Fortunately, now Stanford has
a break in its schedule from teams
like the fifth-ranked Irish and the
third-ranked Trojans. The break
couldn't have come at a better
time.
Card notes
The Cardinal finally received some

good news on the injury front. Ar
chambeau, who sprained his knee at
Oregon last week said he felt "good
enough, better than I felt last week,"
after the game Saturday.
Noseguard Ray Huckestein, suffer

ing from a sore back and a sprained
foot, missed the end of the first half
but was in for much of the second
half.
Stanford's scoring drives of 68 and
73 yards are the two longest drives
allowed by the Irish all year.
Stanford's ground attack, held to
36 yards last week, didn't fare much
better against the Irish, grinding out
only 59 net yards on the ground. Part
of the reason was the five-yard total
in the second half, but Palumbis was
throwing so well the Cardinal didn't

need to run the ball.
Not to be sacreligious or anything,
but the field in Notre Dame Stadium
is not one of the best-kept playing
surfaces around. A selection of player
comments from a walk-through Fri
day night: "This is the worst field
ever." "This is just the worst." "It
looks like a high school field." "You'd
think, since it's Notre Dame, the field
would be nicer than this." The field
was uneven, had a large collection of
divots and was missing some grass.

The lowlight of the trip must have
been the social scene at the Elkhart,
Ind., Holiday Inn. The "Holidome In
door Recreational Facilities" (swim
ming pool, video games, miniature golf
course, ping-pong and pool tables)
closed at 10 p.m., even on a Friday
night. Additionally, the hotel's bar
featured the song stylings of lounge
lizard Chuck Randolph and his pre
programmed synthetic beat machine,
anyone's worst nightmare, and the
bar called "last call" at midnight.
