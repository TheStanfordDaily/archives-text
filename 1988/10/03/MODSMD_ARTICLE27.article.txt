SOUTH BEND, Ind. - Under
imposing Indiana skies, the Car
dinal football team could do little
to brighten its day, falling to
Notre Dame 42-14.
The Cardinal had almost noth
ing go right against the fifth
ranked Fighting Irish and fell to
1-3 on the season. Notre Dame
improved to 4-0 with the victory.

Fighting Irish 42, Cardinal 14
"Well, Notre Dame's a fine foot
ball team," Stanford Coach Jack
Elway said, "and (they) took it to
us defensively and took it to us
offensively."
Stanford's defense, which came
into the game ranked 18th in the
nation in points allowed, could not
continue its fine play agaist a very
fast Irish offense. Notre Dame
quarterback Tony Rice, whose
4.40 40-yard dash time makes him
faster than anyone on the Cardi
nal roster, ran for 108 yards on
14 carries.
Rice also threw for 129 yards
on 11-for-14 passing, including
completing his first five passes.
Notre Dame took it to Stanford
early, taking a 28-7 halftime lead,
then held the ball so long on its
drives in the second half that
Stanford had only two post
intermission possessions.
The brightest spot for the Car
dinal was the play of redshirt
freshman quarterback Jason
Palumbis, who relieved starter

Brian Johnson at halftime.
"I thought Jason Palumbis did
a good job throwing the football,"
Elway said. "He deserved a
chance. ... I wanted to see Jason
Palumbis in a game situation.
He's done well in practice. I
thought it was a good opportu
nity."
Palumbis completed 16 of 23
passes, for 158 yards on the two
drives. Johnson was 7-of-18 for
57 yards.
"It's always nice to play,"
Palumbis said. "I don't know if I
was pleased with my performance
but I was pleased with the chance
to play. ... I think if I wouldn't
have made any mistakes we could
have scored again. I think I
missed a couple reads, could have
thrown deeper. ..."
The drive Palumbis was refer
ring to began on the Stanford 14
before a Notre Dame personal foul
moved the ball to the 29. After
that, Palumbis moved the team
to the Irish 12, converting on
third-and-eight, and fourth-and
three en route.
A personal foul and a holding
penalty gave the Cardinal first
and-35 at the 37, but then
Palumbis hit tight end Jim Price
for 14, fullback Jon Volpe ran for
three and Palumbis hit slotback
Charlie Young for six.
Facing fourth-and-12, Palumbis
could only find Young in front of
the linebackers, and Young came
up four yards short.
On his first drive at quarter
back, Palumbis led Stanford 73
yards for a score. The Oregon na
tive completed three key third
down passes before being faced

with a fourth-and-six on ti;e
Notre Dame 27. Pressure for a
quarterback leading only his sec
ond collegiate drive? No, not at all.
Palumbis rolled right to buy
time, then spotted Henry Greer
streaking down the right sideline
Green was well covered, but
Palumbis hung the ball up, Green
came back to it and made the
catch in front of the cornerback
and behind the safety.
"I just tried to put it over the
safety's head," Palumbis said,
"and hoped Henry came back to
get it. I didn't really do anything."
The Cardinal won the coin toss
to open the game, but everything
went the way of the Irish after
that. While Stanford went three
plays-and-out its first two posses
sions, Notre Dame moved the ball
well, scoring a touchdown when
Rice kept the ball while running
the option and ran 30 yards for
a score. On its second drive Notre
Dame moved the ball down to the
Cardinal four before missing a'
field goal.
Reggie Ho's missed PAT and
missed field goal gave the Cardi
nal hope at only six points down,
and a shovel pass to Volpe for 11
yards was good for Stanford's in
itial first down. On the next play,
however, a Johnson pass was
picked off by outside linebacker
Flash Gordon (yes, that's his real
name!), giving the Irish the ball
on the Stanford 30.
The hosts moved the ball to set
up a second-and-goal on the one,
but defensive tackle Lester Ar
chambeau and strong safety Rob
