## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
The country's top water polo
teams clashed at the Northern
California Tournament this week
end, and when the pools cleared
the national rankings proved cor
rect.
The top four squads, including
host Stanford, placed exactly as
they had been seeded. No. 1
UCLA, still undefeated, returned
south with yet another tourna
ment victory and a 15-0 record.
California finished second as a
result of its 5-4 loss to the Bruins
in the finals Saturday at deGuerre
pool. The third-ranked Cardinal
placed third, and fourth-rated
Southern California took fourth
place.

Cardinal 3rd in NorCal Tourney

Stanford, now 13-5 for the year,
had its toughest test of the week
end in the semifinals against first
seed UCLA. And although the
Cardinal was defeated 6-3 by the
eventual tournament victor, the
young squad showed how far it
has come in only the opening
weeks of the season.
After losing to the Bruins 10-5
at the UC-Irvine Tournament two
weeks ago, the Cardinal stayed
with the powerful squad for the
first three quarters of Saturday
morning's game. The Stanford de
fense did not let UCLA control

the tempo of the contest, and at
the half the Cardinal trailed by
one, 2-1. Even after the Bruins
won the sprint for the ball at the
beginning of the second half and
star two-meter man Alex Rous
seau added to UCLA's tally, the

Cardinal was still in the game
until the fourth quarter.
"I was pleased with the 2-1
score at half," coach Dante Det
tamanti said. "We played very well
defensively."
Although the Bruins opened up
the game in the final period, net
ting three goals and wearing out
Stanford's defense, the Cardinal
held the usually high-scoring
Bruins to one of its lowest scores
of the year. "We expect UCLA to
score 10 or 12 goals a game,"
Dettamanti said. "Rousseau is the
best two-meter man in the coun
try and we held him to only one
goal from two meters."
The Stanford six were not as
brilliant on offense as on defense,
however, and together could only
muster as many goals as Rous
seau himself tallied — three.
Holeman Eric Blum led off the
first quarter with a score and
added a second in the fourth pe
riod. Sophomore Rick McNair

added the third and final Cardinal
score in the last period. "We had
trouble getting to the open man
and needed to play more team
offense," senior fieldman Andrew
Lawson said. "If we can hold them
to three goals in the first three
periods we should have been able
to beat them."
"We had trouble running our
offense," Dettamanti said. "We
didn't take advantage of the mis
takes UCIJ\ made and took ill
advised shots. But UCLA's de
fense is great, even better than
their offense."
The Cardinal earned its third
place finish on account of its 10-6
victory over USC in the consola
tion finals Saturday afternoon.
With another brilliant defensive
effort, including twelve saves by
goalie Todd Kemp, and an accu
rate offense led by Blum and
fieldman Jon Swerdloff, Stanford
controlled the entire contest,
proving it does, indeed, deserve
to be ranked above the Trojans.
Blum's second goal of the game,
with three minutes remaining in
the second quarter, put Stanford
up 4-1, and the Trojans were
never able to overcome the deficit,
giving the Cardinal two wins in
as many attempts over USC this
season.
"I'm convinced we are a better
team than USC," Dettamanti
said.

team-high four goals. "Eric Blum
was a god today," sophomore
teammate Chuck Maguy said. "He
was dominant at two meters."
Swerdloff added three goals of
his own, freshman Chris Smith
scored two, and Lawson also
added a tally. As opposed to the
UCLA match, Stanford was able
to function as a team on offense
as well as on defense, making
clean passes and calling good
shots.
While Dettamanti praised the

entire squad's effort, he singled
out a number of players' individ
ual efforts. "Eric Blum is getting
better and better every game, and
Swerdloff played his normal great
game. And Kemp had his best
game of the year in the goal. USC
has brilliant shooters and he
stopped everything," Dettamanti
said.
Stanford reached the playoff
round of the tournament by win
ning its bracket during Friday's
games. In its first contest the Car
dinal slaughtered UC-Davis 13-2
Friday morning. Its afternoon op
ponent gave the squad more trou
ble. Stanford had to overcome
sixth-ranked UC-Santa Barbara's
tenacity to pull out a 9-8 victory.

Santa Barbara took a 3-2 lead in
the second quarter, and even after
the Cardinal regained the lead the
Gauchos continued to match Stan
ford goal for goal. It was not until
Swerdloffs accurate shot with
only 1:39 remaining that Stan
ford, with a 9-7 lead, could relax.
According to Dettamanti the
team's performance and placing
in the tournament clearly puts the
Cardinal into good standing this
early in the season. "We are a
solid third (in the nation). It is
going to be hard to break into the
top two — UCLA and Cad are
definitely talented — but on a
given day we could beat either of
them," he said.

riod. Sophomore Rick McNair

added the third and final Cardinal
score in the last period. "We had
trouble getting to the open man
and needed to play more team
offense," senior fieldman Andrew
Lawson said. "If we can hold them
to three goals in the first three
periods we should have been able
to beat them."
"We had trouble running our
offense," Dettamanti said. "We
didn't take advantage of the mis
takes UCIJ\ made and took ill
advised shots. But UCLA's de
fense is great, even better than
their offense."
The Cardinal earned its third
place finish on account of its 10-6
victory over USC in the consola
tion finals Saturday afternoon.
With another brilliant defensive
effort, including twelve saves by
goalie Todd Kemp, and an accu
rate offense led by Blum and
fieldman Jon Swerdloff, Stanford
controlled the entire contest,
proving it does, indeed, deserve
to be ranked above the Trojans.
Blum's second goal of the game,
with three minutes remaining in
the second quarter, put Stanford
up 4-1, and the Trojans were
never able to overcome the deficit,
giving the Cardinal two wins in
as many attempts over USC this
season.
"I'm convinced we are a better
team than USC," Dettamanti
said.

Swerdloff added three goals of
his own, freshman Chris Smith
scored two, and Lawson also
added a tally. As opposed to the
UCLA match, Stanford was able
to function as a team on offense
as well as on defense, making
clean passes and calling good
shots.
While Dettamanti praised the

entire squad's effort, he singled
out a number of players' individ
ual efforts. "Eric Blum is getting
better and better every game, and
Swerdloff played his normal great
game. And Kemp had his best
game of the year in the goal. USC
has brilliant shooters and he
stopped everything," Dettamanti
said.
Stanford reached the playoff
round of the tournament by win

sixth-ranked UC-Santa Barbara's
tenacity to pull out a 9-8 victory.

Santa Barbara took a 3-2 lead in
the second quarter, and even after
the Cardinal regained the lead the
Gauchos continued to match Stan
ford goal for goal. It was not until
Swerdloffs accurate shot with
only 1:39 remaining that Stan
ford, with a 9-7 lead, could relax.
According to Dettamanti the
team's performance and placing
in the tournament clearly puts the
Cardinal into good standing this
early in the season. "We are a
solid third (in the nation). It is
going to be hard to break into the
top two — UCLA and Cad are
definitely talented — but on a

Cardinal 3rd in NorCal Tourney

Stanford, now 13-5 for the year,
had its toughest test of the week
end in the semifinals against first
seed UCLA. And although the
Cardinal was defeated 6-3 by the
eventual tournament victor, the
young squad showed how far it
has come in only the opening
weeks of the season.
After losing to the Bruins 10-5
at the UC-Irvine Tournament two
weeks ago, the Cardinal stayed
with the powerful squad for the
first three quarters of Saturday
morning's game. The Stanford de
fense did not let UCLA control

the tempo of the contest, and at
the half the Cardinal trailed by
one, 2-1. Even after the Bruins
won the sprint for the ball at the
beginning of the second half and
star two-meter man Alex Rous
seau added to UCLA's tally, the

Cardinal was still in the game
until the fourth quarter.
"I was pleased with the 2-1
score at half," coach Dante Det
tamanti said. "We played very well
defensively."
Although the Bruins opened up
the game in the final period, net
ting three goals and wearing out
Stanford's defense, the Cardinal
held the usually high-scoring
Bruins to one of its lowest scores
of the year. "We expect UCLA to
score 10 or 12 goals a game,"
Dettamanti said. "Rousseau is the
best two-meter man in the coun
try and we held him to only one
goal from two meters."
The Stanford six were not as
brilliant on offense as on defense,
however, and together could only
muster as many goals as Rous
seau himself tallied — three.
Holeman Eric Blum led off the
first quarter with a score and
added a second in the fourth pe
riod. Sophomore Rick McNair
