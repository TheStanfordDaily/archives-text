SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
— A Korean boxer who knew
he didn't deserve his gold
raised the hand of an American
who felt cheated, and with that
noble gesture of sportsmanship
ended an Olympics that will be
remembered, sadly, for its
scandals.
So many athletes came and
did so well — the Soviet gym
nastic whizzes and men's bas
ketball team, East German
swimming star Kristin Otto,
and Americans Greg Louganis,
Janet Evans, Jim Abbott, Carl
Lewi3, Florence Griffith Joyner
and Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
The Soviets reigned again
with 55 golds, followed by East
Germany's 37 and the United

States' 36. Host South Korea
rose to No. 1 in Asia, and
fourth in the world with 12
golds.
As always, though, the
medals meant much less than
the memories the athletes and
fans took away with them.
"There have been high points
and some low points, and the
most important low point was
Ben Johnson," Juan Antonio
Samaranch, president of the In
ternational Olympic Commit
tee, said Monday. "That was
indeed a blow." Three golds,
three silvers and two bronzes
were quite a haul for the U.S.
boxers, but they weren't
enough to wipe out the bitterness
of a decision Sunday against 19-
year-old Roy Jones in the 156-
pound final against Korea's Park
Si-hun.
Jones peppered Park's face with
rights and left hooks for three
rounds, forced him to one stand
ing eight-count and could have
gotten three others that would
have ended the fight in the ring.
Instead, the decision went to the
judges and the result was aston
ishing — to the fighters, the
coaches and even to many

Koreans.
On the victory platform, the
gold around Park's neck and the
silver on Jones', the Korean raised
the American's hand for the
crowd. Here, the gesture said, is
the real winner.
"I thought I lost the fight,"
Park said. "I might have won the
gold medal thanks to the advan
tage of a home ring." Jones,
little soothed by his award after
ward from the International
Amateur Boxing Association as
the outstanding fighter of the
tournament, charged the judges
with robbing him of his gold and
his dream and said he was giving
up plans for a professional career.

Samaranch said Monday the
lOC will study whether boxing
should be continued in the Olym
pics because of the hazards in the
sport and the problems of officiat
ing.
"We are really not happy with
the way judges and officials are
acting," he said. "We take the
problem very seriously." A
much more serious problem for
the United States — a rising tide
of anti-American sentiment — was
exacerbated at the Games by the
coverage of NBC, the arrest of
several American athletes and the
perceived rudeness of the U.S.
team at the opening ceremony.
