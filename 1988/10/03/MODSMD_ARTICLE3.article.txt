## ASSU sparks contest with Bookstore over prices of supplies 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
The new Council of Presidents seems
to have won its first skirmish in its
battle against the Bookstore by encour
aging Bookstore officials to lower school
supply prices.
Charging that the Bookstore's prices
are "outrageous," the COP launched its
"Beat the Bookstore" Project Tuesday,
manning tables for three days in White
Plaza where students could order school
supplies, some costing less than half
the Bookstore's 1988 catalog prices. The
COP sold the supplies at prices near
cost.
The Bookstore counterpunched Wed
nesday with "The Price is Right at the
Bookstore" sale, lowering its prices just
below those offered by the COP.

Rose Sims, operations manager at the
Bookstore, said the Bookstore's sale was
partially as a response to the COP sale
but explained that the Bookstore usually
puts supplies on sale at the start of
each quarter. She also pointed out that
the Bookstore's in-store prices are lower
than its catalog prices.
The COP sale is over for the time
being, but the Bookstore sale will con

to the Bookstore's telephone informa

The "Beat the Bookstore" Project
evolved over the summer, according to
COP member Miguel M6rquez. The
COP, concerned about the Bookstore's
"outrageous prices," hoped that by sel

ASSU, M6rquez explained.

"It's unfortunate that some people
think we're trying to rip them off,"
Sims said. "We try to do everything we
can to serve them."
The Bookstore "does not make money
on books," Sims said. The publishers
set the prices on the books and the
Bookstore gives students a rebate at the
end of the year.
COP member Stacey Leyton, how
ever, is skeptical. "You can be non-profit
while putting money into capital im
provements," she said. The Bookstore
has opened up branches in the Stanford
Shopping Center and Palo Alto, she said.
"It makes you wonder when they expand
that much," she added.
"We know that students can get paper
and some other supplies for less expen-
