# Men's cross country captures invitational

Stanford's men's cross country team looks
like it has the stuff league champions are
made of. The men destroyed the field at the
Stanford Holiday Inn Invitational 10,000 Sat
urday, taking five of the top eight spots. On
the women's side, Stanford junior Carol Gray
scored a come-from-behind victory.

The team so thoroughly dominated the com
petition that five Cardinal runners shut out
runner-up Arizona. Scott Chisam, looking like
the (Boston Red Sox manager) Joe Morgan
of the West after his promotion to men's coach
this year, was thoroughly excited. "If we can
duplicate this performance at the Pacific 10
Championships, we win," he said.
Junior Eric Mastalir and senior James Al
borough led the Cardinal attack, taking third
and fourth in 31 minutes, 19 seconds and
31:21, respectively. Transfer Steve Miller, a
senior, took fifth just behind his new team
mates.

The team ran as a pack from the start, and
stayed in front while the other runners
dropped off. Junior Mark Mastalir and fresh
man Dave Scudamore ran fourth and fifth
for Stanford, with just a few seconds sepa
rating the squad members. Six of the teams
competing were from the Pac-10, but none
were able to dent the Cardinal attack.
Despite the uncertainty of early-season
speculation, the Cardinal seems a strong con
tender for the title in the Pac-10 Champion
ship meet at home next month. With a month
of solid training still left before the Champi
onships, none will have a better chance than
the Cardinal.
Gray was the only bright spot for Stanford
in the women's competition. Gray won the
race in the last 100 yards, but the women's
team finished a disappointing ninth.
Gray rounded the final sand trap before
pulling around Aisling Ryan of Arkansas, who
responded briefly before fading. "I wasn't set
ting up for it," said Gray, but "when I went
she didn't fight back."
Gray won in a time of 17:21, improving
considerably on her 17th-place finish in the
same meet last year.
Stanford's second runner, Melanie Bloch,
fell at the start of the race. The second Car
dinal jersey to cross the finish line, worn by

freshman Jodi Bilotta, did not arrive until a
minute and a half after Gray.
The men have made considerable strides
since last season. They "raced to the front,"
in Chisam's words, and held together while
the pack dropped off, in contrast to last year,
when runners tended to fade down the back
stretch. "A lot of [the team's improvement]
is maturity," Chisam remarked. Adding Miller
and Scudamore to Alborough and the Mastalir
brothers has given the men a stronger attack
early in the season.
"There are two things we have to work
on," according to Chisam. "We need to find
a sixth man, and the other thing is to stay
healthy."
Women's coach Brooks Johnson is counting
heavily on underclassmen to carry the team,
which leads to a squad that depends more on
emotion than experience. A yourg team can
do unexpectedly well, but can also go flat as
in Saturday's race.
Gray will carry a heavy load this year as
the women's team's captain and as its top
runner. "My goal is to get us to the NCAA
Championships," she said. (Stanford missed
the (hampionships last season after qualifying
in 1986.) The Stanford women are in the
same position as the men were last year, and
are not yet in competition condition.
