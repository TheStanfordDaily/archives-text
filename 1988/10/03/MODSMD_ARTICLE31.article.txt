# Spikers hurdle Huskies, crunch Cougars

### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The Washington schools posed
the challenge, and the Stanford
women's volleyball team rose to
the occasion. In a weekend
marked by streaky play and siz
zling offense, the Cardinal
upended Washington Friday night
in a tight four-game match (15-5,
11-15, 15-8, 17-15) and on Satur
day blew past Washington State
jn three (15-10, IS-ti, 15-4) to
claim second place in the Pacific
■10 Conference, edging to within
a game of No. 1 UCLA.
Women's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Huskies 1
Cardinal 3, Cougars 0
; The Cardinal, ranked third in
Jhe country behind the Bruins
and defending NCAA champion
Hawaii, raises it record to 11-1
overall and 5-1 in league, and is
off to the school's second-best
start ever (the 1985 squad, which
placed second in the NCAA to
then-upstart Pacific, dashed out
to 14 straight wins to open the
season).
The weekend's action began
with a cliffhanger contest with
Washington, who entered the
match one-half game ahead of the
host Cardinal. After breezing by
the Huskies in the first game,
Stanford encountered a revived
opponent in the second that raced
to an early 4-1 lead and broke an

11-11 deadlock to post the 15-11
win.
"Washington played really
well," sophomore Tracy Hughes
said. "They were probably at the
top of their game. We weren't
really ready for their style of play.
They really hustled a lot and
showed that they really wanted to
win. We were kind of on the de
fensive the entire night and didn't
really have that good of a match."
Husky hitter Laurie Wetzel,
who finished the match with a
game-high 20 kills, did a lot of
damage from both the front and
back rows, thanks to the excellent
setting by Los Altos native
Melinda Beckenhauer. Though
Stanford fought hard and well,
Washington clearly held an edge.
"One of the problems was that
during certain streaks in the game
Washington was passing very,
very well, and they were just run
ning their offense at will," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said. "Any
time a team passes the ball right
up to the net and has a pretty
good, quick offense like they do,
any team is going to have prob
lems. As soon as their passing
breaks down, they become much
more predictable."
After intermission, however,
the Cardinal came back with a
vengeance. Freshman Amy
Cooper and senior Amy Hayes
teamed up to record two straight
blocks that tied the game at 2-2,
and Stanford never looked back.
After reeling off five straight
points to finish the game, the Car
dinal held a 2-1 advantage enter

ing what turned out to be one of
the most exciting games yet
played in Maples Pavilion.
Both teams hit the court ready
to play, engaging in a lengthy side
out battle until a kill by Stanford
freshman Kristin Klein broke the
scoreless tie. Stanford then ex
tended its advantage to 7-3 before
Wetzel and teammate Kayley
Grim moved the Huskies to
within one. After extending the
lead once again, the Cardinal
found itself tied at 11, 13 and
then 14 with a team that just
would not relinquish the match.
"We knew we wanted it, but
they proved that they weren't
going to let up at all, they weren't
going to roll over and play dead,"
Hughes said. "Right up until the
end it was really close, and they
had a couple key calls as far as
the referees made a couple close

'We knew we wanted
it, but they proved
that they weren't
going to let up at all.
— Tracy Hughes

decisions. Those couple of breaks
that late in the game almost
handed us the match right there."
Inconsistent play finally cost
the Huskies. Stanford senior cap
tain Laura Olesen crushed an er
rant overpass to put the Cardinal
ahead 15-14 before a kill by Wet

zel and some court confusion tied
the match once again at 15-all. A
clumsy attempt by Wetzel to spike
an overpass cost Washington the
ball, and Stanford quickly capital
ized to secure the hard-fought
win.
The struggle Saturday night
was not nearly as great, thanks
to the inspired play of Cooper.
Almost flawless in middle hitting
and pretty strong in blocking, the
freshman recorded a game-high
15 kills for a blistering .600 hit
ting percentage along with tally
ing four blocks.
Classmate Jodi Birk also had
her bit in the limelight, making
her collegiate debut near the end
of the third game. Birk pounded
the ball cross-court to increase
Stanford's sizeable lead to 13-3,
hit again to bring the team to
match point and then strategically
tipped to score the match-winning
point.
"I think it was great that we
could get so many people in there
and do a good job," Shaw said.
"Unfortunately for Washington
State, they were not quite up to
the task. We played fairly well,
and it was nice to see people come
in there and do their job and do
what we expect them to do.
"In the continuity, we didn't
lose anything there. We just kind
of kept the status quo. Jodi Birk
came in for her first match and
got a couple of kills, and the whole
match when (sophomore Cheryl)
Conly came in she did a really
nice job. The kids off the bench
did a really nice job."

ning their offense at will," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said. "Any
time a team passes the ball right
up to the net and has a pretty
good, quick offense like they do,
any team is going to have prob
lems. As soon as their passing
breaks down, they become much
more predictable."
After intermission, however,
the Cardinal came back with a
vengeance. Freshman Amy
Cooper and senior Amy Hayes
teamed up to record two straight
blocks that tied the game at 2-2,
and Stanford never looked back.
After reeling off five straight
points to finish the game, the Car
dinal held a 2-1 advantage enter

ing what turned out to be one of
the most exciting games yet
played in Maples Pavilion.
Both teams hit the court ready
to play, engaging in a lengthy side
out battle until a kill by Stanford
freshman Kristin Klein broke the
scoreless tie. Stanford then ex
tended its advantage to 7-3 before
Wetzel and teammate Kayley
Grim moved the Huskies to
within one. After extending the
lead once again, the Cardinal
found itself tied at 11, 13 and
then 14 with a team that just
would not relinquish the match.
"We knew we wanted it, but
they proved that they weren't
going to let up at all, they weren't
going to roll over and play dead,"
Hughes said. "Right up until the
end it was really close, and they
had a couple key calls as far as
the referees made a couple close

'We knew we wanted
it, but they proved

going to let up at all.

decisions. Those couple of breaks
that late in the game almost
handed us the match right there."
Inconsistent play finally cost
the Huskies. Stanford senior cap
tain Laura Olesen crushed an er
rant overpass to put the Cardinal
ahead 15-14 before a kill by Wet

zel and some court confusion tied
the match once again at 15-all. A
clumsy attempt by Wetzel to spike
an overpass cost Washington the
ball, and Stanford quickly capital
ized to secure the hard-fought
win.
The struggle Saturday night
was not nearly as great, thanks
to the inspired play of Cooper.
Almost flawless in middle hitting
and pretty strong in blocking, the
freshman recorded a game-high
15 kills for a blistering .600 hit
ting percentage along with tally
ing four blocks.
Classmate Jodi Birk also had
her bit in the limelight, making
her collegiate debut near the end
of the third game. Birk pounded
the ball cross-court to increase
Stanford's sizeable lead to 13-3,
hit again to bring the team to
match point and then strategically
tipped to score the match-winning
point.
"I think it was great that we
could get so many people in there
and do a good job," Shaw said.
"Unfortunately for Washington
State, they were not quite up to
the task. We played fairly well,
and it was nice to see people come
in there and do their job and do
what we expect them to do.
"In the continuity, we didn't
lose anything there. We just kind
of kept the status quo. Jodi Birk
came in for her first match and
got a couple of kills, and the whole
match when (sophomore Cheryl)
Conly came in she did a really
nice job. The kids off the bench
did a really nice job."

Freshman Amy Cooper had an impressive weekend, with a total
of 21 kills and 12 blocks over the two day period.
The Washington schools posed
the challenge, and the Stanford
women's volleyball team rose to
the occasion. In a weekend
marked by streaky play and siz
zling offense, the Cardinal
upended Washington Friday night
in a tight four-game match (15-5,
11-15, 15-8, 17-15) and on Satur
day blew past Washington State
jn three (15-10, IS-ti, 15-4) to
claim second place in the Pacific
■10 Conference, edging to within
a game of No. 1 UCLA.

; The Cardinal, ranked third in
Jhe country behind the Bruins
and defending NCAA champion
Hawaii, raises it record to 11-1
overall and 5-1 in league, and is
off to the school's second-best
start ever (the 1985 squad, which
placed second in the NCAA to
then-upstart Pacific, dashed out
to 14 straight wins to open the
season).
The weekend's action began
with a cliffhanger contest with
Washington, who entered the
match one-half game ahead of the
host Cardinal. After breezing by
the Huskies in the first game,
Stanford encountered a revived
opponent in the second that raced
to an early 4-1 lead and broke an

11-11 deadlock to post the 15-11
win.
"Washington played really
well," sophomore Tracy Hughes
said. "They were probably at the
top of their game. We weren't
really ready for their style of play.
They really hustled a lot and
showed that they really wanted to
win. We were kind of on the de
fensive the entire night and didn't
really have that good of a match."
Husky hitter Laurie Wetzel,
who finished the match with a
game-high 20 kills, did a lot of
damage from both the front and
back rows, thanks to the excellent
setting by Los Altos native
Melinda Beckenhauer. Though
Stanford fought hard and well,
Washington clearly held an edge.
"One of the problems was that
during certain streaks in the game
Washington was passing very,
very well, and they were just run
ning their offense at will," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said. "Any
