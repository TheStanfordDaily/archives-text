# Men's soccer ends streak

### David Hirning Staff writer 
Sometimes, you can win for losing. The
Stanford men's soccer team contradicted
the old proverb last weekend by taking
second in the Stanford/AT&T Pacific West
Soccer Classic. Although the Cardinal fell
to third-ranked Portland in the title match
on Sunday 1-0, it regained a level of play
that has been missing since early season.

Stanford obliterated all traces of its four
game losing streak with a win over Simon
Fraser on Saturday, 2-0. The victory, while
not extremely well played by the Cardinal,
instilled it with a confidence that the squad
carried over into Sunday's game and hope
fully for the rest of their schedule.
After a lackluster first half in which
neither team effectively mounted a scoring
threat, Stanford's offense began to turn it
on. The Cardinal finally ended a scoreless
streak that was threatening to top Orel
Hershiser's when fullback Dave Thorpe
popped in a header at the 74:16 mark.
The score was a designed play that
worked to perfection. Jeff Rona, one of the
reserves that spurred the Cardinal on in
the second half, crossed the ball on a corner
kick to the far post, where Thorpe knocked
it between the hesitating post man and
goalkeeper for Stanford's first goal in four
games.
"Our offense relies a lot on confidence,
especially in front of the net. Once we got
a goal, people started to settle down a bit,"
said Thorpe, who was named to the all
tournament team.

The change was noticeable, as the Car
dinal began to take chances and open up
its offense. This allowed them to get an
opportunistic insurance goal, as all
tournament sweeper Mark Semioli popped
free with the ball and fed forward John
Howlett neatly for the easy goal.
"The second team did a very good job.
A couple players — Howlett, Rona, Todd
Cavens, Evan Nadler, Bing Kongmebhol —
they showed me they can play," Stanford
coach Sam Koch said.
Yet the Cardinal knew it would take
more than 25 minutes of solid play to stay
with Portland, a 1-0 winner over California
Saturday.
Portland, which had beaten Simon Fraser
earlier this season 5-1, entered the Stanford
game with a 10-0 record and eight shutouts
to their name.
But the home team nearly pulled off the
upset. With its characteristic stingy defense
and a revitalized offensive attack, the Car
dinal pressed the superior team to its limit.
Indeed, Koch's big guns all had oppor
tunities to score and were only barely
thwarted. Leading Stanford scorer Rhett
Harty, Semioli, Chris Porch, and Luke Gar
rott (also named to the all-tournament
team) spent much of the game in the
Portland side of the field, hammering all
tournament goalkeeper Casey Keller.
"Today we played better than we have
all year — one hundred percent better than
in our last 4 games (prior to the tourna
ment). We should have scored a couple of
goals," forward Porch said.
Instead, it was an unimpressive cross
that tournament MVP Jason Baarts headed
in for Portland that was the difference in
a very even game. After the goal at the
65:03 mark, Stanford mounted several
threats late in the game as Portland fell
back, but they all came up short. "I felt
it should have been a tie," Koch said.
