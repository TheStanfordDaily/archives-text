# University proposes new alcohol policy
## 
### Jill Daniels 
Recognizing the ambiguity and inef
ficacy of the University's alcohol policy,
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson designed a new policy this
summer. The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council will meet Oct. 12 to discuss
whether or not to adopt the draft.
Under Robinson's proposal, drinking
alcohol underage would not be a viola
tion of University rules. Contrary to
present policy, which prohibits students
under the age of 21 from consuming
alcohol under penalty of University dis
ciplinary procedures, the new policy
would decrease University regulation of
student alcohol consumption, shifting
the responsibility of deciding to drink
illegally entirely onto the students.
The present policy states that Stan
ford dorms must "seriously take into
account the age distributrion of its

posal, drinking alcohol
under age would not be a
violation of University
rules.

members so that the legal status of
those students who are not yet 21 years
of age shall be accorded recognition and
appropriate protection" and that "alco
holic beverages may be served at social
functions in the residences other than
those occupied predominantly by fresh
men only if non-alcoholic beverages are
also served." Believing that the policy's
wording was vague, Robinson set out
to establish -a new, clearer policy.

The new policy would make official
what has been practiced unofficially un
der the nearly unenforceable, existing
policy.
Robinson's approach fosters student
awareness and responsibility in consum
ing alcohol, and more realistically
defines the scope of University control
over drinking on campus.
Tha policy states that students must
"be aware of state and local laws . . .
(but) serving and consumption of alco
holic beverages by students are not vi
olations per se of University regula
tions."
Calling Stanford a "non-regulatory
environment," Robinson said his draft
clarifies the University's role in regulat
ing drinking and marks an innovative
method for college alcohol policies.
"It is an original one in that we are
different from most schools.
Others usually incorporate state
laws. Our approach makes the
most sense. It comes from an ed
ucational perspective rather than
a regulatory one, and enables stu
dents to focus on responsibility
rather than concentrate on getting
over the rules," Robinson said.
The focus on education encour
ages both individual and group
responsibility and awareness, ac
cording to Robinson. In keeping
with this idea, many dorms will
sponsor discussions about the
dangers and effects of alcohol and
will participate in the National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness
week to be held Oct. 17-21.
In accordance with University
policy when alcohol is served at a
dorm party, "equally attractive
non-alcoholic beverages" (the in
famous EANABS) must also be
served. This provision of Univer
sity policy would remain if the
revamped policy is adopted.
Although it is illegal in Califor
nia for students under age 21 to

drink or possess alcohol, many
resident fellows said learning to
deal with alcohol is an important
part of the residential education
Stanford offers. According to Don
ner RF Linda Paulson, controlled
exposure to alcohol teaches stu
dents under age 21 to approach
drinking more responsibly.

The University can't
control the drinking of
6,000 undergraduates
so it might as weii not
hide its head in the
sand ..

The students "are shocked by
not having to [consume alcohol]
behind closed doors, and it demys
tifies [drinking] so you get rid of
people doing it just because it is
forbidden," she said.
Paulson supports the proposed
University policy. "The alcohol
policy is illegal. I nonetheless
think it's very smart," she said.
"The University can't control
the drinking of 6,000 undergrad

uates, so it might as well not hide
its head in the sand, but it should
address it and deal with it," Paul
son added.
"Prohibition never works," said
Carol Wang, a Larkin resident as
sistant. Therefore, she and the
three other RAs worked out a
policy which Wang said she hopes
will "encourage (students) to be
responsible and learn to handle
alcohol."
This mirrors the practice of
most dorms on campus now, as
RAs and RFs seek to implement
tangible rules for dorm alcohol use
based on the guidelines of the cur
rent loose and unclear University
policy.
Students themselves usually
decide on the details within the
dorm of alcohol purchasing poli
cies, which vary between different
campus residences, but must
remain in accordance with the
University's general policy.
In the four-class dorm Loro, as
in many residences, a survey will
determine whether residents ad
vocate buying alcohol with dorm
funds, which come from the re
quired equal contributions of all
residents.

Recognizing the ambiguity and inef
ficacy of the University's alcohol policy,
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson designed a new policy this
summer. The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council will meet Oct. 12 to discuss
whether or not to adopt the draft.
Under Robinson's proposal, drinking
alcohol underage would not be a viola
tion of University rules. Contrary to
present policy, which prohibits students
under the age of 21 from consuming
alcohol under penalty of University dis
ciplinary procedures, the new policy
would decrease University regulation of
student alcohol consumption, shifting
the responsibility of deciding to drink
illegally entirely onto the students.
The present policy states that Stan
ford dorms must "seriously take into
account the age distributrion of its

Under Robinson's pro
posal, drinking alcohol
under age would not be a
violation of University
rules.

members so that the legal status of
those students who are not yet 21 years
of age shall be accorded recognition and
appropriate protection" and that "alco
holic beverages may be served at social
functions in the residences other than
those occupied predominantly by fresh
men only if non-alcoholic beverages are
also served." Believing that the policy's
wording was vague, Robinson set out
to establish -a new, clearer policy.

The new policy would make official
what has been practiced unofficially un
der the nearly unenforceable, existing
policy.
Robinson's approach fosters student
awareness and responsibility in consum
ing alcohol, and more realistically
defines the scope of University control
over drinking on campus.
Tha policy states that students must
"be aware of state and local laws . . .
(but) serving and consumption of alco
holic beverages by students are not vi
olations per se of University regula
tions."
Calling Stanford a "non-regulatory
environment," Robinson said his draft
clarifies the University's role in regulat
ing drinking and marks an innovative
method for college alcohol policies.
"It is an original one in that we are
different from most schools.
Others usually incorporate state
laws. Our approach makes the
most sense. It comes from an ed
ucational perspective rather than
a regulatory one, and enables stu
dents to focus on responsibility
rather than concentrate on getting
over the rules," Robinson said.
The focus on education encour
ages both individual and group
responsibility and awareness, ac
cording to Robinson. In keeping
with this idea, many dorms will
sponsor discussions about the
dangers and effects of alcohol and
will participate in the National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness
week to be held Oct. 17-21.
In accordance with University
policy when alcohol is served at a
dorm party, "equally attractive
non-alcoholic beverages" (the in
famous EANABS) must also be
served. This provision of Univer
sity policy would remain if the
revamped policy is adopted.
Although it is illegal in Califor
nia for students under age 21 to

drink or possess alcohol, many
resident fellows said learning to
deal with alcohol is an important
part of the residential education
Stanford offers. According to Don
