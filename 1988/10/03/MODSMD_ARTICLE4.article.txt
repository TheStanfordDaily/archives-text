# University proposes new alcohol policy

Recognizing the ambiguity and inef
ficacy of the University's alcohol policy,
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson designed a new policy this
summer. The Student Conduct Legisla
tive Council will meet Oct. 12 to discuss
whether or not to adopt the draft.
Under Robinson's proposal, drinking
alcohol underage would not be a viola
tion of University rules. Contrary to
present policy, which prohibits students
under the age of 21 from consuming
alcohol under penalty of University dis

Tha policy states that students must
"be aware of state and local laws . . .
(but) serving and consumption of alco

olations per se of University regula
tions."
Calling Stanford a "non-regulatory
environment," Robinson said his draft
clarifies the University's role in regulat
ing drinking and marks an innovative
method for college alcohol policies.
"It is an original one in that we are
