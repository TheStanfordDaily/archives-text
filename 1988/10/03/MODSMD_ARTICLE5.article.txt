# Eshoo assails Campbell's record on women's issues
## 
### DJ Berinstein 
In this election year, candidates
nationwide are trying to stick
their opponents with the "L
-word" or liberal label. But in the
12th Congressional District,
which includes Stanford, Demo
cratic contender Anna Eshoo is
trying to brand her opponent, Re
publican Tom Campbell, with the
"C-word."
Throughout the campaign, Es
hoo has charged that Campbell, a
Stanford law professor, is "not a
moderate, he's a conservative."
Citing the fact that Campbell
testified before Congress concern
ing the nomination of Judge
Robert Bork to the Supreme
Court, Eshoo has been question
ing Campbell's sincerity on wo
mens' issues.
Following a Friday night forum
in Menlo Park, Eshoo told The
Daily that Campbell's "public
record concerning Bork speaks for
itself. Bork represents an era long
ago past in the United States, and
Campbell went to the table for

CAMPAIGN
!§§

him. [Campbelll has never been
a legislator, but a theoretician. I
don't hear many solutions. He's
not a moderate, he's a conserva
tive."
But Campbell said he was asked
by the Senate to read Bork's
opinions on labor law, and on that
subject only. He said he felt the
press, and as a result the public,
had sorely mistreated Bork. "As
far as my relation to Bork, what
matters now are my views on the
issues. Bork is past news," he
said.
In response to Eshoo's charges
of conservatism, Campbell said he
was a conservative on economic
matters, but said he found the
statement amusing. "When I ran
against (incumbent) Ernie Kon
nyu in the primary, he called me
a liberal. Now Eshoo calls me a
conservative. In reality, I'm some
where in between."
Friday's forum was largely un
eventful and the candidates were
unable to define their dif
ferences. The two were joined by
Libertarian candidate Tom Gray.
In the forum, Eshoo hinted at
the issue of conservatism by ex
plaining her campaign slogan,
"Challenging the Sacred Cows,"
as an effort to question the "old
ways" of this district, a Republi
can stonghold for the past 20
years.
Campbell, the front-runner,
agreed sarcastically that challenge
is important to Eshoo, the chal
lenger. He then offered specific
solutions to several issues. Camp
bell said he supports raising taxes
on alcohol and tobacco to reduce
the defecit.
Campbell attacked Eshoo for
saying she balanced budgets while
president of the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors, ex

plaining that Eshoo was required
to do so by law.
Stepping away from Republican
party positions, Campbell said he
supports the Civil Rights Resto
ration Act as well as the Equal
Rights Amendment. He said he
believes that employers who dis
criminate should be punished as
criminals.
Gray, whose name was left off
the press release announcing the
forum, spoke about his party's
goal of peace, and related the
peace issue to almost every other
issue addressed. He discussed the
budget in terms of "changing the
mission of our country" by ending
all spending on defense.
"I think you should always vote
for the candidate who spends the
least amount on a campaign, es
pecially because I would win,"
Gray said.
On campaign spending, Eshoo
advocated public financing as well
as implementation of ceilings on
spending. Campbell hypothesized
that if more politicians were al
lowed free air time and print
space, there would be less of a
need to spend such large amounts
of money.
