# Stanford falls from number one in poll
## 
### Stephanie Page 
Stanford has always been ranked No.
1 in U.S News and World Report's sur
vey of America's best colleges. No longer.
Stanford has fallen to No. 6 while
Yale University, ranked third last year,
has overtaken the top spot. The survey
is in this week's magazine, which goes
on sale today.
Princeton, the California Institute of
Technology, Harvard and the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology round out
the top five schools.
Stanford officials downplayed the
results, just as they had in years when
Stanford had the top ranking.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter said
she is "skeptical of how people are
judging quality," and emphasized that
Stanford has "always discounted the
validity of the survey."
Last year, when Stanford was ranked
No. 1, University President Donald Ken
nedy described the poll as "a beauty
contest, not a serious analysis of
quality." Kennedy is out of town and
was unavailable for comment yesterday.
Kennedy has never participated in the
survey. Neither he nor Fetter answered
this year's questionnaire. In a letter to
the editor of U.S. News, Kennedy ex
plained he did not "feel close enough to
these institutions" to make an evalua
tion.
Bob Beyers, director of University
News and Publications, said the survey
does not reflect "how students vote with
their feet" noting that Stanford's 64
percent "yield ratio" — the percentage
of accepted applicants who enroll as
freshman — is second only to Harvard's.

U.S. News first conducted its survey
in 1983 by asking university presidents
to rank colleges nationwide. This year,
in its fourth survey, the magazine made
major changes to determine the
rankings.
Academic deans and admissions direc
tors were also asked their opinions, and
four "objective critieria" were used to
set the final results. These criteria in
cluded each school's financial resources,
strength of faculty and teaching, the
percentage of incoming freshmen who
earn degrees and the quality of the stu
dent body as determined by each school's
selectivity.
In the category of national univer
sities, Yale topped 204 other schools.
Swarthmore College headed the list of
141 liberal-arts colleges. The two are
the alma maters of the presidential can
didates, George Bush (Yale, 1948) and
Michael Dukakis (Swarthmore, 1955).
When asked why she felt Stanford had
fallen from No. 1, Dean Fetter responded
that she was uncertain what the new
"objective criteria" entailed but "in any
comparison of endowment per student
Harvard, Yale and Princeton will be
ahead of Stanford."
Endowment per student and library
budget per student comprised the
"resource measure," one of the four new
categories of objective criteria in the sur
vey.
Fetter did not know whether the sur
vey would affect admissions. However,
she emphasizied that colleges have
varying strengths.
"If students and parents are going to
choose a college by looking at ranking
lists, it is really too bad."
