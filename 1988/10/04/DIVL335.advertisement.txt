with the rest of my family. Throughout high school, the TM program established a
stability and intimate appreciation of myself during what are generally characterized
as awkward years' by certain adult authorities on the subfecL They were productive
years of unbelievable growth for me, both in factual knowledge and in the deepening
quality of human relationships.

distort a student; as a meditator. I am not too worried by all that At exam time, people
around me are always anxious, but I don't feel the same pinch. With this freedom, I
succeed regularty: I was named, the 'most intellectually promising freshman.' Last
fall. I went out for cross-country and amazed everyoneby running second on the
varsity squad without ever having run on a team befbre My rapid improvement and
consistent performance were due to the same stability.
