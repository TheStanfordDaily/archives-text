The Daily is looking for a few good
men and women to serve as:
Proofreaders: If you can spot a typo a mile away and
have some free time between 6:30 and 11:30 p.m. this
could be the job for you. They'll be some dead time
where you can make a dent in your homework.
Call Kathy at 322-3536 for more information.

Wire editors: If you think you're a budding Brokaw or
a junior Jennings, come on in and help put together
the World & Nation page. You'll work between 7:30
and 9:30 p.m. and get a chance to work for the
Mid-Peninsula's only morning newspaper.
Call Paul or Rob at 723-4632 after 7 p.m.
