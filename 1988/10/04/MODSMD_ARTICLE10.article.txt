DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -
Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon
freed Indian educator Mithilesh
war Singh, a resident alien of the
United States, after holding him
hostage for more than 20 months
and Singh was taken to Syria early
today.
The kidnappers, who still hold
three American colleagues of
Singh, released the Indian profes
sor in southern Beirut last night
and Syrian intelligence officers
drove him to Damascus.
He was taken to a government
guest house where two doctors ex
amined him, according to a gov
ernment official who spoke on con
dition he not be identified. The
official said the examination was
"a normal routine" and gave no
details.
He said Singh talked by tele
phone with the U.S. ambassador

in Damascus, Edward Djerjian,
and would be turned over to the
ambassador later today at the
Foreign Ministry.
In Beirut, Singh's wife choked
back tears as she told reporters:
"This is a happy day for me, but
I still did not see him. I want to
see him."
Singh, 60, was released at 10:05
p.m. across the street from the
Beirut headquarters of the U.N.
Relief and Works Agency that aids
Palestinian refugees, a Lebanese
police spokesman said.
He was freed five minutes after
a deadline set by Islamic Jihad
for the Liberation of Palestine,
which still holds three American
college teachers kidnapped with
Singh at Beirut University College
in Moslem west Beirut on Jan.
24, 1987. The kidnappers posed
as police officers.

Nine Americans are among the
16 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
Held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
In Washington, the State De
partment said "we are anxious to
talk to him (Singh) and learn if
he has any information to share
with us" about the other captives.
Press representative Phyllis
Oakley said: "We join with Mr.
Singh's relatives in rejoicing in
his release and call for the urgent,
unconditional release of all
hostages in Lebanon."
Syrian intelligence officers and
plainclothes secret service agents
took Singh into their custody in
front of the former Kuwaiti Em
bassy building facing the UNRWA
headquarters in Bir Hassan on
Beirut's southern outskirts, police

reported. About 7,500 Syrian sol
diers are stationed in west Beirut.
Nasser Qaddor, Syrian minister
of state for foreign affairs, had
said in Damascus last night that
an American hostage was freed
and in Syrian hands.
Singh holds an Indian passport
and an American green card that
makes him a legal resident alien
of the United States.
Earlier reports by the CBS and
NBC television networks and a
Christian radio station in Beirut
said American teacher Alann
Steen, 49, a native of Boston and
one of those kidnapped with
Singh, was the man to be released.
A 36-word handwritten state
ment in Arabic delivered to a
Western news agency yesterday
said the hostage would be freed
by 10 p.m.
