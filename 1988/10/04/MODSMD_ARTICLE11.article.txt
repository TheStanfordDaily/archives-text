# Dukakis says he offers solutions
## Stresses economic inequality on Chicago's South side 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — Michael Dukakis made
a rare visit to Chicago's South side and told
black supporters yesterday that George Bush
would lead an America "where the very rich
get even richer and the rest of us just get
by."
The Democratic presidential nominee
opened a speech at the Regal Theater on
Chicago's South Side with a tribute to the
late Mayor Harold Washington and Dukakis'
former rival in the presidential race, Jesse
Jackson.
Then, repeatedly using the phrase "aim
high," Dukakis promised an administration
that would enforce civil rights laws and pro
vide same-day voter registration; pick judges
committed to equality; improve the quality of
inner city schools; and assist minority-owned
small businesses.
"In a few short weeks, the American people
will choose between two fundamentally differ
ent futures, two different roads to travel," the
Massachusetts governor said. "One road leads
to an America of privilege — an America
where the very rich get even richer and the
rest of us just get by. This is George Bush's
America.

"The other road leads to an America of
hope and opportunity for all our citizens,"
Dukakis said. "My friends, I want to lead
America on that high road of hope and op
portunity. I want to lead America into a new
decade and a new era of greatness."
Aides said it was the first venture by a
presidential candidate to Chicago's South Side
since Jimmy Carter in 1976.
Dukakis, as he did earlier in the day during
a rally in Hartford, Conn., revealed no new
proposals and instead touched on familiar in
itiatives. On both occassions he used the "best
America" theme to end his speech, as he ended
his closing statement at the recent debate with
Bush.
In between the Connecticut and Chicago
stops, Dukakis stopped in Dearborn Heights
outside Detroit to speak to students about
drug use and help destroy about $100,000
worth of marijuana, cocaine and heroin by
tossing it into a county incinerator.
"If you think America should settle for the
bronze medal, t|ien you vote for Bush and
(Dan) Quayle," a shirtsleeved Dukakis told
the Hartford rally.
"But if you believe, as I do, that America

and Americans should go for the gold — in
the classrooms, in the workplace and in the
world economy — then your ticket on Nov.
8 is Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen."
Alluding to the Discovery's successful space
mission, Dukakis said that just as President
Kennedy made the decision to send Americans
to the moon, the next president would have
to restore U.S. leadership in the world mar
ketplace.
"John Kennedy raised the Stars and Stripes
until they literally reached the moon," he said.
"I want to stamp the Stars and Stripes on
American products all over the globe."
Raising his voice to be heard over chanting
Bush supporters, Dukakis scoffed at what he
called the vice president's contention that
"everything's fine, not to worry."
"Ask yourself this: Could your children
today buy the house they grew up in?" he
asked. "Can they pay for a college education
without a mountain of debt when they grad
uate? Is your family really getting ahead —
or is it just running in place or even falling
behind?"
