Polish gov't foe reports offer
WARSAW, Poland (AP) — A moderate oppo
sition figure who founded a group to promote
private enterprise said he was offered a position
yesterday in the government being formed by
new Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski.
Unconfirmed reports said other members of
the opposition also were approached about serv
ing in the government.
Aleksander Paszynski, who edits a magazine
for private home builders and who founded the
pro-business Economic Society, said in a tele
phone interview that he was offered a position
at a meeting with Rakowski yesterday.
The Economic Society for a year has been
stymied in its bid for official registration.
Paszynski said Rakowski's offer concerned the
Ministry of Construction and Local Planning and
the job would deal with apartment construction.
He declined to be more specific and said he had
not made up his mind whether to accept.

supporters plan "blackouts and clashes with the
people to interfere in the delivery of results" of

of possible violence aimed at invalidating the
results. Among those expressing concern is Bishop

Libya, Chad restore relations
PARIS (AP) — L ; * <1 leader Moammar Gad
hafi and Chadian Prtsident Hissene Habre, bitter
enemies in a long desert conflict, restored diplo
matic relations between their nations yesterday
and agreed to solve their differences peacefully.
A statement issued in both countries and in
Lome, Togo, said Chad and Libya would
"scrupulously respect the Sept. 11, 1987 cease
fire" that ended the fighting in northern Chad.
The agreement, mediated by Togolese President
Gnassingbe Eyadema, comes at a time when the
mercurial Gadhafi appears to be showing signs
of some moderation, at least with regard to his
neighbors in North Africa.
