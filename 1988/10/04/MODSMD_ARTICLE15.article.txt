This year's all-campus
party was a big success
after last year's big flop

The all-campus party
at Tresidder last Friday was
a success, and hopefully the
Concert Network can keep up the
good work.
This year, instead of trying to
attract big-names-gone-bad (like
The Tubes who were featured at
last year's all-campus fiasco), Tres
idder Programs and the Concert
Network relied on lesser-known
bands, who nonetheless have a fol
lowing. This year, between 4,000
and 5,000 pairs of feet danced to
the beat until the wee hours of the
morning, while only about 1,000
students wandered into (and then
quickly out of) the Inner Quad to
see The Tubes last year.
William King, program director
of Tresidder Programs, estimates
that between $9,500 and $11,000
was spent on this year's party. Last
year, the ASSU budgeted $10,000
for their "tubular" extravaganza.
So this year the price tag stayed
about the same, but everyone got
a lot more out of the evening.
This year several talented bands
were hired to perform and, as a
result, party-goers were treated to
five and a half hours of music that
they could dance to.
Even though not everybody on
the Stanford campus had heard of
the Crazy B's, free admission at

tracted a substantial crowd. That
kind of increased publicity for the
bands could make it more
profitable for the Concert Network
to engage them again and charge
a reasonable admission price. The
Concert Network would still throw
a successful party.
Choosing bands with a multi
cultural flair was also a good call.
As COP member David Brown
said, the party was therefore "more
open to everybody."
And when you're so busy danc
ing, the focus of the party shifts
away from alcohol. The fact that
alcoholic beverages were barred
from the patio areas outside Tres
idder didn't seem to detract at all
from the general revelry.
The sponsors also seemed to
have hit upon the formula for
making non-alcoholic beverages
truly "equally attractive." They
gave them away.
Food was free, too; always a
drawing card for students who just
spent their last summer paychecks
on textbooks.
Even those who didn't feel like
dancing were entertained. The Cof
fee House Comedy Night was
packed. Those who were of age
could also buy beer and wine.
Every base was covered.
The party was proof that the
entertainment doesn't have to be
U2 in order for the audience to
leave satisfied. The Concert Net
work doesn't have to try to com
pete with Bill Graham to be suc
cessful. They can try to find a
happy medium in the wide range
between U2 and The Tubes.
