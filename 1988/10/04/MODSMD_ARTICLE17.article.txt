## Finding your own pace 
### 
THIS SUMMER I bicycled from
Stanford to Washington, D.C.
"And what did you learn?" so
few have asked.
Sometimes I answer that northern
Kansas is not flat. That the freeway
shoulder throughout Nevada is infested
by jumpy, crunchy crickets. That the
Rockies are tall. Very tall. That this coun
try is wide and beautiful.
Almost invariably I tell them that I
never believed that I could cycle across
the country. I am no great athlete, nor
was I a cyclist. Only five months ago I
traded a one-speed, one-brake junk ma
chine for a decent bike and rode, for the
first time, further than 10 miles. One
can accomplish a seemingly gargantuan
task by breaking it down and taking it
one day at a time.
"You ought to listen to yourself some
time," says someone in my head ao I'm
spouting my infinite wisdom to the few
who do ask.
Last week, I rode for the first time
with the Stanford cycling team, some
thing which I've looked forward to for
some time. We left the post office just
after 3:30 p.m. Despite the fact that I'm
not very fast, I joined the fast group. I
disliked the idea of joining a "slow" group
where, in typical fashion, all of the women
seemed to migrate. No, I told myself, I
won't fall into that. I'll never improve
unless I challenge myself. Besides, I
thought, I can keep up. I cycled across
the country and even teach a cycling class.
As we rode through campus, I watched
carefully the sight I'd seen most often
throughout the country: another cyclist's

back tire two feet in front of my front
tire. Although the cyclists were strangers,
riding in a tight pack through campus
under a clear, blue sky was familiar.
I was fine as we turned down Foothill,
even Alpine. The pace was faster than I
normally ride, but I have ridden faster.
Once we hit Sand Hill, my self-doubts
set in. Do I belong with these guys? I
started losing ground after getting a late
start at the stop light. I caught up, tucked
into the pack, and noticed that I was
breathing harder than the guy next to
me. I could hold this pace for now, but
could I hold it for the rest of the ride
without wheezing? As we climbed the
gradual hills that I've ridden so many
times before, I continued to talk myself
out of the ride.
I saw another group of riders 200 yards
back and assumed they were the "slow"
group. I waited for them at the top pf
the hill, giving up on the fast pack, only
to learn that the approaching riders were
late joiners to the fast pack. As we crossed
Highway 280 and headed up the final
Sand Hill hill I lost even more ground.
Turn back, I thought. I had imagined
riding with this team ever since crossing
the Rockies, and already I had humiliated
myself. I convinced myself that cycling
was a false passion which I actually dis
liked. That I was a failure because I
couldn't keep up. I thought about getting
rid of the bike on which I had ridden
across the country. I'd never improve and
couldn't even ride these foothills at my
own pace.
Luckily, by the time the traffic had
cleared I was near the top of the hill.

When I reached the top, the pack was
out of sight. Never one to resist a down
hill, 1 raced forward at top speed, and
then continued to ride slowly through
the beautiful, quiet hills which are home
to my most introspective thoughts.
I realized that what I had done was
not atypical for me, or for others at Stan
ford. It's easy to lose ground here, or
anywhere in life; to start too quickly and
overestimate our abilities. Too often I
try to conquer the world in a day. When
I inevitably do not reach my inflated
expectations, I quit, convinced that I'm
really not interested anyway. Or that I
don't have time. Or that I am a failure.
As I debated riding home, I realized
that the slow group was somewhere in
these foothills, getting stronger and
faster. I kept reminding myself that the
road to success is (often literally) quite
long. This summer I bicycled from Stan
ford to Washington, D.C. Day by day at
my pace. But I have also learned that it
takes a certain amount of courage just
to attempt activities which do not guar
antee success.
Next time, I will ride through the foot
hills with the slow group. Each day we
will get stronger, and each day, faster.

THIS SUMMER I bicycled from
Stanford to Washington, D.C.
"And what did you learn?" so
few have asked.
Sometimes I answer that northern
Kansas is not flat. That the freeway
shoulder throughout Nevada is infested
by jumpy, crunchy crickets. That the
Rockies are tall. Very tall. That this coun
try is wide and beautiful.
Almost invariably I tell them that I
never believed that I could cycle across
the country. I am no great athlete, nor
was I a cyclist. Only five months ago I
traded a one-speed, one-brake junk ma
chine for a decent bike and rode, for the
first time, further than 10 miles. One
can accomplish a seemingly gargantuan
task by breaking it down and taking it
one day at a time.
"You ought to listen to yourself some
time," says someone in my head ao I'm
spouting my infinite wisdom to the few
who do ask.
Last week, I rode for the first time
with the Stanford cycling team, some
thing which I've looked forward to for
some time. We left the post office just
after 3:30 p.m. Despite the fact that I'm
not very fast, I joined the fast group. I
disliked the idea of joining a "slow" group
where, in typical fashion, all of the women
seemed to migrate. No, I told myself, I
won't fall into that. I'll never improve
unless I challenge myself. Besides, I
thought, I can keep up. I cycled across
the country and even teach a cycling class.
As we rode through campus, I watched
carefully the sight I'd seen most often
throughout the country: another cyclist's

back tire two feet in front of my front
tire. Although the cyclists were strangers,
riding in a tight pack through campus
under a clear, blue sky was familiar.
I was fine as we turned down Foothill,
even Alpine. The pace was faster than I
normally ride, but I have ridden faster.
Once we hit Sand Hill, my self-doubts
set in. Do I belong with these guys? I
started losing ground after getting a late
start at the stop light. I caught up, tucked
into the pack, and noticed that I was
breathing harder than the guy next to
me. I could hold this pace for now, but
could I hold it for the rest of the ride
without wheezing? As we climbed the
gradual hills that I've ridden so many
times before, I continued to talk myself
out of the ride.
I saw another group of riders 200 yards
back and assumed they were the "slow"
group. I waited for them at the top pf
the hill, giving up on the fast pack, only
to learn that the approaching riders were
late joiners to the fast pack. As we crossed
Highway 280 and headed up the final
Sand Hill hill I lost even more ground.
Turn back, I thought. I had imagined
riding with this team ever since crossing
the Rockies, and already I had humiliated
myself. I convinced myself that cycling
was a false passion which I actually dis
liked. That I was a failure because I
couldn't keep up. I thought about getting
rid of the bike on which I had ridden
across the country. I'd never improve and
couldn't even ride these foothills at my
own pace.
Luckily, by the time the traffic had
cleared I was near the top of the hill.

When I reached the top, the pack was
out of sight. Never one to resist a down
hill, 1 raced forward at top speed, and
then continued to ride slowly through
the beautiful, quiet hills which are home
to my most introspective thoughts.
I realized that what I had done was
not atypical for me, or for others at Stan
ford. It's easy to lose ground here, or
anywhere in life; to start too quickly and
overestimate our abilities. Too often I
try to conquer the world in a day. When
I inevitably do not reach my inflated
expectations, I quit, convinced that I'm
really not interested anyway. Or that I
don't have time. Or that I am a failure.
