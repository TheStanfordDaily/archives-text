Batra lecture cash
targeted for rural
development project
On Tuesday Sept. 27, Dr. Ravi
Batra, economist and best-selling au
thor of "The Great Depression of
1990," spoke to a near-capacity crowd
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The Daily
stated in an article on Sept. 29 that
the proceeds from Ravi Batra's lecture
will go to charity. "But that charity,"
the article claims, "is the PROUT In
stitute, an organization dedicated to
the furthering of his (Ravi Batra's)
theory."

But first and foremost
PROUT advocates a
change of heart.

This is not correct, however. The
proceeds from this lecture will be
handed over to Ananda Nagar — a
rural developmental project in India.
PROUT — The Progressive Utiliza
tion Theory — is a new societal
paradigm, a holistic vision based on
neo-humanistic education, economic
self-sufficiency, new forms of agricul
ture, alternative sources of energy and
ecology. But first and foremost PROUT
advocates a change of heart. P.R.
Sarkar, the propounder of PROUT,
believes that a radical shift in human
consciousness must take place before
comprehensive economic, social or polit
ical reforms can take place.
That other economists, journalists
and politicians questions Ravi Batra
and his PROUT philosophy is natural.
Those with vested interests in the
status quo will find his ideas threaten
ing. Other intellectual skeptics find
them too idealistic. And, of course,
Hoover Institution seniors like Robert

Hall (quoted in The Daily's article) will
remain in their ivory tower contempla
ting their self-indulgent trickle-down
theory.
I am glad to see that the genuinely
humane PROUT continues to create a
stir in the world of bankrupt intellec
tuality and selfish human sentiments.

Writing class lines
are an unnecessary
first day dilemna
Another quarter begins and another
line forms outside the Creative Writing
Department office to enroll in fiction
writing courses (The Daily, Sept. 30).
The lines are long and the competi
tion is fierce. Women and children are
trampled. Signing class lists for fiction
writing can even be more hazardous
than going to ASSU Sunday Flicks.
But why must all of this go on dur
ing the first day of classes? Why can't
the Creative Writing Department have
class sign-ups during the University's
registration period, like nearly every
other department on campus?
Perhaps the director of the Creative
Writing Department should get his own
house in order before he lays blame on
the deans.

Bikers should use
reflectors or lights
when out at night
Bikes without lights or reflectors are
menaces for which there is no reason
able excuse.
I am an enthusiast for bicycling, and

would like to see more of it, but I
don't like being frightened, when
driving an automobile, by dark-clad
cyclists looming up in the middle of
Campus Drive, as happened this eve
ning.
I appeal to nonconformist cyclists:
Please, please put reflectors on your
wheels. Rebellion against this reason
able regulation is a sorry way of
showing your independence; anyway,
it's stupid.
And you good people who use reflec
tors, and even lights: Put a little peer
pressure on those who don't. They're
giving all of us a bad name.

Vartain knew that
students were part
of the union team
I would like to clear up an inac
curacy contained in the letter of Mi
chael Vartain, the University's chief
negotiator, which was published on
Sept. 27. Vartain suggests that the
reason he and the other University
negotiators walked out of negotiations
was because they felt that the students
present at the bargaining table were
impartial observers, whose presence the
University had refused to allow during
negotiations, rather than members of
the United Stanford Workers' negotiat
ing team. But, in fact, both myself and
the other students participating in the
negotiations were identified clearly as
members of the USW team from the
moment we sat down at the bargaining
table. This is a fact which Vartain
acknowledged at the time.

status quo will find his ideas threaten
ing. Other intellectual skeptics find
them too idealistic. And, of course,
Hoover Institution seniors like Robert

Hall (quoted in The Daily's article) will
remain in their ivory tower contempla
ting their self-indulgent trickle-down
theory.
I am glad to see that the genuinely
humane PROUT continues to create a
stir in the world of bankrupt intellec
tuality and selfish human sentiments.

Writing class lines
are an unnecessary
first day dilemna
Another quarter begins and another
line forms outside the Creative Writing
Department office to enroll in fiction
writing courses (The Daily, Sept. 30).
The lines are long and the competi
tion is fierce. Women and children are
trampled. Signing class lists for fiction
writing can even be more hazardous
than going to ASSU Sunday Flicks.
But why must all of this go on dur
ing the first day of classes? Why can't
the Creative Writing Department have
class sign-ups during the University's
registration period, like nearly every
other department on campus?
Perhaps the director of the Creative
Writing Department should get his own
house in order before he lays blame on
the deans.

Bikers should use
reflectors or lights
when out at night
Bikes without lights or reflectors are
menaces for which there is no reason
able excuse.
I am an enthusiast for bicycling, and

would like to see more of it, but I
don't like being frightened, when
driving an automobile, by dark-clad
cyclists looming up in the middle of
Campus Drive, as happened this eve
ning.
I appeal to nonconformist cyclists:
Please, please put reflectors on your
wheels. Rebellion against this reason
able regulation is a sorry way of
showing your independence; anyway,
it's stupid.
And you good people who use reflec
tors, and even lights: Put a little peer
pressure on those who don't. They're
giving all of us a bad name.

Vartain knew that
students were part
of the union team
I would like to clear up an inac
curacy contained in the letter of Mi
chael Vartain, the University's chief
negotiator, which was published on
Sept. 27. Vartain suggests that the
reason he and the other University
negotiators walked out of negotiations
was because they felt that the students
present at the bargaining table were
impartial observers, whose presence the
University had refused to allow during
negotiations, rather than members of
the United Stanford Workers' negotiat
ing team. But, in fact, both myself and
the other students participating in the
negotiations were identified clearly as
members of the USW team from the
moment we sat down at the bargaining
table. This is a fact which Vartain
acknowledged at the time.
