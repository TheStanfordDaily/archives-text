# ASSU Senate Chair to resign
## Vaughan's surprise departure will leave post up for grabs 
### Eric Young Senior Staff writer 
ASSU Senate Chair Richard Vaughan
yesterday confirmed that he will resign
from his post this Thursday — following
the Senate's first meeting of the quarter.
Vaughan, a graduate student in computer
science, admitted that he did not believe
he could make an adequate time commit
ment to the job. Vaughan added that he
was "tired" and wanted to take a break
from his studies.
Currently looking for a job, Vaughan will
leave Stanford in January.
Vaughan's initial announcement came in
a letter, dated Sept. 30, sent to all senators.
The one-page letter did not state his
reasons for stepping down.
Of the 41 senators, several said they
learned of Vaughan's plan to resign during
an ASSU retreat this past weekend.
Senator Pearl Chen said she was sur

prised by Vaughan's announcement and
was unsure of his reasons for resigning.
However, she and several other senators
speculated that Vaughan's decision was
based on his commitment to his Ph.D. re
search.
Senator Bob Griffin said the move "did
not come as a big surprise." According to
Griffin, the senate chair "bounced the idea
(of resigning) off some people he knew"
last week.
Saying that she was "disappointed" by
his decision, Senator Millie Gong noted
that Vaughan's resignation "changes the
perspective" of the Senate during a time
when ASSU was trying to work toward
the cohesiveness.
According to Vaughan's letter, his job
does not necessarily go to the second in
command, Deputy Chair Aimee Allison.
As it now stands, the job is up for grabs.
Both undergraduates and graduates can

apply for the post.
Council of Presidents member
Miguel M£rquez noted that past
senate chairs were usually under
graduates because "graduates
have so much work."
In his letter, Vaughan set an
applic aion deadline of Oct. 2 for
senators interested in the post.
Any full-time student is eligible
to apply for the paying position.
In an unusual first meeting this
Thursday, the Senate will be
forced to elect a new chair.
Vaughan's statement is a re
statement of the provision in the
ASSU by-laws which mandates
that the Senate fills positions
after "special elections as are re
quired to fill vacant regular
seats."
While ASSU members have
vacated their positions before, no
one at the top of the hierarchy
has abandoned the spot in recent
years, according to Grant Winfrey,
a fifth-year senior who partici
pated in the ASSU for three years.
