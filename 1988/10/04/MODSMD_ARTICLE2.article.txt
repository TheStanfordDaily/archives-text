# ASSU Senate Chair to resign
## Vaughan's surprise departure will leave post up for grabs 
### Eric Young Senior Staff writer 
ASSU Senate Chair Richard Vaughan
yesterday confirmed that he will resign
from his post this Thursday â€” following
the Senate's first meeting of the quarter.
Vaughan, a graduate student in computer
science, admitted that he did not believe
he could make an adequate time commit
ment to the job. Vaughan added that he
was "tired" and wanted to take a break
from his studies.
Currently looking for a job, Vaughan will
leave Stanford in January.
Vaughan's initial announcement came in
a letter, dated Sept. 30, sent to all senators.
The one-page letter did not state his
reasons for stepping down.
Of the 41 senators, several said they
learned of Vaughan's plan to resign during
an ASSU retreat this past weekend.
Senator Pearl Chen said she was sur

prised by Vaughan's announcement and
was unsure of his reasons for resigning.
However, she and several other senators
speculated that Vaughan's decision was
based on his commitment to his Ph.D. re
search.
Senator Bob Griffin said the move "did
not come as a big surprise." According to
Griffin, the senate chair "bounced the idea
(of resigning) off some people he knew"
last week.
Saying that she was "disappointed" by
his decision, Senator Millie Gong noted
that Vaughan's resignation "changes the
perspective" of the Senate during a time
when ASSU was trying to work toward
the cohesiveness.
According to Vaughan's letter, his job
does not necessarily go to the second in
command, Deputy Chair Aimee Allison.
As it now stands, the job is up for grabs.
