## Singing Kabuki in the classroom East Asian scholar adds spice to dorm duties and academic antics 
### Kathy Lachenauer Editorial staff 
With his five-month-old
daughter wiggling in his arms,
Prof. Tom Hare manages to brew
a hot pot of jasmine tea.
Sipping steaming hot tea as he
speaks, Hare looks comfortably at
home in his apartment at EAST
House — Stanford's East Asian
academic theme house.
Hare has a knack for making
difficult tasks look simple —
whether he's performing his
daddy duties or teaching Japanese
poetry to undergraduates.
Typically clad in a button-down
shirt, khaki pants and docksiders,
Hare, 36, could pass for a preppy
undergraduate rather than a

Stanford professor aspiring for
tenure this year.
An up-and-coming scholar in
Japanese cultural history, Hare
is one of few Americans who can
recite the traditional verses of
Japanese drama. And in 1986,
Stanford University Press pub
lished Hare's book on traditional
"No" theatre — a Japanese art
form rich in stylized acting and
elaborate costumes.
The first indepth analysis of No
theatre written in a Western lan
guage, Hare's book "Zeami's
Style" demonstrated his potential
as a leading scholar in East Asian

studies.
But even intellectuals have time
for fun and games and Hare's
lighthearted side comes shining
through in the classroom. Treat
ing students to in-class impromtu
dramatic performances, Hare will
suddenly shout and sing out lines
from Kabuki plays.
During more contemplative
times, he might light up some
incense, bang on a gong and ask
students to chant a Buddhist med
itation verse with him.
This year, Hare is diving into
deep waters with graduate stu
dents, guiding them through a
seminar in No drama. He is also
getting back to the basics with
undergraduates, offering them an
introductory course in East Asian
culture.
The course, which Hare calls
"a nice compliment" to his more
abstruse research work, touches
on some of the fundamentals of
Japanese art, history and music.
Hare's first inkling to study the
Far East originated in his high
school days while he was taking
some classes offered by a Meth
odist church.
"Through my catechism I
learned about sushi, karate and
calligraphy," explains Hare. As an
undergraduate at Princeton Uni
versity, Hare managed to take a
year off to study in Tokyo. Al
though he says he "never envi
sioned" himself as a Californian,
Hare says the offer to come teach
at Stanford was too good to
refuse.
"It took about five minutes to
get used to California," Hare says.
As the resident fellows at EAST,
he and his wife, Anne Hare, are
busy trying to build what they
describe as a "homey atmosphere"
for the house's 63 residents.
Hare leads some of the house's
weekly seminars which range
from discussions on East Asian
economic policies to modern films
about Japanese culture. But there
is plenty of clowning-around time
as well.

In honor of last week's first
house meeting, the couple pulled
on flood pants, Hawaiian shirts
and baseball caps, hoping to con
vince the residents that they were
tacky tourists bound for East
Asia.
Describing the Hares as "mel
low" and "a bunch of fun," senior
Kalar Lau, a second-year resident
at EAST, says the couple fits right
in with the student residents.
A mish-mash of belongings
have helped the Hares turn the
typically sterile-looking rooms of
University housing into a cheery

RF apartment.
With Japanese paintings
gracing the walls, a four-foot-long
loom in the the living room and
a substantial collection of CDs (in
cluding Tracy Chapman), their
RF apartment is alive and colorful.
"I'm a student really at home
in the '60s culture," Hare admits.
But as the father of a two-year-old
son and a baby daughter, the
Japanese scholar could just as
likely be a character in the tele
vision show "Thirtysomething."
"[The children] keep us busy,"
he says.
