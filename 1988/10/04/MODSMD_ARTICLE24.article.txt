# The 						Bug's debut: Myths of Miss America and nougat
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
First, I'd like to introduce
myself. Bug is the name,
mixing fact with fatuity is the
game. Foremost, you oughta
know that I'm your closest
friend. If you've got a problem,
come to me. Of course, I don't
have time for just any old prob
lem, so please limit your
solicitations of my wise advice
to matters significant to three
out of four Americans.

trusty rule to follow is to
keep your boring personal life
out of it. Ask me the pressing
question few are brave enough
to bear the ridicule of having
asked.
Queries can be written on
any surface with any imple
ment and left just about
anywhere. Should you desire
that your question be an
swered, it is recommended by
the American Dental Associa
tion that you drop it off in the
"Hug Me" bin at the offices of
the Stanford Daily or send it

via the Lots letter service care
of Bug-me. And remember, the
next insect you crush may be
me, your closest friend.
Illegibility of writing and
anonymity of authorship are
applauded. Etching questions
on the otherwise untainted sur
face of a fresh tub of Country
Crock Spread is also encour
aged. Further, the Bug chal
lenges his readers to be as
grammatically absurd as he.
The Bug does not guarantee
that your question will even be
read in the second place, much
less published. That any ques
tion will be answered in a con
cise fashion is a foolish notion
indeed.
Dear Bug,
Who is Gretchen Elizabeth
Carlson? Is she or her family
liable for the severe mental
damages suffered by myself
and other Stanfordians due to
the shock and embarrassment
which is a natural human re
action to watching someone
from an institution you attend
and are otherwise proud of
wear a bathing suit and high
heels on national television?
— Jackson Pollack
Ever since Ms. Carlson of
Anoka, Minnesota, and more
recently Stanford University,
graced an Atlantic City stage
and television screens around
the world as Miss America
1989 late this summer, rumors
have abounded about the clas
sical violinist/beauty queen.
The Bug will presently dispel
some and create others.
Truth — Carlson will have
to complete her schooling after
a year-long tour of the country,
promoting such Pageant sup
porters as Fruit-of-the-Loom.
Truth — She's a senior who
stopped out last year to prepare


BUG ME
for the Pageant. She is a sociology
msyor.
Fiction — When the the cere
monies were held up for a good
15 minutes while the judges had
to break up a tie in the results,
the Pageant's winner was being
determined.
Truth — The tie being broken
was between the second- and
third- place finisher. Carslon had
already wrapped up the title.
Fiction — Carlson entered the
Pageant to salvage her self-respect
after being cut in the first round
of LSJUMB Dollie tryouts.
Fiction — Carlson was disqual
ified from the 1988 Pageant due
to steroid use.
Truth — That's a stupid rumor
because strength is not a factor
in the Miss America competition.
Truth — Carlson will be this
year's Commencement Speaker.
Dear Bug,
What is nougat ?
— Leon Trotsky

To simpletons like you, Leon,
nougat is probably most notorious
for being one of those edibles, like
chicken fajitas, which seem to be
named after some kind of un
speakable disease or bodily excre
tion. As a matter of fact, nougat
is a central character in the drama
we call life.
For years, the Creation vs.
Evolution argument has raged in
debate halls around the world.
Yes, an examination of the
M&M/Mars line of candy bars pro
vides ample evidence for the
Evolutionists. However, the exis
tence of such nifty entities as choc
olate, caramel and nougat unde
niably proves that there is a god.
Just ask any dentist.
Your question concerns only
nougat, if I understand it correct
ly. According to my high school
nurse, Miss Ratched, nougat is
one of the four basic candy
groups, along with chocolate,
caramel and partially
hydrogenated vegetable oil.
Nougat first appeared in the
primitive Three Musketeers bar
and has been fit enough to survive
each of the basic candy bar
progressions; i.e., from the Three

Musketeers, to the Milky Way, to
the Mars bar, and finally, to the
Homo sapiens of candy, the Snick
ers.
For further, if less sublime, in
formation on nougat, the Bug con
sulted not M&M/Mars, but Fanny
May Candies. The question being
of such obvious importance, the
Bug was transferred to the office
of Fanny May President, Dick
Peritz. It seems that nougat is
not only one of the basic candy
confections, but also one of the
most diverse. Any coloring or
flavoring can be added to the
original pasty-textured concoc
tion. President Peritz said he had
"no idea" how many different
types of nougat have been created.
For those of you keeping score,
sugar, corn syrup, cream and egg
whites are the central ingredients
of your typical nougat. Fanny
May's most popular kind o'
nougat is English Walnut.
At one point, President Peritz
dreamily uttered, "the things that
you can add are only limited to
your imagination."
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
