# The
						Bug's debut: Myths of Miss America and nougat
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
First, I'd like to introduce
myself. Bug is the name,
mixing fact with fatuity is the
game. Foremost, you oughta
know that I'm your closest
friend. If you've got a problem,
come to me. Of course, I don't
have time for just any old prob
lem, so please limit your
solicitations of my wise advice
to matters significant to three
out of four Americans.

trusty rule to follow is to
keep your boring personal life
out of it. Ask me the pressing
question few are brave enough
to bear the ridicule of having
asked.
Queries can be written on
any surface with any imple
ment and left just about
anywhere. Should you desire
that your question be an
swered, it is recommended by
the American Dental Associa
tion that you drop it off in the
"Hug Me" bin at the offices of
the Stanford Daily or send it

via the Lots letter service care
of Bug-me. And remember, the
next insect you crush may be
me, your closest friend.
Illegibility of writing and
anonymity of authorship are
applauded. Etching questions
on the otherwise untainted sur
face of a fresh tub of Country
Crock Spread is also encour
aged. Further, the Bug chal
lenges his readers to be as
grammatically absurd as he.
The Bug does not guarantee
that your question will even be
read in the second place, much
less published. That any ques
tion will be answered in a con
cise fashion is a foolish notion
indeed.
Dear Bug,
Who is Gretchen Elizabeth
Carlson? Is she or her family
liable for the severe mental
damages suffered by myself
and other Stanfordians due to
the shock and embarrassment
which is a natural human re
action to watching someone
from an institution you attend
and are otherwise proud of
wear a bathing suit and high
heels on national television?
— Jackson Pollack
Ever since Ms. Carlson of
Anoka, Minnesota, and more
recently Stanford University,
graced an Atlantic City stage
and television screens around
the world as Miss America
1989 late this summer, rumors
have abounded about the clas
sical violinist/beauty queen.
The Bug will presently dispel
some and create others.
Truth — Carlson will have
to complete her schooling after
a year-long tour of the country,
promoting such Pageant sup
porters as Fruit-of-the-Loom.
Truth — She's a senior who
stopped out last year to prepare
