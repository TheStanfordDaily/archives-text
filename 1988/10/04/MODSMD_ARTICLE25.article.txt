## Soccer takes two in Rhode Island 
### John Kirks 
Over the weekend, the Stan
ford women's soccer team ran
its string of impressive
showings on the road to three
games. Following its strong
outing in a 1-0 loss to Connec
ticut on Thursday, Stanford
pieced together two straight
shutout wins, 2-0 over Provi
dence College on Friday and
3-0 in Sunday's match against
Rhode Island.

On Friday, the Cardinal,
drained from the confrontation
with UConn, got off to a very
slow start. Providence, a much
weaker squad that checked into
Friday's match with a lack
luster record of 1-6-1, played
the Cardinal even for the first
three-fourths of the game.
The game was still a score
less tie as the teams entered
the final twenty minutes of
regulation. Jarred by the pos
sibility of their second overtime
game in a 24-hour span, Stan
ford started to pick up the in
tensity level. "The girls really
caught fire toward the end of
regulation," observed Stanford
Coach Berhane Andeberhan.
Neither team scored in those
final twenty minutes, but the
momentum that began to sway
in the Cardinal's favor accom
panied them into the overtime

period. The Friar defense
began to deteriorate immedi
ately.
Sophomore Lisa Sime finally
broke loose seven minutes into
the first overtime period. She
beat Providence goaltender
Beth Sweezey on an unassisted
goal, breaking the Cardinal's
two-game scoring drought.
Shortly thereafter, the Sime
show continued as she hit
Carolyn Denney for Stanford's
second score.
Stanford's exercise in let
hargy on Friday certainly was
not duplicated against Rhode
Island on Sunday. The Cardinal
dominated from the opening
whistle against the Rams.
Stanford's first and most im
pressive goal was scored by
Beth Egan on an assist from
Denise Denney. Denney de
scribed the play's development:
"The play built up nicely on
the right side. There were
seven or eight crisp passes
made before I touched the ball.
I just crossed it to Beth, who
was angling in from the left
side."
After the first goal, the
game's pattern did not alter.
The Cardinal continued to test
Ram goaltender Jane Mac-
Caull, who made 16 saves, and
Stanford's continual pressure
paid off on two more occasions.
Jenny Bloomer scrapped right
in front of the Ram goal for a
loose ball, gained possession,
and knocked in an unassisted
goal. Fullback Ann Pusch
rounded out the Cardinal box
score with a goal from the left
wing, assisted by Bloomer.
