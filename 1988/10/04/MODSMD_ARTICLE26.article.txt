# Quarterback controversy returns
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Recalling memories of last
season's controversy, Stanford
football Coach Jack Elway an
nounced yesterday that he is not
yet sure who will start at quar
terback when the Cardinal takes
the field against San Jose State
Saturday.
Junior Brian Johnson, starter
of Stan ford'B last 11 games, was
pulled at halftime of Saturday's
contest at Notre Dame (a 42-14
loss) and was replaced by redshirt
freshman Jason Palumbis.
Palumbis then completed 16-of
-23 passes for 158 yards to lead
the Cardinal on one 73-yard
scoring drive and another close
miss. When asked after the game
who would start, Elway was non
committal.
"We might as well break the
monotony of this losing," he said,
"and add a quarterback contro
versy to it."
Little had changed at yester
day's press conference. "We'll wait
on that," Elway said when asked
to name a starter. "That isn't al
ways a cut-and-dried type
thing. . . . The key thing for the
quarterback . . . (is) there are
times when you should get it 100
percent of the time — I shouldn't
say that, maybe 99 percent of the
time — and that hasn't been hap
pening."
The Cardinal offense has been
unable to come up with the big
play over the last two games,
throwing three interceptions at
very inopportune times and fum
bling once Saturday. The fumble
was the biggest heartbreaker of
all — Stanford's defense had held
the Fighting Irish out of the end
zone after Notre Dame had
second-and-goal from the one, but

Headed for the pine?
Though Coach Jack Elway hasn't made a final decision, starting quarterback Brian Johnson may be
replaced this week by Jason Palumbis. The redshirt freshman looked impressive in relieving Johnson
at Notre Dame Saturday.
on the Cardinal's first offensive
play, the snap was fumbled, the
Irish recovered on the one, and
scored on the next play.
Elway's situation is slightly
more settled than it was at this
point last year, at least. The Car
dinal had lost its first four games
and Elway was choosing between
Johnson, senior Greg Ennis and
Scott Stark (who transferred to
Saddleback JC over the summer).
Johnson won the job then and led
the team to a 5-2 finish last year.
Johnson may not fare so well
this year. While both players will
split the repetitions at practice
this week, as they have done all
season, Elway thinks Palumbis
has a slight edge.
"If we were going to play to
morrow, I'd go with Jason," El
way said.
"You make some mistakes on
offense," he said. "This has always
got to be countered by big
plays. . .. We haven't had those.
"Brian is an outstanding com
petitor and a good athlete. ... He
has improved and he's got a
strong enough arm. .. . He's im
proved on his accuracy, but that
is always something ... (anyone)
needs to work on. This is an area
that will improve in time."
Elway also had many good
things to say about Palumbis.
"Jason doesn't have the mobility
that say Johnson has," he began,
"doesn't have as strong an arm
as Johnson has; but he is more
accurate and goes to the right
receiver more often. ... I'll guar
antee you one thing: I will an
nounce the starter before we kick
off."
As one positive note from last
week, Elway felt the offensive line
did a good job protecting the pas
ser against Notre Dame and is
continuing to improve. Offensive

tackle Andy Papathanassiou con
curred. "The momentum was
there," he said. "The pass protec
tion, I'd say, was there. ... To
me it seemed like it was there.
That's all we can do."
The line will need to have it
together again this Saturday
against the Spartans' 46 defense.
Made famous in the mid-'Bos by
the Chicago Bears, the 46 is a
pressure defense designed to give
the quarterback no time to throw.
Papathanassiou feels his unit
will be ready no matter who is at
the helm. "They (Johnson and
Palumbis) are both good," he said.
"Whichever plays is fine with me."
Elway has to make another
choice this week, as well. After
Saturday's 24.5-yard-average
punting performance, Elway has
decided to abandon the punting
by-committee he has used the last
two games.
"We're going to decide on our
punter (this week)," he said, "and
probably go the rest of the way
with him." Elway's choices are
sophomore John Hopkins, also the
team's placekicking and kickoff
specialist, and senior wide
receiver/punter Jeff Blaisdell.
Hopkins has kicked eight times
for a 33.6-yard average, including
four downed within the oppon
ent's 20-yard line, while Blaisdell
has kicked 12 times for a 30.9
average. Blaisdell has had one
punt downed inside the 20.
Card notes
Stanford junior Jon Volpe ran for
67 yards on 17 carries at Notre Dame
and is currently ranked 20th in the
nation in rushing with 97.8 yards per
game.
Sophomore slotback Charlie Young
leads the team with 19 receptions this
year, good for 241 yards. Senior Henry
Green, the starter in place of the in
jured Ed McCaffrey (still out with a
deep thigh bruise) is second on the
squad with 186 yards receiving and
his 16.9 yards-per-catch average is
tops on the team.
