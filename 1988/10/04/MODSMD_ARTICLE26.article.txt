# Quarterback controversy returns
## 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Recalling memories of last
season's controversy, Stanford
football Coach Jack Elway an
nounced yesterday that he is not
yet sure who will start at quar
terback when the Cardinal takes
the field against San Jose State
Saturday.
Junior Brian Johnson, starter
of Stan ford'B last 11 games, was
pulled at halftime of Saturday's
contest at Notre Dame (a 42-14
loss) and was replaced by redshirt
freshman Jason Palumbis.
Palumbis then completed 16-of
-23 passes for 158 yards to lead
the Cardinal on one 73-yard
scoring drive and another close
miss. When asked after the game
who would start, Elway was non
committal.
"We might as well break the
monotony of this losing," he said,
"and add a quarterback contro
versy to it."
Little had changed at yester
day's press conference. "We'll wait
on that," Elway said when asked
to name a starter. "That isn't al
ways a cut-and-dried type
thing. . . . The key thing for the
quarterback . . . (is) there are
times when you should get it 100
percent of the time — I shouldn't
say that, maybe 99 percent of the
time — and that hasn't been hap
pening."
The Cardinal offense has been
unable to come up with the big
play over the last two games,
throwing three interceptions at
very inopportune times and fum
bling once Saturday. The fumble
was the biggest heartbreaker of
all — Stanford's defense had held
the Fighting Irish out of the end
zone after Notre Dame had
second-and-goal from the one, but

Headed for the pine?
Though Coach Jack Elway hasn't made a final decision, starting quarterback Brian Johnson may be
replaced this week by Jason Palumbis. The redshirt freshman looked impressive in relieving Johnson
at Notre Dame Saturday.
