# Athletes should compete for themselves, not their countries
## 
### 
SEOUL, South Korea (Oct. 1) — Hope
fully, by the time you read this, I will
be back on the Farm, having forsaken,
for the time being, the title of "Ugly
American."
No one ever intends to pick up that
label. But a fundamental aspect of the
Olympics — affiliating competing ath
letes with their homelands — encourages
that kind of tension between Americans
and other countries, in fact between all
countries in general.
This isn't because of the problem of
nations attaching their political gripes to
the sporting arena. The 1988 Olympics
were attended by a record 160 nations,
and even arch-rival North Korea has
realized that a terrorist attack during
the earth's biggest sporting event is not
the sprinter's route to worldwide
popularity.
What's scary about having athletes di
rectly represent their countries, as when
Carl Lewis wins a gold for the United
States or Ben Johnson loses one for
Canada, is the emotions many countries'
citizens place on the competitors'
performances.
Now, 1 haven't interviewed representa
tives from countries such as Burkina

Faso, which may be bubbling inside just
to know that America's intrepid high
school scholars are hearing its country
exists, even if only during the opening
ceremonies.
And there's got to be a national reverie
in Suriname, whose Anthony Nesty
snatched a gold medal away from Matt
Biondi of the United States.
But when a nation identifies with its
athletes, it often leads to misunderstand
ings, jealousy and even hatred between
the people of those nations.
Olympic boxing has been the most ex
treme example of this problem. Now
maybe decisions shouldn't be based on
extremes, but what's of concern here is

the latent danger of nations competing
against each other through their athletes.
On Sept. 22, a melee broke out in the
ring after a decision went against Korean
bantamweight Byun Jung-11 in favor of
Bulgarian Alexander Hristov. Among
other things, NBC videotape showed a
venue employee, a Mr. Yoon, attacking
the New Zealand referee, Keith Walker,
though Yoon later said he was only trying
to break up the fight.
Repercussions of that incident contin
ued for the rest of the Olympics. The
New Zealand embassy in Seoul was
phoned thousands of times by angry
Koreans, some of whom were reportedly
breaking off business deals with New
Zealanders over the incident.
Korean employees cheered raucously
with fans during the Todd Foster- Chun-
Jin Chul light-welterweight rematch, but
when two NBC employees did the same,
a venue employee pulled their hands
apart and told them to stop.
Yoon was back at ringside at the very
next session after Byun's infamous sit-in
protest.
This left one nagging, very-much-in
the-back-of-the-head thought as the
Olympics went on. If there ever were a

dangerous situation, Americans could not
count on being protected. We could only
assume and hope that security would do
their job.

North Korea has realized
that a terrorist attack dur
ing the earth's biggest
sporting event is not the
sprinter's route to world
wide popularity.

That was actually a pretty safe assump
tion, since Seoul's Olympic organizing
committee, desperately concerned about
making a good impression, is embar
rassed about the melee of the 22nd. But
the fact that there is that amount of
danger leads me to this question.
Isn't it enough to have the world's
greatest amateur (?) athletes, in 26 dif
ferent sports, gathered together in one
place, that we could live without grouping
those athletes with their native nations?

Now, I love rooting for Americans to
do well, but I also want to see Americans
do well when individual sports have their
world championships, where athletes are
competing for themselves, not specifically
their countries, and citizens don't take
it as a national disgrace when their
countrymen lose.
Eliminating national affiliations would
also make it easier to root for great com
petitors from other countries. Take this
example: In baseball, I hate the Giants,
but I really admire . . . well, no one.
I hate the Yankees, but I really admire
Don Mattingly and Dave Winfield. It
would be nice if they weren't members
of the Yankees so I could root more for
them to do well.
Now, it's relatively harmless to hate
the Yankees; maybe that leads one to
find some (I said some) of their fans
obnoxious, but little else. But it's some
thing else to think about when you read
a Korean political science professor, Ahn
Byon Joon, in the wake of the Olympic
Games, say the following.
"Maybe Korea used to be an exception,
but now I think anti-Americanism will
be a part of life here."

dangerous situation, Americans could not
count on being protected. We could only
assume and hope that security would do
their job.

North Korea has realized
that a terrorist attack dur
ing the earth's biggest
sporting event is not the
sprinter's route to world
wide popularity.

That was actually a pretty safe assump
tion, since Seoul's Olympic organizing
committee, desperately concerned about
making a good impression, is embar
rassed about the melee of the 22nd. But
the fact that there is that amount of
danger leads me to this question.
Isn't it enough to have the world's
greatest amateur (?) athletes, in 26 dif
ferent sports, gathered together in one
place, that we could live without grouping
those athletes with their native nations?

Now, I love rooting for Americans to
do well, but I also want to see Americans
do well when individual sports have their
world championships, where athletes are
competing for themselves, not specifically
their countries, and citizens don't take
it as a national disgrace when their
countrymen lose.
Eliminating national affiliations would
also make it easier to root for great com
petitors from other countries. Take this
example: In baseball, I hate the Giants,
but I really admire . . . well, no one.
I hate the Yankees, but I really admire
Don Mattingly and Dave Winfield. It
would be nice if they weren't members
of the Yankees so I could root more for
them to do well.
Now, it's relatively harmless to hate
the Yankees; maybe that leads one to
find some (I said some) of their fans
obnoxious, but little else. But it's some
thing else to think about when you read
a Korean political science professor, Ahn
Byon Joon, in the wake of the Olympic
Games, say the following.
"Maybe Korea used to be an exception,
but now I think anti-Americanism will
be a part of life here."

SEOUL, South Korea (Oct. 1) — Hope
fully, by the time you read this, I will
be back on the Farm, having forsaken,
for the time being, the title of "Ugly
American."
No one ever intends to pick up that
label. But a fundamental aspect of the
Olympics — affiliating competing ath
letes with their homelands — encourages
that kind of tension between Americans
and other countries, in fact between all
countries in general.
This isn't because of the problem of
nations attaching their political gripes to
the sporting arena. The 1988 Olympics
were attended by a record 160 nations,
and even arch-rival North Korea has
realized that a terrorist attack during
the earth's biggest sporting event is not
the sprinter's route to worldwide
popularity.
What's scary about having athletes di
rectly represent their countries, as when
Carl Lewis wins a gold for the United
States or Ben Johnson loses one for
Canada, is the emotions many countries'
citizens place on the competitors'
performances.
Now, 1 haven't interviewed representa
tives from countries such as Burkina

Faso, which may be bubbling inside just
to know that America's intrepid high
school scholars are hearing its country
exists, even if only during the opening
ceremonies.
And there's got to be a national reverie
in Suriname, whose Anthony Nesty
snatched a gold medal away from Matt
Biondi of the United States.
But when a nation identifies with its
athletes, it often leads to misunderstand
ings, jealousy and even hatred between
the people of those nations.
Olympic boxing has been the most ex
treme example of this problem. Now
maybe decisions shouldn't be based on
extremes, but what's of concern here is

the latent danger of nations competing
against each other through their athletes.
On Sept. 22, a melee broke out in the
ring after a decision went against Korean
bantamweight Byun Jung-11 in favor of
Bulgarian Alexander Hristov. Among
other things, NBC videotape showed a
venue employee, a Mr. Yoon, attacking
the New Zealand referee, Keith Walker,
though Yoon later said he was only trying
to break up the fight.
Repercussions of that incident contin
ued for the rest of the Olympics. The
New Zealand embassy in Seoul was
phoned thousands of times by angry
Koreans, some of whom were reportedly
breaking off business deals with New
Zealanders over the incident.
Korean employees cheered raucously
with fans during the Todd Foster- Chun-
Jin Chul light-welterweight rematch, but
when two NBC employees did the same,
a venue employee pulled their hands
apart and told them to stop.
Yoon was back at ringside at the very
next session after Byun's infamous sit-in
protest.
This left one nagging, very-much-in
the-back-of-the-head thought as the
Olympics went on. If there ever were a

dangerous situation, Americans could not
count on being protected. We could only
assume and hope that security would do
their job.
