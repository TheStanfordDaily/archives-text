# Volleyball set to face scrappy Bears
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
As the Stanford women's vol
leyball team has been discovering
this week, there is truly no rest
for the weary. Fresh off a weekend
homestand against Washington
and Washington State and pre
paring to host the intensely com
petitive Josten's Invitational
Tournament, the Cardinal will
take the Maples Pavilion floor at
7:30 tonight to face a scrappy and
motivated California squad.
Stanford, No. 3 in the nation
and in second place in the Pacific
10 Conference, is currently off to
one of the school's finest starts.
Suffering its only loss to No. 1
UCIJ\, the Cardinal has rolled out
to an 11-1 record overall and 5-1
in the Pac-10.
Across the Bay in Berkeley,
however, the scene is not quite as
bright. One of the rising stars in
collegiate volleyball last year,
Cal's new Coach Dave DeGroot
has seen his team flounder to an
8-7 mark, 1-5 in the Pac-10.
Nonetheless, the Cardinal is
definitely concerned about the
1988 renewal of the Stanford-Cal
rivalry. With wins tallied in two
of its last three outings, including
a stunning five-game upset of pe
rennial power Pacific, the Golden
Bears pose an emotionally
charged threat.
"One thing you can always ex
pect from Cal in a Stanford-Cal
game is that they are going to be
pumped up and ready to go,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said.
"They've got absolutely nothing
to lose and everything to gain

from beating us. That's all you
need to say right there â€” if we're
not ready to play, they're going
to be pumped up and ready."
Cal is led by a trio of strong
returners in setter Holly McPeak
and outside hitters Tiftany Roc
helle and Lisa Arce. In the Bears'
outside-oriented offense, Arce and
Rochelle receive half of McPeak's
total sets.
"McPeak, Rochelle and Arce are
their primary people," Shaw said.
"Arce is a really good player, Roc
helle is a good outside hitter and
McPeak is a really nice player, a
good athlete and a good all-around
player. She was on the all
freshman team for the Pac-10 last
year."
But, as Cal has discovered,
three players do not make a team.
Plagued by inexperience in other
areas, especially the middle, the
team has been hard-pressed to
stop more balanced teams.
Enter the Cardinal, one of the
best all-around squads in the
NCAA. Devastating in the middle
and potent outside, Stanford is
both deep in talent and effective
in execution.
Bolstering the Cardinal's of
fense is freshman middle blocker
Amy Cooper. A native of Aurora,
111., Cooper has become one of
Stanford's most consistent and
adaptable hitters as well as the
squad's leading blocker, recording
an astounding 12 blocks in the
two matches this past weekend.
"Amy Cooper has really shown
some improvement in the past
week or two," Shaw observed.

"She's starting to get the idea of
some things we've been trying to
get her to do."
One of these lessons has been
in some of the trickier middle hit
ting plays that the Cardinal
routinely employs. Cooper has
rapidly adjusted to the various
behind-the-setter plays made fa
mous by fellow Illinoian and
recent Stanford graduate Nancy
Reno, and routinely smashes
down quick sets with authority.
Also on the rise is senior Amy
Hayes, an outside hitter who took
the team by storm with her deadly
serve and swift line shots in her
freshman year and is doing the
same her senior season. Starting
opposite freshman phenom Kris
tin Klein, Hayes is proving herself
a valuable member of the strong
Cardinal outside hitting corps.'
Coming off the bench and re
peatedly making an impact is
freshman middle blocker Nicole
Appleman, who saw extensive ac
tion against Washington and
Washington State. "In the mo
ments that she's been in games,
at critical moments," Shaw said,
"she's done a lot for us."
Grace under pressure has been
the hallmark of Stanford play, es
pecially in the tense four-game
match against Washington that
was finally resolved with a 17-15
fourth-game decision. With this
type of trial by fire, as well as a
host of players putting in steady
and excellent performances, the
Cardinal should be able to handle
any Cal pressure. A characteris
tically scrappy team that seeks to
outdig its opponents, the Bears

have added improved blocking to
their repertoire to pose a tough
defensive obstacle should Stanford
grow lackadaisical.
"I would hope that we learned
our lesson from Washington, in
that we cannot allow another
team to outhustle us at any point
and time during the game and let
the other team seize the momen
tum," Shaw said. "Washington
did that a bit in the second game
(which the Huskies won 15-11).
"Hopefully we've learned that
there are some good teams out
there, and if they are given the
opportunity we are capable of
losing to any of those teams. What
we have to do is go out there and
seize control, be in charge our
selves and not be outhustled."
Card notes
Stanford's tough home schedule
continues this weekend when the Car
dinal seeks to defend its Josten's In
vitational title against a field of top
flight competitors. Coming to the
Farm are local rival Santa Clara (who
will face the host team in Friday's 6
p.m. match), defending NCAA cham
pion Hawaii and this season's sleeper
success story Texas-Arlington.
Should Stanford and Hawaii ad
vance to Saturday night's champion
ship match, it would be a rematch of
the 1987 NCAA Championship that
forced Stanford to settle for second
place, as well as the first meeting this
year between the No. 2 and No. 3
teams in the nation. With key gradua
tions from both of these squads, this
clash of volleyball titans is definitely
a wide-open hallgame.
