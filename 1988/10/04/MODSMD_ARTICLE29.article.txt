# Golf in third place
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
The Stanford men's golf team
has started the season on the
right foot. After 27 holes of play,
the Cardinal has attained the
lofty status of third place at the
Wolfpack Invitational in South
Lake Tahoe.
In the past, the fall season did
not mean much to collegiate golf,
but as golf's worldwide
popularity grows, so does the col
legiate golf season. Thus, it is
crucial for the squad to play well
in the fall to achieve a favorable
NCAA ranking, because the
rankings will be used to deter
mine berths in the NCAA cham
pionships in the spring.
Only the host, Nevada-Reno,
and last year's Western Athletic
Conference champion Utah, are
ahead of Stanford with scores of
445 and 447, respectively. Com
ing in after the Cardinal's 449
were Oregon State's 450, Cali
fornia's 455 and Fresno State's
456.
As was the case last season,
the Cardinal linksters were
bunched closely together. Brad
Joondeph stood at three under
par at one point in the day. He
wound up as the Cardinal's low
scorer, with 111 strokes on 27
holes. The junior was followed
by Don Christensen and Brad
Geer, who both shot 112, and
Mark Funseth and John Mahon,
who carded 115 and 119, respec
tively.
According to Stanford Coach
Wally Goodwin, Joondeph and
Christensen's hard work over
the summer has paid off. Both
golfers, who are natives of
Seattle, spent long hours on the
course over the summer to hone
their competitive skills. Chris
tensen traveled to Hot Springs,
Virginia to compete in the U.S.
Amateur Championship, while
Joondeph competed in the pres
tigious Western Amateur.
"It's nice to see the guys play

so well [this early in the season].
But they deserve it. They worked
hard over the summer," Good
win remarked.
The coach emphasized the dif
ficulty of the par-71 Edgewood
Country Club course. It was set
up extremely long, at 6,900
yards, and according to Good
win, is in "immaculate condi
tion."

It is crucial for the
squad to play well in
the fall to achieve a
favorable NCAA
ranking.

But while the course is chal
lenging, the field is not. Beyond
Reno, Utah and Fresno State,
no teams that made national
headlines are competing in the
invitational. "It's not all that
powerful a field," Goodwin said.
This week's play will, however,
give the Cardinal a good look at
some of its competition in the
Pacific 10 Conference, with Cal,
Oregon State, Oregon and Wash
ington State all in the field.
Notably absent in South Lake
Tahoe are defending Pac-10
champion Washington,
perenially top-ranked Arizona
(which boasts the current Na
tional Amateur Champion, Eric
Meeks, among its alumni), Ari
zona State, and UCLA. The Car
dinal with have to beat these
teams if it is to be among the
upper echelons of the Pac-10.
Goodwin said that he and the
team were "a little confused" by
the tourney's 27-hole-a-day for
mat, which causes the players
to finish late, and the scores to
be unusual. While the golfers
play 27 holes, only their first 18
count in the score until the first
nine holes of the second day is
played, upon which time it is

combined with the last nine
holes of the first day. Perplexed?
So is the Cardinal.
One benefit of playing golf on
the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe
is the potential to win a little
extra greens-fee money away
from the course at one of South
Lake Tahoe's many casinos.
If the temptation to gamble

and the tournament's strange
format are the only problems
that Goodwin and his linksters
encounter, Stanford could pick
up right where it left off last
season (with a strong fourth
place finish in the Pac-10 Cham
pionship), and finally get some
respect for the men's golf pro
gram.

after the first 27 holes of the Wolfpack Invitational. Joondeph's
111 was the low score for the Cardinal.
The Stanford men's golf team
has started the season on the
right foot. After 27 holes of play,
the Cardinal has attained the
lofty status of third place at the
Wolfpack Invitational in South
Lake Tahoe.
In the past, the fall season did
not mean much to collegiate golf,
but as golf's worldwide
popularity grows, so does the col
legiate golf season. Thus, it is
crucial for the squad to play well
in the fall to achieve a favorable
NCAA ranking, because the
rankings will be used to deter
mine berths in the NCAA cham
pionships in the spring.
Only the host, Nevada-Reno,
and last year's Western Athletic
Conference champion Utah, are
ahead of Stanford with scores of
445 and 447, respectively. Com
ing in after the Cardinal's 449
were Oregon State's 450, Cali
fornia's 455 and Fresno State's
456.
As was the case last season,
the Cardinal linksters were
bunched closely together. Brad
Joondeph stood at three under
par at one point in the day. He
wound up as the Cardinal's low
scorer, with 111 strokes on 27
holes. The junior was followed
by Don Christensen and Brad
Geer, who both shot 112, and
Mark Funseth and John Mahon,
who carded 115 and 119, respec
tively.
According to Stanford Coach
Wally Goodwin, Joondeph and
Christensen's hard work over
the summer has paid off. Both
golfers, who are natives of
Seattle, spent long hours on the
course over the summer to hone
their competitive skills. Chris
tensen traveled to Hot Springs,
Virginia to compete in the U.S.
Amateur Championship, while
Joondeph competed in the pres
tigious Western Amateur.
"It's nice to see the guys play

so well [this early in the season].
But they deserve it. They worked
hard over the summer," Good
win remarked.
The coach emphasized the dif
ficulty of the par-71 Edgewood
Country Club course. It was set
up extremely long, at 6,900
yards, and according to Good
win, is in "immaculate condi
tion."

It is crucial for the
squad to play well in
the fall to achieve a
favorable NCAA
ranking.

But while the course is chal
lenging, the field is not. Beyond
Reno, Utah and Fresno State,
no teams that made national
headlines are competing in the
invitational. "It's not all that
powerful a field," Goodwin said.
This week's play will, however,
give the Cardinal a good look at
some of its competition in the
Pacific 10 Conference, with Cal,
Oregon State, Oregon and Wash
ington State all in the field.
Notably absent in South Lake
Tahoe are defending Pac-10
champion Washington,
perenially top-ranked Arizona
(which boasts the current Na
tional Amateur Champion, Eric
Meeks, among its alumni), Ari
zona State, and UCLA. The Car
dinal with have to beat these
teams if it is to be among the
upper echelons of the Pac-10.
Goodwin said that he and the
team were "a little confused" by
the tourney's 27-hole-a-day for
mat, which causes the players
to finish late, and the scores to
be unusual. While the golfers
play 27 holes, only their first 18
count in the score until the first
nine holes of the second day is
played, upon which time it is

combined with the last nine
holes of the first day. Perplexed?
So is the Cardinal.
One benefit of playing golf on
the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe
is the potential to win a little
extra greens-fee money away
from the course at one of South
Lake Tahoe's many casinos.
If the temptation to gamble

and the tournament's strange
format are the only problems
that Goodwin and his linksters
encounter, Stanford could pick
up right where it left off last
season (with a strong fourth
place finish in the Pac-10 Cham
pionship), and finally get some
respect for the men's golf pro
gram.
