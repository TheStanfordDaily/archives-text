# Cable Co-op at fault for delay
## Billing questions will scramble campus reception for months 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
The president of Cable Co-op said yes
terday that the delay in bringing cable
television service to campus is due to
his company's failure to provide a spe
cific proposal to the University.
"The ball is in our court and frankly
I don't know when we're going to have
the document ready," said John Kelley,
president of Cable Co-op, in a telephone
interview with The Daily yesterday.
Current negotiations between the
University and Cable Co-op are grinding
to a halt because both sides are "too
busy" to deal adequately with the issues
involved, according to Julia Fremon,
program manager of Real Estate and
Lands Management.
Students probably won't have access
to cable television for months after the
University and Cable Co-op agree on
the billing terms, according to Fremon.
When asked why his company was
taking so long in providing a contract,

Kelley responded, "the fact that it's a
university makes it a little more difficult
to deal with." He did not elaborate on
the details of the proposal.
Kelley emphasized that "It's in our
interest to get this thing resolved as
quickly as possible because we would
like to provide the service to Stanford
students."
"We're waiting to hear from them,"
said Fremon.
"When we hear what Cable Co-op
would like to do, then all the Stanford
people have to talk about it," said
Fremon, suggesting that forums and
Residential Education committees could
debate at length over which residences
get cable first and which get it last.
"It's not that people have slowed
down. It's that people haven't sped up,"
said Fremon, who has been involved the
effort to bring cable to Stanford for
years.
Steps to bring cable to Stanford began
in earnest in January, when Pacific Bell
began installing trunk cables on

campus. A few months later, according
to Fremon, Cable Co-op approached
University officials to discuss servicing
student residences.
Several meetings later, the two sides
still have not worked out most of the
"complicated" issues involved, according
to Keith Guy, director of Housing Man
agement.
Unanswered questions include how to
figure the bills. Cable Co-op could bill
the students on a room-to-room or a
dorm-to-dorm basis.
Guy expressed frustration over Cable
Co-op's delays in presenting a plan.
"Frankly, Cable Co-op is pushing very
hard to get their service to students
and they have not yet come forward
with a comprehensive plan to bring serv
ice to all students," Guy said.
The slow pace of negotiations can also
be attributed to the multiple number
of University people involved. "There
is not a clear decision path right now,"
