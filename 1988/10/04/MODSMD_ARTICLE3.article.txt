# Cable Co-op at fault for delay
## Billing questions will scramble campus reception for months 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
The president of Cable Co-op said yes
terday that the delay in bringing cable
television service to campus is due to
his company's failure to provide a spe
cific proposal to the University.
"The ball is in our court and frankly
I don't know when we're going to have
the document ready," said John Kelley,
president of Cable Co-op, in a telephone
interview with The Daily yesterday.
Current negotiations between the
University and Cable Co-op are grinding
to a halt because both sides are "too
busy" to deal adequately with the issues
involved, according to Julia Fremon,
program manager of Real Estate and
Lands Management.
Students probably won't have access
to cable television for months after the
University and Cable Co-op agree on
the billing terms, according to Fremon.
When asked why his company was
taking so long in providing a contract,

Kelley responded, "the fact that it's a
university makes it a little more difficult
to deal with." He did not elaborate on
the details of the proposal.
Kelley emphasized that "It's in our
interest to get this thing resolved as
quickly as possible because we would
like to provide the service to Stanford
students."
"We're waiting to hear from them,"
said Fremon.
"When we hear what Cable Co-op
would like to do, then all the Stanford
people have to talk about it," said
Fremon, suggesting that forums and
Residential Education committees could
debate at length over which residences
get cable first and which get it last.
"It's not that people have slowed
down. It's that people haven't sped up,"
said Fremon, who has been involved the
effort to bring cable to Stanford for
years.
Steps to bring cable to Stanford began
in earnest in January, when Pacific Bell
began installing trunk cables on

campus. A few months later, according
to Fremon, Cable Co-op approached
University officials to discuss servicing
student residences.
Several meetings later, the two sides
still have not worked out most of the
"complicated" issues involved, according
to Keith Guy, director of Housing Man
agement.
Unanswered questions include how to
figure the bills. Cable Co-op could bill
the students on a room-to-room or a
dorm-to-dorm basis.
Guy expressed frustration over Cable
Co-op's delays in presenting a plan.
"Frankly, Cable Co-op is pushing very
hard to get their service to students
and they have not yet come forward
with a comprehensive plan to bring serv
ice to all students," Guy said.
The slow pace of negotiations can also
be attributed to the multiple number
of University people involved. "There
is not a clear decision path right now,"
Guy said.
The process is further slowed
down because University officials
still have not decided whether
they should be involved in the
implementation of the cable serv
ice, Guy said.
When Cable Co-op finally
devises a comprehensive proposal
to come on campus, then Guy and
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Norm Robinson will present it to
an early meeting of the Housing
Operations Advisory Committee,
Guy said.
"Before that, we're not going
to do anything," Guy said.
Members of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fraternity discovered this
University immobility on Sept. 24
when they had arranged inde
pendently with Cable Co-op to
have the service installed that day.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon treasurer
D.D. Harris waited for the Cable
Co-op representative to install
cable service so that the SAE's
could get their MTV within hours.
But when Cable Co-op repre
sentative Tim Loomas arrived, he
handed back the fraternity's $140
initial check. The University said
it would not yet allow cable tele
vision in campus residences.
"It was wrong on our part to
go ahead without checking with
the University first," Harris said.
"But the representative was con-

vinced that there wouldn't be a
problem."
Guv said that "it was not ap
propriate" for Cable Co-op to ad
vertise their services to the SAE
and other Row Houses without
consulting University officials
first.
"We have to be in control of
any installations made in our
buildings and Cable Co-op knows
that. They had no business in
going directly to (the SAEs)," Guy
said.
Peter Fechheimer, the general
manager of the Palo Alto office
of Cable Co-op said yesterday that
"a mistake had been made" when
the SAE house received a flyer
advertising Cable Co-op services
during the summer.
According to Fechheimer, Cable
Co-op representatives were in
structed to do business only with
off-campus houses.
The University wants to delay
cable service on campus in order
to ensure "that Stern Hall gets
the same services that SAE gets,"
Fremon said.
