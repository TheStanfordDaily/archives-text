Stanford's Centennial fund
raising campaign, hopes to con
tinue involving alumni in the
effort, said Susan Wolfe, assistant
Centennial director.
Consequently, the committee
has planned a multitude of
alumni-oriented events for this
year.
On Oct. 15, the community will
pay tribute to the accomplish
ments of black students and fac
ulty by opening "Ujamaa
Archives."
In November, the Department
of Spanish and Portuguese will

nismo."
At another November confer

Henry Levin, whose model for an
accelerated school has been imple
mented in a Redwood City and a
San Francisco school, will report

In its third year of celebration,
the Centennial Committee has
surpassed its $600 million
fundraising goal for its six-year
long birthday bash.
"(This figure! is looking good,"
said David Fulton, director of
communications at the Office of
Development. Based on a straight
line projection of the $1.1 billion
needed by 1991, the $600 million
"is slightly more than expected,"
Fulton said.
Officially launched in February,
1987, the Centennial campaign til
ready had $300 million in funding
when the drive started. Over the
past two years, donations were
slightly higher than were ex
pected, Fulton said.
Although the fundraising effort
is ahead of schedule, the Centen

conference will also center on
methods for assisting disadvan
taged children obtain grade-level
proficiency.
In January, the Centennial com
mittee will further try to involve
Stanford alumni by releasing the
documentary "Keepers of the
Dream" — a video that demon
strates how individuals can best
use material sources in speeches
and media presentations.
While last year marked the

100 th anniversary of the laying
of Stanford's first cornerstone,
the 1990-91 academic year will
honor the University's 100 th
graduating class. Secretary of
State George Shultz and former
University President Richard
Lyman will take leading organi
zational roles in the celebration.
Activities will include three
symposiums on international top
ics, an augmented version of
Freshman Orientation and a spe
cial Commencement ceremony for

the 100 th graduating class. High
lighting that year's Centennial
Celebration will be a congress of
world leaders who Shultz plans
to invite.
The Centennial Committee is
also responsible for supporting
musical groups. In November,
1987 the committee, under the
Statistics Prof. Gerald Lieberman,
approved financing for the Stan
ford Symphony Orchestra. The
money the Centennial Committee
contributed enabled students in
the orchestra to tour Japan,
Taiwan and Korea this past year.
This year the Centennial is
sponsoring the Stanford String

musicians will travel to Washing
ton, New York, Boston, Chicago
