# Engineering students form support groups
## 
### Caitlin Liu 
In response to a health survey
taken last spring by the Cowell
Student Health Center, a new sup
port program providing psycholog
ical services for graduate engi
neering students will begin early
next week.
Currently, Counseling and Psy
chological Services facilitates
various support groups for stu
dents in the Business School, Law
School and the School of Medicine
â€” but not the School of Engineer
ing.
However, at a meeting held late
last week, a student committee
finalized plans for implementing
support groups for graduate en
gineers.
The program will consist of five
support groups for Ph.D. students,
black graduate students, new
graduate students, women,
spouses and "significant others."
Last spring's survey, conducted
by Cowell, found that although
10 percent of all graduate students
here utilize CAPS only one in 20
engineering students ever seek its
services, explained A 1 Cooper, a
psychologist at CAPS.
Cooper speculated that lack of
participation on the part of en

gineers indicates that a significant
percentage of them need help but
are too hesitant to ask for it.
Former Dean of Academic Af
fairs Robert Eustis stressed Stan
ford's commitment to providing
graduate engineers with more
than just a technical background.
"The School of Engineering is con
cerned with more than just the
technical education of the stu
dents. We want to make sure our
students optimize their experience
here at Stanford," said Eustis, a
coordinator for the new engineer
ing support groups.
"The goal (of the program 1 is
to try to reduce the stress and
other external effects of how stu
dents do their work," Eustis said.
Stressing how competitive the
technical field is, Cooper said it
is essential for engineers to have
support resources. "The pressure
is tremendous," he said.
In the past, engineering stu
dents who sought help at CAPS
generally had two problems in
common: extreme levels of stress
and feelings of isolation, according
to Cooper.
CAPS Psychiatrist Mari Yam
hor noted that engineers see
themselves as public problem
solvers who often believe that they
must be self-sufficient and cannot
turn to others for help.
"They are expected to be inde
pendent and self-sufficient at all
times. This is why we are reaching
out to the students rather than
waiting for them to come to us,"
explained Yambor, another proj
ect coordinator.
The program was developed
over the summer under the guid
ance of Eustis.
Funded jointly by the School of
Engineering and CAPS, each of
the support groups will be
facilitated by a professional ther
apist. For now, the enrollment will
be limited to eight to 10 persons
for each support group.
"The reason they're small is be
cause in larger groups, individual
needs cannot be met," Yambor
explained. Additional support
groups will be created if there
seems to be more demand for
them, she said.
