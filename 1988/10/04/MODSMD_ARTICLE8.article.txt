# Minority programs get a boost
## Grant prompts eight new projects to improve 'academic pipeline 
### Soeun Park 
With the aid of a $2 million
grant, the Univeristy has imple
mented eight new programs en
couraging minority students to
pursue academic careers.
A total of 14 programs will
share the grant from the James
Irvine Foundation and aid in ac
ademic support, recruitment and
faculty development. Many are po
tential models for other academic
institutions in California.
The programs are the outcome
of extended research by educators,
the Irvine Foundation Board of
Trustees and its President Dennis
Collins. The Irvine Advisory Com
mittee targeted the need for un
dergraduate mentoring by faculty,
pre-collegiate teaching and faculty
development of minorities.
"The research suggests to us
that there is a major crisis
looming on the horizon in not
having qualified and credentialed
academics who are minorities in
the pipeline. We're concerned
with the need to have more blacks
and Latinos in positions of lead
ership, in academic institutions,
in classrooms, the lab and in re
search," Collins said.
"There is a tremendous disjunc

tion between the population of mi
nority students at the turn of the
century and the availability in the
way of representation of these
communities in the teaching
core," Collins said.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow agreed. "There is
a pressing need for more minor
ities in the teaching profession
and part of the reason why there
are so few is because so few are
coming out of graduate schools.
The Irvine Foundation grant is
directed at addressing the prob
lem of the shortage of teachers in
secondary schools as well as in
higher education."
According to Cecilia Burciaga,
associate dean of Graduate
Studies and coordinator of the
Stanford-Irvine grant, Irvine
Foundation officials committed to
the programs here because they
want "models to see what works
and why."
Once the effectiveness of Stan
ford's programs are verified, then
they "can go to other colleges in
California, like Pomona, Occiden
tal or Santa Cruz, and then show
them this model. Stanford is a
testing ground to show California
what is possible," Burciaga ex
plained.

The new programs include:
• The Undergraduate Scholars
Program.
One of the first mentoring pro
grams at Stanford, the USP has
been in existence for three years.
Sixty students have already had
research experience with faculty
mentors and this year 30 students
are expected to participate in the
program.
"The Irvine Foundation will
help us to expand. It's a good
grant. It allows for creative initi
ative in running our program and
for autonomy," said Assoc. His
tory Prof. Kennell Jackson, direc
tor of the Afro-American Studies
Program.
The money will go toward con
tinuing support for student re
search, bringing speakers to
campus and publishing a student
research journal titled "Sterling."
Jackson says the USP is a model
which is "simple and very inti
mate" and that there "can be a
USP at the University of Chicago,
Howard University or UCLA."
• American Indian Summer In
stitute Program
Stanford's first "bridge" pro
gram of its kind, this summer
program provided 12 American
Indian students with academic
preparation and support. The
students, who were entering Stan
ford for the first time, were
tutored in math, science and writ
ing.
In addition, the students were
also able to develop an "incredi
ble" sense of community and com
mitment between the Institute's
largely American Indian staff and
other students, according to Greg
Sarris co-director and doctoral
student.
• Stanford Summer Introduc
tion to Research Program
This already existing Stanford
program was able to expand its
minority participation with Irvine
funds. The program for this sum
mer began last June with 19 stu
dents, 10 of whom were funded
by grant money.
These students engaged in di
rected individual research or as
sisted in faculty research projects.
According to Noe Lozano, director
of the program and associate dean
of graduate studies, the purpose
of the program is to produce the
"next generation of minority
scholars."
•Senior Tutor Program, Mi
nority Student Outreach and
Tutor Development
Starting this year, the Center

for Teaching and Learning, will
start a new program intended to
increase minority peer tutoring by
training selected students as
"senior tutors." Senior tutors will
train other tutors, and form study
groups and dorm programs.
According to Heather Gordon,
assistant director at the CTL, the
Center applied for the grant be
cause they were concerned with
having a "diverse" tutoring staff.
• The Stanford Center for
Chicano Research Graduate and
Undergraduate Mentoring Pro
gram
The purpose of this program is
to engage undergraduates and
graduates in research experiences
while being mentored by faculty
in their respective areas of exper
tise. Undergraduates are expected
to carry out summer research
projects that lead to senior honors
papers while graduates are en
couraged to explore dissertation
topics and mentor younger stu
dents.
The year-long program is in
tended to provide a structured and
supportive environment to allow
students to conduct research in
the Chicano community. Accord
ing to Armando Valdez, associate
director for the Center for Chicano
Research the Irvine Foundation,
money has helped to expand and

strengthen the program.
• The Stanford Teacher Educa
tion Program
The receipt of funds from the
Irvine Foundation enabled STEP
to name seven students from the
regular STEP program in the
School of Education as foundation
fellows. Foundation funds also
support a special six week pro
gram called the Irvine Foundation
Summer Program in which par
ticipants are able to gain a multi
cultural perspective to teaching.
The coordinators of STEP are
"hoping to increase the numbers
of outstanding minorities in the
teaching profession," according to
Joyce Burton, administrator for
the Irvine Fellows Program.
Rounding out the remaining
foundation fueled programs are
the Chicano Fellows Program, the
Copula in U.S. Vernacular Black
English and Creole English, the
Graduate Program for Aspiring
Law Teachers at Stanford Law
School, the Irvine Dissertation
Fellowship Program, Field and
Summer Research in Latin
America, the Galarza prize for Ex -
cellence in Chicano Research, the
Physics Department Recruitment
and Retention Program, and the
Martin Luther King Papers Proj
