# Minority programs get a boost
## Grant prompts eight new projects to improve 'academic pipeline 
### Soeun Park 
With the aid of a $2 million
grant, the Univeristy has imple
mented eight new programs en
couraging minority students to
pursue academic careers.
A total of 14 programs will
share the grant from the James
Irvine Foundation and aid in ac
ademic support, recruitment and
faculty development. Many are po
tential models for other academic
institutions in California.
The programs are the outcome
of extended research by educators,
the Irvine Foundation Board of
Trustees and its President Dennis
Collins. The Irvine Advisory Com
mittee targeted the need for un
dergraduate mentoring by faculty,
pre-collegiate teaching and faculty
development of minorities.
"The research suggests to us
that there is a major crisis
looming on the horizon in not
having qualified and credentialed
academics who are minorities in
the pipeline. We're concerned
with the need to have more blacks
and Latinos in positions of lead
ership, in academic institutions,
in classrooms, the lab and in re
search," Collins said.
"There is a tremendous disjunc

tion between the population of mi
nority students at the turn of the
century and the availability in the
way of representation of these
communities in the teaching
core," Collins said.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
Thomas Wasow agreed. "There is
a pressing need for more minor
ities in the teaching profession
and part of the reason why there
are so few is because so few are
coming out of graduate schools.
The Irvine Foundation grant is
directed at addressing the prob
lem of the shortage of teachers in
secondary schools as well as in
higher education."
According to Cecilia Burciaga,
associate dean of Graduate
Studies and coordinator of the
Stanford-Irvine grant, Irvine
Foundation officials committed to
the programs here because they
want "models to see what works
and why."
Once the effectiveness of Stan
ford's programs are verified, then
they "can go to other colleges in
California, like Pomona, Occiden
tal or Santa Cruz, and then show
them this model. Stanford is a
testing ground to show California
what is possible," Burciaga ex
plained.

The new programs include:
• The Undergraduate Scholars
Program.
One of the first mentoring pro
grams at Stanford, the USP has
been in existence for three years.
Sixty students have already had
research experience with faculty
mentors and this year 30 students
are expected to participate in the
program.
"The Irvine Foundation will
help us to expand. It's a good
grant. It allows for creative initi
ative in running our program and
for autonomy," said Assoc. His
tory Prof. Kennell Jackson, direc
tor of the Afro-American Studies
Program.
The money will go toward con
tinuing support for student re
search, bringing speakers to
campus and publishing a student
research journal titled "Sterling."
Jackson says the USP is a model
which is "simple and very inti
mate" and that there "can be a
USP at the University of Chicago,
Howard University or UCLA."

stitute Program
Stanford's first "bridge" pro
gram of its kind, this summer
program provided 12 American
