EDWARDS AIR FORCE
BASE, Calif. (AP) - The
shuttle Discovery returned to
a star-spangled welcome from
more than 400,000 people yes
terday after a post-Challenger
shakedown mission that NASA
called "an absolutely stunning
success."
"Discovery, welcome back,"
Mission Control told com
mander Frederick Hauck as he
guided the ship to a picture
perfect landing after a four
day, 1.6-million mile mission.
"A great ending to the new be
ginning" of the manned space
program.
The national anthem was
playing as the white ship, with
its stubby Delta-shaped wings,
leveled out and rolled to a
smooth stop on the center line
painted on the hard-packed

sand of this desert air base. It
was precisely on time, at 9:37
a.m. PDT.
They were met by their wives
here and flew home with them
later in the day to their train
ing base in Houston, to an en
thusiastic reception by about
4,000 Johnson Space Center
area residents, city officials and
fellow astronauts.
The Discovery crew arrived
at Ellington Field in Houston
in a carnival atmosphere com
plete with flags, marching
bands and bright television
lights.
The astronauts and their
wives stepped off the aircraft
onto a red carpet and walked
between an honor guard of flag
carrying Rangerettes from
Friends wood High School.
