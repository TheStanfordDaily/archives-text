With its 422 step memory and 193
functions—including linear regression,
standard deviation and computer
math—the fx-7000G lets you perform
computer functions, without acquiring
computer knowledge or incurring
computer costs.
For additional capa
bilities, there's the
fx-7500G ($109.95). It
has a larger memory
capacity, with 195
functions, 4,006 mem
ory steps, instant graph
enlargement or reduction
feature, plus a convenient
horizontal folding format.
If you need even more power,
our fx-8000G ($119.95) techs you
even higher, with 1,446 memory
steps and 225 functions. And when
hooked up with our optional FA-80
interface, it works with most parallel
dot matrix printers or plotters in
cluding Casio's own models.
If you have any doubts as to
who's the leader in high-tech calcu
lators, just pick up an fx-7000G,
fx-7500G or fx-8000G and draw
your own conclusions.
