If you don't, your address and phone number from last
year will be in the Student Directory. If you are a new
student, no number will appear at all.

If you've lost your form, don't worry. The Information
Window has extras. You don't have to stand in line to
pick up or turn in a form. Life's too short to stand in
line. Just be sure to turn in your phone number in time.
Please
note:
This is the first year your
residence and room number will
appear in the Stanford Directory.
It's now public information. If you
want this or any other information
suppressed, turn in a privacy
request by this Friday, October
7. If you do nothing, your
residence and room number will
appear.
