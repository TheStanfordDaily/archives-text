# Problems with contractors slow Lomita Mall job

An inaccurate geological survey and a delay in
the delivery of supplies have caused the Lomita
Mall construction project to be extended for another
four months, according to University Facilities Proj
ect Manager John Kennedy.
The construction has been a major inconvenience
to pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers and University
staff in the neighboring buildings.
I he goal of the $4.7 million project, located be
tween the west side of the Quad and the Physics
Tank, is to install new utility lines.
According to Irene Miller, an assistant at the
Office of Planning and Management, the delay is
"typical of most projects. [They] never run as
smoothly as expected." She said she does not expect
a significant rise in costs due to the delay.
After looking at the 15-to-20-year-old survey of
soil conditions, Elmore Pipe Jacking, the contracting
company, arrived at the construction site this sum
mer with equipment and designs that were ill-suited
for the current soil type.
The University did not conduct a new survey
because such surveys are very expensive and the
University already had a lot of information on the
land, Kennedy said. In addition, Kennedy said that
the problem is not unusual, as such soil surveys
are not foolproof. With redesigned plans and new
equipment, the work is now well underway, he
added.
However, when Pacific Underground Construc
tion was late in delivering construction supplies,
materials expected at the site in July arrived in
early August, and some still have not been received.
Pacific Underground officials could not be reached
for comment.
Although not pleased with the delay, Kennedy
said supply delays are not uncommon.
AJthough the University intended to have the
project completed by the end of summer, the delays
have forced Stanford to extend the deadline to mid-
December.
From the complaints he has received, Kennedy
said the students have been quite flexible in working
around the problem. The entire region along the
west side of the Quad has been blocked off to protect
people from the heavy equipment at the site. The
project does include two paths to accommodate
pedestrian and bicycle traffic across the Mall. One
connects the Quad to the Physics Tank, and the
other is a pedestrian path to the Varian Physics
building.
However, Mary Cloutier, an administrative assis
tant at the School of Engineering, said the work is
"excessively noisy" and complained about "the
nauseating diesel fumes."
The sound reduction equipment they have set up
is quite ineffective, Cloutier said, adding that she
is even less understanding about the inconsiderate
