# Stanford begins bone mineral study
## Random sample of young women tested for benefits of exercise 
### Nadine Weil 
Strengthening bones through
exercise is a Stanford
physiologist's latest experiment to
battle old age.
A regular program of weight
training and running should
create bones strong enough to
withstand the effects of os
teoporosis, according to Christine
Harter, a Ph.D. in exercise phys
iology and head of the study that
begins today. Osteroporosis, a con
dition of low bone density, in
creases the risk of bone fracture
in post-menopausal women.
"The questions I hope to answer
are what type and how much ex
ercise is needed to strengthen
bone mineral," Harter said of the
project, which is funded by a grant
from the National Institutes of
Health.
What makes this study unique
is that researchers have concen
trated on a 100-percent random
sample of young women. Also, this
is the first experiment of its kind
to require its participants to keep
a daily record of all physical and
mechanical activity, including
walking, standing and lifting.
"It is in this way that we can
keep track of all outside influences
on bone density," explained
Harter.
At the study's conclusion, the
women's bone density will mea
sured to determine which exercise
group had the greatest increase
in bone mineral. Harter's goal is
to generalize her findings and "to

A regular program of weight-training
and running should create bones strong
enough to withstand the effects of
osteoporosis

eventually use exercise as a pre
scription for osteroporosis."
A similar study done last year,
which showed that regular exer
cise increases bone mineral con
tent, provides the basis for this
year's experiment.
One in every four women over
the age of 60 experiences a bone
fracture due to osteroporosis, ac
cording to Harter. Equally
frightening is that post
menapausal women loose five to
eight percent of their bone
mineral content each year, she
added.
At the start of the experiment,
the 50 participants will have the
bone density of their hips, spines
and wrists measured through a
technique called dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry, which gives a
precise calculation of bone density
with a very low exposure to ra
diation.
The participants will then be
randomly divided into one of three
groups: One group will run on a
regular basis; the second will keep
up a regular weight-training pro
gram; the third is a control group
that will do neither.

Communications Prof. Donald
Roberts, who must frequently
compose random samples while
conducting research, said
predisposition toward exercise
will not affect the results of the
study as long as exercisers and
non-exercisers both have the same
chance of being placed into any
of the three groups.
Once the groups are formed,
the running group will begin its
supervised workouts on Tuesday
and Thursday afternoons. Their
goal will be running three to five
miles, three times a week by Jan
uary.
If any students are interested
in participating in the running
study, they can attend the infor
mation meetings in Aspen Room,
second floor of Tresidder on either
Oct. 5, 4 to 5 p.m. or Oct. 6, noon
to 1 or 4 to 5 p.m.
The weightlifting group will
also start its regime of full-body
workouts using weight machines
and free weights, training every
Tuesday and Thursday from 8:30
to 10 p.m. This group's target is
to reach 85 percent of one repe
tition maximum within five
months.
