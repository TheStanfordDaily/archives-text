## Bush unveils 'YES' program Wants kids from the suburbs to volunteer in ghetto 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -
George Bugh yesterday proposed crea
tion of a federally supported foundation
to encourage America's youth to volun
teer their help for the less fortunate.
"1 want our affluent to help our poor,"
the Republican presidential candidate
said in a speech unveiling his proposal
for a YES to America Foundation. "1
want the young men and women of our
tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or
the subway, or the metro, and go into
the cities where the want is."
Bush blended his proposal with a dose
of the liberal-bashing rhetoric that
marks his campaign for the White
House. He predicted that his critics
would sneer that "a national voluntary
effort just won't be as good as a new
multi-billion dollar program."
Bush outlined his proposal for a
Youth in Service to America Foundation
as he worked to cement support in
northern California, a region that ad

visers say is up for grabs in the White
House campaign.
Bush's Sacramento speech marked an
effort to flesh out his campaign call for
a "kinder, gentler nation" and also com
bat the Democrats' portrayal of him as
an uncaring member of the upper class.
He said some kids have "$4O jeans
and $50 sneakers" while others live
"lives of utter desolation in the poorest
neighborhoods." One group should help
the other, he said, expressing the hope
that "the work itself, the labor of love
is the reward."
Bush said that a quarter century of
massive federal spending programs has
demonstrated that "we can't buy our
way out" of the problem.
Bush said he would serve as chairman
of his proposed a Youth in Service to
America Foundation.
An aide to Bush, Deborah Steelman,
said the vice president envisioned a $ 100

million annual federal contribution for
the program. She said the foundation
would set broad guidelines for commu
nity activities but local leaders would
have discretion in the types of programs
they set up. She said some activities
could involve payment.
Bush said current volunteer programs
that work well could be expanded and
others could be created. He suggested
that some participants would travel to
the inner city ghettos to read to children
there.
"Some of the poor don't speak English
and can't fill out forms for their children
to go to school. Some women need help
and advice on what to do about a re
peatedly abusive husband. They don't
know that there are private organiza
tions that can help," he said.
"Government, we must finally admit,
isn't the answer," Bush said. "And it
isn't enough to say, 'I'm a Republican
and life is imperfect.'"
