# Honduras asks UN to help oust Contras

UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Honduras, which has been a
key U.S. ally in Central
America, asked the U.N. yes
terday to set up an interna
tional peace force to evacuate
U.S.-backed Nicaraguan and
leftist Salvadoran rebels from
Honduran territory.
In a speech delivered to the
General Assembly, Foreign
Minister Carlos Lopez Con
treras of Honduras recom
mended that U.N. Secretary-
General Javier Perez de Cuellar
oversee creation of a peace
force comprised of troops from
Canada, Spain and West Ger
many.
The force's duties would in
clude relocating Honduran
based, Nicaraguan rebels,
known as Contras, and Salva
doran rebels to Costa Rica and
and then

resettle them elsewhere, Lopez
Contreras said.
He said the force would
"guarantee the non-use" of
Honduran territory by foreign
armed insurgencies.
Lopez Contreras under
scored his apparent disassocia
tion from U.S. policy by de
scribing the United States,
along with the Soviet Union,
as a "hegemonistic power" —
one with a policy or practice
of aggressively expanding its
influence over other countries.
The number of Contras in
Honduras has increased sub
stantially this year as fighting
in Nicaragua has subsided.
Leftist rebels from El Sal
vador, who have been trying to
oust the U.S.-supported gov
ernment there since 1980, have
made far less use of Honduran
territory.
