# IRA bomb kills 1
## Victim accused of prison torture 
### 
BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) â€” A prison
officer accused of mistreating IRA guerrillas was
killed yesterday by an IRA bomb that blew up his
car as he was driving through Belfast, police said.
The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility,
naming the victim as Brian Armour.
Officials speaking on condition of anonymity con
firmed the identification and said Armour was vice
chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, a pro
fessional organization. They said he was employed
at the Maze, a prison outside Belfast where dozens
of IRA guerrillas are held.
The IRA, in a statement circulated to Belfast
media, accused Armour of playing "a central role
in organizing and carrying out the systematic tor
ture and brutalization of hundreds of Republican
prisoners" during a period of Maze prison unrest
that ended in the death of 10 inmates in hunger
strikes in 1981.
It claimed that in recent weeks, he advocated
harsh treatment of IRA inmates at the Maze and
the Crumlin Road jail in Belfast.
The statement said IRA members planted a two
pound charge of plastic explosives on his car. When
it failed to explode, they added a second charge of
over one pound, which detonated as he drove
through predominantly Protestant east Belfast, the
IRA said.
