# Iran says Bush aide secretly worked for hostage releases

### 
PARIS (AP) â€” Former President Abol
hassan Bani-Sadr of Iran said yesterday
that an aide to Vice President George Bush
conducted secret hostage release negotia
tions with Iran and that a new channel
for U.S.-Iranian links has been opened up.
A campaign spokeswoman for Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, termed
Bani-Sadr's remarks "absolutely false."
Bani-Sadr said that according to his in
formation, a man named Richard Lawless
negotiated the release of Mithileshwar
Singh, an Indian professor and a legal res
ident of the United States who was freed
Monday in Beirut, Lebanon.
"It seems he (Lawless) has denied it,"
Bani-Sadr told The Associated Press. "I
am trying to verify it."
White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said in Washington: "There is a

fellow named Lawless. He is over there.
What he's up to, nobody knows. But he
doesn't represent the United States. He
does not represent the vice president or
the president or anybody else."
But Bani-Sadr said the old channel for
contacts between the United States and
Iran no longer works and a new one has
just been created. He did not elaborate,
but said a new intermediary "has just left
for the United States."
"There has been a delivery of arms to
Iran," he said. "Does that have something
to do with the release? I don't know."
Bani-Sadr said Bush has been dealing
since last February with Hashemi Rafsan
jani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament. He
added that representatives of both Bush
and Democratic presidential noirngqe Mi
chael Dukakis have been in Iranlor talks.
