They even have cable in
New Hampshire, so it
should be here by now

Demand your cable
television now.
Cable should have been
installed in every dorm before the
start of this quarter. Students
should already be enjoying the in
dubitable delights of Music Televi
sion, ESPN and HBO.
Pacific Bell is currently installing
the preliminary hardware neces
sary for cable, but these first ef
forts are futile unless Cable Co-op
and the University negotiate an
installation date.
This week, Cable Co-op president
John Kelley admitted that his com
pany is largely responsible for the
present delay in reaching agree
ment with the University.
Julia Fremon, program manager
of Real Estate and Lands Manage
ment, also admitted that both sides
are "too busy" to devote enough
time to the negotiations.
Meanwhile, students are sitting
in their rooms, struggling fiercely
with antennae, getting the picture
just right, and rising in disgust as
the television picture is again at
tacked by the blizzard that always
sev/ft JtoUI the screen*

Cable Co-op should stop drag
ging its feet. They should draw up
a realistic and comprehensive plan
and submit it to the University.
Cable Co-op should not take ad
vantage of its captive market of
students yearning for cable, figur
ing that whenever cable is finally
installed people will subscribe. The
road to bankruptcy is paved with
good intentions.
The University is also contribu
ting to the snail's pace of the ne
gotiations. Stanford administra
tors have yet to make it clear who
within the monolithic administra
tion has authority in this matter.
One department, and one admin
istrator in particular, must be
made responsible for the negotia
tions, so that an agreement can be
reached speedily. Whoever is in
charge — please assert your au
thority now.
The University should be com
mended for refusing to allow Cable
Co-op to install the cable service
until Co-op guarantees that all
dorms and houses will receive the
same service. The cable company
must not be allowed to install cable
only where it is convenient. The
Stanford cable market is lucrative
enough to guarantee installation
for all students.
All parties involved in this com
plex bureaucratic process must
shift into high speed. Until then,
demand your cahj,e television, uqw.
