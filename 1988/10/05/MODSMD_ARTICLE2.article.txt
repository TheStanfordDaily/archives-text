# USW rallies to gain a new Must contract'
## 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
Calling their noontime demonstration "a
warning sign," more than 60 members of
the United Stanford Workers protested
outside their supervisors' offices yesterday.
The USW members initiated their
protest, held inside the Operations and
Maintenance building off Serra Street, to
let management know how anxious workers
are for a new, just contract, USW Steward
Linda Crouse said.
The USW's contract expired Aug. 31.
And after almost 20 negotiation sessions
with the University, union workers are
still working without a legal contract.
"We don't want to strike but we will if
we have to," shouted one angry worker as
protestors lined the halls outside of Oper
ations and Maintenance Director Ralph Bu
chanan's office.
The workers then walked to Shops Man
ager Rich Stevens's office and chanted out
side his door. Stevens, however, was not
in his office during the protest.
"We want a just contract now," chanted
the noon-time ralliers.
In a USW membership meeting Aug. 31,
the union employees overwhelmingly voted
in favor of authorizing USW management
to call a strike at any time.
In a strategy meeting today at noon,
union members will gather at Dinkelspiel

Auditorium to discuss their next steps in
the negotiating process.
Responding to yesterday's protest, Uni
versity lawyer Michael Vartain stressed
that "the University also wants a just con
tract." Vartain, who is the chief negotiatior
for the University side, added that Univer
sity bargainers are unhappy with the prog
ress of negotiations.
Although the two sides have been bar
gaining since the end of July, they remain
at an impasse on several crucial issues.
For the last two weeks, the University
has asked the union to have a federal
mediator at the negotiating sessions. Ac
cording to Vartain, a mediator could
facilitate the bargaining process.
"The time for neutral help is now, not
later," he said.
Other issues dividing the two sides in
clude job security, wages, employee griev
ance procedures, an employee pension plan
and the employment of non-union mem
bers.
Workers have protested the University's
policy of contracting out union work to
non-union employees and corporations,
particularly at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center. The union is made up of
technical, service and maintenance employ
ees.
The USW has proposed that the Univer
sity make a "serious effort" to avoid con
tracting out such work.
