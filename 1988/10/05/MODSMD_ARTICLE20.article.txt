## Rekeying residences is necessary for student safety 
### 
THE DAILY ARTICLE of Oct. 3
on the subject of the rekeying of
several houses on the Row con
tained errors of interpretation that
concerned us. Contrary to the implica
tions in the article, the decision to
rekey a house is a painstaking process.
It involves verifying and re-verifying
the key inventory (over 1,800 keys);
checking for possible errors in the
records of key returns; examining the
impact of lost keys in terms of the
house's security; reviewing University
policy and liability; and, finally, making
a decision about rekeying the house.
Once those steps are complete, we
must get estimates for each house
from the Lockshop and, based on that
figure, bill the houses for the rekeying.
Inevitably, the actual costs of rekeying
exceed the estimates, but the students
are billed only on the estimate. All of
this is done in about one week, which

means that the June bills must go out
before the actual rekeying work is
completed.
We completely understand that
students are not happy to receive a
rekeying bill. It is not how we would
choose to spend the money, if these
funds were discretionary However, we
have a commitment to, and a responsi
bility for, student safety. When the
security of a house is compromised by
the loss of keys, that fact cannot be
ignored. Even when we know that it
will cause displeasure among the stu
dents involved, even though it is an
unpopular decision, even though we
would prefer not to make it, we cannot
escape our responsibility to do whatever
we can possibly do to ensure student
safety. We do not, as the article indi
cated, feel that the "students' anger
has little basis," but we do insist that
rekeying decisions are made in accord-

ance with sound security practices.
Stanford Housing has a mission: to
ensure that students have a safe, pleas
ant and homelike environment in which
to live. Row Facilities and the Row
Office do their utmost to fulfill this
commitment. We do that in partner
ship with the other housing and food
service departments, the Maintenance
Shops, the Conference Office and the
residents.
Not everything comes together per
fectly and the timing can be skewed by
a number of factors, but the goal is
always to maximize service to students.
We were not able to complete the
rekeying of two houses this summer,
despite the very best efforts of every
one concerned. We do not blame
anyone for this. In fact, we personally
believe that blame is an unhelpful
approach to solving problems. It is not
only unproductive, it is counter-

productive, undermining hard-won and
much-needed cooperation among the
Stanford community.
Personal responsibility is not easily
learned. Community responsibility can
be even more difficult to assimilate,
because it is, in many ways, more
subtle and more comprehensive. Stan
ford in general, and Housing in partic
ular, has made a commitment to
facilitating the assumption of commu
nity responsibility. Our policies reflect
this. We hope that this information
has been helpful. Anyone who has
questions about our rekeying policy or
practice is encouraged to call either the
Row Facilities Office at 723-9266 or
the Row Office at 723-0778.
