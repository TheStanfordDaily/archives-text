# Praise given to the USW members was very well-deserved

I thank the members of the Council
of Presidents for honoring the United
Stanford Workers in a Sept. 26 Orien
tation event. This strong, democratic
organization of over 1,300 working
people is a vital part of the Stanford
community.
USW's struggles began in 1970.
Thirteen workers who opposed the
Vietnam War created the union (then
United Stanford Employees) as an
alternative to the more conservative
Stanford Employees Association. USE
became the official campus union in a
1973 election sanctioned by the Na
tional Labor Relations Board.

Contract negotiations began between
the union and the University. The two
sides could not agree, and in May
1974, the union membership voted to
strike. Weeks of picketing, interfering
with deliveries and blocking construc
tion sites brought the workers a satis
factory contract offer.
Linda Crouse told me that working
conditions were sometimes terrible
before that first contract; that promo
tions and firings were often based on
favoritism, and that some workers' pay
rates made them eligible for welfare.
The contract greatly improved job secu
rity, pay, benefits and freedom of
speech for unionized workers.
These gains have stayed more or less
secure since 1974 as new contracts
have replaced old ones. The only other
year when workers chose to strike for
a satisfactory contract was 1982. But
certain problems remain.

For one thing, many campus workers
are not and cannot be USW members.
Two large groups of non-unionized
workers are (1) about 2,000 clerical
and library workers, and (2) Stanford
Hospital workers (except nurses). For
years USW campaigned with workers
from both groups to get them into the
union. University and Hospital admin
istrators used the carrot of unusually
high pay raises and the stick of in
timidating anti-union literature to dis
courage workers from unionizing. Both
worker groups narrowly voted down
joining the USW in the early 1980s.
For these and other workers, their
lack of union membership leaves them
little protection from the administra
tion.
Some of the conditions that need
improvement are safety on the job
(remember last year's revelations about
asbestos and toxic waste), low retire-

ment benefits (Crouse told me of a
25-year veteran worker who will soon
retire on $300 a month), high medical
insurance rates for workers' dependents
(not so surprising considering that over
twenty percent of Californians have no
medical insurance), and a grievance
procedure that has taken up to two
years to complete.
The hard work and solidarity of
USW members have won them the
benefits they now enjoy. Millions of
working people in the United States
have no such solidarity or benefits â€”
only 17 percent of U.S. workers belong
to a union. As our monstrous economic
system gets worse and the drive for
collective struggle keeps growing again
in the United States, working people
can find inspiration in tough local un
ions like the USW.
