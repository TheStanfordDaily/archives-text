## Choosing to be a parent 
### 
AT THIS YEAR'S Junior Convoca
tion the class of 1990 was once
again reminded of its "coming of
age." We were welcomed to our upper
classmen years and the deeper intellectual
probing that will accompany them.
We were advised to choose majors and
concentrations that we will enjoy delving
into, regardless of how "marketable" our
knowledge may be a few years down the
road.
It was suggested that we view our Stan
ford education not as just a start in the
race to future professionalism and adult
hood, but as an important aspect of our
present life, in and of itself.
All of the above advice I could have
predicted before entering Memorial
Church last Wednesday. One thing I
wouldn't have predicted, however, was
Prof. James March's emphasis, in his
vCpoxocatfqn Address, orf the important
our will play in ouv future
lives. He seemed to remind us, or perhaps
to warn us, not to get so wrapped up in
our education and career goals that we
lose sight of the rewards and happiness
we gain from our interpersonal relation
ships.
He defined himself first as a father
and then as a scholar, and I thank him
for admitting to the full-time role of par
ent that most of us will play some day.
Still, I must question the amount of
"fathering" Prof. March was actually able
to do while attaining his impressive and
commendable professional success. I
wonder if he was able to stay at home
during his children's most formative
years and still become the foremost ex

pert in his field.
I am not questioning his sincerity or
criticizing his academic success, but his
example leads me to a question I often
ask of myself: Is it possible to be a parent
deeply involved in your children's
maturation and upbringing, while still
achieving your own most ambitious pro
fessional dreams? Without wanting to
sound pessimistic, I believe it is not pos
sible.
As a Stanford student I feel an incred
ible pressure both from within myself,
and from those around me, to "aim high"
professionally. I have been given skills
and opportunities I must not waste, and
I search endlessly for the one well
respected career that is best suited for
me.
As a nurturing person and as a woman,
(J know that as a feminist I shouldn't
saytlhis, but 1 feel that this issue touches
women more deeply than men) I have a
desire to spend part of my future at home
raising a family. I know that I can both
raise a family and have a career, as I
have seen countless women do, but I
strongly feel I could never be as profes
sionally successful with children as with
out them. The role of parent just simply
takes too much time.
A choice must be made, and I know
which one I will make. I will sacrifice
some of my career options to have
children, and I will be quite happy doing
so.
So, why do I use the word "sacrifice,"
and why do I feel so "wimpy" about my
choice? Because I live in an era when
women have many educational and job

opportunities unavailable to their own
mothers and grandmothers. Because I
have an obligation to prove how equal
and competent women can be. Because I
go to Stanford University and should not
waste the education, resources, and "open
doors" available to me. Because I am by
nature competitive, and I worry about
slipping behind my peers and classmates
in fame and fortune.
1 am not bitter over the choice I must
make, perhaps because I have spent the
past two summers working with children
and am now sure I want to raise my own
family. I do also plan on having a career,
although I am ready to place it on the
backburner for a while if need be.
Most of us at Stanford are probably
assuming we will somehow be parents as
well as professionals, and most of us will
be both.
But we need to examine the implica
tions and restrictions that parenting and
a career can have on one another, and
I hope that those who choose parenthood
alone can be applauded alongside those
who choose professionalism as well.

choice? Because I live in an era when
women have many educational and job

opportunities unavailable to their own
mothers and grandmothers. Because I
have an obligation to prove how equal
and competent women can be. Because I
go to Stanford University and should not
waste the education, resources, and "open
doors" available to me. Because I am by
nature competitive, and I worry about
slipping behind my peers and classmates
in fame and fortune.
1 am not bitter over the choice I must
make, perhaps because I have spent the
past two summers working with children
and am now sure I want to raise my own
family. I do also plan on having a career,
although I am ready to place it on the
backburner for a while if need be.
Most of us at Stanford are probably
assuming we will somehow be parents as
well as professionals, and most of us will
be both.
But we need to examine the implica
tions and restrictions that parenting and
a career can have on one another, and
I hope that those who choose parenthood
alone can be applauded alongside those
who choose professionalism as well.
