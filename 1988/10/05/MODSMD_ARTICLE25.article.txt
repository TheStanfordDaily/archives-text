## On the real vulnerability of our energy inefficient economy 
### 
THE UNITED STATES ranks
near the bottom of all industria
lized nations in Gross National
Product produced per barrel of oil
consumed. The only less energy effi
cient economies are the terribly ineffi
cient communist economies. Unfortu
nately, we are not even moving in the
right direction. I he economic growth
in the last six years has been based on
the anachronism of cheap energy. It
has energy inefficiency grown into it.
When the price of oil goes back up,
much of our economic activity will
cease to be economically profitable.
The economy will spiral down into
recession. We know this is what will
happen because we experienced oil
price shocks in 1973-74 and 1979-80
and the same thing happened both
times.
In addition to recession, oil price
shocks induce price level inflations that
have proved to be profoundly difficult
and expensive to moderate. Higher oil

prices make goods more expensive to
produce. This causes the price of goods
to rise, which erodes the purchasing
power of wages, which puts pressure
on wages to rise, which again makes
goods more expensive to produce. The
result is a wage price spiral.
On the positive side, the previous oil
shocks had us moving towards energy
efficiency. The transition was painful.
The oil price shocks caused the two
deepest recessions since the great
depression. Inflation was close to
getting out of control. The consump
tion of oil per dollar of GNP fell by
about a third and the tight monetary
policies of Federal Reserve chairman
Paul Volker were even beginning to get
inflation under control.
Then, after all of this difficult prog
ress, the junkie was offered another
fix. Oil prices fell from a high of $35 a
barrel in 1981 to $11 a barrel in 1986.
Instead of stabilizing the price of oil
with an oil tax, President Ronald

Reagan gratefully accepted the fix and
injected it into the veins of the U.S.
economy. Our energy efficiency has
hardly improved since 1983 and oil
consumption per dollar of GNP has
actually risen in the last year.
The Reagan administration likes to
tout the fall in inflation that accompa
nied falling oil prices as a great ac
complishment. In fact, Reagan has
simply bequeathed us an inflation debt
to go along with his trillion plus dol
lars of federal debt. When oil prices
rebound, we will be right back in the
stagflation of the 19705. All our prog
ress in absorbing higher oil prices into
the overall price structure has been
lost, and we will have to go through
the wage price spiral all over again.
In contrast, if oil prices had been
stabilized with an oil tax, we could just
take the tax off when oil prices
rebound and there would be no price
shock at all. Prices would be higher if
we had stabilized oil prices, and we

would have had less economic growth
for the last six years, but the growth
we did have would have been perma
nent and inflation would be behind us
instead of ahead of us.
I have been assuming that oil prices
must rebound. They absolutely must.
OPEC may or may not get its cartel
back together, but if OPEC does not
jack up prices, we had better do it
ourselves through the use of taxes. We
have belatedly recognized the huge
external cost of fossil fuel consump
tion. We must make a transition to
energy efficiency on a scale we have
yet to even consider or see the Earth
become uninhabitable, perhaps within
our own lifetimes.
The intelligent course is to raise oil
prices through taxation and use the
revenues to subsidize the transition to
energy efficiency. If OPEC raises
prices, that will force us to economize
on oil, but our economy will be hit
much harder than if we raise the price

of oil ourselves.
Which of these happens is substan
tially in our hands. OPEC collapsed
when high oil prices caused the West
to conserve, reducing revenues to the
OPEC nations and compelling them to
break their quotas. If we fail to
proceed with conservation, we make it
that much easier for OPEC to get back
in the saddle.
We already missed one boat when we
failed to use taxes to stabilize the price
of oil. If we miss the second boat and
let OPEC get back in the saddle, will
be a sorry ship of fools indeed.
But this is not the worst scenario.
Not by far. The worst is if we don't
tax oil and OPEC still remains in
tatters. This is the doomsday scenario,
where conservation does not take place
at all. The scientists are not talking
geologic time.

Not by far. The worst is if we don't
tax oil and OPEC still remains in
tatters. This is the doomsday scenario,
where conservation does not take place

THE UNITED STATES ranks
near the bottom of all industria
lized nations in Gross National
Product produced per barrel of oil
consumed. The only less energy effi
cient economies are the terribly ineffi
cient communist economies. Unfortu
nately, we are not even moving in the
right direction. I he economic growth
in the last six years has been based on
the anachronism of cheap energy. It
has energy inefficiency grown into it.
When the price of oil goes back up,
much of our economic activity will
cease to be economically profitable.
The economy will spiral down into
recession. We know this is what will
happen because we experienced oil
price shocks in 1973-74 and 1979-80
and the same thing happened both
times.
In addition to recession, oil price
shocks induce price level inflations that
have proved to be profoundly difficult
and expensive to moderate. Higher oil

prices make goods more expensive to
produce. This causes the price of goods
to rise, which erodes the purchasing
power of wages, which puts pressure
on wages to rise, which again makes
goods more expensive to produce. The
result is a wage price spiral.
On the positive side, the previous oil
shocks had us moving towards energy
efficiency. The transition was painful.
The oil price shocks caused the two
deepest recessions since the great
depression. Inflation was close to
getting out of control. The consump
tion of oil per dollar of GNP fell by
about a third and the tight monetary
policies of Federal Reserve chairman
Paul Volker were even beginning to get
inflation under control.
Then, after all of this difficult prog
ress, the junkie was offered another
fix. Oil prices fell from a high of $35 a
barrel in 1981 to $11 a barrel in 1986.
Instead of stabilizing the price of oil
with an oil tax, President Ronald

Reagan gratefully accepted the fix and
injected it into the veins of the U.S.
economy. Our energy efficiency has
hardly improved since 1983 and oil
consumption per dollar of GNP has
actually risen in the last year.
The Reagan administration likes to
tout the fall in inflation that accompa
nied falling oil prices as a great ac
complishment. In fact, Reagan has
simply bequeathed us an inflation debt
to go along with his trillion plus dol
lars of federal debt. When oil prices
rebound, we will be right back in the
stagflation of the 19705. All our prog
ress in absorbing higher oil prices into
the overall price structure has been
lost, and we will have to go through
the wage price spiral all over again.
In contrast, if oil prices had been
stabilized with an oil tax, we could just
take the tax off when oil prices
rebound and there would be no price
shock at all. Prices would be higher if
we had stabilized oil prices, and we

would have had less economic growth
for the last six years, but the growth
we did have would have been perma
nent and inflation would be behind us
instead of ahead of us.
I have been assuming that oil prices
must rebound. They absolutely must.
OPEC may or may not get its cartel
back together, but if OPEC does not
jack up prices, we had better do it
ourselves through the use of taxes. We
have belatedly recognized the huge
external cost of fossil fuel consump
tion. We must make a transition to
energy efficiency on a scale we have
yet to even consider or see the Earth
become uninhabitable, perhaps within
our own lifetimes.
The intelligent course is to raise oil
prices through taxation and use the
revenues to subsidize the transition to
energy efficiency. If OPEC raises
prices, that will force us to economize
on oil, but our economy will be hit
much harder than if we raise the price

of oil ourselves.
Which of these happens is substan
tially in our hands. OPEC collapsed
when high oil prices caused the West
to conserve, reducing revenues to the
OPEC nations and compelling them to
break their quotas. If we fail to
proceed with conservation, we make it
that much easier for OPEC to get back
in the saddle.
We already missed one boat when we
failed to use taxes to stabilize the price
of oil. If we miss the second boat and
let OPEC get back in the saddle, will
be a sorry ship of fools indeed.
But this is not the worst scenario.
Not by far. The worst is if we don't
tax oil and OPEC still remains in
tatters. This is the doomsday scenario,
where conservation does not take place
at all. The scientists are not talking
geologic time.
