## A 						look at Chile today 
### 
Editor'B note: Jonathan Dickstein is a senior
majoring in International Relations, focusing on
lxitin American studies. He recently returned from
three months living in Santiago, Chile. While
there, Dickstein researched Chilean human rights
organizations for an honors thesis he will write
this year.
He studied the role of human rights groups
there, and how they function under a military
dictatorship. He lived with Chileans in a boarding
house for students. Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen played a crucial role, according to Dick
stein, in planning the project, which was not
alligned with another program. Fagen is also
Dickstein's thesis adviser. Dickstein, who has
studied Spanish at Stanford, conducted his re
search in Chile entirely in Spanish.

The parade of students slowly made its way
up the busy downtown Santiago Avenue.
Muffled political slogans blared from a truck;
opposition banners emblazoned the sides of cars.
A transit bus whose driver had taken the day
off to support the fight against Chilean President
Augusto Pinochet moved along the streets.
As they marched, the demonstrators blew
loudly on plastic horns, beat drums and sounded
car horns; occasionally the rhythms of the many
anti-Pinochet chants of the opposition could be

heard: "Va a caer!" (He's going to fall), or "El
pueblo, unido, jamas sea vencido" (The people
united can never be defeated).
The caravan demonstrated opposition to Pres
ident Augusto Pinochet who has ruled Chile since
Sept. 11, 1973, when a military coup overthrew
the democratically-elected government of Presi
dent Salvador Allende.
Pinochet's regime will be challenged today in
a plebiscite election that allows Chileans to vote
for or against the continuation of Pinochet's mil
itary dictatorship.
Suddenly a shout rang out from the front of
the caravan: "Pacos!" (The derogatory name for
the Chilean police). Instantly there was chaos,
people scattering in all directions.
A towering black and white tank-like water
cannon truck blasted the crowd with powerful
jets of water. Glass broke as the force of the
water broke nearby shop windows. People
strained to hear the loud crack of a tear gas
firing or worse. . .
But this skirmish was over in less than a
minute. The police had detained only 10 people
who were held in one of the green, heavily ar
mored police buses that are common sights in
the center of the city.
Protests and clashes between the police and
opposition demonstrators are commonplace in
Chile these days. But this parade was
different. It was legal.
The previous day, early in September,
the regime had lifted its martial law-like
"state of exception" in a largely symbolic
gesture to enhance its image and win
votes for itself in the plebiscite.
Although the demonstration no longer
violated the law, the police were so ac
customed to repressing any public oppo
sition that they didn't realize they were
making a mistake, in arresting the pro
testers, said one participant.
Since 1983, people have been mobiliz
ing and agitating for change, and many
who were paralyzed by fear for 15 years
are now taking to the streets to cement
a Pinochet defeat in the election.
The willingness of Chileans to partic
ipate in the plebiscite is evidenced by the
7.5 million registered voters, representing
over 90 percent of those eligible.

Neither side is predicting a landslide
victory, and conjecture circulates about
how Pinochet would react to a "no" vic
tory or how the left would be able to
defend a victory. The opposition, which
at present includes all anti-Pinochet
forces, hopes for negotiations with the
armed forces or a new constitutional con
vention. But uncertainty pervades.
The Chilean right views the plebiscite
not only as a necessary evil to maintain
the regime's legitimacy but also as an
opportunity to demonstrate to the world
the popular support in Chile for Pinochet
and his policies. They consistently claim
that a Pinochet defeat will mean a return
to the "chaotic" and "violent" days of
Allende's socialist government. Daily TV
commercials depict lines for food and
street violence they associate with the
Popular Unity government.
For the Chilean left, participation in
the plebiscite is only a means to a much
broader end. Many view the plebiscite as
a fraudulent tool of the regime to pacify
the masses and avoid a violent popular
uprising. Nonetheless, they also view the

plebiscite as an opportunity to mobilize
the population into a coordinated resis
tance.
Their slogan is "No hasta veneer!" or
"No until we are victorious." Pins with
this slogan increasingly appear on the
sweaters of people in a society where
connection with the far left formerly
meant extreme personal danger.
The Christian Democrats and other
centrist parties hope to use the plebiscite
as a vehicle for bringing democracy back
to Chile. They hope a majority of "No"
votes will convince those in the military
and high political posts that the Chilean
people demand a democratic system with
a revamped constitution and truly free
elections.
While working to avoid serious
bloodshed, the opposition struggles for a
future of respect for human rights and
more equality of opportunity and condi
tion. The plebiscite results will illustrate
their progress.
Though Chile is currently experiencing
economic growth and a gradual opening
of political posts, it remains polarized

and divided by dualisms. Poverty and
government repression persist.
As the youth of the rich suburbs of
Santiago, Providencia and Las Condes,
talk of skiing and dance to INXS, the
youth of poverty-stricken La Victoria and
La Pincoya trade recipes for "Molotov
cocktails" and play songs of revolution
on second-hand guitars.
The voting process itself is relatively
simple and carefully designed to prevent
outright fraud. There are no lists of can
didates or confusing propositions to
decipher; only two black lines with the
words SI and NO under each one.
The last democratically elected presi
dent, Salvador Allende, won a slight plu
rality of the vote in 1970. His Marxist
Popular Unity government was fraught
with internal divisions and frustrated by
the political and economic chaos allegedly
fostered by the CIA under the Nixon
administration.
A civil war was avoided in September
1973 when the military intervened in a
bloody coup. While many supported a

change toward stability, no one was
prepared for the savagery and bloodiness
of the coup and the dictatorship that
followed.
In 1980, after seven years without a
constitution, the regime drafted a docu
ment calling for a plebiscite to be held
in 1988.
The entire voting-age population is able
to vote for or against the re-election of
General Pinochet for another eight-year
term.
The coup that brought Pinochet to
power in 1973 was extremely violent, in
volving full mobilization of the armed
forces.
The terror did not end with the brutal
coup. As human rights worker Carlos
Cordallffn explained, "the form of repres
sion in Chile is .. . very systematized,
very professional, and very efficient."
For most Chileans, the plebiscite sig
nals a chance to ease the fear and inse
curity they have experienced under the
Pinochet dictatorship, and gives hope for
an end to 15 years of flagrant human
rights abuses and a return to democracy.

customed to repressing any public oppo
sition that they didn't realize they were
making a mistake, in arresting the pro
testers, said one participant.
Since 1983, people have been mobiliz
ing and agitating for change, and many
who were paralyzed by fear for 15 years
are now taking to the streets to cement
a Pinochet defeat in the election.
The willingness of Chileans to partic
ipate in the plebiscite is evidenced by the
7.5 million registered voters, representing
over 90 percent of those eligible.

Neither side is predicting a landslide
victory, and conjecture circulates about
how Pinochet would react to a "no" vic
tory or how the left would be able to
defend a victory. The opposition, which
at present includes all anti-Pinochet
forces, hopes for negotiations with the
armed forces or a new constitutional con
vention. But uncertainty pervades.
The Chilean right views the plebiscite
not only as a necessary evil to maintain
the regime's legitimacy but also as an
opportunity to demonstrate to the world
the popular support in Chile for Pinochet
and his policies. They consistently claim
that a Pinochet defeat will mean a return
to the "chaotic" and "violent" days of
Allende's socialist government. Daily TV
commercials depict lines for food and
street violence they associate with the
Popular Unity government.
For the Chilean left, participation in
the plebiscite is only a means to a much
broader end. Many view the plebiscite as
a fraudulent tool of the regime to pacify
the masses and avoid a violent popular
uprising. Nonetheless, they also view the

plebiscite as an opportunity to mobilize
the population into a coordinated resis
tance.
Their slogan is "No hasta veneer!" or
"No until we are victorious." Pins with
this slogan increasingly appear on the
sweaters of people in a society where
connection with the far left formerly
meant extreme personal danger.
The Christian Democrats and other
centrist parties hope to use the plebiscite
as a vehicle for bringing democracy back
to Chile. They hope a majority of "No"
votes will convince those in the military
and high political posts that the Chilean
people demand a democratic system with
a revamped constitution and truly free
elections.
While working to avoid serious
bloodshed, the opposition struggles for a
future of respect for human rights and
more equality of opportunity and condi
tion. The plebiscite results will illustrate
their progress.
Though Chile is currently experiencing
economic growth and a gradual opening
of political posts, it remains polarized

and divided by dualisms. Poverty and
government repression persist.
As the youth of the rich suburbs of
Santiago, Providencia and Las Condes,
talk of skiing and dance to INXS, the
youth of poverty-stricken La Victoria and
La Pincoya trade recipes for "Molotov
cocktails" and play songs of revolution
on second-hand guitars.
The voting process itself is relatively
simple and carefully designed to prevent
outright fraud. There are no lists of can
didates or confusing propositions to
decipher; only two black lines with the
words SI and NO under each one.
The last democratically elected presi
dent, Salvador Allende, won a slight plu
rality of the vote in 1970. His Marxist
Popular Unity government was fraught
with internal divisions and frustrated by
the political and economic chaos allegedly
fostered by the CIA under the Nixon
administration.
A civil war was avoided in September
1973 when the military intervened in a
bloody coup. While many supported a

change toward stability, no one was
prepared for the savagery and bloodiness
of the coup and the dictatorship that
followed.
In 1980, after seven years without a
constitution, the regime drafted a docu
ment calling for a plebiscite to be held
in 1988.
The entire voting-age population is able
to vote for or against the re-election of
General Pinochet for another eight-year
term.
The coup that brought Pinochet to
power in 1973 was extremely violent, in
volving full mobilization of the armed
forces.
The terror did not end with the brutal
coup. As human rights worker Carlos
Cordallffn explained, "the form of repres
sion in Chile is .. . very systematized,
very professional, and very efficient."
For most Chileans, the plebiscite sig
nals a chance to ease the fear and inse
curity they have experienced under the
Pinochet dictatorship, and gives hope for
an end to 15 years of flagrant human
rights abuses and a return to democracy.

He studied the role of human rights groups
there, and how they function under a military
dictatorship. He lived with Chileans in a boarding
house for students. Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen played a crucial role, according to Dick

The parade of students slowly made its way
up the busy downtown Santiago Avenue.
Muffled political slogans blared from a truck;
opposition banners emblazoned the sides of cars.
A transit bus whose driver had taken the day
off to support the fight against Chilean President
Augusto Pinochet moved along the streets.
As they marched, the demonstrators blew
loudly on plastic horns, beat drums and sounded
car horns; occasionally the rhythms of the many
anti-Pinochet chants of the opposition could be

heard: "Va a caer!" (He's going to fall), or "El
pueblo, unido, jamas sea vencido" (The people
united can never be defeated).
The caravan demonstrated opposition to Pres
ident Augusto Pinochet who has ruled Chile since
Sept. 11, 1973, when a military coup overthrew
the democratically-elected government of Presi
dent Salvador Allende.
Pinochet's regime will be challenged today in
a plebiscite election that allows Chileans to vote
for or against the continuation of Pinochet's mil
itary dictatorship.
Suddenly a shout rang out from the front of
the caravan: "Pacos!" (The derogatory name for
the Chilean police). Instantly there was chaos,
people scattering in all directions.
A towering black and white tank-like water
cannon truck blasted the crowd with powerful
jets of water. Glass broke as the force of the
water broke nearby shop windows. People
strained to hear the loud crack of a tear gas
firing or worse. . .
But this skirmish was over in less than a
minute. The police had detained only 10 people
who were held in one of the green, heavily ar
mored police buses that are common sights in
the center of the city.
Protests and clashes between the police and
opposition demonstrators are commonplace in
Chile these days. But this parade was
different. It was legal.
The previous day, early in September,
the regime had lifted its martial law-like
"state of exception" in a largely symbolic
gesture to enhance its image and win
votes for itself in the plebiscite.
Although the demonstration no longer
violated the law, the police were so ac
