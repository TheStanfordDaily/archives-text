						look at Chile today

Editor'B note: Jonathan Dickstein is a senior
majoring in International Relations, focusing on
lxitin American studies. He recently returned from
three months living in Santiago, Chile. While
there, Dickstein researched Chilean human rights
organizations for an honors thesis he will write
this year.
He studied the role of human rights groups
there, and how they function under a military
dictatorship. He lived with Chileans in a boarding
house for students. Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen played a crucial role, according to Dick
stein, in planning the project, which was not
alligned with another program. Fagen is also
Dickstein's thesis adviser. Dickstein, who has
studied Spanish at Stanford, conducted his re
search in Chile entirely in Spanish.

The parade of students slowly made its way
up the busy downtown Santiago Avenue.
Muffled political slogans blared from a truck;
opposition banners emblazoned the sides of cars.
A transit bus whose driver had taken the day
off to support the fight against Chilean President
Augusto Pinochet moved along the streets.
As they marched, the demonstrators blew
loudly on plastic horns, beat drums and sounded
car horns; occasionally the rhythms of the many
anti-Pinochet chants of the opposition could be

heard: "Va a caer!" (He's going to fall), or "El
pueblo, unido, jamas sea vencido" (The people
united can never be defeated).
The caravan demonstrated opposition to Pres
ident Augusto Pinochet who has ruled Chile since
Sept. 11, 1973, when a military coup overthrew
the democratically-elected government of Presi
dent Salvador Allende.
Pinochet's regime will be challenged today in
a plebiscite election that allows Chileans to vote
for or against the continuation of Pinochet's mil
itary dictatorship.
Suddenly a shout rang out from the front of
the caravan: "Pacos!" (The derogatory name for
the Chilean police). Instantly there was chaos,
people scattering in all directions.
A towering black and white tank-like water
cannon truck blasted the crowd with powerful
jets of water. Glass broke as the force of the
water broke nearby shop windows. People
strained to hear the loud crack of a tear gas
firing or worse. . .
But this skirmish was over in less than a
minute. The police had detained only 10 people
who were held in one of the green, heavily ar
mored police buses that are common sights in
the center of the city.
Protests and clashes between the police and
opposition demonstrators are commonplace in
