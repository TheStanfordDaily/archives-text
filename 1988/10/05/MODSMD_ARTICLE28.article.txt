Barrel full of Monkeys
Remember when you used to buy a single?
You'd get one of those little 7-inch pieces of
vinyl. Well, now you've got a choice to make.
George Michael's "Monkey" single has become
the first in CBS Records history to be released
in SIX formats: 12-inch vinyl, cassette single,
cassette maxi-single, CD3 single, CD3 maxi
single and, of course, 7-inch vinyl.
But stand by, because "Kissing a Fool" is
about to become his seventh-consecutive No.
1 single in who-knows-how-many formats. We
can hear George smooching from here.
Pretty propaganda
Drop by the Stanford Art Gallery this quarter
to check out the exhibit of classic World War
I propaganda posters.
In the days before television, these color
posters were the medium for manipulating
public opinion. Such classics as the pretty sailor
girl saying, "Gee! I wish I were a man — I'd
join the Navy" induced thousands of men to
enlist during the war.
The Stanford Art Gallery is located near Hoo
ver Tower and is open Fridays from 10 a.m. to
5 p.m., weekends from 1 to 5 p.m., and is
closed Monday.
