## Cronenberg scores with 'Ringers' 
### Mark Tompkins Staff writer 
Try telling people the story of "Dead
Ringers" and you're likely to raise a
few eyebrows.
"Well," you might begin, "it's about
these crazy twin gynecologists." As you
start elaborating and saying what a good
movie it is, your audience may very well
decide to look up the showtitnes for
"Sweet Hearts' Dance" instead.
To the non-fan, all of writer-director
David Cronenberg's movies are going
to sound completely bizarre, but that
shouldn't stop anyone from seeing
them. "Dead Ringers" is a worthy ad
dition to the Cronenberg canon, proving
once again what an inimitable talent he
is. No one, but no one, looks at things
the way he does.
Loosely based on a 1975 incident in
New York City, "Dead Ringers" tells of
Beverly and Elliot Mantle (both played
by Jeremy Irons), twin brothers who
run a very successful gynecology clinic
in Toronto. Beverly, shy and insecure,
is a brilliant researcher. While he
hunches over the microscope, Elliot is
out picking up awards, grants — and
any number of women.
This obvious power imbalance in the
twins' relationship is not what it seems,
however. It turns out that neither

brother can face the world without the
other; living together in a chic
mausoleum of an apartment, they are
completely disconnected from everyone
except each other.
The Mantles share all of their expe
riences together, including their women.
Elliot charms and seduces the most at
tractive of the patients to enter their
clinic, and then, with a smirk, hands
them over to Beverly, who poses as El
liot. Or Elliot poses as Beverly. No one
can ever tell the difference.
But when the brothers use their
standard m.o. on the actress Claire
Niveau (Genevieve Bujold), the already
striking unhealthiness of their arrange
ment intensifies into a kind of creeping
rot. The brothers share a clinical, almost
sneering attitude toward women, but
Beverly finds himself falling in love with
Claire. The status quo of his life shat
tered, he begins a downward spiral of
drug-taking and unbalanced behavior
that pulls his brother down with him.
Elliot can hardly resist, for he and
his brother have always done everything
together. They are more effectively
bound together than any Siamese twins.
Jeremy Irons has always been a ter
rific actor, and his presence in this
movie shows that there is some justice
in the world. We've squirmed through

what seemed like an endless series of
soporific art movies just to see him;
finally he's taken a risk in his choice
of material, and it has paid off brilliant
ly. He could have sleepwalked his way
through half a dozen boring, prestigious
literary adaptations without ever get
ting to show the range and the control
that he does here.
Irons makes Beverly and Elliot clearly
distinct personalities, even without the
minor nuances of wardrobe and
hairstyling to help him. His rather min
imal acting style — and his ghastly,
"undead" pallor — is perfect for the
Mantle twins and their remote inner
lives.
Irons' cool restraint is typical of
"Dead Ringers" as a whole, all of which
looks like it has been filtered through
cold blue light. It's only in the operating
room, where Beverly and his assistants
wear robes of a startling crimson, that
the icy look is disrupted.
The operating room is also the site
of another great Cronenberg invention,
the surgical instruments created by
Beverly in his drugged-out psychosis.
Looking like polished bone, the instru
ments are like grotesque parodies of the
female reproductive system, clearly the
product of an unhinged mind.
Obviously, a movie like this is going
to gross out a lot of people. Men —
let's face it — may come out of the
theatre feeling pretty relieved that
they'll never have to go to a
gynecologists.
Not the most pleasant of thoughts,
but then David Cronenberg's movies
have always dealt with unsettling things
— "The Brood," "Scanners,"
"Videodrome," "The Dead Zone," "The
Fly" and now "Dead Ringers."
A lot of people saw (and enjoyed) "The
Fly" without ever thinking about it',
Cronenberg was inspired to make the
film after experiencing the pain of
watching his father die of cancer. His
other motive was the thought, "Sooner
or later in every relationship one of the
people involved turns into a monster."
Probably everyone has thought this at
some point, but who else would have
filmed it in such literal terms?
"Dead Ringers" works the same way.
The Mantle twins' creepy relationship
is built on l a hierarchy of resentment
and interdependency, and can be seen
as a worst-case scenario for all types of
suffocating relationships. The film also
toys with the notion that Beverly and
Elliot are two aspects of the same per
son. Imagine being sick, addicted and
trapped with everything you hate about
yourself (but can never escape) in a
ruined apartment, and you'll begin to
get an idea of what the closing moments
of "Dead Ringers" are like.

Jeremy Irons as Dr. Beverly Mantle. Or maybe as his twin brother, Elliot.
Even they don't know for sure.
