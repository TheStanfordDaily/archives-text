# Crowd control measures tightened for Flicks
## 
### Brad Hayward 
Newly-enforced crowd control meas
ures implemented at Sunday's Flicks
were successful and will continue to
be used, ASSU officials announced yes
terday.
Implementation of the new proce
dures followed last Wednesday's 9:30
Flicks premiere, when a rowdy crowd
drew campus police to th«-scene, after
jamming the aisles of the auditorium,
which created a fire hazard.
The new measures call for more or
ganization and supervision at the en
trance to Memorial Auditorium before
the late show. Moviegoers now form
four lines up the steps of Mem Aud
and enter through four separate doors,
not just the two used at previous
Flicks.

members than movie
goers.'

by bollards set up in the middle of the
steps and ensure that no shoving takes
place. ASSU staff also use walkie
talkies, bullhorns and power lights to
maintain order.
To eliminate the hazard of people
sitting in the aisles, the doors are
closed once 1,600 people have entered.
The capacity of Mem Aud is 1,700.
Flicks manager Tim Cahill said the
new measures used at the 9:30 show
"worked beautifully."
"1 was surprised by how many Flicks
staff members they had out in front,"

said senior Morty Posner, who atten
ded the 9:30 show. "There were prob
ably more Flicks staff members than
movie goers. This leads one to wonder
where (the staff members) were
before. It didn't look like they had any
trouble."
Junior Cathy Pascoe agreed. "I got
there at 9:15 ... and there was no
line. There was no pushing and
shoving so I think it went pretty well.
Frankly, the walkie-talkies were (a
little) much." Cahili, ASSU staffer
David Supple and Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Michael Ramsey-Perez de
signed the new safety measures.
"I was very impressed with how Tim
handled this and how it was completely
turned around in a week," said ASSU
Senator Dana Klapper, who received
complaints from three or four students
Wednesday and notified Cahill.
Cahill attributed the crowd's good

behavior Sunday night to the new
measures and an unusually large turn
out for the early show. About four
times the usual number of early show
patrons showed up for Sunday's 7:00
p.m. show.
Cahill said that since attendance at
the Flicks generally decreases as the
quarter progresses, some measures
may not be needed later.
In addition, only moviegoers holding
passes were admitted to Sunday's late
show. Cahill said he "cannot guarantee
that tickets will be sold at the late
show" for at least the first few shows
of each quarter, including next Sun
day's presentation of "Colors."
Tickets will be sold at the door for
all early shows.
Cahill said he is not too concerned
with the paper-throwing that has
taken place at the Flicks.
