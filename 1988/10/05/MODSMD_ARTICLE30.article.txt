Loving the pickle man
In "Crossing Delancey," Izzy Grossman (Amy Irving) is a
33-year old single woman caught between two men, two sides
of town and two very different styles of life.
Izzy's life and work are very uptown NYC, far North of
Delancey street in the Jewish lower East side where her grand
mother lives. She works for "the last great bookstore in New
York," where she arranges readings by prestigious authors and
manages the ultra-modern bookstore staff.
Izzy eryoys her life and loves her contacts with authors, par
ticularly with Anton Maes, a Dutch writer with a bent toward
"intense sexual tension" in his works.
But her grandmother Bubbie (played perfectly by Reizl Bozyk
in her first film role) feels Izzy should be happily married and
living nearby ("Only a dog lives alone in a room!"), so she
arranges for a marriage broker to find Izzy a mate. The movie
focuses on Izzy's very unwilling relationship with Sam the pickle
salesman, the nice Jewish boy chosen by the marriage broker
for Izzy.
"Crossing Delancey" is not a one-dimensional boy-meets-girl
love story, however. The movie is episodic, showing a series of
incidents in Izzy's life which serve to outline the problems and
yearnings of many independent women. Izzy is deliberating not
only between the author Maes and the pickle man, but also
between modern life and tradition, and somewhat, between single
ness and motherhood.
This debate is enriched for the viewer by the depth and realism
director, Joan Milken Silver brings to the screen. Using street
level photography, careful sound mixing, and a relentless eye
for detail, Silver gives us a real feeling for the typical streets
of New York, and for the textures of Izzy and Bubbie's lives.
The movie is deliberately paced to take advantage of the richness
of these images.
"Crossing Delancey" is a well-acted, carefully-crafted, funny
and thoughtful movie that should not be missed.

Gandhi goes criminal
For a lot of people, "Gandhi" is the only exposure they've
had to Ben Kingsley. That's a shame, because more than ever
his wonderful acting talent shows through in "Pascali's Island."
Kingsley is Basil Pascali, an informer on the small Greek
island of Nisi at the turn of the century. Ignored for years by
his employers in Constantinople, Pascali wonders whether the
reports he has been dutifully sending have even been read by
the government.
When British archeologist Anthony Bowles (Charles Dance)
arrives on Nisi to look for artifacts, Pascali offers his services
as an interpreter in order to find out what Bowles is up to.
What he is up to, naturally, is no good, and Pascali must
eventually decide whether he should continue giving loyalty to
his ignoring superiors or follow the path to a new life off the
island which Bowles could provide.
Few actors become their character with as much apparent
ease as Kingsley. His Pascali is fully three-dimensional and filled
with the little telling nuances of a real person. Ben Kingsley
does not make bad films, and this is no exception. Only the
undeserved and perjoritive labeling of this picture as an art film
will keep it from being a success.
