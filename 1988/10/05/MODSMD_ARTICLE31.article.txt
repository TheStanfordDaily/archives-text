## The 						heaviest metal of the summer 
### 
The sunny months started out
hot with the release of Van
Halen's eighth-consecutive
platinum album, "OU812." For
those of you who don't like Van
Halen, go to h-. "OU812" is a
great album (with the noted ex
ception of the bonus track on the
CD, "A Apolitical Blues").
Guitarist Eddie Van Halen's
gifted hands are by far the best

Gene Anaya

in the business, demonstrated
once again by the way in which
they skillfully coax sounds out of
his home-made Stratocasters and
Bertinelli. Although his perform
ance on keyboards doesn't rival
Beethoven, at least he's still alive.
With songs such as "A.F.U.
(Naturally Wired)," "Black and
Blue," and "Source of Infection,"
Van Halen preserves their place
at the top of the rock scene (a
place David Lee Roth only reads
about in Rolling Stone).
The quality of this album
elevates Van Halen far beyond the
many other long-haired, hard
rocking, noise-making bands that
currently plague the airwaves.
Speaking of long-haired, noise
making bands that currently
plague the airwaves, Guns N'
Roses has become somewhat
popular over the past few months
with their No. 1 album "Appetite
for Destruction." But let's not
confuse popularity with quality;
after all, George Michael has had
No. 1 hits.
W. Axl Rose (I'm sure his
mother is proud he chose such an
obviously made-up name), Slash
(another winner of a name), Izzy
Stradlin (need I say more), and
the other two guys have taken
this band out of the gutters of
L.A. into the gutters of America.
To speak of Guns N' Roses' tal
ent is something of a contradic
tion. Take Axl's voice, for
example. The scream that in
itiates "Welcome to the Jungle"
is hardly what anyone would call
an example of good voice control,
although it is preferable to sleep
ing with a squid.

As for Slash, well, he's the type
of guitarist who makes that jerk
down the hall who plays his
electric guitar at three in the
morning think that he has a
chance in hell of making it in the
music industry.
Like all aspiring wanna-be
heavy metalists, Guns N' Roses'
songs include the usual sexual in
nuendoes such as "I wanna watch
you bleed" and"I wanna hear you
scream" (lines my freshman
roommate used to use when —
and I am not making this up —
he would have wild sex with
women while I was in the room
trying to sleep).
Their creative talents are most
evident in the labeling of their
cassette sides "G" and "R" for
"Guns" and "Roses." Cute. A high
school friend of mine said it all
about Guns n' Roses when he
said: "They're so rad; they're so
easy to play."

Yep, after one summer of
abusing his mother's ears he has
mastered the Guns n' Roses
sound, which can't be too difficult
considering that the last third of
"Sweet Child O' Mine" consists
of the line "Oh, where do we go
now" repeated about 14 billion
times.
The album's highlights, though
pretty mundane, are "Welcome to
the Jungle," the over-played
number-seven hit, "Sweet Child
O' Mine," and "Paradise City"
(another song with a boring
repeat ending that lasts about 10
years); it's downhill from there.
On the bright side, Guns n' Roses'
best quality is that they associate
with Tracy Lords.
But enough with the men of
metal. This brings us to an album
which was released last year but
the pinhead who used to write
these reviews didn't get around
to reviewing.
Lita Ford's self-titled album is

her best to date (which doesn't
say much because her first album
stunk). This time she has some
pretty big. . . . uh. . . . names
backing her up, including Nikki
Sixx of Motley Crue and Ozzy Os
bourne, who both lent helping
hands on some of the songs on
this consistently hard-rocking al
bum.
Lita displays her skill on the
guitar throughout the album, of
fering solos as good as any
guitarist's in the business. She's
the type of guitarist you want to
stay up with until three in the
morning.
Although the platinum-haired
rock goddess has so feu- released
the two worst songs on the album,
"Kiss me Deadly" and "Back to
the Cave," the rest is worth
having to endure them.
Lita's best songs are the ballads

The scream that in
itiates 'Welcome to
the Jungle' is hardly
what you'd call an ex
ample of good voice
control, although it is
preferable to sleeping
with a squid.

"Broken Dreams"; "Close My
Eyes Forever," which was re
corded with Ozzy Osbourne; and
the rockin' love ballad "Blueber
ry", which relates the annoying
habit that all freshmen couples
have of creating stupid pet games
for each other, such as
Pie," "Sexy Toes" and "Lover
Buns."
Even though "Lita" is not a
work of genius, it offers some pow
erful good ol' rock and roll with
which you can annoy your wimpy
Debbie Gibson-loving roommate.

in the male-dominated world of heavy metal, Llta Ford stands
virtually alone as the bad girl of rock 'n roll.
