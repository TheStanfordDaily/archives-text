### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Small but. scrappy does always not win
the race, as the California women's volley
ball team learned last night at Maples Pa
vilion. Gifted with a tangible height ad
vantage, a balanced, coordinated attack and
a star in freshman Kristin Klein, Stanford
handily upended the visiting Golden Bears
15-12, 15-9, 15-9 in a rapid-fire, 98-minute
match.
The win improves the No. 3 Cardinal's
record to 12-1, 6-1 in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. Cal falls to 8-8 overall, 1-6 in
league.

"I thought that we played very well,"
sophomore Karen Anderson said. "In the
beginning of the first game of the match
we started out really strong, held off a
little bit toward the end of the game but
I thought we stayed in there. It was a
pretty quick game. A quick game, a quick
match — I like it."
As in all Stanford-Cal meetings, emotions
were high and the play was intense on both
sides of the net once the match got under
way. At the outset, however, the contest
was all Stanford, as the Cardinal rapidly
rolled out to an 8-0 lead and what seemed
to be a total blow-out.
"We were ready to play tonight," Stan
ford Coach Don Shaw said. "We started
out the match really psyched and really
into it. Our concentration was really good,
really focused."
Once the score hit 10-2, however, the
tide took a drastic turn as the Bears began
to creep back. An exchange of points in

creased the tally to 14-5, but the Stanford
spikers could not put away the game until
the inspired Cal club earned seven un
answered points. Klein's first of her two
block solos finally ended the game.
"Cal was a little tentative," Shaw said.
"We got our first seven or eight points a
bit too easily. It happened so fast, we got
a big lead, and I think we settled back and
expected the whole match to go like that.
Cal's too good of a team — they're going
to scrap, scramble and battle. Then after
that it was almost as if we had to get
started all over again."
Long-time fans of Stanford volleyball
found themselves squirming in their seats,
remembering the matches of old when the
team squandered sizeable leads and lost
national championships as a consequence.
This time, the Cardinal held tough and
pulled out a win in spite losing speed.
"We tend to do that," Klein reflected.
"We get on a roll and we kind of lay back
and relax a little instead of playing our
hardest the whole way through. I think its
hard to concentrate the whole time through
three games and play your best the entire
time. So we had a couple problems, but
we snapped out of it and did the job."
Thanks to Klein, the rest of the match
posed little problem. The freshman outside
hitter literally exploded out on the court
and played one of the best matches of her
short yet phenomenal collegiate career.
Hitting almost at will, Klein recorded a
game-high 22 kills with but one error,
notching an incredible .618 hitting percent
age. She played comparably well on defense,
working for three blocks and eight digs.
"I was determined to play a really good
game tonight. I personally had a terrible
practice last night and so I really, really
wanted to play well. And then (junior) La
(Asper) was setting me perfect — I couldn't
ask for anything more."
