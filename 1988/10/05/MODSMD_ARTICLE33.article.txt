## Mets draw first blood 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -
Gary Carter's bloop double to
center field with two outs in
the ninth inning scored two
runs and gave New York a dra
matic 3-2 victory over Los An
geles Tuesday night and 1-0
lead in the National League
playoffs.
The Mets had been shut out
for eight innings by Dodgers
starter Orel Hershiser, who
came into the game off a record
streak of 59 consecutive score
less innings.
Gregg Jefferies, who had
three hits, led off the ninth
with a single and moved to sec
ond when Keith Hernandez
grounded to first. Darryl
Strawberry doubled to right to
score Jefferies.
Jay Howell relieved Her
shiser and walked Kevin
Mcßeynolds. He struck out
Howard Johnson and had two
strikes on Carter. The Mets
catcher then blooped a short
fly to center that John Shelby,
playing deep, failed to catch
with a diving attempt.
The ball dribbled past Shelby
a few feet and, with the run
ners moving on the play,
Mcßeynolds came all the way
around from first and just beat
Shelby's throw to the plate.
Sax led off the first inning
with a single to right field and
stole second. During the
season, Sax was successful on
42 of 64 steal attempts, but
was caught in his only attempt
against the Mets.
Franklin Stubbs attempted a
sacrifice on a 3-1 pitch and
missed it and Gooden then
struck him out swinging on the
next pitch. Kirk Gibson, play
ing with an inflamed ham
string, moved Sax to third with
a grounder and Marshall fol
lowed with a single that fell in
front of Strawberry in right
field.
Marshall had four hits in
seven at-bats against Gooden
this season and was 7-for-26
lifetime.
With one out in the top of
the first, Jefferies hit a hard
single into right field. But on
a hit-and-run play, Hernandez
hit a hard liner right at Sax
and Jefferies was easily
doubled off first.
The Dodgers added a run in
the seventh when Mike Scioscia
led off with a double, moved
to third on a grounder and
scored on Alfredo Griffin's
single.
Griffin, a .199 hitter, ironi
cally had suffered a broken
wrist when he was hit by a
Gooden fastball on May 21.
The Mets threatened in the

third when Carter led off with
an infield single and moved to
second on Wally Backman's
sacrifice.
After Gooden struck out,
Mookie Wilson — 10-for-28
lifetime against Hershiser —
singled hard to right field.
Carter stopped at third as Mar
shall rifled the ball toward
home.
Hershiser then retired Jef
feries for the only time in the
game, getting him to hit a weak
grounder back to the mound.
Hershiser retired nine
straight batters until Jefferies
and Hernandez singled with
two outs in the sixth. But Her
shiser got Strawberry to
ground out to first to end the
inning.
Hershiser's last defeat was a
2-1 setback by the Mets at
Dodger Stadium on Aug. 24.
He allowed seven hits in that
game and led 1-0 until the Mets
scored twice in the eighth.
Randy Myers pitched two in
nings in relief of Dwight
Gooden to get the victory.
Howell got the loss.
Gooden allowed only four
hits and struck out 10 in seven
innings of a game that more
than lived up to its billing as
a pitchers' duel.
Hershiser's regular-season
streak broke the major league
mark of 58 set by the Dodgers'
Don Drvsdale in 1968.
The last run Hershiser had
allowed was in the fifth inning
against Montreal on Aug. 30.
The right-hander then pitched
five straight shutouts and went
10 scoreless innings against
San Diego on Sept. 28 to set
the record.
Hershiser, 23-8 during the
season with eight shutouts, al
lowed seven hits, struck out
five and walked one in 8 1-3
innings. He used a variety of
sliders, curves and sinking
fastballs to fool the Mets, who
outscored the Dodgers 49-18 in
winning 10 of 11 games during
the season, including all six
here.
Manager Tommy Lasorda
has hinted Hershiser may pitch
two more games in the series,
if necessary.
Gooden remained unbeaten
at Dodger Stadium. He entered
the game with a 4-0 record in
six starts at Los Angeles,
having allowed two earned
runs in 53 innings for a 0.34
earned-run average.
Game 2 of the best-of-seven
series is scheduled Wednesday
night at Dodger Stadium, start
ing at 10:05 EDT. The Mets
will send David Cone, 20-3,
against rookie Tim Belcher, 12-
6.
