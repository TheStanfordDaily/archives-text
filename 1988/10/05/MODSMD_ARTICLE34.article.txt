# The 						trials and tribulations of a Met fan
## 
### 
My first baseball memory
dates back to 1973. The
Mets were playing the
Reds in the National League
playoffs at the time.
I was only six and didn't really
understand what was going on so
my memory is a bit hazy. I seem
to recall some controversy about
the Mets' Buddy Harrelson and
some guy named Pete Rose get-

ting into a fight over a double play.
After everything cooled down,
the Mets went on to beat the Reds
only to succumb to the Athletics
in a seven-game World Series. 1
don't honestly know whether I
saw more than a few minutes of
any of the games.
Still, the Mets were my team
back then and 1 stuck with them
as they faded to third place, then
fifth, then the cellar.
1 stuck with them until the fate
ful day when Tom Seaver was
dealt to the dreaded Reds. It
would be years before I forgave
my beloved Mets. When Nelson

Doubleday bought the team I no
longer could hold the owners re
sponsible for the loss of Seaver.
Early in 1983 I started to
believe the hapless
Metropolitans might be on
the road back to success. A young
hitter named Darryl Strawberry
was waiting in AAA and would
eventually be named Rookie of the
Year.
The next year, two pitchers
would join the fray and make a
habit of mowing down opposing
batters. But they weren't Seaver
and Jon Matlack. Or even Jerry
Koosman.
They were a couple of right
handers named Dwight Gooden
and Ron Darling. From day one,
it was obvious that Gooden was
one-in-a-million. It was clear the
Amazin' Mets would soon amaze
once again.
But the Chicago Cubs had ac
quired a buzzsaw named Rick
Sutcliffe and he cut the Mets, as
well as the rest of the National
League, to ribbons.
In 1985, the Mets would come
even closer only to be knocked
out of the postseason picture by
the Cardinals in the season's
waning days.
Then came 1986. The Mets
were under .500 only once,
at 2-3. They would win 106
of the final 157 games.
They were clearly a team of
destiny. All summer long I'd turn

on the TV in the late innings,
with the Mets trailing by three
and know they would pull it out.
More often than not, they did.
The Astros were the playoff foe
this time around and the nemesis
would be Cy Young Award winner
Mike Scott.
They had to win Game 6 in
order to avoid facing Scott in a
do-or-die seventh game. They did.
In the World Series, it was, the
Boston Red Sox. The Sox hadn't
won a championship in over half
a century so they were no threat,
I thought.
I sat in my room watching the
whole Series safely out of range
of all the Met haters in my dorm,
Robinson House. But something
went wrong and Game 6 again
proved pivotal.
When the Mets were all but
eliminated I walked out to the
lounge and figured I'd catch the
final three outs there. I felt like
no one would heckle now; they'd
let me wallow in my sorrows.
I sat on the couch and tried not
to look at the screen, but my eyes
were drawn to it. With two outs
and Kevin Mitchell at bat it was
clearly over. One of my dorm
mates try to cheer me up. "Do
you think they'll make it back
next year?" he asked.
"Yeah," I said.
On the next pitch Kevin
Mitchell stroked a single. The
Mets eventually tied the score. I
was going insane.
When Bill Buckner booted the

now infamous ground ball that
gave the game to the Mets 1
screamed loudly enough to be
heard throughout the entire of
Governor's Corner.
As everyone knows, the Mets
fulfilled their destiny in the final
game and Mets fans all over had
a memory to wipe out years of
frustration.
Sitting here watching Gooden
duel with Or&l Hershiser, I
get a sinking feefing the
Mets had better not let this series
go the distance.
At the same time, as Yogi Berra
would say, I'm feeling like it
might be deja vu all over again.
Somehow, some way, the Amazin'
Mets are going to triumph over
the Dodgers and then either the
A's or BoSox and bring home their
third World Series flag.
Somewhere in Brooklyn there's
a six-year-old kid who's not really
sure what's going on. But in fif
teen years the first thing he'll re
member is something about
Strawberry ending Hershiser's
scoreless streak and yet another
improbable Mets victory in the
ninth inning.
And maybe he'll get a chance
remember a champagne-filled
locker room scene at Shea in a
couple of weeks. Lightning might
not strike twice in the same place,
but destiny can.
