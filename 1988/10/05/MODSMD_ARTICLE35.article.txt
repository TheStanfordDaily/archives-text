# Card golf gets 2nd in Reno
## 
### Bruce Sarkisian Editorial staff 
Despite playing worse than eight of the 20 teams
in the field at the Wolfpack Invitational at Edgewood
Country Club in South Lake Tahoe, the Stanford
men's golf team improved its standing on the final
day to finish second in the event.
Coach Wally Goodwin said that the Cardinal could
even have won the tourney, if the squad had played
better. "I'm a little disappointed (by our play
today]," he remarked. "But so are the guys, and
that s a good sign. We've gotta go through that
before we can win."
Nevada-Reno, the host of the event, took the title,
with a team score of 892 for 54 holes. Stanford
followed with 903 strokes, and Oregon was third
with 906.
In general, the scores showed a rising trend as
the tournament got longer, probably because the
wind kicked up on the second day, making an already
lengthy (6,900-yard) course even longer and more
difficult.
Stanford's scores reflected this upward trend.
Brad Joondeph led the Cardinal wire-to-wire with
a three-day total of 224 (76-71-77). Brad Geer, an
injury redshirf last year, was next with 225 (76-
74-75), followed by Don Christensen at 226 (74-75-
77). However, the Cardinal's fourth- and fifth-place
finishers had scores that were too high to give
Stanford a shot at the title. Mark Funseth carded
230 (76-77-77) and John Mahon finished with 237
(81-75-81) strokes.
With the biggest tournament of the fall coming
up, Goodwin is looking to make some changes among
his troops. This weekend, Stanford will host an

invitational at the Stanford Golf
Course, and it is crucial for the
Cardinal to finish near the top on
its home turf. Some of the na
tion's top teams will visit the
Farm, including many from the
East Coast.
While five of the players
traveled to Reno this week, the
rest of the squad stayed at home
and played a match against Menlo
College. Goodwin said he would
be looking at the three to four
top scorers from that match to
challenge this week's traveling
squad.
While Goodwin was disap
pointed about his team's final
round performance, he found
some positives to take away from
Nevada. "Congratulations to Brad
Joondeph for leading us the whole
way, he deserves it," Goodwin
said, adding that "This is the
highest finish we've had in [a
multi-team] tournament of this
caliber since I've been here. We're
getting better."
