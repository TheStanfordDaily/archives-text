# Sailing starts well

For the second year in a row,
Stanford has asserted its
dominance in singlehanded sailing
in northern California, with first
and fourth place finishes at the
Pacific Coast Northern Elimina
tions in Berkeley on Saturday.
Following in the wake of last
year's All-America performance
by Tom Kuhnle, senior Brad
Swett led the Cardinal's effort
with a win at the event. The Elim
ination determined which sailors
would vie to represent the Pacific
region at the singlehanded na
tional championship later this fall.
Close behind Swett in the final
standings was sophomore Rick
Rosen, who ended up fourth, be
hind Paul Kerner from California
and Bart Hackworth of the Cali
fornia Maritime Academy.
Also sailing for Stanford was
newly-arrived freshman Peter
Somers, who finished just out of
the running in ninth place. Those

who worked past Somers during
the twelve-race regatta will travel
south later this month to face
southern California's best
singlehanders.
Hosted by the Berkeley Yacht
Club, Saturday's event featured
smooth to moderate San Fran
cisco Bay conditions and a breeze
that built during the day from
eight to eighteen knots.
According to Stanford Coach
Blake Middleton, those conditions
tested his sailors throughout the
day.
"Brad really seemed to thrive
when the wind came up, and he
was able to build substantial leads
in the windiest races. Rick, on the
other hand, was strongest in the
moderate conditions, while Peter,
who's lighter, fared best before
the wind started to howl," Mid
dleton said.
Indeed, as the breeze came up,
Swett won four of the last five
races to advance ahead of Hack
worth, who had led earlier on.
