# Ex-Dodger general manager avoids discussing his past racist remarks
## 
### DJ Herinstein 
In his speech to students
Monday night, A 1 Campanis
spoke on baseball, and only
baseball.
Fired last year following his
allegedly racist comments on
ABC News Nightline, the Los
Angeles Dodgers General
Manager neglected the issue
of racism in his prepared
speech at Cubberley Auditori
um.
According to Andrew Berke,
head of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, the Speakers Bureau

had invited Campanis under
the assumption that he would
address the issue of racism in
sports.

On the
Nig h 11 in e -
of April 6,
1987, Cam
panis said
that blacks
"may not
have some of
the neces-I
sities" to hold
management

positions in professional base
ball.

Following more than an
hour's worth of stories about
"the good ol' days" and his 46
years in baseball, Campanis
closed his speech with what
he considered the six most im
portant words: "I admit I
made a mistake."
Throughout his speech,
Campanis repeatedly prefaced
his explanations of baseball
terminology with "For the
ladies" or "For you girls."
Fifteen minutes into the
speech, BSU Chair Mary Dil
lard walked out of Cubberley,
