# Ex-Dodger general manager avoids discussing his past racist remarks
## 
### DJ Herinstein 
In his speech to students
Monday night, A 1 Campanis
spoke on baseball, and only
baseball.
Fired last year following his
allegedly racist comments on
ABC News Nightline, the Los
Angeles Dodgers General
Manager neglected the issue
of racism in his prepared
speech at Cubberley Auditori
um.
According to Andrew Berke,
head of the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, the Speakers Bureau

had invited Campanis under
the assumption that he would
address the issue of racism in
sports.

On the
Nig h 11 in e -
of April 6,
1987, Cam
panis said
that blacks
"may not
have some of
the neces-I
sities" to hold
management

positions in professional base
ball.

Following more than an
hour's worth of stories about
"the good ol' days" and his 46
years in baseball, Campanis
closed his speech with what
he considered the six most im
portant words: "I admit I
made a mistake."
Throughout his speech,
Campanis repeatedly prefaced
his explanations of baseball
terminology with "For the
ladies" or "For you girls."
Fifteen minutes into the
speech, BSU Chair Mary Dil
lard walked out of Cubberley,


Campanis
later saying she was "more than
disgusted" with Campanis'
slurstoward women and his lack
of discussion about his comments
on Nightline.
"1 was really annoyed. We (the
BSU) thought he was going to
talk about the real issue here. I
don't know whether to be more
upset with the man himself or
the Speakers Bureau for bringing
him here," Dillard said.
In a question-and-answer ses
sion after the talk, Campanis fi
nally did address the racism
question. Campanis said he had
been helping blacks since his days
in college baseball and praised
Jackie Robinson as one of the best
players he had ever worked with.
Campanis qualified his state

ment made on Nightline by saying
his words were mis
construed.
"I should have said blacks
lacked the necessary experience,
instead of saying they lacked the
necessities," he said.
According to Campanis, al
though Nightline host Ted Koppel
gave him three opportunities to
correct his statement, Campanis
did not, believing that viewers
would understand that he was not
questioning the ability of black
people.
He declined to comment when
asked about his statement that
blacks are not good swimmers be
cause they lack "buoyancy."
Campanis was asked to be on
Nightline as a part of a tribute
to Jackie Robinson. ABC officials
said they were surprised by the
issues he talked about.
Campanis lost his job with the
Dodgers the day after the

Nightline broadcast.
Sympathizing with Campanis,
freshman Jim King said he atten
ded the speech because he
"wanted to see his side."
"I'm sick of seeing the media
play closet bigot. I only had a
second-hand statement, and I
wanted to make my own judge
ment. People should put them
selves in his shoes," King said.
Freshman Chip Hall, who also
attended the speech, said he
doesn't consider Campanis a
racist.
"Anyone who's been in sports
that long and has been around
black people that long couldn't be
a racist. He played shortstop on
an all-black all-star team when
the other team was totally white,"
King said.
"You can tell it's a generation
gap," said King of Campanis'
prefaces 'for the ladies.'
Campanis cited a recent article
in which Peter Ueberroth, com
missioner of Major League Base
ball, said he thought Campanis
should have never been fired.
Ueberroth made his statement
more than a year after the
Nightline incident.
