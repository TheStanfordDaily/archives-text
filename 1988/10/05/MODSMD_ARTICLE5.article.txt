Branding Republican opponent
Tom Campbell as a candidate
whose policies simply follow the
polls, congressional candidate
Anna Eshoo spoke at the first
meeting of the Stanford Demo
crats Monday night.
During 90 minutes of speeches
at Annenberg Auditorium, the
Stanford Democrats put forth a
unified stance toward electing
presidential candidate Gov. Mi
chael Dukakis, U.S. Senate can
didate McCarthy and 12th
District candidate Eshoo.
In support of Eshoo, Stanford
Democrats Organizer Marian Sul
livan criticized Campbell's
"smooth talk and congeniality"
and called him "hand-picked na
tionally, locally and state-wide to
mimic public opinion polls."
During her 30-minute speech
to a 130-person crowd, Eshoo
charged that Campbell's stances
on the issues are not clear. His

views are shaped by what the polls
tell him, she said.
Campbell has said he is for a
higher minimum wage, parental
leave policies and child care.
But Eshoo pointed out that
"there are three issues the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce has come
out against in this campaign —
minimum wage raises, parental
leave policies and child care."
"And the Chamber of Com
merce is supporting Tom Camp
bell," she said.
Eshoo also criticized Campbell
for promoting theories rather
than policies.
"Learning theories is alright in
the classroom," she said, referring
to Campbell's position as a Stan
ford Law Professor. But Camp
bell's theories would not work
"when played out in your lives,"
she warned.
According to Eshoo, Campbell's
solution for balancing the budget
could work in theory but not in
practice. He plans to cut two to
five percent across the board —
even though areas such as educa
tion could not withstand further
cuts, as they are impoverished al
ready, she said.
"That's his theory, (but) what
the hell [would happen] to edu
cation?" she asked.
Eshoo opened her speech with
some words of praise for Stanford
students: "Stanford has always
been the home for those who have
a great deal of conscience . . . and
it has come from the students."
At the end, she received a stand
ing ovation and chants of "We
want Eshoo!"
Eshoo said the 12th District
race is a focus of national concern
because incumbent Republican
Ernie Konnyu lost in the prima
ries, putting the seat up for grabs,
which she said is very rare for
House races.
Also, she said the campaign is
one of the first in years where
the 12th District Democratic can

didate is putting up a substantial
fight.
"This election is going to be
very, very close," Eshoo said dur
ing her speech. Later, in an in
terview, she added that the cam
paigning of such prominent fig
ures as Arizona Governor Bruce
Babbitt and Sen. Bill Bradley, D
NJ, on her behalf underscores the
importance of the race.
Subodh Chandra, chair of the
Stanford Democrats, opened the
meeting by proclaiming, "I am a
card-carrying member of the
Democratic Party." Chandra's
opening exclamation was in ref
erence to to George Bush's
criticism of Dukakis for his mem
bership in the American Civil
Liberties Union.
He added, "We're ready to
move, and we're ready to win."
Stressing the importance of vol
unteer efforts, Chandra told the
crowd that the Stanford commu
nity has "an amazing opportu
nity" to influence the outcome of
November's elections.
COP member David Brown also
gave a short speech at the meet
ing, calling for "a new vision . . .
for a just and democratic society."
