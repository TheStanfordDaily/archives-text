# Classics Prof. finds ancient list
## 
### Bryan Cooperrider Editorial staff 
Summer has always been a
season for discovery, but for nine
Stanford students discovery
meant finding a 2,300-year old in
scription verifying the location of
the frontier fortress of Panakton.
Actually, the ancient marble in
scription was found by Classics
Prof. Mark Munn, co-director of
the Stanford-in-Greece summer
program.
After careful study, Munn, and
his wife Mary Lou, the other co
director, deciphered the inscrip
tion as a fragment of a decree
honoring a core of 19-year-old At
henian cadets and their officers
who were on garrison at Panakton
for year-long service.

It's very worn and the
letters are very small
— less than a quarter
of an inch — but we
knew right away it
was a list of names.'
— Mark Munn

"There are ruins of several forts
north of Athens, and for centuries
scholars have argued over which
is Panakton," Munn said.
"We always thought that the
fort above the Skourta Plain was
Panakton and the discovery of the
inscription, which is Athenian,

now proves that this definitely is
Panakton," Munn added.
Panakton was first mentioned
in ancient texts by Thucydides
when the Spartans and Athenians
returned captured land to one an
other, resulting in a peace treaty
during the Peloponnesian War
(421 8.C.).
Although most of the ruined
buildings at Panakton that com
mand the Skourta plain today are
Frankish (1400 A.D.), the Munns
have traced human settlement
back to the Neolithic Period
(6000-4000 8.C.).
The fragment of the cut marble
inscription has bits of 26 lines,
but no complete sentences. "It's
very worn and the letters are verv
small — less than a quarter of
an inch — but we knew right
away it was a list of names,"
Munn said. '
According to Munn, even well
preserved inscriptions can't be
read right away. "There is no
punctuation, no word division and
everything is written in a contin
uous line in Ancient Greek."
The Munns explained that
there are two ways to study an
inscription, and they used both.
The first is to wet the stone and
rub soft charcoal and water on
the inscription so thaf the char
coal settles into the etching of the
letters.
The second method is "to sit
on the porch at midnight with a
flashlight and shine a raking light
upon the inscription so that the
shadows of the letters show up."
On the inscription the Munns
were able to read 15 names and
two Athenian towns. They were
also able to date it to around 330
8.C., the age of Alexander the
Great.
"Athenian cadets were required
to train for two years, and the
second year was spent on garrison
in the frontier forts of Attica,"
Mark explained.
"At the end of the second year
it was common to write down the
names of the cadets, and what we
have is part of this list of honors,"
he added.
The inscription was not the
only finding of note for the group
this summer. "Even without the
discovery of the inscription we
had a really good summer in

terms of discoveries," Mary Lou
Munn said.
According to Isaac Barchas, a
senior in Classics, one of the more
exciting finds of the summer was
a remote Mycanean settlement on
a rugged mountain peak which
dates back to between 1300 and
1200 B.C. — about the time of
the famous Greek expedition to
Troy was taking place.
"We think this might be a
settlement inhabited by Pelas
gians — the most mysterious in
digenous peoples of Ancient
Greece," Munn added.
Although the project this sum
mer turned up other important
finds, such as medieval coins
dating from 1200 A.D. and a
Mycanean figurine, Mary Lou
pointed out that most of the ac
tual information of the area was
derived from the plethora of an

cient pottery found lying on the
ground.
"Since the beginning of the
project we've discovered approxi
mately 70 previously unknown
sites ranging from around 6000
B.C. up to Early Modern times.
We've actually compiled a history
of the area by examining ancient
garbage," Mary Lou said.
The Stanford-in-Greece pro
gram was founded in 1973 with
funds left by Mary Curry Tresid
der, wife of the fourth president
of Stanford. It began as a travel
study program. From 1979 to
1982 Classics Prof. Michael
Jameson led a team of students
to southern Greece on the Argolid
Exploration Project, which was in
volved with the same type of work
that is currently taking place in
the Skourta Plain Project, now
led by the Munns.

The Stanford Skourta Plain
Project, open to students of all
majors, began in 1985 as a five
year project to study the
mountain-enclosed plain on the
border of Boeotia and Attica, just
north of Athens.
Munn explained that the
Skourta Plain Project is attempt
ing to define the ancient frontier
boundaries between the two clas
sical states of Attica and Boeotia.
"We're trying to define the rela
tionship between this rural moun
tainous region and the lowland
city centers like Athens and

Thebes."
Munn added that many ar
chaeologists and ancient his
torians are busy unraveling the
mysteries of the ancient palaces
and its royal families, but few are
looking for clues to shed light on
rural life in ancient times.
"We're piecing together the his
tory of this mountainous border
region and looking at how settle
ments have changed from Neolit
hic to Modern times," said Mary
Lou.
The Stanford project is an
eight-week program during the
summer that includes a two week
study-tour of many ancient sites
in Greece and six weeks of field
work.
Students participate in the
study of the Skourta valley, not
digging but using a technique the
Munns call "field surveying." This
entails walking through areas
carefully laid out on a detailed
map and parching for signs of
ancient civilization such as pot
tery sherds, building foundations
and coins.
"I got letters from my friends
all summer asking me how the
digging was going, although we
weren't digging at all. . . . ancient
material is just lying around on
the surface of the ground," said
Jennifer Gurton, a junior major
ing in Human Biology and partic
ipant in the program this past
summer.
"We went everywhere. We
walked through plowed fields,
vineyards, up steep slopes,
through prickly oak and evil
thistles that were at least five feet

tall — because they were barely
smaller than I am," said Katia
Kubicek, a junior majoring in
Classics.
The Munns emphasized that ex
cavation is a very costly operation
and offers a detailed view of only
a small area, whereas field sur
veying offers a fairly accurate and
detailed description of the activi
ties throughout a much wider ex
panse.
Although the Skourta Plain
Project is slated for completion
after next summer, the Munns
have plans to take Stanford stu
dents in 1991 to excavate Panak
ton.
"There are many monument
bases around the area in which
the inscription was found, which
seems to suggest an important
public building or temple, which
is where inscriptions are often set
up," Mark said.
"We know from other ancient
inscriptions that there is a Temple
of Apollo at Panakton, and thAt
could very probably be the ruins
of the temple. We hope to find
more inscriptions, discover the
temple of Apollo and learn more
about garrison life of the cadets
in the distant past," he added.
"It's a nice coincidence that this
inscription which records the
graduation of group of youths
that spent their time marching
about the countryside was discov
ered by a group of Stanford stu
dents, the same age, who
spent their summer doing the
same thing. It's kind of a bridge
across time," Munn said.


The ancient marble inscription, dated around 330 8.C., was found
in Panakton by the Stanford-in-Greece program this summer. The
artifact, which verifies the location of the ancient fortress of Panak
ton, is a decree honoring a core of 19-year- old Athenian soldiers.

mountain-enclosed plain on the
border of Boeotia and Attica, just
north of Athens.
Munn explained that the
Skourta Plain Project is attempt
ing to define the ancient frontier
boundaries between the two clas
sical states of Attica and Boeotia.
"We're trying to define the rela
tionship between this rural moun
tainous region and the lowland
city centers like Athens and

Thebes."
Munn added that many ar
chaeologists and ancient his
torians are busy unraveling the
mysteries of the ancient palaces
and its royal families, but few are
looking for clues to shed light on
rural life in ancient times.
"We're piecing together the his
tory of this mountainous border
region and looking at how settle
ments have changed from Neolit
hic to Modern times," said Mary
Lou.
The Stanford project is an
eight-week program during the
summer that includes a two week
study-tour of many ancient sites
in Greece and six weeks of field
work.
Students participate in the
study of the Skourta valley, not
digging but using a technique the
Munns call "field surveying." This
entails walking through areas
carefully laid out on a detailed
map and parching for signs of
ancient civilization such as pot
tery sherds, building foundations
and coins.
"I got letters from my friends
all summer asking me how the
digging was going, although we
weren't digging at all. . . . ancient
material is just lying around on
the surface of the ground," said
Jennifer Gurton, a junior major
ing in Human Biology and partic
ipant in the program this past
summer.
"We went everywhere. We
walked through plowed fields,
vineyards, up steep slopes,
through prickly oak and evil
thistles that were at least five feet

tall — because they were barely
smaller than I am," said Katia
Kubicek, a junior majoring in
Classics.
The Munns emphasized that ex
cavation is a very costly operation
and offers a detailed view of only
a small area, whereas field sur
veying offers a fairly accurate and
detailed description of the activi
ties throughout a much wider ex
panse.
Although the Skourta Plain
Project is slated for completion
after next summer, the Munns
have plans to take Stanford stu
dents in 1991 to excavate Panak
ton.
"There are many monument
bases around the area in which
the inscription was found, which
seems to suggest an important
public building or temple, which
is where inscriptions are often set
up," Mark said.
"We know from other ancient
inscriptions that there is a Temple
of Apollo at Panakton, and thAt
could very probably be the ruins
of the temple. We hope to find
more inscriptions, discover the
temple of Apollo and learn more
about garrison life of the cadets
in the distant past," he added.
"It's a nice coincidence that this
inscription which records the
graduation of group of youths
that spent their time marching
about the countryside was discov
ered by a group of Stanford stu
dents, the same age, who
spent their summer doing the
same thing. It's kind of a bridge
across time," Munn said.


The ancient marble inscription, dated around 330 8.C., was found
in Panakton by the Stanford-in-Greece program this summer. The
artifact, which verifies the location of the ancient fortress of Panak
ton, is a decree honoring a core of 19-year- old Athenian soldiers.

Classics Prof. Mark Munn displays where his discovery had originally stood. Munn theorizes that
the ruins where the inscription was found might have been the ancient Temple of Apollo.

Summer has always been a
season for discovery, but for nine
Stanford students discovery
meant finding a 2,300-year old in
scription verifying the location of
the frontier fortress of Panakton.
Actually, the ancient marble in
scription was found by Classics
Prof. Mark Munn, co-director of
the Stanford-in-Greece summer
program.
After careful study, Munn, and
his wife Mary Lou, the other co
director, deciphered the inscrip
tion as a fragment of a decree
honoring a core of 19-year-old At
henian cadets and their officers
who were on garrison at Panakton
for year-long service.

It's very worn and the
letters are very small
— less than a quarter
of an inch — but we
knew right away it
was a list of names.'

"There are ruins of several forts
north of Athens, and for centuries
scholars have argued over which
is Panakton," Munn said.
"We always thought that the
fort above the Skourta Plain was
Panakton and the discovery of the
inscription, which is Athenian,

now proves that this definitely is
Panakton," Munn added.
Panakton was first mentioned
in ancient texts by Thucydides
when the Spartans and Athenians
returned captured land to one an
other, resulting in a peace treaty
during the Peloponnesian War
(421 8.C.).
Although most of the ruined
buildings at Panakton that com
mand the Skourta plain today are
Frankish (1400 A.D.), the Munns
have traced human settlement
back to the Neolithic Period
(6000-4000 8.C.).
The fragment of the cut marble
inscription has bits of 26 lines,
but no complete sentences. "It's
very worn and the letters are verv
small — less than a quarter of
an inch — but we knew right
away it was a list of names,"
Munn said. '
According to Munn, even well
preserved inscriptions can't be
read right away. "There is no
punctuation, no word division and
everything is written in a contin
uous line in Ancient Greek."
The Munns explained that
there are two ways to study an
inscription, and they used both.
The first is to wet the stone and
rub soft charcoal and water on
the inscription so thaf the char
coal settles into the etching of the
letters.
The second method is "to sit
on the porch at midnight with a
flashlight and shine a raking light
upon the inscription so that the
shadows of the letters show up."
On the inscription the Munns
were able to read 15 names and
two Athenian towns. They were
also able to date it to around 330
8.C., the age of Alexander the
Great.
"Athenian cadets were required
to train for two years, and the
second year was spent on garrison
in the frontier forts of Attica,"
Mark explained.
"At the end of the second year
it was common to write down the
names of the cadets, and what we
have is part of this list of honors,"
he added.
The inscription was not the
only finding of note for the group
this summer. "Even without the
discovery of the inscription we
had a really good summer in

terms of discoveries," Mary Lou
Munn said.
According to Isaac Barchas, a
senior in Classics, one of the more
exciting finds of the summer was
a remote Mycanean settlement on
a rugged mountain peak which
dates back to between 1300 and
1200 B.C. — about the time of
the famous Greek expedition to
Troy was taking place.
"We think this might be a
settlement inhabited by Pelas
gians — the most mysterious in
digenous peoples of Ancient
Greece," Munn added.
Although the project this sum
mer turned up other important
finds, such as medieval coins
dating from 1200 A.D. and a
Mycanean figurine, Mary Lou
pointed out that most of the ac
tual information of the area was
derived from the plethora of an

cient pottery found lying on the
ground.
"Since the beginning of the
project we've discovered approxi
mately 70 previously unknown
sites ranging from around 6000
B.C. up to Early Modern times.
We've actually compiled a history
of the area by examining ancient
garbage," Mary Lou said.
The Stanford-in-Greece pro
gram was founded in 1973 with
funds left by Mary Curry Tresid
der, wife of the fourth president
of Stanford. It began as a travel
study program. From 1979 to
1982 Classics Prof. Michael

mand the Skourta plain today are
Frankish (1400 A.D.), the Munns
have traced human settlement
back to the Neolithic Period
(6000-4000 8.C.).
The fragment of the cut marble
inscription has bits of 26 lines,
but no complete sentences. "It's
very worn and the letters are verv
small — less than a quarter of
an inch — but we knew right
away it was a list of names,"
Munn said. '
According to Munn, even well
preserved inscriptions can't be
read right away. "There is no
punctuation, no word division and
everything is written in a contin
uous line in Ancient Greek."
The Munns explained that
there are two ways to study an
inscription, and they used both.
The first is to wet the stone and
rub soft charcoal and water on
the inscription so thaf the char
coal settles into the etching of the
letters.
The second method is "to sit
on the porch at midnight with a
flashlight and shine a raking light
upon the inscription so that the
shadows of the letters show up."
On the inscription the Munns
were able to read 15 names and
two Athenian towns. They were
also able to date it to around 330
8.C., the age of Alexander the
Great.
"Athenian cadets were required
to train for two years, and the
second year was spent on garrison
in the frontier forts of Attica,"
Mark explained.
"At the end of the second year
it was common to write down the
names of the cadets, and what we
have is part of this list of honors,"
he added.
The inscription was not the
only finding of note for the group
this summer. "Even without the
discovery of the inscription we
had a really good summer in

terms of discoveries," Mary Lou
Munn said.
According to Isaac Barchas, a
senior in Classics, one of the more
exciting finds of the summer was
a remote Mycanean settlement on
a rugged mountain peak which
dates back to between 1300 and
1200 B.C. — about the time of
the famous Greek expedition to
Troy was taking place.
"We think this might be a
settlement inhabited by Pelas
gians — the most mysterious in
digenous peoples of Ancient
Greece," Munn added.
Although the project this sum
mer turned up other important
finds, such as medieval coins
dating from 1200 A.D. and a
Mycanean figurine, Mary Lou
pointed out that most of the ac
tual information of the area was
derived from the plethora of an

cient pottery found lying on the
ground.
"Since the beginning of the
project we've discovered approxi
mately 70 previously unknown
sites ranging from around 6000
B.C. up to Early Modern times.
We've actually compiled a history
of the area by examining ancient
garbage," Mary Lou said.
The Stanford-in-Greece pro
gram was founded in 1973 with
funds left by Mary Curry Tresid
der, wife of the fourth president
of Stanford. It began as a travel
study program. From 1979 to
1982 Classics Prof. Michael
Jameson led a team of students
to southern Greece on the Argolid
Exploration Project, which was in
volved with the same type of work
that is currently taking place in
the Skourta Plain Project, now
led by the Munns.

The Stanford Skourta Plain
Project, open to students of all
majors, began in 1985 as a five
year project to study the
mountain-enclosed plain on the
border of Boeotia and Attica, just
north of Athens.
Munn explained that the
Skourta Plain Project is attempt
ing to define the ancient frontier
boundaries between the two clas
sical states of Attica and Boeotia.
"We're trying to define the rela
tionship between this rural moun
tainous region and the lowland
city centers like Athens and

Thebes."
Munn added that many ar
chaeologists and ancient his
torians are busy unraveling the
mysteries of the ancient palaces
and its royal families, but few are
looking for clues to shed light on
rural life in ancient times.
"We're piecing together the his
tory of this mountainous border
region and looking at how settle
ments have changed from Neolit
hic to Modern times," said Mary
Lou.
The Stanford project is an
eight-week program during the
summer that includes a two week
study-tour of many ancient sites
in Greece and six weeks of field
work.
Students participate in the
study of the Skourta valley, not
digging but using a technique the
Munns call "field surveying." This
entails walking through areas
carefully laid out on a detailed
map and parching for signs of
ancient civilization such as pot
tery sherds, building foundations
and coins.
"I got letters from my friends
all summer asking me how the
digging was going, although we
weren't digging at all. . . . ancient
material is just lying around on
the surface of the ground," said
Jennifer Gurton, a junior major
ing in Human Biology and partic
ipant in the program this past
summer.
"We went everywhere. We
walked through plowed fields,
vineyards, up steep slopes,
through prickly oak and evil
thistles that were at least five feet

tall — because they were barely
smaller than I am," said Katia
Kubicek, a junior majoring in
Classics.
The Munns emphasized that ex
cavation is a very costly operation
and offers a detailed view of only
a small area, whereas field sur
veying offers a fairly accurate and
detailed description of the activi
ties throughout a much wider ex
panse.
Although the Skourta Plain
Project is slated for completion
after next summer, the Munns
have plans to take Stanford stu
dents in 1991 to excavate Panak
ton.
"There are many monument
bases around the area in which
the inscription was found, which
seems to suggest an important
public building or temple, which
is where inscriptions are often set
up," Mark said.
"We know from other ancient
inscriptions that there is a Temple
of Apollo at Panakton, and thAt
could very probably be the ruins
of the temple. We hope to find
more inscriptions, discover the
temple of Apollo and learn more
about garrison life of the cadets
in the distant past," he added.
"It's a nice coincidence that this
inscription which records the
graduation of group of youths
that spent their time marching
about the countryside was discov
ered by a group of Stanford stu
dents, the same age, who
spent their summer doing the
same thing. It's kind of a bridge
across time," Munn said.


The ancient marble inscription, dated around 330 8.C., was found
in Panakton by the Stanford-in-Greece program this summer. The
artifact, which verifies the location of the ancient fortress of Panak
ton, is a decree honoring a core of 19-year- old Athenian soldiers.

Classics Prof. Mark Munn displays where his discovery had originally stood. Munn theorizes that
the ruins where the inscription was found might have been the ancient Temple of Apollo.
