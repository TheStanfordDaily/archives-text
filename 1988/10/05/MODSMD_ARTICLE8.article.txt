Summer has always been a
season for discovery, but for nine
Stanford students discovery
meant finding a 2,300-year old in
scription verifying the location of
the frontier fortress of Panakton.
Actually, the ancient marble in
scription was found by Classics
Prof. Mark Munn, co-director of
the Stanford-in-Greece summer
program.
After careful study, Munn, and
his wife Mary Lou, the other co

honoring a core of 19-year-old At

"There are ruins of several forts
north of Athens, and for centuries
scholars have argued over which
is Panakton," Munn said.
"We always thought that the
fort above the Skourta Plain was

inscription, which is Athenian,

now proves that this definitely is
Panakton," Munn added.
Panakton was first mentioned
in ancient texts by Thucydides
when the Spartans and Athenians
returned captured land to one an
other, resulting in a peace treaty
during the Peloponnesian War
(421 8.C.).
Although most of the ruined
buildings at Panakton that com
mand the Skourta plain today are
Frankish (1400 A.D.), the Munns
have traced human settlement
back to the Neolithic Period
(6000-4000 8.C.).
The fragment of the cut marble
inscription has bits of 26 lines,
but no complete sentences. "It's
