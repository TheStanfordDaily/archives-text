# Universal ID cards set for arrival by fall 1991

After years of waiting, Stanford faculty,
staff and students can look forward to the
release of a universal identification card by
fall of 1991.
"I anticipate that there will be a variety
of uses for the card," said Registrar Sally
Mahoney, whose office will issue the cards.
"But the one that is clearest" is checking
out library books, she said. Students might
also be able to use the cards for charging
University Food Service and Tresidder Un
ion meals and for paying registration fees.
David Weber, director of University Li
braries, said that his office plans to estab
lish automated circulation in the Branner
Earth Sciences and Meyer libraries by fall
1991 and in all University libraries by 1993.
Automated circulation will allow students
to, among other things, use Socrates to
locate books that have been checked out.
The library plans hinge on the
Registrar's Office issuing the machine
readable cards. Mahoney explained that
there would not be a universal card soon
because "the authority files and infrastruc
ture that support it" must be developed
once its uses are negotiated.

Council of Presidents member Stacey
Leyton questioned whether introduction
should take three years. "It (the ID card)
is a student need that hasn't been met for
a long time," Leyton said. "We will cer
tainly try to investigate how long it will
take to add all the functions."
"It's about time that it happened," said
Miguel Marquez, also a COP member.
"Everybody wants it. . . . It's something
that many student slates have run on."
Last year's COP, the Equalizers, lobbied
strongly for a universal ID. The Energizers,
which lost a close election to A New Slate
of Mind, used a call for the ID cards as a
key campaign plank.
Mitch Steinberger, a member of the
Energizers and one of three students on
the University Library Committee, said,
"I'm very pleased. Now we have a definite
date that we will have at least a somewhat
integrated ID card and a library check-out
that will be 400 percent faster."
University Libraries system is cooperat
ing with the Crown Law Library and the
Hoover institute Archives and Library to
jointly install two automation programs,
NOTIS and RECON. Lane Medi
cal Library is implementing its
own system.
NOTIS, a $3.2 million
automated processing system, will
enable card-holders to check out
books without filling out individ
ual forms. The new system will

also provide instant information
about the location and status of
books and serials.
Card catalogs will be phased out
as RECON, designed to transfer
card records to computer, is com
pleted. "The days of the card cat
alog . . . are numbered," Weber
said.
Stanford libraries proposed a
separate automation program
three years ago that would have

speeded up their modernization
and the release of machine
readable ID cards, but the financ
ing for the proposal was inade
quate, according to Provost James
Rosse.
Rosse said the earlier proposal
had "unanswered questions" and
was "put together in a hurry."
Weber agreed, "NOTIS is a better
system . . . with appropriate
financing."
NOTIS "has been the system
of choice for major research libra
ries over the last three years,"
added Weber. Schools that have
adopted all or part of the system
include Northwestern, Harvard,
Yale, Johns Hopkins and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania.
Asked why Stanford lagged be
hind other institutions in imple
menting the automation program,
Weber said, "Each university has
a different set of local circum
stances. . . . It's not easy to change
a system."
