## Debaters clash on experience Exchange centers on Quayle's readiness, JFK comparison 
### 
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Republican vice pres
idential candidate Dan Quayle said last night
he has as much experience as John F. Kennedy
did when he won the White House and that
he is "prepared to lead this country" if nec
essary. "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy,"
Democratic rival Lloyd Bentsen shot back in
a most riveting moment of a prime-time cam
paign debate.
"That was really uncalled for," the 41-year
old Quayle retorted angrily to his 67-year-old
rival. Replied Bentsen: "You're the one that
was making the comparison, senator . . . and
1 did not think the comparison was well
taken."
The clash over Quayle's readiness for high
office was the emotional climax of a high
stakes debate in which the vice presidential
candidates also collided over the environment,
Social Security and campaign reform. The two
men aimed many of their best lines past each
other and in the direction of presidential can
didates George Bush and Michael Dukakis.
The encounter came with five weeks remain

ing in a close campaign for the White House,
and with polls suggesting that Quayle is cos
ting Bush precious support.
Both men used the debate to stress well
rehearsed campaign themes.
Bentsen accused the Republicans of trying
to cut Social Security in the past and said
they are likely to try again if they win the
White House this year. Quayle shot back that
the Democrats were trying to "scare the older
people of this country."
Bentsen said the Reagan administration had
appointed high-level environmental officials
who were the equivalent of Bonnie and Clyde.
But Quayle brought up Boston Harbor, ac
cusing Dukakis of allowing a major environ
mental problem to fester a few blocks from
his Statehouse office.
Republicans looked to the debate to erase
doubts about the No. 2 man on the ticket,
while Democrats hoped to reinforce them.
"This guy under tremendous fire . . . came
through with flying colors," Bush told
reporters in his hotel suite in Fort Worth.

"Now people can see what I've seen all along."
Dukakis offered his evaluation at a rowdy
Boston rally with supporters. "The most im
portant qualification for the vice president is
that he's ready at a moment's notice to assume
the presidency of the United States. Tonight
Lloyd Bentsen demonstrated that he was the
only one on that stage who's ready."
All six debate judges who scored the contest
for The Associated Press picked Bentsen as
the winner by an overall margin of 148-125.
A perfect score was 180. Melissa Wade, the
director of forensics at Emory University in
Atlanta, said Bentsen picked up momentum
after he told Quayle, "You're no Jack Ken
nedy."
The subject of experience ran through the
entire debate.
Quayle said he has more experience in cri
tical areas than Democrat Dukakis and added,
"If qualifications alone are going to be the
issue in this campaign, George Bush has more
qualifications than Michael Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen combined."
