# Party shake-up in Yugoslavia

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) â€” Communist
Party chief Stipe Suvar called for a shake-up in the
ruling Politburo and the policy-setting Central Com
mittee after weeks of ethnic and economic protests,
state-run media said yesterday.
About 5,000 workers marched on Parliament on
yesterday for the second straight day. Workers have
stepped up strikes and demonstrations over the
communist government's failure to reduce 217 per
cent inflation and unemployment, which is at 15
percent.
Radio Belgrade said 140,000 Serbs attended two
rallies in central Serbia to push demands for greater
Serbian control over the autonomous provinces of
Kosovo and Vojvodina, where ethnic Albanians out
number Serbs.
Thousands more flag-waving Serbs attended a
similar rally in Novi Sad, 42 miles north of the
capital, according to Radio Belgrade and the state
run Tanjug news agency. Crowd estimates ranged
from 30,000 to 80,000.
Suvar said Tuesday night that the 162-member
Central Committee probably will vote on personnel
changes in the Politburo on Oct. 17 in a session
expected to be a major showdown between factions
in the party leadership. State newspapers reported
his comments yesterday.
He said the Politburo will meet before Oct. 17
"to determine the criteria of possible responsibility
of its members" for the country's worst economic
and political crisis since World War 11.
"If it fails in this, the Central Committee will
assume this role, and anyone who does not win
two-thirds of the committee's votes will have to
leave the presidium (Politburo)," he said.
As the top body of Yugoslavia's only political
party, the Politburo is the most powerful institution
in the country. It has 23 members, but two resigned
last week under mounting criticism.
Suvar also said about one-third of the Central
Committee membership will be changed by the end
of the autumn.
Suvar announced that a similar "cadre renewal"
was expected in the party leaderships of Yugoslavia's
six republics and two autonomous provinces.
Yugoslavs have become increasingly vocal in de
manding top-level personnel changes. Leaders have
been blamed for failing to defuse tensions between
the mostly Christian Serbian minority and the
largely Moslem Albanian majority in Kosovo.
In addition to high inflation and double-digit un
employment, the country has a $21 billion foreign
debt.
Yugoslav and foreign observers believe per
sonnel changes at the Oct. 17 meeting will be aimed
at reducing tensions between different factions
within the party.
