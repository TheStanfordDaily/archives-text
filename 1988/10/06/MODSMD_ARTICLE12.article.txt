FORT WORTH, Texas, (AP) — George Bush
praised running mate Dan Quayle's performance in
the nationally televised debate last night with rival
Lloyd Bentsen, saying Quayle hit a "home run" on
his first answer.
"He's doing good, good opening, strong opening,
right out of the ball park, the Canseco of American
politics," Bush told reporters, referring to Oakland
A's baseball player Jose Canseco. "He hit it the
first answer, home run."
Asked if the question to Quayle — a Republican
senator from Indiana — on criticisms of his
qualifications was a fair one, Bush replied, "Every
thing's fair in this business. ... I'd like to get a
slow ball like that in the first one. It's easy."
The vice president, who had arrived at his hotel
here in time to watch Quayle take on Bentsen, a
Democratic senator from Texas, had invited
reporters to watch the first question with him.
"Deja vu . . . same podiums we used," Bush com
mented, referring to his debate with Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
