SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - Military
President Augusto Pinochet held a
dwindling lead in partial, government
counted returns and a much larger
opposition tally had him trailing badly
in yesterday's plebiscite on whether
his 15-year rule should be extended to
1997.
The opposition claimed victory.
The turnout was massive and peace
ful, but as vote-counting proceeded,
Pinochet hinted to reporters of possible
street violence and police and army
units began to patrol the streets in
large numbers.
A parallel count by a 16-party op
position coalition on returns from 44.9
percent of all voting tables reporting
tallied to 57.8 percent of the vote say
ing "no" to continuing Pinochet's
presidency to 39.9 percent saying
"yes." The opposition challenged the
government to compare returns.
In Interior Ministry returns from
676 of the 22,248 voting tables nation
wide, "yes" votes totaled 95,668, or
51.3 percent, and "no" votes totaled
86,746, or 46.5 percent, with 2,024
blank votes and 2,066 votes voided for
being wrongly marked.

Interior Ministry undersecretary Al
berto Cardemil said the ministry total
included tables throughout Chile.
Cardemil appeared grim while an
nouncing the late-evening totals,
which gave Pinochet a much slimmer
lead than earlier ministry returns.
Several government officials, who
had been smiling and chatting with
reporters earlier in the day, disap
peared from the auditorium where
ministry returns were being an
nounced.
The opposition coalition said its
count showed the "no" vote ahead by
1,887,664 votes to 1,301,207 - 57.8
percent to 39.9 percent— with 1.3 per
cent of the ballots voided and about
one percent blank. No exact figures
for void and blank votes were given.
Patricio Aylwin, president of the
Christian Democratic Party and
spokesman for the coalition, declared,
"It's clear that the majority of
Chileans have voted no."
Chileans voted on a proposal by
Pinochet and other military com
manders that he remain president un
til 1997. The right-wing, 72-year-old
army chief seized power in a bloody

coup in 1973 that ousted the 3-year-old
elected government of President Sal
vador Allende, a Marxist who died dur
ing the takeover.
If most voted "yes," Pinochet would
assume a new 8-year term in March.
If most voted "no," an open presiden
tial election would be held late next
year and the winner would assume
power in March 1990, with Pinochet
remaining in power until then.
Aylwin accused the government of
holding back some results and called
the ministry's announced count "in
sufficient and distorted." He chal
lenged the ministry to compare its
results table by table with those of
the coalition.
Coalition secretary-general Genaro
Arriagada accused the ministry of
trying to mislead voters and said: "For
their exemplary behavior the people
deserve more respect."
There was a two-hour delay between
the time the first ministry results were
announced and an update.
Military patrols in armored person
nel carriers and trucks with mounted
machine guns were seen circulating in
working-class neighborhoods and

slums — where anti-Pinochet senti
ment traditionally runs high — that
ring the capital. A few hundred people
danced in the streets of La Victoria
slum in southern Santiago, waving
banners and celebrating an anticipated
"no" victory.
"We all voted no, because we are
repressed," said one participant, 50-
year-old construction worker Jose Gar
rido.
Jorge Zincke, military commander
for the Santiago area, reported scat
tered incidents after the voting, which
he said were being controlled by police.
He said anti-government demonstra
tors erected barricades in the streets
of San Bernardo, south of the capital,
and Puente Alto, to the southeast. He
said six people were arrested for car
rying arms and a public bus was
burned and its driver beaten.
Santiago's streets were mainly
empty as most Chileans heeded oppo
sition calls to stay at home.
A huge turnout among the 7.4 mil
lion registered voters slowed balloting
at many polling places and could delay
definitive tallies, authorities said.
