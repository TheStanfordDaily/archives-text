# China seeks trade, summits with rivals

### 
BEIJING (AP) â€” China has set a course toward
reconciliation with old adversaries, talking sum
mitry with the Soviet Union and India and making
economic deals with South Korea.
In what appear to be breakthroughs after years
of talks, China is sending Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen to Moscow and preparing for a visit by Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India. Both events could
occur before year's end.
Qian, the first Chinese foreign minister to make
a working visit to the Soviet Union since Chou
En-lai in 1956, is expected to lay the groundwork
for the first Chinese-Soviet summit since Nikita
Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1959.
A summit would effectively normalize relations,
which have been difficult since Nikita Khrushchev
and Mao Tse-tung split in 1960 over ideological
differences and leadership of the Communist world.
Relations reached bottom with border fighting in
1969.
China's diplomatic impasse with India is just as
old Heads of government met last when Chou, as
premier, visited New Delhi in 1960, and the last
Indian prime minister who traveled to Beijing was
Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954.
The two most populous nations in the world have
been at odds because of India's pro-Soviet stance,
close Chinese ties with Pakistan and a border feud
that led to fighting in 1962.
Beijing also is forging new ties with another
former enemy in war, South Korea. Direct and
indirect trade could double to the equivalent of $3
billion this year and Shandong province, facing
South Korea across the Yellow Sea, recently agreed
to an exchange of trade offices with South Korea.
South Korean auto and electronics makers plan
to invest in Chinese plants, and tourists from South
Korea are being welcomed to China. Formal diplo
matic ties are unlikely soon, however, because China

remains close to North Korea, its economically
moribund ally in the Korean War of 1950-53.
Qian, the foreign minister, said in a recent inter
view that economic ties with South Korea were
"only natural" as China opened up its coastal areas.
The mood of detente also extends to Japan, a
frequent object of Chinese criticism despite its role
as a mi\jor trading partner and chief source of
financial aid.
Japanese officials in Beijing note a marked re
duction over the past year in Chinese warnings
about a resurgence in Japanese militarism or
Japan's tendency to forget crimes it committed in
World War 11. Both nations called the visit by Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan in August the
beginning of a "new era" in relations.
Senior leader Deng Xiaoping has said since gaining
power a decadc ago that China needs peace on its
borders to achieve economic development. China
began border talks with India in 1981 and negoti
ations with Moscow in 1982.
Little progress has been made in either forum.
The possibility of Gandhi and Mikhail Gorbachev
standing on the Great Wall owes more to the more
relaxed state of the world.
U.S.-Soviet disarmament agreements, moves to
settle wars in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf,
and prospects for peace in Angola, Cambodia and
other areas appear to have given China more room
to maneuver.
"Dialogue is taking the place of confrontation and
the tendency to seek peaceful settlement of inter
national disputes is growing," Qian said in a recent
address to the U.N. General Assembly.
A Western diplomat said: "The Chinese may see
the world as less dangerous to their interests. If
you don't have to use a lot of energy to protect
yourself, it gives you more flexibility "
