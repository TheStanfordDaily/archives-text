COLA formula OK, says official
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Reagan adminis
tration sees no need to change the formula for
calculating cost-of-living increases for Social Se
curity and other entitlements despite claims that
millions of beneficiaries are being shortchanged.
White House Hudget Director .James Miller 111
yesterday said it "would make no difference" in
what the government spends on those increases
if one Labor Department consumer price index
were subsituted for another in figuring the in
creases.
But in a written statement to the Senate Special
Committee on Aging, Miller said, "I do not believe
any changes are needed at the present time."
The panel's chairman. Sen. John Meleher, D-
Mont., has introduced two bills that would im
mediately substitute one inflation survey for the
other in calculating benefit increases and spend
$1.5 million to develop a new survey devoted
only to price changes experienced by the elderly.
Algerians riot against inflation
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Hundreds of youths
rioting against inflation virtually took over the
capital's central district yesterday, setting cars
ablaze and breaking shop windows while police
looked on, witnesses reported.
The rioters, mostly schoolboys and university
students, were protesting a constantly increasing
cost of living and consequent reductions in real
wages.
Algeria has been hit by several strikes recently
and new ones were reported yesterday at the
offices of the carrier Air Algerie, the post office

and in various industries.
Gangs of several hundred youngsters were seen
overturning cars and setting them afire on the
main shopping streets, Didouche Mourad and
Mohamed Ben M'Hidi.
They broke windows of shops and government
owned department stores and attacked the infor
mation office of the Polisario independence move
ment of the Western Sahara.
One group of rioters stopped a bus, made the
driver get out and then broke all the windows,
witnesses reported. The offices of the West Ger
man airline Lufthansa and the Czechoslovak air
line CSA were wrecked, as were many shops that
did not get their metal curtains down quickly.
MIA seekers' fate unknown
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - The U.S. Em
bassy in Laos said yesterday it is trying to de
termine the fate of two Americans arrested after
they tried to advertise a $2.4 million reward for
the return of U.S. soldiers in Indochina.
An embassy spokesman, contacted by telephone
in Vientiane, said the embassy received no re
sponse to a note sent to the Laotian Foreign
Ministry asking about the status of the Ameri
cans, who were seized by authorities Sunday.
Donna Long, 45, and James Copp, 43, had
planned to float thousands of dollars down the
Mekong River offering the reward to any Laotian,
Cambodian or Vietnamese who brought an Amer
ican prisoner of war to the International Red
Cross.
The two had also planned to cross to the
Laotian bank of the boundary-marking river and
advertise the award to local villagers.
