Replacing the senate
chair tonight means
breaking the bylaws

Know the rules of the
game. It's a simple credo
for any sport, but the lesson
should also be learned by the ASSU
Senate.
The student's legislative body
traditionally finds itself befuddled
by its own rules. This time it's the
ASSU Constitution and bylaws.
The bylaws themselves are un
fortunately complicated, confusing
and sometimes contradictory, but
that should not debilitate the sen
ate, as it did numerous times last
year. If the senate reads, knows
and deciphers the bylaws ahead of
time, the group could finally bring
about smooth resolutions to their
conflicts concerning procedure.
The first test of the 19th senate's
ability will come tonight, and that
test may be the most difficult. The
body will have to elect a new senate
chair now that graduate student
Richard Vaughan has suddenly
resigned from the position.
Vaughan has called for an ex
ception to the bylaws in order to
choose a new chair tonight, and he
has decided to chair the meeting
himself. However, no bylaw specif
ically mentions what to do if the
chair resigns, so the senate must
apply the bylaw nearest in mean
ing.
The bylaws discuss the absence,
disability or removal of a chair.
Since Vaughan's step-down is of a
permanent nature, a "self
removal," the most appropriate
bylaw to follow would be the one
concerning removal. It states:
"Upon removal [of the senate
chairj the deputy chair shall as
sume the office of the chair and
arrange for the election of a new

chair at the next meeting of the
senate." (Article 11, Section 3,
D.3.b.)
Vaughan's request exemplifies
the senate's general disregard for
the bylaws. With a little effort, the
current problem can be cleared up
within the scope of the current
bylaws, thereby retaining the in
tegrity of the senate's rules and
preventing complications that have
occurred in past years.
Vaughan's belief that he should
chair the meeting derives from an
other bylaw which states, "The
chair of the former regular session
of the senate shall serve as the
chair of the next regular session
of the senate until that body has
elected a chair." (Article 11, Section
3, D.2.b.) However, since this
bylaw only relates to selections be
tween sessions, the "removal" pro
cedures still hold the most weight.
Another problem exists.
According to a separate bylaw,
all chair candidates must declare
in writing at least five days in ad
vance of the selection meeting. Any
member of the student body has
the right to apply. However,
Vaughan's declaration of resigna
tion was made public Tuesday. And
although Vaughan has suspended
the bylaws for tonight's meeting
so that anyone may declare his or
her candidacy, 48 hours is hardly
enough time.
One final suggestion. The senate
must discuss the $1,000 salary
Vaughan was supposed to receive
for his summer work as senate
chair. The senate should consider
whether the salary should be paid,
in light of the resignation and con
sidering the amount of work
Vaughan actually did.
There is a simple solution to the
current bylaw muddle. Vaughan
should chair tonight's meeting,
step down afterward and allow the
chair to be selected at the next
senate meeting, which should be
led by deputy chair Aimee Allison.
