## Patriotism is tribalism 
### 
THE AFRICAN NATION of
Burundi is again experiencing mas
sacres of the majority Hutu people
by the minority Tutsi. The government
is Tutsi, and they report that the mas
sacres grew out of attacks on the Tutsi
by the Hutu. Twenty-thousand are
thought dead. Thirty-five thousand Hutu
have fled to nearby Rwanda.
The Tutsi, a sleek and exotic people
who herded animals, swept down from
the North some four centuries ago. They
also herded the Hutu under their control,
establishing domination in a feudal sys
tem. The colonization of the area by Eu
ropean powers did little to change this
hierarchy. In the early sixties and
seventies, the Tutsi army ruthlessly
crushed Hutu rebellions.
This is often called tribalism, this
African struggle for power. At least that's
the way the West portrays the struggle
between two peoples of different origins,
languages, and customs. But tribalism is
a colletive manifestation of the forces of
assertion, aggression and defense incited
by race, and religion and an ideological
communal identity.
This is a common commitment we iden
tify in ourselves as patriotism.
In this light, it is interesting that the
campaign for the presidency has focused
some attention on patriotism. The neo
conservatives and the liberals, in their
ferocious and intolerant war, have arrived
at the Pledge of Allegiance and the po
litical question of which candidate can
appear more patriotic, that's to say more
tribal, than the other. And George Bush
seems to be winning this battle, citing
Michael Dukakis' veto of a bill mandating

recital of the Pledge of Allegiance in Mas
sachusetts schools as a sign of his lack
of conviction in American ideals.
Among the political cognoscenti, how
ever, Bush's attacks are somewhat of a
joke, if only because they are so shallow.
If his attacks are truly concerned with
the "American Way", then they cannot
be about amber waves of grain, because
they have those in Canada. And they
shouldn't be about "freedom", because
freedom is certainly not found in the
recitation of a loyalty oath upon com
mand. They had that kind of freedom in
Nazi Germany. American freedom should
mean the right not to pledge allegiance
if you don't want to.
No. Bush's patriotism lies far afield of
the ideals our forefathers had in mind.
His patriotism comes from, and is for,
one of the two ideologies that erupted
early in our history. And in defending
this ideology, he is resorJLing to emotions
(ugly ones). He certainly doesn't rely on
pertinent issues. Even if the Pledge of
Allegiance were still would
be a state-level issue.
Within Bush's ideological camp,
though, things get scarier. At the Repub
lican Convention, Pat Robertson
portrayed the ACLU as a product of
diabolical sabotage of the American Way.
This is a group that supports unpopular
minorities, a group that tries protecting
everyone's freedom. If Pat Robertson,
being a man of the Word, hates the Devil,
his opinion can only be attributed to an
allegiance of assertion and aggression and
defense of ideology, devoid of reason (rea
son cannot abide hatred). He might have
differences with the liberal leadership of

the ACLU, but to insinuate demonism
in the pursuit of liberties exhibits the
most fundamental form of tribalism.
Indeed, the whole effort on the part of
the Republicans to characterize liberals
as bogeymen with the Pledge business,
the ACLU attack and the furlough non
sense, is simply an effort to induce a
fever of "us" vs. "them" miyoritarianism.
Sadly, this tactic works. It is never
hard to invoke the emotions of normal
people against "others." It links you with
the tribe, defining the degree of your
belongedness by that of your intolerance.
Between the United States and Europe
and within each of these two groups,
sources of conflict are ostensibly due to
differences of ideology. Ideology, witn its
origin in a set of ideas, is unique to
civilized man. It is the tribalism of the
intellectual, as this campaign battle at
tests to.
Again, it is odd that the U.S. cannot
understand what is happening in
Burundi. What they abhor in Africans at
a racial level, prides themselves on at
the ideological level. But it is all the same
thing.
Ideology, what separates us from bar
barism, is the debasement of ideas to suit
the primal urge to belong to a tribe —
the urge to hate.
