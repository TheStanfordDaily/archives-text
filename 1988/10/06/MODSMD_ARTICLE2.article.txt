# Senate may annul rules
## Chair wants to set aside bylaws to elect replacement 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
ASSU Senate Chair Richard Vaughan
will seek to suspend the ASSU Bylaws
tonight so that the senate can elect his
successor, starting the senate's year off on
an unusual note.
If the bylaws are suspended, any student
who wants to run for the position will be
considered. The meeting is scheduled for
7:05 p.m. in Law School Room 180.
The bylaws require that declarations for
candidacy come no fewer five days before
the meeting when the election is scheduled.
Vaughan did not publicly reveal his inten
tion to resign until The Daily reported
Tuesday — two duys ago — that he would
step down.
He sent a letter Friday to ASSU senators
announcing that he would resign and dis
cussed the resignation at the ASSU retreat
over the weekend.
At least two senators, junior Dana Klap
per and graduate student David Porter,
have notified Vaughan that they intend to
run. Klapper declared her candidacy Friday
at the ASSU retreat, immediately after
Vaughan's announcement. Porter made his
declaration the next day.
Porter is identified with the People's
Platform, a coalition of minority student
groups that is influential in the ASSU. His
candidacy was informally supported by the
Platform in last year's elections, but the
Platform does not endorse graduate candi
dates.
In a letter addressed to senate members,
Porter cited his plans to represent the sen
ate "in an unbiased way" by serving as a
"facilitator for all senators in their at
tempts to address the issues and concerns
of their constituents."
He has served as a member of the Council
of Presidents and is a former chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee.
Klapper is a former chair of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau Associate Committee and
was a member last year of the President's
Commission on Investment Responsibility,
which she said left her with the "ability
to talk the administration's language."
Klapper said she is interested in "pre

viding a forum where everyone feels com
fortable presenting their opinions and
everyone is tolerant."
Before a senate chair is selected after
closed debate, Klapper and Senator Frank
Quaratiello, a junior, will introduce legis
lation to exclude everyone but the senate
and its staff from the debate. The legisla
tion is designed to exclude members of the
ASSU executive branch — the COF, ASSU
business manager and ASSU administra
tive manager — who customarily sit with
the senate in closed session.
Klapper said she feels it is necessary to
exclude the COP because the chair is the
senate's liason to the outside world and
the COP, being "part of that outside
world," should not have a say in the chair's
election.
Porter said he feels that it is "uncon
stitutional" to exclude the COP and finan-
cial planner since they are "in
reality" part of the senate. "It
would seem unusual to have a
meeting open only to some mem
bers," he said.

The ASSU Bylaws do not
specify a procedure in the event
of a senate chair's resignation. In
the event of a chair's forcible
removal by the senate, the bylaws
state that "the deputy chair shall
assume the office of the chair and
arrange for the election of a new
chair at the next meeting of the

senate."
Vaughan will designate his res
ignation as pending the appoint
ment of a successor and will thus
be presiding over the meeting and
debate to elect a new chair, rather
than handing over control of the
meeting to the deputy chair, soph
omore Aimee Allison.
