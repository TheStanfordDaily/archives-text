Think tank should
come under normal
academic control
What is "the Hoover problem" and
why should members of the Stanford
community care about it?
The problem of Hoover is that a
politically-active think tank and a non
partisan university make a bad mar
riage. The mission of one is politics;
the mission of the other is education.
When Herbert Hoover in 1959 defined
the Hoover Institution's mission as
"exposing the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx," and millions of dollars
poured into Hoover, something was
created here that should not be here.
Members of the Stanford community
should care about the issue because as
long as Hoover exists at Stanford as
an independent, politically-active think
tank, the University will continue to be
embroiled in damaging political contro
versy.
The problem of Hoover may be
clearly seen by imagining affluent
liberals offering a university $110 mil
lion (Hoover's current endowment) to
establish an independent Franklin
Delano Roosevelt Institution for Social
Justice. All the university has to do
for the money is look the other way
while the FDR Institution promotes
liberal causes.
No self-respecting university would
accept such money, but over the past
25 years just such an institution has
been built at Stanford.
Is an institution which finances a
large public relations effort to
propagandize for a particular ideology,
which actively promotes the advance
ment of particular political candidates
and which can lay claim to the title of
"leading conservative think tank in the
country compatible with a university
whose professed values are the nonpar
tisan, nonpolitical, objective search for
truth?

Hoover's defense includes ad
hominem attacks on those who speak
out; claims that liberals are merely out
to get conservatives; warnings that if
Hoover and Stanford divorce the Uni
versity will lose valuable assets, includ
ing Hoover library and archives; and
the argument that Stanford is so
liberal that Hoover is needed for politi
cal balance. Hoover supporters fre
quently draw an analogy between Hoo
ver's political activities and Harvard
scholars who served the Kennedy Ad
ministration.
Reducing the Hoover problem to a
political fight between liberals and con
servatives is invalidated by the FDR
example; no such institution as Hoover
— left, right or center — has any place
on a university campus.

.. .with or without W.
Glenn Campbell as Direc
tor of Hoover, the Hoover
problem will remain a
source of embarrassment
to the University.

In assessing costs, a distinction must
be made between the Hoover library
and the political arm of Hoover. Hoo
ver existed as a library and archive for
decades before a political think tank
was established. Moreover, Stanford
pays the bulk of Hoover's library ex
penses. Hoover might conjure the
images of taking the library holding
elsewhere, but such an attempt would
quickly involve the law. Hoover's books
and manuscripts do not belong to the
political arm of Hoover or to W. Glenn
Campbell; hence, there is no reason to
think Stanford will lose the archives if
the political arm of Hoover is brought
under control.
The analogy between Hoover's politi
cal activities and Harvard professors
who worked for John Kennedy col-

lapses when it is remembered that the
Harvard Government Department is
not an independent think tank with a
political mission. The Harvard Govern
ment Department is a regular part of
Harvard. As such, the propriety of
what individual professors do is up to
them and Harvard. Stanford has no
such control over Hoover scholars.
Far from needing Hoover for political
"balance," Hoover's political activities
— and the Insitution's unsparing at
tacks on the University — undermine
the University's reputation. However
one evaluates Hoover's scholarship, the
Institution's political connections unde
niably involve Stanford in controversy.
When objections to such involvement
are heard, Hoover scholars publicly
attack Stanford in the national media
as a place where "liberal fascists" and
"crazies" trample free speech and
greedy administrators jealously covet
Hoover's resources. Hoover Fellow
George Marotta went so far as to in
vestigate the personal voting records of
over 500 Stanford faculty, and then
used this information to tar the Uni
versity as politically biased.
Political attacks on Stanford by those
who enjoy a priviledged position within
the University damage the University's
reputation and depreciate the value of
a Stanford education. Normally, the
University would look to the Presi
dent's office for advice. But in this
case, Donald Kennedy's solution is to
bring Stanford and Hoover closer to
gether while guaranteeing Hoover's
continued independence. This ensures
that with or without W. Glenn Camp
bell as Director of Hoover, the Hoover
problem will remain a source of em
barassment to the University.
The Hoover Institution was made
into an independent political think
tank, and it can be unmade. As
surances of Hoover's independence
from faculty control were extracted
from the Stanford Trustees by Herbert
Hoover. These agreements must be
changed if the Hoover Institution is to
be brought under control. This is why

57 faculty members have signed a peti
tion calling for discussion of placing
Hoover under normal academic gover
nance, or failing that, severing connec
tions between the institutions.
Legitimate scholars at Hoover have
nothing to fear from normal academic
governance. If some at Hoover are
unwilling to submit to regular univer
sity procedures, then they should be
invited to move their operation off
campus. Only normal academic gover
nance will end the inherent conflict
between a partisan think tank and a
nonpartisan university, and only nor
mal academic governance will protect
Stanford's reputation as a fully
legitimate academic institution.

Open debate would
not interfere with
union negotiations
In The Daily of Oct. 3, a letter ap
peared from the Stanford legal office
attorney Michael Vartain, in which he
refused invitations to debate with the
Stanford Workers Union.
In that letter the legal office claims
it cannot debate because it would com
promise their "good faith bargaining."
We disagree with this. A debate
about labor relation principles and
issues would not interfere with collec
tive bargaining.
We are disappointed in the legal
office's refusal to debate because we
believe the communication process
between the USW and the University
needs to be more open, rather than
closed. USW has accepted the request
of all student groups to debate because
we think such a debate would be truly
educational for the community. We
hope the legal office reconsiders.
