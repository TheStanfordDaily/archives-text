## 'Fetal rights' place unborn children in conflict with mothers 
### 
IMAGINE BEING SHACKLED to an
operating table and forced to undergo
surgery. Imagine that your "doctor's
orders" suddenly turned into a court or
der. This could happen to you ... if you
are a woman who becomes pregnant and
decides not to abort.
Already, at least one woman has been
shackled to an operating table to receive
her court ordered cesarean section. An
article in the New England Journal of
Medicine (May 7, 1987) reports that of
15 court orders sought for cesarean sec
tions, 13 were granted. This case and
others reflect a growing tendency for
third parties and the state to assert so
called "fetal rights" in order to control
the behavior of pregnant women.
At issue is the question of who will
have ultimate decision making power
over women's bodies - women or doctors?

In no other situation is one person ever
forced to undergo a medical procedure
for the benefit of another person. In a
1978 case, the court refused to order a
man to donate bone marrow to save his
cousin's life, noting that, "to compel the
Defendant to submit to an intrusion of
his body would . . . defeat the sanctity of
the individual and would impose a rule
which would know no limits and one
could not imagine where the line would
be drawn."
Where will the line be drawn on fetal
rights? If women cannot refuse medical
advice regarding operations, then what
about advice that apparently poses less
risk or invasion, such as advice on
smoking during pregnancy? In fact, crim
inal charges were filed against a San
Diego woman alleging that her failure to
follow a doctor's advice during pregnancy,

although she was under no legal obliga
tion to do so, resulted in the brain damage
and eventual death of her child. The
charges were eventually dropped, but not
before she had spent six days in jail and
had descriptions of hpr kpx life spread
throughout the national media in lurid
detail.
The arguments put forward suggesting
that fetal rights supercede maternal
rights are based on the idea that a wom
an's ultimate purpose in life is to bear
and raise children, that women are first
and foremost baby incubators. Our soci
ety subscribes to an ideal of womanhood
in which females should be ready to
sacrifice anything and everything for the
sake of children or prospective children,
and should consider everyone else's needs
before their own. To the extent that
women don't conform to this ideal they
are seen as unnatural, deficient and

downright immoral. Women who refuse
recommended cesarean sections smoke,
drink, have intercourse, or work long
hours during pregnancy are portrayed as
vicious, selfish, irresponsible child
abusers who are probably incapable of
making reasoned decisions. Recent
technological advances which allow med
ical professionals to monitor, visualize
and even operate on fetuses, have given
rise to a new concept of "fetal rights" in
which the fetus is portrayed as essentially
separate from, and in conflict with, the
mother. While this may appear to be a
new ethical dilemma, it actually repre
sents the resurrection of historic argu
ments for curtailing women's economic
and personal autonomy on the basis of
their actual or potential status as mothers
and child-bearers. Out of "respect" for
the "special burdens" of womanhood,
women's rights to vote, to be employed

outside the home and to serve on juries
have, at one time or another, been
restricted by the courts. The majority
of women who choose to carry a preg
nancy to term undoubtedly are concerned
that they give birth to the healthiest
child possible. In most cases, what is best
for the mother will also be best for the
fetus. But the decisions a woman makes
while pregnant must reflect the total cir
cumstances of her life, and not simply
the needs of the fetus. The provision of
prenatal care for women who cannot af
ford it, shelters for battered women and
treatment centers for addicts would go
much further than court orders toward
guaranteeing the public interest in gen
erally healthy future generations, to say
nothing of the present generation.
