## Grad student helps create new telescope Stanford technology illuminates sun 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
A Stanford graduate student has de
veloped an X-ray telescope able to take
photographs of the sun more clearly than
ever before, and his invention should
enable scientists to understand the sun
in much more detail than currently pos
sible.
The results of the research of applied
physics graduate student Joakim
Lindblom, were published in the current
issue of Science magazine. One of the
spectacular images of the sun taken by
Lindblom's new telescope graces the
cover of the edition.
The photographs were taken during a
rocket launch from White Sands, N.M.
on Oct. 23, 1987. The rocket held nine
telescopes that photographed the solar
corona, the outermost layer of the sun,
in sufficient detail to make calculations
which might help explain the mysterious
forces at work in the outermost region
of the sun.
Scientists have long been stumped by
a number of very basic questions about
the sun's dynamic processes. The ex
treme heat close to the sun makes mea
suring temperatures difficult, and until
now, good solar photographs were un
available.

For instance, scientists do not yet un
derstand the phenomena of polar coronal
plumes, which are column jets of hot
gases erupting from the sun, spewing
solar material thousands of miles out
wards.
Other structures commonly found on
the sun are not yet fully understood.
Physicists do not even know for sure why
the corona, the outermost region of the
sun, equivalent to the earth's atmos
phere, is so much hotter in regions closer
to the sun's core. By the laws of ther
modynamics, scientists would naturally
expect the sun to be cooler farther from
the hot solar core.
The sun's core, the hottest furnace in
the solar system, is at a temperature of
about 15 million degrees Kelvin. Further
away from the core, the temperature is
thought to drop to about 6,000 degrees
Kelvin in the region known as the
chromosphere. Above that region, the
gases become distinctly hotter, heating
to perhaps 2 million Kelvin in the out
ermost corona.
At first, scientists offered a theory that
acoustical shock waves emanating from
a turbulent photosphere, the region of
the sun where most of the visible light
comes from, transferred energy to the
coronal gases. Although this is still

thought to occur, scientists doubt that
this explanation could account for the
vast differences in temperature between
the two layers of the sun.
Instead, another theory was put for
ward to explain the heating of the corona.
Solar physicists offered the explanation
that the unraveling of complex magnetic
field lines could cause this much heat.
The sun's magnetic field, caused by
enormous seas of shifting charged parti
cles, is tremendously complex. Enormous
magnetic field lines anchored in the
photosphere are in a loop up through the
corona, confining plasma within the arcs.
Plasma is a superheated gas of free
atomic particles found in the sun.
These photospheric anchors of the mag
netic loop are constantly shifting and
turning around with the random
convection movement of the photospheric
plasma.
As in a string twisting because of the
turning of one of its ends, the magnetic
field lines twist in very complicated ways.
Giant kinks in the magnetic loop form
because of this twisting and because these
kinks are unstable. The field lines recon
nect to simplify the fields, in the process
releasing tremendous amounts of energy.
According to Lindblom, further re
search with his X-ray telescope should
be able to lend some clues as to the
validity of this and other theories about
the dynamics of the sun.
The photos taken from the rocket give
excellent detail of such solar features as
plumes, which spew hot gases from the
sun, the polar coronal holes, which are
huge areas with relatively little matter
at the north and south poles of the sun,
and filaments that show up as dark bands
on the photograph marking relatively cool
spots on the sun.
Lindblom collaborated on and and co
authored the report with Applied Physics
Prof. Arthur Walker Jr., Richard Hoover
of Marshall Space Flight Center and Troy
Barbee of Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory.
Lindblom's device, based on research
funded by NASA, was fired last year from
the White Sands Missile Range on a 45-
foot Nike Black Brant rocket to a max
imum altitude of 179 miles from the
earth's surface.

The rocket's booster stage, the bottom
part that is ejected from the rocket once
it has left earth, was actually surplus
military hardware from the U.S. govern
ment's aborted anti-ballistic missile sys
tem of the 19605, according to Lindblom.
The photos were taken after the eight
foot payload section, which housed the
telescopes, separated from the rocket
after it reached a height of 60 miles from
the earth. The section orients itself to
photograph the sun by using sun sensors
and freon jets for steering control.
The telescope itself was built upon a
technology partially developed by Barbee
while he was a researcher at Stanford.
Barbee developed an extremely thin mul
tilayer coating of the elements silicon and
molybdenum to reflect X-rays, which are
light rays with wavelengths far shorter
than visible light.
To reflect X-ravs from the "multi

layers," Barbee utilized a phenomena of
Bragg scattering in which light of a par
ticular wavelength can be effectively
reflected from a crystal with a definite
spacing between the atomic layers of the
crystal.
Instead of reflecting from crystal
layers, Barbee used "scatterer" layers of
high atomic number separated by a layer
of low atomic number, called a "spacer".
Lindblom used molybdenum layers as the
scatterers and silicon layers as the
spacers.
By using silicon and molybdenum,
Lindblom's telescope is able to reflect
soft X-rays of wavelength 173 angstroms
at "normal incidence," or perpendicular
to the surface of the telescope's two mir
rors.

The above photograph reveals solar features in more detail than any other photo
previously taken of the sun, due to technology designed at Stanford. The picture
was taken from a rocket launched last year, using an X-ray telescope developed
by applied physics graduate student Joakim Lindblom and three other non-
Stanford researchers.
a coating on the mirrors, enables
the mirrors to reflect radiation at
normal incidence," at a
wavelength that previously could
not be reflected, according to
Lindblom.
Other X-ray telescopes, devel
oped at Stanford 40 years ago,
must use a principle called
"grazing" in which the X-rays
graze the surface of the mirror
at an angle of only one or two
degrees. The problems associated
with the grazing technique make
it extremely useful to switch to
the multilayers method.
Among other problems, grazing
optics are outrageously expensive.
According to Lindblom the optics
for the X-ray telescope on the
well-known Skylab satellite cost

in the neighborhood of $1 million.
Also, the low reflecting angle
makes the reflected images ex
tremely susceptible to minute im
perfections in the mirror.
Reflection at angles close to
normal incidence does not suffer
from these problems, and
Lindblom can utilize a standard
reflector telescope, a type that has
been used for hundreds of years
to study the enigmas of space.
Lindblom used his telescope to
study 173 angstrom light from
the sun which corresponds to the
light emitted from iron ions with
eight or nine electrons missing.
Iron ions in this condition are at
about 1,000,000 degrees Kelvin.
By studying solar radiation of
this wavelength or "spectral
regime," along with other radia
tion of a variety of other spectral
regimes, scientists will be able to
piece together a picture of the

violent activity on the sun's "sur
face."
"You can't get all the informa
tion from one spectrum regime,"
Lindblom said. "You have to com
bine the various different spectral
regimes to get an overall picture."
By altering the chemical
makeup of the multilayers,
Lindblom can essentially map the
surface of the sun by combining
the photographs of different spec
tral regimes.
Lindblom and his colleagues
plan to continue their solar re
search with this kind of telescope.
Although a date is not set,
Lindblom said another rocket
launching is being planned for
next year so that he can get more
images of the sun.
According to Lindblom, the tele
scopes might also lend a hand to
non-solar space research.
