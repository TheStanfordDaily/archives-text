# Matters of the heart and soul: mixing medicine and poetry
## Dr. John Stone speaks tonight about the pulses of patients and poems 
### Bruce Robinson 
A Renaissance man of medicine, Dr.
John Stone blends poetry and
medicine with a rare understanding
of the physical and spiritual heart.
Stone, a professor of medicine and
community health at Emory Univer
sity School of Medicine, says "writing
has always been in my blood."
Giving the Stanford community a
glimpse of his dual talents as both
cardiologist and writer, Stone will
speak in Fairchild Auditorium this eve
ning at 7:30 p.m.

With topics ranging from
the anatomy and the
brain to baseball and
sex, Stone's poetry does
in fact give a personal
description of the differ
ent aspects of his life.

With topics ranging from the
anatomy and the brain to baseball and
sex, Stone's poetry does in fact give
a personal description of the different
aspects of his life.
He says he tries to bridge human
physiology and psychology by combin
ing technical expertise with insight
into the personal side of medicine.
For example, Stone explains that his
poem "The Bottle" (reprinted here)

describes how the wojiders of the
human body intrigued him as a teen
ager. He remembers looking at a fetus
in a bottle at his grandfather's medical
office in rural Mississippi.
When he presents this poem on
stage, Stone recounts how this
memory helped him choose medicine
as a career.
Tonight Stone will read selected
poems from his works and use them
to illustrate his medical experience in
very human terms, in a presentation
entitled "The Human Encounter in
Medicine: An Exploration of Medicine
and the Humanities." Stone's presen
tation is sponsored by the Humanities
Group at Stanford Medical School.
Among other accomplishments,
Stone was editor of "Principles and
Practice of Emergency Medicine," the
first textbook written on emergency
medicine.
In addition to his success as a doctor,
Stone has become a distinguished
writer and literary scholar.
He has published three books of
poetry in the last 16 years.
Exploring topics from cardiology to
physician-patient relations, Stone has
written numerous articles, including
several that recently appeared in The
New York Times Magazine.
Additionally, he has taught poetry
as a visiting professor in the English
Department at Emory.
A southerner who grew up in Jack
son, Miss., Stone stayed in his home
town for college, attending Millsaps
College.
He explains that he developed an

interest in poetry because it was "a
way to record my encounters with the
world," a function of writing which he
believes is often overlooked.
Sylvia Bowen, a fifth-year medical
student and teaching fellow in the
Human Biology Department, has
studied both English and medicine
with Stone, and she describes the way
in which he decides on a topic for
some of his poems.
"Stone is a cardiologist who is able
to work calmly and effectively with
his patients."
But according to Bowen, Stone's

Stone says it is 'very nat
ural to read from his own
work; adding that the
meaning of his poetry is
conveyed best when he
reads it aloud.

practices are unique because "he
records the event in some tiny corner
of his brain," and when he has a mo
ment of free time, he pulls out his
doctor's notebook and jots down his
vivid memories which he later uses in
poems.
Stone insists on creating poetry
which is accessible, not allusive. As
Bowen notes, "he writes poetry which
both doctor and patient can relate to."
He often reads from his work, com
plementing the poetry with anecdotes

and descriptions of the origins of the
poem.
Stone says it is "very natural to
read from his own work," adding that
the meaning of his poetry is conveyed
best when he reads it aloud.
He even accompanies a poem about
heart transplant surgery with a slide
display (not gory, he assures) which
illustrates the part of the operation
alluded to in the poem.
Stone believes that it is important
to describe his personal memories in
poetry that anyone can understand.
Quoting his mentor William Carlos
Williams( 1883-1963), ajso a physician
writer, Stone sums up his own goals
for writing'poetry:
Williams explained to his mother,
"I wanted to write a poem that you'd
understand, for what good would it
be if you did not understand it?"
