Reviewed by Mark Weiner
Neil Postman is a trouble
maker. With the publication of
his latest book, "Conscientious
Objections," he proves himself to
be truly dangerous.
A social critic as intensely con
cerned with clear, concise writing
as he is with democracy, Postman
is just the kind of subversive we
need.
Readers may remember
Postman for his recent book
"Amusing Ourselves to Death:
Public Discourse in an Age of
Showbusiness." In this widely
read work of public scholarship,
Postman made a furious critique
of the effect of television on po
litical consciousness.
Because television is a funda
mentally image-centered medium,
noted Postman, it does not have
the capacity to effectively trans
mit meaningful, coherent political
messages. Instead, television's
commercial "aesthetic" (its "over
whelming need to keep people
watching") is bias towards
visually- exciting, fragmented glitz
and not towards the slow, more
interpretive qualities of writing
needed to make sense of world
events.
"What the viewer gets (on the
evening news)," writes Postman,
"is a series of impressions, many
of them purely visual, most of
them unconnected to each other
or to any sense of a history un
folding. Taken together, they sug
gest a world that is fundamentally
ungovernable ..."
"Conscientious Objections" is a

collection of Postman's best and
most recent objections to the
status quo. In the book, Postman
discusses the nature of modern
childhood, the crisis in American
education and, as always, the ef
fect of televison on public political
awareness.
Uniting all of Postman's
analyses is the understanding
that how we can say things will
fundamentally determine what we
say. For Postman, the medium of
communication (be it speech,
writing or American commercial
television) affects the content and
larger structure of the message
and, consequently, society as a
whole.
Postman* s criticisms really are
about political epistemology â€”
about the relation between how
we perceive the world and the
language with which we discuss it.
Indeed, Postmans is at his most
haunting and insightful when he
uses his own understanding of
what language ought to be to
parody the gorry and pernicious
state of our current usage.
In one particularly powerful es
say, for instance, Postman
presents a short paragraph that,
he ironically suggests, might form
a new "rhetoric of reassurance"
so that people will not be afaid
of nuclear war. With it, he shows
the extent to which he believes
that clear writing is a moral and
political responsibility.
Postman writes: "American sci
entists assure us that our capacity
for thermalicide is the greatest in
the world. This fact will, of course,
deter cur enemies from attempting
it on us. But should our enemies
decide to make aerial visitations,
we will persevere.
"If every family has provided
itself with a protective residence,
the extent of filteration will be
sharply minimized. And even if

our enemies should launch a 300-
megaton aerial visitation, proba
bly no more than 50 or 60
anthromegs will have a culminat
ing experience.
"Those who are unculminated
may remain in their protective res
idences until all danger of ther
malicide is past."
In this as in other analyses,
Postman raises the specter that
the domination of the public mind
will occur not in an Orwellian
mode of totalitarianism but rather
in the manner described by
Thomas Huxley in "Brave New
World."
According to Huxley and
Postman, our greatest political
threat lies in the public's being

lulled into, and ultimately enjoy
ing, their own linguistic and
moral debasement.
Although he usually fails to ex
amine the power relations that
underly the stupification he
describes, Postman is neverthe
less one of this country's best and
most useful critics. Professor at
New York University, winner of
the George Orwell Award for
Clarity in Language and a model
scholar. Postman should be read
by anyone willing to be provoked
and educated.
May he corrupt the young.
