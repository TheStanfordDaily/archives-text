# Books Worth Reading
## 
### 
Joseph Campbell (with Bill Moyers), "The Power of Myth"
(Doubleday, $19.95).
Two of the most engaging minds of this decade — one a
journalist, the other a recently deceased professor of Comparative
Mythology — discuss the role of myth in our lives. Companion
to the PBS television interview series between Campbell and
Moyers, this book will shed new light on "Star Wars" and John
Wayne, introduce you to the spiritual relationships between Chief
Seattle, Buddha and Christ and, in Campbell's words, will help
you "follow your bliss." Says Campbell, "Read myths. . . . Myths
put you in touch with the experience of being alive."
Dougal Dixon, "The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution"
(Salem House, $19.95).
Dinosaurs have been riding high in the public imagination
recently. If you've at all been swept up in the current dinosaur
craze, or simply enjoy being entertained by an author's playful
view of the world, read "The New Dinosaurs." This is not a
scientific tract or one of the many new books about dinopalen
tology. Instead, Dixon, author of the popular "After Man: A Zoology
of the Future" imagines what dinosaurs might look like if they
had not dissapeared towards the end of the Cretaceous period.
A palentologist himself, Dixon's drawings and descriptions will
make you laugh, think and speculate.
Michael Harrington, "The Long-Distance Runner: An Auto
biography" (Henry Holt and Company, $19.95).
While you watch one or the other of two mainstream political
machines elect their candidates on slates of photo opportunities,
pick up a copy of Michael Harrington's new book and follow the
life of America's most important voice from the left. Adviser to
presidents, author of the tremendously important examination of
poverty, "The Other America,"and close friend to the brightest
European socialist leaders, Harrington has been a force of social
justice and a mentor to young radicals even before the founding
of SDS in the 19605. Co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of
America, Harrington has stood his moral ground while others
timidly waved in the prevailing political winds. Watch for an up
coming review in The Daily.
