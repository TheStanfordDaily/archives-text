## Women's soccer to host Broncos 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Santa Clara Lady Broncos
make the short trek up to Stan
ford this afternoon for a long
awaited rematch against the Car
dinal women's soccer team. This
previously bland cross-county
rivalry has recently added some
pizzazz, due primarily to a heated
contest at Santa Clara in the last
game of last season. The Cardinal
pulled off a tie in that match
against the highly- favored Santa
Clara squad, and the Broncos
have had plenty of time to reflect
on that result.
The Lady Broncos invade Harry
Maloney Field today with but one
goal in mind: to avenge last
season's disappointment against
Stanford and rid themselves of
the memories that have plagued
them since November. The Car
dinal, on the other hand, will try
to hold off the powerful Broncs
for the second straight year.
Containing the Broncos will by
no means be an easy task. Santa
Clara comes into the match sport
ing a top twenty Division I na
tional ranking (No. 17) that they
"have maintained since the early
stages of the season. Their record
is a somewhat modest 5-4, but,
like Stanford, their losses have
come against strong top-twenty
teams. Their list of adversaries
includes Colorado, California, and
UC-Santa Barbara.
Stanford (5-3-1), in confronting
another national powerhouse,
faces a dilemma that it is becom
ing all too familiar with this
season. Two of the Cardinal's
three losses have come against
UCSB and Connecticut, both
ranked in the top ten nationally
among Division I schools.
Stanford's play against both
teams was impressively solid, but
in both cases solid was not good
enough. The Cardinal came up
short in the overtime periods of

both games.
This time though, things could
turn out differently. The Stanford
women are back at home after
their tough northeastern road
trip, ready to apply the experience
they gained from their matches
in the hostile environs of Connec
ticut and Rhode Island.
An additional consideration: the
Broncos have proven themselves
to be quite beatable this season.
Despite the difficulty of Santa
Clara's schedule, the Broncos'
four losses threaten their status
as a nationally-ranked team. A
loss to Stanford not only would
knock the Broncos out of their
top-twenty national ranking but
also would dislodge them, in all
probability, from their No. 3
ranking in the west.
Who would fill Santa Clara's
shoes in such a scenario? That
remains uncertain, but the Stan
ford team thinks they are deserv
ing. Coach Berhane Andeberhan
believes a No. 3 ranking is a reach
able goal; as a matter of fact, the
Cardinal women's early-season
goal was to achieve that position
in the western poll. If Stanford
is to meet its own early-season
expectations, the Cardinal women
must knock off Santa Clara now,
while they have the Broncos on
their home turf.
The Broncos are led by All-
American forward Jenny Symons.
The Cardinal defense will have
their hands full arresting her
charge, but if the game comes
down to the two goaltenders,
Stanford's Elise Edwards appears
to have the edge on Santa Clara's
Wendy Johnson. Edwards has a
stingy 0.66 goals-against average,
and her six shutouts are slightly
more impressive than Johnson's
four. Stanford's triple threat up
front of Lisa Sime (5 goals), Jen
nifer Rowland, and Carolyn Den
ney (4 goals apiece) will give
Johnson plenty to worry about.
