# Quarterback controversies are getting a little out of hand

### Robert Portnoy Editorial staff 
I'm sick of quarterback contro
versies.
There are so many now I have
trouble keeping track. Let's see,
in just the Bay Area we have two:
Joe Montana vs. Steve Young in
San Francisco, and Brian Johnson
vs. Jason Palumbis here on the
Farm.
It seems like every time a quar
terback has a bad half these days,
his job is in jeopardy. I mean,
we're questioning Joe Montana
for Pete's sake, the sport's No. 1
big-game quarterback. Sure he's
older and doesn't run as much,
but I'd still choose him for the
two-minute drill over anyone else
currently playing. A recent game
winning pass to Jerry Rice against
the New York Giants is sufficient

evidence.
In Minnesota, they've turned
two very capable starting quar
terbacks into nervous jello. Both
Tommy Kramer and Wade Wilson
should be NFL starters. The
Viking management knows it. The
coaching staff knows it. The
players know it. Neither is going
to perform up to his abilities if
he fears biding yanked after a bad
series. And it has definitely
reached that extreme at various
points in the Vikings' two
quarterback scheme.
The idea of a relief pitcher is a
neat idea. But it just doesn't work.
A recent tandem that had some
success was David Woodley and

Don Strock of the Miami Dol
phins. Woodley would hand off
and throw short passes for a half.
If it worked, they'd stick with it.
If not, in came Strock, he of the
never-fully-functional knees. The
definition of a drop-back passer,
Strock would sit in the pocket
forever before releasing the ball.
A crushing delivery sack of Strock
didn't startle me; I'd jump if he
wasn't hit.
This arrangement had a unique
quality. These two quarterbacks
have very different on-field per
sonalities. They complemented
each other and gave the opposing
defense fits. How else could David
Woodley quarterback a team to
the Super Bowl? And in the Dol
phins' arrangement there was
never any question who would
start. It was Woodley first, Strock
second. Period. But even that
pairing fizzled after a couple of
seasons.
In the case of Kramer and Wil
son, they're clones. And it's al
together unclear who's starting
from weak to weak. The Vikings
want to have their cake and eat
it too. No dice.
Yes, Young and Montana have
their subtle differences. Young
can run the QB option a little
better than Montana. He's a little
bigger and a little stronger. So
what. Joe can still scramble as
well as Young. Maybe better. Be
cause Joe won't commit to the
run at the drop of a pin. Young
is going to get himself killed. He's
the NFC West's Jim McMahon.
And Joe is still the most ver
satile QB anywhere. He can throw
