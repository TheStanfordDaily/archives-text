# Quarterback controversies are getting a little out of hand
## 
### Robert Portnoy Editorial staff 
I'm sick of quarterback contro
versies.
There are so many now I have
trouble keeping track. Let's see,
in just the Bay Area we have two:
Joe Montana vs. Steve Young in
San Francisco, and Brian Johnson
vs. Jason Palumbis here on the
Farm.
It seems like every time a quar
terback has a bad half these days,
his job is in jeopardy. I mean,
we're questioning Joe Montana
for Pete's sake, the sport's No. 1
big-game quarterback. Sure he's
older and doesn't run as much,
but I'd still choose him for the
two-minute drill over anyone else
currently playing. A recent game
winning pass to Jerry Rice against
the New York Giants is sufficient

COMMENTARY

evidence.
In Minnesota, they've turned
two very capable starting quar
terbacks into nervous jello. Both
Tommy Kramer and Wade Wilson
should be NFL starters. The
Viking management knows it. The
coaching staff knows it. The
players know it. Neither is going
to perform up to his abilities if
he fears biding yanked after a bad
series. And it has definitely
reached that extreme at various
points in the Vikings' two
quarterback scheme.
The idea of a relief pitcher is a
neat idea. But it just doesn't work.
A recent tandem that had some
success was David Woodley and

Don Strock of the Miami Dol
phins. Woodley would hand off
and throw short passes for a half.
If it worked, they'd stick with it.
If not, in came Strock, he of the
never-fully-functional knees. The
definition of a drop-back passer,
Strock would sit in the pocket
forever before releasing the ball.
A crushing delivery sack of Strock
didn't startle me; I'd jump if he
wasn't hit.
This arrangement had a unique
quality. These two quarterbacks
have very different on-field per
sonalities. They complemented
each other and gave the opposing
defense fits. How else could David
Woodley quarterback a team to
the Super Bowl? And in the Dol
phins' arrangement there was
never any question who would
start. It was Woodley first, Strock
second. Period. But even that
pairing fizzled after a couple of
seasons.
In the case of Kramer and Wil
son, they're clones. And it's al
together unclear who's starting
from weak to weak. The Vikings
want to have their cake and eat
it too. No dice.
Yes, Young and Montana have
their subtle differences. Young
can run the QB option a little
better than Montana. He's a little
bigger and a little stronger. So
what. Joe can still scramble as
well as Young. Maybe better. Be
cause Joe won't commit to the
run at the drop of a pin. Young
is going to get himself killed. He's
the NFC West's Jim McMahon.
And Joe is still the most ver
satile QB anywhere. He can throw

Whether he likes It or not sophomore Jason Palumbis has become the center of a circle of speculation this week. Palumbis, who was impressive
In the second balf of last week's 42-14 loss at Notre Dame, may take over the starting quarterback role from junior Brian Johnson on Saturday
from the pocket. He can roll out
and throw on the run. He can
throw short and deep routes. He's
not the best at throwing the
bomb, but I think he'll get by. A
recent pass to Jerry Rice against
New York — well, you get the
idea.
The Washington Redskins did
a shocking thing. They handled
their quarterback controversy
well. Jay Schroeder was the QB.
He got hurt. Doug Williams
replaced him and played out of
his skull. Williams was in and
Schroeder was traded. A good,
decisive move, but one the 2-3
Redskins may yet regret.
Some other teams wasting their
time with QB questions: Bubby
Brister and Steve Bono of the

Pittsburgh Steelers (off-season ac
quisition Todd Blackledge is a for
gotten man); Babe Laufenberg
and Mark Malone of the San
Diego Chargers; the Seattle
Seahawks have lost confidence in
Dave Krieg and Kelly Stouffer is
now at the helm.
Got your breath? I'll mention a
couple more: the Los Angeles
Raiders have been futzing around
with their problems behind center
forever, it seems; the New Eng
land Patriots have vacillated be
tween the young (maybe not any
more) Tony Eason and Steve
Grogan, and now Doug Flutie is
in the picture; the Green Bay
Packers claim they've solved their
QB problems — sure. I won't bore
you with the rest.
Now let's get to the local color.
Stanford's QB query. It's now
been reopened. Last year it was
Greg Ennis and Scott Stark, and
poor Stark's lone opportunity was

against UCLA. He took his first
collegiate snap from center
against the Bruins. Really bright.
He was devoured. Brian Johnson
entered the arena at the end of
the UCLA debacle.
Johnson played well in leading
the Cardinal to victories against
Washington State, San Diego
State and Oregon, none of which
are UCLA. The job was his. Sort
of.
You see, a redshirt freshman
with a cannon for an arm was
waiting in the wings. Sophomore
Jason Palumbis is now a year bet
ter and wiser. He got the same
chance last week that Johnson got
in last year's UCLA game. He
relieved the starter at the end of
a lopsided loss to Notre Dame.
And after a solid effort, he may
start this weekend against San
Jose State.
If Johnson starts, he will be
under immense pressure. He must

perform or the starting job will
be lost indefinitely. That's more
pressure than even Joe Montana
can handle on game day. Montana
said so.
If Palumbis starts and is suc
cessful, the job is his until he
loses it. And Johnson must sit
and wonder. The seed of contro
versy, dormant when the season
began, is again in bloom. Neither
quarterback can survive a poor
performance without being
replaced. That's not a healthy sit
uation for anyone.
What happened to Stark and
Ennis, you ask? Stark has trans
ferred to oblivion and Ennis is
now relegated to playing upback
on the punting team as a fifth
year senior.
Maybe John Elway and Dan
Marino could use a little contro
versy, too. Marino is as mobile as
a desk, and Elway has no touch
on short passes. Replace 'em.
I'm sick of quarterback contro
versies.

He was devoured. Brian Johnson
entered the arena at the end of
the UCLA debacle.
Johnson played well in leading
the Cardinal to victories against
Washington State, San Diego
State and Oregon, none of which
are UCLA. The job was his. Sort
of.
You see, a redshirt freshman
with a cannon for an arm was
waiting in the wings. Sophomore
Jason Palumbis is now a year bet
ter and wiser. He got the same
chance last week that Johnson got
in last year's UCLA game. He
relieved the starter at the end of
a lopsided loss to Notre Dame.
And after a solid effort, he may
start this weekend against San
Jose State.
If Johnson starts, he will be
under immense pressure. He must

perform or the starting job will
be lost indefinitely. That's more
pressure than even Joe Montana
can handle on game day. Montana
said so.
If Palumbis starts and is suc
cessful, the job is his until he
loses it. And Johnson must sit
and wonder. The seed of contro
versy, dormant when the season
began, is again in bloom. Neither
quarterback can survive a poor
performance without being
replaced. That's not a healthy sit
uation for anyone.
What happened to Stark and
Ennis, you ask? Stark has trans
ferred to oblivion and Ennis is
now relegated to playing upback
on the punting team as a fifth
year senior.
Maybe John Elway and Dan
Marino could use a little contro
versy, too. Marino is as mobile as
a desk, and Elway has no touch
on short passes. Replace 'em.
I'm sick of quarterback contro
versies.
There are so many now I have
trouble keeping track. Let's see,
in just the Bay Area we have two:
Joe Montana vs. Steve Young in
San Francisco, and Brian Johnson
vs. Jason Palumbis here on the
Farm.
It seems like every time a quar
terback has a bad half these days,
his job is in jeopardy. I mean,
we're questioning Joe Montana
for Pete's sake, the sport's No. 1
big-game quarterback. Sure he's
older and doesn't run as much,
but I'd still choose him for the
two-minute drill over anyone else
currently playing. A recent game
winning pass to Jerry Rice against
the New York Giants is sufficient

COMMENTARY

evidence.
In Minnesota, they've turned
two very capable starting quar
terbacks into nervous jello. Both
Tommy Kramer and Wade Wilson
should be NFL starters. The
Viking management knows it. The
coaching staff knows it. The
players know it. Neither is going
to perform up to his abilities if
he fears biding yanked after a bad
series. And it has definitely
reached that extreme at various
points in the Vikings' two
quarterback scheme.
The idea of a relief pitcher is a
neat idea. But it just doesn't work.
A recent tandem that had some
success was David Woodley and

Don Strock of the Miami Dol
phins. Woodley would hand off
and throw short passes for a half.
If it worked, they'd stick with it.
If not, in came Strock, he of the
never-fully-functional knees. The
definition of a drop-back passer,
Strock would sit in the pocket
forever before releasing the ball.
A crushing delivery sack of Strock
didn't startle me; I'd jump if he
wasn't hit.
This arrangement had a unique
quality. These two quarterbacks
have very different on-field per
sonalities. They complemented
each other and gave the opposing
defense fits. How else could David
Woodley quarterback a team to
the Super Bowl? And in the Dol
phins' arrangement there was
never any question who would
start. It was Woodley first, Strock
second. Period. But even that
pairing fizzled after a couple of
seasons.
In the case of Kramer and Wil
son, they're clones. And it's al
together unclear who's starting
from weak to weak. The Vikings
want to have their cake and eat
it too. No dice.
Yes, Young and Montana have
their subtle differences. Young
can run the QB option a little
better than Montana. He's a little
bigger and a little stronger. So
what. Joe can still scramble as
well as Young. Maybe better. Be
cause Joe won't commit to the
run at the drop of a pin. Young
is going to get himself killed. He's
the NFC West's Jim McMahon.
And Joe is still the most ver
satile QB anywhere. He can throw

Whether he likes It or not sophomore Jason Palumbis has become the center of a circle of speculation this week. Palumbis, who was impressive
In the second balf of last week's 42-14 loss at Notre Dame, may take over the starting quarterback role from junior Brian Johnson on Saturday
from the pocket. He can roll out
and throw on the run. He can
throw short and deep routes. He's
not the best at throwing the
bomb, but I think he'll get by. A
recent pass to Jerry Rice against
New York — well, you get the
idea.
The Washington Redskins did
a shocking thing. They handled
their quarterback controversy
well. Jay Schroeder was the QB.
He got hurt. Doug Williams
replaced him and played out of
his skull. Williams was in and
Schroeder was traded. A good,
decisive move, but one the 2-3
Redskins may yet regret.
Some other teams wasting their
time with QB questions: Bubby

Pittsburgh Steelers (off-season ac
quisition Todd Blackledge is a for
gotten man); Babe Laufenberg
and Mark Malone of the San
Diego Chargers; the Seattle
Seahawks have lost confidence in
Dave Krieg and Kelly Stouffer is
now at the helm.
Got your breath? I'll mention a
couple more: the Los Angeles
Raiders have been futzing around
with their problems behind center
forever, it seems; the New Eng
land Patriots have vacillated be
tween the young (maybe not any
more) Tony Eason and Steve
Grogan, and now Doug Flutie is
in the picture; the Green Bay
Packers claim they've solved their
QB problems — sure. I won't bore
you with the rest.
Now let's get to the local color.

been reopened. Last year it was
Greg Ennis and Scott Stark, and
poor Stark's lone opportunity was

against UCLA. He took his first
collegiate snap from center
