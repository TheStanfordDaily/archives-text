# Vandals strike Hillel Sukkah
## 
### Helen Willey 
A vandal or vandals stole part
of a White Plaza structure built
to house celebrations of the 10-
day Jewish holiday "Sukkot,"
which ended yesterday.
The Stanford Hillel built the
religious structure — called a
"Sukkah" — on Oct. 25, the
start of the holiday, as a place
of worship for Stanford students
and community members.
Sometime within the next three
days, during class registration,
one panel of the structure was
stolen.
The panel, an 8-foot-by-8-foot
piece of cream-colored Muslim
fabric, was strung with heavy
white rope that anchored it to

the Sukkah.
Rabbi Ari Cartun, executive
director of Hillel, said he doubts
the theft had anti-Semitic mo
tives. "Whoever took it probably
used it for a dorm decoration."

'Whoever took it
probably used it for
a dorm window.'

Cartun filed a police report
but said the organization would
not prosecute. He and other
members of Hillel are anxious
to have the panel returned.
"Students don't know how im
portant it is to us," said Cartun,

adding that the theft is espe
cially "aggravating" because it
is a religious object that was
stolen.
Hillel representatives have
asked that the panel be returned
anonymously to their center,
which is located below the Old
Union Clubhouse.
During the 10-day holiday,
which commemorates the
Jewish people wandering in the
dessert in an attempt to escape
the wrath of the Egyptian
Pharoh, the Sukkah structure
is used for services, prayers,
eating and studying.
Jewish students replaced the
panel with a white sheet and
used the Sukkah a3 if the theft
hadn't occurred.
