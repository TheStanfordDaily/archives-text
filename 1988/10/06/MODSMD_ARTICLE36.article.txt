## Stanford psychiatrist and father involved in out-of-court agreement 
### Nick Bravin 
In an out-of-court settlement
Tuesday, the Central Intelligence
Agency reportedly paid $750,000
— the largest it has ever awarded
— to the father of a Stanford
psychiatrist and eight others who
said they had been brainwashed
by the agency.
The settlement, which has not
been formally acknowledged by
the CIA, was reportedly reached
only hours before litigation was
set to begin.

Harvey Weinstein, who was set to
appear as an expert and fact wit
ness in the trial, had mixed reac
tions to the settlement. "I am
happy that the CIA realized they
wouldn't win," he said. "But I
wanted to testify to tell what I
have learned."
The nine defendants, all
Canadians, sought $1 million each
in the case. They alleged that in
the 1950s they had been subjected
without their knowledge to CIA

funded behavior modification
treatments. Two alledged that
they had been given doses of LSD.
The experiments were con
ducted by the late Dr. Ewen
Cameron at the Allan Memorial
Institute in Montreal.
The trial, Orlikow vs. the
United States, was to be heard
by the U.S. District Court in
Washington, D.C.

walk down the
street and feel
proud.'

Weinstein and other experts
have been preparing for the trial
for the past eight years. Weinstein
said the CIA has used several
roadblocks in making every effort
to avoid dealing with the case.
CIA officials were unavailable
to comment Tuesday.

In the settlement the CIA made
no admission of guilt, but
Weinstein said it must be taken
as an acknowledgement of fault.
Calling the settlement a
"landmark decision for civil
liberties," Weinstein said, "It
shows that the CIA cannot be ex
cluded from guilt."
Weinstein said his 82-year-old
father, Louis Weinstein, was
relieved not to have to testify. "At
long last he can walk down the
street and feel proud," he said.
Weinstein recently released a
book, "A Father, a Son and the
CIA," claiming the agency vic
timized his father with "a thera
peutic zeal that borders on the
sadistic "
Weinstein speculated that the
out-of-court settlement would
take the case out of the public
eye and leave the CIA untar
nished. He said he hopes the suit
has brought into question the
practices of the agency and will
serve to prevent similar experi
ments in the future.
