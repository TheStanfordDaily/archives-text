# USW marchers disturb Kennedy

### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
Interrupting an outdoor lun
cheon attended by University
President Donald Kennedy, more
than 400 United Stanford
Workers and student supporters
marched all over campus for an
hour yesterday, repeating their
demand for "a just labor con
tract."
Startled by the pitch of the
ralliers' deafening whistle
blowing and chanting, more than
10 people got up and left the
luncheon, held in canopied tents
near the Business School.
The luncheon followed the
dedication ceremony of the Lit
tlefield Management Center
building, a new addition to the
Business School.

Kennedy, together with more
than 50 other University offi
cials, guests and staff, remained
seated.
"We want a just contract and
we want it now!" chanted the
demonstrators, who clapped and
cheered but did not enter nor
physically disrupt the luncheon.
"I don't want to strike, but I
will!" read the buttons worn by
many USW officials.
At about 3:30 p.m., almost two
hours after the ralliers upset
Kennedy's lunch, the president
commented on where he thought
the workers' disputes with the
contract negotiations should be
heard.
