# USW marchers disturb Kennedy

### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
Interrupting an outdoor lun
cheon attended by University
President Donald Kennedy, more
than 400 United Stanford
Workers and student supporters
marched all over campus for an
hour yesterday, repeating their
demand for "a just labor con
tract."
Startled by the pitch of the
ralliers' deafening whistle
blowing and chanting, more than
10 people got up and left the
luncheon, held in canopied tents
near the Business School.
The luncheon followed the
dedication ceremony of the Lit
tlefield Management Center
building, a new addition to the
Business School.

Kennedy, together with more
than 50 other University offi
cials, guests and staff, remained
seated.
"We want a just contract and
we want it now!" chanted the
demonstrators, who clapped and
cheered but did not enter nor
physically disrupt the luncheon.
"I don't want to strike, but I
will!" read the buttons worn by
many USW officials.
At about 3:30 p.m., almost two
hours after the ralliers upset
Kennedy's lunch, the president
commented on where he thought
the workers' disputes with the
contract negotiations should be
heard.

listen to them," Doyle said. "They
won't take students for granted
like they do us."
In addition to students par
ticipating as negotiators on the
USW bargaining team, the Stu
dent Labor Relations Council is
arranging for dorm presentations,
a campus wide forum to be held
in Casa Zapata dining hall next
week and a benefit party for the
USW one week from Friday.
The ralliers marched from

"It is still true, as it always has
been, that these issues are worked
out at only one place — the bar
gaining table. We are continuing
to work hard for progress there,
because we want a fair contract
for Stanford workers," Kennedy
said.
The USW, officially Local 680
of the Service Workers Interna
tional, has been without a labor
contract with the University since
Aug. 31 — when the previous
three-year contract expired.
Twenty negotiation sessions
have been held since the end of
July, but workers at yesterday's
rally expressed disillusion and
concern with the University's con
tract proposals and the slow prog
ress of negotiations.
The rally followed a closed USW
membership meeting attended by
more than 700 union employees
and about a dozen students from
various campus organizations, ac
cording to USW Steward Linda
Crouse.
More than 20 students from
MEChA (a Chicano student
group), the Black Student Union,
the Asian-American Student As
sociation, the Black Law School
Association, the Woman's Center,
the ASSU Council of Presidents
and the ASSU Senate later
marched in support of the
workers.
Describing the student support
as "one of the best things going
for the union," Ella Doyle, a lab
glassware washer, said student
support strengthens the union's
position.
"If they listen to anyone, they'll

Dinkelspiel Auditorium to Ken
nedy's office where USW Vice
President Alan Wagner pounded
on the door and demanded to
speak to Kennedy.
After finding Kennedy absent,
the demonstrators marched im
promtu through campus. They
stopped in front of the Legal Of
fice in Building 170, where the
University's labor negotiator
works. The throngs of workers
walked through the main entrance
of the University to the Oval,
turned toward the Business
School and marched up the stairs
to the luncheon attended by Ken
nedy.
After the march left the Busi
ness School luncheon, it continued
on to the Employee Relations Of
fice behind Old Pavilion, then
marched back through campus to

Dinkelspiel.
Hearing the whistles and chants
of the workers, more than 20 stu
dents filed out of Meyer Library
to watch. Students walking from
classes stopped in their tracks and
stared. A few bewildered students
asked the ralliers what the march
was for as it continued toward
Dinkelspiel.
Earlier, the USW membership
meeting ignited a spirited re
sponse from workers, according

I could probably go to the (member
ship) meeting myself and get a unani
mous vote, depending on how I de
scribed the University's proposals.'

to USW student negotiator Stacey
Ley ton, a member of the COP
who spoke at the meeting.
During the meeting, USW
lawyer Mary Mocine presented
some of the University's contract
proposals to the members. One
union employee then moved to
completely reject the current Uni
versity proposals, Leyton said.
Subsequently, the members,
who filled three-quarters of Dink
elspiel, unanimously voted to "re
ject management proposals." Al
though this has no legal bearing
on the negotiations, Crouse de
scribed this vote as a "warning"
from the workers to University
management that workers are
serious about getting a just con
tract and see the University's cur
rent contract proposals as "unac
ceptable."

After Wagner described the
University's proposals for federal
mediation, he explained to the
workers why the USW was op
posed to mediation, Leyton said.
Then, the union unianimously
approved a motion that the USW
negotiating team be authorized to
call for federal mediation if the
team deems it appropriate.
University lawyer Michael Var
tain said he was "unclear" as to

how many of the 1,300 employees
represented in the union contract
actually participated in the meet
ing yesterday.
"1 hope the negotiating team
will not delay further," Vartain
continued. Stanford proposed on
Sept. 18 that a federal mediator
be brought in to facilitate nego
tiations, but Mocine opposed the
idea at the time because the two
sides had not reached an impasse.

Doubting the union's credibility
and the workers' "unanimous"
support, Vartain questioned how
the union has portrayed the Uni
versity's proposals to its mem
bers.
"I could probably go to the
(membership) meeting myself and
get a unanimous vote, depending
on how I described the Universi
ty's proposals," Vartain said.
