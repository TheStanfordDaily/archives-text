# Faculty underplay close VP debate

"It was a great non-event," said Po
litical Science Prof. John Manley of last
night's vice presidential debate.
While most Stanford faculty members
did not find the debate especially excit
ing, many did say it came alive when
Republican candidate Dan Quayle com
pared himself to former U.S. President
John F. Kennedy.
Television commentators and persons
attending the debate in Omaha, Neb.,
seemed to agree that the most contro
versial part of the debate occurred when
Quayle equated his amount of experi
ence in government to other vice pres
idential candidates. Audience reaction
was also strong when Quayle compared

himself to Kennedy.
Democratic candidate Lloyd Bentsen
responded forcefully by saying, "You're
no Jack Kennedy."
Communication Prof. James Risser
said Bentsen's sharp response "un
glued" Quayle.
"Up to the question about Kennedy,
Quayle was holding his own," said Ris
ser, the director of the Knight Fellow
ship Program and currently a visiting
professor at Stanford-in-Washington.
"Bentsen's comment really rattled

him. He came unglued, and from that
point on, he kept repeating himself,"
Risser said.
Other faculty members agreed that
Quayle's use of the comparison hurt
him.
"Quayle is not John Kennedy," said
English and Feminist Studies Prof Bar
bara Gelpi. "He did bring up the com
parison, and it is a minimal one."
Calling the Kennedy comparison a
"preposterous" one, Manley said "the
ad hominem attack about JFK is a dan
gerous issue."
Economics Prof John Taylor de
fended how Quayle compared himself
to Kennedy. "It was just a way for
Quayle to say that others who
have been elected have had similar
experience time-wise in
Congress," he said. "Bentsen was
a little too nasty on that one."
But Political Science Prof.
Philippe Schmitter said Bentsen's
response was "his most effective
moment" in the debate.
"When Quayle equated himself
with John Kennedy, he brought
out outrage. It made Bentsen
seem less mechanical and more
human without blowing his cool,"
Schmitter said.
Manley agreed with Schmiter's
description of the candidates, say
ing they were "humanoids."
Evaluating their composure on
stage, Psychology Prof. Herbert
Clark said Bentsen looked much

more relaxed than Quayle.
"Quayle did not make eye con
tact. ... He beared away from
Bentsen and had no facial expres
sions," Clark said.
While evaluations of the debate
were varied, most Stanford fac
ulty members interviewed agreed
it was a draw.
According to Schmitter, "the
issue was not who won, but who
didn't lose." Manley agreed that
the debate did not put one can
didate on top.
Quayle's performance at the
debate was not good enough to
"dispell doubts" about his ability
as a vice president, Manley said.
But he adding that he does not
think that Quayle will be "a dis
aster" on the Republican ticket.
"Expectations were so low for
Quayle â€” people didn't think he
could tie his shoelaces," Manley
noted.

"On the other hand, Bentsen
didn't do much better," Manley
said.
Evaluating the candidates per
formance in general, Manley said
"the whole manner of the debate
was too programmed."
Some faculty members ques
tioned the format of the debate,
saying improvements could be
made.
"The format was pathetic,"
Schmitter said, noting that the
journalists conducting the debate
asked Quayle more challenging
questions.
The format constrained
Bentsen, forcing him to respond
to questions aimed directly at
Quayle. For instance, when ques
tions regarding Quayle's academic
performance were asked Bentsen
had no response.
