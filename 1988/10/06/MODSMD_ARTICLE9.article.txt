# Open trailer spaces alter room situation

After requiring undergaduates
to live in four-person trailers to
make sure there would be enough
housing, this week University of
ficials announced that about 45
extra spaces in the Manzanita
Trailer Park will be open to cur
rent residents.
Students living in Manzanita
trailers, which were designed for
three students, received letters
Monday from the Housing Center
giving them the option of staying
in their four-person trailers or
moving into three-person trailers
with graduate students.
Fearing an undergraduate
housing crunch due to the closing
of Roble Hall last year, University
officials required undergraduate
residents to live in groups of four
in trailers designed for three res
idents.
Christine Griffith, assistant di
rector of graduate residences, es
timated yesterday that the 45
spaces are available in Manzanita,
primarily because so many grad
uate students have been housed
in Rains, a graduate housing com-

plex that opened in September.
Griffith said the University ex
pected Manzanita to have extra
spaces once Rains was opened, but
officials cautiously placed under
graduates into quads to make sure
that there would be enough
housing.
Sophomore Erin Clune, a resi
dent of a Manzanita quad, said
that although she would have
preferred living in a triple, the
option came too late.
"People are already moved in
and it would be a drag to move
again," Clune said.
But University officials said
they could not have allowed the
option earlier because they were
unable to determine the exact
number of vacancies until school
had begun. "Some people stop out
or change their mind at the last
minute," said Rodger Whitney, di
rector of housing.
Griffith said that the Housing
Center followed "standard proce
dure" in dealing with the Man
zanita vacancies. She explained

that students were assigned to the
trailer park and then walk-ons
were offered the vacancies.
Walk-ons didn't fill the
vacancies by the Friday deadline,
so the Housing Center decided to
allow undergraduates to move to
partially filled graduate trailers.
Those undergraduates who live
in trailers with only three resi
dents may "lock out" their trailer
from a fourth resident for the rest
of the year, Whitney said.

According to Whitney, moving
from a quad into a triple would
boost rents slightly. Current quar
terly fees are $833 per person for
a four-person residence and $940
per person for a three-person res
idence, an 11 percent increase.
As of Tuesday, Whitney had re
ceived only one letter from an
undergraduate wishing to move
into a three-person trailer. He ex
pects that the locking out policy
will be more more popular.
