## Pinochet clings to power Vows to continue term despite strong opposition 
### 
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) - A
stern Gen. Augusto Pinochet told
the nation yesterday he will
remain as president until his term
runs out in 1990, as police fired
water cannons and tear gas into
crowds celebrating his defeat in
a referendum on extending his
rule to 1997.
"Every man and woman of this
country can be absolutely sure we
will carry out completely the
itinerary foreseen in the consti
tution," Pinochet said in a speech
broadcast nationwide on radio and
television.
It was his first public declara
tion since a resounding loss in
Wednesday's referendum. "I rec
ognize and accept the majority
verdict expressed yesterday by the
citizenry," he declared.
The authoritarian leader ap
peared in a white military dress
uniform. Unsmiling and head
slightly bowed toward a set of
microphones, he spoke in a strong,
steady voice.

Pinochet also warned opposi
tion leaders not to misinterpret
the vote as a mandate for them,
or a rejection of an 8-year-old con
stitution that called for the ref
erendum. The referendum also
provides for Pinochet if defeated
— as he was — to remain in office
until March 1990, when the win
ner of an open election planned
for late 1989 will assume power.
"No one can feel they have the
mandate of the people to twist
what the people decided," he said.
The constitution, crafted by his
administration, was passed in a
loosely organized 1980 referen
dum that opposition leaders said
was rife with vote fraud.
Thousands of jubilant foes of
Pinochet chanted "He has fallen!"
and marched in confetti-strewn
streets to celebrate their ballot
box victory over the military
ruler.
"An authoritarian system has
been overthrown," said Ricardo
Lagos, a leader of a 16-party co

alition that campaigned for Pinoc
het's defeat in a yes-or-no plebis
cite.
Some marches turned violent.
While tens of thousands of
Chileans demonstrated peacefully
at a nearby park and plaza, hun
dreds of youths near the govern
ment palace hurled bottles and
sticks at police, and dragged wood
planks and other debris onto
downtown streets.
Riot police used water cannons,
setting off mad scrambles engulf
ing passersby walking along
nearby streets. Tear gas fumes
made many people cover their
faces with handkerchiefs and of
fice workers closed windows 10
stories above ground.
More than 20 people were ar
rested and two policemen were
injured, authorities said.
A crowd of many thousands,
mostly young men, packed all
eight lanes of Santiago's main
boulevard for blocks in a standoff
with riot police.
