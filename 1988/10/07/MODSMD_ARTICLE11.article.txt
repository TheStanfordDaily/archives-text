# Quayle still not convincing
## CBS poll says half of voters doubt his qualifications 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - Half the
voters who watched the vice
presidential debate came away
still doubting Republican Sen.
Dan Quayle's qualifications to
serve as president, if that be
came necessary, a national poll
found yesterday.
The CBS News poll of 412
debate watchers also found they
overwhelmingly believed the
Democratic nominee, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, won the debate. An

ABC News poll released after
the debate Wednesday reached
the same finding.
Quayle was rated as qualified
to be president by 47 percent in
the CBS post-debate poll, up
from 37 percent who rated him
qualified before the debate. But
Bentsen did better, rated as
qualified by 78 percent, up from
64 percent.
Though Quayle's rating im
proved, "I'd be worried if I was

Dan Quayle, because he still
hasn't broken the 50 percent
mark and this was probably his
only chance to do so," said
Keating Holland, a CBS poll
analyst.
Asked who won the debate,
50 percent in the survey chose
Bentsen and 27 percent said
Quayle. The result was almost
precisely the same as the 51-27
percent split in the ABC poll.
