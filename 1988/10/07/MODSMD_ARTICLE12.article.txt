# No evidence found in Brawley case
## New York attorney general calls Brawley tale of rape a lie 
### 
POUGHKEEPSIE, NY. (AP)
— Tawana Brawley's tale of rape
V)y a gang of whites a lid
fanned into a source of facial ten*
Bion through the "hucksterism
and opportunism" of her advisers,
New York's attorney general said
yesteraday.
"We have the facts. We have
solved the case. The allegations
she had made are false," Robert
Abrams said as he released copies
of an exhaustive, 170-page grand
jury investigation of the black
teen-ager's story.
The grand jury said it found
no evidence of sexual assault and
said Miss Brawley herself was re
sponsible for the degraded condi
tion in which she was found after
a four-day disappearance last No
vember.
The investigation received no
cooperation from Miss Brawley or
her family, who with their ad
visers — the Rev. A 1 Sharpton
and attorneys C. Vernon Mason
and Alton Maddox — had accused
authorities of a racially motivated
cover-up.
"They have charged the atmos
phere with incredible, incendiary
remarks and with extraordinary
tension," Abrams said during a
news conference. He asked the
state judicial discipline committee
to punish the lawyers.
Miss Brawley was found Nov.
28, seemingly dazed, outside an
apartment that had recently been
vacated by her family in Wap
pingers Falls, 75 miles north of
New York City. Her body was
smeared with feces and scrawled
with racial slurs.
She claimed she had been held
captive for four days and raped
by several white men, and she
implicated law enforcement offi
cials in the attack.

The grand jury provided no rea
son for Miss Brawley to lie but
noted that she had been punished
and beaten on previous occasions
by her mother and her mother's
boyfriend, Ralph King, for leaving
home and staying out late.
The report cleared Assistant
District Attorney Stephen

Pagones and Harry Crist Jr., a
policeman who committed suicide
shortly after Miss Brawley was
found. Both were accused by her
advisers of taking part in the al
leged attack.
Abrams charged the Brawley
lawyers lied repeatedly about the
case.
