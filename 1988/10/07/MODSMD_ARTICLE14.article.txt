ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) - Al
geria proclaimed a state of emer
gency and imposed a curfew
Thursday to quell rioters devas
tating the capital for a third
straight day in a revolt against
high prices and unemployment.
The military command, in a
late-night statement, said rioters
damaging public property would
be fired on.
President Chadli Bendjedid, in
the first serious crisis of his 10-
year rule, put all administrative
and security authorities under
military command yesterday
morning. It was the first time
soldiers were in charge of public
order since French rule ended 26
years ago.
Submachine gun fire could be
heard repeatedly in the center of
Algiers Thursday.

The French news agency,
Agence France-Presse, reported at
least two people dead.
The military command issued
a midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew last
night for Algiers and its suburbs
as sporadic demonstrations and
street fires continued. The com
mand said those ignoring the cur
few risked arrest.
The command said public prop
erty would be protected "by force,
including the use of arms, after
warning shots."
Unconfirmed reports said in
jured people were hospitalized but
hospital personnel would not an
swer questions. Many arrests
were reported but authorities gave
no figures. Damage has been es
timated informally at several hun
dred million dollars but no official
figures are available.

Large sections of Algiers were
scenes of devastation with govern
ment buildings burned, cars and
buses overturned and windows
broken. Smoke from tear gas hung
in the air.
Inflation has totaled more than
20 percent a year on some items,
particularly food other than
bread, which is subsidized. Unof
ficial estimates put unemploy
ment in the cities above 40 percent
and there is no unemployment
compensation.
A government economic reform
program has caused dramatic in
creases in the prices of some
staples. A pound of beef sells for
about $11.40 or more, and in
some places drinking water is sold
for about $4 a gallon.
Other parts of the country ap
peared calm yesterday.
