U.S. hostages' safety threatened
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) — Kidnappers holding
two Americans threatened the hostages' safety
yesterday in venting their anger over proposals
to send U.N. troops to police Lebanon's stalled
presidential elections.
The warning came in a typewritten statement
in Arabic from the Revolutionary Justice Organ
ization. The statement was delivered to the Beirut
independent newspaper An-Nahar along with a
Polaroid picture of U.S. hostage Joseph James
Cicippio.
"We shall use all the cards to thwart these
conspiracies, including the card of the safety of
the hostages, which we shall make the backbone
of our confrontation," the statement said.
The photograph showed Cicippio, 58, of Valley
Forge, Pa., in a navy blue track suit with red
stripes sitting on a blanket-covered bed. His
hands were clasped in his lap and he was smiling
as he faced the camera, but he looked considerably
thinner than in previous pictures released by his
captors.
$400 M postal contract was rigged
WASHINGTON (AP) — A Texas company and
two of its executives were accused Thursday of
conspiring with a former Postal Service governor
to rig the award of $400 million in contracts for
automated mail-sorting equipment.
The indictment charged Recognition Equipment
Inc. of Irving, Texas; REl's chairman, William
Moore Jr.; and Robert Reedy, a vice president,
with participating in an elaborate scheme that
included the replacement of Paul Carlin as
postmaster general with Albert Casey in 1986.
The indictment said the two executives con
spired with Peter Voss, then vice chairman of
the Postal Service board of governors, and others
to manipulate hid procedures, obtain confidential
information about competitors and replace Car

lin, considered an obstacle to REI winning con
tracts.
Voss received $19,000 in kickbacks from a
Detroit-area public relations firm headed by John
Gnau Jr. that REI hired on his recommendation,
the government said. Voss also was promised
one-quarter of one percent of any revenues REI
earned from Postal Service contracts, it said.
The contract was never awarded but it would
have been worth $8 billion over 10 years, accord
ing to court papers filed earlier in the investi
gation.
Peres jostled while campaigning
RAMLE, Israel (AP) — Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres was jostled, booed and called a
traitor yesterday as he campaigned for undecided
voters in this traditional stronghold of the con
servative Likud Bloc.
"Peres go home!" chanted scores of Likud sup
porters dressed in blue-and-white party hats and
waving Likud banners at the 65-year-old Peres
as he entered an open-air vegetable market.
They taunted Peres for conciliatory policies
toward the Arabs, especially his proposal to trade
parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
for peace.
The crowd of about 400 surged toward Peres,
who was knocked off balance several times but
unharmed. Police linked arms to protect Peres,
and security guards grabbed a man who tried to
hurl a tomato.
The Labor leader told The Associated Press:
"It demonstrates a certain style that a better
part of the Israeli people do not like to see."
The crowd was made up mostly of young Sep
hardim, or Jews whose familes immigrated from
Middle East countries and who now account for
a slight majority of Israel's 3.4 million Jews.
They voted heavily for Likud in the 1977 elections
and ended 29 years of rule by the Labor Party,
which was dominated by Askenazi Jews originat
ing from Europe.
