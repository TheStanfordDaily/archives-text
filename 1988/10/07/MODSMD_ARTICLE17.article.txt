Important issues on the
November ballot make
your vote very weighty

WHY BOTHER TO VOTE?
Given the choice of can
didates and the lack of dis
cussion of substantive issues, it is
easy to feel like this election is not
worth participating in. The flag
waving Vice President and the
tank-driving Governor have not ex
actly stirred deep passions among
the electorate.
Despite the relatively dull per
sonalities of the candidates, the
stakes are so high in the November
elections that there is no excuse
for every student not registering
and voting. The deadline is Tues
day, October 11.
Many people do not realize that
you have to re-register every time
you move. If you are living in a
different room than you were last
year — even if you have the same
P.O. Box — you need to re-register.
Registration forms are available
from your resident assistant, at the
tables in White Plaza (you don't
have to be Democrat to register at
the Dukakis table), and from the
Council of Presidents.
The national polls show that this
election is going to be razor close.
The latest CBS-New York Times
poll shows a statistical dead heat
with the Bush-Quayle ticket
leading Dukakis and Bentsen 48
percent to 46 percent with a 3 per
cent margin of error. This situation
is reminiscent of the 1960 election

when John F. Kennedy defeated
Richard Nixon by about one vote
precinct. In an election that close,
every vote really does count.
Another motivation to register
is that California — with the most
number of electoral votes (47) —
is the key swing state. No Repub
lican has lost California since 1964
and it is generally conceded that
Dukakis cannot win the election
without carrying California. Con
sequently, both candidates are
placing top priority on our state.
A vote here for either candidate
has greater strategic value than a
vote in another state.
While the race for president has
the greatest implications for the
country and the world, there are
a host of important races and is
sues to be decided on the state and
local levels. A wide range of ballot
propositions will affect state policy
on everything from auto insurance
rates to AIDS testing to state fund
ing for education. The contest be
tween Leo McCarthy and Pete Wil
son for U.S. Senate will help de
termine which party controls the
Senate, and the local congressional
race between Anna Eshoo and Tom
Campbell presents a choice between
opposing philosophies and world
views.
We question the necessity for a
30-day cut-off for registering and
think that Congress should give
serious consideration to Sen. Alan
Cranston's bill that would man
date universal, on-site, same-day
registration.
But for now, there are only a few
days left, so don't forget to register.
Once again, for the 1988 election,
the deadline is Tuesday, October
11. Don't miss it.
