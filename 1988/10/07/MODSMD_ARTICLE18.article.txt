## Choosing to have kids means making concessions 
### 
Ashley ryan poses the right
question in her column "Choos
ing to be a parent." She asks:"ls
it possible to be a parent deeply in
volved in your children's maturation
and upbringing, while still achieving
your own most ambitious professional
dreams?"
I've been thinking about Ashley's
question for a long time. My genera
tion was one that came of age during
the women's movement. We learned
only in our early twenties that women
could — indeed should — enjoy profes
sional careers as satisfying, interesting
and rewarding as those of our male
peers. But what the women's move
ment did not teach us, because it

'You surely will be able to
have both children and
career if you are prepared
to achieve a little less in
each domain than your
dreams have sketched out
for you.'

didn't know any better in the late
sixties, was that, to "have it all," we
would have to pay a price.
No, it is not possible to be as deeply

involved a parent as you will want to
be if you are pursuing your profes
sional ambitions. And no, you will not
be able to achieve your most "ambi
tious professional dreams" if you have
children whose emotional welfare,
health and education really matter to
you.
But you surely will be able to have
both children and career if you are
prepared to achieve a little less in each
domain than your dreams have
sketched out for you. You won't eryoy
quite the degree of professional
recognition your abilities actually
warrant, or that you would have re
ceived had you remained childless. And
you won't see every soccer game, cello

recital, attend every parent-teacher
conference or ever get to be room
mother — though it would have been
easy if you hadn't taken a job.
However, when you look back after
ten or twenty years of having done
both, you will feel a sense of wonder
at what you've been able to do. After a
while, it won't matter that you haven't
reached the pinnacle of success, how
ever we measure that, in either arena.
What will matter is that your kids,
having watched you make some tough
choices, will emerge with a realistic
respect for the difficulty of the prob
lem — and for you.
