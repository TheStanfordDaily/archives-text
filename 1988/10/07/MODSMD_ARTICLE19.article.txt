# Students feel that class closing is an inexcusable slight
## 
### 
On Monday, Oct. 3, the only second
year, third quarter Spanish class was
canceled due to insufficient enrollment.
There were nine students rather than
the desired twelve.
We, as students of this class, cannot
help but feel slighted by the Universi
ty. Classes like Spanish 13 are essential
to our education, and should be made
available to us for the amount of tui
tion that we pay. At $12,564 a year,
Stanford is an expensive investment,
and this Spanish class was a carefully
chosen part of that investment. We, as
well as other students in the class,
must complete the class in order to
graduate in our mtyors. We were given
no advance warning of cancellation due
to lack of enrollment. We have planned
this quarter and this academic year

around taking Spanish 13 at 9 a.m.,
autumn quarter.
The class was in the preliminary
time schedule published last spring, as
well as in the autumn time schedule.
Both of us have delayed taking the
class in the past due to scheduling
problems. We have both sacrificed
other classes this quarter in order to
take the class, and it will undoubtedly
raise further scheduling conflicts if we
are forced to take it at some later
date.
We have no other option in the
Spanish department that will not pose
conflicts with our already determined
schedules. We will probably be able to
scrounge up some units that may fit
in with our previously scheduled
classes, work, and extra-curricular ac
tivities.
This incident may seem insignificant,
as we are only nine students at a uni
versity of thousands, but it raises ques
tions that are important on a larger
scale. Are not nine students as worthy
of this class as twelve? Is the Univer
sity not concerned with the quality of
classes, but only with the sheer num-

ber of tuition payers involved? Are
language departments poorly funded
because they do not yield prestige and
large research grants? Where are our
tuition dollars going, if not to this
class which is so intrinsic to our edu
cation? If anything, we ask that the
University examine this incident, exam
ine its priorities, and examine its con
science.
