# Senate delays new chair's election

### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
Overriding former ASSU Sen
ate Chair Richard Vaughan's in
terpretation of his resignation,
the ASSU Senate last night voted
to postpone election of a new sen
ate chair until the Oct. 20 senate
meeting.
The senate started off the first
meeting of the quarter on an un
usual note — faced with electing
a new chair rather than commenc
ing immediately with standard
business.
Vaughan, who sent a letter of
resignation to senators on Friday,
had planned to preside over the
election of a new chair last night.
According to Vaughan's inter
pretation of the ASSU Bylaws,
his resignation would not be ef
fective until a new senate chair
was elected.
Although the bylaws do not
have a set procedure for when a
chair resigns, there is a section
that deals with the removal of the
chair. In that case, the bylaws
state that the deputy chair takes
over as chair, and the election of
a new chair takes piace at the
next meeting of the senate.
Designating Vaughan's resigna
tion as "self-removal," Senator
Brian Fagel proposed a motion to
"overturn the senate chair's in
terpretation of his vacancy."
Fagel, a sophomore, moved for the
chair's resignation to become ef
fective immediately.
After some confusion, the sen
ate voted 14 to six to pass Fagel's
motion. According to the bylaws,

the election of a new chair will
be postponed until the next meet
ing, on Oct. 20.
"Basically it was a reinterpreta
tion of my interpretation,"
Vaughan said after the meeting.
A graduate student in computer
science, Vaughan has said he
plans to leave Stanford in January
to spend some time away from
his studies.

'In terms of equity, we owe it to the
students we represent' to give everyone
ample time to apply.
— Senator Joseph Cha

During the meeting, Vaughan
read aloud the section of the
bylaws that pertain to the removal
of the chair, asking senators for
their interpretations.
Several senators said they felt
that the election should be
postponed in the interest of fair
ness to all students who might be
interested in running for senate
chair. Senate chair is a position
open to any registered Stanford
student.
Only two students, Senators
Dana Klapper and David Porter,
submitted their candidacies to
Vaughan within the five days
prior to the planned election spe
cified in the bylaws. Students had
very little time to decide to run
for senate chair, noted several
senators, because Vaughan's de
cision to resign was first an

nounced publicly in Tuesday's
Daily, only two days before the
meeting. Vaughan announced his
resignation privately to the senate
in his letter last Friday.
"In terms of equity, we owe it
to the students we represent" to
give everyone ample time to apply,
Senator Joseph Cha said during
the meeting.
"Even if there's just one other

person out there who wants to
run" they should have the oppor
tunity, Fagel said.
After the initial vote, the senate
was only one vote short of the
necessary two-thirds needed to
pass Fagel's motion. However,
confusion arose as to whether
senators who wished to abstain
from voting should be counted as
part of the total vote.
To avoid that confusion, Klap
per and Porter, who had originally
abstained to avoid a conflict of
interest, got up and left the room.
In the absence of a senator, the
next non-voting senator is allowed
a vote.
With those two new voices, the
motion passed.
"When you need a two-thirds
vote, abstentions effectively count
as no votes," Senator David Fallek

said, explaining that Porter and
Klapper were too personally in
volved to vote.
According to Senator Pearl
Chen, a substantia] amount of the
evening's confusion arose because
senators do not have their own
copies of the ASSU Constitution
and Bylaws. During the meeting,
senators discussed updating and
photocopying more copies of the
bylaws.
With his resignation voted on
as effective immediately, Vaughan
stepped down in the middle of the
meeting and handed over control
to deputy chair Aimee Allison. Al
lison will preside over the election
at the next meeting.
The deadline for submitting a
written declaration of candidacy
to the ASSU will be five days
before the next meeting, on Oct.
15.
Besides Vaughan's resignation,
the senate was faced with having
to replace a second officer after
Chair of the Appropriations Com
mittee Chele Chiavacci made
public her intention to step down
on Wednesday.
The appropriations committee
met this afternoon with the in
tention of selecting a new chair,
but also decided to postpone that
decision until after the election of
a new senate chair.
According to Chiavacci, the
committee chose two co-interim
chairs, Senators Amol Doshi and
David Porter, to preside over the
committee until the new senate
chair appoints at least one more
