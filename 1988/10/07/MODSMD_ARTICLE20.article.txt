# Better treatment of workers would demonstrate values
## 
### 
Socrates is alleged to have stated in
principle that "If a man knew what
was right, he would do it." With this
in mind a person could try to under
stand the purpose behind Stanford's
policy toward workers.

What good could come from their
oppressive actions? Personal develop
ment of the individual workers through
the medium of stress?
There are better ways.
If this educational institution re
quires an education in respect to dig
nity for each and every member of
mankind, then an education it MUST
receive.
Stanford is in a position to set a
marvelous example for the world while
proving to itself the value, both in
monetary and aesthetic terms, of treat
ing all people honorably. The Univer
sity can demonstrate its values at this
point in time through its negotiations
with the United Stanford Workers.
As a feedback mechanism for man
agement, we welcome the opportunity
to place Stanford University in the No.
1 position again, even in the "unscien
tific" surveys. Stanford can and will be
the leader in this world in all that is
good for life.
Cooperation and dignity are what we
ask.
