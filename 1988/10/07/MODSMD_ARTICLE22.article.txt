## It's the Georgie Twins

HAVE YOU MET the Georgie
Twins?
Twenty years ago, editorial car
toonist Jules Feiffer surprised and an
gered Democrats by lampooning popular
Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy
as a political schizophrenic.
"These are the Bobby Twins," read
Feiffer's caption. "One is a good Bobby.
One is a bad Bobby.
"The good Bobby is a courageous
reformer. The bad Bobby makes deals.
"The good Bobby sent federal troops
down south to enforce civil rights. The
bad Bobby appointed racist judges down
south to enforce civil rights.
"The good Bobby is a fervent civil lib
ertarian. The bad Bobby is a fervent
wiretapper.
"The good Bobby is ill at ease with
liberals. The bad Bobby is ill at ease with
grownups.
"If you want one Bobby to be your
President, you will have to take both —
for Bobbies are widely known for their
family unity."
The Twin Syndrome has spread. Some
one simply must have cloned poor
Georgie on Inauguration Day, 1981, and
substituted The Man Who Would Pick
Quayle. Nobody's seen much of the good
Georgie since.
The good Georgie supported the Equal
Rights Amendment. The bad Georgie
helped lead the fight against it .
The good Georgie excoriated Ronald
Reagan's political agenda during the 1980
Republican primaries. He believed
Reagan was too extreme, too out of touch
with middle America and with reality.

He correctly predicted enormous budget
deficits under a Reagan policy of in
creased defense spending combined with
reduced taxation. He gave us the term
"voodoo economics."
The bad Georgie thinks the very same
voodoo economics are just neat.
The good Georgie never attended a
school wherein students recited the
Pledge of Allegiance. But he was a true
patriot nonetheless, and served in WWII
as the the nation's youngest combat pilot.
He faced death for what he believed in.
Whatever he personally thought of the
Pledge, the good Georgie knew that re
quiring students to recite it was almost
certainly unconstitutional. And above all,
he remembered, from James Boswell's
Life of Johnson, that Patriotism is the
last refuge of a scoundrel.
The bad Georgie wants elementary
school teachers to be required to lead
students in the Pledge. Damn the Con
stitution, full speed ahead.
The good Georgie didn't like abortion,
especially not as birth control. But he
recognized that a woman who wanted
one would get one — legally or illegally,
cheaply or dearly, safely or coat-hanger
dangerously, locally or far away — and
that safe and legal abortions were a nec
essary evil. And while he disliked the
reasoning behind Roe v. Wade, he af
firmed the public policy it laid down.
The bad Georgie wants to reverse Roe.
In the September 25 debate, he said abor
tion should be illegal and should carry
criminal penalties for the mother (though
he hadn't quite sorted the penalties out
just yet).

The good Georgie, while never a mem
ber of the American Civil Liberties Un
ion, held a neutral opinion of the
organization. Sure, they often went too
far; but just as often, they alone helped
defend a vital clause in the Bill of Rights.
And he knew, too, that many prominent
Americans — including Dwight Eisen
hower — were card-carrying ACLU mem
bers.
The bad Georgie prefers the view of
his new chum, Edwin Meese III: the
ACLU is "a criminals' lobby." (Does this
explain why they're defending Oliver
North?)
The good Georgie, in a rare public reap
pearance at the recent Republican con
vention, declared that he wanted "a
kinder, gentler nation." And the bad
Georgie?
He voted for nerve gas production.
Many voters would love to turn out
for good old Georgie on Election Day. It's
a damn shame he isn't on the ballot.
