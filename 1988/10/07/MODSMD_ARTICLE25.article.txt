## Reach out and find a phone 
### 
I feel compelled to comment
on a subject that is of the most
vital importance to our national
security. By this I mean, of
course, purchasing a phone sys
tem.
The way I discovered how vi
tal purchasing a phone system
is to our national security was
by counting the number of com
mercials for phone systems dur
ing male-oriented TV programs
such as baseball and old reruns
of Charlie's Angels.
In fact, if you watch enough
of these shows you'd think from
the commercials that all men
ever do all day is lie around
drinking beer, shaving and
buying expensive toys. This is,
of course, a grossly unfair
characterization of men, and I
think it is my duty to set the
record straight by pointing out
that some of us men DON'T
shave.
But in terms of purchasing a
phone system, you can get a
pretty realistic picture of how
such a purchase would occur in
the business world by watching
those commercials on television:
SCENE: A BUSY OFFICE.
Boss: Did you purchase the
new phone system?
Employee: Yes, sir! I pur
chased the new Statictone 3,000
which has such features as
mute, on-hook dialing, auto
dilithium crystal generating and
semi-incandescent frolicking.
Boss: Can it receive calls?
Employee: Well, uh. . . .
Boss: You're fired. . . .
Employee: I should have
called AT&T.
Boss: .... and your kids are
toast.
FADE TO BLACK.
VOICEOVER: You can't af
ford not to choose AT&T (sound
of employee's children being tor
tured in background.)
Luckily, most of us don't have
to worry about purchasing a
business phone system because

we're still students. Yet there is
that all-important decision of
which long-distance carrier to
choose.
The two main long-distance
companies are U.S. Sprint,
which is owned by people dedi
cated to providing quality tele
phone service at the lowest
possible price, and AT&T, which
is owned by Cliff Robertson.
Even though he does all those
commercials for AT&T, I hap
pen to know from personal ex
perience that Cliff Robertson
doesn't know squat about telep
hones. I say this because — and
this is a true story — I was
working the telephone
switchboard at a hotel this sum
mer where Cliff Robertson was
staying, and HE HAD TO CALL
ME to figure out how to get an
outside line. Some expert.
Not that U.S. Sprint is any
bargain either. Their commer
cials show a rigid scientific test
which consists of dropping a pin
in front of a telephone receiver
in Los Angeles and seeing
whether a bunch of scientists in
New York can hear it drop.
This may work in the com
mercial, but I can speak from
experience when I say that my
girlfriend lived in New Mexico
this summer and I lived in
Alaska, and when I was talking
to her on the phone via U.S.
Sprint you could have sacrificed
a goat near her telephone and
I wouldn't have been able to
hear it.
But without question, the
single most important consider
ation when choosing a long
distance carrier is whether it
has the new "fiber-optic tech
nology."
If you recall from elementary
school, old phones worked on the
principle that when you said
something such as "Laurie likes
you and she's got cooties," into
one end, your voice would be
transmitted by a series of waves
until they got to the other

phone, at which point they
would be reassembled into
sounds and would come out as
"Watson, come here quickly, I
need you."
The new phone lines work on
the principle of fiber-optics, in
which your voice is broken down
into little pulses of light which
race through the phone lines
and eventually come out the
other end in the form of little
pulses of light. You must be very
careful when using fiber-optic
telephone lines because if you
yell too loudly it's possible to
blind the listener on the other
end.
I hope it is clear now that
choosing your telephone system
carefully is of vital importance
to our national security.
If there was anything more
important I'm sure there would
be television commercials about
it. Or maybe I just watch too
many male-oriented programs.
Maybe commercials for stuff
like peace talks and SDI are
shown during women's pro
gramming:
SCENE: A NATIONAL RE
SEARCH LABORATORY.
Dr. Caitlin Babb: Where is
that new high-power, multi
explosive, super-octane missile
fuel you've been developing?
Dr. Madge: You're soaking in
it.
