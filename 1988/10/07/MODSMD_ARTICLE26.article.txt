# Debating images or issues?
## Stanford scholars analyze value of presidential debates 
### Greg Filler 
Debates have stimulated presi
dential campaigns since the his
toric Hamilton-Jefferson and
Lincoln-Douglas bouts of early
American elections.
Now, with the 1988 presidential
race in the home stretch, the two
candidates are making themselves
known to the American public
through the traditional pre
election debates.
But now there's a variation on
the old theme — these debates
are televised.
And the debates themselves
have sparked debate among some
Stanford scholars who argue about
their purpose and effectiveness.
Though many political experts
said they thought the debates
have become little more than an
abundance of non-specific
answers and one-line slogans, al
most all experts agreed that the
process itself is an important one
that Americans need to keep an
eye on.
Nonetheless, even after the first
debate on Sept. 25, Americans ap
pear to be having some trouble
making up their minds. Political
scholars say that the swing voters,
or "Reagan Democrats," as they
are often called, still straddle the
party fence, stubbornly holding on
to their undecided status.
The debates seem to have done
little to change this.
"It may be hard to sway the
undecideds either way," said Po
litical Science Prof. Richard
Brody. According to Brody, the
media is more powerful than the
candidates' actual performances
for determining the debates' in
fluence on voter opinion.
"The media could not come to
a consensus on who got the best
of (the debate). In a sense, they
just continued the debate and
didn't shape people's perceptions.
I see the media's reaction as most
important," he explained.

President Mark Lemley ques

tioned the significance of the
debates as forums for outlining
the candidates' positions.
"I would like to see more time
spent on the important issues,"
said Lemley — now a law student
at UC-Berkeley. "I think too much
time is wasted on less important
issues."

polls before and after the debates
indicate that debates have little
impact in forming public opinion,
according to Lemley.
"I think that there are two
reasons for no changes in the
polls," he said. "One is that the
debate was viewed as a draw and
another reason is that many of
the people who really paid atten
tion to the debate may have al
ready made up their minds and
were just watching for reassur
ance."
On the other hand, some Stan
ford scholars said that debates are
a necessary part of the election
process, regardless of the brief,
often cursory, manner in which
they are conducted.
"I think debates are essential
because they give the American
public a better idea of what the
candidates are like," said Martin
Anderson, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution.
Communications Prof. Steven
Chaffee noted the inherent worth

of pitting any two candidates
against each other on the spot,
as done in the debates.
"I believe debates are useful in
the sense that they keep the can
didates honest," Chaffee said.
"There is a lot of negative ad
vertising going on during a cam
paign with each candidate
accusing the other one of being
potentially disastrous to America.
In a debate, things are different
because each candidate can re
spond to the other directly."
Though the practice of debating
is commonly accepted as worth
while, most professors said the
discussions should be more
substance-oriented.
"The debates seem to be more
of a clash of images rather than
ideologies," Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall said. "We do get
out some policies from them but
I think that the candidates are
there more to create a positive
image in the minds of the Amer
ican public."
"Dukakis' problem is that he is
seen as a rather humorless, un
sympathetic man and Bush has a
big advantage in that respect. The
American public as a whole seems
to be more interested in style than
substance. I would say that two
out of three elections will be
decided primarily on style. Reagan
is a prime example of that," Mar
shall added.
Conversely, Anderson credited
the present debate system with
an important role in educating the
American public before the elec
tion. "I think the debates will
make it clearer what positions
each of the candidates stand for,"
Anderson said.
"People are coming to know
where each candidate stands on
the major issues. When they come
to this knowledge, they will be
better able to make their deci
sion," he added.
Chaffee noted that given how
