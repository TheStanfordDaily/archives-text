Draw a gun, for money
It's still nine months away, but now's not too
soon to start thinking about the next James
Bond movie. Which one is this. . . . number
fifty-eight?
Next summer Timothy Dalton returns as agent
007 in "License Revoked," in which he becomes
embroiled in a personal mission of vengeance
against the tyrannical Latin American drug lord
Franz Sanchez.
In the meantime, United Artists is sponsoring
a nationwide college contest to design the pos
ter for the movie. The winner gets $5000 cash,
a preview screening at his or her school, and
the pleasure of seeing his or her artwork plas
tered on every movie theater in America.
Winners will be selected on the basis of
originality, creativity, appropriateness to the
James Bond theme (snicker) and composition.
