## Film chronicles life as Lennon 
### Gene Anaya Staff writer 
"My role in society, or any artist or
poet's role, is to try and express what
we all feel. Not to tell people how to
feel. Not as a preacher, not as a leader,
but as a reflection of us all."
— John Ono Lennon
"Imagine: John Lennon," the defini
tive biography of John Lennon — his
life, his family and his music — opens
today across the country.
Compiled and produced by award
winning filmmaker David Wolper from
more than 200 hours of private films
and videotapes released by Lennon's
widow Yoko Ono, "Imagine" captures
the essence of Lennon's life from his
early days as the witty member of the
global sensation known as The Beatles,
to his peace-activist days of the early
'70s and his family life with Ono and
son Sean.
The film is loosely based around
footage taken while Lennon was record
ing the "Imagine" album at his Titten
hurst Park home at Ascot, England.
With this as a background, Wolper and
director Andrew Stolt dispensed with a
narrator and instead chose from over
100 hours of interviews, allowing Len
non to narrate his own story.
In those interviews he talked about
most of his life, including his childhood

with his Aunt Mimi, through The
Beatles' final concert at San Francisco's
Candlestick Park and later as a solo
artist and family man.

We see Lennon in his
kitchen, in his own
private recording studio,
even in the intimacy of
his and Yoko's bedroom.
His life — as a musician,
composer, performer, art
ist, activist, husband and
father — comes vividly
alive.

The biggest challenge that Wolper
faced was the difficult process of trim
ming the footage to 100 minutes while
still telling Lennon's story with as much
truth, economy and style as befits him.
In doing this, he chose to use material
that is revealing as opposed to that
which is simply sentimental or nostalgic.
The one exception is a sequence dur
ing which a pair of wire-framed glasses
fall and shatter with the news an
nouncement of Lennon's death in the

background.
The John Lennon we see in "Imagine"
is not merely an ex-Beatle, nor just
another rock superstar. Rather, "Imag
ine" depicts the loving and caring indi
vidual that Lennon was.
We see Lennon in his kitchen, in his
own private recording studio, even in
the intimacy of his and Yoko's bedroom.
His life — as a musician, composer,
performer, artist, activist, husband and
father — comes vividly alive through
film footage never before seen by an
audience.
We see Lennon grow from a member
of an obscure British group in Ham
burg, West Germany, to being a member
of the most influential and greatest re
cording group in history.
We hear him tell of meeting and mar
rying Yoko Ono and see their
honeymoon at the Amsterdam Hilton
before the world's media as a "bed-in"
for peace.
We hear and see him record some of
"his" best songs; we see him cradle his
newborn son Sean.
"Imagine" brings to life Lennon's
music as never before. Not only do we
hear many of the old favorites — "Love
Me Do," "Twist and Shout," "Help,"
and "Strawberry Fields Forever" — but
also the later music that Lennon wrote
as he matured as a person and a
songwriter. ~
Lennon's gentle soul and artistic*bril
liance shine through in this honest pre
sentation of his life. The Lennon that
we see was a husband and father who
loved his family more than anything in
the world. We also see a man who cared
deeply about humanity; so much that
at 11:07 p.m. on Dec. 8, 1980, he gave
his life in the hope that we would all
gain something (anything, even just a
smile) from his life's work.
