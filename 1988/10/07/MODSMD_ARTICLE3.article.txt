# Phi Delta Theta fraternity on indefinite social suspension
## 
### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
The Office of Student Affairs yesterday
suspended the social privileges of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity because the fra
ternity's annual "Kamikaze" party
focused "wholly" on alcohol.
Advertising the party with the rising
sun of the Kamikaze and serving shots
of the potent drink without sufficient non
alcoholic alternatives, the Phi Delts drew
an enormous crowd last Thursday, but
also drew a harsh punishment from the
University for violating Residential Edu
cation's alcohol policy.
Officials were blunt in issuing the edict.
"The main problem was the focus wholly
on the consumption of alcohol," said Joe
Pisano, assistant dean of student affairs
and fraternal affairs adviser.
Complementing the University policy,
the Interfraternity Council adopted its
own alcohol guidelines in 1986. Written

largely by the Phi Delts, the IPC guide
lines specifically say the Kamikaze party

should be avoided.
The main problem
with the party, Pisano
said, was the scarcity of
EANABS. The "equally
attractive non-alchoholic
beverages" were neither
equally available nor
equally attractive, paling
in quantity next to the
triple sec, lime juice and

vodka drink called a Kamikaze, according
to a letter written from Pisano and Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs Diana Conklin
to Phi Delt President Russell Pangborn.
Although two four-liter cases of soda,
a fully stocked juice machine and six
half-gallons of milk existed somewhere
in the house, those EANABS could not
compare to the eight kegs of beer and
countless shots of Kamikaze available to
party-goers, wrote Pisano and Conklin.

The Phi Delts awarded a Kamikaze head
band for partiers who drank 10 Kamikaze
shots, they noted.
The crackdown means that "for an in
definite period of time" the fraternity
may not "plan, organize or participate"
in social events as a group, Pisano said.
The Kamikaze party has been a prob
lem in past years, especially in 1986 when
a student was hospitalized for a head
injury. But Pisano said yesterday's
suspension was caused primarily by this
year's party. "No one is gunning for the
Phi Delts," he said.
Upset but not surprised by the pun
ishment, Pangborn said yesterday that
at the time of the party, he thought it
had "gone smoothly." Monitors checked
for student IDs at the doors, partiers
were carded at the bar, EANABS were
available, and the police who came said
there had been no major complaints, he
said.
A fight broke out during the party but

.. .those EANABS
could not compare to
the eight kegs of beer
and countless shots of
Kamikaze available to
party-goers ...

was quickly controlled, he said.
But as a result of the University's ac
tion, Pangborn said this will be the "last
Kamikaze party."
"We realize the University does not
like the Kamikaze party because it
focuses on alcohol," he said, adding that
the fraternity "regrets" the problem it

has caused the University and is "sorry
for it."
IFC President Chris Erlin, a member
of the Kappa Alpha fraternity, agreed
that the Kamikaze party was "not a good
idea."
"Alcohol can be a part of our events,
but there is no reason for it to be the
focus," he said, adding that in the future
the IFC will work with Pisano and the
Phi Delts to "help offer positive changes."
"It just takes more creative effort and
party planning," he said.
Party-goers had different opinions
about how wild this particular frat party
actually was.
Junior Matt Brodlie, who arrived after
the Kamikaze drinks ran out, said that
although there were "tons of girls dancing
on the bar," the party was "not really
out of hand."
Sophomore Tia Yansen agreed that the
party was "no more out of control than
any other frat party."
