## Hanks scores big in 'Punchline' 
### Frank Quaratiello Editorial staff 
"Punchline" starring Sally
Field and Tom Hanks is one of
the most eagerly anticipated films
to come out of Hollywood in years.
It's also one of the most enter
taining.
The bittersweet comedy focuses
on the lives of two ordinary people
who feel the call to be stand-up
comics. Field is Lilah Krytsick, a
New Jersey housewife and mother
of three, and Hanks is brilliant
as Stephen Gold, a medical stu
dent who can't stand the sight of
blood.
While Gold is the youngster on
the verge of real success, Krytsick
is a raw newcomer, her material
simply dreadful. Working to
gether in an unlikely bond, Gold
and Krytsick try to make it in
the the world of stand-up â€” Gold
honing his material toward being
a major success, Krytsick just
trying not to be booed off the
stage.
A young medical student and a
housewife wouldn't seem to have
much in common, but their
mutual desire to perform comedy
brings them together.
The chemistry between Field
and Hanks isn't quite right, but
that doesn't drag the film down
because there are so many other
wonderful things going on. Most
importantly, the laughs are there.
This movie would quickly die if
the comedy routines were not fun
ny, but the fresh comic material
is right on target.
And it's not only the stand-up
material that is funny; when the
film is portraying suburban fam
ily life in the Krytsick household,
for instance, there are laughs
aplenty.
"Punchline" is one of those
films that makes studios uncom
fortable because it is neither a
true comedy nor a true drama.
But don't be deterred. If you go
to see "Punchline," and you
should, you'll laugh like mad in
the theater, yet have plenty to
think about when you reflect on
the movie later.
