# Comedian Will Durst on 'Punchline'
## 
### 
Professional stand-up comedian Will Durst
talks about "Punchline:"
It's hard for me to tell because I'm one of the
guys who's inside that force, so all I see are the
wrong trees, and there's some pretty wrong trees
in there. There's some good trees in there though,
too, and some nice little moments of stand-up
comedy.
A lot of it, because of the plot device, is forced
to take place all in one club, which I found a
little disconcerting. I mean, the comics have lock
ers in this club, which is unheard of. Comics
don't have lockers.
But I thought the acting — and usually it's

hard for actors to do stand-up
comedy — was impeccable. I
didn't think their material was
particularly very good, but their
timing was great. That surprised
me, that Sally Field and Tom
Hanks in such a short period of
time were able to get their timing
down.

Will Durst is a stand-up comedian popular both
