## Hard-luck Card set for battle of South Bay 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
I he similarities are numerous.
Two South-Bay football teams.
Both are playing very tough
schedules this season. Both have
played well all year. And both have
only one win.
When Stanford and San Jose
State meet in Stanford Stadium
at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow one team's
luck will have to change. Stanford,
off to a 1-3 start, has lost to three
top-20 teams, all of whom are still
undefeated. The Spartans (1-4)
have had similar bad luck, losing
two consecutive games in the
fourth quarter, at Washington
and at California.
"Obviously, getting back home
and playing this game with San
Jose will be very important in
developing and cultivating the
confidence factor of this football
team," Stanford Coach Jack El
way said.
After three well-played games,
the Cardinal's confidence took a
nose-dive in a 42-14 loss to fifth
ranked Notre Dame last Saturday.
Stanford did not put out its best
effort of the year and Elway hopes
his team will get it back together
for SJSU. "It wasn't our best ef
fort fat Notre Dame]," Elway said.
"We weren't as physical as we had
been. Obviously we can't be happy
about how we played defensive
ly. .. . We are at a point now where
we have to improve in all parts
of the game."
The Cardinal will have to do it
against an explosive Spartan de
fense and running back Johnny
Johnson, SJSU's all-purpose
back Defensively, the Spartans
run their own version of the 46
defense made famous by the
Chicago Bears a few years back.
The Stanford offense should ex
pect to see six and even seven
men pressuring the passer most
of the time. The key will be for
Stanford's offensive line to trive
the Cardinal quarterback time to
throw the ball against man-to
man coverage, and to excute plays
like screens and draws that have

the potential for big yardage.
"We've got to excute [against
the 46)," Elway said, "and it can
create a situation where you can
get the big play. . .. San Jose is
a different problem. . . . Most
people we play are 90 to 95 percent
zone defense while San Jose is 90
to 95 percent man defense. It's a
matter of a different look for us
as a steady diet. If they pressure
you and force you to throw the
ball before you want to, the ad
vantage swings to the defense."
Elway decided yesterday that he
would go with redshirt freshman
Jason Palumbis at quarterback.
Although the start will be
Palumbis' first at the collegiate
level, he has more experience than
one would think. In addition to
playing the entire second half at
Notre Dame, and playing well at
that, he ran the run-and-shoot of
fense, now utilized by Stanford,
his junior and senior years in high
school.
Dave Moss, a junior college
transfer, has stepped right into a
leadership position in his first
season at San Jose State, and
leads the team in tackles and
sacks. Stopping him and his pals
will be a Stanford offensive line
that is one of the Cardinal's
strengths.
Fullback Jon Volpe, a junior,
can also take the pressure off the
winner of the quarterback derby.
Volpe is currently ranked 20th in
the nation in rushing with a 97.8
yards-per-game average.
When the Spartans have the
ball, expect to see a lot of Johnny
Johnson. The junior has ac
counted for 556 yards of all
purpose running (rushing, receiv
ing and kick returns) in the last
two games alone. "He's a great
athlete and a great running back,"
Elway said. "He's got to be, from
what I know, one of the premier
running backs in the country."
There is no real key to stopping
Johnson; his versatility enables
him to get the ball in many dif
ferent situations. Nor can the Car
dinal take its eye off quarterback
Ken Lutz. Lutz, who missed much

of the Cal game due to a myriad
of injuries, is listed as available
for Saturday. He is averaging
235.6 yards per game in total of
fense and was 35-of-41 for well
over 300 yards to win Big West
Offensive Player-of-the-Week
honors when the Spartans lost to
Oregon State.

Defensively, Stanford will have
to bounce back from being outrun
by a very fast Notre Dame offense.
San Jose State does not have the
Irish's team speed and if inside
linebackers Jono Tunney and
Kevin Richardson can keep track
of Johnson things should go well
for the hosts in this key contest.

Also, the Cardinal will need to
pressure Lutz (if he plays), and
defensive linemen Lester Archam
beau, Ray Huckestein and Scott
F'almbush have all been playing
well lately.
Spartan Coach Claude Gilbert
summed up: "There's a certain
amount of satisfaction in being

able to stay with the competition
we've been playing. . . . [ButJ
we're a little frustrated.
Card note
While Saturday's game will not be
televised, it will be broadcast on
KZSU-90.1 with the pair of Randy
Chappel and John Platz effulging over
the airwaves.
