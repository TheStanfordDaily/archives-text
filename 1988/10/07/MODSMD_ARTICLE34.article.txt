# Women's soccer gets gutsy win
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Santa Clara Broncos burst
onto Harry Maloney F'ield yester
day to take on the Cardinal wom
en's soccer team. They entered
with their heads held high; with
them they carried their No. 17
national ranking and a scoring
arsenal including All-American
Jenni Symons. At the close of the
game, however, the picture had
changed. The final score told the
story: Cardinal 1, Broncos 0.

Women's Soccer
Cardinal 1, Broncos 0

In the first half, Santa Clara
may have had a slight edge in
ball possession and number of
scoring opportunities, but Stan
ford answered with a few offensive
flurries of its own.
Possibly fueled by the knowl
edge that they had played Santa
Clara even in the first half, the
Stanford women came out and
played with extreme confidence in
the second period. Only 10
minutes into the half, Jennifer

Rowland received the ball and
streaked down the right sideline.
As Rowland neared the Santa
Clara goal, the Bronco defense
blanketed her, and she had to
pass. She crossed to Kerri
Stivaletti, who was trailing on the
play, and the Cardinal midfielder
launched a long shot. Her attempt
leaked to the left of goal, but
Carolyn Denney was camped at
the left post and chipped in the
game's lone score.
After Denney's score, the wind
appeared to have been taken from
the Broncos' sail. Except for two
good shots by Symons, Santa
Clara could manage very little of
fensive thrust.
The Cardinal, having the
Broncos backed into a corner, con
tinued to push forward with nu
merous scoring opportunities.
Beth Egan hit Rowland cutting
down the middle of the field, and
Rowland forced Bronco goaltender
Wendy Johnson to make a dex
terous save. On another occasion,
Denise Denney got off a header
for the Cardinal offense, testing
Johnson yet another time. The
Cardinal could not put the
Broncos away, though, and the

final minutes of the game were
tense ones. The Cardinal defense
held the last Bronco attacks, and
the game ended at 1-0.
For Carolyn Denney, both the
goal and the win were extremely
significant. The scoring strike was
her fifth of the year, tying her
with Lisa Sime for the team lead.
Carolyn, a senior, is especially
appreciative of the Cardinal's
materialization as a soccer force.
She was here not only last year
during Stanford's hard luck 4-10-
4 season but also for two fruitless
years before that.
Carolyn observed, "In the past,
our team consisted of a bunch of
individuals. Now, under the guid
ance of Couch Berhane Andeber
han, we have really come together
as a team. If we continue to play
the way we now know we can
play, we might even get into the
top twenty."
Coach Berhane Andeberhan
was also quick to mention the con
fidence that his squad would gain
from the win over the Broncos.
"The girls now realize that they
are good. They were always
fighters and never gave up; now
they finally have their reward."
