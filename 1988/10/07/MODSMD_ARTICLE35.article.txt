# Volleyball's best mix it up at Maples
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The eyes of the volleyball world will
be focused on Stanford this weekend,
peering with great interest at the third
annual Josten's Invitational. Boasting
three of the top 10 teams in the nation
— No. 2 Hawaii, No. 3 Stanford and
No. 9 Texas-Arlington) as well as a
strong Santa Clara squad, the tourna
ment may very well be the most com
petitive and exciting of the year.
The opening match at 6 p.m. tonight
will feature the host Cardinal against
the local rival Broncos. Rounding out
the doubleheader, Hawaii will face
Texas-Arlington at 8 p.m. in what
should be a really tough battle for a
spot in tomorrow night's championship
match, to be played at around 8 p.m.
following the 6 p.m. consolation match
"I think it's going to be a real good
tournament, a real strong tournament,"
Stanford Coach Don Shaw said. "When
you have three of the top 10 teams in
the country, you know it's going to be
nice. Texas-Arlington is a good squad,
Hawaii is playing really well right now
and Teee Williams is Player of the Year
— it's going to be something to see."
Stanford begins its tournament play
with a weaker yet challenging opponent.
Santa Clara, 9-6 so far this season, had

a four-match winning streak snapped
Tuesday night in a non-conference
match-up with San Jose State. In con
trast, the Cardinal is fresh off a three
game win against California and is en
joying a 12-1 record, one of the best
starts in school history.
Statistically, at least, Santa Clara
stacks-up well. Three of the Bronco hit
ters — Stacie MacDonough, Rosalynn
Hortsch and Katie Hunsaker — have
accrued more than 130 kills and hitting
percentages above .240, while setter
Julie Jamile has become a defensive
force in the backcourt with her sky-high
145 digs. Though returning all six
starters from last year, Santa Clara re
mains essentially enigmatic to the Car
dinal coaching staff.
"I don't know much about them,"
Shaw confessed. "They've played some
good teams, so it's not like they've got
ten their wins off of a bunch of stiffs.
We're just going to go in and find out
as we go along."
For the Cardinal, it is the newcomers
who have been making an impact of
late. Freshman Kristin Klein has con
sistently led the squad in hitting, tally
ing 22 kills in Tuesday's win over Cal,
while classmate Amy Cooper has been
playing well enough to become this
week's Pacific 10 Conference Player of
the Week.

But the real celebrity of the tourna
ment is Williams, Hawaii's star and one
of the most dominant hitters in the
sport. The junior has been on the re
ceiving end of over half of the Rainbow
Wahines sets, and has put many of them
down with her characteristic power.
Hawaii also returns starting setter
Martina Cincerova and middle blocker
Karrie Trieschman, two strong players
that helped guide the team to the 1987
NCAA championship. With a crushing
defeat of Pacific in Stockton, the
Wahines have improved their record to
14-1 (like the Cardinal, the Wahines
sole loss came at the hands of No. 1
UCLA).
Their opponent is also potent, quickly
moving into the top 10 and seemingly
unwilling to relinquish its spot. With
the fine play of Ana de Oliviera, Texas-
Arlington has rolled out to a 10-2
opening and remains one of the most
challenging adversaries in the nation.
Though any alignment in the cham
pionship match would be a spectators
dream, the most intriguing potential
match-up would be a meeting between
Hawaii and Stanford, the defending
NCAA champion and runner-up teams.
Though Hawaii prevailed in In
dianapolis, key graduations for both
squads make a 1988 rematch a whole
new ballgame.
