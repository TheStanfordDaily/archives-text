# Polo looking for repeat wins

The Cardinal water polo team hopes the second
time around is as easy as the first. The third-ranked
squad will face UC-Irvine and Fresno State this
weekend, both of whom they have already defeated
this season.
Coming off a third-place finish in the Northern
California Tournament last weekend, Stanford, now
13-4 for the year, hosts the Anteaters Saturday at
11 a.m. After resoundingly defeating fourth-ranked
Southern California and holding number-one UCLA
to six goals, the Cardinal should have no problem
this weekend. But the sixth-ranked Irvine squad is
most likely going to be looking for vengeance.
The last time the two squads met, at the Air
Force Tournament September 25 Stanford thrashed
a more-than-competent Irvine team 16-8 for the
tournament victory. And although the Cardinal is
ranked ahead of them in the national rankings, the
Anteater players are not likely to forget the defeat.
"Irvine is going to be tougher this time because
we beat them pretty bad and they're going to be
looking for revenge," holeman Chuck Maguy said.
Irvine not only has a revenge factor but, according
to coach Dante Dettamanti, the Anteaters have a
history of playing very well when they travel to
deGuerre pool. The Cardinal defense will be on the
alert for Irvine. Two- meter man Tome Warde as
well as Tony Bell, the squad's main outside-shooting
threat. But the Anteaters' starting goalie is red
shirting the season, forcing the squad to use its
second-string player.
"We seem to do well against teams which don't
have a real good goalie, but we still have to increase
the quality of our shots," Dettamanti said.
Sunday, the Cardinal travels to the Central Valley
where it will face eighth- ranked Fresno State.
Stanford was the victor in this previous match as
well, defeating the Bulldogs 8-4 at the Irvine Tour
nament September 17. For this second contest the
Cardinal squad is more worried about the officiating
than its opponent, however.

"The referees are not terribly experienced in
Fresno, so whenever we play there we always end
up with some type of wild game," said Maguy, a
native of nearby Vasalia.
The Bulldogs, who are coming off a 13-5 drubbing
of UC-Santa Barbara in the NorCal Tournament,
basically have a one-man offense. The team relies
heavily on two-meter man Stefan Pollman, a mem
ber of the German Junior National Team. Only a
third of the way into the season, the holeman has
already tallied 50 goals and 81 assists.
"If we play our best we should beat both Irvine
and Fresno but both games are prime upset situ
ations," Dettamanti said.
Stanford will be counting on leading scorers Jon
SwerdlofT (31 goals) and holeman Erik Blum (27
goals) to carry the team offensively. In addition,
the Cardinal will be looking for offensive production
from sophomore Rick McNair and senior Andrew
Lawson.
Stanford's offense, like the rest of collegiate water
polo, is becoming increasingly dependent on outside
shooting. According to Dettamanti, McNair is the
squad's best outside shooter, and Lawson has also
become a central figure in the new offense due to
the advantage a lefthander provides.
Due to the alteration of the way referees call the
games, United States water polo has had to com
pletely change collegiate offense during the past
year. To protect the goalies, referees are now calling
fouls according to international rules, which has
forced every NCAA team to switch from using a
driving attack to relying on outside shooting because
of the zone defense now used to guard the goal.
Stanford, always a strong driving team, has had to
completely reformulate its offense.
The Cardinal six has picked up the new style
quickly, as attested by its record and national
ranking. But Dettamanti still sees room for im
provement. "We need more scoring from our drivers,
Steve Millham and Colin Keely, and we're going to
be counting on Lawson even more," he said. "Since
we're no longer playing a driving game we have to
score more from the outside."
