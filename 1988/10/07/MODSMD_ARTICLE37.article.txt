# Golf hosts national invite
## 
### Eugene Sakai 
Having just finished an im
pressive second out of twenty
four teams in the Wolfpack In
vitational in Reno, the Stanford
mens' golf team faces the diffi
cult task of trying to maintain
that momentum in their own
invitational, to be played this
weekend on the Stanford Golf
Course.
Whereas the Reno tourna
ment featured teams primarily
from the Western region, Stan
ford Coach Wally Goodwin was
able to secure a 23-team field
with a distinctly national em
phasis. Included are such pow
erhouses as Florida Southern, a
perennial contender for the na
tional title at the Division II
level. Also competing will be
Vanderbilt, Wisconsin, Utah,
Rice, and Virginia, all tradi
tional powers and teams that
expect to be in the hunt for the
national championship this year
as well.
The Cardinal quintet will con
sist of the golfers that have per
formed the best this past week.
Junior Brad Joondeph led the
Cardinal to their finish at Reno,
carding the low score for the
team. Goodwin said of Joon
deph, "He's been working really
hard on his golf in the last year
and-a-half, had a great summer,
and played very well for us (at
Reno)."
The other top scorers in the

Nevada tourney were Brad
Geer, Don Christensen, and
Mark Funseth, who will be
joined this week by Christian
Cevaer, a freshman from Paris.
Cevaer, who won the British
Youth Amateur this past sum
mer and shot rounds of 72 and
73 in a match against Menlo
College this week, feels confi
dent about the team's chances
this weekend. "The guy 3 need
to be playing well, but we can
win it,"he said.
Winning the tourney would
be a tremendous boost for the
team's post-season chances and
confidence level, but Coach
Goodwin sees this weekend as
more of an opportunity to eval
uate how his players have
progressed since last season.
"We are mostly going to just
ok and see what they have
learned over the course of the
summer. At this time of the
year, 1 am trying to find the
seven or eight or nine guys who
are the most competitive," he
said.
The fact that the Cardinal
linksters will be playing on
familiar turf can only be a plus
for the team. "The home course
advantage is going to be worth
a couple of shots," said Good
win, adding that sleeping in
familiar beds and eating
familiar (if not tasty) food is
another edge that Stanford will
have over the opposition.
Although Goodwin is trying

to downplay the significance of
the Stanford Invitational, there
is no doubt that a strong finish
at home would give the Regional
tournament selection committee
something to ruminate on come
May.
The format of the post-season
tournament was altered some
what this year, and though the
Cardinal must perform well
throughout the season in order
to be chosen as one of the 18
teams to compete in the Western
Regionals in Albuquerque, they
must fare particularly well
against rivals from the West, as
they did this past week.
By performing well in
Regionals, a team can now play
its way into the NCAA tourna
ment. However, the politics that
formerly surrounded the na
tional tournament selection
process have not been elimi
nated, but simply moved down
to the regional level.
Politics aside for the moment,
Goodwin is looking forward to
having a good time this week
end, being reunited with many
of his old friends in the coaching
ranks as well as enjoying the
quality of the play.
"There's going to be some
great golf play," Goodwin said,
"but if all five (of Stanford's)
guys are rolling along smoothly,
you never can tell what can hap
pen because we have a couple
of guys who are capable of really
smashing par."
