# Soccer psyched for Pac-10 tourney
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
Ihe Stanford men's soccer
team, coming off an inspiring per
formance last weekend in their
own home tournament, will find
out exactly what the phrase
"home turf' means as they travel
to California's Memorial Stadium
for this weekend's annual Pacific
10 Conference Tournament.
Joining Stanford in the field
will be UCLA, Washington, and
host team Cal — all solid teams
which need a good showing to
propel them into the post-season.
But the factor which separates
the four comparable clubs is the
playing surface, Memorial's artifi
cial grass. Cal and Washington
will be decidedly more comforta
ble due to the fact that both prac
tice and play all their home games
on turf.

'We're 7-5, but our confidence is back. That's
what's really important. We lost to Portland,
but we could've won that game'
— Rhett Harty

The Cardinal, defending
champs in the tournament and
7-5 on the year, has yet to play
a single game this season on turf.
Although the team made an early
morning trek yesterday to prac
tice on the field, Stanford is lucky
in that the schedule allows them
to play Washington in the second
game and avoid California al
ltogether.
"Playing on turf is a big adjust
ment," said freshman forward
Rhett Harty. "The whole game is
so much faster. We're going to
have to concentrate a lot to play
well. Hopefully, after we play
UCLA on Saturday we'll be a little
better prepared."
Perhaps more of a factor than
the surface will be the Cardinal's
play this weekend. The team
enetered last weekend's AT&T
tournament here at Stanford in
the funk of a four-game losing
streak, but put an end to that
with a 2-0 win over Simon Fraser.
Bolstered, they followed the win
with perhaps their best perform
ance this year, a tight 1-0 loss to

3rd-ranked Portland in Sunday's
final.
"We're 7-5, but our confidence
is back. That's what's really im
portant. We lost to Portland, but
we could've won that game,"
Harty said.
Confidence seems to be what
makes or breaks coach Sam
Koch's team. Last year, Stanford
scored two big upsets in a row by
defeating University of San Fran
cisco and Fresno State. Riding
that high, they went on to win
the combined AT&T/Pac-lO tour
nament with big victories over
Washington and But im
mediately afterwards, the Cardi
nal lost that edge, and dropped
five of their last eight games.
This time around, the team
seems determined to prevent a col
lapse. "Usually there is a letdown
after games," sweeper Mark Semi-

oli observed. "I don't think we've
had that. I think we've kept the
intensity up, and hopefully it's
going to pay off."
This weekend's game should
provide some intensity, with the
UCLA game Saturday looming
large in the minds of the Stanford
hooters. At 5-4-1, the Bruins'
record is misleadingly mediocre.
UCLA started off 0-3, thanks to
a schedule that pitted them
against the nation's number-one,
six, and 13 teams. They bounced
back to knock off national power
Connecticut, 1-0.
Despite losing some key seniors
last year and others this year to
injury and academics, the Bruins
are explosive and are led by junior
forward Bill Thompson, who has
three goals and six assists so far.
"We definitely have to stop
Thompson," Koch stated.
The game will be a rematch of
last year's Pac-10 Tournament
final, in which Stanford beat
UCLA for the first time ever, 1-0.
And while this may give UCLA
extra incentive this year, it has

given the Cardinal a psychological
edge. "We finally got the monkey
off our backs. UCLA is just an
other school now," Semioli said.
Although not a traditional soc
cer power with a rough schedule
like UCLA, Washington is 7-2 this
year and playing well. The
Huskies are winners of six
straight, and goalkeeper Jeff Koch
has three shutouts while never
allowing more than one goal in a

game. They are led by forward
Glenn Howell with five goals, and
5'3" fourth-year junior Eddie
Henderson with three goals.
Winning this tournament would
be a real accomplishment, but the
Cardinal feels that it has reached
a level of play where they can do
that and more. As Semioli simply
stated, "If we keep playing the
way we played against Portland,
we won't lose again."

Bolstered, they followed the win
with perhaps their best perform
ance this year, a tight 1-0 loss to

3rd-ranked Portland in Sunday's
final.
"We're 7-5, but our confidence
is back. That's what's really im
portant. We lost to Portland, but
we could've won that game,"
Harty said.
Confidence seems to be what
makes or breaks coach Sam
Koch's team. Last year, Stanford
scored two big upsets in a row by
defeating University of San Fran
cisco and Fresno State. Riding
that high, they went on to win
the combined AT&T/Pac-lO tour
nament with big victories over
Washington and But im
mediately afterwards, the Cardi
nal lost that edge, and dropped
five of their last eight games.
This time around, the team
seems determined to prevent a col
lapse. "Usually there is a letdown
after games," sweeper Mark Semi-

oli observed. "I don't think we've
had that. I think we've kept the
intensity up, and hopefully it's
going to pay off."
This weekend's game should
provide some intensity, with the
UCLA game Saturday looming
large in the minds of the Stanford
hooters. At 5-4-1, the Bruins'
record is misleadingly mediocre.
UCLA started off 0-3, thanks to
a schedule that pitted them
against the nation's number-one,
six, and 13 teams. They bounced
back to knock off national power
Connecticut, 1-0.
Despite losing some key seniors
last year and others this year to
injury and academics, the Bruins
are explosive and are led by junior
forward Bill Thompson, who has
three goals and six assists so far.
"We definitely have to stop
Thompson," Koch stated.
The game will be a rematch of
last year's Pac-10 Tournament
final, in which Stanford beat
UCLA for the first time ever, 1-0.
And while this may give UCLA
extra incentive this year, it has

given the Cardinal a psychological
edge. "We finally got the monkey
off our backs. UCLA is just an
other school now," Semioli said.
Although not a traditional soc
cer power with a rough schedule
like UCLA, Washington is 7-2 this
year and playing well. The
Huskies are winners of six
straight, and goalkeeper Jeff Koch
has three shutouts while never
allowing more than one goal in a

game. They are led by forward
Glenn Howell with five goals, and
5'3" fourth-year junior Eddie
Henderson with three goals.
Winning this tournament would
be a real accomplishment, but the
Cardinal feels that it has reached
a level of play where they can do
that and more. As Semioli simply
stated, "If we keep playing the
way we played against Portland,
we won't lose again."

Ihe Stanford men's soccer
team, coming off an inspiring per
formance last weekend in their
own home tournament, will find
out exactly what the phrase
"home turf' means as they travel
to California's Memorial Stadium
for this weekend's annual Pacific
10 Conference Tournament.
Joining Stanford in the field
will be UCLA, Washington, and
host team Cal — all solid teams
which need a good showing to
propel them into the post-season.
But the factor which separates
the four comparable clubs is the
playing surface, Memorial's artifi
cial grass. Cal and Washington
will be decidedly more comforta
ble due to the fact that both prac
tice and play all their home games
on turf.

'We're 7-5, but our confidence is back. That's
what's really important. We lost to Portland,
but we could've won that game'
— Rhett Harty

The Cardinal, defending
champs in the tournament and
7-5 on the year, has yet to play
a single game this season on turf.
Although the team made an early
morning trek yesterday to prac
tice on the field, Stanford is lucky
in that the schedule allows them
to play Washington in the second
game and avoid California al
ltogether.
"Playing on turf is a big adjust
ment," said freshman forward
Rhett Harty. "The whole game is
so much faster. We're going to
have to concentrate a lot to play
well. Hopefully, after we play
UCLA on Saturday we'll be a little
better prepared."
Perhaps more of a factor than
the surface will be the Cardinal's
play this weekend. The team
enetered last weekend's AT&T
tournament here at Stanford in
the funk of a four-game losing
streak, but put an end to that
with a 2-0 win over Simon Fraser.
Bolstered, they followed the win
with perhaps their best perform
ance this year, a tight 1-0 loss to

3rd-ranked Portland in Sunday's
final.
