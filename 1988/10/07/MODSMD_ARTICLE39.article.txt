## Athletics take command 
### 
BOSTON (AP) - Roger
Clemens ran out of gas and
Oakland ran the Red Sox out
town.
Clemens pitched a two-hitter
for six innings Thursday night
but gave up three runs in the
seventh. The Boston Red Sox
lost Game 2 of the American
League playoffs to Oakland 4-3
and fell behind 2-0 in the best
of-seven pennant playoff.
"I went out and pitched my
type of game," said Clemens,
who has won only one of six
postseason starts. "I did what
I wanted to do. But basically,
I just ran out of gas. I went
right at them as hard as I
could, as long as I could. My
body didn't get tired, but my
arm did."
Clemens, who won only three
of his last 10 decisions, while
finishing with an 18-12 record,
dressed in the trainer's room
before coming out to face
reporters.
"I feel pretty bad about the
team losing," he said. "I battled
but I'm not dissatisfied with
the way I threw the ball. I
threw the ball extremely well
and hard."
Athletics' manager Tony La
Russa was pleased that the
winning run scored on ninth
inning singles by Ron Hassey,
Tony Phillips and Walt Weiss
rather than the usual A's hit
ting stars.
"That's one reason we're
having a heck of a year, because
we're getting contributions up
and down the lineup," he said.
Storm Davis, who didn't get
a decision despite allowing just
two unearned runs in 6 1-3
innings, said he wasn't un
nerved by a fan running onto
the field when he was one
strike away from ending the
Red Sox's sixth uneventfully.
Boston went on to score two

unearned runs after the delay
on a pair of walks and Hen
derson's error.
"I try not to get too carried
away with anything out there,"
Davis said. "As soon as it hap
pened, Hassey came out to the
mound and said 'let's get right
back to work.' At least only
two runs scored."
Mark McGwire drove in the
A's other run with a single off
Clemens. He had been 0-for-10
with six strikeouts against the
Red Sox right-hander in his
career.
"It was a big hit for me,"
McGwire said. "He was throw
ing very hard. He only threw
me one breaking ball that
whole at-bat. The rest was all
tf
gas.
With the game scoreless in
the sixth and Dwight Evans
and Mike Greenwell on base,
Jim Rice hit a two-out liner to
center. Dave Henderson
bobbled and dropped the ball
for an error, allowing Evans to
score. Ellis Burks followed with
a single that drove in Greenwell
and Boston led 2-0.
"When he came back to the
dugout after the error, he
wasn't moping or kicking him
self, he just wanted to get a
hit," La Russa said. "He should
be proud of himself, I know
we're proud of him."
Henderson earlier made an
over-the-shoulder catch of Ellis
Burks' 400-foot drive to the
right-center field warning track
with two outs and one on in
the fourth, saving a run. Hen
derson said he got a good jump
on Burks' ball but that Rice's
ball was sinking, and he mis
judged it.
"You know me, I've got a
positive side to everything," he
said. "I just looked at it as one
more error. ... I just wanted
to get the team going after
that."
