# Campus sign system draws criticism
## 
### Robert Landon 
Three new signs on Campus Drive
point the way to Stern Hall from Es
condido Road, past Bowdoin Street and
Cowell Lane, and right into a bollard
blocked fire lane next to Wilbur Hall.
This road to nowhere upsets Valerie
Phillips, resident fellow of Stern's Twain
House. "We are concerned about the
total neglect of this poor old dorm,"
Phillips said.
The third-largest student residence on
campus, Stern is mentioned three times
in a new $320,000 road sign system
installed by the University beginning
this summer, but the signs lead neither
to the dorm's front entrance nor its rear
parking lot.
The confusion was especially prob

lematic during Freshman Orientation.
At that time, police were alerted of the
problem and extra signs were installed
temporarily, Phillips said.
Besides the Stern misdirection, other
problems with the new sign system in
clude directions that conflict with the
remaining old signs and hedges that
obscure some of the new ones.
The University planned to complete
the project by the beginning of fall quar
ter, but 45 signs and several campus
directories remain to be installed.
Twenty of those signs will remind
drivers that they are on Campus Drive
by depicting a red circle.
John Lerry, the facilities engineer in
charge of the project, said, "Reactions
[to the signs] have been good. We are
offering a better-quality sign." He ad

mitted, though, that "there are still
some glitches that need to be worked
out in the system."
The campus badly needed the new
signs, Lerry said. The old ones were
expensive to keep up, he said, because
they were rickety and often needed
repainting. And most important, the
signs offer a "new way of organizing
the campus that gradually brings the
driver into the campus," Lerry said.
Even Phillips agrees that "the new
signs are an aesthetic improvement over
the old ones." But she expressed disap
pointment in the oversight of Stern, es
pecially in light of all the time and
money that have apparently gone into
the project. "The omission makes me
wonder what kind of proofing and
reproofing went on," Phillips said.
