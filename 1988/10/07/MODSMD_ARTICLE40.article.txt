Well folks, just like Freddie
Krueger, the Greek-of-the-Week is
back. We are proud to bring back
the annual Daily tradition of
taking a collection of editors and
writers from the sports depart
ment and giving them every
chance in the world to humiliate
themselves. Publicly.
Before we begin, however, let
us get in a disclaimer. Gambling
on football games is illegal in Cal
ifornia, so please don't use this
column for such means. And if
you do, please share the wealth.
The Guest Greek this week is
Stanford co-Sports Information
Director Bob Vazquez. After his
numerous years here, "Vaz" is ob
viously quite an expert on football
In perhaps his final act as a
free man, Vaz has graced us with
his wisdom. He is marrying Ath
letic Dept. travel agent Sharon
Smith this Sunday, and in the
one piece of seriousness and sen
timentality of this article we'd like
to wish you all the best on your
life together, guys.
Now, an introduction to our
regular cast of characters: First,
alphabetically, we have Chris
Crader. As the football beat
writer, "Crades" should be ex
pected to have the inside edge on
the competition. But he picked
Stanford over Notre Dame last
week. This week he thinks UCLA
will beat Oregon State 56-1.
"[Beaver quarterback] Erik Wil
helm will hit a solo home run in
the bottom half of the fourth
quarter," he said. "Or maybe the

Bruins will get so confused by
scoring so much that they'll kick
one of their extra points the
wrong way."
Next up is Cardinal Today co
editor Dave Earnest. The former
Daily fencing writer has moved to
editing everyone's favorite thing
to sit on at games. Earnest, a
Colorado native, picked basically
the favorites, only tabbing
Colorado (of course) as an upset
winner.
Sports editor Cameron Macky
gets the guts award this week,
not only picking Pitt (his home
town boys) over No. 5 Notre
Dame, but also calling for a tie
in the Michigan-Michigan State
contest. Wow.
Robert Pardington, the other
Card Today editor and erstwhile
women's soccer scribe, decided to
wade slowly into the pool of
Greekdom, going with the
favorites.
Daily executive editor Mark Ro
gowsky, who is also the football
sidebar writer, is another conser
vative sort this week although a
good bet is that he will find him
self climbing out on a few limbs
before the year is out. And for
those of you keeping score, he's
a Mets fan.
Last, we have Bruce "the
Shark" Sarkisian, the other sports
editor and the other Mets fan. He
joins Earnest in favoring the
Colorado Buffaloes. Why?, we ask.
He likes the CU emblem on their
helmets. Sounds good to me.
Until next week, farewell.

will beat Oregon State 56-1.
"[Beaver quarterback] Erik Wil
helm will hit a solo home run in
the bottom half of the fourth
quarter," he said. "Or maybe the

Bruins will get so confused by
scoring so much that they'll kick
one of their extra points the
wrong way."
Next up is Cardinal Today co
editor Dave Earnest. The former
Daily fencing writer has moved to
editing everyone's favorite thing
to sit on at games. Earnest, a
Colorado native, picked basically
the favorites, only tabbing
Colorado (of course) as an upset
winner.
Sports editor Cameron Macky
gets the guts award this week,
not only picking Pitt (his home
town boys) over No. 5 Notre
Dame, but also calling for a tie
in the Michigan-Michigan State
contest. Wow.
Robert Pardington, the other
Card Today editor and erstwhile
women's soccer scribe, decided to
wade slowly into the pool of
Greekdom, going with the
favorites.
Daily executive editor Mark Ro
gowsky, who is also the football
sidebar writer, is another conser
vative sort this week although a
good bet is that he will find him
self climbing out on a few limbs
before the year is out. And for
those of you keeping score, he's
a Mets fan.
Last, we have Bruce "the
Shark" Sarkisian, the other sports
editor and the other Mets fan. He
joins Earnest in favoring the
Colorado Buffaloes. Why?, we ask.
He likes the CU emblem on their
helmets. Sounds good to me.
Until next week, farewell.

Well folks, just like Freddie
Krueger, the Greek-of-the-Week is
back. We are proud to bring back
the annual Daily tradition of
taking a collection of editors and
writers from the sports depart
ment and giving them every
chance in the world to humiliate
themselves. Publicly.
Before we begin, however, let
us get in a disclaimer. Gambling
on football games is illegal in Cal
ifornia, so please don't use this
column for such means. And if
you do, please share the wealth.
The Guest Greek this week is
Stanford co-Sports Information
Director Bob Vazquez. After his
numerous years here, "Vaz" is ob
viously quite an expert on football
In perhaps his final act as a
free man, Vaz has graced us with
his wisdom. He is marrying Ath
letic Dept. travel agent Sharon
Smith this Sunday, and in the
one piece of seriousness and sen
timentality of this article we'd like
to wish you all the best on your
life together, guys.
Now, an introduction to our
regular cast of characters: First,
alphabetically, we have Chris
Crader. As the football beat
writer, "Crades" should be ex
pected to have the inside edge on
the competition. But he picked
Stanford over Notre Dame last
week. This week he thinks UCLA
will beat Oregon State 56-1.
"[Beaver quarterback] Erik Wil
helm will hit a solo home run in
the bottom half of the fourth
quarter," he said. "Or maybe the

Bruins will get so confused by
