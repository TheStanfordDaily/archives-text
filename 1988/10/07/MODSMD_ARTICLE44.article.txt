A story in Monday's Daily in
correctly identified Lucy Williams.
She is facilities manager for Row
and Cluster houses. The same
story stated that students were
fined for rekeying two residences.
They were not fined, but rather
charged for the rekeying.
A story in Wednesday's Daily
attributed a quote made by Sub
odh Chandra, chair of the Stan
ford Democrats, to Marian Sul
livan, Stanford Democrats' organ
izer. Chandra said Repbulican
congressional candidate Tom
Campbell uses "smooth talk and
congeniality" and called him
"hand-picked nationally, locally
and state-wide to mimic public
opinion polls."
Finally, a story in Thursday's
Daily incorrectly identified the
Student Labor Support Council as
the Labor Relations Council.
