# Prop. 102 would outlaw anonymity in AIDS testing
## 
### Mark Richman 
If California votes in favor of Proposition
102 in the Nov. 8 general election, AIDS
testing would no longer be anonymous,
tests for the AIDS virus would be a required
part of routine blood test procedures, and
partner notification would be mandatory.

CAMPAIGN

The Dannemeyer Initiative calls for man
datory AIDS testing of routine blood tests.
Public health officials would then be
notified by personal physicians of individ
uals wk, tested positive for the HIV virus,
the initial stage of the disease. Sexual
partners would then be contacted to com
plete the partner notification procedure.
Noncompliance with releasing names of
sexual partners would be grounds for crim
inal charges

Brett Barbre, an aid for Rep. William
Dannemeyer, R-Orange County, said the
bill would slow the spread of the AIDS
virus by making more asymptomatic car
riers of the disease aware of their condition
through mandatory tests. The bill is de
signed, he explained, "to reach people who
are HIV infected when they are
asymptomatic. The individual will change
his behavior to prevent the spread of the
disease." Researchers say that 90 percent
of Californians with AIDS don't know
about their condition, which contributes to
the spread of the disease.
However, opponents of Prop. 102 fear
that the bill will "undo successful work
that has been done to reduce infections in
high-risk populations." A representative
from Cali" nians Against 102 said that
"there is success in urban settings in elim
inating (infections) that is attributable to
education and anonymous testing." The
fear of others knowing will deter high-risk
individuals from seeking tests that can lead
to early treatment and further re
search.
According to Barbre, employers
and insurance agents will not have
access through public officials to
test results, thereby eliminating
the threat of discrimination in
those areas. But in matters of
public health, since the HIV virus
is listed as an "infectious, com
municable disease" in the bill, the
test results will be divulged,
reopening the possibility of dis
crimination.
As a result, all sero-positive
food handlers and school employ
ees would tye fired. And children
carrying the HIV virus could be
banned from schools. Both cases
reintroduce the threat of discrim
ination. Since the tests are not
100-percent effective, many names
would be given to public officials
and sexual histories exposed with
out any confirmation of infection.
Barbre said proponents believe
that since the bill is not designed
to hurt anybody, the bill is not a
threat to anyone and therefore
the public deserve the right to
determine California's AIDS pol
icies. However, opponents argue
that "the epidemic should be
placed in the hands of medical
professionals and AIDS experts"
rather than on the ballot, where
uninformed voters will react emo
tionally rather than rationally to
the threat of AIDS.
