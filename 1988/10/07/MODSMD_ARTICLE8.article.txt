"Who is winning in Campaign '88?
The campaign consultants. How is the
campaign going? Dismally."
That was the judgment of San Jose
Mercury News Reporter Susan Yoachum
at Branner Hall yesterday in a panel
discussion of political journalists cover
ing this year's presidential election.
All five television and newspaper jour
nalists on the panel agreed that the
campaign lacks substance and may ul
timately harm the American public.
While the campaign consultants are

"playing their game-plan to perfection,"
Yoachum said, their plans "unfortun
ately leaves a lot of us out of the proc
ess." A timid media has failed to make
the candidates address the issues, she
said.
The other panelists included Gordon
Earle of the MacNeil-liehrer News Hour,
Brenda Payton of The Tribune in Oak
land, John Henry of the Austin
American-Statesman and Peter Shapen
of KRON-TV in San Francisco.

night s debate In Branner. Other pictured panelists included are, from left to
right, Gordon Earle, Susan Yoachum and John Henry.
Citing Republican vice
presidential candidate Dan
Quayle's indignation over ques
tions about his military record,
Henry said the "character issue"
is of great importance to the
public because it gets to the
"heart of how [a candidate] will
behave in other issues."
At one point in Wednesday's
vice-presidential debate, Quayle
was asked what he would do if
he were to become president, and
replied that he would say a prayer
and call a meeting. Henry, in turn,
replied last night: "It better be a
good prayer. It better be a pow
erful prayer."
Earle, senior producer of The
MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour, said
that Democratic presidential can
didate Michael Dukakis has "a
slight edge" in the race, despite
national polls showing a slight
lead for Vice President Bush since
August. However, Earle said he
remains "a little disappointed" in
Dukakis. Citing a Dukakis speech
he covered in New York, Earle
said the Massachusetts governor
spoke only in "generalities and
platitudes."
The campaign has broken down
to "sniping" and "personalities,"
Earle said, instead of issues, at a
time when the United States must
make important foreign policy and
economic decisions. Earle said he
fears the American public will be
"fed up with politics" at a time
when politics should be of "crucial
interest."

KRON-TV Editor Shapen de
scribed his job as a "daily battle
not to be manipulated by the cam
paigns." The Reagan Administra
tion's careful handling of White
House press coverage has led to
a general trend of press manipu
lation by all politicians, he said,
calling it a "hidden danger" in
politics. During the vice
presidential debate, Shapen noted,
Quayle "didn't answer the ques
tions, but he never failed to look
into the camera."
office," said Payton, a columnist
for The Tribune. "Campaigns
have now deteriorated to carefully
constructed images and one-liners
that make the whole process ir
relevant and meaningless," she
said.
The '88 campaign is among "the
least substantive" she and many
of her colleagues have seen, said
Payton, warning that the lack of
substance will lead to "increasing
voter apathy." Only about half of
all eligible voters actually vote on
election day, according to Payton.
But that alarming fact is not
solely the voters' fault, Payton
said. Both the campaigns and the
media share responsiblity for the
unbroken string of "images and
one-liners."
Joining the media and the cam
paigns as accomplices to the fraud
is the American public, Payton
said. Quite simply, she said, the
public fails to "back up the press"
when the press digs for more com
plete answers. If the public re
mains satisfied with one-minute
commercials then there is no pres
sure for either candidate to an
swer real questions, she said.
