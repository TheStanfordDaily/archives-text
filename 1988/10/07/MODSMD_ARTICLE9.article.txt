'Friday Noon Live!'
gets underway today
University President Donald
Kennedy will launch a campus
wide "Friday Noon Live!" lecture
series with a talk titled "Scenarios
for 2010" at noon today in Frost
Amphitheater.
The Band also will be a part of
the opening festivities.
In the fall of 1987, Linda Heider

ministrators in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences who were
interested in establishing a
speakers series on campus. The
group now includes 17 staff mem
bers from departments through
out the University.
The committee, which has re
ceived support and funding from
the Human Resources Council
and the Human Resources Man
agement Staff, has planned a se
ries in which noted individuals
from various parts of the Univer
sity will speak about current re
search, unique accomplishments,
and other issues and ideas per
taining to scholarly life.
The remaining lectures are as
follows:
Dec. 2, Wolfgang Panofsky, direc
tor emeritus of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center;
Jan. 13, Herant Katchadourian,
professor of psychiatry and
human biology;
March 10, Dr. Bruce Parker, pro

fessor of radiology and pediatrics;
April 21, Dr. John Farquhar, pro
fessor of medicine and director of
the Stanford Center for Research
in Disease Prevention;
May 19, Condoleezza Rice, asso

RAF II construction
budget increased
University trustees have ap
proved a $1.3 million increase in
the budget for the Research An
imal Facility 11, now under con
struction.
The increase, from $16,945,000
to $18,245,000, was caused pri
marily by the delay in construc
tion resulting from an appeal by
the Palo Alto Humane Society of
the use permit for the facility, the
trustees were told by University
staff in a report seeking the funds.
That appeal, and the conse
quent need for an Environmental
Impact Report, delayed the start
of construction for almost a year.
Santa Clara County supervisors
finally approved the project in
June of this year and construction
started shortly after that.
The report to the trustees
recommending the increase said
that at least 80 percent of the
$1.3 million could be attributed
to the delay. Costs related to the
delay include the rise in construc
tion costs, professional fees for
the EIR consultants and fees for

a change in construction plans for
a utility tunnel linking the RAF
II with the Beckman Center for
Molecular and Genetic Medicine.
When it is completed, the RAF
II will house approximately
50,000 animals.
Campus Report
Reagan Library
gets final approval
Nearly a year-and-a-half after
Stanford's loss of the Reagan
Presidential Library to the Uni
versity of Southern California,
a county planning commission
gave final approval last week
for the construction of the $30-
million library.
The Ventura County planning
commission voted last week to
grant a conditional use permit
for the library site. Air pollu
tion, traffic and ecological prob
lems were resolved in early Sep
tember, allowing construction to
begin next month.
However, plans by the private
developers who donated the land
for a hotel, conference center
and private housing near the
100-acre library site were
dropped after Reagan-library of
ficials expressed concern about
the possible overuse of the un
incorporated area.
Earlier, officials dropped
plans for a Center for Public
Affairs that would be part of
the overall library project.
