they're against a little progress.
That's why when they set
out to make a waterproof shoe
they were the first to use a
Gore-tex liner. Gore-tex
technology allows body
moisture to escape but prevents
water from entering. The
result is a shoe collection
called Watermocs traditionally
styled footwear that keeps
your feet warm and dry no
matter what the weather.
Watermocs 'Lindsey,' with hand
stitched, oil-stuffed leather
uppers and durable lug soles.
In brown, sizes 7-13 m; 110.00.
Stanford Shopping Center only,
in Men's Shoes.
