# Englehardt excels in Stanford defense
## Former special teams player finds place as secondary's 'intense' leader 
### T.C. Hall 
One of the many rituals upon
arriving at Stanford (or any new
school) is the practice of defining
one's identity.
Whether this practice is part of
getting acquainted in freshman
english class or the dorm, students
are usually asked to find some
words to describe themselves.
When Stanford strong safety Rob
Englehardt arrived on the farm
in 1985, he found the situation
no different.
When asked to use an adjective
to describe himself, he had little
trouble finding that word. The
freshman from Florida chose 'in
tense.'
Webster's Dictionary defines in
tense as "exciting in an extreme
degree". Englehardt personifies
this definition. Just ask his team
mates.
"He's a red-hot, he gets excited
at every play," Stanford corner
back Alan Grant said.
Although he came out of high
school as a linebacker, Englehardt
has spent most of his three years
here on special teams, more re
cently acting as an on-field 'body
guard' for Grant on punt returns.
He obviously did his job well.
Grant lead the nation in punt
return average last season.
If asked about this accomplish
ment, Englehardt will smile but
quickly point out that he is only
one of the many people on the
field doing their job.
Grant, however, knows the
value of his body guard. "He is
consistent, he does his job. He
always gets the most dangerous
[opponent]," Grant said.

Words of respect follow
Englehardt everywhere, words
like consistent, disciplined, and
his own choice, intense. Team
mates say that he rarely smiles
on the field, but always claps after
plays and keeps people motivated
and going.
Englehardt was born on Jan.
25, 1967. Though originally from
San Diego, his family moved to
Tampa Bay, Florida, where he at
tended Plant High School. At
Plant, Englehardt excelled at foot
ball. In his senior year as a team
captain, he led the team on de
fense from the linebacker position
with 95 solo tackles and 50 assists.
He also had 10 sacks and two
interceptions. As a result, he was
named first team All-State, All-
Hillsborough County and All-
Western Conference.
With the acclaim came phone
calls from college coaches.
Englehardt had many choices, but
chose Stanford for the educational
opportunites, not the football pro
gram.
"I just thought, 'lf I blew my
knee on the first day of practice,
where I would want to be?' I
decided on Stanford," he said.
When Englehardt came to Stan
ford, however, he had more to
worry about than possible inju
ries. At only 6-foot-1 and 195
pounds, his large frame in high
school was now too small for a
major college linebacker. After a
redshirt season in 1985,
Englehardt switched from line
backer to strong safety and began
to play special teams. In 1986, he
had nine total tackles as he de
veloped as a player.
When the 1987 season began,

Englehardt found himself the
second-string safety behind All-
Pacific 10 Conference performer
Brad Humphreys. "He was
waiting in the wings," secondary
coach Sonny Lubick said.
But his talents as a player did
not go unnoticed. Englehardt be
came Stanford's nickel back on
defense (replacing the inside line
backer on special plays) and
finished the year with 36 total
tackles (13 unassisted), one sack,

one interception and Stanford's
only safety of the season (against
Oregon).
After Brad Humphreys' gradu
ation, Englehardt moved into a
starting position. After paying his
dues on special teams and seeing
only limited playing time, he
gladly accepted the added respon
sibility of a starter.
He has had little trouble ad
justing to that role, as evidenced
by his two sacks against highly

ranked USC. His 37 total tackles
tie him for third on the team this
season.
These statistics make
Englehardt happy, but trying to
look good on paper is not why he
plays. He began to play football
when he was eight to release the
agression and extra energy he felt
as a kid.
Not much has changed since.

Rob Englehardt, Stanford's starting strong safety, has spearheaded a surprisingly stingy pass defense
with his two interceptions this season.
