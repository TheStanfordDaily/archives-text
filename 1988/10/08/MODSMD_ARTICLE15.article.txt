# Redshirting tests patience of freshmen

For freshman football players
across the nation, participation in
the redshirt process can be one
of the most trying times in all of
their college years. Those fresh
man joining the Stanford football
team this season are discovering
that redshirting on the Farm is
no exception.
"It's a difficult time for a fresh
man," Inside Linebacker/Special
Teams Coach Larry Kerr said.
"Most of these guys come from
high school where they're the star
player or star athlete, and they're
used to playing every down. It's
a tough adjustment to . . . sud
denly be the low man on the totem
pole."
All of Stanford's 23 incoming
freshmen football players are red
shirting their first year. The
NCAA's redshirting process per
mits freshmen to spend a year
practicing with the team, learning
the plays and strategies and ad

justing to collegiate football. By
not playing on Saturdays, redshirt
freshmen are allowed four years
of eligibility after the freshman
year .
"Ninety per cent of the players
on the team this season redshirted
(in their freshman year), includ
ing Brian Johnson and Jon Volpe.
The extra time builds a better
player and a more mature indi
vidual," Kerr said.
However, redshirting can be an
extremely frustrating experience.
For inside linebacker Jim
Hinckley, a USA Today All-
America Honorable Mention
ranked the 30th best player in
the Western Region by The
Tacoma Morning News, the tran
sition from high school stardom
to college redshirting was a cul
ture shock.
Hinckley, a graduate of nearby
De La Salle High School in Walnut
Creek, called the experience
"humiliating. I wasn't sure of
myself. I went from being one of

the best players to one of the
worst," he said.
Although Jim's brother, Rob
Hinckley, currently a starting
linebacker for the Cardinal, also
redshirted his freshman year, the
experience for Jim was still eye
opening.
"Now that I'm in a much bigger
place, I'm not the big fish in the
small pond anymore," Hinckley
said. "But being a redshirt is a
good challenge to try and rise up.
"Redshirting allows a player to
get used to college football and
the college atmosphere without
the pressure of the big game on
Saturday," Hinckley said. "By
just practicing, I can work on get
ting good grades. Once I have that
in check, everything else won't be
as bad."
Hinckley believes that only
practicing in his freshman year
improves his football abilities as
well. "In practices, I get a chance
to work on the fundamental skills
I need. Everyone here is a lot

bigger, faster and better than in
high school, and deserves to be
here," he said.
Kerr feels that Hinckley
deserves to be here, too. "He has
good instincts and work ethics,
and if he is as dedicated as his
brother is, he has the ability to
be better than Rob," he said.
Despite the huge challenge,
Hinckley feels that he can use the
redshirt year to refine the skills
he needs to succeed. "Once I learn
the defense," he said, "I think I
have the physical ability to start
and succeed here."
The redshirt year, however,
hasn't dampened Hinckley's
aspirations. "Down the road, I
hope to be a team captain, and
maybe All-Pac-10 or All-America.
I want to be the first linebacker
to win the Heisman Trophy," he
said.
For some players, though, it's
difficult to be optimistic when sit
ting on the bench at game time
during the redshirt year.

"Although [the redshirt year]
gives me a chance to learn the
system and prepare for college
athletics, I'd much rather be play
ing," freshman running back
Herbie Berry said. "Redshirting
is not a completely enjoyable ex
perience."
At Elk Grove High School in
California, Berry played quarter
back, wide receiver, running back,
tight end, defensive back and
safety on the high school varsity
football team. After being an All-
Sacramento First Team member
and Athlete of the Year in the
Sacramento area, adapting to the
anonymity of college football has
been hardly easy.
"When I was recruited," Berry
said, "I was on top of the world.
I got attention from both the high
school and college levels. Now, it
hurts being just a scout team
member, and watching each game
from the sidelines." Berry, who
