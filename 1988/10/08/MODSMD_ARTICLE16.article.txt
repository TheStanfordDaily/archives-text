# Stanford, SJSU struggle in '88
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
Looking ahead to this after
noon's game between the Stan
ford Cardinal and the San Jose
State Spartans is not a pleasant
experience for Cardinal fans. Not
because Stanford should be ex
pected to have any trouble with
the struggling Spartans, but be
cause the Cardinal squad has had
a very rough season thus far. And
any look ahead demands at least
a glance back.
Stanford played the first quar
ter of its season as though it was
going to contend for the national
championship. The Cardinal led
now No. 3 USC 13-0 at the end
of fifteen minutes. Stanford quar
terback Brian Johnson hit Henry
Green with a fourth-quarter
scoring strike to put the Cardinal
ahead 20-17. But Stanford's upset
dreams were dashed when Rodney
Peete, USC's all-everything quar
terback, led the Trojans to the
winning touchdown with less than
two minutes remaining in the
ballgame.
The Cardinal remained at home
the following week, September 17,
to take on San Diego State. A
weak Aztec team provided little
trouble as the Cardinal raced to
a 31-10 victory before 26,000 fans.
Such a superb effort, especially
by the defense, seemed to indicate
that Stanford was ready to head
into Eugene to face a tough
Oregon Ducks squad.
Despite a tremendous effort by
the Stanford gridders, Latin
Berry rambled four yards for the
game's only touchdown with 8:53
remaining. An Oregon intercep
tion three minutes later sealed a
7-3 triumph. The Ducks, now

ranked in the top 20 nationally,
had staved off the best threat the
Cardinal could muster. Stanford's
three second-half turnovers cost
them the game.
Stanford, upon its return from
Eugene, immediately had to look
toward South Bend, and a match
up with No. 5 Notre Dame on the
first Saturday in October. Any
hopes of an upset were dispelled
early as the Fighting Irish rolled
to a 28-7 halftime lead. Behind
332 yards on the ground, and
quarterback Tony Rice's best
throwing game of the young
season (11-14, 129 yards), Notre
Dame finished the game a 42-14
winner. The lone bright spot for
the Cardinal was the play of back
up quarterback Jason Palumbis,
who went 16-of-23 for 158 yards
and a touchdown, the first of his
young career.
At 1-3, Stanford enters this
match-up with the Spartans as a
good team with a bad record. San
Jose State is also a reasonably
good team . . . with a worse
record. The Spartans come into
Stanford Stadium with a 1-4
mark, its lone win coming against
New Mexico State the first week
of the season.
The Aggies didn't give the Spar
tans much of a contest as SJSU
rolled to a 51-0 victory. Senioi
quarterback Ken Lutz passed for
over 300 yards as San Jose
brought back memories of last
year's 10-2 squad in the romp
against an overmatched New
Mexico State team.
The Spartans traveled home on
a high note looking to make easy
work of a much improved Oregon
State lineup. But it was not to be
as quarterback extraordinaire
Erik Wilhelm led the Beavers to

a 41-27 victory in San Jose. Lutz
had another big game, but the
Spartans fell prey to some key
turnovers and an ultra-quick
Oregon State offense.
The Spartans then set off for
a four-game roadswing, beginning
on the beaches of sunny Hawaii.
But the Rainbows rained on the
Spartans proverbial parade in a
36-27 victory. As in the Oregon
State game, SJSU led at halftime
before tailing off in the second
half.
A 1-2 Spartan team that could
easily, and perhaps should, have
been 3-0, then traveled to Husky
"Stadium to take on No. 19 Wash
ington on Sept. 24. Despite
scoring 31 unanswered points to
take a 31-28 lead late in the game,
San Jose could not put the game
away. A late touchdown pass gave
the Huskies a 35-31 win.
Last week, while Nortre Dame
was destroying the Cardinal on
national television, San Jose State
also lost, again. The final score
in the sleeper game of the week
was: California 21, SJSU 14. The
Spartans fell to 1-4, and their
morale to much worse than that.
"This is an important game for
both teams psychologically,"
SJSU Sports Information Direc
tor Lawrence Fan said.

If San Jose State hopes to end its four-game losing streak, the
Spartans "46" defense will have to play a tight man-to-man against
Stanford's receivers and split ends, such as Chris Walsh.
