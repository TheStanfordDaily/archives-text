Greetings, citizens! We ask
you to please return your tray
tables to the full, upright, locked
position and extinguish all
smoking materials as the world
famous Leland Stanford Junior
(pause) University Marching
Band prepares to amaze and as
tound all with feats of incredible
stupidity.
Fresh (well, actually slightly
stale) from a tour of Chicago
and fabulous South Bend, Ind.,
the LSJUMB is ready to fulfill
its dream of being both enter
taining AND educational. The
pregame show, entitled 4 'How to
Escape from Prison," begins
with the traditional axe forma
tion (an axe being a handy es
cape device) and that classic

prison blues melody, "Come
Join the Band."
Famous cat burglar Lenny
"Pinkies" Pukowski escaped
from Sing Sing in 1978 by
mailing himself out, a method
we highly recommend and pay
tribute to with our rendition of
"Squeeze (P. 0.) Box" and our
mailbox formation. Another way
to escape, made popular by John
Dillinger, is to carve an armored
car out of soap, a method
reproduced in our "armored
car" formation to the tune of
"Jailbreak." You can also have
your girlfriend bake a jackham
mer into a cake, as we demon
strate to the song "Master
Blaster."

For halftime, "The Modern
Art Show" begins with an ex
ample of deconstructivist archi
tecture, the current rage in all
the popular cities. (The Band
will then form a house sticking
sideways out of a hill and play
"Suffragette City.")
Next, we salute Andy Warhol.
(The Band forms Andy's hair
and glasses and plays "It's
Over.") Then, a mobile com
posed of triangles (a squirrel)
changes to a mobile composed
of squares (a water buffalo) as
The" Band plays "Crazy Little
Thing."
And finally, who could forget
Dada? The Band closes by form
ing Dada which changes to Pepe,
and playing "Evil Ways."
