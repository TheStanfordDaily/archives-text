# Stanford hosts South Bay rival SJSU
## 
### David Earnest Editorial staff 
Okay, so today's match-up be
tween the San Jose State Spartans
(1-4) and the Stanford Cardinal
(1-3) is not exactly the stuff of
which bowl dreams are made. But
it's not going to be one of the
Kansas-Kansas State games of the
past few seasons, either. If there
is one word to summarize today's
game at Stanford Stadium (and,
for that matter, the respective
seasons of both these teams) it's
deceptive.
As in deceptive numbers. Both
San Jose State and Stanford are
better than their records indicate.
The Cardinal is currently 3-1
against the spread, and all three
of Stanford's losses have come
against top-20 teams, two of them
being by only four points apiece.
After the Cardinal was unable
to convert a first-and-goal from
the Trojan two-yard line when the
team led 20-17 in the fourth quar
ter, Stanford lost its season
opener 24-20 to USC. Two weeks
later, Stanford lost at Oregon 7-3
after leading for three quarters
and shutting down the Ducks'
potent offense.
The Spartans have come up just
short on several occasions as well.
Each of the last two weeks, with
the Spartans leading, San Jose
State's defense has given up long
drives late in the fourth quarter.
Last week against California, San
Jose State conceded an 85-yard,
ten-play-drive after leading 14-13
with six minutes and 27 seconds
remaining in the game.
Against Washington the previ
ous week, San Jose State rallied
from a 28-point deficit to take the
lead, then lost when the Huskies
marched 80 yards late in the game
for the winning touchdown.
Each team has shown the of
fensive prowess to win games and
the defensive ineptitude to lose
them. San Jose State has

averaged an impressive 392 yards
per game while conceding an
average of 351.4 to their oppo
nents. Similarly, the Cardinal has
a 311.5 yards-per-game average
on offense, but has allowed 361.3
yards per game on defense.
However, all of these numbers
are deceptive as well. Stanford's
defense performed admirably in
the two weeks before the Notre
Dame game, holding Oregon's
powerful offense to a touchdown
and keeping USC within reach
throughout the game, before
yielding an average-upping 467
yards to the Fighting Irish last
Saturday.
San Jose State's offense has
more total passing yardage, total
yardage gained, and total points
than its opponents, yet the Spar
tans are 1-4.
Sometimes numbers do lie.
But neither San Jose State
Coach Claude Gilbert, nor Stan
ford Coach Jack Elway are con
cerned with the numbers. The two
simply want to find the consis
tency and the confidence that has
eluded their respective programs
this season.
"Each week it hurts a little bit
more. We're a little bit more frus
trated," Gilbert said of the Spar
tans' four consecutive loses.
"We've been so close. To fight
back and take a lead then lose it
... it's terribly frustrating, be
cause we're unable to put on the
final touch and win a game."
Elway's comments echoed some
of Gilbert's frustrations. "We're
at a point where we have to im
prove in all parts of the game,"
Elway said, "We don't have the
margin of error to make the mis
takes we did [in the Notre Dame
game.]"
Both Stanford and San Jose
State are trying to revamp their
struggling offenses. Quarterback
Jason Schmid started last week
for the Spartans against Califor
nia in place of injured fifth-year

senior Ken Lutz, but gave way to
Lutz in the second quarter. Lutz,
who is listed as 'available' for
today's game, is one of the na
tion's leaders in total offense,
having gained 1,180 yards on 94-
of-145 passing (a .648 completion
percentage) with six touchdowns.
Gilbert is also trying to take
the pressure off of the Spartans'
starting tailback, Johnny
Johnson. The junior, who spear
heads the Spartans' multiple of
fensive formations, is the team's
leader in rushing with 464 yards

and seven touchdowns on 76 at
tempts (a 6.1 yard per rush
average) as well as being the Spar
tans' kickoff and punt returner.
His average of 195.2 all-purpose
yards per game is better than that
of any Stanford player.
Johnson's versatility presents
problems not only for opposing
defenses, but for his coaches as
well. "He's the guy who's going
to make it happen for us," Gilbert
said. "[But] we worked him and
used him too much early in the
season." Not only did Johnson

tire early on, but opposing
defenses began to focus on him
and were able to shut down San
Jose State's increasingly one
dimensional attack.
If Stanford is to be successful
against the Spartans, the defense
must contain Johnson and Lutz.
Johnson, who Elway predicts will
be "one of the premier running
backs in the country," has the
potential to exploit a Stanford de
fense that gave up 332 rushing


Ken Beer - Daily file
Stanford junior fullback Jon Volpe, whose 97.8 yards-per-game places him 20th in the nation in
rushing average, leads the Cardinal offense against San Jose State today.
