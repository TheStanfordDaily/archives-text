# Tailback Johnson powers Spartan offense
## 
### Robert Pardington Editorial staff 
The term "franchise player" is
usually applied to basketball
players. It is reserved for seven
foot centers, the likes of Wilt
Chamberlain, Bill Russell and
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Seventeen more players and a
dozen more coaches make football
a more controlled game than bas
ketball, and make franchise
players very rare.
Statistically, at least, San Jose
State tailback Johnny Johnson

fits the description of this uncom
mon breed.
After five weeks of the season,
Johnson has compiled 976 all
purpose yards (rushing, receiving,
and returning kick-offs). The
whole Spartan team, to date, has
gained 1,960.
That's nearly 50 percent for
Johnson alone.
At 6-foot-3 and 211 pounds,
Johnson has both the speed and
the strength to find open ground.
A hefty 6.1 yards per carry
average attests to his running
prowess.

Perhaps Johnson's greatest as
set, however, is his ability to catch
the ball. As a receiver, Johnson
has already equaled his 1987 to
tals of 31 catches and two touch
downs.
Johnson has seven rushing
touchdowns to go with the two
through the air, and has gained
112 yards on kickoff returns, his
third occupation.
Recognition has begun to flood
in. After the Spartan's loss to Cal
ifornia September 24, Johnson
was named The Sporting News
Offensive Player of the Week for

his 269 total yards.
Last week, versus Washington,
Johnson plugged out 287 yards
running and receiving. Some
whole teams would be happy to
average 287 yards.
San Jose State coach Claude
Gilbert calls Johnson a "tremen
dous force." "We try to utilize all
of his skills," Gilbert said.
Stanford coach Jack Elway can
do nothing but rave about
Johnson, and bite his nails think
ing of how to stop him. "Johnny
Johnson is one of the premier
running backs in the country,"
Elway said, "and his key asset is
that he is also so versatile."
To hear Johnson talk, however,
you would think that he were a
second-string place kicker. "My
performance has been good in that
I've been consistent," Johnson
said. "The offensive line has been
great."
Opposing defenses, to be sure,
haven't underestimated
Johnson's worth. In fact, concern
has been raised that, because the
Spartans rely on Johnson so
much, defenses have been able to
key on him almost exclusively.
Asked about this problem,
Johnson again downplays his im
portance. "There's only a certain
amount you can key on one
player," Johnson said. "We have
so many gifted athletes."
Johnson may have learned
modesty from his early years at
San Jose. He had to sit out his
freshman year because of aca
demic ineligibility.
Last year, Johnson worked his
way into the starting line-up, but
as a wide receiver. He learned the
position in just three weeks and
was improving steadily until he
went out with a sprained ankle
in week six.
But Johnson couldn't wait to
get back to his natural position
running back. "I had no hesita
tion (in switching back to the run-

ning back spot)," Johnson said.
"That's where I'm comfortable."
Regardless of where he plays,
Johnson's favorite plays remain
"the ones that get me in the end
zone."
In the Spartan's first game this
season, against New Mexico State,
Johnson produced four touch
downs. That mark equaled the
San Jose State single game record,
held by Johnny Johnson Sr., who
maintains his fifth-place ranking
among all-time San Jose rushing
leaders.
Professional football scouts are
already anticipating Johnson's
jump to the NFL. Some analysts
are projecting Johnson as a first
round selection.
For now, 'Jazzy J,' as his nick
name goes, will be content to
rampage through Big West and
Pacific 10 Conference secondaries.
This year, Johnson is intent on
staying healthy, getting the 1-4
Spartans a few wins, and working
on his bachelor's degree, in
Liberal Studies.
It sort of makes, sense that
Johnson would be versatile off the
field as well as on.

Last week versus
Washington,
Johnson plugged
out 287 yards run
ning and receiving.
sBnH whole teams
would be happy to
average 287 yards.

way into the starting line-up, but
as a wide receiver. He learned the
position in just three weeks and
was improving steadily until he
went out with a sprained ankle
in week six.
But Johnson couldn't wait to
get back to his natural position
running back. "I had no hesita
tion (in switching back to the run-

ning back spot)," Johnson said.
"That's where I'm comfortable."
Regardless of where he plays,
Johnson's favorite plays remain
"the ones that get me in the end
zone."
In the Spartan's first game this
season, against New Mexico State,
Johnson produced four touch
downs. That mark equaled the
San Jose State single game record,
held by Johnny Johnson Sr., who
maintains his fifth-place ranking
among all-time San Jose rushing
leaders.
Professional football scouts are
already anticipating Johnson's
jump to the NFL. Some analysts
are projecting Johnson as a first
round selection.
For now, 'Jazzy J,' as his nick
name goes, will be content to
rampage through Big West and
Pacific 10 Conference secondaries.
This year, Johnson is intent on
staying healthy, getting the 1-4
Spartans a few wins, and working
on his bachelor's degree, in
Liberal Studies.
It sort of makes, sense that
Johnson would be versatile off the
field as well as on.

Last week versus
Washington,
Johnson plugged
out 287 yards run
ning and receiving.
sBnH whole teams
would be happy to
average 287 yards.

San Jose State's Johnny Johnson, who returns kickoffs in addition to playing tailback, provides the
Spartans' offensive punch with his 195.2 all-purpose yards per game.
The term "franchise player" is
usually applied to basketball
players. It is reserved for seven
foot centers, the likes of Wilt
Chamberlain, Bill Russell and
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Seventeen more players and a
dozen more coaches make football
a more controlled game than bas
ketball, and make franchise
players very rare.
Statistically, at least, San Jose
State tailback Johnny Johnson

fits the description of this uncom
mon breed.
After five weeks of the season,
Johnson has compiled 976 all
purpose yards (rushing, receiving,
and returning kick-offs). The
whole Spartan team, to date, has
gained 1,960.
That's nearly 50 percent for
Johnson alone.
At 6-foot-3 and 211 pounds,
Johnson has both the speed and
the strength to find open ground.
A hefty 6.1 yards per carry
average attests to his running
prowess.

Perhaps Johnson's greatest as
set, however, is his ability to catch
the ball. As a receiver, Johnson
has already equaled his 1987 to
tals of 31 catches and two touch
downs.
Johnson has seven rushing
touchdowns to go with the two
through the air, and has gained
112 yards on kickoff returns, his
third occupation.
Recognition has begun to flood
in. After the Spartan's loss to Cal
ifornia September 24, Johnson
was named The Sporting News
Offensive Player of the Week for

his 269 total yards.
Last week, versus Washington,
Johnson plugged out 287 yards
running and receiving. Some
whole teams would be happy to
average 287 yards.
San Jose State coach Claude
Gilbert calls Johnson a "tremen
dous force." "We try to utilize all
of his skills," Gilbert said.
Stanford coach Jack Elway can
do nothing but rave about
Johnson, and bite his nails think
ing of how to stop him. "Johnny
Johnson is one of the premier
running backs in the country,"
Elway said, "and his key asset is
that he is also so versatile."
To hear Johnson talk, however,
you would think that he were a
second-string place kicker. "My
performance has been good in that
I've been consistent," Johnson
said. "The offensive line has been
great."
Opposing defenses, to be sure,
haven't underestimated
Johnson's worth. In fact, concern
has been raised that, because the
Spartans rely on Johnson so
much, defenses have been able to
key on him almost exclusively.
Asked about this problem,
Johnson again downplays his im
portance. "There's only a certain
amount you can key on one
player," Johnson said. "We have
so many gifted athletes."
Johnson may have learned
modesty from his early years at
San Jose. He had to sit out his
freshman year because of aca
demic ineligibility.
Last year, Johnson worked his
way into the starting line-up, but
as a wide receiver. He learned the
position in just three weeks and
was improving steadily until he
