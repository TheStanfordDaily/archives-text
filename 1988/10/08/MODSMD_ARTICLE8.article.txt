# San Jose State â€“ Stanford matchups
## 
### 
Spartan quarterback Ken Lutz
has passed for 1,180 yards already
this season and has completed
nearly 65 percent of his passes.
Lutz has also thrown seven inter
ceptions, however, and Stanford
strong safety Rob Englehardt has
the potential to halt a scoring
drive by picking off another pass
to add to his two so far this
season. For the Spartans, Lutz
has taken up some of the slack
created by the graduation of last
year's quarterback Mike Perez.
Englehardt, likewise, fills the
shoes of the departed Brad
Humphreys for Stanford.

Johnny Johnson can do it all,
and has it in him to break 100
yards rushing in any given game.
Stanford outside linebacker Rob
Hinckley will be just one of the
Stanford defensive players con
centrating on Johnson, but he is
certainly one of the most able.
Hinckley's three sacks lead the
Cardinal this season, and his two
interceptions tie Englehardt for
tops on the team.

Cardinal running back Jon
Volpe now ranks 20th in the na
tion in rushing with his 97 yards
per-game average. San Jose State
linebacker Lloyd Forrest's job will
be trying to contain Volpe. Forrest
missed all of last season due to
an auto accident, but came back
to regain his starting slot. Forrest
had seven quarterback sacks in
1986.

San Jose State safety Ryan Ras
nick is the Spartans iron man,
having started all 24 games of his
college career. A 1987 second team
all-conference selection, Rasnick
is second on the team this year
in tackles with 33. Stanford quar
terback Jason Palumbis has com
pleted 67 percent of his passes in
limited action this season. A red
shirt freshman, Palumbis will get
his first start of the year today.

If the game comes down to a
field goal, give a slight edge to
San Jose State. Spartan junior
kicker Jim Kirk has been good on
six of seven field goal attempts
this year, including three of four
from beyond forty yards. Kirk set
records for most field goals in a
season and a career at Fresno City
College. Stanford sophomore John
Hopkins has connected on only
four of eight field goals this year,
but one of them was a 51 yarder.
Hopkins is known for his long
kickoffs and has also seen duty
as punter.

Stanford defensive tackle Lester
Archambeau, an All-America can
didate, has never missed a game
for the Cardinal, and may very
well end up being viewed as one
of the greatest defensive players
to have ever played at Stanford.
The only returning starter on San
Jose's offensive line, and an
honorable mention All-PCAA se
lection last year, the Spartans'
Scott Swall is no slouch either.
He will, however, have his hands
full today. .
