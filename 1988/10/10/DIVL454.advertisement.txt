The Tl-74 BASICALC" is
a BASIC calculator that's
also an advanced scientific
calculator. In effect, it's two
calculators in one.
In its RASIC mode, you have
direct, two-keystroke access to 41
BASIC commands, as well as 10
user-definable keys which can make
doing your coursework a basic snap.
Switch to its calculator mode and
you're armed with 70 scientific
functions to help you easily solve
those tough technical problems.
And the large, color-axled keys,
