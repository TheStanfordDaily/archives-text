### 
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
— President Raif Dizdarevic
warned yesterday that a national
state of emergency would be im
posed if protests over financial
hardship and ethnic issues do not
immediately cease.
Earlier yesterday, tens of thou
sands of demonstrators took to
the streets, and students in the
southern republic of Montenegro
began a hunger strike to protest
police violence and demand the
ouster of Communist leaders.
In a rare and hastily scheduled
nationwide address, a somber Diz
darevic promised leadership
changes later this month during
an emergency session of the
federal government and urged
measures to reduce inflation, now
averaging 217 percent annually.
"There is a real danger that the
actions which are imperiling con
stitutional order could continue
and spread," Dizdarevic said dur
ing the 30-minute radio and tele
vision address. "It is the final
hour to turn things around."
Dizdarevic said a "state of emer
gency could be introduced in
Yugoslavia if the trend of negative
events in the country is not im
mediately stopped."

Yugoslavia's collective nine
man state presidency has warned
top Communist party (League of
Communists) bodies in the coun
try's six republics to take meas
ures to control the situation, the
president said.
He also assured the nation's 23
million citizens that a key Com
munist party meeting scheduled
for Oct. 17 will result in changes
in the leadership, but he did not
elaborate.
Residents reported heavy police
presence and roadblocks around
Titograd, capital of Montenegro
republic, 280 miles southwest of
Belgrade. Riot police wielding
clubs broke up an overnight rally
there Saturday against local Com
munist party leaders.
Three people were reported
hospitalized in Niksik, 15 miles
northwest of Titograd, where
police fired tear gas Saturday to
break up a crowd.
The state news agency Tanjug
quoted local authorities as saying
the situation in Niksic was "ex
tremely serious" and said thou
sands of workers at a local steel
mill put down their tools yester
day and marched to protest police
actions.
The presidency of Bosnia, a cen

tral Yugoslavian republic, issued
a statement saying violent protests
are "most seriously jeopardizing
the integrity, constitutional order
and security of the country," Tan
jug said.
At Cetinje, 42 miles north of
Titograd, authorities also in
creased security at workplaces
and in public places, Tanjug re
ported without further detail.
In Titograd, students went on
hunger strike to protest the police
violence and demand that local
Communist leaders resign. In an
unusually outspoken demand for
democracy, the official Commu
nist youth union also called for
"direct and secret" elections to
get leaders the people would sup
port.
About 20,000 people attended a
rally in Serbia's southern auton
omous province of Kosovo, where
the Serbian minority alleges har
assment by the ethnic Albanian
majority.
Police did not report any inci
dents at the rally in Titovo
Mitrovica, 145 miles south of
Belgrade.
At dozens of similar rallies in
recent months, Serbs have railled
against the ethnic Albanian Com
munist leaders in Kosovo.
