Republican George Bush leads Democrat Mi
chael Dukakis in statewide polls in Missouri,
Kansas, New Mexico, Ohio and a survey of South
ern voters, but a large percentage of voters still
remain undecided, according to polls released yes
terday.
In a poll of 2,102 registered voters in 15 South
ern and border states, Bush held a 12-point lead
over Dukakis — 49 percent to 37 percent — with
12 percent of those polled undecided.
The survey, conducted last week by The Atlanta
Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, had a
margin of error of plus or minus two percentage
points.
Bush led in every state, including Florida where
he held a 26-point advantage and Texas where
the GOP nominee enjoys a 14-point lead. Both
are high stakes Electoral College states; Florida
has 21 electoral votes, Texas 29.
According to the poll, Bush leads Dukakis
among independent voters by nearly a 2-to-l mar
gin and has the support of 15 percent of black
and Hispanic voters. The poll showed women
supporting Bush by 46 percent to 37 percent,
and men supporting Bush by 53 percent to 37
percent.

The states in which the poll was conducted
were Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missis
sippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.
The polls in Kansas and Missouri found that
GOP vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle is
a drag on the ticket, with voters in Missouri
giving the Indiana senator the highest unfavor
able rating of anyone on the ballot.
In the Missouri poll, published by The Kansas
City Star, Democratic presidential nominee Du
kakis had narrowed Bush's nine-point lead from
late August to four percentage points. Among the
550 likely voters surveyed by telephone last week,
45 percent favored Bush while 41 percent
preferred Dukakis. Fourteen percent of the voters
were undecided.
The poll, conducted by Market Shares Corp.
for The Star, The Kansas City Times and KCTV,
had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent,
statistically negating Bush's advantage.
Quayle also received a 40 percent unfavorable
rating compared to 37 percent for Dukakis, 35
percent for Bush and 21 percent for Bentsen.
