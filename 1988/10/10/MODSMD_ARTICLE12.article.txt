BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) —
Laos told the United States its
authorities arrested two Ameri
cans who entered the communist
country to publicize a reward to
free American war prisoners, U.S.
officials said yesterday.
It was the first reported ac
knowledgment by Laos that its
forces captured Donna Long of
Jacksonville, N.C., and James
Copp of Hampstead, N.C.
"We understand the Laotian
government has informed our em
bassy in Vientiane that two Amer
icans were arrested by local au
thorities in Champasak province,"
U.S. Embassy spokesman Ross
Petzing said in Bangkok. "We
have no further word regarding

this case."
Long and Copp hired a Thai
fishing boat, crossed the Mekong
River boundary between Thailand
and Laos and were captured Oct.
3 in a Laotian village, according
to Thais who were able to visit
them.
Before setting off, Long told
The Associated Press that they
intended to pass out dollar bills
stamped with an offer of $2.4 mil
lion to any Laotian, Vietnamese
or Cambodian who could produce
a live American being held in In
dochina.
On Friday, four American col
leagues of Long and Copp dropped
about $1,000 worth of reward
stamped bills into the same area

of the Mekong, but they were
thwarted by the Thai navy. Much
of the money eventually ended up
in the hands of Thai children.
The U.S. government still lists
2,393 Americans as missing in ac
tion in the three Indochinese
countries after the Vietnam War
ended in 1975, but no solid
evidence has emerged that any are
still alive.
The reward is being offered by
21 U.S. congressmen and private
American citizens.
The six Americans in the region
seeking information on MIAs are
members of the National Steering
Committee for American War Vet
erans, a private lobbying group.
