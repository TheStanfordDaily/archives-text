ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — Sol
diers fired into crowds of demon
strators yesterday who refused to
disperse, and police and hospital
sources said at least 200 people
had died in rioting over rising
prices and a government austerity
program.
Clashes between the army and
demonstrators grew more violent
late Saturday and early yesterday.
Soldiers were ordered to shoot at
protesters who did not disperse
and fired repeatedly.
The government confirmed
deaths among security forces.
The worst violence was reported
in the southern and eastern sub
urbs of Algiers and in the western
port city of Oran. Fighting also
was reported in a dozen provincial
centers.
In the capital, Algiers, army
helicopters armed with rockets
flew low, apparently to discourage
the formation of crowds.
The city was mostly calm. After
midday prayers at the city's
mosques, some people gathered
and chanted, "Chadli Must Go!"
a reference to President Chadli
Bencijedid. They dispersed quickly
when soldiers charged.
Hospital and police sources in
various parts of the country pro
viding fragmentary information
said more than 200 people had
been killed and several hundred
injured in the past five days. The

government has given no official
death toll.
From the accounts of sources,
as well as descriptions from
citizens who witnessed clashes, it
seemed likely the final death toll
could be much higher than 200.
Abderrahmane Bonato, a 30-
year-old teacher, said he was re
turning home before the 10 p.m.
curfew Saturday when he saw
several soldiers firing on "per
fectly quiet and respectful"
crowds.
"I saw two men who were
wounded being dragged into a pas
sageway by their comrades," he
said. "I don't know what hap
pened to them."
A 26-year-old government offi
cial, Aliouane Fadela, said she saw
gendarmes in riot gear "charging
bystanders who were doing noth

ing, and then kick them once they
were on the ground." The gen
darmes are police under military
control.
Authorities on Thursday im
posed a state of emergency with
overnight curfews and arrested
more than 900 people for looting.
The official APS Algerian news
agency gave a list of reasons for
the mounting unrest — crop fail
ure, the collapse of oil prices, the
global economic crisis and Al
geria's enormous population in
crease — from 9.4 million in 1954
to more than 23 million.
The unrest began about 10 days
ago, when industrial workers
staged strikes for higher wages.
The government said it would not
break with its austerity plan to
raise wages, and youths began
rampaging in Algiers and other
cities.
The austerity plan is aimed at
resolving an economic crisis made
worse by the fall in the price of
oil, the nation's main source of
revenue. The plan, announced in
January, aims to line up food
prices with world markets and cut
surplus workers in the state
owned industries that dominate
the economy.
The unemployment rate is es
timated at above 40 percent in
the capital, and food prices have
risen by as much as 40 percent
since January.
