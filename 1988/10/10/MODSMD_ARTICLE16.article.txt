Iran and Iraq on peace plan
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The foreign minis
ters of Iran and Iraq have agreed in principle to
a U.N. proposal to end their 8-year-old war,
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said
Saturday.
Iraqi officials indicated that the 6-week-old
peace talks remain deadlocked.
Velayati, interviewed by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency as he flew back to Tehran
from New York, said negotiators from both sides
agreed that Iran and Iraq would withdraw their
troops within 15 days to pre-war borders and
exchange war prisoners.
Several hours after IRNA reported Velayati's
comments, Iraq's Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs, Saddoum Hamadi, declared that "Iraq
will not relinquish even one inch of its territory"
to Iran.
The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Hamadi
as telling a meeting of Iraq's ruling Baath Arab
Socialist Party that "Iraq imposed its will of
peace on Iran from a position of strength."
Hamadi made no direct reference to Velayati's
comments. But a senior Iraqi official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, told The Associated
Press the peace talks remain blocked.
He said the obstacle was Iran's refusal to agree
to Iraq's demand that the disputed Shatt Al-Arab
waterway, which forms the southern boundary
between the gulf foes, be cleared for navigation
before further negotiations can be held.
Dangerous tank forces evacuation
NITRC), W.Va. (AP) — More than 3,000 people
left their homes yesterday while a hazardous
waste crew blew up a corroded tank believed to
hold up to 30 pounds of deadly hydrogen cyanide.
The explosion occurred at 1:55 p.m. and a fire
was started to burn off the tank's contents. En
vironmental Protection Agency spokesman Harold
Yates said that at 2:01 p.m. "no air readings
indicated any hydrogen cyanide down wind."
As little as 50 milligrams of the hydrogen
cyanide, or less than one-sixth the weight of the
average aspirin tablet, can kill.
"There was no reason to think it was anything
other than hydrogen cyanide," said Jerry Heston,

the EPA's on-site coordinator. A monitor held
directly over the burning cylinder indicated 1
part per million of the poison, but Heston said
the smoke and burning sandbags may have given
a false reading.
EPA officials had not been certain of the tank's
contents, so analysts will examine a videotape of
the explosion to look for a telltale purplish corona,
which indicates the presence of hydrogen cyanide,
surrounding the main body of the flame, Yates
said.
The 4-foot-long cylinder was abandoned at the
site of the defunct Artel Chemical Co. plant, now
a federal Superfund cleanup site, with 3,400 other
drums and barrels of hazardous materials, many
of them unidentified and most of them rusting.
Yates said the hydrogen cyanide burn-off was
the most disruptive effect so far of a cleanup
that began in June. But he said residents can
count on more evacuations when EPA officials
deal with 9,000 gallons of methyl mercaptan,
which is toxic and highly flammable, and a bunker
full of sodium, which reacts violently on contact
with water.
Rabin: Arab casualties were goal
JERUSALEM (AP) — Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin was quoted as saying Saturday
his policy in handling the Palestinian uprising
in Israeli-occupied lands was to cause casualties
among Arab rioters.
Rabin's statement came as parts of the occupied
West Bank were paralyzed by a strike to protest
the shooting deaths of four Palestinians by Israeli
troops. Arab and hospital reports said two more
Palestinians died Saturday after clashes with sol
diers.
"In confrontation, the rioters should suffer
casualties and scars, so that they know it would
not end with detentions. This is my policy and
I'm responsible for it," Israel radio quoted Rabin
as saying.
Dozens of black mourning flags flew from roof
tops in curfewed Nablus, the West Bank's largest
Arab city, where the four were shot Friday
Clashes flared Saturday in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, and Arab reports said troops shot
and killed one Palestinian and wounded 18 others.
Israel television quoted Arab sources as saying
as many as 30 Palestinians were wounded
