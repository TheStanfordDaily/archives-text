When elected student
representatives take
sides, confusion results

UNIVERSITY LAWYER Mi
chael Vartain warned that
student observers would
create a "circus atmosphere" in the
negotiations between the Univer
sity and the United Stanford
Workers union. So far, his predic
tion is not too far from the truth.
Involving students in the nego
tiations as observers was originally
a good idea. According to the actual
ASSU Senate resolution, the stu
dents would be "neutral observers"
who could inform the student body
of the realities of negotiations.
But then, despite unanimous
passage of the senate resolution,
University negotiators declined to
allow anyone outside the union or
University to sit in on the talks.
The USW made an unusual re
quest: to allow union membership
for the "neutral" students observ
ers although they were not
employed by the University.
Unfortunately, in order to be
able to stay in the talks, Council
of Presidents member Stacey
Leyton and four at-large student
supporters agreed, and since, have
made no attempt to hide their full
support for the USW.
Once students were forced to lose
their neutral status and become
partisan members of the union,
Leyton should have backed down.

Instead, the entire purpose of the
original ASSU resolution was per
verted by the COP's apparent in
tention to support the union from
the start.
True, the COP was elected on a
strongly political platform. How
ever, USW support was not an
issue during their candidacy, and
no one elected them to become un
ion members.
"The Fire Within," a multi
cultural arts program held during
Orientation, demonstrated the
danger the dual roles can create.
In front of a captive freshmen au
dience, uninformed about either
side of the negotiations, the COP
members Leyton and Miguel
Marquez led a one-sided display of
student support for the union.
Although both members revealed
their backgrounds and made no
bones about their positions in the
COP, Leyton's membership in the
union was not disclosed, even
though it was a most pertinent bi
ographical fact.
The "oversight" was a cunning
political move: An "impartial" view
purported by elected student
leaders is much more persuasive
than a biased view presented by
actual union members.
The COP members must refrain
from using their powerful roles to
further their union support, if they
are to remain part of the negoti
ations at all.
The COP was elected to be a
representative body of the stu
dents, not the public relations
branch of the USW. They must
remember that distinction.
