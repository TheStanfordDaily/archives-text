## Blame is not the issue regarding lack of new locks 
### 
NO ONE QUESTIONS that
rekeying residences is necessary
for student safety. That much is
obvious. What is in question is the
extent of the University's commitment
to that ideal. What you say is one
thing, what you do is another.
According to Lucy Williams' and
Diana Conklin's letter of Oct. 5, deci
sions about rekeying were made within
about a week after students left their
residences. Before the end of June,
they knew that 13 Row houses would
need rekeying, and yet no additional
locksmiths were hired to supplement
the two the University already had.

How serious is the University's com
mitment to security when they expect
two locksmiths to rekey 13 Row houses
in three months, while at the same
time maintaining every other lock on
campus? Those were three months in
which extra locksmiths could have and
should have been hired to get the job
done on time.
Williams and Conklin say they "in
sist that rekeying decisions are made
in accordance with sound security
practices," but my house still has not
been rekeyed. And I find it strange
that the office which should bo saying

"We take responsibility for this over
sight" is instead saying, "We do not
blame anyone for this."
What?? Who would they blame,
anyway? It is very convenient to say
that "blame is an unhelpful approach
to solving problems," especially when
you are the one who would be blamed.
But I do not blame; I am not con
cerned with who specifically is at fault.
Rather, I ask that someone take re
sponsibility and stop pretending that
there is no problem. I ask that some
one recognize that I never agreed to
pay false charges for services that were
never performed; I ask that someone

recognize that I cannot be held respon
sible for my dormmates' keys any
more than for their grades.
The University says it cannot take
bids from outside contractors on rekey
ing jobs. Why not? In the absence of
competition, how do I know I am being
given a fair estimate? The burden of
proof is on the University, not on
those of us who already paid our
money.
The $3,000 we paid was a contract,
not a contribution.
