## Claims raised after Kennedy speech outlining Stanford's future 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
A SLAC worker accused SLAC
management of sexism and cen
sorship after a speech by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
last Friday at Frost Amphithea
ter.
Stating that his "job was in
jeapordy" because of his com
plaints against the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center admin
istration, Jack Truher said that
SLAC officials routinely encour
age workers with dissenting
opinions against SI.AC policy to
"keep quiet."
Truher, who spoke during the
question-and-answer period after
Kennedy's speech also said that
SLAC, in its evaluation of employ
ees, uses language that can clearly
be construed "as sexist."
"Their official policy is one of
sexism," he said. "There is a high
level of intimidation (at SLAC) so
that is impossible to oppose (these
policies)."
When Kennedy questioned
Truher as to whether an official

'(SLAC's) official
policy is one of
sexism. There is a
high level of intimida
tion so that is impos
sible to oppose
(these policies)/

complaint had been filed with the
University administration, he
replied that it had, but the com
plaint had been rejected.
I ruher said he had previously
brought the alleged abuses by
SLAC management to Kennedy
two years ago at a public meeting,
but the administration had taken
no subsequent action.
Kennedy said although he had
not personally seen these com
plaints, no specific gripes had been
turned into his office. He sugges
ted that in this case, the admin
istration had not acted because
the accusations were too vague.

Truher's outpouring of accusa
tions came near the end of a
question-and-answer period of a
speech by Kennedy addressing the
future of the University. Kennedy
was the first in the speaker series,
organized by the Human Re
sources Council, called "Friday
noon live!"
During the speech, Kennedy
outlined "five main areas of ac
tion" upon which the University
should work in the future. Ken
nedy said the list had been derived
from extensive consultation with
members of the Board of Trus
tees, faculty leaders and other
staff members.
Kennedy cautioned, however,
that the list was not exclusive,
and that "obviously, there are
other important items that were
not included in the list."
The five areas that Kennedy
emphasized were:
• Restructuring of retirement in
centives
Kennedy encouraged the devel
opment of a phased retirement
program, an incentive system
which would reward "outstanding
performances" by managers.
• Lobbying for government aid for
research and facilities
Kennedy said Stanford is al
ready playing a prominent na
tional role, along with other uni
versities nationwide, in this effort.
• Developing long-range policies
to deal with local government
Kennedy said that due to pres
sure from the local community,
Stanford must now deal with such
issues as toxic waste disposal and
lab animal use. In addition, local

land use laws place restrictions
on the growth of the University.
• Improving instruction at both
the undergraduate and graduate
levels
Kennedy argued for promotion
incentives for good teachers. He
also suggested that programs to
improve the teaching assistants
program were necessary.
• Encouraging minority students
to enter graduate work
As many of the older research
ers retire in the 19905, it will be
imperative for there to be minor
ity graduate students who are
qualified to fill their spaces, Ken
nedy said. He urged the Univer
sity to take immediate action in
this area.
