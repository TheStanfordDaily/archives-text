Theoretically, Prof. John Manley is
right: In an ideal University, an insti
tute set up for a specific mission like
Hoover would have no place, as Milton
Friedman agrees. But look at the
reality:
Despite its ad hoc nature, Hoover,
proportional to the size of its member
ship, outclasses the main campus in
intellectual power. There are few indi
viduals comparable to Milton Fried
man, Edward Teller, Alexander
Solzhenitzyn, Sidney Hook, the late
Eric Voegelin, and so on, at Stanford
proper. Moreover, Hoover has been
successful in its mission and is recog- •
nized around the globe for having
played a mtyor role in the transforma
tion of world attitudes toward open
market economies and increased free
dom generally, as described by Martin
Anderson in his "Revolution."
On the other hand, Stanford is now
known internationally as a place where
the open mind and true education have

taken a shellacking recently. One
wonders how many here realize the
extent of the damage to our reputation
brought about by the blatant politiciza
tion of our humanities sector last year,
when our Western Culture course was
mutilated. Clippings received from

... concretely, the
main campus is more
biased, and
destructively so, than
Hoover.

around the country and abroad reveal
that dozens of our top-drawer jour
nalists expressed something like horror
at what was done here in the name of
liberalism or populism. The recent slip
page of our reputation to sixth place
among leading universities, according
to the U.S. News and World Report

survey, very likely reflects this blunder.
In other words, concretely, the main
campus is more biased, and destruc
tively so, than Hoover. Further, there
are whole rows of ad hoc institutions
established on the main campus with
the explicit purpose of pushing
politically-liberal programs, e.g. Bolivar
House, flamboyantly decorated with
communist murals. As Seymour Lipset
demonstrated in a poll taken some
years ago, the overwhelming mtyority
of humanistic faculty are on the side
of active liberalism, pushing views
which are unacceptable to most Ameri
cans (only 15 percent of whom now
class themselves as "liberal").
In sum, it is the considered opinion
of many of us who have followed this
debate over the years that, despite its
official mission, Hoover is closer to an
ideal of disinterested intellectual in
quiry, of impartiality and healthy bal
ance, than is the main campus. It
would be hard to convince us, for ex
ample, that Professor Manley himself
would be pursuing a "Franklin
Roosevelt Institute of Social Justice"
— his hypothetical liberal counterpart
of Hoover — with the fanatic per-

tinacity and fervor he has been deploy
ing for years against Hoover in the
liberal-slanted local press.
