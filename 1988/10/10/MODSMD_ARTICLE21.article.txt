# Union responds to Vartain's challenge
## 
### 
The Daily of Oct. 6 reported that
members of the United Stanford
Workers unanimously rejected the
Stanford Legal Office's contract propos
als. These proposals include many
"take-aways" of rights which Stanford
workers have had for many years.
According to The Daily, after the
USW meeting, Legal Office attorney
Michael Vartain said: "I could probably
go to the meeting myself and get a
unanimous vote depending on how I
described the University's proposals."
This letter is a formal challenge to
Michael Vartain. If he is willing, mvÂ«
will call a special membership meeting
and give him a chance to try.
