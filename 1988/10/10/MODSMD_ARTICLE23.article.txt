## McCarthy Era revisited 
### 
IN 1947, NOVELIST AYN RAND
identified to the House Un-American
Activities Committee the major flaw
in "Song of Russia": the 1944 film showed
Russians smiling.
"It is one of the stock propaganda tricks
of the Communists, to show these people
smiling," she said.
In retrospect, Rand's charge appears
ridiculous. The committee, however, took
Rand's illogic with characteristic serious
ness. Two days later Robert Taylor, the
film's lead, was subpoenaed for traffick
ing in Russian smiles.
In the absurd years that followed,
countless Americans were called before
the committee and given the "opportu
nity" to prove their loyalty. On the basis
of vague charges of guilt by association
with "questionable organizations" only,
those targeted could be fired or denied
employment.
Worst of all, the U.S. government
seemingly authorized this profound viola
tion of civil rights. Quite possibly,
Truman condoned this in order to further
his own political objectives. By generating
the red scare at home, he could promote
support for the fight against Communists
in Europe, in the form of the Marshall
Plan.
Perhaps George Bush and Dan Quayle
learned some of their campaign tactics
from the McCarthy Era. They have
shown that even today, illogical reasoning
coupled with a disregard for the Consti
tution can further one's own political
objectives. While they talk of fighting
(literally) to defend democracy through
out the world, both stoop to repression

of a different sort at home. The "red
scare" of the '50s has become the "liberal
scare" of the '80s. Questions of patriotism
that were once pulled from smiling faces
are now taken from poorly twisted issues.
Throughout the campaign, Bush and
Quayle have launched vague charges of
disloyalty at Michael Dukakis, based on
his not-so-questionable views and as
sociations.
First there was the non-issue of the
Pledge of Allegiance, from which Bush
created a significant issue in the minds
of more than a few. Surely the presiden
tial candidate knows by now that in 1943
the Supreme Court ruled unconstitu
tional the required recitation of the
Pledge in school. The Court decision
favored a quiet and politically powerless
group, the Jehovah Witnesses, because
the recitation violates their religious
beliefs. While Bush continues to exploit
the flag-waving photo opportunities of
his unconstitutional cause, we hear him
claim time and again in his commercials
that "I am a quiet man. I hear the quiet
people others don't." The relation be
tween his words and fact seems irrelevant
as long as the strong, patriotic images
remain clear.
And when since the McCarthy Era has
the defense of the civil liberties of all
members of American society, no matter
how unpopular, become a point of con
tention? Bush's McCarthyistic attempts
to blacklist Dukakis for his association
with the American Civil Liberties Union
have hurt Dukakis (I wonder if Bush
similarly attacks the new Attorney Gen
eral Dick Thornburg, who sits on the

Board of Directors of the ACLU in Penn
sylvania).
Dukakis is neither a pornographer nor
a Nazi. Rather, he agrees with the ACLU
that the Bill of Rights, which protects
even unpopular groups from sways in the
political current, must be upheld. If Bush
disagrees with the first 10 amendments
of the U.S. Constitution, then Bush
should work to overturn the amendments
rather than the individual who upholds
the law.
Recently, Dan Quayle utilized a similar
tactic, attacking Dukakis for his affilia
tion with a group called "Jobs with
Peace." The erudite Quayle has labeled
this disarmament group radical. Since the
debate, Quayle has continued his McCar
thistic attack on Dukakis, stating "the
governor himself looks down and takes
a very liberal viewpoint toward America,
and this is looking down on America."
Although the circumstances of the Mc-
Carthy Era are different, it is both fas
cinating and shameful that the attacks
have worked and that people have been
swayed by non-issues. Please, cut the
propaganda and give us the issues, the
records, and the qualifications.

Pledge in school. The Court decision
favored a quiet and politically powerless
group, the Jehovah Witnesses, because
the recitation violates their religious
beliefs. While Bush continues to exploit
the flag-waving photo opportunities of
his unconstitutional cause, we hear him
claim time and again in his commercials
that "I am a quiet man. I hear the quiet
people others don't." The relation be
tween his words and fact seems irrelevant
as long as the strong, patriotic images
remain clear.
And when since the McCarthy Era has
the defense of the civil liberties of all
members of American society, no matter
how unpopular, become a point of con
tention? Bush's McCarthyistic attempts
to blacklist Dukakis for his association
with the American Civil Liberties Union
have hurt Dukakis (I wonder if Bush
similarly attacks the new Attorney Gen
eral Dick Thornburg, who sits on the

Board of Directors of the ACLU in Penn
sylvania).
Dukakis is neither a pornographer nor
a Nazi. Rather, he agrees with the ACLU
that the Bill of Rights, which protects
even unpopular groups from sways in the
political current, must be upheld. If Bush
disagrees with the first 10 amendments
of the U.S. Constitution, then Bush
should work to overturn the amendments
rather than the individual who upholds
the law.
Recently, Dan Quayle utilized a similar
tactic, attacking Dukakis for his affilia
tion with a group called "Jobs with
Peace." The erudite Quayle has labeled
this disarmament group radical. Since the
debate, Quayle has continued his McCar
thistic attack on Dukakis, stating "the
governor himself looks down and takes
a very liberal viewpoint toward America,
and this is looking down on America."
Although the circumstances of the Mc-
Carthy Era are different, it is both fas
cinating and shameful that the attacks
have worked and that people have been
swayed by non-issues. Please, cut the
propaganda and give us the issues, the
records, and the qualifications.
