## Stanford destroys outmatched San Jose St. Cardinal capitalizes on early Spartan errors 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It was well worth the wait.
In a sloppy, three-hour, 25-minute game at Stan
ford Stadium Saturday, the Cardinal football team
defeated San Jose State 44-12. The game featured
nine turnovers and 35 penalties, but after two frus
trating weekends, 2-3 Stanford is happy to chalk
up another "W."
"A game cannot be too long when you're winning,"
offensive guard Andy Papathanassiou said. "It can
go on as long as it wants when you're ahead 44-12."

Stanford Coach Jack Elway was also happy to
get the win. "I think we got a jump on things," he
said, "and it worked out alright. ... I'd like to start
every game 14-0."
Elway was talking about the first three minutes
of the game. The Cardinal kicked off to San Jose
State, but on the Spartans' third play quarterback
Ken Lutz was sacked by defensive tackle Lester
Archambeau and fumbled. The ball was recovered
by noseguard Steve Weber and Stanford was in
business on the Spartan 17-yard line.
Stanford worked the ball down to the one, when
a Jason Palumbis quarterback sneak made it 7-0.
On the ensuing kickoff, Tuan Van Le nailed kick
returner Doug Hooker at the 10, causing a fumble
recovered by Stanford's Blaik Nichols. On the first
play from scrimmage the Cardinal ran a draw play

and fullback Scott Eschelman went 11 yards un
touched for the score.
The two scores were only nine seconds apart and
they gave Stanford a 14-0 lead only two minutes,
56 seconds into the game, a lead the defense never
relinquished.
"[Stanford's defense] played hard and ultimately
got the big plays, the turnovers," Elway said. "They

started slowly but they got better as the game went
on and that's what you like to see."
