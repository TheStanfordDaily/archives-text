## Stanford destroys outmatched San Jose St. Cardinal capitalizes on early Spartan errors 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It was well worth the wait.
In a sloppy, three-hour, 25-minute game at Stan
ford Stadium Saturday, the Cardinal football team
defeated San Jose State 44-12. The game featured
nine turnovers and 35 penalties, but after two frus
trating weekends, 2-3 Stanford is happy to chalk
up another "W."
"A game cannot be too long when you're winning,"
offensive guard Andy Papathanassiou said. "It can
go on as long as it wants when you're ahead 44-12."

Stanford Coach Jack Elway was also happy to
get the win. "I think we got a jump on things," he
said, "and it worked out alright. ... I'd like to start
every game 14-0."
Elway was talking about the first three minutes
of the game. The Cardinal kicked off to San Jose
State, but on the Spartans' third play quarterback
Ken Lutz was sacked by defensive tackle Lester
Archambeau and fumbled. The ball was recovered
by noseguard Steve Weber and Stanford was in
business on the Spartan 17-yard line.
Stanford worked the ball down to the one, when
a Jason Palumbis quarterback sneak made it 7-0.
On the ensuing kickoff, Tuan Van Le nailed kick
returner Doug Hooker at the 10, causing a fumble
recovered by Stanford's Blaik Nichols. On the first
play from scrimmage the Cardinal ran a draw play

and fullback Scott Eschelman went 11 yards un
touched for the score.
The two scores were only nine seconds apart and
they gave Stanford a 14-0 lead only two minutes,
56 seconds into the game, a lead the defense never
relinquished.
"[Stanford's defense] played hard and ultimately
got the big plays, the turnovers," Elway said. "They

started slowly but they got better as the game went
on and that's what you like to see."

Stanford noseguard Steve Weber (75) chases after the football after San Jose quarterback Ken Lutz
fumbled on the Spartans' third play of the game. Weber's recovery set up the Cardinal's first score,
a quarterback sneak by Jason Palumbis.
Facing everything from the op
tion to the three-back offense to
the wide-open passing game, the
Cardinal defense allowed the
potent Spartan offense only 331
yards for the day."I think the
effort's always there," inside line
backer Kevin Richardson said. "As
far as execution, we got the ball.
We got a lot of turnovers, got the
big play."
Stanford came up with three
interceptions in the game, includ
ing one by cornerback Alan Grant
that was returned 78 yards for a
touchdown. "I saw [Lutz] release
it; I was coming up to make the
hit, then I saw it was overthrown
so I held my ground." After that,
he streaked down the left sideline
for the third-longest interception
return in Stanford history.
That interception made it 35-12
late in the second quarter, putting
the game out of reach. Richardson
and cornerback Brad Code also
intercepted passes, on the Spar
tans' second and third possessions
of the second half.
The game continued the Cardi
nal secondary's streak of not
having been beaten deep this
season. Grant feels the reason is
that the defensive backs are more
aggressive this year.
"You can't be afraid of being
beat," he said. "You can't be con
servative. ... Make the big play
yourself instead of trying to keep
them from making it against
you."
Stanford did exactly that,
recovering five SJSU fumbles to
go along with the interceptions.
Offensively, Stanford also played
well.
The Cardinal was able to move
the ball almost the whole game
against the Spartans' blitzing 46
defense and recorded some big

plays. "It puts pressure on the
offense," Papathanassiou said,
"[but] it gives the offense the op
portunity for the big play, the
huge play If you hit it right
on it could be a touchdown."
That happened late in the first
quarter, when Palumbis found
Charlie Young for a 49-yard
touchdown pass. "I just rolled out
left," Palumbis said, "they played
a zone defense. . . . With his great
speed and hands I just had to put
it up. Thanks to our line we had
enough time."
Palumbis also completed a 26-
yarder to Young and 25- and 27-
yard passes to Walter Batson.
Stanford's special teams also
performed well, leading kicker
John Hopkins to call the game
"our first outright victory on spe
cial teams." Hopkins is now the
placekicker, the punter and the
kickoff specialist for the Cardinal,
but he handled all three jobs well.
He hit three field gois of 43,
54 and 35 yards and was five-of
five on extra points. He also im
proved the Cardinal punting game
that had been averaging only 32
yards a punt, kicking seven times
for a 38.1-yard average.
"I guess the kicking game went
a lot better," Hopkins said. "I
think we finally put it all to
gether."
Stanford made several addi
tional big plays on special teams,
including Le's fumble-causing hit
and a Kevin Scott 53-yard kickoff
return.
The bad news for the Cardinal
waB on the injury scene:
noseguard Ray Huckestein missed
the game because of a turf toe
and a sore back, and Archambeau
also retwisted the right knee that
has bothered him for the past two
weeks. Archambeau missed the
last 20 minutes of the game but
said his knee was "alright — by
Saturday it should be fine."
Saturday, Stanford takes on Ar
izona State, a 10-0 loser to Wash
ington over the weekend. The

game at Stanford Stadium will
give the Cardinal a chance to get
back to .500 and build the mo
mentum established this week.
"We're doing a good job," Grant
said. I think we're progressing
each week. ... I think we're
rebounding real well [from a 42-
14 loss at Notre Dame last week).
I think the morale and intensity
are excellent at this point."
Card notes
The 35 total penalties called was

one short of the NCAA record while
Stanford's 19 penalties tied the Pacific
10 Conference record. How many
penalties were there? Stanford had
354 yards of total offense, San Jose
State had 331 and there were 279
yards of penalties.
Fullback Jon Volpe, who came into
the game ranked 20th nationally in
rushing, ran for 84 yards Saturday
on only 11 carries, a 7.6-yard average.
Batson and Yuung each caught 81
yards worth of passes.
