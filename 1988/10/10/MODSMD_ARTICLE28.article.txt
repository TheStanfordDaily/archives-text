There is no quarterback controversy at Stanford.
In Saturday's 44-12 win over San Jose State,

This is according to Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
who simply answered "No, no" to a question about
whether there was a quarterback controversy. He
confirmed that with an equally laconic "Yes when
questioned about whether Palumbis would start
next week.
Palumbis has clearly earned the confidence of
Elway, something Brian Johnson once had but
seemed to have lost in South Bend, Ind. last week.
Elway said he felt Palumbis would "continue to
improve" based on what he describes as an excellent

after his first collegiate start. He took credit for
making some mistakes — throwing to the wrong
receiver and the like — and was already looking

the man he replaced, but wasn't looking over his
shoulder.
He said he didn't feel that four or five incomple

It is that fear, say, in the back of the minds of
