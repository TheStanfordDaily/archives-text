# Palumbis steady at QB
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
There is no quarterback controversy at Stanford.
In Saturday's 44-12 win over San Jose State,
redshirt freshman Jason Palumbis started, played
until the game was out of reach and temporarily,
at least, is the starter for the Cardinal.
This is according to Stanford Coach Jack Elway,
who simply answered "No, no" to a question about
whether there was a quarterback controversy. He
confirmed that with an equally laconic "Yes when
questioned about whether Palumbis would start
next week.
Palumbis has clearly earned the confidence of
Elway, something Brian Johnson once had but
seemed to have lost in South Bend, Ind. last week.
Elway said he felt Palumbis would "continue to
improve" based on what he describes as an excellent
attitude and work-ethic.
For his own part, Palumbis was positive, as well,
after his first collegiate start. He took credit for
making some mistakes — throwing to the wrong
receiver and the like — and was already looking
ahead to improvement next week.
Palumbis wasn't worried about any controversy,
either. He had nothing but kind words for Johnson,
the man he replaced, but wasn't looking over his
shoulder.
He said he didn't feel that four or five incomple
tions in a row would result in his removal from
the game. And, from what Elway said, that seems
to be a safe bet.
That's good news for Stanford because it is that
fear of being removed that allows a quarterback
controversy to fester like a disease and bring a team
down in the process.
It is that fear, say, in the back of the minds of
Steve Grogan and Tony Eason,
that may have already destroyed
both of them. It is that fear that
may be tearing apart the once
great Joe Montana.
In the meantime, even though
Palumbis didn't exactly set the
world on fire with his perform
ance — 13 of 35 for 222 yards —

he got the job done.
Thanks to the defense and the
special teams, the Cardinal got an
early lead and all Palumbis had
to do was settle in and play
mistake-free football.
Palumbis didn't throw a single
interception and re-established a
long-passing game that hasn't
been seen on the Farm since John
Paye graduated in 1986. He even
scrambled once for a first down.
The Oregon native also did
some detective work Saturday. He
found one of the squad's missing
persons — Walter Batson.
Batson unofficially had nine
balls thrown his way Saturday.
He caught four of them for 81
yards, watched a couple sail over
his head and dropped a couple.
With the loss of Ed McCaffrey
for what seems to be the whole
9eason, the Cardinal needs a con
sistent threat at wide receiver as
the team heads into the depths
of the Pacific 10 schedule.
That's not to take anything
away from Charlie Young: He's
done a fine job at slotback in Stan
ford's version of the run-and
shoot. The bottom line is, though,
if the downfield game consists
only of Young, the run-and-shoot
would be a loaded gun without
many targets.
With Batson back in the of
fense, other teams will have to
think about him. They'll no longer
be able to put single coverage on
Batson for an entire game. And,
once a defense has to guess who
to double cover, there's usually
someone open.
Open receivers and a strong
armed quarterback are the fuel
that fires the run-and-shoot of
fense It's the kind of offense that
can light up a scoreboard like a
pinball machine. And, with the
defense that Stanford has, may
end up putting a lot of games in
the "W" column.
Winning. In that, there's hardly
any controversy at all.
