### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
The 1,803 people who made their
way to Maples Pavilion Saturday night
were rewarded for their diligence with
perhaps the best women's volleyball
match in Stanford history. Defending
its crown in the third-annual Josten's
Invitational in a rematch of last year's
NCAA Championship match, the No.

Women's Volleyball
Cardinal 3, Broncos 0
Cardinal 3, Rainbow Wahines 2

3 Cardinal upset No. 2 Hawaii in an
explosive two-hour, 36-minute, five
game extravaganza that kept the vocal
contingents from both Hawaii and
Stanford riveted for the duration.
With the 15-10, 14-16, 9-15, 15-8,
15-5 victory, Stanford improves its
record to 14-1. The Rainbow Wahines
fall to 14-2.
"That was one of the best collegiate
volleyball matches we've been involved

in," Hawaii Coach Dave Shoji said.
"There was simply great volleyball on
both sides of the net. It was very
exciting."
"I think that everybody here really
enjoyed it," Stanford Coach Don Shaw
concurred. "That's the way volleyball
is supposed to be played: two good
teams going hard and playing well."
Stanford earned its place in the
enthralling championship match with
a fairly routine 15-6, 15-8, 15-7 tour
nament opener over local rival Santa
Clara. Though unranked, the Broncos
have provided trouble for some strong
teams but were unable to contain the
Cardinal's aggressive offense.
For Hawaii, however, the road to
the final was far more rocky. Pitted
against No. 9 Texas-Arlington, the
Rainbow Wahines were pushed
throughout the four-game match
before posting a 15-13, 15-3, 16-18,
18-16 win.
The contest was a battle of left-side
hitters, pitting Hawaii star and NCAA
Player of the Year Teee Williams
against Arlington ace Ana de Oliveira.
Each finished the match with 23 kills,

but de Oliveira's one additional dig
could not compensate for Williams' six
blocks. Supported by the inspired per
formance by teammate Anna Vorwerk
and skillful setting of Martina Cin
cerova, Williams earned her team the
second spot in the championship
match.
The stage was set for an exciting
rematch of the 1987 NCAA final,
which left Stanford the runner-up to
a tough Hawaii team last December
in Indianapolis. At the tail-end of a
nine-day road trip and burdened with
a long and hard Josten's opener, how
ever, the Rainbow Wahines were un
able to stave off the motivated Stan
ford squad this time around.
"I felt our team performed great
under the circumstances," Shoji said.
"We've been on the road for nine days,
we've played seven matches in nine
nights, and I think we just ran out of
gas. I thought we had to win it in
four; I didn't think we could win it
in five. But we knew about it going
in, so there is no excuse."
After a strong start that netted the
Rainbow Wahines a 5-3 advantage,
Stanford rallied back to take charge
of the first game. Tying the game and
then moving out to a 7-5 lead, the
Cardinal contained Hawaii well enough
to earn a convincing win.
The second game was a real heart
breaker, however. The Stanford
spikers raced out to a 7-2 lead, only
to see Hawaii tie the score at nine.
The Cardinal returned to form and
scored five unanswered points, but the
squad was unable to capitalize on six
match points. After an opportune
Hawaii ace, the teams left for the in
termission tied 1-1.
The Stanford faithful grew more ap
prehensive after game three. Hawaii
once again started strongly and the
Cardinal managed to fight back, but
the Rainbow Wahines still ran away
with the game and seized a 2-1 ad
vantage.
"We got a little tentative near the
end of the third game, and we got way
behind," Shaw said. "After losing the
second game when we had a 14-10

lead, that was tough, a real downer.
It carried over a bit to the third game
— we got off to a slow start and they
were rolling, but we battled back and
we sided-out and we got back into the
game.
"But then we got kind of tentative
and then they jumped on us. We
learned really quickly that you can't
be tentative against a team like that,
that you have to be aggressive."
Shaw's squad learned its lesson well,
coming out in the fourth game fired
up and unwilling to falter. The Car
dinal sprinted out to a 6-1 lead with
strong hitting on the outside. Hawaii
improved its play enough to grasp a
7-6 toe-hold, but a renewed Stanford
offense sparked by junior Jessica Ben
ton's sharp serving put the Rainbow
Wahines behind for good. A clumsy
tip attempt by Hawaii middle blocker
Karrie Trieschman failed to clear the
net, and an exultant Cardinal prepared
for the fifth game.
"We got behind 7-6, and that's when
Jess went in there and really lighted
a spark for us," Shaw said. "She served
real tough, blocked a couple of balls
and our defense adjusted a little bit.
That turned it around. Once we took
charge of the game, that really helped
us, because going into the fourth game
we wore them out a little bit at the
net."
The final game was all Stanford,
with three players in particular picking
the tired Hawaii team apart. Senior
Amy Hayes and freshmen Amy Cooper
and Kristin Klein combined to over
whelm the Rainbow Wahines and give
Stanford the emotional win.
Klein, Stanford's leading hitter this
season, maintained her level of excel
lence and unleashed her hitting fury
and defensive prowess. Cooper also
played well, tallying an incredible four
block solos and ten block assists —
more than half of the team's total
blocks — as well as hitting effectively.
But the real headache for Hawaii
came from an unexpected source,
Hayes. Though the senior typically

plays well against the most chal
lenging opponents, Hayes ex
ploded on the court and gave the
Rainbow Wahines more than they
could handle, recording 21 kills,
six blocks and a match-high 27
digs.
"We just simply couldn't stop
Kristin Klein or Amy Hayes,"
Shoji said. "We had a very difficult
time figuring out where they were
going to hit — we couldn't block
it, we couldn't dig it. We just had
a very difficult time with them."
"We were so psyched," Cooper
said. "With the revenge factor, we
had to get them back. We saw
them play pretty badly [Friday]
night, and we knew they'd play
better against us, but we were
really psyched to play them. We
know we're just as good of a team

as they are, even better now that
we've beaten them."
Card notes
In the consolation match, Arlington
easily bested Santa Clara 15-7, 15-11,
15-6 to finish the tournament in third.
For her performance both nights,
UTA's de Oliveira was named to the
All-Tournament Team.
Joining de Oliveira were Stanford's
Cooper, Klein and Hayes along with
Hawaii setter Cincerova. Williams was
named Most Valuable Player after re
cording the most kills in both matches
she participated in (23 Friday night
and 29 on Saturday).
On the subject of honors, Stanford
graduate and United States Olympic
Team captain Kim Oden was given
the Golden Spike Award for the high
est hitting percentage in the Seoul
Olympics. Considering that the U.S.
finished seventh out of eight teams,
outhitting the rest of the field is a
remarkable accomplishment, indeed.
