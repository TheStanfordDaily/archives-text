## Pisano's plan calls for groups to 'be good or be gone' 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Taking a hard-line stance, Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs and
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano outlined wide-ranging
changes in Stanford's Greek sys
tem in his preliminary response
to the January 1988 Task Force
Report on Fraternities and Soror
ities.
Exemplified most recently by
last week's Phi Delta Theta in
definite social suspension, Pisano
said in a phone conversation yes
terday that he has taken a "be
good or be gone" tone with fra
ternities.
He said the final version of his
letter will contain his definitive
stand on the future of Rush,
house quotas and the creation of
an advisory board for each frater
nal organization.
Pisano said he was prompted
to take a stance on fraternal or
ganizations because he "had to

write what he thought was best
for the University as a whole" and
because "some fraternities are

bad ones."
Pisano was
quick to point
out, however,
that he will con
sider changing
his preliminary
recommendations

cussions or re

suggestions trom the involved
parties.
Since August, the 18-page draft
has been distributed to the offi
cers of the Interfraternity Coun
cil, the Black Greek Letter Coun
cil, the Intersorority Council and
fraternity and sorority alumni, ac
cording to Pisano.
Other fraternity and sorority
members have not yet seen
Pisano's preliminary response.
L'nlike the task force report
issued in January, Pisano's report

calls for a quicker response from
fraternities and sororities, asking
them to meet standards estab
lished this fall in just one year.
While January's task force
report — issued by Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons — called
for a three-year transition period,
Pisano said a one-year time frame
is "do-able."
One of the most ambitious of
Pisano's recommendations, the
statement calls for groups to have
"one year to come into compliance
with the standards that are artic
ulated during fall quarter 1988."
Pisano explained that there is
a need for expediency because his
office and fraternities have "been
grappling with issues for a long
time."
Pisano reiterated that he does
not want to eliminate any frater
nities or sororities from Stanford,
but said that in the interest of
improving the fraternal groups on
