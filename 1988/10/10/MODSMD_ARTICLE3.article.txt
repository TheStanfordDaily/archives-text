# Frat crackdown in works
## Pisano's plan calls for groups to 'be good or be gone' 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Taking a hard-line stance, Asst.
Dean of Student Affairs and
Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe
Pisano outlined wide-ranging
changes in Stanford's Greek sys
tem in his preliminary response
to the January 1988 Task Force
Report on Fraternities and Soror
ities.
Exemplified most recently by
last week's Phi Delta Theta in
definite social suspension, Pisano
said in a phone conversation yes
terday that he has taken a "be
good or be gone" tone with fra
ternities.
He said the final version of his
letter will contain his definitive
stand on the future of Rush,
house quotas and the creation of
an advisory board for each frater
nal organization.
Pisano said he was prompted
to take a stance on fraternal or
ganizations because he "had to

write what he thought was best
for the University as a whole" and
because "some fraternities are

bad ones."
Pisano was
quick to point
out, however,
that he will con
sider changing
his preliminary
recommendations

cussions or re

suggestions trom the involved
parties.
Since August, the 18-page draft
has been distributed to the offi
cers of the Interfraternity Coun
cil, the Black Greek Letter Coun
cil, the Intersorority Council and
fraternity and sorority alumni, ac
cording to Pisano.
Other fraternity and sorority
members have not yet seen
Pisano's preliminary response.
L'nlike the task force report
issued in January, Pisano's report

calls for a quicker response from
fraternities and sororities, asking
them to meet standards estab
lished this fall in just one year.
While January's task force
report — issued by Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons — called
for a three-year transition period,
Pisano said a one-year time frame
is "do-able."
One of the most ambitious of
Pisano's recommendations, the
statement calls for groups to have
"one year to come into compliance
with the standards that are artic
ulated during fall quarter 1988."
Pisano explained that there is
a need for expediency because his
office and fraternities have "been
grappling with issues for a long
time."
Pisano reiterated that he does
not want to eliminate any frater
nities or sororities from Stanford,
but said that in the interest of
improving the fraternal groups on

campus he prefers to "have less
groups numerically and better
ones."
Four years ago, the fraternity
problems were much more severe,
according to Pisano.
During parts of those years he
said he was "really concerned"
that the Alpha Delta Phis or the
Theta Delta Chis "might lose
housing or recognition or both."
He mentioned these two fraterni
ties as examples of houses which
have improved greatly during his
time as fraternal affairs adviser.
In his letter, Pisano also
stressed that fraternities must
not detract or compete with the
University's educational goals.
He added that Rush is one ex
ample of a fraternity activity that

can detract from Stanford's aca
demic goals. "Rush needs to be
worked on and looked at," Pisano
said.
His major recommendations for
restructuring Rush are to con
sider conducting dry Rush and
shortening it to two weeks. Last
year's Rush was three weeks.
If chapters considered ongoing
programs that reach out to the
community and showed "what
they do," the harried atmosphere
that surrounds Rush activities
could be somewhat alleviated,
Pisano said.
He noted that another issue
meriting attention is the housed
fraternity's quota system, which
calls for each house to be filled
mainly with that fraternity's
members.
In his letter he wrote, "I rec
ommend that quotas either be en
forced, or if the quota system is

no longer necessary, that they be
abandoned."
Pisano said he believes that in
the past the quota rule was not
enforced strictly. "We need to have
a system a.ni follow it,"he said,
adding that he will not "pounce
on [fraternities] and dismiss
them" if they miss quota the first
year.
"You should either be a frater
nity or not," he said. "If one-third
of a house does not have a part
in the program, I think that you
have a problem."
In addition to recommending
stricter atttention be paid to Rush
and quotas, Pisano's letter said
"each fraternal organization
(should) be required to have, as
a condition of continued recogni
tion, an advisory board comprised
of alumni, chapter members, and
ideally faculty or staff members."
An advisory body would be able

to help fraternal leadership and
membership realize long- and
short-term goals, according to
Pisano.
While some fraternities may
view such a body as a bureaucratic
hassle or a constraint, Pisano said
he was "anxious to see what chap
ters think the board could do."
Pisano went on to mention that
he was pleased with last year's
Rushbook descriptions on each
chapter's statement of purpose,
and suggested that "fraternal or
ganizations be required to publish
a clear statement about the nature
of their group ... in the annual
Rushbook."
Pisano said he wants to have
the final draft of his letter com
pleted before the end of the quar
ter. His letter will eventually go
on to Lyons as a recommendation
of how Lyons might respond to
last year's task force report.
