OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -
The Oakland Athletics,
showing off the pitching and
power that made them base
ball's winningest team, com
pleted a four-game sweep in
the American League playoffs
by beating the Boston Red Sox
4-1 yesterday.
Jose Canseco, the major
league leader in home runs,
tied an AL playoff record with
his third home run of the series
and Dennis Eckersley, the
leader in saves, set a
league playoff mark with his
fourth save as he finished a

four-hitter for Dave Stewart
and Rick Honeycutt.
The Athletics returned to the
World Series for the first time
since 1974. Game 1 will be Sat
urday night in either New York
or Los Angeles.
Oakland posted the first
four-game sweep since 1976,
when Cincinnati's Big Red Ma
chine rolled over the New York
Yankees in the World Series.
The Athletics also got some
long-due revenge against Bos
ton, which swept Oakland out
of the 1975 playoffs and ended

its run of three consecutive cham
pionships.
Canseco, the major league home
run leader with 42, hit a solo shot
in the first inning and tied George
Brett's AL playoff record. Canseco
has hit five home runs in 26
career at-bats against loser Bruce
Hurst, including one in Game 1.

At New York, Kirk Gibson
homered with two outs in the 12th
inning and Orel Hershiser, who
twice failed to win games as a
starter, got the final out as the
Los Angeles Dodgers beat the
New York Mets 5-4 to even the
National League playoffs at two
games apiece.
Hershiser, called into a bases

loaded, two-out situation as the
seventh Dodgers pitcher of the
day, got Kevin Mc√üeynolds on a
pop fly to center fielder John
Shelby.
Mets starter Dwight Gooden
carried a three-hit, 4-2 lead into
the ninth inning. But Gooden,
who had walked four, thrown two
wild pitches and committed a
balk, got into trouble again when
he walked Shelby leading off the
inning. Then Dodgers catcher
Mike Sciosia homered into the
right-field bullpen to tie it. It was
the Dodgers' first home run in
47 innings, including the last 13
innings of the regular season.
Reliever Roger McDowell got
the first two outs in the 12th
before Gibson homered deep over
the right field fence to break a
l-for-16 playoff batting slump.
Gibson, who has been playing with
a painful hamstring strain, led the
Dodgers with 25 homers but
hadn't homered since Sept. 11.
