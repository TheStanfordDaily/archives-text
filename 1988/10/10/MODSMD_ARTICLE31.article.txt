# Men's soccer loses twice in tourney
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
In one tournament, the Stanford men's soc
cer team went from having a positive outlook
for the second half of the season to looking
for something positive to salvage from the
weekend.
The Cardinal dropped both games in the
Pacific 10 Conference Tournament, falling to
UCLA, 1-0, and then getting buried in a swarm
of goals by Washington, 5-2. Stanford's record
plummeted to 7-7, the first time they have
been as low as .500 this season.

After an awe-inspiring 6-0 start, the hooters
have found one way or another to lose seven
of their last eight games. The frustration and
bewilderment came to a head yesterday, as
Stanford actually converted on two of their
many opportunities only to be done in by
defensive lapses and freaky goals.
"It was not a 5-2-type game," said Stanford

coach Sam Koch. "I thought we controlled a
lot of the play. We need to be a little bit better
on defense then we were today. Our marking
was suspect."
Washington (9-2) came in unheralded and
as an unknown quantity to the other three
teams, and emerged as tournament champs
and with new-found respect. They knocked
off the home team, California, Saturday by a
score of 1-0. Then they wasted no time in
jumping on Stanford Sunday.
At the 10-minute mark, Washington's Jeff
Aumell scored the first of his two goals when
he took a floating cross and headed it over
the outstretched hands of keeper Chris Hel
ling. It was a remarkably similar goal to the
one that Portland scored to beat Stanford the
previous Sunday, 1-0. But this game was not
destined to be that close.
Although Stanford had just as many oppor
tunities to score as Washington, it seemed
that Washington was the better team at con
trolling the ball in the offensive third and got
more direct shots on goal. Their adept oppor
tunism may have been the result of their
familiarity with artifical turf.
"They were better at the touch balls, which
comes from their home play on the turf,"

Stanford defender Jim Killfoil said.
Such was the case with Aumell's second
goal, a bounder that barely got by Mark Semi
oli and Helling to deflect oft" the post and in,
seven and a half minutes after his first. But
the Cardinal answered back, an encouraging
sign for a team that had lost five out of its
last seven games by a 1-0 margin.
The law of averages proved true as Stanford
finally converted an opportunity at the 29:14
point.
It was the team of defender Dave Thorpe
and reserve forward Todd Caven that would
cash in for the first of two scores that after
noon. After Thorpe won a tough ball at the
top of the goalbox, he fed Caven for a textbook
touch-and-go play that Thorpe hammered by
goalkeeper Jeff Koch for the tally.
But Washington would not be caught, cre
ating goals where none should have been. The
Huskies went up 3-1 when Stanford defender
Tim Keyes attempted a throw-in back to Hel
ling and Washington's Chad Crithfield inter
fered enough to cause the ball to elude Helling
and bounce toward the goal. Crithfield tapped
the ball in unassisted, despite being tackled
by Helling.
