# Polo comeback stuns Irvine
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
It was not pretty, and the level of
play was not reminiscent of a champi
onship squad, but the results were as
expected.
The third-ranked Stanford water polo
team defeated both UC-Irvine and
Fresno State as predicted this weekend,

but the first victory was a little tougher
to achieve than the Cardinal had
planned.
After humiliating the Anteaters 16-8
the first time the squads met this
season, it took the Cardinal a key
penalty and six extra minutes of playing
time to sqeak by the sixth-xanked Irvine
poloers 8-7. In fact, the Anteaters came
within two minutes of upsetting the
usually potent Cardinal Saturday morn
ing at deGuerre Pool.

Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
correctly forewarned his charges that
the Anteaters would play tough in Stan
ford's home pool, but he did not reckon
on the usually-accurate Stanford offense
temporarily forgetting the location of
the goals during the first half of play.
"I had a feeling we might not play
well against them," he said. "I don't
think we got a good shot off during the
entire first quarter. Their goalie was
not that great — we just didn't challenge
him."
After one quarter of play Irvine was
dominating the Cardinal in every aspect
of play and had a commanding 4-0 lead.
It was not until the first half had almost
elapsed that Stanford got on the board
at all. Sophomore Rick McNair's tally
with one minute, 55 seconds to play
put the Cardinal on the bottom end of
a 4-1 score heading into the third quar
ter.
"We didn't react very well to the old
style pressing defense and we couldn't
do anything on offense," Dettamanti
said.
With 4:19 left in the contest, McNair's

third goal of the game put Stanford
back in the contest 5-4, but it seemed
as if the Cardinal had squandered its
chances of victory when it surrended
yet another score to the Anteaters only
one minute later. But with two minutes
remaining Dettamanti followed a hunch
and put in freshman Greg Loos. Almost
instantly Loos drew a penalty shot and
Jon Swerdloffs free shot was accurate
to bring the Cardinal within one. Driver
Steve Milham capitalized on the six-on
five situation to even the score with 42
seconds on the clock.
The Anteaters were far from dead,
and with almost a minute to play and
the ball in their possession, were in
change of their destiny. Two Todd Kemp
saves later, the game headed into over
time.
"We switched to a pressing defense
in the fourth and it really threw them
off, " Dettamanti said. "(Greg) Loos
wanted to contribute so bad I figured
he would do something so I subbed him
in."
