A sports enthusiast once la
mented, "A win is a win. A loss
is a loss. But tying a game is
worse than kissing your sister."
Yet, even after Stanford's
nationally-ranked varsity wom
en's field hockey team tied Cal
ifornia's squad 1-1, one could
only admire this group of 22
women who had given it their
all under the worst of circum
stances.

Cardinal 1, Bears 1

Indeed, only a day before
Saturday's contest against
arch-rival Cal, the 3-1 Cardinal
team discovered that co
captain and two-time Ail-
American Alison Smith would
be unable to play due to a back
injury.
"Alison's loss definitely
played a role in our tying the
game today. Dana (Fleming)
did an excellent job filling in
for her at center, but our
timing was a little off," com
mented Stanford coach Sheryl
Johnson, recently back from
Seoul, where she co-captained
the U.S. Olympic women's field
hockey squad.
Johnson said that Smith's
ailment, which most likely will
keep her out for the rest of the
season, was a recurrent back
injury.
Besides the loss of Smith, the
team also had to contend with
Cal's astroturf field. "It was a

good game for both sides, but
Berkeley obviously had played
on that kind of turf more than
we had," Johnson said. (Stan
ford plays on grass at home.)
"Their passes were more accu
rate. We were just a step behind
today."
Junior Katherine Pyrde
summed it up, "Not having
Alison definitely made an im
pact. In the past, she always
was there for us. The astro-turf
was really bouncy. That also
threw our timing off."
Before yesterday's game, the
field hockey team was ranked
10th in the country. Stanford
had beaten Cal 1-0 earlier this
year in a defensive struggle.
In Saturday's game, Stan
ford's only score came in the
first half when senior Fleming
put a penalty stroke into the
back of the net. Cal tied the
game in the second half, and
the game remained knotted
through two overtimes.
"In the overtimes, we had a
lot of good chances but just
couldn't get it in," Johnson ex
pounded.
Taking the field after the
varsity game, Stanford's junior
varsity team rambled to a 2-1
triumph. Sophomore Dana Til
son and freshman Susan Leck
rone accounted for the two
goals as the junior varsity
squad improved their record to
2-0.
Besides Smith, Stanford has
many other stars including ail-
American goalkeeper Karen
Jones and seniors Fleming,
Laura Gartland, Missy Jolley,
Wanda Kay Key and Kat
Thomas.
