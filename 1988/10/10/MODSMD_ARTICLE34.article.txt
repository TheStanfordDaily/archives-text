# Women's soccer downs Puget Sound

### John Kirks Staff writer 
On Saturday, the Puget Sound
women's soccer team made the
trip down the West Coast to take
on the Cardinal at Harry Maloney
Field. Puget Sound, a small col
lege located in the state of Wash
ington, was really a mystery to
the Stanford players and coaching
staff. Despite the school's modest
size and relative anonymity, the
Puget Sound women entered the
match ranked No. 1 in the NAlA's
Top Ten.
The Stanford women admit
tedly had no idea what to expect
from their opponent, but Coach
Berhane Andeberhan apparently
had his troops prepared for just
about anything, as the Cardinal
came away with a 2-1 victory.

Cardinal 2, Puget Sound 1

Before the Cardinal knew what
had happened, Puget Sound had
capitalized on a Stanford defen
sive miscue. Denise Denney, a
sophomore midfielder, opted not
to clear the ball from her defen
sive zone, circling back in front
of her goal. A Puget Sound for
ward stripped her of the ball and
beat a surprised Elise Edwards to
give the visitors a 1-0 lead.
Edwards noted a change in the
Cardinal attitude immediately fol
lowing the Puget Sound scoring
strike. "I think that goal kind of
sparked us. It startled us," she
said. "We really picked up our
level of play after they scored. It
was just a defensive error that
caught us off guard, and we
definitely felt we could make up
for it."
Shortly into the second half,
Denney rose to the occasion to
not only pull Stanford out of its

deficit but also to atone for her
first-half mistake. The Cardinal
had a dead ball about 25 yards
away from the Puget Sound goal.
Tonya Antonucci ran over the
ball, and Denney followed, chip
ping over the defensive wall and
past the Puget Sound goalie to
knot the score at 1-1.

Stanford, after breaking the ice
on Denney's goal, really broke
loose with several excellent offen
sive flurries. In one such flurry,
Jennifer Rowland crossed the ball
right in front of the Puget Sound
goal. The goalkeeper ventured out
to pick the ball from midair, but
she could not hold onto it. The

ball trickled away from her, and
Kerri Stivaletti was there to cash
in on the Puget Sound foul-up.
Stivaletti's goal provided the win
ning margin, 2-1, for the 7-3-1
Cardinal. Except for a few dan
gerous crosses of their own, Puget
Sound could not muster any fur
ther serious scoring threats.
