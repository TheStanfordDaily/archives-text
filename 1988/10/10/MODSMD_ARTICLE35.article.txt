# Golf finishes 13th

Unable to overcome a poor
showing on the first day of the
Stanford Invitational Golf
Tournament, the men's varsity
golf team placed a somewhat
disappointing 13th out of 23
teams this past weekend on the
Stanford course.

Men's Golf
Cardinal 13th in Stanford Invite

Having taken 2nd out of 24
teams in the Reno tourney of
last week, the Cardinal was
hoping for a high finish on the
home course, to give them some
more momentum and to add to
the "resume" that the selection
committee will study so closely
come time for the NCAA tour
nament.
However, as Coach Wally
Goodwin said of the team, "We
started out really poorly," and
the first round team total of
308 reflects his assessment.
It was difficult to say
whether the home course was
an advantage for the team or
not. Junior Mark Funseth,
whose three-round total of 226

was the second lowest for the
team, noted that the team's
familiarity with the home
course was negated somewhat
by the placements of the tees
on some of the holes. "We had
no idea where to hit," Funseth
said. "That shouldn't happen
on a home course. We should
play the course as we know it."
Playing on the Stanford links
also may have hurt the team
in the sense that expectations
were raised to levels that were
disproportionate to the actual
importance of the tournament.
Coach Goodwin said prior to
the weekend he was primarily
going to use the Stanford In
vitational to get a feel for his
team's abilities,
"The team play was good be
cause we got better every day,"
Goodwin said, noting the
team's daily totals of 308, 301,
and 293. Goodwin was also
pleased with the individual play
of many of his golfers, partic
ularly Christian Cevaer, Josh
Zander, and Chris Barbour.
Of the freshman Cevaer,
Goodwin said, "he has all the
makings of a person who can
make it on the pro tour some
day â€” if he works hard
enough."
