# Kennedy reviews key issues
## President discusses USW actions, Centennial, education post 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy aired his
views Friday on the USW and
several of the issues and chal
lenges Stanford faces this year
during an hour-long interview
with The Daily. This is the first
part of a two-day series.

USW-Stanford negotiations
Current negotiations between
Stanford and the United Stanford
Workers are no different from
those of past years, according to
Kennedy.
The USW and Stanford started
new contract negotiations well
before the latest contract expired
Aug. 31. The USW, which could
call a strike at any time, repre
sents 1,300 technical, mainte
nance and service workers on
campus, at the Stanford Medical
Center and at Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.
The USW is holding out for a
better pension plan, more atten
tion to working conditions, a more
efficient grievance process, em
ployee benefits and greater job se
curity.
For months the talks have gone
slowly and last Wednesday the
USW demonstrated on campus to
rally support for their cause. Re
cently Stanford students, some of
who are Council of Presidents
members, have joined the USW
and its negotiating team.
Despite the growing concern
surrounding the talks, Kennedy
said, "Some students forget, be
cause they are here for a short
time, that we go through this

every three years. The course that
things have taken this year is not
atypical.
Negotiating has traditionally
been slow and complicated. Ken
nedy said he didn't know why the
talks went forth so hedgingly
every three years. "We start each
negotiating round with the hopes
that we can be more businesslike
and less acromonious."
"We think, that in the end, we
have (in the past) agreed upon
fair contracts," he said. "They, in
the past, have been ratified over
whelmingly by the rank and file
of the union. And they have
resulted in salaries and benefits
and working conditions that we
think are attractive compared to
those offered by similar employers
in the area.
"I want to emphasize that we
(the University) are serious about
negotiating."
Kennedy said that attention is
being detracted from the bargain
ing table itself. "This time . . .
there have been some instances
of personal harrassment, demon
strations that I think are unfor
tunate because I think they add
to the atmosphere of hostility in
this place."
But, he added, no matter what
takes place around negotiations,
the talks "are not changed by the
rhetoric outside. . . .(The Wednes
day USW protest) did not disturb
me at all. The protesters made
their point. I don't think they
bothered anybody."
Kennedy said of the COP in
volvement in the talks that this
is the "first time an elected pres
ident of the student body has also
been a designated union bargain
ing representative. And they (the

USW) and we are still getting used
to that."
Kennedy was quick to point out
that the students' involvement did
not hinder the course of negotia
tions.
Centennial Campaign
Stanford's large-scale fund
raising campaign recently reached
the $600 million mark in dona
tions. Begun in February 1987,


'There is no way I
would leave (to be
come Secretary of
Education).. .I'm just
not available.'
