# Kennedy reviews key issues
## President discusses USW actions, Centennial, education post 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
Editor's note: University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy aired his
views Friday on the USW and
several of the issues and chal
lenges Stanford faces this year
during an hour-long interview
with The Daily. This is the first
part of a two-day series.

USW-Stanford negotiations
Current negotiations between
Stanford and the United Stanford
Workers are no different from
those of past years, according to
Kennedy.
The USW and Stanford started
new contract negotiations well
before the latest contract expired
Aug. 31. The USW, which could
call a strike at any time, repre
sents 1,300 technical, mainte
nance and service workers on
campus, at the Stanford Medical
Center and at Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.
The USW is holding out for a
better pension plan, more atten
tion to working conditions, a more
efficient grievance process, em
ployee benefits and greater job se
curity.
For months the talks have gone
slowly and last Wednesday the
USW demonstrated on campus to
rally support for their cause. Re
cently Stanford students, some of
who are Council of Presidents
members, have joined the USW
and its negotiating team.
Despite the growing concern
surrounding the talks, Kennedy
said, "Some students forget, be
cause they are here for a short
time, that we go through this

every three years. The course that
things have taken this year is not
atypical.
Negotiating has traditionally
been slow and complicated. Ken
nedy said he didn't know why the
talks went forth so hedgingly
every three years. "We start each
negotiating round with the hopes
that we can be more businesslike
and less acromonious."
"We think, that in the end, we
have (in the past) agreed upon
fair contracts," he said. "They, in
the past, have been ratified over
whelmingly by the rank and file
of the union. And they have
resulted in salaries and benefits
and working conditions that we
think are attractive compared to
those offered by similar employers
in the area.
"I want to emphasize that we
(the University) are serious about
negotiating."
Kennedy said that attention is
being detracted from the bargain
ing table itself. "This time . . .
there have been some instances
of personal harrassment, demon
strations that I think are unfor
tunate because I think they add
to the atmosphere of hostility in
this place."
But, he added, no matter what
takes place around negotiations,
the talks "are not changed by the
rhetoric outside. . . .(The Wednes
day USW protest) did not disturb
me at all. The protesters made
their point. I don't think they
bothered anybody."
Kennedy said of the COP in
volvement in the talks that this
is the "first time an elected pres
ident of the student body has also
been a designated union bargain
ing representative. And they (the

USW) and we are still getting used
to that."
Kennedy was quick to point out
that the students' involvement did
not hinder the course of negotia
tions.
Centennial Campaign
Stanford's large-scale fund
raising campaign recently reached
the $600 million mark in dona
tions. Begun in February 1987,


'There is no way I
would leave (to be
come Secretary of
Education).. .I'm just
not available.'
— Donald Kennedy
the current total has been called
"slightly greater than expected"
by some campaign organizers.
Kennedy said the latest figures
show that Stanford is on its
timeline.
However, he said in some
respects, the totals "are not so
good. There are some specific ob
jectives that are not moving as
quickly as I'd like.. . . (For exam
ple), the pace of 'Major Gifts' and
'Keystone Gifts', the upper
middle range of giving, has not
been as rapid as we'd like.
"There's no question that stock
market instability has hurt our

chances," he added.
Kennedy then lauded the par
ticipants of the campaign saying,
"our faculty are marvelous adv
ocates; our students are mar
velous advocates. The level of par
ticipation that we have had from
everybody has been terrific."
According to Kennedy, all the
elements for success are in place
"barring a mgyor economic turn
around at the national level."
"For me personally, the (Cen
tennial) campaign is in a crucial
year." And in order to raise funds,
Kennedy said he will be away from
the University more than he
would like.

Job of Secretary of Education
There is continuing speculation
that Kennedy might be offered
the position of Secretary of Edu
cation should presidential candi
date Michael Dukakis win in No
vember.
Kennedy said, "I don't think it
is at all likely" — that he would
be offered the position of Secre
tary of Education — "and there
is no way I would leave. No way."
Kennedy said that because he
is set on making the Centennial
Campaign a success, "I'm just not
available."

Western Culture debate in
retrospect
The "Great Debate" of 1987-88
that surrounded the Area One re
quirement was discussed not only
at Stanford but also in the edito
rial pages of newspapers and
magazines across the country. In
April the Faculty Senate finally
approved legislation for a new
Cultures, Ideas and Values course
to begin next fall.
Kennedy said "at the campus
level it was a responsible, thought
ful, very educational debate. Just
the kind of thing that ought to
go on at a great university."
"At the national level I think
it was misunderstood — largely
through the efforts of Secretary
(William) Bennett to make it
misunderstood.
He added that several writings
about the debate were made to
sound like some "really terrible
tragedy like the designated-hitter
rule.
"But there's a persistant echo,
kept alive largely by columnists
on the far right, that Stanford
has knuckled under and has
thrown the canon of western cul
ture on the scrap heap."
Stanford's new challenges
During his Orientation address
at the beginning of the academic
year, Kennedy underlined to the
incoming class that "Bigotry is
out!" and that similarites are
more important than differences.
"A major challenge (for the
year)," Kennedy said, "is the em
phasis that we quite deliberately
placed on the multi-cultural
aspect of this university and
bringing that instructively and
productively into all of the corners
of life — student life in the resi
dences, academic life in the Quad,
the way faculty interact."


Michael Topolovac — Dally
University President Donald Kennedy says he will not leave Stanford if offered a government position
after this fall's election.


Michael Topolovac — Daily
Kennedy explains that the present controversies over the USW
contract negotiations are not historically atypical, and says the
union's Oct. 5 demonstration during a luncheon at the Business
School did not disturb anybody.

Education).. .I'm just
not available.'
— Donald Kennedy
the current total has been called
"slightly greater than expected"
by some campaign organizers.
Kennedy said the latest figures
show that Stanford is on its
timeline.
However, he said in some
respects, the totals "are not so
good. There are some specific ob
jectives that are not moving as
quickly as I'd like.. . . (For exam
ple), the pace of 'Major Gifts' and
'Keystone Gifts', the upper
middle range of giving, has not
been as rapid as we'd like.
"There's no question that stock
market instability has hurt our

chances," he added.
Kennedy then lauded the par
ticipants of the campaign saying,
"our faculty are marvelous adv
ocates; our students are mar
velous advocates. The level of par
ticipation that we have had from
everybody has been terrific."
According to Kennedy, all the
elements for success are in place
"barring a mgyor economic turn
around at the national level."
"For me personally, the (Cen
tennial) campaign is in a crucial
year." And in order to raise funds,
Kennedy said he will be away from
the University more than he
would like.

Job of Secretary of Education
There is continuing speculation
that Kennedy might be offered
the position of Secretary of Edu
cation should presidential candi
date Michael Dukakis win in No
vember.
Kennedy said, "I don't think it
is at all likely" — that he would
be offered the position of Secre
tary of Education — "and there
is no way I would leave. No way."
Kennedy said that because he
is set on making the Centennial
Campaign a success, "I'm just not
available."

Western Culture debate in
retrospect
The "Great Debate" of 1987-88
that surrounded the Area One re
quirement was discussed not only
at Stanford but also in the edito
rial pages of newspapers and
magazines across the country. In
April the Faculty Senate finally
approved legislation for a new
Cultures, Ideas and Values course
to begin next fall.
Kennedy said "at the campus
level it was a responsible, thought
ful, very educational debate. Just
the kind of thing that ought to
go on at a great university."
"At the national level I think
it was misunderstood — largely
through the efforts of Secretary
(William) Bennett to make it
misunderstood.
He added that several writings
about the debate were made to
sound like some "really terrible
tragedy like the designated-hitter
rule.
"But there's a persistant echo,
kept alive largely by columnists
on the far right, that Stanford
has knuckled under and has
thrown the canon of western cul
ture on the scrap heap."
Stanford's new challenges
During his Orientation address
at the beginning of the academic
year, Kennedy underlined to the
incoming class that "Bigotry is
out!" and that similarites are
more important than differences.
"A major challenge (for the
year)," Kennedy said, "is the em
phasis that we quite deliberately
placed on the multi-cultural
aspect of this university and
bringing that instructively and
productively into all of the corners
of life — student life in the resi
dences, academic life in the Quad,
the way faculty interact."

after this fall's election.


Michael Topolovac — Daily
Kennedy explains that the present controversies over the USW
contract negotiations are not historically atypical, and says the
union's Oct. 5 demonstration during a luncheon at the Business
School did not disturb anybody.
Editor's note: University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy aired his
views Friday on the USW and
several of the issues and chal
lenges Stanford faces this year
during an hour-long interview
with The Daily. This is the first
part of a two-day series.

USW-Stanford negotiations
Current negotiations between
Stanford and the United Stanford
Workers are no different from
those of past years, according to
Kennedy.
The USW and Stanford started
new contract negotiations well
before the latest contract expired
Aug. 31. The USW, which could
call a strike at any time, repre
sents 1,300 technical, mainte
nance and service workers on
campus, at the Stanford Medical
Center and at Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center.
The USW is holding out for a
better pension plan, more atten
tion to working conditions, a more
efficient grievance process, em
ployee benefits and greater job se
curity.
For months the talks have gone
slowly and last Wednesday the
USW demonstrated on campus to
rally support for their cause. Re
cently Stanford students, some of
who are Council of Presidents
members, have joined the USW
and its negotiating team.
Despite the growing concern
surrounding the talks, Kennedy
said, "Some students forget, be
cause they are here for a short
time, that we go through this

every three years. The course that
things have taken this year is not
atypical.
Negotiating has traditionally
been slow and complicated. Ken
nedy said he didn't know why the
talks went forth so hedgingly
every three years. "We start each
negotiating round with the hopes
that we can be more businesslike
and less acromonious."
"We think, that in the end, we
have (in the past) agreed upon
fair contracts," he said. "They, in
the past, have been ratified over
whelmingly by the rank and file
of the union. And they have
resulted in salaries and benefits
and working conditions that we
think are attractive compared to
those offered by similar employers
in the area.
"I want to emphasize that we
(the University) are serious about
negotiating."
Kennedy said that attention is
being detracted from the bargain
ing table itself. "This time . . .
there have been some instances
of personal harrassment, demon
strations that I think are unfor
tunate because I think they add
to the atmosphere of hostility in
this place."
But, he added, no matter what
takes place around negotiations,
the talks "are not changed by the
rhetoric outside. . . .(The Wednes
day USW protest) did not disturb
me at all. The protesters made
their point. I don't think they
bothered anybody."
Kennedy said of the COP in
volvement in the talks that this
is the "first time an elected pres
ident of the student body has also
been a designated union bargain
ing representative. And they (the

USW) and we are still getting used
to that."
Kennedy was quick to point out
that the students' involvement did
not hinder the course of negotia
tions.
Centennial Campaign
Stanford's large-scale fund
raising campaign recently reached
the $600 million mark in dona
tions. Begun in February 1987,


'There is no way I
would leave (to be
come Secretary of
Education).. .I'm just
not available.'

the current total has been called
