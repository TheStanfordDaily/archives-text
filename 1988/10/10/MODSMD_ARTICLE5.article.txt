Responding to criticism from Democratic oppon
ent Anna Eshoo, Republican congressional candidate
Tom Campbell reaffirmed his committment to issues
concerning women, the environment and the na
tional economy this Friday.
Last week in a speech to the Stanford Democrats,
Eshoo charged that Campbell — a Stanford law
professor — is not committed to women's issues or
the environment and blasted his theories about the
economy.
In a meeting arranged by the Stanford Republi
cans, Campbell tried to turn the tables on Eshoo's
criticism, saying that he has focused his efforts on

women s issues, a
strong economy, the
trade deficit and the
environment.
He began his rebut
tal by charging Eshoo

with not posing strong enough punishments for
sexual discrimination.
According to Campbell, the government should
"treat sexual discrimination as other white-collar
crime." ('ailing for monetary compensation for vic
tims of sexual harassments, Campbell also said that
those convicted of intentional discrimination should
go to jail.
Campbell said he has now made three public
requests to Eshoo, asking her to follow his example
and commit to cracking down on discriminators.
According to Campbell, Eshoo has yet to respond
to his request.
Campbell also cited the thesis he wrote for his
doctorate in economics as evidence of his concern
for women's issues."lt was a real commitment I
made early on in my career," he
said.
Decribing his thesis as the first
of its kind, Campbell explained
that the work was a statistical
analysis of sex discrimination in
federal agencies which had quan
titatively proven that sex discrim
ination was present.
"If an agency receives federal
money, they can't discriminate,"
Campbell said. "It's absolutely
wrong."
Further defending his commit
ment to women's issues, Campbell
noted his position as the only male
on the White House Task Force
on Women in 1981 and his sup
port of the Civil Rights Restora
tion Act.
Campbell responded to Eshoo's
attacks on his economic
"theories" by thoroughly laying
out his economic platform.

He said Eshoo does not support
what he sees as two essential fac
tors for solving the federal deficit
crisis: the line-item veto, which
allows the president to veto par
ticular items in the budget, and
a balanced-budget amendment.
Citing the federal deficit as the
biggest problem facing the coun
try and accusing the Reagan ad
ministration of failing on the
budget, Campbell called for
Congress to "cut — cut the
budget; cut spending.
Campbell predicted that al
though unemployment is down at
5.4 percent and the prime interest
rate is at 10 percent, double-digit
inflation is inevitable no matter
who is in the White House,
