## 
### Diane Bisgeier Staff writer 
In a final push in conjuction with Rev. Jesse
Jackson's 47th birthday, nearly 40 Stanford stu
dents hit the streets of East Palo Alto yesterday
to register residents before today's deadline for
the November general election.
Students from the Black Student Union, the
Council of Presidents' Voter Registration Project
and MEChA, a Chicano student group, visited
churches and their surrounding precincts, local
stores and shopping centers in a coalition effort.
As a result of the drive, 172 Democrats and
35 "other" voters were registered, according to
Michael Pon, a member of the Peninsulans for
a Rainbow Coalition (PERC).
Volunteers traveled door-to-door in a drive or
ganized largely by PERC, a local chapter of the
National Rainbow Coalition, Inc., a partisan po
litical group established in 1983 during former
presidential candidate Jesse Jackson's first cam
paign
PERC works with Stanford groups on local
issues such as police brutality and education and
on international issues including apartheid The
PERC voter registration drive focused more on
registering Democrats.
Becks, who earlier described PERC as "not
endorsing anyone," delivered a lighthearted
though definite message to the volunteers: "Reg
ister Democrats as much as we can. Register
Democrats and only Democrats."
The Stanford groups however were non
partisan in their efforts. "We register any voters

that want to vote," COP member
David Brown said.
The Public Service Center's Vol
unteer Network also donated time
and will help fund the multi
organizational drive, according to
David Brown.
PERC Chair Elena Becks said
the goal of yesterday's drive was
to "get out into the community
and register people and talk about
issues."
Junior Cheryl Taylor, vice chair
of external affairs for the BSU,
noted that BSU members helped
with yesterday's registration drive
but also plan to work at Stanford
to increase voter awareness in the
black community. About 20 BSU
members registered voters yester
day, working with 15 ASSU
workers and five MEChA repre
sentatives.
Taylor and other volunteers
said a drive in East Palo Alto,
where a majority of the popula
tion is black, is especially impor
tant because residents there tend
to rent homes and do not realize
that they must re-register every
time they move.
"People just aren't aware that
you must re-register after you
move," Taylor said.
Brown said the situation in
East Palo Alto represents an op
portunity for students to see an
actual example of institutional
racism. "You can see it happen
right here: Blacks and Chicanos
don't have resources. Communi
ties like East Palo Alto should
have funding and resources."

Brown added that the long-term
goal of the project is to formulate
permanent solutions to make East
Palo Alto more self-sufficient and
render stop-gap efforts obsolete.
Freshman Noel Maurer, a vol
unteer who previously registered
voters in conjunction with the
campaign for New York Mayor
Ed Koch, emphasized the signifi
cance of the drive for "people who
aren't able to vote or don't know
procedures or don't have easy
access to voting materials."
According to Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Keith Archuleta, di
rector of the Black Community
Service Center and a member of
PERC, the participants in yester
day's drive planned to emphasize
the goals of the Rainbow Agenda
but were clearly working as a non
partisan effort.
PERC member Ron Nakao, an
East Palo Alto resident and a
graduate student in the School of
Education, noted that volunteers
cannot refuse to register residents
based on their political preference.
"But that doesn't mean you
have to turn in the registration
form for them," added Nakao.
President of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans Jennifer Bryson,
who did not attend the drive,
responded by saying the labeling
of yesterday's drive as non
partisan was "a farce."
"If they want to portray it as
a voter drive for the Democratic
party, that is what they should
call it," said Bryson.
Brown responded, "Something
I have noticed, the Republicans
do not go into these communities
to register blacks and Chicanos."

PERC voter registration drive focused more on

Becks, who earlier described PERC as "not
endorsing anyone," delivered a lighthearted
though definite message to the volunteers: "Reg

Democrats and only Democrats."
The Stanford groups however were non
partisan in their efforts. "We register any voters

East Palo Alto to register voters before today's deadline
that want to vote," COP member
David Brown said.
The Public Service Center's Vol
unteer Network also donated time
and will help fund the multi
organizational drive, according to
David Brown.
PERC Chair Elena Becks said
the goal of yesterday's drive was
to "get out into the community
and register people and talk about
issues."
Junior Cheryl Taylor, vice chair
of external affairs for the BSU,
noted that BSU members helped
with yesterday's registration drive
but also plan to work at Stanford
to increase voter awareness in the
black community. About 20 BSU
members registered voters yester
day, working with 15 ASSU
workers and five MEChA repre
sentatives.
Taylor and other volunteers
said a drive in East Palo Alto,
where a majority of the popula
tion is black, is especially impor
tant because residents there tend
to rent homes and do not realize
that they must re-register every
time they move.
"People just aren't aware that
you must re-register after you
move," Taylor said.
Brown said the situation in
East Palo Alto represents an op
portunity for students to see an
actual example of institutional
racism. "You can see it happen
right here: Blacks and Chicanos
don't have resources. Communi
ties like East Palo Alto should
have funding and resources."

Brown added that the long-term
goal of the project is to formulate
permanent solutions to make East
Palo Alto more self-sufficient and
render stop-gap efforts obsolete.
Freshman Noel Maurer, a vol
unteer who previously registered
voters in conjunction with the
campaign for New York Mayor
Ed Koch, emphasized the signifi
cance of the drive for "people who
aren't able to vote or don't know
procedures or don't have easy
access to voting materials."
According to Asst. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Keith Archuleta, di
rector of the Black Community
Service Center and a member of
PERC, the participants in yester
day's drive planned to emphasize
the goals of the Rainbow Agenda
but were clearly working as a non
partisan effort.
PERC member Ron Nakao, an
East Palo Alto resident and a
graduate student in the School of
Education, noted that volunteers
cannot refuse to register residents
based on their political preference.
"But that doesn't mean you
have to turn in the registration
form for them," added Nakao.
President of the Stanford Col
lege Republicans Jennifer Bryson,
who did not attend the drive,
responded by saying the labeling
of yesterday's drive as non
partisan was "a farce."
"If they want to portray it as
a voter drive for the Democratic
party, that is what they should
call it," said Bryson.
Brown responded, "Something
I have noticed, the Republicans
do not go into these communities
to register blacks and Chicanos."
