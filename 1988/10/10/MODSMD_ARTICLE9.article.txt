# Research leader: from washing cages to AIDS breakthrough
## 
### Brad Hayward 
It's been a long time since he
cleaned his first animal cage, but
Dr. Irving Weissman has now
reached a pinnacle in his medical
research career.
Weissman, a Beekhuis Profes
sor of Cancer Biology at Stanford
Medical Center, headed up a re
search team that successfully im
planted a human immune system
into a mouse. This achievement
will allow medical researchers to
follow diseases such as AIDS as
they progress through the ani
mal s body.
For the medical community it
was acclaimed as a major
breakthrough. For Weissman, 48,
it was a high point of 25 years of
medical research into immunol
ogy.
His research began during his
high school years in Great Falls,
Mont. There was one research lab
in town, and Weissman got a job
during the summer washing the
lab animal cages. The head of the
lab gave Weissman scientific
papers to read and allowed him
to sit in on the lab's weekly dis
cussion sessions.
Weissman soon was discussing
the results of various experiments
with the head of the lab and ask
ing the same questions about

them that the scientific commu
nity was asking. Then, he started
his own experiments.
"Up to then I was not a great
student in high school; but by the
time I graduated I had written
two first-author papers," Weis
sman said.
Weissman went on to
Dartmouth for two years and
Montana State for one before
coming to Stanford. He went
through the five-year medical pro
gram, which allowed him time to
conduct research of his own while
completing the M.D. curriculum.
His fascination with the devel
opment of immune systems led
him in the early 1960s to Dr.
Henry Kaplan, "one of the leading
cancer researchers in the world,"
according to Weissman. Kaplan
had been head of the Stanford
Radiology Department since 1952
and developed radiotherapy as a
means for treating leukemia.
Kaplan became a mentor to
Weissman, providing him with his
own lab and technician. "When I
came in with ideas of what I
wanted to do, he allowed me to
follow them. I was incredibly nur
tured," said Weissman.
Graduation time was decision
time for Weissman. Though most
of his fellow students went on to
practice medicine, Weissman

decided to continue his medical
research.
"I was the first in many years
to do that, and everyone said I
was making a mistake," Weissman
recalled.
But he received grants, contin
ued his research, and was offered
a position in the Stanford Pathol
ogy Department. He's been there
ever since.
Over the years Weissman con
tinued to study immunological
tolerance. He was particularly in
terested in how blood-forming
cells go to the thymus, make lyp

equal to the life of a human.'

hocytes, and travel to different
parts of the body.
Weissman first became involved
in AIDS research in 1985, when
he was named to a committee
formed by the National Academcy
of Sciences to study the disease.
He learned that a mtyor problem
in AIDS research is that the dis
ease cannot be tracked in humans.
"We don't know how and where
the virus spreads and what hap
pens from the initial infection un
til when the person dies," Weis
sman said.
The only animal other than
man susceptible to the HIV virus
is the chimpanzee. Many scientists
thus turned to the chimp for AIDS
research, but Weissman felt that
using only chimps would rapidly
eradicate the species.
"The chimp could become ex
tinct and we still would not have
an answer," Weissman said.
Weissman and a team of pro
fessors and postdoctoral fellows

undertook the problem of finding
an animal model in which to du
plicate the human immune sys
tem for such research.
The results were published in
the Sept. 23 issue of Science mag
azine. In essence, the team took
the essential components of the
immune system from human fetal
tissue and implanted them in mice
infected without immune systems
of their own. The mice, which
would normally live three to four
months, have now been alive since
May 1987.
By using undeveloped organs
from human fetuses, the team has
been able to follow the growth of
the organs in the mice. The mice
will be implanted with HIV cells
and hopefully, the AIDS disease
will be able to be tracked.
Weissman hopes that the exper
iment with the mice will enable
the team to discover more about
human stem cell characteristics
and find out how stem cells grow.

Eventually, this could lead to new
techniques in bone marrow
transplantation and gene therapy,
in addition to preventing bone
marrow failure so that chemo
therapy can be more effective in
cancer treatment.
The team has come under
criticism from animal rights ac
tivists and anti-abortion groups
for the use of mice and human
fetuses for the research. "You
don't have to look far to find
people on this campus who think
the life of a mouse is equal to the
life of a human," Weissman said.
"But I don't agree with that. ...
We have a new way here of doing
human biology and medical re
search."
Weissman added, "I find it in
conceivable that we will create
what some people consider a
'need' for abortions. As long as
there are abortions, rather than
throw-away organs, we might as
well use them for medical re
search. ... It would be a crime
not to save lives with these fetal
tissues through this approach."
Weissman said the team can ex
periment with 200 to 400 mice
using one human fetus, while "30
abortions are performed every day
at a typical clinic."
