Using presidential candidate
George Bush's own words, Mi
chael Dukakis' top economic
policy adviser assailed what he
called the Republican party's
"voodoo economics" before a
packed Kresge Auditorium yes
terday afternoon.
Harvard Prof. Lawrence Sum
mers outlined the Democratic
presidential candidate's strategy
on major economic issues, in
cluding the budget, trade
deficits and innovative social
and education programs.
The self-described "pragmatic
liberal" had harsh words for
Bush's belief that the momen
tum of the 1980s will carry the
economy into the next decade.

"Bush's complacency is inappro
priate. . . . We are falling dan
gerously behind our competi
tors," he said.
While Summers' view is a
dark one, he does believe that
the United States can hold onto
its position with careful eco
nomic planning. He put forth a
four-point program emphasizing
fiscal responsibility and
cooperation between businesses
and government that he said will
make the United States "more
competitive, more successful."
Most important, the United
States must rein in spending
and encourage savings, Sum
mers stressed.
"We must improve the lagging
savings in America if we want
to be able to invest in future

growth," he said, adding that
Bush has promised to make no
specific spending cuts, only tax
cuts which will contribute to the
deficit.
Next, Summers argued that
the United States must link
foreign policy with trade policy.
He was careful to rule out pro
tectionism, but said the United
States should open up foreign
markets that are now closed in
order to narrow the trade def
icit.
"We need an activist trade
policy, a stategy of increasing
exports and decreasing im
ports," he said.
Third, the Harvard economist
said that in an economy that is


Harvard Economics Prof. Lawrence Summers, top economic adviser to presidential candidate
Gov. Michael Dukakis, argued last night that President Ronald Reagan's "voodoo economics"
have allowed us to slip behind world competition.
