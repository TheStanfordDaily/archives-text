# Med School links teen sex to cancer
## 
### Stephanie Page 
As many as one in seven
sexually active teenage girls is
Carrying a virus which may lead
to cervical cancer, according to
researchers at the Stanford Med
ical School.
In a survey of 1,700 sexually
active Bay Area girls between
the ages of 14 and 18, 18 percent
were found to be infected with
papilloma virus, the most com
mon sexually transmitted dis
ease, occuring more frequently
than gonorrhea and chlamydia
combined.
The link between the virus
and cervical cancer was discov
ered in 1974, but not until Dr.
Gary Schoolnik's study had it
been detected in so many teenage
girls.
Of the more than one dozen
strains of papilloma virus that
have been discovered, five have
been shown to be linked to cervi
cal cancer. Seventy-five percent
of the infected girls harbored one
of the five cancer causing strains
of the virus.
Approximately one in 100
women who carry the cancer
causing varieties of the virus
eventually develop cancer of the
cervix.
Schoolnik, assistant professor
of medical microbiology, recently
announced these findings at the
American Medical Association's
seventh-annual science writers'
conference in San Francisco.

In a Medical
School survey, 18
percent of
sexually active
Bay Area teen age
girls were found
to be infected with
papilloma virus.

Schoolnik said he gathered his
information from examinations
at Planned Parenthood clinics in
the Bay Area and the Teen Clinic
at UC-San Francisco.
Currently, the detection of the
papilloma virus remains a major
problem for physicians. Pap
smears, the common screening
test for cervical abnormalities,
often fail to detect the virus.
Schoolnik said he was optimis
tic that a more sensitive papil
loma screen should be available
soon and anticipates the Food
and Drug Administration will
grant final approval to such a
test within the next month.
The new test utilizes a special
microscope that is able to detect
cervical abnormalities, which are

manifestations of the virus and
precursors to cancer. The addi
tion of this test to routine Pap
smears would help avoid false
negative results which Schoolnik
estimates occur 20 to 40 percent
of the time. There are no exter
nal symptoms indicating these
cervical abnormalities.
Schoolnik's lab is currently
working to develop a vaccine for
the papilloma virus, but he in
dicated such a breakthrough to
be "light years away."
Papilloma virus, which
manifests itself under most cir
cumstances by causing genital
warts, affects both men and
women, but no link to cancer
has yet been shown in male
patients.
Strains of the virus were des
ignated "cancer causing" based
upon a statistical correlation of
infection and incidence of cancer,
the observation of viral genes in
90 percent of cervical cancer
cells, and the demonstration of
viral proteins synthesized in
these cells.
There is currently no drug
treatment to cure the papilloma
virus. Once cervical lesions are
observed, however, physical
removal of the diseased tissue is
possible using carbon dioxide
lasers or freezing therapy.
Schoolnik said he is encour
aged by what he sees as a
growing concern and activisim
in women with regard to health.
Women today are much more

aware of health, whereas in the
past they were more "timid
about such things," and physi
cians might not have responded
as strongly as they could have,
according to Schoolnik.
The spread of the papilloma
virus, however, has reached
"epidemic proportions," and is
alarming, especially among such
a young population, he said. Be
cause of the immaturity of the
cervix in teenage patients,
Schoolnik said their suscep
tibility to the virus is probably
higher.
In addition, the girls surveyed
had been sexually active for an
average of 2.6 years, which is
considered a short period in
which to have developed cervical
problems.
Although it is unclear what
triggers infected cells to become
cancerous, Schoolnik noted that
"co-factors," such as cigarette
smoke, were involved making
some women more susceptible
than others.
While men do not exhibit can
cer links to papilloma infection,
they can contract the virus and
develop external genital warts.
Schoolnik noted that men are
also important transmitters of
the virus.
Schoolnik emphasized, "aside
from monogamy, condoms, as
with every sexually transmitted
disease, are the very best means
of preventing" the contraction of
papilloma virus.

with every sexually transmitted
disease, are the very best means
of preventing" the contraction of
papilloma virus.
As many as one in seven
sexually active teenage girls is
Carrying a virus which may lead
to cervical cancer, according to
researchers at the Stanford Med
ical School.
In a survey of 1,700 sexually
active Bay Area girls between
the ages of 14 and 18, 18 percent
were found to be infected with
papilloma virus, the most com
mon sexually transmitted dis
ease, occuring more frequently
than gonorrhea and chlamydia
combined.
The link between the virus
and cervical cancer was discov
ered in 1974, but not until Dr.
Gary Schoolnik's study had it
been detected in so many teenage
girls.
Of the more than one dozen
strains of papilloma virus that
have been discovered, five have
been shown to be linked to cervi
cal cancer. Seventy-five percent
of the infected girls harbored one
of the five cancer causing strains
of the virus.
Approximately one in 100
women who carry the cancer
causing varieties of the virus
eventually develop cancer of the
cervix.
Schoolnik, assistant professor
of medical microbiology, recently
announced these findings at the
American Medical Association's
seventh-annual science writers'
conference in San Francisco.

In a Medical
School survey, 18
percent of
sexually active
Bay Area teen age
girls were found
to be infected with
papilloma virus.

Schoolnik said he gathered his
information from examinations
at Planned Parenthood clinics in
the Bay Area and the Teen Clinic
at UC-San Francisco.
Currently, the detection of the
papilloma virus remains a major
problem for physicians. Pap
smears, the common screening
test for cervical abnormalities,
often fail to detect the virus.
Schoolnik said he was optimis
tic that a more sensitive papil
loma screen should be available
soon and anticipates the Food
and Drug Administration will
grant final approval to such a
test within the next month.
The new test utilizes a special
microscope that is able to detect
cervical abnormalities, which are

manifestations of the virus and
precursors to cancer. The addi
tion of this test to routine Pap
smears would help avoid false
negative results which Schoolnik
estimates occur 20 to 40 percent
of the time. There are no exter
nal symptoms indicating these
cervical abnormalities.
Schoolnik's lab is currently
working to develop a vaccine for
the papilloma virus, but he in
dicated such a breakthrough to
be "light years away."
Papilloma virus, which
manifests itself under most cir
cumstances by causing genital
warts, affects both men and
women, but no link to cancer
has yet been shown in male
patients.
Strains of the virus were des
ignated "cancer causing" based
upon a statistical correlation of
infection and incidence of cancer,
the observation of viral genes in
90 percent of cervical cancer
cells, and the demonstration of
viral proteins synthesized in
these cells.
There is currently no drug
treatment to cure the papilloma
virus. Once cervical lesions are
observed, however, physical
removal of the diseased tissue is
possible using carbon dioxide
lasers or freezing therapy.
Schoolnik said he is encour
aged by what he sees as a
growing concern and activisim
in women with regard to health.
Women today are much more

aware of health, whereas in the
past they were more "timid
about such things," and physi
cians might not have responded
as strongly as they could have,
according to Schoolnik.
The spread of the papilloma
virus, however, has reached
"epidemic proportions," and is
alarming, especially among such
a young population, he said. Be
cause of the immaturity of the
cervix in teenage patients,
Schoolnik said their suscep
tibility to the virus is probably
higher.
In addition, the girls surveyed
had been sexually active for an
average of 2.6 years, which is
considered a short period in
which to have developed cervical
problems.
Although it is unclear what
triggers infected cells to become
cancerous, Schoolnik noted that
"co-factors," such as cigarette
smoke, were involved making
some women more susceptible
than others.
While men do not exhibit can
cer links to papilloma infection,
they can contract the virus and
develop external genital warts.
Schoolnik noted that men are
also important transmitters of
the virus.
Schoolnik emphasized, "aside
from monogamy, condoms, as
with every sexually transmitted
disease, are the very best means
of preventing" the contraction of
papilloma virus.
