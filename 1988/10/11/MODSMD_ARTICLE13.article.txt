## Premier resigns in Czechoslovakia 
### 
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP)
— Lubomir Strougal, who was
considered an economic reformer
and had been the nation's premier
for more than 18 years, resigned
yesterday and gave up his seat on
the 12-member Communist Party
Politburo.
Peter Colotka, premier of
Slovakia, also quit his job and
membership on the party's ruling
body. Communist Party chief
Milos Jakes announced the
resignations at a plenary session
of the party Central Committee,
the official news agency CTK re
ported.
The shake-up in Czechoslovakia
follows similar government reor
ganizations in the Soviet Union,
Hungary and Poland, as well as
unrest in Yugoslavia.
The names of Strougal, Colotka
and Foreign Minister Bohuslav
Chnoupek came up in a corrup
tion scandal last year.

Stanisdlav Babinsky, who ran a
catering and supply operation in
rural Slovakia, was sentenced to
years in prison after a three
month trial that ended June 30,
1987.
Nine other defendants also were
sent to prison for "stealing
Socialist ownership on a large
scale for several years and com
mitting other criminal acts."
Babinsky named Strougal and
Colotka during the trial, but it
was not clear what favors they
were supposed to have received.
Chnoupek was said to have been
given furniture, which he later
paid for.
When he took over as party chief
from Gustav Husak in December
last year, Jakes said the fight
against corruption would be
among his priorities.
In his speech yesterday to the
Central Committee, Jakes also an
nounced other changes in the

Politburo, party secretariat, Cen
tral Committee and the federal,
Czech and Slovak governments.
Czechoslovakia consists of two
republics of equal rights, the
Czech Socialist Republic and the
Slovak Socialist Republic. Each is
governed by a National Council,
which delegates to an overall
Federal Assembly responsibility
for constitutional and foreign af
fairs, defense and important eco
nomic decisions.
The primary source of power
in Czechoslovakia is the Commu
nist Party.
CTK quoted the party chief as
saying the actions were taken "in
the interest of mastering the de
manding tasks of economic and
social restructuring," but its
report did not mention other
names.
Rumors of leadership changes
have circulated for months. Jakes
and other officials have indicated

younger people would be
promoted to senior positions.
Strougal, 63, said during inter
views with Western journalists
earlier this year that he wanted
to step down.
He was considered a strong ad
vocate of economic reform similar
to that being promoted in the So
viet Union by President Mikhail
Gorbachev, but his proposals were
diluted and delayed by a party
leadership that has appeared re
luctant to follow the Soviet exam
ple.
Jakes said yesterday "there are
persistent serious shortcomings"
in the economy.
Last April, in remarks ending
a two-day Central Committee ses
sion, Jakes said the leadership
wanted "to elevate younger com
rades, and thus create conditions
for further successful fulfillment
of party tasks."
