BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP)
â€” Communist authorities put
more police on the streets and
imposed unspecified "urgent
measures" in Montenegro's capi
tal yesterday, but protests kept
up, fed by economic crisis and
ethnic tension.
Protest has swept much of
southern and eastern Yugoslavia
in recent weeks. Police used vio
lent tactics for the first time over
the weekend to disperse Mon
tenegrin students and workers de
manding dismissal of local Com
munist Party leaders.
Several Yugoslavs reported that
civil defense units in Belgrade
were put on a higher level of alert
Saturday. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
No sign of trouble surfaced in
Belgrade.
President Raif Dizdarevic ap
pealed for calm on national tele
vision Sunday night, warning of
unspecified emergency measures.
Yugoslavia consists of six
republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own gov
ernment and Communist Party
structure.
I Unrest persisted yesterday in
"Titograd, the capital of Mon
tenegro 280 miles southwest of
Belgrade, and the regional party
leadership held an emergency

meeting, the official news agency
Tanjug reported.
About 15,000 people at Niksic,
30 miles north of Titograd, joined
2,800 striking steelworkers yes
terday for a street rally, Tanjug
said.
Police used clubs and tear gas
to break up weekend crowds in
Titograd and to disperse marchers
in Niksic who were on their way
to Titograd.
The Titograd rally was an ex
plosion of anger over hardships
resulting from the austerity pro
gram imposed by the government
in May because of a $21 billion
foreign debt and an annual infla
tion rate of 217 percent. The un
employment rate is about 15 per
cent.
Concern for Montenegrins in
southern Serbia's troubled
Kosovo province also has stirred
passions. Serbs and Montenegrins
in Kosovo, most of them Chris
tians, are a minority to the mainly
Moslem ethnic Albanian popula
tion.
Tanjug reported, without
details, that "urgent measures"
were imposed yesterday in
Titograd. It said later 1,000 con
struction workers called off a
strike after local party leaders
promised to consider their de
mands.
