ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) - Sol
diers with machine guns fired on
protesters yesterday, killing at
least 25 people and wounding doz
ens, witnesses said. President
Chadli Bendjedid promised re
forms to end the bloody weeklong
revolt.
Bendjedid, in a nationwide ad
dress last night, hinted he would
not run for re-election at the end
of the year. But he defended his
declared state of emergency and
said he would "not allow the coun
try to fall into anarchy."
Reliable reports from police,
doctors and other sources say up
to 300 people have been killed in
the riots that began last week,
the worst in this North African
nation since its independence
from France in 1962.
No official casualty figures have
been issued.
Yesterday's shooting occurred
in the Bab-el-Oued district of
western Algiers during protests
against spiraling prices and
Bendjedid's economic policies.
"There were bodies laying on
all sides," one witness said. "The
soldiers were piling them into
trucks, one body on top of an
other."

The witness and others who saw
the shooting reported several
dozen people wounded, with some
of the seriously injured taken
away by ambulances.
Army helicopters armed with
missiles made repeated passes
over Bab-el-Oued at low altitude,
apparently trying to frighten the
protesters.
The demonstration was organ
ized by the Islamic fundamentalist
Movement for Algerian Renewal,
which has made claims of leading
the revolt.
A marcher reported seeing the
body of a teen-ager wrapped in a
sheet and taken away by friends.
Others spoke of at least 25 and
perhaps 30 dead.
Soldiers fired machine guns into
the air to break up the march,
which was banned under a state
of emergency declared last Thurs
day. Troopers have orders to shoot
demonstrators who refuse to dis
perse.
Witnesses said soldiers started
shooting and demonstrators
shouted to people watching from
balconies to throw down firearms
so they could "defend ourselves."
