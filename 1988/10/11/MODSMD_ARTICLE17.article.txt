# Indecency law to face court challenge
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Broadcasters and free
speech advocates are preparing to challenge in court
a new law that beginning early next year will ban
sexually explicit material from radio and television.
This blanket prohibition, passed as part of a $14.9
billion appropriations hill that funds the Federal
Communications Commission and other agencies,
is designed, as proponents say, to clean the "garbage"
from the airwaves.
Others in Congress say, however, that a preoc
cupation with election-year politics snookered law
makers into passing what they say is a clearly
unconstitutional law.
"It was just a fear that someone might think
they were for pornography or obscenity," said Rep.
Neal Smith, D-lowa, "It's an election-year fear, and
most of them felt that way. If it had been a secret
ballot, it wouldn't have gotten hut .'3O votes."
As it turned out, the House last month voted
210-204 to instruct House conferees, reconciling
with senators differing versions of the appropria
tions measure, to accept the Senate-passed ban.
The measure was added to the appropriations
bill, which was passed and signed by President
Reagan earlier this month. It directs the FCC to
draft a new set of indecency rules by Jan. .'JIf 1989.
Over-the-air broadcasts, but not cable programming,
would be covered.
Representatives of broadcasting companies, First
Amendment advocates and civil liberties defenders
that earlier challenged the FCC's indecency rules
met recently to discuss the ban, said Timothy Dyk,

lead attorney in the previous case.
"It's safe to predict that some or all of the original
group will challenge" the new law, he said.
In the earlier case, decided July 29 by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the
court "makes plain that banning indecent material
during the entire 24-hour period is plainly uncon
stitutional," Dyk said.
"We're not talking about obscenity, but material
that has a lot of societal value — artistic, literary,
even political merit — and because the definition
is so broad it could be considered indecent," he said.
The Senate passed the ban in July after sponsor
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., alleged that the FCC was
permitting broadcasters to air programs that in
cluded "disgusting bestiality, sodomy and child sex."
"Garbage is garbage no matter what the time of
day or night may be," Helms said on the Senate
floor. He offered no specifics.
The ban was aimed at the FCC's policy of allowing
sexually explicit material to be aired between mid
night and 6 a.m., when the agency said children
were not likely to be in the audience.
The FCC had refrained from an around-the-clock
ban because it said prior court rulings had held
that the First Amendment protects indecent speech
but allows it to be "channeled" to avoid children.
Obscenity — material that appeals to the prurient
interest and lacking serious artistic, literary, political
or scientific value — is banned from the airwaves
all the time.
