Gov's veto will hurt aliens
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Nearly half a million
immigrants who qualify for U.S. citizenship may
fail to earn legal status because a gubernatorial
veto will bring on a shortage of English classes,
aliens' rights groups said yesterday.
Gov. George Deukmejian's veto of Senate Bill
9 on Sept. 30 blocked the distribution of federal
funds to community agencies providing classes
in U.S. civics and English as a second language,
said Anna Kamsvaag, an attorney for the Coali
tion for Human Immigration Rights of Los An
geles.
About 800,000 amnesty applicants statewide
need classroom instruction to fulfill amnesty re
quirements but a recent U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service survey found only 340,000
spaces available, Ms. Kamsvaag said.
Dalai Lama would avoid politics
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — The Dalai
Lama said he will shun politics if Tibet gains
independence from China and any talks he has
with the Chinese will center on Tibet's future,
not on his own return home.
The exiled spiritual leader said he would stay
out of any future government because his status

as god-king of Tibetan Buddhists would inhibit
the development of democracy.
"My participation would be a hindrance of a
healthy democratic atmosphere," he told a news
conference at the Swedish International Peace
Research Insitute on the last stop of a Nordic
tour.
"Let the young, intelligent Tibetans carry the
responsibility for leading the government. I want
to remain a simple Buddhist monk."
Peru police: Rebel attack failed
HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) — Eight leftist guer
rillas were killed when an outmanned police force
repelled a rebel attack in Peru's eastern Amazon
jungle, officials in this state capital said yesterday.
About 100 combatants of the Mao-inspired
Shining Path guerrilla group attacked the police
post in Villa Rica, 100 miles north of here, before
dawn Sunday, police officials said.
The 20 police troopers inside the post drove
off the rebels, who were armed with automatic
weapons and dynamite, without suffering
casualties, according to the police report.
The rebels dynamited and torched three gov
ernment offices during the attack on Villa Rica,
a town of 8,000 inhabitants.
