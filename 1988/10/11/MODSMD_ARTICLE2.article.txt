# Interview with President Kennedy:
## Bolster 'human ties' with Hoover 
### 
Editor's note: University President
Donald Kennedy aired his views Friday
on the relationship between the Hoover
Institution and Stanford, along with
other issues and challenges Stanford
faces this year, during an hour-long in
terview with The Daily. This is the sec
ond part of a two-day series.

Senior staff writer
Hoover and Stanford lies
While the exact nature of the rela
tionship between Hoover and Stanford
has been discussed and questioned for
years, some University faculty have

pushed recently for total University
governance over the conservative think
tank.
Meanwhile, Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell said the current talks are
"testing my patience" and has threat
ened to sever all ties between the two
bodies.
The Faculty Senate will meet Oct. 13
to discuss the University's relationship
with Hoover. Kennedy said "one never
knows what to expect" from senate dis
cussions on Hoover.
He added that some of the previous
discussions have been helpful in direct
ing work between the University
Provost and Hoover leadership on the
joint appointment process, for example.

Kennedy said the ties that need
strengthening are the "human ones.
That is, the ones that provide for joint
academic activities . . . especially joint
appointments."
He then cautioned that "not much
needs to be done" concerning debate
around the formal structure of Hoover.
"I think a good base is already in
place. ... In my view, to take a lengthy
look at governance, at this time, would
be unfortunate. The main business
before us now is to get in place a really
first-class new (Hoover) director. I'm
anxious to keep us focused on that."
Campbell and mandatory retirement
Campbell, the 64-year-old director of
Hoover, made several turnarounds this
year in his decisions about continuing
his work at the famous think tank.
In June, Campbell threatened to sue
the University after the Board of Trus
tees asked the 28-year director of Hoo
ver to retire — in accordance with a
1959 trustee resolution that top admin
istrative positions be relinquished at age
65.
The situation seemed to have calmed
in July when Campbell said he was
"happy as a clam" about a trustee agree
ment stating he would step down to
become a lifelong counselor at Hoover.
But in August, Campbell said the
latest conditions were not satisfactory.

Nevertheless, President of the Board of
Trustees James Gaither said Campbell's
retirement was still effective Aug. 31,
1989.
Kennedy said that Campbell's appar
ent change of mind about accepting the
position of counselor "did not affect the
timetable for the search committee for
the appointment for a new director."
The final outcome concerning Camp
bell's position is hard to predict. His
story, nevertheless, raises questions
about the law mandating retirement.
Kennedy said "mandatory retirement
has been extended from age 65, and
probably, in the next little while, will
be uncapped for most jobs.
"I have some reservations about the
wisdom of that as an exercise in public
policy, but that's the law."
Kennedy went on to say the law "dis
tinguishes between retirement period
and retirement from executive posi
tions."
Meese fellowship at Hoover
Former U. S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 has become a "distinguished
visiting fellow" at Hoover at the invi
tation of Campbell during the summer.
As director of Hoover, Campbell has
the authority to invite visitors to use
the University's resources for indeter
minate periods of time without permis
sion from Kennedy.
Kennedy said that "it is important
for everybody to understand what (the
fellowship) is and what it is not. Edwin
Meese does not have an academic ap
pointment at Hoover or Stanford."
He then said that Stanford cus
tomarily permits departments, schools
or Hoover officials to invite people to
the University, and that the process is
done very informally.
With regard to Meese's salary and
other accomodations, Kennedy said,
"Hoover Institution has funds that they
can spend in a discretionary way ... It
is the responsibility of the Controller's
Office to see that (the rules concerning
salary and benefits) are followed."

Kennedy said that Campbell's appar
ent change of mind about accepting the
position of counselor "did not affect the
timetable for the search committee for
the appointment for a new director."
The final outcome concerning Camp
bell's position is hard to predict. His
story, nevertheless, raises questions
about the law mandating retirement.
Kennedy said "mandatory retirement
has been extended from age 65, and
probably, in the next little while, will
be uncapped for most jobs.
"I have some reservations about the
wisdom of that as an exercise in public
policy, but that's the law."
Kennedy went on to say the law "dis
tinguishes between retirement period
and retirement from executive posi
tions."
Meese fellowship at Hoover
Former U. S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese 111 has become a "distinguished
visiting fellow" at Hoover at the invi
tation of Campbell during the summer.
As director of Hoover, Campbell has
the authority to invite visitors to use
the University's resources for indeter
minate periods of time without permis
sion from Kennedy.
Kennedy said that "it is important
for everybody to understand what (the
fellowship) is and what it is not. Edwin
Meese does not have an academic ap
pointment at Hoover or Stanford."
He then said that Stanford cus
tomarily permits departments, schools
or Hoover officials to invite people to
the University, and that the process is
done very informally.
With regard to Meese's salary and
other accomodations, Kennedy said,
"Hoover Institution has funds that they
can spend in a discretionary way ... It
is the responsibility of the Controller's
Office to see that (the rules concerning
salary and benefits) are followed."
