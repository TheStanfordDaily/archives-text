Hoover and Stanford lies
While the exact nature of the rela
tionship between Hoover and Stanford
has been discussed and questioned for
years, some University faculty have

pushed recently for total University
governance over the conservative think
tank.
Meanwhile, Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell said the current talks are
"testing my patience" and has threat
ened to sever all ties between the two
bodies.
The Faculty Senate will meet Oct. 13
to discuss the University's relationship
with Hoover. Kennedy said "one never
knows what to expect" from senate dis
cussions on Hoover.
He added that some of the previous
discussions have been helpful in direct
ing work between the University
Provost and Hoover leadership on the
joint appointment process, for example.

Kennedy said the ties that need
strengthening are the "human ones.
That is, the ones that provide for joint
academic activities . . . especially joint
appointments."
He then cautioned that "not much
needs to be done" concerning debate
around the formal structure of Hoover.
"I think a good base is already in
place. ... In my view, to take a lengthy
look at governance, at this time, would
be unfortunate. The main business
before us now is to get in place a really
first-class new (Hoover) director. I'm
anxious to keep us focused on that."
