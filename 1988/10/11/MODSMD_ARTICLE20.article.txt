Phi Delt suspension
signals commitment to
party-rule enforcement

ONCE AGAIN the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity has been
suspended. But Residential
Education's suspension last week
of the Phi Delts is a warning that
should be heeded not only by fra
ternities but by all of the Stanford
community.
Residential Education's action
should not be viewed as simply an
attempt to nail the Phi Delts. The
•issue is not whether or not the
phi Delts' party focused on alcohol
more than any other party at Stan
ford, but that parties in general
should simply follow alcohol policy
guidelines.
The guidelines state that "the
focus of an event should not be on
alcohol" and that "equally attrac
tive non-alcoholic beverages
(EANABS) must be available in
equal quantities whenever alcohol
is served."
The alcohol policy guidelines are
very clear and easy to understand.
For this reason, organizers of par
ties at which alcohol is served have
no excuse for not following them.
If party organizers simply spent
some extra money on EANABS
and gave people a place to dance,
more students, especially non
drinkers, would feel welcome.
The Phi Delts' Kamikaze Party
last week violated both of these

stipulations of the University al
cohol policy. The awarding of head
bands for the consumption of 10
kamikazes (an alcoholic beverage)
or 10 beers clearly highlighted the
fact that the consumption of alco
hol was the party's main focus.
In addition, EANABS were
scarce and the only apparent dance
floor space was on top of the bar.
The decision to suspend the Phi
Delts clearly signals that parties
with alcohol as the main focus will
no longer be tolerated — whether
they be held at a fraternity or else
where.
Residential Education should be
applauded for enforcing a basic
tenet of the University's alcohol
policy. By decisively acting at the
beginning of the academic year,
Residential Education has clearly
shown that the alcohol policy will
be enforced.
Whether it is a fraternity, dorm,
or private party, it makes things
more agreeable for everyone in
volved if the main focus of the
party is not the consumption of
alcohol.
Believe it or not, some people go
to partieg just because they like to
dance and see their friends. Com
pliance with the alcohol policy
guidelines will not only make
things better for everyone, but as
Residential Education's actions
last week have shown, failure to
do so will no longer be tolerated.
Res Ed has made it clear that
those who do not obey University
alcohol guidelines will rightfully
face punitive action.
