## Parenthood puts an education to the ultimate test 
### 
Ashley ryan's column on
parenthood ("Choosing to be a
parent," Oct. 5) was truly a
refreshing break from the single
minded, career-oriented attitudes that
all too frequently invade the minds of
most Stanford students. She also raises
a difficult issue for those who are
Concerned about managing a career
and a family at the same time.
Too many people mistakenly equate
the ability to have anything with the
ability to have everything, and Ryan
should be praised for pointing out that

people invariably need to make
sacrifices throughout their lives. She
approaches the issue realistically.
However, she does make a statement
that seems unfair to many people,
including, oddly enough, herself. Ryan
says she feels "wimpy" about her
choice to sacrifice professional goals for
a family because, among other reasons,
she would "waste the education" and
other opportunities that Stanford
offers.
Ryan should not give parenting such
short shrift. While many people are

adept at "having" children (a feat that
involves skills no more complicated
than those exhibited by students at an
average frat party), few people really
are able to "raise" children — a far
more difficult task, involving difficult
decisions and real-life tests that dwarf
even the MCAT in magnitude.
A quality education does more than
prepare individuals to become success
ful professionals; it helps students
learn to deal with many more complex
and more important aspects of life. If
it didn't, Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity might as well have been named

Leland Stanford Junior Vo-Tech Insti
tute (high-level Vo-Tech, certainly, but
Vo-Tech nonetheless).
Of course, all professionals face
many seemingly trivial, mundane
chores every day, and parenting has •
more than its fair share of such expe
riences. But in deciding to sacrifice
some professional goals to help raise a
family, Ashley Ryan is not wasting a
college education; she is putting it to
the ultimate test.
