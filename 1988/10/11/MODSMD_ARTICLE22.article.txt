# Comments on Phi Delt suspension were misconstrued
## 
### 
In the Daily of Friday, Oct. 7, I had
a chance to see in print my first reac
tions of the 1988-89 year to fraternity-
University conflict as Inter-Fraternity
Council president.
It is very difficult for a journalist to
interview someone and, from a cascade
of ideas and statements, interpret fun
damental meaning and implied attitude.
Beyond that, a journalist must find a
brief snippet of a quote which might
work into their story expressing an
entire philosophy in a few short words.
I understand this to be a difficult task,
and because I understand this, I
decided to try to make my responses
sharp and quotable this year.
When I received a call from a
reporter asking questions about my
reaction to the temporary suspension
of the Phi Delts' social privileges, I
wanted to collect my facts and my
opinions in a concise, yet clear format.
I asked the reporter if I could get her

name and number, research the actual
circumstances, formulate an intelligent
response, and call her back with a
reaction. She* thought that was a good
idea, so that is what I did. The re
sponse I formulated (and presented
later to this reporter word for word) is
listed in its entirety below:
"The placing of Phi Delts on tempo
rary social suspension reflects the com
munity attitude of faculty, administra
tion, and students toward expecting
more from fraternities than just great
parties and lots of alcohol.
"We, as community members, can
work within the IFC and University
party guidelines; it just takes more
creative thought and effort in party
planning. Alcohol can be a part of our
events, but there is no reason for it to
be the focus of our events. We are
smarter than that.
"The IFC will work with Russ
Pangborn and the Phi Delts to help
affect positive change in individual
behaviors, reflecting the positive
change in societal attitudes."
In this case, the damage is limited:
one misquoted word (offer vs. effect),
one misquoted name (Pisano vs.
Pangborn), and one phrase out of the

blue ("not a good idea").
I feel that we should start strong
and true, and if we deteriorate later,
well, we will cross that bridge when we
come to it. I applaud the effort of the
Daily to try to get comments from as
many individuals involved in the issue
as possible. I just hope that, through
cooperation, we can present all sides'
attitudes, in addition to their names.
