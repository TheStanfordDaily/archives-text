# Stanford Democrat did not criticize Campbell in speech
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the
Daily article printed on Wednesday,
Oct. 6 about Anna Eshoo's speech to
the first Stanford Democrats' Meeting.
I was misquoted by the Daily as criti
cizing Tom Campbell which is totally
untrue as I never mentioned Campbell
in my remarks. Although the Daily did
print a correction on Friday, it is much

more important to me that people
know what I did say about why I sup
port Anna Eshoo.
I was first introduced to Anna Eshoo
in the spring when 1 was a member of
Women's Issues '88. I found she had a
fantastic stand on women's issues plus
a great record of helping women in her
role as a San Mateo County Supervi
sor. Her efforts include implementing a
comparable worth plan for all employ
ees in the county and establishing a
24-hour child care facility for the
30,000 employees of the San Francisco
Airport.
As I said on Monday, and I write
here again, these are the most impor
tant issues for me in this election year.
For you, the issue may be the environ
ment or the budget deficit. Anna has
ideas coupled with great experience in
these areas also, and those ideas are
worth seeking out!
This race could be decided by 1,000
votes. A big voter turnout at Stanford
would make the difference. I urge you
to find out about Anna Eshoo, and
find out why my remarks were positive
and in support of her.
