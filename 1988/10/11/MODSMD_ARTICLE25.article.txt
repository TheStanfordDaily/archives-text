## Learn to live for today

About a third of my cases are suffering
from no clinically defineable neurosis, but
from the senselessness and emptiness of
their lives. This can be described as the
general neurosis of our time.
— Carl Jung
MY GRANDFATHER DIED this
weekend. I'm not sure how his
death will affect me — it's the
first time a close relative has died in my
family. But his passing away did force
me to reflect upon my own mortality. It
forced me to think about such topics as
death, loneliness, and failure. It forced
me to ask the question: "What is life all
about?"
I would be arrogant (and wrong) to
claim I know the answer to this question
— a question that, since the dawn of
time, has bewildered, depressed, and con
fused many a person. I would be foolish
to try to answer this question in one
Daily column. But I can, perhaps, shed
a little bit of light upon the search for
a life that matters.
About two months ago, I read a book
titled, "When All You've Ever Wanted
Isn't Enough" by Harold Kushner. Many
students here at Stanford have gotten all
they've ever wanted. They're at one of
the best universities in the coifntry.
They're young, healthy and dynamic.
They know there is going to always be
food on the table (so what if it's Stern
food). They also know that their future
is bright. Yet I feel that after all the
classwork is done, after all the parties
are over, and after the hangover subsides,

many students experience a sense of frus
tration and emptiness. 1 know I've felt
that way.
One of my best friends once said to
me: "My life is only a series of distrac
tions." 1 don't think it's uncommon to
find people who are so caught up in their
classes, so caught up in appearances, so
caught up in amassing great wealth, and
so caught up in power that their life slips
by unexamined. Kushner writes that "it
is not dying that people are afraid of . . .
something more unsettling and more
tragic than dying frightens us. We are
afraid of never having lived, of coming
to the end of our days with the sense
that we were never really alive, that we
never figured out what life was for."
So how does one pull oneself out of a
life of "distractions" and into a life of
meaning? For some, it is in experiencing
the joy and gratification of helping
others. Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote,
"To leave the world a bit better, whether
by a healthy child, or a redeemed social
condition; to know even one life has
breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded." For others,
it is finding solace in spirituality; it is
in building deep, meaningful relation
ships; it is in realizing all the gifts you
have been given; it is in noticing the little
things in life and enjoying them.
1 know I often let a beautiful Stanford
day pass by while I'm indoors studying.
I often rush through my food without
really tasting it because I have more "im
portant" things to do. I sometimes forget
to call my family because finishing a

computer program is more "important."
I sometimes fail to write letters because
I'm just too "busy."
Kushner writes that life is about
"loving and being loved. It is about en
joying your food and sitting in the sun
rather than rushing through lunch and
hurrying back to the office. It is about
savoring the beauty of moments that
don't last, the sunsets, the leaves turning
color, the rare moments of true human
communication. ..." I believe that to be
more fully human, perhaps one ought to
expose oneself to as many meaningful
experiences as possible. And that these
experiences- should not be viewed as "dis
tractions," but rather as necessary com
ponents of a good life.
As I reflect back upon my grandfather,
I'm unsure as to whether he died a happy
man. I am sure, however, that without
him, without his love, and without his
encouragement, I might not be here today.
In an indirect way, through his sacrifices,
failures, and successes, he has taught me
how to live. And in Kushner's words:
"When you have learned how to live, life
itself is the reward."

titled, "When All You've Ever Wanted
Isn't Enough" by Harold Kushner. Many
students here at Stanford have gotten all
they've ever wanted. They're at one of
the best universities in the coifntry.
They're young, healthy and dynamic.
They know there is going to always be
food on the table (so what if it's Stern
food). They also know that their future
is bright. Yet I feel that after all the
classwork is done, after all the parties
are over, and after the hangover subsides,

many students experience a sense of frus
tration and emptiness. 1 know I've felt
that way.
One of my best friends once said to
me: "My life is only a series of distrac
tions." 1 don't think it's uncommon to
find people who are so caught up in their
classes, so caught up in appearances, so
caught up in amassing great wealth, and
so caught up in power that their life slips
by unexamined. Kushner writes that "it
is not dying that people are afraid of . . .
something more unsettling and more
tragic than dying frightens us. We are
afraid of never having lived, of coming
to the end of our days with the sense
that we were never really alive, that we
never figured out what life was for."
So how does one pull oneself out of a
life of "distractions" and into a life of
meaning? For some, it is in experiencing
the joy and gratification of helping
others. Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote,
"To leave the world a bit better, whether
by a healthy child, or a redeemed social
condition; to know even one life has
breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded." For others,
it is finding solace in spirituality; it is
in building deep, meaningful relation
ships; it is in realizing all the gifts you
have been given; it is in noticing the little
things in life and enjoying them.
1 know I often let a beautiful Stanford
day pass by while I'm indoors studying.
I often rush through my food without
really tasting it because I have more "im
portant" things to do. I sometimes forget
to call my family because finishing a

computer program is more "important."
I sometimes fail to write letters because
I'm just too "busy."
Kushner writes that life is about
"loving and being loved. It is about en
joying your food and sitting in the sun
rather than rushing through lunch and
hurrying back to the office. It is about
savoring the beauty of moments that
don't last, the sunsets, the leaves turning
color, the rare moments of true human
communication. ..." I believe that to be
more fully human, perhaps one ought to
expose oneself to as many meaningful
experiences as possible. And that these
experiences- should not be viewed as "dis
tractions," but rather as necessary com
ponents of a good life.
As I reflect back upon my grandfather,
I'm unsure as to whether he died a happy
man. I am sure, however, that without
him, without his love, and without his
encouragement, I might not be here today.
In an indirect way, through his sacrifices,
failures, and successes, he has taught me
how to live. And in Kushner's words:
"When you have learned how to live, life
itself is the reward."
