## Stairway to Heaven's circular truth If the Bug speaks true, could fiction be stranger? Would Byron agree? 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
The Bug believes television to be al
mighty and rightly so. Take, for in
stance, the fact that the Bug was just
recently stricken by feelings of in
feriority due to television.
This most rare powerlessness was felt
by the Bug in light of the relentless
heroics of Batman and Robin as they
faced off with Burgess Meredith's Pen
guin on Channel 20 last week.
Unwitting dopes, Commissioner Gor
don and Chief O'Hara readied to exhibit
their skill at the Penguin's carnival
shooting gallery while Batman and the
well-muscled Boy Wonder struggled to

loose themselves from ropes which
..yed them just behind the cloth tar
■:cis at which Gotham's finest were
aiming!
Quick thinking and bullet-proof-boot
jsoles saved our pantyhosed friends from
death, while the shock of the rifles'
power jolted Batman's Batknife loose.
Soon, if somewhat reluctantly, free of
' heir binds, the Dynamic Duo made the
Penguin pay for his evil machinations,
dooming him to a fate worse than
Fresno: that he would someday host
."Those Amazing Animals."
Why does the Bug tell you this? Sim
uly because questions for the Bug are
fl£#it left in the Bug Me box just inside
live Daily offices or sent via Lots to

Dear Bug,
Is truth really stranger than fiction?
— Mrs. Paul
The common claim, "Truth is
stranger than fiction," was first penned
by .£hat zany prankster Lord Byron in

Canto XIV, st. 101 of "Don Juan". The
actual words are '"Tis strange — but
true; for truth is always strange, —
/Stranger than fiction."
Many recorded quotations concerning
truth overestimate this enigmatic ideal
sought most frequently by parents,
philosophers and Judge Joseph Wapner.
Some Middle Eastern guy named Nu
wrote, circa 4000 8.C., "I shall not suf
fer defeat for my word is truth." Fat
chance, Dazzy Vance.
Seneca wrote, "Truth lurks in deep
hiding and is wrapped in mystery." He
also is wrong, as both the Bug and E.A.
Poe have always known. Edgar has writ
ten that "as regards the most important
knowledge, I do believe that she is in
variably superficial." The Bug contends
that most don't know when they've
found Truth and will most likely pass
it by.
What was your question? Oh yes, I
remember. In direct response, the Bug
can say unequivocally, # "lt depends, but
usually."
Case No. 1: God ... a) if there is a
bearded supreme being who is all
knowing, all-seeing and lives in the sky,
that is stranger than fiction, b) millions
of people believe that there is such an
entity. Thus c) Truth is stranger than
fiction.
Case No. 2: stories you hear ... a)
my mom used to tell me about a doc
umented event wherein Uncle Arthur
spent eight consecutive hours counting
blades of grass in our backyard, b) in
Judy Blume's "Forever," a fictional ac
count of a young woman's first
romance, jealousy plagues the relation
ship's final stages. Thus c) Truth is
stranger than fiction.
Case No. 3: cigarettes ... a) cigarettes
certainly are not stranger than fiction,
b) some cigarettes are True. Thus c)
Truth is sometimes not stranger than
fiction.
Dear Bug,
Is there any meaning to the lyrics of
"Stairway to Heaven?" A friend said
that there is no meaning to them. I read
the lyrics off an album cover and they
do appear to be a string of non sequiturs.
If there is an actual interpretation of
the song, what is it?
— Martha Quinn
Now, the Bug is not beyond jumping
up and down to the thrashing-metal
blues of Led Zeppelin. However, that
doesn't mean he doesn't think it's a
joke that "Stairway" is consistently
ranked No. 1 on radio stations' top 500
lists. If there is any meaning to the
lyrics, you can be sure that it has noth
ing to do with the song's popularity . . .
or does it?! (haunting organ tones here)
Ostensibly, we're simply dealing with
words that sound good together but
mean nothing. However, the message

is not so inscrutable when "Stairway"
is played backwards. First, though, in
the name of suspense, I'll approach your
query in forward gear.
For the clockwise reading of this rock
anthem, the Bug has consulted two
sources and come up with diametrically
opposed conclusions. The first source
is a book called "The Role of Rock"
found at Meyer (where the Bug happily
also discovered that one must now fill
out two of those damned cards to work
at a malfunctioning Macintosh) and the
second, far less sympathetic source is
the lyrics themselves.
"The Role of Rock" authors Don Hib
bard and Carol Kaleialoha unabashedly
make fools of themselves saying "Stair
way to Heaven" "spurned the new in
dustrial state's tunnel vision, but at the
same time resolutely acknowledged the
immutable character of the dominant
fiscal approach to existence." The Bug
concludes from this that Hibby and Miss
Hawaii were unable to find real jobs
and so decided to make their cash by
combining rock music and a thesaurus.
Reading left to right, the no-meaning
argument is easily supported by this
passage: "If there's a bustle in your
hedgerow/Don't be alarmed now./ It's
just a spring clean for the May-queen."
Perhaps the Bug hasn't done enough
drugs, but he doesn't even have a
hedgerow in the third place, nor would
he be alarmed were there to be a bustle
in it, if he did. Clearly, Bob Plante and
Jim Page were just trying to rhyme . . .
or were they?! (distant shriek).
Uncle Arthur always used to mutter
that if the above passage were played
backwards one could hear the following,
"Here's to my sweet Satan, I want a
little power now, I'll reach that first
power in Satan .. . six-six-six." Well,
as usual, Uncle Arthur was right. Stan
fordian and hidden-meaning expert
John Coyle says these words can unde
niably be heard and points to an earlier
clockwise line, "because you know words
have two meanings," as a possible hint
to the song's true contents.
So now you know why the song's had
such a reign of popularity. Mr. Nasty
is behind it, and unless you desire a
career of servitude to him, you'd best
burn those Zeppelin records like so
many witches. Beware, or you may soon
find yourself thrown from the stairway
to heaven onto a dumbwaiter to
Hell!!
Deadly eventualities aside, what this
all means is that Bob knew he had a
great voice and Jim knew he could play
some mean guitar and so together they
formed a sound which needed no real
lyrics.
I could go on, but your class is prob
ably almost over by now. The Bug ad
vises you take the pragmatic tact and
understand that something is the truth
in so far as you believe it to be the truth.
