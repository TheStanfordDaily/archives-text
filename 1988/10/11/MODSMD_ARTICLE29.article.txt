## Card savors victory, sets sights on Sun Devils 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Yesterday was reality day for the Stanford football
team. After a giddy 44-12 demolition of the San
Jose State Spartans Saturday, the Cardinal's
thoughts now turn from their second win of the
season to the prospect of gaining their third.
Stanford definitely played well enough to beat
the Spartans, and improve to 2-3 on the season in
the process, but the team realizes it will need to
continue its improvement to garner its first Pacific
10 Conference victory against Arizona State at Stan
ford Stadium this Saturday.
The Cardinal is 0-2 in the Pac-10, while a 10-0
loss to Washington Saturday dropped ASU to 3-2
overall, 0-1 in league play.
The Stanford defense held the normally potent
San Jose State offense to only 12 points, the Stanford
offense scored 44 points and Stanford's special teams
played their best game of the season. On the down
side, however, the Cardinal committed a Pac-10-
record 19 penalties and had difficulty moving the
ball in the second half.
"Today, (watching the coaches break down the
film) I think about two-thirty, three o'clock I'll
probably think we lost," offensive guard Chuck Gil
lingham said. "What do you think about the
referees? That was a lot of fun, wasn't it?"
Gillingham did admit that despite the sloppiness,
he was very happy to put a capital "W" in the
books. "We're real happy about the win," he said.
"It was really nice to get on 'em early, score a lot
of points on 'em ... kick 'em while they're down ...
especially after they beat us last year."
Stanford Coach Jack El way also saw a lot of
positives on the field. "Our game against San Jose
was one that was real important to us," he said.
"I thought defensively we did an excellent job and
got better as the game went 0n.... And we got the
turnovers.
"Special teams has continued to improve. (John)
Hopkins kicked well ... and our punting improved. ..
Offensively we took advantage of the opportunities
provided us in the first half.... We saw a lot of good
things out there."
Another positive for the Cardinal is the settling
(at least for now) of both the quarterback and the
punting controversies. Redshirt freshman Jason
Palumbis made his first collegiate start at quarter
back a good one, throwing for 222 yards.


Quarterback Jason Palumbis passes to slotback Charlie Young (28) against San Jose State. Palumbis and Young connected on a 49-yard touchdown
pass in the first guarter to put the Cardinal up 21-0.
Although he completed only 13
of 35 passes, he put 38 points on
the board in the first half. He
also threw a 49-yard touchdown
pass to slotback Charlie Young,
Stanford's longest offensive play
of the season.
Sophomore John Hopkins as
sumed the punting role full-time
Saturday and kicked seven times
for a 38.1-yard average. Hopkins
also kicked field goals of 43, 46
and 35 yards before missing a 43-
yarder.
The worst news for Stanford
Saturday was the fact that All-
America candidate Ray Huckes
tein was not able to play a down.
The noseguard is suffering from
a turf toe injury and a chronically
sore back and is listed as probable
for this Saturday's game.
Senior Steve Weber filled in for
Huckestein against the Spartans
and responded by recovering a
fumble to set up Stanford's first
touchdown. Defensive coordinator
Dick Mannini said he has taken
some of the complexities out of
the noseguard position for times
when Huckestein is not in, but
Mannini feels Weber can do the
job.
"1 think we've made some ad
justments without Ray," he said.

"(Weber) was not spectacular but
efficient."
In other news on the iiyury
front, defensive tackle Lester Ar
chambeau reinjured the knee that
has been hurting him the past
three weeks, but he also expects
to play Saturday.
Offensive lineman Jon Sum
mers is not so fortunate. He suf
fered a fractured dislocation to
his right ankle and is lost for the
season.
Card notes
The Arizona State contest Saturday
is alumni day for the truly (fill in the
adjective of your choice) Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching
Band. Approximately 400 former
LSJUMBers are expected to show up
and act anarchistic.
Junior fullback Jon Volpe is cur
rently averaging 95 yards rushing per
game and 4.8 yards per carry. Volpe
also has caught 15 passes for 73 ad
ditional yards.
Despite giving up 42 points a week
ago at Notre Dame, the Stanford de
fense is only allowing 19 points per
game.
Running back Tommy Vardell
made his first appearance Saturday.
The redshirt freshman has recovered
from the broken foot that had kept
him out all year and carried seven
times for 11 yards.
The 11-yard touchdown run by
Scott Eschelman in the first quarter
was the first of the senior's career.

offense scored 44 points and Stanford's special teams
played their best game of the season. On the down
side, however, the Cardinal committed a Pac-10-
record 19 penalties and had difficulty moving the
ball in the second half.
"Today, (watching the coaches break down the
film) I think about two-thirty, three o'clock I'll
probably think we lost," offensive guard Chuck Gil
lingham said. "What do you think about the
referees? That was a lot of fun, wasn't it?"
Gillingham did admit that despite the sloppiness,
he was very happy to put a capital "W" in the
books. "We're real happy about the win," he said.
"It was really nice to get on 'em early, score a lot
of points on 'em ... kick 'em while they're down ...
especially after they beat us last year."
Stanford Coach Jack El way also saw a lot of
positives on the field. "Our game against San Jose
was one that was real important to us," he said.
"I thought defensively we did an excellent job and
got better as the game went 0n.... And we got the
turnovers.
"Special teams has continued to improve. (John)
Hopkins kicked well ... and our punting improved. ..
Offensively we took advantage of the opportunities
provided us in the first half.... We saw a lot of good
things out there."
Another positive for the Cardinal is the settling
(at least for now) of both the quarterback and the
punting controversies. Redshirt freshman Jason
Palumbis made his first collegiate start at quarter
back a good one, throwing for 222 yards.


Quarterback Jason Palumbis passes to slotback Charlie Young (28) against San Jose State. Palumbis and Young connected on a 49-yard touchdown
pass in the first guarter to put the Cardinal up 21-0.
Although he completed only 13
of 35 passes, he put 38 points on
the board in the first half. He
also threw a 49-yard touchdown
pass to slotback Charlie Young,
Stanford's longest offensive play
of the season.
Sophomore John Hopkins as
sumed the punting role full-time
Saturday and kicked seven times
for a 38.1-yard average. Hopkins
also kicked field goals of 43, 46
and 35 yards before missing a 43-
yarder.
The worst news for Stanford
Saturday was the fact that All-
America candidate Ray Huckes
tein was not able to play a down.
The noseguard is suffering from
a turf toe injury and a chronically
sore back and is listed as probable
for this Saturday's game.
Senior Steve Weber filled in for
Huckestein against the Spartans
and responded by recovering a
fumble to set up Stanford's first
touchdown. Defensive coordinator
Dick Mannini said he has taken
some of the complexities out of
the noseguard position for times
when Huckestein is not in, but
Mannini feels Weber can do the
job.
"1 think we've made some ad
justments without Ray," he said.

"(Weber) was not spectacular but
efficient."
In other news on the iiyury
front, defensive tackle Lester Ar
chambeau reinjured the knee that
has been hurting him the past
three weeks, but he also expects
to play Saturday.
Offensive lineman Jon Sum
mers is not so fortunate. He suf
fered a fractured dislocation to
his right ankle and is lost for the
season.
Card notes
The Arizona State contest Saturday
is alumni day for the truly (fill in the
adjective of your choice) Leland Stan
ford Junior University Marching
Band. Approximately 400 former
LSJUMBers are expected to show up
and act anarchistic.
Junior fullback Jon Volpe is cur
rently averaging 95 yards rushing per
game and 4.8 yards per carry. Volpe
also has caught 15 passes for 73 ad
ditional yards.
Despite giving up 42 points a week
ago at Notre Dame, the Stanford de
fense is only allowing 19 points per
game.
Running back Tommy Vardell
made his first appearance Saturday.
The redshirt freshman has recovered
from the broken foot that had kept
him out all year and carried seven
times for 11 yards.
The 11-yard touchdown run by
Scott Eschelman in the first quarter
was the first of the senior's career.
Yesterday was reality day for the Stanford football
team. After a giddy 44-12 demolition of the San
Jose State Spartans Saturday, the Cardinal's
thoughts now turn from their second win of the
season to the prospect of gaining their third.
Stanford definitely played well enough to beat
the Spartans, and improve to 2-3 on the season in
the process, but the team realizes it will need to
continue its improvement to garner its first Pacific
10 Conference victory against Arizona State at Stan
ford Stadium this Saturday.
The Cardinal is 0-2 in the Pac-10, while a 10-0
loss to Washington Saturday dropped ASU to 3-2
overall, 0-1 in league play.
