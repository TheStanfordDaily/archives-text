## Card savors victory, sets sights on Sun Devils 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
Yesterday was reality day for the Stanford football
team. After a giddy 44-12 demolition of the San
Jose State Spartans Saturday, the Cardinal's
thoughts now turn from their second win of the
season to the prospect of gaining their third.
Stanford definitely played well enough to beat
the Spartans, and improve to 2-3 on the season in
the process, but the team realizes it will need to
continue its improvement to garner its first Pacific
10 Conference victory against Arizona State at Stan
ford Stadium this Saturday.
The Cardinal is 0-2 in the Pac-10, while a 10-0
loss to Washington Saturday dropped ASU to 3-2
overall, 0-1 in league play.
The Stanford defense held the normally potent
San Jose State offense to only 12 points, the Stanford
offense scored 44 points and Stanford's special teams
played their best game of the season. On the down
side, however, the Cardinal committed a Pac-10-
record 19 penalties and had difficulty moving the
ball in the second half.
"Today, (watching the coaches break down the
film) I think about two-thirty, three o'clock I'll
probably think we lost," offensive guard Chuck Gil
lingham said. "What do you think about the
referees? That was a lot of fun, wasn't it?"
Gillingham did admit that despite the sloppiness,
he was very happy to put a capital "W" in the
books. "We're real happy about the win," he said.
"It was really nice to get on 'em early, score a lot
of points on 'em ... kick 'em while they're down ...
especially after they beat us last year."
Stanford Coach Jack El way also saw a lot of
positives on the field. "Our game against San Jose
was one that was real important to us," he said.
"I thought defensively we did an excellent job and
got better as the game went 0n.... And we got the
turnovers.
"Special teams has continued to improve. (John)
Hopkins kicked well ... and our punting improved. ..
Offensively we took advantage of the opportunities
provided us in the first half.... We saw a lot of good
things out there."
Another positive for the Cardinal is the settling
(at least for now) of both the quarterback and the
punting controversies. Redshirt freshman Jason
Palumbis made his first collegiate start at quarter
back a good one, throwing for 222 yards.


Quarterback Jason Palumbis passes to slotback Charlie Young (28) against San Jose State. Palumbis and Young connected on a 49-yard touchdown
pass in the first guarter to put the Cardinal up 21-0.
