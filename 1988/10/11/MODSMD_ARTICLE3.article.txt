# Campus groups celebrate first national 'coming out'
## 
### My Chris Shuttlesworth Staff' writer 
Gay, lesbian and bisexual groups will
mark the first National Coming Out Day
today, amidst national concerns that the
event may become too politicized and may
intimidate those not ready to acknowledge
their sexual preferences publicly.
At Stanford, however, organizers have
planned an event they say not only follows
the National Coming Out Day theme of
"Take Your Next Step," but also addresses
the negative concerns raised within gay,
lesbian and bisexual communities.
A noontime picnic in White Plaza
planned by the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center will feature bring-your
own-bag-lunches in an effort to show sup
port for National Coming Out Day.
Organizers expect about 30 people, in
cluding some faculty and staff members,
to attend.
"It's a visible event, but it's also non
political and fun," said graduate student
Andrew Gans, who came up with the idea
of the picnic.
Gans said some "radical events, like a
kiss-in," had been suggested, but organizers
wanted an event in which those not yet
totally comfortable with being gay, lesbian

or bisexual could participate.
"Coming out" is the process of coming
to self-acceptance with being gay "to what
ever extent is comfortable," Gans explained.
"Coming out is a long process, and all
(gay, lesbian and bisexual people) are some
where in it," according to graduate student
Daniel Sternbergh â€” one of the directors
of the Stanford Organization for Lesbian
and Gay Equality.
The goal of the picnic is to be "social,
visible and non-political, with the key ele
ment being the non-political aspect,"
Sternbergh said.
He explained that some members of the
gay community have expressed concern
that the day could be used for political
demonstrations instead of focusing on sup
port for those coming out.
Sternbergh added that other concerns
revolved around holding events that those
coming out would not feel comfortable at
tending, but still feel pressure to attend.
The picnic addresses both of those con
cerns, he said.
"1 would be delighted to have sorfteone
use (the picnic) to make a more visible
step" in the process of coming out,
Sternbergh said, adding that a person
