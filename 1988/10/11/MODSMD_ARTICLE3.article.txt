# Campus groups celebrate first national 'coming out'
## 
### My Chris Shuttlesworth Staff' writer 
Gay, lesbian and bisexual groups will
mark the first National Coming Out Day
today, amidst national concerns that the
event may become too politicized and may
intimidate those not ready to acknowledge
their sexual preferences publicly.
At Stanford, however, organizers have
planned an event they say not only follows
the National Coming Out Day theme of
"Take Your Next Step," but also addresses
the negative concerns raised within gay,
lesbian and bisexual communities.
A noontime picnic in White Plaza
planned by the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual
Community Center will feature bring-your
own-bag-lunches in an effort to show sup
port for National Coming Out Day.
Organizers expect about 30 people, in
cluding some faculty and staff members,
to attend.
"It's a visible event, but it's also non
political and fun," said graduate student
Andrew Gans, who came up with the idea
of the picnic.
Gans said some "radical events, like a
kiss-in," had been suggested, but organizers
wanted an event in which those not yet
totally comfortable with being gay, lesbian

or bisexual could participate.
"Coming out" is the process of coming
to self-acceptance with being gay "to what
ever extent is comfortable," Gans explained.
"Coming out is a long process, and all
(gay, lesbian and bisexual people) are some
where in it," according to graduate student
Daniel Sternbergh â€” one of the directors
of the Stanford Organization for Lesbian
and Gay Equality.
The goal of the picnic is to be "social,
visible and non-political, with the key ele
ment being the non-political aspect,"
Sternbergh said.
He explained that some members of the
gay community have expressed concern
that the day could be used for political
demonstrations instead of focusing on sup
port for those coming out.
Sternbergh added that other concerns
revolved around holding events that those
coming out would not feel comfortable at
tending, but still feel pressure to attend.
The picnic addresses both of those con
cerns, he said.
"1 would be delighted to have sorfteone
use (the picnic) to make a more visible
step" in the process of coming out,
Sternbergh said, adding that a person
would have to be "fairly comfort
able" with being gay to attend the
picnic.
Another student who plans to
attend today's picnic said she felt
the event should be viewed as sym
bolically significant rather than
as a critical part of the coming-out
process.
"It's not what you have to do
to be a good person," said grad
uate student Tigger Newman, who
along with Gans helps coordinate
the the coming-out counseling
group at the Bridge.
Newman added that a year ago
she would not have been comfort
able participating in such a visible
event.
National Coming Out Day
comes exactly one year after the
National March on Washington
for Lesbian and Gay Rights, a
massive political rally held at
Capitol Hill demanding an end to
discrimination against gay, les
bian and bisexual people and an
increase in funding to fight AIDS.

Organizers, however, said they
hope National Coming Out Dav
will stand in contrast to the march
it commemorates.
The event is intended to be "or
dinary, celebratory, a demonstra
tion of us just living our lives,"
Sternbergh said.
Organizers do not anticipate
any problems with the event, al
though Newman conceded that
complications are always "possi
ble."
"You never know where these
[problems] will spring up," New
man said.
"I think there will be more sup
port for the event than there will
be people there."
"Hopefully this will allow
people to be gay by seeing others"
who are openly gay, she added.
"It's so hard when everyone's in
visible."
