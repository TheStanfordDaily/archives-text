NEW YORK vAP) - Rookie
Tim Belcher won his second game
of the playoffs and Kirk Gibson
hit his second straight game
winning homer as Los Angeles
beat the New York Mets 7-4 in
Game 5 yesterday to move within
one game of their first National
League pennant since 1981.
The teams now fly to Los An
geles, where the Dodgers can wrap
up the best-of-seven series Tues
day when former Met Tim Leary
opposes David Cone, the losing
pitcher in Game 2.
During the regular season, the
Mets won 10 of 11 games from
the Dodgers and won 56 games
at home, including their last 11
at Shea Stadium. But the Dodgers
came into New York to win two
of three and take a 3-2 lead.
The Dodgers won Game 4 in
12 innings on Gibson's homer
shortly before 1 a.m. EDT. A little
less than 12 hours later, the two
teams were back on the field for
the fifth game with the series tied
at two games apiece.
The Mets and Dwight Gooden
were three outs away from taking
a 3-1 lead in the series when Mike
Scioscia tied the score \* ith a two
run homer.

Gibson, who ended a l-for-16
slump with his game-winning
homer in Game 4, hit a three-run
shot in the fifth inning for his
second homer in a little over 12
hours.
With two outs in the ninth, Gib
son beat out an infield hit, then
appeared to reinjure his left ham
string stealing second and left the
game. Jose Gonzalez ran for Gib
son and scored the Dodgers'
seventh run when Mike Marshall
tripled to right-center.
In all five games, the Dodgers
have scored first, this time break
ing through for three runs off
loser Sid Fernandez in the fourth
inning on 39-year-old Rick
Dempsey's two-run double and an
RBI double by Alfredo Griffin.
Belcher, who won Game 2, set
down nine straight before Len
Dykstra led off with a walk in the
fourth and Gregg Jefferies sin

gled.
Belcher, who won nine of his
last 11 decisions, allowed seven
hits and struck out six as he be
came the first rookie to win two
games in the playoffs since the
format was adopted in 1969.
In Game 2, Belcher allowed five
hits in eight and one-third innings
as the Dodgers beat the Mets 6-3.
Marshall led off the fourth with
a single and, after a walk to John
Shelby, Dempsey doubled down
the left-field line on a high fast
ball.
Dempsey was signed as a non
roster player last spring by the
Dodgers after hitting .177 for
Cleveland in 1987. He missed the
last half of 1987 after suffering
a broken thumb in a collision at
home plate with Kansas City's Bo
Jackson.
As a catcher for Baltimore in
1983, Dempsey was the World Se

ries MVP and is 20-for-61 in 21
postseason games.
Griffin, a .167 batter hitting
right-handed, followed Dempsey's
hit with a double to left-center
field.
Steve Sax led off the fifth with
a single and moved to third on
Mickey Hatcher's hit-and-run
single to right field. Gibson, who
led the Dodgers with 25 home
runs, then hit a drive into the
right-field seats to chase Fernan
dez.
Fernandez, who won his last six
games to finish 12-10, allowed
seven hits and six runs in five-plus
innings. During the season, he
was 8-4 at home with a 1.83
earned-run average.
Fernandez was given a start in
the playoffs because of an injury
to Bob Ojeda, whose left middle
finger was almost severed in a
gardening accident 10 days before
the end of the season.
The Mets got back in the game
in the fifth when Howard Johnson
led off with a single to snap an
0-for-14 streak in this series and
an 0-for-22 slump in postseason
competition. The slump tied
