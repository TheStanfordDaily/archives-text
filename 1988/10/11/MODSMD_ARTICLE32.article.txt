Soon to be seen in doctors' and dentists'

Highlights™ magazine: "Goofus And Gallant
Show Us How To Be A Good Baseball Fan."

Goofus only watches baseball during the
World Series, and only so he can check out
So-and-So's lovely wife in the stands.

Gallant is glued, even velcroed, to television,
radio, ballpark seat and sports section from
the opening day of spring training, and knows
that So-and-So's lovely wife will leave him
after he strikes out on a pitch in the dirt.
Goofus sees a relief pitcher with a 1.02 ERA
put in the game by a manager who won 110
games give up a game-winning home run, and
mutters, "What a worthless reliever. And that
manager might as well be fish'n'."
Gallant, who framed the reliever's baseball
card last week, knows that if he hadn't for
gotten to knock on wood, the ball would have
been caught at the wall. He also realizes that
Goofus' third cousin, the General Manager,
will in fact fire the aforementioned manager
next August.

Goofus, of course, likes the wave. He also
shrieks "I got it!" every time a foul ball is
hit in the stands, no matter where.
Gallant, by all means, has outgrown the
wave. Unfortunately, he has never quite re
covered from the time the taller Goofus out
reached him for the one foul ball hit their way.
Goofus yells "Balk!" every time a pitcher
fakes a pickofT throw when he's off the rubber.
Gallant, an earnest but quixotic sort, knows
nothing else about the balk rule except that
such a move is legal, and only wishes that
one time he would see it succeed.
Goofus jumped on the Giants' bandwagon
in late 1987, and quietly tumbled off it in
late 1988.
Gallant was an enlightened and pure soul
all along.

It's the bottom of the ninth. The Home
Team is trailing the Visiting Team 6-5. Home
led 5-0, only to see Visiting scramble for six
runs in the top of the ninth on a single, two
hit batsmen, and four errors including a
catcher's interference.
Up in the stands, Goofus and Gallant have
stayed for the bitter end (Gallant drove). And
bitter it looks like it will be, as the first batter
for Home meagerly grounds out.
Goofus looks at the players in the Home
dugout and asks, "Why are they wearing their
caps inside out?"
Gallant looks silently at Goofus and shakes
his head. In his stomach, however, hostility
begins to grow.
The next batter for the Home nine quickly
mimics the actions of the first. Depression
mixes with the anger in Gallant's gut and
starts to fester like an untreated cancer.

Gallant is two solid weeks
behind in his work and
will flunk out of school if
the Dodgers make the
World Series.

But lo! A triple! There may be joy in Mud
ville after all. Gallant leaps to his feet with
hope.
A pinch hitter, Blueberry (Blue) Mel
lowsmith, is announced. He ambles up to the
plate, taps some dirt off his cleats into the
air and pings it with a spit of tobacco juice.
A loud crescendo builds among the remaining
ballpark patrons.
Goofus asks, "Why are they booing?"
Gallant hits Goofus in the face.
• • •
One final lesson.
This may be surprising to you, but Goofus
attends his classes almost without fail, and
started to do homework well before last week
end.
Gallant, who missed the first week of classes
altogether, ditched again Monday morning and
watched the Dodgers cling to a 7-4 win over
the Mets to take a 3-2 lead in the National
league Championship Series.
Gallant is also two solid weeks behind in
his work and will flunk out of school if the
Dodgers make the World Series.
But I did vacuum my room during the sixth
inning. I bet Goofus never vacuums his room.

World Series.

But lo! A triple! There may be joy in Mud
ville after all. Gallant leaps to his feet with
hope.
A pinch hitter, Blueberry (Blue) Mel
lowsmith, is announced. He ambles up to the
plate, taps some dirt off his cleats into the
air and pings it with a spit of tobacco juice.
A loud crescendo builds among the remaining
ballpark patrons.
Goofus asks, "Why are they booing?"
Gallant hits Goofus in the face.

One final lesson.
This may be surprising to you, but Goofus
attends his classes almost without fail, and
started to do homework well before last week
end.
Gallant, who missed the first week of classes
altogether, ditched again Monday morning and
watched the Dodgers cling to a 7-4 win over
the Mets to take a 3-2 lead in the National
league Championship Series.
Gallant is also two solid weeks behind in
his work and will flunk out of school if the
Dodgers make the World Series.
But I did vacuum my room during the sixth
inning. I bet Goofus never vacuums his room.
