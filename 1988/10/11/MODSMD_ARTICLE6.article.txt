Rivers, who was 26, was from

The badly decomposed body was
discovered by the apartment man

an odor coming from Rivers'
apartment, according to Sgt.

Rivers had been dead about 10
days.
There was no indication of foul

found, Bertuccelli said. But he
refused to rule out any cause of
death pending completion of a
report by the Santa Clara County
Coroner's Office. The coroner was
unavailable for comment last
night.

as a shock to everybody in the
Law School community that a stu
