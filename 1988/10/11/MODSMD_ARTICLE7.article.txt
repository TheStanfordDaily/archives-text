# From no kegs to monitors
## Other colleges have tighter regulations on alcohol, parties 
### Jill Daniels 
While Stanford officials are
looking into decreasing University
regulation of student consump
tion, Stanford's policy already
reflects a more liberal approach
to alcohol than do the policies of
other universities.
Tomorrow, the Student Con
duct Legislative Council will meet
to discuss adopting a revised al
cohol policy, designed by Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson.
Currently, the policy allows al
cohol on campus but reminds stu
dents to uphold state laws and
forbids minors from consuming
alcohol. Under the revised policy,
however, underage drinking
would not be a violation of Uni
versity rules.
Denounced as too liberal by
some and too conservative by
others, Stanford's current alcohol
policy tends to be less regulatory
than the practices at most other
universities.
For instance, before students at
Harvard University can hold a
public party (with 30 people or
more) they must receive permis
sion from the Cambridge License
Committee and from the dean of
students.

In addition, a graduate student
must be present at parties to check
identification.
"God awful" and "pretty damn
lousy" are phrases one student
used to describe the alcohol policy
at Harvard. Just this year, kegs
were banned from the freshman
quad.
According to Martha Bridegam,
co-managing editor of The Har
vard Crimson, a student newspa
per there, keg parties still exist
among the freshmen.
While students at Harvard need

to obtain a license for public par
ties, the alcohol policy is even
more stringent at the University
of Virginia.
According to Dean of Students
Robert Canevari, no alcohol can
be served when people under 21
are present.
This past year, as a result of
an appointed task force's recom
mendation, the policy was
modified, allowing students under
21 to attend a few university func
tions where alcohol is typically
present.
Underage students may be pres
ent at Pavilion 11, the student
union pub, and "at traditional
events such as faculty/student get
togethers and Casino Night, "
Canevari said.
Meanwhile, problems with off
campus fraternities at UVA have
caused a large number of arrests.
"We don't control fraternities.
People say we're so tight we drive
problems off campus, but I don't
think that's fair," Canevari said
in reference to the school's prob

lem with off-campus drinking.
UCLA and UC-Berkeley avoid
the underage conflict by simply
banning all alcohol from campus.
At Princeton University, Wendy
Bower, an editor at The Prin
cetonian, said university officals
are cracking down on underage
drinking.
"Last year 35 students were ad
mitted to the infirmary for in
toxication," Bower said. "Two of
the eating clubs served shots and
Kamikazes" resulting in "a stu
dent -in a coma for 40 seconds,"
She noted.
Consequently, Princeton's alco
hol policy was revised. Now, if a
proctor spots a minor being served
alcohol, the server will be reported
and charged with a violation of

university policy.
Boston University is also crack
ing down with a "no-nonsense"
policy. Measures include prohibit
ing guests in dorms after 11 p.m.
and forbidding legal-aged students
from bringing in more than a six
pack of beer.
Other schools, such as Cornell
University, are following Stan
ford's direction by having a more
liberal policy that recognizes the
difficulty of outlawing drinking.
"Alcohol is allowed," stated As
st. Dean of Students Neff
Casaburi.
"To think you can stop alcohol
is not particularly realistic," he
said. "Use events to educate
people â€” That's the way to go."
