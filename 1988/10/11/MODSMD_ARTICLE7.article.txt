# From no kegs to monitors
## Other colleges have tighter regulations on alcohol, parties

While Stanford officials are
looking into decreasing University
regulation of student consump
tion, Stanford's policy already
reflects a more liberal approach
to alcohol than do the policies of
other universities.
Tomorrow, the Student Con

to discuss adopting a revised al
cohol policy, designed by Assoc.
Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson.

students.

In addition, a graduate student
must be present at parties to check

at Harvard. Just this year, kegs
were banned from the freshman

co-managing editor of The Har

more stringent at the University
of Virginia.
According to Dean of Students
Robert Canevari, no alcohol can
be served when people under 21
are present.
This past year, as a result of
an appointed task force's recom
mendation, the policy was
modified, allowing students under
21 to attend a few university func
