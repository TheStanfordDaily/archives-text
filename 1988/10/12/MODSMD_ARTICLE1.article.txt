## Engineering building shut down 
### Nathanael Cousins 
Following a nitric acid spill and explosion yester
day, students and faculty evacuated the Thomas F.
Peterson Materials Science and Engineering Build
ing.
No one was injured in the explosion, which oc
curred at approximately 1:17 p.m. in room 552 C of
the graduate engineering building. After everyone
had evacuated, the building was chained shut.
Although classes were promptly canceled yester
day, Douglas Brown, associate director of University
Occupational Health and Safety, predicted that
Peterson would be open for classes today while
552 C would remain closed another day or two for
a complete clean-up.
Students in Peterson said they heard the explosion
and evacuated, some leaving books, labs and keys
behind.
"I heard a big pow," said Peter Balkovich, a lab
technician who was working across the hall from
room 552 C. "Right away I ran into the room and
saw brown fumes."
First year graduate student Gail Ball said, "We
heard a big boom and evacuated. Bright yellow
orange fumes were coming out the door."
Ball, who was next door in an experimental ma
terials science class during the explosion, said her
class had been working in room 552 C just five
