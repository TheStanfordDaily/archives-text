# Explosion and spill force evacuation
## Engineering building shut down 
### Nathanael Cousins 
Following a nitric acid spill and explosion yester
day, students and faculty evacuated the Thomas F.
Peterson Materials Science and Engineering Build
ing.
No one was injured in the explosion, which oc
curred at approximately 1:17 p.m. in room 552 C of
the graduate engineering building. After everyone
had evacuated, the building was chained shut.
Although classes were promptly canceled yester
day, Douglas Brown, associate director of University
Occupational Health and Safety, predicted that
Peterson would be open for classes today while
552 C would remain closed another day or two for
a complete clean-up.
Students in Peterson said they heard the explosion
and evacuated, some leaving books, labs and keys
behind.
"I heard a big pow," said Peter Balkovich, a lab
technician who was working across the hall from
room 552 C. "Right away I ran into the room and
saw brown fumes."
First year graduate student Gail Ball said, "We
heard a big boom and evacuated. Bright yellow
orange fumes were coming out the door."
Ball, who was next door in an experimental ma
terials science class during the explosion, said her
class had been working in room 552 C just five

. minutes before the explosion, add
ing that their work did not involve
nitric acid.
Ball said she had seen nobody
in room 552 C 30 seconds before
the explosion.
"I don't understand how there
was an explosion," said Balkovich.
"Nitric acid doesn't blow up by
itself. Someone must have messed
up and mixed the wrong chemicals
for this to happen, (but) to my
knowldege, there had been nobody
in the room."
While scientists and University
officials at the building could not
identify what caused the explo
sion, they agreed that nitric acid
was involved.
When Balkovich entered room
552 C immediately after hearing
the explosion, he said he saw

fumes coming out of a metal
cabinet which stores one-liter
bottles of nitric, phosphoric and
sulfuric acids.
"There was also glass on the
floor and splashed liquid," he said.
Although the lab has two chemi
cal exhaust hoods, Balkovich said
he did not know if they were
turned on.
Balkovich said the lab had
passed a required safety program
within the past two months,
which included an inventory of
lab chemicals and a review of
safety procedures.
"The worst thing that could
have happened to anyone would
have been a splash of acid," he
said.
After emergency services se
cured the area, Stephen Derman
of University Health and Safety
performed chemical tests inside
the building to assess the damage.
According to Derman, the hall
outside room 552 C and the rest

of the building was free of nitric
acid.
But he said nitric acid might
be escaping through a false ceiling
into an attic.
According to Balkovich, nitric
acid is dangerous, but stray
vapors are not particularly harm
ful.
Fans in the roof, which could
remove the nitric acid vapors from
room 552 C more quickly, were not
in operation at the time of the
accident, Derman said.
The Palo Alto Fire Department,
Stanford Emergency Response
Team, Stanford Hazardous Safety
Division, Santa Clara Hazardous
Materials Team and the Stanford
Sheriffs Department responded
to the emergency.
Frank Jurian, assistant director
of University Public Safety, said
he has recommended more tests
to determine whether or not stu
dents may return to the building
today.
