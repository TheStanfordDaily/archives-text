Kennedy against 102
In a personal statement issued
yesterday, University President
Donald Kennedy expressed his
opposition to Proposition 102,
the AIDS initiative proposed by
Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-
Calif.
The proposal would require
doctors and researchers to
report everyone "suspected" of
being HIV-positive (infected
with the AIDS virus) to local
health authorities.
It would forbid confidential
anonymous AIDS testing, allow
insurance companies and em
ployers to require HIV testing
and require that anyone known
or "reasonably believed" to be
HIV-positive to divulge a list of
intimate partners for contact
tracing by public health offi
cials.
A former commissioner of the
U.S. Food and Drug Adminis
tration, Kennedy said Prop. 102
"is defective as a public health
measure."
"Worst still, it invites
mistrust and encourages eva
sion of the very real problems
we face."
All states currently require
diagnosed AIDS cases to be re
ported to state and federal
health agencies, according to
The Wall Street Journal. But
only a quarter of the states ask
doctors to report to health au
thorities when patients test pos

itive for AIDS antibodies. /
Prop. 102 also has been op
posed by the president of the
California Medical Association,
the California Nurses Associa
tion, the California Chamber of
Commerce, the American Civil
Liberties Union, AT&T, Apple
Computer, Pacific Gas and
Electric and Levi Strauss,
among others.
University of California
economists Robert Anderson
and John Quigley have esti
mated enforcement costs for
Prop 102 at more than $1.7 bil
lion annually, more than twice
the state's current expenditures
against AIDS.
Physicians have warned that
its adoption could drive AIDS
patients underground, dis
couraging their participation in
research, and destroy blood
banking through fear of expo
sure.
Dannemeyer argues that "we
citizens have rights, but we also
have a duty to know our own
status and to avoid transferring
a disease to another human
being," reported The Journal.
Kennedy's views were ex
pressed in response to questions
from The Ad Hoc No on 102
Committee at Stanford. The
committee is headed by Phil
Fernandez, director of data and
technology resources, and
Howard Snortland, graduate
student in applied physics.

Hoover fellow joins
federal commission
John Cogan, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, has
