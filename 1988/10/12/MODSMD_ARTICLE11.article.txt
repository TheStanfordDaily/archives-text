## Protestors shut down FDA office 
### 
ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -
Hundreds of demonstrators, de
manding easier access to experi
mental drugs for people with
AIDS, blocked entrances to the
Food and Drug Administration's
headquarters yesterday, prompt
ing police to close the building to
arriving employees.
Vito Russo, a New York writer
who said he was diagnosed with
AIDS in 1985, said the demon
strators did not want the FDA to
stop testing drugs, but to move
faster and make AIDS drugs avail
able as soon as it is determined
they are safe — rather than
waiting to judge their effective
ness as well.
"The side effect of AIDS is
death," Russo said.
Montgomery County police,
some of them wearing clear plastic
surgical gloves, arrested and
charged 175 demonstrators with
loitering for blocking entrances.
Most of the arrested protesters
elected to walk to the waiting
police buses, where they were
handcuffed with plastic ties. A few
chose to be dragged and were ac
commodated by pairs of officers.
Police said all those arrested were
later released and would be sched
uled to appear in court at a later
date.
Four men climbed atop two of
the buses and huddled under
blankets whipped by a chilly wind.
Police made no attempt to remove
them until they got ready to move
the buses. When the men refused
to get off the rooftops, they were
handcuffed and dropped through
hinged skylights into the compart
ments below — to cheers and
laughter from their watching

compatriots.
At least two glass door panels
were broken during jostling be
tween surging crowds and police
during the early minutes of the
demonstration.
Police allowed demonstrators
wearing armbands designating
them as medical personnel to go
onto the buses to check on those

already handcuffed and arrested,
some of whom wore lettered shirts
saying they had AIDS.
A woman police officer carrying
two cups of coffee walked past
some of the protesters and was
jokingly offered $5 for one of the
coffees. "How's this?" she said,
giving away one of the cups with
out breaking stride.
