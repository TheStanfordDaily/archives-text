U.S. may make deal with Marcos
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. authorities may
offer Ferdinand Marcos a promise he will not go
to prison if he pleads guilty and forfeits money
he allegedly stole from the Philippine Treasury
when he was that country's president, government
sources said yesterday.
The possibility of making the offer to Marcos,
who has not been indicted, was discussed last
week at a meeting between the State Depart
ment's chief legal counsel, Abraham Sofaer, and
an aide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
The sources supplied the information following
a story in the Los Angeles Times, which had
obtained a State Department cable relayed from
Sofaer to other department officials following last
week's meeting between Sofaer and Thornburgh
aide Robin Ross.
The discussions between the state and justice
departments revolve around a criminal investi
gation of Marcos by U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani in Manhattan.
The White House said the National Security
Council staff has informally reviewed information
from the Justice Department outlining a proposed
fraud case against Marcos.

Rut White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Tuesday that the matter "hasn't come to
the president yet."
"The Justice Department is considering
whether to bring it before a grand jury,"
Fitzwater said. "They have given us information
on the case."
Czech leaders oppose reforms
PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) — The Com
munist Party leadership made changes at the
top of the party and government yesterday in a
meeting that also expressed clear opposition to
sweeping economic or political reform.
Ladislav Adamec, 62-year-old premier of the
Czech lands, was chosen as new federal premier
to replace Lubomir Strougal, who resigned Mon
day after more than 18 years in the job and gave
up his seat on the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo.
The changes were made at a two-day meeting
of the party Central Committee session, which
ended yesterday, and were announced at a news
conference by Jan Fojtik, the new party ideologist.
He also said five men were made full members
of the Politburo, increasing the membership from
12 to 15.
