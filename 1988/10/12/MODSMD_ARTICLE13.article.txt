# Money-launderers indicted
## Drug bank closure redefines 'hostile takeover' 
### 
TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - A bank
holding company with branches
in 72 countries was indicted yes
terday in what federal agents de
scribed as the first drug-related
money-laundering case involving
a global banking institution.
William Von Raab, head of the
U.S. Customs Service, called it
the "first corporate raid," adding
"we have given new meaning to
the term 'hostile takeover.'"
"For some international banks,
their sleaze factor is higher than
their interest rates. That's what
we're talking about here, just
pure greed," he said.
In a two-year undercover sting
dubbed "Operation C Chase,"
from the C in C-note or a $100

bill, Customs agents were able to
infiltrate powerful Colombian
money-laundering syndicates and
help launder an estimated $32
million in drug proceeds, federal
authorities said.
The money was intended prin
cipally for Colombian drug traf
fickers, including the Medellin
Cartel, Customs said.
Indictments unsealed yesterday
named nine banking officials
along with a Luxembourg-based
bank holding company, BCCI
Holdings, as well as two sub
sidiaries, Bank of Credit and Com
merce International S.A., which
has operations in the United
States and England, and Bank of
Credit and Commerce Interna

tional (Overseas) Limited, organ
ized in the Cayman Islands and
operating in France, the Republic
of Panama, Colombia, Bahamas
and the United States.
In addition to the indictments,
the government filed civil com
plaints seeking forfeiture of indi
viduals' property and funds as al
legedly representing drug profits,
and it also seeks forfeiture of
BCCI assets.
A federal judge late yesterday
lifted a restraining order that had
been issued against the bank and
allowed the bank to resume nor
mal business after BCCI put into
escrow $14 million, the amount
the government alleged the bank
had laundered.
