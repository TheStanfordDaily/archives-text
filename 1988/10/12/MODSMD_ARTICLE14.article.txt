# New safety standards set for U.S. nuclear weapons reactors

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Seeking to "rectify past sins" in
the operation of weapons reactors,
Energy Department officials yes
terday announced new safety pro
cedures that they said would delay
the reopening of the Savannah
River Plant but would not jeopar
dize the nation's nuclear deter
rent.
Energy Secretary John Her
rington told a news conference
that the department "will not op
erate unsafe reactors. We will
meet the defense needs of this
country in a safe manner and an
environmentally sensitive man
ner."
"We are about to embark on a
program to restart, to move back

to a safe operating level, those
reactors ... at the end of the year,"
he said.
Department officials had
planned to restart one of three
reactors at Savannah River as
early as November, but now plan
to begin a four-week "phased res
tart" that will begin in December,
said Herrington's deputy, Joseph
Salgado.
Salgado sought to calm fears
about possible shortages of the
nuclear weapons material
produced at Savannah River, es
pecially of tritium, which decays
more quickly than plutonium, the
other fuel produced there.
"We are comfortable that
Savannah River will operate at a

sufficient level to meet the tritium
needs of the future," Salgado told
reporters.
The news conference was called
to defuse criticism of the Energy
Department not only over the
Savannah River Plant, located in
Aiken, S.C., but also over radio
active contamination at another
facility in Rocky Flats, Colo., and
over allegedly lax security at
weapons laboratories in New
Mexico and California.
As part of the campaign, said
Salgado, inspectors reviewed all
nuclear weapons facilities and cal
culated what it would cost to im
prove them, or if needed, clean
them up.
