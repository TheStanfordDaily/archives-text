## ID cards overdue 
### 
Universal Stanford ID
cards are a great idea
whose time has come

UNIVERSAL ID CARDS are
coming — but not soon
enough.
After years of lobbying by
leaders in the ASSU, the Univer
sity has finally agreed to produce
a universal identification card that
will be used for many purposes,
combining the functions of the
meal card and the traditional iden
tification card.
While this step ought to be ap
plauded, Stanford will not issue
the new cards until at least 1991
— when most of the current stu
dent population will have graduat
ed.
Granted, the University wants
to make sure that the transition
to a universal ID card is smooth
and that the system is imple
mented correctly.
However, a three year delay
seems excessive. Can't the cards
be produced now and then incor
porated into the library computer
systems later?
Yale University has had a uni
versal card since 1975. Northwest
ern University has had a card that
coordinates information with the
school's library computer system
since 1982. For the past 10 years,
Cornell University has had a card
that works as a credit card and a
student ID.
Here at Stanford, a universal
identificatiion card would make life
easier for both students and staff.

With a picture ID card, the Uni
versity will be better able to control
access to the libraries as well as
to computer clusters and other
campus facilities. The Athletic De
partment could ensure that student
tickets are sold only to registered
students.
No longer will the tradition of
sharing the brown-papered card
endure.
Moreover, a universal identifica
tion card will end some of the
hassles students now go through.
They will only have to safeguard
one card, instead of two. Also, the
implementation of a universal ID
card through the NOTIS and
RECON programs will facilitate
easier access to Stanford's library
as book loans will no longer require
extensive paperwork for both the
staff and students.
The painstaking process of fill
ing out forms for each library
check out will cease. Instead, stu
dents will be able to take out books
in almost no time by running the
magnetic strip of the card through
a machine. And eventually, the card
could serve as a credit card at the
Bookstore and Tresidder Union.
If the card were incorporated
into a system which bills students
only for the University services
that they take advantage of, many
will save money. For instance, stu
dents who only eat seven meals a
week will no longer have to pay
for all 19.
Again, the University deserves
the thumbs up for its efforts to
implement a universal ID card. But
students would like to see the cards
come sooner.
The sooner, the better.
