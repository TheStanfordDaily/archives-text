## University can not deny fraternities' right to exist 
### 
Assistant dean of student
Affairs and Fraternal Affairs
Adviser Joe Pisano has gone on
public record with his challenge to
fraternities to "be good or be gone."
Being a member of a fraternity, I am
forced to consider whether my housing
is in jeopardy.
It took only nine months on campus
for me to realize that there is a large
fraction of the community that would
like to see a fading of the Greek sys
tem at Stanford. Their reasons are
varied and by no means groundless.
However, my decision of whether or
not to pledge a fraternity was not

affected by this public opinion simply
because it would not jeopardize my
living arrangements, as long as the
University honored the fraternity's
right to exist.
Therefore, my fraternity would be
most jeopardized if the administration
decided to pursue a course of action
that reflected the opinion of the afore
mentioned group of people. Not a silly
supposition, considering Pisano's re
marks in the Daily of Oct. 10.
Test this hypothesis with a mental
exercise. If key figures in the Univer
sity administration wanted to actively
pursue an anti-fraternity policy, how

would they go about it?
The task would be to make it diffi
cult for fraternities to reach their
quotas, or the minimum number of
pledges required to keep the fraterni
ties active. Feasible strategies include:
• Increase financial burdens: Charge
unwanted houses with incidental clean
ing and maintenance fees. Such costs
are usually evenly distributed within a
house, hitting everyone with a large
penalty.
• Over-enforcement of a disciplinary
policy: Shut down the parties.
Demoralize the residents.
Let me say that I do not accuse nor

do I assume that Pisano or anybody
else is pursuing such a policy. I am not
seeking nor do I have evidence or
proof of conspiracy.
My only real course of action is to
rise to Pisano's challenge to "be good
or be gone."
I do not speak for any fraternity
member but myself when I accept this
challenge. But, in doing so, let me
issue a challenge of my own, to the
University administration: "Be fair or
be damned."
