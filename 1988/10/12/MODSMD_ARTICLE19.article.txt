# Picture of pro-life demonstrator didn't tell the whole story
## 
### 
I have been a graduate student and
diligent reader of the Daily for many
years-soon I should qualify for
honorary membership of Stanford Stu
, dents for Life.
In those years there have been many
articles, published in the Daily, con
cerning animal rights and exposition of
wantonly neglectful animal research.
Flipping through the pages of last
Wednesday's Daily I was dismayed not
to find an article accompanying the
photo of the grimacing anti-abortion
demonstrator who was obviously in
pain.
I do not like these pictures, just as I
dislike pictures of cruel experimenta
tion on animals which is always unjus
tifiable. What he allegedly did wrong
the caption does not say. What were
360 people doing protesting in Atlanta
against abortion?

In the Bay Area in recent months
close to five hundred people were ar
rested on three separate occasions for
civil disobedience in the vicinity of
abortion clinics, and untold numbers of
others were present to offer alterna
tives and services to clients.
I have been told, although I did not
participate, that it has universally been
a very orderly civil disobedience and all
participators are advised beforehand,
and almost all exclusively comply, not
to resist arrest, to go body-limp, and
to walk into the paddy-wagon, other
wise bodily injury can ensue.
Fortunately, the American public are
already keenly aware of the plight of
expectant mothers, who find them
selves in dire financial and medical
straits, who feel they have to resort to
abortion to resolve their difficulties.
However, these demonstrations are
part of a nationwide effort called Oper
ation Rescue which both provides aid
and services for these women and also
has the aim of making the American
people aware of one of the most cruel
and painful human death penalties:
Death by surgical abortion.
It has been asked why this compliant

civil disobedience did not occur in
1973.
It may be because a significant
amount of trust had been put in the
justice meted out by the Supreme
Court and now, because of the inaction
of said court, bearing the case of the
civil rights movement in the sixties in
mind, it is believed that a general
swelling of the ranks at grassroots
level will be necessary to achieve civil
rights for the unborn, women as well
as men.
