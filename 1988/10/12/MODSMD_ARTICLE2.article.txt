# Trustees divest from ninth firm
## 
### Eric Young Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
decided yesterday that the University
will divest of nearly $700,000 of stock
in the Tenneco, a diversified industrial
company.
After verifying that the firm's South
African subsidiary sells machinery to
the South African military, the Special
Committee on Investment Responsibil
ity asked Tenneco to end such sales or
sell its subsidiary in South Africa.
When Tenneco refused, the SCIR rec
ommended to the trustees yesterday
that the University divest of the 13,800
shares it holds in the firm.
According to SCIR chair Ted Mitchell,
"the decision to divest took about four
seconds" when the trustees realized that
communication with Tenneco had failed

When Tenneco refused,
the SCIR recommended
to the trustees yesterday
that the University divest
of the 13,800 shares it
holds in the firm.

to convince the firm to change its sales
policy.
It was only after continued inquiries
by the University that Tenneco finally
acknowledged that its subsidary, J. I.
Case, was selling tractors and construc
tion equipment to the South African
military.
The trustees have not yet notified
Tenneco of their decision.

Mitchell said he plans to send Tenneco
a letter which will explain the trustees'
decision and will ask for the company's
reaction. However, he said he does not
expect to get a reply.
Mitchell said Stanford takes such di
vestment decisions only as a last resort.
He added that the recommendation to
divest comes after many attempts to
persuade the firm to cease its dealings
in South Africa.
Divestment "does not send a mes
sage," Mitchell said. "It is a statement
of failure — failure to convince a com
pany, in this case Tenneco, to take a
strong and decisive act to combat apart
heid."
Stanford — under its selective divest
ment policy — has divested from eight
other firms. The most recent divestment
came in May when the University sold
its holdings in Ingersoll-Rand.
