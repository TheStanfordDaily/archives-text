Selfish self-interest is what is plagu
ing the Stanford community and
making life miserable for management
and labor.
People are having the wrong self-

interest without anyone distinguishing
for them the difference between an
"unhealthy" self-interest and a
"healthy" self-interest.
The Stanford image is being dis
torted because of a "diseased" self
interest. But society is promoted, ad
vanced, and made prosperous and
strong only because of a healthy self
interest.
Furthermore, workers are to be com
mended every day, and not just on a
special day called "Labor Day."
Gratitude should be shown by those
benefitting from the work of the
workers in the form of compensation.
Relief from necessity and hardship
or strained circumstances is another
form of compensation.
It is an everyday person who gives a
full day's work for a full day's pay. He
or she works for the sake of being
honest and for the love of accomplish
ment — though his or her work may
appear small in the total picture.
What is missing isn't monetary, but
the spirit of having mutual considera
tion for the needs of the workers.
