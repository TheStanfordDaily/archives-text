## Apathy robs us of light 
### 
I DON'T KNOW if anyone will re
member this, but two years ago some
one ran for the ASSU Senate as Peter
"I Wanted Lighted Tennis Courts"
Nadan. As far as I knew, this was his
entire platform. So I voted for him.
He hit exactly the right issue with me,
and I'm sure a lot of other people. As a
freshman, I was shocked by the lack of
this seemingly very essential facility (even
my junior high school had lighted tennis
courts). I don't know, but to me, lighted
tennis courts were very basic, and for
this University to not have them was
incomprehensible. I knew for a fact that
a lot of people on campus play tennis.
Hey, next to bowling, I can't think of a
more popular sport on this campus. Ex
cept maybe jogging, and that's not a
sport. Come to think of it, neither is
bowkng.
Sff? the number one sport on this
campus was being denied to every self
respecting, hard-working member of the
Stanford community after the hours of
dusk because someone didn't have the
decency to provide artificial lighting.
By winter quarter freshman year, the
anger had faded into sarcasm and bad
jokes with fellow disgruntled students.
"Wanna play after dinner tonight?" I
would ask. "Sure. You bring the tiki
torches, and I'll get my flint," my friends
would say. Then, we would go to our
rooms, grab our rackets, and come out
to start volleying down the long expanse
of a well-lit Gavilan hallway. This amused
us, this last-ditch resort, but underneath
this jovial veneer seethed a bitterness
and despair.

So it is easy to understand why Peter
Nadan became our messiah, the man who
would lead us out of Darkness.
Sophomore year came. And then there
was ... no light. The year was passing
quickly. Failure. Dejection.
By this time, though, I had noticed
that tennis was not the only neglected
sport. That, in fact, there weren't any
outdoor sporting facilities with lights at
all. I was a mature sophomore, I could
rationalize this situation. I thought. . . .
Maybe it was the money. This thought
did not last long.
Maybe there were aesthetic considera
tions. I knew that all the buildings had
to be earth tone and carry red-tiled roofs.
Maybe harsh, institutional outdoor lights
would wreck the serene Moorish beauty
of the campus.
Maybe it was some kind of technicality.
This idea began to take hold of my im
agination. I could see some past Stanford
president receiving an endowment from
a crusty eccentric. "I'll give you these
many million dollars," the tycoon said in
a craggly voice, between coughs and
wheezes, "but you have to swear not to
hoist any of them damned lights. Young
whippersnappers have to study at night.
None of that funnin' and merriment stuff
and nonsense!" This explanation quelled
my emotions for the year. Whenever I
would trek over to the courts, eager to
hit some balls, only to find the sign-up
booked solid until dusk, I would think of
that old man spitting out at me: "Stuff
and nonsense!"
It is today and I am a junior and less
jaded than before. I no longer have to

think up excuses for this University's
shortcomings, because I realize they are
quite prone to making mistakes. Whereas
in the past, I would have tried to peg a
scapegoat for this injustice, whether it
be money or aesthetics or rich alumni or
criminal neglect, now I'm satisfied to
simply dismiss the incident as another
failure of a very large and very imperfect
machine. Bureaucracy. Red tape.
This evolution from anger to com
placency that I have gone through over
the past three years, this loss of in
nocence, is sad in a way. It marks a point
in my life that I don't find particularly
appealing — the transition into the
numbed state of adulthood. I used to
attribute a lot of the world's ills to numb
ness. I guess I still do.
When I was younger, I remember losing
countless arguments to my parents about
things even more trivial than lighted ten
nis courts, and the only reason was be
cause they were right and they said so.
Those were frustrating times. A
crime was being committed and my par
ents had complete impunity. In
retrospect, I see they weren't trying to
be mean. They probably just expected
me to dismiss their answer as they would
have. But I hated that answer then.
But now it's just a "fact of life."

I DON'T KNOW if anyone will re
member this, but two years ago some
one ran for the ASSU Senate as Peter
"I Wanted Lighted Tennis Courts"
Nadan. As far as I knew, this was his
entire platform. So I voted for him.
He hit exactly the right issue with me,
and I'm sure a lot of other people. As a
freshman, I was shocked by the lack of
this seemingly very essential facility (even
my junior high school had lighted tennis
courts). I don't know, but to me, lighted
tennis courts were very basic, and for
this University to not have them was
incomprehensible. I knew for a fact that
a lot of people on campus play tennis.
Hey, next to bowling, I can't think of a
more popular sport on this campus. Ex
cept maybe jogging, and that's not a
sport. Come to think of it, neither is
bowkng.
Sff? the number one sport on this
campus was being denied to every self
respecting, hard-working member of the
Stanford community after the hours of
dusk because someone didn't have the
decency to provide artificial lighting.
By winter quarter freshman year, the
anger had faded into sarcasm and bad
jokes with fellow disgruntled students.
"Wanna play after dinner tonight?" I
would ask. "Sure. You bring the tiki
torches, and I'll get my flint," my friends
would say. Then, we would go to our
rooms, grab our rackets, and come out
to start volleying down the long expanse
of a well-lit Gavilan hallway. This amused
us, this last-ditch resort, but underneath
this jovial veneer seethed a bitterness
and despair.

So it is easy to understand why Peter
Nadan became our messiah, the man who
would lead us out of Darkness.
Sophomore year came. And then there
was ... no light. The year was passing
quickly. Failure. Dejection.
By this time, though, I had noticed
that tennis was not the only neglected
sport. That, in fact, there weren't any
outdoor sporting facilities with lights at
all. I was a mature sophomore, I could
rationalize this situation. I thought. . . .
Maybe it was the money. This thought
did not last long.
Maybe there were aesthetic considera
tions. I knew that all the buildings had
to be earth tone and carry red-tiled roofs.
Maybe harsh, institutional outdoor lights
would wreck the serene Moorish beauty
of the campus.
Maybe it was some kind of technicality.
This idea began to take hold of my im
agination. I could see some past Stanford
president receiving an endowment from
a crusty eccentric. "I'll give you these
many million dollars," the tycoon said in
a craggly voice, between coughs and
wheezes, "but you have to swear not to
hoist any of them damned lights. Young
whippersnappers have to study at night.
None of that funnin' and merriment stuff
and nonsense!" This explanation quelled
my emotions for the year. Whenever I
would trek over to the courts, eager to
hit some balls, only to find the sign-up
booked solid until dusk, I would think of
that old man spitting out at me: "Stuff
and nonsense!"
It is today and I am a junior and less
jaded than before. I no longer have to

think up excuses for this University's
shortcomings, because I realize they are
quite prone to making mistakes. Whereas
in the past, I would have tried to peg a
scapegoat for this injustice, whether it
be money or aesthetics or rich alumni or
criminal neglect, now I'm satisfied to
simply dismiss the incident as another
failure of a very large and very imperfect
machine. Bureaucracy. Red tape.
This evolution from anger to com
placency that I have gone through over
the past three years, this loss of in
nocence, is sad in a way. It marks a point
in my life that I don't find particularly
appealing — the transition into the
numbed state of adulthood. I used to
attribute a lot of the world's ills to numb
ness. I guess I still do.
When I was younger, I remember losing
countless arguments to my parents about
things even more trivial than lighted ten
nis courts, and the only reason was be
cause they were right and they said so.
Those were frustrating times. A
crime was being committed and my par
ents had complete impunity. In
retrospect, I see they weren't trying to
be mean. They probably just expected
me to dismiss their answer as they would
have. But I hated that answer then.
