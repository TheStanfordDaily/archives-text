## Zapata RFs' action and energy form dorm-family ties From sixth-grade math problems to volatile national issues, the Burciagas mix personal and dorm life for the benefit of both

In January of 1985, Tony and Cecilia
Burciaga sat down with their 10-year-old
daughter Rebecca and their seven-year
old son Antonio for a critical family meet
ing -
Should the Burciaga family leave their
quiet suburban Menlo Park home and
accept the challenging position as resident
fellows of Casa Zapata?
! Tony Burciaga, an artist/commercial il
lustrator was unsure he would feel com
fortable in what he then perceived as an
elitist academic environment. Rebecca
and Antonio Burciaga were afraid to leave
familiar surroundings and numerous
friends. The Burciagas were apprehensive
of how 90 undergraduates would affect
the dynamics of their small private fam
ily.
But the Burciagas couldn't resist the
challenge. This year will be their fourth
year as resident fellows at Casa Zapata.
"In the end," said Cecilia Burciaga, "we
decided to accept because Casa Zapata
offered the opportunity and challenge to
make a residence into a real community
and a real home. A place where students
could become life-long friends across eth
nic and gender lines."
The house, named after Emiliano
Zapata a Mexican Revolutionary, was es
tablished in 1972 by Chicano student ac
tivists. Their goal was to create an
environment in which people of Mexican
descent would feel comfortable in and
could celebrate their own culture.
The Burciagas have boldly succeeded
in fulfilling this mission. Today both res
idents and outside observers speak of the
'"Zapata family."
"Zapata is not as transitive a dorm as
most. You feel a part of a family here,"
said junior Vanessa Southern.
Past residents constitute a large part
of that "family." "People come back from
before. Zapata is a home away from
home," Resident Assistant Patty Davis
said. In fact, so many past residents loiter
around the house that for several weeks
after Orientation freshmen are often still
confused about who actually lives in the
house.
But the Burciagas' development of the
Zapata family has not always been
smooth sailing. They have met with
media attention several times, when con

troversial issues forced them to speak up
for the house and its meaning.
Beginning in 1985, when the Burciagas
became RFs, Zapata, and theme houses
in general, were under attack. In the
1985 fall issue of The Stanford Magazine,
Senior Research Fellow John Bunzell
cited evidence from a survey he conducted
which concluded that a majority of Stan
ford students felt that theme houses
promoted separatism.
The Office of Residential Education,
according to Cecilia Burciaga, was also
anti-theme house. Res Ed feared that
theme houses created minority enclaves,
which were inaccessible to the rest of the
University.
"Res Ed's attitude towards Zapata was
'let's share the Chicanos with the whole
Stanford community'," Cecilia Burciaga
said. As the RFs there, the Burciagas
found themselves in the unusual position
of having to defend the very right of
Zapata's existence.
In 1986, the Burciagas were once again
in the spotlight when David Romo, one
of Zapata's RAs, was arrested at Old
Union while protesting Stanford invest
ment in South Africa. The following year
RA Mario Huerta was also arrested at a
student protest.
Zapata's biggest controversy, however,
erupted in 1986 over a controversial
mural.
Tony Burciaga and several residents
painted a mural entitled "Spirit of Hoo
ver," on the house's third floor. The
mural implied that the Hoover Institu
tion, symbolized by Hoover Tower, was
responsible for the opppression of South
African Blacks and Latin Americans.
The mural offended numerous Hoover
fellows who felt it was an unfair and
uninformed attack. The controversy even
tually reached the pages of The San Fran
cisco Chronicle and other major local
newspapers.
Yet the surrounding controversy, in
spite of what one might think, has never
had a negative effect on the "Zapata fam
ily," said Charlie Montoya — a former
four-year resident of Zapata.
"Sometimes the Burciagas and staff
are forced to divert their attention from
affairs within the house to deal with a
controversy. But the house has never been
vehemently upset by any of the contro
versies," Montoya said.

The Burciagas attributed the fact that
they are so often involved in controversy
to two factors. First, Zapata's history of
controversy traditionally draws students
of an activist nature. Second, and more
importantly, the Burciagas have always
led visibly active lives.
In 1974, when Cecilia Burciaga left
Washington, D.C. to come to Stanford
and assume the position of assistant to
the president on Chicano Affairs, the Bur
ciagas carried with them a reputation of
involvement.
Cecilia Burciaga had been on various
national organizations and committees,
including the Board of Trustees for the
Educational Testing Services and the
United States Commission of Civil

Rights. Tony Burciaga had become well
known within the Mexican-American art
community for his work as an artist.
That involvement continues today.
Cecilia Burciaga is assistant dean of Grad
uate Studies, a position which makes her
the highest ranking woman of Mexican-
American descent in Stanford's adminis
tration. She is frequently invited to speak
on womens' and minorities' issues and
also sits on several committees concern
ing these affairs.
Their history of involvement is today
reflected in the atmosphere of the Bur
ciagas small but cozy cottage. It is an
atmosphere of constant motion.
During an evening interview, Cecilia
Buricaga, still dressed in office attire,

complete with name tag from a meeting,
helped her son Antonio with his
homework. She was on her way to yet
another meeting.
Meanwhile, Tony Burciaga listened to
a National Public Radio Broadcast featur
ing himself and his new book, "Weede
Peepo." The book is a humorous analysis
of American culture through the eyes of
a Chicano artist.
Even the furnishings of the cottage
contribute to the hectic atmosphere. Nu
