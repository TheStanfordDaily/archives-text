Taboo you
Sexier and more soulful than other one-named
crooners such as Sting, Tiffany and Madonna,
Sade hits the number-three spot on the Black
Singles chart this week with "Nothing Can Come
Between Us" from her new album "Stronger
Than Pride."
Pictured above is Sade performing last
Saturday at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in
Mountain View. Daily Entertainment insiders
report that she sounds even better in concert
than on her album, and her talented 10-member
backup band is terrific.
