## Terrific toons take Palo Alto 
### Ruben Garcia 
Please answer the following questions
as truthfully as possible:
Do you stay for the cartoons at Sun
day Flicks and then leave once the movie
starts? Did you see "Roger Rabbit" 78
times? Is Saturday morning the only
day you get up before 11?
If you answered yes to any of these
questions, you're definitely a closet car
toon lover. But you don't have to be a
cartoon lover to enjoy "The 21st Inter
national Tournee of Animation."
The "Tournee" is an extremely di
verse collection of 14 animated shorts
from nine different countries, each de
signed either to tell a story, make a
social statement in a humorous way, or
to simply blow the mind of the viewer.
Fans of this type of entertainment
have vastly different ideas about what
the genre should strive for. The Satur
day morning afficiando calls them
"Toons" and has a definite disdain for
any attempt at an "animation as art"
style.
Others see the 'Tooners as lowbrow
and want their animation to be a sort
of moving Renoir. And still others love
animation because it allows them to
suspend their disbelief and let their im
aginations run freely. Incidentally, these
are the same people that saw "Pink
Floyd: The Wall" 12 times for its
animated marching hammers.
Luckily, the "Tournee" aims to please
all the different types of fans and to
convert those who aren't already hooked.
The animation styles incorporated in

the "Tournee" range from the clayma
tion figures in "Arnold Escapes From
Church" to the stark beauty of the
Canadian "The Man Who Planted
Trees."
For those who consider cartoons an
out-of-body experience, the "Tournee"
offers several cartoons in a slightly more
bizarre vein. Strangely, two of these
carry the theme of the rebellion of food.
The Hungarian "Augusta Kneading"
features a creature made of dough re
sembling a giant ravioli trying to control
the usurping ingredients of a pasta dish.
And "Candy Jam" provides an excellent
opening piece in that it prepares the
audience to let their imaginations run
wild — complete with a herd of man
eating M&Ms.
Fans of downright hilarious cartoons
(which most cartoon lovers are), will be
appeased by the "Tournee'"s plentiful
share. The Brazilian entry "When Bats
Are Quiet" is a sendup of American
suspense movies complete with a lone
traveler coming upon a deserted house
which holds a strange surprise.
And "Living in a Mobile Home", a
British entry to the fold, is set to a
hilarious punk rock song about a
"mum" who tears through the country
side in a large recreational vehicle.
The collection's stars find an in
genious mix of all the best elements of
animation. The rich artisty of "Pas A
Deux" brilliantly offsets its irreverence
and quickly-paced action. The anima
tion pairs such disparate partners as
Charlie Chaplin and Miss Piggy in a
waltzing frenzy, and in doing so, fully

communicates animation's ability to
make the impossible a reality. After
all, how else could you see the Pope
breakdancing?
But on the basis of laughs, animation,
and relevance to society, the best short
has to be the Cuban "Quinoscopio."
Among other things, the cartoon
uproariously pokes fun at our agreed
vision of Hell in which everyone is suf
fering; relates the fear one has of or
dering at an exotic foreign restaurant
and not being sure what you may get;
and even satirically touches upon the
problem of medical waste.

Did you see 'Roger Rab
bit' 78 times? Is Saturday
morning the only day you
get up before 11?

The pieces that mar the collection
are, sadly enough, the overly artistic
ones: the Swiss "78 Tours" and the
Hungarian "Lights Before Dawn." Al
though their animation has a certain
aesthetic quality, the dizzying motion
and comparable music lead the viewer's
concentration astray.
"The Man Who Planted Trees" is the
only really successful serious piece.
Beautifully animated and poetically nar
rated, the 30 minute film is, because
of its length, the only one with anything
resembling a strong plot. It is the final
selection for a good reason — it indicates
how dynamic this genre really is.
But regardless of whether you like
two or all 14 of the cartoons in the
"Tournee", animation is such a refresh
ing change in entertainment that it's
hard to come out of the theater disap
pointed.
It would be a mistake for anyone who
was put off to animation by the endless
marketing of "Who Framed Roger Rab
bit?" or the pallidness of Disney films
to pass up the "Tournee." Some parts
of this collection pale in comparison to
others, but taken as a whole, it is a
unique change in the sometimes dull
movie pace.
And because of its variety, the "21st
International Tournee of Animation" is
widely appealing. It's hard to find
anyone, no matter how intellectual, who
doesn't enjoy a good cartoon now and
then (the wild hoots for Bugs Bunny at
Sunday Flicks is a good example of this).
And it's hard not to like this collection.
"The 21st Annual Tournee of Anima
tion" is playing at the Varsity Theater
in Palo Alto.
