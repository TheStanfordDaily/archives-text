## Did Brits commit the Aboriginal sin?

How far would the British gov
ernment go to cover up the fact
that in 1953 it exploded atomic
bombs in an occupied area of the
Australian outback? This is the
question posed by the thriller
"Ground Zero," the latest film
from popular 29-year-old
Australian director Michael Pat
tinson.
Harvey Denton (Colin Friels) is
a photographer whose somewhat
aimless life quickly changes when
he discovers that his father was
murdered in 1953 because of what
he had seen during the British
nuclear testing. Denton sets out
to discover what it was that his
father knew and filmed — and
what had caused his death. The
trail of discovery leads him into
conflict with the British govern
ment and the Australian secret
service.
"Ground Zero" weaves a bit of
fiction into historical fact: In 1984
a Royal Commission met in
Australia to hear claims by vet
erans and Australian natives
about damage, sickness and death

caused by the nuclear testing that
did occur. The commission was
unable to prove that the British
government was negligent in con
ducting its nuclear tests; however,
the movie closes with a stark list
ing of deaths and radioactivity

levels still present today.
Thex-e is no sex and very little
violence; the film relies on images
and imagination for its sometimes
taut suspense, although a truly
superlative, chilling soundtrack
heightens the suspense through

out the movie. Many of the back
ground scenes were filmed in the
Australian Outback, and the bru
tal desert scenery adds to the des
olate feeling of the film as Denton
struggles on, mostly alone, to
make the truth known.
