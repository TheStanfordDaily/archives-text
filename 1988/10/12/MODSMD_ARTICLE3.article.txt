# Chilean speaks on country's future
## Pinochet given little chance for victory in upcoming national election 
### Jay Bhattacharya Staff writer 
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
has no chance of winning the nation's
presidential election next year, Chilean
affairs expert Rafael Echeverria told a
60-person audience yesterday.
In a speech delivered at the History
Corner, Echeverria, a former professor
of sociology at the prestigious Catholic
University in Chile, predicted that
Pinochet would be voted down by the
Chilean people if elections take place as
planned in 1989.
Echeverria, along with many other
researchers, was expelled from his uni
versity posts when Pinochet overthrew
the socialist government of Salvador Al

lende in 1973.
The Chilean constitution, enacted by
Pinochet's administration in 1980, re
quired that a referendum be held this
year to measure the level of popular
support for Pinochet.
The referendum, which took place last
week, showed that 53 percent of the
Chilean people oppose the current mil
itary dictatorship. As a result, the
Pinochet government must hold an open
election in 1989 to comply with its own
constitution.
Following his expulsion, Echeverria
accepted a research position at Stanford
but returned to Chile in 1978. He is
currently working in the Bay Area for
an educational research company — the
president of the company is a former

Chilean minister for the Allende gov
ernment.
Echeverria said the referendum does
not guarantee the opposition an easy
ride into power, stressing three areas
where the opposition should be most
concerned.
First, "the opposition (parties) must
form some sort of alliance with the mil
itary for an opposition coalition govern
ment to succeed," he said.
"It is inevitable that the military will
have a strong say (in the government
after the election)," he added.
According to Echeverria, the opposi
tion parties are improving relations with
the military. For example, "the com-

mander of the air force has indi
cated some willingness to form an
alliance (with the opposition),"
Echeverria said.
Second, the opposition must act
quickly "to capitalize on the loss
of political support which resulted
from Pinochet's loss in the refer
endum," he said.
Persuading those people who
still support Pinochet to join the
opposition will be crucial for the
success of an opposition govern
ment, should Pinochet be voted
down, he said.
Finally, Echeverria said a large
obstacle facing the opposition is
the choice of a candidate, consid
ering the diverse array of opposi
tion parties.
The candidate must have the
support of the Christian Demo

cratic Party, the largest opposition
party, Echeverria said.
But parties with a Marxist
ideology, like the Communist
party, will play only a small role
in selecting the opposition candi
date, he noted.
These parties represent only 5
percent of the Chilean population,
and candidates from these parties
are forbidden by the Chilean con
stitution from running in the elec
tion.
Echeverria also outlined areas
of concern for Pinochet and the
status quo government.
"They (the government) must
consolidate the 43 percent of the
electorate that they received in
the referendum," he said. "Losing
the support of the business sector
would be disastrous" for the gov
ernment's chances in the election.
Echeverria also said, "It is in
the government's best interest to
maintain the (Chilean) constitu
tion. It was written to enforce re

strictions on the new government,
and it will be the legacy of Pinoc
het's 15 years in power."
As an example of how the con
stitution hinders the opposition,
he noted the fact that Pinochet
will remain the commander in
chief of the Chilean armed forces
for four to eight years after the
election, regardless of the result.
According to Echeverria, the
present regime must also decide
whether Pinochet "is a suitable
candidate in the general election."
"Pinochet lost the plebiscite, so
it is unclear that he would be the
strongest candidate (for the gov
ernment) in the election," he said.
One speech goer, junior Wren
Wescoatt, said Escheverria's pro
vided a "solid introduction" of
Chilean history.
"I came into the speech with
little knowledge about (Chile), but
I feel more comfortable now about
the issues," Wescoatt said.

According to Echeverria, the
present regime must also decide
whether Pinochet "is a suitable
candidate in the general election."
"Pinochet lost the plebiscite, so
it is unclear that he would be the
strongest candidate (for the gov
ernment) in the election," he said.
One speech goer, junior Wren
Wescoatt, said Escheverria's pro
vided a "solid introduction" of
Chilean history.
"I came into the speech with
little knowledge about (Chile), but
I feel more comfortable now about
the issues," Wescoatt said.
Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
has no chance of winning the nation's
presidential election next year, Chilean
affairs expert Rafael Echeverria told a
60-person audience yesterday.
In a speech delivered at the History
Corner, Echeverria, a former professor
of sociology at the prestigious Catholic
University in Chile, predicted that
Pinochet would be voted down by the
Chilean people if elections take place as
planned in 1989.
Echeverria, along with many other
researchers, was expelled from his uni
versity posts when Pinochet overthrew
the socialist government of Salvador Al

lende in 1973.
The Chilean constitution, enacted by
Pinochet's administration in 1980, re
quired that a referendum be held this
year to measure the level of popular
support for Pinochet.
The referendum, which took place last
week, showed that 53 percent of the
Chilean people oppose the current mil
itary dictatorship. As a result, the
Pinochet government must hold an open
election in 1989 to comply with its own
constitution.
Following his expulsion, Echeverria
accepted a research position at Stanford
but returned to Chile in 1978. He is
currently working in the Bay Area for
an educational research company — the
president of the company is a former

Chilean minister for the Allende gov
ernment.
Echeverria said the referendum does
not guarantee the opposition an easy
ride into power, stressing three areas
where the opposition should be most
concerned.
First, "the opposition (parties) must
form some sort of alliance with the mil
itary for an opposition coalition govern
ment to succeed," he said.
"It is inevitable that the military will
have a strong say (in the government
after the election)," he added.
According to Echeverria, the opposi
tion parties are improving relations with
the military. For example, "the com-

mander of the air force has indi
cated some willingness to form an
alliance (with the opposition),"
Echeverria said.
Second, the opposition must act
quickly "to capitalize on the loss
of political support which resulted
from Pinochet's loss in the refer
endum," he said.
Persuading those people who
still support Pinochet to join the
opposition will be crucial for the
success of an opposition govern
ment, should Pinochet be voted
down, he said.
Finally, Echeverria said a large
obstacle facing the opposition is
the choice of a candidate, consid
ering the diverse array of opposi
tion parties.
The candidate must have the
support of the Christian Demo

cratic Party, the largest opposition
party, Echeverria said.
But parties with a Marxist
ideology, like the Communist
party, will play only a small role
in selecting the opposition candi
date, he noted.
These parties represent only 5
percent of the Chilean population,
and candidates from these parties
are forbidden by the Chilean con
stitution from running in the elec
tion.
Echeverria also outlined areas
of concern for Pinochet and the
status quo government.
"They (the government) must
consolidate the 43 percent of the
electorate that they received in
the referendum," he said. "Losing
the support of the business sector
would be disastrous" for the gov
ernment's chances in the election.
Echeverria also said, "It is in
the government's best interest to
maintain the (Chilean) constitu
tion. It was written to enforce re

strictions on the new government,
and it will be the legacy of Pinoc
het's 15 years in power."
As an example of how the con
stitution hinders the opposition,
he noted the fact that Pinochet
will remain the commander in
chief of the Chilean armed forces
for four to eight years after the
election, regardless of the result.
According to Echeverria, the
present regime must also decide
whether Pinochet "is a suitable
candidate in the general election."
"Pinochet lost the plebiscite, so
it is unclear that he would be the
strongest candidate (for the gov
ernment) in the election," he said.

Wescoatt, said Escheverria's pro
