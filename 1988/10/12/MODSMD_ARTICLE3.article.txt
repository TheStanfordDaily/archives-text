## Pinochet given little chance for victory in upcoming national election

Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
has no chance of winning the nation's
presidential election next year, Chilean
affairs expert Rafael Echeverria told a
60-person audience yesterday.
In a speech delivered at the History
Corner, Echeverria, a former professor
of sociology at the prestigious Catholic
University in Chile, predicted that
Pinochet would be voted down by the
Chilean people if elections take place as
planned in 1989.
Echeverria, along with many other
researchers, was expelled from his uni

the socialist government of Salvador Al

Pinochet's administration in 1980, re

week, showed that 53 percent of the
Chilean people oppose the current mil
itary dictatorship. As a result, the
Pinochet government must hold an open
election in 1989 to comply with its own
constitution.
Following his expulsion, Echeverria
accepted a research position at Stanford
but returned to Chile in 1978. He is
currently working in the Bay Area for
an educational research company — the
president of the company is a former

Chilean minister for the Allende gov
ernment.
Echeverria said the referendum does
not guarantee the opposition an easy
ride into power, stressing three areas
where the opposition should be most
concerned.
First, "the opposition (parties) must
form some sort of alliance with the mil
itary for an opposition coalition govern
ment to succeed," he said.
"It is inevitable that the military will
have a strong say (in the government
after the election)," he added.
According to Echeverria, the opposi
tion parties are improving relations with
the military. For example, "the com-
