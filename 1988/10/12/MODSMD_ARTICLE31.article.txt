## Dons descend on Stanford 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
This afternoon there will be very pivo
tal games played at both Stanford's
Maloney Field and Dodger Stadium.
While admittedly there may be more
attention focused on the latter site, you
couldn't convince the Cardinal men's
soccer team that Game 7 of the National
League Championship Series is any
more important.
Stanford will be trying to stave off a
drop below .500 when they take on the
San Francisco Dons at 4:15 today. The
Dons are 11-3, ranked nationally and
in the top five in the West. The task
is tall, but don't count Stanford out.
Although the Cardinal is 7-7 and the
underdog, it is a position the squad has
relished in past years. Last year Stan
ford was 3-4-2 when it took on the Dons,
and defeated them on the road, 1-0.
"In the three years I've been here,
we've beaten them two out of three
times, and we were underdogs every
time," defender Jim Killfoil said.
What's more, last year's victory
kicked off what had to be the high point
of the team's last few seasons. They
went on to win four straight over such
notables as UCLA and Fresno State.
The Cardinal, losers of three in a row
and seven of its last eight, has a huge
incentive to repeat such a streak this
year.
"We've got something to prove," for

ward Todd Caven stated. "We know we
can play."
Coach Sam Koch knows his team can
play too, but is pondering lineup
changes based on a letdown that oc
curred last Sunday. Stanford allowed
some goals it shouldn't have and lost
5-2 to Washington, a team that Stanford
would have beat in the beginning of the
season. Caven, who got a goal and an
assist in the process of being named
All-Tournament last weekend, will start
and see more playing time tomorrow.

been here, we've
beaten them (USF)
two out of three times,
and we were under
dogs every time.'

Not only will Stanford have some new
faces, but perhaps even a whole new
attitude out there on the field today.
At 7-7, it is a new beginning for the

club, one that lacks the pressure of
playoff expectations. "We can go out
much more relaxed," said Caven, a soph
omore.
This is not to imply that the Cardi
nal's season is over. Senior Luke Garrott
thinks that the team has not given up
the "playoff mentality" but that this
game is the final frontier. "People are
still enthusiastic. But I think if we lose
one more game. . .
USF comes to town with a potent
offense, led by U.S. Olympic team player
John Doyle. The sweeper has come back
from the Olympics, where he scored a
goal, to lead his team on a win string.
USF features an attack that brings its
defenders up to score, and fullback Alan
Bailey joins Doyle for a dangerous com
bination.
"They're a perennial power, and if
you knock them off it's a great win,"
junior sweeper Mark Semioli said of the
Dons. "It's a confidence-builder because
they're such a great program. They
don't have a weakness."
The Cardinal can do just that if it
plays as well as it did Saturday against
UCLA. Despite losing 1- 0, Stanford
had many chances and dominated the
Bruins much of the game. "We con
trolled eighty percent of that game,"
Koch said.
All the team needs is some goals. "We
didn't play all that bad - everyone
realizes that. Our team play is fine,
we're just not scoring," Caven con
cluded.

one more game. . .
USF comes to town with a potent
offense, led by U.S. Olympic team player
John Doyle. The sweeper has come back
from the Olympics, where he scored a
goal, to lead his team on a win string.
USF features an attack that brings its
defenders up to score, and fullback Alan
Bailey joins Doyle for a dangerous com
bination.
"They're a perennial power, and if
you knock them off it's a great win,"
junior sweeper Mark Semioli said of the
Dons. "It's a confidence-builder because
they're such a great program. They
don't have a weakness."
The Cardinal can do just that if it
plays as well as it did Saturday against
UCLA. Despite losing 1- 0, Stanford
had many chances and dominated the
Bruins much of the game. "We con
trolled eighty percent of that game,"
Koch said.
All the team needs is some goals. "We
didn't play all that bad - everyone
realizes that. Our team play is fine,
we're just not scoring," Caven con
cluded.

Chris Porch, a junior forward for the Cardinal, has two goals and three assists for
the booters so far this season. Porch was Stanford's leading scorer last season.
Stanford will take on the San Francisco Dons this afternoon at Harry Maloney Field,
and desperately needs a win to stay in contention for the playoffs and above .500.
