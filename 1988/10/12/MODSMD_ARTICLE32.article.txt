# Empty seats: Stanford athletes find it's lonely at the top
## 
### 
Saturday night I saw a vol
leyball match like none I'd
ever seen before.
Two of the best teams in the
country — one the defending na
tional champion, the other last
. year's runner-up — locked in a
fierce see-saw battle where you

almost hated to see one team lose
Almost, but not quite. You sec
one of those teams was our team
You know, the Stanford Cardinal
The other team was from the Uni
versity of Hawaii: the hated Rain
bow Wahines who robbed the Car
dinal in last year's NCAA Tour
nament.

The same Rainbow Wahines
who snatched away the last op
portunity for Wendi Rush, Teresa
Smith and Nancy Reno — three
of the finest players ever to take
the court for Stanford — to enjoy
a national title.
And, as you probably have
heard, we beat them. The decisive
fifth game was a 15-5 blowout.
You would've loved it; it's too bad
you weren't there with me to root
them on.
Okay, some of you were there,
but not many. According to the
official announcement, a mere
1,803 spectators filed into Maples
Saturday night.
Most of them were Hawaiian
students from other colleges in
the area. They were rooting for
the Rainbows.
The Stanford contingent would
have been hard pressed to fill
Dinkelspiel Auditorium (capacity
721) let alone the 7,500 seat arena
in which the match took place.
Through the first three games
the Stanford faithful did their
finest imitation of a symphony
audience, applauding after a dy

namic crescendo and sitting on
their hands most of the time. The
Hawaii fans, on the other hand,
were cheering loudly enough to
be heard in Governor's Corner.
They had a "tastes great — less
filling" cheer going where the stu
dents on one side of the court
would yell "Rain" and the stu
dents on the other side in the
Stanford student section would re
spond with "Rows." With a crowd
like this on the road, it's almost
scary to imagine what its like
when they're home.
To be fair, in the fourth game
with Stanford trailing two games
to one, the Cardinal crowd did
come alive. In the excitement I'm
not exactly sure what happened,
but I think the awakening of the
crowd went something like this:
Hawaii's Teee Williams, the
Wayne Gretzky of women's vol
leyball, was virtually unstoppable
all night long when hitting from
the front, left corner of the court.
Rut, in the middle of the fourth
game, Amy Hayes, whose picture
probably appears next to the def
inition of "clutch player" in the
dictionary, dove to the ground to

dig one of Williams' thunderous
spikes from the floor.
The crowd let out a roar.
A point or two later, Amy
Cooper, a freshman who is already
a dominating force and will no
doubt get even better, rejected
Williams at the net.
The crowd went insane.
It was awesome.
Midway through the fifth game,
when a Stanford victory was all
but assured, I went as far as to
ask my friend if the crowd ever
storms the court in volleyball.
I wasn't serious, but the point
is: there was that kind of intensity.
When Stanford fans want to, they
can scream and yell with the best
of them. Take last year's
Stanford-Arizona basketball game
where a sellout crowd nearly
brought the house down as the
Cardinal upset the nation's No.
1-ranked team.
The problem is that too often
the crowds are sparse and they're
of the Bay Area white wine
sipping demeanor that has in
furiated athletes from ex-Giant
Chili Davis to 49er center Randy

Cross.
I know you all probably have
better things to do with your time,
but had you spent a couple hours
at Maples Saturday you would
have seen some great volleyball
and still had plenty of time to hit
the party scene.
You see, before I came to Stan-

What I didn't know is
that we have the best
athletic program in
the nation.

ford I knew it had a great aca
demic reputation and a beautiful
campus. What I didn't know is
that we also have the best, yes I
mean best, all-around athletic
program in the nation.
As one who eats, drinks and
sleeps sports, I've done all I can
to take advantage of it. I've
watched everything from women's
soccer to baseball and cheered at
every event.

At Saturday's football game, a
colleague of mine told me he had
a dream that Jason Palumbis, our
quarterback, would have to step
back from the center and wave
his arms to quiet the crowd. "That
would be amazing," I said, real
izing it probably wouldn't happen
in our lifetimes.
It's a shame that all these great
athletes are toiling in relative
obscurity among their fellow stu
dents. How many of you know
who Kristin Klein is? Or Jono
Tunney?
I'd assume that most of you
know who Todd Lichti is. But it's
a little scary that I'm not abso
lutely sure.
Pick a sport this week, any
sport will do as long as it's played
here. Find out when the team's
next home competition is and plan
on being there. Wear something
red and be prepared to scream
your head off. I know our athletes
will appreciate it.
You may even find that you like
it half as much as I do.
