# Women's soccer digs in for St. Mary's
## Andeberhan's troops look for fifth consecutive win, national recognition 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
At 3:00 this afternoon at Stan
ford's Harry Maloney Field, a cri
tical women's soccer match gets
underway. It pits the homestand
ing Cardinal against the St.
Mary's College Lady Gaels, a most
formidable opponent. St. Mary's
has been in and out of the Division
I Top Twenty poll during the
course of their 1988 campaign.
Additionally, they have consis
tently checked in at No. 4 in the
Western region poll.
The Lady Gaels' resume con
tinues. Only a few days have
elapsed since St. Mary's defeated
the Santa Clara Broncos, who hap
pen to have occupied the No. 3
position in the Western poll since
the season began in mid-
September. In beating the
Broncos by a one-goal margin (2-
1), St. Mary's duplicated a feat
accomplished by Stanford one
week ago.
Stanford's 1-0 victory over
Santa Clara was one of the four
consecutive Cardinal wins that
have run Stanford's record to an
impressive 7-3-1. Indeed, the
Stanford team seems to be flying
high at this juncture in the
season, and their peak could not
have come at a more appropriate
time. A win over St. Mary's, cou
pled with the Cardinal's clutch
win over Santa Clara, would prob
ably deliver the all-too-elusive No.
3 Western ranking on Stanford's
doorstep.
How does the team itself feel
about the Cardinal's prime posi
tion in the west a little after the
mid-season mark? Senior
midfielder Beth Egan probably
spoke for all of her teammates
when she commented, "We've sur
prised ourselves a little."
Certainly nobody can blame the
Stanford players for being
pleasantly surprised with their
solid record; in one season, the
Cardinal has made an about-face

in their performance. Stanford
has gone, in 12 months, from a
mediocre, 4-10-4 club to a Western
soccer force that is knocking on
the door of a Top Twenty bid of
their own.
Sophomore scoring phenom
Lisa Sime, however, was quick to
put a halt to any talk concerning
a national ranking. "All season,
our main goal has always been to

A win, even if hard
fought, over the Lady
Gaels today will make
Stanford a serious
contender for a na
tional ranking

play well and consistently in our
next game. We take each game as
it comes, and everybody's mind
remains focused on the opponent
at hand."
Similarly, Egan displayed an
ability to keep her attention
riveted to the Cardinal's next
match. She explained her attitude:
"All season long, Berhane (An
deberhan, women's soccer coach)
has stressed just playing well —
playing our best. He has told us
not to concentrate on our won-loss
record, but rather to simply focus
on playing consistently. He thinks
that if we play consistently, our
season will turn out all right."
Coach Andeberhan's claim
seems to be coming true. Although
none of the Stanford players will
allow themselves to think about
the ramifications of their excep
tional play, there are some possi
bilities that must be considered.
The item deserving the most
immediate attention is the Cardi
nal's national status. A win, even
if hard-fought, over the Lady
Gaels today will make Stanford a
serious contender for a Top

Twenty national ranking. The
Cardinal's victory over Santa
Clara, ranked 15th in the most
recent Gatorade National Soccer
Ranking, certainly seems indica
tive of Stanford's national
prominence.
With some late-season breaks,
the Cardinal has an outside shot
at breaking into the NCAA tour
ney. With California and Santa
Barbara firmly established as the
two teams that will go from the
western region, Stanford's hopes
will probably rest on receiving one
of the four at-large bids. That is,
of course, only if the Cardinal can
do nothing against Cal, the na
tion's No. 5 team. In light of the

Cardinal's previous strong
performances against top ten
teams, namely UCSB and Con
necticut, a strong showing by
Stanford against Cal is probable.
Of course, all of this speculation
about the future will be more or
less meaningless if the Cardinal
suffers a casualty against the
Gaels.
The Cardinal, very appropriate
ly, is concentrating solely on the
matter at hand: the St. Mary's
Lady Gaels. Both teams are
geared and ready, and the match
today promises to be a duel to
the bitter end. At stake is a pos
sible NCAA Division I Top Twenty
bid. Nothing more need be said.

How does the team itself feel
about the Cardinal's prime posi
tion in the west a little after the
mid-season mark? Senior
midfielder Beth Egan probably
spoke for all of her teammates
when she commented, "We've sur
prised ourselves a little."
Certainly nobody can blame the
Stanford players for being
pleasantly surprised with their
solid record; in one season, the
Cardinal has made an about-face

in their performance. Stanford
has gone, in 12 months, from a
mediocre, 4-10-4 club to a Western
soccer force that is knocking on
the door of a Top Twenty bid of
their own.
Sophomore scoring phenom
Lisa Sime, however, was quick to
put a halt to any talk concerning
a national ranking. "All season,
our main goal has always been to

A win, even if hard
fought, over the Lady
Gaels today will make
Stanford a serious
contender for a na
tional ranking

play well and consistently in our
next game. We take each game as
it comes, and everybody's mind
remains focused on the opponent
at hand."
Similarly, Egan displayed an
ability to keep her attention
riveted to the Cardinal's next
match. She explained her attitude:
"All season long, Berhane (An
deberhan, women's soccer coach)
has stressed just playing well —
playing our best. He has told us
not to concentrate on our won-loss
record, but rather to simply focus
on playing consistently. He thinks
that if we play consistently, our
season will turn out all right."
Coach Andeberhan's claim
seems to be coming true. Although
none of the Stanford players will
allow themselves to think about
the ramifications of their excep
tional play, there are some possi
bilities that must be considered.
The item deserving the most
immediate attention is the Cardi
nal's national status. A win, even
if hard-fought, over the Lady
Gaels today will make Stanford a
serious contender for a Top

Twenty national ranking. The
Cardinal's victory over Santa
Clara, ranked 15th in the most
recent Gatorade National Soccer
Ranking, certainly seems indica
tive of Stanford's national
prominence.
With some late-season breaks,
the Cardinal has an outside shot
at breaking into the NCAA tour
ney. With California and Santa
Barbara firmly established as the
two teams that will go from the
western region, Stanford's hopes
will probably rest on receiving one
of the four at-large bids. That is,
of course, only if the Cardinal can
do nothing against Cal, the na
tion's No. 5 team. In light of the

Cardinal's previous strong
performances against top ten
teams, namely UCSB and Con
necticut, a strong showing by
Stanford against Cal is probable.
Of course, all of this speculation
about the future will be more or
less meaningless if the Cardinal
suffers a casualty against the
Gaels.
The Cardinal, very appropriate
ly, is concentrating solely on the
matter at hand: the St. Mary's
Lady Gaels. Both teams are
geared and ready, and the match
today promises to be a duel to
the bitter end. At stake is a pos
sible NCAA Division I Top Twenty
bid. Nothing more need be said.

soccer team will try to keep a four-game winning streak in a contest

Cardinal with a goal and an assist in the last three games.
At 3:00 this afternoon at Stan
ford's Harry Maloney Field, a cri
tical women's soccer match gets
underway. It pits the homestand
ing Cardinal against the St.
Mary's College Lady Gaels, a most
formidable opponent. St. Mary's
has been in and out of the Division
I Top Twenty poll during the
course of their 1988 campaign.
Additionally, they have consis
tently checked in at No. 4 in the
Western region poll.
The Lady Gaels' resume con
tinues. Only a few days have
elapsed since St. Mary's defeated
the Santa Clara Broncos, who hap
pen to have occupied the No. 3
position in the Western poll since
the season began in mid-
September. In beating the
Broncos by a one-goal margin (2-
1), St. Mary's duplicated a feat
accomplished by Stanford one
week ago.
Stanford's 1-0 victory over
Santa Clara was one of the four
consecutive Cardinal wins that
have run Stanford's record to an
impressive 7-3-1. Indeed, the
Stanford team seems to be flying
high at this juncture in the
season, and their peak could not
have come at a more appropriate
time. A win over St. Mary's, cou
pled with the Cardinal's clutch
win over Santa Clara, would prob
ably deliver the all-too-elusive No.
3 Western ranking on Stanford's
doorstep.
