## Cone has last laugh 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Da
vid Cone wrote a different story
in Game 6 of the National
League playoffs, pitching a
five-hitter as the New York
Mets beat the Los Angeles
Dodgers 5-1 Tuesday night to
tie the best-of-seven series at
three games apiece.
The decisive seventh game
will be played Wednesday at
Dodger Stadium. Orel Her
shiser, a 23-game winner, will
start for Los Angeles against
Ron Darling, 17-9.
Kevin Mcßeynolds, with a
two-run homer among his four
hits in four at-bats, provided
the offense against loser Tim
Mcßeynolds, who also
had a sacrifice fly, drove in
three of the five runs as New
York provided the scoring Man
ager Davey Johnson had
promised for the sixth game.
The four hits tied an NL
playoff record accomplished by
eight players, the last Tito
Landrum of the St. Louis Car
dinals in 1985.
After a shaky first inning,
Mets' pitcher David Cone shut
the Dodgers out on one hit un
til two were out in the fifth
when reliever Brian Holton sin
gled, Steve Sax walked and
Mickey Hatcher singled in a
run to make it 4-1. Holton was
0-for-10 this season and 1-for
-20 lifetime.
Cone ended the threat by get
ting Kirk Gibson to pop to
third. Cone, who didn't make
his first start until May 3,
walked three and struck out
six. The Dodgers' 3-4-5 hitters
were hitless in 16 at-bata.
In each of the first five

games the Dodgers took the
lead, while during the regular
season the Mets scored first in
seven of the 11 games.
This time, the Mets came out
running — and scoring —
against Leary.
Leary, a former Met, was 17-
11 during the season but lost
three of his last five decisions.
He was 0-2 against New York,
allowing nine runs and 13 hits
in 12 innings.
After fouling off several
pitches, leadoff hitter Len
Dykstra hit a shot to first base
that Hatcher bobbled for an
error. Wally Backman, moved
from eighth to second in the
order, dropped a perfect hit
and-run single in front of a
hobbling Gibson in left to send
Dykstra to third.
Keith Hernandez struck out
and, after Darryl Strawberry
walked to load the bases,
Mcßeynolds hit a sacrifice fly
to right field. Mcßeynolds had
19 game-winning RBI during
the season and hit .309 with
runners in scoring position.
Strawberry, 9-for-26 in the
series, and Mcßeynolds led off
the third inning with singles
and two outs later Kevin Elster
hit an RBI double. Elster was
3-for-4 against Leary with two
home runs in two games this
season.
Leary walked Strawberry
leading off the fifth and
Mcßeynolds followed with a
home run over 370-foot sign in
left field.
The Mets made it 5-1 in the
sixth when Dykstra doubled
and scored on Hernandez's
single.
