# Student ends own life
## Rizzo's body found in Mountain View apartment 
### Elaine Riggs Staff writer 
First-year graduate student Timothy
Charles Rizzo was found dead Thursday
in his Mountain View apartment after he
committed suicide, according to the Santa
Clara County Coroner's Office. The exact
date of Rizzo's death has not yet been
released.
The death is unrelated to that of second
year law student Arthur Louis Rivers,
whose body was found Friday in Mountain
View.
Rizzo, who was 24, had a General Motors
fellowship to study electrical engineering
at Stanford. He graduated magna cum
laude from the General Motors Interna
tional Engineering and Management Insti
tute in June.
Rizzo shot himself in the head with a
12-gauge shotgun, according to the death
certificate.
Rizzo's body was found by a college friend
who had been asked by Rizzo's parents to
check on him. Rizzo's parents, who live in
Wilmington, Del., became concerned when
they were unable to contact their son by
phone for about two weeks.
Rizzo had hoped to earn his master's
degree at Stanford in nine months, accord
ing to his father. Stanford graduate stu
dents in electrical engineering usually take
from one to two academic years to earn
their masters' degrees.
"We can't come up with a reason," Riz
zo's father said of his son's death.
"His first call from California was com
plete elation," his father said yesterday.
"The second time he called, he said almost
everyone he talked to had advised him he
was taking a big load, an almost impossible
task.
"He said, 'Dad, I think I'm going to have
a problem. I don't think I'll be able to get
all A's. But to accept B's and C's would
be a failure.' "
His father told Timothy to consider
stretching out his degree program to 18
months or two years, noting that GM had
indicated it would extend the fellowship if

Rizzo needed more time.
Tim Slack, who was Rizzo's mentor at
the GM diesel engine plant in Moiraine,
Ohio, said "he was an outstanding employ
ee, very well liked and respected by all the
people in the plant."
"He was an enthusiastic, positive person,
a joy to be around," Slack said.
According to his father, Rizzo was "the
happiest kid in the world" when he was
accepted to Stanford last spring.
"He went out to visit a month before
classes started to rent an apartment and
familiarize himself with the area," his
father said. "He came home with a big
Stanford sweatshirt, as proud and as happy
as could be. You couldn't find a boy in
better spirits when he left."
Rizzo had considered working in manu
facturing, doing research or becoming a
university teacher, but he was "too young
to know for sure," his father said.
Local memorial services have not been
announced. The family plans a Christian
burial for Rizzo at 10 a.m. Saturday at the
Calvary Cemetary in Dayton.
