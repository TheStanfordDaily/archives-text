# Full-time ethnic deans under consideration
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
After over 10 years of struggle with Uni
versity officials, minority organizations at
Stanford may soon get full-time deans
devoted to working with specific minority
groups.
According to Michael Jackson, associate
dean of Student Affairs, the University is
conducting an investigation to determine

the needs of both the Asian
American and Chicano/
Latino communities for
full-time assistant deans.
Both of these ethnic groups
have been fighting for
years to have full-time
deans appointed.
An assistant dean work
ing with these minority
groups would help provide

advice and University support for commu
nity programs and act as a liason between
the University and the students, Jackson
said.
The El Centro Chicano/Latino commu
nity center received a half-time assistant
dean, Juan Yniguez, four years ago, said
MEChA press representative Alejandro
Sweet. MEChA is a Chicano student group.
But Sweet said Yniguez's half-time

status was insufficient for all the needs of
the community.
Describing the Chicano/Latino commu
nity as "very big and very active," Sweet
said the community needs help in getting
resources from the University, which is
"impossible for someone working half-time
to do."
Yniguez said the "real issue is that all
ethnic centers need more staffing." Yniguez
said his job at El Centro is "extremely
difficult" partly because he only works half
time and also because of the growth of the
Chicano/Latino community.
The Asian American Students' Associa
tion is also looking to receive a full-time
dean.
Last year, Julian Low, assistant dean of
the Asian American Activities Center, was
appointed on a half-time basis. Agreeing
with Yniguez, Low said working only half
time last year made his tasks "difficult to
accomplish."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said that when the minority student centers
were first established, the University
decided that part-time deans were sufficient
for meeting the needs of the ethnic com
munities.
As the centers expanded and as the needs
