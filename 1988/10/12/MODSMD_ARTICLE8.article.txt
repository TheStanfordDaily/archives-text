# Full-time ethnic deans under consideration
## 
### Ken Yew Staff writer 
After over 10 years of struggle with Uni
versity officials, minority organizations at
Stanford may soon get full-time deans
devoted to working with specific minority
groups.
According to Michael Jackson, associate
dean of Student Affairs, the University is
conducting an investigation to determine

the needs of both the Asian
American and Chicano/
Latino communities for
full-time assistant deans.
Both of these ethnic groups
have been fighting for
years to have full-time
deans appointed.
An assistant dean work
ing with these minority
groups would help provide

advice and University support for commu
nity programs and act as a liason between
the University and the students, Jackson
said.
The El Centro Chicano/Latino commu
nity center received a half-time assistant
dean, Juan Yniguez, four years ago, said
MEChA press representative Alejandro
Sweet. MEChA is a Chicano student group.
But Sweet said Yniguez's half-time

status was insufficient for all the needs of
the community.
Describing the Chicano/Latino commu
nity as "very big and very active," Sweet
said the community needs help in getting
resources from the University, which is
"impossible for someone working half-time
to do."
Yniguez said the "real issue is that all
ethnic centers need more staffing." Yniguez
said his job at El Centro is "extremely
difficult" partly because he only works half
time and also because of the growth of the
Chicano/Latino community.
The Asian American Students' Associa
tion is also looking to receive a full-time
dean.
Last year, Julian Low, assistant dean of
the Asian American Activities Center, was
appointed on a half-time basis. Agreeing
with Yniguez, Low said working only half
time last year made his tasks "difficult to
accomplish."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said that when the minority student centers
were first established, the University
decided that part-time deans were sufficient
for meeting the needs of the ethnic com
munities.
As the centers expanded and as the needs


Jackson
of the communities grew, minor
ity groups proposed that the Uni
versity appoint more active deans
to help meet increased workloads.
But Lyons said that appointing
full-time deans isn't always the
solution to meeting students'
needs.
"There's no one response for
each situation," said Lyons, add
ing that sometimes it may be
more effective to hire additional
staff or new full-time staff.
Over the summer, a number of
student groups, including the
Asian American Students' Associ
ation, the Black Student Union,
MEChA and the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization pres
sured the University to appoint

full-time deans. The University
responded by appointing a full
time dean, Keith Archuleta, to
direct the Black Community Serv
ices Center and by promoting Low
to three-quarters' time status.
Jackson said the University is
trying to "respond to each indi
vidual case" to determine what
level of support the student
groups need. *He said the Univer
sity won't provide full-time deans
"just because people ask for it,"
but he added that student re
quests are an important consid
eration.
The University is currently
having discussions with El Centro
to determine whether appointing
a full-time dean would be appro
priate for meeting the needs of
the Chicano/Latino community,
Jackson said.
Appointing a full-time dean is
an option that will be "considered

strongly," he said, adding that a
decision should be reached by the
start of next quarter.
Jackson said the University is
also discussing the possibility of
appointing a full-time dean for
AASA. AASA recently made a
report on the needs of the Asian-
American community that "helps
provide further foundation" for a
full-time dean, according to Jack
son.
Archuleta said the drive by stu
dent minority groups, particularly
black and Chicano/Latino groups,
for full-time deans started in the
early 19705.
In 1978, the University pro
vided the BCSC with a half-time
dean. Student pressure and the
help of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and the Rain
bow Agenda caused the University
to grant a full-time dean this year

to the BCSC, said Archuleta.
He added that there wasn't a
full-time dean in the first place
because "the University did not
value the role of the (BCSC)" at
that time. However, as time went
on, University administrators
"grudgingly accepted the center
as an institution," Archuleta said.
Sweet said deans working with
minority centers were only given
part-time status because the Uni
versity considered such positions
less presitigious than other Uni
versity offices. He said a "racist
argument" prevented these deans
from gaining the respect they
deserve.
Jackson admitted that such
views are held by certain people
in the Stanford community and
called such an opinion a "tragedy."
He added that work in the ethnic
community is "vital to Stanford."

nity as "very big and very active," Sweet
said the community needs help in getting
resources from the University, which is
"impossible for someone working half-time
to do."
Yniguez said the "real issue is that all
ethnic centers need more staffing." Yniguez
said his job at El Centro is "extremely
difficult" partly because he only works half
time and also because of the growth of the
Chicano/Latino community.
The Asian American Students' Associa
tion is also looking to receive a full-time
dean.
Last year, Julian Low, assistant dean of
the Asian American Activities Center, was
appointed on a half-time basis. Agreeing
with Yniguez, Low said working only half
time last year made his tasks "difficult to
accomplish."
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said that when the minority student centers
were first established, the University
decided that part-time deans were sufficient
for meeting the needs of the ethnic com
munities.
As the centers expanded and as the needs


Jackson
of the communities grew, minor
ity groups proposed that the Uni
versity appoint more active deans
to help meet increased workloads.
But Lyons said that appointing
full-time deans isn't always the
solution to meeting students'
needs.
"There's no one response for
each situation," said Lyons, add
ing that sometimes it may be
more effective to hire additional
staff or new full-time staff.
Over the summer, a number of
student groups, including the
Asian American Students' Associ
ation, the Black Student Union,
MEChA and the Stanford Amer
ican Indian Organization pres
sured the University to appoint

full-time deans. The University
responded by appointing a full
time dean, Keith Archuleta, to
direct the Black Community Serv
ices Center and by promoting Low
to three-quarters' time status.
Jackson said the University is
trying to "respond to each indi
vidual case" to determine what
level of support the student
groups need. *He said the Univer
sity won't provide full-time deans
"just because people ask for it,"
but he added that student re
quests are an important consid
eration.
The University is currently
having discussions with El Centro
to determine whether appointing
a full-time dean would be appro
priate for meeting the needs of
the Chicano/Latino community,
Jackson said.
Appointing a full-time dean is
an option that will be "considered

strongly," he said, adding that a
decision should be reached by the
start of next quarter.
Jackson said the University is
also discussing the possibility of
appointing a full-time dean for
AASA. AASA recently made a
report on the needs of the Asian-
American community that "helps
provide further foundation" for a
full-time dean, according to Jack
son.
Archuleta said the drive by stu
dent minority groups, particularly
black and Chicano/Latino groups,
for full-time deans started in the
early 19705.
In 1978, the University pro
vided the BCSC with a half-time
dean. Student pressure and the
help of the University Committee
on Minority Issues and the Rain
bow Agenda caused the University
to grant a full-time dean this year

to the BCSC, said Archuleta.
He added that there wasn't a
full-time dean in the first place
because "the University did not
value the role of the (BCSC)" at
that time. However, as time went
on, University administrators
"grudgingly accepted the center
as an institution," Archuleta said.
Sweet said deans working with
minority centers were only given
part-time status because the Uni
versity considered such positions
less presitigious than other Uni
versity offices. He said a "racist
argument" prevented these deans
from gaining the respect they
deserve.
Jackson admitted that such
views are held by certain people
in the Stanford community and
called such an opinion a "tragedy."
He added that work in the ethnic
community is "vital to Stanford."
After over 10 years of struggle with Uni
versity officials, minority organizations at
Stanford may soon get full-time deans
devoted to working with specific minority
groups.
According to Michael Jackson, associate
dean of Student Affairs, the University is
conducting an investigation to determine

the needs of both the Asian
American and Chicano/
Latino communities for
full-time assistant deans.
Both of these ethnic groups
have been fighting for
years to have full-time
deans appointed.
An assistant dean work
ing with these minority
groups would help provide

advice and University support for commu
nity programs and act as a liason between
the University and the students, Jackson
said.
The El Centro Chicano/Latino commu
nity center received a half-time assistant
dean, Juan Yniguez, four years ago, said
MEChA press representative Alejandro
Sweet. MEChA is a Chicano student group.
But Sweet said Yniguez's half-time

status was insufficient for all the needs of
the community.
Describing the Chicano/Latino commu
nity as "very big and very active," Sweet
said the community needs help in getting
resources from the University, which is
"impossible for someone working half-time
to do."
Yniguez said the "real issue is that all
