# Report on minority life in final stages
## Committee 'delighted' by student's high response rate to survey 
### Amy Rosenfeld Staff writer 
Although data analysis from the
University Committee on Minor
ity Issues' survey is not yet com
plete, committee members said
they were "delighted" by the 77
percent student-response rate.
The fact that so many students
responded "tells the committee
that these are important issues"
and that the students are con
cerned, said Prof. A 1 Camarillo,
chair of the committee.
According to Camarillo, the sur
vey has "entered the final proc
ess" in over a year of research
and study of minority life at Stan
ford.
He said the committee plans to
submit its final report to the pres
ident's office in late December or
early January. The report was
originally scheduled to be submit
ted in October.
Of the 1,700 students randomly
selected, 77 percent responded to
the "very detailed and very long"
surveys, Camarillo said.
Students were asked to fill out
an 84-item questionnaire dealing
with various facets of student life
at Stanford. The 24-page docu
ment covered curriculum, Stan
ford student services, community
activities and issues, extracur
riculars, overseas campuses, res
idences, and interpersonal rela
tionships between both minority
and majority students at Stanford.
Camarillo said the information
will provide "baseline data on eth-

Nic relations" for the University.
Not only is this the "first time
the University has ever engaged
in a systematic survey of student's
views" on this issue, "nothing like
this has ever been done anywhere
in the United States," he said.

The committee
is charged with
"assess[ingl the
institutional envi
ronment of people
of color at Stan
ford" and moving
"further toward
policies and prac
tices that imple
ment the Univer-

sity's commitment to a genuinely
pluralistic community."
Surveys were also randomly
sent to 300 faculty members by
SRI International, an independent
research group, Camarillo said.
The faculty survey yielded a 70
percent response rate for non
minority faculty and a 77 percent
rate for minorities. An additional
survey will be sent to staff mem
bers in December, the results of
which will be submitted in March
as an addendum to the report.
The committee was formed in
the spring of 1987 by University
President Donald Kennedy and
Provost James Rosse in response
to demands by minority groups
that the University improve
campus minority life.
The nearly completed report
will include the data and infor
mation the committee has collec
ted, assessments of the issues and

problems at Stanford and recom
mendations and suggestions for
implementation of those sugges
tions.
Besides surveying student and
faculty members, the committee
has also conducted interviews and
meetings with hundreds of stu
dents, faculty and staff over the
past year.
Senior Brian Kim, one of the
four student members on the 21-
person committee, said that al
though it is very difficult to say
exactly what the data shows until
all analysis is complete, "some of
the data does substantiate certain
things [the committee was]
looking for."
According to Camarillo, the
committee plans to continue their
bi-monthly meetings through
early December in addition to
holding three retreats in Novem
ber and December to review and
critique the final draft of the
report.
The committee plans to report
their findings to certain adminis
trative offices on campus and dif
ferent ethnic communities, Kim
said.
The committee is composed of
Stanford students, faculty and
staff as well as members of out
side community organizations.
The members are divided into five
working groups dealing with fac
ulty, student life, under
graduate/graduate admissions,
recruitment and retention, under
graduate curriculum and staff.
