It took two continents,
three countries,
and one man
to make our pizza.
Combining the hearty flavors of his
Hungarian heritage, the unique
character of American cuisine and an
onginal Italian recipe, Bela Kardos
created the Applewood pizza. A
remarkable orchestration of cheeses,
sauce, and toppings. All atop a light
and eggy crust that some say is the
best part of the pie.
A lot's gone into our pizza and you
can tell. Come taste an international
threat tonight at Applewood Inn. Or
call the nearest Applewood 2-Go.
It's not just pizza at Applewood.
