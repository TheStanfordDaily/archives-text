# Speakers Bureau readies for new year

### Dennis Lee 
Planning for UCLA basketball
coach John Wooden and novelist
John Updike to speak on campus
this November, the ASSU
Speakers Bureau is trying to con
duct business as usual — and
overcome the controversy that
arose last spring.
Current Speakers' director
Andrew Berke got off to an unusal
start last May when he was voted
in to replace Teri James, who had
brought a number of black
speakers to campus. The ASSU
rejected James when she reapplied
for the directorship on the
grounds that she did not bring to
campus enough interesting "head
liner" speakers.
The members of the Black Stu
dent Union and the ASSU Senate
Chair's task force charged the
ASSU with institutional racism.
Saying that the circumstances
that led to his acquiring the post
were regretable, Berke, a junior,
emphasized that "the controversy
has nothing to do with me."
According to Berke, his primary
goal as Speakers' Bureau director
is to bring interesting and in
formative speakers who may at
times spark controversy.
"Speakers are controversial be
cause they raise important is-

nothing to do with me/

sues," he said. Speakers will ad
dress important topics ranging
from the presidential election to
sports events, Berke said, adding
that he hoped to focus on multi
cultural issues this year as well.
Upcoming speakers include
Wooden, who will speak on Nov.
1, and Updike, scheduled to speak
on Nov. 18.
Kevin Wenick, a coordinator for
the Speakers' Bureau, said the
group chose Wooden for a sports
series that is running through the
year. Citing athletic drug abuse
as a topic worthy of exploration,
Wenick said he believed "some is
sues in sports lend themselves to
discussion among Stanford stu
dents."
The sports series began on a
tense note last week when A 1
Campanis, a former Los Angeles
Dodgers' general manager, came
to speak. Campanis, who gained
notoriety for making allegedly
racist comments on national tele-

vision and was consequently fired,
gave a general speech about base
ball in the '80s.
After the speech, BSU Chair
Mary Dillard said she was "really
annoyed" because she believed
Campanis avoided addressing his
past mistakes. Dillard said she
hoped that Campanis was not a
precursor for events to come.
"We (the BSU) are going to pay
attention to the programming,"
she said.
According to Lara Rosenthal,
assistant director of the Speakers'
Bureau, there was a change in
Campanis' contract. The
Speakers' Bureau originally chose
as a speaker to address the issue
of racism in sports, but his con
tract was changed to a general
discussion of baseball in the '80s,
Rosenthal said. She added that
the Speakers' Bureau was disap
pointed with his speech.
Rosenthal said the Speakers'
Bureau "doesn't shy away from
controversy. We want to promote
thought and discussion." She also
noted that the Speakers' Bureau
takes into account whether the
person will be "an engaging
speaker" in the selection process.
Some speakers who are being
considered for the future include
Elie Wiesel, a human rights ac
tivist, Javier Perez de Cuellar,
Secretary General of the United
Nations and Spike Lee, a well
known black film director.
In deciding who will speak, all
14 members of the Bureau have
equal input, according to Berke.
This year, the Bureau received
a total of $65,000 in fee assess
ments from the ASSU. Up to
$25,000 of this can go to a
speaker's honorarium. The
remaining money is used for other
expenses, such as transportation
of the speaker and room and
board.
To pay a speaker more than
$2,500 requires specific approval
from the Senate, Berke said.
