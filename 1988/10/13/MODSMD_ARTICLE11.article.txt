## Peru general quits Garcia ally resigns amid coup rumors 
### 
LIMA, Peru (AP) — A top gen
eral and close ally of President
Alan Garcia resigned his post, the
military said yesterday Another
general said his colleague was
forced out after privately warning
of a possible military coup.
A growing economic crisis in
Peru has produced widespread
rumors of a pending military
takeover, but both government
and military spokesmen have
publicly dismissed those rumors.
The joint military command
yesterday confirmed the resigna
tion of Gen. Victor Raul Silva,
commander of army operations at
Peru's disputed border with
Ecuador, but did not comment
further.
An army general, speaking on
condition his name not be used,
told The Associated Press that
Silva was made to resign because
he had warned that support for
a coup was growing within mili
tary circles. The general denied a
coup was being planned and said
Silva's charges had brought dis
honor to the armed forces.
La Republica, a Lima daily
linked to Peru's moderate left,
charged yesterday in an unat

tributed report that Silva's dis
cussion of a coup forced the mil
itary to abort a takeover last Sat
urday.
Silva served for two years as
military aide to Garcia, who began
a five-year term in July 1985.
The powerful military has
toppled three democratically
elected governments since 1948.
It last ruled from 1968 to 1980.
Harsh austerity measures im
posed by the center-left Garcia
government in early September to
slow inflation, growing at a record
annual rate of nearly 1,000 per
cent, have led to protests.
A one-day national strike to
protest the economic policy has
been called for today by the
Communist-run General Con
federation of Peruvian Workers,
the nation's most powerful labor
organization.
Violence surged on the eve of
the strike, as suspected leftist
guerrillas burned a city bus and
a student was shot and killed at
a campus protest.
Passengers said the assailants
identified themselves as members
of the Shining Path, a Maoist
guerrilla group.
