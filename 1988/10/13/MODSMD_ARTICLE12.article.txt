# Pinochet candidacy in open vote losing support

### 
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — The interior min
ister begged right-wingers yesterday to remain
united behind the government after major
desertions began following Chilean voters' re
jection last week of President Augusto Pinoc
net's regime.
National Renewal, the largest right-wing
party, said Tuesday night that a Pinochet
candidacy in the open election scheduled for
next year "has no chances whatsoever of suc
cess."
The Independent Democratic Union, a far
right party that was among Pinochet's
staunchest supporters in last week's plebiscite,
also dismissed a possible candidacy for the
72-year-old president and army commander.
On Oct. 5, Chileans were asked to vote
"yes" if they supported Pinochet remaining
in power until 1997, and "no" if they favored

open elections on Dec. 14, 1989. The general
took power in a bloody 1973 coup that deposed
an elected leftist government.
Last week's plebiscite resulted in 3.9 million
votes for the opposition and 3.1 million for
Pinochet.
Yesterday, Interior Minister Sergio Fernan
dez issued a written statement urging right
wing groups to stick with the government.
Fernandez went on national television to make
the same plea.
"We repeat our call on those who supported
the government in the referendum to remain
united because that is the basis of our
strength, which will be decisive for the future
of our nation," Fernandez said.
He insisted the government has no plans
to negotiate with the opposition, which is
proposing to change the constitutional

timetable to allow an earlier open presidential
election and Pinochet's departure from power.
Legal experts disagree on whether the 1980
Constitution allows Pinochet to be a candi
date. They contend that presidents cannot
succeed themselves.
The general, who remains secluded at an
army retreat near Santiago, has not com
mented on the issue. But he also has not
discouraged nationalist groups and military
and government officers who have suggested
he should run.
Those supporting a Pinochet candidacy point
at the strong personal support he got from
voters in the referendum.
Defense Minister Adm. Patricio Carvajal
said Pinochet could easily become a candidate
if he resigned shortly before the election in
favor of an interim president.
