# Candidates prepare for debate; Bush leads in poll
## 
### 
Neither George Bush nor Mi
chael Dukakis came in contact
with the voters yesterday, hud
dling instead with their handlers
to go over lines for today's second
and final presidential debate of
the campaign.
Bush, buoyed by an ABC News-
Washington Post poll giving him
a huge lead in electoral votes
nationwide, staged a brief made
for-television event before disap
pearing into his debate prepara
tion meetings. He invited Los An
geles Police Chief Daryl Gates in
for breakfast in a subtle continua
tion of his effort to make crime
control a central theme of his can
didacy.
The vice president told
reporters he intended to show the
country "what my heartbeat is"
during his face-to-face clash with
Dukakis and said he would con

tinue depicting his rival as a
liberal. Bush also attended the
National League playoff game be
tween the Los Angeles Dodgers
and New York Mets after wrap
ping up his debate preparation for
the day.
He shared a box with his wife,
Barbara, Dodger owner Peter
O'Malley, and campaign chairman
James Baker 111.
Democrat Dukakis had baseball
on his mind as well as he inter
rupted his debate homework to
play catch with an aide while pho
tographers recorded the scene. Re
ferring to the first presidential
debate and the one last week be
tween running mates, he said,
"We're ahead 2-0; we're going to
make it a clean sweep."
Dukakis will need a clean sweep
to overcome the kind of lead that
Bush has in the newest poll, which

surveyed 10,000 likely voters from
Sept. 21 through Monday.
ABC reported that Bush led
solidly in 21 states with a total
of 220 electoral votes — just 50
short of the total needed to win.
Dukakis was firmly ahead in only
three states and the District of
Columbia with 30 electoral votes.
With the election nearly a
month off, voter sentiments can
change. But the ABC-Post poll,
the only public survey of its size
this year, was the first recent poll
to indicate a significant advantage
for either candidate.
The poll's margins of error
varied with their differing sample
size in each state. ABC did not
disclose those margins. Given the
size of the overall sample, the
sample in individual states and
the District of Columbia would
average 192, for which the sam

pling error would be about 10
points.
Dukakis described his debate
repertoire in baseball lingo, as
well, saying he would use a "fast
ball, curve, slider — maybe a
knuckler" during his 90 minutes
on stage.
Workers in Los Angeles erected
a debate-night set — wooden lec
terns, red carpet and telegenic
blue background — that was
trucked in from Omaha, where it
was used in last week's vice pres
idential debate. The debate begins
at 6 p.m. PDT on the UCLA
campus in Los Angeles.
Bush goes into the 90-minute
encounter with a modest lead in
the public opinion polls, although
Dukakis appears to have cut into
the Republican advantage since
last week's vice presidential
debate.
