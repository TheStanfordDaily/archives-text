# Stones to bullets
## Shift seen in Palestinian tactics 
### 
JERUSALEM (AP) - Soldiers
blew up four Palestinian homes
and sealed five others yesterday
in reprisal for the murder of
Arabs who collaborated with Is
rael. Palestinians hurled a
grenade at a troop bus but missed.
Noting an increased use of guns
and grenades by Palestinian ac
tivists, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin suggested there had been
a shift in Palestinian tactics from
stones to more sophisticated
weapons.
"Once they shift from civilian
violence to terror for me it is proof
that they failed to achieve their
goals by what they call the in
tefadeh," Rabin said, using the
Arabic word for uprising.
But clashes continued in the oc
cupied territories. Israel radio re
ported seven Palestinians
wounded, four in the West Bank
and three in the Gaza Strip.
In the Gaza Strip, sources said
a grenade was thrown between a
bus carrying soldiers and a civil
ian car. The army said no injuries
resulted, and soldiers sealed the
area and detained a number of
Palestinians.
A day earlier, a grenade was
thrown at an army jeep, wounding
two soldiers in the legs.
Rabin, speaking to a Foreign
Press Association luncheon, noted
yesterday's incident was the third
time grenades had been hurled in
the recent days and that a village
leader had been shot to death with
an assault rifle by PLO enforcers.
He said terror attacks had
declined in the occupied lands in
the past 10 months as Palestinian
activists focused on large-scale
demonstrations and stone
throwing confrontations.
But the defense minister said
the army had succeeded in stop

ping big protests and in recent
days there had been a upsurge in
the use of bullets, bombs and
grenades.
"It represents a failure by them
to create a number of violent in
cidents by simple means, and
therefore a beginning by this
small group to return to terror
as it was used in the past," Rabin
said.
The army did not identify the
group behind the latest grenade
attacks, but Arab journalists in
the Gaza Strip said rumors cir
culated that the attacks were the
work of Islamic militants.
Palestinian sources said Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Or
ganization was not involved.
PLO leaders have said Pales
tinian protesters had access to
weapons but had been instructed
not to use them in confrontations
with Israelis.
The restraint has won Palestin
ians international sympathy, and
the embargo on terror is an es
sential ingredient for any
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue after
Israel's Nov. 1 general election.
Rabin said he believed the use
of bullets by Palestinians may be
an effort to prod PLO leaders into
taking a stand politically on ne
gotiations with Israel.
But many of the recent
casualties have coincided with
stepped-up arrest raids and the
introduction of plastic bullets.
Since the beginning of the
month, 15 Palestinians have been
killed and scores wounded, raising
the overall death toll to 295 since
the uprising began Dec. 8.
Ten suspected Arab collabators
with Israeli authorities have been
killed since last December, includ
ing three who were stabbed to
death in recent weeks in Nablus,
