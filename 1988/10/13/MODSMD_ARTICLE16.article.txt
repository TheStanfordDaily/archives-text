Reform vote ahead for Algeria
ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) — President Chadli
Bendjedid yesterday announced a referendum on
political reforms that would end the ruling party's
grip on power. The move followed a week of
bloody riots against government policy.
But new violence was reported.
A state of emergency and curfew imposed Fri
day were lifted at dawn yesterday. Almost 12
hours later, however, shooting broke out in the
provincial city of Tizi-Ouzou and about 10 people
were killed, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse reported.
Government officials and Algeria's ambassador
to France, Messaoud Ait-Chaalal, later denied
any deaths occurred in Tizi-Ouzo.
The government has said about 180 people died
in violent protests since Oct. 4, but unofficial
totals set the toll at more than 500 dead and
more than 1,000 hurt.
It was the worst violence in this North African
nation's history.
AFP reported about 10 people died after a
clash between pro- and anti-Ben(tyedid demon
strators in Tizi-Ouzou. The city lies 60 miles
east of Algiers in the Kabylie region, dominated
by Berbers.
Japan's Hirohito losing strength
TOKYO (AP) — Emperor Hirohito, who has
been bedridden with intestinal hemorrhaging for
three weeks, has grown weaker as his anemia
and jaundice worsen, Imperial Palace officials
and news reports said yesterday.
Doctors gave the 87-year-old emperor more
blood in an attempt to reduce the anemia, said
Kenji Maeda, a spokesman for the Imperial
Household Agency.
Officials said Hirohito's strength was declining
because doctors were unable to supply enough

nutrients through intravenous feeding.
The emperor, the world's longest-reigning
monarch, has not been able to eat anything except
for two ice cubes and a few spoonfuls of porridge
since his condition worsened Sept. 19.
Although the emperor did not discharge any
blood yesterday, a Palace official said yesterday
he could not rule out the possibility of internal
bleeding from his intestine.
Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny
news reports that Hirohito has cancer in his
upper digestive system, and they have urged the
media to refrain from such speculation.
China announced that Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen has postponed a planned trip to Japan
because of the emperor's illness. Qian was to
visit Oct. 20-25 to mark the 10th anniversary of
a peace and friendship treaty between the two
countries.
Monument to women vets OK'd
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate gave voice
vote approval yesterday night to a bill authorizing
a monument to American women who served in
the Vietnam War.
The bill, approved earlier by the House, does
not specify the location of the memorial to the
10,000 American women who were in the nation's
longest war, other than to say it must be placed
somewhere in the Washington metropolitan area
The measure is a substitute for earlier legis
lation which had proposed the addition of a
nurse's statue to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
on the grassy mall that stretches from the Capitol
to the Lincoln Memorial.
That bill had been endorsed by the Senate in
June on a 96-1 vote, but was opposed by two of
the three federal agencies whose approval would
have been required. Critics said the addition of
another statue to the Vietnam memorial would
have violated the artistic integrity of one of the
city's most popular national monuments.
