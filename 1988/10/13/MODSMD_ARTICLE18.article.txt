Full-time deans for
ethnic student groups:
their time has come

THE CREATION of full-time
ethnic dean positions is an
idea whose time has come.
It is rather confusing why the
University seems so resistant to
address this concern of the minor
ity organizations. Structural ad
justments must be made now to
incorporate these growing commu
nities into the Stanford family.
In anything less than a half-time
capacity, many of the deans cannot
meet the needs of their communi
ties. Frustration has come from
both the deans and members of
these communities of color about
too many needs and too little time.
The responsibilities of the ethnic
deans range from student group
adviser, to department head, to
liaison to the outside world, to ac
ademic adviser, to friend and role
model. The deans are currently on
call 24 hours a day and can work
well beyond the full-time 40 hour
work week.
With full-time deans, one of the
principal role models in the com

munities will be much more acces
sible to students. More attention
will be paid to the nurturing and
development of the student groups
in that community, and unity and
coordination within the com
munites will be enhanced.
The deans also will serve as a
valuable resource for the campus
as a whole. They will be available
to answer questions of various in
dividuals, groups and institutions,
taking some of the burden off of
the few students of color in the
various dorms.
Too often students of color are
made to be "ambassadors of the
race" and have to answer all of
the questions pertaining to their
history, heritage and culture.
There should be institutional
mechanisms to transmit that kind
of knowledge, and full-time deans
will play a critical role in filling
that need.
Minority groups are valuable
and respected members of the
campus community who are trying
to make this place more comfort
able for students from their back
ground. As they succeed in
improving the campus environ
ment for students of color, all ben
efit.
The University should recognize
this and be quicker in responding
to this vital concern.
