## Council of Presidents open about supporting union 
### 
WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
for The Stanford Daily. To
begin with, what exactly is
wrong with the Council of Presidents
supporting workers' efforts to gain a
just contract? Do they feel the United
Stanford Workers contract proposals
are unreasonable? Or do they just feel
that students should not involve them
selves with anything that has to do
with workers?
We do support the Stanford workers
because we feel that many of the
administration's contract proposals
would deny legitimate rights to
workers and that the USW is asking
for very reasonable improvements in
the contract. We also feel that many
students support us in this position.
For some reason, The Daily seems to
be quite enraged about the COP's
support for the USW, which is trying
to achieve a fair contract, and has
launched an attack on us in their Oct.
10 editorial. "Define your roles." This
editorial distorts and omits critical
facts which this letter will seek to
clarify. But, more importantly, The
Daily seems to have missed the central
message of "The Fire Within" and of
our slate: that students should respect
all, including those who really make
this university run â€” the Stanford
workers.
The Daily argues that our support
for USW is inappropriate, that even
though we were elected on a "strongly
political platform," students did not
know we would be involved in support
ing workers. They further accuse us of
attempting to hide the fact that Stacey
Leyton is a member of the negotiating
team (a "cunning political move," in
their words).
We resent The Daily's accusations.
We have made no attempt to hide our
support for the USW or the fact that
one of our members is serving on the

USW negotiating team. In fact, we are
proud of this. If they had read their
own newspaper over the summer and
into the fall, they would have also seen
that we have continually been open
and forthright about our support for
the union. COP members have consis- ,
tently and publicly stated our position
on the union negotiations, and in fact
we carefully detailed our position in
our welcome to the students in the
first Autumn issue of The Daily ("An
Active Council of Presidents Welcomes
Students," The Daily, 9-26-88).
We ran for office on a platform that
promised to work to democratize this
university so that all people receive
respectful and just treatment. We don't
think that the students who voted for
our slate meant for us to extend this
respect and democracy to everyone
except the workers. We have faith that
the msgority of students on this
campus support fair treatment of all
people. And we believe we are repre
senting that sentiment when we sup
port the workers. We also know that
the administration is doing the best
that it can to hide the facts of negotia
tions from the students by refusing to
allow observers or tape recordings of
sessions or even debates between the
two sides. And we are attempting to
fulfill our obligation to bring informa
tion to students through arranging
educational programs on the USW
issue.
As The Daily acknowledged in a
correction Tuesday, the five students
on the negotiationg team are not
members of the union, which The
Daily asserted in its editorial. They are
participating on the USW negotiating
team as students, not as union mem
bers.
The union invited us to play this
role because many contract issues have

a great impact on students, especially
students who work. If there is a safety
problem in the kitchen, it affects stu
dent hashers. If food service is con
tracted out to an outside corporation,
it affects students who must eat dor
mitory food and suffer from a decline
in quality. If the union has a proposal
which would unintentionally eliminate
student laboratory jobs, it affects stu
dent workers. In fact, the impact of
contract proposals on students had
been a major issue in the 1985 negoti
ations. The union has invited us onto
their team because they want students
to inform them of how their proposals
would help and would hurt us. They
want our input (as opposed to the
administration, which walked out of
negotiations in an unsuccessful attempt
to force us out of the bargaining ses
sions). We should be grateful that the
USW values student opinion so highly.
In fact, three students served on the
USW negotiating team in 1985 and
contributed valuable information to the
team regarding the impact of USW
contract proposals on students. This
participation engendered no controversy
and no criticism by The Daily.
Secondly, The Daily claims that we
"perverted" the ASSU request for
neutral student observers by joining
the negotiating team. Again, The Daily
should check its facts. If they examined
the minutes from the ASSU Senate
meeting where this request was made,
they would see that the COP never hid
our support for USW; we in fact made
it very clear. They would also see that
we sought to establish a process within
the ASSU to develop guidelines and
select neutral student observers; we
then proposed this concept and process
to President Kennedy. Had the ad
mininstration agreed to our request,
we believe that all five students who
are now on the USW team would not

have been chosen to be the five neutral
observers; after all, they're not neutral
and they don't claim to be. And the
USW still would have chosen students
to participate actively as members of
their bargaining team, with or without
neutral observers present. The two
issues (neutral observers and student
members of the USW team) are
seperate; the only link is that both
involve students and both are opposed
by the administration.
We are greatly offended by the
mean-spirited accusations that pervade
the editorial. Claiming we made a
"cunning political move" at "The Fire
Within" and that we are serving as
"the public relations branch of the
USW" are accusations that are highly
inappropriate, particularly when they
are made based on misinformation.
It is irresponsible to claim that one
of our members has joined the union,
that we had formerly pretended to be
neutral in the negotiations, or that we
"consciously and cunningly" hid our
support for the union without speaking
with us about these issues. We will
gladly clear up any inaccuracies that
may cloud the writer's perceptions of
the nature of the issue.
In a front page story in the Oct. 10
issue of The Daily, Kennedy notes that
student involvement in negotiations has
not hindered progress in any way. Yet
The Daily supports management's
protests that student involvement
would cause a "circus-atmosphere."
Again, without explanation.
And so we ask, what is wrong with
expressing our support for a just con
tract for Stanford workers?
