# Financial aid delay hits students
## Graduate students' stipends slowed by department's late applications 
### Baldwin Lee 
Many graduate students have
not received their stipend checks
this quarter because of an un
usually large number of late fi
nancial aid requests.
Stipend checks compensate stu
dents for their work as teaching
assistants and researchers. With
out these checks, students found
themselves unable to pay food and
rent bills and were forced to ask
for emergency checks from the
Bursar's Office.
For two weeks the Office of
Graduate Awards closed during
its morning hours in order to
catch up with the backlog. Susan
Haradon, assistant dean of Grad
uate Awards, said "We under
stand it's hard on the students
when the check isn't there at reg
istration."
All of the overdue checks should
be available Monday either in each

student's department or at the
Graduate Awards Office, she said.
Graduate Awards had trouble
processing the aid requests be
cause almost every department
turned in late requests, said
Haradon, who also cited the loss
of an experienced staff member
who helped handle such requests.
When the School of Humanities
and Social Sciences notified its
departments this August of cuts
in graduate support programs,
several departments were forced
to make last-minute budget
changes. This delayed the depart
ments' submission of aid requests,
which were to be due July 29.
This late notification caused
particular disarray because cuts
in graduate support have not been
typical or expected by the depart
ments. According to Edwenna
Werner, an Economics Depart
ment administrator, the graduate
support budget had not been cut

in the recent past and the depart
ment operating budget, which was
submitted last spring, "is usually
approved much ahead of time."
Tomi-Anne Roberts, a graduate
student in psychology, said she
was promised her stipend check
on Sept. 26 and did not receive
it until almost two weeks later.
"That first stipend check is like
a gold mine after [a month! of
not getting paid. There is a gap
between the last summer check
and the first one in the fall,"
Roberts said.
According to History Depart
ment secretary Lorraine Sinclair,
some delayed checks occur every
fall due to large amounts of paper
work, student confusion in filling
out complicated forms and re
cently established tax and immi
gration laws. However, Psychol
ogy Department secretary Linda
Heider said that it was this year's
influx of late aid requests that

"overloaded Graduate Awards in
all areas and in all facets."
Departments that have been
having noticeable problems with
delayed checks were Economics,
Humanities Special Programs and
Psychology. Heider estimated that
12 psychology graduate students
did not receive their checks on
time.
The Network for Student Infor
mation (NSI) handles the distri
bution by computer of all stipend
checks. This is the same computer
network that distributes Univer
sity bills. However, when Tomi-
Anne Roberts became upset at the
tardiness of her check, her check
was hand-typed at Encina Hall
after she received help from Betty
Frischmann, accountant at the
Controller's Office.
Haradan said that the NSI sys
tem should be working by this
week and graduate students
should begin to receive checks.
