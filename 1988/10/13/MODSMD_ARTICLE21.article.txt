## Seniority is no excuse 
### 
AL CAMPANIS' RECENT VISIT to
Stanford seemed to confirm that
he is not only a racist but also a
sexist.
Apparently during his speech, Cam
panis addressed, specifically, the "ladies"
and the "girls" in the audience when
explaining the basic rules of baseball, and
thus he suggested that females know
nothing about the Ail-American sport.
This attitude can be attacked as offen
sive and inappropriate because Campanis
is perpetuating a gender stereotype. This
attitude can also be dismissed as one of
a man brought up in a different genera
tion who is unintentionally and unknow
ingly offending much of today's gener
ation.
This second tendency to excuse preju
dice and insensitivity because of one's
age or background is all too common and
very frightening, and it needs to be ad
dressed.
We are taught in our society, as I think
in most others as well, to respect our
elders. The fifth commandment of the
Bible tells us to Honor our fathers and
mothers.
Wisdom is something we expect only
to acquire with age and experience, and
we look to those before us, our parents,
teachers, coaches, etc. . for their wise
advice and example. But what should we
do when the advice we are given offends
us or disturbs us?
How should we approach an older and
intimidating person with an argument or
accusation? Should we allow a person to
be racist, sexist or offensive in any way
because she or he was raised in a different

era?
In theory, I insist "No, we should not
excuse such behavior;" in action, I have
unfortunately not been so strong-willed
This summer the father of a close
friend of mine made a disparaging remark
about an ethnic group. I heard the
remark, registered it, and then made a
conscious decision not to challenge him
on it.
I was a guest in his house for dinner,
and I did not want to create an uncom
fortable situation for my friend or, more
likely, for myself. The moment passed
and the remark appeared to be forgotten,
or even worse, unnoticed, but I didn't
forget it, and I didn't forgive myself
either.
I should have challenged my friend's
father, or at least told him I found his
remark an offensive generalization. I
should have risked a few minutes of ten
sion and awkwardness to assert that
open-mindedness and liberalism I claim
to hold so strongly.
For what are my beliefs and convictions
if I am too intimidated to express them?
I think my biggest fault lay in my
assumption that I could not change the
attitude of someone who had probably
held that same attitude for the past 50
years; and therefore, the inevitable
awkwardness was not worth it to me.
That assumption is the wrong one to
hold. Older people are more likely to be
"set in their ways," but all people must
change their behavior, if not their beliefs,
with the changing times. George Bush
certainly cannot, or at least better not,

say "for the ladies," and neither can A 1
Campanis.
In today's multi-cultural world, I can
not make offensive ethnic remarks and
neither can my friend's father. And if he
does say something that I find offensive,
it is my responsibility to at the most
challenge and disagree with him, and at
the least ask him politely to refrain from
such remarks in my presence.
Hopefully the awkward moments will
occur and will add up and will become
embarrassing, eventually causing him to
think before he speaks.
Challenging one another and ourselves
is essential for human progress and
achievement. Somehow, though, it always
seems harder to challenge those ahead of
us than our peers. How dare those with
little experience question those with years
of experience!
What is my knowledge or opinion in
comparison to that of my parents or their
parents? Maybe it is miniscule or maybe
it is enormous, but I'll never know until
I assert my beliefs. And next time I need
to assert those beliefs, for I will never
be happy with myself until I know that
I have challenged those who needed to
be challenged, regardless of what gener
ation they were from.
