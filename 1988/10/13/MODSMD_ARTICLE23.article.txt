## Ethnic groups also support the union 
### 
We are writing in response to your
Oct. 10 editorial which incorrectly ac
cused the Council of Presidents of not
representing the student body and of
using the "Fire Within" program as a
"cunning political move." On Oct. 6,
The Daily noted that students from the
four ethnic communities marched with
the USW throughout the campus in
support of a fair contract. Likewise,
when members of the USW stood on
stage during the Freshman Orientation
"Fire Within" program, they were
joined by hundreds of black, Asian-
American, American Indian and
Chicano students singing "Lean On
Me."
From these facts, how can The Daily
accuse the COP members of not repre
senting the student body — unless, of
course, The Daily does not consider us
a part of the Stanford community?
Moreover, it was not the decision of
the COP to include the workers as
part of the "Fire Within" program;
members of our communities made
this decision.
The struggle we undertake as ethnic
students is historically, politically and
culturally linked to the struggles of
workers. To present our communities
to new students without recognizing
the workers would be disrespectful and
would again incorrectly portray our
"Stanford family."
Our commitment to workers is not
new to us; it should not come as a
surprise to a "captive freshman audi
ence" particularly since Frosh Orienta

tion is supposed to create an awareness
of current issues ami concerns on
campus. One of the main issues taken
up by the Asian American Students
Association last year was the reinstate
ment of Long Quach, a Stanford
worker and Vietnamese immigrant who
was treated unfairly at work. MEChA
has a 20-year history of community
involvement and worker support as
evidenced by the Watsonville and
Salinas strikes, as well as the current
UFW grape boycott. This summer, the
Black Student Union joined in a picket
at ID mail to show support for
workers whose manager had stated he
"would rather hire a white." The an
nual Powwow, sponsored by the Stan
ford American Indian Organization,
brings together members of our com
munity in a united celebration of our
culture.
The ideology which bonds our groups
so that we can present programs such
as "The Fire Within" is our shared
commitment to democracy and em
powerment for all people.
We appreciate the fact that the COP
helped sponsor our program, but it is
a mistake to assert that they manip
ulated the content of "The Fire
Within" for their own political needs.
A strike is more than a "political
move"; helping to spread information
in order to avoid a strike is a positive
endeavor which benefits all students.
