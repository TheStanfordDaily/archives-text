Wannabee: n., a tall, beady-eyed animal
prevalent in North America, known for
its grooming habits. The wannabee
spends the majority of its time improving
its image, taking polls and building up
its resume. Often vociferous but usually
a background player, the wannabee's dis
tinct mating call can be heard every other
year in October.
Wannadoo: n., a distinguished animal
once dominant in North America, but
now an endangered species. The wan
nadoo works for and is proud of ac
complishments, not titles and recognition.
The wannadoo leads through actions, not
words. See also cowboy, entrepreneur.
THE LAST QUESTION was the
most important one in the Vice
presidential debate: (paraphrased)
"What single event in your life has most
shaped your philosophy?"
Dan Quayle mentioned a phrase his
grandmother told him — a phrase most
of us have heard many times. "If you
work hard enough, you can be whatever
you want to be." This philosophy, he
noted, is what drove him to run for the
House and to eventually become a
Senator.
Lloyd Bentsen, on the other hand, men
tioned his early life on the Rio Grande
— a place where he lived among the
impoverished and learned the local lan
guage.
This experience, he said, led him to
found a non-profit bank that has played
an important role in revitalizing the de
pressed regions of Texas. Eventually, he
became involved in politics in order to

more effectively solve the problems.
George Bush has said "I wannabee
known as the Education President." Dur
ing his first year in office, the Reagan-
Bush team tried to eliminate the cabinet
level Department of Education. In the
past eight years, the Administration has
assaulted Pell Grants and college work
loans.
For the first time, graduate student
stipends are being taxed. Federal support
for university renovation and capital
equipment is at a 20-year low. George
Bush will not be remembered as "the
Education Vice-president."
Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, on
the other hand, have been improving the
education systems in their respective
states for many years. Texas A&M must
be considered a model public university
and the educational resources of Massa
chusetts are well known.
What do they wannadoo? Improve the
college loan program to make it both
fiscally sound and available to all Amer

icans. Create a National Teaching Excel
lence Fund to provide college scholarships
to students who are willing to make a
commitment to teaching after they earn
their degrees.
George Bush has headed the Presi
dent's Commission on Drugs for eight
years. He talks about reducing crime once
he becomes President. What are his ac
complishments for the past eight years?
He has yet to mention a program that
has already been successfully implement
ed.
Mike Dukakis, on the other hand, has
often talked about his past performance.
Crime in Massachusetts has declined 13.4
percent from 1982-1986 (while it has in
creased 1.8 percent nationwide), the sec
ond largest crime drop of any state.
Drug use among high school students
in Massachusetts has declined much
faster than the national average: twice
as fast for all categories of drugs; five
times as fast as for cocaine.
Some people are involved in politics
primarily for personal gain, be it recogni
tion, personal profit, or simply ego
gratification. Others are involved prima
rily because they are working to solve
problems that beset their country.
Thomas Jefferson is often quoted because
of the articles he wrote, including the
Declaration of Independence. Who was
his successor as President?
People are remembered for their ac
complishments, not for their titles.
