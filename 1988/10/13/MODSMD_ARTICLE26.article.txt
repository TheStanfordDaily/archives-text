## Images of poverty and hope from war-ravaged Nicaragua Buddhist monk fasts for a spiritual and political peace 
### Reuben Granich 
jEditor's note: Reuben Granich, a second-year Med
i<£l School student, spent part of his summer in
Nicaragua compiling a photographic essay. He
trtveled there as a volunteer for the Palo Alto-
Skinford Medical Aid Committee, which sends sup
plies and helps fund several clinics in Nicaragua.
has also been instrumental in establishing
ad internship scholarship that will provide funds
faf two Medical School students to work in a hospital
ik. southwestern Nicaragua.
''PASMAC, which was formed in 1984, has sent
olrer $300,000 worth of medical aid to hospitals in
Nicaragua, and is establishing a program in El
Salvador. Granich said the Nicaraguan government
is .impressively trying to improve health care, but
b&ic needs continue to go unmet.

On day 38 of monk Hediki Sasemori's recent
40-day fast, a driving rainstorm forced a rifle
bearing young soldier to take refuge in the Buddhist
monk's sanctuary in downtown Managua, Nicara
gua.
Sasemari's bones showed through his taught,
tanned skin; he slipped the soldier a welcoming
smile.
A food vendor entered selling hot corn. She
brought with her the outside world, and made ev
ident the ironic situation the monk had created.
Her food and the soldier's rifle juxtaposed with the
monk's benign frailness illustrated the power and
purpose of his peaceful mission.
"And what is the man in orange doing?" asked
an elderly Nicaraguan woman at the monk's
rotunda. A 40-day fast for peace. "Ah, he will surely
die," as did her two sons during a contra attack,
she said.
She asked next why the United States was at
war with Nicaragua, and when the the fighting
would stop.
Sasemori smiled at the exchange and continued
chanting.
In August of 1945 more than 100,000 Japanese
died instantly in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Tens of
thousands more died in the following months and
thousands still die every year as a result of this
nuclear holocaust. In the midst of these ashes, the
Buddhist monastic order Nipponzan Myohoji began,
with the objective of working to establish "worldwide
peace" through increasing public consciousness of
the powers of nuclear weapons.
The Buddhist order continues their global efforts
today to bring a more peaceful demeanor to the
face of world affairs. Sasemori, a member of this
Buddhist order, recently completed his 40-day fast
for peace in Nicaragua.
On Aug. 6, he took up his vigil in the central
park of Managua, in the shadow of the National
Palace and the crumbling cathedral that was
destroyed during the earthquake of 1972.
Sasemori sat tranquilly on day 37 before a small
shrine as curious Nicaraguans and foreigners tenta
tively entered the pavilion to see the small man.
Some took pictures, some sat silently, some talked
of peace and the effects of the war. Sasemori
emanated a spiritual peace that is rare, if not im
possible, to find in the people of today's war-torn
Nicaragua.
The feeling in the streets of Managua is not one
of danger; there are military out in force but no
telltale small arms fire or shelling. The ambushes
occur in the mountains and reports of firefights
and burned-out buses filter back to the capital.

The war in Nicaragua is real, and in the capital
its effects are economic and material. The continuing
conflict is felt in the empty markets, deserted res
taurants and the crowded buses full of tense and
frustrated people.
Children now beg in the streets, a practice un
heard of only a few years earlier. Every conversation
gravitates to prices and salaries.
The Nipponzan Myohoji, in the years immediately
following Hiroshima's destruction, built their first
peace pagoda in Japan using simple tools and the
limited materials left over after the war. Since that
time, the order has built pagodas around the world,
including one in the northeastern United States.
Sasemori's ultimate goal is to build a peace pagoda

in Managua. Nonetheless, this will not be possible
while the Contra war still wages within a country
without peace itself, he said. His previous 21-day
fast in Nicaragua marked the 43rd anniversary of
Hiroshima, and linked that memory with his hopes
for the success of the Arias peace plan for Central
America.
His witness to peace amidst the turmoil and layers
of tension in Nicaragua symbolized a chance for
hope to many Nicaraguans, themselves presently
suffering from the effects of a nine-year-old war.
Sasemori said the scope of his mission extends
beyond Central American national boundaries. "My
fast represents a cry of protest against the diabolical
nature of war and the inhumanity of man toward
his fellow man."

On day 38 of monk Hediki Sasemori's recent
40-day fast, a driving rainstorm forced a rifle
bearing young soldier to take refuge in the Buddhist
monk's sanctuary in downtown Managua, Nicara
gua.
Sasemari's bones showed through his taught,
tanned skin; he slipped the soldier a welcoming
smile.
A food vendor entered selling hot corn. She
brought with her the outside world, and made ev
ident the ironic situation the monk had created.
Her food and the soldier's rifle juxtaposed with the
monk's benign frailness illustrated the power and
purpose of his peaceful mission.
"And what is the man in orange doing?" asked
an elderly Nicaraguan woman at the monk's
rotunda. A 40-day fast for peace. "Ah, he will surely
die," as did her two sons during a contra attack,
she said.
She asked next why the United States was at
war with Nicaragua, and when the the fighting
would stop.
Sasemori smiled at the exchange and continued
chanting.
In August of 1945 more than 100,000 Japanese
died instantly in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Tens of
thousands more died in the following months and
thousands still die every year as a result of this
nuclear holocaust. In the midst of these ashes, the
Buddhist monastic order Nipponzan Myohoji began,
with the objective of working to establish "worldwide
peace" through increasing public consciousness of
the powers of nuclear weapons.
The Buddhist order continues their global efforts
today to bring a more peaceful demeanor to the
face of world affairs. Sasemori, a member of this
Buddhist order, recently completed his 40-day fast
for peace in Nicaragua.
On Aug. 6, he took up his vigil in the central
park of Managua, in the shadow of the National
Palace and the crumbling cathedral that was
destroyed during the earthquake of 1972.
Sasemori sat tranquilly on day 37 before a small
shrine as curious Nicaraguans and foreigners tenta
tively entered the pavilion to see the small man.
Some took pictures, some sat silently, some talked
of peace and the effects of the war. Sasemori
emanated a spiritual peace that is rare, if not im
possible, to find in the people of today's war-torn
Nicaragua.
The feeling in the streets of Managua is not one
of danger; there are military out in force but no
telltale small arms fire or shelling. The ambushes
occur in the mountains and reports of firefights
and burned-out buses filter back to the capital.

The war in Nicaragua is real, and in the capital
its effects are economic and material. The continuing
conflict is felt in the empty markets, deserted res
taurants and the crowded buses full of tense and
frustrated people.
Children now beg in the streets, a practice un
heard of only a few years earlier. Every conversation
gravitates to prices and salaries.
The Nipponzan Myohoji, in the years immediately
following Hiroshima's destruction, built their first
peace pagoda in Japan using simple tools and the
limited materials left over after the war. Since that
time, the order has built pagodas around the world,
including one in the northeastern United States.
Sasemori's ultimate goal is to build a peace pagoda

in Managua. Nonetheless, this will not be possible
while the Contra war still wages within a country
without peace itself, he said. His previous 21-day
fast in Nicaragua marked the 43rd anniversary of
Hiroshima, and linked that memory with his hopes
for the success of the Arias peace plan for Central
America.
His witness to peace amidst the turmoil and layers
of tension in Nicaragua symbolized a chance for
hope to many Nicaraguans, themselves presently
suffering from the effects of a nine-year-old war.
Sasemori said the scope of his mission extends
beyond Central American national boundaries. "My
fast represents a cry of protest against the diabolical
nature of war and the inhumanity of man toward
his fellow man."
