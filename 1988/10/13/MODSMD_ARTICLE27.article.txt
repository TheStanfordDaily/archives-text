# Physics model helps prof. explain learning
## Spinning up or down to remember?

A glass of red wine may bring back fond
memories of a beautiful October night in
Paris. A favorite baseball cap may recall the
first home run in an old-timer's career.
This kind of "associative" thinking led Stan
ford Physics Prof. William Little to relate a
purely mechanical phenomenon with the func
tions of human memory.
The theories of Little have led to his being
described as a "futurist." And Little's model
of the brain is one example that fits this
description.
Instead of studying the biology of the brain,
Little has been studying the statistical me
chanics of a network of electrons, or a "spin
system" for nearly 15 years. His research on
electron systems as applied to neural networks
has led to an explanation of how learning
could work, and he has determined a possible
location for where memory resides in the
brain.
The study of neural networks has blossomed
into a hot area of research within the last

few years, drawing researchers from such di
verse fields as psychology and biology to
physics and electrical engineering.
"What I was trying to do was to see if I
could understand the way the brain might
work by analogy with another system," Little
said.
Little "mapped" a neural network model
onto a spin system and by analogy, he was
able to show how learning and recall could
take place.
Little showed that a pattern sent through
the spin system could later be "recalled" by
a recall cue. If the same pattern was sent
through again, that pattern would come back
out again. Recall can be thought of as a
recognition ability in the same way that after
a face is seen it can be recognized when seen
again.
"Associated recall" is another property that
Little is able to explain through his model.
If a pair of objects is memorized, then given
one of those objects as a cue, both of these
objects will be recalled-a very important aspect
of basic learning.
Perhaps most importantly, Little has even

determined where memory might be stored
in the brain. He found that it had to be
located in the synaptic junctions, the connect
ing regions between the cells of the nervous
system.
Little founded the network model of the
brain on a phenomenon known in physics as
the Ising spin. The Ising spin model describes
the interaction of electrons, negatively charged
atomic particles, based on their "spin." Spin
is a characteristic of subatomic particles that
is related to its magnetic interaction with
other particles.
Physicists have labeled two types of char
acteristic electron behavior as "spin up" and
"spin down."
Little bridged the gap between physics and
biology when he recognized a possible corre
spondence between these subatomic qualities
and the nervous system. He saw that spin
could apply to neurons, which are complex
cells of our nervous system that send and
receive sensory information."Spin up" could
represent a neuron just fired to relay a mes-
