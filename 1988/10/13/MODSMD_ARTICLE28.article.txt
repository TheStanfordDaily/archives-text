Contemporary Latin Ameri
cans are creating some of the
most beautiful, moving and
volitile works of fiction ever
written. Inspired to write by
intolerable conditions of polit
ical oppression, and drawing on
the rich poetic traditions of
their respective countries,
Latin American writers have
achieved a permanent place in
world literature.
The names Octavio Paz,
Carlos Fuentes, Pablo Neruda,
Jose Donoso and Garcia
Marquez are already well
known in the United States.
Last spring, in fact, Paz came
to read his poetry at Kresge

Auditorium.
But many students remain
unexposed to the poetry and
politics of Latin American fic
tion.
Recent events in Chile, how
ever, have underscored the fact
that we have a moral obligation
to become more intimately ac
quainted with Latin America
and its literary imagination.
In future weeks, the Books
Department will examine Latin
American literature and
politics. Watch for upcoming
reviews of books from and
about Columbia, Nicaragua
and Cuba.
