In 1973, Chile's President Sal
vador Allende was killed in a CIA
backed coup that initiated the au
thoritarian regime of Augusto
Pinochet. Under Pinochet, count
less Chilean citizens have been
isolated for political interrogation
and, whether immediately im
prisoned, tortured or executed,
they have generally never been
heard from again.
They have slowly become
known as "the disappeared ones."
It is this population of ghosts
that moves beneath the surface
of contemporary Chilean fiction
seeking its voice.
In Jos6 Donoso's most recent
novel, "Curfew," translated this
year by Alfred MacAdam, the au
thor balances the incomprehensi
ble weight of the disappeared ones
with an intimate psychological
narrative.
The story describes the 24
hours that surround the funeral
of Pablo Neruda's wife, Matilde.
As the wife of the late Nobel
Prize-winning poet, her funeral is
immediately recognized as a pow
erful or dangerous political sym
bol by the forces of the regime,
the Communist Party and revolu
tionary left-wing factions.
And yet, regardless of this po
litical backdrop, the novel focuses
on the desires and weaknesses of
the characters. Donoso constantly
presses his lyrical narrative
through the context of the polit
ical world to an apolitical realm
somewhere in the human con
sciousness.
For instance, even while a
young woman is being tortured
by the authorities, Donoso inter
weaves the scene with her mem
ories of childhood humiliations.
He draws our attention away from
the immediate time and place so
that we may better understand
the experience of humiliation in
and of itself.
On one level, it is a fantastic
achievement that Donoso can un
dermine the political implications
of the setting by writing a psy

chological novel. It suggests a uni
versal attention.
But at the same time, in reading
the novel, I feel like the character
Judit, who notes, "Enthusiasm for
the Chilean cause, meanwhile,
had shifted to other causes: Cen
tral America especially, because
in Chile the mass murders that
made front-page news had ceased,
to be replaced by this long, slow
pauperization, this chaos, this
fear that was not a Massacre of
the Innocents to keep the atten
tion of the outside world, this
agony that was too deep to move
the audience."
I feel that Donoso has shifted
the chaos out of his narrative in
order to headline individual intel
ligences and, as a result, I am not
nearly enough ill at ease.
In this 1983 novel, "Widows,"
translated by Stephen Kessler,
Ariel Dorfman balances this same
population of silence in Chile with
an entirely different mechanism:
a single detail of magic realism.
In general, this contemporary

... the arrival of
the bodies is the
only miracle ...

Latin American style of surreal
fiction might undermine a politi
cal novel. If one were to attempt
to describe a history of bloodshed
and oppression in the rich and
mysterious language of Marquez,
the mythology and poetry of the
country might be preserved at the
expense of political reality.
The totalitarian violence in
M&rquez's "The Autumn of the
Patriarch," for instance,
manifests itself so closely to sym
bolism that it seems to escape
condemnation.
In "Widows," however,
Dorfman introduces a single magi
cal fact, that in a small village

where the men have been system
atically removed by the authori
ties, a male body washes down
the river each day.
Each of the bodies are beaten
beyond recognition, as if by the
stones in the river bed, but each
day a woman claims that the body
on the sand is her father or her
husband or her son.
By isolating the magic so care
fully in his narrative, Dorfman
emphasizes the political nature of
his story rather than undermin
ing it. We slowly realize how the
arrival of the bodies is the only
miracle the women in the village
have left to pray for.
They no longer ask for political
freedom, or the lives of their kin,
only for the certainty of death
that is even gentler than hope of

Police used tear gas and water cannons against demonstrators celebrating the defeat of President
Pinochet in Chile's recent presidential referendum. Chilean literature has grown under this reality.
