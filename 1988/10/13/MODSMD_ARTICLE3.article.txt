# Concerns raised over alcohol policy
## Students urged to abide by University's party planning requirements

"You are your brother's
keeper," said Assoc. Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Norm Robinson to
dorm representatives who met
yesterday to discuss application
of Stanford's alcohol policy.
The University's current alcohol
policy holds individuals responsi
ble for their decisions about
drinking, but it also stresses
group responsibility, Robinson
said.
"We really need to look at the
human side of this. Until you've
had to call someone's family with
the bad news, you can't under
stand it,"he said.
California law and present Uni
versity policy forbids students un
der the age of 21 from consuming
alcohol. But the University

restriction would be eliminated if
a proposal drafted by Robinson
this summer is adopted. The pro
posal could become effective
before the school year ends.
The student leaders' main con
cern was whether they would be
held personally liable for students
under 21 who drink in University
residences. University and police
officials suggested ways that stu
dents can control parties and thus
limit their liability.
• Card everybody. Police Cap
tain Marvin Moore told students,
"If we have to come in because
of a problem, and you haven't
been carding, we could charge you
(with serving minors)."
• Limit alcohol. ''You should
run out of alcohol before the party
is over," Moore said. "It's not a
matter of a keg or a bottle of

wine, it's a matter of 30 or 40
kegs. Then it becomes a free-for
all." Parties with controlled
amounts of alcohol are less likely
to be broken up, he said.
• Party inside. Moore said that
minors spotted walking around
campus with alcohol will be
stopped by police and cited. He
said police prefer "to pick off the
loose ends" and to "keep the in
dividuals on their own hooks."
• Register parties. If police are
informed in advance of a party,
they can help control it if it gets
out of hand, Moore said. Police
"will give you an opportunity to
resolve problems" if the party is
registered but at unregistered
parties would take "a hard-line
stand and crack it down."
Furthermore, when noise com
plaints are filed, the police may

be more lenient with registered
parties. He said police would more
likely react with the attitude that
"Yeah, it's noisy, but it's a party."
A student representative, how
ever, questioned Moore's guaran
tees about registered parties,
stating that last year a registered
party at Cedro was shut down
while an unregistered party that
night at Okada, a neighboring
dorm, went all night.
University guidelines require
that food and "equally attractive
non-alcoholic beverages," or
EANABS, be served at parties and
that parties avoid focusing on al
cohol consumption.
Moore also suggested that res
idences watch their party adver
tisements, cautioning people
