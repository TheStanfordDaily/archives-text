Important poets. Hughes' deep humane vision and fight for Afro-
American identity must be reread by anyone seeking to understand

Philip Roth, "The Facts: A Novelist's Autobiography" (Farrar,
Straus and Qiroux, $17.95).

generation Jewish intellectual, force you to think about the relation
between an author's life and art and, what's best, he'll make you
laugh until your teeth fall out. Read "Portnoy's Complaint" or "The
Ghost Writer" for an introduction.
