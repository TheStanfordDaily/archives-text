### Carlos Fuentes 
"Myself with Others: Selected Es
says"

Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $19.95
Reviewed by Will Corral
Need a debonair, worldly,
erudite and at least trilingual
canonical Latin American writer?
In the United States, call Carlos
F uentes.
This highly polemical and al
ready controversially reviewed col
lection of 10 essays serves to in
troduce readers to Fuentes, who
personifies the paradoxical liberal
and conservative image of what
the Latin American writer should
be like: tall, dark and handsome,
cosmopolitan, committed yet wary
of socialists and fluent in English.
Fuentes, who since the early
'60s has been one of the best in
troductions to contemporary
Spanish American literature, is
the author of 10 novels, two col
lections of short stories, a few
plays and with this one, four essay
books, plus some political tracts
centered on U.S.-Mexican rela
tions, his ambivalent fixation.
In the mellowing of the
tonalities of his political discourse,
Fuentes has distanced himself
from the mainstream progressive
ness that characterizes or is
desired of politically committed
Latin American writers. For this
he has been taken to task.
In this collection, however,
Fuentes places himself on the pe
riphery of that discussion, provid
ing his conception of the relation
of arts and language and

seemingly content to have ex
pressed his political views in the
sort of minor summa of his stance
published in 1985, "Latin
America: At War with the Past."
In reading "Myself with
Others," one can readily ascertain
that Fuentes holds fast to his
opinions. Moreover, he never
delivers his views in pithy one
liners. He is the essayist's es
sayist, in spite of settling into an
all-purpose philosopher role quite
different from the enfant terrible
letters he unabashedly portrayed
in the early '60s to the delight of
the New Left.
Here, Fuentes shows himself to
be at home in a wide range of
topics. If the two essays of the
first part tell us in great detail
how he started to write and how
he wrote one of his books (the
haunting novella "Aura"), in the
second, he reviews what is indeed
his literary canon and his
preferred harbingers: Cervantes,
Diderot, Gogal, Borges, "the other
K" (Milan Kundera), and Garcia
Mkrquez.
The third part is made up of
the complete text of his 1983 com
mencement speech at Harvard,
where he is now the Robert Ken
nedy Professor of Latin American
Studies.
This third part is probably the
one in which Fuentes provides his
Anglo-American readers with
something new, since all the other
essays are not difficult to obtain
in journals published in Spanish
or English.
In a kind of programmatic tone,
Fuentes uses his Harvard speech

Excerpt
'In Chile I came to know the possibilities of our
language for giving wing to freedom and poetry. The
impression was enduring; it links me forever to that
sad and wonderful land. It lives with me, and it trans
ferred me into a man who knows how to dream, live,
insult and write only in Spanish. It also left me wide
open to an incessant interrogation: what happened to
this universal language, Spanish, which after the seven
teenth century ceased to be a language of life, creation,
dissatisfaction and personal power and became far too
often a language of mourning, sterility, rhetorical ap
plause and abstract power?'

to inform us about the failures of
U.S. hemispheric policies, not
without presenting a scathing at
tack on the Soviet notion of satel
lites.
He then goes on to provide the
cultural context of change in Latin
America and to discuss
nationalism and democracy in the
Southern hemisphere as the other
two issues whose understanding
(by the United States) would es
tablish better grounds for negoti
ations.
Lest one forget that Nicaragua
and El Salvador are now ever
present in this bailiwick, Fuentes
proposes his own "Latintroiska"
to end up pleading for the practice
of postive leadership that would
require the United States to "join
the forces of change and patience

and identity in Latin America."
If one remembers that Fuentes
has not been anointed as a
spokesperson for Latin America,
the previous parts of his "Myself
with Others" are reader friendly.
This is a wonderful introduction
to a lucid Latin American's per
spectives on the Spanish language
and its literary tradition, cultural
crossover and some of the more
modern components of the "WC"
word; that is, the Western
Civilization that Carlos Fuentes
shows to be as interpretable to a
Latin American as to anyone else
who may think otherwise.

"Myself with Others: Selected Es
says"

Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $19.95
Reviewed by Will Corral
Need a debonair, worldly,
erudite and at least trilingual
canonical Latin American writer?
In the United States, call Carlos
F uentes.
This highly polemical and al
ready controversially reviewed col
lection of 10 essays serves to in
troduce readers to Fuentes, who
personifies the paradoxical liberal
and conservative image of what
the Latin American writer should
be like: tall, dark and handsome,
cosmopolitan, committed yet wary
of socialists and fluent in English.
Fuentes, who since the early
'60s has been one of the best in
troductions to contemporary
Spanish American literature, is
the author of 10 novels, two col
lections of short stories, a few
plays and with this one, four essay
books, plus some political tracts
centered on U.S.-Mexican rela
tions, his ambivalent fixation.
In the mellowing of the
tonalities of his political discourse,
Fuentes has distanced himself
from the mainstream progressive
ness that characterizes or is
desired of politically committed
Latin American writers. For this
he has been taken to task.
In this collection, however,
Fuentes places himself on the pe
riphery of that discussion, provid
ing his conception of the relation
of arts and language and

seemingly content to have ex
pressed his political views in the
sort of minor summa of his stance
published in 1985, "Latin
America: At War with the Past."
In reading "Myself with
Others," one can readily ascertain
that Fuentes holds fast to his
opinions. Moreover, he never
delivers his views in pithy one
liners. He is the essayist's es
sayist, in spite of settling into an
all-purpose philosopher role quite
different from the enfant terrible
letters he unabashedly portrayed
in the early '60s to the delight of
the New Left.
Here, Fuentes shows himself to
be at home in a wide range of
topics. If the two essays of the
first part tell us in great detail
how he started to write and how
he wrote one of his books (the
haunting novella "Aura"), in the
second, he reviews what is indeed
his literary canon and his
preferred harbingers: Cervantes,
Diderot, Gogal, Borges, "the other
K" (Milan Kundera), and Garcia
Mkrquez.
The third part is made up of
the complete text of his 1983 com
mencement speech at Harvard,
where he is now the Robert Ken
nedy Professor of Latin American
Studies.
This third part is probably the
one in which Fuentes provides his
Anglo-American readers with
something new, since all the other
essays are not difficult to obtain
in journals published in Spanish
or English.
In a kind of programmatic tone,
Fuentes uses his Harvard speech
