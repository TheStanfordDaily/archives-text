### John Kirks Staff writer

Mary's Lady Gaels 1-0 in a battle
that had national implications.

With the victory, Stanford
preserved a winning streak that
has now reached five games, a
total exceeding the Cardinal's en
tire win output of a year ago. The
win streak, which reaches back to
a September 30th.game against
Providence, has also boosted Stan
ford from a run-of-the-mill .500
ballclub (3-3-1) to a head-turning
8-3-1 squad.
Stanford entered the match des
perately needing a win for two
reasons: one, both Stanford and
St. Mary's were knocking on the
door of top-20 national ranking
and, before the game, many felt
the winner of the match would
vault into that coveted poll; two,
the squad was notified before the
match by the NCAA Tournament
Selection Committee that it was
being considered for an at-large
bid in the tourney's twelve-team
field.
A loss yesterday would have
meant an abrupt end to thoughts
of an appearance in the NCAA's
postseason party.
The match began, as expected
— a tight, well-matched duel.
Throughout the entire first half,
St. Mary's held a slight edge in
shots attempted, but neither team
launched any quality scoring at

tempts.
Then Jennifer Rowland arrived
on the scene. The sophomore for
ward knocked in a score with five
minutes to go in the period to
account for the game's lone goal
and Stanford's winning margin.
Rowland received a pass in the
middle of the field from Stacey
Keare, who had the ball on the
right wing. The Stanford forward
then simply took over. She
dribbled the ball straight down
the field, holding off a St. Mary's
defender that was pursuing her
from behind, and made a quick
move to the right to get around
the St. Mary's only remaining
fullback. Rowland launched the
game-winner from just inside the
penalty box (18 yards out) and
beat the oncoming Gael goal
keeper.
Stacey Keare received no assist
on the play despite her integral
part in its development.
Rowland's goal was nothing
new for her. The strike tied her
for the team lead in goals scored
with five (Lisa Sime and Carolyn
Denney each have tallied the same
number). Combined with her two
assists this season, the goal also
placed her alone at the top of the
team scoring list with twelve
points.
The Cardinal practically stifled
the St. Mary's offense throughout
the second half. The Lady Gaels
could muster only a few feeble
assaults on Stanford's goal. Stan
ford goalie Elise Edwards, who
had sixteen saves on the after
noon, steered these second-half
shots away almost effortlessly in
recording her eighth shutout in
the Cardinal's twelve outings this
season.
When the final whistle sounded,
the Cardinal erupted in a

postgame celebration that seemed
contagious, sweeping through the
Stanford section of the bleachers
at Harry Maloney Field.
Ann Pusch, who shared the re
sponsibility of holding off the Gael
charge in the second half, de
scribed the task of the Cardinal

defense. "They had two tough,
skilled players up front whom we
had to contain. The game was
tight the whole way. They had
more shots, but we had more
quality shots. I think our defense
really shut them down pretty well
because they hardly tested Elise

(Edwards)."
Pusch was elated about the let
ter from the NCAA committee.
"It's nice to see that the national
soccer community is recognizing
us," she said.
For the first time this season,
members of the team has ex

pressed cautious optimism abouj
a top-20 national ranking, ana
yesterday's win has only strengthr
ened Stanford's case.
If the Cardinal continues its
stellar play through the end df
the season, there will be morj;
reason to celebrate.

Stanford entered the match des
perately needing a win for two
reasons: one, both Stanford and
St. Mary's were knocking on the
door of top-20 national ranking
and, before the game, many felt
the winner of the match would
vault into that coveted poll; two,
the squad was notified before the
match by the NCAA Tournament
Selection Committee that it was
being considered for an at-large
bid in the tourney's twelve-team
field.
A loss yesterday would have
meant an abrupt end to thoughts
of an appearance in the NCAA's
postseason party.
The match began, as expected
— a tight, well-matched duel.
Throughout the entire first half,
St. Mary's held a slight edge in
shots attempted, but neither team
launched any quality scoring at

tempts.
Then Jennifer Rowland arrived
on the scene. The sophomore for
ward knocked in a score with five
minutes to go in the period to
account for the game's lone goal
and Stanford's winning margin.
Rowland received a pass in the
middle of the field from Stacey
Keare, who had the ball on the
right wing. The Stanford forward
then simply took over. She
dribbled the ball straight down
the field, holding off a St. Mary's
defender that was pursuing her
from behind, and made a quick
move to the right to get around
the St. Mary's only remaining
fullback. Rowland launched the
game-winner from just inside the
penalty box (18 yards out) and
beat the oncoming Gael goal
keeper.
Stacey Keare received no assist
on the play despite her integral
part in its development.
Rowland's goal was nothing
new for her. The strike tied her
for the team lead in goals scored
with five (Lisa Sime and Carolyn
Denney each have tallied the same
number). Combined with her two
assists this season, the goal also
placed her alone at the top of the
team scoring list with twelve
points.
The Cardinal practically stifled
the St. Mary's offense throughout
the second half. The Lady Gaels
could muster only a few feeble
assaults on Stanford's goal. Stan
ford goalie Elise Edwards, who
had sixteen saves on the after
noon, steered these second-half
shots away almost effortlessly in
recording her eighth shutout in
the Cardinal's twelve outings this
season.
When the final whistle sounded,
the Cardinal erupted in a

postgame celebration that seemed
contagious, sweeping through the
Stanford section of the bleachers
at Harry Maloney Field.
Ann Pusch, who shared the re
sponsibility of holding off the Gael
charge in the second half, de
scribed the task of the Cardinal

defense. "They had two tough,
skilled players up front whom we
had to contain. The game was
tight the whole way. They had
more shots, but we had more
quality shots. I think our defense
really shut them down pretty well
because they hardly tested Elise

(Edwards)."
Pusch was elated about the let
ter from the NCAA committee.
"It's nice to see that the national
soccer community is recognizing
us," she said.
For the first time this season,
members of the team has ex

pressed cautious optimism abouj
a top-20 national ranking, ana
yesterday's win has only strengthr
ened Stanford's case.
If the Cardinal continues its
stellar play through the end df
the season, there will be morj;
reason to celebrate.
