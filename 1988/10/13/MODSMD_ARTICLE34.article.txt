# Men's soccer devours Dons, 1-0
## 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
The words of senior Luke Gar
rott could have been termed prop
hetic. The day before he and his
Cardinal soccer teammates were
scheduled to take on the 13th
ranked San Francisco Dons, the
Stanford senior said, "A win
wouldn't be an upset in our
minds. We have confidence."

Men's Soccer
Cardinal 1, Dons 0

A better use of the term upset
would be to describe the Dons,
who were beaten for only the
fourth time this year. Stanford
came away with a dramatic 1-0,
double-overtime victory, a win
whose importance cannot be over
stated.
The Cardinal goes to 8-7, snaps
a three-game losing streak and
grants itself a new lease on life.
It was Stanford's first overtime
win in three attempts. USF drops
to 9-4-1 on the year.
It was a tough, physical game,
the kind that often ends 0-0 with
neither team able to get a good
shot on goal. As regulation ended
and the first overtime passed
without a serious threat, it
seemed as if this game was des
tined to follow that mode.
But suddenly, forward Rhett
Harty broke out of the morass
with a run up the middle. Out of
nowhere, there was fellow striker
Evan Nadler flanking Harty on
the right. As Harty broke through
USF defenders and approached
the goal, he had one man to beat.
He wisely drew him off and then
laid the ball off to Nadler, who
got the angle on the goalkeeper
and knocked it by him for the
game winner. The clock showed
4:33 left in the OT period, but
the Cardinal squad knew the
game was all but in the bag.
"We had the pressure on them
the whole game — it was just a
matter of time," Nadler said. The
sophomore scored his second goal
of the year, and first since the
first game of the season. A
reserve, Nadler \v?s only one of
a horde of back lp players who
saw action in the 110-minute mar
athon.
This was due not only to the
length of the contest and to the
routine replacement of regulars,
but to a plethora of injuries.
Five minutes into the second
half, forward Todd Caven went
down for the Cardinal and would
not return the rest of the game.
His condition is tentatively
labelled a mild concussion, which
is why he could not return.

Just to keep up with the of
fense, the Stanford defense lost a
man in the person of third-team
All-America sweeper Mark Semi
oli. He sat out for five minutes
after taking a ball flush in the
face. The third casualty was for
ward Chris Porch, who went down
with an ankle injury with two
and-a-half minutes to play.
"It was a hard game — a lot
of physical play on both sides,"
Stanford coach Sam Koch said.
But Stanford stayed tough,
thanks to the play of Bing
Kongmebhol, Jeff Rona, Nadler,
and John Howlett. These players
and others make up what is in
formally known as the "squid
squad," reserves that fill the gaps
for the Cardinal.
Yesterday's performance was
just the continuation of a great
job by these young players, who
promise a great future for Stan

ford.
The future is now for Harty, a
freshman who starts and leads the
team in scoring. With the assist,
Harty broke a scoreless string that
almost matched Nadler's. He had
not figured in the scoring since
Stanford's sixth game, when he
tallied two goals against San Jose
State. He has 15 points on the
year.
"We were playing well, and so
when we got to OT, we thought,
'There's no way should lose this
game'. We haven't been executing
our chances, but we did today,"
Harty said.
Nailing down scoring opportu
nities was key for Stanford, but
they were able to win with one
goal because they were able to
neutralize John Doyle and Alan
Bailey, USF's two scoring
defenders. Stanford kept the pres

sure on, forcing the duo to remain
back. But the Stanford forwards
also covered them effectively.
"We told the forwards to mark
Doyle and Bailey, and make sure
they were marked all the time
when they came forward. I think
it tended to slow 'em down," Koch
said.
As the game concluded in the
gathering darkness, there were
only a handful of fans left, many
of them from the visiting school.
Those who left missed a great
finish, and a big win for the Car
dinal. It was a league victory,
which means they have a shot to
win the Pacific Soccer Conference
if they can beat Santa Clara on
October 23.
"We don't think our season's
over yet," said Nadler. "I don't
know if the rest of the campus
does, but we're still here to play."
