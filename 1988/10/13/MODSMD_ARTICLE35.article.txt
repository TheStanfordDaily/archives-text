# Sports and gambling: an inseparable couple

### 
Whether his team wins or
loses, if Athletics' slugger Jose
Canseco manages to knock out
just one measly home run dur
ing the course of the World
"Series, I'll be a cool ten bucks
richer.
If he doesn't, I'll be out
thirty.
You're probably thinking 'so
what,' and I'd have to agree.
A bet like mine is no big deal.
Any sports fan has made at
least a dozen just like it. Be it
a handshake wager, an office
pool, or a bet with an illegal
bookie, gambling is as big a
part of the American sports
scene as a hot dog at the ball
park or a beer commercial on
TV.

Still, it is illegal in all states
except Nevada.
There are two arguments
used to keep gambling illegal
— one, that it is an inherently
dangerous pleasure, and two,
that open gambling would ruin
the purity of sports.
In an ideal world, those ar
guments make sense, in ours,
they're silly and unrealistic.
The fact is that people gamble.
An estimated eight billion dol
lars of under-the-table gam
bling money changes hands in
this country each year. Sports
gambling is an enormous un
derground economy involving
people of all classes in all
regions. If you doubt it, look
up the 'latest line' in any msyor
newspaper. It'll be there, even
at the expense of league stand
ings.
People like to gamble, they
spend a lot of money on it, and
it's ridiculous to leave it un
regulated and untaxed, but
before we get to a specific pro
gram, let's take a look at the
arguments against legalizing
gambling.
The first one makes the most
sense to me. Like too much
alcohol, too much gambling un
doubtedly leads to ruin. When
enjoyed in excess, gambling be
comes an incredibly destructive
disease, a life-wrecker that its
victim cannot control.
This argument is true, and

tragic. Yet it doesn't change
the fact that we already have
plenty of chronic gamblers in
the country. Although it is il
legal, sports gambling today is
readily accessible. Instead of
passing a law and pretending
that the problem doesn't exist,
we should talk about it, con
front it and find ways to help
people avoid going too far.
The second argument is ad
mirable, but naive. The day of
pure sports — the ideal of com
peting for nothing other than
love of the endeavor — is, if it
ever existed, now gone. That
much became clear to me dur
ing the recent Olympics when
I watched swimming sensation
Matt Biondi.
Biondi was the epitome of
the amateur, toiling for years
in a pool, swimming to world
records while people on his own
campus mistook him for a
second-string basketball player.
Yet as soon as the star
stepped out of the pool, where
was he going? Where else but
to Disneyworld! While still in
side the Olympic venue, still
wet from the race, Biondi cut
himself a commercial.
I don't blame Biondi. I prob
ably would have done it too,
but the fact is that money and
athletics go hand-in-hand. In
this day of high-paid agents and
million-dollar contract dis
putes, no one much above the
age of eight can see profes
sional athletics as pure. If
you're still worried, look at
England. The British bet, but
still manage to produce mar
velous 'amateur' athletes like
Daley Thompson.
There is still a problem. Cer
tainly if gambling were legal
in most states, the risk of
game-fixing would most likely
increase. As a result, we would
have to take some of the rev
enues produced by the new in
dustry and create a strong
agency to watch for rule infrac
tions.
On the other hand, legalizing
gambling would also take a lot
money out of the hands of or
ganized crime where it now
rests. In that case, decentraliz
ing the money might very well
decrease (although it admit
tedly wouldn't eliminate) the
risk of fixing. We won't know
what would happen until we
try.
And that leads us to the real
reason sports gambling should
be legal. Instead of winking our
eye and quietly checking the
spread, we ought to license our


ERIK STEN
bookies, make sure they have the
resources to back their bets on a
bad weekend, and tax the hell out
of their business.
Vice taxes are nothing new in
this country. We pay heavy ones
on both alcohol and cigarettes. If
we took just fifteen percent of the
illegal eight billion dollars
wagered last year, our coffers
would increase by $1.2 billion.
Since lower income people make
up the group most highly affected
by the state gambling we call lot
teries, I say we mandate that this
new-found money go into various
poverty programs. Beats the hell
out of sending it to the mob.

lars of under-the-table gam
bling money changes hands in
this country each year. Sports
gambling is an enormous un
derground economy involving
people of all classes in all
regions. If you doubt it, look
up the 'latest line' in any msyor
newspaper. It'll be there, even
at the expense of league stand
ings.
People like to gamble, they
spend a lot of money on it, and
it's ridiculous to leave it un
regulated and untaxed, but
before we get to a specific pro
gram, let's take a look at the
arguments against legalizing
gambling.
The first one makes the most
sense to me. Like too much
alcohol, too much gambling un
doubtedly leads to ruin. When
enjoyed in excess, gambling be
comes an incredibly destructive
disease, a life-wrecker that its
victim cannot control.
This argument is true, and

tragic. Yet it doesn't change
the fact that we already have
plenty of chronic gamblers in
the country. Although it is il
legal, sports gambling today is
readily accessible. Instead of
passing a law and pretending
that the problem doesn't exist,
we should talk about it, con
front it and find ways to help
people avoid going too far.
The second argument is ad
mirable, but naive. The day of
pure sports — the ideal of com
peting for nothing other than
love of the endeavor — is, if it
ever existed, now gone. That
much became clear to me dur
ing the recent Olympics when
I watched swimming sensation
Matt Biondi.
Biondi was the epitome of
the amateur, toiling for years
in a pool, swimming to world
records while people on his own
campus mistook him for a
second-string basketball player.
Yet as soon as the star
stepped out of the pool, where
was he going? Where else but
to Disneyworld! While still in
side the Olympic venue, still
wet from the race, Biondi cut
himself a commercial.
I don't blame Biondi. I prob
ably would have done it too,
but the fact is that money and
athletics go hand-in-hand. In
this day of high-paid agents and
million-dollar contract dis
putes, no one much above the
age of eight can see profes
sional athletics as pure. If
you're still worried, look at
England. The British bet, but
still manage to produce mar
velous 'amateur' athletes like
Daley Thompson.
There is still a problem. Cer
tainly if gambling were legal
in most states, the risk of
game-fixing would most likely
increase. As a result, we would
have to take some of the rev
enues produced by the new in
dustry and create a strong
agency to watch for rule infrac
tions.
On the other hand, legalizing
gambling would also take a lot
money out of the hands of or
ganized crime where it now
rests. In that case, decentraliz
ing the money might very well
decrease (although it admit
tedly wouldn't eliminate) the
risk of fixing. We won't know
what would happen until we
try.
And that leads us to the real
reason sports gambling should
be legal. Instead of winking our
eye and quietly checking the
spread, we ought to license our


ERIK STEN
bookies, make sure they have the
resources to back their bets on a
bad weekend, and tax the hell out
of their business.
Vice taxes are nothing new in
this country. We pay heavy ones
on both alcohol and cigarettes. If
we took just fifteen percent of the
illegal eight billion dollars
wagered last year, our coffers
would increase by $1.2 billion.
Since lower income people make
up the group most highly affected
by the state gambling we call lot
teries, I say we mandate that this
new-found money go into various
poverty programs. Beats the hell
out of sending it to the mob.
Whether his team wins or
loses, if Athletics' slugger Jose
Canseco manages to knock out
just one measly home run dur
ing the course of the World
"Series, I'll be a cool ten bucks
richer.
If he doesn't, I'll be out
thirty.
You're probably thinking 'so
what,' and I'd have to agree.
A bet like mine is no big deal.
Any sports fan has made at
least a dozen just like it. Be it
a handshake wager, an office
pool, or a bet with an illegal
bookie, gambling is as big a
part of the American sports
scene as a hot dog at the ball
park or a beer commercial on
TV.

Still, it is illegal in all states
except Nevada.
There are two arguments
used to keep gambling illegal
— one, that it is an inherently
dangerous pleasure, and two,
that open gambling would ruin
the purity of sports.
In an ideal world, those ar
guments make sense, in ours,
they're silly and unrealistic.
The fact is that people gamble.
