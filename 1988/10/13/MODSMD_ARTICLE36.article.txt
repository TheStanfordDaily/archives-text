# Linksters take second

### Eugene Sakai 
Having a team get out of the
blocks quickly to start a season
is something that every coach
loves to see, especially when that
team is a young one without the
benefit of a lot of experience. The
Stanford women's golf team, with
out a senior on their tournament
roster, delighted coach Tim
Baldwin by taking second place
out of 12 teams in its first com
petition of the year in Redmond,
Washington.
As impressive as their finish
was, however, the Cardinal
women ended up 31 strokes be
hind first-place Arizona, a gap
that coach Baldwin feels was
created primarily by the Wildcats'
advantage in experience and not
a discrepancy in talent between
the two teams.
• "I know our team can play a
lot better," Baldwin said. "I an
ticipate that sometime around the
first of the year we will be com
petitive with Arizona and teams
of their like."
To play at the level of Arizona
would be a tall order for the Car
dinal golfers. The Wildcats boast
two of the top women's golfers in
the nation, one of whom is the
top women's golfer in Scotland
and the other the number-one

amateur player in Europe. Four
of their five golfers finished in
the top 10 in this week's tourna
ment. It is easy to Bee why the
Arizona women are predicted by
many to be the top team in the
nation this year.
Any hopes that the Cardinal
would have of unseating Arizona
from the favorite's position rest
in large part on the shoulders of
junior Stephanie Parel and soph
omore Jodi Figley.
Parel was the leader after the
first round on Sunday, shooting
an even-par 72 at the Sahalee
Country Club in Seattle, while
carding a 77 in the second round.
In the final round of play, Parel
was in contention to win the in
dividual title but wound up shoot
ing 83 to finish at 232 for the
tournament.
"Stephanie in her whole life had
never been in contention to win
a golf tournament," Baldwin said.
"The next time that she is in con
tention, I don't think anything
will happen like what happened
to her today."
Figley shot 80-76-81 to finish
in a tie for 18th place. Despite
such good scores on what Baldwin
called the toughest course that
the team will play on all year, the

coach expects even more out of
his talented sophomore.
"That was what I would call a
sub-par performance for Jodi. She
found herself in the trees an awful
lot," the coach said. The fact that
this was Figley's first competition
in two months undoubtedly
detracted from her performance
as well.
Freshman Stephanie Davis
ended up as one of the players
that tied Figley for 18th, carding
79 on each of the three days of
competition. "It was her first
competition in quite a while,
Baldwin said. "We are going to
see vast improvement in her
scoring. . .she's a very strong
player."
Audrey Wooding shot 242 to
finish 32nd and Michele Lyford
249 to place 41st in the field of 60.
The next tournament for Car
dinal women is the Stanford
Women's Intercollegiate, to be
held October 28-30 on the Stan
ford Golf Course.
