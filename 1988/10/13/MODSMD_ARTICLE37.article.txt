# Bears breeze past Card
## 
### Hugh Bethell Staff writer 
In a regatta marred by unusual
weather conditions and the use
of experimental equipment, the
Stanford varsity sailing team was
unable to match host California
at the annual Stoney Burke
Regatta on San Francisco Bay this
weekend. The Cardinal finished
the event with fourth, fifth and
sixth place finishes.
Though the Berkeley area is fa
mous for its strong and steady
breezes, this year's regatta will
be remembered for the long, hot
hours during which competitors
waited for the breeze to arrive.
Ironically, when the wind did ar
rive on Sunday afternoon, it came
with such force that the last races
of the day had to be cancelled.
Normally, the event would have
included at least 24 races. As a
result of the uncooperative con
ditions, this year's regatta was
decided on the basis of only eight
races.
For Stanford, those eight races
weren't enough, as teams from
Cal got off to an early lead in the
standings and were able to hold
off later Stanford charges to finish
in the top three spots.
Stanford sophomore Dave Dowd
and freshman Lydia Snape

teamed up with junior Robert
Brown and sophomore Heidi Park
to take fourth place, while senior
Brad Swett and sophomore Chris
Li joined with seniors Ev Rend
and Amy Baltzer to capture fifth.
The foursome of sophomores
Scott Dale, Suki Kown, Rick
Rosen and Rebecca Bryson ended
up in sixth place overall.
Most of the Stanford sailors left
the regatta disappointed about the
conditions and about having to
compete against teams from Cal
that were using larger, experimen
tal sails during the races.
"We nicknamed the boat 'Ben
Johnson,' because it sailed like a
boat on steroids," co-captain
Robert Brown said of one Cal
boat.
Still, many on the Cardinal
squad had good things to say
about the way the sailing team is
shaping up this early in the
season.
"Given that Cal has been in
school and sailing for six weeks,
we didn't do too badly against
them. With a little more experi
ence we'll be on the other side,"
said freshman Peter Somers.
"It's amazing that after gradu
ating ten of our best sailors, we
still have the deepest team on the
West Coast," Stanford coach
Blake Middleton said.
