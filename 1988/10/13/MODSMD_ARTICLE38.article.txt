# Mets defense falls apart; it's a California Series
## PLAYOFF PICTURE 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ron
Darling said he had good stuff
Wednesday night. It just wasn't
good enough to get the Mets
through a disastrous second in
ning.
He escaped a first-inning jam
by giving up just one run, but
was charged with five in the
second as the Los Angeies
Dodgers knocked Darling out
the game and the Mets out of
the National League playoffs.
"I felt real relaxed and com
fortable out there," Darling
said after the Dodgers beat the
Mets 6-0 in the seventh game
of the playoffs. "I had good
stuff. I felt fine out there. I
wish I could say I didn't."
Steve Sax singled, Mickey
Hatcher doubled and Kirk Gib
son hit a sacrifice fly for a run
in the first, but Darling struck
out Mike Marshall and John
Shelby to avoid further trouble.
"I felt really good after the

first inning, striking out those
two guys," Darling said. "It was
a nightmare second inning. We
didn't play well that inning. I
made a bad pitch to Sax."
Sax hit a two-run single on
that bad pitch to make it 4-0
and Darling was yanked after
allowing six hits to the 10 bat
ters he faced. Los Angeles
scored two more runs while
Dwight Gooden was pitching,
with the runs charged to Dar
ling.
"They are a wonderful
team," Darling said of the
Dodgers. "They gave us a dose
of our own medicine. They're

gamers.
Several Mets called the sec
ond inning, when the Mets
made two physical errors and
a mental blunder, the club's
worst of the season.
"It was a nightmare. It cost
us the ballgame," first base
man Keith Hernandez said.
"When Orel (Hershiser) got the
6-0 lead, he was a different
pitcher.
"He struggled the first two
innings. After he got the big
lead, he went for the throat.
My hat's off to him."
After Mike Scioscia and Jeff
Hamilton started the second

with singles, Aldredo Griffin
popped a bunt between first
base and the pitcher's mound.
The ball fell and Griffin got to
first with a single.
"It was my error in judg
ment," said Hernandez, who
was playing deep. "Alfredo's
pulled the ball in the hole on
me about five times this
season, so I was playing back.
Tommy's (Lasorda) got to play
for a run in that situation.
When he bunted, I could have
caught the ball by diving. I just
froze on it."
That loaded the bases with
none out and the Dodgers went
on to score their five runs, one
each on errors by third base
man Gregg Jefferies and sec
ond baseman Wally Backman,
two on Sax's second single of
the game and the final one on
John Shelby's sacrifice fly.
"We really did nothing off
Hershiser. That was the story,"

Mets manager Davey Johnson
said. "We didn't iump out
ahead of this ballclub. When
we were ahead, we didn't put
them away. We didn't even
score. You have to give Her
shiser credit.
"I'm proud of the guys,"
Johnson continued. "They
battled and gave me a great
season. We just didn't finish it
up right. Right now, I've got
a bad taste in my mouth.
"I have no excuses for losing.
They won. They've got to be
the best team."
Johnson is unsigned for next
season. Hernandez, for one,
hopes Johnson returns.
"This is a team that loves
Davey," Hernandez said. "He's
a player's manager. I would be
extremely disappointed if he
got the axe."

Hernandez smiled when some
one asked how disappointed he
was.
"It's disapppointing," he said,
"but the sun will rise tomorrow."
Gary Carter was less philo
sophical.
"It's going to be a long winter,
but that's baseball," he said. "The
flat out thing is we just lost."
Hershiser, the very symbol of
Dodgers' determination, broke the
major league record for innings
pitched in the playoffs Wednesday
night with his complete-game, 6-0
victory over the New York Mets.
That gave Hershiser 24% in
nings pitched in the best-of-seven
playoffs, two more than the old
record by Boston's Roger Clemens
in the 1986 American League
playoffs. The NL record was 18
by Mike Scott of Houston when
the Astros lost to the Mets in
1986.
Hershiser also finished with
11% consecutive shutout innings
and was named the Most Valuable
Player of the playoffs. His earned
run average for the playoffs was
1.09 while the rest of the Los
Angeles staff had an ERA of 3.31.
"I had no idea I could shut them
out on two days' rest after relief,"
Hershiser said.
He had started Games 1 and 3,
relieved in Game 4 and was warm
ing up in Game 5. "I thank God
I have an arm that can bounce
back like this."
But he didn't start Game 7 like
he was going to finish it.
I "My mechanics were very bad
for about the first two or three
innings what with the adrenalin
and the short rest," Hershiser
said.
"I just didn't know how to cope
With it. Finally I got into a groove
and made some adjustments. I
came in here and looked at the
video of my first inning and then
I felt better."
' From then on it was a typically
dominating performance for the
Dodgers' Bulldog, who finished
the regular season with an all
time record 59 consecutive score
less innings and a 23-8 won-loss
record that virtually guarantees
him the NL Cy Young Award.
Hershiser finished the night
giving up five hits, walking two
and striking out five, with one
wild pitch and two hit batters.
"I tried to go with a game plan
that they wouldn't recognize and

maybe surprise them a little,"
Hershiser said, explaining that he
tried to "get the ball up with a
little pop" rather than his usual
sinkers.
Hershiser retired the side in the
third, fourth and fifth innings.
He was at his best in the sixth,
getting Wally Backman on a first
pitch grounder to second, Keith
Hernandez on a called third strike
and Darryl Strawberry striking
out swinging.
"He got stronger as the game
went on," catcher Mike Scioscia
said. "He's the type of pitcher you
have to yank out of the game."
Hershiser even drove in the
Dodgers first of five second inning
runs when Mets third baseman
Gregg Jefferies misplayed Her
shiser's based-loaded grounder.
From then on the only real
question was not whether Her
shiser would win, but whether
Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda
would, or even should, let him
finish with the first game of the
World Series only three days
away.
He threw 131 pitches for the
game, 79 for strikes and 52 for
balls.
Hershiser broke Clemens'
record when he got Mets leadoff
hitter Mackey Sasser on a fly to
center in the eighth. He tired
slightly after that, hitting Mets
center fielder Lenny Dykstra and
walking Backman on five pitches.
But after Dodger pitching coach
Ron Perranowski visited the
mound and left Hershiser in the
game to the cheers of most of the
55,693 in the crowd, Hershiser
got out of trouble by getting Her
nandez and Strawberry on
routine grounders to second.
In the ninth, with the crowd
cheering every strike and booing
every ball, Hershiser got Kevin
Mcßeynolds on a fly to left, Jef
feries on a grounder to short and,
after hitting pinch hitter Lee Maz
zilli, ended it with a called third
strike on pinch hitter Howard
Johnson.
Lasorda said he never consid
ered taking out Hershiser.
"With a six-run lead against the
Mets you don't ever get on easy
street," Lasorda said. "You don't
ever get to relax. Bulldog was
going to go as long as he main
tained his good stuff, as long as
he was getting them out."
It's likely Hershiser will pitch
Game 2 of the Series on Sunday,
but he didn't rule out Game 1,
either.
"I think I can be ready on Sat
urday, but that's up to Tommy,"

Hershiser said. Grinning he
added, "We can second guess him
all we want."
"The bulldog can do a lot of
things," Lasorda said, "But I
don't think we're going to do that
to him. But you never know. He
can talk me out of a lot of things. "

Two poor seasons by the Los
Angeles Dodgers make 1988 and
the National league pennant even
more special, Steve Sax said.
"People were doubting what we
could do this season, doubting
what we could do in this series,"
said Sax, who had three hits, two
runs batted in and two runs
scored in Wednesday night's 6-0
victory over the New York Mets
that put the Dodgers into the
World Series against the Oakland
Athletics.
"We had to play the best ball
of our lives to win this," Sax said,
"and we did."
The Dodgers were 73-89 in both
1986 and 1987, finishing well
down in the NL West standings
with their first successive losing
seasons 1967 and 1968.
But this year, the Dodgers
finished 94-67 and, after losing
10 of 11 regular-season games
against the Mets and all six con
tests at Dodger Stadium, came
back to take the NL championship
in seven games.
General manager Fred Claire,
who rose through the Dodgers or
ganization the last 20 years, has
been called the architect of the
club's resurgence. Claire got the
job last year when A 1 Campanis
was fired for making some con
troversial remarks about the
qualifications of blacks for base
ball management jobs.
Claire said that, heading into
this season, it had hurt him to
see the Dodgers suffer through

two losing seasons and to see in
terest in the team dwindle along
with stadium attendance.
"It's a great experience to be
back at the top, for the organiza
tion to be back," a champ
agne-drenched Claire said amid
the joyous bedlam of the Dodgers
clubhouse.
"It's a great story," Claire
added in the kind of remark he
might have made in his former
occupation as a sports writer and
editor for local newspapers, before
he went to work for the Dodgers.
"I'm proud of everybody,"
Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley,
whose late father, Walter, moved
the club west from Brooklyn for
the 1958 season. "Everybody
worked hard all winter and
worked hard ail season.
"Tommy (Lasorda) and Fred
Claire worked hard and worked
very well together."
Mike Marshall, the Dodgers
right fielder whose myriad inju
ries in past years had brought
him some criticism, felt even more
of the sting of critical comments
when the Dodgers fell from grace
in 1986 and 1987.
"We came a long way in a short
period of time," he said. "It's a
real tribute to Mr. O'Malley, Fred
Claire and Tommy Lasorda.
"Nobody thought we could win
the West, |fren nobody thought we
could beat I guess they
believe in us now."
Lasorda, who had taken the
brunt of the criticism during the
down years, was spewing cham
pagne — and exultation — in the
Dodgers clubhouse.
"Nobody thought we could
win," he said. "In spring training,
everybody thought the Dodgers
were through. To restore the tra
dition of this organization is the
biggest thing for me."
