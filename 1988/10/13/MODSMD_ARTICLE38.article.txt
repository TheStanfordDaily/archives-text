LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ron
Darling said he had good stuff
Wednesday night. It just wasn't
good enough to get the Mets
through a disastrous second in
ning.
He escaped a first-inning jam
by giving up just one run, but
was charged with five in the
second as the Los Angeies
Dodgers knocked Darling out
the game and the Mets out of
the National League playoffs.
"I felt real relaxed and com
fortable out there," Darling
said after the Dodgers beat the
Mets 6-0 in the seventh game
of the playoffs. "I had good
stuff. I felt fine out there. I
wish I could say I didn't."
Steve Sax singled, Mickey
Hatcher doubled and Kirk Gib
son hit a sacrifice fly for a run
in the first, but Darling struck
out Mike Marshall and John
Shelby to avoid further trouble.
"I felt really good after the

first inning, striking out those
two guys," Darling said. "It was
a nightmare second inning. We
didn't play well that inning. I
made a bad pitch to Sax."
Sax hit a two-run single on
that bad pitch to make it 4-0
and Darling was yanked after
allowing six hits to the 10 bat
ters he faced. Los Angeles
scored two more runs while
Dwight Gooden was pitching,
with the runs charged to Dar
ling.
"They are a wonderful
team," Darling said of the
Dodgers. "They gave us a dose
of our own medicine. They're

gamers.
Several Mets called the sec
ond inning, when the Mets
made two physical errors and
a mental blunder, the club's
worst of the season.
"It was a nightmare. It cost
us the ballgame," first base
man Keith Hernandez said.
"When Orel (Hershiser) got the
6-0 lead, he was a different
pitcher.
"He struggled the first two
innings. After he got the big
lead, he went for the throat.
My hat's off to him."
After Mike Scioscia and Jeff
Hamilton started the second

with singles, Aldredo Griffin
popped a bunt between first
base and the pitcher's mound.
The ball fell and Griffin got to
first with a single.
"It was my error in judg
ment," said Hernandez, who
was playing deep. "Alfredo's
pulled the ball in the hole on
me about five times this
season, so I was playing back.
Tommy's (Lasorda) got to play
for a run in that situation.
When he bunted, I could have
caught the ball by diving. I just
froze on it."
That loaded the bases with
none out and the Dodgers went
on to score their five runs, one
each on errors by third base
man Gregg Jefferies and sec
ond baseman Wally Backman,
two on Sax's second single of
the game and the final one on
John Shelby's sacrifice fly.
"We really did nothing off
Hershiser. That was the story,"

Mets manager Davey Johnson
said. "We didn't iump out
ahead of this ballclub. When
we were ahead, we didn't put
them away. We didn't even
score. You have to give Her
shiser credit.
"I'm proud of the guys,"
Johnson continued. "They
battled and gave me a great
season. We just didn't finish it
up right. Right now, I've got
a bad taste in my mouth.
"I have no excuses for losing.
They won. They've got to be
the best team."
Johnson is unsigned for next
season. Hernandez, for one,
hopes Johnson returns.
"This is a team that loves
Davey," Hernandez said. "He's
a player's manager. I would be
extremely disappointed if he
got the axe."
