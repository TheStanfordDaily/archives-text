European studies
boosted by grant
The Center for European
Studies, with the help of a recent
$300,000 grant from the Andrew
Mellon Foundation of New York,
is expanding its activities over
the next five years.
The center, which coordinates
teaching and research about Eu
rope on campus, was previously
and exclusively funded by the
School of Humanities and
Sciences.
Prof. Philippe Schmitter, di
rector of the center, said that
the study of Europe offers many
interesting opportunities for re
search. "Europe is on the thresh
hold — with the 1992 completion
of its internal market — of a
very structural change,"
Schmitter said.
The $300,000 grant will help
the interdisciplinary program
bring more visiting scholars to

campus and expand several new
programs.
Among the programs are the
Mellon Summer Research
Grants and Postdoctoral Fellow
ships. The research grants are
provided to Stanford students
who need to travel briefly in or
der to prepare proposals for
funding competitions or under
graduates working on senior
theses.
