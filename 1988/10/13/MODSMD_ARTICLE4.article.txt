# Palo Alto residents raise concerns over Stanford's expansion

### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
Fearing that Stanford's plans for ex
pansion are too aggressive, community
members attended a Palo Alto City Coun
cil public hearing Tuesday night to voice
their concerns.
Technically, the Stanford campus is not
under Palo Alto's jurisdiction, but the
city has long been concerned about
growth on campus. As a courtesy, the
University held a public hearing to dis
cuss its draft of an environmental impact
report that asseses the effects of Univer
sity growth through the year 2000.
At the meeting, three community mem
bers said they felt Stanford's plan for
expansion poses traffic problems for Palo
Alto and gives the University "carte
blanche" to undertake future building
projects.

Reminiscing about the
time when 'Stanford was
The Farm — an island in
the foothills,' Betsy Crow
der of the Committee for
Green Foothills said she
fears there will be too
many buildings on
campus.

Released in July, the draft covers 3.8
million square feet of proposed building
by the University. This total includes
planned contruction outside of the central
campus, such as Stanford West, a housing

complex for faculty and staff to be built
near the Stanford Medical Center, a new
Westin Hotel in Menlo Park and additions
to the Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford is required to have a general
use permit, which allows the University
to build on its property. Stanford land
lies in unincorporated areas of Santa
Clara County. The current use permit,
written in 1962, is out-of-date and needs
revision.
The responses to questions and con
cerns raised throughout the review proc
ess will be included in the final report
which will go to the Santa Clara County
Planning Commission, the body with ul
timate authority to approve Stanford's
plan for future growth.
While nearly 50 people attended the
meeting, only three members of the com
munity actually spoke. Their biggest con

create increased traffic congestion.
The report estimates that the proposed
expansion will bring 2,000 additional stu
dents and employees and 6,100 more ve
hicle trips per day to campus.
Reminiscing about the time when
"Stanford was the Farm — an island in
the foothills," Betsy Crowder of the Com

mittee for Green Foothills said she fears
there will be too many buildings on
campus.
Crowder questioned why Stanford
needed to "quadruple" its building space
over the next 12 years even though the
campus population is only expected to
rise by 5,000.
Phil Williams, Stanford's director of
Planning, explained that Stanford must
expand on its buildings to meet today's
needs for larger laboratories and research
facilities.
In the past, not all graduate students
had their own work space, now most are
demanding this room, he said. In addi
tion, faculty members want their own
offices, according to Williams.
He added that Stanford needs more
buildings because there is a higher per-
