# Insurance industry sponsors no-fault car insurance proposition on ballot
## 
### Nathanael Cousins 
Proposition 104, the "No-Fault"
initiative, seeks to control insur
ance costs by requiring each party
involved in an auto accident to
assume responsibility for its own
damages, regardless of who is at
fault.

One of five insurance-related
initiatives on California's Novem
ber ballot, Proposition 104 has be
come a battle between two of the
most influential and wealthy
lobbies in California: the insur
ance industry and the California
Trial Lawyers Association.
The initiative is complicated —
its text is 122 pages long. But
insurance companies, whose rep
resentatives wrote the initiative,
are supporting it primarily be
cause it would free their industry
from most state regulations. Cal
ifornia's personal injury attorneys
are opposing it mainly because it
would reduce their fees.
Currently, Proposition 104 is
the only of the five insurance in
itiatives behind in public opinion
polls, trailing by as much as 30
percent in some surveys.
Proposition 104, the Insurance

Cost Control Act of 1988, changes
the state insurance code. In ad
dition to making each person's
own insurance company respon
sible for auto accident damages,
regardless of who is at fault, it
also would reduce insurance rates
by an estimated 7 to 17 percent
statewide.
According to the California
Journal, California has the third
highest auto insurance rates in
the nation and 77 percent of
voters think their auto-insurance
rates are "much too high."
According to the bipartisan Cal
ifornia State Senate Office of Re
search, there are several main
provisions in Proposition 104:
• Every driver will be required to
maintain No-Fault insurance,
• There will be no pain and suf
fering losses allowed, except in
cases of death or "permanent dis
figurement or injury,"
• The state will primarily not be
regulating the insurance industry,
• Banks will not be able to sell
insurance, and
• Attorney rate fees will be read
justed.
Proposition 104 would not ap
ply to the costs of damaged prop
erty, and damages for most non
economic losses would be elimi
nated. Proposition 104 would
negate any reforms made by
Propositions 100 and 103, also on
the November ballot, which are
opposed by the insurance indus

try.
Versions of the No-Fault insur
ance system are already law in
New York and Florida, while a
similar system was rejected by
voters in Nevada. Supporters of
No-Fault say that Proposition 104
copies successful systems already
proven in New York and Florida,
while Steve Wiegand, a press rep
resentative for Yes on 100, dis
agrees. "They are totally different
situations. New York has No-
Fault with rate regulation, which
is vastly different from Proposi
tion 104, and in Florida No-Fault
hasn't done much good," he said.
In addition to insurers, Proposi
tion 104 is supported by State
Superintendent of Schools Bill
Honig, former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein and As
semblyman Pat Nolan. Opponents
include the California Trial
Lawyers Association and con
sumer advocate Ralph Nader, who
is sponsoring Proposition 103.
One of the issues in the Proposi
tion 104 campaign is the enor
mous length of the initiative. "It
is two-thirds baloney," says
Wiegand. "Most of this stuff is in
current regulations and could
easily be changed tomorrow. The
insurance industry included it in
the initiative so that if it passes,
it would be almost impossible to
change," he said.
But pro-104 press representa
tive van Aartryk argues that "Be
cause the text is complete, the
initiative will not be tied up in
the courts for years under inter
pretation."
Also, the initiative includes a
loophole that would allow the in
surance companies to raise rates
the day before the election, and
then cut them artificially if
Proposition 104 were to pass, ac
cording to Wiegand.
Says van Aartrijk, "Everybody
is trying to solve the insurance
problem. The question is, do you
just cut the cost, or do you correct
the problem and then cut the cost.
The other insurance initiatives
are like giving the guy with a
brain tumor some aspirin. He
feels better for a little while, but
then he dies. No-Fault is the only
initiative with serious, permanent
reform, and it goes into effect
right away."
A third controversial point is
the increased control insurers

would have over their clients in
the No-Fault system. Says
Wiegand, "One example is that in
an accident, the insurance com
pany will decide what kind and
how much medical care is neces
sary. That is all spelled out in the
initiative. Scary."
Counters van Aartrijk: "Insur
ance is a business. To do good
business, insurance companies
must do what is best for their
clients."
"Until we pass some reforms,
we will have the same ambulance
chasing lawyers, drunk drivers,
uninsured motorists and
fraudulent claims that cause the
rates to go up," said van Aartrijk.
"Californians like to litigate.
There are too many lawyers in
this state. If we want to pay for
this system that's fine. Auto in
surance is two-and-one-half times
greater in Los Angeles than in
Manhattan, where they have No-
Fault."
Counters Steve Wiegand of Yes
on 100, "In a perfect world, the
idea of No-Fault might not be bad.
It sounds good. But I don't like
the idea that if I get hit at a red
light, it is nobody's fault."

copies successful systems already
proven in New York and Florida,
while Steve Wiegand, a press rep
resentative for Yes on 100, dis
agrees. "They are totally different
situations. New York has No-
Fault with rate regulation, which
is vastly different from Proposi
tion 104, and in Florida No-Fault
hasn't done much good," he said.
In addition to insurers, Proposi
tion 104 is supported by State
Superintendent of Schools Bill
Honig, former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein and As
semblyman Pat Nolan. Opponents
include the California Trial
Lawyers Association and con
sumer advocate Ralph Nader, who
is sponsoring Proposition 103.
One of the issues in the Proposi
tion 104 campaign is the enor
mous length of the initiative. "It
is two-thirds baloney," says
Wiegand. "Most of this stuff is in
current regulations and could
easily be changed tomorrow. The
insurance industry included it in
the initiative so that if it passes,
it would be almost impossible to
change," he said.
But pro-104 press representa
tive van Aartryk argues that "Be
cause the text is complete, the
initiative will not be tied up in
the courts for years under inter
pretation."
Also, the initiative includes a
loophole that would allow the in
surance companies to raise rates
the day before the election, and
then cut them artificially if
Proposition 104 were to pass, ac
cording to Wiegand.
Says van Aartrijk, "Everybody
is trying to solve the insurance
problem. The question is, do you
just cut the cost, or do you correct
the problem and then cut the cost.
The other insurance initiatives
are like giving the guy with a
brain tumor some aspirin. He
feels better for a little while, but
then he dies. No-Fault is the only
initiative with serious, permanent
reform, and it goes into effect
right away."
A third controversial point is
the increased control insurers

would have over their clients in
the No-Fault system. Says
Wiegand, "One example is that in
an accident, the insurance com
pany will decide what kind and
how much medical care is neces
sary. That is all spelled out in the
initiative. Scary."
Counters van Aartrijk: "Insur
ance is a business. To do good
business, insurance companies
must do what is best for their
clients."
"Until we pass some reforms,
we will have the same ambulance
chasing lawyers, drunk drivers,
uninsured motorists and
fraudulent claims that cause the
rates to go up," said van Aartrijk.
"Californians like to litigate.
There are too many lawyers in
this state. If we want to pay for
this system that's fine. Auto in
surance is two-and-one-half times
greater in Los Angeles than in
Manhattan, where they have No-
Fault."
Counters Steve Wiegand of Yes
on 100, "In a perfect world, the
idea of No-Fault might not be bad.
It sounds good. But I don't like
the idea that if I get hit at a red
light, it is nobody's fault."
Proposition 104, the "No-Fault"
initiative, seeks to control insur
ance costs by requiring each party
involved in an auto accident to
assume responsibility for its own
damages, regardless of who is at
fault.

One of five insurance-related
initiatives on California's Novem
ber ballot, Proposition 104 has be
come a battle between two of the
most influential and wealthy
lobbies in California: the insur
ance industry and the California
Trial Lawyers Association.
The initiative is complicated —
its text is 122 pages long. But
insurance companies, whose rep
resentatives wrote the initiative,
are supporting it primarily be
cause it would free their industry
from most state regulations. Cal
ifornia's personal injury attorneys
are opposing it mainly because it
would reduce their fees.
Currently, Proposition 104 is
the only of the five insurance in
itiatives behind in public opinion
polls, trailing by as much as 30
percent in some surveys.
Proposition 104, the Insurance

Cost Control Act of 1988, changes
the state insurance code. In ad
dition to making each person's
own insurance company respon
sible for auto accident damages,
regardless of who is at fault, it
also would reduce insurance rates
by an estimated 7 to 17 percent
statewide.
According to the California
Journal, California has the third
highest auto insurance rates in
the nation and 77 percent of
voters think their auto-insurance
rates are "much too high."
According to the bipartisan Cal
ifornia State Senate Office of Re
search, there are several main
provisions in Proposition 104:
• Every driver will be required to
maintain No-Fault insurance,
• There will be no pain and suf
fering losses allowed, except in
cases of death or "permanent dis
figurement or injury,"
• The state will primarily not be
regulating the insurance industry,
• Banks will not be able to sell
insurance, and
• Attorney rate fees will be read
justed.
Proposition 104 would not ap
ply to the costs of damaged prop
erty, and damages for most non
economic losses would be elimi
nated. Proposition 104 would
negate any reforms made by
Propositions 100 and 103, also on
the November ballot, which are
opposed by the insurance indus

try.
Versions of the No-Fault insur
ance system are already law in
New York and Florida, while a
similar system was rejected by
voters in Nevada. Supporters of
No-Fault say that Proposition 104
copies successful systems already
proven in New York and Florida,
