# Stanford granted new computers
## Apple donates $6 million in Macintoshes and printers 
### Helen Willey Staff writer 
The University received its
first shipment of Apple com
puter equipment this fall, the
first part of a two-year grant
from Apple Computers worth
close to $6 million.
The grant is worth more than
any the company has given to
a university, according to Ap
ple's education district sales
manager Jim Paige.
The first shipment includes
about 160 Macintosh II comput
ers, 30 Macintosh SE computers
and five laser printers. More are
expected to arrive over the next
two years.
"Stanford is a partner with
us in the higher education mar
ket, \ Paige said. He also noted
that Stanford is one of Apple's
largest customers. Students and
faculty have bought close to $38
million in Apple equipment in
the past four years.
The $6-million grant comes
in response to separate grant
requests submitted to Apple last
year by the School of Engineer

ing, the Humanities and
Sciences Department, the Law
School, the Business School and
the University library system.
Apple also received requests
from the School of Education
and Rains, the new graduate
housing complex, but denied
those requests. No student or
ganizations, which would have
applied through Student Affairs,
submitted proposals.
According to Paige, grants
were awarded to those depart
ments whose proposals were
sponsored by Apple employees.
"All areas that got equipment
essentially have groups at Apple
that have interest in them," he
said.
Paige added that the aim of
the grants is to "make whole
academic programs at Stanford
move forward."
Apple has promised the School
of Engineering the largest por
tion of the grant, totaling 330
Macintosh lis by the end of the
two years, said former Assoc.
Dean for Academic Affairs Bob
Eustis, who helped coordinate
the school's proposal.

According to Eustis, the
School of Engineering so far has
received 110 Macintosh lis, the
majority of which will be scat
tered among the 10 departments
within the Engineering School
for both student and faculty use.
Another program targeted by
Apple is the Undergraduate
Writing Program, headed by the
Humanities and Sciences De
partment. Paige explained that
this grant will be the most ben
eficial to students because
"every student will take a writ
ing course at some point."
English faculty applaud Ap
ple's grant. "I haven't seen the
Humanities and Sciences get
anything like this before. It's
unusual and 1 think it's great,"
said English Prof. Ann Watters.
According to Undergraduate
Studies Dean Thomas Wasow,
the only problem is finding
space for the 40 Macintosh lis.
Meyer Library has received 14
computers, and the English De
partment has received some, but
a large number still remain in
storage while the department
decides where to place them.
