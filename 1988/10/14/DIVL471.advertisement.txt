It's difficult to define what we do at
Arthur Young. It's a complex mixture of
dealing with business problems and
delivering personal service to our diverse
clientele. Somehow the word accounting
does not bring to mind an image that
matches the reality of a career with a public
accounting firm.
To learn more about Arthur Young and
career opportunities with our audit staff,
come visit us at the Career Faire on Friday.
We take business personally.
Arthur Young is an equal opportunity employer M/F.
