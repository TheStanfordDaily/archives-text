# Black alums to hold reunion
## 
### Brad Hayward 
About 150 black alumni are ex
pected at Stanford this weekend
to share their post-graduation ex
periences and celebrate their her
itage at the fourth annual Black
Alumni Reunion.
"It's a reunion of a special fam
ily of people who view themselves
as survivors of the Stanford ex
perience," said Michael Britt, as
sociate director of development
and a resident fellow at Ujamaa,
who helped organize the event."It
took something special for these
people to survive within the
framework of a predominantly
white institution," Britt said.
Sponsored by the Stanford
Black Alumni Club, the reunion
features faculty panel discussions,
entertainment programs and
other events. Current Stanford
students are invited to participate
in some of the activities.
Junior Canetta Ivy of the Coun
cil of Presidents will be speaking
at the reunion. "It's important
for members of the black commu
nity to stay in touch, to find out
different perspectives," Ivy said.
She also stressed the importance

of "making sure there is a line of
communication with the alumni"
and "passing on different types of
knowledge and keeping certain is
sues alive."
Other Stanford students who
will speak at the reunion include
Black Student Union Chair Mary
Dillard, former BSU chair Steve
Phillips and Ujamaa Resident As
sistant Kimberly Coleman.
The reunion kicks off this eve
ning with a buffet dinner at Tres
idder. Representatives from
several major employers, includ
ing Boeing, General Dynamics,
Bank of America, Macy's and
others, will be on hand to discuss
opportunities for blacks in the job
market.
Keith Archuleta, assistant dean
of student affairs and director of
the Black Community Services
Center, said the dinner is espe
cially important because "job ad
vancement is still a real problem
for blacks."
Tomorrow will feature three
morning workshops at History
Corner, titled "Faculty Perspec
tives at Stanford," "Working at
Stanford: The Status of Black
Staff and "Stanford Students in

the Eighties." Participants in the
workshops will include University
President Donald Kennedy, Hu
manities and Sciences Dean Ewart
Thomas, Anthropology Prof.
James Gibbs and Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice.
Gibbs said he will focus his com
ments on the role of blacks in
academia. "It's important when
you have a diverse student body
to have that same diversity rep
resented by the faculty," Gibbs
said. "Compared to 20 years ago,
fewer black students are going
into Ph.D. programs. . . . I'm
going to address why the
academia may not be as attractive
to young students today as 20
years ago."
Rice said she will discuss the
role of being a black woman pro
fessor at Stanford and the special
pressures involved in that posi
tion. She added, "It is important
for black Americans to get to
gether to share their Stanford ex
periences and see how some ex
periences have changed and how
others have stayed the same."
The reunion will conclude to
morrow evening at Lagunita
Court with a dinner, a party and
"A Toast to Black Familyhood."
