Local schools get
Stanford volunteers
Stanford employees have an
opportunity to volunteer up to
four hours a week in Palo Alto
and East Palo Alto schools
through the staff time release
program coordinated by the
Public Service Center, the Palo
Alto Unified School District and
the Ravenswood City School Dis
trict.
The program offers 15 em
ployees the chance to help out
in classes ranging from kinder
garten through high school. For
five years, members of the Stan
ford community have been fill
ing gaps left by finding cutbacks
and shortages of volunteers in
local schools.
Linda Jean May, program co
ordinator for the Institute for
Research on Women and
Gender, worked in the program
last year and will continue this
year as a teaching assistant at
Nixon Elementary School.
May says the program offers
her a "personal bonus" in the
"smiling appreciation only
children can return." May also
feels her son benefits since her
work at his school "helps him
feel more a part of the work I
do at Stanford."
The program offers opportu
nities beyond teaching. Laura
Selznick, director of undergrad
uate research opportunities, will

work during the month of Jan
uary as the parent coordinator
for the Palo Alto Children's
Theater outreach effort at her
son's school.
The program gives her a
chance to provide a needed serv
ice but also coincides with the
lightest workload of her year.
Selznick has been involved with
the program for the last four
years and sees it as an example
of cooperation between different
elements of the community.
