## Bush given edge in debate 'Liberal' Dukakis strikes back against political labels 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — George
Hush pointed to arms control, de
fense and the death penalty last
night to punctuate his campaign
long description of Michael Duka
kis as a liberal. Dukakis, seeking
an elusive debate-night break
through, portrayed Bush as an
apostle of the status quo and said
labels don't count — only a "vision
of America."
The two White House rivals
also clashed over Social Security
in their second and final debate
of the race. Hush vowed he'd
never cut the federal pension pro
gram, no matter what Dukakis
said. The Democrat cited unsuc
cessful Reagan administration ef
forts to do just that, and said,
"I'm sure you'll try to do it
again."
Hush was looking to pad a lead
in the public opinion polls as the
two rivals met on the campus of
UCLA before a television audience
counted in the tens of millions.
Dukakis went into the encounter
hoping to turn the race in his
favor in the final weeks.
Both an Associated Press panel
of debate judges and an instant
ABC News public opinion survey
rated Bush the winner.
On Social Security, on the en
vironment, on ethics in govern
ment, Dukakis said repeatedly, "1
don't know which George Bush
I'm listening to" and accused him

of shifting positions.
But Bush returned all night
long to his depiction of Dukakis
as a liberal. "I have defined the
issues and I'm not going to let
Gov. Dukakis get through this
election" without answering, he
said. "If he says ideology doesn't
matter, I'm not surprised," said
Bush.
Dukakis said the campaign
would turn on the issues if Bush
would "get rid of the labels. . . .
Mr. Bush has used the label
'liberal' at least 10 times."
The high-stakes debate 26 days
before the election blended polit
ical hardball with poignant mo
ments when first Bush, then Du
kakis, recalled the death of their
own young children, many years
ago.
The Bush camp rushed to claim
victory moments after the two
candidates shook hands at the
conclusion of the debate.
The Republican candidate said,
"I'm happy with the way it came

out," and his campaign chairman
crowed, "I really believe the vice
president cleaned his clock."
James Baker said Bush firmed up
his own support and "closed the
sale with the undecided" voters.
Dukakis told a post-debate rally
he thought there ought to be a
third debate — an idea Bush
rejected a few moments earlier on
stage. "I don't have to tell you
that this race is very, very close,
and it's going to get even closer
after tonight and it's going to get
closer still in the days ahead," he
said.
Campaign manager Susan
Estrich said instant post-debate
polls didn't mean much. "We
didn't expect a knockout, what
we expected was a strong ef
fort. . . . The governor spoke to
people about the future tonight."
The ABC News poll of 639
viewers rated Bush the debate
winner, 49 percent to 33 percent
for Dukakis. The network said its
survey had a margin of error of
4 percent.
James Unger, director of the
National Forensics Institute at
American University in Washing
ton and chairman of the AP panel,
said, "George Bush won it. . . .
Dukakis' concern for an election
breakthrough too often led to a
debate breakdown on issues such
as deficit control, defense policy
and social programs."
