Citizens team up against Quayle
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - An actor, an author
and a garden catalogue entrepreneur teamed up
to place an ad in a national newspaper urging
the media to push Republican vice presidential
candidate Dan Quayle to disclose his college and
law school records.
"Release Dan Quayle's College Records Now,"
read the banner of the full-page, $16,000 adver
tisment in yesterday's New York Times.
The ad said it was sponsored by the "Indepen
dent Committee on Presidential Qualifications"
was and signed by author Orville Schell, entre
preneur Paul Hawken, and actor Peter Coyote.
A total of about $65,000, raised from personal
and donated funds, will have been spent before
the election on a second ad in the Times, and
another in USA Today, Coyote said.
Egyptian wins Literature Prize
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Naguib Mah
fouz of Egypt, an Arab storyteller who chronicled
the search for human values from the Nile delta
of the Pharaohs to the back alleys of modern
Cairo, won the 1988 Nobel Prize for literature
yesterday.
Mahfouz, the first Arab writer to win the award
in its 87-year history, has been compared to
Charles Dickens for his vivid portrayals of
poverty.

One book of his was banned in Egypt, and
another attacked former President Gamal Abdel
Nasser's domestic and pan-Arabist policies.
"His work speaks to us all," the academy said.
Mahfouz, 76, was awakened from an afternoon
nap at his Cairo home and told the news. He
said he was "very happy and thankful for the
Arab world" and added:
"I congratulate the Egyptian people that one
of its small people won a big award, (but) it's
not too big for Egypt. I hope this will be the
first step for our literary generations. We have
taken a lot and must now give."
Aquino: Marcos will he charged
MANILA, Philippines (AP) — President
Corazon Aquino said yesterday the government
will charge Ferdinand Marcos with crimes al
legedly committed during his 20 years as presi
dent.
Mrs. Aquino also said Marcos, who fled to exile
in Hawaii in 1986, will be allowed to return to
the Philippines to answer the charges. Philippine
law prohibits criminal trials in absentia.
"Sometime in the future, we will file a criminal
case or cases against Mr. Marcos," Mrs. Aquino
said. "At that time, we will have to allow him
to return to face the trial. No definite time frame
can be given as of now for this."
