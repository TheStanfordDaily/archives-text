KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) - A
U.S.-funded airlift started carry
ing food and medical supplies yes
terday to thousands of starving
people in war-torn southern
Sudan, Sudanese and United Na
tions officials said.
A U.N. official said the airlift
aimed to send 12 planes daily to
transport supplies to the towns
of Mairam, Kadugli, Muglad and
Abyei. Food was reported to have
run out in Abyei last Wednesday.
Government and U.N. officials
implied that southern rebels
promised airlift organizers not to
shoot down the planes. Washing
ton says the guerrillas in the past
attacked civilian planes and truck
convoys, and interfered with the
International Red Cross in its ef
fort to work out relief programs.
The airlift began after Prime
Minister Sadek el-Mahdi met in
Khartoum with U.S. Ambassador
Norman Anderson and Walter
Bollinger, an official of the U.S.
Agency for International Develop
ment (AID).
The agreement broke a deadlock
between foreign aid donors and
the government, which had
resisted delivery of food supplies

into rebel areas.
"The situation in Abyei is very
bad. It's now the rainy season,
and the airport is only a strip of
sand and stones. We don't give a
time limit, but we would like to
carry out the relief operation as
quickly as possible," the U.N. of
ficial, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated
Press.
Abyei's normal population of
10,000 shot up to 40,000 as people
in rural areas fled the fierce fight
ing to the town's relative safety.
Abyei will be virtually isolated for
the next two months because of
the rainy season.
An AP reporter saw a govern

merit report covering the last few
months which indicates that doz
ens of people in Abyei have been
dying each week.
Ibrahim Mohamed Osman,
secretary-general of the Sudanese
Red Crescent, said townspeople
and refugees in Abyei ate the last
of their food on Wednesday and
that about 700 metric tons of sor
ghum, oil and cereal had to be
sent there.
The southern rebellion began
five years ago, with the mainly
Christian and animist rebels de
manding autonomy and adminis
trative and economic reforms
from the Moslem-dominated gov
ernment in the north.
The official Sudan News Agency
said most flights are going to
Abyei, 500 miles southwest of
Khartoum, and that supplies des
tined for the other towns will be
transshipped from there.
Osman said planes that took off
Thursday carried medicine,
health experts and high-nutrition
biscuits to "people who might
soon starve if food doesn't reach
them in the next few days. People
are suffering from hunger and
famine is eminent."
