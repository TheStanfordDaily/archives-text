# Nuclear test shakes up Las Vegas

LAS VEGAS (AP) - The
United States detonated a major
nuclear device deep beneath the
Nevada desert yesterday, sending
a shudder through high-rise
hotels 80 miles from ground zero.
"It was a big one," said Energy
Department spokeswoman Bar
bara Yoerg, who was in a building
at a control point 12 miles from
ground zero. "The building was
still swaying 20 seconds after
detonation."
The 5.8 reading on the Richter
scale of ground motion at the Na
tional Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., was one
of the highest readings from a
nuclear test in some time, accord
ing to center spokesman Russ
Needham.
Yesterday's 7 a.m. blast
prompted calls to operators at

some Las Vegas resorts, with
guests asking if there had been
an earthquake.
The test, code-named Dalhart,
was the 11th conducted this year
at the Nevada Test Site and the
686 th announced shot at the
remote desert site since testing
began there in January of 1951.
The nuclear device was buried
2,100 feet beneath the surface of
Yucca Flat.
The test was announced as
having an explosive force of less
than 150 kiltons, the upper limit
set by U.S.-Soviet treaties. The
blast was thought to be near the
upper limit because of the Richter
reading and because managers of
high-rise buildings in Las Vegas
were warned two days before the
blast not to have workers in
precarious positions at the time

of detonation.
Such warnings are issued only
when the blast is expected to reach
near the upper limit.
The Energy Department used
to announce all tests as having a
force of less than 20 kilotons, or
as having 20 to 150 kilotons. That
policy was dropped earlier this
year and all tests are now simply
listed as less than 150 kilotons.
The atomic bomb that
destroyed Hiroshima in 1945 had
an explosive force of 13 kilotons.
Ms. Yoerg, who has been at the
site for many of the blasts, said
Thursday's shot was one of the
strongest she has felt.
"It was like when you were a
kid, being up in a tree on a narrow
branch, and having a strong gust
of wind sway the tree," she said.
"You were swaying side to side."
