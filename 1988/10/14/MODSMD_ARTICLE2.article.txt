relationship at this point," Kennedy said
during his opening statements, "the senate
could make it harder, not easier, to appoint
the kind of leadership and then to develop
the kind of relationships that will make a
new start possible."
Kennedy has long advocated a new start.

faculty members that proposed a commit

opponents Profs. Ronald Rebholz and John

immediate steps to bring (Hoover) under
'normal academic governance' " or else sep
arate its "political arm" from the Univer

out their own liberal agenda.
Normal academic governance — a term
disputed by all sides — would essentially
