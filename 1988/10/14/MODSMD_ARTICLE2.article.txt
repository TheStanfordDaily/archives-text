# Hoover study delayed
## Faculty Senate to wait until new director chosen 
### Eric Grunwald Staff writer 
With a little arm twisting from Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, the Faculty
Senate yesterday voted overwhelmingly to
postpone its much-anticipated debate over
the independence of the Hoover Institution,
agreeing to wait a year until Hoover Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell is replaced.
"By appearing to seek changes in the
relationship at this point," Kennedy said
during his opening statements, "the senate
could make it harder, not easier, to appoint
the kind of leadership and then to develop
the kind of relationships that will make a
new start possible."
Kennedy has long advocated a new start.
The Hoover director, Campbell, who must
retire as director next August, has pro
pelled the conservative think tank to in
ternational prominence by boasting of his
ties with President Reagan.
At issue before Kennedy stepped in was
a petition signed Oct. 3 by 18 Stanford
faculty members that proposed a commit
tee to look into Hoover-Stanford ties and
the question of "normal academic gover
nance."
Led by Political Science Prof. Alexander
George, the petition was a compromise al
ternative to a proposal of perennial Hoover
opponents Profs. Ronald Rebholz and John
Manley that the University needs to "take
immediate steps to bring (Hoover) under
'normal academic governance' " or else sep
arate its "political arm" from the Univer
sity.
Hoover scholars and Campbell have

rebutted that the aims of Manley and Reb
holz are an ill-disguised attempt to carry
out their own liberal agenda.
Normal academic governance — a term
disputed by all sides — would essentially
mean greater University control
over Hoover's academic appoint
ments and publications.
The alternative committee pro
posed by George has its predeces
sors. Among them are the
so-called Ward and Dornbusch
reports of 1984 and 1985, which
studied Hoover-Stanford tensions,
but failed to bring about major
reforms in the relationship.
Kennedy opened the meeting by
stressing that Campbell will in
fact retire next August, despite
recent press accounts quoting the
Hoover director as saying that he
will fight the ouster. A search
committee is presently looking for
Campbell's replacement, Kennedy
added.
"New leadership often alters
the atmosphere and the terms of
the discussion so as to suggest
new modes of cooperation and
new solutions to old problems,"
Kennedy added, a clear reference
to problems of communication
with Campbell.
Campbell was not at the meet
ing.
Biological Sciences Prof. Craig
Heller, agreed with Kennedy, say
ing, "We have to have a little bit
of patience."
But Manley and Rebholz, who
are supported by 55 other faculty

members, wanted action, not
delay.
"Something fundamental is
being asked at this University,
and the question will not go away
until it is faced," Manley said. "Is
it proper for a university to house
and support an independent think
tank which, on the evidence of
virtually everyone who has ever
looked at it, has a defined political
mission and a distinct political
bent?"
Rebholz called for a divorce of
Hoover from Stanford involving
"removal of all the personnel at
the Hoover Institution who are
not archivists and librarians from
the Stanford campus, on the
model of the separation of Stan
ford from SRI." SRI Interna
tional, a Menlo Park think tank,
was formerly the Stanford Re
search Institute. It separated
from the University in the early
19705, prompted by Vietnam War
protests.
English Prof. George Dekker
substituted the George proposal
for the Rebholz-Manley resolu
tion, with an amendment that the
committee should report its find
ings to the senate by next sum
mer.
Dekker, whose proposal for a
new study ultimately lost, said
after the meeting, "I can't believe
it would have greatly impeded the
search committee if this other
committee had been working."
