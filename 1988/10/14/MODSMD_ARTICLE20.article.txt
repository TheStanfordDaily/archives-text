## A 						jungle out there 
### 
When hunting for a job,
students should look at
more than salary offers

Next stop real world.
At today's Career Faire
in White Plaza, students
will get a look at real world oppor
tunities — and hopefully won't be
overwhelmed by the great number
of opportunities open to Stanford's
graduates.
Granted the last thing anyone
wants to think about right now is
finding a job, but today's faire is
a sharp reminder that decisions
about careers and life after Stan
ford cannot be put off forever.
However, a quick ride through
White Plaza today might fail to
make it clear just how many
avenues are open to graduates, and
that students do not have to hit
Wall Street their first year out.
At this year's faire, for example,
there will be 27 public service or
ganizations present. Representa
tives from groups such as
Volunteers in Asia, the YMCA and
the Peace Corps will be there, pro
viding information for students
who are considering a career in
the public sector.
And this sample of 27 groups is
by no means exhaustive. A trip to
the Public Service Center or the
Career Planning and Placement
Center is a simple first step for

individuals interested in incorpo
rating public service into their
career plans.
While a career exclusively in
public service is not for everyone,
all graduates should be responsible
citizens and consider making some
commitment to public service.
And at the very least, students
should care about the implications
of working for certain employers
and not just the salaries they offer.
Students should familiarize
themselves with a prospective em
ployer's investment portfolio, and
determine whether they believe
those investments to be morally
sound.
Students should also investigate
a company's environmental record
and find out about the firm's
hiring practices.
For the first time last year, many
concerned seniors made a volun
tary pledge at graduation to act
socially responsible when looking
for work. The students pledged to
"investigate the environmental and
social consequences of any job op
portunity" that they considered.
Although the Career Faire may
make White Plaza seem more like
the business district in downtown
Manhattan, students shouldn't get
swept away. There's more to a job
than promises of high salaries and
glamorous settings.
Hopefully, students will draw
from the knowledge and insight
they have gained here when they
are faced with important choices
in the real world.
