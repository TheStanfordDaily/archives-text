## Senator Sam wants you 
### 
And so, my fellow Americans, ask not
what your country can do for you; ask
what you can do for your country.
— John F. Kennedy, Inaugural Address
WE'VE ALL SEEN those Join The
Army ads on TV. In a typical
spot we find a group of bright
and chipper high school students gathered
at the local burger joint to inhale their
fries and to discuss their future (giving,
alas, equal reflection to each activity).
They lament that college seems out of
financial reach.
But one lad — that one in the pink
tie — perks up. "I'm going to college.
On the new GI Bill." He'll serve 24
months in the Army and leave with a
big voucher for college tuition.
Good.
But why not a GI Bill with more than
just the GI? A Citizens' Corps in which
America's youth could work in the public
service arena — anything from firefight
ing to literacy training — and still have
that wad of tuition money waiting when
they leave the Corps a year or two later?
That's just what the DLC, a group of
centrist Democrats, has been advocating
for the past few months.
And next Wednesday, Oct. 19, DLC
Chair Senator Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
Senator Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., will
expound their plan, titled "Citizenship
and National Service," at a noon powwow
over at Stanford's own Bishop Auditori
um.
They promise plenty of time for audi
ence questions, so bring some. Arrive ear
ly, too, for Bishop's capacity is but 300
or so.

Until then, a preview. The DLC's plan
is essentially an expansion of the generous
GI Bill so as to reward civilian as well
as military service to the nation.
Under the proposal, young people
seeking tuition for further education
would be required to give America some
thing back by serving two years in either
the armed forces or in civilian "human
services."
For each year, they would receive living
expenses plus a $10,000 voucher ($12,000
to those entering the military) applicable
towards college, vocational training, or
even as the down payment on a first
home. The proposal would allow students
to attend school first or to wait until
after their two-year service.
Better.
The plan, as economist Robert Kuttner
observed last March in Business Week,
looks good from a number of angles. First,
as the public begins to sour on mid-1980s
yuppie values, this proposal rejuvenates
the Kennedy citizenship ethic so long lost
from the Democrats.
As the DLC summarizes it: "A strong
ethic of civic obligation — of equal
sacrifice for the common good — is in
tegral to the success and survival of a
free society."
The plan, secondly, cooks up a brilliant
political recipe by wedding the liberal
ideal of aiding the truly needy with the
conservative notion of rugged, pull
yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps in
dividualism.
Many of the social problems which have
worsened in recent years will require
labor-intensive solutions, which prove

prohibitively costly.
A Citizens Corps could help provide
home care to keep many retirees out of
expensive nursing homes. Its members
could help staff corporate and public day
care centers, local recreation programs,
and the park services and state conser
vation corps. They could teach people
how to read and write. The list goes on.
While startup costs for the DLC plan
are high — around $6 billion — keep in
mind that the proposal would in fact save
money in the long run.
Take another look at that list of pos
sibilities. Using the Corps to staff day
care, for example, would save more than
it costs, because it would permit welfare
mothers with young children to get off
the relief rolls.
Home care for the elderly would save
money, too, by cutting Medicare payouts
for nursing. Again, the list goes on.
The DLC plan is far from perfect, and
members of many prominent organiza
tions have serious questions to ask of
Senators Nunn and Mikulski. Come to
Bishop next Wednesday and ask some of
your own.

towards college, vocational training, or
even as the down payment on a first
home. The proposal would allow students
to attend school first or to wait until
after their two-year service.
Better.
The plan, as economist Robert Kuttner
observed last March in Business Week,
looks good from a number of angles. First,
as the public begins to sour on mid-1980s
yuppie values, this proposal rejuvenates
the Kennedy citizenship ethic so long lost
from the Democrats.
As the DLC summarizes it: "A strong
ethic of civic obligation — of equal
sacrifice for the common good — is in
tegral to the success and survival of a
free society."
The plan, secondly, cooks up a brilliant
political recipe by wedding the liberal
ideal of aiding the truly needy with the
conservative notion of rugged, pull
yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps in
dividualism.
Many of the social problems which have
worsened in recent years will require
labor-intensive solutions, which prove

prohibitively costly.
A Citizens Corps could help provide
home care to keep many retirees out of
expensive nursing homes. Its members
could help staff corporate and public day
care centers, local recreation programs,
and the park services and state conser
vation corps. They could teach people
how to read and write. The list goes on.
While startup costs for the DLC plan
are high — around $6 billion — keep in
mind that the proposal would in fact save
money in the long run.
Take another look at that list of pos
sibilities. Using the Corps to staff day
care, for example, would save more than
it costs, because it would permit welfare
mothers with young children to get off
the relief rolls.
Home care for the elderly would save
money, too, by cutting Medicare payouts
for nursing. Again, the list goes on.
The DLC plan is far from perfect, and
members of many prominent organiza
tions have serious questions to ask of
Senators Nunn and Mikulski. Come to
Bishop next Wednesday and ask some of
your own.
