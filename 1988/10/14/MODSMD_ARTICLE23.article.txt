## Stanford is doing the best it can to handle wastes 
### 
IN SEPARATE LETTERS last week,
members of the Barron Park
Homeowners Association asserted
that the University was blaming the
public for its recent health and safety
difficulties, referring to a Sept. 15
article in the Times Tribune.
In that article, Alain Decleve, Stan
ford's director of Health and Safety,
alluded to the "NIMBY' (Not in My
Backyard) problem of toxic waste
disposal sites.
Decleve described a problem that our
society, including Stanford and the

surrounding communities, must work
together to solve. Communities have
been unwilling to accept disposal sites
and facilities, no matter how safe, in
their midst. Everyone admits the waste
disposal sites need to be built, but
"Not in My Backyard."
As a result of the NIMBY problem,
there are only four facilities in the
country equipped to handle certain
wastes that are generated nationwide,
including some at Stanford.
If these facilities are full, Stanford
must hold its own waste until it can be
disposed of properly. This is the situa-

tion Stanford faced in August; and, as
we waited, we accumulated materials
that automatically caused us to be
cited for violations by state agencies.
The safety of the incinerator at the
Environmental Safety Facility is a
separate issue. The California Air
Resources Board shared figures at an
August meeting of Palo Alto's Hazar
dous Materials Coordinating Council
showing that the incinerator is one of
the best in the Bay Area.
While Stanford's recently concluded
health and safety review found opera

tional problems with the incinerator,
particularly with the scrubber, all
investigating groups concurred that the
facility was operating well within
established standards.
We have, and will continue to, partic
ipate in public forums that address
these issues. In addition, we continue
to invite anyone with evidence of
unsafe practices or conditions to step
forward with that evidence so that we
may properly address their concerns.
