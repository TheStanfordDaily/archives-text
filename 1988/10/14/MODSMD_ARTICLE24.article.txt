# Decor in Bolivar does not reflect a communist bias
## 
### 
, In a Oct. 10 letter to The Daily,
Robert Cohn, professor of French, al
ludes to "Bolivar House, flamboyantly
/decorated with communist murals," as
an example of Stanford's supposedly
politically-liberal programs.
I invite Professor Cohn, and anyone
else who is interested, to scrutinize our
decor. We have on display six antique
weavings from Chichicastenango,
Guatemala; one Catholic Santo,
donated by former Ambassador John
Gavin; four Mexican bark-cloth paint
ings of flora and fauna; two posters
from Diego de Rivera museum exhibits;
one water-color representation of Clas
sic Maya pottery; a photographic
portrait of a prominent Brazilian bish
op; one poster concerning Cuban
cinema; one Pablo Picasso print; and of
course a poster portrait of Simon
Bolivar, liberator and hero of Latin
American independence movements.

If, upon inspection, this decor ap
pears as flamboyantly communist as
Professor Cohn claims it to be, then I
shall trust your judgment as much as I
do his.
