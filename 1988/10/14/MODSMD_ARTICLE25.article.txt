# Murals referred to were in Zapata, not in Bolivar House
## 
### 
I owe an apology to the members of
Bolivar House which I mistakenly
referred to in my letter on Hoover
(The Daily, Oct. 10). I meant Zapata
house, where the political murals are
located in fact.
On the other hand, my article was
edited to read that Stanford had
slipped to sixth place in national repu
tation, whereas I had correctly put
"seventh." The sixth place was for
another rating system also used and
discussed in the U.S. News and World
Report.
