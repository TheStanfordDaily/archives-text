# Efforts should be made to rid White Plaza of its stench
## 
### 
Last summer, I wrote a letter to the
Campus Report complaining about the
tendency of White Plaza and surround
ing areas to smell like garbage.
It is now a few months later, and
despite the cooler weather, the stench
still permeates that part of the campus.
I have talked to many people about
this, and we are all in basic agreement
that having one's campus smell like a
sewer is generally not a good thing. I
have also overheard the reactions of
new students and their families when
they smell White Plaza for the first
time.
The area in question is right in the
middle of Stenchford University, mostly
in the area bounded by Trashidder
Union, Stinkelspiel Auditorium, and
the P.U. boxes at the post office.
We need to do something about that
smell. I am not aware of any other
campus that has this problem. If for
some reason it is impossible to have a

decent smelling campus, then I think
that we should be told the reason and
issued gas masks. I hope that some
body who knows about these matters
can respond in the Daily; an awful lot
of people are getting mighty curious
about (and nauseated by) this problem
