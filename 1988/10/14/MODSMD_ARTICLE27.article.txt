# Not only rightists feel the 'canon' has been trashed
## 
### 
President Kennedy was quoted in
your pages as saying that the trashing
of the Western Culture canon was a
myth, created and perpetuated by
people of the "far right".
He couldn't be more wrong. None of
the clippings I have seen were by ex
treme rightists; all were either sophis
ticated centrists, mild conservatives
(like George Will), or even liberals
such as James Reston and Richard
Reeves.
