# Meanings of 'normal academic governance'
## 
### Liz Lempert Staff writer 
An argument could be made that the
Hoover-Stanford debate, in its present
form, boils down to the interpretation of
terminology more than anything else.
Because the exact meaning of the key
phrase "normal academic governance" is
unclear, the same term has been used by
two distinct faculty factions in different
proposals attempting to bring the Hoover
Institution closer to the University. That
sets this stage of the debate apart from
previous stages, which focused more plainly
on idelogical disputes.
One faction of 18 professors, led by Po
litical Science Prof. Alexander George, has
recommended that the Faculty Senate
create a committee to spell out the exact
meaning of the phrase in relation to the
Hoover Institution.
English Prof. George Dekker, a
supporter of the idea, explains
that the proposed committee —
which was tabled by the senate
yesterday until a new Hoover di
rector is appointed — would pri
marily discuss guidelines for
future Hoover appointments and
reforms in the general running of
the Institution.
Hoover should be run "at least
more like the rest of the Univer
sity," Dekker says."The director
of the institution has powers that
far exceed any dean of any school
and any chairman of any depart
ment."
The other, more radical, faction
is represented by Political Science
Prof. John Manley, an outspoken

Hoover critic and leader of a pre
vious movement to bring Hoover
under tighter University control
or sever ties completely. Manley
defines "normal academic gover
nance" as "being guaranteed the
same rights as all other academic
departments."
He compares the proper role of
Hoover to that of the Humanities
Center and hopes that, in the fu
ture, Hoover will be "a research
facility, with no political mission."
But George and his supporters
attempt to address the concerns
of those at Hoover who fear a
policy change may threaten their
independence. They stress that
" 'normal academic governance'
at Stanford does not mean tight
central control and the loss of
proper academic independence."
Dekker acknowledges that the
"term is a red flag to some people
— they get excited and upset."
Hoover Reseacrch Fellow

George Marotta is one who would
rather leave "normal academic
goverance" alone. He notes that
the University Trustees last sum
mer reaffirmed Hoover's unique
position as "an independent insti
tution within the frame of Stan
ford University."
"I thought after five years of
ruckus there would be a period
of quiescence," Marotta laments,
referring to a series of conflicts
between the institution and some
professors that culminated in the
decision a year and a half ago to
reject the Reagan Library. "No —
they want to set up another com
mittee."
Marotta says the answer is
more tolerance and more joint ap
pointments. "Stanford is big
enough to have within its nest a
think tank that has scholars that
can reach whatever conclusions
they want," he said.
