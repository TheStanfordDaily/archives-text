## Dicing for Doom 
### 
This summer my little
brother tried to talk me into
trying out role-playing games.
Stuff like "Dungeons and
Dragons" and "Dragons and
Dungeons" and "Dung Heaps
and Drag Racers."
Prior to these games, my only
experience with role playing had
been when my girlfriend
pretended to be the innocent
milkmaid and I pretended to be
the lustful Baron, or, when we
were feeling really out-of
control, we both pretended to
be Dan Quayle.
For those who are not familiar
with the game, Dungeons and
Dragons, or D & D (pronounced
"Dud"), is one of those role
playing games, the object of
which is to purchase enough
multi-sided dice that your par
ents have to declare insolvency
just to supply your habit. No,
ha ha, I made that up.
The actual object of the game
is to move about an imaginary
kingdom collecting treasures
and battling monsters until one
or more of the players grow old
enough to play more mature
games — such as "Thumper."
The first thing we had to do,
believe it or not, was wait for
the Dungeon Master to show up.
The Dungeon Master or DM
(pronounced "Dumb") is the un
disputed expert on D & D. The
DM's job is to organize and run
the game for the other players.
In this case, however, the DM
did not appear to be an "undis
puted expert" but rather my
brother's semi-moronic,
15-year-old friend, Gordon, who
has the same approximate social
skills as the thing that jumped
out of John Hurt's stomach in
"Alien." Same hairstyle too.
Before we could start playing,
Gordon the Dungeon Master
made me create my "character,"
which meant that I had to roll
about 80 different dice to deter
mine what my characteristics
would be. I rolled dice for my
charisma, for my strength, for
intelligence, for integrity, height,
weight, astrological sign,
buoyancy, political affiliation,
blood type, turn-ons and turn
offs, favorite musical group and
my ideal date.
The whole dice thing is a little
too random for my taste, be
cause you usually end up with
a totally unreasonable charac
ter. For instance, my brother
has a character with lots of
strength and no charisma

(usually called a "Troll"), and
another friend has a character
with lots of charisma but no
intelligence (usually called
"Ronald Reagan.")
The last thing you roll dice
for is "hit-points," which deter
mine how easy it is for other
characters to beat you up. I
managed to roll a two for my
hit points, making my character
the D & D equivalent of Michael
Spinks.
Gordon the DM also handed
out various magical implements
with which we might "better be
able to maneuver about against
the sources of evil that exist
within the dungeon." At least
that's what he said.
I remarked that they might
be useful at fraternity parties.
The remark must have insulted
Gordon because while my
brother got the "Ring of In
visibility" and another character
got the "Cloak of Protection,"
I was given the "Underwear of
Impotence."
Gordon the DM began by in
forming me that I was at the
bottom of an endless moldy
staircase in the evil castle
Munster in the forest of Vel
veeta. Discovering that it was
my "turn," I bid one "Ring of
Invisibility" and raised him two
"Bracelets of Eczema."
Again, he was not amused.
(Dungeon Masters never seem
to be too jovial.)
So, following my innate in
stincts (flipping a coin) I moved
east. Actually, I didn't get to
move anywhere. I just told the
DM that I wanted to move east
and he did it for me.
It was becoming painfully ob
vious that one of the severe
drawbacks of D & D is that you
don't get to move around a
board with a little chrome hat
like in Monopoly.
Now that I had moved, Gor
don the DM prepared to tell me
what my status was. He rustled
a few papers, rolled some dice,
chanted, sacrificed a goat, etc,
and eventually decided what was
lurking east. Which is how I
happened upon a Gelatinous
Cube.
Evil creatures in D & D, it
turns out, don't exist in normal
recognizable forms like lions
and tigers and Republicans. In
stead, they all look like muta
tions from those movies with
titles like "Man-Eating Blob
Warriors from Fresno" or
"Flying Cannibalistic Under-

water Sex-Crazed Eels of Des
tiny."
A Gelatinous Cube is essen
tially a large man-eating hunk
of Jello, only without the mini
marshmallows. Once again, fol
lowing my innate instincts, I did
what I normally do when con
fronted with a large hunk of
Jello — I tried to suck it through
a straw with my nose. But Gor
don informed me that I had to
choose whether to fight, flee or
do nothing.
Since fighting is my second
instinct when confronted with
large hunks of Jello, I decided
that this was as good a time as
any to test out my hit-points in
actual battle.
Unfortunately, these
" battles" in D & D are just as
unrealistic as the rest of the
game. I was hoping that Gordon
would produce a large tub of
Jello from behind his chair and
hurl it at me (and was I ever
prepared to pound it into sub
mission), but instead it turned
out that the battle was only
waged with dice.
I started out by rolling a 20-
sided dice and getting a 12. This,
Gordon told me, caused +2
damage to the Gelatinous Cube.
Then, Gordon rolled for the
Gelatinous Cube (I still suspect
to this day that they were in
league together, perhaps even
related) and got a four, causing
+ 1 damage to me. Then I rolled
again and by a stroke of luck
got an 18, causing +6 damage
to the Gelatinous Cube and
making me the victor.
This was unquestionably the
highlight of the game for me,
because two turns later Gordon
put a huge dragon in my path
which quickly did +4 damage
to my character, upon which
Gordon the Dungeon Master
tersely informed me that I was
dead. Not taking too kindly to
his attitude, I promptly did + 8
damage to Gordon with a pair
of 12-sided dice. We spent the
rest of the evening at the emer
gency room while he got
stitches.
