# Growing up with alcoholism
## Adult children of alcoholics work to understand the effects

"The three rules of the family with an alcoholic
member are 'Don't feel, don't trust and don't talk,"'
according to Judith Siegel, a psychologist at Stan
ford.
She explained that this means that family mem
bers shut out their emotions, learn not to count on
others and live under a "veil of secrecy" covering
the family member's alcohol problem.
An estimated 1,200 students at Stanford have at
least one alcoholic parent, according to A 1 Cooper,
a staff psychologist at Stanford's Counseling and
Psychological Services Center and coordinator of the
year-old Adult Children of Alcoholics counseling pro
gram (ACOA).
For children of alcoholics, the risk of their be
coming alcoholics is five to eight times greater than
for children not faced with the problem, according
to Cooper. More than half of today's alcoholics have
an alcoholic parent.
These statistics illustrate one of the many issues
students with an alcoholic parent confront. "ACOA's
need to know that they will not have the luxury
of drinking like other people," Siegel said.
But more than this, the psychological and emo
tional strains involved in growing up in a family
parented by an alcoholic are exaggerated when stu
dents move away from home, she said.
For most students, the transition from home to
Stanford is somewhat difficult. But for the children
of alcoholics, the transition may prove unexpectedly
painful.
"It's hard enough for kids to go away to college,"
agreed Siegel, co-leader of one of Stanford's al
coholism counseling groups. "On top of the regular
fears, they are anxious about what they left behind
and have feelings of disloyalty. It's important that
they know that others experience similar things and
that they're not alone."
Siegel's program is the first counseling group
available at Stanford specifically designed to help
adult children of alcoholics.
"After going through the program, students can
understand themselves in (their family) situation
better," Cooper said. "They understand more about
their parents . . . and about their own role in the
family."
Stanford students that are children of alcoholics
often exhibit a particular "coping strategy" in order
to deal with their families, according to Cooper.
They often step into the role of the "perfect child,"
behaving in a precocious, over-responsible and over
successful manner. Cooper explained that although
many students who have alcoholic parents come to
the program with an awareness of the issues, many
times the group is "the first real experience these
students have had facing them."
Both Cooper and Siegel emphasized that many
children of alcoholics have trouble admitting their
identity to themselves and others. "There are prob
ably quite a few people at Stanford who don't want
to believe that their parents are alcoholics, even if
they may have seen their parents pass out every
day."
One senior who went through Stanford's coun
seling program last year said the counseling program
helped him to deal with the emotional trauma of
having an alcoholic parent.
"To go on with my life, I have to accept the fact
that there's nothing I can do. You have to try and

free your mind of dealing with it,"the former group
member said.
The group counseling sessions meet once a week
for seven to eight sessions and usually last an hour
and a half. Cooper described Stanford's quarter-long
group session format as an "intense, short-term,
experiential program."
"People at this age seem ready for this experi
ence," he said.
Siegel added that she strongly believes in provid
ing as much information as possible to students
about their situation from a statistical and psycho
logical perspective.
The counseling program also works from an ed
ucational standpoint, helping individuals find the
origins of some of their feelings as they share "what
ever they are comfortable sharing" about their past
and present, according to Siegel.
"The group becomes like a family," Siegel said.
Cooper added that therapists and group members
help each other articulate and understand what it
means to be an adult child of an alcoholic.
According to the former student who was a mem
ber of the counseling group, "Sooner or later
[children of alcoholics] have to face the questions
they have right now."
"The sooner you can get this out of the way, the
sooner you can get on with your life," the senior said.
The first meeting is today at 3:30 p.m. at Huston
House on Campus Drive, and will continue to meet
on Fridays. A second group will meet at Huston
House starting Tuesday at 3 p.m. All of the sessions
are free to Stanford students.
