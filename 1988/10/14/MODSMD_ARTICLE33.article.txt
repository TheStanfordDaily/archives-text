A DRUG MORE POWERFUL THAN
ANYTHING YOU COULD EVER
IMAGINE.
A new pickup line? Something they
just found in that diet cola you're drink
ing? No, just the reason aliens are run
ning amok in Los Angeles in the new
film "Alien Nation," produced by Stan
ford alumna Gale Anne Hurd (A.B.
Communication and Economics).
Seems these aliens are pilgrims of a
sort, tired of performing the slave labor
that they were genetically engineered
to do on their home planet; they've come
to Earth to look for something better.
No, these aliens don't want to kill us
or force their ways on us or proliferate
the stuffed toy market with their
adorable features. They just want a
chance to live together as "humans."
These aliens, known as "Newcomers,"
apart from an oversized and scaly skull
(somewhat similar to the "Johns" of
"Buckaroo Banzai" fame) look exactly
like us. They have learned to speak our
language (in three months, no less) and
have done a pretty good job adapting
to the American way of life. Although
most of them still do menial jobs such
as working in chemical plants (they are
immune to the effect of harmful gasses),
running convenience stores or dancing
in nightclubs, some, through their own
initiative and a new kind of affirmative
action-like program, have risen above
their slave-labor design and into more
respected places in society.
So where do the drugs come in? I'm
getting to that.
Our story involves tough, maverick,
smart-ass, big-city cop Matthew Sykes
(James Caan), who, after his longtime
partner is killed by a Newcomer hood
lum, teams up with the first Newcomer
detective in the L.A.P.D. (Mandy
Patinkin) in order to find the murderer.
This odd pairing, which reminds one a
bit — OK, a lot — of Lethal Weapon,
produces some of the most entertaining
parts of the movie.
Sykes is an admitted bigot who does
not like the Newcomers, while the New
comer himself, Samuel (Sam) Francisco
(but you can call him George) is the
straight, analytical, helpful-yet
exasperating sidekick who is always
trying to be the perfect cop.
These two, investigating the murder
of Sykes' partner, stumble onto the big
"secret" that the 20th Century Fox big
wigs have so prominently teased in the
advertising campaign. (Hint: the
drugs. . .)
If the plot sounds like a lot of other
movies you've seen, well, it is, and the

James Caan in "Alien Nation."
problem with the film is that it's
predictable in the what's-going
to-happen-next sense. The whole
thing comes off as a little flat and
not too enthralling, although the
ending did deviate from the norm
and actually took me and my date
(Editor's note: snicker) by
surprise.
Amazing as it may seem, un
derneath all that makeup the
Newcomer is played by Mandy
Patinkin, last seen as the
Spaniard Inigo Montoya in"The
Princess Bride." Patinkin has
shown his versatility in the diver
sity of the parts he has taken,
including Avigdor opposite Bar
bara Streisand in "Yentl" and his
1979 Tony Award winning per
formance as Che Guevara in
"Evita" on Broadway.
The best part of the film is the
creation of the Newcomers with
their quirky alien habits, and
their integration into a futurific
American society. As with Hurd's
other films (including "Aliens"
and"The Terminator") "Alien Na
tion" successfully creates a new
world, and while the plot doesn't
quite come through, the interac
tion between the two leads in the
imaginary society is great.
