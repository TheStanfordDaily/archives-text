# Hurd through the grapevine
## 
### 
If there's one thing that Gale Anne
Hurd does well it's aliens. Prior to
producing "Alien Nation" Hurd de
veloped two of the best films of the
decade containing other-worldly crea
tures.
After producing and co-writing
"The Terminator" in 1984, Hurd
produced the enormously successful
"Aliens" in 1986, which went on to
garner seven Academy Award
nominations.
Hurd graduated Phi Beta Kappa
from Stanford in 1977 with a double
major in Economics and Communi
cation. Looking back on her career
at Stanford, Hurd says "What I got
out of Stanford was a great education
that taught me how to think, how
to write precisely and how to express
myself. I also learned how to manip
ulate. Those are the skills I needed.
Communication was a good way to
approach film theoretically, but the
overall education helped me the
most."

After graduation, Hurd started her
career at New World Pictures, a
studio known for producing cheap
exploitation flicks, but also for fos
tering hot young talent in the movie
industry. She left New World Pic
tures in 1982 to form her own inde
pendent production company, Pacific
Western Productions.
Now considered one of the hottest
young producers in Hollywood, Hurd
offers this advice to students looking
for a possible career in film: "Come
to Los Angeles and be willing to work
as a slave as a production assistant.
Be persistent, offer to do anything."
She warns, however, that a Stan
ford degree isn't a guaranteed ticket
into the upper realms of movie
making.
"The biggest problem people have
when they come here is attitude.
They're not willing to make
sacrifices. They think that since they
have a degree from Stanford or
UCLA they're owed something."
