## 'Accused' fosters discussion of rape 
### Mark Robinson 
In"The Accused" Jodie Foster
fails to do something expected
of her: overact. The movie,
produced by the pair that
brought us "Fatal Attraction,"
(Stanley Jaffe and Sherry Lan
sing) gives her ample opportu
nity.
The story is about a young
working-class woman who is bru
tally gang-raped in the game
room of a sleazy bar while an
onlooking crowd hoots and
cheers. This could be an open
invitation to turn a serious sub
ject into a cheap made-for-TV
melodrama. Instead, Foster and
her collaborators have made a
powerful and utterly believable
film that probes the genesis of
rape in the minds of men and
women.
The film opens with a view of
a bar, The Mill, that could be in
any town under any lonely
freeway overpass (this one is
supposed to be in a mythical

"Birchfield" in northern Wash
ington).
A young woman bursts from
the bar and runs for the road,
yelling for help and trying to
flag down a passing motorist.
She's taken to a nearby hospital
and must submit to the expected
indignities of pelvic exam and
questions about her sexual his
tory. The social and hospital
workers are neither saints nor
insensitive brutes.
The real plot begins once the
accused rapists are brought
before the law, including a look
at how criminal lawyers barter
justice for convenience. ("What
would you say to Sexual Abuse
two?" one of the rapists' attor
neys asks).
Sarah's bright young lawyer,
District Attorney Katheryn
Murphy (played a little woodenly
by Kelly McGillis), figures she's
done pretty well by the victim.
The rapists will spend at least a
few years in jail. But Sarah

Tobias wants to tell her story in
court.
The film opens the question
of just how much our attitudes
and indirect actions contribute
to a mentality that encourages

rape.
We find out that this mentality
is not the unique domain of the
seedy bar under the overpass;
it's found on the university
campus (where one of the rapists

is found) and in the hearts of
Murphy's fellow DAs who love a
bruising hockey game. It's a
mentality of aggression and dom
ination, a mindset that seeks to
objectify and humiliate.
