## Cardinal set for showdown with Sun Devils 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
While most football coaches feel
that one individual game cannot
make or break a season, there can
be little doubt tomorrow's contest
with Arizona State is a big game
for the Cardinal.
Gametime at Stanford Stadium
is 1:00 p.m.
Stanford comes into the game
2-3 on the season, but the team
is 0-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Although both of the Pac-10 losses
have been very close games,
against third-ranked USC and
Oregon, a team in the top 20 until
the Ducks lost to the Trojans last
Saturday, Stanford knows it needs
to beat ASU.
"We're looking forward now to
. . . preparing for Arizona State,"
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said.
"I think it's going to be doubly
important because we're playing
at home and we can get our first
Pac-10 win."
Arizona State has been up and
down thus far this season, with
their latest outing definitely fall
ing under both headings. The Sun
Devils lost 10-0 to 16th-ranked
Washington last Saturday with a
poor offensive showing but a good
defensive showing.
"We felt we got the best effort
out of our defense against Wash
ington this week that we've had
all year," ASU Coach Larry
Marmie said. "We're not rushing
the football the way we need to
rush it to win in this league."
"We've played well at times,"
he continued, "but I think prob
ably the key word that I think
we're lacking in our football team
is consistency."
Then, when asked if his team
runs a "multiple" offense, Marmie
replied "Yes. But we haven't been
near as multiple as we need to be."
The Sun Devils have no big
stars on offense (no one has more
than 200 yards rushing or more

than 200 yards receiving this
year), but the team has been able
to move the ball pretty well. The
key to the ASU offense is senior
quarterback Daniel Ford.
"Daniel Ford has played win
ning football for us in our first
five games," Marmie said. Ford
has completed 53 percent of his
passes this season and is ranked
42nd in passing efficiency among
the nation's approximately 190
Division I teams.
In the backfield, the Sun Devils
have five runners who are ex
pected to see a lot of action, led
by David Winsley. Winsley, a 5-
foot-5 193-pound junior, ran for
over 100 yards against Lamar two
weeks ago.
Arizona State also uses a five
man rotation at wide receiver. Al
though no one has more than 12
catches this year, the Devils have
three wideouts averaging more
than 20 yards per reception.
This offense will face a Stanford
defense that has played well this
season. The team is giving up 19
points a game, and, despite the
42 points scored by Notre Dame
two weeks ago, that is still an
improvement over last season's
24.4-points-against average.
Stanford's defense is sparked by
the play of the defensive line:
Lester Archambeau, Ray Huckes
tein and Scott Palmbush. Ar
chambeau and Huckestein are a
little beat-up at the moment, but
Archambeau will play and Huck
estein might see action.
Inside linebackers Jono Tunney
and Kevin Richardson lead the
squad in tackles this season, and
aggressive strong safety Rob
Englehardt and outside line
backer Rob Hinckley aren't far
behind. They will be kept busy
by an unpredictable ASU offense,
but if they perform like last week,
when Stanford caused eight San
Jose State turnovers, they will set
the table for the Cardinal offense.
"We're really impressed with

Stanford's defense," Marmie said.
"With Archambeau and Huckes
tein up there, those front people
look to be as physical as any we've
played this year."
Marmie is also worried about
Stanford's offense. "Offensively
they present a lot of problems,"
he said. "They're just an offensive
football team that you know can
score, that you know can move
the ball."
Fullback Jon Volpe — at barely
5-7 he's Stanford's answer to
Winsley — is averaging 95 yards
rushing per game, and has caught
15 passes. Quarterback Jason
Palumbis will also look for the
Cardinal's leading receiver,
Charlie Young, and speedster Wal
ter Batson.
"(Palumbis) is a big, fine ath
lete," Marmie said. "We know he
can do what they want him to do
with their offense."
Elway, while not as impressed
with Palumbis as Marmie is, felt
the redshirt freshman definitely
did an acceptable job in his first
collegiate start last week. "For
what he does the best, that's hit
ting the right receiver and being
accurate, I think he could have
done a better job because that's
what he does best," Elway said.
"I don't think he had a great game
at quarterback; at the same time
I think he did some good things."
Palumbis did do some good
things, including hitting Young
for a 49-yard touchdown in the
first quarter (Stanford's longest
play of the season), and scram
bling 15 yards out of the pocket
for a first down. Palumbis will
need to find the big plays again
this week against an ASU defense
that has only allowed more than
17 points once all year.
And in the end, Elway, who said
"Our game against San Jose was
one that was real important to
us," knows this one is just as big.

Senior cornerback Alan Grant, shown here against San Jose returning an interception 78 yards to
paydirt (the third-longest interception return in Stanford history), leads the Cardinal defense against
Arizona State s multiple offense tomorrow at Stanford Stadium.
