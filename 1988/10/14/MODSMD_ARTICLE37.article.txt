# Bruins, Bears visit deGuerre

Although the squads are peren
nial rivals, the Stanford water
polo team has one thing to thank
UCLA for — head coach Dante
Dettamanti.
"(UCLA coach) Bob Home is
more responsible than anyone for
getting me interested in coach
ing," Dettamanti said.
After graduating from UC-
Davis, Home took Dettamanti un
der his wing as his assistant coach.
After 11 years at the helm of the
Cardinal program the student has
surpassed the master.
Although both of the coaches'
programs are considered to be two
of the three top teams in the na
tion, Dettamanti has already
guided Stanford to six national
championships to the Bruins'
three. Dettamanti also has the
highest winning percentage of any
Pacific 10 Conference skipper, his
.850 percentage eclipsing Home's
.720.
The student and master will
face off for the 41st time this
weekend, with national bragging

rights at stake as well as momen
tum with which to head into the
backstretch of the season.
The first of this season's non
tournament face-offs between the
rivals takes place this afternoon
at deGuerre Pool. The fourth
ranked Cardinal will seek to
avenge its Northern California
Tournament loss to the top
ranked Bruins today at 3:00 p.m.
The Pac-10 weekend continues
with UCLA traveling to Cal Sat
urday, and the second rated Bears
heading for the Farm Sunday at
1:00 p.m.
Although Stanford holds a 30-10
series advantage over the Bruins,
the squad has come up short in
two previous matches this season.
The Cardinal was dominated 10-5
in the UC-Irvine Tournament
Sept. 18, and was on the short
end of a 6-3 tally two weeks ago
in the NorCal semifinals. But
after holding the usually potent
UCLA offense to six goals in the
last match, Stanford sees no rea
son why it should not be able to
avenge its previous losses.
