# Bruins, Bears visit deGuerre

Although the squads are peren
nial rivals, the Stanford water
polo team has one thing to thank
UCLA for — head coach Dante
Dettamanti.
"(UCLA coach) Bob Home is
more responsible than anyone for
getting me interested in coach
ing," Dettamanti said.
After graduating from UC-
Davis, Home took Dettamanti un
der his wing as his assistant coach.
After 11 years at the helm of the
Cardinal program the student has
surpassed the master.
Although both of the coaches'
programs are considered to be two
of the three top teams in the na
tion, Dettamanti has already
guided Stanford to six national
championships to the Bruins'
three. Dettamanti also has the
highest winning percentage of any
Pacific 10 Conference skipper, his
.850 percentage eclipsing Home's
.720.
The student and master will
face off for the 41st time this
weekend, with national bragging

rights at stake as well as momen
tum with which to head into the
backstretch of the season.
The first of this season's non
tournament face-offs between the
rivals takes place this afternoon
at deGuerre Pool. The fourth
ranked Cardinal will seek to
avenge its Northern California
Tournament loss to the top
ranked Bruins today at 3:00 p.m.
The Pac-10 weekend continues
with UCLA traveling to Cal Sat
urday, and the second rated Bears
heading for the Farm Sunday at
1:00 p.m.
Although Stanford holds a 30-10
series advantage over the Bruins,
the squad has come up short in
two previous matches this season.
The Cardinal was dominated 10-5
in the UC-Irvine Tournament
Sept. 18, and was on the short
end of a 6-3 tally two weeks ago
in the NorCal semifinals. But
after holding the usually potent
UCLA offense to six goals in the
last match, Stanford sees no rea
son why it should not be able to
avenge its previous losses.

Stanford holeman Erik Blum, foreground, will need to have a hot
hand if the Cardinal is going to defeat No. 1 UCLA and No. 2 Cal
this weekend.
In addition to the Cardinal's
improvement, the previously un
defeated Bruins were upset by
then fourth-ranked Southern Cal
ifornia squad last weekend,
proving they can be beaten. The
combination of the two may prove
to be the key to a Stanford victory.
"The way UCLA plays they
should come back tough but they
might have self doubts," Det
tamanti said. "However they
might look past us because they
have (second ranked) Cal on Sat
urday."
To pull off the upset the Car
dinal is going to have to shut
down the Bruins All-America two
meter man Alexis Rousseau and
All-America driver Fernando Car
silade. Rousseau, who Dettamanti
calls the best two-meter man in
the country, scored three of the
Bruins' six goals in the team's
last contest and holds the UCLA
single season scoring record.
While Carsilade was the second
leading scorer last season, his
forte is his defensive skills.
To prepare for Rousseau, a left
hander, the Card had the aid of
former Cardinal and Olympic team

member Craig Klass. The left
hander volunteered to let the
squad defend him in practice this
week, giving them extra practice
against accurate lefty shots.
While shutting down the Bruin
offense, Stanford also needs to be
able to penetrate UCLA's deadly
defense . According to Dettamanti,
the squad has to take advantage
of six-on-five situations and take
advantage of any defensive mis
takes UCLA commits.
"We have to execute better and
take more accurate shots if we
want to have a chance at the vic
tory," he said.
After the Bruins, Stanford
takes on cross bay rival Cal on
Sunday. The second ranked team,
while not quite as powerful as
UCLA, will provide another ob
stacle to Stanford's climb in the
national rankings.
The Bears were the victors in
the teams' lone matchup earlier
in the season, prevailing 4-3 at
the Irvine Tournament.
The Bears offense, led by Kirk
Everst, will not be as much of a
problem as Cal's defense. Ce
mented by the nation's top goalie,
Jeff Brush, the Golden Bear de
fense is almost impenetrable.
Once a shot is taken, getting it
by the Olympic-alternate Brush
is another problem.
