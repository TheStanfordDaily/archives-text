# WORLD SERIES PREVIEW

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
Los Angeles Dodgers are
hoping to use the words of an
opponent to write another im
probable finish.
Designated hitter Don
Baylor said Oakland wanted to
play the New York Mets in the
World Series because the Ath
letics wanted to beat the best
team in the National League.
The Dodgers beat the Mets
6-0 in Game 7 Wednesday night
for the NL pennant and will
host the first game of the Series
on Saturday.
"We're past the point of
looking for respect," Dodger
catcher Mike Scioscia said. "If
you don't have respect by the
time you get to the World Se

matter what people say. We
might not have the best team
talentwise, but we had the best
team."
Several Dodgers admit they
may not have the best team,
they just don't like hearing

about it from the opposition.
The Mets rallied to win
Game 1 with three runs in the
ninth inning off Orel Hershiser
and reliever Jay Howell.
The next day, Mets pitcher
David Cone wrote a first
person article for the New York
Daily News and said Hershiser
was "lucky" to shut out the
Mets for eight innings and
Howell looked like "a high
school pitcher."
The Dodgers used the article
as a source of inspiration and
beat Cone 6-3 in Game 2.
In Game 7, Hershiser proved
luck had nothing to do with it
by pitching a five-hit shutout.
The Dodgers will need that
kind of pitching to shut down
the powerful A's, who swept
Boston in the American League
playoffs and won 104 games
during the season.
