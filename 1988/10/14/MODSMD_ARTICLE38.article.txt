# WORLD SERIES PREVIEW
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
Los Angeles Dodgers are
hoping to use the words of an
opponent to write another im
probable finish.
Designated hitter Don
Baylor said Oakland wanted to
play the New York Mets in the
World Series because the Ath
letics wanted to beat the best
team in the National League.
The Dodgers beat the Mets
6-0 in Game 7 Wednesday night
for the NL pennant and will
host the first game of the Series
on Saturday.
"We're past the point of
looking for respect," Dodger
catcher Mike Scioscia said. "If
you don't have respect by the
time you get to the World Se
ries, you won't get it. It doesn't
matter what people say. We
might not have the best team
talentwise, but we had the best
team."
Several Dodgers admit they
may not have the best team,
they just don't like hearing

about it from the opposition.
The Mets rallied to win
Game 1 with three runs in the
ninth inning off Orel Hershiser
and reliever Jay Howell.
The next day, Mets pitcher
David Cone wrote a first
person article for the New York
Daily News and said Hershiser
was "lucky" to shut out the
Mets for eight innings and
Howell looked like "a high
school pitcher."
The Dodgers used the article
as a source of inspiration and
beat Cone 6-3 in Game 2.
In Game 7, Hershiser proved
luck had nothing to do with it
by pitching a five-hit shutout.
The Dodgers will need that
kind of pitching to shut down
the powerful A's, who swept
Boston in the American League
playoffs and won 104 games
during the season.
Rookie Tim Belcher is ex-

pected to open the 85th World
Series against Oakland's Dave
Stewart, who comes in at 21-12
with a 3.23 earned-run average.
Belcher won Games 2 and 5 in
the NL playoffs and was the first
rookie to win two games in the
playoffs since the format was
started in 1969.
He finished the regular season
12-6 and won nine of his last 11
decisions.
Although it wasn't officially an
nounced, the Dodgers are ex
pected to start Hershiser in Game
2 against the A's Storm Davis and
John Tudor in Game 3 against
former Dodger Bob Welch, 17-9.
Hershiser, the playoff MVP,
also started Games 1 and 3 and
got a save in Game 4. He pitched
24 and two-thirds innings to set
a playoff record.
"Tim (Belcher) did a great job
for us and he was part of the
team effort that beat the Mets,"
Hershiser said yesterday.
The Dodgers were 17-10 in
games started by Belcher during
the season, and he was 7-2 with
a 2.31 earned-run average after
the All-Star break.
"Tim has been throwing great,"
Lasorda said. "This series is going
to come down to pitching and we
have it.
