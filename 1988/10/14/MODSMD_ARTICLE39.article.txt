# Soccer teams take short trips to face local foes
## Men clash with struggling California 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
It may not be the Big Game,
but when the Stanford men's soc
cer team travels to California on
Sunday it will be a rather impor
tant contest for the Cardinal.
Stanford, fresh off an electrify
ing 1-0 win over national power
University of San Francisco on
Wednesday, hopes to expand upon
the win streak against the Golden
Bears at Cal's Memorial Stadium.
The Cardinal is 8-7 on the year,
while Cal goes in trying to im
prove on a 4-5-2 mark.
The odd thing about this game
is the fact that both teams will
be trying to break two-game
losing streaks on Cal's home turf.
Last weekend, and Wash
ington each upended both teams
on consecutive days.
For Stanford, the experience
was bizarre because it played very
well in its first game of the year
on astroturf only to lose narrowly
(to UCIJ\ 1-0) and then played
inconsistently and was buried by
upstart Washington, 5-2. Cal's
performance was strange simply
because it was their field.

This statistic is an important
one because the Stanford-Cal
game is usually decided by the
home field. In Stanford Coach
Sam Koch*B four previous seasons
here, the home team has won
every time. Last year, on the grass
of Stanford's Harry Maloney
field, the Cardinal was victorious,
1-0.
"Cal is a good team - better
than their record," Koch said.
"And it's the Stanford-Cal game.
It's going to be a tough game, no
matter what the records are."
It'll also be a difficult, impor
tant contest because it is a Pacific
Soccer Conference game. Stanford
is 3-1 in the seven-team league,
losing only to Fresno State. The
title is still within their grasp.
"I think we'll be really pumped
up to play... knowing that Cal is
a league game," senior midfielder
Kevin Woodhouse said. "One of
the main things for our playoff
contention is to win league. It's
really important."
California is 1-0-2 in the league,
but their non-conference perform
