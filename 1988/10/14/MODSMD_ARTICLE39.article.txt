# Soccer teams take short trips to face local foes
## Men clash with struggling California 
### David Hirning Staff writer 
It may not be the Big Game,
but when the Stanford men's soc
cer team travels to California on
Sunday it will be a rather impor
tant contest for the Cardinal.
Stanford, fresh off an electrify
ing 1-0 win over national power
University of San Francisco on
Wednesday, hopes to expand upon
the win streak against the Golden
Bears at Cal's Memorial Stadium.
The Cardinal is 8-7 on the year,
while Cal goes in trying to im
prove on a 4-5-2 mark.
The odd thing about this game
is the fact that both teams will
be trying to break two-game
losing streaks on Cal's home turf.
Last weekend, and Wash
ington each upended both teams
on consecutive days.
For Stanford, the experience
was bizarre because it played very
well in its first game of the year
on astroturf only to lose narrowly
(to UCIJ\ 1-0) and then played
inconsistently and was buried by
upstart Washington, 5-2. Cal's
performance was strange simply
because it was their field.

This statistic is an important
one because the Stanford-Cal
game is usually decided by the
home field. In Stanford Coach
Sam Koch*B four previous seasons
here, the home team has won
every time. Last year, on the grass
of Stanford's Harry Maloney
field, the Cardinal was victorious,
1-0.
"Cal is a good team - better
than their record," Koch said.
"And it's the Stanford-Cal game.
It's going to be a tough game, no
matter what the records are."
It'll also be a difficult, impor
tant contest because it is a Pacific
Soccer Conference game. Stanford
is 3-1 in the seven-team league,
losing only to Fresno State. The
title is still within their grasp.
"I think we'll be really pumped
up to play... knowing that Cal is
a league game," senior midfielder
Kevin Woodhouse said. "One of
the main things for our playoff
contention is to win league. It's
really important."

ances are the ones that are im
pressive. They have beaten the
No. 1 NAIA team, Simon Fraser,
twice this season, both on the road
and at Stanford's AT&T Tourna
ment. The Bears went back east
and narrowly missed upsetting
two perennial soccer powers,
losing to Southern Methodist and
Loyola-Maryland by one goal each
time.
Cal is led by junior Brad Larson,
who has five goals, and goalkeeper
Matt Simi, who has a 1.0 goals
against average and five shutouts.
The major difference between
the two squads going into this
game may be the momentum. Cal
has not played since last week
end's double-drudging in their
home tournament. But Stanford
bounced back to knock off USF,
a great team that was ranked
seventh in one national poll. Has
the Cardinal's ail-too critical con
fidence returned?
You bet, says Woodhouse.
"We're really confident now - that
was the pivotal thing about the
USF game. Prior to USF we were
kind of wondering about our con
fidence level. Now that we've got
a victory, we're confident again."
Final good news for Stanford
is that last weekend's star, all
tournament player Todd Caven,
will be able to play. Caven went
down in the second half of Wed
nesday's game with a mild con
cussion.
