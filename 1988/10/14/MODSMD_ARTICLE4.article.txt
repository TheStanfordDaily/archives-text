# Computer virus infects a number of campus Macintoshes
## 
### Jock Friedly Staff writer 
A computer virus started an
epidemic at Stanford last week
that has infected numerous Mac
intosh computers at Tresidder
Union and Meyer Library, as well
as perhaps dozens of student
owned computers and disks, Stan
ford computer experts said
yesterday.
Detected by a University com
puter specialist who was tipped
off to the problem through
electronic mail, it is not known
who planted the virus. Also, ex
perts don't yet know how far the
virus has spread, or how serious
the problem is.
"I believe that the strain that
hit Tresidder was one of the more

innocuous ones, but there's no
way to know absolutely. However,
all indications point away from
serious harm," said Lance
Nakata, a computer specialist for
Academic Information Resources,
who diagnosed the problem.
A vaccine developed for the ex
tremely contagious virus has been
used to cleanse the Tresidder and
Meyer computers of the disease,
Nakata said, but the virus —
called "nVIR" — may have spread
to the disks of dozens of students
and these disks can continue to
spread the disease until they are
vaccinated.
Computer consultants around
campus are on the lookout for
other outbreaks of the virus. So
far, none have been reported.

lems in the residence clusters,"
said Jeff Merriman, a computer
administrator for Residential Ed
ucation. "The Macintosh
[residence computer coordinators]
are keeping a lookout for any
symptoms and we can thwart any
attack."

The nVIR virus has three
strains, and although it is not
known for sure, Nakata believes
the local epidemic involves only
the least harmful of these. This
strain will simply cause random,
periodic beeps when an infected
program is used.
Another, more virulent strain
of nVIR will randomly erase a
program from the disk sometime
after it has been affected.
Viruses have only recently af
fected the computer world,
causing a scare that experts have
compared to the AIDS epidemic.
They are so named because of
their parallel with the human
viruses that cause disease.

error, a virus is a small program

computer software so that it can
infect other programs. In this
case, the virus is attached to a
Macintosh system — the program
that is needed to start, or "boot
up," the computer.
Once attached to the system,
the virus infects other programs

by copying itself onto applications
like Mac Write or Pascal that are
being run on the computer with
the infected system. When these
disks are used with other system
programs, either on the same
computer or on others, the virus
will spread to those systems.
Left unchecked, the virus will
continue infecting all software it
contacts. Viruses spread easily on
electronic bulletin boards, where
software is posted for common
use. Also, computer pirating
spreads viruses from computer to
computer.
Students who think that they
might have infected disks should
take their disks to the third floor
of Sweet Hall during business
hours.
