# Women take on San Francisco St.
## 
### John Kirks Staff writer 
Whew! The Stanford women's
soccer team, after coming away
with two huge wins in the last
week, takes a deep, relaxing
breath today before heading north
tomorrow.
Their short trek will carry them
22 miles to the campus of the
San Francisco State Gators for a
match that should, at least on
paper, be a bit of a respite for
the Cardinal.
San Francisco State checks into
the match with a modest 3-7-2
record; looking at the Gators' rel
ative lack of talent, SFSU would
be hard-pressed to pull off an up
set of the Cardinal even if Stan
ford was in a terrible slump.
This, as all Stanford soccer fans
are well-aware, is most definitely
not the case. Coach Berhane An
deberhan's Stanford team hap
pens to be on a roll that is un
precedented in recent years for the
Cardinal.
Their five-game winning streak
began on the road in Rhode Island
with wins over Providence and
Rhode Island University. Their
success then carried over into
three straight wins at home
against Santa Clara, Puget Sound
and, most recently, St. Mary's Col
lege.
In those five games, Stanford
outscored its opponents 9-1, with
Stanford's sophomore goalkeeper
Elise Edwards recording four
shutouts to run her season total
of scoreless outings to eight (in
twelve games).
The Gators, because the game
is being played in San Francisco,
have the potential of catching the
Cardinal by surprise. The Cardi
nal's opponent could be a little
tougher than expected at home.
Also, Stanford may have a
slight tendency to look past the
Gators in anticipation of their
match next Thursday against Cal
State-Hayward, the No. 2-ranked
team in NCAA Division 11.
Stanford could not afford such
a setback. Finally, the Cardinal is
getting the national recognition
they have craved for so long. Stan
ford was notified by the NCAA
on Wednesday that the Cardinal
is officially in contention for a
berth in the NCAA tourney later
this fall.
Most impressively, though,
Stanford should jump into the

NCAA Division I Top Twenty next
week, based on the fact that St.
Mary's, Stanford's most recent
victim, was ranked 14th in the
most recent Gatorade National
Soccer Ranking (issued on Oct.
10).
Obviously, a loss to the Gators
does not seem to be in the cards
for Stanford.
