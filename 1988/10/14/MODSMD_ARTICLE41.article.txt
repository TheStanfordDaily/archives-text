# Volleyball heads north to hunt Ducks, Beavers
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
After nine straight wins against
some of the toughest teams in the
nation, the Stanford women's vol
leyball team will take a vacation.
Hoping to solidify its position in
the Pacific 10 Conference, the
Cardinal heads up to the Beaver
State to face Oregon tonight and
Oregon State tomorrow, two be
leaguered but competitive squads
that have seen themselves
relegated to the bottom of the
Pac-10 this season.
The Ducks, currently ranked
20th in the nation on the AV
CA/Tachikara Poll and eighth in
the Pac-10, are 8-8 overall in 1988
and 2-5 in league. The Beavers
are 9-13 overall and 0-7 in Pac-10
play.
By contrast, the Cardinal (14-1,
6-1) is currently tied for second
place in the league with No. 13
Washington, a squad that may
have a tough time holding its
ground when it visits No. 14 USC
and No. 1 UCLA this weekend.
Moreover, after last Saturday's
upset of Hawaii in the champion
ship match of the Josten's Invi
tational, Stanford finds itself
ranked second only to the Bruins
on the AVCA poll. With this boost
of confidence, the Cardinal is
ready to venture away from the
comfortable confines of Maples
Pavilion.
"We're excited to go back on
the road," sophomore Tracy
Hughes said. "Oregon is a good
road trip and the teams are always
competitive.
"We know it's always tough to
play up there," Stanford Coach
Don Shaw said. "Even with
Oregon State, though they haven't
had that much success in the Pac

10, we always struggle against
those guys up there. We've gone
four games, five games the last
couple years. We're just going to
have to go up there and play well."
The Stanford spikers will face
their toughest challenge early, if
the Ducks live up to their ranking.
Though Oregon has found itself
struggling of late, losing five of
its last six matches, the team has
the talent and motivation to put
up a very tough fight.
The two mainstays of the
Oregon offense are junior outside
hitter Michelle Krebsbach and
freshman middle blocker Dawn
Cherroin. Krebsbach, the Pac-10
Freshman of the Year in 1986,
currently leads the Ducks in hit
ting while Cherroin has been
enough of a force at the net to
place sixth in the league in block
ing. On McArthur Court espe
cially, the duo will surely play
well.
"Oregon has a great home court
advantage," Hughes noted. "The
gym was built by the same man
who designed Boston Garden. It's
a rickety wood arena with bleac
her seats on top, and it seems
like the fans are right on you. It's
exciting to play there, no doubt."
Saturday night should be
equally interesting, as the Cardi
nal ventures into the Beavers' den.
Though hardly a powerhouse,
Oregon State is a small and
scrappy team that serves espe
cially well, a potentially dangerous
situation should Stanford lack
concentration or play tentatively.
"The trick in the Pac-10 is to
be consistent," Hughes reflected.
"Night after night you have to be
at the top of your game, especially
if you're Stanford â€” for some
teams, beating us would make
their season."


Stopping Stanford's Kristin Klein, last week's Pac-10 Player of the Week, will be a formidable task for the blockers of Oregon and
Oregon State this weekend.
