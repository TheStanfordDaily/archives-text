After everyone's fine showings
last week, the Greek-of-the-Week
has decided to make things a little
tougher. Last week's panel went
a combined 60-10, but it won't be
so easy this time around.
In addition to a more challeng
ing selection of league match-ups,
this week's list includes Miami-
Notre Dame, Michigan-lowa and
Oklahoma State-Nebraska, as well
as the always tricky Ivy League
contests.
This week's Guest Greek also
provides a challenge as University
President Donald Kennedy brings
his football knowledge to bear
against the sports department All-
Stars.
Kennedy, who can recite the
results and big plays of all previ
ous Stanford-Arizona State
games, picks the Cardinal to win
this time around. "We haven't
beaten Arizona State since I've
been president," he said, "and now
it's time."
Kennedy did go out on a few
wings (albeit hummingbird-sized
ones) in picking the Irish over the

'Canes, the Cowboys over the
'Huskers, and Arizona over Wash
ington State.
Among the regulars, Mark Ro
gowsky is trying to continue the
perfect start he had last week.
"Today I'm on top of the world,"
he said. "But who knows. In two
weeks I could be trailing the
Guest Greek."
In the Upset Special of the
Week, six of seven people chose
Oklahoma State to upset Ne
braska while Robert Pardington
is trying to get to the top with a
pick of lowa over Michigan.
Not to be outdone, Bruce
Sarkisian joined Kennedy by going
with Notre Dame over Miami.
Citing the fact that you can't go
wrong with a bunch of good, Cath
olic boys, the Shark expects
Touchdown Jesus to intervene
and lead the Irish to the promised
land, and a shot at No. 1.
Well, may your teams come
home winners and may your TV
never static-out during that criti
cal fourth-quarter drive. It's adios
from Greekland.
