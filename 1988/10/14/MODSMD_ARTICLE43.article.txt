# Field hockey hoping to down Chico State
## 
### Greg Gottesman 
"Today we were flat."
Indeed, Stanford field hockey
Coach Sheryl Johnson did not
need more than a simple sen
tence to describe her team's play
in Wednesday's 2-1 loss to the
University of the Pacific.
Senior forward Laura
Gartland provided the team's
only spark as she took a cross
pass and pounded it into the net
from her left wing position in
the second half.
"We had a lot of good chances
in the second half but didn't
capitalize," Stanford freshman
Julie Kramer said. "After the up
set, we will be looking to the big
game against Chico State this
weekend to give us a morale
boost."
The past week, however, was
not a total loss, as the Cardinal
team spent Monday afternoon
edging a less-experienced Maine
squad 2-1.
Junior Michelanne Baker
scored early in the first half off
a penalty corner, and senior
Dana Fleming put the icing on
the cake with a penalty stroke
later in the half.
A usually reserved Johnson
said the first half was "the best
I have ever seen them [the Car
dinal] play."
Stanford will square off

against Chico State Saturday at
2 p.m. in what most team mem
bers consider the biggest chal
lenge of the year. Chico State,
which beat the Cardinal team
1-0 earlier this year, sits atop
the NorPac Division. Stanford
presently stands at number two
in the league with a 4-2-1 record.
"Chico State is the number
one team in the league," Johnson
expounded. "We have to beat
them to get back on top and
ensure ourselves a spot in the
nationals."
The team, hoping that home
field advantage plays to its favor
Saturday, received an extra piece
of incentive in the form of a doc
tor's report on two-time all*
American and co-captain Alison
Smith. Smith, who some thought
would be sidelined for the rest
of the year due to a back injury,
should be back within two weeks.
Johnson said the team will
look to Fleming, co-captain
Gartland, and seniors Missy Jol
ley, Wanda Kay Key and Kat
Thomas for leadership and con
sistency in the game against
Chico State and for the
remainder of the year.
After next Saturday's game,
the Cardinal squad will travel
east to clash with some of the
finest teams in the country, in
cluding Temple, North Carolina,
and Old Dominion.
