# Cowell to amplify alcohol education

In an effort to educate stu
dents about the risks of alcohol
abuse, Cowell Student Health
Center is targeting a new alco
hol education program at fresh
men and fraternity members
this quarter.
"We're trying to look at ways
to reduce risks, not to stop
people from drinking," ex
plained program coordinator
Louise Miller. She stressed that
Cowell's program is not de
signed to abolish the use of
alcohol on campus.
Freshmen, who are "least so
cialized in institutional alcohol
traditions;" and fraternity
members, who have the "high
est risk of experiencing alcohol
related consequences," will be
the focus of the new program,
stated a Cowell report released
this month.
Miller pointed to last week's
Phi Delta Theta Kamikaze
party as an example of where
even experienced drinkers
might lose control.
According to Miller, 10 shots
of hard liquor in a three-hour
period would raise the blood
alcohol level of a 150-pound
person to .2 percent — twice
the legal limit. Such excessive
drinking could lead to erratic
emotions and prevent a drinker
from driving safely for 10
hours.
"That kind of practice is very
high-risk behavior," she said.
Miller said she hopes her ed
ucational program will create
an environment where students
can make their own decisions
about drinking without feeling
peer pressure.
"The long-term goal," Miller
said, "is to have students learn
more (about the effects of al
cohol) to make better choices.
The more people know how

The more people
know how drinking
affects themselves
and others, the
more they will be
able to make wise
choices.'

drinking affects themselves
and others, the more they will
be able to make wise choices."
The program will provide
skill-training workshops, aca
demic courses and media cam
paigns to educate students
about the risks of alcohol con
sumption.
In addition, student consult
ants will work as peer coun
selors, administering student
surveys and conducting dorm
based programs.
In a Cowell survey conducted
last May, 6G percent of the
freshmen surveyed reported
that the availability of alcohol
at parties was a main reason
for drinking. The survey also
showed that 37 percent some
times felt hesitant about at
tending social functions where
alcohol was served.
To counteract the pressures
students feel at parties,
Cowell's project will sponsor a
non-profit business, providing
students with party supplies
and ideas. The business, called
"Party Source," will also have
recipies for non-alcoholic bev
erages and listings of disc jock
eys and bnnds. Miller said she
hopes to have "Party Source"
fully operating by winter quar
ter.
