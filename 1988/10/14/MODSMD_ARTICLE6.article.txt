Athough Gov. Michael Dukakis
did not deliver the knock-out
punch seen as necessary to pull
ahead of Vice President George
Bush, most Stanford faculty
agreed that both candidates fared
better in their second presidential
clash last night.
"In general both men came
across better than in the first
debate," Economics Prof. Michael
Boskin said. Despite a good per
formance by Dukakis, Boskin said
"the best [he] can claim is a tie."
"It was much more important
for Governor Dukakis to hit a

home run and score a knockout
because he's behind," Boskin
added.
Economics Prof. Kenneth Ar
row believed Dukakis managed to
get in a few good combinations
and seemed very "knowledgeable"
and "quick," especially on the is
sues of Bush's past record.
However, Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy did not think
the governor was able to deliver
a solid punch. His first answer to

the hypothetical question of
whether Dukakis would sentence
a prisoner to the death penalty if
his wife were murdered was "not
answered directly" or with any
"flicker of emotion," Abernethy
said.
Abernethy added that he
thought it will be difficult for Du
kakis to win while the country
appears to be doing well. "The
Democrats have been afraid to at
tack Reagan," Abernethy said.
"That's like giving up the ship to
begin with."
History Prof. Carl Degler
agreed that this debate was closer
than the last one. He pointed out
that Bush made more jokes and

asides and even had the temerity
to criticize the reporters who were
questioning him.
"It may have turned people off
he was so cocky," Degler said.
However, Boskin had nothing
but high marks for Bush's per
formance, calling it "spectacu
lar. ... He was confident, presi
dential, in control of the issues,
highlighted the issues, differed
with Dukakis, and did so with
grace and good humor," Boskin
said.
Describing Bush as "frank, dis
arming and human," Abemethy
said Bush has "turned his artless
