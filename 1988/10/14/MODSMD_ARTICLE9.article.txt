# Expert calls for SDI deployment

If the United States does not deploy a space-based
missile defense system soon, the Soviet Union will
take control of space, right-wing policy specialist
Gene Vosseler said Wednesday night at a talk hosted
by the Stanford College Republicans.
Vosseler, an adviser to High Frontier — a non
profit group of SDI supporters based in Arlington,
Va. — warned a small audience of 20 at the Law
School about the immense space-defense program
the Soviets have already initiated.
Quoting Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's recent
assertion that the Soviets already have their own
"Strategic Defense Initiative" similar to U.S. efforts,
Vosseler said: "They have spent $150 billion on
their program. They have 10,000 scientists working
at six sites ... on lasers alone."
Although the Soviets have established a small
system defending Moscow from missile attack, they
have not yet deployed any space-based components
for strategic defense. The Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, signed by the superpowers in 1972, allows
the land-based Moscow system, but is held by many
to prohibit the deployment of space-based missile
defense systems.
Proponents of scaling back the U.S. SDI program
have argued in Congress, often successfully, that it
will violate the treaty, if deployed.
But Vosseler argued that SDI needs to be ac
celerated, not slowed. The United States should
immediately build a non-nuclear defensive system
using currently available technology such as inter
ceptor missiles and kinetic kill vehicles, Vosseler
