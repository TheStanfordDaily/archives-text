# Robison returns after summer in NFL
## Former star punter comes home to the Farm after rookie pro tryouts 
### Steve Apfelberg 
Upon meeting Stanford
ate Doug Robison you might think
he was a lineman for the football
team. However, the 6-foot-4, 240
pound Robison is actually an ex
cellent punter who spent the sum
mer trying out for two teams in
the National Football League.
Robison was an All-America
punter for the Cardinal last year.
After the Washington Redskins
signed him as a free agent last
April, he reported to their mini
camp in May and to their
preseason training camp in July
after graduation. Each week a
number of rookies were cut from
the team, but Doug was not
among those cut for the first six
weeks.
Finally, at the end of August,
he was released. Although
Robison had equalled the punting
of the Redskins' starting punter
Steve Cox, he had not surpassed
him. The Redskin coaches weren't
going to replace Cox unless some

one outkicked him.
Robison then went to his Okla
homa home to rest. Ironically, the
day after he returned, the Detroit
Lions called him with an invita
tion to try out. Unfortunately for
Robison, the Lions already had
All-Pro punter Jim Arnold.
Robison knew that he was going
to be with Detroit only until Ar
nold recovered from an injury. A
week later, Arnold was back and
Robison was released for a second
time this summer.
"Making the NFL depends on
three elements: timing, luck, and
skill. I believe that I have the
skill, so hopefully the other two
will fall into place next time,"
Robison said.
Robison, unfortunately, had
only bad luck. The Minnesota
Vilungs were interested and badly
needed a punter, but Detroit, be
cause of its weak record, had first
rights to Robison. Had he been
able to try out with the Vikings,
he would have almost certainly
made the team. By the time the

Lions cut him though, the Vikings
had signed another punter.
Growing up in Oklahoma,
Robison always dreamed of play
ing for the the University of Okla
homa Sooners. After seeing
Robison play on the offensive and
defensive lines in high school, the
Sooners' recruiters concluded
that he wouldn't make it as a
lineman; he was too small. In
stead of becoming discouraged,
Robison became determined to
prove them wrong. After a
vigorous off-season weightlifting
regimen between his junior and
senior year, he gained 35 pounds
to bulk up to 240 pounds.
His senior year in high school,
Robison won the starting punting
job after the graduation of the
team's star punter. That season,
he played both on the offensive
and defensive lines and punted.
Robison was one of the top
punters in the nation and an All-
State defensive lineman. Twenty
eight schools, including Oklahoma
(who wanted him as an offensive

lineman), recruited him. He nar
rowed his choices down to 12 and,
ultimately, picked Stanford be
cause he could kick, play defensive
line and get a strong education.
Ironically, his extreme weight
gain resulted in knee problems.
Following two operations on his
knee, Robison decided to focus en
tirely on punting. After his
recovery, he earned the starting
spot as a freshman and held it
for four years.
Even more ironically, his first
game in a Cardinal uniform was
in Norman, Okla., against his
boyhood heroes. Later in his
freshman year, Robison had to
make a key punt with 38 seconds
left in the game to save a win
against UCLA. He received the
snap from classmate John Tevis,
who was snapping for his first
time in a game. UCLA sent all its
men to block the punt, but
Robison got it off. Had the Bruins
succeeded in blocking it, they
would have very likely scored the
game-winning points.

Robison remembers his final
game, last year's Big Game win
against California, fondly. He beat
out the Bears' punter Scott Tabor
to finish ahead of Tabor and sec
ond in the nation in punting.
Robison received national recogni
tion for his efforts last year.
Shortly after graduation, at the
Redskins' rookie training camp,
Robison realized that professional
football players are human too.
He and his rookie teammates
would spend Sunday nights to
gether because Monday was cut
day and they might not see each
other after that.
The disappointing part of
Robison's NFL experience was the
frustration of knowing that he is
as good as everyone else, but that
the timing wasn't there. He was
never intimidated, but he thought
it was strange being on equal
terms with professional football
players. He quickly grew accus
tomed to it when he saw that he
