# Stanford, ASU try to escape Pac-10 cellar
## 
### Mark Anderegg Staff writer 
The Stanford Cardinal looks to today's
game with renewed optimism after the
thrashing of San Jose State that occurred
last Saturday right here at Stanford Sta
dium. But the hungry Arizona State Sun
Devils will certainly be more of a test. Let's
take a quick stroll through each team's
season thus far.
Stanford played the first 15 minutes of
its season as though it was a national cham
pionship contender. Two John Hopkins'
field goals and a two-yard touchdown pass
from Brian Johnson to tight end Jim Price
made the score 13-0 with three quarters
left to play. Despite playing like mortals
during the second and third quarters, a
late touchdown pass to Henry Green put
the Cardinal back on top, 20-17.
But Stanford's dreams of an upset were
dashed when Rodney Peete, USC's truly
extraordinary quarterback, led the Trojans
to the winning touchdown with less than
two minutes remaining in the ballgame.
The Cardinal bounced back the next
week at home against a weak San Diego
State squad. The Aztecs did not provide
much of a challenge as Stanford raced to
an early lead en route to a 31-10 victory.
John Volpe ran wild in front of 26,000 fans
and the Stanford defense served notice that
it was ready to take on a dangerous Oregon
Ducks' offense the following week.
And it was. But a tremendous effort by
the Cardinal defense was not enough to
overcome the lack of any offense. Latin
Berry rambled four yards for the game's
only touchdown with 8:53 remaining, and
an Oregon interception three minutes later
sealed a 7-3 Ducks victory. The almost
certainly bowl-bound Ducks staved off the
best the Cardinal had to offer, in large

part due to three costly second-half Stan
ford turnovers.
Stanford had no time to rest after its
emotionally draining return from Eugene,
as South Bend, and No. 4 Notre Dame
loomed ahead. Any hopes of an upset were
dispelled early as the Fighting Irish rolled
to a 28-7 halftime lead. Notre Dame's run
ning game completely dismantled the Car
dinal as the Irish rolled up 332 yards on
the ground.
And as if that wasn't enough, quarter
back Tony Rice had his best game through
the air of the young season (11-of-14 for
129 yards). Notre Dame finished the game
a 42-14 winner. The lone bright spot for
the Cardinal was the play of back-up quar
terback Jason Palumbis, who went 16-of-23
for 158 yards and a touchdown, the first
of his young career. Palumbis' good play
was rewarded as he earned the starting
nod the following week against San Jose
State.
Stanford, playing in front of the entire
student body for the first time this year,
jumped out to a 14-0 lead just three
minutes into the game, and never looked
back. The Cardinal steamrolled to an easy
44-12 victory behind a relentless defense
and a solid effort from first-time starter
Palumbis. Stanford's defense forced eight
turnovers and kept the potent Spartan of
fense away from the big play, while
Palumbis threw for 222 yards, and most
importantly, no interceptions. In raising its
record to 2-3, the Cardinal looked ready to
reassert itself as a competitive Pacific 10
Conference squad. We'll see today.
The Arizona State Sun Devils come into
today's game with their season literally
hanging in the balance. With Oregon,
Washington State, and USC all remaining
