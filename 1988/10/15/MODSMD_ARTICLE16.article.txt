# Band fun abounds

Prithee, gentle and good
people all, bear not pride in
your hearts, for as we are swept
through life's conduits, who
among us can say that they
see the wheels of history turn
ing?
Who could have said, 25
years ago, what would be
wrought when an ordinary col
lege marching band cast down
the shackles of oppression put
upon them by their school?
Aye, this year does indeed
mark the Silver Anniversary of
the LSJUMB's Declaration of
Sort-of Independence from the
university, and today we have
collected in this stadium 25
years worth of alumni band
members, Stanford's wretched
refuse cast upon the rocky
shoals of decent society.
For the pre-game show, the
suddenly-huge LSJUMB
presents an easy-to-operate
check list of "Things that stick
to your tongue."
Crazy Glue, of course, sticks
to your tongue, as will any
frozen treat (like a popsicle or
a chihuahua) and as we all
learned in junior high, the
thing that sticks best to your
tongue is another tongue.
The Axe has been known to
stick to a tongue or two (much
to the chagrin of the tongue
operators involved) and if you

were to go around and lick the
entire USA, much of it might
also stick to your tongue.
During half time, the
LSJUMB Shakespeare Com
pany presents their first pro
duction of the season, Hamlet
Lite, a severely condensed ver
sion of the play that put Den
mark on the map.
Hamlet's father's ghost is the
first character to appear on the
admittedly skimpy stage (al
though there is some evidence
that Elsinore did indeed have
a football field atop one of the
parapets).

The usurper Uncle Claudius
appears next (the Band spells
out Clod), inspiring Hamlet to
put on the play within the play
(the Band forms stage inside
already existing stage.)
The sorely confused prince
muses upon the meaning of his
most famous soliloquy (the
Band spells "2B" and then
crosses it out) and finally ap
pears with a sword, only to be
killed by the drum major.

Today we have
collected 25 years
of alumni band
members.
