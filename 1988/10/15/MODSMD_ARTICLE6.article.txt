# Stanford, ASU seek first Pac-10 win
## 
### Robert Pardington Editorial staff 
After a precursory glance down
the Arizona State statistics sheet,
an appropriate reaction would be:
"So who starts?"
The Sun Devils of 1988 lack
any true standout players at the
skill positions. With such
mediocre talent, ASU, it seems,
should be doomed to an average
or below-average season.
Stanford is also not blessed with
the best talent ever to play in the
conference. But the Cardinal at
worst is unpredictable, and
despite some holes and inconsis
tencies, does have a fresh young
talent in quarterback Jason
Palumbis as well as a fiery, im
proving defense.
In today's game, the momen
tum goes to the Cardinal (2-3, 0-2
Pacific 10 Conference), which is
coming off of a lopsided victory
over San Jose State. The Sun
Devils (3-2, 0-1 Pac-10) will try
to rebound from an uninspired,
10-0 loss to Washington.
The last time these two teams
played, in 1985, ASU was a team
on the rise. It was building toward
a fifth-place national ranking in
the final 1986 Associated Press
poll, finishing a -season
punctuated by a Rose Bowl win
over Michigan.
In 1987, the Sun Devils again
saw postseason action, beating Air
Force 33-28 in the Freedom Bowl.
ASU lost four players to the
National Football League draft
this spring, including wide
receiver Aaron Cox and offensive
guard Randall McDaniel. Both
were first-round picks. The entire
defensive line also graduated,
leaving the Sun Devils with a bit
of a rebuilding year ahead of
them.
This year, ASU is under the
guidance of Larry Marmie, the
defensive coordinator for the past
three years under John Cooper,
now head coach at Ohio State.
Looking back on the season so
far, Marmie sees problems, but
remains optimistic about the true
character of his team. "Obviously,
we're not as good a football team
as we want to be or think we can
be," Marmie said.
Recent history favors ASU
today. The Sun Devils have a five
game winning streak against
Stanford, including the 1985 con

test in Tempe, which the Sun
Devils won 21-14 after jumping
ahead 21-0.
Stanford cannot allow ASU to
spring ahead early today. The Car
dinal has yet to score a point in
the fourth quarter this year, and
has averaged less than five points
in the second half.
Marmie, however, has been im
pressed with what he's seen of
Stanford's offense. "The first
thing you think of when you think
of Stanford is offense," Marmie
said. "You know they can score
points and you know they can win
that way. . .. That's enough to
scare you."
Statistically, the Cardinal of
fense holds only a small advantage
over ASU, averaging 320 yards
per game to the Sun Devil's 316.8.
Although Stanford's Jon Volpe
is the best running back on either
team, ASU holds a 26 yard-per
game edge in rushing so far this
season.
The Sun Devil's unrenowned
corps of runners includes junior
tailback David Winsley, who at
only 5-foot-5 has the explosive po
tential to break a defense, as he
showed with his 100 yards against
Lamar two weeks ago. He cur
rently ranks eighth in the Pac-10
in all-purpose yardage with 528
total yards.
Winsley also returns kick-offs,
for an average of 22.4 yards, sec
ond in the Pac-10. Senior fullback
Kirk Wendorf and sophomore tail
back Victor Cahoon join Winsley
in the ASU backfield.
Cardinal fullback Jon Volpe
continued to produce last week
versus SJSU, piling up 88 yards
on only 11 carries. Volpe's 95
yards per game place him among
the leaders nationally.
"Volpe is a vital cog in their
offense," Marmie said. "He is very
well rounded."
Through the air, Brian Johnson
and Jason Palumbis of Stanford
have out-produced ASU's Dan
Ford to date.
Palumbis starts only his second
game of his career today, after
throwing for 222 yards against
SJSU last week. Stanford Coach
Jack Elway shows confidence in
the redshirt freshman by starting
him again this week, but hinted
at some disappointment in
Palumbis' performance.
"(Jason) could have done a bet
ter job at taking what you get

and throwing accurately," Elway
said. "That's usually something
he does well."
ASU's Daniel Ford may not
have the raw talent of Palumbis,
but he has performed consistently
and reliably all year, ranking sixth
among Pac-10 quarterbacks, just
ahead of Palumbis.
Stanford has gotten steady re
ceiving performances out of
Charlie Young, Volpe and Chris
Walsh. Speedsters Henry Green
and Walter Batson are the big
play men.
For the Sun Devils, three
receivers average better than 20
yards per catch, but none of them
have been able to fill the cleats

of the injured senior split-end
Chris Garrett, who tied Cox last
year with four touchdowns.
On the offensive line, Stanford
boasts a strong group of veterans,
led by senior All-America candi
date Andy Sinclair at center.
Junior guard Andy Papathanas
siou and senior tackle John
Zentner have both size and exper
ience and lead a group that can
match up with any defensive line
in the conference.
The ASU line was decimated
by the loss of key seniors, notably
McDaniel, and returns at best a
group of average talent. Senior
Scott Kirby and junior Fedel Un
derwood started every game last

year, as did senior center Steve
Spurling.
Give the edge in the kicking
game to Arizona State. Sun Devil
senior punter Mike Schuh leads
the Pac-10 with his average of
44.9 yards per punt. Junior Alan
Zendejas is a strong kicker, but
has struggled so far this year.
Stanford sophomore John Hop
kins handles the kicking and pun
ting duties for the Cardinal, and
ranks third in the Pac-10 in the
former.

guard Israel Stanley and defensive
tackle Shane Collins.
Senior Saute Sapolu fills one
end position, and has performed
well this season, gathering two
sacks. Junior Greg Joelson, a
walk-on, takes the other end spot
opposite Sapolu.
Cardinal junior defensive tackle
Lester Archambeau will put some
pressure on Ford. Archambeau
has been credited with 34 tackles
and a sack, in addition to numer
ous unofficial "hurries".
Sophomore Scott Palmbush has
two sacks from his right tackle
spot this year. Senior nose guard
Ray Huckstein has been a stand
out for Stanford, but is listed as
questionable for today's contest
because of a turf toe injury.
Sun Devil inside linebackers
Mark Tingstad, a junior, and
sophomore Drew Metcalf compose
a strength of the defense, ranking
first and second on the team in
tackles, with a combined 100.
Junior Rob Hinckley and soph
omore Jono Tunney lead a stellar
group of Cardinal linebackers.
Hinckley has tallied four sacks
and two interceptions, while Tun
ney leads Stanford in tackles with
75.
Senior Kevin Richardson is sec
ond in tackles with 51 from his
inside linebacker position. Right
outside linebacker Bruce Lang has

been dependable.
The Stanford secondary had a
big day last week versus SJSU,
intercepting three passes. Junior
cornerback Alan Grant returned
his pickoff 78 yards for a touch
down, the third longest intercep
tion return in Stanford history.
Seniors Robby Boyd and Rod
ney Dillard, the strong safety and
"devil back," head an experienced
and deep ASU secondary.
Overall, however, it is the in
experience of the Sun Devil de
fense that shows up in the statis
tics, where ASU places last in the
Pac-10 in defense against the run.
Stanford will look to exploit this
weakness by going to Volpe and
Young early in the game. Going
to the air against the Sun Devils
is more dangerous. ASU ranks
third in the Pac-10 in pass defense
through five games.
The Cardinal defense has been
tough all season, allowing less
than 12 points in three of its five
games.
"We've been impressed with
Stanford's defense," Marmie said.
"They're as physical as we've
seen."
One thing that both the Cardi
nal defense and offense will have
to watch is penalties.
Last week, against the Spar
tans, Stanford's 19 penalties
broke the school record and tied
the Pac-10 mark.
Despite the sloppiness, Elway

saw good signs in the SJSU con
test that he hopes will carry over
to this week.
"I thought we had pretty good
balance and good execution," El
way said. "Our lines dominated,
and we took advantage of oppor
tunites, especially in the first
half."
To avoid a second-straight shut
out, Marmie has to be thinking
of improving the performance of
his multiple offense today: "We
haven't been as multiple as we
should be," Marmie said.
Elway hopes the Cardinal can
score quickly against ASU, as it
did versus the Spartans: "You'd
like to start every game like we
did," he said.
The first score of today's game
may in fact determine the winner.
Both squads are typically poor fin
ishers.
Nonetheless, what Elway and
Marmie are chiefly concerned
with, undoubtedly, is getting their
first Pac-10 conference victory.
