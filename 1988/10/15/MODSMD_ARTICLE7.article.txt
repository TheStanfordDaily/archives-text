# Hinckley powers Card defense

### Josh Kreinberg 
Stanford's number 43 is one that many offensive
players around the Pacific 10 Conference may have
a hard time forgetting. It belongs to Stanford outside
linebacker Rob Hinckley who drills it into their
heads every weekend.
Last season the 6-foot-5, 245 pound senior stuffed
many an opposing offense, tallying 86 tackles and
six sacks. This year, Hinckley is well on his way
to repeating that achievement. He has compiled 41
tackles and two interceptions through Stanford's
first five games.
Hinckley leads the Cardinal defense in two
categories: most sacks (with a total of four so far
this season), and most tackles for a loss (with a
total of three for a combined loss of seven yards).
Hinckley makes the big plays by psyching himself
up and constantly maintaining his intensity.
"When I'm tired and a little beat up, I think
about the fact that I only have 12 shots to play for
a whole year's work, and the guy across from me
is trying to take that away from me," Hinckley
said. "I guess I just get a little selfish."
This "selfishness" has enabled Hinckley to ter
rorize backfields and leave an impression on the
opposition as well as on the Stanford coaches.
"He's awesome," Stanford outside linebacker
Coach Jack Gilmete said. "Right now he's playing
on a level much higher than we ever expected of
him. We only hope he can stay healthy."
Hinckley regards his personal success as a part
of the whole team's effort, and would rather have
his team do well than gain personal recognition.
Hinckley sees his job in every game as finding
"away for the team to win. If I have a great game
and yet the team loses, my personal statistics mean
nothing to me," Hinckley said.
Hinckley didn't have to worry about that situation
last weekend when the Cardinal blasted San Jose
State 44-12, a game in which Hinckley had three
tackles and a sack.

"The team played well during last week's game,"
Hinckley said. "Our challenge will be to play con
sistently well this season and show that we can play
with anybody. Hopefully we'll have a chance at a
bowl, but we have to take it each game at a time."
The Cardinal will face yet another challenge today
as it takes on the Sun Devils of Arizona State, a
team that Hinckley feels is underrated.
"ASU will be a strong test," Hinckley said . "We
can do a lot against them, but everybody will have
to have a good game. There's no room for failure."
Hinckley, a communications major, applies his
drive for success to other areas of life as well as
football. He would like to have the opportunity to
play in the National Football League some day but
he doesn't want to miss out on having a full college
experience and would never consider giving up his
next and final year of school to play football.
A number of people, both on and off the gridiron,
have influenced Hinckley and helped him to estab
lish his values.
"I really respect my father and grandfather,"
Hinckley said. "And my high school football coach,
Bob Ladoceour, is probably the closest thing I have
to an idol."
As a freshman at De La Salle High School in
Walnut Creek, Hinckley began his football career.
He didn't join the varsity squad, however, until his
junior year, as is common practice at De La Salle,
which consistently fields a strong football team.
Hinckley also competed on his high school track
and basketball teams, but has since had to give up
even recreational basketball because he has a "ten
dency to sprain an ankle" every time he steps on
the court.
Hinckley's younger brother, Jim, another gradu
ate of De La Salle, is now a redshirt freshman here.
Rob has helped his brother make the transition
from high school to college academics and athletics.
As a result, Jim feels that the two are "closer
