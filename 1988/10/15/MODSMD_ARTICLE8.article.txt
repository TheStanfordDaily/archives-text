# Zendejas follows family footsteps

Alan Zendejas may be follow
ing in the footsteps of great
ness, but that hasn't slowed
his pace.
Being the younger brother
of Luis and Max Zendejas, as
well as the cousin of Joaquin
and Tony, hasn't been an easy
experience for Alan. But, as the
current place kicker for the Ar
izona State Sun Devils, Alan
Zendejas appreciates the
benefits he receives from his
famous relatives.
When Zendejas arrived at
ASU in the fall of 1986, he
realized that, as the younger
brother of ASU's All-America
placekicker and former NCAA
career point record holder Luis,
many expected similar ac
complishments from him.
"[The coaches] accepted me as
I was," Alan said. "But the fans
expected a lot of me .. . they
always do."
The name Zendejas, however,
is more than enough to create
expectations in a football fan's
mind. The Zendejas family has
not only seeded the National
Football League with several
place kickers but also now has
Alan, in his junior year, and

youngest brother Alex waiting
to join the three Zendejas
brothers currently in the pros.
Luis, after playing for the
Arizona Outlaws of the United
States Football League, joined
the Philadelphia Eagles as
their place kicker. Max kicks
for the Green Bay Packers, and
cousin Tony is with the Hous
ton Oilers. Cousin Joaquin also
played in the NFL, kicking for
the New England Patriots in
1985 before a leg injury ended
his career.
But the expectations for Alan
that result from the abilities
of his talented brothers don't
disturb him or hurt his per
formance. "[Last year] I prac
ticed harder to prove some
thing because I was known as
'Luis' little brother.' But Luis
was very supportive," Alan
said. "It really worked out for
the best."
Alan's hard work has cer
tainly paid off. After hitting 15
of 19 field goal attempts and
30 of 31 point-after-touchdown
attempts, Alan received
honorable mention All-
American and second team All-
Pacific 10 Conference ac
colades. He also led the Sun
