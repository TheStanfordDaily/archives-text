# Zendejas follows family footsteps

### David Earnest Editorial staff 
Alan Zendejas may be follow
ing in the footsteps of great
ness, but that hasn't slowed
his pace.
Being the younger brother
of Luis and Max Zendejas, as
well as the cousin of Joaquin
and Tony, hasn't been an easy
experience for Alan. But, as the
current place kicker for the Ar
izona State Sun Devils, Alan
Zendejas appreciates the
benefits he receives from his
famous relatives.
When Zendejas arrived at
ASU in the fall of 1986, he
realized that, as the younger
brother of ASU's All-America
placekicker and former NCAA
career point record holder Luis,
many expected similar ac
complishments from him.
"[The coaches] accepted me as
I was," Alan said. "But the fans
expected a lot of me .. . they
always do."
The name Zendejas, however,
is more than enough to create
expectations in a football fan's
mind. The Zendejas family has
not only seeded the National
Football League with several
place kickers but also now has
Alan, in his junior year, and

youngest brother Alex waiting
to join the three Zendejas
brothers currently in the pros.
Luis, after playing for the
Arizona Outlaws of the United
States Football League, joined
the Philadelphia Eagles as
their place kicker. Max kicks
for the Green Bay Packers, and
cousin Tony is with the Hous
ton Oilers. Cousin Joaquin also
played in the NFL, kicking for
the New England Patriots in
1985 before a leg injury ended
his career.
But the expectations for Alan
that result from the abilities
of his talented brothers don't
disturb him or hurt his per
formance. "[Last year] I prac
ticed harder to prove some
thing because I was known as
'Luis' little brother.' But Luis
was very supportive," Alan
said. "It really worked out for
the best."
Alan's hard work has cer
tainly paid off. After hitting 15
of 19 field goal attempts and
30 of 31 point-after-touchdown
attempts, Alan received
honorable mention All-
American and second team All-
Pacific 10 Conference ac
colades. He also led the Sun
Devils in scoring in 1987 with 75
points.
And after ASU's 33-28 victory
over Air Force in last year's Free
dom Bowl in which Alan booted
two field goals, the hopes of fans
that another Zendejas would be
headed for the NFL were reborn.
"There's a lot of expectations
for me. . . . [Everyone in my
family] is expecting me to go pro,"
Alan said.
After the team's slow start this
season, however, the fans' expec
tations may have lessened though
Alan's have not. "I'm not disap
pointed at all," Alan said. "[The
missed field goals] were just some
thing that happened in game sit
uations. The team looks good in
practice. We just need to put it
together in the game."
The Zendejas family supports
Alan when he struggles both on
and off the field. The brothers,
who he grew up playing soccer
with, and his proud parents "are
always there for me," Alan said.
"Whenever I feel bad about school
or about a game or whatever, my
family is there. I think that's whjr
we keep kicking."
Alan's family has played a big
role in his and his brothers'
careers. The Zendejas family, from
Chino, California, always ex
pected their sons to play profes
sional sports.
"My father expected us to go
into professional soccer. [But] we
saw it was easier to get a schol
arship by kicking field goals."

That scholarship and his edu
cation are important to Alan.
When asked what his personal
goals are, he emphatically says "I
want to graduate." The criminal
studies major wants to work in
law enforcement.
That, however, may have to
wait until after a professional
football career, a possibility Alan
views with guarded optimism.
"Right now, I just want to have
the best time of my life. I don't
know if I am going to ever play
professionally, so I'm concentrat
ing on school."
And if Alan does make it to the
NFL, how would he feel facing
his brother on the football field?
"All I'd want is that he does
well and that I do well," he said.
That's the kind of person Alan
Zendejas is. His personal goal is
not to be better than Max, Joa
quin, Tony and Luis. Rather, Alan
wants "to leave [college] knowing
that I'm a better person than
when I came in."
The pro scouts, not Alan, will
worry about whether he is a bet
ter place kicker or not. Alan
refuses to worry about being Luis'
younger brother, or Max's, or Joa
quin and Tony's cousin.
He will just continue to kick
the ball as the Zendejas family is
known to do. And even if he
doesn't play professionally, he has
followed in the footsteps of the
Zendejas family. Alan Zendejas
may or may not ever be a great
football player, but he is a good
person with a great future in front
of him.
And, most likely, he'll be kick
ing field goals.
