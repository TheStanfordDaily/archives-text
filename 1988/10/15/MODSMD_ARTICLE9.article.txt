# Arizona State â€“ Stanford matchups
## 
### 
Sun Devil quarterback Daniel
Ford leads ASU in average yards
per game with 177.8 and is
praised by Coach Larry Marmie
as "one of our most consistent
players." But last week the Sun
Devil offense was shut out by
Washington as Ford struggled.
Today he will face a Stanford sec
ondary that registered three in
terceptions last week, including
cornerback Alan Grant's 78-yard
return for a touchdown.

Through five games, ASU tail
back David Winsley leads the Sun
Devils in rushing with only 189
total yards, a statistic indicative
of ASU's weak rushing attack.
Winsley did, however, rush for
over 100 yards two weeks ago
against Lamar. Stanford inside
linebacker Jono Tunney, a junior
enjoying perhaps his finest
season, spearheads the Cardinal's
defense against the run. Tunney
currently leads the Cardinal in
tackles with 75 and has three
sacks to his credit.

Redshirt freshman quarterback
Jason Palumbis got his first col
legiate win last week starting for
the first time in his career. His
statistics, however, were less than
stellar as he completed only 13 of
35 attempts for a total of 222
yards. Sun Devil free safety Nat
han LaDuke leads ASU's pass de
fense in interceptions and is
fourth overall in tackles. The in
experienced Palumbis will be chal
lenged by LaDuke to find the open
receiver, a skill for which Coach
Elway has praised his quarter
back.

Junior right tackle Scott
Palmbush is the leader of Stan
ford's defensive line, which played
tenaciously last week against San
Jose State but may be slowed by
injuries today. Stanford starting
noseguard Ray Huckstein is suf
fering from a foot injury and is
listed as "questionable." ASU
right tackle Fedel Underwood will
face Palmbush and try to slow
down the Cardinal pass rush
enough to provide Ford with the
time he needs to run the Sun
Devils' multiple offensive forma
tions.

If ASU's 4-3 defense is to stop
Stanford tailback Jon Volpe, in
side linebacker Mark Tingstad
will be the key. Tingstad leads the
Sun Devils in tackles with 52,
while Volpe has gained a total of
475 yards in five games. If Volpe
can break through ASU's four
down linemen, he will have a big
day. . . unless, of course, Tingstad
stops him.

ASU punter Mike Schuh is
having a considerably better
season than Cardinal punter John
Hopkins. Schuh, who ranks fourth
nationally in punting, leads the
Pac-10 with his 44.9 yards-per
punt average. Hopkins, on the
other hand, has averaged only
35.7 yards per punt, but has had
eight of his 15 punts downed in
side the opponents 20-yard line.
ASU placekicker Alan Zendejas
has hit on only two of his five
field goal attempts, whereas Hop
kins, who doubles as the Cardi
nal's placekicker, is 7-of-12 this
season.
