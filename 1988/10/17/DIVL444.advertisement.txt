Physical Education
My first time tutoring was a night
to remember. Mv student was some
thing called Bone Crusher Reed, a.k.a.
Hilly Jo, defensive tackle for the foot
ball team.
I had the shock of mv life w hen
he answered his dorm rtx)m d(x>r.
He was about six fcxrt seven...in
diameter. And when he shook mv *
hand, I thought Fd never get it back.
So there I was, face-to-knee with
the big man on campus, wondering
how I was going to relate American
Literature to The Hulk.
But then he pulled out a can of
Orange Cappuccino. I w as shocked!
Could it be that this tough j(xk
liked its delicate taste? And when
Rone Crusher brought out the bone
china, I was beyond belief
Reading the expression on my
face, he said,"What can I say? I like it.
The Cafe Franca is is pretty gtxxi,
t(X) v Well, whos going to argue, I
thought. As we sipped our Orange
Cappuccino, I discovered that Billv Jo
loves reading novels; his onlv problem
was poetry So I gave him tips on
reading Kmily Dickinson, and he
gave me a copy of Ann Bcattics
"Falling in Place"
All I could think was, Dads never
going to believe this!
