group said yesterday its gunmen
killed a leader of the Protestant
Ulster Defense Association be
cause he betrayed the associa
tion's cause in Northern Ireland.
The outlawed Ulster Freedom
Fighters said its members killed
James Craig and George Raney
at east Belfast's Castle Inn pub
on Saturday.
Four other people were wound
ed as the killers sprayed the
crowded room with gunfire.
In a statement to the news
media, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters said Craig, 47, was the
target and claimed the other vic
tims were shot when Raney tried
to attack one of the gunmen.
Initially it was suspected that

guerrillas of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army carried out the
attack.
The predominantly Roman
Catholic IRA has been been fight
ing for years to unite Northern
Ireland, a British province where
Protestants outnumber Catholics
3-2, with the mainly Catholic Re
public of Ireland.
Protestant extremists formed
organizations to battle the IRA.
The Ulster Defense Association
is not illegal but the Ulster Free
dom Fighters is. The Ulster De
fense Association was formed in
1971 as an umbrella organization
for Protestant vigilante groups
and British news reports have
said the Ulster Freedom Fighters
is the association's military
branch.

Some east Belfast residents sug
gested that Craig's killing in
volved racketeering.
Press Association, the British
domestic news agency, said the
ruling council of the Ulster De
fense Association last year or
dered an investigation into Craig's
activities. It said he had been ac
cused of skimming money from
the estimated $5.2 million raised
annually through rackets oper
ated by Protestant extremists.
In 1985 Craig and two other
men appeared in the Belfast
Magistrates' Court to face 33
charges related to extortion from
contractors.
Witnesses who testified wore
hoods to avoid reprisals. The case
was dropped before going to trial.
