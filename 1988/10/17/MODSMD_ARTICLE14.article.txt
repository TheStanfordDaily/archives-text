ST. CLOUD, Minn. (AP) â€”
Hundreds of rioting students
burned furniture and clashed
with police in a second night of
homecoming weekend violence
that resulted in 50 arrests by of
ficers clad in riot gear, police said
yesterday.
At least six people, including a
police officer and a person found
in a trash carrier, were treated
at a hospital for minor injuries
suffered Saturday night and early
yesterday, said hospital nursing
supervisor Patricia Anderson.
As many as 1,500 St. Cloud
State University students were in
volved in the rioting in a four
block area on Friday and Saturday
nights, Assistant Police Chief Jim
Moline said.
Students set off firecrackers
and some played the Beatles' song

"Revolution" on a stereo as police
swept through the crowd, esti
mated at about 700 people Sat
urday night. Other people tore
down street signs and jumped on
cars, or threw beer bottles and
pieces of lumber.
About 60 officers, including
some from the State Patrol and
neighboring counties, shot tear
gas to disperse the crowd and
made 46 arrests, most on mis
demeanor charges of unlawful
conduct or criminal damage to
property, Moline said.
After a lull of a few hours, 150
officers were sent in early yester
day to break up crowds of 150 to
200 people, some of whom had
set fire to furniture and a trash
carrier that had been dragged into
the street, Moline said.
"It's like a battle between the

police and the students," said
Karen Jacobs, the managing
editor of the student newspaper,
the University Chronicle, who
watched the disturbance from her
dormitory room.
The riots broke out in the midst
of homecoming celebrations by
the school's 16,400 students. Wit
nesses said the problems began
when officers tried to break up
loud parties and fights.
"The catalyst for this whole
thing was a lot of young people
with a lot of booze in them,"
Moline said. "They're not experi
enced enough with alcohol and
they just go kind of crazy."
Moline said that in his 31 years
on the police force, the weekend's
violence could be topped only by
demonstrations against the Viet
nam War in the 19605.
