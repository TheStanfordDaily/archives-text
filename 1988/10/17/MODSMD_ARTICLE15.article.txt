Mandela denies 'cooperation 1
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -
Winnie Mandela visited her husband, black
nationalist Nelson Mandela, at his tightly
guarded hospital room yesterday and said he was
angry at suggestions he was cooperating with
the government.
President P.W. Botha, while in Switzerland
hist week, suggested the jailed African National
Congress leader could be freed if he "continues
cooperating with the authorities, as he is doing
at present."
"About the so-called cooperation with the gov
ernment, Mandela says he will answer to that
himself, Mrs. Mandela told reporters. "As he
said that, he looked very angry."
Mandela, 70, is recuperating from tuberculosis
at the Constantiaberg Clinic, a modern private
hospital in ('ape Town. He became ill in August,
and doctors expect him to make a complete

recovery in two to three months.
Mrs. Mandela said she and her husband did
not discuss the latest wave of speculation that
he may soon be freed after 26 years in prison.
"All the rumors about his release are sheer
rumors," she said.
Hope dwindles for trapped whales
BARROW, Alaska (AP) â€” With time running
out for three young whales trapped in Arctic
Ocean ice near Point Barrow, rescuers yesterday
anxiously eyed an offshore wind as they awaited
the arrival of a huge ice-breaking barge.
The barge wasn't expected until Tuesday and
the wind could blow away any hope for the Cal
ifornia gray whales stranded more than a week
ago.
The whales were bleeding and battered after
bashing against the jagged ice, and their condition
seemed to be worsening.
