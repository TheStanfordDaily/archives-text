Hoover governance can
wait for new director

Give peace a chance.
In the long, battle-scarred
relationship between the
University and the Hoover Insti
tution, a much-needed respite was
declared by the Faculty Senate last
week.
Hoover is in the process of choos
ing a new director to replace W.
Glenn Campbell. Until a candidate
is chosen, it is inappropriate to ar
gue about the future of the think
tank.
Let's be honest. The personality
of Campbell, who has occupied his
position as head of Hoover for 28
years, has had a lot to do with the
friction generated in the relation
ship between the two bodies. Much
of the strife between Stanford and
Hoover has been a conflict of per
sonalities rather than bylaws.
Now that Campbell's retirement
is imminent, a search committee
has begun to look for the new di
rector. And to insure that everyone
is satisfied with the new director,
safety nets exist throughout the
selection process.
Once the search committee nar
rows its choice down to one, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
will have an opportunity to ap
prove or reject the final candidate.
Although no Stanford president

has ever turned down the recom
mendation of the Hoover director
on a potential appointment, Ken
nedy does have the authority to
veto a candidate.
Furthermore, the appointment
of a new Hoover director must also
be passed by the University Board
of Trustees, so there are in fact
two separate entities which must
approve the choice of a candidate.
And it is highly unlikely that
either will allow a director as
abrasive as Campbell to be ap
pointed.
A new director will bring a dif
ferent and hopefully more
hospitable outlook to the relation
ship between Stanford and Hoover.
A director willing to work out com
promises with University depart
ments rather than constantly
trying to burn down bridges could
alleviate most of the sources of
conflict between Hoover and Stan
ford.
Given the potential for improve
ment in the relationship, it is in
appropriate to begin discussing a
revision in the governance of Hoo
ver.
Criticism of the present Hoover-
Stanford relationship, as often
voiced by Profs. John Manley and
Ron Rebholz, does have a place in
the academic environment.
But, during a time that offers
so much potential for improving
the relationship, the academic
communities should suspend their
criticism, work together and await
the outcome of the appointment
process.
