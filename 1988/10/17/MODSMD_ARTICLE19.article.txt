## The
						dreaded birthday 
### 
MY SECOND GRAY HAIR was
found this summer in Jensen,
Utah. I had been twenty-two for
only six hours. Just before a memorable
sunrise rendition of "Happy Birthday,"
my friend Maria graciously announced
her discovery to the group, and then
yanked it from my head.
I sat stunned as they sang. Not because
Maria had also ripped five or six other
hairs from my head, but because I was
twenty-two. And aging. Young at heart,
gray on the head.
"Happy Birthday to you," they con
cluded as the sun began to heat every
thing around us. Hooray. Tomorrow I'll
look thirty, and soon after I'll be thirty.
And then sixty.
"So how does it feel?" asked Clark, the
youngest member of our group who has
yet to turn sixteen, eighteen, or even
twenty-one. 1 nearly choked on a pancake.
"Oh, it's just another day," I said in
my mother's voice. For the first time in
my life, my birthday, July 7, my favorite
day of the year, had become my enemy.
I hadn't looked forward to this day. A
twenty-second birthday brings no new
privileges; it merely assures you that you
are getting older. The gray hair was an
unnecessary confirmation of that natural
fact. From then on, it would only get
worse. Although I will not be considered
old for many years, the prospect of aging,
as a woman, is frightening.
I was born in 1966. I grew up sheltered
from the hard-won battles of the women's
movement; I heard only of its continued
successes. Perhaps my parents delayed
telling me of my mother's battle with

her traditional parents so that I would
never doubt my abilities.
I have since learned that when she
graduated from high school, my mother's
parents forced her to attend secretarial
school in order to enter the vocation of
a "proper" woman. Bored, she quit. De
spite my grandparents' tremendous dis
approval, she worked for four years and
then paid her way through college and
graduate school.
I have never faced a barrier so great
as severe parental disapproval or the lack
of support. In the third grade, I an
nounced my intention of becoming a sur
geon. In contrast to my mother's exper
ience, my parents gave me a copy of
Gray's Anatomy.
Both my father and my mother are
professionals. They taught me that a
woman's equal capabilities, talents and
qualifications are facts, not questions.
Like many others of my generation, I
had always expected that any "problems"
a woman might face would disappear by
the time I came of age, at twenty-two.
That hasn't happened. With each
birthday, I find new stumbling blocks
that exist because I am a woman. And
on my twenty-second birthday in eastern
Utah, as I lamented the coming of my
second gray hair, I was forced to recog
nize yet another obstacle. Simply put,
women in America aren't supposed to age.
To fight the natural changes that a
birthday brings, women increasingly and
unnaturally suffer for beauty. In 1986,
more than half a million cosmetic (not
corrective) procedures — face lifts,
liposuctions, breast augmentations —

were performed, not merely to sculpt the
perfect body, but to hang on to the last
fragments of physical youth. This marks
a 24 percent increase from the number
performed in 1984.
We live in a society obsessed with
youth. And the burden of it falls over
whelmingly upon women. Take, for ex
ample, the evening news. Why, at 50,
was Dan Rather called an up-and-coming
anchorman, while Barbara Walters was
considered over-the-hill? And how many
men can any of us name that have un
dergone the bruises and cuts of a face lift?
Often I adopt my naive childhood at
titude that judgements are not made nor
are limits set on the basis of gender alone.
This way, as my parents once strategized,
I will not doubt myself despite the some
times subtle discouragement of others.
And who knows? Just last week I
flipped on the early morning news and
saw that an intelligent Kathleen Sullivan,
anchorwoman of ABC's "This Morning,"
has stopped dying her graying hair. Hope
fully someday we'll all come of age, so
that if ever I have a daughter, she will
not think to write a column about the
color of her hair.
