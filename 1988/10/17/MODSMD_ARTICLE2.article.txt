# Two racial incidents strike Ujamaa House
## Freshmen have confessed to one act 
### Brad Hayward Ann Marsh Staff writers 
Residents of Ujamaa House were left
shocked and traumatized this weekend
after two white Lagunita residents admit
ted to posting a racially offensive flier on
the door of a black Ujamaa resident.

The admission followed
on the heels of two weeks
of increasing concern that
began Oct. 1 with the dis
covery of the offensive flier
which depicted a crude
caricature of Beethoven as
a black man. It intensified
Oct. 14 after a large poster
was discovered in Ujamaa
with the word "Niggers"

scrawled in capitals across its face.
Freshmen Ben Dugan and Gus Heldt
admitted to posting the Beethoven flier but
denied responsibility for the second inci
dent. Currently, there are no suspects in
that incident.
An "emergency" meeting was held yes
terday in Ujamaa where the two men
delivered an apology to residents for their
actions.
In a joint statement released early this

morning, Dugan and Heldt said, "At the
meeting, we apologized for our actions. We
both admitted to the Beethoven flier. We
denied doing the second poster."
"There was hysteria" at the meeting,
said Ujamaa resident assistant Kim Cole
man. Rachel Wiesen, also an RA at Ujamaa,
said the apology seemed insincere and "per
functory."

Ujamaa resident Gregg
Gottesman said, "People
started getting pissed be
cause the apology really
sucked."
Eventually, the tension
became so high that people
"hyperventilated, people
were wretching, not just
black students by any
means (and) men and

women both," Wiesen said.
Junior Jim Spencer, a resident of Naran
jaa, concurred and said that "everyone fled
the room, guys and girls."
"It was really one of the most distressing
things I've seen in the time I've been at
Stanford," said Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs. Robinson was
called to Ujamaa after the meeting broke


Dugan


Heldt
up to witness the effect of the
incidents on the students.
Robinson said Dugan and Heldt
will probably not be able to con
tinue living in their current resi
dences.
University Provost James
Rosse will begin an investigation
of the incidents today at 8:30 a.m.,
when he is scheduled to meet with
Ujamaa residence staff members.
"If the investigation establishes
the facts as they have been pre
sented to me, I could expect
charges would be brought under
the Fundamental Standard,"
Rosse said.
Both Dugan and Heldt have
been temporarily removed from
their Lagunita housing.
According to the residence staff
at Ujamaa, the two incidents were
part of a chain of events that
stretched over two weeks:
• The first racial act may have
been motivated by a discussion
Sept. 29 among several Lagunita

East residents, including Dugan,
Heldt and B.J. Kerr, on whose
door the flier was found. Their
conversation about the contribu
tions of African Americans to
American music led to a heated
debate about the possibility of
Beethoven being of African des
cent.
• Around 2 a.m. on Oct. 1, a
residence staff member found the
defaced Beethoven flier on a black
board next to the door of Ujamaa
sophomore Kerr, who had partic
ipated in the discussion. The pic
ture of Beethoven "was colored
brown, given wild curly hair, big
lips and red eyes," according to a
statement released by the resi
dence staff to The Daily. The flier
was taken down by the residence
staff, who still have it.
Kerr was not available for com
ment last night.
The Ujamaa residence staff did
not notify residents about the flier
"because we wanted to figure out
the full circumstances behind it,"
without alarming anyone, accord
ing to Maurice Rabb, head aca
demic adviser at Ujamaa.
At this point, the staff began

its own investigation.
•On Oct. 14, around 2 or 3
a.m., a large poster was discovered
on the second floor of Ujamaa
with the word "Niggers" written
across the front. The poster ad
vertised a party sponsored by the
UC-Berkeley chapter of the black
fraternity Kappa Alpha Psi. Kerr
and another resident found the
poster and the members of the
residence staff removed it imme
diately.
• Later that evening, the resi
dence staff called an emergency
meeting with the entire dorm to
inform them of the incidents and
to discuss their effects. The entire
situation "erupted" at that point,
according to Rabb.
Wiesen said a "tone of shock"
hung over the discussion and
"concern was aired by both black
and white students."
Although Dugan, an Ujamaa
resident, was present at the meet
ing, he did not confess his role in
the first incident "because he
wanted to wait until people cooled
down," according to Coleman.
• During the meeting, one
Ujamaa resident privately told a
member of the residence staff that
she recalled overhearing a conver
sation planning the alteration of
the Beethoven flier.
• After the resident said the per
son spoke with an English accent,
Ujamaa staff decided to confront
Naranja House resident Heldt
about the incident. Heldt admitted
that he and Dugan had defaced
the flier.
• Over the course of the eve
ning, Ujamaa and Naranja resi
dence staff spoke with Dugan and
Heldt individually, and then to
gether. The two apologized for
their action and agreed to address
Ujamaa residents at another
"emergency" meeting yesterday at
noon.
• Both Ujamaa and Naranja
residents attended yesterday's
meeting, along with Residential
Dean for the West Campus Ron
Hudson. According to members of
the residence staff, Dugan and
Heldt admitted to defacing the
Beethoven flier, apologized and at
tempted to explain their actions.
However, most residents were
not convinced of the students' sin
cerity, according to Wiesen.
Wiesen quoted the two as saying,
at one point, "one, two, three,
We're sorry." Describing their at
titude as "very arrogant," Wiesen
and others said neither could un
derstand the intensity of the re
action to the events.
Both Dugan and Heldt said they
were "drunk and stoned" when

they defaced the flier, but said
this was not an excuse for their
actions, according to members of
the residence staff. Spencer and
Gottesman concurred that Dugan
and Heldt confessed to being
drunk.
In an increasingly charged at
mosphere, Kerr rose to his feet
to say he felt betrayed by Dugan
and Heldt, with whom he had
sometimes conversed, Coleman
said. After Kerr found the flier,
he and Dugan reportedly main
tained contact before Dugan ad
mitted to having posted it.
When Kerr was speaking, Cole
man said that, at one point,
Dugan and Heldt seemed to shrug
off his comments. "Here he was
making this emotional plea, and
he didn't feel like they were lis
tening to him," she said.
In the early-morning statement,
Dugan states that he "was as
saulted by B.J. There was mini
mal contact."
"As soon as he raised his fist,
I fell flat on the ground." Dugan
said.
Spencer said that Kerr got vi
olent and tried to attack either
Dugan or Heldt. At least five res
idents were needed to restrain
Kerr, he added.
Although members of the resi
dence staff denied that there was
any physical conflict during the
meeting, they said they felt it nec
essary to remove Dugan and
Heldt from the meeting as it
reached an emotional crescendo.
"There are freshmen who never
thought this would happen. Their
whole image of Stanford has been
shattered," Coleman said.

Residents of Ujamaa House were left
shocked and traumatized this weekend
after two white Lagunita residents admit
ted to posting a racially offensive flier on
the door of a black Ujamaa resident.

The admission followed
on the heels of two weeks
of increasing concern that
began Oct. 1 with the dis
covery of the offensive flier
which depicted a crude
caricature of Beethoven as
a black man. It intensified
Oct. 14 after a large poster
was discovered in Ujamaa
with the word "Niggers"

scrawled in capitals across its face.
Freshmen Ben Dugan and Gus Heldt
admitted to posting the Beethoven flier but
denied responsibility for the second inci
dent. Currently, there are no suspects in
that incident.
An "emergency" meeting was held yes
terday in Ujamaa where the two men
delivered an apology to residents for their
actions.
In a joint statement released early this

morning, Dugan and Heldt said, "At the
meeting, we apologized for our actions. We
both admitted to the Beethoven flier. We
denied doing the second poster."
"There was hysteria" at the meeting,
said Ujamaa resident assistant Kim Cole
man. Rachel Wiesen, also an RA at Ujamaa,
said the apology seemed insincere and "per
functory."

Ujamaa resident Gregg
Gottesman said, "People
started getting pissed be
cause the apology really
sucked."
Eventually, the tension
became so high that people
"hyperventilated, people
were wretching, not just
black students by any
means (and) men and

women both," Wiesen said.
Junior Jim Spencer, a resident of Naran
jaa, concurred and said that "everyone fled
the room, guys and girls."
"It was really one of the most distressing
things I've seen in the time I've been at
Stanford," said Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs. Robinson was
called to Ujamaa after the meeting broke

up to witness the effect of the
incidents on the students.
Robinson said Dugan and Heldt
will probably not be able to con
tinue living in their current resi
dences.
University Provost James
Rosse will begin an investigation
of the incidents today at 8:30 a.m.,
when he is scheduled to meet with
Ujamaa residence staff members.
"If the investigation establishes
the facts as they have been pre
sented to me, I could expect
charges would be brought under
the Fundamental Standard,"
Rosse said.
Both Dugan and Heldt have
been temporarily removed from
their Lagunita housing.
According to the residence staff
at Ujamaa, the two incidents were
part of a chain of events that
stretched over two weeks:
• The first racial act may have
been motivated by a discussion
Sept. 29 among several Lagunita

East residents, including Dugan,
Heldt and B.J. Kerr, on whose
door the flier was found. Their
conversation about the contribu
tions of African Americans to
American music led to a heated
debate about the possibility of
Beethoven being of African des
cent.
• Around 2 a.m. on Oct. 1, a
residence staff member found the
defaced Beethoven flier on a black
board next to the door of Ujamaa
sophomore Kerr, who had partic
ipated in the discussion. The pic
ture of Beethoven "was colored
brown, given wild curly hair, big
lips and red eyes," according to a
statement released by the resi
dence staff to The Daily. The flier
was taken down by the residence
staff, who still have it.
Kerr was not available for com
ment last night.
The Ujamaa residence staff did
not notify residents about the flier
"because we wanted to figure out
the full circumstances behind it,"
without alarming anyone, accord
ing to Maurice Rabb, head aca
demic adviser at Ujamaa.
At this point, the staff began

its own investigation.
•On Oct. 14, around 2 or 3
a.m., a large poster was discovered
on the second floor of Ujamaa
with the word "Niggers" written
across the front. The poster ad
vertised a party sponsored by the
UC-Berkeley chapter of the black
fraternity Kappa Alpha Psi. Kerr
and another resident found the
poster and the members of the
residence staff removed it imme
diately.
• Later that evening, the resi
dence staff called an emergency
meeting with the entire dorm to
inform them of the incidents and
to discuss their effects. The entire
situation "erupted" at that point,
according to Rabb.
Wiesen said a "tone of shock"
hung over the discussion and
"concern was aired by both black
and white students."
Although Dugan, an Ujamaa
resident, was present at the meet
ing, he did not confess his role in
the first incident "because he
wanted to wait until people cooled
down," according to Coleman.
• During the meeting, one
Ujamaa resident privately told a
member of the residence staff that
she recalled overhearing a conver
sation planning the alteration of
the Beethoven flier.
• After the resident said the per
son spoke with an English accent,
Ujamaa staff decided to confront
Naranja House resident Heldt
about the incident. Heldt admitted
that he and Dugan had defaced
the flier.
• Over the course of the eve
ning, Ujamaa and Naranja resi
dence staff spoke with Dugan and
Heldt individually, and then to
gether. The two apologized for
their action and agreed to address
Ujamaa residents at another
"emergency" meeting yesterday at
noon.
• Both Ujamaa and Naranja
residents attended yesterday's
meeting, along with Residential
Dean for the West Campus Ron
Hudson. According to members of
the residence staff, Dugan and
Heldt admitted to defacing the
Beethoven flier, apologized and at
tempted to explain their actions.
However, most residents were
not convinced of the students' sin
cerity, according to Wiesen.
Wiesen quoted the two as saying,
at one point, "one, two, three,
We're sorry." Describing their at
titude as "very arrogant," Wiesen
and others said neither could un
derstand the intensity of the re
action to the events.
Both Dugan and Heldt said they
were "drunk and stoned" when

they defaced the flier, but said
this was not an excuse for their
actions, according to members of
the residence staff. Spencer and
Gottesman concurred that Dugan
and Heldt confessed to being
drunk.
In an increasingly charged at
mosphere, Kerr rose to his feet
to say he felt betrayed by Dugan
and Heldt, with whom he had
sometimes conversed, Coleman
said. After Kerr found the flier,
he and Dugan reportedly main
tained contact before Dugan ad
mitted to having posted it.
When Kerr was speaking, Cole
man said that, at one point,
Dugan and Heldt seemed to shrug
off his comments. "Here he was
making this emotional plea, and
he didn't feel like they were lis
tening to him," she said.
In the early-morning statement,
Dugan states that he "was as
saulted by B.J. There was mini
mal contact."
"As soon as he raised his fist,
I fell flat on the ground." Dugan
said.
Spencer said that Kerr got vi
olent and tried to attack either
Dugan or Heldt. At least five res
idents were needed to restrain
Kerr, he added.
Although members of the resi
dence staff denied that there was
any physical conflict during the
meeting, they said they felt it nec
essary to remove Dugan and
Heldt from the meeting as it
