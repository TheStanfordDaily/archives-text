Residents of Ujamaa House were left
shocked and traumatized this weekend
after two white Lagunita residents admit
ted to posting a racially offensive flier on
the door of a black Ujamaa resident.

The admission followed
on the heels of two weeks
of increasing concern that
began Oct. 1 with the dis
covery of the offensive flier
which depicted a crude
caricature of Beethoven as
a black man. It intensified
Oct. 14 after a large poster
was discovered in Ujamaa
with the word "Niggers"

scrawled in capitals across its face.
Freshmen Ben Dugan and Gus Heldt
admitted to posting the Beethoven flier but
denied responsibility for the second inci
dent. Currently, there are no suspects in
that incident.
An "emergency" meeting was held yes
terday in Ujamaa where the two men
delivered an apology to residents for their
actions.
In a joint statement released early this

morning, Dugan and Heldt said, "At the
meeting, we apologized for our actions. We
both admitted to the Beethoven flier. We
denied doing the second poster."
"There was hysteria" at the meeting,
said Ujamaa resident assistant Kim Cole
man. Rachel Wiesen, also an RA at Ujamaa,
said the apology seemed insincere and "per
functory."

Ujamaa resident Gregg
Gottesman said, "People
started getting pissed be
cause the apology really
sucked."
Eventually, the tension
became so high that people
"hyperventilated, people
were wretching, not just
black students by any
means (and) men and

women both," Wiesen said.
Junior Jim Spencer, a resident of Naran
jaa, concurred and said that "everyone fled
the room, guys and girls."
"It was really one of the most distressing
things I've seen in the time I've been at
Stanford," said Norm Robinson, associate
dean of Student Affairs. Robinson was
called to Ujamaa after the meeting broke
