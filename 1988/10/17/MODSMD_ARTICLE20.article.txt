## Dean Lyons places union negotiations in context 
### 
THE NEGOTIATIONS between
the University and the United
Stanford Workers are nearing a
critical stage. I write because of this
and because it is a process that can
affect students. What follows is a
context that may help us understand
what is going on.
Labor negotiations are a normal and
legitimate process
Labor negotiations - also known as
collective bargaining - are part of a
legitimate process that occurs on a
regular cycle. There have been five
successful negotiations between the
University and the USW in the past.
As before, a bargaining team repre
senting USW, which is Local No. 680
of the Service Employees International
Union, is negotiating on behalf of
service, maintenance and technical
employees at Stanford. Another bar
gaining team represents the interests of
many parts of the University: schools,
departments, labs, food services, plant
services and other parts of the Univer
sity where union employees work. This
team represents the management of the
University.
What's at stake is the contract be
tween the University and the union
that specifies wages, hours, and work
ing conditions. By law, all negotiations
that count must occur at the bargain
ing table between members of the two
official bargaining teams.
The members of a union expect their
leaders to get them the best deal
possible. That is understood in collec
tive bargaining - and care should be
taken not to assume that a union's
leaders and members are greedy just
because they ask for a lot. Union
leaders need not balance or otherwise
be sensitive to competing University
priorities. Their single goal is to
achieve the best deal they can make
for their members.
In the economics of a university, this

is actually a zero sum game; the
benefits of one group always affect
those of others. Higher wages, for
instance, may mean higher tuition and
fees. These are matters which the
University bargaining team takes into
account on their side of the negotiating
table; their job is to achieve the
balances that are fair and reasonable
for the whole University.
The campaign for student support (or
at least neutrality)
Sometimes negotiations are moved
along by the threat of a strike. If
negotiations fail, a strike may result.
If that should happen, history tells
us that students will be greatly incon
venienced. Their patience, or lack of it,
coupled with a need to assign blame

for who is most responsible for negoti
ations breaking down is one reason
why the USW leadership has histori
cally sought the support and under
standing of students.
I cannot recall when the University
negotiating team has ever asked stu
dents to choose sides. On the other
hand, when one understands the dy
namics of a strike, one can also under
stand why the University bargaining
team would undoubtedly prefer that
students remain neutral.
The dynamics of a strike
The ultimate power of a union is the
strike; witholding the services of its
members. Therein lies a problem for
the campus community. Strikes are
designed to create inconvenience,

hardship, and disruption as a means to
coerce the employer to yield to the
union's demands. Strikes are lawful
and as old as the hills.
The strike is also a very high risk
tactic. If a union's leaders call a strike,
they are gambling that the overwhelm
ing majority of their members will
support it. If they are wrong, the
members will drift back to work. After
all, when members withold their labor
they also lose their wages.
Both unions and management risk
backlash from those who are incon
venienced by a strike. In a university,
that may take the form of the ire of
students, faculty and staff who have to
try to fill the voids. For some, it may
mean having their academic and other
routines altered or cut back.
Thus, it should not be surprising
that a union will seek public support
and tolerance for its causes. Without
that the strike cannot work well.
Management, for its part, may make
similar appeals.
While not wishing to paint too bleak
a picture, it is important for all of us
to realize that things simply cannot be
normal if a strike occurs. Strikes are
designed to disrupt business-as-usual,
and usually do.
All negotiations eventually end!
Negotiations end. Strikes end. When
they do, USW members and others will
be working together again.
The process of labor negotiations are
designed to raise and resolve differ
ences among friends - not between
enemies. Therefore, understand that it
is a situation in legally and politically
circumscribed roles. We need to keep
that in mind and avoid allowing our
selves to be drawn into situations that
will create irreparable differences that
make working together after the fact
difficult or impossible.

THE NEGOTIATIONS between
the University and the United
Stanford Workers are nearing a
critical stage. I write because of this
and because it is a process that can
affect students. What follows is a
context that may help us understand
what is going on.
Labor negotiations are a normal and
legitimate process
Labor negotiations - also known as
collective bargaining - are part of a
legitimate process that occurs on a
regular cycle. There have been five
successful negotiations between the
University and the USW in the past.
As before, a bargaining team repre
senting USW, which is Local No. 680
of the Service Employees International
Union, is negotiating on behalf of
service, maintenance and technical
employees at Stanford. Another bar
gaining team represents the interests of
many parts of the University: schools,
departments, labs, food services, plant
services and other parts of the Univer
sity where union employees work. This
team represents the management of the
University.
What's at stake is the contract be
tween the University and the union
that specifies wages, hours, and work
ing conditions. By law, all negotiations
that count must occur at the bargain
ing table between members of the two
official bargaining teams.
The members of a union expect their
leaders to get them the best deal
possible. That is understood in collec
tive bargaining - and care should be
taken not to assume that a union's
leaders and members are greedy just
because they ask for a lot. Union
leaders need not balance or otherwise
be sensitive to competing University
priorities. Their single goal is to
achieve the best deal they can make
for their members.
In the economics of a university, this

is actually a zero sum game; the
benefits of one group always affect
those of others. Higher wages, for
instance, may mean higher tuition and
fees. These are matters which the
University bargaining team takes into
account on their side of the negotiating
table; their job is to achieve the
balances that are fair and reasonable
for the whole University.
The campaign for student support (or
at least neutrality)
Sometimes negotiations are moved
along by the threat of a strike. If
negotiations fail, a strike may result.
If that should happen, history tells
us that students will be greatly incon
venienced. Their patience, or lack of it,
coupled with a need to assign blame

for who is most responsible for negoti
ations breaking down is one reason
why the USW leadership has histori
cally sought the support and under
standing of students.
I cannot recall when the University
negotiating team has ever asked stu
dents to choose sides. On the other
hand, when one understands the dy
namics of a strike, one can also under
stand why the University bargaining
team would undoubtedly prefer that
students remain neutral.
The dynamics of a strike
The ultimate power of a union is the
strike; witholding the services of its
members. Therein lies a problem for
the campus community. Strikes are
designed to create inconvenience,

hardship, and disruption as a means to
coerce the employer to yield to the
union's demands. Strikes are lawful
and as old as the hills.
The strike is also a very high risk
tactic. If a union's leaders call a strike,
they are gambling that the overwhelm
ing majority of their members will
support it. If they are wrong, the
members will drift back to work. After
all, when members withold their labor
they also lose their wages.
Both unions and management risk
backlash from those who are incon
venienced by a strike. In a university,
that may take the form of the ire of
students, faculty and staff who have to
try to fill the voids. For some, it may
mean having their academic and other
routines altered or cut back.
Thus, it should not be surprising
that a union will seek public support
and tolerance for its causes. Without
that the strike cannot work well.
Management, for its part, may make
similar appeals.
While not wishing to paint too bleak
a picture, it is important for all of us
to realize that things simply cannot be
normal if a strike occurs. Strikes are
designed to disrupt business-as-usual,
and usually do.
All negotiations eventually end!
Negotiations end. Strikes end. When
they do, USW members and others will
be working together again.
The process of labor negotiations are
designed to raise and resolve differ
ences among friends - not between
enemies. Therefore, understand that it
is a situation in legally and politically

selves to be drawn into situations that
will create irreparable differences that
