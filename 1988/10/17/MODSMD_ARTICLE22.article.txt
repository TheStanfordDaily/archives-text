## Blacks in Ujamaa should be able to determine who lives there 
### 
Along with many others, I am
thoroughly sickened by the two racist
scrawlings that appeared recently on
the walls of Ujamaa House. It is par
ticularly offensive, too, that we are all
most likely living with a resident, or
residents, who are responsible for
these.
This is, of course, my own very emo
tional opinion, but I feel that if
bigotry is truly "out" then we should
see the person responsible for this out
— not just out of Ujamaa, but out of
the University. Or is the Fundamental
Standard totally meaningless?
I am a sophomore living in Ujamaa.
1 am white and I chose to live here
because this is an opportunity for me
to live with black people and to learn
about black culture and American his
tory that I have never had anywhere
else.
This is the second time I have lived
in a theme dorm, and I have learned
as much that is valuable from living in
Okada House and Ujamaa as I have in
my classes at Stanford. I would ven
ture to say that my education here
would have been worth substantially
less to me if I had not had the oppor
tunity to live in these dorms.
That is why I am so upset by the

If bigotry is truly 'out'
then we should see the
person responsible for

negative impressions and, in some
cases, racist reactions to Ujamaa exhib
ited by people on this campus, most of
whom have never lived in, spent time
in, or even visited a theme house.
I love living here. Ujamaa has a very
open and friendly atmosphere. The
message here is unity and it shows in
the efforts of the staff and residents.
But people outside get a funny look on
their faces when I tell them where I
live. This makes me very upset, and
also a little defensive.
I would like to suggest that people
who have not spent time in Ujamaa
should not feel free to criticize some
thing they know nothing about. If you
think it is necessarily uncomfortable
for a white person to live in Ujamaa,
you are wrong.
And if there are non-blacks, inside
or outside Ujamaa, who feel threatened

or alienated by a dorm whose focus is
black culture and black history, includ
ing the history and the presence of
racism and discrimination in our coun
try, then it is not the dorm, or the
residents of Ujamaa whom they should
call into question, but their own
feelings.
There are a number of people in the
black community who are fed up with
this kind of incident and would like for
Ujamaa to be an all-black residence.
And although it is a good learning
experience for me and for other whites
to live here, I sympathize with what
they are saying.
Ujamaa was fought for and won by
the black community not so that they
could better shoulder the responsibility
of educating the entire white communi
ty, but to have a place to come to
gether after spending most of their
time in a predominantly white, unsup
portive, often racist and antagonistic
environment, to learn about and cele
brate black history, power and
creativity. (Sound inspiring? It really
is.)
Why should the black people who
live here have to spend time in their
own home dealing with the same racist
insults that they are faced with else-

... people get a funny
look on their faces

I live.

where?
Racial tensions that do occur in
Ujamaa are due to the fact that there
are people here, some of them obvi
ously extremely racist, who don't want
to live here or to participate in the
theme. They should not be here, espe
cially when there are black students
who want to live in Ujamaa but cannot
because of the required black to non
black ratio.
And though I feel for white fresh
men here who say, "I like it here. I
didn't choose to live here, but I am
learning a lot. Other white students
should have this opportunity, too," I
think that as white students who sup
port what Ujamaa is all about, we
should encourage Stanford to respect
the right of the black community to
decide for themselves who may live
here.

As a final note, I would like to cau
tion people who would dismiss this as
a trivial incident by one or two racist
students. Considered in the context of
other incidents that have occured in
the past year, I think it is extremely
important that President Kennedy and
Residential Education respond firmly in
support of Ujamaa.

Along with many others, I am
thoroughly sickened by the two racist
scrawlings that appeared recently on
the walls of Ujamaa House. It is par
ticularly offensive, too, that we are all
most likely living with a resident, or
residents, who are responsible for
these.
This is, of course, my own very emo
tional opinion, but I feel that if
bigotry is truly "out" then we should
see the person responsible for this out
— not just out of Ujamaa, but out of
the University. Or is the Fundamental
Standard totally meaningless?
I am a sophomore living in Ujamaa.
1 am white and I chose to live here
because this is an opportunity for me
to live with black people and to learn
about black culture and American his
tory that I have never had anywhere
else.
This is the second time I have lived
in a theme dorm, and I have learned
as much that is valuable from living in
Okada House and Ujamaa as I have in
my classes at Stanford. I would ven
ture to say that my education here
would have been worth substantially
less to me if I had not had the oppor
tunity to live in these dorms.
That is why I am so upset by the

negative impressions and, in some
cases, racist reactions to Ujamaa exhib
ited by people on this campus, most of
whom have never lived in, spent time
in, or even visited a theme house.
I love living here. Ujamaa has a very
open and friendly atmosphere. The
message here is unity and it shows in
the efforts of the staff and residents.
But people outside get a funny look on
their faces when I tell them where I
live. This makes me very upset, and
also a little defensive.
I would like to suggest that people
who have not spent time in Ujamaa
should not feel free to criticize some
thing they know nothing about. If you
think it is necessarily uncomfortable
for a white person to live in Ujamaa,
you are wrong.
And if there are non-blacks, inside
or outside Ujamaa, who feel threatened

or alienated by a dorm whose focus is
black culture and black history, includ
ing the history and the presence of
racism and discrimination in our coun
try, then it is not the dorm, or the
residents of Ujamaa whom they should
call into question, but their own
feelings.
There are a number of people in the
black community who are fed up with
this kind of incident and would like for
Ujamaa to be an all-black residence.
And although it is a good learning
experience for me and for other whites
to live here, I sympathize with what
they are saying.
Ujamaa was fought for and won by
the black community not so that they
could better shoulder the responsibility
of educating the entire white communi
ty, but to have a place to come to
gether after spending most of their
time in a predominantly white, unsup
portive, often racist and antagonistic
environment, to learn about and cele
brate black history, power and
creativity. (Sound inspiring? It really
is.)
Why should the black people who
live here have to spend time in their
own home dealing with the same racist
insults that they are faced with else-

where?
Racial tensions that do occur in
Ujamaa are due to the fact that there
are people here, some of them obvi
ously extremely racist, who don't want
to live here or to participate in the
theme. They should not be here, espe
cially when there are black students
who want to live in Ujamaa but cannot
because of the required black to non
black ratio.
And though I feel for white fresh
men here who say, "I like it here. I
didn't choose to live here, but I am
learning a lot. Other white students
should have this opportunity, too," I
think that as white students who sup
port what Ujamaa is all about, we
should encourage Stanford to respect
the right of the black community to
decide for themselves who may live
here.

As a final note, I would like to cau
tion people who would dismiss this as
a trivial incident by one or two racist
students. Considered in the context of
other incidents that have occured in
the past year, I think it is extremely
important that President Kennedy and
Residential Education respond firmly in
support of Ujamaa.
