## Student author heats up presses with 'Pseudo-cool' novel 
### Aileen Resnick 
Pseudo-sexual mix-ups, pseudo-
Western Culture requirements
and pseudo-Stanford allusions
combined this summer to become
"Pseudo-Cool," the brainchild of
senior Joseph Green.
The novel, about five black stu
dents attending an elitist, predom
inantly white, West Coast

university, is scheduled for release
this December.
When Green began writing his
novel "Pseudo-Cool," he didn't
really expect it to be published.
He sent copies of his manuscript,
which took four weeks to write,
to only two publishers before it
was accepted by the Holloway
House Publishing Company in
Los Angeles.
Green, a Communication mtyor,
is taking his success in stride. "I
don't want to get too stressed-out
about this first experience," he
says.
"What is amazing is how easily
it happened when it's usually so
hard. And I know how hard it can
be, because I've been rejected by
publishers and agents over 20
times."
Green has been interested in
creative writing since his senior
year in high school. Before writing
"Pseudo-Cpol," he wrote a novel
titled "Ice," which was rejected
by publishers. Green admits that
"Ice" was not as serious an effort
as was "Pseudo-Cool."
"With my first novel," Green
says,"I was concerned with what
my friends would think, with

what my parents would think .. .
but with this second novel I just
got totally involved with the story.
I didn't think about anything
else."
Stressing that he "wanted to
write a book to entertain people,"
Green denies that the main events
and characters in "Pseudo-Cool"
are based directly on incidents or
people at Stanford.
"I didn't take a true-life exper
ience and then fictionalize it,"he
says. One incident in the book,
however, involves a fictional black
student union's attempt to change
a course requirement similar to
last year's Western Culture
debate.
"It was easy for me to be very
creative. The book is too wild to
have any basis in real life," he
explains.
For instance, one of the char
acters in "Pseudo-Cool" is a stu
dent who turns to prostitution to
earn her tuition money; and an
other is a female student who be
comes sexually involved with a
male homosexual.
"If it was autobiographical, I
would be extremely worried"
about the conclusions friends and

relatives might draw, Green says.
Green says he hopes the publi
cation of his novel will provide
inspiration for other young black
writers seeking to enter a predom
inantly white profession.
"As a minority trying to get
into an industry run by people
with extremely different back
grounds than what I'm familiar
with, I think I'm really fortunate
to have broken in."
He notes that most contempo
rary books written for and about
college students (such as "Less
Than Zero" and "Bright Lights,
Big City") are geared toward
whites.
"I wanted to write a book about
black students that would allow
black students to pick up the book
and see something of themselves
in it," Green says. "If you read it
and you are black, you can iden
tify" with many of the issues in
the novel, he adds.
Green expects the novel to be
released next summer. Typically,
the actual publication of a novel
takes nine to 12 months after the
initial agreement. Nevertheless,
even after several set-backs with

the publication dates, the release
is scheduled much earlier than
Green anticipated.
Green remains unworried about
the way it will be received by the
Stanford community once it is re
leased. "I don't know if people
will like it, but I know it will be
a page-turner," Green says. "It's
the kind of book I like to read."

'It was easy for me
to be very creative.
The book is too
wild to have any
basis in real life.'

Although his friends have not
yet read "Pseudo-Cool," Green is
not especially concerned about
their judgement. His harshest
critic has already given it her ap
proval.
"The most difficult time was
having my mom read it, because

it's racy — it's not a tame, nice
little novel you want your little
sister or brother to read."
To help fund the writing of the
novel, Green applied last spring
for a Golden Grant, a cash award
given to students pursuing indi
vidual academic research. Al
though he did not receive the
Golden Grant, his proposal im
pressed Laura Selznick, director
of Undergraduate Research Op
portunites. Selznick recom
mended him for the smaller
Camron Cooper Grant.
"Green had good recommenda
tions from sponsors as to his writ
ing ... it merited encouragement,
and the small grant was able to
provide encouragement and sup
port," Selznick says.
Green agrees that the writing
of "Pseudo-Cool" may not have
been possible without the help of
Selznick and Prof. John
L'Heureux of the Creative Writ
ing Department.
"Without Laura Selznick's help,
I don't think this book would have
gotten off the ground, and John


Joseph Green
L'Heureux has been very help
ful," says Green.
L'Heureux describes Green as
"an extremely ambitious person
who doesn't just talk about writ
ing — he sits down and writes."
Green plans to continue writing
and is in the process of writing
his next novel. If his success as
a writer slows down, Green says
he may pursue a career in the
publishing business.
"I like working with words,"
Green says."I like entertaining
people, and I do that best through
writing."
Green views "Pseudo-Cool" as
a "stepping stone" to his career.
He is both surprised and pleased
about his sudden success: "It's
nice to be able to say, 'I am a
writer, and yes, I am published."'
