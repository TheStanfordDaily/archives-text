The following is an analysis of
the current state of President and
General Secretary Mikhail Gorba
chev's social and structural re
forms from the perspective of a
student of Soviet affairs.
By James Chavin
Beginning in the late 19705,
Sovietologists increasingly found

themselves speculating about
which member of the ossified
Politburo would be the next to
fall off the balcony of Lenin's
Mausoleum. Under the gaze of
successive elderly administra
tions, the performance of the So
viet economy gave new meaning
to the old Russian proverb — that
which does not grow, dies.
In the words of Boris, a 19-
year-old truck driver and black
marketeer, "We are able to joke
about America looking into the
abyss, because we are already
there." General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev is attempting to
reverse these years of economic
stagnation with deep reform of

the Soviet socialist system.
Yet the problems that Gorba
chev faces are so inextricably
linked with the social and political
history of the Soviet Union that
the reverberations of his efforts
at economic reform are being felt
by Soviet citizens in all spheres
of life, from priest to journalist
to politician. But just as it is im
portant to understand the extent
of Gorbachev's second revolution,
it is also important to bear in
mind its limits.
New risks and rewards
Gorbachev is not interested in
building capitalism; he claims to
be a disciple of socialism and an
executor of Leninism.

The essence of Gorbachev's eco
nomic reforms is to link the salary
a person receives more directly to
the work the person does, thereby
increasing the incentive to be pro
ductive and efficient. At the be
ginning of 1986, the government
introduced new regulations
making two-thirds of Soviet fac
tories self-financing; the remain
ing one-third will become
self-financing in 1989.
