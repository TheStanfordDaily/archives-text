Editor's note: James Chavin is

•Soviet Union, studying Russian
at Leningrad State University.
While there, he observed the po
litical, social, and economic trends
find changes evident in everyday
Soviet life.
The following is an analysis of
the current state of President and
General Secretary Mikhail Gorba
chev's social and structural re
forms from the perspective of a
student of Soviet affairs.
By James Chavin
Beginning in the late 19705,
Sovietologists increasingly found

themselves speculating about
which member of the ossified
Politburo would be the next to
fall off the balcony of Lenin's
Mausoleum. Under the gaze of
successive elderly administra
tions, the performance of the So
viet economy gave new meaning
to the old Russian proverb — that
which does not grow, dies.
In the words of Boris, a 19-
year-old truck driver and black
marketeer, "We are able to joke
about America looking into the
abyss, because we are already
there." General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev is attempting to
reverse these years of economic
stagnation with deep reform of

the Soviet socialist system.
Yet the problems that Gorba
chev faces are so inextricably
linked with the social and political
history of the Soviet Union that
the reverberations of his efforts
at economic reform are being felt
by Soviet citizens in all spheres
of life, from priest to journalist
to politician. But just as it is im
portant to understand the extent
of Gorbachev's second revolution,
it is also important to bear in
mind its limits.
New risks and rewards
Gorbachev is not interested in
building capitalism; he claims to
be a disciple of socialism and an
executor of Leninism.

The essence of Gorbachev's eco
nomic reforms is to link the salary
a person receives more directly to
the work the person does, thereby
increasing the incentive to be pro
ductive and efficient. At the be
ginning of 1986, the government
introduced new regulations
making two-thirds of Soviet fac
tories self-financing; the remain
ing one-third will become
self-financing in 1989.
A manager of a cotton factory
in Kallinin, a city outside of Mos
cow, told a group of students that
if her factory does not start to
turn a profit within two years,

she risks financial penalties or
even unemployment.
"It is very difficult, but also
very exciting," she said about the
new expectations and responsibil
ity.
The right to work
Gorbachev has also proposed
graded pay scales to better reward
the talented and skilled worker.
But he has thus far hesitated to
allow the firing of the incompetent
or economically superfluous.
The right and duty to work fig
ures significantly in the Soviet
socialist ideology. Gorbachev has
continued to reassure workers
that he will not encroach upon
this right. Nevertheless, his prom
ise of greater authority to factory
managers in order to streamline
their operations has not been
reconciled with the entrenched So
viet tenet of guaranteed work for
all.
"We pretend to work, and the
government pretends to pay us,"
said one Soviet acquaintance this
summer.
A crisis for cabbage
Gorbachev's reforms of Soviet
agriculture should yield results
more quickly than his industrial

reforms. Estimates predict
agricultural production, the other
main pillar of the Soviet economy,
to improve or at least respond to
Gorbachev's cultivation, within
two to three years.
Aside from attempting bureau
cratic reform, he is gradually
making farms self-financing and
relaxing the stringent planned
delivery quotas, hoping that
private, free-market agricultural
production will expand and offset
shortfalls in state deliveries.
Gorbachev is probably on the
right track. Regularly, only car
rots and cabbage could be found
filling the bins of the government
run fruit and vegetable kiosks in
Leningrad this summer, and these
could be bought only when, or if,
the cashier returned from the typ
ical unpredictably long lunch
break.
In sharp contrast, the expen
sive, crowded private produce
markets overflowed with goods,
attracting the bulk of Leningrad's
shoppers. Most are willing to pay
the much more expensive prices
in exchange for the higher quality
and wide selection offered by in
dividual growers in the four large
indoor-outdoor markets in the
city.
Stocking the shelves
Gorbachev is well aware that
his attempts to reinvigorate the
Soviet economy depend upon

more than new laws and bureau
cratic reshuffling. The poet Yev
geny Yevtushenko has remarked,
"There can be no restructuring
with minds unstructured."
Gorbachev must somehow en
courage Soviet citizens to work
harder and more efficiently. This
depends on increasing the quality
and availability of manufactured
goods available for consumption,
so that workers have an incentive
to work harder and more effi
ciently to earn spending money.
Yet it will be several years at least
until restructuring, perestroika,
yields increases in manufacturing
and consumer goods.
Until then, the draconian na
ture of Gorbachev's cure, purging
inefficient operations, combined
with the inertial deceleration of
the Soviet economy, will probably
cause further drops in industrial
production. Moreover, the delayed
effects could decrease work incen
tive for Soviet citizens because
during the drawn-out transition
to perestroika's reformed system
there will be even less to buy.
Ultimately, Gorbachev's future
depends on perestroika shortening
lines and raising the quality and
quantity of goods. In the interim,
before perestroika becomes self
justifying, Gorbachev must find
other ways of rallying support for
himself and his program of
reform.

Tempting with religion
This desire to give as many So
viet citizens as possible a personal
stake in the success of perestroika
explains his new policies toward
religion, his campaign for democ
ratization and the elusive phe
nomenon of glastnost, or open
ness.
Since Gorbachev came to power,
the Soviet press has adopted a
more tolerant line towards the
Russian Orthodox Church. While
in Vladimir, a city not far from
Moscow, U.S. students were able
to attend services in newly
restored and refurbished
churches.
But aside from an easing of
anti-religious propaganda, conces
sions to the church have been
largely symbolic. Releasing a few
religious dissidents has been a
cheap gesture, as has reconverting
several museums of atheism and
religion back to monasteries.
Similarly, allowing the printing of
a limited number of Bibles to cel
ebrate the millenium and
sanctioning the canonization of a
few well-known figures from the
past, long-dead and therefore not
politically sensitive, can be dis
missed as superficial concessions
to Russian nationalism and patri
otism.
Soviet refusal to grant formal
recognition to the Ukrainian Or
thodox Church, on the other hand,

suggests that there are definite if
not defined limits to the new
found freedom of churches. Gor
bachev wants to mobilize the
support of the faithful, but not
at the cost of creating a politically
independent and powerful church.
Needs before ideology
Gorbachev is interested in the
political participation only of
those citizens who support his pro
gram of perestroika. This was well
demonstrated by his attempts to
prejudice the selection of
delegates for the June Party Con
ference, and his ongoing efforts
to purge the Politburo of conser
vative opposition.
Democracy still seems to be an
alien concept to all but the most
educated and intelligent of the So
viet population. To many, Gorba
chev's condemnation of Leonid
Brezhnev's stagnant regime of the
1960s and 1970s is simply the
most recently aired dogma. A
thoughtful friend, Yuri, suggested
that the Soviet people, if com
manded, will forget or remember
immediately anything Gorbachev
wants.
Only a cynic would decry Gor
bachev's revisionist rhetoric as
nothing more than surface
economic realignment and a sham
behind which he seeks to entrench
himself like Brezhnev or even
Stalin.
His future does depend upon

the success of the tremendously
difficult task of economic reform.
Therefore the immediate needs of
the population and state will con
tinue to subordinate his longer
term visions of achieving textbook
socialism or communism, and dic
tate his actions in the coming
years.
