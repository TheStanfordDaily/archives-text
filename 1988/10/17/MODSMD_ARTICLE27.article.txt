## Stanford bedevils Arizona State, 24-3 Five interceptions spark win 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
On a day when close games were
the norm, the Stanford football
team would have no part of it.
While the Notre Dame-Miami
and USC-Washington games were
both decided by last-minute, two
point conversion failures, Stan
ford dominated Arizona State at
Stanford Stadium Saturday, pos
ting a 24-3 drubbing.

* Cardinal 24, Sun Devils 3
; Stanford has now leveled its
record at 3-3, 1-2 in the Pacific
10 Conference. The Sun Devils
are also 3-3, 0-2 in the Pac-10.
Stanford Coach Jack Elway was
glad to see his troops post their
first league win. "That is nice, I
tell you," he said. "I didn't know
when that would happen."
The Cardinal, which lost each
of its other two Pac-10 games on
fourth-quarter touchdowns by
USC and Oregon, didn't give ASU
a chance for last-minute heroics.
The defense played perhaps its
best game of the season while the
offense moved the ball well when
ever it had too.
Inside linebacker Jono Tunney
was "definitely" satisfied with the
defense's effort but was hesitant
to call it the best of the year. "I'd
say Oregon was a pretty good ef
fort, too," he said. "[But] I
thought we were definitely play
ing good defense [Saturday]."
While Stanford gave up 339
yards of total offense, 144 of those
came in the fourth quarter when
the game was effectively over. The
Cardinal defense also came up
with five interceptions, including
two by Tunney, and is now giving
up only 16.3 points per game.
The reason for the defense's
success Saturday was a ferocious
pass rush. The Cardinal recorded

four sacks and had numerous ad
ditional hurries on Sun Devil
quarterbacks Daniel Ford and
Paul Justin. "[Stanford] put the
pressure on and [the defensive
backs] stayed disciplined within
the [defensive] package," Elway
said.
The game started rather poorly
for the home squad. After Stan
ford received the opening kickoff,
the team went eight yards back
wards in three plays then punted.
ASU took over on its own 29
and marched to Stanford's 32
where Alan Zendejas drilled a 49-
yard field goal. Little did the Sun
Devils know that would be the
only points they could celebrate
all day.
Stanford took the ensuing kick
off and marched 80 yards on 12
plays to take the lead. The drive
included 16- and 17-yard runs by
junior fullback Jon Volpe and cul
minated in a fourth-and-goal, one
yard off-tackle run by Volpe.
A few minutes later, the Jason
Palumbis-led Cardinal offense did
it again. Inside linebacker Kevin
Richardson's second interception
in two weeks gave Palumbis the
belli on the ASU 25. On second
down the redshirt freshman leapt
to throw over a big rush and hit
senior tight end Jim Price for 14
yards to the 11.
On the next play, everyone went
left, Palumbis rolled right and
found a diving Price on the goal
line to make it 14-3.
Palumbis completed 23 of 32
passes (an amazing 72 percent)
for 193 yards in his second col
legiate start. "He did great," El
way said of Palumbis. "I thought
he showed a lot of poise out
there."
When asked to exolain his suc
cess, Palumbis said, "One, they
didn't blitz as much [as San Jose
State]. Two, now I know what to
look for. ... I just think I made
less mistakes. . . . [But] I'm still
trying to get better."
A John Hopkins' field goal

made the score 17-3 at the half
and the Cardinal was sitting
pretty.
The Sun Devils only threatened
once in the second half, reaching
the Cardinal seven before strong
safety Rob Englehardt and out
side linebacker Rob Hinckley
sacked Justin for an 11-yard loss.
Zendejas then missed a 35-yard
field goal to end ASU's last
scoring opportunity.

The Cardinal offense responded
by marching 80 yards to put the
contest really out of reach. The
drive contained the play of the
day, a first-and-goal from the 10
in which Palumbis was under
heavy pressure. Palumbis man
aged to get rid of the ball, then
receiver Jon Pinckney came out
of nowhere to make a diving catch
just inside the sideline at the one
yard line. Palumbis then took it

in himself on a quarterback
sneak.
"I thought he was throwing it
away," Volpe said. "That was a
great play."
Stanford's defense then took
control, coming up with an inter
ception and stopping the Devils
twice on four downs to run out
the game.

Defensive tackle Scott Palmbush contributed to the Card's defensive domination in Saturday's victory
over the Sun Devils.
Hinckley analysed the defense's
performance. "We played well," he
said. "We knew what they were
going to do, we attacked them,
and they made mistakes.
Although noseguard Ray Huck
estein did not play a down for the
second consecutive week due to a
turf toe injury, the rest of the
defensive line took up the slack.
Tackle Scott Palmbush, who has
played somewhat in the shadow
of All-America candidates Huck
estein and Lester Archambeau
this year, was a force, recording
five tackles, including a quarter
back sack and an additional tackle
for loss.
"I thought we executed pretty
well," Palmbush said, "as good as
we have done so far. We were kind
of nervous because we didn't have
Ray. ... It was a real effort. We
wanted this game really bad. We
just knew we had to stop them."
Card notes
Volpe rushed for 99 yards on the
day, increasing his average to 95.7
yards per game. He had 102 yards
but lost three on his last carry of the
game.
The 23 Palumbis completions were
spread out among eight different
receivers.

Sophomore Walter Batson had four catches for 37 yards, as redshirt freshman Jason Palumbis threw
for 193 yards while completing 23 of 32 passes.
