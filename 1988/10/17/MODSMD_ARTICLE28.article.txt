# Orel's still amazing; Athletics flop

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Orel Hershiser did
everything for the Los Angeles Dodgers Sun
day and gave the Oakland Athletics nothing.
He held the Bash Bunch to three hits and
got three of his own as the Dodgers beat the
Athletics 6-0 and took a stunning 2-0 lead in
games as the World Series moves to Oakland.
It was anou.cr game, another shutout for
Hershiser, another Series victory for "des
tiny's Dodgers."
A day after Kirk Gibson became the
Dodgers' miracle man, Hershiser turned the
night into a one-man show. He did not allow
a runner past second base, made a fine fielding
play and became the first pitcher to get three
hits — including two doubles — in a World
Series game since 1924.
"I was extremely tired through most of the
night," said Hershiser, who pitched a five-hit
shutout Wednesday night as the Dodgers beat
the heavily favored New York Mets in the
Game 7 of the National League playoffs. "I
felt fine every time I was on the mound, but
I was tired from running the bases."
The Athletics got tired of seeing him, too.
"He's really tough," Oakland manager Tony
La Russa said. "He moves the ball around
well."
Even better than his parents, who threw
out the ceremonial first balls.
"I was just hoping for it not to break my
concentration," he said of the pregame
fesitivites. "But then I said, 'Forget it, this
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.' So I went
out there and shook my father's hand."
Hershiser put the Dodgers into a position
that hardly anyone except themselves ex

pected. Of the 38 teams that won the first
two games in a World Series, 28 went on to
win the championship.
The Dodger Bulldog, who has worked almost
half his team's innings in the postseason, has
an 0.80 earned run average in the postseason
and has allowed just three earned runs in his
last 92 innings. He is scheduled to start Game
5 in Oakland on Thursday and said he could
come back on two days' rest for Game 7 if
necessary in Los Angeles on Sunday.
"There's a handful of players that, if there's
a league beyond the majors, they'd be in it.
I'm just glad he's on our side," said Dodger
right fielder Mike Marshall, who contributed
a three-run homer and a triple. "You can see
the confidence when we take the field and
No. 55 is out there."
The Dodgers again did everything right
against the heavily favored Athletics. This
time, Los Angeles didn't need Gibson, who
won Game 1 with a two-out, two-run homer
in the bottom of the ninth but did not play
Sunday because of hamstring and ligament
damage.
Gibson's status remained day-to-day going
into Game 3 Tuesday night in Oakland when
Bob Welch opposes Los Angeles' John Tudor.

The victory marked the 12th consecutive
game the home team has won in the World
Series. But the Dodgers didn't require the
home-field advantage; they had Hershiser.
Baseball's most dominant pitcher showed
baseball's winningest team something it
hadn't seen. Only Dave Parker could solve
Hershiser, getting three singles, but twice
Mark McGwire followed by grounding into
double plays, and Hershiser got even with
Parker by striking him out to end the game.
McGwire had one more chance, after
Parker's two-out single put runners on first
and second in the seventh.
I really beared down on him because he
with one swing could get them back in the
game," Hershiser said.
McGwire flied to right.
Hershiser struck out eight, including Car
ney Lansford, Dave Henderson and Jose Can
seco in the fourth, walked two and allowed
only three runners to get as far as second
base. He threw just 104 pitches, 20 in the
eighth inning, despite working on three days'
rest since shutting out the New York Mets
in Game i of the National League playoffs
by the same 6-0 score.
The Athletics, the second-highest scoring
team in the majors this year, saw their score
less inning streak reach 16V3 as they managed
to get just six balls out of the infield.
The 56,051 fans got louder throughout the
night and Hershiser gave them another reason
to cheer in the sixth. He doubled into the
left-field corner, although he wound up
stranded.
