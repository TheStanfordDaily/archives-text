# Participants in Otero vigil not charged with misconduct

The seven participants in last year's
Otero vigil will not be charged with mis
conduct under the Fundamental Stand
ard, a Judicial Affairs officer said
yesterday. Instead, a case study on the
incident will be developed and distributed
later this week.
The vigil was staged by seven members
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in the
early morning hours of May 24. Donning
masks and speaking in whispers, they
said they were protesting the eviction of
an Otero resident after the University
accused him of homophobic and belliger
ent actions in the dormitory.
In a three-page letter given to The
Daily late last week, Judicial Affairs Of
ficer Sally Cole stated that she's not sure
if the Otero vigil was in violation of the
Fundamental Standard.
Cole's decision was written in response

light vigil violated the
University's Fundamen
tal Standard.
She added in the letter,
"If there are strong ar
guments both for and
against the option of
charging the students
with Fundamental
Standard violations, then
we have, I believe, a cir-

cumstance that is best handled outside
of the judicial arena."
Electrical Engineering Prof. Anthony
Siegman was one faculty member who
contributed to last year's Student Affairs
report. He said Sunday that all the in
cidents at Otero "sounded as if they fell
within the First Amendment Freedom of
Speech Rights."
A Fundamental Standard violation is

often cause for suspension or, in rare
cases, expulsion from Stanford.
In the Oct. 12 letter Cole stated that
she "would like to develop a case study
based on the Otero incident and make it
available through Residential Education
to the staff in undergraduate residences."
Cole explained the purpose of her letter
was to "define the best way to respond"
to the incident. She said she rejected the
judicial process as the best approach be
cause "you get better educational mileage
when it is aired [outsidel of Judicial Af
fairs."
During a telephone interview Sunday,
she said the case study would be ready
later this week. It contains public docu
ments about the incident "that represent
a variety of viewpoints," she said.
Stanford Organization for Lesbian and
Gay Equality member Daniel Sternbergh
said, "Personally, I think she (Cole) is
right that the individuals did not violate
the Fundamental Standard."

The Fundamental Standard
Students are expected to show both within and without
the University such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others as is
demanded of good citizens. Failure to observe this will
be sufficient cause for removal from the University.

Sternbergh added, however, that the
"excuse of ignorance becomes old quickly.
"Some official mention that ignorance
cannot be an excuse and that it cannot
be allowed to remain (an excuse) would
certainly be in order."
Cole said the student, whose identity
was not disclosed, had a reasonable com
plaint. Her ensuing investigation over the
summer involved discussions with the
vigil participants and faculty members

and reading the Student AfTairs' Office
report of the incident.
Cole said the student's reaction to her
final decision was not one of surprise.
She then said, "The student realized that
this was a complex issue. .. . The student
was in clear support of education mate
rials" coming out of the incident.
Normally any proceedings involving
University Judicial AfTairs are not made
public until the final decision is reached.
