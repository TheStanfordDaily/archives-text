# Card defense 'just says no'
## 
### Mark Rogowsky Editorial staff 
There's a fine line between ag
gression and discipline, senior cor
nerback Alan Grant said after
Stanford's 24-3, five-interception
victory over Arizona State Satur
day. He added that right now
Stanford's defense is "toeing it
real well."
Real well, indeed.
The Cardinal allowed a mere
194 yards in the first three quar
ters to the Sun Devils before al
lowing ASU to tack on 145 yards
in the fourth quarter. By then, it
hardly mattered as the defense
was in a prevent situation to guar
antee it didn't give up a big play.
Instead, the defense made the
big plays all day long. They in
tercepted five passes, sacked ASU
quarterbacks four times — and
hurried them on several other oc
casions — and allowed only a 49-
yard field goal to Alan Zendejas.
That scintillating performace
was the second in a row for Stan
ford and Coach Jack Elway thinks
the unit could get even better. He
noted that the difference between
this year and last was the
maturity of the younger players
including cornerback Kevin Scott
and linebacker Chuck Robinson.
Last year, .. we just got the
foundation laid. [Now] we're just
going to get better.
"If we keep improving we can
win any football game we play,"
he added.
When asked who the leaders on
the defense were, Elway said
"(Lester) Archambeau rallies [the
defense] with his play and (Kevin)
Richardson is like a coach on the
field. We're more interested in
that kind of leadership."
And, it's a defense where excel-
lent play seems to inspire more
excellent play.
Alan Grant intecepts a pass.
Jono Tunney intercepts a pass.
Rick Theder intercepts a pass.
Someone from the Class of *43
intercepts a pass. You get the idea.
Tunney said, the defense "is
playing as a real team, playing
together," adding that getting
good pressure on ASU's quarter
backs, Dan Ford and Paul Justin
was key to Saturday's win.
Ford was telegraphing his
passes as well, Tunney added. One
of his pickoffs "wasn't even in my
zone," he said.
Rob Hinckley agreed that the
pass rush was important. "We
forced him to make a decision
before he wanted to," he said. "A
couple of times we got [Ford's]
arm and there wasn't much he
could do."
"We scouted them well,"
Hinckley added.
Grant also suggested that the
team's preparation was excellent.
"Practice is a chance to get ac
quainted," with the opposition's
offensive schemes. "We're getting
a lot done. [There's] not a whole
lot of rah, rah."
"I've really admire the way
we've practiced the past two

weeks," Elway said.
He pointed out that winning
helps to breed winning. "It was
a Int. more fun practicing this
week after a win," he said.
Stanford's defense benefited
from an aggressive blitzing style
that complements the explosive
run-and-shoot offense.
"I like it," Hinckley said about
his role in the blitz. "If it works
I like it."

'If we keep improv
ing we can win any
football game we
play.'
— Jack Elway

Hinckley said the team had
some sort of blitz on 30 to 40
percent of the time. "It makes
their offensive line more tentative.
Blitzing makes them think."
If the Cardinal keeps making
them think on the offensive and
defensive ends of the field, there's
a good chance the team will con
tinue to toe that fine line Grant
alluded to.
And wins could become as con
tagious in the coming weeks as
interceptions were this past week.
