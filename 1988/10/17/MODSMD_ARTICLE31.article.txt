# Harriers vie with Cal
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
Today is payback time for
Stanford, as the Cardinal takes
on California at the Stanford
golf course. Last fall the men's
track team lost to the Bears
by a single point, but this time
the harriers are the over
whelming favorites to win this
four-mile grudge match at
home today at 11 a.m.
This weekend is the two
week mark before the Pacific
10 Conference Championships,
and the men's team is riding
a rising tide. Two weeks ago
at the Stanford Invitational, it
won decisively over a field that
included five Pac-10 rivals, in
cluding Cal and defending con
ference champion Arizona.
This race will likely deter
mine the top seven for the
Championship meet, and will
break up Stanford Coach Scott
Chisam's "One month of non
stop training."
The men will enter the race
with two goals. "Our main con
cern is to beat the Berkeley
team", according to senior cap
tain James Alborough. In ad
dition, Chisam says he is
"looking for a sixth man" to

augment a solid top five.
A mgyor coup for Chisam has
been the acquisition of North
western refugee Steve Miller.
Northwestern has traditionally
run with Stanford at the Meet
ing of the Minds race, but
slashed its running program
last year. Miller, a former Big
-10 Conference Champion, had
raced at Stanford and was fa
vorably impressed. With
Chisam's encouragement, he
applied and was accepted as an
academic junior.
In addition to Miller and
freshman Dave Scudamore, the
team has been aided by another
year of experience for last
year's returnees. "One of the
big differences is that we have
more experience this year", ac
cording to junior Mark Mas
talir. Mark and his twin
brother Eric have formed the
potent 'M&M twins' this year.
Alborough, the only senior on
this year's team, got high
marks from his teammates.
"James (Alborough) is one of
the few people who can train
consistently and then give 110
percent in races," according to
Mark Mastalir.
