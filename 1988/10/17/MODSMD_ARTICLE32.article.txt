# Stanford gets booted by Cal, 1-0

"Those who fail to learn from
history are doomed to repeat it."
The old proverb proved true and
condemned the Cardinal men's
soccer team yesterday, as a defen
sive slip let a bad goal in for the
second consecutive weekend and
Stanford succumbed to California,
1-0.
Men's Soccer
Golden Bears 1, Cardinal 0
History repeated itself in more
ways than one, as the booters lost
their third consecutive game this
year at Cal's Memorial Stadium.
In addition, it followed course in
that Stanford coach Sam Koch has
never beaten Cal on the road in
his five years here.
The Cardinal failed again to
string two wins together, some
thing it has not done since Sep
tember 14, and stands even on

the year at 8-8. California broke
a two-game losing streak to level
their own record at 5-5-2.
The game could be termed a
letdown after last Wednesday's
elevating win over national power
USF. But it didn't start out like
that. For the first 20 minutes of
the game, Stanford looked sharp.
Neither the Golden Bears, nor the
artificial turf and oppressive heat
seemed to be a match for the
fired-up Cardinal.
But then, disaster struck.
Senior midfielder Luke Garrott,
perhaps the team's best throw-in
man, tossed the ball back to
keeper Chris Helling. But it never
got there. In a mirror image of
what occurred on the same field
a week earlier, the one opposing
player marking Helling was able
to force an overthrow and then
avoid being tackled to score on
an undefended goal.
Sadly for the Cardinal, Noel
DeGuzman's goal at the 20:37
mark would be the only tally for
either side that day. Last week's
slip-up was only part of a bizzare

game that Stanford lost 5-2.
\ esterday, Stanford's defense
was characteristically tough, and
Helling made many fine saves.
But the Cardinal just couldn't
mount an effective threat, and lost
their sixth 1-0 game.
That left Garrott in a worse
position than Tim Keyes, last
week's throw-in offender. "It was
just bad judgment â€” I thought
the player was closer to me than
he really was," Garrott said.
Asked if it was a play the team
works on in practice, Garrott
responded, "Not really It's
something I do a lot in the games
.. perhaps we should have. There
never seemed to be a need."
The 1-0 defeat, and in particu
lar the way in happened, seemed
to deflate the Cardinal. The team
lost composure, and mentally was
never back in it."I think that
that one error really hurt us,"
senior forward Juan Garcia said.
"We played well the first 20
minutes, but after that mistake,
I think we had the mindset, 'Here
we go again,' " he added.
