# Volleyball wins big
## 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
Venturing north to Oregon this
weekend, the Stanford women's
volleyball team did what it has
yet to do since its entry into the
Pacific 10 Conference: sweep the
Oregon schools in straight games.
Reasserting the dominance dis
played in last weekend's upset of
Hawaii, the No. 2 Cardinal
pounded No. 20 Oregon 15-6, 15-
5, 15-3 Friday night and Oregon
State 15-9, 15-2, 15-4 to increase
its win streak to 11 straight
matches, just three short of the
school record.

Cardinal 3, Ducks 0

Stanford is now the proud pos
sessor of a 16-1 record and is 8-1
in Pac-10 play. Thanks to the
double defeat of Washington at
UCLA and USC, the Cardinal is
firmly locked in second place in
the conference, just one-half game
behind No. 1 Bruins and two
games ahead of the Trojans and
Huskies.
Though the Oregon schools,
holding the bottom two slots in
the league, did not provide the
intense and exciting competition
that the Huskies faced in Los An
geles, the wins were still signifi
cant for Stanford. Coming off
several tough weeks of challenging
opposition, the Cardinal success
fully avoided the threat of two
teams that always play well on
their home courts and have, since
the start of Pac-10 women's vol
leyball action, managed to strip
at least one game away from the
visiting Stanford squads.
From the opening moments in

the match Friday night against
Oregon, the Cardinal utterly over
powered the outmatched opposi
tion. "We played very well against
Oregon," Stanford Coach Don
Shaw said. "We came out ready
and just crushed them."
So thorough was the Ducks'
thrashing that they scored two
straight points only twice in the
entire match. Moreover, after
staking a 1-0 lead at the outset
of the first game, Oregon never
outscored Stanford.
Leading the Cardinal offensive
was freshman Kristin Klein, last
week's Pac-10 Player of the Week
and the team's leading hitter.
Klein tallied 17 kills against the
Ducks to lead both teams.
Junior setter Lara Asper and
senior middle blocker Laura
Olesen excelled as well. Asper re
corded 39 assists and two blocks,
while Olesen led the game with
three service aces and 10 digs.
Unfortunately for Oregon, the
Ducks did not match these
performances. The squad's star
spiker Michele Krebsbach was
held to a .000 hitting percentage,
placing the scoring burden on the
shoulders of a less-powerful
Melissa Terzian and freshman
Dawn Charroin.
"They're having problems be
cause their setter, Stephanie
Snyder, is hurt and didn't play,"
Shaw said. "Their other setters
are competent, but they don't
have the leadership ability that
Snyder brings to the team."
Leadership and experience
problems also plagued Stanford's
second opponent, Oregon State.
Finally up to 11 players after
starting the season with a sparse
seven, the Beavers have no core
of strong players anchoring the

team and no stars rising out of
the ranks.
On the other side of the net
Saturday night was Stanford, a
team embarrassed with riches.
Departing from the typical line-up
in order to rest a few starters and
give the reserves some playing
time, Shaw shuffled in everyone
on the active roster in the one

hour, 15 minute campaign.
Freshman middle blocker
Nicole Appleman made the most
of her opportunity, recording
seven kills and six blocks. "Nicole
played the entire match and gave
us a really nice performance,"
Shaw said. "She needed the game
time, and she's too good a player
to sit on the bench."
