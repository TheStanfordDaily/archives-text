# Hockey ties Chico State
## 
### Greg Gottesman 
In a perfect world, the team
with the most heart would always
win. The most courageous would
always triumph. The most dedi
cated would always score.
The Stanford field hockey team
learned Saturday afternoon that,
indeed, this is not a perfect world.
After leading 1-0 for almost the
entire game, Stanford ended up
tying league-leading Chico State
1-1.

Field Hockey

With the tie, the Wildcats,
which beat the Cardinal 1-0 ear
lier in the year, will remain atop
the NorPac Conference and
receive an invitation to the na
tional tournament. Stanford, how
ever, must do well in the
remainder of its games to salvage
any hope of participating in the
NCAA Regional Championships
on Nov. 12.
Stanford will travel east later
this week to take on field hockey
powerhouses such as Old
Dominion and North Carolina,
the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the
nation, respectively. If the 4-2-2
Cardinal beats either of these
teams, it could attain a national
ranking which would put the team
in good position to qualify for the
NCAA Championships.
Ironically, Saturday's game
against Chico State looked
promising at the outset. Senior
Dana Fleming put Stanford on
the board with a little over two
minutes to play in the first half
when she smashed a penalty
stroke into the back of the net.
The game stood at 1-0 for the
next 35 minutes of play.

Then disaster struck.
With just under three minutes
left in the contest, Chico State's
Tina Dufresne scored off a penalty
corner, knotting the game at 1-1.
Two overtimes and no goals later,
the contest was called.
"We played very hard today and
put out a lot of effort. To end up
tying . . . well, it's just hard to
say how that feels," lamented
Fleming.

'We have nothing to
lose now. We just
have to go back east,
play our best, and see
what happens.'

Coach Sheryl Johnson said, "It
was a good game. Everyone out
there was fighting hard .... To
be ranked in the top 12 and be
put in nationals, we just have to
go back east and beat either Old
Dominion or UNC."
Senior sweeper Wanda Kay Key
added, "We have nothing to lose
now. We just have to go back east,
play our best, and see what hap
pens."
After playing Temple Oct. 22,
North Carolina Oct. 24, Old
Dominion Oct. 25, and Virginia
Commonwealth Oct. 26, Stanford
comes home the 28th of the month
to take part in the Cal Invitation
al.
