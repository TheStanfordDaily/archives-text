# Card can't come up with conference win
## 
### Debbie Spander Staff writer 
Sometimes an early lead just isn't enough.
The Stanford water polo team could not
maintain its intensity against either UCLA or
California this weekend.
Water Polo
Bears 8, Cardinal 6
Bruins 8, Cardinal 5
After jumping out to '2-0 first-quarter leads
over both the No. 1 Bruins and the No. 2
Bears, the fourth-ranked Cardinal could not
maintain the early advantage, falling 8-6 to
Cal Sunday and 8-5 to its Southern California
foe Friday. The squad fell to 15-6 for the
season, 0-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The Cardinal almost pulled off an upset
over its cross-bay rival yesterday at deGuerre,
carrying a 6-4 lead into the fourth quarter.
But almost is not good enough when the op
ponent scores four goals in the final period.
Going into the third quarter Stanford was
on the short end of a 4-3 score to the hot
Golden Bears, who were fresh off an overtime
upset of UCLA. But unlike Friday's contest
against the Bruins, the Cardinal was able to

rebound after squandering its first-quarter
lead.
Jon Swerdloff opened the second half with
a six-on-five goal, his second tally of the game,
to even the score at four all. Left-hander
Andrew Lawson gave the reinvigorated squad
its second lead of the game with a cross cage
strike in the waning minutes of the quarter.
Holeman Erik Blum's backhand strike with
five minutes left in the match put Stanford
up 6-4, and looked to be a game winner. But
if Cal could not defeat the tenacious Cardinal,
penalties would.
In the next three minutes of play the Bears
received three man-up situations and a four
meter penalty shot, and scored on three of
the four opportunities.
"We got kicked out guarding the hole in
the fourth and they took advantage of it,"
Blum said. "The Bears got called for kick-outs
as well but we just couldn't score."
Although the Cardinal had two more pos
sessions in the final two minutes of play it
was unable to capitalize on any scoring op
portunities and Cal sealed its victory 8-6 as
the clock ticked out.
"We basically played well against Cal. We
played great defense, only allowing them two
natural goals, and came out strong for the

second time in a row. Maybe it's a mind set,"
Blum said.
Similar to its Sunday match, the Cardinal
shut out its opponent in the first quarter on
Friday, leading the Bruins 2-0. However, un
like its second home game of the weekend,
once Stanford fell behind during the second
period, it was unable to regain control of the
contest.
Entering the second period the Stanford six
were directing the tempo and shutting out
the top two players in the country, two-meter
man Alexis Rousseau and driver Fernando
Carsalade. But the home squad began letting
up mentally, and UCLA quickly turned the
game around.
"We talked about keeping mistakes to a
minimum — eliminating turnovers and
making good passes, but after the first quarter
we started commiting some errors and UCLA
capitalized," Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti said.
For the next 12 minutes of playing time
the Bruins shut out the host team while Car
silade and Rousseau combined for five strikes.
Lawson scored with two minutes left in the
third period to put Stanford temporarily back
in the contest. But once again Stanford let
up on defense and UCLA's Hank Peterson
scored twice in 15 seconds to open up the
final quarter.
