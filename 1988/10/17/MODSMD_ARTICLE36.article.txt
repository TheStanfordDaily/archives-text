# Soccer pulls out a nail-biter

### John Kirks Staff writer 
The Stanford women's soccer
team arrrived on San Francisco
State's campus Saturday riding
the crest of a five-game winning
streak and an 8-3-1 record.
The Cardinal took the field with
an air of absolute confidence: The
players' heads were held high, and
Stanford's brilliant cardinal and
white uniforms seemed to almost
shimmer in the warm San Fran
cisco sunshine.

Cardinal 1, Gators 0
The Cardinal ran through its
warm-ups appearing extremely
loose, as Coach Berhane Andeber
han displayed the youthful squad
that has recently shown itself to
be teeming with talent.
Shortly thereafter, though,
things got ugly. The field's
dilapidated condition soon became
readily apparent: It was pitted,
tattered and very damp in spots.
As if that was not unpleasant
enough, the SFSU Gators began
to employ rough-em-up tactics
right from the opening whistle.
Before Stanford's women knew
what had hit them, they were in
volved in a muddy, violent dog

fight. Stanford's resulting
casualty list included a possible
concussion (Christy McDevitt) as
well as numerous bumps and shin
bruises.
Many of the fans forgot they
were watching soccer amidst all
the blatant pushing and shoving;
nevertheless, there was a soccer
score to be settled. Luckily for
the Cardinal, Stanford's tactical
play and speed outlasted SFSU's
scrappy style, and the Cardinal
prevailed 1-0 on Lisa Sime's late
(very late) game goal.
With 10 minutes remaining in
the match, Andeberhan made
what would prove to be an ex
tremely key substitution. He sent
in Sime for a midfielder in order
to drop Jennifer Rowland back to
midfield.
When asked if he had inserted
Sime for some extra offensive
punch, Andeberhan replied, "Ac
tually, I sent Lisa in because they
were really hammering Rocket
(sophomore Jennifer Rowland). I
didn't want to remove Rocket's
speed, but I knew I couldn't leave
her at forward much longer."
As it turned out, though, Sime
would provide the winning margin
for the Cardinal, making An
deberhan's move look extremely
good.
With no more than four
minutes remaining in regulation

play, Sime took an apparently
harmless ball on the right wing
and began her move. A Gator
defender stood squarely in her
path; this is when the Stanford
sophomore went to work. She
made a small juke to the inside,
freezing the defender and beating
her badly to the outside.
Sime then angled in to take on
SFSU's goaltender Diane Rieve
one-on-one, and, making it look
effortless, Stanford's leading
scorer rolled a well-placed shot
just out of Rieve's reach into the
left corner of the goal.
Stanford's goal celebration was
far from electric. The Cardinal,
indeed, seemed to be more
relieved than ecstatic. The same
attitude was evident four minutes
later when the game ended, as
the Stanford players trudged onto
the field breathing sighs of relief.
Stanford's post-game reaction,
which was so void of emotion that
it approached being apathetic, can
be better understood when one
considers that Stanford was sup
posed to win the match.
SFSU, now 3-8-2, had some
hope of an upset only because they
had Stanford on their (sad excuse
for a) home field. Stanford was
certainly glad to pocket the win,
but the players' main source of
elation seemed to be the fact that
the wrestling match had ended.
