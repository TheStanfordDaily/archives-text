Of 40 medical centers that ap
plied for part of a $30 million
federal grant, the Stanford Med
ical School was one of seven to
receive funding for AIDS re
search.
Dr. Thomas Merigan, profes
sor of medical and infectious dis
eases at the Medical School, will
supervise the use of the $1.5
million in new funding, awarded
by the National Institutes of
Health.
Explaining that "Stanford's
focus on AIDS research is on
the therapeutic side," Merigan
said, "The funding is exciting,
not because of the amount of
it, but because it is additional
money to bring together lots of
individuals at Stanford. It's the
right kind of setting to do the
work."
According to Merigan, the re
search work at the Medical Cen
ter focuses on new methods of
treatment — chemical and bio
logical.

Approximately 40 medical
centers, all of which have an
AIDS research program with at
least $5 million in funding, ap
plied for the federal grant. At
Stanford, there are two divi
sions of AIDS research: the
AIDS Clinical Trial Unit and
the Drug Discovery Program,
which includes therapeutic im
munology.
The Medical School has been
involved in AIDS research for
three years. The NIH grant will
extend research for another five
years. Stanford has other grants
involving AIDS research that
fund on long-term basis.
"It was an unusual kind of
award because it encourages
people to work together," said
Clinical Pharmacology Prof.
Terrance Blaschke, one of the
primary researchers involved
with the use of the grant.
"We can become a granting
agency of our own," said
Blaschke.
The money is not for a specific
researcher or field of research,
"but is essential for the core

function of research at Stan
ford," Blaschke said. However
one area of concern is renova
tion of certain biohazard facili
ties that need to be updated or
expanded, he added.
Funding will go — without
delay — to individuals that
Merigan and the other research
ers choose.
Commenting on a Harvard
University report which found
that most Americans are afraid
of the AIDS virus and that in
dividuals afflicted with the dis
ease "face hostility from a sub
stantial number of Americans,"
Merigan stressed the need for
an understanding of the me
chanical spread of the virus.
"We have controlled blood cir
culation and have changed
people's habits through educa
tion," said Merigan. "The gov
ernment has to pass the right
laws, and Proposition 102
(which would make public the
results of AIDS testing) is [a
step] in the wrong direction,"
he said.
