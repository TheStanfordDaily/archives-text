Five Stanford students were ar
rested in San Francisco during a
protest against U.S. involvement
in El Salvador Saturday.
The students, members of the
Stanford Central American Action
Network, marched through the
streets of downtown San Fran
cisco as part of a 63-city campaign
protesting U.S. involvement in the
war in El Salvador.
A total of 110 protestors were
detained for blocking traffic,
obstruction, resisting arrest and
other official charges, according
to the San Francisco Police De
partment press service. The de
partment declined any further
comment on the incident.
The Stanford students who
were arrested are sophomore
Joanna Davidson, sophomore
Joanie Mayer, junior Heather
McClure, second-year graduate
student Marcia Klotz, second-year

graduate student Josie Saldana
and '88 graduate Leah Schuster,
reported Ben Robinson, a member
of the Stanford group who atten
ded the protest.
The three-mile march ended at
the Presidio, which serves as
headquarters for the United
States 6th Army. At the Presidio,
protesters encountered more than
100 city police and about 50 mil
itary police, Robinson said.
The police set up barriers to
prevent marchers from entering
the Presidio, he said, explaining
that the students "started to
peacefully remove the barricades
until the police moved forward to
stop us."
According to Robinson, the pro
testers then started putting up
shanties on Francisco Street, but
the police moved in and dis
mantled the shanties that were
blocking the street.
"The shanties represented the
situation that the Salvadoran
people have been forced into by

the war," Robinson explained.
At this point, the city police
threatened to arrest the protest
ers if they continued to block the
street, Mayer said. The 120 pro
testers, including the Stanford
students, remained in the street
and were subsequently arrested.
Most protesters were released
on their own recognizance about
five hours after the arrest, Klotz
said. Court dates have been set
to arraign the students, but they
have not yet decided on a plea,
Robinson said.
Unlike the other students,
Mayer decided to stay in jail so
she could obtain a quick arraign
ment.
However, late Saturday night
she decided to cite out, as the
other students had done earlier
in the day. As a result, her court
date comes after the other protes
tors.
