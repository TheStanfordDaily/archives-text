# USW agrees to outside mediation of contract talks

### Laura Jacobson Staff writer 
While the United Stanford Workers
agreed Thursday to a University proposal
for federal mediation of current labor con
tract negotiations, they are still questioning
the value of mediation with so many issues
on the table.
Commissioner Maggie Jacobson from the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
will join the fray of negotiations to expedite
the slow and uneven bargaining which
began July 26. Jacobson will meet with
the union at 10 a.m. today and with the
University at noon.
The union agreed to mediation last
Thursday because the University has "bas
ically frozen," USW negotiator Mary
Mocine said.
Stanford employees have been working
without a labor contract since the previous
three-year contract expired Aug. 31. The
USW represents 1,300 technical, service
and maintenance workers around campus,
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and

the Stanford Medical Center. The last
negotiating session was Oct. 8.
Assigned to these negotiations in July,
Jacobson, a "neutral expert," will now also
act as a mediator, facilitating the process
of collective bargaining, according to a press
statement released Sept. 23 by University
negotiator Michael Vartain.

The University proposed on Sept. 18 that
Jacobson be brought in to facilitate nego
tiations. Although Vartain could not be
reached yesterday for comment, he ex
plained earlier that federal mediators have
given "valuable assistance" in past contract
negotiations.
According to Mocine, the mediator
usually intervenes near the end of negoti
ations when the parties are at an impasse.
The union initially rejected the University's
proposal on the grounds that mediation
was premature and unnecessary.
Even now, Mocine questioned why the
University has pushed for a mediator.
"You don't normally go to mediation
when there are so many issues on the
table," Mocine said. "We don't feel this is
necessary, but the University doesn't seem
to be able to handle it any other way.
"They simply don't say what they want,
what their thinking is or why they are
doing what they are doing," she said. "They
don't seem to be able to move without
someone holding their hand."
Some of the unresolved issues include

grievance procedure, union dues and union
representation, a definition of the types of
work the University may contract to out
side parties, wages and benefits.
Also this weekend, almost 30 union
workers from SLAC gathered outside ship
ping and receiving at noon to listen to
USW representatives give an update on the
progress of negotiations.
"There are so many takeaways on the
table that if we gave them (their proposals)
right now, you wouldn't have a union in
six months," USW Representative Reuben
Serna told the small gathering.
Although a few workers preferred not to
participate, a small but spirited group of
20 marched to the Administration and En
gineering Building, blowing whistles and
carrying signs.
After circling the inside of the building
twice chanting, "We want a contract and
we want it now," the group dispersed,
drawing the attention of everyone who was
in the building during lunch. Unfortunate
ly, this did not include a SLAC adminis
trator.
