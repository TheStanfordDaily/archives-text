Some pay late, invest first
Some Washington State University students
find it more profitable to invest their tuition
money than pay it on time, according to a WSU
university administrator.
Maureen Anderson, vice provost for Student
Affairs, said a few students are taking advantage
of the system and investing their tuition money.
"There are some (students) who find a $100
reenrollment fee is still a bargain. Someone who
buys a certificate of deposit and wants to collect
interest on it â€” that is not an acceptable reason
(to not pay)," Anderson said.
This year 238 students were disenrolled from
the university because they did not meet the fee
deadline on Sept. 20, WSU University Receivables
Supervisor Pat Emerson said.

Students lower book prices
Newly established student control of the UC-
Santa Barbara University Center has thus far
brought a 5 percent decrease in textbook prices,

new student managers said, and a 1.23 percent
average increase in food prices.
"Textbooks for new and used have been lowered
by 5 percent," Associated Students President
Javier LaFianza explained. "Personally, my goal
is another 5 percent because computer sales (in
the bookstore) are doing very, very well."
"We will probably make less money, probably
about 25 percent less profit, but the obvious
benefit is that textbooks are ... an essential,"
said Ken Bowers, director of the campus book
store.

S. African texts draw fire
A UC-Davis professor using textbooks pub
lished in South Africa has upset some students
and raised a question regarding campus policy
toward textbooks.
"It's not a matter of the books themselves, it's
a matter of where they come form," said Nadine
Bent Russell, an executive member of UC-Davis'
student government.
