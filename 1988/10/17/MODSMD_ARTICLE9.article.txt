## Bush's confidence soars Says he's ready to 'hit ground running' as president 
### 
DENVER (AP) - Vice Presi
dent George Bush said yesterday
he s ready to "hit the ground run
ning' as president and to desig
nate a Cabinet swiftly, but that
he won't be lulled into regarding
an election victory as inevitable.
"There was speculation that I
was dead three months ago," the
Republican presidential nominee
told reporters, trying to discount
recent polls showing him with a
widening lead over Democrat Mi
chael Dukakis.
He vowed to wage a spirited
battle against the Massachusetts
governor in key states right up
to Election Day on Nov. 8.
Hush scoffed at reports suggest
ing he had already decided on
most of his prospective Cabinet.
"I am not going to do something
that dumb and shift gears," he

said.
"And yet, should I win, it would
be a matter of urgent priority. I'd
want to be ready to move early
on the priorities that I've estab
lished."
He said "there is not one scin
tilla of overconfidence" that he
has all but won the election.
At his first news conference in
more than two weeks, Bush said
his election should drive interest
rates down, claimed that the Iran-
Contra affair was behind him, and
took aim at a familiar target â€”
Harvard University.
"There's an elite inside the elite
there. And everyone knows who
I'm talking about," Bush said.
Campaigning Saturday in
Modesto, Calif., Bush said, "I
don't want somebody from Har
vard telling me what I can do and

what I can't do."
Asked about that statement,
Bush said he did not want to take
on the institution itself, asking
"How can I, a nice guy from Yale,
feel that way about Harvard? Now
come on."
"I'm talking about a handful of
people that have served in (recent)
Democratic administrations that
come out of the same liberal
philisophy. And they know who
they are," he said.
Dukakis is a Harvard graduate,
and Bush in the past has accused
his rival of having a "Harvard
Yard boutique" mentality.
While spending the day in Den
ver visiting with his son, Neil,
and his family, Bush also attended
a professional football game be
tween the Denver Broncos and the
Atlanta Falcons.
