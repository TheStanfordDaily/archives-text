# Trailers slated for removal
## Permanent undergraduate housing to replace Manzanita 
### Tim Hullar Staff writer 
The era of "temporary
housing" for Stanford students
may finally be coming to an end.
Plans to tear down 21 percent
of Manzanita Park and replace
it with new undergraduate
housing is part of an overall pro
posal to restructure the entire
site, according to Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son. He said the plans will hope
fully be ready for approval at
the December Board of Trustees
meeting.
The master plan, commis
sioned by the Stanford Ad
minstrative Council, also recom
mends that the Toyon Eating
Clubs be moved from their pres
ent site to a nearby spot in order
to make way for an academic
administrative building. The
new location for the eating clubs

is still being considered.
Robinson stressed that "work
is still in the planning stages,"
but estimated that new housing
for 400 to 450 undergraduates
will be available as early as fall
of 1992. Robinson called the
Manzanita site "clear and away
the best one" for the new
housing.
The new residence would
most likely necessitate the
removal of 25 to 30 trailers in
Manzanita Park, according to
Robinson. The rest of the
trailers would be removed at a
later, unspecified date.
The architectural firm of
Backen, Arrigoni and Ross, has
already determined how many
trailers could be economically
removed without creating an
undue burden on the housing
budget. The San Francisco firm,
designers of the Rains complex,
developed architectural plans

for the Manzanita site.
Manzanita Park was given a
lifetime of five years when it
was built 20 years ago. The
"temporary housing" currently
includes 116 trailers.
Assuming that not enough
money for the residence is raised
in the Centennial Campaign,
Robinson said, the difference in
cost would have to be paid
through increased room rent.
Robinson estimated that ap
proximately $12 million of the
$1.1 billion Centennial Cam
paign drive is targeted toward
providing undergraduates with
four years of guaranteed
housing.
Robinson cautioned, however,
that "it's very hard to raise
money for housing" and that
donations for the project may
not be forthcoming.
