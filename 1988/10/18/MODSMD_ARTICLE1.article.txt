# Trailers slated for removal
## Permanent undergraduate housing to replace Manzanita 
### Tim Hullar Staff writer 
The era of "temporary
housing" for Stanford students
may finally be coming to an end.
Plans to tear down 21 percent
of Manzanita Park and replace
it with new undergraduate
housing is part of an overall pro
posal to restructure the entire
site, according to Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son. He said the plans will hope
fully be ready for approval at
the December Board of Trustees
meeting.
The master plan, commis
sioned by the Stanford Ad
minstrative Council, also recom
mends that the Toyon Eating
Clubs be moved from their pres
ent site to a nearby spot in order
to make way for an academic
administrative building. The
new location for the eating clubs

is still being considered.
Robinson stressed that "work
is still in the planning stages,"
but estimated that new housing
for 400 to 450 undergraduates
will be available as early as fall
of 1992. Robinson called the
Manzanita site "clear and away
the best one" for the new
housing.
The new residence would
most likely necessitate the
removal of 25 to 30 trailers in
Manzanita Park, according to
Robinson. The rest of the
trailers would be removed at a
later, unspecified date.
The architectural firm of
Backen, Arrigoni and Ross, has
already determined how many
trailers could be economically
removed without creating an
undue burden on the housing
budget. The San Francisco firm,
designers of the Rains complex,
developed architectural plans

for the Manzanita site.
Manzanita Park was given a
lifetime of five years when it
was built 20 years ago. The
"temporary housing" currently
includes 116 trailers.
Assuming that not enough
money for the residence is raised
in the Centennial Campaign,
Robinson said, the difference in
cost would have to be paid
through increased room rent.
Robinson estimated that ap
proximately $12 million of the
$1.1 billion Centennial Cam
paign drive is targeted toward
providing undergraduates with
four years of guaranteed
housing.
Robinson cautioned, however,
that "it's very hard to raise
money for housing" and that
donations for the project may
not be forthcoming.

Manzanita Trailer Park, which was originally built 20 years ago as "temporary" housing, has
finally been scheduled for replacement by permanent undergraduate housing.
If approved, the new Manzanita
residence also will allow Branner
Hall to serve meals seven days a
week instead of the current five,
by combining its kitchen with the
new residence, according to Rob
inson.
The University may also build
a program center, similar to the
Elliot Program Center, to serve
students living in East Campus
residences, Robinson said.
In addition, a recreational field
for students, similar to Wilbur
Field, would be planted in Man

zanita Park once all the trailers
are removed, Robinson said.
The other site considered was
on the driving range beyond
Governor's Corner.
The driving range is still one
of several West Campus sites
being considered for graduate stu
dent housing to replace those
spaces that could be lost from
Manzanita Park.
"A driving range is an amenity
found at almost any golf course
in the nation," said Alan Cum
mings, associate director of Ath
letics. He suggested the the Uni
versity might provide some
housing on the range while mov
ing it closer to Junipero Serra
Boulevard.

Plans for a new undergraduate
residence follow from Stanford's
stated student housing goals. Ac
cording to Stanford's General Use
Plan, currently being considered
by the Santa Clara County Office
of Planning, the University hopes
to offer four years of on-campus
housing to all undergraduates who
desire it.
The General Use Plan estimates
Stanford's total student popula
tion to grow by 10 percent between
1985 and 2000.
The University has divided
plans for building student housing
into three stages, said Robinson.
The first is the complex being
considered for Manzanita Park.
The second stage would be to

build further graduate housing,
possibly on the driving range, to
replace spaces lost by removing
all the trailers in Manzanita Park.
The third stage, termed
"decompression" by Robinson,
would create spaces for about 150
undergraduates, probably as part
of the new Manzanita Park com
plex.
Robinson stressed that only the
firpt phase has been considered
thus far. The entire project will
not be finished until "the 21st
century," according to Robinson.
The amount of graduate
housing needed in phase two "will
have to be studied carefully," ac
cording to Robinson.

cording to Stanford's General Use
Plan, currently being considered
by the Santa Clara County Office
of Planning, the University hopes
to offer four years of on-campus
housing to all undergraduates who
desire it.
The General Use Plan estimates
Stanford's total student popula
tion to grow by 10 percent between
1985 and 2000.
The University has divided
plans for building student housing
into three stages, said Robinson.
The first is the complex being
considered for Manzanita Park.
The second stage would be to

build further graduate housing,
possibly on the driving range, to
replace spaces lost by removing
all the trailers in Manzanita Park.
The third stage, termed
"decompression" by Robinson,
would create spaces for about 150
undergraduates, probably as part
of the new Manzanita Park com
plex.
Robinson stressed that only the
firpt phase has been considered
thus far. The entire project will
not be finished until "the 21st
century," according to Robinson.
The amount of graduate
housing needed in phase two "will
have to be studied carefully," ac
cording to Robinson.
The era of "temporary
housing" for Stanford students
may finally be coming to an end.
Plans to tear down 21 percent
of Manzanita Park and replace
it with new undergraduate
housing is part of an overall pro
posal to restructure the entire
site, according to Assoc. Dean
of Student Affairs Norm Robin
son. He said the plans will hope
fully be ready for approval at
the December Board of Trustees
meeting.
The master plan, commis
sioned by the Stanford Ad
minstrative Council, also recom
mends that the Toyon Eating
Clubs be moved from their pres
ent site to a nearby spot in order
to make way for an academic
administrative building. The
new location for the eating clubs

is still being considered.
Robinson stressed that "work
is still in the planning stages,"
but estimated that new housing
for 400 to 450 undergraduates
will be available as early as fall
of 1992. Robinson called the
Manzanita site "clear and away
the best one" for the new
housing.
The new residence would
most likely necessitate the
removal of 25 to 30 trailers in
Manzanita Park, according to
Robinson. The rest of the
trailers would be removed at a
later, unspecified date.
The architectural firm of
Backen, Arrigoni and Ross, has
already determined how many
trailers could be economically
removed without creating an
undue burden on the housing
budget. The San Francisco firm,
designers of the Rains complex,
developed architectural plans

for the Manzanita site.
Manzanita Park was given a
lifetime of five years when it
was built 20 years ago. The
"temporary housing" currently
includes 116 trailers.
Assuming that not enough
money for the residence is raised
in the Centennial Campaign,
Robinson said, the difference in
cost would have to be paid
through increased room rent.
Robinson estimated that ap
proximately $12 million of the
$1.1 billion Centennial Cam
paign drive is targeted toward
providing undergraduates with
four years of guaranteed
housing.
Robinson cautioned, however,
that "it's very hard to raise
money for housing" and that
donations for the project may
not be forthcoming.

Manzanita Trailer Park, which was originally built 20 years ago as "temporary" housing, has
finally been scheduled for replacement by permanent undergraduate housing.
If approved, the new Manzanita
residence also will allow Branner
Hall to serve meals seven days a
week instead of the current five,
by combining its kitchen with the
new residence, according to Rob
inson.
The University may also build
a program center, similar to the
Elliot Program Center, to serve
students living in East Campus
residences, Robinson said.
In addition, a recreational field
for students, similar to Wilbur
Field, would be planted in Man

zanita Park once all the trailers
are removed, Robinson said.
The other site considered was
on the driving range beyond
Governor's Corner.
The driving range is still one
of several West Campus sites
being considered for graduate stu
dent housing to replace those
spaces that could be lost from
Manzanita Park.
"A driving range is an amenity
found at almost any golf course
in the nation," said Alan Cum
mings, associate director of Ath
letics. He suggested the the Uni
versity might provide some
housing on the range while mov
ing it closer to Junipero Serra
Boulevard.

Plans for a new undergraduate
residence follow from Stanford's
stated student housing goals. Ac
