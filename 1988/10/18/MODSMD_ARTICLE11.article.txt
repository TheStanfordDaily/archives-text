# Three researchers win Nobel Prize in medicine

STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two re
searchers from the United States and one
from Britain won the Nobel Prize in
medicine yesterday for helping develop
drugs to fight AIDS, herpes, leukemia,
malaria, heart disease and stomach ulcers.
The award capped more than four
decades of pioneering work for Gertrude
Elion and George Hitchings, who began
collaborating in 1945 at Wellcome Research
Laboratories in Research Triangle Park,
N.C.
They share the $390,000 prize with
James Black of King's College Hospital
Medical School in London. His research led
to a beta blocker drug for heart disease
and a drug for peptic ulcers.
"I wished I had my beta blockers handy,"
Black, 64, quipped at a news conference
at King's College after he learned he won.
Dr. Gosta Garton, a member of the Nobel
Assembly at Karolinska Institute, which
awards the prize, said the three winners
were "well-chosen."
"You can see the direct working effects"
of their research, said Garton. "The entire
research world knows that they have been
in the picture for years."
The Nobel Assembly credited Elion, 70,
and Hitchings, 83, with helping develop six
different drugs that can be used for at least
nine serious conditions.
They included 6-mercaptopurine and
thioguanine for leukemia; azathioprine for
organ transplant rejection and autoimmune
diseases; allopurinol for gout; acyclovir for
herpes virus infections, pyrimethamine for
malaria; and trimethoprim for bacterial in
fections and pulmonary infections brought

on by AIDS.
The assembly said their ideas also paved
the way for development of azidothymidine,
or AZT, which is the best documented drug
so far in the treatment of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
AIDS, usually transmitted through
sexual contact, infected needles or blood
transfusions, renders the immune system
unable to resist disease. AZT is the only
federally approved drug for treating AIDS
in the United States.
"I'm pleased more for my descendants
than I am for myself," Hitchings said from
his office at Wellcome. "I've had a lot of
honors, but the most important honors for
me have been meeting patients whose lives
have been saved or whose children's lives
have been saved by drugs I've invented."
Elion said from her home in Chapel Hill,
N.C, that she couldn't believe she won and
didn't even know she was nominated.
Asked about her greatest achievement,
she said: "You can't discriminate among
your 'children.' Each one in its own time
was the most exciting."
Elion and Hitchings broke new ground
in finding the difference in the processing
of genetic material between normal cells
and cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria and
viruses, the Nobel Assembly said.
Knowing those differences allowed re
searchers to attack disease-causing or
ganisms by interfering with their replica
tion without harming healthy ones, the
assembly said.
Black helped develop propranolol, a beta
blocker used to treat heart disease and
high blood pressure.
