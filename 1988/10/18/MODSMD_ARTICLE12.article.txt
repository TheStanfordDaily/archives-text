# Mexico gets loan
## U.S. to support economic reforms 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Mexico will receive a short
term loan of up to $3.5 billion
from the Treasury Department
and Federal Reserve to support
new economic reforms the
country is instituting, officials
said yesterday.
"The U.S. financial authori
ties believe that these meas
ures (in Mexico) build upon the
progress already achieved in
the sustained adjustment effort
undergone by the Mexican eco
nomy," the Treasury and cen
tral bank said in a statement.
The loan from the Fed and
Treasury is intended as a
"bridge" until Mexico can
develop a longer-term loan pro
gram with the World Bank and
the International Monetary
Fund.
The Mexican government on
Saturday announced a series
of measures designed to cope
with the unanticipated decline
in world oil prices.
They included more privati
zation of state-owned busi
nesses, a plan to hold down the
Mexican budget deficit and the
extension, through the end of
the year, of the so-called Eco

nomic Solidarity Pact.
The pact, among the busi
ness, labor and government
sectors, includes a series of
inflation-fighting moves in
cluding a freeze on peso cur
rency exchange rates and on
the minimum wage on prices
for government-regulated
goods and services.
The U.S. statement praised
"Mexico's adjustment record"
in reducing its budget deficit
and improving its trade bal
ance, which it said "has estab
lished the basic conditions for
the renewal of sustained eco
nomic growth."
"U.S. and Mexican authori
ties have agreed that Mexico's
strengthened economic policies
merit support," the statement
said.
Despite the decline in oil in
come, Mexico had a trade
surplus equivalent to $8.4 bil
lion. But reduced oil revenue
makes it harder for the country
to keep up with service pay
ments on its $104 billion
foreign debt, the second-largest
in the developing world after
Brazil.
