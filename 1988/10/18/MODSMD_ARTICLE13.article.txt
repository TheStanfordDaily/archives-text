PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) â€” The military
government said yesterday it had foiled an attempted
coup against President Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril by
two military officers.
Radio Soleil said "several soldiers were wounded"
and 30 soldiers were arrested in the coup attempt
early Sunday. It gave no further details.
Government spokesman Frantz Lubin said the
coup was led by Sgt. Patrick Bochard, who headed
a government lottery, and former Col. Samuel
Jeremie, who escaped from prison following the
Sept. 17 coup that brought Avril to power.
"Certain other officers have been discharged,"
Lubin said. "They had maneuvered to stage a coup
against the military government of Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril."
On Sept. 17, rank-and-file soldiers ousted Haitian
ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and installed Avril
as president.
Lubin said he had no further information on the
circumstances surrounding the coup attempt.
Yesterday, Avril presided over ceremonies
celebrating Haiti's independence from France in
1804 at the National Palace.
A half-mile away, about 6,000 people took part
in the fourth day of demonstrations protesting a
Roman Catholic Church order for an activist priest,
the Rev. Jean Aristide, to leave Haiti.
The popular priest was to leave the country Mon
day, but it could not be determined whether he had
complied with the order.
The Sept. 17 coup was triggered in part by a
massacre at Aristide's church the previous week,
in which thugs armed with guns, machetes, clubs
and spikes killed at least 12 people, wounded 70
others and burned down the church.
The motive for Sunday's attempted coup was
unclear. There was no indication the attempt was
linked to protests over Aristide's proposed ouster.
