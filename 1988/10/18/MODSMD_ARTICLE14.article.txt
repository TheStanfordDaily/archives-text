# U.S., Philippines agree on bases

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
United States and the Philippines
concluded an agreement yesterday
to guarantee U.S. military use of
strategic air and naval bases in
the Southeast Asian country
through 1991 in exchange for
$962 million in American aid.
That represents an increase of
$258 million in economic and mil
itary assistance as part of a com
plicated arrangement that permits
the Philippines to use "a substan
tial portion" to reduce its debt
and bars American soldiers who
test positive for AIDS from serv
ing in the country.
The successful conclusion of
what at times had been difficult
negotiations could foreshadow ex
tension of the U.S. military pres
ence in the strategic Asian nation
beyond 1991, but the terms will
have to be negotiated between the
two sides, probably beginning
next year.
Another key provision of the
agreement, which was released as
Secretary of State George Shultz
and Foreign Secretary Haul
Manglapus signed the pact, main
tains the U.S. policy of not dis
closing whether ships or planes
stopping at the bases or passing
through carry nuclear weapons.
"These transits, overflights or
visits will be conducted in accord
ance with existing procedures
which may be changed or
modified, as necessary, by mutual
agreement of both parties," the
memorandum said.
However, the Philippines gov
ernment has the power to prohibit
storing nuclear, chemical or other
non-conventional weaponry on its
territory.

The nuclear issue was one of
the key items that had to be
settled before the United States
could be assured continued use of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval
Base and four lesser installations.
The accord also deeds to the
Philippines all permanent facili
ties and improvements on build
ings at the bases. The two gov
ernments pledged, meanwhile, to
take steps to ensure a smooth
transition of the bases to Philip
pine control if the United States
decides in the future to abandon

them.
In a ceremony in the State De
partment's Treaty Room,
Manglapus said that once
Filipinos realize what the agree
ment gives them, they "will accept
it as an agreement that is in
keeping with the expectations of
our people, not only in the matter
of compensation . . . but also to
other issues that we feel to be
relevant to the question of na
tional dignity."
The agreement covers only the
next two years.
