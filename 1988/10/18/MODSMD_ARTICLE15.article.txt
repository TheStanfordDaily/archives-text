Ugandan plane crashes in Rome
ROME (AP) — The pilot of a Uganda Airlines
jet tried three times to land in thick fog at
Rome's main airport before the Boeing 707
crashed into houses and trees early yesterday,
killing 31 of the 52 people aboard, authorities
reported.
The fog, a possible "misunderstanding" be
tween pilot and control tower at Leonardo da
Vinci Airport, and lack of sophisticated equipment
on a seldom-used runway were cited as suspected
factors in the crash.
All 21 survivors were hospitalized, many in
critical condition with burns, fractures and shock.
Only one of seven crew members, a steward,
survived.
Wreckage was strewn for half a mile, but only
one iryury was reported on the ground.
Rome police headquarters spokesman Paolo
Moscarelli said late yesterday that one passenger
died in a hospital, raising the death toll to 31.
Among survivors was British dairy farmer
Geoffrey Gait, who said he and his wife Ruth,
who was holding their 8-month-old son, jumped
from the wreckage right before it went up in
flames. The family suffered slight burns.
The jet missed the runway by several hundred
yards. It tore through a wooden house, clipped
a garage, demolished a brick house under con
struction and plowed through the parking lot of
a car rental agency, where an engine and a wing
tore off and a fire destroyed 75 cars, according
to authorities.
Top Yugoslavian calls for reform
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) — The Commu
nist Party chief urged the nation yesterday to
unite behind reform or face destruction, but one
regional leader defiantly defended ethnic rallies
that have fueled its worst postwar crisis.
Several weeks of ethnic and economic unrest
and disputes among Yugoslavia's six republics

and two autonomous provinces have prompted
speculation of a military coup, but the defense
minister sought to allay those fears.
National party chief Stipe Suvar opened a key
session of the party's Central Committee with a
call for "a fundamental renewal of socialism" and
urgent economic and political reforms.
"All of us in this country are faced with a
choice — either we all resolve the crisis together,
or we all head to destruction," he said in a
two-hour speech.
The meeting was billed as a historic gathering
to shake up the party leadership, but it was not
immediately known whether it made per
sonnel changes.
Lyndon Laßouche trial underway
ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) - Political extremist
Lyndon Laßouche and six co-defendants pleaded
innocent yesterday to federal fraud and conspir
acy charges in connection with alleged loans to
his enterprises.
In an arraignment lasting less than 10 minutes,
Laßouche and his associates spoke only once: to
swear, "I do" to a promise to return to court
for trial Nov. 21 and for a hearing on a motion
Nov. 10.
U.S. District Judge Albert Bryan speeded the
proceeding by saying that he assumed that all
the defendants were pleading innocent and asking
for a jury trial. Their lawyers nodded agreement.
Laßouche was more vocal at a news conference
in Washington earlier yesterday, calling the in
dictment "a heap of garbage" and asserting, "I'm
certainly not guilty."
"This is purely a political stunt," the 66-year
old independent candidate for president said.
"Nebulous charges never occur this close to an
election except as a dirty trick."
Laßouche was indicted in Alexandria last Fri
day on 13 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy to
commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service.
