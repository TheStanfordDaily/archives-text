Senior Class Pub Night
is unfair to seniors who
are under 21 years old

UNDER-AGED SENIORS
are out of luck.
Last week, when Senior
Pub Night was held at Palo Alto's
42nd Street, many Stanford
seniors, if they attended, would
have found themselves turned out
into the streets.
At 42nd Street, only students
who are 21 years old or older may
be admitted. According to the
Registrar's Office, at least 334
members of the senior class are
not 21. Yet, the senior class presi
dents claim that pub nights are
intended to bring the class together
as a whole.
While the senior class presidents
should be commended for their
work on projects such as last
week's "Senior Disorientation,"
senior class tailgaters, senior book,
"Full Moon in the Quad" and the
"Senior Event," they seem to have
given little thought to the issue of
age when planning this year's
Senior Pub Nights.
Though the first pub night held
at The Vortex allowed those under
21 years of age to enter with a
Stanford senior ID, this policy
seems to be the exception to the
rule.
When originally approached
about pub nights, the senior class
presidents were unsure about the

admissions policy at many of the
clubs where they had scheduled
pub nights.
But within the last two days,
the senior class presidents have
made sure that two clubs where
future pub nights will be held will
admit seniors under 21.
Yet, these arrangements seem to
be an afterthought and being 21
is still a requirement for attending
the majority of Senior Pub Nights.
It seems that being 21 is the
only prerequisite for attending
Senior Pub Night. At last week's
pub night, senior IDs were not even
required. People who were not in
the class of '89 were allowed to
enter while those seniors under the
age of 21 were denied entrance.
Granted, the senior class presi
dents have few options as to where
they can hold pub nights. There
are not many clubs in the Stanford
vicinity that allow minors into
their establishments.
For this reason, the senior class
presidents argue, it is impossible
to hold pub nights only at these
places.
If the stated purpose of Senior
Pu>> Night is to bring the class
tcgether as a whole, more attention
should be given to including every
one. Diversity of atmosphere is im
portant, but it should not receive
top priority at the expense of more
than 343 members of the class of
'89.
Though the senior class presi
dents claim to be upholding a Stan
ford "tradition," a tradition that
implements a policy of exclusion
should be questioned.
