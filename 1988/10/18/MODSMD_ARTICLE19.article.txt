## Sometimes I wonder 
### 
"Suddenly there is being and there is
non-being, but I don't know which of being
and non-being is really being or really
non-being. 1 have just said something,
but I don't know if what I have said
really says something or nothing."
— From The Mystical Way of Chuang Tzu
Upon reading the above quote, I im
mediately saw the light and fell into an
ethereal stupor of collectively random
thoughts, questions and non-answers.
Why don't Daily columnists get paid
lots of money for writing? Is it because
columnists are supposed to represent
Stanford students, the Stanford commu
nity, Palo Alto, California, the United
States of America, the Third World, the
Second World, the solar system, the Milky
Way and the entire universe? Will paying
columnists like me to write dumb articles
cause a conflict of interest?
Why does anyone read this column?
Why does anyone read the Daily? Do
vendors at White Plaza read the Daily?
Is vending at White Plaza really as
profitable as it looks? Why are things at
the Bookstore so expensive if it's non
profit? Is the management covertly fund
ing the Centennial Campaign? Is there
life after the Centennial Campaign? Will
Stanford cease to exist? Will dating come
into existence if Stanford ceases to exist?
Will Hoover cease to exist if Stanford
ceases to exist? Does anyone exist at Hoo
ver? If so, why don't they make them
selves more available to Stanford
students?
What is the average temperature dif
ferential between the top of Hoover Tower

and the bottom? What is the average
price difference between University Food
Service and McDonald's? Why is board
plan "B" so expensive? Why is board plan
"A" even more expensive? Where does all
the money go? Empty milk machines . . .
cube steak ... brown rice .. . pink tofu
.. . people trained with the technical ex
pertise to put in your mealcard . . . waste
.. . mismanagement .. . Dukakis' cam
paign staff?
Why does Dukakis' campaign staff
seem so inept? Do they know that "com
petence" isn't a winning theme? Why
isn't Bentsen running for President? Why
is it so easy to rag on Quayle? What does
the "J." in J. Danforth Quayle really
stand for? Junipero Serra? Joke? Jai a
lai? Jimson weed? Jingoism? Jejunum?
Jack Kennedy? Jack-in-the-Box? Ken
tucky Fried Chicken?
Is a McDonald's shake really
polymerized hair gel in liquid form? Will
four days in the hot sun really cause it
to coagulate? If one drinks a McDonald's
shake and then lies out in the sun, will
coagulation cause rupturing of the
jejunum?
Is it true that certain polymerized
chemicals in L.A.'s water supply have
caused certain people brain-damage? Is
there a correlation between these chemi
cals and impulsive hair-product purchas
ing?
How does Ted Koppel get his hair so
darned puffy? Does he use Dippity-Do?
Nexus Polymeric Styling Gel With Extra
Hold? McDonald's shakes?
What artificial coloring goes into red
colored Dippity-Do? Why did Stanford

choose the color Cardinal as a mascot?
Can Stanford be any less subtle in
copying Harvard next time?
Is it true that there is one place worse
than Harvard — Winnemucca, Nev.? Is
it true that Winnemucca is next to Gol
conda and Humboldt, which is next to
Beowawe and Rye Patch, which in turn
is next to some secret nuclear test site?
Is it true that Las Vegas is to Wir.nemuca
as a prime rib dinner is to wildebeast
carrion?
Is it true that oftentimes faculty are
retained based on how many books they
write and not on how well they teach?
Do Republicans exist within the Stanford
faculty? Why do some Innovative Aca
demic Courses seem so left-wing?
Who gets to pick which flicks should
be shown? Imagine the power. Do ASSU
Senators have any power? If so, why ha
ven't we gotten a bigger beach at Lake
Lag?
How many 12 ounce bottles of Bud
would it take to fill up Lake Lag?
50,000,000 gallons, 128 ounces to the
gallon, 12 ounces per beer — approxi
mately 533,333,333 bottles? Why have 1
run out of space?

"Suddenly there is being and there is
non-being, but I don't know which of being
and non-being is really being or really
non-being. 1 have just said something,
but I don't know if what I have said
really says something or nothing."
— From The Mystical Way of Chuang Tzu
Upon reading the above quote, I im
mediately saw the light and fell into an
ethereal stupor of collectively random
thoughts, questions and non-answers.
Why don't Daily columnists get paid
lots of money for writing? Is it because
columnists are supposed to represent
Stanford students, the Stanford commu
nity, Palo Alto, California, the United
States of America, the Third World, the
Second World, the solar system, the Milky
Way and the entire universe? Will paying
columnists like me to write dumb articles
cause a conflict of interest?
Why does anyone read this column?
Why does anyone read the Daily? Do
vendors at White Plaza read the Daily?
Is vending at White Plaza really as
profitable as it looks? Why are things at
the Bookstore so expensive if it's non
profit? Is the management covertly fund
ing the Centennial Campaign? Is there
life after the Centennial Campaign? Will
Stanford cease to exist? Will dating come
into existence if Stanford ceases to exist?
Will Hoover cease to exist if Stanford
ceases to exist? Does anyone exist at Hoo
ver? If so, why don't they make them
selves more available to Stanford
students?
What is the average temperature dif
ferential between the top of Hoover Tower

and the bottom? What is the average
price difference between University Food
Service and McDonald's? Why is board
plan "B" so expensive? Why is board plan
"A" even more expensive? Where does all
the money go? Empty milk machines . . .
cube steak ... brown rice .. . pink tofu
.. . people trained with the technical ex
pertise to put in your mealcard . . . waste
.. . mismanagement .. . Dukakis' cam
paign staff?
Why does Dukakis' campaign staff
seem so inept? Do they know that "com
petence" isn't a winning theme? Why
isn't Bentsen running for President? Why
is it so easy to rag on Quayle? What does
the "J." in J. Danforth Quayle really
stand for? Junipero Serra? Joke? Jai a
lai? Jimson weed? Jingoism? Jejunum?
Jack Kennedy? Jack-in-the-Box? Ken
tucky Fried Chicken?
Is a McDonald's shake really
polymerized hair gel in liquid form? Will
four days in the hot sun really cause it
to coagulate? If one drinks a McDonald's
shake and then lies out in the sun, will
coagulation cause rupturing of the
jejunum?
Is it true that certain polymerized
chemicals in L.A.'s water supply have
caused certain people brain-damage? Is
there a correlation between these chemi
cals and impulsive hair-product purchas
ing?
How does Ted Koppel get his hair so
darned puffy? Does he use Dippity-Do?
Nexus Polymeric Styling Gel With Extra
Hold? McDonald's shakes?
What artificial coloring goes into red
colored Dippity-Do? Why did Stanford

choose the color Cardinal as a mascot?
Can Stanford be any less subtle in
copying Harvard next time?
Is it true that there is one place worse
than Harvard — Winnemucca, Nev.? Is
it true that Winnemucca is next to Gol
conda and Humboldt, which is next to
Beowawe and Rye Patch, which in turn
is next to some secret nuclear test site?
Is it true that Las Vegas is to Wir.nemuca
as a prime rib dinner is to wildebeast
carrion?
Is it true that oftentimes faculty are
retained based on how many books they
write and not on how well they teach?
Do Republicans exist within the Stanford
faculty? Why do some Innovative Aca
demic Courses seem so left-wing?
Who gets to pick which flicks should
be shown? Imagine the power. Do ASSU
Senators have any power? If so, why ha
ven't we gotten a bigger beach at Lake
Lag?
How many 12 ounce bottles of Bud
would it take to fill up Lake Lag?
50,000,000 gallons, 128 ounces to the
gallon, 12 ounces per beer — approxi
mately 533,333,333 bottles? Why have 1
run out of space?
