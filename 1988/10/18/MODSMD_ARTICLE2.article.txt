# Plan cuts parking, car access
## 
### Malinda McCollum 
In an effort to reduce competi
tion between pedestrians, bicycles
and cars on campus, the Planning
Office has developed a traffic plan
that will eliminate some current
parking spaces and limit automo
bile access to campus.
The 1988 Circulation Plan,
which calls for the reorganization
of existing traffic zones, proposes
to expand the pedestrian zone
while restricting automobile
access to the inner campus. Pend
ing approval by the Planning Of
fice and Transportation Pro
grams, staff parking lots behind

Old Union and between Green Li
brary and Hoover Institution may
be replaced with spaces for dis
abled persons, service vehicles and
special purposes.
Twenty-three other parking
spaces may be lost by creating
bike lanes on Santa Teresa Street.
But planning officials expect that
the March 1989 completion of
Parking Structure II on Panama
Street and Via Ortega will provide
an additional 750 spaces and
replace the lost area.
A long range recommendation
of the plan is to restrict private
vehicle traffic on Santa Teresa
Street from Lomita Drive to

Samuel Morris Way. Although this
would leave Mayfield Avenue as
the only direct vehicle access to
and from the campus core, plan
ners don't forsee any new traffic
problems.
"We don't anticipate it to ex
acerbate the situation," said
Charlotte Strem, planner and
analyst for the Planning Office.
Another facet of the plan is to
improve bicycle safety and eti
quette through education and en
forcement. The plan suggests that
people be cited for illegal parking
of bicycles and that additional
staff be added to the Public Safety
Office.
