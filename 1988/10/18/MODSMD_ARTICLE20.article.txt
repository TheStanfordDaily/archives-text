## All must fight bigotry and build a better community 
### 
IT IS DIFFICULT to express the
distress and disappointment I feel
over the events that occurred in
Ujamaa over the weekend.
On Saturday morning I had told two
different groups of Stanford graduates
that — as a residential university with
an unusually diverse student body —
we had a real opportunity to develop
one of the very first working multicul
tural communities, and so provide for
others a positive model of what life
can become for the United States in
the 21st century.
How sadly ironic that as I spoke, the
residents of Ujamaa were coping with
the emotional aftermath of an attack

of bigotry in their own home.
I hope that all of us can try to say
to them, even though it may be too
late for comfort, that such behavior is
not an acceptable part of our culture
here, but an intolerable aberration; and
that we are committed to helping them
repair the damage.
In particular, those of us who are
not members of minority groups need
to shoulder the burden of seeking
understanding and of making the
necessary efforts to prevent any repeti
tion of such incidents.
I told the freshmen at Orientation
that bigotry was OUT, and I mean it.

That message was intended for every
one, in all segments of the Stanford
community. Behavior of this kind is
not excusable on the grounds of ignor
ance, or of being drunk, those explana
tions do not work here.
We are investigating this incident, in
preparation for possible charges under
the Fundamental Standard. Our rules
require care and due process and they
will li' observed; but we intend to
move as swiftly as we can. There
should be no doubt in this community
that the administration takes such
matters very seriously indeed.
It is also important to be realistic in
our expectations. No set of institu-

tional values, no matter how frequently
and persuasively stated and no matter
how vigorously enforced, can make us
completely immune to forces and
attitudes that exist in the society at
large.
But that reality should not dis
courage us in our task of creating a
better community here. Nor should
occasional failures — and this is a
serious one — persuade us that we are
after all no better than the rest of
society in this regard. We are, and we
must retain our commitment to be
better still.
