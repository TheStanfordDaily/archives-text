# Murals in Zapata do not deserve a 'communist' label
## 
### 
It's sad Professor Cohn had to blast
Bolivar House for having "communist
murals" (The Daily, Oct. 10) and then
apologize to say he meant Zapata had
the "political murals" (The Daily, Oct.
14). The double slip is very telling but
we do understand and forgive.
He is certainly entitled to his com
ments but anyone who does not agree
with the right should not so readily be
labeled a communist just as any resi
dence with a Spanish name should not
be confused with Zapata, even though
Simon Bolivar and Emiliano Zapata
were both revolutionaries.
I don't want to engage in polemics;
however, Professor Cohn does a great
disservice to Zapata students living
here for they run the political gamut
from conservative to liberal, yet I
doubt you would find one communist
or communist mural here. In this

country that is a very serious charge.
And in this house we respect each
other's political viewpoints because like
with any family, this is a home.
We would like to extend an invita
tion to Professor Cohn, and any stu
dent, faculty or staff member that
would like to take a docent tour of
Casa Zapata's murals. We do have
tours and would be happy to have
him. We would be more than willing to
talk on the historical, political and
creative process of these murals, an
swer questions and listen to his com
ments.
