# Incident in Ujamaa makes one resident feel badly betrayed
## 
### 
I for one have had enough. The
recent incidents in Ujamaa House only
highlight a serious problem existing in
the Stanford community. Bigotry is not

"out." It is alive and well.
It is bad enough when campus
groups make offensive flyers, hold
threatening late-night vigils, perform
"Indian" dances and then plead ignor
ance as an excuse for these derogatory
acts, asking for forgiveness. But the
defacing of other people's property
with racial epithets and depictions
cannot be explained away by ignorance.
These acts were clearly intentional, and
I am incapable of forgiving any more.
The fact that this could happen in
any dorm on this campus is appalling.
The fact that it happened in Ujamaa is
even more atrocious. As an African-
American student and a resident of this
theme house, whose purpose is to cele
brate my history and culture, I feel
insulted and betrayed. Residential Edu
cation has betrayed its commitment to
Ujamaa by What I feel was purposeful
manipulation to decrease the number
of blacks living in Ujamaa, as well as
by placing students here who do not
want to be here while turning some
interested students away.
In my opinion, the individual or
individuals responsible for acts de
scribed yesterday in The Daily deserve

no less than expulsion. We, black stu
dents, are a part of this community
and should not and will not be in
sulted and disrespected in our own
,home. We will do what we see fit to
preserve our rights and our dignity.
