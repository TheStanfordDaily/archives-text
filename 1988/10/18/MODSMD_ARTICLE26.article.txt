## Ask not what the U.S. can do for you Proposals for mandatory or expanded public service programs surface in Congress 
### Kim Grose 
Before moving into a dorm, an incoming
freshman dedicates time to building shelter
for the homeless. Before buying a meal card
that allows for unlimited consumption of
cafeteria food, a college student serves lines
of hungry people at a soup kitchen. Instead
of spending hundreds of dollars on textbooks,
a teenager takes a year off from school and
teaches illiterate adults how to read.
These scenarios might become true to life
if legislation now before Congress is enacted.
Currently, no fewer than six congressional
proposals call for mandatory or voluntary na
tional service. If any of these are enacted, the
government could require or strongly advise
all students to spend two years serving the
community or the nation.
What does national service mean? To many
it implies military service — the draft. But
in recent years, it has come to include a wide
range of services to public society.
For instance, tomorrow Sen. Sam Nunn,
along with Rep. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and
others will be here to outline their call for
the creation of a Citizen Corps and to encour
age students to ask questions about their plan.
The Citizen Corps is a program designed
essentially to expand the new enlistment bill
to include humanitarian service, encouraging
young people to give something back to the

United States by serving for one or two years
in either military or in civilian service.
Civilian service was expanded in the 19605,
and the Peace Corps and Volunteers in Service
to America were created to promote and ce
ment this new form of service — humanitarian
volunteerism. Today as the "Me Generation"
fades into social history, new calls for service
can be heard.
At Stanford, University President Donald
Kennedy has clearly manifested his advocacy
of individual responsibility to give something
back to one's community. His words have
been heard and proven in the exponential
growth of the Public Service Center.
Those who advocate an American national
service program argue that encouraging serv
ice in conservation corps, urban youth corps
and volunteer organizations helping the el
derly, the disabled and the impoverished can
save the government money in the long run.
Volunteers can accomplish much-needed work
without draining huge government sums.
Additionally, a national public service pro
gram would elevate the rank of social work
from its recent level of secondary, sideline
importance in American life, according to adv
ocates. Young people's efforts would yield use
ful results, generate self-confidence and pro
vide them with valuable job skills for the
future, many say.
Presently, a consensus of agreement in

Washington, D.C. and nationwide about the
worth and need to more aggressively encour
age young people and senior citizens to vol
unteer is finding its way into public view.
The question is how to enact the theories
for public service. Should a program be man
datory as in many European countries, or
should it be voluntary? Would such service
include civilian as well as military service?
"Within the balance .. . between individual
liberty and social responsibility, self-reliance
and cooperation, private interest and public
duty ... lies the essential meaning of citizen
ship," states a report issued last spring by
the Democratic Leadership Council, a group
of the Democratic Party chaired by Sen. Nunn.
The report, entitled "Citizenship and Na
tional Service," aimed to reawaken a national
spirit of socially active citizenship.
In return for each year of service, they
would receive living expenses and a voucher
worth $10,000 ($12,000 for military work) to
be used for college tuition, vocational training
or the down-payment on a house.
Some information and insight about the
objectives of Nunn's plan, before they are
presented on Wednesday by Nunn and
Mikulski, may enrich the understanding and
evaluation of the proposals.
The following are some issues meriting at-

tention when learning about pro
posals for national service, high
lighted by representatives of
public service at Stanford and
culled from research on these top
ics in Washington, D.C. this sum
mer.
• Establishing a national serv
ice program right now would in
itially cost the government, before
it paid for itself. For example, the
creation of a Citizen Corps would
cost the U.S. government $6 bil
lion. Is it currently wise to spend
this amount of money while we
are trying to reduce the deficit
make budget cuts?
• There is a bill in Congress
right now, sponsored by Reps.
Morris Udall, D-Utah, and Leon
Panneta, D-Calif., that would sup
port state and local youth service
programs as well as create an
American Conservation Corps.
The Panetta-Udall Bill has al
ready held hearings, been ap
proved unanimously by the Em
ployment Opportunities Sub-
Committee, and will be on the
House floor for a vote in January.
It would cost the government $180
million.
How does the Panetta-Udall al
ternative compare with the Citi
zen Corp..?

•An issue that directly con
cerns many college students is fi
nancial aid. Nunn's plan would
replace current federal grants and
loans with vouchers based on
service. In other words, financial
aid for college students would be
contingent upon participation in
the Citizen Corps.
What implications does this
have in terms of limiting the scope
of participation in the Corps? For
instance, would it become a re
quirement only for the middle
class or poor wishing to go to
college and needing financial aid?
• As an alternative to Nunn's
plan for Citizen Corps participa
tion to take place between high
school and college, Sen. Claiborne
Pell, D-R.1., and Rep. Constance
Morella, R-Md., have introduced
a proposal to Congress that would
provide college tuition for stu
dents who commit to Peace Corps
service upon graduation, similar
to the function ROTC serves for
the military.
• Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.,
and Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.,
are sponsoring a proposal in the
House and Senate to publicize an
already existing program under
which college graduates working
full-time in public service can
defer their loan payments. In ad
dition, they have introduced a new
measure to partially forgive loan
repayment in exchange for service.
