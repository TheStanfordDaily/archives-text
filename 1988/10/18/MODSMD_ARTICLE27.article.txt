# The
						Bug seeks reader interrogation stiffer than the CIA
## 
### Mark Smoyer Staff writer 
Of late, there have been many
questions concerning the stench
which wafts out of vents around
the center of campus. The Bug
suspects that the odor has been
intentionally created by Univer
sity officials to discourage any un
sightly homeless types from
seeking the vents' warmth at
night and ruining the idyllic at
mosphere of our well-sheltered
community.
The aroma did serve a purpose
for many students on Friday as a
welcome excuse to skip what
seniors find the most frightening
event of the year, the Career
Faire.
For humanities students, the
spelling of the occasion's title is
symbolic of a fact they figured
out Friday if they hadn't already
known: Spelling doesn't count,
and neither do the liberal arts.
Booths demanding anything other
than a merciless capitalistic busi
ness sense or the ability to do
problem sets were few and far
between.
The only company table happy
with the rottin' stink of the Plaza

was Upjohn. As the makers of
Kaopectate, they were exceedingly
comfortable with the atmosphere
and passing job hunters who did
not cringe as they passed over a
vent were signed to a lifetime con
tract.
Other Career Faire news in
volved the CIA table. A couple

Bug disciples confronted the rep
resentatives, asking for an expla
nation concerning the organiza
tion's involvement in such
nefarious activities as government
overthrows and heroin traffick
ing. Of course, the investigators
were brushed off diplomatically.
While the CIA people began pre
paring plastic explosives to fur
ther deter the Bug disciples, the
Bug himself brought up more
serious charges. Unable to evade
his wily line of questioning, the
poor saps admitted that the CIA
is indeed responsible for brain
washing the American youth into
believing that nonfat milk is good
for you, while whole milk is not.
Meanwhile, some of you young
'uns seem to be a little confused
concerning the Bug. Yes, the ques
tions have been sent in by actual
readers. Yes, most of the answers
are factual ("Stairway to Heaven"
really does transmit that Satanic
message when played backwards).
Yes, parts of the column are sup
posed to be humorous. Yes, they
usually aren't. Yes, I have the
grammatical propriety of a dead
shrew.
Letters of disgust can be
dropped off in the Bug Me box

just inside the Daily offices, or
can be sent via the Lots letter
service to B.bug-me.
Dear Bug,
Does Stanford have an official
policy of admitting twins together?
â€” Castor and Pollux
Now, that's a good question.
Imagine the possibile plot twists
of a latter-day Greek tragedy in
which one twin was admitted
while his (used not as a generic
pronoun but because the Bug is
a male chauvinist) sibling was not.
If you thought Medea was jealous,
how do you think your typically
neurotic suburban overachiever
would feel if his ne'er-do-well but
naturally talented twin was ac
cepted to the Farm but he was
not?
Or perhaps, if earnest Mr.
Diligence got admitted while in
souciant Mr. Brilliant did not,
then what? Perhaps Mr. Brilliant
wouldn't even bother applying,
confident that his brother would
get in and then could be easily
disposed of. Upon replacing his
twin, Mr. Brilliant would have
gained admission to one of the
nation's elite universities without
even applying.
In light of these alarming poten

tialities, you might think the Ad
missions Office had an unwritten
rule of admitting both twins as
long as one was qualified and the
other was close. Well, the fact is,
you'd do just as well thinking that
the alluring classmate you've had
your eye on has any idea who you
are. And besides, what's your eye
doing out of its socket?

Then again, there are
cases when the de
fendant pleads insani
ty. Not to mention
cases where valuable
museum pieces are
on display.

Bill Tingley, an associate dean
of Admissions, told the Bug that
twins are considered as individ
uals, not as "a package deal." The
Admissions officers are careful to
be conscious that twins are ap
plying so as to avoid application
material confusion, but no special
consideration is given beyond the

degree given to every applicant.
Atypical family situations are a
factor in the process of consider
ing twins just as anything atypical
about any applicant would be a
factor. Thus, Tingley said Admis
sions people understand the
gravity of a situation where they
admit one but deny the other. "We
want to be absolutely sure in our
own minds of our decision when
we do that," he said.
There is no historical trend in
this area. Some twins have both
been admitted. Some have not
only both been denied admittance
to Stanford, but also to Santa
Monica Community College and
the Andover Tractor/Trailer
School.
There are also cases where one
twin got in, but the other did not.
And, regrettably, there have been
cases where Mr. Diligence got into
Stanford only to be killed by his
brother. Then again, there are
cases where the defendant pleads
insanity. Not to mention cases
where valuable museum pieces
are on display. And who the Heck
keeps underwear in a briefcase
anyways?
Until next week, the Bug has
spoken.
