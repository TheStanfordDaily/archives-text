## 'Optimistic' Card prepares for OSU 
### Chris Crader Senior staff writer 
It's controlled optimism as usual.
Yesterday's football press conference dis
played, once again, a happy-but- not-yet
satisfied Cardinal Coach Jack Elway.
Happy? Sure. His team posted its most
impressive victory of the season Saturday,
controlling Arizona State 24-3. "I think,
execution-wise, it had to be the finest foot
ball game we've played to date," Elway said.
Not-yet-satisfied. Always. "There are
things we need to work on," he said.
"(Oregon State, this week's opponent) is a
much-improved football team. It'll be a
heck of a challenge."
The Cardinal got its first win in Pacific
10 Conference play Saturday and is now
3-3 overall, 1-2 in the Pac-10. After being
idle this past week, Oregon State is also
3-3, 1-2.
The Beavers have been known as a big
offensive football team the past few years
for two reasons. One, senior quarterback
Erik Wilhelm has been able to put a lot
of points on the board with great consis
tency since being named the starter midway
through his freshman season.
Two, the Beavers' defense did little to
steal the limelight from the offense. Things
have changed this year, however, as the
Beavers are giving up only 23.8 points per
game, a great improvement over the past
few years.
"(OSU's defense) did an excellent job
against UCLA in not letting them over
power them with the running game," El
way said. "I don't think we've faced any
defense this year with as much variety of
movement they have — and execution."
While OSU did not upset the second
ranked Bruins in their last outing two
week 3 ago, the Beavers kept it closer (38-
21) than Nebraska did against UCLA.
After fine performances on both offense
and defense in the team's initial Pac-10
win last week, however, the Cardinal ap
pears ready to meet the challenge.
"If we continue to improve, and continue
to take it day-to-day and week- to-week
we'll let the results take care of them
selves," Elway said.
One of the reasons for the Cardinal's
midseason resurgence, aside from getting
a short break from top-20 opponents, is
the return of tight end Jim Price. After
missing much of the Cardinal's first five
games with a pulled hamstring and a
bruised knee, Price caught three passes for
33 yards and a touchdown Saturday.
While quarterback Jason Palumbis was
completing 72 percent of his passes, Price
made two great catches while slotback
Chris Walsh added one of his own to the
highlight film.
"I thought Jason Palumbis played an
outstanding game," Elway said, adding "He
was helped by two fine catches by Jim

Price and one by Walsh."
The missing man this season is finally
making his presence felt.
"I've never been hurt before," Price said.
"It's really tough when you can't help out
the team."
Price was a pitcher on the 1987 NCAA
Champion Stanford baseball team, and was
on this year's team but quit to concentrate
on football and spring practice.
He then missed out on last year's repeat
NCAA title, but things were going very
well for him football-wise. After playing
behind former New England Patriot starter
Greg Baty, and then Eric Snelson, who
started at linebacker for the Los Angeles
Raiders in their first game this year, Price
was going to be the starter.
"I worked hard all summer," he said.
Then, the day before the first day of prac
tice, Price pulled his hamstring running
the first of ten 40-yard dashes.
"It hasn't been a storybook career for
me here at Stanford," he said. But he
doesn't regret his decision.
"I'd love to go out there and pitch," he
said, "but I wasn't one of those guys who
could sit on the bench and chew tobacco
for the other six days."
Price's nuyor claim to fame, other than
having seven touchdown receptions already
(including two this season in very limited
playing time), is his ability to throw a
football. "Freshman year I had a bet with
John Paye that I could throw it 80 yards,"
he said, "but I threw two (dead) ducks and
lost the bet. ... I wish they had punt, pass
and kick for guys my age."
On a more serious note, Price feels
"this'll probably be the first week I'm 100
percent." The Beavers better look out.
Although the Cardinal is currently only
a .500 football team, a few players have
allowed themselves the luxury of at least
considering a bowl berth (?!?). That thought
is not too far out of line with the proper
scenario.
It goes like this: Stanford beats Oregon
State and Washington State at home and
wins Big Game at Berkeley. The Cardinal
also upsets either Washington or UCLA
on the road.
Possible? Well, Stanford has beaten the
Bruins the last two times the teams have
met in Pasadena. And Washington is only
ranked 16th in the nation.
Probable? Well, who can tell? "We're the
type of team that could beat anybody,"
Price said, "or if we get down could lose
to anybody. We gotta keep working hard,
playing hard."
Card notes
After causing five turnovers Saturday and
giving up only one, Stanford is now fifth in the
nation in turnover margin, averaging plus 2.0
per game. Oregon State is seventh nationally in
that statistic (and second to the Cardinal in the
Pac-10) at plus 1.83 per game.
