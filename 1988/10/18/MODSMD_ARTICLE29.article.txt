# Don't knock L.A. fans
## 
### 
The squad that probably will
be remembered as the best Stan
ford men's basketball team of
the century, due to an unfortu
nate bit of scheduling, could be
playing its biggest home game
of the year with almost no stu
dent support.

The Cardinal, ranked 19th by
The Sporting News in its
preseason issue, hosts Arizona
in a rematch of last year's
Miracle at Maples on January
5, 1989 — during winter vaca
tion.
That means it's going to take
a certain kind of fan to end va
cation early, arrive on campus
with student housing closed, and
make Maples rock again.
It's going to take the kind of
fans you find in Los Angeles.
Don't stop reading. I know
people joke a lot about An
geles fans. People make lots of
jokes about Los Angeles.
Tinseltown, they call it.
Freeway shootings. Valley Girls.
And most often, the smog. But
that's all blown way out of pro
portion.
Sure, I read a study that said
the smog in Los Angeles is going
to cut two years of my life. But
that's one of those nebulous sta
tistics without much real value,
like "I would have done better
on that exam had I studied
more."
It's the same story with the
constant derision of Los Angeles
sports fans.
So I'm told, we all arrive in

the second inning, quarter, or
period of a given contest, com
pare tans for an hour and then
leave.
This is true, but only to a
small extent.
The thing is, though, our
spectatorial attributes can at
times be good ones to have. Here
are a couple of examples to il
lustrate why.
The value of arriving late
A few years back, my family
goes to see the Dodgers play the
Reds. Game time, 7:35 p.m.
Now, my Dad doesn't really
like to fight the traffic. So in
stead of leaving at 6:30 to arrive
at 7:20, we leave at 7:15 and
arrive at around 7:37 or so. It's
possible we may have sped.
When we get to the gate, the
Reds' leadoff batter (I think it
was Gary Redus) has already
doubled off Dodger starter Jerry
Reuss. The first thing we see
is Reuss giving up a grounder
to the right side, which moves
Redus to third. A sacrifice fly
then scores him, and the Reds
have the lead, 1-0.
Reuss gets the next batter out
to end the inning. In fact, he
gets the next 24 batters out.
So, while the fan who arrived
on time only saw the Dodgers
win 11-1, the three of us saw
Reuss pitch a perfect game.
The value of leaving early
It was opening day of the 1983
NFL season, and I go with two
friends to a Raiders game that
is so memorable I can't recall
who they played or whether they
won.
We leave in the middle of the
fourth quarter. Take note: My
friend's car stereo was stolen
while we were in the Coliseum.
This probably wouldn't have
happened if we had left after
the first quarter.
But that's paranoia. Suffice
it to say, we get home just in
time to see the end of the
Dodgers-Braves game, a key

game in the National League
West race.
The Dodgers, down 6-3, score
four in the bottom of the ninth
to win 7-6. The winning run
came home on a squeeze bunt
by current Pirate outfielder R.J.
Reynolds, a bunt that to this
day makes him my favorite non-
Dodger in baseball.
But, I digress. If we hadn't
left the Raiders game early, we
might have missed seeing the
winning run. If we had gone to
the Dodger game, we might also
have missed it — because we
might have left that game early.
The moral? No, it's not stay
home and watch everything on
television. It's that missing part
of a game is okay — if it's done
judiciously.
Don't be deceived by those
shots on Game of the Week of
us leaving 10-0 games in the
seventh inning. We're just
saving ourselves. The Dodgers
sell 27,000 season tickets an
nually. When it's 10-0 in the
seventh, it's time to get some
sleep.
Truthfully, Los Angeles
sports fans have virtually mas
tered the art of timing in arriv
ing and leaving sporting events.
Now, my father, the same guy
who usually arrives a little late
for Dodger games, arrived at
World Series Game 2 Sunday
two hours before it started, and
stayed to the end.
A clutch performer, just like
Kirk Gibson.
For Stanford students, there
won't be a situation needing a
clutch performance more than
the Stanford-Arizona game Jan.
5 — during winter vacation.
Somehow, someway, I'm
going to be on campus early.
And I'm from Tinseltown.
