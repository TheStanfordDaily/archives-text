## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
As residents of Ujamaa House
struggle to come to terms with
the two racial incidents that re
cently struck their house, Univer
sity Provost James Rosse has
launched an investigation to de
termine if two students who
posted a racially offensive flier in
Ujamaa violated the Fundamental
Standard.
Black University administra
tors and other "good friends of
the black community" visited the
black theme house at dinner Sun
day night, and several residential
deans met with Ujamaa residents
at lunch yesterday, according to
Ujamaa resident assistants Kim
Coleman and Rachel Wiesen.
"There's been a tremendous
amount of support," Coleman
said. "One of the best things that
could happen was to see some
faces of people who care."
Ujamaa residence staff still do
not know who wrote the word
"Niggers" across a poster and
posted it in Ujamaa House.
In a letter to the editor released
yesterday, University President
Donald Kennedy expressed

"distress and disappointment"
over the events at Ujamaa.
"I hope that all of us can try
to say to them (members of the

black communi
ty), even though
it may be too late
for comfort, that
such behavior is
not an acceptable
part of our cul
ture here, but an
intolerable aber
ration; and that
we are committed

to helping them repair the
damage," he wrote.
Rosse met yesterday morning
with Ujamaa residence staff "to
hear from them what had oc
curred, to hear their assessment
of how serious the shock on the
residents had been, and to discuss
how to help the residents get
through this serious period," ac
cording to Rosse.
In addition, a meeting was held
late last night between members
of the Black Student Union and
University administrators.
Among those present were Ken
nedy, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas, Dean

of Undergraduate Studies Tom
Wasow, Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Jean Fetter, as well
as a number of other staff mem
bers. The first part of the meeting
was open, the second was closed
to the press.
As a result of the racist inci
dents at Ujamaa, the question of
who should live in theme houses
across the campus has again be
come a major topic of debate
within the University.
Wiesen said a lot of people in
the Ujamaa community feel that
there are some students "who
don't want to be here."
A number of current freshmen
residents at Ujamaa did not ex
press a preference to live in the
black theme house and some up
perclass black students who asked
to live there were not housed at
Ujamaa, according to Asst. Dean
of Residential Education Alice
Supton.
"Theme houses can be powerful
learning experiences for the
people not of the ethnicity of the
theme," Supton said, explaining
the University's reason for the
ethnic diversity within theme
