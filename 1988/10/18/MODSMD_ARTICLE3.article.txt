# University begins inquiry into 2 Ujamaa incidents
## 
### Brad Hayward Staff writer 
As residents of Ujamaa House
struggle to come to terms with
the two racial incidents that re
cently struck their house, Univer
sity Provost James Rosse has
launched an investigation to de
termine if two students who
posted a racially offensive flier in
Ujamaa violated the Fundamental
Standard.
Black University administra
tors and other "good friends of
the black community" visited the
black theme house at dinner Sun
day night, and several residential
deans met with Ujamaa residents
at lunch yesterday, according to
Ujamaa resident assistants Kim
Coleman and Rachel Wiesen.
"There's been a tremendous
amount of support," Coleman
said. "One of the best things that
could happen was to see some
faces of people who care."
Ujamaa residence staff still do
not know who wrote the word
"Niggers" across a poster and
posted it in Ujamaa House.
In a letter to the editor released
yesterday, University President
Donald Kennedy expressed

"distress and disappointment"
over the events at Ujamaa.
"I hope that all of us can try
to say to them (members of the

black communi
ty), even though
it may be too late
for comfort, that
such behavior is
not an acceptable
part of our cul
ture here, but an
intolerable aber
ration; and that
we are committed

to helping them repair the
damage," he wrote.
Rosse met yesterday morning
with Ujamaa residence staff "to
hear from them what had oc
curred, to hear their assessment
of how serious the shock on the
residents had been, and to discuss
how to help the residents get
through this serious period," ac
cording to Rosse.
In addition, a meeting was held
late last night between members
of the Black Student Union and
University administrators.
Among those present were Ken
nedy, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Ewart Thomas, Dean

of Undergraduate Studies Tom
Wasow, Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions Jean Fetter, as well
as a number of other staff mem
bers. The first part of the meeting
was open, the second was closed
to the press.
As a result of the racist inci
dents at Ujamaa, the question of
who should live in theme houses
across the campus has again be
come a major topic of debate
within the University.
Wiesen said a lot of people in
the Ujamaa community feel that
there are some students "who
don't want to be here."
A number of current freshmen
residents at Ujamaa did not ex
press a preference to live in the
black theme house and some up
perclass black students who asked
to live there were not housed at
Ujamaa, according to Asst. Dean
of Residential Education Alice
Supton.
"Theme houses can be powerful
learning experiences for the
people not of the ethnicity of the
theme," Supton said, explaining
the University's reason for the
ethnic diversity within theme


Rosse
houses.
Because Kennedy had expected
to be away from campus yesterday
on a brief business trip, Rosse
called for the investigation in his
role as acting president.
The results of the investigation
will eventually be turned over to
the Judicial Affairs Office, where
a recommendation will be made
about what action should be
taken, according to Rosse.
Background
The series of events began Oct.
1 when a flier crudely depicting
Beethoven as a black man was
found on a chalkboard next to the
door of Ujamaa resident B.J. Kerr.
A poster advertising a black fra
ternity party was discovered in
Ujamaa on Oct. 14 with the word
"Niggers" written across it.
Although the Ujamaa residence

staff has retained both the flier
and the poster, they decided not
to release the flier for publication.
The staff issued a statement,
explaining that "any black and
white photographic reproduction
of the Beethoven flier would not
accurately depict the grotesquely
offensive nature of the flier, nor
would it do justice to the highly
sensitive, demoralizing nature of
the issue."
The discovery of the second pos
ter prompted the staff to call a
dorm meeting to discuss the two
racially motivated events.
During this meeting, an
Ujamaa resident privately told the
residence staff she had overheard
a conversation plotting the defac
ing of the flier. As a result, the
staff confronted Naranja fresh
man Gus Heldt about his role in
the incident. Heldt, from Van
couver, Canada, admitted that he
and Ujamaa freshman Ben
Dugan, from Glen Ellyn, Illinois,
had altered the flier.
At a noon meeting of Ujamaa

and Naranja residents and staff
Sunday, Dugan and Heldt publicly
admitted to having defaced the
flier, but said they were not re
sponsible for marking the second
poster.
Dugan and Heldt were removed
from their Lagunita residences
Sunday and have gone into seclu
sion. The residence staff at
Ujamaa would not say where they
are now. The two students have
not commented on the incidents
since they released a statement
about the events early Monday
morning.
Alleged physical threat
According to Wiesen, many res
idents considered the two men's
apology insincere and "per
functory."
According to the residence staff,
frustration over the apology in
creased the emotional pitch of the
meeting until the residence staff
removed Dugan and Heldt from
the room and the meeting broke
up amidst what Coleman called
"hysteria."

Some were struck by the per
ceived danger of the moment.
In a statement released early
Monday morning, Dugan and
Heldt said that Dugan "was as
saulted by 8.J." at the meeting,
and "there was minimal contact."
Coleman said "there was no
physical contact" between Kerr,
Dugan and Heldt.
Last night Naranja freshman
Sean Bennett, who attended the
Sunday meeting, said Kerr phys
ically threatened Dugan. Bennett
said Kerr, who was standing a
few feet behind Dugan, raised his
fist, moved toward Dugan and
said, "I'm gonna kill you, punk."
Kerr was not available for com
ment last night.
Bennett added that someone
then grabbed Kerr's arm and
pulled him to the side, but Kerr
got up and it took several people
to control him.
This description of events was
corroborated by Naranja junior
Jim Spencer, who also attended
the meeting Sunday.

Repercussions
Ujamaa residence staff said the
administration will now have to
face, with renewed urgency, many
questions about racism on
campus.
"Last year people said that the
BSU was always crying wolf â€”
but racism does exist," said
Maurice Rabb, head academic ad
viser at Ujamaa.
He added that "bigotry is not
out, as Donald Kennedy said it is."
The issue of turning Ujamaa
into an all-black house has been
refueled as a result of the recent
incidents.
"Between having the status o,uo
and having Ujamaa an all-black
dorm, I think we'll end up some
where in the middle," Wiesen said.
"I'm leaning more toward
Ujamaa being an all-black dorm,"
Coleman said. "That's the pur
pose: This is the one place where
we (black students) should be able
to be who we are. For the future,
it's a consideration of a lot of
people, that a lot of problems

wouldn't ensue from people living
here who don't want to be here.
A lot of people are here because
they drew poorly or wanted a
single."
However, Coleman said she
doesn't feel any such changes
should be made in Ujamaa's res
idence policy this year.-"I don't
want the people here now who
aren't black to be out; they're a
part of our family," she said.
Ujamaa residence staff mem
bers also said the incidents dem
onstrate that the University needs
to play a larger role in educating
the Stanford community about
racism, instead of placing all the
burden on the members of the
ethnic communities.
Some said these events, and last
spring's Otero incident, indicate
that the campus is fraught with
ignorance at best and racism at
worst towards minorities at Stan
ford.
In May, seven members of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity unin
tentionally evoked images of the
Ku Klux Klan when they donned
masks and carried candles during
a silent vigil they staged to protest
the University's treatment of a
student accused of homophobic
and belligerent behavior in his
dorm.
