# Cross country crushes Cal
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Stanford men's cross coun
try team is on a roll. Ranked ninth
in the country by the NCAA, the
Cardinal kept a season-long win
ning streak alive by crushing Cal
ifornia by 33 points at home yes
terday.
The Cardinal runners were con
fident and ran a strong race. Run
ning a four-mile course, the few
Cal runners who were in conten
tion folded down the backstretch.
The men won their third compe
tition in a row, putting five men
ahead of Berkeley's first finisher.
"Stanford has an excellent team
this year and did an outstanding
job out there," conceded Cal
Coach Jack Marsden. "Stanford
seems to be the dominant team
in the league this year."
Northwestern transfer Steve
Miller led the Stanford attack.
Running his third race wearing
the Cardinal colors, Miller placed
first in 19 minutes, 26.3 seconds.
Stanford Assistant Track Coach
Scott Chisam was satisfied with
his runners' performances, espe
cially Miller's. "He was a very
good runner at Northwestern,"
Chisam said. "I'm pleased but not
really surprised at (the win)."
This year there has been no
established placing order on the
Cardinal squad, with different
runners picking up the slack at
different times. This day was ob
viously Miller's. "We were all
going for the win," said Miller.
"About the two-and-a-half mile
mark I made a break. I was sur
prised when nobody went with me,
but in two weeks we'll have a new
number one man."
The Cardinal crew has followed
a simple route to success — racing
to the front and holding a tight
formation to the finish line. Cal
went out fast at the start, but by
the one-mile mark had started
dropping back. By the time they
hit the line, Cal's fourth and fiflh
runners were twelve men behind
Miller.
Stanford junior Mark Mastalir

was the second finisher, followed
by captain James Alborough, Eric
Mastalir, and Dave Scudamore.
All five of the top Stanford fin
ishers averaged under five
minutes per mile over the golf
course loop. When the places of
each team's top five finishers
were added, Stanford was just two
places away from a complete
sweep.
The Cardinal was expected to
win, and with good reason. Cal
even pulled out its top runner,
Calvin Gaziano, with what

Marsden called "a slight muscle
strain." Even with Gaziano, how
ever, the best they could have
done was finish 21 points out. As
it was, they conceded the race
before the gun went off and lost
by a score of 15-48.
Scoring in cross-country races
is figured by taking a team's top
seven runners and adding the
places of its top five runners.
Thus, even with Gaziano, the best

Dave Scudamore placed fifth for the Cardinal yesterday, but still
finished ahead of the entire Cal squad.
