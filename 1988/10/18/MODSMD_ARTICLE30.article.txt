# Cross country crushes Cal
## 
### Ed Pike Staff writer 
The Stanford men's cross coun
try team is on a roll. Ranked ninth
in the country by the NCAA, the
Cardinal kept a season-long win
ning streak alive by crushing Cal
ifornia by 33 points at home yes
terday.
The Cardinal runners were con
fident and ran a strong race. Run
ning a four-mile course, the few
Cal runners who were in conten
tion folded down the backstretch.
The men won their third compe
tition in a row, putting five men
ahead of Berkeley's first finisher.
"Stanford has an excellent team
this year and did an outstanding
job out there," conceded Cal
Coach Jack Marsden. "Stanford
seems to be the dominant team
in the league this year."
Northwestern transfer Steve
Miller led the Stanford attack.
Running his third race wearing
the Cardinal colors, Miller placed
first in 19 minutes, 26.3 seconds.
Stanford Assistant Track Coach
Scott Chisam was satisfied with
his runners' performances, espe
cially Miller's. "He was a very
good runner at Northwestern,"
Chisam said. "I'm pleased but not
really surprised at (the win)."
This year there has been no
established placing order on the
Cardinal squad, with different
runners picking up the slack at
different times. This day was ob
viously Miller's. "We were all
going for the win," said Miller.
"About the two-and-a-half mile
mark I made a break. I was sur
prised when nobody went with me,
but in two weeks we'll have a new
number one man."
The Cardinal crew has followed
a simple route to success — racing
to the front and holding a tight
formation to the finish line. Cal
went out fast at the start, but by
the one-mile mark had started
dropping back. By the time they
hit the line, Cal's fourth and fiflh
runners were twelve men behind
Miller.
Stanford junior Mark Mastalir

was the second finisher, followed
by captain James Alborough, Eric
Mastalir, and Dave Scudamore.
All five of the top Stanford fin
ishers averaged under five
minutes per mile over the golf
course loop. When the places of
each team's top five finishers
were added, Stanford was just two
places away from a complete
sweep.
The Cardinal was expected to
win, and with good reason. Cal
even pulled out its top runner,
Calvin Gaziano, with what

Marsden called "a slight muscle
strain." Even with Gaziano, how
ever, the best they could have
done was finish 21 points out. As
it was, they conceded the race
before the gun went off and lost
by a score of 15-48.
Scoring in cross-country races
is figured by taking a team's top
seven runners and adding the
places of its top five runners.
Thus, even with Gaziano, the best

Dave Scudamore placed fifth for the Cardinal yesterday, but still
finished ahead of the entire Cal squad.
Cal could have done was shorten
the deficit to 21 points.
Running a shortened version of
the Pacific 10 Conference course,
the Stanford squad ran the same
target pace they hope to maintain
through the championship season.
Stanford's women's team did
not race Monday, and the Pac-10
Championships will be their first
race in a month. While junior
Carol Gray continues to be a force
anytime she races, the women are
going through a rebuilding year
under Track and Field Director
Brooks Johnson. They have made
the addition of freshmen Jodie
Bilotta and Jeannie Heltzel and
will be much stronger with an
other year of experience.
The women are in roughly the
same condition the men were in
last year, and hopefully will be
able to make the transition from

raw potential into racing perform
ance by the end of the season.
With the men's victory, Chisam
added another impressive notch
to his first season at the helm
after serving as assistant coach
for two years. Steve Schadler was
the only runner lost from last
season, and the team has finally
gotten the performance it needs
to dominate its competition.
"We've had more potential," ac
cording to Mastalir, but this looks
like the year the Cardinals have
gotten rolling. Chisam concurs,
"We've been working together for
a few years and everything came
together."
This was the first year for the
Stanford-Cal dual meet, which
comes halfway between the Stan
ford Invitational and the Pacific
10 Championship meet, also held
at Stanford.
"Every time we compete
against Cal there is an extra in
centive," Chisam said. "A couple
years from now it will be a closer

rivalry. They have a new coach
and a new program."
Chisam is cautious about the
rest of the season, but has the
guns to win the Pac-10 and the
District-8 Championship meets
this year.
