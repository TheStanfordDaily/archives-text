# Golfers in fourth place
## Cevaer in 3rd individually after 'unbelievable' day 
### 
Even though fall is technically the off-season for
golf, the Stanford men's golf team has been quite
busy on the invitational tournament circuit thus
far this quarter.
In Stockton yesterday, the team finished the first
day of play at the Robertson Homes/University of
Pacific Invitational tied for fourth place. The Car
dinal's team score of 578 strokes left it five behind
leader Fresno State.
San Jose State finished the day in second with
575 strokes, followed by Oregon State at 577 and
Stanford, Nevada-Reno and Pacific one more shot
back.
The teams played 36 holes yesterday and will play
the final 18 holes this morning.
Cardinal freshman Christian Cevaer led the team

with rounds of 69-71. His 140 total left him in
third place overall, just three shots back of the
leader.
"Christian did really well," Stanford Coach Wally
Goodwin said. "That (third place) is just unbeliev
able for a freshman."
Stanford's Mark Funseth had the second-best
score on the squad, posting a 145 total. Josh Sander
was right on Funseth's heels with a 146, followed
by Don Christensen at 149 and Brad Joondeph at
153.
Goodwin was extremely impressed with the team's
play. "We did a fine job today," he said. "This is
by far the best effort these guys have had this year,
and it's against some pretty tough schools — this
is a strong field."
