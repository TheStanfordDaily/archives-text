# Hershiser reigns supreme

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Orel
Hershiser's parents threw out
the first ball for Game 2 of the
World Series and their son
threw the last.
The Orel aura was all over
Dodger Stadium on Sunday
night.
Hershiser threw a three
hitter and went 3-for-3 with a
run batted in as Los Angeles
beat Oakland 6-0 to take a 2-0
lead in the Series.
Hershiser's parents, Orel 111
and Millie, were honored before
Game 2 for their contributions
to Little League. It wasn't so
long ago that the Hershisers
were driving their son to games
and sweating with every pitch.
"We snuck him in (Little
League) as a 7-year-old and
found when he was 9 his eyes
weren't so good," Orel's dad
said.
Hershiser's eyes were just
fine in Game 2 as he became
the first pitcher since Art Nehf
of the 1924 New York Giants
to get three hits in a World Se
ries game.
"I don't pride myself on my
hitting," Orel Hershiser IV said.
"But it's lots of fun."
To carry on the Hershiser tra
dition of excellence, there is Orel
Hershiser V, the pitcher's 4-
year-old son.
"He's a Dodger fan but I'm
not sure what position he'll play
yet," Orel IV said.
Hershiser's pitching since the
beginning of September has
been a combination of Cy
Young, Walter Johnson and
Sandy Koufax all rolled into one.
And the scary part is he has
been even better than anything

that trio ever accomplished.
It's the Orel aura.
Hershiser made four appear
ances in the National League
playoffs against New York and
pitched a shutout in Game 7 to
beat the Mets 6-0 after picking
up a save in Game 4. He has
now pitched 19 and one-third
consecutive scoreless innings in
the playoffs and is the only
player ever to throw shutouts
in the playoffs and World Series.
"Orel is just on a different
level right now," Dodger right
fielder Mike Marshall said.
"When we take the field with
Orel on the mound we feel we
can't be beat."
It's the Orel aura.

Hershiser's pitching
since the beginning
of September has
been a combination
of Cy Young, Walter
Johnson and Sandy
Koufax all rolled into
one.

Hershiser finished the regu
lar season with a record 59 con
secutive scoreless innings and
has pitched seven shutouts in
his last 10 games. Hershiser has
pitched in five of the Dodgers'
first nine postseason games and
has a 0.80 earned-run average
over that stretch.
The Dodgers have played in
83 innings during the
postseason, and Hershiser has

pitched 33 and two-thirds of
them.
"It's just unbelievable what
he's accomplished," Dodger
manager Tommy Lasorda said.
"To continue that kind of pitch
ing for so long, under so much
pressure is just unreal."
It's not unreal, it's just the
Orel aura.
"I have never seen anybody
in all my years of baseball pitch
as well for so long," Lasorda
said.
It was the 97th shutout in
World Series play and the first
for a Dodger since Koufax beat
Minnesota 2-0 in Game 7 of the
1965 World Series.
"Orel pitched a masterful
game," Dodger catcher Mike
Scioscia said. "He had tremen
dous location and that really set
up all his pitches. To shut out
a lineup of that magnitude is a
tremendous feat. He was in con
trol all the way."
Hershiser, 23-8 during the
season, has been in control for
some time now.
He pitched five straight
shutouts in September and then
broke Don Drysdale's 20-year
mark of 58 straight shutout in
nings with 10 scoreless innings
against San Diego on Sept. 28.
In Game 1 of the playoffs
against the Mets, Hershiser
pitched eight more scoreless in
nings. In his last last 92 and
two-thirds innings, Hershiser
has allowed three earned runs
for a 0.29 ERA.
"I have seen a lot of great
pitching but never anything like
this," said Drysdale, a Hall of
Famer. "Orel is in total control."
