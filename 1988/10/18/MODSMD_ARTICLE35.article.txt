# ASSU gears up for 2nd year of straw polls
## 
### Ariane Hoy 
By the end of fall quarter, the
ASSU will again conduct their
student opinion straw poll — al
though the number of budgeted
polls has decreased from 13 to
nine.
Last year, the ASSU, under the
direction of the 1987-88 Council
of Presidents and poll coordinator
Patty Marby, piloted the first
ASSU straw polls. Conducted
seven times during the year, the
polls gauged student opinion on a

variety of issues ranging from
Western Culture and a Univer
sity-supported grape boycott to an
ASSU dry cleaning service.
Straw poll coordinator Mark
Lee, who said he personally feels
the polls are valuable for measur
ing student opinion, said he hopes
to increase the efficiency and ac
curacy of the process. The poll
lists will be compiled by computer,
not manually as they were in the
past, to save time.
More students, possibly 300,
will be sampled, and the pollsters

will be better trained. Pollsters
will improve interviewing tech
niques by learning to use the same
voice intonations and word
choices, according to Lee.
Lee said he hopes to "stream
line" the procedure and conduct
polls about once every three
weeks — three times each quarter.
Lee is meeting with professors,
specifically in the Statistics De
partment, in hopes of gaining
knowledge of poll reliability and
more faculty support of the pro
gram.

Although the Senate budget al
lowed for 13 polls last year, the
number was decreased this year
to nine because of financial con
straints. Only seven polls were ac
tually conducted last year.
However, polling can not get
underway until phone numbers
come out this November in the
Student Directory. These num
bers will then be transferred into
a computer for random access.
Survey questions for this year
will probably deal with academic
policy changes.
