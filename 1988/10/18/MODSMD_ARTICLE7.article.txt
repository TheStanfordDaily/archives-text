# Code violations drop again
## Annual Judicial Affairs report enumerates problems 
### DJ Berinstein Staff writer 
After a steady increase from 1982 to
1985, the number of student misconduct
cases dropped by six over the past two
years, according to a recent report released
by the Office of Student Affairs.
While the number of violations fell from
37 to 31 between the 1987-88 academic
year and the 1986-87 year, the pattern
over the last five years has shown a gradual
increase, Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole
said.
Released last week, the report sum
marizes the number of judicial cases, in
cluding Honor Code violations,
Fundamental Standard violations and
campus policy disruptions for last year.
According to Cole, the number of total
violations is expected to stabilize between
20 and 30.
Cole speculated that two factors might
have caused the increase in judicial charges
over the last five years:
"There may be less tolerance of cheating
at Stanford, and people may be reporting
it more," she said.
"There have also been more stories about
the Honor Code and the judicial process
which have given us a higher profile. There
is a higher awareness about these issues
due to this deliberately higher profile,"
Cole added.
The most common Honor Code violations
occurred in non-examination circum
stances, according to Cole. Violations in-

eluded plagiarism and illegal collaborations
on take-home exams and computer pro
grams.
"The guidelines about collaboration are
more problematic in the technical fields,"
Cole said. "The issue of a definition of
what kind of collaboration is allowed by
the instructor has been a problem. Some
students appear to be unaware of the limits
imposed by the instructor and do not intend
to violate the Honor Code."
This year the judicial process will change.
Volunteer faculty members will serve as
advisers to the Judicial Committee to help
Cole and others evaluate the strength of
evidence against the students.
She pointed out that the increasing use
of computers has presented the
Judicial Committee with a novel
set of problems. "Like medicine
and ethics, our computer technol
ogy is ahead of our ethics. We still
do not know what is acceptable
and what isn't," Cole said.
Of the cases filed, usually about
50 percent are heard by the Jud
icial Committee. Only two out of
the 21 students pleaded not guilty

when their cases were were heard
by the dean of Student Affairs.
If the student pleads guilty to
the charge, a case usually lasts
three to four weeks before a ver
dict is reached. When a student
pleads not guilty, cases last three
to five months and an off-campus
attorney intervenes.
Admitting that everyone makes
mistakes, Cole said, "We all have
a lot to learn, especially 18 to 21
year olds. Growing up is not easy."
Cole added that she is not sur
prised at what students do, but
is more concerned with how well

students cope with the mistakes
they have made.
According to Cole, there are typ
ically three categories of students:
those who only regret getting
caught; those who have really
learned and matured from their
mistakes; and those, making up
the msyority, who fall somewhere
in the middle.
Describing how a student
charged with an Honor Code or
Fundamental Standard violation
might act in her office, Cole said
"That's what the box of kleenex
is for."
