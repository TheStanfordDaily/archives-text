# Code violations drop again
## Annual Judicial Affairs report enumerates problems

After a steady increase from 1982 to
1985, the number of student misconduct
cases dropped by six over the past two
years, according to a recent report released
by the Office of Student Affairs.
While the number of violations fell from
37 to 31 between the 1987-88 academic

the instructor has been a problem. Some
students appear to be unaware of the limits
imposed by the instructor and do not intend
to violate the Honor Code."
This year the judicial process will change.
Volunteer faculty members will serve as
advisers to the Judicial Committee to help
Cole and others evaluate the strength of
evidence against the students.
