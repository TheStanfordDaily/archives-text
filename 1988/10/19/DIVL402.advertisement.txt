What To Do Before The Quake: (In The Home)
(An excerpt from "Quake Ready" for a complete copy, see attached order form or call Special Services,
3-9633)
There are many easy steps you can take to reduce earthquake hazards. Most require
only a little time, money, or practice, but a small investment now can really pay off
when the quake hits.
IN THE HOME... /|1 r -^-
• brace and secure all heavy objects. ' '
• relocate beds away from shelves and windows.
• identify nearby fire extinguishers, and know at least two exits from your residence
BEING IN AN EARTHQUAKE IS EASY. REMEMBER THESE TIPS...
If you rein a building, stay there! Take cover under a heavy desk or table, or
brace yourself in a doorway, where the builing structure is stronger.
If you re outside, stay there! Move to an open space away from buildings and
power lines.
• Stay calm! Panic kills.
A Safety and Security Resource Center...
