Welcome, to the first edition of the ASSU News! Jusk like every other updated and revamped product on the market,
the ASSU News is new and improved. In what way? you ask. Well for one thing, I'm the new editor. We also have a
new COP, with a new slate of mind and a lot of great ideas; one that wants to get you involved. All of us at the Office
of Public Affairs want to get the COP's and the rest of the ASSU's message out to you, so please stay tuned to the
ASSU News every other Wednesday (or else I just may be out of a job soon)! Hopefully, you'll soon find out that
there's a lot more to the ASSU than just FLICKS!
