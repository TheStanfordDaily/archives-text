How can you get involved in
"Taking Action for Our Future?"
• Committee on Democracy in Education —
We have a right and responsibility to make our education more inclusive,
democratic and relevant; students have been and will continue to be on the
cutting edge of educational reform in this nation. Work in coalition with the
BSU, MEChA, AASA and SAIO on issues like developing Ethnic Studies
programs, increasing Financial Aid, and hiring more minority faculty.
Committee meetings are at the ASSU on Tuesdays at 6 pm.
• Student Labor Support Coalition Open Forum -
Are your worried about a strike? Wondering why the workers are so upset? We
are calling for a campus-wide open forum between representatives of the
administration and the United Stanford Workers (USW), but the
administration has so far refused to speak at the same forum as USW. Help us
get signatures for our "open forum" petition, so students can find out what's
really going on.
• ASSU Dorm Representative —
We want to know what students in your dorm think about campus issues and
new ASSU projects. You can help. We see ourselves as accountable to students,
and we can best represent your concerns when students actively participate in
ASSU decision-making. Our introductory meeting will be at the ASSU on
Thursday, October 20 at 6 pm; dessert (dinner?) provided.
• Senate Associates —
Frosh, transfers, and first year grad students can become active members on
the Senate with all the rights and responsibilities (except voting) of full Senate
members. Call soon to apply.
Interested:
Call the Council of Presidents at 725-1465 or stop by the ASSU
(2nd Floor, Tresidder Union).
Office hours: David Brown (M 1-2, T 11-2, W 2-4, Th 11-2, F 1-3)
Canetta Ivy (T 2-3, W 12-3, Th 1-3, F 9-11)
