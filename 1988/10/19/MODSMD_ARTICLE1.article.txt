# Stanford's commitment to racial harmony questioned
## 
### Diane Bisgeier Staff writer 
A grueling meeting between
University officials, Ujamaa
House residents, members of the
Black Student Union and con
cerned students produced little
consensus over how the
University should respond to two
racially offensive fliers posted in
Ujamaa.
However, the one-and-a-half
hour meeting did allow, for the
first time, an all-out airing of
views for students and adminis
trators on the incidents.
Two students living in Lagunita
Court confessed Sunday to creat
ing one of the fliers.
University President Donald
Kennedy, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Norm Robinson
and Dean of Undergraduate Ad

missions Jean Fetter, were among
several top University officials
present in a packed Ujamaa
lounge of over 200 people Monday
night.
"In the short term, concerning
this case, we can talk as we are
this evening and continue to talk
about ways to investigate and ap
ply disciplinary procedures," Ken
nedy said. "By responding to
issues like this and by prosecuting
it, we deliver the message that
this isn't acceptable."
When asked what he thought
of students who viewed the inci
dent as "no big deal," Kennedy
explained that "once some people
in high positions begin to take it
very seriously in a public way,"
students will treat the incident
more seriously as well.
However, Council of Presidents
member Connetta Ivy said, "The
University is not making a com

mitment to educating people"
about minority issues. According
to Ivy, the University denounces
such incidents on the basis of ig
norance.
Ivy also implied that the Uni
versity's lack of an ethnic studies
requirement sends students a
mixed message concerning expec
tations.
One white freshman attending
the meeting remarked that stu
dents "sort of get an overdose" of
ethnic programming and "just
want to turn it off."
BSU Chair Mary Dillard
pointed to the comment as
evidence of the failure of the Uni
versity itself to meet the respon
sibility.
"A lot of students want to 'turn
it off.' We cannot turn things off,"
Dillard said.

Two residents of Ujamaa hold up the defaced posters that sparked concern over racism in the house.
"There is a desire for something
to happen tomorrow, but the
kinds of problems we're dealing
with don't lend themselves to
that," Robinson said. "But we can
go to work on them tomorrow in
finding solutions."
Robinson suggested other areas
the University may consider
changing, such as orientation for
resident assistants and policies on
theme houses.
"While we think we're making
progress, (the incident) is a
reminder of how far we have to
go. Thinking, planning and even
listening to one another tonight
are just some steps we can take,"
he said.
Kennedy suggested that one
possible solution would be to

modify the Fundamental Stand
ard in conjunction with the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council.
But when asked to commit his
support for such an action, Ken
nedy would only say that he would
help in drafting a proposal.
"If I seem hesitant, it's because
I've learned not to promise too
much," said Kennedy, who de
fended his lack of commitment by
adding that he resents "the im
plication that there is something
that is understood by (those call
ing for change) and not under
stood by (the adminstration)."
Former BSU Chair Steve Phil
lips cited the University Commit
tee on Minority Issues as one
possible mechanism for achieving
institutional change.
The University established
UCMI last spring in response to
a demand by the Rainbow Agenda,
