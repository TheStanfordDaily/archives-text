# Third party candidates urge voter independence
## 
### Maryellen Driscoll 
Four representatives of political third
parties encouraged students Monday
night to "make a statement about your
own values" on election day by voting
for a third party candidate.
In a program sponsored by Theta Xi,
members of the American Independent
Party, the Libertarian Party, the Peace
and Freedom Party and the Socialist
Labor Party said that their parties pro
vide options for those dissatisfied with
the values of the Democratic and Re
publican presidential candidates.
Dr. Edmon Kaiser, an American In
dependent member, said, "I used to be
a Democrat . . . and lots of American

Independents are old Republicans. We
discovered that our party left us a long
time before we left our parties."
Bill Evers, a member of the Liber
tarian Party, told the 40-person audi
ence, that voting for a third-party
candidate "is the most powerful (state
ment) that you can make about your
own values."
Despite ballot restrictions that make
it difficult for third party candidates to
get on the ballot in many states, all
parties represented at the program, ex
cept the Socialist Labor Party, have can
didates on this year's ballot.
However, campaign funding for third
party candidates is quite limited com
pared to the money Bush and Dukakis

are spending, Evers said.
Evers, who received three degrees in
political science at Stanford,
humorously mentioned that David Let
terman endorsed Libertarian presiden
tial candidate Ron Paul the other night.
Elizabeth Barron, a Peace and Free
dom Party member, said her party does
not want Americans to waste their vote.
"I'd like to see the people give a mass
rejection to the Republicans and Dem
ocrats," she said.
Neil Feldman, the Theta Xi resident
assistant, said, "We wanted to have this
program, because we felt that there was
too much emphasis on Dukakis and
Bush.. . . It's important to know there
are other candidates."
