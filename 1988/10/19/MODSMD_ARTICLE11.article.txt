## Hurricane hits Columbia Joan heading north towards Panama, Costa Rica 
### 
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) —
Hurricane Joan, puzzling
forecasters with its unusual path
through the southern Caribbean
yesterday, unleashed floods in
northern Colombia that left about
50 people dead, missing or in
jured, officials said.
Joan was headed toward the
Colombian island resort of San
Andres, 500 miles north of the
Colombian coast. On Monday, the
storm buffeted northern Colom
bia with heavy rains and winds
of 65 mph before heading north
toward Nicaragua, Costa Rica and
Honduras.
In Costa Rica, officials said the
storm was headed for Puerto
Limon, a town of about 8,000
people 105 miles southeast of the
capital, San Jose. The officials
said they were considering an
evacuation.
In the northern Colombian
town of Carmen de Bolivar, 360
miles north of Bogota, at least
three people were killed Monday

and about 38 were missing, Victor
Leon Mendoza of the Bolivar state
government said.
A child also was killed and seven
people injured Monday in the
town of Uribia on Colombia's
Guajira Peninsula, police said in
a communique. Government offi
cials called foreign reports that
200 were killed in the town "ab
solutely false."
At 9 p.m. EDT Joan was cen
tered near latitude 11.3 north,
longitude 77.2 west, the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla., said in a statement. It said
the hurricane's center was about
310 miles southeast of San Andres
and 225 miles northeast of Colon,
Panama. Joan was moving
westward between 5 and 10 mph
and little change was expected
overnight.
Maximum sustained winds
were near 95 mph, and satellite
photographs indicated Joan, the
fifth hurricane of the Atlantic
season, might be strengthening in

the next day or two.
A hurricane watch was in effect
for the north coast of Panama
from Punta San Bias to Boca del
Toro and for San Andres.
Panama was placed on a state
of alert. Civil defense authorities
urged people to stay calm and
broadcast emergency instructions
on radio and television.
Long lines formed at super
markets and pharmacies in
Panama City as people heeded
warnings to stock up on supplies.
In Colombia, Camilo Cardenas,
president of the National Emer
gency Committee, said in a news
release that about 200 homes in
Carmen de Bolivar were destroyed
or flooded.
In Uribia, a town of 45,000,
about 75 percent of the dwelings
were destroyed or flooded, police
said.

possible landfall.
