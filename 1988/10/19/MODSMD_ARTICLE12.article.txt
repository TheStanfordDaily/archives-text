NEW DELHI, India (AP) - An
Indian Airlines jetliner with 135
people on board crashed today and
exploded in central India, the air
line said. At least 100 people died,
a spokeswoman said.
The Indian Airlines jet
slammed to the ground at 5:37
a.m. near the city of Ahmadabad,
about 300 miles southwest of New
Delhi, according to an airline
spokeswoman, who declined to be
identified.
The Boeing 737, flying to Ah
madabad from Bombay with 129
passengers and a crew of six,
crashed attempting to land and
exploded in flames, the spokes
woman said.

The aircraft, acquired
in 1971, is one of the
oldest in the airline's
fleet.

The plane started its approach
to the airport when it suddenly
went down about one minute
before landing, three miles from
the runway, said an Ahmadabad
airport controller, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. It ex
ploded on impact, he said.
At least four survivors have
been taken to hospitals, he said.

Authorities did not know im
medidately what caused the crash
except that the plane was at
tempting to land in poor weather.
Ahmadabad is about 220 miles
from the Pakistan border in
Gujarat state.
The aircraft, acquired in 1971,
is one of the oldest in the airline's
fleet.
Indian Airlines, the domestic
carrier, has come under fire re
cently for its poor management
and maintenance record and fre
quent delays.
On June 19, an Indian Airlines
plane crashed at New Delhi air
port, but everyone on board sur
vived.
