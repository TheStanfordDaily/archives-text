### 
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) —
A man wearing a headband with
anti-American slogans jumped
from the fourth-floor window of
a campus building yesterday, as
400 students clashed with riot
police in anti-government
protests.
Officials at Seoul's Yonsei Uni
versity said the man wrapped
himself in a large South Korean
national flag, shouted slogans
against the United States and the
government of President Roh Tae
Woo, and then jumped.
They identified him as Kim
Kyong Ku, 32, a laborer and said
he was hospitalized with two bro

ken legs.
Ritualistic suicide is often used
by radical students and dissidents
in South Korea to dramatize their
cause.
Elsewhere in the capital, about
400 students from Kyunghee and
Konkuk universities hurled
firebombs and rocks at riot police
and shouted demands for with
drawal of 42,000 U.S. troops sta
tioned in South Korea under a
defense treaty, witnesses said.
They also demanded the arrest
of former President Chun Doo
Hwan for alleged corruption in
volving his seven-year administra
tion.

Police reported no arrests or
injuries in the two clashes, each
of which lasted more than one
hour. Police used tear gas to keep
the students from marching into
the streets and fighting was con
fined to school gates, witnesses
said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
Radical students say the United
States supported Chun in
militarily putting down the
Kwangju revolt in 1980, the worst
in modern South Korean history.
In a separate incident, riot
police moved in on blind protest
ers and arrested about 20 of their
leaders Tuesday.
