Philip Morris makes bid for Kraft
NEW YORK (AP) — Cash is burning a hole
in the pocket of Philip Morris Companies Inc.,
the cigarette, food and brewing giant that began
an $11 billion cash tender offer for Kraft Inc.
yesterday.
Philip Morris is hoping its acquisition of Kraft
will solve two problems: finding a place for excess
cash and readying the company for the interna
tional food wars of the 19905.
The offer, announced late Monday, formally
began yesterday, and Wall Street took a cautious
view.
Kraft's stock shot up $28.12 a share to $88.25,
just under the $90-a-share offer. But Philip Mor
ris stock fell $4.50 a share to $95.50, reflecting
investors' worries that the expense of the acqui
sition would hurt the company's profits. Trading
was extremely heavy in both stocks.
Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said
it was re-examining the credit ratings of both
companies and might downgrade them.
The immense profitability of cigarettes is what
gives Philip Morris the muscle to try to buy
Kraft, a deal that would give the company more
control of supermarket shelf space and an entry
to the important European market.
The purchase becomes especially important in
light of the recent $5.23 billion bid by Britain's
Grand Metropolitan PLC for Pillsbury Co. Pills
bury's directors urged stockholders to reject the
offer Tuesday.
If successful, the bid would accelerate a trend
in which the food business is being concentrated
in the hands of a few giant multinational com
panies.

If Philip Morris succeeds in acquiring Kraft,
it will mean that someone could puff on a
Marlboro, sip a glass of Miller Lite or Kool-Aid
and munch on Velveeta or Jell-0 without ever
buying a product not made by Philip Morris.
West Bank fighting claims two
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli troops firing plas
tic bullets killed two Palestinians: a teen-ager
and a 5-year-old boy, and wounded a U.S. jour
nalist during clashes yesterday in the occupied
West Bank, Arab hospital officials said.
An army spokesman confirmed the deaths and
said five people had plastic bullet wounds, in
cluding American photographer Neal Cassidy, the
first foreign journalist shot in the 10-month Pal
estinian uprising over Israeli rule in the occupied
lands.
Hospital officials said six people were wounded.
The 5-year-old boy died after he was hit with
plastic bullets in the chest, stomach and left hand
as he played in a schoolyard near his home,
according to officials at A 1 Ittihad Hospital.
The child, identified as Deyaa Fayez, was shot
when Israeli soldiers opened fire on a nearby
group of stone-throwing Palestinians, Arab
reporters said. The reporters and hospital officials
spoke on condition of anonymity.
Hospital officials identified the second victim
as Khaled Tbaileh, 14, of Nablus. Officials at St.
John Hospital said he was shot in the chest with
a plastic bullet in a second clash in Nablus, the
West Bank's largest city.
The deaths raised to 301 the number of Pal
estinians killed since Arabs launched the uprising
Dec. 8. Six Israelis also have died.
