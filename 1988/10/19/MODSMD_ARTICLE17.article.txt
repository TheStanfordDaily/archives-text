A good plan: get rid of
Manzanita and build a
dormitory in its place

GOODBYE and good rid
dance.
The plan to replace the
Manzanita trailers with an under
graduate dormitory has evoked
sighs of relief from students and
staff alike. Manzanita, a temporary
solution to a housing shortage in
the early 19705, has been an en
during eyesore for 20 years.
The Board of Trustees should
move promptly during its Decem
ber meeting to implement the pro
posal for removal.
Notorious for its thin walls and
booming ant population, Manzan
ita has long outlived its temporary
status. While some residents enjoy
the lifestyle the trailers offer, the
quality of the housing there is un
worthy of an institution as wealthy
as Stanford.
Not only are they physically
dilapidated, but they also impede
residential programs and social ac
tivities since there are no common
areas for meetings.
The University should ensure
the completion of the new residen
ces by 1992, the targeted opening
date. And should redouble its ef
forts to secure funding for the proj
ect, since severe rent increases are

not a palatable method for financ
ing the new dormitory.
The plan to tear down 25 to 30
trailers to make way for a real
dormitory is is a temporary incon
venience and certainly worth the
future benefits.
Building a dorm for 400 to 450
undergraduates would mean
taking a substantial step toward
the goal of four years of housing
for undergraduates who deserve it.
And to build the new complex
at Manzanita is a wise decision. It
salvages an alternative building
site (the popular driving range) at
least temporarily.
The dorm could also facilitate
the expansion of study areas in
other dorms and mitigate crowding
in small rooms.
It could also add to the East
Campus a number of amenities. A
program center like the one at
Governor's Corner and a recrea
tional field would be positive up
shots for residents who have long
vied for the use of Wilbur field.
A final benefit could be a joint
kitchen for Branner and the new
facility, permitting Branner resi
dents to dine in their own residence
on weekends.
A new residence would markedly
improve the lives of students in
the East Campus and move closer
to guaranteeing housing to all un
dergraduates who desire it, placing
Stanford housing high amongst the
ranks of its competitors in the
East.
