## Racism runs rampant, even among 'intellectuals' 
### 
IT IS TIME for Stanford University,
as a predominantly white institu
tion, to realize that racism exists
and pervades its community.
At Ujamaa, residents learned of two
blatantly anti-black occurences which
took place within the last two weeks,
symptoms of the "racist disease" which
has plagued Stanford since its incep
tion. Yet, despite the display of anger
and disgust from all the residents of
the house at these obviously ignorant
racist actions, and despite the efforts
of all the minority groups on campus,
racism continues.
No longer can we sit back and lie to
ourselves and say that racism does not
exist at Stanford, especially in light of
numerous other racist actions and

opinions which have become apparent
very recently at Stanford.
Only last spring quarter, members of
the Phi Delt fraternity on campus
dressed in attire similar to the KKK

cloaks and stood outside Otero. The
Univerity's response: slapping the
involved students on the wrist and
dismissing the incident as an excep
tional case.
Also, some black students fighting
for CIV were told to go back to Africa
if they did not like Western Culture.
In another case, a poster of Jesse
Jackson for president was ripped off a
black student's door. The list goes on.
It is unfortunate and disgraceful
that Stanford has chosen not to accept
that even among its "intellectuals,"
racism is a very powerful and om
nipresent force.
As well as needing our support,
minority groups need us to be accept
ing of their demands and help them in

achieving equality. It would be a
travesty to humanity for us to allow
minority groups to solely undertake
the burden of educating those many
narrow-minded racists out there.
No longer can we disown ourselves
from the responsibility of eradicating
racism if we want to consider ourselves
human beings. So let us stop closing
our eyes to these incidents. Not until
we realize that the problem exists can
we attack it.
For our own integrity we must all
share the burden of educating and
eradicating those ignorant opinions
which perpetuate racism on this
campus.
