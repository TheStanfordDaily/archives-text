# COP criticized for alienating behavior
## 
### 
I for one fully support The Daily's
challenge of the Council of President's
duty and role in taking a side in the
University/United Stanford Workers
dispute. Who is the COP to take a
stand on such an issue — thereby
showing the University in effect that 1
am in favor of a strike?
But this single issue is not the only
one that upsets me. No, after three
years of silence, I wish to offer a few
criticisms to the COP and other active
and vocal groups that have been de
manding recognition and change from
the administration and government.
When I arrived here, I too was a
liberal and an idealist. Today, I have
evolved into a conservative, yet I still
hold to my ideals and values. I am
against racism, discrimination, unfair
labor practices, children starving,
people going homeless, and missiles

being pumped into poor nations.
But somehow (it is actually no mys
tery to me), I have been alienated by
every group that believes in these
same ideals. They have told me my
goals are not extreme enough, I do not
see the world properly, and I come
from the wrong socio-economic back
ground to understand anyway. My
basic belief is that there are many
different paths to the same goal and
many alternatives to every issue — be
it the propogation of the Western supe
riority mjih, unfair or questionable
labor disputes, or minority accomoda
tion and assimilation issues.
For me to assume any of my alter
natives is better is just as absurd as
the rest of campus telling me their
solutions are best. The world is not
black and white.
I openly admit that I have failed in
doing my part in standing up for the
issues I believe in. I have been afraid
to take all but minor stances against
the common, emotional and popular
view. I have feared that more
moderate or conservative stances might

be interpreted as incompassionate or
prejudice.
I accept my share of the blame for
the changes that have occurred Here as
we have gone from a campus of free
thought to one of closed minds. What I
hope is that others might see the dan
ger in the attitudes prevalent on
campus today.
Surely protests and demands are an
effective and important way to bring
about changes, but there is also a need
to talk more and discuss issues rather
than just yelling about them, demand
ing changes without much thought.
I ask the COP and other vocal
groups to consider their long term
goals when taking actions and making
strong statements around campus. The
COP represents all of us, not just
those that espouse your views. Stop
alienating the rest of us who must
remain silent for fear of being labeled
racist, elitist or incompassionate. At
least make an effort to find out how
we feel on the changes that are taking
place. Tell us about the labor disputes
and find out our views before taking a

stance. When we all work together, a
lot more can be accomplished.
But if extreme stances continue and
wild views are spouted, you will drive
that silent sector further and further
away. Alienation leads to bitterness,
bitterness leads to resentment, and
resentment propogates the same atti
tudes, misconceptions and prejudices
that we all wish to abolish.
In light of the recent events at
Ujamaa, the timing of this letter is
admittedly not great, but I feel this is
an important issue and hope it will not
be misunderstood. I am not writing
about racial violence, but rather about
the COP's actions and several other
events, protests and changes that
have occurred on campus over the last
three years.
In light of all of these, I sense an
even greater need for us all to stop
and listen to each other so that we can
work together sensibly and with open
minds to seek positive change here at
Stanford.
