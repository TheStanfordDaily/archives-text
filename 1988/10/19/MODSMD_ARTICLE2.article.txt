Threatening to strike at the end of the
month, the United Stanford Workers an
nounced yesterday that they will either
ratify a new labor contract or strike at
midnight Oct. 31, according to the USW
chief negotiator.
"We need to have a contract by that
date," USW chief negotiator Mary Mocine
said. "If we don't, there will be a strike."
"The union has the right to strike,"
University lawyer Michael Vartain said.
"(But) with hard work by both parties,
we'd like to have an agreement."
The members of the union will meet

tract if the University and USW reach a
labor agreement, or vote to strike. If the
members vote to strike, the walk-out will
begin midnight Oct. 31, according to
Mocine.
"We hope it will be a contract ratifica
tion meeting. If not, it is our expectation
that it will be a strike meeting," Mocine
said.

The 1,300 technical, service and main
tenance workers represented by the USW
on campus, at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center and at the Medical Center
have been working without a contract
since the previous three-year contract ex
pired Aug. 31.
Since late July, the University and the
union have held 20 bargaining sessions.
Negotiations hit a dead end Oct. 8 and
resumed Monday after the USW agreed
to federal mediation.
The next bargaining session will be
held in the presence of Commissioner
Maggie Jacobsen from the Federal Media
tion and Conciliation Service today at
12:30 p.m.

'The union has the right to
strike ... (but) with hard
work by both parties, we'd
like to have an agreement.'

The USW and the University met sep
arately with the mediator for the first
time Monday, but only minor issues were
resolved, according to Mocine.
Vartain said that during the Universi
ty's meeting with Jacobsen, they
"reviewed outstanding issues, exchanged
proposals and clarified some issues."
"We're quite far apart on the critical

issues at this point," Vartain said. "Both
parties really need to work hard at the
table."
The critical issues that divide the USW
and the University include the grievance
procedure, union dues, the wage-increase
plan, benefits and questions on the rights
of the University to enter into contracts
with outside institutions and firms.
The USW is also known as Local 680
of the Service Employees International
Union, a division of the AFL-CIO.
Mocine also said that Paul Varacalli,
a vice president of the SEIU and president
of the Northern California Joint Council
of the SEIU, would support the USW
and request the SEIU Joint Council to
sanction a strike.
