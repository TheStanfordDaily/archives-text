## Double-speak doldrums 
### 
Earlier this year while i was
walking through the mall, minding
my own business, I passed a young
girl and her grandmother. No sooner had
I gone by them, than I heard the grand
mother say "bread and butter." And then
she said to her .granddaughter, "That's
what you say wl en somethin's the bigger
than the both of ya\"
Needless to say, I was taken aback,
primarily by the absurdity of that phrase,
"bread and butter." It makes no sense.
And on top of that, it just plain sounds
dumb.
I mentioned this little incident later to
a couple of friends, and they got a laugh
out of it. The conversation soon turned
to words and phrases and jargon that we
all hated in general — sort of a pet-peeve
hash out. Here are a couple of the more
interesting ones:
Hamper. This one got universal disap
proval. I think that it coryures up too
many disgusting pictures of suburban
American housewives going to the super
market in a bath robe with curlers in
their hair, pushing their cart around and
scolding their snot-nosed kids in a nag
ging, nasal voice for not picking up all
of their clothes and putting them in the
"hamper." At least that's what it did for
me.
Moisten (said with a lisp). This word
is just plain wimpy. It's to the English
language what egg salad is to American
cuisine. Besides, only a wimp would could
go through the trouble of moistening
something when he could just as easily
wet it.
Then there are those words that don't

really sound bad at all, but just irritate
the hell out of me. Mostly jargon words
and phrases. This leads us into a bigger
issue, one a little more pressing than just
irrational hatred of certain words.
Not that I have anything against the
field, but computer science needs to bear
a large share of the blame here. Its seems
that computer scientists have a knack for
taking innocent, unsuspecting, everyday
words and shackling them to technical
situations.
Like with "flavor." I don't know how
many times I've heard a CS teacher say,
"There are several flavors of this com
mand which can be implemented. .
What?! Flavors?! Ooh, I think I'll have
a chocolate. Better make it two scoops
and hold the jimmies, please.
Then there was the time I overheard
two computer hackers. "I can't find this
certain program on the computer,
Eugene," said one. "Oh, well, I think it
lives on another system, Herman,"
replied the other. What a perverse use
of the verb "to live," I thought. Is the
program happy "living" there? And if it's
no longer there, should we mourn its
death?
Maybe I'm being too literal, but it stops
me when I hear people mixing references
between computers and things human.
It is especially bothersome when com
puter terms are used to describe human
situations. Now people in the business
world choose to "interface" with each
other instead of just sitting around for
a nice little chat.
Here, though, I don't blame the com
puter people as much as I do the yuppies

who have perverted the terms. Do these
same people call up for a date: "Hi! I
was just thinking, if you weren't doing
anything Friday night, maybe we could
go out for dinner and some interfacing"?
I remember someone saying that the
decline of civilization begins with the cor
ruption of language. This idea is often
laughed at for being paranoid or reac
tionary. But I don't think the author
meant any kind of casual relationship
between the two. Rather, that corruption
of language is just a symptom of the
larger illness of decadence.
English is such a rich language. Besides
being a symptom of a larger illness, it
would be a shame in and of itself to lose
all its subtleties and nuances.
If I'm right about this, our society is
probably in the early stages of something
like a cold. But if all we have are sniffles
and a sore throat now, we should be
wary of the headache to come. I
hate to be apocalyptic, but things are
probably going to get worse.
Sometime in the not-too-distant future,
on a quiet lake shore under a starry clear
sky, a man will whisper his love to a
woman: "I've got a hard drive for your
mainframe."

than the both of ya\"
Needless to say, I was taken aback,
primarily by the absurdity of that phrase,
"bread and butter." It makes no sense.
And on top of that, it just plain sounds
dumb.
I mentioned this little incident later to
a couple of friends, and they got a laugh
out of it. The conversation soon turned
to words and phrases and jargon that we
all hated in general — sort of a pet-peeve
hash out. Here are a couple of the more
interesting ones:
Hamper. This one got universal disap
proval. I think that it coryures up too
many disgusting pictures of suburban
American housewives going to the super
market in a bath robe with curlers in
their hair, pushing their cart around and
scolding their snot-nosed kids in a nag
ging, nasal voice for not picking up all
of their clothes and putting them in the
"hamper." At least that's what it did for
me.
Moisten (said with a lisp). This word
is just plain wimpy. It's to the English
language what egg salad is to American
cuisine. Besides, only a wimp would could
go through the trouble of moistening
something when he could just as easily
wet it.
Then there are those words that don't

really sound bad at all, but just irritate
the hell out of me. Mostly jargon words
and phrases. This leads us into a bigger
issue, one a little more pressing than just
irrational hatred of certain words.
Not that I have anything against the
field, but computer science needs to bear
a large share of the blame here. Its seems
that computer scientists have a knack for
taking innocent, unsuspecting, everyday
words and shackling them to technical
situations.
Like with "flavor." I don't know how
many times I've heard a CS teacher say,
"There are several flavors of this com
mand which can be implemented. .
What?! Flavors?! Ooh, I think I'll have
a chocolate. Better make it two scoops
and hold the jimmies, please.
Then there was the time I overheard
two computer hackers. "I can't find this
certain program on the computer,
Eugene," said one. "Oh, well, I think it
lives on another system, Herman,"
replied the other. What a perverse use
of the verb "to live," I thought. Is the
program happy "living" there? And if it's
no longer there, should we mourn its
death?
Maybe I'm being too literal, but it stops
me when I hear people mixing references
between computers and things human.
It is especially bothersome when com
puter terms are used to describe human
situations. Now people in the business
world choose to "interface" with each
other instead of just sitting around for
a nice little chat.
Here, though, I don't blame the com
puter people as much as I do the yuppies

who have perverted the terms. Do these
same people call up for a date: "Hi! I
was just thinking, if you weren't doing
anything Friday night, maybe we could
go out for dinner and some interfacing"?
I remember someone saying that the
decline of civilization begins with the cor
ruption of language. This idea is often
laughed at for being paranoid or reac
tionary. But I don't think the author
meant any kind of casual relationship
between the two. Rather, that corruption
of language is just a symptom of the
larger illness of decadence.
English is such a rich language. Besides
being a symptom of a larger illness, it
would be a shame in and of itself to lose
all its subtleties and nuances.
If I'm right about this, our society is
probably in the early stages of something
like a cold. But if all we have are sniffles
and a sore throat now, we should be
wary of the headache to come. I
hate to be apocalyptic, but things are
probably going to get worse.
Sometime in the not-too-distant future,
on a quiet lake shore under a starry clear
sky, a man will whisper his love to a
woman: "I've got a hard drive for your
mainframe."
