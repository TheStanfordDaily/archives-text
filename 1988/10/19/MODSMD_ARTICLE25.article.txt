## Students advise on birds, bees 
### Evan Tuchinsky Senior staff writer 
It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it.
Combatting the misinformation about birth
control and what constitutes safe sex that exists
even on Stanford soil, the counselors at the Con
traceptive Information Center are going down
into the trenches to fight a war that just 10
years ago seemed like a losing battle.
Now, however, with the rate of teenage and
student pregnancy plus the multitude of danger
ous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the
contraceptive center is finally earning the com
munity's notice. The days when the counselors
would only see a dozen people in a week are
gone, replaced by fairly regular visits, phone calls
and outreach programs.
According to junior Catherine Sanderson, a
counselor at the center, a place where students
can go for contraceptive advice fills a definite
need at Stanford.
"I think . . . that although Cowell has given
contraceptives for a while as part of the student
health center, they haven't had the time to coun
sel.
"A lot of people are ignorant about birth control
methods, about the alternatives, and hearing in
formation from students it's much less intimidat
ing. It is a loaded subject, somewhat embarrassing
to people."
To counter this information gap, the center
has a wide variety of communication avenues.
Of first and foremost importance is the con
sistent availability of student counselors who,
armed with fact sheets and the latest publications
pertaining to contraceptives, staff the cozy office
on the second floor of Cowell to answer questions
on a walk-in or call-in basis.
The Center also provides pill and diaphragm
clinics four times a week, sells condoms at cost
(as well as sponges and spermicides for
diaphragms) and staffs outreach programs, when
dorms or houses request them.
"You always get three or four people, guys and
girls, coming in to buy condoms," Sanderson
said. "Usually there are a couple of phone calls.
People call about pregnancy testing, and people
call about AIDS testing now. That's really new."
The contraceptive center also handles calls from
people needing more than just general informa
tion. "Sometimes we get scare calls like 'I was
with my girlfriend and my condom broke, is there
anything we can do and why did this happen?"'
For those who take the time to come in, a
wealth of books, magazines and periodically up
dated fact sheets on STDs and contraceptive

methods await perusal. In addition, the center
has a Macintosh computer with a special program
designed to advise clients about the methods best
suited to their particular lifestyle and health.
But perhaps the most important factor is the
unbiased approach that the center demands of
its counselors. Though many hold very strong
opinions on contraception, pregnancy and abor
tions — a common reason why most of them
work here — these views are purposely omitted
from conversations with clients.
"One of the things they emphasize when we're
counseling here is that we are not supposed to
favor birth control," Sanderson replied. "We are
not supposed to recommend any birth control
method."
That job is reserved for the computer, which
can weigh the options more objectively and
anonymously. Utilizing a relatively new program
called Personal Choice, the Macintosh asks clients
about their pertinent health history, typical be
havior and actions as well as what the clients
are looking for in the contraceptive they choose.
After sorting out the information, the computer
picks out the methods best suited for the client.
"We have the program, and we go over it with
people. It has them list their most important
criteria because people want different things from
birth control," Snaderson explained. "We really
try to find out what they're interested in and
try not to give our opinion. Sometimes if we've
used something or heard something either good
or bad, that may come out in the course of a
counsel, but really we're just supposed to provide
information.
"The other thing that should be mentioned is
that this is a service for heterosexual and
homosexual couples, homosexual people and het
erosexual people."
